00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:02.600
Hey guys Spirit of the Law here

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:06.499
Let me start this video off by saying that we all love this game.

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.340
But today, we're going to talk about the things that we don't love about the game

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.300
I'm going to talk about the 20 things that we all hate in Age of Empires 2

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:40.569
Let's start off with the moderate inconveniences,

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:42.880
Now it might just be me,

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:45.680
But I've never been a big fan of the Huskarl pierce armor,

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:50.600
six pierce armor in the Castle Age, before upgrades is a little bit overpowered

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.650
Now, I'll admit, that's not much to complain about but we're just getting started

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:58.239
Next on our list is farms dying, especially if a lot of them do it at once

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:02.109
I don't know if it's the annoying sound or the fact that the Villagers are idle

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:08.110
Maybe it's that I have to stop being an awesome general to go back and reseed my farms, but something about it just irks me

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:13.160
Number 18: getting housed. We've all done it. We all hate it.

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:16.760
We've all made that signature &lt;sound of exasperation&gt; when it happens.

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:19.400
You know what I'm talking about.

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.669
Number 17 is when you send a villager out in Arabia

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:25.200
To build a forward barracks or go out and build a wall in Black forest,

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.000
and they're killed by wolves.

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:31.000
Wolves don't even eat them.  Look at that. They're just standing there.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.709
Number 16, It's usually your own fault when it happens, but sometimes lag can do it too.

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:38.648
So when your Villager luring a boar gets killed by the boar.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.120
That's easier to swallow than the wolves because at least the Villagers shot the boar first.

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:45.670
Still makes you feel like a newbie.

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:50.380
That's another alternate version of this as well where the lure gets back to the town center safely,

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:53.500
But the boar still kills one of the other villagers.

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:56.740
Number 50 on our list is forgetting to research Murder Holes.

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:01.210
Because, you know, whoever's in there shooting arrows can't drop rocks or anything.

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:04.840
Number 14 is Trebuchets,

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.060
and this goes for anything else that has a longer range than the castle.

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:10.200
Feels kind of cheap.

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:13.689
Next we're going to look at the serious annoyances

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.000
Number 13 is bugged maps.

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:22.780
Admittedly, this doesn't happen all that often, but when it does it can be pretty annoying,

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:28.320
and it can be in the form of gold boxed in by trees, it can be boar, deer not spawning.

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:31.600
There's lots of ways that this can happen and every time it's annoying

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:36.410
The next on our list doesn't happen as often now in the Forgotten Empires expansion,

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:39.829
But it used to happen sometimes and that's losing to a Wonder.

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.910
This is especially annoying when you would have won had the game been set on conquest.

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:48.439
Next on our list at number 11 is losing for any other reason.

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:53.640
Let's be honest, if you lose to a wonder you can still tell yourself you're probably the better player.

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.100
Not so easy when you see them running through your base.

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:59.479
Moving into the top 10 now,

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:02.000
Let's take a look at some of the major frustrations.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.030
Remember that time you finally saved up enough for a castle,

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:11.089
And we're just putting it down, and your villagers got attacked, and no matter what you did you still couldn't finish the castle.

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.280
Yeah, that's number 10

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.660
Because, you know, it's like in real life,

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:18.660
when you don't put that last stone in the castle It's completely useless.

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:23.720
To add insult to injury, deleting the castle basically gives you no stone back.

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:29.240
Number 9 can either be done by you or your ally and it's when suicide units open the gates

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:32.600
On the other hand it might be kind of cool

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:36.589
if there was like a bribery aspect to Age of Empires and if they work that into the game.

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:38.810
But anyway, as it is right now. It's just annoying

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:44.560
Now number 8, you can argue, it's just part of being a good player, but I find it super annoying.

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:47.200
and that's when your infantry gets killed by Hit-and-Run tactics

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:52.970
Now I'll admit, I'm a pretty chatty guy in Age of Empires, and if that's not your thing, okay,

00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:56.089
but sometimes a little bit of basic communication is nice.

00:03:56.090 --> 00:04:01.700
It's nice to work together to come up with your strategies and stuff, and when somebody just doesn't answer you at all or

00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:05.719
Resigns without even asking for help, it leaves you in a bit of a tough spot.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.200
Number six feels like one of those cosmic paradoxes,

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:14.209
where you don't have any gold so you decide that you're gonna trade to get some gold,

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:16.740
But you need gold to start that trade.

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:18.780
So you need gold to get gold.

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:20.900
That's kind of annoying when you don't have it.

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:26.359
Still it's not quite ragequit worthy and that's what we're going to talk about right now: the top 5

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:31.880
Now a lot of people might think that this should be number 1, but really, I got some more good ones coming up.

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:33.870
Number 5 is lag

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:37.000
People really need to stop trying to play Age of Empires on their TI-83

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:43.180
At least with lag, if you can wait the other guys out they'll probably resign and you'll win.

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:46.000
Hence my 1660 Elo.

00:04:47.699 --> 00:04:49.760
Number 4 is fighting uphill.

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:52.600
I know what you're thinking,, that's part of the game, that's part of the strategy.

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:57.500
No. When you have an equal sized army and you get your ass handed to you that sucks

00:04:58.199 --> 00:05:01.400
I don't know why you can't just stab their ankles or something.

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:06.199
Number 3 is when you're getting a little bit wild with your clicks, and you accidentally delete your castle.

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:10.880
Seriously, if you try to delete your castle there should be a little window that comes up that says:

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:12.980
Are you sure you want to complete this action?

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:15.160
Why would you ever want to destroy your castle?

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:17.509
That should probably raise some red flags for the game.

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:21.079
This is especially annoying if you could use your castle five seconds later.

00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:24.480
That still doesn't compare to number 2.

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:27.679
If you've ever played as the Persians, you've definitely made war elephants before.

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:30.169
They're like tanks with tusks. It's crazy.

00:05:30.169 --> 00:05:34.720
And if you did make them, you probably rage quit when the other guy converted them all.

00:05:34.720 --> 00:05:37.840
You convert an elephant's religion and it switches sides?

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:41.839
That doesn't make any sense, and now not only do you not have your elephants,

00:05:41.849 --> 00:05:45.019
He's got them, and you'll be seeing them again real soon.

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:51.590
And finally we've come to the number one thing that we all hate most in AoE -

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:55.729
You all know what it is. You don't have to wait for me to say it, but I will

00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:58.260
It's a hole in the wall.

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.500
Booming is a lot of fun,

00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:06.840
You build up your walls you create a ton of Villagers, and you just gather ridiculous amounts of resources.

00:06:06.840 --> 00:06:08.500
You feel like a champ.

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:09.740
It's a huge investment,

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:14.820
But it totally pays off because you don't even need a military. And then what's this?

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:16.359
You've left a hole in the wall.

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:19.509
And they're all coming in and that whole thing was for nothing.

00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:21.650
Awesome.

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:25.900
So thanks for watching everybody, I hope this didn't bring up too many painful memories for you.

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:27.790
please rate, subscribe, and comment

00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:30.713
Let me know if I missed something, share your horror stories.

00:06:30.713 --> 00:06:32.000
It's all welcome here.

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:34.570
Until next time.
