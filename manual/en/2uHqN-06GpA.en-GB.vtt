00:00:03.430 --> 00:00:08.729
Hey, in today’s video we will be learning
the easy steps to making apple juice in a

00:00:08.729 --> 00:00:15.350
press. You will need 2 jugs, a funnel, sieve,
apples and 2 buckets, one for the good parts

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:20.020
and the other for the bad parts. You will
also need a knife and chopping board and finally

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:27.020
a clean sterilized bottle. Here is the 20
liter apple press we’ll be using today.

00:00:28.389 --> 00:00:34.469
Firstly begin by chopping apples! Cut small
ones in half, medium ones into quarters and

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:39.440
finally large ones into sixths. This makes
them easier to bash later on. And get your

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:45.320
family to join in to help prepare your juice
pressing. Juice making is an ideal way to

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:50.430
use damaged fruit. Here we have a cracked
apple so remove the bad part and cut up the

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.530
rest for pressing. Give every apple a light
rinse beforehand. In this second apple we

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:01.630
have bitter-pit. Cut and remove that and again
use the rest of the apple. Don’t press rotten

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:07.760
apple and remove any badly bruised parts.
If there are blemishes don’t worry about

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:14.390
removing them, they’re still fine to use.
Keep on chopping to quarter fill a fermentation

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:21.390
bucket or half of a normal bucket. When selecting
apples for juice choose freshly picked apples

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:28.650
preferably picked that day however with cider
they need to be 4 weeks or older. This device

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:37.350
here is our basher. To make one drill a hole
into a fence post and fix in a strong dowel

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:43.509
which will act as a handle. Always keep the
top clean! Now we are at the stage to bash

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:50.150
the apples. Personally this is my favourite
part. It should take just under 2 minutes

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:57.150
to bash the 6kg or so of apples, might take
a bit less or a bit longer but here is a great

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:03.829
time to do some competition for the competitive
people here! Who can bash the fastest? My

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:10.630
family are quite competitive so that usually
happens every time. What you’re looking

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:16.270
for can be best described as an even mush;
I agree how it may not look the most appealing

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:21.630
however it is important you bash it to soften
the apples which will result in a greater

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:28.630
volume of juice when you press them. You may
need two people for this part, but if it is

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:33.800
just you, hold the bucket in one hand and
carefully scoop out the mashed apples. You’ll

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:40.800
need to scrape rest as it sticks to the sides
easily. Then with a spatula level out the

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:46.050
mixture, and you might want to place a jug
down as drips will begin to happen automatically.

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:52.760
You just want to continue repeating the past
processes, and should be around 2 ½ bashes

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:59.199
until the press will be full. As you can see
the weight of the apples will naturally start

00:02:59.199 --> 00:03:04.570
to press out juice before you have put any
additional force onto it. We have come to

00:03:04.570 --> 00:03:11.570
the stage of assembly. Begin by folding in
the muslin fabric so none of the apple mixture

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:19.110
can be seen. After that place down the 2 semi-circles
with the flat side pointing down. Stack up

00:03:24.339 --> 00:03:29.750
at least 2 levels of wooden rectangles depending
on how full the press is. Here I will use

00:03:29.750 --> 00:03:36.750
3 as they will go down when the apples are
being pressed and it saves me having to unwind

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:46.080
the handle and adding another level. Finally
after that add the large metal circle, then

00:03:51.199 --> 00:03:56.809
the plastic washer over that and then screw
on the handle and we will come to the time

00:03:56.809 --> 00:04:02.790
to make juice. It is time to make juice! It
is easy to turn the handle at first and in

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:07.369
seconds you will observe a lot of juice coming
out from the mash. The faster you press the

00:04:07.369 --> 00:04:14.369
greater he volume of juice comes out. Within
seconds you will need to change your jugs!

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:37.540
Now use any fine sieve or strainer placed
over a funnel and pour the juice into your

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:43.610
desired container. A plastic bottle in a fridge
will keep the juice fresh for 2 days to drink.

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:49.010
We are using a demi-John however, as this
juice will be used for making cider. In a

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:54.960
20 liter apple press expect to get around
a gallon of juice which is 4.5 liters. The

00:04:54.960 --> 00:05:00.250
sieve will get rid of any residue from the
mashed apples. Remember to frequently turn

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:04.900
the press every hour or so and let it drip
overnight, otherwise you could waste over

00:05:04.900 --> 00:05:11.900
a litre of juice! If you’re interested in
turning your juice into cider I strongly recommend

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:17.460
you visit my friend’s channel at ‘Alberta
Urban Garden’ or click on this link. His

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:22.490
video is a very detailed, fool-proof and easy
guide to how you can make your own delicious

00:05:22.490 --> 00:05:28.080
cider at home. Be sure to tell him I sent
you! I thank you all very much for watching
