00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.600

Prussia: It's been a long time, Austria.

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:55.120
How can you slip from my mind?

00:02:55.267 --> 00:02:58.267
After your bullet in the last battle, injuring my dear King!

00:02:59.013 --> 00:03:00.813

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:37.200

Francis: Hmph! That is a mere trifle.

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:45.760
It will not deter us from our victory.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.960
Spain: That's true. Looking at the situation,

00:03:48.053 --> 00:03:51.133
even if Prussia has an excellent leader, he is still disavantaged.

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:53.440

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:13.800
Austria: Surrender now, Prussia! You are cornered!

00:05:14.522 --> 00:05:16.882

Is this a joke played on man by fate?
