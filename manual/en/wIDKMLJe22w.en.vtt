00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:09.119
Hi. Noel from

00:00:09.119 --> 00:00:11.109
Rittenhouse.

00:00:11.109 --> 00:00:13.459
Now I going to show you how to rebuild the trigger.

00:00:13.459 --> 00:00:18.929
Now this.. the reason I am going to show how to rebuild this trigger as it is found

00:00:18.929 --> 00:00:23.099
on many pieces of our spray equipment.

00:00:23.099 --> 00:00:27.070
and if it has a leak it's a real simple fix.

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:30.919
Now,this being a new gun I'm just going to re-use the parts that I have in it.

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:35.300
So I'll show you what would come in the kit after I take it apart.

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:36.340
First of all

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:38.580
nine-sixteenth wrench,

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:43.040
take the cap off.

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:50.020
It'll be snug until you get past the "o" ring.

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:54.240
Turn it free.

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:55.930
Underneath the cap you'll find

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:58.460
spring,

00:00:58.460 --> 00:00:59.790
under the seat

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:06.790
there under the spring, is the seat.

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.610
There.

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:17.800
Now there is also a cage in here but to get that cage out we need to remove

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:24.680
the pin that actually actuates that seat.

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:28.440
So we first pull up on the trigger

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:35.030
moving this pin up so we can get at it underneath.

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:36.259
Take a 

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:39.770
flat instrument or a pick.

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:44.730
push the rod up until you can feel it coming past cage.

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:46.850
Take a pair of needle nose pliers

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:53.850
reach inside

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:01.700
grab hold of the pin,

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.030
remove the pin.

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:05.270
Now we can

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.590
take a out the cage.

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.629
You will need

00:02:09.629 --> 00:02:11.019
an easy out.

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:13.259
What it is is actually a reverse

00:02:13.259 --> 00:02:14.759
drill.

00:02:14.759 --> 00:02:17.879
You'll set it inside the cage.

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:20.650
Give it a little turn.

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.689
Give it a little tap to set it.

00:02:24.689 --> 00:02:27.059
Turn, pull

00:02:27.059 --> 00:02:30.900
and out comes the cage.

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.849
Underneath the cage

00:02:32.849 --> 00:02:35.569
is a little

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:39.049
seal that seals around the

00:02:39.049 --> 00:02:40.969
the little pin there.

00:02:40.969 --> 00:02:43.029
Just pick that out

00:02:43.029 --> 00:02:45.519
dropped it free.

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:48.619
Underneath the body and in between the trigger

00:02:48.619 --> 00:02:55.619
is another spring.

00:02:58.049 --> 00:03:05.049
And you remove that.

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:09.399
Now in the kit when you buy the new kit 

00:03:09.399 --> 00:03:15.979
there is actually an "o"ring for the cap.

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:18.819
Smaller "o" ring

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:22.099
for the seat.

00:03:22.099 --> 00:03:25.409
And on here,

00:03:25.409 --> 00:03:32.409
Let me get this easy out out.

00:03:41.799 --> 00:03:46.189
And on the cage it has another "o" ring.

00:03:46.189 --> 00:03:49.260
These are all the parts that will come in

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:52.779
the kit when you purchase it.

00:03:52.779 --> 00:03:56.399
Now basically what you do you do everything in reverse. First of all you take 

00:03:56.399 --> 00:03:57.979
the pin.

00:03:57.979 --> 00:03:58.780
Noticing that

00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:01.400
there is a flat side

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.249
and there is

00:04:03.249 --> 00:04:04.949
a hollow side.

00:04:04.949 --> 00:04:07.429
The hollow side stays inside the gun.

00:04:07.429 --> 00:04:10.839
Flat side outside.

00:04:10.839 --> 00:04:13.680
The little cups seal.

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:16.539
Cup goes up.

00:04:16.539 --> 00:04:20.109
Push the pin through.

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:24.819
So that it's seated on there.

00:04:24.819 --> 00:04:31.819
Take the spring

00:04:34.530 --> 00:04:39.120
compress it so that it will actually fit back underneath the body

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.419
like so

00:04:41.419 --> 00:04:45.489
and the trigger.

00:04:45.489 --> 00:04:48.620
Now take the pin

00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:50.509
drop it into the body of the 

00:04:50.509 --> 00:04:56.050
trigger.

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:57.479
Lining up with the hole

00:04:57.479 --> 00:05:00.800
push down with your finger.

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:04.319
Now you take the cage

00:05:04.319 --> 00:05:08.110
drop the cage in.

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:13.009
Push down hard. If you don't feel a little

00:05:13.009 --> 00:05:16.129
click.

00:05:16.129 --> 00:05:23.129
Take a punch with a flat side that's fairly wide. Push in.

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:26.269
Push and seat it until you feel the click.

00:05:26.269 --> 00:05:28.629
Now to re-seat this seat. 

00:05:28.629 --> 00:05:31.069
Just take the spring

00:05:31.069 --> 00:05:34.239
put the seat in like this.

00:05:34.239 --> 00:05:38.429
Turn the gun upside down.

00:05:38.429 --> 00:05:41.599
You'll feel it sit into the hole.

00:05:41.599 --> 00:05:43.599
Turn it back upright.

00:05:43.599 --> 00:05:46.150
Take the cap

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:53.150
thread it back on. 

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:00.620
Just snug it up so that

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:05.409
it's hand tight. It doesn't need to be over tight.

00:06:05.409 --> 00:06:07.549
When you're done

00:06:07.549 --> 00:06:09.860
your trigger is as good as new.

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:13.179
Just check to make sure that everything is still working.

00:06:13.179 --> 00:06:14.699
It's fine.

00:06:14.699 --> 00:06:16.879
You're good to go.

00:06:16.879 --> 00:06:18.969
Simple, easy,

00:06:18.969 --> 00:06:24.219
cure for any leaking gun.
