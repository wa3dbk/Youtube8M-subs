Hi I'm Chantelle from Telstra and today I'm
taking a look at the new Sony Xperia Z1 Compact.

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.930
With this new smartphone Sony have changed
the game for compact handsets.

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:17.500
This phone punches above its weight as a compact
phone.

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:23.200
It has all the features of its much bigger
predecessor, except squeezed into a much smaller body.

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:23.210
 

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:27.980
It may be small but it has all that you'd
expect from a high-end smartphone

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:31.960
It's beautifully crafted with a dust and water
resistant body, which is safe in fresh water

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:35.899
in up to 1.5 metres for up to 30 minutes

00:00:35.899 --> 00:00:40.309
It's packed with latest processor and technologies
that make this phone run smoothly

00:00:40.309 --> 00:00:45.600
It switches between apps easily, and makes
playing games much more fun

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.820
Sony has put some of the best of its technology
into this handset

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:52.730
The display comes from the same line as Sony's
high end TVs

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:58.039
and it creates incredibly natural, vivid colour
images and smooth motion when playing a video

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:05.300
Sony's experience in creating amazing cameras
mean that the Xperia Z1 Compact comes with a great camera for a compact phone

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:05.350
 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:11.830
The Sony G lens has a whopping 20.7 Megapixel
sensor, that uses fancy stacking technology,

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:15.210
to make each megapixel sharper while staying
compact

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:19.140
This means your photos and videos will be
stunning

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.120
One of the best things about this phone is
having a fully equipped smartphone that is

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:25.890
small enough to operate with a single hand

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.270
And don't forget to snap that selfie with
the dedicated camera button

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:34.880
The Sony Z1 compact is also rated Blue Tick,
which means you're able to enjoy the best

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:38.880
possible coverage experience that you can
get on the Telstra Mobile Network

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.200
whether you're in a regional area, country
town or off the beaten track

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:54.400
If you're keen to move over to the Xperia
Z1 compact, Sony makes it super easy to move from another Android or iPhone to this one with 'Xperia Transfer Mobile'

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:54.420
 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:00.200
You can directly transfer content from your
old device to your new one, without using a computer

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.290
 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:03.460
Take a look at the Sony Xperia Z1 Compact

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:06.770
It's compact without compromise and a phone
that's ready for you

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:10.590
