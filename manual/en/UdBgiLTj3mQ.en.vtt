00:00:01.699 --> 00:00:07.910
saudi arabia has just recently opened
the largest female only university and

00:00:07.910 --> 00:00:12.320
abt it's interesting it's it's a huge
facility it could educate fifty thousand

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:14.080
female students at a time

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.849
and it also has around the hospital a
teaching hospital

00:00:17.849 --> 00:00:19.330
laboratories in libraries

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:22.820
ania and i'm guessing it's agreat
high-tech

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:24.720
camp is for female students

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.970
the only problem is of course there's a
huge issue with segregation between

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:34.199
males and females are in saudi arabia
and also women and saudi arabia even

00:00:34.199 --> 00:00:37.640
though they're well educated they have a
very difficult time entering the

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:42.050
workforce for instance only fifteen
percent of the work force are women

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:44.020
so

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:47.730
does it make sense to open this campus
in does it make sense to spend all the

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:49.760
money on an all time

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:51.149
female institution

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:56.199
i think it does but you know there needs
to be reforms in the way that women are

00:00:56.199 --> 00:01:01.359
treated in in saudi arabia badin they
need to allow women to do more and

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:04.020
desegregation rule's been are just crazy

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:06.530
why are you going to spend the money
educating these women if you're not

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.990
going to allow them to put their
education to use

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.540
it sounds like recruits

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:13.409
at the driving

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:14.420
right of the world

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:15.470
standing up against the

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:20.130
the laws the bans against women dressed
okay so you have these two huge

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:22.430
differences initials like

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:26.230
donahue some began this there was
trouble these university assault like a

00:01:26.230 --> 00:01:27.580
progressive minded

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:29.979
organization a group or a group of
people who know

00:01:29.979 --> 00:01:32.909
as is going to me with his show change
the mindset

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:36.420
and the way things are all of the
starting point if you start with

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.640
society or if you start with the
education site

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:41.490
either way i like what they're doing
knows how they work

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:45.320
but maybe this will give them a attested
to to to see things differently fear

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:49.229
professor that no something coming out
of school what i'm not i'm hoping for is

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:54.420
that these women go get educated take
complete advantage out this great

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:55.180
institution

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:59.270
and then use your education to be an
activist you know fight four equality

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:04.120
fight for women's rights be able to and
to the work force and work with men and

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:08.100
it's crazy to me that they cannot work
because they can't be around men not

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:12.150
only that but they have to have like a
show farley camille chauffeur at all

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.610
times

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:17.050
they have to have unmanned with them
when they open a bank account you meant

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:20.080
to do everything to be able to function
in that society

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:24.240
and n it's depressing that you when it
comes to the work force you have to

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:28.150
desegregate you're not allowed to work
with men you're not allowed to interact

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:33.610
with men it's beyond stupid ok and it
i'm glad they're spending the money on

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:36.610
this institution i'm glad that they've
opened it up i'm glad these women have

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:40.370
an opportunity to become educated
because education i believe is

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:43.810
alternately something that can make you
a powerful individuals so it you know in

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:48.150
this case i hope that they use that
education to really push for

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:52.299
reforms in their society to make sure
that women are treated the same as mine

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:54.019
it's gonna be

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:57.059
but that mindset resume b

00:02:57.059 --> 00:02:58.939
and some things

00:02:58.939 --> 00:03:00.709
i think that case

00:03:00.709 --> 00:03:05.319
it nearly impossible to deny progress
and in this case i can think about the

00:03:05.319 --> 00:03:06.419
united states

00:03:06.419 --> 00:03:08.819
in this country women weren't even able
to vote

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:13.410
you know and and you know when you think
about adn gays in the military

00:03:13.410 --> 00:03:17.260
you know the intifada of having a debate
about allowing gays in the letter that

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:20.539
was just and her death you know twenty
years ago

00:03:20.539 --> 00:03:24.679
and our country progresses and there's
no way that you can stop it because

00:03:24.679 --> 00:03:28.379
people fight for what they believe and i
think that in saudi arabia and a lot of

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:31.149
countries in the middle east a similar
thing is going to happen we're going to

00:03:31.149 --> 00:03:34.899
see people who are going to more senior
right now people who are uprising people

00:03:34.899 --> 00:03:37.989
who are fighting for what they want

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:41.919
in saudi arabia i really hope that you
know the female population gets together

00:03:41.919 --> 00:03:44.509
and they fight for

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:47.449
equality and i think that's what they
deserve and that's what they need it

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:51.369
amazes me how educated these women are
and how much they're being held them

00:03:51.369 --> 00:03:52.230
theory

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:55.549
visiting isn't there's resistance even
from the powerful enemies of the way of

00:03:55.549 --> 00:03:56.270
life

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:57.499
right was

00:03:57.499 --> 00:03:59.580
study but the reason why i was going to
the date

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:01.259
g_o_p_ debate from yesterday

00:04:01.259 --> 00:04:03.419
and there was a point on on

00:04:03.419 --> 00:04:06.859
you know gay rights don't ask don't tell
us about them and ask them

00:04:06.859 --> 00:04:10.159
would you be willing to change the the
the law and not just change if you

00:04:10.159 --> 00:04:12.159
become president all of them

00:04:12.159 --> 00:04:15.469
virtually all of our thoughts holy
autorad not

00:04:15.469 --> 00:04:17.150
and so it's

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:21.000
because they still think that's what the
country wants in his bid for the last

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.699
group is holding on for dear life

00:04:22.699 --> 00:04:24.470
for hateful

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:25.770
faithful legislation

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:29.340
and it's going to happen there too it
seems that this is coming from a more

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:30.610
conservative forces

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:32.740
mhm as long as we are finding me

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:35.779
i love education partners of iraqi for
them

00:04:35.779 --> 00:04:39.240
for the metminco they might not be ready
now i mean i know that there are

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:43.339
definitely activists in saudi arabia
they've been fighting for equality

00:04:43.339 --> 00:04:45.849
between men and women for a while now

00:04:45.849 --> 00:04:49.550
but you know for them to really get
together and have an uprising so much

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:51.849
what we saw on egypt similar to that

00:04:51.849 --> 00:04:54.960
you know what we're seeing in live yet
the that i think that's going to take

00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:59.479
time whether or not they're ready for
that i'm not sure but i know without

00:04:59.479 --> 00:05:02.340
adopt that it will lead to that
especially when you give people the

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:03.069
power of education
