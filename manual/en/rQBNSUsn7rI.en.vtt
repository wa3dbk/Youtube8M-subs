00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.080
ok see, we are going to talk about this particular...uh...
amp here that is a matchless.

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:16.110
C30 reverb amp. there is something real special
about this amp.

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:21.740
because sometime...
when you are doing TV...well, how should I

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:22.740
say it??

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.750
Idont know whos amps these are, but
sometimes they will do tracks.

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:30.230
like, they will record tracks that are live
ahead of time, so they are technically "live",

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:37.210
but then they record the live band at the
studio, but they get to the actual tv part

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:39.090
of it.... and then they play the tracks that
they RECORDED live...

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.290
its kind of a trick live concept.

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.450
and that's what these amps are for.

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:54.530
check it out... see, the matchless settings?
the settings really don't matter.

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:58.340
a whole lot on this particular amp and Iwill
show you why in a minute...

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:07.620
the interesting part about these amps....is
whats on the backside.

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:14.420
hey... look at that..see...they are powered
up.

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:22.820
powere cable controls the led light on the
front.

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:33.229
as well as the matchless amp logo.
so these aamps are not actually being used

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:39.619
for live performances.

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:42.161
sometimes, that is how its done.

00:01:42.161 --> 00:01:52.110
not all the time, but once in a while
matchless c30 reverb, still a cool amp. even

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.260
the fake amp looks really nice doesn't it?
