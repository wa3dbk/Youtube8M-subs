00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:18.381
huygan has given a theory of wavefront propagation,
and in huygan’s theory, of propagation of

00:00:18.381 --> 00:00:39.840
light or wavefront propagation it was given
that, every point, of wavefront, in a light

00:00:39.840 --> 00:01:10.881
beam, act, as a source of, new disturbances,
in medium, or in surrounding, which are called,

00:01:10.881 --> 00:01:24.855
secondary wavelets. and here we can write,
these secondary wavelets, produce, their own

00:01:24.855 --> 00:01:27.760
spherical wavefronts, and, the common tangential,
plane of these wavefronts, give the next position,

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:31.101
of previous wavefront.

00:01:31.101 --> 00:01:46.030
this can be understood with the help of a
realistic situation, if this is considered

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:52.531
to be a light beam, and in this light beam
if say there’s a flat wavefront and here,

00:01:52.531 --> 00:01:58.820
if we consider, all points in, the flat wavefront
as, a point source of light then, as we know

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:04.741
every point source produces their own spherical
wavefronts, and every point source will produce

00:02:04.741 --> 00:02:08.891
spherical wavefront in forward direction.

00:02:08.891 --> 00:02:10.983
and all those points, on these spherical wavefronts
will also, be oscillating in same phase with

00:02:10.983 --> 00:02:14.122
a new common tangential plane of all these
spherical wavefronts here. and will also have

00:02:14.122 --> 00:02:33.531
all oscillations in same phase and this can
be azumed to be the next position of the previous

00:02:33.531 --> 00:02:34.531
wavefront. in the same manner here we can
see that the wavefront is propagating by,

00:02:34.531 --> 00:02:47.591
the common tangential plane, which is produced
by joining all the tangential points of individual

00:02:47.591 --> 00:02:48.591
spherical wavefronts.

00:02:48.591 --> 00:02:51.121
similar to this here we can explain, how convex
and concave wavefronts propagates, for the

00:02:51.121 --> 00:02:52.891
light beam which are diverging.

00:02:52.891 --> 00:03:02.110
every point on the wavefront is azumed to
be, a source of new small spherical wavefront

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:08.990
and a common tangential plane of these small
wavefronts, will be the next position of the

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.990
previous wavefront.

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:11.971
similarly here for, the converging beam for
concave wavefront, we can understand the same.
