00:00:02.708 --> 00:00:03.708
Sweet!

00:00:03.708 --> 00:00:06.558
Assassins Creed 4 Black Flag is going to be
released in October.

00:00:06.558 --> 00:00:07.558
Can’t wait for it!

00:00:07.558 --> 00:00:08.558
(sigh).

00:00:08.558 --> 00:00:10.548
I wish I could play it too.

00:00:10.548 --> 00:00:11.818
Of course you can.

00:00:11.818 --> 00:00:13.838
It’s not that expensive.

00:00:13.838 --> 00:00:15.398
It’s not the game.

00:00:15.398 --> 00:00:17.048
It’s my computer.

00:00:17.048 --> 00:00:19.288
What’s wrong with your computer?

00:00:19.288 --> 00:00:23.518
Well, the specs fall below the game’s recommended
system requirements.

00:00:23.518 --> 00:00:26.128
Oh, that’s a bummer.

00:00:26.128 --> 00:00:27.688
Is it an old PC?

00:00:27.688 --> 00:00:32.897
No, I bought it last year, but it is struggling
to cope with the latest games.

00:00:32.897 --> 00:00:34.998
It’s so frustrating.

00:00:34.998 --> 00:00:39.138
Even now, I get choppy performances when playing
Crysis 3.

00:00:39.138 --> 00:00:44.778
Bear in mind, my PC is running on a Core 2
Quad processor with 4GB memory.

00:00:44.778 --> 00:00:48.087
Dude, that’s like so three years ago.

00:00:48.087 --> 00:00:51.368
You should get a new PC and give this one
to your grandmother.

00:00:51.368 --> 00:00:57.368
I want to, believe me, but I’m afraid that
by next year, I’ll face the same problems

00:00:57.368 --> 00:00:58.368
again.

00:00:58.368 --> 00:01:02.308
I can’t be asking my parents for a new gaming
rig every year.

00:01:02.308 --> 00:01:06.907
If I could figure out a way to get the best
gaming setup for a 13 year old that would

00:01:06.907 --> 00:01:12.748
last for a good 3, 4 or even 5 years, I will
be a very happy boy indeed.

00:01:12.748 --> 00:01:16.248
In that case, I am going to make you a very
happy boy.

00:01:16.248 --> 00:01:17.248
Really?

00:01:17.248 --> 00:01:19.518
Can you help me to build a gaming rig?

00:01:19.518 --> 00:01:22.217
Only if you name your new PC after me.

00:01:22.217 --> 00:01:23.217
Deal.

00:01:23.217 --> 00:01:28.078
Now, to begin with, a PC can be divided into
seven major areas, in order of importance:

00:01:28.078 --> 00:01:34.187
the motherboard, processor, graphics card,
power supply, memory, hard drive and everything

00:01:34.187 --> 00:01:35.187
else.

00:01:35.187 --> 00:01:36.768
What’s a motherboard?

00:01:36.768 --> 00:01:41.288
A motherboard, or mainboard, is the foundation
of every computer.

00:01:41.288 --> 00:01:45.577
Essentially, it determines what type of components
you can fit into your PC.

00:01:45.577 --> 00:01:49.178
In addition, it also determines the scalability
of your system.

00:01:49.178 --> 00:01:50.178
Here’s a simple example.

00:01:50.178 --> 00:01:53.168
The maximum amount of memory your system can
have is dependent on how many DIMM sockets

00:01:53.168 --> 00:01:54.448
are available.

00:01:54.448 --> 00:02:00.158
If you have only 2 slots, and each only support
a 4GB RAM stick, then your system will only

00:02:00.158 --> 00:02:02.888
support a maximum of 8GB memory.

00:02:02.888 --> 00:02:08.738
On the other hand, if your motherboard has
4 DIMM slots, and each can take an 8GB stick,

00:02:08.738 --> 00:02:12.258
then your system memory can be expanded to
32GB.

00:02:12.258 --> 00:02:14.197
Holy cow! 32GB.

00:02:14.197 --> 00:02:15.878
That’s mind boggling.

00:02:15.878 --> 00:02:21.328
Yes, and your motherboard also determines
how future proof you system can be.

00:02:21.328 --> 00:02:25.688
If it supports the latest chipset, then you
can be assured that all new products in the

00:02:25.688 --> 00:02:28.708
next three to five years will support the
same standard.

00:02:28.708 --> 00:02:34.477
As such, I would recommend that you get a
motherboard with an Intel Z87 chipset.

00:02:34.477 --> 00:02:37.628
It has all the latest bells and whistles,
and has an integrated HD audio chip.

00:02:37.628 --> 00:02:38.628
Fantastic.

00:02:38.628 --> 00:02:39.628
Okay, let me write that down.

00:02:39.628 --> 00:02:40.628
Next, the processor.

00:02:40.628 --> 00:02:41.628
What do you recommend?

00:02:41.628 --> 00:02:42.628
Now, typically people rarely change the processor,
the brains of your PC.

00:02:42.628 --> 00:02:47.128
Conventional wisdom dictates that processors
and motherboards are the two constants in

00:02:47.128 --> 00:02:49.078
any system.

00:02:49.078 --> 00:02:52.928
So naturally, you once again go for the latest
design.

00:02:52.928 --> 00:02:57.038
In this case, a fourth generation Intel Core
i processor.

00:02:57.038 --> 00:03:03.438
If you can afford it, I would recommend the
Intel Core i7-4770K quad-core processor.

00:03:03.438 --> 00:03:08.908
It’s a beast, clocking in at a phenomenal
3.5 GHz.

00:03:08.908 --> 00:03:14.307
This processor also has an 8MB cache, a factor
often not considered by many.

00:03:14.307 --> 00:03:18.367
A larger cache will facilitate a faster data
processing rate.

00:03:18.367 --> 00:03:19.837
Right, got it.

00:03:19.837 --> 00:03:24.788
My birthday’s coming up, so I think I can
push for a slightly more expensive machine

00:03:24.788 --> 00:03:25.788
with my mother.

00:03:25.788 --> 00:03:27.478
Okay, mommy’s boy.

00:03:27.478 --> 00:03:30.118
Let’s move on to the graphics card.

00:03:30.118 --> 00:03:34.578
If you’re aiming for a five year system,
then your first card should last you between

00:03:34.578 --> 00:03:36.367
two to three years.

00:03:36.367 --> 00:03:43.018
In which case, I would strongly recommend
a card with a GeForce GTX760 chipset.

00:03:43.018 --> 00:03:48.018
It will come with inbuilt 2GB DDR5 memory
and a more effective heat management.

00:03:48.018 --> 00:03:52.238
Naturally, it will produce gorgeous graphics
that will set your heart racing.

00:03:52.238 --> 00:03:55.798
Oh man, you sound so sexy right now.

00:03:55.798 --> 00:03:58.318
If you were a girl, I would kiss you.

00:03:58.318 --> 00:04:00.138
(laughs) Whoa, man!

00:04:00.138 --> 00:04:02.618
Steady yourself, or I’m leaving your room!

00:04:02.618 --> 00:04:06.667
(laughs) I’ll try to control myself and
keep my hands off of you.

00:04:06.667 --> 00:04:07.667
Jeebus.

00:04:07.667 --> 00:04:10.768
Okay, next up, the power supply unit.

00:04:10.768 --> 00:04:15.078
With these three components, your machine
will be a power hungry beast.

00:04:15.078 --> 00:04:20.888
If you use a regular 450W power supply unit,
the machine will likely switch off after a

00:04:20.888 --> 00:04:23.648
few minutes – if it starts at all.

00:04:23.648 --> 00:04:29.298
So, you should be looking at a unit in the
range of 800W to 1,000W. These four items

00:04:29.298 --> 00:04:32.108
alone will likely set you back about a grand.

00:04:32.108 --> 00:04:34.888
Okay, I expected as much.

00:04:34.888 --> 00:04:36.097
What about the rest?

00:04:36.097 --> 00:04:38.228
Well, here's the clincher.

00:04:38.228 --> 00:04:41.048
The rest of the items won’t cost more than
$500.

00:04:41.048 --> 00:04:46.798
Moreover, in a year or two, you will have
the option of expanding your memory, the size

00:04:46.798 --> 00:04:50.768
of your hard drive, or even installing a second
graphics card.

00:04:50.768 --> 00:04:53.818
That’s the beauty of having a good foundation.

00:04:53.818 --> 00:04:55.488
Are you writing all of this down?

00:04:55.488 --> 00:04:57.798
Definitely man, definitely.

00:04:57.798 --> 00:04:59.608
I can’t wait for the weekend.

00:04:59.608 --> 00:05:03.038
I’m going with my mum to shop for my new
system.

00:05:03.038 --> 00:05:05.548
I hope you will help me assembling it.

00:05:05.548 --> 00:05:06.578
Yeah, sure.

00:05:06.578 --> 00:05:08.148
It’ll be fun.

00:05:08.148 --> 00:05:09.148
Great.

00:05:09.148 --> 00:05:11.508
Now take of your clothes and let’s make
out!

00:05:11.508 --> 00:05:12.367
Not funny dude, not funny.
