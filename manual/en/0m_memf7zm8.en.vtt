We will then show you how to create your own
personalized backup plan.

00:00:19.509 --> 00:00:24.939
To get started, use your hand held IOS device
to navigate to the Apple App store.

not using the app.

00:00:56.229 --> 00:00:58.930

computer app.

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:19.320

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:21.180
