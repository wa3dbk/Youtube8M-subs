00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.885
- Hey hey hey!

00:00:00.885 --> 00:00:03.486
Orange you glad it's time for
another episode of Ask Orange?

00:00:03.486 --> 00:00:05.018
In anticipation of the new episode,

00:00:05.018 --> 00:00:07.317
I bought 9,000 cases of TNT.

00:00:07.317 --> 00:00:09.035
I just don't know how
to use them the best.

00:00:09.035 --> 00:00:11.241
Perhaps you guys would have
a solution to this problem.

00:00:11.241 --> 00:00:12.890
- [Voiceover] Blow up the house.

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:13.818
- Okay!

00:00:13.818 --> 00:00:15.954
- No, I'm not letting this happen.

00:00:15.954 --> 00:00:16.930
Not again.

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:18.323
We're still cleaning up the kitchen

00:00:18.323 --> 00:00:20.064
from the last episode of Ask Orange.

00:00:20.064 --> 00:00:21.364
- But Pear.

00:00:21.364 --> 00:00:22.200
(laughs)

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:22.967
But Pear.

00:00:22.967 --> 00:00:25.103
- No. I'm not allowing it

00:00:25.103 --> 00:00:26.265
- Okay fine.

00:00:26.265 --> 00:00:28.261
- Good. I'm glad you're being reasonable.

00:00:28.261 --> 00:00:29.863
- Yeah, I won't blow up the house with

00:00:29.863 --> 00:00:31.256
9,000 cases of TNT,

00:00:31.256 --> 00:00:32.277
but you didn't say anything about

00:00:32.277 --> 00:00:35.784
not blowing up the house
with 9,001 cases of TNT.

00:00:35.784 --> 00:00:37.316
- No!

00:00:40.985 --> 00:00:43.139
- [Voiceover] It's time for Ask Orange.

00:00:43.726 --> 00:00:45.907
- You've got the questions,
I've got the answers.

00:00:45.907 --> 00:00:47.904
So gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme.

00:00:47.904 --> 00:00:49.019
- [Voiceover] Can you put Pear,

00:00:49.019 --> 00:00:50.388
Marshmallow, and Apple on your head?

00:00:50.388 --> 00:00:52.705
- Careful, careful.

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.868
- Oh this is a terrible idea.

00:00:55.868 --> 00:00:57.958
- Get us down from here.

00:00:57.958 --> 00:01:00.113
- Wheee!

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:01.923

00:01:02.834 --> 00:01:04.134
(group screams)

00:01:04.134 --> 00:01:06.270
- I think I bruised my butt.

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:07.803
- [Voiceover] Say "hi Paul."

00:01:07.803 --> 00:01:09.103
- Hi Paul.

00:01:09.103 --> 00:01:11.977
- [Voiceover] Dear Range,
do you have a crush?

00:01:12.075 --> 00:01:14.206
(crickets)

00:01:14.304 --> 00:01:16.395
- You do realize that this is Ask Orange,

00:01:16.395 --> 00:01:18.183
and not Ask Range, right?

00:01:18.183 --> 00:01:20.364
Silly Dorothy, ranges can't talk.

00:01:20.364 --> 00:01:20.713
(laughs)

00:01:20.713 --> 00:01:22.826

00:01:28.096 --> 00:01:32.201
♫ Pear, he likes art, Pear, gorilla fart.

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:33.902

Ahh! Why?

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:38.355
(laughs)

00:01:38.568 --> 00:01:39.498
- [Voiceover] Hey Orange.

00:01:39.498 --> 00:01:41.029
Why do your eyes move the same way?

00:01:41.029 --> 00:01:42.492
- Why whatever do you mean?

00:01:42.492 --> 00:01:45.186
Whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa.

00:01:45.186 --> 00:01:46.416
(laughs)

00:01:46.416 --> 00:01:48.507

Can you say a dirty lie?

00:01:48.507 --> 00:01:51.826

(laughs)

00:02:09.148 --> 00:02:10.564

00:02:20.619 --> 00:02:21.686
(laughs)

00:02:21.686 --> 00:02:23.220

00:02:33.087 --> 00:02:34.875
- ♫ Midget Apple, you are small.

00:02:34.875 --> 00:02:38.892
♫ Midget Apple is not tall.
Midget Apple if you fall

00:02:38.892 --> 00:02:40.680
You really don't have to worry because

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.467
you don't have far to fall, at all.

00:02:42.467 --> 00:02:43.559

song about a screaming rainbow?

00:03:12.375 --> 00:03:13.279
- Sure.

00:03:13.279 --> 00:03:16.090
This sounds like the perfect
opportunity for a theme song.

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:19.595
- [Voiceover] ♫ Look out in the sky,

00:03:19.595 --> 00:03:22.568
♫ I can go twice as high.

00:03:22.568 --> 00:03:25.376
♫ Take a look, beyond the brook,

00:03:25.376 --> 00:03:28.581

♫ He can scream everywhere.

00:03:33.642 --> 00:03:38.642
♫ In the snow, stub your
toe, is Screaming Rainbow.

00:03:40.075 --> 00:03:43.412
♫ He screams at everything.

00:03:44.882 --> 00:03:49.882
♫ Cows that moo, midgets

- I don't even know why I try.

00:04:16.413 --> 00:04:20.150
- Pick my nose. I pick, this one.

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:21.010
(laughs)

00:04:21.010 --> 00:04:22.450
Hey lookin' good!

00:04:25.725 --> 00:04:29.997
♫ Nobody knows the trouble I've seen.

00:04:29.997 --> 00:04:34.037
♫ Nobody knows, but my nose.

00:04:34.037 --> 00:04:35.681
(laughs)

00:04:35.709 --> 00:04:36.545
