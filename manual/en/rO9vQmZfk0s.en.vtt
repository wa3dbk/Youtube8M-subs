I can't take this... (referring to song lyrics:) Exactly!

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:58.680
What kind of reverse reality is this?

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.680
The best music you can hear is the rap music.

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:05.680

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:20.200
Why don't you go to Aruba or something?

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:22.140
Eh, get the hell outta here, this is my laundry

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:23.540
