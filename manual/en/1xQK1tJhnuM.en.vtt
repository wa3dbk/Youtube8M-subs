Hello friends! I'm excited to show you our
envelope paper today! This paper is fantastic,

00:00:04.499 --> 00:00:08.430
and it is a must-have addition to every crafter's collection!

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:13.110
This envelope paper is the same paper we use for our Stampin' Up! envelopes, so you know

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:18.519
it's superior quality. It is lightweight,
but still sturdy enough to make a great envelope.

00:00:18.519 --> 00:00:24.009
I love that the envelope paper is available
in our exclusive Stampin' Up! 2015-2017

00:00:24.009 --> 00:00:30.649
In-Color Collection. In this pack you get
two pages each of ten different designs. The

00:00:30.649 --> 00:00:35.200
colored envelope paper is double sided, so you don't even have to make a liner to go

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:39.010
with it if you don't want to! However, if
you want to dress up your envelope a little

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:43.180
bit more, this paper is perfect for layering,
so you can always add a liner of designer

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:48.440
series paper or foil paper inside the envelope. The envelope paper was designed specifically

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:53.490
to work with our envelope punch board, and you will love using these two products together.

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:58.920
The envelope paper is going to be easier to work with than the thick card stock, but it

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:05.920
will also make a much sturdier envelope than the Designer Series Paper. It punches, scores

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:18.130
and folds beautifully!
You are also going to have fun using this

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:28.010
paper with many of our other products, like the Big Shot and Thinlits Dies. Here's a

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:35.010
sample using the Mini Treat Bag Thinlits die. The envelope paper is much easier to manipulate

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:40.560
than the cardstock, but will still make a
nice strong bag so you won't have to worry

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.920
about it ripping or tearing.
And of course, you can always use the paper

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:50.770
to make beautiful accents for any of your
creative projects! Here's a sample where

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:54.400
we've used the In-Color paper to make some tiny envelope embellishments for this card.

00:01:54.400 --> 00:02:01.400
These are simple to make with the Simply Scored tool and Diagonal Plate.

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:15.360
Do this with any size, but I'm using a two
inch square. 

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:23.130
Score at 3/4" line. Turn that around and and then at 1". Do that all the way around alternating 3/4" and 1". 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:42.200
Clip the corners and then you have a perfect little tiny envelope. 

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:57.520
The possibilities for creativity are endless,

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:20.230
and your envelopes have never looked better! Visit our online store or contact your demonstrator

00:03:20.230 --> 00:03:27.230
to order your very own pack of envelope
paper.
