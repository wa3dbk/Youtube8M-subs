00:00:01.839 --> 00:00:06.179
Frank Wertheim, Extension Educator: "OK, so
once you've got your rigid PVC piping attached,

00:00:06.179 --> 00:00:13.130
you need these 1/2-inch PVC pipes that come
in ten-foot lengths. I usually cut one foot

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:19.030
off to make it a nine-footer, which gives
you just about the right height of the hoop

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:24.850
when you put it across your raised bed. Over
here, we have one that's already finished

00:00:24.850 --> 00:00:31.640
and ready to go. I've modified it with compost.
You can see these are a little bit different--these

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:39.820
are wider, it looks like a 1.5-inch PVC, and
then you've got a little bit wider pipe here,

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:47.230
so you can really adjust and use different
types of materials, whatever you have available.

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:53.860
"So now what I'm going to do is, I'm going
to attach channels to the outside board here

00:00:53.860 --> 00:01:00.239
that are going to hold the plastic in place.
I'm going to attach my channels. Again, I'm

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:07.109
going to leave a little gap here so it will
be enough room when I roll my sheet of plastic

00:01:07.109 --> 00:01:14.909
that it's going to fit into this groove. The
secret to holding the plastic in place once

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:20.039
you've got it tucked in is to have these turnbuckles,
so I'm just going to attach one sheetrock

00:01:20.039 --> 00:01:31.369
screw on the bottom end. Now you can put it
in the open position.

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:38.189
"So we've got our right-sized piece of plastic
with our batting strips stapled on, and I'm

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:43.709
just going to bring that down. I can roll
it up a little bit and tuck it into the channel,

00:01:43.709 --> 00:02:00.130
and we have our little mini greenhouse. At
the ends, I'm just going to tuck it in and

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:03.829
weigh it down with some rocks--actually some
bricks are a little bit heavier and would

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:09.509
probably work a little bit better, so the
wind doesn't take it.

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.980
"Early on in the season--let's say, early
April--as soon as you can get in here and

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:19.519
there's no more snow, get this on, and what
that will do is start warming the soil. With

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:24.700
season extension, not only is it important
to have an inside warm environment for the

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:30.280
plants, but you have to have the soil warm
up, too. So having this on about two weeks

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:37.129
and having it fully closed, before you put
your plants in there, will warm the soil up.

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:41.261
Then, later in the season, towards the end
of April, you've got your plants in there,

00:02:41.261 --> 00:02:47.609
and a sunny day like today, the sun is beating
really strong, it can actually get too hot

00:02:47.609 --> 00:02:54.609
in there with a closed-up system, so what
we're going to do is turn this into a little

00:02:54.609 --> 00:02:56.260
mini roll-up greenhouse.

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:04.420
"So what I'm going to use for my really high-tech
system here are these inexpensive hardware

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:22.430
clamps you get for about a dollar apiece,
and that's all there is to it. Before you

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:27.891
go to work in the morning, you have to sort
of judge what kind of day it's going to be,

00:03:27.891 --> 00:03:30.989
and if it's going to be a warm day, you want
to roll it you want to roll it up and get

00:03:30.989 --> 00:03:35.780
some kind of aeration going, and you can do
the same thing from the sides to get some

00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:37.730
kind of cross-ventilation."
