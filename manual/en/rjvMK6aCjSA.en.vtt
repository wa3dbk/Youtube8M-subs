00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:25.080
this is a replica of the Hearst Castle pool

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:27.220
Mrs B: Impressive

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:28.720
papa: Ahh, it should be

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.893
I believe that's the reason we are looking for a mortgage

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:32.800
Mrs B: Oh, that's so pretty

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:33.960
Papa: My...

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:35.920
The countess spent

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:39.280
the countess spent over 22 million dollars building this pool

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:41.800
Mrs B: Oh, you have a countess

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.760
Papa: yes, I do have a countess

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:44.720
papa: about a Mr Brown?

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:46.800
Is there a Mr Brown?

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.860
Mrs B: No, not anymore

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:50.714

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:52.920
Papa: So Mrs brown,

00:00:59.833 --> 00:01:03.113
Papa: so anyway, this is our pool- see the angels?

00:01:03.113 --> 00:01:05.153

00:01:08.642 --> 00:01:09.982

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.160
but I don't know why she built it because

00:01:19.512 --> 00:01:22.872
You know, we as skeletons don't go in the pool

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.120

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.880

00:02:41.499 --> 00:02:45.079
so they don't cost anything because they don't eat (laugh)

00:02:45.079 --> 00:02:46.219

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:34.100
Papa: oh, we done a music video in this room

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:35.420

00:03:35.420 --> 00:03:36.940
Papa: have you seen any of our music videos?

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:37.920
Mrs B- No...

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:39.380
Papa: The Calavera Skeleton Band

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:42.140

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:44.020

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:46.320
Mrs B: well, I'll have to check that out 

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:47.980
papa: yes and you know...

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:49.860
ahhmm...

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:53.120
actually this is

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.200
all the stuff that she had...

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:57.120
all her utensils, the basin

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:01.180
the bars on the window, she looked out that window

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.980
before that fateful morning 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:06.440
she could see the scaffold being built...

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:08.180
from that window

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:11.100
as a matter of fact

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:15.540
we have seen Marie Antoinette come through our portal

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:21.640
we tried to ask her if she wanted to be

00:04:21.640 --> 00:04:24.160
one of our ghosts, get her a skeleton

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:26.680
but ah.. she won't talk to us

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:30.360
sometimes she just carries her head...

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:31.120
so...

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:33.800
you know I think she is still traumatized

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:34.920
by this whole...

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:36.280
guillotine thing...

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:37.460
Mrs B: Oh Count Calavera!

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:37.960
please...

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:39.360
Bonehead appears:  One!

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:40.240

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:41.420
