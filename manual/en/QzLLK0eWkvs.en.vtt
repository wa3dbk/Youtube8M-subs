00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:09.780
Today we prepare the Chocolate profiterol, these are the ingredients:

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:11.275
cream puffs

00:00:11.275 --> 00:00:12.315
sugar

00:00:12.315 --> 00:00:13.735
milk

00:00:13.735 --> 00:00:15.335
dark chocolate

00:00:15.335 --> 00:00:16.375
eggs

00:00:16.375 --> 00:00:18.049
potato flour

00:00:18.049 --> 00:00:19.775
whipping cream

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:23.340
because I chose to fill cream puffs with whipped cream

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.660
cinnamon and rum for to flavoring

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:32.220
a pastry bag and a kitchen claps to make profiterol

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:35.800
first put to boil milk

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:45.140
while the milk boils, put the sugar in a bowl

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:49.840
add the potato starch

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:58.840
a pinch of cinnamon and whish

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:09.340
then add the eggs

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.340
whisk well

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:32.000
when the mixture and mixed well

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.000
while the milk continues to heat up

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:36.540
whip the cream to fill the cream puffs

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:42.760
for whipping cream, I advise you not to put it all together

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:46.500
started with one half

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.540
add sugar

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:57.480
to taste, I advise you not to overdo it

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:02.100
then when it thickens

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.000
add the remaining cream

00:02:17.494 --> 00:02:19.614
do not overdo it in whipping cream

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.900
otherwise it will unmount faster

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.360
now filled cream puffs

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:51.340
puncture them under

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.220
try not make get out the cream

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.600
otherwise will dirty all the chocolate

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:08.520
filled the amount of cream puffs that you considerer sufficient

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:12.520
let the cream still in the pastry bag, if necessary, will be a moment to fill still cream puffs

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:19.760
the milk bubbles, close the fire

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:24.260
and pour in the mixture previously prepared

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:30.860
stir well

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:42.800
if this cream is too liquid

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:48.900
let it thicken putting it back on the heat for a couple of minutes

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:05.120
when it starts to have a velvety texture, close the heat and add the chocolate

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:13.580
mix well

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.620
add the rum

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:32.980
and go and mount the profiterol

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:39.440
put a little chocolate on the plate

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:42.520
so as to adhere well the cream puffs

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:12.020
I used a round plate, but you can use any type of dish

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:34.520
with a spoon, put the chocolate where you take the cream puffs with kitchen clamps in order to cover all

00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:42.520
Once the chocolate is completely cool

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:46.840
decorated with cream

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:02.960
making the flakes between a cream puff and the other

00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:13.440
do not overdo it

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:15.380
profiterol the chocolate is ready

00:06:16.240 --> 00:06:18.840
