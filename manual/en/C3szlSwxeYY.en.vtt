00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.466
- Welcome back to "What's Inside?"

00:00:01.466 --> 00:00:03.467
I'm Lincoln and this is Dan.

00:00:03.467 --> 00:00:04.823
- And today we're going to cut open

00:00:04.823 --> 00:00:06.966
this beautiful Brunswick Bowling Pin.

00:00:06.966 --> 00:00:10.499
This is an official U.S.B.C. approved

00:00:10.499 --> 00:00:12.058
plastic coated bowling pin.

00:00:12.058 --> 00:00:14.403
It has a little bit of wood,
and a hole in the bottom,

00:00:14.403 --> 00:00:16.605
and some plastic on it.

00:00:16.605 --> 00:00:18.935
I'm wondering if it's going
to be just full of wood,

00:00:18.935 --> 00:00:20.788
when I read online, it
looks like some of them

00:00:20.788 --> 00:00:22.761
are filled with, possibly,
rocks and bricks,

00:00:22.761 --> 00:00:25.803
but we cut open this bowling
ball a few months back,

00:00:25.803 --> 00:00:29.053
so it's just natural that we
cut open a bowling pin now.

00:00:29.053 --> 00:00:31.004
But before we do that, we're going to

00:00:31.004 --> 00:00:33.209
have a little fun with
it and see if we can bowl

00:00:33.209 --> 00:00:36.274
the bowling ball and hit this one pin.

00:00:36.274 --> 00:00:38.782
It sounds pretty easy to
hit just one pin in bowling,

00:00:38.782 --> 00:00:41.475
but when you're bowling
with half of a bowling ball

00:00:41.475 --> 00:00:43.088
it's going to be a little tricky.

00:00:45.688 --> 00:00:47.228
- [Lincoln] Oh!

00:00:50.881 --> 00:00:53.771
(cheering)

00:00:57.584 --> 00:01:01.444
- [Dan] Oh! You got it with
the ball part too, nice job.

00:01:09.146 --> 00:01:11.369
(yelling)

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.370
- [Dan] Don't try to
catch that, it's heavy.

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.048
- [Lincoln] It's good!

00:01:20.052 --> 00:01:21.529
- We've proven that you can bowl a strike

00:01:21.529 --> 00:01:24.199
with half of a bowling
ball and one bowling pin.

00:01:24.199 --> 00:01:25.599
I know it doesn't sound like that

00:01:25.599 --> 00:01:26.672
amazing of an accomplishment,

00:01:26.672 --> 00:01:28.894
but it was actually kind of
hard, and really fun to do.

00:01:28.894 --> 00:01:31.014
Lincoln, what do you think is
going to be inside of this?

00:01:31.014 --> 00:01:32.620
- I think there's going to be wood

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:34.533
all the way through, like dark wood.

00:01:34.533 --> 00:01:35.883
- I think there's going to be something

00:01:35.883 --> 00:01:37.632
else inside of it that's heavier,

00:01:37.632 --> 00:01:40.441
because this bowling pin feels very heavy.

00:01:40.441 --> 00:01:42.717
It's very well made, very well balanced.

00:01:42.717 --> 00:01:45.067
I'm just going to cut it
right down the middle here,

00:01:45.067 --> 00:01:46.692
it might take a couple of directions

00:01:46.692 --> 00:01:48.978
that we have to go on
it, but this will be fun.

00:01:49.658 --> 00:01:54.648
(saw noise)

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:10.860
- [Lincoln] We've
discovered it's... sawdust.

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:12.083
(Giggles)

00:02:12.083 --> 00:02:13.732
- [Dan] That's funny.

00:02:13.732 --> 00:02:16.333
Yeah, that's making a mess,
that's filling up that bag.

00:02:16.333 --> 00:02:18.007
- [Lincoln] It is?

00:02:18.007 --> 00:02:20.152
- [Dan] Sawdust everywhere.
- [Lincoln] Oh yeah.

00:02:20.152 --> 00:02:21.445
- [Lincoln] And look, look at this.

00:02:21.445 --> 00:02:22.962
When we did the shot-put ball,

00:02:22.962 --> 00:02:26.012
this thing burnt a hole right through it,

00:02:26.012 --> 00:02:29.096
and it's all, like, sticking out of it.

00:02:29.096 --> 00:02:31.190
- [Dan] Yeah, our bag is not
that effective anymore after

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:34.154
that shot-put ball
burned a hole in our bag.

00:02:34.154 --> 00:02:36.674
- [Lincoln] It was a lot of sparks.

00:02:36.674 --> 00:02:41.453
(saw noises)

00:02:49.621 --> 00:02:51.358
- [Dan] Alright, Lincoln, come on over.

00:02:51.358 --> 00:02:53.610
I think we did it. You ready?

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.189
- [Lincoln] Yes, yes, yes!

00:02:55.189 --> 00:02:56.838
- [Dan] Okay, let's
see. You take one side,

00:02:56.838 --> 00:02:58.208
I'll take the other. Go ahead.

00:02:58.208 --> 00:03:02.155
Oh! Maybe it's not quite there.

00:03:06.655 --> 00:03:08.632
- We could do like we did
on the bowling ball video

00:03:08.632 --> 00:03:09.864
and drop it on the ground.

00:03:09.864 --> 00:03:13.234
- [Lincoln] Yeah! We
got it, we got it. Whoa!

00:03:13.626 --> 00:03:15.749
- [Dan] So take a look
at it, it is pure wood.

00:03:15.749 --> 00:03:17.944
It has a little hole at
the bottom, that must be

00:03:17.944 --> 00:03:20.266
I mean that was the hole that
we already saw at the bottom,

00:03:20.266 --> 00:03:22.635
it must be some sort of
contraption that helps it

00:03:22.635 --> 00:03:24.843
get on the lanes properly
and for them to grab it.

00:03:24.843 --> 00:03:26.858
But you can see a thin plastic coat

00:03:26.858 --> 00:03:31.091
that goes all around it, and
then it's just wood inside.

00:03:32.531 --> 00:03:35.098
It's a beautiful bowling pin.

00:03:35.098 --> 00:03:36.195
- Even when it's cut open.

00:03:36.195 --> 00:03:38.215
Mystery solved!

00:03:38.215 --> 00:03:41.158
- There we go, that's what's
inside of a bowling pin.

00:03:41.158 --> 00:03:43.087
Thanks for that mess, Lincoln.

00:03:43.087 --> 00:03:45.197
But, thank you so much for subscribing

00:03:45.197 --> 00:03:46.740
and for watching our videos,

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:48.095
we appreciate all of the comments

00:03:48.095 --> 00:03:49.896
that you guys give that give us ideas

00:03:49.896 --> 00:03:52.511
for things to cut open,
just like this bowling pin.

00:03:52.511 --> 00:03:55.571
- Thanks for watching, until
next time (weird noise).

00:03:56.881 --> 00:03:58.821
- [Voiceover] What was that?
