00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:05.509
Peugeot has a rich heritage when it comes
to to medium-sized hot hatchbacks. It's not

00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:12.789
just about the 205 GTi, you know. Remember
the 309 GTi? The 306 Rallye, the 306 GTi6

00:00:12.789 --> 00:00:19.510
- all cracking hot hatchbacks. Now, it's the
turn of the 308 and this is the GT. You'll

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:23.320
notice there's a letter missing on the end
there - no 'i' - more about that later. Under

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:29.770
the bonnet of this petrol version is a 202bhp
1.6-litre turbocharged motor. Not as much

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:34.820
power as you'd expect from a Golf GTI or a
SEAT Leon these days, so this is more warm

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:39.680
than hot. But, Peugeot's designers have done
a very good job of giving this car some pizazz.

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:44.870
You'll notice the Peugeot lion has slipped
off the bonnet onto this three-bar grille,

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:50.380
there are full LED headlamps, these lovely
indicators that scroll from the inside outwards.

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:55.780
Down the side you've got slight sill extensions,
some 18-inch alloys. At the back, twin exhausts

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:01.860
and a black lacquered diffuser and as you'd
expect, there's been a bit of a makeover inside,

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:10.149
too. Now, as you'd expect from any sporty
hatch, there's lots of red stitching all over

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:14.560
the dash, on the steering wheel, and on the
seats. Not overdone, quite tasteful. You've

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:19.709
got leather or Alcantara seats, you've got
a chrome gear knob, you've got anthracite

00:01:19.709 --> 00:01:25.549
on the roof lining and down the pillars, and
you've got i-cockpit. Yes, it's not any old

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:29.740
cockpit - it's amazing what happens when you
put an 'i' in front of a word - it's an i-cockpit

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:35.700
which is Peugeot's small steering wheel - slightly
beefier in this 308 GT - and high set instruments.

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:40.279
Some people have problems with this setup,
saying they can't see all of the dials. Personally,

00:01:40.279 --> 00:01:46.520
I quite like - don't have a problem. Quality-wise,
it's a mixed bag. Some really nice touchy-feely

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:52.509
stuff, squishy plastics around the cabin,
but a bit further down some cheap stuff. Matter

00:01:52.509 --> 00:01:59.590
not, what does matter is what happens when
you press this starter button. That 1.6-litre

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:06.280
twin-turbo engine provides plenty of zip,
getting the GT from 0-62mph in 7.5 seconds.

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.950
Back in the day, that would have been more
than acceptable, but with the similarly-priced

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:15.931
Ford Focus ST knocking nearly a second off
that time, the 308 looks a little tardy. It's

00:02:15.931 --> 00:02:20.290
still fun, though, especially if you hit the
sport button. The dials turn red, the steering

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:24.730
and throttle responses sharpen and the engine
note changes. It may be a synthetic noise

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:29.319
plugged through the speakers, but in the petrol
version it adds a real touch of excitement.

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:34.849
Diesels get the same treatment, but the automated
sound isn't quite as thrilling. Sadly, the

00:02:34.849 --> 00:02:40.629
handling isn't exactly exciting. Safe, yes.
Predictable, yes. But lacking much feel and

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:45.989
lacking front end grip, too. The ride's comfy,
though, highlighting the car's ability as

00:02:45.989 --> 00:02:52.390
a cruiser rather than a true hot hatch. Or
hot estate. The 308 SW has also had the GT

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:56.590
treatment, offering impressive practicality
in the boot, if not much more space in the

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:02.989
back, which is a bit tighter than some of
its rivals. So, the 308 GT. Well, first things

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:07.690
first, it's not a hot hatchback. It doesn't
quite have the performance or the feel of

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:13.049
a hot hatchback, but as a range topper with
loads of equipment and a bit of punch and

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:18.959
a really interesting engine note (even if
it is synthetic), I quite like it. However,

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:24.409
not far away, that letter 'i' is about to
return. I've already mentioned it a couple

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:28.859
of times. The Peugeot 308 GTi is due at the
end of the year. It'll probably have a very

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:36.560
different attitude to this, but given Peugeot's
rich heritage in all hot hatchbacks, I can't

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:42.219
wait. Want to see some rivals to the Peugeot
