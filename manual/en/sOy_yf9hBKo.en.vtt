Hello my name is Chris Conklin on behalf of
expertvillage.com. Nighttime shots, those

00:00:15.579 --> 00:00:20.730
can be very interesting, though typically
they are going to require you to manually

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:26.390
set to give you a longer shutter speed openings,
so that lets more light in. If you take the

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:31.079
speed too fast like in a daylight it is going
to take the shutter open it and close it real

00:00:31.079 --> 00:00:35.780
quickly while at nighttime shot dependent
upon what you are looking for. It can open

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:41.930
this the lens and then keep it open for a
while several minutes you can leave it open

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:47.629
almost indefinitely and then it finally closes,
capturing all the specific little elements

00:00:47.629 --> 00:00:51.149
of the light that you are looking for especially
if you are looking at the moon, the stars,

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:57.340
far distance or just some kind of a glow effect.
A lot of people will use this for special

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:02.850
effects like sitting on a on overpass, on
a freeway and allow the of lights of the cars

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:07.700
to go by and that is where you see that streaming
or that ghosting effect if you will of the

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:14.640
cars and the lights as they are coming to
or from away from him. Nighttime landscapes

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.570
of city lights that is also another very popular
feature of nighttime shooting and using the

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:25.530
particular types of setting that go with that.
Now, the important thing to remember is always

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:31.040
play with your settings before you are ready
to shoot. Make sure that you have taken several

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.360
snapshots, you have looked at them, you have
compared them and you have gotten exactly

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:38.220
what it is you are looking for. After you
have already shot through the picture, it

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:44.500
is not the time to find out that you have
your settings off center or your lighting

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:49.090
is not working for you. Yes, it is possible
that you can do a lot of corrections with

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:53.560
a call and post or editing to correct a lot
of those, but I am going to tell you it is

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:58.740
a lot easier to do a little front end maintenance
and management upfront and then have to just

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.740
correct a little detail it any on the back
end when you are done with your pictures.
