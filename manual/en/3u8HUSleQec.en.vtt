00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.560
In the Bay of Plenty.

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:09.480
Okeroa Douglas (18) of
Ngati Whakaue was killed recently.

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:15.400
She was a successful athlete
and an ambitious young woman.

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:23.360
The pain.

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:28.680
How do you ease the pain?

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.680
How do you beg for her back?

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:34.640
Emotions turn to anger.

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.120
Then you are screaming,
give my baby back!

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.160
She was an accomplished athlete.

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.600
She was a Bay of Plenty
representative in basketball,

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.320
tennis, touch rugby and hockey.

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:50.200
We meet her last year,

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:55.480
when she went to Fiji as a member
of the NZ Maori Women's team.

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.120
I started playing when
I was about six years old.

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.520
She told us her dreams.

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:10.680
One of my dreams is to
make the NZ Women's team.

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:15.640
But it is a dream that
will never be realised.

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.800
A car accident just outside
of Rotorua on SH5

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:22.520
claimed her before her time.

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.840
She leaves her family
and a grieving community.

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.880
The flow of scattered emotions
will not quickly subside.

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:37.280
I will never forget her, she will
always be close to my heart.

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:40.520
It is a waste of her life.

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:44.640
I feel for her family,
what else can I say?

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:47.520
What a waste of a
beautiful young girl

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.720
that embraced the ways
of our ancestors.

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:54.640
She was a beautiful flower
picked from the garden of Te Arawa.

00:01:54.640 --> 00:02:00.440
Now we, of Te Arawa and
the nation, bid her farewell.

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:11.320
Even though she goes
to her ancestors

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:14.880
she stays in the memories
of those who remain.

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:16.960
Heta Gardiner, Te Karere.
