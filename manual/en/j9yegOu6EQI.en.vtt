a.k.a. Graph Board.

00:00:06.233 --> 00:00:11.733
Part 4: Graphing an inequality
using the boundary line: y=(1/2)x+3

00:00:11.733 --> 00:00:13.633
Presented by Susan Osterhaus,

00:00:13.633 --> 00:00:17.033
a Texas School for the Blind and Visually Impaired
Outreach Math Consultant.

00:00:17.033 --> 00:00:24.500
Now, the next thing people ask about is,
"Well, how do I graph an inequality?"

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:29.433
Now, as far as graphing an inequality,
we start again with a boundary line,

00:00:29.433 --> 00:00:35.900
and we're gonna graph y is less than (1/2)x+3.

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:39.200
So, if this is y=(1/2)x+3,

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.600
and notice I'm not gonna graph this
completely over.

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.233
I'm being lazy. Okay.
And I let my students do this, as well.

00:00:45.233 --> 00:00:49.500
And now what we're saying is
we're not considering the points on this line.

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:54.733
We only want to know about the points
that are actually lying under this line.

00:00:54.733 --> 00:00:58.433
So, this is... This may be difficult
just because there are so many points.

00:00:58.433 --> 00:01:04.100
But what I tell them to do
is take off the rubber,

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:08.733
and now this kind of looks like
a dashed or dotted line,

00:01:08.733 --> 00:01:12.300
which means none of these points
are really included.

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:16.667
And at this point, if I'm showing
y is less than (1/2)x+3,

00:01:16.667 --> 00:01:23.033
I'm talking about all of these points down here
and, infinitely, many points going off the frame.

00:01:23.033 --> 00:01:27.400
But for right now, we're talking about shading
all of these in.

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:30.233
And if I would've left them,
they could color all these in

00:01:30.233 --> 00:01:34.467
and say they had just graphed
y is less than (1/2)x+3.

00:01:34.467 --> 00:01:37.467
But I'm not going to let them color
all over my graph board.

00:01:37.467 --> 00:01:41.300
So, instead I just tell them
to go ahead and put their hand

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:44.867
on that portion of the graph
that would be shaded

00:01:44.867 --> 00:01:47.567
as opposed to this portion up here.

00:01:47.567 --> 00:01:48.600
So, there's only...

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.500
We've divided the graph board
into two parts, not two equal parts.

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:53.700
We've just graphed...

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.567
We've just divided it into two parts:
the upper part and the lower part

00:01:57.567 --> 00:02:02.225
In this case, y is less than (1/2)x+3"
would be down here.

00:02:02.225 --> 00:02:07.165
So, all they have to do is like this,
show me the graph board and I'd say, "Great."

00:02:07.165 --> 00:02:09.100
Now, we took the rubber band off

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:12.700
because none of these points
were supposed to be on the graph.

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:18.600
Sometimes we actually want to include
all of these points, which are called...

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.067
This is called the boundary line.

00:02:21.067 --> 00:02:23.700
So if we want to include all those points,

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:29.100
we put that back on and we say that we...

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.600
If the student would put their hand this way,

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:38.667
we could say that they have graphed
y is less than or equal to (1/2)x+3.

00:02:38.667 --> 00:02:40.633
You noticed I added the equal part.

00:02:40.633 --> 00:02:45.367
As soon as you add the equal part,
it includes all of these points.

00:02:45.367 --> 00:02:49.067
I'm gonna change the equation slightly,
or the inequality, excuse me,

00:02:49.067 --> 00:02:53.967
and say y is greater than or equal to (1/2)x+3.

00:02:53.967 --> 00:02:57.267
In that case the students
would put their arm on this side

00:02:57.267 --> 00:03:01.585
and indicate that it's all of these points
and what's above

00:03:01.585 --> 00:03:03.502
is what's in the solution set.

00:03:03.502 --> 00:03:06.867
And again, all we do
is take the rubber band on or off,

00:03:06.867 --> 00:03:10.000
tells us whether those points
are included or not.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.067
Having the equal in there,
along with the less than or greater than,

00:03:14.067 --> 00:03:16.867
makes all of these points included.

00:03:16.867 --> 00:03:20.567
Now, let's suppose that you have somebody
who doesn't want to put their arm there,

00:03:20.567 --> 00:03:25.033
or you want to take that digital picture
that we were talking about.

00:03:25.033 --> 00:03:28.100
In that case you would need to do
something like this.

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:32.467
Grab whatever is at hand,
and if you wanted the shading to be up here,

00:03:32.467 --> 00:03:36.700
you could just put that piece of paper there
or whatever else you might have.

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:40.467
Or if it was y is less than or equal to (1/2)x+3,

00:03:40.467 --> 00:03:43.467
you could put the paper there
and say, "That's my shading."

00:03:43.467 --> 00:03:48.600
Now, some students just love pushpins so much
that they might want to do it this way.

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.800
I've seen some students do it this way.

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:55.400
Let's say that they wanted to shade above,
then they would just put lots of pushpins.

00:03:55.400 --> 00:04:00.867
Notice how many pushpins this takes,
and to me this slows the procedure down.

00:04:00.867 --> 00:04:04.667
But some students just really loved this so much,

00:04:04.667 --> 00:04:08.500
they just think it's so fascinating
that they want to spend all this time

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:11.266
and make the best digital picture
that was ever made.

00:04:11.266 --> 00:04:14.467
And I'm talking about totally blind students.

00:04:14.467 --> 00:04:16.200
Along with... Along with low-vision students.

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:20.200
So, they might want to do,
just put all kinds of pushpins up here

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:23.733
and tell me that that's the shading.

00:04:23.733 --> 00:04:27.333
Again, just putting the hand there
is fast and quick for me,

00:04:27.333 --> 00:04:32.067
but if they want that digital picture,
they might want to do it that way or again.

00:04:32.067 --> 00:04:35.900
As far as I'm concerned,
and most math teachers would say the same thing,

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:38.631
that little piece of paper
or whatever you want to show

00:04:38.631 --> 00:04:40.834
that that's where the shading is, it's just fine.

00:04:40.834 --> 00:04:44.367
But if you have students who just think
this is more beautiful, you know,

00:04:44.367 --> 00:04:47.267
hey, it's okay for math to be beautiful.

00:04:47.267 --> 00:04:52.167
So, again, what we've just shown you
is the graph of,

00:04:52.167 --> 00:04:57.433
in this particular case,
y is greater than or equal to (1/2)x+3.

00:04:57.433 --> 00:05:01.433
And if we took the rubber bands off,

00:05:01.433 --> 00:05:05.801
we would now have y is greater than (1/2)x+3.

00:05:05.801 --> 00:05:07.867
And boy, by this time, it's starting to...

00:05:07.867 --> 00:05:10.412
It's starting to be hard to tell
where whatever is.

00:05:10.412 --> 00:05:13.310
Except that looks pretty straight still to me.

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:16.014
So it does not include
those particular boundary points

00:05:16.014 --> 00:05:18.999
but everything above.

00:05:18.999 --> 00:05:20.999
