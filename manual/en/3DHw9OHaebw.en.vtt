00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.075
[music]

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:10.075
[laughing]

00:00:10.076 --> 00:00:13.806
He's known from Japan to
Hickabo, Texas down there.

00:00:13.833 --> 00:00:15.781
If you hunt and fish in Texas,

00:00:16.215 --> 00:00:17.716
you run across Ray Murski.

00:00:17.833 --> 00:00:19.833
And if you shoot Remington shotguns

00:00:19.888 --> 00:00:21.253
you run across him probably quicker,

00:00:21.333 --> 00:00:23.856
and you use Strike King Baits you
probably run across him quicker

00:00:23.866 --> 00:00:26.466
than most people, but he's just
a fixture in the industry.

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:28.070
He is the industry.

00:00:28.071 --> 00:00:31.498
Ray Murski would give you
the shirt off his back.

00:00:31.533 --> 00:00:34.533
Now it wouldn't fit, but
he'd give it to you anyway.

00:00:35.363 --> 00:00:39.833
RAY MURSKI BEGAN HIS FISHING
CAREER AS A YOUNG MAN CATCHING

00:00:39.835 --> 00:00:42.860
FRESHWATER DRUM TO SELL IN
HIS FATHER'S GROCERY STORE

00:00:42.868 --> 00:00:44.735
IN BRENHAM, TEXAS.

00:00:45.078 --> 00:00:47.598
Back that day and time
they were Gasper Goos.

00:00:48.115 --> 00:00:51.901
And we would go to the Brazos
River every Sunday after church

00:00:51.903 --> 00:00:56.723
and just literally fill two
or three igloo ice chests

00:00:56.835 --> 00:00:58.535
full of fish.

00:00:58.536 --> 00:01:00.960
And I mean it was just a way of life.

00:01:01.201 --> 00:01:03.696
Of course he's Catholic and
then the fish they didn't sell

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:06.900
they would eat on Friday and
he wound up hating fish

00:01:07.081 --> 00:01:08.033
as a result of that.

00:01:08.568 --> 00:01:11.971
And he was in college apparently
when the Pope said Catholics

00:01:11.973 --> 00:01:14.535
didn't have to eat fish on Friday's
anymore and it was the happiest

00:01:14.568 --> 00:01:15.598
day of his life.

00:01:15.603 --> 00:01:18.278
BUT HE STILL LOVED TO FISH.

00:01:18.336 --> 00:01:20.813
AND AFTER FINISHING COLLEGE
WITH A BUSINESS DEGREE AND

00:01:20.815 --> 00:01:24.383
SERVING THREE YEARS IN THE ARMY,
THE OPEN WATERS OF TEXAS

00:01:24.403 --> 00:01:25.285
AWAITED HIM.

00:01:25.303 --> 00:01:28.988
I can remember my dad bringing
home a Hawaiian Wiggler.

00:01:29.836 --> 00:01:32.111
And I said 'Dad, you can't catch
fish with an artificial bait.'

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:33.110
We caught

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:35.525
maybe 20 bass

00:01:36.221 --> 00:01:37.893
between three and five pounds and

00:01:38.451 --> 00:01:39.171
I couldn't believe it.

00:01:40.053 --> 00:01:42.538
Anyway that's what really got me
started thinking about bass fishing.

00:01:43.235 --> 00:01:47.298
THAT THOUGHT CARRIED RAY
THROUGH 40 B.A.S.S. TOURNAMENTS

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:52.211
STARTING WITH THE FIRST ONE ON
ARKANSAS' BEAVER LAKE IN 1967.

00:01:52.436 --> 00:01:58.518
The four of us, Dance, Blake
and John and myself, we

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.020
finished one, two, three and
four in this tournament, and

00:02:01.038 --> 00:02:02.993
that was Ray Scott
giving us the awards.

00:02:02.996 --> 00:02:07.138
RAY FISHED PROFESSIONALLY FOR
FIVE YEARS AND IN 1972 WAS

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:11.531
LISTED 9TH ON THE B.A.S.S.
ALL-TIME MONEY WINNING LIST.

00:02:11.748 --> 00:02:12.630
AT THE SAME TIME,

00:02:12.931 --> 00:02:15.603
HE WAS GETTING HIS FOOT IN
THE DOOR SELLING LURES.

00:02:15.951 --> 00:02:18.203
I owned an outdoor newspaper.

00:02:18.505 --> 00:02:21.841
But what I learned a lot about
the sporting goods business

00:02:21.885 --> 00:02:24.443
was when I was selling
newspaper ads.

00:02:24.505 --> 00:02:27.380
But you really didn't have
to know a lot about lures

00:02:27.381 --> 00:02:30.550
at the time because if it would
catch fish, you could sell it to

00:02:30.571 --> 00:02:31.343
anybody.

00:02:31.345 --> 00:02:32.938
A BUSINESS MAN FIRST,

00:02:33.205 --> 00:02:36.340
RAY LEARNED TO USE THE
MEDIA TO PUSH HIS PRODUCT.

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:39.028
Maybe he wants to tell me
something I wrote that he likes,

00:02:39.031 --> 00:02:41.353
maybe he wants to tell me something
I wrote that he didn't like,

00:02:41.725 --> 00:02:45.298
maybe he wants to tell me about a
product, but I know the energy level

00:02:45.373 --> 00:02:48.503
is fixing to go up when I hear 'Hey
Buck,' on the other end of the line.

00:02:48.505 --> 00:02:49.550
IN 1984,

00:02:49.875 --> 00:02:52.938
RAY BECAME THE OWNER OF THE
BLISS-MURSKI REP GROUP OUT

00:02:52.973 --> 00:02:54.448
OF DALLAS AND TODAY

00:02:54.775 --> 00:02:57.343
HAS 100 SALES PEOPLE
REPRESENTING MAJOR

00:02:57.406 --> 00:03:00.313
HUNTING AND FISHING TACKLE
COMPANIES IN 30 STATES AND

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:01.343
TERRITORIES.

00:03:01.345 --> 00:03:04.456
BUT IN 1995, ANOTHER
DOOR OPENED TO RAY,

00:03:04.945 --> 00:03:06.886
THE STRIKE KING LURE COMPANY.

00:03:06.973 --> 00:03:11.340
He's like, he's like
'Okay, where are we?'

00:03:11.391 --> 00:03:14.055
I said 'Man, he wants a
lot of money for this thing.'

00:03:14.126 --> 00:03:16.275
'Dad, do it! We can
do something with it.'

00:03:16.276 --> 00:03:21.501
And we did. We took the company
and it was doing 10-11 million dollars

00:03:21.503 --> 00:03:25.271
in sales and today we're
substantially above that.

00:03:25.865 --> 00:03:28.118
WITH TWO SUCCESSFUL
COMPANIES UNDER HIS BELT,

00:03:28.675 --> 00:03:31.276
RAY WANTED TO GIVE SOMETHING
BACK TO THE FISHING INDUSTRY.

00:03:31.741 --> 00:03:36.125
TODAY HE SITS ON NO LESS
THAN 16 ADVISORY BOARDS,

00:03:36.141 --> 00:03:38.310
FOUNDATIONS AND ORGANIZATIONS

00:03:38.661 --> 00:03:40.621
ALL DEDICATED TO CONSERVATION.

00:03:41.191 --> 00:03:43.603
BUT IT'S THE KIDS WHO
TUG AT HIS HEART.

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:47.060
I started hearing the
companies that we

00:03:47.061 --> 00:03:50.743
represent and the customers
that we sell to

00:03:51.110 --> 00:03:52.576
telling me that

00:03:53.310 --> 00:03:57.443
their, the average age of their
customer was getting older.

00:03:58.581 --> 00:04:00.440
And I started asking them
'What are you doing about it?'

00:04:00.951 --> 00:04:04.606
RAY OPENED UP HIS 18-HUNDRED
ACRE RANCH TO YOUTH GROUPS,

00:04:04.678 --> 00:04:07.636
GIVING KIDS A CHANCE TO
CATCH THEIR FIRST FISH

00:04:07.638 --> 00:04:08.753
OR TAKE THEIR FIRST DEER.

00:04:09.335 --> 00:04:12.018
HE SPONSORED COUNTLESS
YOUTH OUTINGS, AND IT'S

00:04:12.056 --> 00:04:15.376
REPORTED THAT MORE THAN
50,000 KIDS HAVE HAD AN

00:04:15.378 --> 00:04:17.790
OUTDOOR EXPERIENCE
BECAUSE OF HIM.

00:04:17.855 --> 00:04:20.826
He could have took all that
money and everything else

00:04:20.876 --> 00:04:22.861
he made and put it in his
pocket and went off

00:04:22.876 --> 00:04:24.215
somewhere else.

00:04:24.216 --> 00:04:27.800
But when he's spending that
money to help somebody else

00:04:27.801 --> 00:04:32.871
learn to fish and get the handicapped
and the underprivileged kids out

00:04:32.911 --> 00:04:37.243
fishing, that's one of the things
I respect him for more than

00:04:37.278 --> 00:04:38.245
anything else.

00:04:38.411 --> 00:04:40.245
You know everybody's got 24
hours, I don't care how much

00:04:40.246 --> 00:04:41.446
money you've got.

00:04:41.516 --> 00:04:44.785
And Ray gives a whole lot of his
24 hours to hunting and fishing

00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:45.985
and kids in Texas.

00:04:46.221 --> 00:04:49.978
He fishes and he hunts, he is
very avid. And he wants

00:04:50.316 --> 00:04:51.988
everyone to have that opportunity

00:04:52.428 --> 00:04:54.333
and he's willing to put up
to see that it happens.

00:04:55.053 --> 00:04:56.538
ALWAYS COMPETITIVE,

00:04:56.863 --> 00:04:59.431
RAY HAS FISHED B.A.S.S
TOURNAMENTS FOR 40

00:04:59.433 --> 00:05:01.435
OUT OF HIS 65 YEARS.

00:05:01.578 --> 00:05:04.361
HE'S WON JUST ABOUT EVERY
DIVISION FROM INDIVIDUAL,

00:05:04.735 --> 00:05:05.595
TO FATHER-DAUGHTER

00:05:05.966 --> 00:05:06.895
AND JUST RECENTLY

00:05:07.196 --> 00:05:08.080
HE AND HIS SON MIKE

00:05:08.213 --> 00:05:11.380
WON THE TEXAS TWO-MAN
TEAM CHAMPIONSHIP.

00:05:11.608 --> 00:05:13.686
He and I never did win
the father son division

00:05:13.746 --> 00:05:15.615
and this is one I'm really proud of.

00:05:15.746 --> 00:05:17.313
We caught 46 pounds of fish

00:05:18.146 --> 00:05:20.146
all on Strike King jigs

00:05:20.713 --> 00:05:22.046
and Strike King lizards.

00:05:22.113 --> 00:05:23.956
One thing is for sure; it's
always going to be a day

00:05:23.958 --> 00:05:24.858
of laughs with him.

00:05:24.946 --> 00:05:29.328
He gives a lot of comic relief
especially when things aren't

00:05:29.346 --> 00:05:30.740
going so well.

00:05:30.741 --> 00:05:31.903
What I really wanted to be was

00:05:32.623 --> 00:05:34.671
was a manufacturer's rep
selling women's lingerie.

00:05:34.713 --> 00:05:37.680
[laughing]

00:05:37.893 --> 00:05:41.376
And how I ended up with
fishing tackle I'll never know.

00:05:41.656 --> 00:05:44.610
BUT THERE'S ONE MORE CATEGORY
RAY WANTS TO WIN.

00:05:44.883 --> 00:05:47.506
Yep. Yep. I got to win one with

00:05:48.551 --> 00:05:50.990
my husband and wife division.
I gotta go fish for that one.

00:05:51.918 --> 00:05:55.841
IN APRIL 2005, RAY MURSKI
MARRIED AMANDA SMITH

00:05:56.190 --> 00:05:57.856
AND PROMPTLY TOOK HER FISHING.

00:05:58.233 --> 00:06:03.296
Ray was named one of
the 25 bass fishing icons

00:06:03.365 --> 00:06:05.428
from Bass Master Magazine,

00:06:06.081 --> 00:06:08.168
and he never lets me forget it.

00:06:08.715 --> 00:06:11.048
I'm always fishing with an icon.

00:06:11.248 --> 00:06:13.340
Come here icon.

00:06:14.115 --> 00:06:16.748
I feel like I can do this for
another 20-30 years.

00:06:16.781 --> 00:06:22.033
[music]
