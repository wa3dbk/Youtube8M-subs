00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:05.460
Whenever we are looking for an online tool
or service,

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:07.979
We do a google search. Right?

00:00:07.979 --> 00:00:10.900
But, some websites do not appear in the search
results

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:13.820
though, they are still better than those who
do.

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:18.190
Therefore, In today’s video we will see
some of those less known useful websites

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:21.200
that everyone should know.

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.350
So let's get started.

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:26.560
Ninete - app installer for Windows

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:30.820
While installing any windows application
we have to spend a tons of time,

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:34.160
clicking on NEXT NEXT NEXT on the setup wizard

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:38.589
and if you are not careful enough,
you will end up installing, ASK toolbar on

00:00:38.589 --> 00:00:41.040
your browser.

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.260
And this where NINite comes in,
simply head over to this website,

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:48.159
check mark the list of applications you want
to install

00:00:48.159 --> 00:00:52.870
then download the custom installer and run
it on your system

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:56.129
NINite will install all the applications in
the background,

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.379
without you having to click on NEXT NEXT each
time.

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:03.649
And yeah, it’s does come with any bloatware
as well.

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:05.820
2. SumoPaint - powerful online image editor

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.149
When it comes to online image editing,
most web app can only

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:14.070
crop, rotate or apply filter to your images.
Right?

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:15.600
But sumo paint is an exception.

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.409
It’s a powerful online image editor
that support advance image editing options

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:24.050
like layers, drop shadow and blend mode etc.

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:27.070
Here, you can either upload an image from
your computer

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:31.000
and then edit it
or you create images from the scratch, like

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.420
you do in photoshop.

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:38.840
Now, obviously it’s not as powerful as Photoshop,
but if you don’t have access to Photoshop

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:40.680
then sumopaint is the best alternative.

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.149
3. Soundation - online music editor

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:46.560
When it comes to mixing or editing music
Audacity is the best

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:52.460
but if I have to do that online
then soundation is what I am going to use

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:57.020
You can import music from your computer or
use the free soundtracks from the library

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:58.740
and make your own music

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:02.439
And once you are done you can
export the music as a .wav file.

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:06.070
Overall if you want quickly edit two music
file

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:11.450
but don’t have time to install any program
then soundation is what you need.

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:13.989
4. Studio s-tupeflix online video editor

00:02:13.989 --> 00:02:16.629
Final cut pro for MAC or
Premier Pro for Windows

00:02:16.629 --> 00:02:20.890
are best video editors that most professional
use.

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.250
But lets say you want to mix some videos and
audio files

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:28.390
then there is no need to download a then big
video editor

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:36.680
and can easily be done online with Studio
s-tupeflix

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.860
To get started,
you can either choose a from pre-built themes

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:41.190
or start from the scratch

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:47.760
then add your images, video and sound clips.
And that’s it, your video will be ready

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:56.540
in no time.

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:02.060
5. Calm - focus your mind

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:04.920
Studies has shown,
people who meditated daily for 8 week,

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:10.900
develop more grey matter in prefrontal cortex
which reduce stress and helps you to focus

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:12.000
more on your work.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.340
Now, I personally tested it and can confirm
it work.

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:18.879
I have been meditating daily for 8 months
now

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:22.510
and it has brought lots of positive changes
in my life.

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:26.650
So if you too want to start with meditation
then check out this website.

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:30.129
Calm has guided meditations ranging from 2
to 20 minutes

00:03:30.129 --> 00:03:33.370
that will help you to reduce stress
and boost your productivity.

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:37.870
They also have mobile app, that will help
you form a daily routine.

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:42.630
However for smartphones, I would recommended
Headspace instead.

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:45.730
For more on how to use technology to learn
meditation

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:47.500
check out the post on my blog.

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:50.540
6. Grammarly - check Grammar and spelling

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:52.560
People often judge you on your language.

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:57.040
Weather it’s a comment on Facebook or
you are writing a blog post.

00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:00.890
There is no room for bad grammar or spelling
mistakes.

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:03.520
Unlike the browser spell check, grammarly
also looks

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:07.709
for grammatical error and punctuation mistakes.
and when found,

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:09.939
it also point you in right direction.

00:04:09.939 --> 00:04:15.500
However it’s not always possible to
use this website for proof reading. right?

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:20.000
Therefore you can install its chrome extension
and it will automatically checks for error

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.360
on the page you are working.

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:27.830
You get advance options in the paid version.
However I am using the free version for a

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:31.330
long time and
it worked fine for me.

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:36.789
7. Scamadviser
Every now and then we come across a websites

00:04:36.789 --> 00:04:38.669
that seems too good to be true

00:04:38.669 --> 00:04:42.199
So if you want to find out, if the websites
is real or fake

00:04:42.199 --> 00:04:43.490
use scamadviser.

00:04:43.490 --> 00:04:50.259
Here you can find useful details about websites
like how old it’s is, what is its alexa

00:04:50.259 --> 00:04:53.810
ranking,
how you can contact the owner, who is hosting

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:55.639
this website etc.

00:04:55.639 --> 00:04:59.050
And also, if people have talk about that website
on social media

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:02.300
then it also fetches those post and show them
as a comment below.

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:06.889
So overall it’s nice tool,
if you want to gather information about any

00:05:06.889 --> 00:05:07.979
website.

00:05:07.979 --> 00:05:10.419
8. 1happybirthday.com

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:15.310
One thing that every one of us do is,
to wish your friends happy birthday.

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:19.350
So instead of just typing the same old
Happy birthday text on their Facebook news

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:22.530
feed,
why not sing them a birthday song.

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:25.389
And guess what , 1happybirthday does exactly
that

00:05:25.389 --> 00:05:27.370
and it does that really well.

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:30.120
So you have to search for name, and if it’s
there

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:34.520
you will get audio that plays a birthday song
including your name.

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:38.090
You can even download the song and send it
over whatsapp

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:42.710
or paste a link on their newsfeed.

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:54.020
Now there are two reason, I am recommending
this websites

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:58.419
First, they have tons of name in the list.
Not just popular english names

00:05:58.419 --> 00:06:02.270
but it also cover Indians and Spanish names
in great depth

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:05.680
And second, they claim, all the songs are
sung in natural voice

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:10.889
and not be using text-to-voice search engine.
They even claim they sang every song manually.

00:06:10.889 --> 00:06:12.660
I don’t know how true it’s.
But whatever it’s, they are doing a great

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:13.660
job.

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:14.660
9. r.sine.com

00:06:14.660 --> 00:06:16.220
It’s fairly an unpopular websites that I
found on reddit.

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:18.860
So what it does is, every time you reload
the page,

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:22.569
it shows you an interesting picture or a gif.

00:06:22.569 --> 00:06:25.199
And that’s it, nothing else.

00:06:25.199 --> 00:06:30.449
Every once in while, I head over to this websites
and spend hours simply refreshing the page.

00:06:30.449 --> 00:06:35.060
So yeah, if you ever got bored on the internet
but not in the mood to do anything heavy

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:38.240
checkout this websites.

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:40.360
10 music.163.com

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:46.030
When you want to listen some music,
you either go to youTube or pandora.

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:50.580
Now both of them good music collection
but YouTube suck up a lot of bandwidth and

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:54.780
pandora has ads.
Not to mention that pandora is not available

00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:55.960
outside US as well. Right?

00:06:55.960 --> 00:07:01.349
And this where music.163 comes in.
This is a chinese audio streaming service

00:07:01.349 --> 00:07:04.580
with huge collections of English and hindi
songs.

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:09.610
The great thing about it is,
you get related song and lyrics on the same

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:12.500
page.
Making it a perfect music streaming service.

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:15.520
Well, this all for now. These were some of
the websites that

00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:17.229
I constantly use and found them useful.

00:07:17.229 --> 00:07:22.930
For links, please check my blog post.
I will add more websites in the list as I

00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:24.169
discover them.

00:07:24.169 --> 00:07:27.629
And like I said,
most of these websites do not come in search

00:07:27.629 --> 00:07:31.050
results
So I highly recommend you bookmark the post

00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:33.759
or add this video to your favourite.

00:07:33.759 --> 00:07:36.300
That being said,

00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:39.319

off

00:07:47.789 --> 00:07:49.700
