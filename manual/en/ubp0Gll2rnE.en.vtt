Phil: Do-do-do-do-do (singing)

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:11.610
Hey guys it's Phil from Smilinggardener.com,
if you haven't picked up my free online organic

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.289
gardening course you ca do that right on the
homepage of Smilinggardener.com. Today I'm

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:18.180
going to be doing some planting and seeding
so I'm going to show you 3 things. I'm going

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:22.810
to show you seed bed preparation to make the
soil ready, I'm going to show you sowing seeds,

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:26.640
how to plant seeds, and planting vegetables
and just planting flowers and other small

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.320
herbs and things like that. So 3 things today.
What I will be using today is a hoe just to

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:33.730
get those last weeds that have come up in
the last couple of weeks. You can see behind

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:38.070
me I have some members of the allium family,
a few onions, a few garlic that I could take

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.989
out, it would make for a nice clean bed, but
I'd rather leave them in there because then

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:48.989
I have just more biodiversity in the garden.
The next important step here is to take the

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:54.050
hard rake and level everything out and the
cool thing about doing that is when you do

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:57.880
it it's almost like your tilling half and
inch because you're just kind of lightly using

00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:00.989
the rake and it makes a really nice place
to put your seeds into. So that's what I'm

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:04.309
going to do now, making everything nice and
level. The mulch is on now and you can see

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:08.210
I actually put a reasonably thick layer I
just have to make sure wherever I put seeds

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:11.360
that I don't have too thick of a layer of
straw. Another thing I was going to mention

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:15.890
is I like to water the garden before I plant.
Not right before because you don't want to

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:19.560
be working in really mucky soil. But like
an hour before or the night before it really

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.280
makes planting a lot easier. I'm kind of doing
like a modified 3 sisters guild here, where

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:29.590
I'm planting corn and beans and squash. It's
a native-American method of planting these

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:33.299
together for all the benefits that they bring
each other. And there's actually a 4th sister

00:01:33.299 --> 00:01:36.670
called cleome so I'm going to plant a few
cleomes today. As I mentioned in my video

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:40.570
last week this corn is not ready to plant
it really needs another week or so to get

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:44.080
a better root system, so I'm a little concerned
it's going to fall apart when I plant and

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:49.200
well I hope it doesn't! The reason I'm planting
today (as I've said before as well) is I'm

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.990
heading out of town tomorrow for nearly 3
weeks so I really have to get these things

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:57.450
in today. I have to seed today and I have
to hope that when I get back that this stuff

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:01.549
is all going to be alive. To prepare the planting
hole here you could use a little trowel. One

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:07.439
thing often like to use is a fork, and I just
kind of dig up the hole's soil, not too deep

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:14.230
but just deep enough to loosen everything.
And that gives a nice planting bed and it

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:17.930
makes it really easy to plant with just my
hands. You always want to remove the pot when

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.790
you plant. I think that's pretty obvious for
plastic but even if you have any kind of burlap

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:26.700
or fiber pot or even like a biodegradable
pot as they call it, you always want to remove

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.790
it because it really doesn't want to be in
there with the plant. And I spray them with

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:34.340
effective microorganisms and kelp and see
minerals - all these kind of biostimulants

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:38.980
I've talked about. On the root ball. you can
spray the leaves too. And while I'm at it,

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:43.180
I take a little bit of my micorhhizal fungal
powder, I just rub the on the roots doesn't

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:47.340
have to go everywhere. To plant it now I can
just dig with my hands basically, kind of

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:52.319
remove the clumps. Put it down in there and
with something like this you just want the

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:56.709
top of this to be level with the top of your
soil. And then you want to fill it back in

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:00.459
with the same soil that's already there. It
doesn't look like that exciting of soil but

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:05.480
I know that I amended it with compost about
a month ago, so I know that it's in good shape.

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:10.560
And same with the fertilizers that I put in
there. I really want to press it down - not

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:13.709
that I want to compact the soil but it needs
to have good soil around it. I'm going to

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:19.209
plant 4 corns per whole about 6 inches apart
just in a diamond shape and that's one of

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:26.209
the ways that the three sisters are put together
like that. Gently, very gently kind of squeeze

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:32.900
on the bottom of the container and push the
plant out and you try not to pull on the stem

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:39.900
other than just guiding it with the stem.
Especially today I have to be very careful.

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:45.150
Yay!! So we have a plant here, now this was
one of the taller ones so it's probably going

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:48.920
to having a better root system but at least
that came out in one piece. I don't need to

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:53.900
spray this with any of my liquid or micorrhyzal
fungi because I did that when I seeded and

00:03:53.900 --> 00:04:00.900
I've been watering with the liquid throughout
the week so it's all ready to go. One corn

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:12.209
down 47 more to go! Now we're onto sewing
seeds! And the first thing that I do before

00:04:12.209 --> 00:04:17.999
I sew seeds is, as I've said before, is I
soak them first for about 6-12 hours in - it

00:04:17.999 --> 00:04:23.960
could be just water - but I usually include
some liquid kelp and/or some liquid sea minerals

00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:28.509
and that's going to give the seeds some minerals
for when they sprout, so they have all these

00:04:28.509 --> 00:04:32.319
trace minerals they need and the kelp gives
them some natural plant growth hormones that

00:04:32.319 --> 00:04:36.680
really help with that early germination and
growing process. Here I have my pole bean

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:40.199
seeds, these are what are going to climb up
the corn and use the corn as a trellis and

00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:45.259
these are my squash seeds these big guys here,
legumes like beans and peas do really well

00:04:45.259 --> 00:04:49.949
if they have their nitrogen-fixing inoculant
on them. There may be some of those bacteria

00:04:49.949 --> 00:04:53.800
in the soil but there may not be. So if I
just take a little bit of this inoculant and

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:59.779
sprinkle it on, as I've shown you before.
And the next one I can put on ALL the seeds

00:04:59.779 --> 00:05:05.379
is my micorrhizal inoculant which again is
in a powder form so I just sprinkle it on.

00:05:05.379 --> 00:05:10.610
I can put that on the cucumbers and squash
as well. And now these are inoculated and

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:14.539
they're going to be that much happier. So
I can dig a little hole with my finger here

00:05:14.539 --> 00:05:20.999
to plant the seed, place it down in there
and just cover it up with nice powdery soil

00:05:20.999 --> 00:05:25.039
so you almost want to rub your soil between
your fingers to make sure it's really nice

00:05:25.039 --> 00:05:30.249
and powdery. I could water these in now but
since I watered the garden before I don't

00:05:30.249 --> 00:05:33.990
have to. So I'll actually water tomorrow.
And then I'll be watering every day until

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:37.189
these seeds germinate and then it'll slowly
decrease in the amount of watering I need

00:05:37.189 --> 00:05:41.069
to do. So if you have any questions about
preparing a seed bed, or planting vegetables

00:05:41.069 --> 00:05:45.509
or flowers or sowing seeds, ask them in the
questions down below. If you haven't picked

00:05:45.509 --> 00:05:49.800
up my free online organic gardening course
you can do that down below and you can come

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:53.999
and join me and my sister over on Facebook
