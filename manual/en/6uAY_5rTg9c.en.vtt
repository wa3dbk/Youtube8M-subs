00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.340
Chances are you know this better as "Stunt
Race FX."

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:23.430
That better explains what the heck's going
on.

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:28.349
Stunts, and racing, and the infamous Super
FX Microchip that made things like StarFox

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:29.720
and... um...

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:31.320
Vortex... possible.

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.250
And now it's being used for a racing game,
made by Nintendo, that ISN'T Mario Kart.

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:37.250
I know.

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:41.360
Sure, it's a huge step forward in terms of
console graphics by having a fully polygonal

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:42.360
environment.

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.970
Problem is... well, just look at it.

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:49.339
You can count the framerate on one hand.

00:00:49.339 --> 00:00:54.850
One bleeding hand.

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:59.160
Exactly.

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:04.710
So as one of three cars - the fast one, the
big one, or the Goldilocks (hell, it's even

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:05.710
yellow) - you...

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:06.710
um, drive.

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:12.070
There are four game modes: Race, trick, battle,
and free (which just uses the Race tracks

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:13.350
anyway with no opponents.)

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.240
The race takes place over two circuits of
four tracks each, which have... man, it's

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.970
kinda hard to look at this.

00:01:19.970 --> 00:01:24.991
Polygons poppin' up everywhere, draw distances
of next to nothing... admittedly, this is

00:01:24.991 --> 00:01:28.890
from a time when the very concept of "draw
distance" was kinda alien to most people.

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:32.360
And this took a special microchip in order
to make it happen.

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:37.520
This machine, which also gave us everything
from Final Fantasy VI to Donkey Kong Country,

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:43.580
needed extra firepower to make a 3D racing
game look like... this.

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:47.860
This is why that gap between the 4th and 5th
generations was so awkward, we were rebuilding

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:51.240
everything in a third dimension.

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:54.220
Oh, yeah.

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:55.720
Racing.

00:01:55.720 --> 00:02:01.800
You... um, you go around a track.

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:06.080
There are red powerups that heal damage and
blue powerups that recharge your boost gauge...

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.030
and three other cars.

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:10.610
In fairness, two other cars and a motorcycle.

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:13.500
Admittedly, there are some pretty cool effects
like an echo when you enter this tunnel in

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:19.450
the water area, and... um, Mario and Fox and
Kirby posters?

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:20.739
And height differences!

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:22.730
That's something there hadn't been before,
right?

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:27.540
Awright, so it's just checkpoint-based racing
that's rather awkwardly timed: A couple situations

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.390
saw me in first place and still timing out.

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:35.790
So let's leave the races behind and turn to
the Trick mode, which isn't really about tricks

00:02:35.790 --> 00:02:40.730
at all but is about braving the perils of
variable terrain in order to collect all the

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:42.140
stars.

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:43.140
All the stars.

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:50.390
All of them.

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:55.790
So Wild Trax AKA Stunt Race FX doesn't really
stand up to today's standards... or really

00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:58.040
any standards of nostalgia for that matter.

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:02.880
It does serve, however, as a museum piece
in a way: A solid point you can look back

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:03.920
on and go, "Man.

00:03:03.920 --> 00:03:05.790
We've come a long way, haven't we?"

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:10.970
I thank Felicity in Worcestershire for sending
it, but wonder if this was some kind of Ultraman-style

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:14.950
penance for the other awesome stuff she's
sent me in the past.

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:16.920
Like, Doraemon for the Game Gear.

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:18.440
Or hamsters!

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:19.390
Penance for hamsters.
