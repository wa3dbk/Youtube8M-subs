Hello, Badi here.

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:27.440
Today I want to show You

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.600
My build for Lightning

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:31.680
For barbarian

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:33.180
In Diablo III

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:34.320
At Start.

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.967
Lets check my equipment.

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.753
Here we have Raekor set.

00:00:39.514 --> 00:00:41.514
And immortal King.

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:45.280
Something about weapons.

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.280
Typicaly weapon for Lighning is

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.280
Thunderfury Blessed Blade of The Windseeker

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.880
and Fulminator but 

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:56.320
here should be Shard of Hate

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:00.800
but I still can't farm it.

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.480
Anyway Fulminator isn't so bad.

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:10.560
Let's check skill now.

00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:16.240
First skill to generating Fury.

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:20.800
Freenzy with Smite which have a chance to stun enemies.

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.640
Stunning in my build is important because I have Haunt of Vaxo

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:30.800
Which summons

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:39.920
 two Shadows Clones and they're fighting for us for 15 sec.

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:54.080

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:13.440

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:24.560
Seismic Wave making very big damage.

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:35.760
Overpower with Killing Spree.

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.400
War Cry with Impunity

00:02:50.434 --> 00:02:54.594
It's standard for Barbarians which haven't enought of armor.

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.520
like me... :(

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:06.080
If You have enought Armor. You can change this skill to Wrath of The Berserker.

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:16.560
Next we have Battle Rage with Maruder's Rage

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:27.040
If You want to kill monster groups faster then you can use Bloodshed.

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:36.400
The last skill with set of Immortal King is of'course Call of The Ancients with lightning rune Together as One

00:03:38.880 --> 00:05:06.560
bla bla. (not important) skip to 5:25

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:08.560
 

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:31.920
Tha last thing about what i want to talk are passive skills.

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:40.720
As You see I'm using 2 defensive and 2 offensive skills.

00:05:42.080 --> 00:06:21.120
