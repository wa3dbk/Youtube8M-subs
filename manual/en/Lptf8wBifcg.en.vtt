00:00:09.369 --> 00:00:13.089
This is the ultimate chocolate cake! We're going to make a sponge from butter, sugar and

00:00:13.089 --> 00:00:17.169
flour and then enrich it with eggs, chocolate and milk. And as if that's not enough

00:00:17.169 --> 00:00:21.270
we're going to cover it with chocolate ganache and fill it with chocolate butter cream. So this really is death by chocolate. 

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.270
So there's a lots going on. So as you can see - an awful lot of butter and chocolate

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:27.300
but this is an indulgent, special treat. 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.930
and this is exactly what we've been asked for  and exactly what we're going to do.

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:34.900
So first thing our butter goes into our mixer

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:37.639
and then sugar. All the ingredients are listed down below and you will need them, cause this 

00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:39.500
this is a cake and they need to be precise. 

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.920
Not going to lie to you Ben, I'm a little bit excited by this one!

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:44.390
So we're going to beat it until light, fluffy and pale. 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:45.900
over here

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:50.040
we can look at our other ingredients. We've got eggs and we're going to need those in a moment, so can you hold those, Barry?

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:51.980
And here we've got some chocolate and milk.

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:54.880
Now if you can just put that into the microwave, Jamie?

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:56.880
We need to melt that down

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:59.740
for 30 seconds to a minute and pour it into our cake mix later on. 

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:01.760
You can see how much lighter it is now

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.550
that is all the air, so what was once yellow butter is now pale and creamy. 

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:09.229
We'll add in our eggs one at a time.

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:12.480
Good, give that a stir Jamie

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:15.150
Now don't add in the next egg until the last one has been fully combined, otherwise you have a risk of it splitting

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:22.150
And the last one!

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:24.800
So there we go 

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.180
our cake mix.

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:31.279
Now the last bit is to add in all of the last few ingredients. Mixer round the side. 

00:01:31.279 --> 00:01:36.240
And then we can add in our self raising flour, cocoa

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:40.080
and all of your chocolate. And then we have beat a lot of air into that so for this one we want to try 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:44.650
to stir it together a bit more carefully
until it's all combined and then we can transfer it 

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:48.680
into our cake dish. So we're doing a double layer sandwich cake.

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:53.000
Woah, two chocolate cakes! There's a lot of mix there so two chocolate cakes is plenty.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.200
So we're going to spread it out

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:57.580
and make it a little bit more shallow
towards the center, because the cake will always 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:01.300
rise in the middle. So that will make it nice and even.

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:04.470
And then if you two could put that into our oven.

00:02:04.470 --> 00:02:08.280
190C for 30 minutes. And the way to check that it's

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.170
cooked is just listen to it. After 30mins it shouldn't make any noise. 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:15.900
No hissing. No sizzling. Then you know it's cooked. 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.390
Our sponges have come out and had time to cool. 

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:25.390
Now you can see the cakes come off really easy because of that greaseproof paper. And we can peel that off. 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.640
That is one amazing chocolate cake. But we're now going to take it to a level of awesomeness

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.880
with a ganache and chocolate buttercream. So we put some cream into our pan

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:38.880
and it's an equal quantity of cream and chocolate. We need to heat it up to boil. 

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.440
And Jamie you'll be in charge of the ganache. 

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:46.490
Not the white chocolate, we're going to need that for later in fact it needs to go back into the fridge. 
It has to be an equal quantity of chocolate and cream otherwise it won't 

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:50.409
ice properly. So if this doesn't quite work, we know who to blame. 

00:02:50.409 --> 00:02:55.409
And while we wait for our cream to heat up, we're going to make our buttercream which is just going to go into the middle. 

00:02:55.409 --> 00:02:59.729
So this is butter, a mountain of butter

00:02:59.729 --> 00:03:04.419
and then twice as much icing sugar to butter for our butter cream.

00:03:04.419 --> 00:03:08.010
And an equal quantity of chocolate and cream for our ganache. What might be worth doing is just putting a tea towel around it to 

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.080
keep as much of that dust in as possible

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:15.659
and then turn it on nice and slow.

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:18.489
It's still escaping!!

00:03:18.489 --> 00:03:20.169
Now hopefully you can see

00:03:20.169 --> 00:03:22.799
a nice smooth butter cream

00:03:22.799 --> 00:03:25.479
and now we're going to do our ganache, because our cream is hot. 

00:03:25.479 --> 00:03:27.430
Pour it straight over the chocolate. 

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:31.199
And that should be enough to melt the chocolate, so leave it for about a minute. 

00:03:31.199 --> 00:03:35.159
And then after a minute, Jamie, I want you to stir it into a beautifully smooth ganache. 

00:03:35.159 --> 00:03:37.829
Now we can do our buttercream, which needs to go into a piping bag.

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:38.879
You can get it nice and smooth in

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:42.260
without getting a mess later on when it comes to squeezing it.  

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:44.219
That's plenty for now.

00:03:44.219 --> 00:03:46.019
So we squeeze that down towards the buttom. 

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:49.219
So we got all the bits we need and now it's time to start constructing.

00:03:49.219 --> 00:03:55.359
So we put one of our cake bases like so. And then around the bottom I've got a few pieces of greaseproof paper

00:03:55.359 --> 00:03:58.869
which you are just going to slide in. It makes the 

00:03:58.869 --> 00:04:01.519
decoration later so idiot proof. 

00:04:01.519 --> 00:04:02.269
The important thing is 

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:03.420
not joined in the middle

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:07.019
but tuck it in around the edges. Now we don't want to be shy with this filling. 

00:04:07.019 --> 00:04:08.549
Wohohoho!

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:11.639
You want the butter cream 

00:04:11.639 --> 00:04:14.769
to almost be as thick as one of those cake layers. 

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:16.049
Like so. 

00:04:16.049 --> 00:04:20.329
Then the next one sits on top of that. 

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:26.229
Then we fill in the gaps. We need a nice, smooth edge. So this is where 

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:30.050
the more time you take in making it look awesome now, the better it will be at the end. 

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:31.050
This is the ganache. 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:35.250
And this is silky smooth, look how glossy that is. That's just cream and chocolate.

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:36.910
Equal quantities of each. 

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:39.020
And this is were it starts to get messy, because to ice it

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:43.829
you just pour it over and let it run. 

00:04:43.829 --> 00:04:47.899
It'll run everywhere. But don't worry. You've got the greaseproof paper there to save it. 

00:04:47.899 --> 00:04:50.520
Woah!

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:51.709
Wow!

00:04:51.709 --> 00:04:52.509
Like that. Now

00:04:52.509 --> 00:04:53.979
the great thing about this ganache. 

00:04:53.979 --> 00:04:55.369
Not only does it taste good

00:04:55.369 --> 00:04:58.289
you can keep it in the fridge for like a week and just 

00:04:58.289 --> 00:05:01.860
melt it down in the microwave, if you need to do it again. And at this point 

00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:06.069
there is absolutely nothing you can do with it but leave it, ok? So leave it for about 10-20mins so that the chocolate sets up and

00:05:06.069 --> 00:05:09.679
then we'll show you the very next stage. 

00:05:09.679 --> 00:05:13.579
Now that ganache is set up, we can start to peel this away.

00:05:13.579 --> 00:05:16.889
As we take this away it should be a quite neat finish on our board. 

00:05:16.889 --> 00:05:20.350
So what's on that paper isn't going to go to waste. We can scrape that all back off later.

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:24.449
Just grate white chocolate shavings over the top for decoration. 

00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:29.000
Now this is seriously indulgent,
death by chocolate. You guys are going to have 

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:36.000
some chocolate cake for a while. This is our ultimate chocolate cake - SORTED. 

00:05:38.389 --> 00:05:40.919
Nothing left to do but cut off a great big 

00:05:40.919 --> 00:05:42.740
slice of

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:44.740
that beauty

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:47.960
I'm so excited about this

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:50.479
Look at this. 

00:05:50.479 --> 00:05:51.720
Oh my dear!

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:55.389
That is one hell of a chocolate cake! Dig in!

00:05:55.389 --> 00:05:58.219
I have to!

00:05:58.219 --> 00:06:01.389
When you say death by chocolate, Ben, is this just going to kill me?

00:06:01.389 --> 00:06:05.409
Probably if you eat too much of it!

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:12.740
Oh gosh!

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:16.509
This is awesome!

00:06:16.509 --> 00:06:19.800
Now I think this is one of the best recipes we've ever done, but if you go 

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:21.080
and have a look at SORTED FOOD dot com

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:23.940
you can judge for yourself. There are a ton of other recipes that are on there!
