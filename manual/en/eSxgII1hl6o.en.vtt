00:00:00.979 --> 00:00:06.320
So now we move on to doing the ceasar salad.
Now this is going to be a very special salad

00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:13.610
because you're not getting that dressing out
of the jar. So we're going to start with one

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:26.599
cup of mayonnaise. You can use whole mayonnaise,
but this is reduced fat. It tastes the same

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:46.220
to me. Then to that I'm going to add, I've
squeezed some lemon, and again drained it

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:55.820
so that there's no seeds. I'm going to add
two tablespoons of lemon juice. I've got two

00:00:55.820 --> 00:01:05.681
cloves of garlic that I finally chopped, add
that. And I'm going to add one teaspoon, there

00:01:05.681 --> 00:01:17.350
it is, of Worcestershire sauce, so that's
the little hidden kick. The other hidden kick

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:24.000
in Ceasar salad, that people are often, they're
like what, what is it that makes Ceasar salad

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:31.050
so memorable is actually anchovy paste. But
I have somebody who's allergic to fish today,

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:38.640
so I'm going to leave it out. Never tell children
that anchovy paste is in Ceasar salad because

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:51.410
suddenly, they won't eat their Ceasar salad
anymore. I'm going to mix that all together,

00:01:51.410 --> 00:02:08.289
and add half a cup of Parmesan, and then,
half a cup of olive oil. That's roughly, maybe

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:13.450
a little bit more, and then a half a cup of
olive oil, and we're going to do the cro√ªtons.
