00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:05.049
In this clip, we're going to talk about the
proper way to remove and replace worn front

00:00:05.049 --> 00:00:11.400
brake hoses on a 1991 Ford Explorer. In this
clip, we're going to talk about the proper

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:18.370
torque procedure for the lugnuts on a 91 Ford
Explorer. This particular model is relatively

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:24.790
stripped down, and it comes with steel rims.
The specification for a steel rim is eighty

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:29.840
foot pounds, and they don't need to be rechecked
after you tighten them down. If it happened

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:35.329
to be like an Eddie Bauer Edition, or a fancier
version, it would come with aluminum rims.

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:40.020
The spec for those is a hundred foot pounds,
just about as hard as you can pull with one

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.690
hand, and after twenty-five miles you're going
to want to recheck the lugnuts. But, like

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.329
I said, we don't have to on this, so we're
just going to tighten them down using the

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:54.120
star procedure--the same procedure you use
for snugging them down. We're to start from

00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:02.229
here, and move to here, from there to there,
and from here to there, and here to there.

00:01:02.229 --> 00:01:08.000
The reason why you can't torque your lugnuts
with your wheel in the air is there's no resistance.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.550
If you were to take and put your four-way
on it and try to tighten it down, you're not

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:16.960
going to get them tight enough to hold the
wheel on for any decent amount of time. So,

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.590
you let your vehicle down, and you let the
weight and the friction between the ground

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:37.960
and the tire hold it still for you, and you
tighten them down. All right, there.

00:01:37.960 --> 00:02:07.430
And here. And that is the proper way to torque
your vehicle's lugnuts.
