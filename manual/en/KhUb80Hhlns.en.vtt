This is Ed, I'm the owner of AtticFoil.com.
The other day I was talking to a customer

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:10.360
and he said, "Hey Ed, give me a short and
sweet version of everything I need to know

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:16.270
to install AtticFoil Radiant Barrier." So
I crammed in everything he needs to know in

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:21.400
a couple minutes and he said, "You should
make that a video!" I said, "Ok, let me try,

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:26.440
let me see what I can do." So here is basically
what I told him. The first thing is Don't

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:31.480
Over Think It. People tend to think it is
a lot more complicated than it really is and

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:36.030
really, all you're trying to do - the BIG
concept - is you're trying to get a piece

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:42.100
of radiant barrier foil between the roof and
the attic insulation. Normally that roof gets

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:47.280
hot, absorbs all that radiant heat from the
sun, and then the roof re-radiates that heat

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:53.670
across the attic space and it heats up the
insulation. This is heat transfer by NON-contact.

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.420
The whole concept of a radiant barrier is
that we want to get that piece of foil between

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:03.299
the roof and the insulation, it's breaking
that path and reflecting that heat back. Ultimately

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:08.990
what we are trying to do is keep the insulation
cooler. The next thing you are going to do

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:13.140
it staple it up. It doesn't matter whether
it is straight, or crooked, or smooth, or

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:16.900
wrinkled - it really doesn't matter. It's
going to work fine. It doesn't have to be

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:22.592
pretty to be effective. You're going to use
Â¼ inch or 5/16th staples, normally you are

00:01:22.592 --> 00:01:29.330
going to run the radiant barrier foil HORIZONTALLY
across the rafters. The 48" wide product is

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:35.500
kind of the standard for most typical attics.
If you've got a truss attic, you may want

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:41.260
to consider running VERTICALLY (or up and
down) and using the 26" wide product. Finally,

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:46.600
you want to cover as much as possible. Radiant
barrier has a cumulative effect; just like

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.300
if you were to put a tree over half of your
house, it would help more than none of your

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:54.550
house. Radiant barrier is the same concept.
Some people will say, "Oh, if you don't get

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:59.340
80-90% it's not going to be effective!" It's
effective no matter how much you get up, it's

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.310
just a cumulative effect. The more you get,
the better. And you know, you're not going

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:08.680
to get every crack and corner with the radiant
barrier, so don't spend a ton of time trying

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:14.730
to get every single corner. Finally, allow
for attic ventilation. Attic ventilation is

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:19.480
real simple: air comes in the bottom of the
attic, it flows through the attic and it should

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.530
go out the top of the attic. You're going
to have soffit vents in the bottom and some

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:30.819
type of vents on top. It can be ridge vents,
wind turbines, static vents or possibly fans.

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:35.700
You want to give that air path a free path
to go through. You want the air to flow through

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:40.520
the attic as though the foil is not even there.
You can leave gaps at the top and the bottom

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:45.319
so air can come into the attic; it can choose
to either go between the foil and the roof

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:49.550
or into the attic. At the top it is going
to have a path to go out of the attic - that

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:54.370
can be through a ridge vent, the wind turbines...
basically, if there is a hole in the roof,

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:58.620
you want to have a corresponding hole in the
foil. You DO NOT have to have ridge vents

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:03.990
for radiant barrier to work. That air, that
hot air, will find whatever hole is in the

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:08.350
top of the attic. It's really that simple.
So basically: you're going to staple it up,

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:12.200
you're going to get a piece of foil between
the roof and the insulation, you're going

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:17.209
to cover as much as possible, and you're going
to allow for attic ventilation. That's the

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:21.640
short and sweet version of everything you
need to know to install AtticFoil Radiant

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:23.940
Barrier. For more information, visit AtticFoil.com.
