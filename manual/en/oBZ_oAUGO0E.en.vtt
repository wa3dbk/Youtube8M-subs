Hi, my name is Shotsie Gorman. I'm here as
a tattoo artist, a professional tattoo artist

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:14.360
for Expert Village. I'm going to switch machines
temporarily to a smaller, it works good for

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:33.010
the interior lines. Now this is a much finer
cluster of needles, it's three. That feels

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:55.510
much better. Yeah, it's much smaller. Normally
there would be music playing, so it wouldn't

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:09.580
be as intense. The sound is a little annoying.
That's one nice thing about the Japanese form

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:14.463
of tattooing, where they work with hand tools.
Because there's no sound at all. Okay, a couple

00:01:14.463 --> 00:01:15.463
little slight tones on your demarkation of
the skyline, and the mountain range. And the

00:01:15.463 --> 00:01:15.478
sun we're going to be making right? Mmhmm.
Like that for the spots of water.
