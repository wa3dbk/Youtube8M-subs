00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:06.550
Now we are going to finish our water lily.
We folded our blitzes, and we folded the notches

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:15.440
in. Now we are going to reverse the petals.
This is the tricky part, and it requires some

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:22.850
persistence and patience. So, holding the
unit in between your hands so that your thumb

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:32.360
is pushing down all the center points, note
the pockets on the other side. Here, we are

00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:39.559
going to take our fingers, and put them under
the pocket and with our thumb, push down on

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:49.199
this little notch that we had made, and reverse
the petal. This is why we require some soft

00:00:49.199 --> 00:01:00.819
and pliable paper. That way, it won't rip
on us. Again, we'll do it for all four petals.

00:01:00.819 --> 00:01:15.640
Holding the center down; reversed the petals.
These are the first sets of petals. Now, there

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:33.109
are more. There are four more here, and we're
going to reverse them as well. And finally,

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:40.700
we have a last set of petals to re-fold reverse,
and this is the trickiest one of all, because

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:51.579
it's one layer, and it can tear more easily.
So here, very gently, we're going to reverse

00:01:51.579 --> 00:02:03.289
that petal, so that we don't rip the very
edges. Very gently reverse that petal. Our

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:20.560
third one; oops, I ripped it, that's okay.
And then finally, the last petal. And then

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:31.180
go in there and kind of re-form your water
lily to the correct shape, and you have your

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:31.920
water lily.
