00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.160
The Kiwis test against Samoa

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:07.440
is shaping up to be a bit more
than expected for Adam Blair

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.680
as he was welcomed home to Whangarei
today with a rousing reception.

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:15.040
We caught up with the Kiwis star

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:19.960
where he talks about coming
from Whangarei's roughest suburb.

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.360
Raniera Harrison reports.

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:28.160
A stirring welcome home
for one of their own.

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.200
The people of the north
came out to Kensington Park today

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.320
for one player in particular.

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.080
The star Kiwis forward, Adam Blair,
says a return home

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:47.760
was just what he needed.

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.640
And now the boy from Hokianga

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:03.040
gets the chance to reunite
with one of his biggest fans.

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:04.560
He was a good boy.

00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:05.760
Good at school.

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.720
Though he wasn't the best
at writing.

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.320
He was a champion at running -

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.160
that's how they all were.

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:16.640
From the glamour
of top-flight football,

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:20.600
Adam Blair has humble beginnings
in Otangarei,

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:24.000
one of the roughest suburbs
in the north.

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:35.600
This is the former Blair residence,

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:40.000
the house where Adam and his seven
younger siblings grew up.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:40.880
Around here,

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.440
he's remembered
as a cheeky Maori boy

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:45.800
with big dreams and aspirations.

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.080
There's the million dollar question,

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.600
will Adam Blair be given
the leading honours

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.360
on his home pitch on Saturday?

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:17.240
Whether or not he gets to lead
the haka on home soil,

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:18.520
Blair is home,

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:21.200
and home is where the heart is.

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.400
Raniera Harrison, Te Karere.
