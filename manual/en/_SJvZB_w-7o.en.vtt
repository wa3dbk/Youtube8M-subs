00:00:03.371 --> 00:00:08.111
In order to make sense of our complex economic
and financial systems we're going to take

00:00:08.111 --> 00:00:14.091
you to a remote community in the mountains
of Colorado. This is where Nathan, the last

00:00:14.091 --> 00:00:20.301
mountain man lived.
Nathan was the real thing. Nathan's goal was

00:00:20.301 --> 00:00:27.301
to be the last mountain man.
Nathan was the last of his breed. He's a dying

00:00:27.931 --> 00:00:34.931
breed. There wasn't and never will be another
Nathan. I think Nathan had a harder life than

00:00:35.221 --> 00:00:42.221
any of us can imagine. He died when he was
sixty-six years old - he looked like he was

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:48.651
a hundred and six. I mean, he battled the
elements all the time. He was up here, you

00:00:48.651 --> 00:00:55.371
know, in five foot snow storms out in the
woods just trying to survive.

00:00:55.371 --> 00:01:01.020
Nathan chose to live outside of our modern
world. He eschewed money - he had no savings,

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:07.861
he earned no income, he had no phone, no internet,
no credit cards. He used his ingenuity and

00:01:07.861 --> 00:01:12.900
immense skill as a hunter and fisherman to
live off the land.

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:17.290
Nathan told me that he snared the bunnies.
He would set little strings out and the bunnies

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:19.710
would put their foot in the strings and he
would catch them.

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:23.540
But I know he trapped, and of course he fished
a lot.

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:26.100
And he was a great fisherman and he caught
a lot of trout.

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:33.100
His lifestyle was so basic and so simple,
you know. No telephones to answer, no bills

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:40.320
to pay - I mean literally no bills to pay.
I mean he figured out a way to live in a world

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:47.540
without money, in a world without bills.
Try as he might, he could not satisfy all

00:01:48.191 --> 00:01:53.850
his wants from his own initiative. There were
some things the forest could not provide such

00:01:53.850 --> 00:02:00.040
as protective winter clothes, boots, fish
hooks, and most importantly, chocolate and

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:05.010
coffee.
Chocolate was his favorite - loved chocolate.

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:09.761
Coffee was his other favorite - drank more
coffee than anyone I ever met.

00:02:09.761 --> 00:02:14.300
For these precious items Nathan would hitchhike
into the town of Nederland where he would

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:20.371
barter - trade fresh trout and rabbits for
the things he needed.

00:02:20.371 --> 00:02:27.041
He would come in with his bloody bunnies - his
bunnies in a plastic bag. Or with fish, he'd

00:02:27.041 --> 00:02:33.321
come in with his fish.
By bartering the way he did with rabbits,

00:02:33.321 --> 00:02:40.321
same with fish, he kind of had a handle on
what he could get in exchange. And I think

00:02:40.740 --> 00:02:46.321
he crafted his life in that way.
Oh he thought that he was providing a real

00:02:46.321 --> 00:02:50.651
outstanding opportunity to eat high quality
things.

00:02:50.651 --> 00:02:57.500
He would go along and trade people either
fresh rabbit or fresh trout for numerous things.

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:04.500
That was his way to survive to get the gear
he needed: coffee; chocolate; beans; canned

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:09.541
goods; maybe a carton of fresh milk to take
home.

00:03:09.541 --> 00:03:16.151
Barter requires what economists call a coincidence
of wants. If Nathan wants chocolate he must

00:03:16.151 --> 00:03:22.211
find someone with a surplus of chocolate who
would like rabbit meat. Finding this coincidence

00:03:22.211 --> 00:03:28.371
of wants is exceedingly difficult.
Who's got what I need? Do they want trout?

00:03:28.371 --> 00:03:35.211
Do they want rabbits? What are they gonna
want? And it's the art of the deal. I mean

00:03:35.211 --> 00:03:39.890
you don't just - it's not like Walmart where
you write a check at the cash register and

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:46.440
walk out to your car. It's the whole art of
the deal of how do I get a ride to who I need

00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:53.440
to go see? What time of day is it? How do
my hunting and fishing trips line up with

00:03:54.511 --> 00:04:01.511
when I'm gonna go do this so that the kill
is fresh, so I've got fresh kill to trade

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:05.961
with?
In reality, the people of Nederland and Ward

00:04:05.961 --> 00:04:11.261
accepted Nathan's goods - not because they
were needed - but because they valued and

00:04:11.261 --> 00:04:15.911
admired his independence and his spirit.
I mean, the people that you meet who actually

00:04:15.911 --> 00:04:22.911
knew him are honored that they knew him cause
he's a legend. And if they could support him

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:29.170
by bartering with him and honoring, I mean,
knowing that this is the greatest gift that

00:04:29.170 --> 00:04:35.531
he has to give you. Even though you don't
need this rabbit - that is - I mean, it was

00:04:35.531 --> 00:04:41.801
gold to him. 
Nathan believed he was bartering a good value.

00:04:41.801 --> 00:04:48.670
In reality he was trading on his goodwill.
Nathan was bartering but it was a different

00:04:48.670 --> 00:04:54.341
kind of barter, because most people weren't
going to take the dead trout out of his pocket,

00:04:54.341 --> 00:05:01.341
you know what I mean, or the bloody bunny.
But they were going to take Nathan's intentions.

00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:08.700
So Nathan was a guy who traded his good intentions
for what he needed in this world.

00:05:10.831 --> 00:05:15.211
Although Nathan was greatly admired by the
community, few people actually choose to live

00:05:15.211 --> 00:05:22.211
this way. Most of us are part of the economic
and financial systems that enable trade, consumption,

00:05:23.181 --> 00:05:28.931
saving, and investing. These systems are essential
to our modern way of life. And to make best

00:05:28.931 --> 00:05:31.410
use of them we need to understand how they
work.
