00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.200
How the hell did you do that?

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:05.200
That's so freaky! That is so sick!

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:09.000
OH my God! hahaha

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:14.300
How's your imagination?

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:17.769
uuuh, pretty vivid. I think
Pretty vivid haha, I don't think I'm going

00:00:17.769 --> 00:00:20.800
to ask anything about that.
Ok, I want you to, I want you to imagine I've

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.570
got a pack of cards, it's an invisible pack
of cards.

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:26.769
So take the cards
Alright, just get used to the feel of them.

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:28.880
Spread through, have a look at all of the
faces

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.249
and I want you to think of one of the cards
in your mind

00:00:31.249 --> 00:00:36.550
And now, I want you to reach into the pack,
take the card out, that you're thinking of,

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:40.830
turn it around, and put it back in again.
So there's one card that's face down in the

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:41.380
pack
OK

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:43.140
That only you know
Got that?

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.220
Yep
And then straighten all the cards up, square

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:48.340
them up
I've got a card box, a real card box

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:51.580
So that's the imagination part, could you
do me a favour and put the cards in the box

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:53.320
for me?
There you go!

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.480
I've got a card box, I want you to put the
cards in the box for me.

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:57.820
Very good
haha

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:01.520
Excellent, well done!
Alright, that's the imagination part done.

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:04.059
But what if we could make your imagination
reality?

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:09.580
I'd be very impressed!
If we just open up now you'll see there's

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:11.290
actually
a real pack of cards inside

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:18.290
There's actually a real pack of cards inside

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:25.640
However, If it's the same pack of cards that you imagined
there should be one card turned over in the

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:27.500
pack, that only you know.
So for the first time, what was the card that you turned over?

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:28.500
The Queen of Hearts

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.500
For the first time what was the card that
you were just thinking of?

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:31.500
Jack of Spades

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.900
The Five of Hearts
The Five of Hearts?

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:39.299
OK, so we'll just have to have a little look through
and hopefully, there should be one card in

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:41.690
here
And... if we have a look through

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:48.290
There's one card turned around, in amongst
Do you want to take it out and have a look?

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:50.420
No....Way!
How the Hell did you do that?

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:51.270
Oh my god!

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:55.790
Can you take it out and have a look?
hahahahaha

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:02.590
Do you want to show the camera as well?
 Hahahaha

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.000
One card, face down, amongst all the rest,
which are face up

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.300
Do you want to take it out and have a look?

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:10.399
As if! That's so freaky!
That's so sick! How can you do that?

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:16.980
That's so sick, how did you do that?

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.240
One card, do you want to reach in and take it out?
Turn it over and have a look

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:20.959
OH MY GOD!
hahaha

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.000
How? How?
That's amazing!

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:30.800
hahahaha
What?

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:38.300
OK, I'm really impressed and slightly freaked
out. hahaha

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:46.500
Wa, yeah, OK. That's amazing.
haha, how did you do that? haha

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.000
That's freaky!

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
Was that really what you was thinking of?
Yeah. Really?

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000
Yeah, no, well, I just said it to him
Oh my goodness!

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.890
Before he showed me!
