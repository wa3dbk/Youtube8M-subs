Hi my name is Carlos Ramos Jr. coming to you
on behalf of Expert Village and today we are

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:12.650
talking about a variety of games that you
could played with dice. The next game that

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:17.770
we are going to play is a game called c-lo,
and this has many many variations. It could

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:21.520
get very advance and very complicated, but
I'm just going to give you a very basic it

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:26.910
is a easy version play. Now the players play
against the banker. So everyone is playing

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:37.150
against the banker one person here. Now the
banker rolls three dice first like so. Now

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:41.962
the banker wins all the bets. Everyone puts
the bet down. The banker wins all the bets

00:00:41.962 --> 00:00:49.630
if he throws a 3 of a kind, which he didn't
do here. Any pair in a 6, which he didn't

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:55.470
do if he had another 2 or another 3 or another
6 he would have won or a 4, 5, 6, which he

00:00:55.470 --> 00:01:01.780
didn't do. Now, he loses all the bets if he
throws any pair which there are no pairs in

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:08.319
a 1. So if this was a pair and this was a
one he would have lost or a 1, 2, 3, which

00:01:08.319 --> 00:01:13.950
he didn't do any of those. So if he throws
a pair and any number other then any of these

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:19.340
numbers they we did here or just pretty much
he didn't end up with anything every player

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:27.950
now throws a dice. So I'm a player and I throwing
the die here. Now, it goes and reverse now.

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:34.929
The players win if they throw any pair and
a 1, which we didn't do. No pairs, no ones

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:42.119
or a 1,2,3 again nothing. Player loses if
they throw three of a kind or any pair in

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:51.020
a 6 or a 4 or a 5, 6. 4, 5, 6, I lost. Very
very simple were playing it. Again, it could

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:56.369
get very complicated, but if you keep it very
simple like that the game could be very fun.

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:56.479
C-lo.
