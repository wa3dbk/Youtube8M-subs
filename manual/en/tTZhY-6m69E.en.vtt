Hi, I'm Jennifer Cail and on behalf of Expert
Village I'm going to show you how to make

00:00:06.182 --> 00:00:10.870
a gingerbread house to create your own winter
wonderland. Now what we are going to do is

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:16.450
by using a sharp pearing knife and a spoon
we are going to make various marks in the

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:20.670
cookie dough to show different textures. So
this is a really cool way to make it show

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:27.000
as if your house is made out of brick or wood,
something different that will give it a lot

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.599
of interest visually and it is just going
to look really neat. So what you are going

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:38.960
to do, actually the first thing you can do
is take the roof and you can make it have

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:46.610
a tiled look by taking the bowl of a spoon
and you are going to gently press in the edge

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:55.280
just like this. And you are going to keep
doing it throughout the entire roof so that

00:00:55.280 --> 00:01:04.361
it looks like you have got little tiles that
are making the structure of the roof. And

00:01:04.361 --> 00:01:08.490
you want to do it in an off set pattern so
that they look as if though they are over

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:17.050
lapping just as you would have on a house.
So another technique you can do if you want

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:26.390
to go to one of your wall pieces and you are
going to carefully score the edge with the

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:33.930
knife. Now when you're cutting in all of these
you do not ever want to go all the way through.

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:42.040
You are just lightly scoring the top so that
when it bakes you get those lines. So for

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:49.201
this one we are going to do bricks. And you
also want to have it off set so it looks as

00:01:49.201 --> 00:01:58.100
though the bricks are stacked on top of each
other. Now another thing that you can do is

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.610
make it look as though your house is made
out of wood. And for that it is going to be

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:10.700
similar to your brick effect except you are
going to be going up and down instead of from

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:20.060
side to side. So you are going to have lengthwise
lines cut into your dough. And then to make

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:27.890
the wood ends you are just going to do random
lengths. You don't want them to be to perfect

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:33.610
and you don't want them to match up either.
Cause like in a house if you have wood in

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:41.770
siding or if you are building a house and
you have your nice pieces of lumber that are

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:45.780
being used it is going to be at odd ends.
They are not going to be perfectly aligned

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:51.400
with one another. So these are just some of
the cool ideas that you can do to decorate

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:52.930
your cookie dough before you bake it.
