Spend some time thinking about what you want

Explain a topic?

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:30.250
You’ll want to have a clear focus before
you begin your research.

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:31.320
Step 2.

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.320
Make a list of key words that will be helpful
in locating information when you conduct online

subscriber-only materials, you’ll need to
head to a library.

on your subject.

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:12.600

and organizations.

00:01:24.049 --> 00:01:26.350
Consider interviewing an expert in the field

forget the figures.

results.”

See if there are any documentaries on your
topic.

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:49.130

performed better on reading and writing exams.
