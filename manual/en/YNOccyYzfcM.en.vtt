00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:07.730
hello

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:10.830
I'm here today to give a review of the
Omega Speedmaster Professional

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.679
this is the Sapphire Sandwitch model and
I've had this watch for a year

00:00:14.679 --> 00:00:18.279
so I thought I'd give my impressions the
watch up to this point. Overall I really

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:21.330
enjoyed this watch, and I think it's a great
addition to any watch collection

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:24.510
both because of its historical and
horological value.

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:28.900
I thought this particular vials best
quality was the open

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:33.130
sapphire caseback which allows you to
see the movement this watch is powered

00:00:33.130 --> 00:00:34.100
by Omega

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:39.800
in-house caliber 1863 which is an 18
jewel movement with a manual wind

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.110
and cartographic application it's made
in-house

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.879
and features a 12 hour chronograph with
a jumping minutes had

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:50.539
at the jumping minutes add a lot to the
watches legibility

00:00:50.539 --> 00:00:53.960
the tiles are a little small to read but
having the

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.149
had exactly the minute mark made it
quite a bit more legible

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:00.230
the only thing I thought this movement
really lacked was

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:04.750
the stop seconds function when you go to
set the time the seconds hand is not

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:06.590
automatically lock into place

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:10.560
with a little practice you can get just
read about pressure and you can hold the

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.100
seconds hand in the same position for a
little while

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.750
is usually enough time to get a pretty
accurate sync with the atomic time

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:20.970
with too much pressure though sometimes
I can't handle rollback

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:25.180
Omega services 5 it doesn't damage the
movement but they can build this could

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:26.100
certainly see it

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.810
the 1863 caliber does not have a column
will

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:34.850
but instead has a lever actuated carga
over the residents I will make about

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:36.810
each have had the opportunity to handle

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.090
some these colville chronographs they do
have a much more celeb field in the cam

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:43.250
actually chronograph but

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.320
the cam actuated is much easier to
repair.

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:51.310
The movement is well decorated and
sounds very nice when it's actuated, stopped, and reset.

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:01.960
This  next clip will show a little better view of the
operation of  the chronograph.

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.800
overall the operation the chronograph is
very nice

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:29.080
the chronograph counter does have a
little bit of a jerk emotion sometimes

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.640
but the field to watch micrograph usage
is axel

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.760
it to the second indices of

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.860
really precise timing and the 12-hour
our allows for real I'm

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:46.840
chronograph runs the car crash seconds
return function is very fast

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:52.520
and can be seen here in slow motion cool

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:56.960
all

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:00.530
this watch you superwoman over for some
but %uh since

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:04.370
and is pretty legible and I although
after several hours

00:03:04.370 --> 00:03:08.710
that light source it does get a little
hard to read at some point during your

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:10.020
place the

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:13.300
stainless steel bad but this NATO strap
I thought amid wash them more

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:14.770
comfortable to wear in the summer

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:18.980
and it made it look a little bit more
sporty replacing the strap is pretty

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:19.540
easy

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:23.100
the spring kansas head be compressed
with this tool here and then the

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:25.550
stainless steel bracelet was released a
slide-out

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:30.060
I thought the overall quality of the
stale Sprycel

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:34.420
very high and the route links made the
brakes very comfortable to wear

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:37.550
everything on the bracelets finished and
polished

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:41.209
very well and the links had a nice that
with one another

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:45.110
as you can see the bracelet did into our
little where

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:49.500
it's not the 904 steel like Rolex
carries it's a little softer so it does

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:50.870
get a few scratches out at

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:54.610
but given the where that the watch
experience I think it whether to

00:03:54.610 --> 00:03:59.930
pretty well the palace at the bracelet
give a nice contrast to the brush look

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:06.250
I'll the links and the class that's both
the rest the bracelet connections very

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:08.000
sturdy and has a good solid

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.910
click to it it's open by double pusher
mechanism

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:17.250
which is secure but also makes to watch
pretty easy to take out of

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:21.510
finally you can see the Polish and links
which

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:28.510
connect pretty nicely to the case at the
lodge watch les is nicely on the rest

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:32.750
I whereby a little loose which love to
slide a little bit which I think makes

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:34.699
little more comfortable

00:04:34.699 --> 00:04:36.820
the desired height a lot a lot just like
us

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:40.050
and a dress shirt hewlett over the watch

00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:44.479
42 millimeters to predict watch both the
crowd and correct pressure something

00:04:44.479 --> 00:04:48.680
stock up well aware easy to slide this
watch out of

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:51.889
and the class is quite simple to put on
a terrorist

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:56.400
the spymaster came in this backseat
racist or daily

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:00.990
up because use it has gotten stained and
a little dirty ours time

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:07.990
but overall spare pretty well watch also
came with

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:14.690
keys pictographs at worky here you can
see it help her number

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:19.870
reference number and the future the
watch the

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:22.910
international warranty card has some
other watched civic numbers

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:28.690
