00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:27.100
If I had to rank the best control setups for
a first-person shooter, this damn thing wouldn�t

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:28.140
even make the list.

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.380
Nah, for me, the best way to control a shooter
is with something like the Wii Remote or PlayStation

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:34.380
Move.

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.400
That way, you get the accuracy of a pointer
with the maneuverability of an analog stick.

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.950
Of course, if you�re good at maneuvering
with a keyboard, a simple mouse can�t be

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:42.950
beat.

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:44.800
But you know what else would make my list?

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.170
The Nintendo DS.

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:47.690
Yeah, believe it.

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:51.840
Hand cramps aside, it had a great setup for
first-person shooters.

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.140
It just...didn�t have many first-person
shooters.

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.450
But this one?

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:00.840
This is one of the few, the proud...the shooters
of the Nintendo DS.

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.000
It�s Call of Duty: World at War.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:14.850
Just...maybe ice your palms, after playing.

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:26.990
Now, on its own, World at War is just...an
inherently good handheld shooter.

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:31.990
But the thing that really makes it stand out
on the DS...is the DS itself.

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:35.490
Playing this game with touch just makes all
the difference in the world.

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:41.190
You can get your aim down the pixel, and not
only that...it�s also faster than fumbling

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:42.479
with dual thumbsticks.

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:47.860
It�s really an example of game design totally
benefitting from hardware design.

00:01:47.860 --> 00:02:01.500
Much to the dismay of these poor mofos.

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.080
So the touch screen changes a lot about Call
of Duty.

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:09.069
Some of it�s for the better, like aiming
with the stylus, but a lot of it�s...more

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:10.069
subjective.

00:02:10.069 --> 00:02:14.930
One of the interesting things about World
at War on DS is that...it doesn�t just do

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:15.930
touch aiming.

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:18.140
It pushes touch throughout the experience.

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:23.819
And not all of those ideas hit the target.

00:02:23.819 --> 00:02:32.560
And if you want to see what I�m talking
about, look no further than the touch screen

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:33.560
display.

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.860
This is really where all the action takes
place, in terms of control.

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:39.170
You have a big open area, which is used for
aiming.

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:42.410
But there�s also buttons you can touch to
do certain things.

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:47.610
Reload by tapping your weapon, bring up your
sights by tapping the icon...and that stuff

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:51.060
works alright, despite forcing you to briefly
look away.

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:54.400
But dragging a panel, to change weapons?

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:55.470
Ugh.

00:02:55.470 --> 00:03:02.360
Not as �alright.�

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:07.310
And going back to the subjective...World at
War also throws in lots of little touch minigames.

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:11.950
You might have to defuse a bomb or use Morse
code, and this stuff�s actually kind of

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:13.520
fun the first time around.

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:15.570
But after repeating them?

00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:17.310
It feels more gimmicky than fun.

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:22.200
But again, for better or worse, that stuff
at least gives this multiplatform game its

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.880
own distinct feel on the Nintendo DS.

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:29.670
Now, the gameplay is pretty much what you�d
expect, but...given the hardware�s limitations,

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:33.640
it almost has a gallery shooter feel at times.

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:35.600
Like, the bad guys aren�t very mobile.

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:38.120
They mostly just...pop up, like cutouts.

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:42.310
But it�s still fun, and for what it�s
worth, the game�s actually impressive on

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:43.310
the DS.

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:55.340
The environments are really big, and the graphics
are surprisingly good, given the platform.

00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:04.260
I realize it might not look all that great,
maybe I�m kind of gushing a bit much...but

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:08.210
I�m just so interested in the idea of improving
game control.

00:04:08.210 --> 00:04:12.319
And not just changing it to be different,
but actually making it better.

00:04:12.319 --> 00:04:18.370
A lot of things about the DS and the Wii were
gimmicky changes just to be different...but

00:04:18.370 --> 00:04:20.090
some really were improvements.

00:04:20.090 --> 00:04:23.740
On the Nintendo DS, World at War is certainly
different to be different.

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:36.129
But in some ways, it was also different to
be better.
