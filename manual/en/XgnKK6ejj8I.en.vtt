Hi, I'm Linda.

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:05.200
I created a company called Paint Along.

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.450
Check us out at paintalongnyc.com.

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:14.040
We have really fun painting workshops in Nashville
and New York.

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.900
The first thing we want to do is establish
our horizon line.

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:22.380
I am gonna start with my purple paint and
i'm using a 1 inch flat brush and i'm just

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:28.019
gonna put a soft wavy line going across the
canvas and next i'm gonna put the sky in,

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:30.359
using some blue and some white.

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:35.489
This is phthalo blue and i'm gonna put the
darkest blue at the top of the canvas that's

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:40.650
closest to us , were gonna fade down to white
as it gets towards the horizon line, that

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:44.370
makes the sky look like its receding and going
backwards.

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:51.120
So this is the blue , the phthalo blue i'm
gonna empty my brush out onto the canvas and

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.160
this will serve as a mixing surface , i'm
gonna pickup some white with my brush without

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:00.859
washing it cause i want the blue to blend
into the white and i'm gonna take the white

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:05.140
right up into this blue and it gives me a
beautiful sky color.

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:09.560
Working the two colors back and forth together
with a soft running motion.

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:15.080
So i get towards the top of the mountains,
i'm just gonna try to match the top line of

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:20.580
the mountains with my brush stroke one up
and down to give it an uneven horizon line.

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:27.360
Now were gonna do the ground portion of the
landscape and its kind of the opposite approach

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.710
where you can have the lightest colors towards
the horizon line and then your gonna have

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.220
more color saturation, as you get towards
the bottom of the canvas which is actually

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:37.520
visually closer to us.

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:42.080
I'm gonna start with a yellow ochre color
and i'm gonna come right bellow our little

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:52.140
mountain line, i'm gonna add a little bit
of white in the background so that its a little

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:58.000
bit faded out and I think i'l put a little
bit of green in there too and this green is

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.750
gonna be in the very foreground.

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:04.780
I'm still blending the colors together you'll
have sort of a brownish tone in there which

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:09.979
is good for landscape , the next thing i'd
like to do is demonstrate a tree and were

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:17.400
going to start with the 1 half inch flat brush
, i'm gonna use the brown paint , i'm gonna

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:22.170
start with the brush very flat and just pull
up and as i get up, i'm gonna kind of twist

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:26.220
it just a little bit so the tree trunk can
get narrower, narrow as we go up , next i'm

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:40.660
gonna add some roots and some branches, the
next thing i'd like to demonstrate is the

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:47.390
leaves of the tree , starting with some green
paint in just a tapping motion and i'm also

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:53.170
gonna add some lighter green paint on top
to give it a little bit more dimension and

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:55.200
those are some basic landscape tips.
