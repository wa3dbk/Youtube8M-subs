00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:09.630
Alright! We're going to paint our quickie
painting today and I call it that because

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:16.630
it takes like 2 or 3 minutes to paint. Now,
I have the canvass on the wall. You either

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:24.289
want to put it on the wall or on an easel.
We're going to be using gravity today to

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:25.910
help us paint our painting.

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:31.369
So let's go ahead and get started. You're
going to need your specialty tool, the angled

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:38.369
spatula that I asked you to get and your also
going to need your water bottle with a little

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:45.530
water, you're going to need some black paint,
some white paint and another color. I am using

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:51.559
cad red today, so you can use cad red if you
like.

00:00:51.559 --> 00:00:58.559
The first step in the process is to load up
some black paint onto our angled spatula.

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:08.239
So we'll be putting the paint on this side,
okay? Just hold it level and pour some paint

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:17.440
on there. Let's see, maybe I can get this
in the camera. Now we don't want to put

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:25.690
too much black but we want to put just enough,
that may be a little more than I wanted, thatï¿½s

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:36.210
okay. Can you see it there? Can you see it?
That's about how much you want on your spatula

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:45.180
and come over here and we start about the
center there. Now a lot of this has to do

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.950
with pressure, as you can see I had the spatula up there but just barely on there. 

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:56.700
You don't want to leave the painting on one location,

00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:02.440
you just kind of pull it down and bring it up,

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:09.440
okay? I actually didn't have as much paint
as I thought I did so I'm going to put a

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:16.539
little bit more paint. Alright, that's good.

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:27.599
Now, I might not have mentioned it but I always
keep paper towels handy because we're going

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:34.700
to be using them a lot. So we wipe the spatula off 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.230
and we come over here and we load it up,

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:56.400
we load it up with our white paint. This time
we get more than we did with the black, okay?

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:04.600
We don't line it up exactly where the black
was, come up here, just pulling it through

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:13.200
the black, down and out. Okay?

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:19.689
Now this would go a little bit quicker if
I wasn't demonstrating it. Now we load up

00:03:19.689 --> 00:03:25.480
our red paint and we really want a lot of
it on there, about three times as much as

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:32.480
the black we had. Alright! As you can see
that's quite a bit of paint on there. Come

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:41.150
back over here for the third time, start it
right below there, maybe off a little bit

00:03:41.439 --> 00:03:45.819
this side like this so we don't want to
do the same exact stroke that's done, up

00:03:45.819 --> 00:03:49.069
through there and through.

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:56.069
Now we take our squirt bottle and start making
some water run through this design. 

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:26.889
You can manipulate those lines by adding more water.

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:35.600
You want to make sure you have this  adjusted for a mist and not a spray, okay?

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.530
 You can
spray above it, so it'll rundown through

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:51.980
there like that and pull more color with it.

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:09.040
Now the gravity's still doing its work so
the painting is still painting if you

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:15.480
will, it's not through doing what it's
going to do but we're done touching it okay?

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:17.880
That completes our painting for today.

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:23.120
I hope you enjoyed it. If you have any questions,
please contact me and I'll get back to you

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:24.100
as soon as possible.
