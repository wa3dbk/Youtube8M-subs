00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:07.410
What is up guys?

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:08.559
Shizno here.

00:00:08.559 --> 00:00:12.039
Welcome to the 4th episode of my Elder Scrolls
Lore series.

00:00:12.039 --> 00:00:18.610
Originally, I wanted this episode to be specifically
about Imperials and then move on other races

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:23.420
further in the series, but then I realized,
that we should probably first talk about how

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:28.670
the races are divided, so that you can understand
everything better.

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:33.150
I am going to name a lot of races that you
might have never heard about, but I will talk

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:37.470
about those later in the series, so dont let
that bother you right now.

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:39.070
So- lets get started.

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:43.239
There are four main racial groups in TES series.

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:46.710
Mer, Human, Akaviri and Beast races.

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.540
Mer is a group of races, which can also be
called elves.

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:57.030
The word "Mer" comes from the ancient Aldmeri
language and means "person" or "us."

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:06.180
Its use by the elves is similar to our use
of the word "man", by which we describe any

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:09.990
human of any gender or skin color.

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:14.380
Various elvish races have different opinions
on how they were created, but none of them

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:19.660
consider the mortal life as a gift and many
of them actually think, that they are descendants

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:25.720
of Aedra who lost their immortality during
the creation of the planet Nirn.

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:31.399
The elvish races usually live longer than
other races and are better attuned to the

00:01:31.399 --> 00:01:33.440
use of magic.

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:38.940
The races in this group are:
Aldmer, Altmer, Ayleid, Bosmer, Chimer, Dunmer,

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:42.850
Dwemer, Falmer, Maormer and Orsimer.

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:48.690
I am not surprised, if this reminded you of
the trailer for the movie Hobbit.

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:54.770
I am also not going to make another Lore video
until someone posts a video response naming

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:59.030
all the elven races from top of their head.

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:05.849
Anyway, Bretons could also be considered to
be elves, because they are a mixture of elves

00:02:05.849 --> 00:02:09.920
and men, but they are usually categorized
as men.

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:14.900
Speaking of men, the group of races called
man or human, has no written account of their

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:16.310
origin.

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:21.640
They have evolved after the elvish races have,
but no one knows exactly how they came to

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:26.610
be, because the human races invented writing
much later.

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:35.690
The human races are: Breton, Imperial, Nede,
Nord, Redguard, Orma and Kothringi.

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:40.560
The third group of races are bestial races.

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:46.530
These differ from the elven and human races
by the structure of their body and their metabolism.

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:54.320
The races in this group are: Argonians, Sloan,
Imga, Lilmothiit and the best fucking race

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:55.720
ever- Khajits.

00:02:55.720 --> 00:03:02.420
The books in the Elder Scrolls games also
reference to a race called Hist.

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:06.900
It is hard to classify them though, because
it is not clear weather they are sentient

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:09.460
beings or trees.

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:11.090
Yep.

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:17.730
The best minds of Tamriel cannot decide weather
they are regular trees or thinking trees.

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:20.880
The last racial group is called Akaviri.

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:26.350
Akaviri or Akavir, who knows whats the proper
form of the word, are a group of races living

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:28.460
on the continent of Akavir.

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:33.490
Not much is known about them, because people
of Tamriel dont visit the other continent

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:35.100
too often.

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:38.150
However, we know that they speak Akaviri.

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:44.930
They consist of various types of races, both
man and beast, but some sources indicate,

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:48.730
that the beast races have already taken care
of the human ones.

00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:52.630
Once again, no one knows for sure.

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:59.520
Races in this group are: Kamal, Tsaesci, Ka
Po' Tun, Tang Mo and Dragons.

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:05.240
Yes, it seems that Dragons originally came
from the Akavir continent and only later settled

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:08.900
in Skyrim and various other places across
Tamriel.

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:14.520
Once again, the purpose of this video is only
to distinguish between the races and to show

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:17.370
you the richness of the Elder Scrolls lore.

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:23.190
So, next time we WILL talk about Imperials.

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:24.400
Thank you for watching.

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:27.630
Make sure you Rape content and subside.

00:04:27.630 --> 00:04:31.350
Whatever that means.

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:32.350
Thanks again.

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:32.790
Bye!
