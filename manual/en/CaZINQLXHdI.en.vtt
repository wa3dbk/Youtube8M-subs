00:00:00.831 --> 00:00:09.024
(lighthearted music)
Anthony: Cuckoo, cuckoo.

00:00:09.024 --> 00:00:13.822
(bird song) (up beat music) Anthony: I'm
Anthony Anderson and I'm on a mission

00:00:13.822 --> 00:00:22.639
to find the best home cooks
in America. (lively music)

00:00:22.639 --> 00:00:24.223
Anthony: I'm in the
beautiful mid western plains.

00:00:24.223 --> 00:00:25.719
Where are we again?

00:00:25.719 --> 00:00:27.335
Stage hand: Cedar Rapids, man.

00:00:27.335 --> 00:00:31.234
Anthony: Oh, okay, Cedar Rapids, Iowa
where there's no body of water but,

00:00:31.234 --> 00:00:34.514
we're going to cook seafood
linguini from an award-winning

00:00:34.514 --> 00:00:37.248
recipe by engineer Craig Hazelbaker.

00:00:37.248 --> 00:00:45.510
Lassie!!! (lively music)

00:00:45.510 --> 00:00:47.022
Scene 2A, take one.

00:00:47.022 --> 00:00:51.399
Craig: We're going to pan sear some
scallops and make some garlic shrimp

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:53.807
to go with it, but it's going
to be over a bed of linquini

00:00:53.807 --> 00:00:56.183
with brandied cream sauce.

00:00:56.183 --> 00:00:57.518
Anthony: Brandied cream sauce?

00:00:57.518 --> 00:01:00.638
Craig: Yes, and that reduced
brandy's going to help bring out the

00:01:00.638 --> 00:01:03.015
natural sweetness in the scallops.

00:01:03.015 --> 00:01:04.022
Anthony: Must we reduce the brandy?

00:01:04.022 --> 00:01:04.894
Craig: Yes.

00:01:04.894 --> 00:01:06.758
Anthony: Can we leave the
alcohol content in it?

00:01:06.758 --> 00:01:08.399
Craig: I can pour you a
little something on the side.

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:09.560
Anthony: Sounds like a plan to me.

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.447
Craig: Okay. (lively music)

00:01:12.447 --> 00:01:15.311
Craig: I also work in engineering,
so you're going to find me doing some

00:01:15.311 --> 00:01:17.134
rather obsessive-compulsive things.

00:01:17.134 --> 00:01:18.242
Anthony: Such as?

00:01:18.242 --> 00:01:21.655
Craig: Using an infrared
thermometer and an instant read

00:01:21.655 --> 00:01:26.767
thermometer on the
scallops. (lively music)

00:01:26.767 --> 00:01:29.406
Anthony: This recipe that we have,
I understand, is award-winning.

00:01:29.406 --> 00:01:34.639
Craig: One of the local grocery stores,
Hy-Vee, has a seafood recipe contest.

00:01:34.639 --> 00:01:36.767
My girlfriend Diane encouraged me.

00:01:36.767 --> 00:01:40.166
When I'm less generous I'll say
she nagged me into entering it.

00:01:40.166 --> 00:01:43.879
Anthony: Shh, you know she's
right in the next room?

00:01:43.879 --> 00:01:45.126
Craig: I do, I know, I do.

00:01:45.126 --> 00:01:48.166
She has heavy things to pick and throw
at me too, so I got to watch that.

00:01:48.166 --> 00:01:51.902
(lively music) You want a good sear on it.

00:01:51.902 --> 00:01:53.182
Anthony: Um-hum.

00:01:53.182 --> 00:01:55.599
Craig: We'll see how hot
this thing's getting here.

00:01:55.599 --> 00:02:03.582
It says 392 degrees Fahrenheit,
that's pretty warm. (lively music)

00:02:03.582 --> 00:02:06.110
Put a good knob of butter
over there in that last pan.

00:02:06.110 --> 00:02:07.551
That's too hot.

00:02:07.551 --> 00:02:08.702
Anthony: Yeah, how do we ...

00:02:08.702 --> 00:02:10.159
Craig: Yeah, I'm going to
get another pan for you.

00:02:10.159 --> 00:02:12.655
Anthony: Hold on, hold on,hold on,
let's see, let's see how hot it is.

00:02:12.655 --> 00:02:13.351
Craig: Hot stuff.

00:02:13.351 --> 00:02:15.391
Anthony: Four hundred,
four hundred and four.

00:02:15.391 --> 00:02:16.478
Craig: Four hundred, no.

00:02:16.478 --> 00:02:17.670
Anthony: Too hot.

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:18.766
Craig: Too hot, too hot.

00:02:18.766 --> 00:02:23.126
Anthony: (singing) Oh, it's
too hot. (lively music)

00:02:23.126 --> 00:02:25.174
Anthony: See they're going to
flambe, I almost lost an eyebrow.

00:02:25.174 --> 00:02:28.734
(lively music) Craig: Yeah,
see how this is doing here.

00:02:28.734 --> 00:02:31.029
That'll do.

00:02:31.029 --> 00:02:32.888
Anthony: I got to check and make sure now.

00:02:32.888 --> 00:02:35.133
Oh, my God.

00:02:35.133 --> 00:02:36.473
Craig: There we go, you see.

00:02:36.473 --> 00:02:44.037
Anthony: I could eat a bowl of
this by myself. (lively music)

00:02:44.037 --> 00:02:45.965
Craig: You see how I just kind
of like the different shapes?

00:02:45.965 --> 00:02:46.621
Anthony: Yeah.

00:02:46.621 --> 00:02:48.333
Craig: Put a little dollop
here and there, you know.

00:02:48.333 --> 00:02:50.465
Anthony: I'm not mad at the presentatiaon.

00:02:50.465 --> 00:02:50.925
Craig: You're not mad at it?

00:02:50.925 --> 00:02:53.607
Anthony: No, my vernacular's
from the inner city.

00:02:53.607 --> 00:02:56.003
We say, "Not mad at it."

00:02:56.003 --> 00:02:58.092
Craig: I'm from the inner city
of Dillon, Montana, how's that?

00:02:58.092 --> 00:03:03.347
Anthony: Ha, ha, ha, ha. (lively music)

00:03:03.347 --> 00:03:05.188
Craig: Now this is a family
show, but a nice Pinot Gris

00:03:05.188 --> 00:03:07.894
would go with this so well.

00:03:07.894 --> 00:03:09.125
Anthony: Families drink Pinot Gris.

00:03:09.125 --> 00:03:10.908
Craig: Then we're going to
get it out then aren't we?

00:03:10.908 --> 00:03:16.948
Anthony: What is he talking
about? (lively music)

00:03:16.948 --> 00:03:19.203
Now tell me, how long have
you been playing the bagpipes?

00:03:19.203 --> 00:03:20.323
Craig: Something like 46 years.

00:03:20.323 --> 00:03:21.144
Anthony: Forty-six years?

00:03:21.144 --> 00:03:22.076
Craig: Forty-six years.

00:03:22.076 --> 00:03:27.268
Anthony: You know what, I think we need to
get in our dinner formals. (bagpipe music)

00:03:27.268 --> 00:03:28.013
Anthony: Craig, you know what?

00:03:28.013 --> 00:03:28.515
Craig: What?

00:03:28.515 --> 00:03:32.143
Anthony: It never fails; every time
I put on a kilt, this music plays.

00:03:32.143 --> 00:03:33.468
Craig: I thought it was just me.

00:03:33.468 --> 00:03:36.307
(bagpipe music) Craig: I'm
anxious to know what you think.

00:03:36.307 --> 00:03:40.904
Anthony: This brandied cream
sauce, I love the flavor on it;

00:03:40.904 --> 00:03:42.276
I love the texture of it.

00:03:42.276 --> 00:03:44.700
I've been eating scallops
while you were getting dressed.

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:48.332
These scallops are
delicious. (lively drums)

00:03:48.332 --> 00:03:49.324
What got you involved in cooking?

00:03:49.324 --> 00:03:50.307
Craig:It was my mother.

00:03:50.307 --> 00:03:53.124
I remember one time, she looked
at me the in the kitchen.

00:03:53.124 --> 00:03:54.897
She said, "Son, learn how to cook."

00:03:54.897 --> 00:03:58.348
"Two reasons, one, you never know
how long you're going to be single."

00:03:58.348 --> 00:04:01.603
"Two, women love a man
who knows how to cook."

00:04:01.603 --> 00:04:02.896
That, that sold me right there.

00:04:02.896 --> 00:04:04.091
Anthony: Excuse me one second.

00:04:04.091 --> 00:04:05.284
Diane, is that true?

00:04:05.284 --> 00:04:06.723
Diane: That's true.

00:04:06.723 --> 00:04:11.788
Anthony: Ha, ha, ha, ha. (lively music)

00:04:11.788 --> 00:04:14.307
Anthony: Craig, I want to thank you
for inviting us into your home today.

00:04:14.307 --> 00:04:15.604
Craig: It was a lot of
fun, it was a lot of fun.

00:04:15.604 --> 00:04:17.093
Anthony:This was some of
the best food that I've had.

00:04:17.093 --> 00:04:18.355
You got pretty legs up under your kilt.

00:04:18.355 --> 00:04:20.507
Craig: Diane, do I have
pretty legs up under my kilt?

00:04:20.507 --> 00:04:21.076
Diane: Yes.

00:04:21.076 --> 00:04:22.308
Anthony: Are mine prettier, Diane?

00:04:22.308 --> 00:04:24.243
Diane: Yes.

00:04:24.243 --> 00:04:30.229
Anthony: Ah, ha, ha, ha, you got a
smart woman like I said. (lively music)

00:04:30.229 --> 00:04:35.981
(clapper) Anthony: Wait a minute,
I didn't take my drawers off.

00:04:35.981 --> 00:04:39.084
You're not supposed to wear
drawers when you're wearing a kilt.

00:04:39.084 --> 00:04:43.084
Yeah, I'll leave them on though,
I'll leave them on. (wooshing)
