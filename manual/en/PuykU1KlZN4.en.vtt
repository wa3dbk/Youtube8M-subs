00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:09.190
Print Place specializes in

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:11.910
high quality, quick turn,

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:14.290 position:70%
one hundred percent offset postcard printing.

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:20.210
From the moment your

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:21.370
order is sent to press,

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:23.340 position:56%
a team of qualified printing experts

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:24.880
begin producing your order.

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:27.760 position:59%
First, our art technicians review your

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:29.520
job for several aspects, such

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:32.790 position:73%
as size, embedded fonts, resolution and bleeds.

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:35.210 position:58%
Once your artwork passes this review,

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:36.920
your job is passed onto pre-press.

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:40.080
The pre-press technician's job is

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.350 position:81%
to assemble orders from maximum printing efficiency.

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:44.800
Yours as well as multiple costumers

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:46.760
jobs are grouped together from

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.440
property such as paper stock,

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:50.930 position:61%
size, quantity, and processing options.

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:57.210
Several costumers orders are placed

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.140 position:69%
into a single group for greatest efficiency.

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:06.960 position:64%
Once assembled, jobs are sent to plating.

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:11.390
Here, the plate maker sends

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:13.930 position:73%
each job to a thermal infrared imaging machine.

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.280
Aluminum plates, containing an

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.480
infrared sensitive emulsion, load

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:24.120 position:97%
into the plate setter, where it wraps around the imaging drum.

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.250
The drum at a dizzying

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:27.830
1,000 rpm's as an

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.840 position:73%
infrared laser exposes an image onto the plate.

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:35.000 position:97%
From there, the now exposed aluminum plate moves to the processor.

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:37.600
A four-step treatment is applied:

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:40.210
developer chemical, water, buffing,

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:42.200 position:67%
and gumming for further scratch protection.

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:47.120
A plate for each color

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.780 position:91%
in the CMYK profile are printed for transfer to the press.

00:01:54.730 --> 00:01:56.930
PrintPlace utilizes three Komori

00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:59.010 position:75%
offset printing presses for all of our printing.

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.710
Maxed out, the Komori press

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:04.470 position:69%
can print a stunning 16,000 sheets per hour.

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:07.260
The Pressman takes the

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:08.890
aluminum plates, and hangs them

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:10.280
on ink units of each

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:29.750
corresponding color. Blank sheets

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:30.820
are fed from the back

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:32.640
of the machine series of

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:34.750
conveyers and rollers rapidly shoot

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.810
each sheet under cyan, magenta,

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:38.740
yellow, and black ink units.

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:41.160
The rollers evenly distribute ink

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:42.750
to the plates which offsets

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:44.090
the ink to a blanket roller,

00:02:44.380 --> 00:02:46.280 position:61%
that in turn, applies ink to the paper.

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:48.460
Coated sheets are then fed

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:50.050
through our aqueous coating unit

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:51.920
and run across heating elements for

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:58.100
drying. Every few

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:00.790 position:88%
hundred sheets, the pressman pulls a sheet for analysis.

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:05.340 position:97%
He scans a color bar along the bottom edge for color accuracy.

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.220 position:97%
Visual inspection is also needed to check for highest quality.

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:14.310
After printing, the

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:17.940
sheets move to the cutter.

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:21.520
A large industrial cutting machine

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:23.180
slices up to 1,000 sheets.

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:33.970
Each job is then

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:37.380 position:98%
separated for transfer to their particular finishing processes.

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.520 position:61%
Once cut, your postcards go to mailing.

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:44.760
Before shipping, the specified

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:46.730
addresses are printed onto each

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:48.290
card using an ink jetting machine.

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:54.340
The worker loads your postcards.

00:03:58.270 --> 00:03:59.640
Once running, a conveyer pulls

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:02.520 position:80%
each card rapidly under two high-speed print heads.

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:04.570
A heating coil then dries

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:19.540
the printed addresses. The result,

00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:21.910
a high quality, quick-turn brochure

00:04:22.370 --> 00:04:24.270 position:66%
ready for mailing to your customer's door.
