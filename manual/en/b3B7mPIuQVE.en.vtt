00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:10.350
We're going to talk a little bit about digital
camera lenses or just camera lenses in general.

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:16.789
Now, any DSLR camera, which stand for Digital
Single Lens Reflex with the word lens in there,

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:19.269
has a lens that affixes to the front of the
camera.

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:20.269
Something kind of like this.

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:21.609
This happens to be a wide angle lens.

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:24.279
There are many, many, many different kinds
of lenses.

00:00:24.279 --> 00:00:31.300
This one in particular zooms from the focal
length of 17 millimeters, which is quite wide,

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.579
into a focal length of 35 millimeters.

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:35.109
Now there's other lenses out there.

00:00:35.109 --> 00:00:37.610
This would be great for shooting something
like rock and roll.

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:41.859
This, on the other hand, is a 70 to 200 millimeter
lens.

00:00:41.859 --> 00:00:45.530
This is better for stuff like fast action
sports, football.

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:49.289
Now, not all lenses zoom like the two I just
showed you.

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.950
This one over here is just a fixed focal 85
millimeter lens.

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:55.910
Really good for portrait photography.

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:01.109
So this vast number of lenses gives you a
lot of options in terms of what you're shooting

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:02.420
to get the kind of look that you want.

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:06.430
It's just going to be a nice tight crop with
no distortion.

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:12.150
Whereas this wide angle lens is going to have
a lot of distortion, but you get a lot in

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:13.150
the frame.

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:19.580
So like I said, all digital SLR cameras need
a lens to take pictures otherwise you just

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:21.900
have a mirror and a sensor in there.

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:28.640
Simply take your lens, remove the caps, and
attach it on.

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.280
And that's one of the nice things about digital
photography if you have an SLR, is you can

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.570
switch your lenses out.

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.210
Whereas, if you're using a point-and-shoot
camera, the lens is fixed and you obviously

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:39.210
can't remove it.

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.810
So when you take a picture, what the lens
physically does is there's multiple elements

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:48.280
inside of this and those elements bring the
light in, obviously into focus, and direct

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.030
it back into the sensor that's behind the
mirror.

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.030
That's how you get your image.

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.460
The better the lens quality, the better the
image is going to look.

00:01:55.460 --> 00:02:00.890
Finer lenses, more expensive lenses have just
better ground glass with better coatings that

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:04.790
help get rid of lens flair, chromatic aberration.

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:10.119
And that's just a couple of basics about lenses
for digital SLRs.
