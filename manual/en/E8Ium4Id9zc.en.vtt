00:00:00.284 --> 00:00:01.117
- Hey, what's up?

00:00:01.117 --> 00:00:02.084
Sean here with Think Media TV.

00:00:02.084 --> 00:00:03.911
And just wanted to take
you behind the scenes

00:00:03.911 --> 00:00:05.569
on a quick shoot we did right here

00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:08.152
for some home curriculum stuff.

00:00:09.031 --> 00:00:10.461
- Hello, I'm so glad that you

00:00:10.461 --> 00:00:13.684
are part of groups this semester.

00:00:13.684 --> 00:00:16.335
Whether you are at your house or maybe out

00:00:16.335 --> 00:00:18.212
and about somewhere at a coffee shop,

00:00:18.212 --> 00:00:19.944
gathering with some friends.

00:00:19.944 --> 00:00:22.272
And as usual, anything we
talk about in this video

00:00:22.272 --> 00:00:23.703
and stuff will be in
the description below,

00:00:23.703 --> 00:00:25.005
so you can check out links down there

00:00:25.005 --> 00:00:26.250
and things like that.

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.907
And if you have any questions
leave them in the comments.

00:00:28.907 --> 00:00:30.801
Okay, so check it out.

00:00:30.801 --> 00:00:32.117
We have a two camera shoot here.

00:00:32.117 --> 00:00:36.884
We are shooting with a
Cannon 60D and a Cannon 7D.

00:00:36.884 --> 00:00:39.631
And honestly, you can
pretty much swap these out

00:00:39.631 --> 00:00:41.487
for any camera and get the same results,

00:00:41.487 --> 00:00:45.573
like a T2i or T3i or a
T4i, save a little money.

00:00:45.573 --> 00:00:48.121
Then we have a zoom lens,
and this is a primary angle.

00:00:48.121 --> 00:00:50.267
It's a 17-50 and we are running it

00:00:50.267 --> 00:00:53.871
at about 40 millimeters
to get our wider shot.

00:00:53.871 --> 00:00:56.772
And then we've got a
50 millimeter lens here

00:00:56.772 --> 00:00:58.406
on the 7D for our second angle.

00:00:58.406 --> 00:01:00.680
So we have a wide shot and a tight shot.

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:02.466
And then we do all of our audio with

00:01:02.466 --> 00:01:04.689
a wireless Sennheiser setup to the mic

00:01:04.689 --> 00:01:06.173
that Omar has over there.

00:01:06.173 --> 00:01:09.439
And then we've got the Zoom
H4n that goes directly in.

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:12.258
I did another post about how
we actually can monitor the

00:01:12.258 --> 00:01:16.214
audio live as well as capture
the audio straight into

00:01:16.214 --> 00:01:19.262
the camera and adjust the
levels on the Zoom H4n.

00:01:19.262 --> 00:01:21.556
One thing that I absolutely
love when I shoot

00:01:21.556 --> 00:01:24.090
is this quick release system by Manfrotto.

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:27.431
The nice thing about it is
I put these plates on top of

00:01:27.431 --> 00:01:30.765
these other plates and I
put it across the board,

00:01:30.765 --> 00:01:34.465
whether I'm using a
slider, tripod, monopod,

00:01:34.465 --> 00:01:37.006
and then the same plates
just goes across the gear

00:01:37.006 --> 00:01:39.465
on all cameras, clicks on really fast,

00:01:39.465 --> 00:01:41.716
and is a super fast, it's
the rapid release system.

00:01:41.716 --> 00:01:43.258
So if you've never heard about that

00:01:43.258 --> 00:01:45.008
it's a cool thing I
learned from Philip Bloom

00:01:45.008 --> 00:01:47.072
and love that system.

00:01:47.072 --> 00:01:48.467
And a couple tripods,

00:01:48.467 --> 00:01:50.280
and then the last thing is the lighting.

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.633
We just used a couple
stands and some LED lights

00:01:54.633 --> 00:01:56.897
to match daylight color temperature.

00:01:56.897 --> 00:01:59.457
We shot a few hours ago so
the room was full of daylight

00:01:59.457 --> 00:02:01.940
and we just used these to add

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:05.083
some fill light to the subject.

00:02:05.083 --> 00:02:07.135
Then we also had, for this shoot,

00:02:07.135 --> 00:02:09.213
just like a taking points so it helped.

00:02:09.213 --> 00:02:11.069
We just wrote those, so
not like word for word,

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:13.072
but just points to hit during the shoot.

00:02:13.072 --> 00:02:17.239
And we also did a iPad app for
how long the shoot was going.

00:02:18.450 --> 00:02:21.365
And also we have our
staging charging station.

00:02:21.365 --> 00:02:22.806
We do research on the laptop,

00:02:22.806 --> 00:02:25.181
we charge up the extra batteries

00:02:25.181 --> 00:02:27.616
for the LED lights right here,

00:02:27.616 --> 00:02:31.533
as well as backup batteries
for the 7D and 60D.

00:02:32.617 --> 00:02:36.938
Plus plan, prep, notes, keep it organized.

00:02:36.938 --> 00:02:38.200
So hey, that's the gear setup.

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:39.407
If you have any questions about it

00:02:39.407 --> 00:02:41.129
leave them in the comments below.

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:42.459

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:43.707

00:02:43.707 --> 00:02:46.055

make sure you like the video.

00:02:46.055 --> 00:02:47.193
