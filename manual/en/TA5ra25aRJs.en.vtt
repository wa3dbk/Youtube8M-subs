Hi! I’m Melanie McLeroy with Taurus Training
for Expert Village and today we’re going

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:09.790
to talk about puppies. Now it’s time to
teach this little puppy how to stay. Now puppies

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:15.310
don’t have a real long attention span so
be patient and move slowly. What you want

00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:21.070
to do is teach the puppy to sit or lie down
and then have them do that command for progressively

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:26.970
longer periods of time. Barto has offered
me a down. Now a lot of people like to use

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.749
a hand signal when they say the word stay
that can help the dog, because it’s a visual

00:00:31.749 --> 00:00:37.350
signal. You can also just make stay inherent
in the command. With this puppy I’m going

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:48.960
to go ahead and teach him the stay. Stay.
I’m going to gradually introduce some distractions…

00:00:48.960 --> 00:01:00.320
and make sure I have my treats ready… uh,
now there I had to do a no reward marker because

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:12.720
he broke when he saw the cheese and getting
back into his down, good, stay, so we know

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:17.280
up that the crinkling in the cheese wrapper
is a little too much of a distraction for

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.210
him at this point. So I’m going to have
him prepare myself by having enough ready

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:26.720
for him. You always want to set your dog up
to succeed. Don’t make things too difficult

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:37.340
at first or you will only have failure. Down.
Good. When he looks up, sit, good, down. This

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:45.880
puppy is brilliant. Stay, good, good. Now
there I marked when he made eye contact because

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:50.110
that was very nice. What I also learned from
the last two interactions with him when he

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:55.310
broke the stay command is that I need to reinforce
more quickly. I just made that same mistake

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:05.590
again. No freebies. Sit, good, down, good.
Notice there are two I said the down command

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:09.340
a little bit more quickly than I’ve done
it in the past, it’s because I can tell

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:18.800
he’s catching on. Stay, good. Again, gradual
distractions, giving reinforcement often enough

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:25.599
that he stays down, then you make the reinforcement
periods longer and longer in between and that’s

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:27.560
how this puppy will learn how to stay.
