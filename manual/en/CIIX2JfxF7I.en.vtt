00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:06.130
Dr. Bowden: My name is Dr. Jonny Bowden.

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:07.450
I'm a board-certified nutritionist.

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:09.469
I also have a master's degree in psychology.

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:13.559
I've written 14 books, and my passion is helping
people feel good about themselves and having

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:14.760
a great life.

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:20.680
Unleash Your Thin is our first diet program
ever in 14 books of writing about diets and

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:25.529
telling people how to make sense of diet programs
and what makes sense and what doesn't and

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:27.369
what's a myth and what isn't.

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:31.850
It's the first time that I've actually put
a program together with my own name on it.

00:00:31.850 --> 00:00:35.610
What it does that's a little bit different
than any other diet program I've ever done

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:42.129
or that I've ever seen is that it looks at
an aspect of weight loss that tends to get

00:00:42.129 --> 00:00:44.852
neglected in a lot of the other programs.

00:00:44.852 --> 00:00:50.280
See, people don't do what they're supposed
to do, not because they don't have the information.

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:54.230
I have never met a person in my life who was
smoking cigarettes because they didn't get

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:55.589
the memo about lung cancer.

00:00:55.589 --> 00:01:00.250
I've never met someone and said to them, "Do
you know those things cause cancer?" and they

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:01.250
go, "My God.

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:03.800
Nobody ever told me," and they take their
Marlboros and throw them out.

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.490
So clearly, there's another aspect to this.

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:11.430
Most people know what they need to do to accomplish
anything, whether it's stopping smoking, losing

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.830
weight, getting healthy, going to college,
getting a divorce.

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:16.860
They know what the steps are.

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:21.850
What stops them is some belief that they can't
accomplish this.

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:26.420
Some other thing gets in the way, and what
Unleash Your Thin does, it spends at least

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:29.640
one-third of the time talking about that other
thing.

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.440
What stops you from doing what you know would
really work for you and get you where you

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:35.440
want to go?

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:38.850
In the case of food, it has a lot to do with
addiction.

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:40.070
We're addicted to food.

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:43.850
We're addicted to the foods that make us that
tired, sick, and depressed.

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:46.840
These foods have been engineered in very clever
ways.

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:52.310
Scientists actually overlay these foods with
precise layers of the types of things, like

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:56.950
salt, fat, and sugar, that literally light
up our brain chemistry and get our dopamine

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:01.590
neurons firing so that we feel craving and
we feel we have to have these foods.

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.780
Will power really only goes so far with that.

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:07.680
Will power is kind of ... It'll get you so
far, but it's kind of like holding onto a

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:08.800
ledge with your fingernails.

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:10.900
Eventually, you're going to let go.

00:02:10.900 --> 00:02:15.040
What we do in Unleash Your Thin is we talk
about why these foods have the kind of hold

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.599
they have over us, why when you walk into
a food court and you smell a Cinnabon, you

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:20.599
must have it.

00:02:20.599 --> 00:02:23.999
You cannot say no to it, or it's very hard
to say no to it.

00:02:23.999 --> 00:02:28.349
We work on those kinds of associations that
we have to food that make them addictive.

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:33.670
We try to break that down and actually reprogram
our brain so that we are not the victim of

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:39.249
these cravings, but instead, have some mastery
over them.

00:02:39.249 --> 00:02:43.450
Everybody has different trigger foods, so
rather than just give a list of these are

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:49.180
the foods you should never eat, which, by
the way, we do, but for most people there

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.680
are certain foods that are like their triggers
foods.

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.290
You just can't say no to these.

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:57.209
These are the ones that are just going to
derail you no matter what.

00:02:57.209 --> 00:03:01.129
We do a lot of individual work in Unleash
Your Thin where people actually identify what

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:02.829
those foods are for them.

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:04.760
What are the foods they can't say no to?

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:08.849
We talk a lot about things like wheat and
grains, which are bad for a lot of people,

00:03:08.849 --> 00:03:10.319
but not for everybody.

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:15.969
We're not big believers in the one-size-fits-all
theory on any aspect of diet.

00:03:15.969 --> 00:03:20.379
What we try to do in Unleash Your Thin is
actually have people, through journaling and

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:25.540
through keeping notes on how they're affected
by different foods, discover which foods are

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:28.690
really the ones that are derailing their whole
program.

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:30.400
Then they can take those foods out.

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:35.480
If those foods really are not problems for
them, then we have a template, an infrastructure,

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:38.930
that figures out how you can add those back
and in what amounts.

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:44.120
So you're very, very carefully actually doing
kind of a science experiment with yourself

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:49.599
as the subject to find out what foods actually
fit and forward the action in terms of getting

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:54.219
you where you want to go and which foods are
guaranteed to derail the action and take you

00:03:54.219 --> 00:03:56.239
exactly where you don't want to be.

00:03:56.239 --> 00:04:01.859
See, people have been victimized by the conventional
wisdom, which is both not really conventional

00:04:01.859 --> 00:04:06.010
when you look at the long range and certainly
not wise, which is that weight loss is simply

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:07.489
a matter of calories and exercise.

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:09.709
We eat too much, and we don't move enough.

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:10.909
That's the conventional wisdom.

00:04:10.909 --> 00:04:12.900
It's been passed down for ages.

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:17.780
Everybody believes it, including obese people,
and they think that if they're, in fact, fat,

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:20.590
it's because they don't exercise enough and
they eat too much.

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:25.770
That has a germ of truth, but you could drive
a Mack truck through the hole that's missing

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:26.770
in there.

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:30.060
What's missing in there is that there's a
ton of people who aren't eating a lot, and

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:34.860
they're on the treadmill all the time, and
they're not losing weight.

00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:39.449
It's wrong to tell those people it's their
fault, that they're doing something wrong.

00:04:39.449 --> 00:04:43.990
What we do in Unleash is try to really get
at what those foods are that create those

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:45.949
cravings that are so irresistible.

00:04:45.949 --> 00:04:48.990
A lot of people have the wrong information
about what's a healthy breakfast.

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:52.919
I meet people on a daily basis who say, "I
do everything right.

00:04:52.919 --> 00:04:53.919
I'm eating the right foods."

00:04:53.919 --> 00:04:55.180
You say to them, "Well, what are those foods?

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:56.180
What did you eat for breakfast?"

00:04:56.180 --> 00:04:57.430
They go, "I ate the greatest breakfast.

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:01.110
I had Special K and orange juice and toast
and a banana, and it's all low fat."

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:04.310
No, it's the precisely wrong breakfast if
you're trying to lose weight, so we need to

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:08.260
correct that information, but we also need
to do something about the programming of the

00:05:08.260 --> 00:05:13.180
brain that causes you to crave the very foods
that derail your program, and thatâ€™s what

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:14.930
we do in Unleash Your Thin.

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:19.610
What we did with Unleash Your Thin is we looked
around and we said, "What really keeps people

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:20.669
on a path?"

00:05:20.669 --> 00:05:23.430
A lot of people get very inspired.

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:27.150
We're good at inspiring people, and we're
very happy that we're good at inspiring people,

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:30.400
but that's not all we want to do is inspire
them to take action for a couple of weeks.

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:35.950
We want to actually inspire them to change
their lives, and that takes some continuity.

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:40.050
What we've learned from the internet and from
Facebook and from Twitter is that social media

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:44.419
and social connection and some interaction
like that is very powerful reinforcement for

00:05:44.419 --> 00:05:49.200
people, so we built a community, and we built
it as a membership site.

00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:54.449
What we're hoping is that it will become the
go-to health-membership site, not just for

00:05:54.449 --> 00:05:58.500
people who are into health, but people who
are into performance and real estate and flipping

00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:03.380
houses and all the other communities that
exist on the internet where people go, "This

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:06.439
is working for me, but now how about taking
care of my health, as well?"

00:06:06.439 --> 00:06:13.490
We want to be the health place that everybody
goes to, so we have hired one of the smartest

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:15.170
MDs I've ever worked with in my life.

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:16.170
There's me.

00:06:16.170 --> 00:06:19.389
There's a couple of nutritionists that I hired
that are first rate.

00:06:19.389 --> 00:06:25.800
We've got the group that we have that's built
the site, and we want to be the go-to place

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:28.810
where people can actually get the kind of
health information that's going to make a

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:30.919
difference in their lives forever.

00:06:30.919 --> 00:06:36.330
That's the purpose of Ultimate Brain, Ultimate
Body, and that's the theory behind the membership

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:37.330
site.

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:41.069
So far, I've got to say, I've been involved
in a lot of projects in my life, nothing that

00:06:41.069 --> 00:06:41.310
I've been prouder of than this.
