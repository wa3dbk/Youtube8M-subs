00:00:16.932 --> 00:00:33.380
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:36.030
Racing teams do a great job of
being at the cutting edge of

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.280
technology.

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:42.650
And what we're doing here at
Caterpillar, putting diesel

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:44.450
engines into machines
like this,

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:46.680
is also a huge challenge.

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.740
A Formula 1 engine idles at a
higher speed than the top

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:54.210
speed of one of these engines,
but we can easily produce

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.140
double the amount of torque.

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.570
Fuel economy is a huge issue.

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:05.709
Moving hundreds of cubic metres
of dirt a day is going

00:01:05.709 --> 00:01:07.280
to burn a lot of diesel.

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.820
And if you can reduce that by
even a fraction, well the

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:12.486
savings annually are huge.

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:23.270
So here in our engine test
facility, we're doing all the

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.520
things you'd expect a racing
team to be doing.

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.230
Any development we dream up in
the design office, we have to

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:34.540
validate here on real engines,
before it can go into

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:36.150
production.

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.880
So here we have our test cell.

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.180
And inside, you can
see we have an

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:45.750
engine ready to be tested.

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:48.870
You can see that we have all the
required safety features,

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:52.540
and also all the temperature
and pressure measurements.

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:55.960
You can see up at the to we
have our air inlet and our

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:59.450
exhaust going in and out
of the test cell.

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.740
Around the side, you can see
the coolant that we have

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:03.990
required for the engine.

00:02:08.075 --> 00:02:13.580
And around the back, you can
see our two-stage series

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:15.620
turbochargers.

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.650
So take these turbochargers
and say we want to make a

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:20.400
design change.

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:22.410
First of all, we model
the design.

00:02:22.410 --> 00:02:25.090
But we have to validate
that model.

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:28.520
So here in the test lab, we
run a baseline engine

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:32.640
configuration, taking all the
measurements that we require.

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:35.650
So you then go back to the model
and look at different

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:38.820
designs and create a
computational prediction on

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:42.085
how the air flow is going to
improved through the engine,

00:02:42.085 --> 00:02:45.830
thus improving the combustion
efficiency and overall

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:48.930
efficiency of the engine.

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:52.910
So you only have to go back
to the engine for a final

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:56.250
calibration, validation,
and endurance test.

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.500
All of this reduces the amount
of engine testing

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:00.750
that we have to do.

00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:10.810
This sort of test facility is
just as crucial to heavyweight

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:12.800
construction equipment
as it is to

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:14.350
featherweight racing cars.

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:32.532
