Hi. My name is Mary Thinnes and I'm a skin
care expert. The next topic I'm going to discuss

00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:12.770
is how to affectively treat acne as the condition
in the skin. As I mentioned before, with acneic,

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:18.529
oily skin it is very important that you use
proper cleansers and all the home care. I'm

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:22.009
not going to go over how to cleanse the skin
and all that again. But, obviously, you have

00:00:22.009 --> 00:00:28.109
to be careful with acneic skin since it is
sensitive, and you're trying to balance out

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.739
the water in the skin and keep that proper.
At the same time you want to deplete the skin

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:40.230
of some of the oils because it has an overabundance
of oil in the skin. So, with that being said,

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:46.320
acneic skin, especially products that I would
recommend for home care to treat that is something

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.129
that definitely has a salicylic acid. Before
I mentioned that salicylic acid should be

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:57.390
in a cleanser. Also there are home care products
that have salicylic acid in it and those are

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.829
leave on treatments at home. So after you've
cleansed, toned your face you can actually

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:07.909
put on a salicylic, blot it on the spots that
you have the acne breakout. Leave it for thirty

00:01:07.909 --> 00:01:12.640
seconds to a minute and put on your moisturizer,
and that will actually help to clear up those

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:19.140
blemishes. And then also with acneic skin,
you can have that post inflammatory hyperpigmentation

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.940
I mentioned before. And that's the red that's
left there after the acne is cleared. That

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:30.159
can be treated with your lightening gels thereafter.
But in order to treat the acne and prevent

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:36.060
it from getting any worse, you want to use
the proper home care treatments. Glycolic

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:43.039
home care treatments also these are at home
leave on treatments as well. And basically

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:50.979
it's used the same way that your salicylic
would be used, and it's just left on the skin.

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:55.450
Leave it for thirty seconds to a minute and
put your moisturizer over the top. So, that

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:59.829
being said, the most important thing with
acneic skin is not to over dry the skin because

00:01:59.829 --> 00:02:04.619
it will produce too much oil and cause more
breakouts. So, that being said, acneic skin

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.799
proper use is what I just mentioned.
