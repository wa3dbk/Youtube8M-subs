00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:05.580
Today we are going to review part number LH-003,
the tailgate lock from Bully.

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:12.140
This particular lock is specific for GMC Sierras
and Chevy Silverados, for model years 1999

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:13.519
to 2007.

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:16.370
Our replacement tailgate locking system consists
of three pieces.

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:24.430
We have our black plastic replacement bezel,
the inner locking mechanism and then two keys.

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:28.740
This system works great in combination with
your trucks camper shell or tonneau cover

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.210
to provide maximum security for your trucks
bed.

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:32.879

Let us go ahead and take a look to see how

00:00:32.879 --> 00:00:35.829
easy it is to install one of these on our
truck.

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:40.030
The first thing that we need to do is go ahead
and remove the original bezel that is on the

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:41.039
vehicle.

00:00:41.039 --> 00:00:43.309
To do that, we need to release four clips.

00:00:43.309 --> 00:00:45.739
There are two here at the top and two here
at the bottom.

00:00:45.739 --> 00:00:49.730
We are going to start by releasing the top
clips and to do that we just want to take

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:57.100
a flat head screwdriver and go ahead and pry
in there until you hear them release.

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.300
And then for the bottom clips, they are actually
facing down.

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.170
So we need to actually lift up on the bezel
to get those to release.

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:11.380
Next, we want to go ahead and open the tailgate.

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:28.360
We need to remove the bottom retaining bolt.

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:47.500
And then we can go ahead and close the tailgate
again and 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:02:32.139
we are going to go ahead and start installing
our locking mechanism.

00:02:32.139 --> 00:02:53.899
