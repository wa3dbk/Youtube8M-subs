00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.400
Zeno Clash is a new first person game with a strong focus on the melee fighting system

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:18.800
we wanted to make a game that had a strong close combat component that had both offensive and defensive actions

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:25.500
in Zeno Clash you can perform some basic attacks, you can throw a three punch combo

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.800
you can throw a strong attack, you can block attacks

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:32.500
but we really wanted to do a system which allowed more actions

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:39.000
in the game a skilled player will combine different moves to work to his advantage depending of the surroundings

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.000
I can stun this opponent and throw a finisher punch to make sure he lands on top of the other opponent

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.500
while they're both on the ground I can use this opportunity to kick them while they're defenseless

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.300
combining weapons with melee attacks can also produce effective combat strategies

00:00:54.500 --> 00:01:01.000
in this case I'll use my dual fish guns to stun the opponent but instead of finishing him off with the guns

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:08.000
I'll tag him, grab him and deal some extra damage with a kneebash attack or throw him against a nearby enemy

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:15.000
skullbombs are deadly weapons, but the AI will avoid the explosion if the enemy isn't distracted

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:19.500
in this case I can take advantage of an enemy's panic by knocking him back 

00:01:19.501 --> 00:01:22.500
with a shoulder thrust to force him into the explosion

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:29.000
Zeno Clash also features close combat weapons like hammers and clubs to fight heavy opponents

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:34.500
bashing weapons are very powerful but slow to swing, in this case where I'm fighting two enemies 

00:01:34.501 --> 00:01:39.000
I can lure the heavy opponent to ram into his friend and I can quickly respond with a smash attack

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:47.500
the depth of the combat mechanics, the weapons and the enemy interactions can produce some exciting and varied gameplay

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.500
in Zeno Clash two fights never play out the same
