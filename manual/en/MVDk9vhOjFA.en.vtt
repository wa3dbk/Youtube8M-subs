Hi. I'm Laura from youngwritersworkshops.com
and I want to talk about how you can teach

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:14.370
writing using a computer. The computer or
word processor is a great tool for a writing

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:22.279
teacher. In fact, it's kind of hard to imagine
writing without the computer now. One of the

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:29.819
great things about using the computer to teach
writing is that it's such a, it so enables

00:00:29.819 --> 00:00:37.719
cutting and pasting and editing, other kinds
of editing, so that you can make so much easier

00:00:37.719 --> 00:00:47.620
the act of moving words or quickly changing
one word to another. It's such a good way

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:53.820
to demonstrate how that works. The cut and
the paste in a word processing program is

00:00:53.820 --> 00:01:01.179
similar to an idea that a young writer would've
used using scissors and tape long ago, back

00:01:01.179 --> 00:01:07.750
in the old days. So the features of a word
processor to demonstrate some of the basics

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:14.520
of writing and editing. Some other great things
about teaching writing with a computer are

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:21.570
how easy it is to get, to confer with another
writer using email. You can teach writer,

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:29.560
you can teach your writers about email communication
and then have them get feedback over a long

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:36.610
distance from another writer that they've
connected with. For young writers, some teachers

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:42.291
use instant messaging in a close system where
they can actually practice communicating and

00:01:42.291 --> 00:01:48.110
writing by typing instant messages to each
other. The third great thing about writing

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:54.260
with computers is the opportunities for publication,
such as blogs or other online publications

00:01:54.260 --> 00:02:01.120
where student work can be published. So much
easier than submitting something to a print

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:06.660
publication. An opportunity for lots of people
to read your work and with very little work.

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:12.290
That's a great thing about the Internet and
what it's brought for our students. So to

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:18.950
sum up some of the ways to use a computer
to teach writing or editing, communicating

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:22.430
by email and getting feedback and publication
online.
