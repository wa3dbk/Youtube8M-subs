JESSICA DESVARIEUX: Welcome to The Real News
Network.

00:00:07.609 --> 00:00:09.900
I'm Jessica Desvarieux in Baltimore.

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.400
Due to the government shutdown, some FDA food
inspectors are furloughed.

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.750
Meat inspections will continue, but according
to a Department of Health and Human Services

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:24.019
memo, the majority of FDA food inspectors
have been deemed nonessential.

00:00:24.019 --> 00:00:26.439
Now joining us to discuss all this is Tony
Corbo.

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:30.179
He is the senior lobbyist for the food campaign
at Food &amp; Water Watch.

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:35.550
He is responsible for food-related legislative
and regulatory issues that come before Congress

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:37.329
and the executive branch.

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:38.329
Thanks for joining us, Tony.

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:40.100
TONY CORBO: Well, thanks for having me on.

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:45.770
DESVARIEUX: So, Tony, can you give us a sense
of what percentage of these FDA food inspectors

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:46.770
had been furloughed?

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:49.660
CORBO: Well, it's a substantial number.

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:58.070
Those inspectors who normally will do in-plant
inspections, both domestically and abroad--you

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:06.260
know, they do send inspectors abroad to look
at foreign establishments that export food

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:11.480
to the United States--those inspections have
stopped.

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:22.100
What is going on, however, is there are approximately
700 employees who have a role in import inspections

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:23.100
at the ports of entry.

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:29.869
There are some 300 ports of entry that FDA
is responsible for providing oversight for

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:30.990
food imports.

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.700
So those inspections are still going on.

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:41.109
But, you know, in terms of, you know, trying
to prevent problems from reaching our shores

00:01:41.109 --> 00:01:48.359
or preventing problems from occurring domestically,
the inspections that would normally occur

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:52.279
in actual food establishments are not going
on.

00:01:52.279 --> 00:01:53.299
DESVARIEUX: Okay.

00:01:53.299 --> 00:01:55.999
So these inspections are not going on.

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:58.829
What are the risks of these inspections not
happening?

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:02.580
I mean, it sounds pretty obvious, but can
you just paint a picture for our viewers?

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:09.950
CORBO: Well, the whole purpose, especially
since the Congress passed the FDA Food Safety

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:16.190
Modernization Act, was to set up a system
that would prevent foodborne illness.

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:26.070
And so an inspection frequency was established
in that law that essentially said that for

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:33.520
plants that either produce high-risk foods
or have had a history of bad compliance with

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:39.120
food safety standards, FDA would inspect those
facilities once every three years.

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:42.400
For those low-risk plants, it would be every
five years.

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:47.140
The fact that those inspections are not going
on, even though the inspection frequency is

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:55.590
not all that great, the fact that those inspections
are not going on may cause consumers to be

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:59.610
at greater risk for foodborne illness outbreaks
here in the United States.

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:03.130
DESVARIEUX: You mentioned the inspection frequencies
are not that great.

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:08.840
How would you describe the FDA's food inspection
practices before the shutdown?

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:12.290
CORBO: Well, they were relatively weak.

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:21.800
You know, before Congress passed the Food
Safety Modernization Act, FDA was averaging

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:29.420
once every five to ten years to visiting domestic
food establishments here in the United States,

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:34.670
and they were virtually doing none abroad
of food establishments that were exporting

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:36.580
food to the United States.

00:03:36.580 --> 00:03:42.380
Since the enactment of the law, there's this
new inspection frequency that says that FDA

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:45.660
should visit the high-risk plans once every
three years.

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:52.760
Now, you compare that to USDA that regulates
meat, poultry, and egg products, that is a

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:55.460
continuous inspection model.

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:59.830
Most of those--all of those inspectors are
on a job now.

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:06.680
They're not being paid over at USDA, but they
are working in those meat, poultry, and eggs

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:08.340
products plants right now.

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:09.400
DESVARIEUX: Okay.

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.640
Well, thank you so much for joining us, Tony.

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:13.319
CORBO: Thank you very much.

00:04:13.319 --> 00:04:15.900
DESVARIEUX: And thank you for joining us on
The Real News Network.
