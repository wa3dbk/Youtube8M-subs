00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:09.560
Welcome to Fish ON-Line.

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:11.620

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.440
[Close-up of Fish ON-Line Website.]

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:30.200
Moving around the map and looking at a lake record:

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:33.260
Pan around the map by clicking and dragging your mouse,

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:38.460
or, by using the arrow buttons in the upper left corner of the map.

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.100
Zoom in or out  

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:43.340
either by using the scroll-wheel on your mouse,

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:47.660
or by using the "+" and "-" controls to the left of the map.

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:49.780
[Close-up of Fish ON-Line Website.]

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:52.460
In the upper right hand corner of the map

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:54.700
there are options for the display.

00:00:54.700 --> 00:01:00.560
In MapView, lakes and roads are visible as well as
labels for major landmarks.

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:03.360
In Satellite View, satellite imagery of the province 

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:07.650
becomes the backdrop and hybrid view is
satellite imagery

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.270
with roads and labels overlaid.

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:14.270
Terrain View allows you to see the map with topography.

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:16.510
[Close-up of Fish ON-Line Website.]

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:20.110
In the lower left hand corner of the Fish ON-Line window

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:23.690
there are a number of icons beside checkboxes.

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:30.680
By selecting or deselecting the checkboxes you can choose to show or hide the water body icons, 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:33.840
the fisheries management zone boundaries,

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:38.000
Service Ontario locations that issue Fishing licenses,

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.300
 and lake depth contours.

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:42.840
[Close-up of Fish ON-Line Website.]

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:49.380
When the water bodies checkbox is selected you will see several blue icons with fish on the map.

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.320
If you move your mouse over them, 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:56.400
a title will appear to tell you which body of water the icon represents.

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.720
If there are two fish in the icon, 

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:02.280
the icon represents multiple water bodies, and you will need to zoom in --

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:05.369
until only a single water body is represented.

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:11.440
You can do this by zooming or by clicking on the multiple water body icon.

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.980
[Close-up of Fish ON-Line Website.]

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:19.900
Once an icon shows only one fish, move your cursor over the icon

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:22.750
and the water body name will appear.

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:30.540
Click on the water body icon to bring up the water body window.

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:32.500
The water body window has three tabs:

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:37.430
general information about the water body,
fish species in the water body,

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:42.090
and stocking information. At the bottom of
these windows

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.190
there are links to additional information.

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:52.380
At the bottom of the water body window, there's information about the water body,

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.920
and access to license regulation information.

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:02.760
For many of the most popular lakes in the province, a separate fact sheet is available for the fishing regulations for that lake.

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:10.460
The fish tab leads you to a list of the sport fish species in the selected water body.

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:13.200
By clicking on any of the fish species

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.370
you can bring up more information
including fact sheets,

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:20.750
the guide to eating sport fish, and other relevant
materials.

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.260
If the lake has been stocked for
recreational purposes,

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:29.500
the provincial stocking records for the lake will appear under the stocking tab

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:31.960
These tables

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:37.310
include the species, the year and the life
stage of the stocked fish.

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:40.620
At the bottom of the water body window,

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:43.240
you also have the option to get
directions

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:45.570
to or from this water body.

00:03:48.580 --> 00:03:53.120
A number of searches can be performed to help you find fishing spots in the
province.

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:57.100
These searches are located along the left hand side of the tool. 

00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:59.860
Above the search bar,

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:04.150
is a drop down menu that includes some of the provinces most popular water bodies.

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:07.580
By selecting any of these water bodies,

00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:10.580
the map will automatically zoom to the lake you selected.

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:14.180
In the search bar,

00:04:14.190 --> 00:04:16.230
there are several search options.

00:04:16.900 --> 00:04:20.040
The top option is to search by water body name.

00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:25.160
Enter the name, or part of the name, of a water body you're searching for.

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:30.700
Because there are some common names for lakes in the province,

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:34.700
you may need to limit the search to a
distance from a nearby town.

00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:43.420
By clicking the "search again" button you will return to the main search bar.

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:47.800
The next search is a fish species search.

00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:52.500
In this search, you have the
ability to search for water bodies

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:55.570
in a desired area that have one or more
species.

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:01.680
By hitting "Go," Fish ON-Line will show you all of the lakes

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:03.970
that have all the species that you've selected.

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:13.760
The next search, is for stocked water bodies. Start by choosing a stock species of fish you want to search for.

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:21.420
Then choose a distance up to 300 kilometers from any location or address in North America.

00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:23.960
When you run the search,

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:28.240
Fish ON-Line will show you all the
lakes that are stocked for recreational fishing,

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:31.680
with that species, within that search
area.

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:39.540
The final search is by GPS coordinates. If you have coordinates for a particular lake

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:44.200
and want more information or directions to
that point, put the coordinates

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:49.080
into this search, and an icon will appear on
the map where those coordinates were taken.

00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:54.020
Click on the icon

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:57.550
and you'll see the coordinates and have
the ability to get directions

00:05:57.550 --> 00:05:59.830
to or from that location.

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:08.480
The final function, the fish online tool is the "Get Directions" button.

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:12.400
Once you click the "Get Directions" button

00:06:12.409 --> 00:06:16.180
you can either enter the address or
place you'll be travelling

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:18.380
to and from in the fields.

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:24.740
Or you can click and drag the red and green push pins

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:27.840
onto the map, to show where you're starting your trip

00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:29.380
and where you want to go.

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:36.560
When you click "Go," a new window will appear with your directions.

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:44.500
The Ministry will continue to improve
the tool and the data which is available.

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:47.520
