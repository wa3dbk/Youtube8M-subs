Hello everyone, this is Sergio

00:00:41.734 --> 00:00:45.320
and on todays Toys Addicted I'll talk about

00:00:45.772 --> 00:00:48.457
a Medicom Toy Corporation product

00:00:49.282 --> 00:00:54.493
released in December 2008: say hello to Alien.

00:00:54.920 --> 00:01:01.545
Alien is part of the Medicom Real Action Heroes series

00:01:01.808 --> 00:01:08.877
which is all about action figures

00:01:09.359 --> 00:01:13.044
related to japanese TV shows

00:01:13.296 --> 00:01:25.786
or anime, but more importantly, characters coming from successful international movies

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:29.936
like the Alien series.

00:01:30.653 --> 00:01:34.884
Let's take a look at the main features of this Alien

00:01:35.178 --> 00:01:36.956
First of all, the height

00:01:37.932 --> 00:01:41.136
which is about 12 inches

00:01:43.012 --> 00:01:49.467
But the most interesting thing that catches the eye

00:01:49.781 --> 00:01:52.619
is that this action figure

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:54.631
unlike most of Medicom productions

00:01:54.885 --> 00:02:00.831
it completely covered with a very soft vinyl sheath

00:02:01.105 --> 00:02:04.245
which is un-removable.

00:02:04.576 --> 00:02:10.315
Therefore it's not possible to see the inside body.

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:15.072
All joints are hidden.

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:19.750
Before I talk about the joints,

00:02:20.157 --> 00:02:28.420
we can notice how faithful the design is to the original Giger one

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.528
and to that seen in the Ridley Scott movie.

00:02:32.948 --> 00:02:39.357
I don't recall the head being so transparent

00:02:39.704 --> 00:02:45.661
you could see the skull and this kind of back bone.

00:02:47.125 --> 00:02:50.486
Looking at the joints,

00:02:50.713 --> 00:02:54.862
we have one in the foot here,

00:02:55.323 --> 00:03:00.213
and one in the ankle

00:03:00.434 --> 00:03:02.883
you can move it around its axis

00:03:02.883 --> 00:03:07.144
The knees,

00:03:07.688 --> 00:03:11.040
the legs,

00:03:11.679 --> 00:03:14.788
the joints at pelvis level

00:03:14.788 --> 00:03:19.436
are all somewhat connected to the material that covers them

00:03:19.436 --> 00:03:22.475
While very soft, this vinyl sheath

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:25.175
still hampers the joints

00:03:25.175 --> 00:03:28.579
the movements the action figure can do

00:03:28.579 --> 00:03:31.898
you can see it, like in this case

00:03:32.118 --> 00:03:35.053
The arms

00:03:38.326 --> 00:03:43.460
the fingers are rigid

00:03:43.754 --> 00:03:46.687
the hands are detachable

00:03:46.893 --> 00:03:51.741
we can see the wrist joints

00:03:52.661 --> 00:03:58.591
The head:

00:03:58.591 --> 00:04:02.569
The head joint is quite smooth

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:06.155
and as you can see it doesn't hold a custom position

00:04:06.405 --> 00:04:12.070
it keeps resetting to the central position

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:18.511
There is also a little joint at the jaw

00:04:18.714 --> 00:04:23.378
which should allow the teeth to be pulled out

00:04:24.079 --> 00:04:28.651
allowing the Alien to perform its notorious fatal move.

00:04:28.651 --> 00:04:32.729
But it's hard to do this with bare hands (quite difficult)

00:04:32.729 --> 00:04:37.001
and therefore I'll use a tool

00:04:37.001 --> 00:04:38.979
not too sharp tho

00:04:38.979 --> 00:04:42.036
as you might damage the paint work

00:04:44.125 --> 00:04:52.645
This is how long it is

00:04:56.404 --> 00:04:59.509
Here we have the tail, which probably has

00:04:59.903 --> 00:05:02.928
an iron wire inside

00:05:02.928 --> 00:05:07.650
which allows it to keep any given position

00:05:07.888 --> 00:05:11.028
preventing it from falling.

00:05:14.768 --> 00:05:21.460
You can call it a natural, integrated stand if you like :)

00:05:24.968 --> 00:05:26.652
As for the material

00:05:26.652 --> 00:05:28.983
as I said it's quite soft

00:05:28.983 --> 00:05:32.955
except the one used for the torso which is made of hard vinyl

00:05:32.955 --> 00:05:38.226
like the back, with these sort of air vents.

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:47.559
Color coating could have been done better

00:05:47.559 --> 00:05:51.506
The palette is quite limited.

00:05:51.753 --> 00:05:55.137
Grey here is quite uniform.

00:05:55.438 --> 00:05:59.119
Here, at head level,

00:05:59.119 --> 00:06:03.050
it's better, with some gradients,

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:07.169
The head transparency in particular.

00:06:08.699 --> 00:06:10.833
There are no accessories.

00:06:10.833 --> 00:06:14.512
But I'll show you the package

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:26.150
which recalls the original Ridley Scott movie poster.

00:06:29.052 --> 00:06:32.046
It's possible to open the front panel.

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:35.541
Here we have a plastic display window and some images of the Alien.

00:06:36.152 --> 00:06:45.109
As for what might be called "accessories",

00:06:45.109 --> 00:06:48.490
there is a plastic, transparent stand

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:53.514
with two hooks whose height can be adjusted with these screws.

00:06:54.001 --> 00:07:01.925
I recommend this Medicom action figure. It's really well done.

00:07:04.299 --> 00:07:11.460
I especially recommend it to anybody who loved the movie and also to those who want to discover this

00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:15.763
Medicom products, which are kinda low profile here in Italy

00:07:15.976 --> 00:07:19.511
despite being quite good.
