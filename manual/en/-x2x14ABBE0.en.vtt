Hi, my name is Windy St. George, and this
is how to play card games. Most American card

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:11.549
games are based on a deck of fifty two cards.
They have four suits, which is, diamonds,

00:00:11.549 --> 00:00:23.840
hearts, clubs, and spades, and two colors,
black, which is spades and clubs, and red,

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:29.890
which is hearts and diamonds. There's also
a joker in a fifty two card deck, there's

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:37.320
two jokers, but they're often not used in
play. When you buy a deck of cards, they have

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:42.800
bridge, and they have standard or poker. The
only difference is the width of the card,

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:47.600
for bridge players, they have to hold a lot
of cards in their hand during play, so the

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.399
cards are made more narrow to fit in your
hand better. But both of these decks, the

00:00:52.399 --> 00:00:57.960
same type of cards inside, and both will work
equally well for playing games. There's a

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.930
third kind of deck called a pea knuckle deck.
It only has higher numbered cards. From nine

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:07.610
up into the face cards. So, you don't want
to buy a pea knuckle deck unless you intend

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:15.830
to play the specialty game pea knuckle. OK,
for many card games, you will have to be in

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:23.340
partnerships and you're going to play tricks.
A trick is when everyone has cards in their

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:30.770
hand, and the first person starts the trick
and everyone else has to follow suit, which

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:35.619
means they have to play a card, they have
to play a card that is in that suit if it's

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:40.549
possible. The person who plays the highest
card at the end of everyone playing cards,

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:50.500
wins the trick. So, this ten would probably
win a two, and a nine. So, whoever played

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:55.680
the ten would win the trick and it would go
into their point pile. Some games there are

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:59.700
certain cards you don't want to get their
poison, such as in Hearts, you don't want

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:05.210
the queen of hearts, and spades, they're certain
cards that you don't want to get and so it's

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:10.789
to your advantage to lose the trick and you
want to be careful of your higher point cards

00:02:10.789 --> 00:02:14.810
and not waste them. And play your lower cards
when you know you're going to lose the trick

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:19.420
anyway. So that you can get rid of them. And
that's how you play card games.
