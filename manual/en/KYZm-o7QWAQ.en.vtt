00:00:07.819 --> 00:00:12.160
It’s a good idea to first practise on dry
land to get a feel for the manoeuvre.

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:16.590
Place some old tyres under the back of the
boat to support your weight and climb in.

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.160
No need to have the sail hoisted, tie a piece
of rope around the mast to hold the boom up

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:25.900
high, and ask a friend to mimic the wind by
pushing the boom backwards and forwards across

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:26.900
the boat.

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:31.090
The first step is to take a good look around
and check the area is all clear.

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:35.150
Assuming it is, you should next shout ‘READY
ABOUT’.

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:39.080
Once you have received all clear from the
crew, prepare to lead with your back foot

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:44.329
to ensure you face forwards throughout the
manoeuvre, and release a bit of mainsheet.

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:48.120
This will slow you down, and make it easier
to duck under the boom.

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.699
Next you should shout ‘lee ho’ and push
the tiller gently towards the sail.

00:00:52.699 --> 00:00:57.039
Try to push the tiller from the very end of
the tiller extension like this, as this will

00:00:57.039 --> 00:00:59.329
make things easier later on.

00:00:59.329 --> 00:01:03.660
Ask your friend to push the boom across, and
then you duck under the boom and move across

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:08.580
to the new side of the boat and sit down as
far forward as you can, with the tiller extension

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.220
behind your back.

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.909
Straighten the tiller.

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:16.030
Next you should swap hands.

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:20.190
Taking the hand holding the mainsheet back
to the tiller extension, grab it with your

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:24.140
thumb pointing towards the end of the extension
like this.

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:28.110
You should then release the tiller extension
from behind your back and rotate it under

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.689
your arm, and grab the mainsheet with your
front hand.

00:01:31.689 --> 00:02:01.579
Resume the dagger grip once more and you are
now ready to pull the sails in again.
