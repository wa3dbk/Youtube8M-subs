00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.090
With a Digium phone connected to Switchvox,
you may tie status

00:00:04.090 --> 00:00:05.730
settings to call rules.

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:10.920
Therefore the call rules will be automatically
enabled when you update your “status”.

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:14.930
To see how this
works, log into the Web Suite and go to ‘Features’

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:18.030
then
‘Call Rules’.

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:22.730
You can create call rules for Unaswered calls,
Busy Calls, Blocked

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:27.300
Calls, or prompt the caller to enter a secret
code before the call is

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.300
completed.

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.020
Here is a rule set named “Default Do Not
Disturb”.

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:34.739
This
rule set will automatically activate any time

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:37.539
the status is set to
“Do Not Disturb”.

00:00:37.539 --> 00:00:42.249
Based on this configuration, Switchvox
will Decline Queue Calls immediately and send

00:00:42.249 --> 00:00:45.210
all direct calls to
voicemail immediately.

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.269
To create new rules, click on “Create Call
Rule Set”.

00:00:49.269 --> 00:00:52.019
Enter a Rule Set Name.

00:00:52.019 --> 00:00:53.510
Select a Time Frame.

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:58.039
And select the primary
status type or specific sub-status that will

00:00:58.039 --> 00:01:00.010
activate this new call
rule.

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:03.379
For example, selecting “Any Extended Away”
will

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:07.860
activate this call rule whenever any status
is set with a primary type

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.890
of “Extended Away”.

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:14.780
However selecting a specific
sub-status will only activate the call rule

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:17.149
when that specific
sub-status is set.

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:19.549
This allows you great flexibility in defining
how

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:21.200
your calls will be routed.

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.659
You can have a specific status option for
everything from web conferences to out-of-town

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:29.170
appointments and the
call rule action will take affect when that

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:31.079
custom status is set.

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:34.549
As an example, I will create a call rule that
forwards calls to my

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:38.490
cellphone when I have my status set to “Extended
Away –

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.470
Out of town at Astricon”

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:44.070
Clicking ‘Save Call Rule Set’ brings me
to the Call Rule

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.570
Set editing screen where I can add Actions.

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:51.979
I'll click ‘Create
Action’ and then choose an action type.

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:53.749
I will select
‘Call Cascade’.

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:57.689
(This action type allows me to forward
my calls to an external number, such as my

00:01:57.689 --> 00:01:59.049
mobile phone.)

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:02.100
Then I'll
choose the type of call, the Number to forward

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.439
to, and the number of
times to ring the previous rule.

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:09.550
I will set this Action to complete
immediately.

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:14.170
I will enable ‘Attempt to preserve
CallerID’ and I will leave ‘Acknowledge

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.020
Call’
disabled.

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.530
Finally I'll save the action.

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:23.530
Now when I set my status to
“Extended Away – Out of town at Astricon”

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:26.170
the
call will cascade to my mobile phone instead

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:28.220
of ringing my desk phone.

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.690
Remember that you can always click on the
`help' icon to find detailed

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:35.080
information about all of the options you can
use to configure your

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:36.750
status and call rules.
