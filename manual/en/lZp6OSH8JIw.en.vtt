00:00:12.875 --> 00:00:14.542
Friction Force

00:00:19.458 --> 00:00:22.125
Mush! Mush, mush! Faster!

00:00:23.458 --> 00:00:24.458
Alex!

00:00:24.542 --> 00:00:26.999
Mush! Hey, why aren't you mushing?

00:00:27.375 --> 00:00:30.999
Alex! Come on! It's your turn to play with Kid!

00:00:31.042 --> 00:00:32.208
On my way!

00:00:32.625 --> 00:00:34.999
Hurry up!

00:00:39.458 --> 00:00:43.624
Here, it's about time.

00:00:43.625 --> 00:00:45.250
Kid, would you stand up?

00:00:47.042 --> 00:00:48.417
What are you doing?

00:00:48.667 --> 00:00:49.833
You'll see in a minute...

00:00:52.333 --> 00:00:54.564
My race with Tim for the
Grandpa's Cup starts soon

00:00:54.589 --> 00:00:56.732
and I'm wasting time pulling
little kids around!

00:00:57.458 --> 00:01:03.291
Make sure you hold on tight. And ready...
And set... And time for the... blast off!!

00:01:03.292 --> 00:01:05.249
Beep! Beep! Zip-Tang!!!

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.208
What the...? How is that-?
How's he going so fast?!

00:01:09.417 --> 00:01:14.750
By vanquishing friction. I just put a
little oil on his sled runners... and...

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.958
What is this? That's a pudding jar.

00:01:17.125 --> 00:01:21.042
Well... I call it "Slide Slime". My own invention.

00:01:21.958 --> 00:01:26.875
Alex... How would you like to be on my Ski Squad?
As managing consultant!

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.958
What's the benefit package like?

00:01:31.667 --> 00:01:33.083
Make sure you get enough on there!

00:01:33.333 --> 00:01:36.000
Don't worry. This is science.

00:01:36.167 --> 00:01:38.963
Alright, Max. This is a
test run, ... just two times

00:01:38.988 --> 00:01:41.399
around the playground
and then... you finish.

00:01:42.708 --> 00:01:43.708
Go!

00:01:44.208 --> 00:01:48.583
Dude... this is not working.

00:01:50.792 --> 00:01:51.792
How interesting...

00:01:57.292 --> 00:02:01.208
Look at this... Your skis will now be able to
go in one direction, but not in the other...

00:02:01.209 --> 00:02:03.917
Alex! You rock!

00:02:04.417 --> 00:02:07.333
Oh, yeah! Oh, yeah!!

00:02:07.375 --> 00:02:09.042
I'm so darn fast!!

00:02:09.125 --> 00:02:12.332
Final lap... Finish!

00:02:12.333 --> 00:02:13.417
Just need to figure out stopping.

00:02:13.583 --> 00:02:18.458
Stop! Look out, Max!

00:02:21.125 --> 00:02:22.167
True that.

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:31.083
I am so smart.

00:02:41.542 --> 00:02:43.542
Yo. We're waiting. Are you ready?

00:02:43.917 --> 00:02:45.167
Yeah, yeah. One second.

00:02:45.168 --> 00:02:48.625
What's up? Are your skis hungry or something?

00:02:48.667 --> 00:02:51.187
Better laugh now because in a
minute you're going to be crying.

00:02:51.417 --> 00:02:56.666
The race is thirty laps of the playground.
On your marks! Skiiers ready! Go!!

00:02:56.667 --> 00:03:00.083
Alex! It isn't working!

00:03:07.542 --> 00:03:11.875
This is just chocolate pudding!

00:03:19.999 --> 00:03:23.792
Stop! Hang on! I got the jars mixed up!

00:03:25.125 --> 00:03:28.208
Okay. That's the pudding. This is SlideSlime!

00:03:28.417 --> 00:03:34.083
Do not (eat that bun! And clean...
that (ON) knife!

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.083
Think you'll ever finish your first lap?!

00:03:37.084 --> 00:03:41.125
00:03:38:02	00:03:40;16	Max!
I got the two jars mixed up!

00:03:41.333 --> 00:03:42.333
Just hurry!

00:03:43.917 --> 00:03:46.708
Comin' through!

00:03:53.958 --> 00:03:56.498
It's my pleasure and
my honor... to award the

00:03:56.523 --> 00:03:59.499
Grandfather's Cup to an
honest, hard-working skier.

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:01.917
Couldn't have done it without you, SlideSlime.

00:04:14.792 --> 00:04:16.792
Couldn't have done it without you, SlideSlime.

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:25.833
Hey, Max! Come and check out
my latest awesome invention.

00:04:26.292 --> 00:04:27.292
Look!

00:04:28.917 --> 00:04:29.917
"Jump Jell-O"

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:47.667
Alex... I'm not sure the world can
survive many more... of your inventions.
