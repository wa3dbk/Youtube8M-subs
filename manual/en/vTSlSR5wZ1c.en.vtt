00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.180
Hello everyone.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Today in the video review

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:14.900
Casio G-Shock DW-5600 and Casio DW-290

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:19.460
As we can see, these models are very similar.

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.800
The first watch - it's a classic G-Shock DW-5600

00:00:24.233 --> 00:00:26.713
The Second watch is a somewhat simplified version of G-Shock.

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:32.720
If we compare these two watches, we will see that they are very similar to each other. The thickness of both 16 mm.

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:44.380
Both have a mineral glass dial.

00:00:46.093 --> 00:00:48.853
Water resistant 200m both.

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:57.220
The main screen. Hours, minutes, seconds.

00:00:57.460 --> 00:00:59.500
Day of the week, month, date.

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:01.620
Alarm Clock.

00:01:01.953 --> 00:01:03.273
Timer.

00:01:03.273 --> 00:01:05.253
Stopwatch.

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:08.960
Now DW-290.

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:10.860
The main display. Hours, minutes, seconds.

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.173
Day of the week, month, date. All the same.

00:01:12.173 --> 00:01:13.573
Alarm Clock.

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:14.700
Timer.

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.113
Stopwatch.

00:01:17.274 --> 00:01:19.274
All the functions are the same.

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:30.140
G-Shock has some bigger numbers, just a little bit more. You can barely notice it.

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.520
the location of the digits on the display is the same.

00:01:35.373 --> 00:01:38.313
I thought that in these two wathes using the same modules.

00:01:38.313 --> 00:01:40.033
But this is not true.

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:49.720
Casio DW 290 uses the module 3231

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:56.240
Casio G Shock DW 5600 uses the module 3229.

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:02.780
DW 290 looks looks more bulky.

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:09.600
Both models have powerful cases, reliable, recessed buttons.

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:20.440
I have not tested shock protection of the Casio DW-290

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:23.880
But watch looks very sturdy and reliable.

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:28.760
Now I will show EL-backlight.

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:34.220
Both models have a bright backlight.

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:40.860
