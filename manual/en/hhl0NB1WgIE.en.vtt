00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:25.740
-Hello?
-Mister O'Neil.

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:30.920
You have been most displeasing. You have something I want.

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:36.600
-What do you want?
-Don't be a fool! You know exactly what I'm talking about.

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.040
You are only going to do terrible things, Shredder. I'll never give it up to you.

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:44.260
Don't be so sure of that.

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.780
I believe I can make a deal with you.

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.480
Don't listen to him! Go get the Turtles. They can help.

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:53.380
No!

00:00:53.600 --> 00:01:03.500
You have twenty-four hours to bring me the device. Bring it to Stockman's decomissioned factory. If you do not, your daughter's life is forfeit.

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.040
Okay. I'll do it.

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:14.600
Oh. I would suggest that you do. In fact, no defy the Turtles. They have no match for me now.

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:17.320
I will wait your delivery.

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:34.560
-When I get my hands on that scum-bag Shredder, I'm gonna...
-Raph, take it easy. We don't even know if he's here.

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:39.360
I'll take the Reactor. If April is there, I just hope we can save her.

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.040
We're all with you on this.

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.520
Yeah. Let's just show these guys what we're made of.

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.660
I am pleased to see you have come through on our...

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:02.140
...arrangement.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.820
-Let her go, Shredder!
-Yeah. Or we have to make our own arrangement.

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.180
Believe me, it won't be pleasant.

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:15.200
Yeah. Prepare to be terminated.

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:21.220
Fools! I will not succumb to your pathetic amends. Attack them!

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:52.440
Gotta be faster than that, fish-head.

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:33.100
Useless! All of you!

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:37.280
I will deal with you pathetic freaks!

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.520
We have to go after him.

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:46.220
But that's what he wants. This is probably a trap.

00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:50.360
Trap or no trap. We are putting a hurt on this guy once and for all.

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:52.780
Kirby! Take care of April. We'll be back.

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:38.080
I underestimated you. I now see you are indeed skilled ninja.

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:42.120
Yeah. We can bust up anything you throw at us.

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:46.140
We're not going to let you continue your raid of terror. We are putting an end to it now.

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:51.100
You speak strong words. But they will not help you now.

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:54.620
Here you will meet your... death!

00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:25.460
This guy just isn't faced.

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:29.060
His armour is too strong. We have to find a weak spot.

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:35.980
You pathetic freaks are no match for me!

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:38.580
Perhaps I can be of assistance.

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:40.380
What?!

00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:48.060
-Master Splinter.
-I have come to help you, my sons.

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:50.480
Together, we can defeat this evil.

00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:58.780
A rat and four turtles. You will all be crushed!

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:03.280
My sons, focus your attacks on the capes in his armour.

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:06.700
Mikey, Don. You take the back side. We'll take the front.

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:34.260
One of many Ninjutsus secrets: find your opponent's weakness. Use them as your focus points.

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:42.060
Now, my sons! Finish him!

00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:59.140
-Looks like we won this time.
-Say good-bye, Shredder!

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:06.680
Yes. Our adversary is defeated. But do not be careless, my sons. There may be more evil looming on the horizon.
