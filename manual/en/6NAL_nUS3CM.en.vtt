00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:06.509
Kennedy: Hi, I'm Kennedy Ryan.

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:09.849
I'm a local actress and comedian and I'm going
to be your model today.

00:00:09.849 --> 00:00:14.379
Today, your host, Ron Sullivan, is going to
be leading a workshop on 'One Light Setup'.

00:00:14.379 --> 00:00:17.820
Ron: I want to explain what we're going to
do in this session today.

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:25.320
I'm going to do three separate setups using
seamless background, one subject, one light.

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:34.180
I'm using my 28-70 lens, my D7000 camera,
and all I'm going to do in all the three setupsâ€¦The

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:39.660
first setup I'm going to have the light at
a 90 degree position to the model; the next

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:45.940
position will be the light in front of the
model; and the third setup at a 45-degree

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:51.750
angle to the model to demonstrate what you
can do in your studio or your house or your

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.660
living room with one light and the effects
you can create.

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:59.720
Go through the video and I'll explain why
I prefer one of the setups over the other,

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:05.540
but again, this could be a white wall in your
house, one light, could be a speed light.

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:10.030
I've used a soft box, which is my preferred
way to go.

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:18.630
I don't use speed lights a lot, but here's
the video, hope you enjoy it.

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:24.539
As you can see from the image, the model is
standing exactly 90 degrees to the soft box

00:01:24.539 --> 00:01:29.640
so that it's not in front of her; it's not
on a 45-degree angle; and this is how I will

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:32.590
take the first image.

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:37.779
In this first setup, we actually have the
soft box to the immediate left of the model.

00:01:37.779 --> 00:01:42.979
Basically, if the model was to extend her
arm out, she would actually hit the soft box,

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:46.200
which we'll demonstrate in the video coming
up.

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:51.220
What we have in the finished image is the
soft box is obviously to the left of the subject.

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:55.969
You can actually see the side closest to the
soft box is well exposed.

00:01:55.969 --> 00:02:01.520
The side furthest from the soft box has heavy
shadow, is what we call split lighting.

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.409
For most normal portraitures this would not
be acceptable to a client.

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:12.120
If you're making dramatic images to show danger
or whatever, you might use this, but for a

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.300
person who is looking to get a portraiture
in the studio that they can hang up on their

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:22.150
wall, give it to a family member or whatever,
this would not be acceptable in most studios.

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:24.519
I would never use it.

00:02:24.519 --> 00:02:30.180
I provided this just to give you a demonstration
of what the look would appear as.

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.860
In position two, we demonstrate by moving
the soft box from the immediate far left,

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:39.930
that 90-degrees, now we put it directly in
front of the subject, push our camera off

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:46.010
to the side to get a still image.

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:49.950
As you can see from the image here, the model
is basically standing immediately in front

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:54.360
of the soft box.

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:59.549
As we can see from the finished image here,
the lighting is very flat, much better than

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:04.519
the first image that we showed you, but again,
a little flat.

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:08.150
Very much like using the popup flash on your
camera.

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:13.239
It doesn't create a lot of definition and
contrast, no contouring of the light, but

00:03:13.239 --> 00:03:14.939
again, it's OK.

00:03:14.939 --> 00:03:22.560
It's not bad, but we'll show in the next setup
how it can even be much better.

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:27.049
In the third position, we basically have moved
the soft box between our first position and

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:28.569
our second position.

00:03:28.569 --> 00:03:32.500
It is now on a 45-degree angle to the subject.

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:39.340
Again, somewhere in between the first two
setups and we'll see what the effect is.

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:43.370
Here we can see again the position of the
light in relation to the model.

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:45.620
It's not to the far side at 90-degrees.

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:46.980
It's not directly in front.

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:49.310
It's on a 45-degree position.

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:53.129
Here's the finished image from the third setup
that we conducted.

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:57.049
As you can see, there's a lot more definition
in the models face.

00:03:57.049 --> 00:03:59.340
The face is well exposed.

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:02.800
Both sides of the face are evenly lit.

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:06.400
We have a little bit of shadow on the far
side, which puts a little definition to the

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:07.400
face.

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:09.430
A very pleasing photo.

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:14.909
If you were to operate a studio and all you
had was one light, this would be an acceptable

00:04:14.909 --> 00:04:15.909
image.

00:04:15.909 --> 00:04:20.700
The only thing that I might add would be a
reflector, which we currently did not do that.

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:26.480
It will create a really nice pleasing image,
and just simply by moving the light from a

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:33.730
90-degree angle to a 45-degree angle creates
a beautiful effect.

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:36.530
So I've put all three images together so you
can see the impact.

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:44.100
Number one, again, the soft box is at a 90-degree
position, not something I would use in a studio.

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:46.070
Most people would not use this in a studio.

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:50.220
This would not be an acceptable image, but
if you're trying to do something dramatic

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:54.970
and playing around with the camera, it would
be fine, but it certainly wouldn't be something

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:58.230
you would love a photo of your children to
look like this.

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:00.600
It's what we call split lighting.

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:05.110
Number two, soft box is in front creating
what we call flat lighting.

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:08.010
There's really no spark or contrast.

00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:13.700
No real contouring of the light, so the image
appears very flat and would be comparable

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:18.820
to using your on-camera flash by putting somebody
against the wall and taking a picture of them.

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:22.690
It's OK, but it's not something you would
expect from a professional.

00:05:22.690 --> 00:05:28.470
Number three, we actually have the soft box
in a 45-degree angle to the subject.

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:33.210
We're not using a reflector, but you could
use a reflector, and you can see a much more

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:37.990
pleasing image, and something that somebody
would like to have as their own photograph

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:41.580
or to give to their family, friends, parents,
so on.

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:45.250
Again, something you would expect from a professional
studio.

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:46.250
That's it for this video.

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:48.530
