&lt;i&gt;Jane Eyre, Random House, 1943.&lt;/i&gt;

00:00:07.443 --> 00:00:11.642
It's a beautiful edition,
known for the cover illustration.

00:00:11.714 --> 00:00:15.880
But there's a really nice dedication inside,
with a quote from the book.

00:00:15.953 --> 00:00:19.946
&lt;i&gt;"To my darling daughter, April.
'The human heart has hidden treasures&lt;/i&gt;

00:00:20.024 --> 00:00:22.651
- "'In secret kept, in silence sealed..."'
- "'In silence sealed

00:00:22.726 --> 00:00:25.161
&lt;i&gt;"'The thoughts, the hopes
the dreams, the pleasures&lt;/i&gt;

00:00:25.228 --> 00:00:27.958
"'Whose charms were broken if revealed'

00:00:28.698 --> 00:00:30.690
&lt;i&gt;"From your loving father."&lt;/i&gt;

00:00:41.045 --> 00:00:43.035
- Hi, Olivia.
- Hi, Will.

00:00:43.815 --> 00:00:45.076
- How you been?
- Good.

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:47.641
I haven't heard any of your long
sorry messages in a while.

00:00:47.718 --> 00:00:50.619
Those were delightful, weren't they?
Sorry about that.

00:00:50.688 --> 00:00:52.589
- April here?
- No, she's at school.

00:00:52.657 --> 00:00:54.625
- School?
- Yeah.

00:00:54.693 --> 00:00:58.684
- She started grad school at NYU.
- Great. Wow.

00:00:58.762 --> 00:01:01.857
- If you want to wait, she'll be home soon.
- I'd love to.

00:01:01.933 --> 00:01:05.768
Make yourself comfortable.
I have to finish this application I'm writing.

00:01:05.838 --> 00:01:07.635
- Good luck.
- Thanks.

00:01:31.631 --> 00:01:32.689
Hey.

00:01:33.298 --> 00:01:34.629
How you doing?

00:01:36.336 --> 00:01:37.496
Kevin.

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:40.871
Will Hayes.

00:01:41.941 --> 00:01:44.706
I'm just waiting for April.

00:01:46.713 --> 00:01:49.203
Are you the same Kevin
that she mentioned a while back?

00:01:50.383 --> 00:01:53.181
I hope so. Unless she's collecting Kevins.

00:01:53.253 --> 00:01:55.381
Kevin, phone!

00:01:55.456 --> 00:01:59.448
Anyway, I'm pretty sure I am the only Kevin
who's actually living with her.
