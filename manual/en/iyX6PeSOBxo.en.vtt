Hi! My name is Bobby McGee from Bobby Mcgee Endurance Sports and bobbymcgee.com.

00:00:10.409 --> 00:00:13.709
What I'm gonna work out on this show and give you guys a hand with

00:00:13.709 --> 00:00:17.880
is on stretching the Soleus. Now the Soleus is this lower calf muscle

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:21.480
'cause underneath this one that looks so
big, but this was actually bigger and

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.330
it touches inside of the knee, alright?

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:25.840
And its primary job

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:26.660
is to

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:28.349
straightened the toe.

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:32.040
And when we ran, its primary job is to
hold the ankle stiff

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.050
so that the ankle serves as a spring of
which we can launch, alright?

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:40.300
And stretching the Soleus is very very
important because the more we ran and

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.680
especially for Triathletes who do a lot
of kicking with their foot in the straight

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:44.590
fashion.

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:48.220
This muscle gets shortened up and really
need it to be quite effective.

00:00:48.220 --> 00:00:51.750
In fact the Soleus needs to be so loose
so we are able to sit down

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.049
like this on our haunches like this, without falling over backwards,

00:00:55.049 --> 00:00:58.270
with our heels still on the ground, and that's very important.

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:02.069
But we also want to stretch it actively
because we can put our Achilles Tendon

00:01:02.069 --> 00:01:06.030
both in terms of its and uh... it's
uh... attachment to the heel or

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:10.280
insertion and its origin on the Soleus
muscle both of those can be put under

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:14.500
pressure if we stretch that muscle
passively. In other words we get up here

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.040
and we just weigh it on as hard as we
can.

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:18.340
The other thing to remember

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:20.880
if we want to stretch the Soleus 
exclusively

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.970
we have to do that with a bent knee, alright?

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:27.180
So doing this is mostly a Gastroc Stretch,

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.720
the Soleus is not put under much of a 
load in this position

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.350
and we will feel the sensation somewhere
up here

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:35.570
or in this muscle at the top.

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:38.610
So the first thing we have to remember
with a Soleus muscle is that we need to

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:40.810
do that stretch with a bent knee.

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:44.450
You also notice that my foot is pointing
straight probe forward, I don't want the foot out

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.390
here because then I'm taking

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:49.490
uh... the pressure off that Soleus and
similarly I don't want to be putting the

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:53.230
toe inwards, I want to keep that toe pointing forward and back. So I wanna

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:54.840
be in this position here.

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.420
Well I want my body nice and up straight
so I don't want my back arched but I also don't

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.070
want my head down on my back rounded. So
I'm gonna be nice and up straight

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.070
my knee is bent, alright?

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:08.189
Now I want to get this muscle firing
first so I'll pick this front leg up

00:02:08.189 --> 00:02:12.040
and i'll just do a couple of leg raises
but the most important thing here to

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:16.459
look at is that I'm keeping my knee
locked in a flex position.

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:18.609
I'm keeping that knee locked, alright?

00:02:18.609 --> 00:02:22.959
So once I've activated it four or five times
I get into the same position again, bent

00:02:22.959 --> 00:02:27.029
knee purpointing straightforward let this
leg up, alright?

00:02:27.029 --> 00:02:31.430
Drive upwards, now I apply
immense pressure because that's such a

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:35.579
strong muscle. It's about the second
strongest muscle in our body. Push as hard as

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:40.609
I can and then let that muscle lower
the heel to the ground. And I will now

00:02:40.609 --> 00:02:44.689
feel the belly of the muscle starting to
release and that's a good

00:02:44.689 --> 00:02:46.870
active way to stretch the Soleus.

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:49.510
And you'll do this about three times so
again.

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:53.489
Front foot up, knee bent and locked,

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:57.009
head up, drive upwards, really push very hard

00:02:57.009 --> 00:03:01.049
and slowly lower that heel to the
ground and you can feel the belly of the

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:03.450
muscle releasing. So you have a

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.719
lengthening sensation going on

00:03:05.719 --> 00:03:07.729
in this part of the muscle.

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:11.489
So keep that Soleuses loose. One of the most
important running muscles that we have

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:13.390
in our bodies and good luck out there.
