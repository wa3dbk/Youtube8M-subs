00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:10.710
Hi, I'm Dave Gearhart, chancellor of the University
of Arkansas.

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:12.660
I hope you had a great summer.

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:16.520
I'd like to take a moment to welcome you back
to campus. If this is your first semester

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:21.420
at the university, in any capacity, then I
want to welcome you aboard-you're in for a

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.080
great experience.

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:27.849
Our incoming freshman class promises to be
the biggest, most diverse, and academically

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:29.929
accomplished of any we've ever had.

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:35.070
I also want to welcome back our returning
students, staff, and faculty. I hope you were

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:40.540
able to get some time off over the summer
to get rested and ready for the coming year.

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:44.790
Additional thanks are owed to our faculty
and staff for their hard work and dedication

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:51.960
to our students. I am extremely disappointed
we had to delay salary increases, and I thank

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:57.330
you for your patience and understanding. We
remain very hopeful we can give increases

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:01.740
soon and retroactively. At least that is our
plan.

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:06.390
If campus seems unusually busy, it's because
we're anticipating a record in enrollment.

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.890
While we won't have final numbers until the
11th day of class, we are expecting enrollment

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:16.741
to approach 21,000 for the first time in the
history of this institution. The University

00:01:16.741 --> 00:01:22.310
of Arkansas is clearly the top choice of students
across the state, and we intend to stay that

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:23.420
way.

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.609
By now, many of you will have noticed there's
been a significant change to the campus landscape

00:01:27.609 --> 00:01:32.179
over the summer. This is one of the ways we
are addressing growth. The bookstore has been

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:37.049
moved to a much larger, more accessible site
in the newly built Garland Center, adjacent

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:42.109
to the Garland Avenue Parking Garage. The
move will allow Intramural Recreational Sports

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:47.520
to open a satellite fitness center in the
Union in the next year or so , and allow the

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:52.619
Student Technology Center to move into an
expanded space to include a larger computer

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:56.100
lab and provide more services.

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:00.259
Renovations are also underway on a number
of other buildings, including Davis Hall,

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:05.549
Peabody Hall, and Walton Hall, which has been
reopened as a residence hall. With the help

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:10.459
of the Donald W. Reynolds Foundation, we will
be adding a new addition to Vol Walker Hall,

00:02:10.459 --> 00:02:14.850
and we will also be renovating Ozark Hall
and adding an addition for the Honors College

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:17.409
with the aid of private support.

00:02:17.409 --> 00:02:22.280
These are just some of the changes you'll
find this year. You will also notice we are

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.800
redoing a number of our labs and classrooms.
As a matter of fact, I am standing in one

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.000
of them right now in the Science Building.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.879
As you settle into your new classes, buy books,
find your classrooms, catch up with colleagues,

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:40.370
make new friends, and relocate old ones, I
want to extend to you my best wishes for your

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:41.439
semester.

00:02:41.439 --> 00:02:47.010
Thank you for choosing the University of Arkansas
to work or to study, and good luck with your

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:47.590
semester.
