Hi I'm Bob Schmidt with HomeRemodelWorkshop

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:06.170
I've received a lot of requests from
people telling me that they have

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:09.469
plumbing problems in their bathroom
that they have a smell coming from the

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:10.880
shower drain

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:14.040
but they say that the drain is draining

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.190
fine in that there's no water problems
showing through the ceiling downstairs

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:22.560
usually if that's the case it's
another issue other than a plumbing

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.130
problem usually it's a cleaning problem
I'll show you how to take care

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.410
of that.

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:29.850
 

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:33.270
Pretty much no matter how much you clean
this floor and keep this clean

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.010
there's one area that you'll never be
able to clean and just having

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:41.739
water run over it isn't going to be enough
its inside your drain trap between here

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:44.370
and the top of the water that's down in your
trap

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:48.400
what you need to do is very carefully
take out the two screws that are holding the

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.960
drain cover on

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.989
be very careful that you don't lose them 
so that you don't have to go

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:58.840
find a replacement for them set them aside
where they won't be knocked down into

00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:59.610
the drain

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:04.110
as you can see it's real easy to see
once that cover is off

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.530
exactly where that odor is coming from

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.590
here's a way I found to take care of that

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:16.820
What I like to do is I like to take a
paint roller

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:21.250
just the standard size paint roller
because as you can see in there there are

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:22.770
little grooves and edges that will

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.920
be very difficult to get to and you know
this stuff on top is pretty obvious and

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.030
on the backside of the drain that can be cleaned off easily

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.770
it is the stuff inside down to the trap of the
water so what I do is I take a bucket of

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:36.930
hot water with my favorite cleaning

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.070
product I take my paint roller sleeve or
my roller cover

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:44.200
get it wet inside that mixture of

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.689
soapy product simply

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:51.729
working back and forth sliding it down in
the hole

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:54.979
it should just about go down until it
reaches the

00:01:54.979 --> 00:02:00.540
water in the trap keep working it
back and forth

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.920
bring it back up and as you can see

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:10.140
by looking down in the hole it is already
getting cleaner repeat the

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:10.940
process a

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:16.280
half a dozen times until your pretty
happy with the results

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.519
as you can see with just a couple of
minutes of cleaning all that grime is

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:20.250
gone

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:24.340
and we're ready to put the

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:29.250
cover back on and hopefully we will be smell free in here for

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:34.360
quite a while so there you go hopefully you appreciated this tip and it will become

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:37.760
useful to you and you won't have that
smell problem in your shower anymore

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:42.190
