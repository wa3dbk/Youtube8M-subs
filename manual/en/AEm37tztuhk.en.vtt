00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:05.129
Today on this 2007 Toyota RAV4 we will be
installing the wiring harness part number

00:00:05.129 --> 00:00:06.129
118412.

00:00:06.129 --> 00:00:11.000
We are inside the rear cargo area of the RAV4.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.429
The ports that we are going to be plugging
our wiring harness into are located behind

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.700
the interior panels of the vehicle directly
behind the tail lights.

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:20.050
That is going to be the same on both sides
of the vehicle.

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:22.650
We are going to need to remove a few things
to gain access to those ports.

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.870
First off being the middle threshold piece
because we are going to be routing wires from

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:27.870
one side to the other.

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:31.780
Lets go ahead and start uninstalling the interior
of the vehicle.

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:37.180
We will also need to remove the rear section
of the interior panel, there are clips here

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:50.090
that we are going to need to release to open
that up, there are also a couple of screws.

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:54.801
With the cargo door removed as well just look
right back here again just right behind the

00:00:54.801 --> 00:00:58.080
tail light you can see the port that we are
going to be plugging our harness into.

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:04.350
We just want to disconnect those two pieces
and we will plug our harness in line.

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:05.880
01:03
Over here on the driver side we are going

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:32.350
to be plugging the ports in with the yellow
and brown wires.

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:36.740
Next we want to go back over to the driver
side and go ahead and ground our white wire.

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:43.819
I am going to ground it to the metal inside
the compartment.

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:49.039
Next we need to go ahead and connect our large
lead of black wire that comes with our wiring

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:53.780
harness kit to the red lead coming off of
our modulite box.

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.889
The black wire we are going to feed underneath
the vehicle and route it all the way up to

00:01:56.889 --> 00:01:59.279
the positive side of the battery.

00:01:59.279 --> 00:02:04.200
Connect the red wire to the black wire using
the provided butt connector.

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:15.680
I am just going to take a piece of electrical
tape and wrap up the connection point.

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:20.180
We are also going to need to find a grommet
on the inside of the vehicle to allow us to

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:21.849
get the black wire underneath the vehicle.

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:27.900
If you look directly in the back side here
you have got this black grommet right here

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:28.900
that we can use.

00:02:28.900 --> 00:03:17.209
What I am going to do is just put a slice

00:03:17.209 --> 00:03:43.810
in it 
and we 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:04:27.540
will 
be able to push our black 

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:40.190
wire through there 

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:52.790
and underneath the vehicle.

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:55.380
