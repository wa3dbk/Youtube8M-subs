00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:08.360
&gt;&gt;CTA customers value their time

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:10.909
and since CTA values its customers

00:00:10.909 --> 00:00:15.459
it is doing whatever it can to take the guesswork out of bus arrivals.

00:00:15.459 --> 00:00:21.010
Bus Tracker texting information is now available at every CTA bus stop.

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:24.010
Every single one.

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:34.270
&gt;&gt;"Yeah, I use it everyday for the Fullerton Bus.

00:00:34.270 --> 00:00:37.670
And its always accurate, always on time."

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:40.850
&gt;&gt;"I can plan, just so I won't be late for classes

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:42.650
or wherever I'm going."

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:43.960
&gt;&gt;"It actually does help a lot, due to the cold,

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:46.129
Due to traffic and stuff like that, 

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:48.850
it does help."

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:52.700
&gt;&gt;"It just makes it so that I'm not late for work."

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:58.640
&gt;&gt;The CTA knows its customers love Bus Tracker, it also knows not everyone has a smartphone

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.040
to access the internet based tracking sysyem.

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:03.540
That's why there's Bus Tracker texting.

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:08.240
&gt;&gt;"The market wanted more and the customers wanted more, with other devices on the market like

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:12.010
cellphones, so we moved into the texting environment"

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.260
&gt;&gt;"So if you don't have access to a computer, or you don't have a phone that has internet access

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:18.570
but you have the ability to text, 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.430
this gives you the opportunity to

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.280
also receive bus tracker information, so you're not left out."

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:29.150
&gt;&gt;Every CTA bus stop sign now has the identification code needed to get a bus arrival text.

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:31.750
&gt;&gt;"Yup, every single bus stop."

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:39.610
&gt;&gt;A pilot program was tested at 42 locations in early 2010. Based on usage and customer feedback

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:42.500
the program expanded to all bus stops on the system.

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:42.000
&gt;&gt;"That particular application has exploded in the last couple of months." 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:48.120
&gt;&gt;"In the month of July before we started the installation of all the bustop ID stickers

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:49.600
we were averaging about 10,000 texts,

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.979
two way texts on a given day,

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:56.570
and for the month of September we were averaging about 24,000." 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:57.909
&gt;&gt;Here's how to use Bus Tracker texting:

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:01.030
Text the message CTABUS, one word,

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:02.400
then add a space,

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:05.640
then type in the route ID number on the
bus stop sign.

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.229
Send the text two 41-411.

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:10.759
In just a few seconds you'll get a text back.

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:14.840
&gt;&gt;"We quickly send you back a response with the top three next arriving buses."

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.849
&gt;&gt;We used a Blackberry with a bright screen for demonstration purposes.

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:20.440
But any phone with texting capability will work. 

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:25.000
&gt;&gt;"Older cell phones, newer cell phones, smart phones and whatever else may be coming down the line."

00:02:26.919 --> 00:02:29.119
&gt;&gt;Best of all, the CTA doesn't charge for the service.

00:02:29.119 --> 00:02:32.739
&gt;&gt;"There is no cost to using the text messaging feature of Bus Tracker

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:35.599
only your usual text messaging 

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:37.939
service charges that you might pay in your plan."

00:02:37.939 --> 00:02:39.560
&gt;&gt;For even more convenience

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:43.610
customers can sign up to have Bus Tracker texts sent to them at a  

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:44.889
designated time each day.

00:02:44.889 --> 00:02:47.249
Say you always end your work day at 5:00,

00:02:47.249 --> 00:02:51.929
you can get a text at 5:01 everyday with
your estimated bus arrival times.

00:02:51.929 --> 00:02:56.569
&gt;&gt;"You send our application the information, bus stop that you're looking to get the information for,

00:02:56.569 --> 00:03:00.920
the time that you'd like to deal with, either one particular time or multiples and at that

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:05.440
particular designated time point, you'll get the information you need."

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:06.269
&gt;&gt;How great is that?

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:07.430
Really great,

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:12.239
according to the growing legions of Bus Tracker Fans who use the technology everyday.

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:16.469
&gt;&gt;"We all rely on the bus to get around, because having a car is to expensive in the city.

00:03:16.469 --> 00:03:20.469
So, having bus tracker and having text messaging available is great."

00:03:29.439 --> 00:03:33.459
&gt;&gt;There are nearly 12,000 CTA bus stop locations in the service area.
