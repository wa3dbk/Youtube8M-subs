00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:11.190
Hello boys and girls, this is Aunt Frenita and I have wonderful story for you, called "God’s 10 Rules"

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:21.000
Today's memory verse is from Exodus 19:9. It says, “We will do everything the Lord has said.”

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000
The message for today's story is "We thank God for showing us how to live."

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.310
Do you have some rules in your house?

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.580
Rules such as not eating between meals or putting your toys away?

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:37.550
Rules help us and they helped the Israelites too.

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:40.120
The Israelites were still in the desert.

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:43.290
It had been three months since they had left Egypt.

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:49.980
They were camped beside a mountain when God told Moses He had something very important He wanted to tell His people.

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.550
God promised Moses that if the Israelites would follow His directions,

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:57.760
they would live happier and healthier lives.

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:59.200
He would bless them,

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:03.080
and people in other nations would see how much God loved them,

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:05.750
and they would want to know about God too.

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:10.340
The people promised, “We will do everything the Lord has said.”

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:14.280
Moses was to tell the people that God wanted to talk with them.

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:17.270
He was to have them get ready to meet with God.

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:21.820
So the people washed their clothes and they made sure that they were clean too.

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:23.820
Even behind their ears!

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.820
Then the people fasted.

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:31.990
Which means they didn’t eat food, but they drank water instead. And they prayed.

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:37.100
Three days later God came to the top of the mountain in a cloud of thunder and lightning.

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.840
The people heard loud trumpet blasts.

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.740
They saw the mountain shake.

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:43.400
And they were afraid!

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:46.280
But God didn’t want the Israelites to be afraid.

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:47.710
He loved them.

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:53.260
He spoke directly to them and told them about 10 special rules He wanted them to live by.

00:01:53.260 --> 00:01:56.000
We call those rules the Ten Commandments.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.300
Do you know them?

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:58.780
Let's review them.

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:05.380
Number 1: Love God the most, and don’t love things or people more than God.

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:12.480
Number 2: Worship only God. You don’t need idols or things to look at to worship Him.

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:17.900
Number 3: Speak God’s name with reverence and respect.

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:25.990
Number 4: Keep the Sabbath day holy. The Sabbath day is a special day spent with God each week.

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:32.100
Number 5: Treat your mom and dad with respect and obedience.

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:41.520
Number 6: The life of others is important; don’t hate or hurt others. Care for those who are needy or hurting.

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:46.020
Number 7: Be faithful to the person you marry.

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:50.260
Number 8: Don’t take things that aren’t yours.

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:54.030
Number 9: Always tell the truth.

00:02:54.030 --> 00:03:00.620
And number 10: Be happy with what you have; don’t want other people’s things.

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:03.020
Those were the Ten Commandments.

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:06.610
Then God told Moses to come up to the top of the mountain.

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:12.080
There God wrote those 10 important rules for happy living on stone tablets.

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:14.860
God didn’t use a pencil or a pen.

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:19.080
He wrote on the stone tablets with His own finger!

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:22.560
God gave us rules to live by because He loves us.

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:27.050
He promises that if we obey them, we will always be happy.

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:32.410
When we obey God and live as He asks us to, we are worshiping Him.

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:34.410
He will help us obey Him.

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:38.190
Let’s remember to thank God for showing us how to live.
