00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:05.070
If you've completed your run, or strenuous
workout, I suggest cooling down for at least

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:11.320
ten minutes. I'm going to demonstrate a couple
of stretches for you, but first, before you

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:16.240
stretch, I suggest running at a very slow
pace for about five minutes to bring your

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:24.420
heart rate down. The stretches I'm going to
show you, will stretch, once again, your quadriceps

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:30.100
and your hamstrings -- the most important
muscle groups to stretch after a run. First,

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:35.480
I'll demonstrate the hamstring stretch. What
you're going to do, you're going to bring

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:42.180
your foot in towards your inner thigh. Standing
up nice and tall, you never want to hunch

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:47.880
over -- this places excess strain on the lower
back, so stay tall and bend forward at your

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:57.190
hips. You're going to reach down toward your
toe without excessively straining. You should

00:00:57.190 --> 00:01:03.200
just feel a slight stretch in your hamstring,
maybe a little bit in your calf as well. And

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:12.859
once again you're going to hold for about
fifteen to twenty seconds. And, repeat on

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:24.409
the other side.

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:30.649
Moving along to the quadriceps stretch, the
front of the thigh. You're going to go ahead

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:35.329
and lay on your side. You can either hold
yourself up with your arm, or you can lay

00:01:35.329 --> 00:01:41.079
flat. Whatever is most comfortable for you.
Once again, you're just going to hold onto

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:47.749
the top of your foot, bring your heel into
your glut, and keep your knee pointed straight

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:58.029
toward your opposite foot. And, gently pull,
and hold for about fifteen to twenty seconds.

00:01:58.029 --> 00:02:02.369
And you're going to repeat that on the other
side as well. Make sure you cool down after

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:11.219
a run to prevent injuries, prevent you from
becoming too sore the next day, and it will

00:02:11.219 --> 00:02:16.269
leave you with a sense of accomplishment.
I'm Jeannette Stojcevski with Expert Village.

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:21.760
Hope you've enjoyed watching how to become
an expert runner today. We've gone over plenty

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:30.230
of things to learn, and to practice. The warm
up stretches, proper posture, proper alignment,

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:41.019
drills, proper stride, proper heel-toe strike,
and cooling down. Now I hope you'll take these

00:02:41.019 --> 00:02:48.040
and you'll practice so that you can become
an expert runner. Running is a wonderful sport

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:52.470
to engage in -- if you can, if you're healthy,
your joints are healthy, I really recommend

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:57.659
you give it a try. It's great exercise. It's
not only great for the body, but it's a great

00:02:57.659 --> 00:03:03.840
tool to use to calm down after a stressful
day, helps clear the mind, leaves you feeling

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:10.310
wonderful. So, I hope that you'll enjoy running
as much as I do, and I hope you've enjoyed

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:12.310
watching. Thank you so much, take care.
