Hi, my name is Dave Andrews. Today I'm going
to show you how to trouble shoot a crashing

00:00:06.929 --> 00:00:12.010
computer. There's several things that can
cause your computer to crash. First thing

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:15.870
that we're going to check is what programs
are running in the background of your computer.

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.070
Those usually cause most of your crashes.
As you can see, I've got several programs

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:25.849
here that are running. To see what programs
run, click on your start button and go up

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:35.700
to run. Now type in msconfig, or ms, like
Microsoft Configuration and just click okay.

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:43.240
Now you have to an administrator to run this
and if it asks you, you have to click continue.

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:49.640
Now what we're interested in is the startup
tab. This is a list of all the programs that

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:54.790
run when your computer starts up. These use
memory and could possibly crash and cause

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:59.721
your computer to crash. To keep a program
from running, just unchecked it, you hit a

00:00:59.721 --> 00:01:05.810
click or I'm hitting the space bar to do that.
Now when you've unchecked the ones that you

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:09.439
think might be causing the problems, which
could be all of them, you have the option

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:20.499
to enable all or disable all. Just simply
click on okay, now it save your changes. Now

00:01:20.499 --> 00:01:24.079
the second thing to check is maybe your hard
drive have some troubles. Open up your My

00:01:24.079 --> 00:01:31.109
Computer, right click on your c drive and
go to properties and then click tools and

00:01:31.109 --> 00:01:37.429
under error checking, let's click check now.
Again, you have to be an administrator and

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:43.359
we will check both of these check boxes and
click start. Now the next time our computer

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:47.209
reboots, it's going to run through a disk
check. That will check your hard drive for

00:01:47.209 --> 00:01:56.270
any problems. My name is Dave Andrews and
I've just showed you how to troubleshoot a

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:57.210
crashing computer.
