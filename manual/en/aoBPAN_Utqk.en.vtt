Hi Everyone! Welcome to Wendy's Lookbook.

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:07.870
We are here in Chicago!

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:10.200
Which is the perfect place

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.350
to do a winter episode.

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:14.440
We're going to be playing with layering 

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:16.080
and different types of outwear

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:18.080
to keep us warm yet stylish.

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:20.160
I can't wait to share with you the outfits,

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.350
so let's get started.

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:49.670
This is our first look,

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.400
and I have four layers on.

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:55.880
And the top layer is an all weather trench coat,

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.750
which helps fight against the wind very well

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:00.040
to keep us really warm.

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:03.300
And underneath, I have a thermal on,

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.770
and over that, a cashmere sweater dress.

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:10.070
and over that, an oversized cardigan.

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:12.590
and we don't want to lose our waistline in the process

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:14.920
so we're cinching it with a belt

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.140
to give us that nice shape.

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:19.940
But this look is great for shopping

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:22.570
when we're weaving in and out of stores.

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.240
This is our second look.

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.760
I love, love, love using faux fur vests as layering pieces

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:02.220
because it adds instant texture and dimension to any look.

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:05.060
And since our vest doesn't have any sleeves,

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:09.610
it really cuts down on the bulk, keeping our upper half slim.

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.180
To finish it off,

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.630
we're using our wool coat to streamline 

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:15.270
and make it look very chic.

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.070
This look is great for sight-seeing

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.280
and/or visiting the museum.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.840
This is our last outfit

00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:16.840
and it is WINDY

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.840
with a captial I.

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.280
Now I know why it's called the Windy City.

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:24.590
And we're playing with another form of outerwear

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:25.850
which is the parka.

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:28.750
It is thick and it is wind resistant

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.300
so it helps keep us warm.

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:32.690
And I'm holding my parka like this because

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:35.900
I don't want the wind to take off my hood so my head gets really cold.

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:39.640
To give life to our whole outfit, we're adding some color.

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:42.360
We're adding a striped turtleneck

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:44.700
and a plaid button-up.

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:47.700
But this outfit is great for running errands

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:50.420
going to school, any place that we need to keep warm.

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:53.130
especially when we're enjoying some festivities.

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:24.450
Thank you so much for being with me

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:26.210
I hope you had fun!

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:30.820
And thank you so much for your support in 2011.

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:34.240
We can't wait to produce more videos

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:38.370
and share more adventures with you this year in 2012.

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:40.160
Thank you. *kiss*

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:42.500
and see you soon on Youtube-land!

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:43.670
Bye!
