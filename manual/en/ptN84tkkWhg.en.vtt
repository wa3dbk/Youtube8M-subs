This is Richard Goms, we're in Murray, Utah,
we're talking about basic car care. I'm going

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:12.330
to show you now how to change your own air
filter. Its actually a very simple job. Most

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:21.840
cars, the air filter is inside one of these
plastic boxes either on this side or the other

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:30.289
side of the car and usually there is some
kind of a hose tubing, rubber tubing mechanism

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:37.219
that goes over from the air cleaner over to
the fuel injection, over to the engine. These

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:46.579
are fairly easy to change. They have clips
that, they're a little tight but they can

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:53.039
be released with a little pressure and you
don't have to do like the old cars where you

00:00:53.039 --> 00:00:59.659
have to get out tools and wrenches and screwdrivers
and stuff. There's one in the back here too

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:08.960
holding it on. Now what we're going to do
is there is some tabs back here that hold

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:13.930
the back end in place, the clips hold the
front end in place so we're going to lift

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:22.700
up and pull back to release those tabs in
the back. So this is the filter and this what

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:33.880
the filter looks like. As you can see, its
pretty dirty. Let's go ahead and change that.

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:43.469
We bought a new filter at the auto parts store.
Comes in a box and there's a bag inside that

00:01:43.469 --> 00:01:52.200
keeps it clean. We're going to take it out
of the bag and then we're going to slide this

00:01:52.200 --> 00:02:00.189
back in where the old one came out. Make sure
its seated well and then I'm going to do everything

00:02:00.189 --> 00:02:12.320
in reverse. I'm going to slide these black
tabs in to this side and then make sure that

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:22.800
the top of the box is seated properly and
then I can clip these tabs, these clips, right

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:23.720
back into place.
