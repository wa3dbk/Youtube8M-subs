Hi I am Gwynne Mimms lead stylist for Ojon.

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:07.620
Today on our model Marissa I am going to show
you how to recreate a look we are seeing

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.120
all over the summer runways and that’s big
bouncy volume.

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:14.930
In order to build a bouncy style you have
to start from wet hair all the way to dry.

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:16.760
So I like to prepare the hair.

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:18.820
I love the Ojon volume advance shampoo and
conditioner.

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:22.580
That’s going to kind of get the ball rolling,
helping build

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:24.939
in some volume, really plumping up the hair.

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:29.239
After that while the hair is wet for think
hair I am taking about a golf ball size amount

00:00:29.239 --> 00:00:33.940
of the volumizing foam and working it in from
the roots of the hair all the way through

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:35.510
the mid lengths to the ends.

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:40.250
This is going to give me amazing lift, amazing
hold , and a real great ease with blow drying

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:43.070
cause it is helping me control the hair as
I go.

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:47.579
Using a blow dryer with a nozzle and a round
brush I am going to be lifting the hair straight

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.210
off the head to give her nice, big bouncy
blow dry.

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:54.829
I love natural bristle brushes because the
polish the hair more and are less damaging.

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:58.210
And I also like to use on thicker hair giving
a lot of bounce,

00:00:58.210 --> 00:00:59.620
about a two inch brush.

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:03.749
It’s just a lot easier, especially on myself
to use my hands a lot.

00:01:03.749 --> 00:01:07.600
You can simply life the hair with a lot of
tension straight from the root.

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:12.370
And you are putting the heat all the way up
to the root.

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:16.810
Once that part of the hair is dry you can
then start going through and start to polish

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:20.060
it through the mid-lengths to the ends .
One great thing to remember while you are

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.720
styling your hair is that it is the hot air
that is forming it and the cooling down that

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:25.720
is setting it.

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:29.250
If I let it sit here and using my brush almost
like a hot roller or a velcro roller and letting

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:34.560
it cool off by the time you release it,
it is set into this nice big bouncy loose

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:35.560
wave.

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.979
Another great tip, I always like to tell my
clients to sit down while they are blow drying

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:39.979
their hair.

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:42.060
There is something about it when you are
sitting there you are able to get a little

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:45.460
bit more mobility and won’t get as worn
out when you style your hair too.

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:50.360
Any time you are trying to
create volume in your hair, remember to direct

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:51.752
it outside of its point of growth.

00:01:51.752 --> 00:01:56.370
So if your hair naturally grows like this,
pull it in the other direction.

00:01:56.370 --> 00:02:01.289
Forcing it out of its natural home is what
is going to give it all that lift.Finish it

00:02:01.289 --> 00:02:03.140
off with a light hairspray.

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.880
By using the right products and having the
right expert tips up your sleeve you are going

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:08.220
to be able to achieve any look at home.

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.480
You are going to have a long lasting style
with lots of lift, lots of bounce looking

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:12.780
like it’s right off the runways.
