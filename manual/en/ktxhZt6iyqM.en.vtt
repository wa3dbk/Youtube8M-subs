Hey guys and welcome to astrology

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:10.179
my name is david and I run the website
of astroroom dot com

00:00:10.179 --> 00:00:12.409
is using the links below

00:00:12.409 --> 00:00:15.690
this would be the first video in a
series of different topics on astrology

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.949
that i hope to be doing the future

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:22.260
as you've probably already gathered from the
title

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.240
you see it on my show it to you

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:28.369
this video is going to be about moon
signs in astrology

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:31.449
if you could please you new to the
subject you may not be that i heard

00:00:31.449 --> 00:00:33.110
about in his eyes he did

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:36.540
but i'm sure you've heard about so zodiac
signs of starsign

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.800
and you know you're so excited

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.520
well the so decide is nothing but the
sun's position

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.110
has certain of the soviet

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:47.130
at the time of year old daughter

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:49.870
so we call it is to set aside

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:51.510
the very same way

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.250
uh... you moon sign would be the moon's
decision

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:58.730
the soviet tried to deliver

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:01.450
now the main difference between the some
of the mood

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:04.020
from an astrological perspective

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:07.200
it's a speed boat which they travel
through the zodiac

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.840
now this summer will stay in the same so
did sign for about thirty days the whole

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:11.600
month

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.390
which you may know already

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:17.700
uh... the mood on the other hand that
will cross over much foster

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.850
what seems so exciting city two or three
days

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.370
making much more difficult for the for
someone who's not interest on teacher

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:25.440
extreme northern

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:27.360
that moon sign

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.020
calculating using services to find out

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:36.510
so before you do anything else find out
your moon sign

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:38.850
of course you already know your some
side

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.460
and realized that the moon sign will be
just as important to kansas on sign

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:47.610
in determining your personality

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:51.869
why is the movement so important

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:55.960
the recently so important is mainly
because he works from the inside

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:57.450
most of the law the reader

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.240
of our conscious self

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.159
this is very different from the some

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:04.180
which is part of our self-expression

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.530
part of a conscious self-expression

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:10.759
something that we are proud of something
that we want to shine with

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:13.159
something that we have learned to

00:02:13.159 --> 00:02:16.339
to express is a part of our selves

00:02:16.339 --> 00:02:18.989
and nineteen you look yourself in the
mirror

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:20.189
this is me

00:02:20.189 --> 00:02:23.200
i know myself i know what i'm proud of
the know what i need

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:24.669
this is that

00:02:24.669 --> 00:02:26.619
that's mostly the sun speaking

00:02:26.619 --> 00:02:31.059
because we've kind of latino ourselves
throughout some

00:02:31.059 --> 00:02:35.079
meanwhile in the background the moon may
be screaming no when no that's not what

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:36.989
i want that's not what i mean it all

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:39.739
in a way back that in some way

00:02:39.739 --> 00:02:41.200
ordinary saying an

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:45.259
you kunnen right but that's all that
needs to get you should see to it

00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:47.049
or if you're competing lucky

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:48.669
into many saying

00:02:48.669 --> 00:02:52.989
g definitely right brother some has just
walk hand in hand together towards the

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:56.279
sunset

00:02:56.279 --> 00:02:59.889
some of the moon i've known as the two
lights in astrology

00:02:59.889 --> 00:03:04.869
in a single two most important points of
focusing on natal horoscope

00:03:04.869 --> 00:03:08.829
and understanding the dynamics between
the sun and moon who do you agree to a

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:09.989
good and

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:13.699
probably give you some self knowledge
that you didn't have before

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:18.209
understanding potential conflicts
between the sun the moon this much like

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:20.279
understanding conflicts between

00:03:20.279 --> 00:03:24.680
traditionally male and female
counterparts in your psyche

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:28.919
the moon in your horoscope will tell you
how you relate to motion only

00:03:28.919 --> 00:03:33.859
what you need to feel secure how you go
about caring about for other people

00:03:33.859 --> 00:03:35.479
the some of the other hand

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:37.769
at will show the will to

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:39.659
buy-in for yourself

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:43.999
so always be characteristics character
traits that we try to build ourselves

00:03:43.999 --> 00:03:48.899
around and that's that's always a part
of our identity

00:03:48.899 --> 00:03:52.709
okay this was a very short instruction
to moon signs into the difference

00:03:52.709 --> 00:03:55.549
between the some of the moon in
astrology

00:03:55.549 --> 00:03:59.419
the next video i'm going to go into
individual who signs such as luminaries

00:03:59.419 --> 00:04:01.139
and talk about that

00:04:01.139 --> 00:04:03.439
but it'll be a good enjoyed this see you
next time
