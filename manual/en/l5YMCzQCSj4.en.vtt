00:00:01.270 --> 00:00:05.540
You've noticed your baby is all stuffed up,
and you think shes got a cold. My name is

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:09.850
Beverly Bitterman, ARNP, health and wellness
consultant, with a few tips and strategies

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:16.180
for you. If a baby has a plain, ordinary,
garden variety cold the baby won't have a

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:21.680
fever, however the baby may be pretty fussy,
you may notice drainage coming out the baby's

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:27.710
nose, and you might notice the change of the
baby's appetite or willingness to eat, so

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:32.029
these would be hallmarks of a baby with cold.
What you're wanting to do is keep your child

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:37.760
comfortable until the cold goes away, and
you also want to observe for signs that might

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:44.520
indicate a secondary infection, like an ear
infection has taken place. So as long as the

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:52.140
baby is fever free, or has a low grade fever,
say under a hundred, and the drainage is reasonable,

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.780
I think you could probably treat that at home.
We no longer recommend that infants be given

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:04.519
cold formulas, over the counter cold formulas,
so you're really limited to things that are

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:12.700
comforting. One thing you can do is get a
small bulb syringe at the drug store, and

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:17.259
you can- what you do is squeeze the bulb,
and then it sort of sucks out, it kind of

00:01:17.259 --> 00:01:21.899
blows the nose for the baby, for it, and it
gets that mucous out of their nose so they

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:26.850
can breathe better, it's a good idea to do
that before you nurse or bottle feed, because

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:32.380
that will help them. You can also use saline
nose drops, that salt water nose drops, and

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:38.130
you can but those made up at the drug store
as well. You can make them up yourself, but

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:44.789
for a baby I think I would use the kind that
you buy at the drug store. Moisturize the

00:01:44.789 --> 00:01:50.500
air, you can get a humidifier or boil some
water on the stove, things that make the air

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:58.599
a little bit more humid will help your baby.
You also may find that breast milk works well,

00:01:58.599 --> 00:02:03.819
but if the baby is on a regular formula, they
may or may not want to take it. If for a day

00:02:03.819 --> 00:02:08.989
or so they drink more water, or something
like a pedialyte or an electrolyte formula,

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:13.680
that will be just fine. If the baby develops
a fever, particularly if it gets, say over

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:20.530
102, if the baby suddenly seems very cranky,
and you're wondering if they have an ear infection,

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:24.570
go ahead and call your pediatrician, they'll
understand, and they'll be happy to see your

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:30.780
child. The other thing that you can think
about doing is, something like a Vicks or

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:37.290
a eucalyptus, you can even put that right
on the babies cheek. My name is Beverly Bitterman

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:41.989
ARNP health and wellness consultant, and I
hope your baby's cold gets better right away.
