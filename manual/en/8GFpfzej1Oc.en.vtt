00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:10.733
Walkthrough animations can be previewed and 
played in Revit.

00:00:10.733 --> 00:00:16.099
Export your animation as an AVI movie to share 
the animations with someone not using Revit.

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:22.333
First open the walkthrough view from the project 
browser to select the walkthrough you are 
exporting.

00:00:22.333 --> 00:00:24.799
Now use the application menu.

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:32.100
Then navigate to Export, Images and Animations, 
and then click Walkthrough.

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:38.200
In the Length/Format dialog the frame range and 
frames per second are specified.

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:43.200
The total number of frames and the frames per 
second determine the length of the animation.

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:49.333
A frame rate of 15 frames per second is typically 
adequate for playback on a computer.

00:00:49.333 --> 00:00:54.599
If the animation is going to be played back on a 
TV or used in video production, 

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:59.833
consider exporting the animation at a frame rate 
as high as 30.  

00:00:59.833 --> 00:01:06.133
If the frame rate is changed the total number of 
frames in the walkthrough will need to be also 
changed 

00:01:06.133 --> 00:01:11.066
to maintain the desired animation length.

00:01:11.066 --> 00:01:19.932
When editing the walkthrough frames, the speed 
of the camera movement is altered by changing 
the accelerator factor for a key frame.

00:01:19.933 --> 00:01:26.233
Higher numbers will move the camera faster and 
lower numbers will slow the camera movement.

00:01:26.233 --> 00:01:30.533
Adjust the camera speed as required for your 
project. 

00:01:30.533 --> 00:01:37.699
Set visual style of the animation and the size(in 
pixels) in the format section of the dialog.

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:45.100
Changes made in the Length/Format Dialog will 
have a direct impact on the time it takes to export 
the animation.

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:50.400
Number of frames, shaded, shadows and 
rendered visual styles, as well larger dimensions

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:56.166
will all increase the export time of the 
walkthrough.

00:01:56.166 --> 00:02:00.866
Select a location and name for the exported AVI 
file.

00:02:00.866 --> 00:02:09.599
Video compression codecs installed on your 
computer can be used to compress the size of 
the completed AVI file.

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:16.366
Use the completed AVI file in your project 
presentations as you would any other video file.
