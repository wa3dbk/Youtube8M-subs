00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:09.800
Nika: Cutesy oozes and YOUR first chance to sound off in this Showcase!

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.600
Summoners, you're taking time out of your gaming schedule to see cool stuff, right? 

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:22.700
The League of Legends community has cool stuff. To me, the solution is obvious. So we have a show just for it. 

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:27.900
I'm excited. Are you excited? I know somebody who's super excited, and that's Zac! He's like, PERMA excited! 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.700
"HELLO I AM A ZAC I AM SOMEHOW FUZZY AND TOTALLY PUMPED TO BE HERE ARE YOU PUMPED I AM PUMPED." 

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:38.500
Yuko made this felted figure of our new, bubbly champion, and placed him in the brush so he could dance around and not cause a ruckus.

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:42.700
Put your globby hands in the aaair... and give us a beat, DodgedLoL.

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:57.500
More. More of what ever that is. Percussion music, made of LoL sounds, are you even kidding me?!

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.500
How can I even focus on anythi- AAAAH VOLIPUPPY!

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:06.700
This precious little doggy is only a few weeks old, and it's just UNFAIR that znomy sent in pictures this adorable. 

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:07.400
It's just not fa- 

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.100
AAAAAH NOT FAIR NOT FAIR NOT FAIR! 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:18.400
I am going... to adopt... some kind of animal... unless JoyPyonn can distract me with her fantastic art. Oh good, she can.

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.600
Here we have a sample of fantastic stuff that Joy can do.

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:29.600
Her League of Legends art is a vast repertoire of pretty ladies, including Lux, Ashe, the charming hues of Nami, and Syndra's dark orbs.

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:36.600
If you were excited for Season Three of League, I can definitely relate, but our enthusiasm pales in comparison to this trio. 

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:41.400
theDURRRRIAN inked up this staggering trifecta of champions, who are ready for battle. 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.500
Embrace the night indeed... and beware if you go to any goth clubs. These guys are TOTALLY going to there.

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.400
And now, for something completely different. You get to be on the show.

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.400
Yes! You! Speak up in a new ongoing feature we call "All Chat".

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:00.700
icy12ice: Hey, my summoner name is icy12rice, and I've been an enforcer at the Riot booth these past couple of PAX's.

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:05.500
I think the thing that stands out the most in my mind is just how easy it is to meet a fellow summoner,

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:10.800
and have them go from being a complete stranger, to basically playing ARAM's with them until 2 in the morning. 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.200
Lyanisu: We love League so much that we named out dog "Kayle".

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:21.100
FWPX: My name is Scott, my summoner name is FWPX, and I actually met my best friend in a game of ARAM. 

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:27.500
Between my Lux bindings and her Nocturne fears, we were like, "Hey, we should probably keep playing this game together."

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.500
And there was also the time that I got a pentakill on Heimerdinger just by pushing R and then W. 

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:32.500
Thanks rockets!

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:37.100
Summoners have a broad spectrum of talent, and not all of us are artists. 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:43.600
I'm not. But we all play League of Legends. We're all passionate about it. And most importantly, we all have stories. 

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:49.900
So we wanna hear them! For all the summoners who can't draw a straight line, and who have never baked a cake, this one is for you. 

00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:54.400
In our next "All Chat", tell us about your FIRST game of League of Legends. 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:59.700
Make a short reply video, I can show you how, and you can be in an upcoming Showcase.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.000
Until next time, get those webcams rolling, and we'll see YOU IN the next episode.
