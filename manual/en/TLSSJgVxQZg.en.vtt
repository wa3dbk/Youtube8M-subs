00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:03.199
The problem with baby food is two things.

00:00:03.199 --> 00:00:07.430
One, we don't know what's inside the baby
food, if it's organic, if it's vine ripened.

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:12.160
And the other problem is that the packaging
the baby food comes in, it could be plastics

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.440
or metals that have toxins in it that leach
into our food.

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:18.939
And obviously it's getting into our babies,
a pretty silly idea.

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:22.350
So what we're going to do is make baby food
at home the old-fashioned way.

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.820
Now you can steam your veggies, steam your
fruit, and then mush it up.

00:00:25.820 --> 00:00:27.380
That's a very easy way of doing it.

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:29.140
The other easy way is doing it in a blender.

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:31.390
So what we're going to do is we're going to
make a combination.

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:32.410
So it takes four ingredients.

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:36.880
We're going to have half a pear, half an apple,
half a banana, and half a carrot.

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:38.150
So we're going to start off with the apple.

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:44.080
Literally, we are going to leave the seeds
in and the stems, if you want as well.

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:45.870
Cut that up a little bit.

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.210
Particularly with apples, it's great fiber,
and it's going to be really good for the digestive

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:50.210
system.

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:51.210
Half an apple.

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:52.360
We're going to put some pear in.

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:57.170
Pear particularly is a very cooling fruit,
so it's also helps the digestive system.

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:58.720
And the seeds can go in and the stem.

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:00.190
That's all fine, too.

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:06.040
Carrots, they've actually been known by herbalists
for centuries to be an antiseptic.

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:10.890
So great for gums and teeth and also for the
digestive system as well.

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.880
So half a carrot and then some bananas.

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.830
So the banana is like a bit of a thickening
agent and also the sweetener.

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.420
So it's going taste nice and also bring it
together.

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:19.420
Yum!

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:21.360
Get your lid.

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.030
Put it on top.

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:27.260
Now on the Vitamix you got variable speeds.

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.350
You can control how fast the machine is.

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:32.160
We're going to choose number seven.

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:46.270
Leave it on for about 30 seconds.

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:47.270
Very smooth.

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:55.610
All the seeds and pulp totally liquefied with
a natural coloring from carrot and banana,

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:57.460
pear and apple.

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:05.420
Now the last time I made baby food was on
the weekend, and before that I hadn't eaten

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:11.360
baby food for, I don't know how long maybe
10, 15 years or something and making baby

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.560
food myself, it reminded me how tasty it is.

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.740
Yeah, you can really taste the banana.

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:18.510
Everything's in there.

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:24.530
The seeds, all the fiber, all the nutrition
and very simple, very cheap as well and delicious.

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.610
So hopefully, your baby likes it.

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:29.030
Beautiful ice cream.

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.430
Let's put it over my head.

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:34.700
I did it once.

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:36.959
It ended really badly.

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:38.090
Okay so...
