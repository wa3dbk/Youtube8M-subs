00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.870
Hi guys! Today, I thought I would do something
different. It's a First Impressions video.

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:11.120
I've never done it before, but I saw Cloudy
Apples make a similar video a few days ago,

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:16.180
where she shared her first impressions on
a honey mask. I thought it would be fun to

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:20.500
do the same thing. But not with the honey
mask. I already love the honey mask. I'm going

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:30.340
to try a kefir mask for my hair. Please disregard
my makeupless face and my dirty hair. That's

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:36.210
because it's a part of the experiment, right?
So here I've got my homemade fresh kefir,

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:41.230
which I put in a pot of warm water to warm
it up a little because I've heard that it's

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:47.019
going to work better if it's warm. I'm going
to leave it on my hair for one hour. I read

00:00:47.019 --> 00:00:52.539
that it should be between 1 hour and 2 hours,
so I thought 1 hour would be perfect. And

00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:57.710
then I'm going to wash it off using my beloved
no-poo method using baking soda and apple

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:04.629
cider vinegar. Right now, I'm on a very strong
natural DIY kick. I don't even know why. So

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:08.799
I'm going to do everything DIY today. Now
I'm going to go to the bathroom and wash my

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:14.490
hair. I'll come back and tell you everything
that's on my head after trying this out for

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.700
the first time. I hope it's not going to smell
bad because I've heard that it can smell quite

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:27.479
bad. But apparently it makes your hair super
super shiny and strong. There are a few benefits

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.091
to it actually, which I didn't explain to
you before, but I'm going to do it now. So

00:01:31.091 --> 00:01:37.689
kefir, just like any other milk product, has
natural AHA, which is lactic acid, and it

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:43.250
helps take off all the dead cells from your
scalp. And then kefir is full of beneficial

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:51.610
bacteria, which also helps cleanse and balance
the pH of your scalp. Finally, kefir is also

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:58.280
full of protein or amino acids, and that helps
rebuild your hair and make it shine. So let's

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:04.969
see if it lives up to the claim, and I'll
see you later. So I've got the mask on now,

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:11.180
and I made a little mistake because I warmed
the kefir too much, and it became really liquid.

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:17.099
Now it's leaking all over my face and all
over my t-shirt. But it's OK. It's still going

00:02:17.099 --> 00:02:23.280
to work. I've got a couple of tablespoons
of kefir left and I'm going to use that as

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:28.549
a face mask. Totally unplanned, but I thought
why not try that as well. And that is leaking

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:39.650
all over my legs as well. So let's try it!
I read that kefir is really cooling, which

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:46.250
is brilliant for hot summer weather, which
is what we're having now. So I'm excited to

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:57.830
try it. So the mask is on, and it feels so
cooling. It's unbelievable. It's very liquid

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:05.299
because my kefir is really fresh. It's not
matured, so it's very runny. I think I'll

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:09.909
have to go and lie down for an hour, read
a book or something like that. Just to be

00:03:09.909 --> 00:03:13.120
horizontal, because otherwise it's leaking
too much. Or maybe it's going to dry really

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:24.099
soon, I don't know, we'll see. I'll be back
soon. So I'm 

00:03:24.099 --> 00:03:31.579
back and my hair is dry. It's time to tell
you what I thought of this whole kefir experience.

00:03:31.579 --> 00:03:37.049
I think I really liked it. I think my hair
i feeling much softer. It didn't actually

00:03:37.049 --> 00:03:42.959
smell bad at all, and I kept it on for 90
minutes instead of 60. I spent the whole time

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:47.500
reading a magazine, which was quite fun. And
it wasn't that runny after around 30 minutes,

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:54.519
so it wasn't too bad. I find that my scalp
is really really comfortable. The main thing

00:03:54.519 --> 00:04:00.010
was the cooling effect. I've read that kefir
is really good for summer months because it's

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:05.140
really cooling, and it's definitely true.
So I've noticed in my hair after my kefir

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:10.780
mask is that it's definitely much more shiny,
it's much easier to style, even though I 'haven't

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:16.120
really done anything yet, I haven't even separated
my curls yet. And my scalp feels better. So

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:30.170
these are the most prominent benefits for
me. And now... So I hope that it looks good.

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:36.440
Yeah, I really like it. I think my curls look
really shiny and defined. If you haven't tried

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:44.890
kefir mask yet, just give it a try. It's wonderful!
You can also use yogurt or soured milk, so

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:48.950
it' definitely a great thing. Oh, by the way,
I forgot to mention how my skin liked it.

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:53.940
So my skin definitely felt really cool as
well, and it feels really smooth now. But

00:04:53.940 --> 00:04:59.690
it's not a massive difference, I guess my
skin was quite smooth already before the mask.

00:04:59.690 --> 00:05:05.200
So I didn't see a huge difference there. But
I didn't apply any oil to moisturize today,

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:10.941
just for the sake of the experiment, and my
skin still felt comfortable. So I guess that

00:05:10.941 --> 00:05:17.920
kefir mask is quite moisturizing as well.
So the bottom line is that I definitely recommend

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:24.110
kefir for both face and hair. If you haven't
tried it yet, give it a try. And if you do,

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:27.930
let me know how you like it. I think that's
it. Please subscribe to my channel if you

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:30.400
like my videos, and I'll see you in my next
one. Bye!
