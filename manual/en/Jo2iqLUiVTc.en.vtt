00:00:04.709 --> 00:00:08.690
When you're thinking of buying an oven
there are several things to consider.

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:10.210
Firstly the door.

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:13.260
Ideally it should be light
and easy to use with one hand.

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:16.539
As well as staying in position without
slamming shut or falling open.

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:21.540
It's also pretty important that the
window is large enough to provide a clear view of what you're cooking.

00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:23.440
Without having to open the oven.

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:28.039
Whether you prefer digital or manual controls, it comes down to personal taste.

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:31.739
But either way you should make sure that
the symbols for each function

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:34.499
Are easy to understand and are clearly
labeled.

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:37.620
A lot of modern ovens have too many cooking modes.

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.500
Which can be confusing.

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:42.440
So here's a quick run down of some of the more useful settings.

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:47.800
Fan force uses a cooking element behind a fan to blow hot air directly into the cooking space.

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:50.200
And is ideal for multi shelf cooking.

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:52.560
Reheating, roasting and meringues.

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:54.800
Fan assisted is different from fan force

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:59.420
In that is uses a fan to circulate the heat
produced by the top and the bottom elements.

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:04.220
And is best used for foods with short cooking times like scones,  biscuits and pastries.

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:09.290
Grilling uses a top element only which is
useful for cooking small cuts of meat

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:13.180
Like chops, steaks and fish not to mention cheese on toast.

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:17.850
And finally if you like homemade pizza at
the bottom element plus fans setting

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:23.230
Will make sure that your pizza base stays
crispy without drying out or burning your favourite toppings.

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:28.200
Looking inside the oven you need to
consider the following

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:32.290
Is the interior light bright enough and
can you replace it easy when the time comes?

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:36.599
Do the shelves have safety stops to
prevent them being pulled out accidentally?

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.720
And are they strong enough to support a
heavy dish without sloping downwards under the weight?

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.180
The grill tray should slide easily

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:48.229
And come out far enough for you to adjust food at the back.

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:52.130
But with the safety stop to avoid you pulling it all the way out by accident.

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:57.810
Also look for smokeless grill trays, these have channels that drain the fat into the tray beneath.

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:01.900
Reducing the amount of fat spat out and smoke caused by burning grease.

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:05.660
Sadly, there's no such thing as a truly
self-cleaning oven.

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.140
But pyrolytic ovens have a cleaning cycle that burns food residue into ash

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:11.699
That can be wiped off easily.

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:14.790
If you can't afford the higher price of
these models

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.610
Look for an oven with the catalytic
lining as this will absorb fat splatters.

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:23.120
Just make sure that the liners cover most of the oven's interior.

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:26.140
Keeping the exterior clean can also be a chore.

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:30.349
So look for a design that's clear of cracks
and crevices which can attract dirt.

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:34.659
Stainless steel looks great, but requires
special attention during cleaning

00:02:34.659 --> 00:02:37.019
So try and get a fingerprint resistant
surface.

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:41.160
Glass panels should be well sealed and
preferrably removable.

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.640
While molded shelf supports are less fiddly to clean.

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:46.520
Thanks Fiona, so to wrap up

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:50.290
Make sure that the door is
easy to use and provides a good view of what's cooking.

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:55.660
Check the controls are clearly
labeled and that any symbols are easy to understand.

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:58.320
Don't get bogged down by too many cooking modes.

00:02:58.660 --> 00:02:59.740
Just stick to the basics.

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:05.240
Look for safety stops on shelves and grill pans and check they don't sag too much under load.

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.879
And finally,

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:11.419
Make sure the oven you choose is easy to
clean both inside and out.
