00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:03.610
As part of welcoming the University of
the Pacific to the West Coast Conference

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:07.589
we thought we'd let you see some of the
school's athletic facilities and learn

00:00:07.589 --> 00:00:11.429
about their pasts, presents and futures and to do that we thought we'd let the

00:00:11.429 --> 00:00:14.049
people who know them best show them off

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:20.829
their coaches

00:00:20.829 --> 00:00:26.259
My name is Lynne Roberts. I'm the head women's basketball coach and I've been at Pacific for seven seasons.

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:29.079
We are in the Alex G. Spanos Center.

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:34.109
Stockton love its Tigers so there's a good home court fan base here

00:00:34.109 --> 00:00:35.520
which is great.

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.380
Pacific has a great tradition of athletics.

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:42.590
We used to have football and there's a lot of great big names that came through here in football.

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:44.280
Men's basketball has historically been tremendous.

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.360
so there's a lot of big names retired
jerseys

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:49.930
lot of banners in this building. There's been a lot of

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:51.690
great teams in Pacific athletics.

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:53.920
And this building I think shows them off.

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.490
I'm Brian Kolze. I'm the head softball coach here at the University of

00:00:56.490 --> 00:00:57.780
the Pacific.

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:00.890
And I am now entering my 22nd
season here

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:02.710
at the university

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:05.810
We've gone to the NCAA's 8 times in the last

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:09.960
14 years and our one conference
championship in our previous conference

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.520
was in 2011

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.670
Our home facility is Bill Simoni Field. We're finishing up leading into

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:20.970
this Fall new dugouts with the new
backstop. Favorite thing about Simoni

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.690
Field is

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:26.410
the ambiance and that it matches the
rest of the university everything is

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:30.430
brick out here which is the motif of
Pacific

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:32.960
My name is Ron Verlin. I'm the head basketball coach at the University of the

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:34.100
Pacific.

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.070
This is my first season

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:40.490
We're in the Pacific athletic weight room. It was originally built by the 49ers

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:42.510
When the 49ers trained at Pacific

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:45.790
and now we got a big beautiful weight room. We've got two strength and conditioning coaches.

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:49.060
so it's a great place for us to get big and strong.

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:51.900
The Tigers have 7 seniors, 11 returning lettermen.

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:54.660
So very experienced team

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:58.420
Coach Thomason led the Tigers for 25 years and now that I take over it's been a

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.470
winning program it's been a program that
will bring toughness energy and and and

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:05.740
hard nosed style of play to the WCC

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:09.280
thanks for uh... coming and stopping at Pacific today, seeing our weight room and all of

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.820
our beautiful facilities. We hope you
come out and see the Tigers play in Stockton
