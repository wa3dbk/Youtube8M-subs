(rock music)

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:04.001
- Is it rolling now?

00:00:04.001 --> 00:00:05.764
- Yeah, it's rolling now.

00:00:05.764 --> 00:00:07.278
I gotta tell them what we doing
we can take it from the top.

00:00:07.278 --> 00:00:09.042
- And, scene, but we need a knife.

00:00:09.042 --> 00:00:10.599
- Yeah wait, I can get all that, okay.

00:00:10.599 --> 00:00:12.157
What are we making?

00:00:12.157 --> 00:00:13.695
- We're making a Banana Frosters.

00:00:13.695 --> 00:00:15.353
- She's studying directing, okay?

00:00:15.353 --> 00:00:18.525
So, she's going to direct
this episode, okay?

00:00:18.525 --> 00:00:20.469
So whenever she says "cut,"
I'm going to just stop, okay?

00:00:20.469 --> 00:00:21.632
Okay, what we doing?

00:00:21.632 --> 00:00:22.561
- Cut!

00:00:22.561 --> 00:00:24.276
(laughing together)

00:00:24.276 --> 00:00:26.163
But literally, cut the
banana, give me a knife.

00:00:26.163 --> 00:00:27.058
You gotta, you gotta,

00:00:27.058 --> 00:00:28.082
you gotta put this right!
- Yeah!

00:00:28.082 --> 00:00:28.749
You want me to cut the
banana or you want me

00:00:28.749 --> 00:00:29.793
to cut the scene?

00:00:29.793 --> 00:00:30.991
- Cut the scene!

00:00:30.991 --> 00:00:32.665
And then we'll cut the banana.

00:00:32.665 --> 00:00:34.240
(laughing together)

00:00:34.240 --> 00:00:36.047
- [Skyy] Director.
- And scene.

00:00:36.047 --> 00:00:37.179
- [Skyy] You like the framing of this?

00:00:37.179 --> 00:00:38.685
Go ahead, go ahead, you
look evil right there.

00:00:38.685 --> 00:00:39.665
- I do?

00:00:39.665 --> 00:00:40.636
- [Skyy] Oh my god.

00:00:40.636 --> 00:00:42.181
(Sophia growls)
I love it, I love it.

00:00:42.181 --> 00:00:44.115
- [Sophia] Just cut it in half, voila!

00:00:44.115 --> 00:00:45.651
That's it, and ...

00:00:45.651 --> 00:00:46.459
cut!

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:47.401
(laughing together)

00:00:47.401 --> 00:00:49.573
- [Skyy] Don't you need
to peel the damn banana?

00:00:49.573 --> 00:00:51.956
- Yeah, you didn't say that. (laughs)

00:00:51.956 --> 00:00:54.380
- [Skyy] Who's the goddamn
director here, me or you?

00:00:55.117 --> 00:00:56.239
- I can handle a banana.

00:00:56.239 --> 00:00:57.254
- [Skyy] Really?

00:00:57.254 --> 00:00:58.444
- Mmhmm.

00:00:58.444 --> 00:00:59.586
Skyy, shut your--

00:00:59.586 --> 00:01:00.634
- [Skyy] Where'd you learn that?

00:01:00.634 --> 00:01:02.787
- dirty, filthy mouth.

00:01:02.787 --> 00:01:04.116
- [Skyy] I didn't mean it in a sexual way.

00:01:04.116 --> 00:01:05.716
- Good.

00:01:05.716 --> 00:01:07.527
I did.
- [Skyy] Okay.

00:01:07.527 --> 00:01:09.014
(laughing together)

00:01:09.014 --> 00:01:10.497
- Are we filming?
- [Skyy] Yes.

00:01:10.497 --> 00:01:11.678
- Is a camera rolling?

00:01:11.678 --> 00:01:12.916
- [Skyy] Yes camera's rolling.
- Great.

00:01:12.916 --> 00:01:14.045
- [Skyy] Banana.

00:01:14.045 --> 00:01:15.822
- Banana and spiced rum.

00:01:15.822 --> 00:01:17.558
Ounce and a half.

00:01:19.432 --> 00:01:21.479
- [Skyy] Now what kind of
pourer spout you give us, Mel?

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:23.074
(Sophia laughs)

00:01:23.074 --> 00:01:23.883
The thing got chalmydia.
- Oh, Mel.

00:01:23.883 --> 00:01:24.916
- [Skyy] He can't pee.

00:01:24.916 --> 00:01:25.711
- [Mel] Why is it my fault?

00:01:25.711 --> 00:01:26.813
- I tell you.

00:01:26.813 --> 00:01:28.389
- [Skyy] You should
check equipment before--

00:01:28.389 --> 00:01:29.235
- [Sophia] This PA right there.

00:01:29.235 --> 00:01:30.364
- Why would you want me--

00:01:30.364 --> 00:01:31.096
- [Skyy] Huh?

00:01:31.096 --> 00:01:31.927
- [Sophia] Thanks a lot!

00:01:31.927 --> 00:01:34.203
- You want me to seriously
pour out liquor--

00:01:34.203 --> 00:01:35.311
- [Skyy] You could pour water.

00:01:35.311 --> 00:01:37.357
- from the bottle every time to test it?

00:01:37.357 --> 00:01:39.067
- [Skyy] Man, you so
close to getting fired.

00:01:39.067 --> 00:01:41.017
- I mean, how am I supposed
to work professionally

00:01:41.017 --> 00:01:42.165
in an environment like this?

00:01:42.165 --> 00:01:43.667
- [Skyy] Okay, take the plug out

00:01:43.667 --> 00:01:45.101
and pour it just naturally, man.

00:01:45.931 --> 00:01:47.924
- Jesus, seriously?

00:01:47.924 --> 00:01:48.791
- [Skyy] I'm just surrounded by--

00:01:48.791 --> 00:01:50.000
- Way to go.

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:51.693
Excuse me.

00:01:51.693 --> 00:01:53.227
- [Skyy] Can you get it off?

00:01:53.227 --> 00:01:54.147
- I got it, I got it!

00:01:54.147 --> 00:01:55.495
Hey, let's not freak out.

00:01:56.171 --> 00:01:57.464
Okay, here we go.

00:01:58.232 --> 00:01:59.473
- [Skyy] It's probably way
more than an ounce and a half.

00:01:59.473 --> 00:02:00.656
But we'll go with that, all right?

00:02:00.656 --> 00:02:01.728
(Sophia and Mel laugh)

00:02:01.728 --> 00:02:02.994
Next?

00:02:02.994 --> 00:02:05.570
- Next we have creme de bananas.

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:06.805
- [Skyy] Okay.

00:02:06.805 --> 00:02:08.401
- Right, just a little splash?

00:02:08.401 --> 00:02:10.912
- [Skyy] No, it's one and
a half of that, wow, okay.

00:02:12.634 --> 00:02:13.899
- Whipping cream.

00:02:13.899 --> 00:02:15.061
- [Skyy] Okay.

00:02:15.061 --> 00:02:16.512
- And, action.

00:02:19.542 --> 00:02:20.991
(Skyy laughs)

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.491
Now we're going to stick in some ice.

00:02:27.057 --> 00:02:30.394
Maybe, there yeah?
- [Skyy] Yeah.

00:02:30.394 --> 00:02:31.319
- Good.
- [Skyy] Ja!

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:32.073
- Ja?

00:02:32.073 --> 00:02:32.885
- [Skyy] Yeah, I said yeah.

00:02:32.885 --> 00:02:33.769
- Yeah?

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:34.787
- [Skyy] Do y'all say that?
- Yeah? Yeah.

00:02:34.787 --> 00:02:35.953
- [Skyy] Do y'all say "ja"?
- Yeah.

00:02:35.953 --> 00:02:36.986
- [Skyy] In German?
- Yeah.

00:02:36.986 --> 00:02:37.817
- [Skyy] Damn.
- Yeah.

00:02:37.817 --> 00:02:38.729
- [Skyy] Can I ask you a question?

00:02:38.729 --> 00:02:39.906
- Yeah.
- [Skyy] It's kind of sexual.

00:02:39.906 --> 00:02:42.079
- Yeah, uh, we'll see about that.

00:02:42.079 --> 00:02:43.596
- [Skyy] In German porn do the girls

00:02:43.596 --> 00:02:45.308
are like, "Ja, ja, ja!"?

00:02:45.308 --> 00:02:46.848
(laughing together)

00:02:47.684 --> 00:02:49.072
- (German accent) Well, how
about you just watch one

00:02:49.072 --> 00:02:50.104
and just find out for yourself.

00:02:50.104 --> 00:02:51.130
- [Skyy] I've tried to
find one, but I've been

00:02:51.130 --> 00:02:52.067
Googling and I can't find one.

00:02:52.067 --> 00:02:53.254
- Oh trust me, they're all over the place.

00:02:53.254 --> 00:02:54.726
- [Skyy] Bring me some from
your collection. (laughs)

00:02:54.726 --> 00:02:55.728
- Okay will do, no problem.

00:02:55.728 --> 00:02:56.678
- [Skyy] Your home videos.

00:02:56.678 --> 00:02:57.884
(Sophia laughs mockingly)

00:02:58.837 --> 00:03:01.237
- Back to the drink, here we go.

00:03:01.237 --> 00:03:04.176
And grind, let's grind it.

00:03:06.034 --> 00:03:07.968
Caramel flavored syrup is going to go

00:03:07.968 --> 00:03:10.655
on the inside of our glass.

00:03:10.655 --> 00:03:12.755
- [Skyy] Okay, gonna watch you, go ahead.

00:03:12.755 --> 00:03:14.014
- 'Kay?

00:03:22.403 --> 00:03:23.891
- [Skyy] Know what, I
watched you at Bushwhacked

00:03:23.891 --> 00:03:25.252
and I watched you at the All Pro.

00:03:25.252 --> 00:03:27.057
Your design's really interesting.

00:03:27.057 --> 00:03:28.857
I think you have talent in design.

00:03:28.857 --> 00:03:29.975
- [Sophia] Thank you.

00:03:29.975 --> 00:03:31.978
- [Skyy] Well I take that back
after looking at this, okay?

00:03:31.978 --> 00:03:33.623
That look like a bird took a dump

00:03:33.623 --> 00:03:35.161
and it drained down the side of a wall.

00:03:35.161 --> 00:03:36.588
That's what that looks like, okay?

00:03:36.588 --> 00:03:38.236
(Sophia laughs)
So I take back

00:03:38.236 --> 00:03:40.864
whatever I said about your design skills.

00:03:40.864 --> 00:03:43.452
Because apparently they were jack shit.

00:03:45.248 --> 00:03:46.236
Eww.

00:03:46.236 --> 00:03:48.032
- [Skyy] Ice chunks.

00:03:48.032 --> 00:03:49.655
- [Sophia] Well, you--

00:03:49.655 --> 00:03:50.667
(Sophia laughs)
[Skyy] Go ahead

00:03:50.667 --> 00:03:52.416
blame it on me.
- [Sophia] are to blame.

00:03:52.416 --> 00:03:55.491
Garnish with a little half banana.

00:03:56.644 --> 00:03:57.768
- [Skyy] Oh, you gonna
put the whole banana on?

00:03:57.768 --> 00:03:58.904
- [Sophia] Yeah.

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:02.121
It's gonna be like this.

00:04:04.382 --> 00:04:06.322
Bing, and what about
a little ground nutmeg

00:04:06.322 --> 00:04:08.078
that we have here.
- [Skyy] Yes, ma'am, go ahead.

00:04:10.648 --> 00:04:12.172
- What?
- Your usual spiel.

00:04:12.172 --> 00:04:13.568
I'm just telling you to say it.

00:04:13.568 --> 00:04:14.900
- Oh, so you want me to
say that you have it.

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:15.548
- Yes.

00:04:15.548 --> 00:04:16.504
- How do you want me to say it?

00:04:16.504 --> 00:04:18.728
- Like really dramatic, like
more dramatic than you usually

00:04:18.728 --> 00:04:22.425
say it, like you're really
excited about this drink.

00:04:22.425 --> 00:04:24.172
Like you can't believe it's
in front of you right now.

00:04:24.172 --> 00:04:25.493
And you just want to
share it with everyone.

00:04:25.493 --> 00:04:26.673
- Okay.
- Yeah.

00:04:26.673 --> 00:04:27.943
- So I need to get into character then?

00:04:27.943 --> 00:04:31.051
- Yes, let me just, and take one!

00:04:34.526 --> 00:04:35.681
(Skyy sighs dramatically)

00:04:40.479 --> 00:04:41.812
- And there you have it!

00:04:41.812 --> 00:04:43.579
- Yeah, I like that, okay!

00:04:43.579 --> 00:04:46.636
We can roll with that, I
like that a lot, great work.

00:04:46.636 --> 00:04:48.074
Great work.
- Thank you, thank you.

00:04:48.074 --> 00:04:49.216
Good job.
- Academy Award?

00:04:49.216 --> 00:04:50.004
- I just don't wanna

00:04:50.004 --> 00:04:50.881
(Skyy laughs)
waste any more time.

00:04:50.881 --> 00:04:53.533
So let me just go ahead and taste it now.

00:04:53.533 --> 00:04:55.281
We'll roll with it, okay.

00:04:56.111 --> 00:04:58.022
I'm just gonna go ahead and taste now.

00:05:00.991 --> 00:05:03.790
- Mmm, but seriously, you did all right.

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:05.964
Ooh, mmm, yum, this is really good.

00:05:05.964 --> 00:05:06.958
- So, do you like it?

00:05:06.958 --> 00:05:10.385
- And strong cause I poured
so much rum in it, but ...

00:05:10.385 --> 00:05:11.751
- And punk ass Melanie over there

00:05:11.751 --> 00:05:13.776
on the couch drinking one right now, okay?

00:05:14.821 --> 00:05:16.892
- Yeah, though I know, I can see why!

00:05:16.892 --> 00:05:18.253
- [Skyy] Yeah, cause she steals my alcohol

00:05:18.253 --> 00:05:19.818
all the time man, look at her!

00:05:19.818 --> 00:05:21.116
- I do not!

00:05:21.116 --> 00:05:22.509
- [Skyy] What is that in your hand?

00:05:22.509 --> 00:05:23.737
(Sophia laughs)

00:05:23.737 --> 00:05:24.907
- [Skyy] What is that in your hand?

00:05:24.907 --> 00:05:26.361
- I brought my own bananas.

00:05:26.361 --> 00:05:27.760
- [Skyy] I didn't ask that.

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:29.290
Is that a Banana Frosters in your hand?

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:30.183
- Yes.

00:05:30.183 --> 00:05:31.584
- [Skyy] Is that the first
one you're having for the day?

00:05:31.584 --> 00:05:32.576
- No. (laughs)

00:05:32.576 --> 00:05:34.207
- [Skyy] How many have you had today?

00:05:34.207 --> 00:05:36.141
- (laughs) A few.

00:05:36.141 --> 00:05:37.654
- [Skyy] How many have you had today?

00:05:37.654 --> 00:05:40.235
- (laughs) Um, two.

00:05:40.235 --> 00:05:41.563
- Cheers!

00:05:41.563 --> 00:05:43.008
- I'm telling you, I'm
not trying to be sexual,

00:05:43.008 --> 00:05:44.355
I'm just saying, they got like a little--

00:05:44.355 --> 00:05:46.912
- Anyways, cut, cut, cut, done, all right!

00:05:47.881 --> 00:05:49.009
That's a wrap!

00:05:49.009 --> 00:05:50.211
