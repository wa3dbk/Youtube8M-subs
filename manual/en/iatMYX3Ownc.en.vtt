With 
the increasing competition in today's digital

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.999
printing market, choosing the right ink to
add value to your business is critical to

00:00:14.999 --> 00:00:24.130
both the quality of your work and your profits.

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:27.150
Ink consumables are a large expense for printing
companies.

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:36.420
Nazdar can save you at least 30% compared
to OEM, wide-format ink cartridges.

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:40.850
And 20-50% on inks for your UV-curing printer.

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:45.200

has become Nazdar's calling card.
