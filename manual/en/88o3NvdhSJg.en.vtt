00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:10.200
So we've got all these brackets where the seats used to be bolted down

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:15.620
The guy who had this bus before us just snapped the seats off even with the ground but left the

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:19.080
brackets here and they are a pain to get off

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.820
So we're just going to grind them

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:27.260
So grinding the bolts has not been a quick process

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:35.360
We're not going very quickly

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:48.400
I'm putting together a bed frame

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:54.380
There's going to be storage underneath and a queen sized bed up top

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.640
So today we're removing some windows we don't need anymore

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:26.900
So basically there were these little brackets that were screwed on holding the windows in

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:35.940
I had to remove them, then we just take the knife and go along and cut the caulking around the edges

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.040
Then we'll pry it out of here

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:50.240
Then there's a window

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:58.100
Those two windows needed to come out because we're going to put the shower basically right here

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:02.580
but the windows on either side of them did not need to come out

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:07.900
and each of the brackets on these posts here spans two windows

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:11.940
so we can't just remove the brackets that were holding the windows in in the hole

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.760
because we need them to continue to hold the window on the other side in

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:22.060
so we need to cut the little tabs off that stick out into the empty hole now

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:28.360
Then when we're all done we end up with something like that

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:34.500
Another thing we've been working on we took the flashers out of their holes on the front of the bus

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:38.860
and next we're going to take the flashers out on the back as well

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:46.260
We've also removed the flappy stop arm, that swings out on the side of the bus obviously we can't legally use that anymore

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:48.520
so it doesn't need to be there

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:50.700
we're having some steel cut by Alaska steel

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:54.680
It'll be able to patch over those holes that I've got covered with tape there

00:02:54.680 --> 00:03:00.040
as well as the holes from the flashers and some panels to go over the windows

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.660
that we're removing on both sides of the bus

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:05.800
The biggest thing we've accomplished so far in the bus is building the bed platform

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:10.500
This isn't how the finished bed will look but in the mean time it will give us a place to sleep

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.480
The biggest thing we had to consider when building the bed platform

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:23.260
Was that the bed would block the biggest entrance we have for getting furniture and building materials through

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:27.460
So to solve that problem we made the middle of the bed removable

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:37.040
The end sections are connected with four bolts each, topped with wing nuts

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:57.980
so that will give us a pathway for large objects to get through the bus during construction

00:03:57.980 --> 00:04:01.500
the next time we update you the bus should look significantly different

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:03.140
see you next time
