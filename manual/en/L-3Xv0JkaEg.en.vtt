00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.500
What's up guys, Dax here from the Halo Network
and today we have our first map in the

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:04.799
weekly map announcement series.

00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:07.850
Now like I said in the previous video, each map will be announced the Sunday prior to the

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:09.179
Friday that particular round starts.

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:13.880
And it just so happens that today is Sunday
so lets get to it. So the map being used for the first round

00:00:13.880 --> 00:00:15.950
of this tournament is Sovereign and is made by
paints.

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:19.270
So quick history lesson. Paints first
made this map back in reach

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:23.460
And he submitted it to ForgeHub's 1v1 Smackdown tournament and it was one of only three

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.160
community maps selected to be used in that
tournament. So Paints just decided to remake

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:28.359
it in Halo 4 because you know

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:31.740
is obviously proven to be a great map so
why not, right?

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.000
So anyway, I believe he finished this map
about a month ago and it was still a

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.020
really good map but it just didn't have the
same feel as it did back in reach

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:41.420
and so yesterday I was just taking
another look through the map,

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:43.230
and I ended up getting some really great feedback from two guys -

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.320
spincycle and secretschnitzel. Yeah they
offered some really great suggestions and I

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:49.289
was actually able to get paints in the lobby
with them

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:53.539
so all four of us were just able to, you know, work
on the map together.

00:00:53.539 --> 00:00:57.070
And I've got to give huge props to paints because after all 3 of us left

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:00.640
he kept working and I think he was making
changes all day yesterday just so we could

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:01.520
have this map

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:05.780
complete and ready to go for this
tournament. So again huge props to paints

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:06.240
and

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.479
thanks to spin cycle and secretschnitzel
for the feedback. So if you haven't noticed

00:01:10.479 --> 00:01:12.080
already, this map is just gorgeous.

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.720
I mean a really is just a beautiful map,
and you can tell that paints spent a whole

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:16.840
lot of time on the aesthetics

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:21.210
from big things like a whole rocky side of the
map to even the smallest aesthetic touches like

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:21.820
his little

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:26.549
air events which I don't think I show
but they're there. But aesthetics aside,

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:28.909
let's talk about power weapons and basic
strategies

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:32.020
and just other things you want to know
about the map before you play your match.

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.970
So there are three power weapons - a sniper
rifle, concussion rifle, and boltshot.

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:38.020
The sniper has a ninety second respawn timer with zero spare clips,

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:43.250
so that means four shots total. The concussion rifle has a 120 second respawn timer with zero spare clips,

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.500
and the boltshot has a 120 second timer with one spare clip.

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:49.579
Now the thing about these weapons that
makes them different than the others

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:53.759
Besides the fact that they're power weapons of course, is that these three weapons are drop spawned

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:57.540
Now let's see if I can explain drop spawning for those of you that don't know.

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.479
So a weapon's respawn timer starts after that weapon has been moved

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:02.320
from it's resting position

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:06.570
which in most cases is whenever somebody picks it up, and because of this

00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:09.450
it's difficult to tell when a
certain weapon will spawn again if you

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:11.550
don't know exactly when it's respawn timer started.

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:15.099
However in the case of a drop spawned
weapon, that weapon spawns in the air

00:02:15.099 --> 00:02:15.890
and falls to the ground

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:19.690
so that timer automatically starts as
soon as that weapons spawns

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:24.060
and because of that, drop spawning,
drop spawned weapons appear on the map in

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:24.790
certain intervals

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:27.810
which eliminates any randomness that
could occur with

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:31.560
with regular weapon spawns. So being able
to time your weapons is crucial if you really

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:32.650
want to outplay your opponent,

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:36.269
and using the game timer at the bottom
right of the screen definitely comes in handy.

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:36.629
 

00:02:36.629 --> 00:02:40.610
Now the only strange thing about this is
that the timers actually start

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:41.970
10 seconds before the match begins

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:45.760
so let's look at the sniper for example. Even though the game started at 15 minutes

00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:49.959
the weapon timer started at 15 minutes
and 10 seconds so that means with a 90

00:02:49.959 --> 00:02:50.790
second respawn timer

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.970
the weapon will respawn at 13
minutes and 40 seconds not 30

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:54.410
seconds.

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:58.290
So like I said being able to keep
track of your respawn times for all your

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.780
power weapons will definitely give you
an edge over your opponent.

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:04.530
Now another thing to keep in mind is grenades. They can definitely play a huge

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:05.459
factor in this map.

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:08.659
Especially with all the 45 degree angles,
they can be really effective just to lob some

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:09.900
grenades around the corner

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:14.580
just to easily flush out your opponent.
But yea guys, that's it for today.

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:17.470
Go ahead and get some practice in on the
map so you can be prepared for the first

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:19.599
round starting at the end of the week.

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:23.129
I'll link to both the map and the gamtype in the description below, but if you

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:24.180
want you can search for yourself.

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:27.190
Just search the gamertag itsDaxx in
the Halo 4 file sharing menu

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:30.760
and again the map is called Sovereign
and the gametype used for the tournament is 1v1

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:31.549
 

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:35.280
Unity v3. Also don't forget the sign ups are going on until Friday

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:38.590
so if you still haven't signed up yet or you know
someone who's interested be sure to go to

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:39.900
halocustoms.com and sign up.

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:42.840
Alright guys, I will see you guys next time. Bye bye.
