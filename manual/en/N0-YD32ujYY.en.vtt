Hey, this is Ed with AtticFoil.com.
In this short video I'm going to explain HOW

00:00:05.509 --> 00:00:10.160
an attic-installed radiant barrier works.
All of the heat from the sun is transferred

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:15.830
to Earth in the form of radiant heat. This
is heat transfer without actual contact with

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:21.429
the heat source. When your roof absorbs radiant
heat from the sun, it heats up. Eventually,

00:00:21.429 --> 00:00:26.249
your roof will start to re-radiate the heat
in all directions. About half of the heat,

00:00:26.249 --> 00:00:31.939
or energy, will transfer into the attic. Radiant
heat is the invisible part of the light spectrum;

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:37.110
it's the part you feel, not the part you see.
For example, if you stand near a fire on a

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.790
cold night, you feel the radiant heat on your
front side, but your backside may still be

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.780
cold since it's not receiving any radiant
heat. Radiant heat travels at the speed of

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:52.490
light until it's either absorbed or reflected.
Normally your attic insulation will absorb

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:57.030
all of this energy and it too will start to
heat up. Eventually this heat will make its

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.440
way through the attic insulation and into
the home. Traditional attic insulation will

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:06.420
only slow down the heat transfer process.
When you install a radiant barrier between

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.880
the roof and the attic insulation, by either
stapling it to the bottom of the roof rafters

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:16.610
or laying it out over the attic insulation,
it breaks this path by reflecting the radiant

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.710
heat back towards the roof, and helps keep
the attic insulation from getting as hot.

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:25.380
By keeping the attic insulation cooler, we
can significantly reduce the amount of heat

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.850
transfer entering the home by making the regular
attic insulation more effective. So think

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:36.450
of it this way: radiant barrier is your FIRST
line of defense against radiant heat, and

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:40.780
traditional attic insulation is your second
line of defense against conductive heat flow.

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:45.119
Since your home is exposed to both types of
heat, you need a different product for each

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:50.640
one. In fact, radiant heat is actually EASIER
to control than conductive heat since it can

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.619
be reflected by just about any shiny surface.
A lot of people talk about a COOLER ATTIC,

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:01.280
which is nice but really what we want is cooler
attic insulation. An attic installed radiant

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:06.100
barrier will keep your attic insulation cooler.
This means less heat will enter the home.

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:10.890
If less heat enters the home, then you spend
less money to get the heat out and your home

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:16.349
will be more comfortable. It's really that
simple. For more information, visit AtticFoil.com,
