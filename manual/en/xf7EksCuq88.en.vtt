00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.350
Hey everybody, it's Michael with .PN and I'm
tired.

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:10.630
I was going to wait until tomorrow to record
so I would appear fresher and not get so many

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:15.019
comments about how I look spacy in my videos,
but then I thought ... no.

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:18.640
No, this is the perfect allegory for today's
video.

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:19.980
I'm tired.

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.779
Humans get tired.

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:27.949
Know what else gets tired?

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:31.429
Smartphones.

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:37.410
This is the Galaxy S 3 and in my short time
testing it, I've found its endurance to be

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:38.650
on the high side of fair.

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:47.590
It's lasted longer on average than my Galaxy
Nexus, but doesn't quite live up to the performance

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:52.250
of the HTC one x I tested a few weeks back.

00:00:52.250 --> 00:01:05.600
Today we're gonna look at a few ways to get
the most out of this battery.

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:12.523
So, there are certain steps that we've all
gotten accustomed to taking to maximize endurance

00:01:12.523 --> 00:01:16.850
on our smartphones when we really need to
save every watt.

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:22.639
Sure, there are a lot of apps out there that
will do the job, but for this video we'll

00:01:22.639 --> 00:01:24.369
stick to stock.

00:01:24.369 --> 00:01:29.940
Some of these steps include measures like
shutting off as many radios as possible: that

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:36.329
includes things like WiFi and Bluetooth, NFC,
and GPS.

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:39.939
Some of these radios have more effect on the
battery than others, but they all impact it

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:40.939
somewhat.

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:47.240
Other things like making sure your email polling
intervals are set to medium or long, and that

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:57.429
you're not automatically syncing with Facebook
or Google + in the background.

00:01:57.429 --> 00:02:01.509
Another huge drain on your power reserves
is the display.

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:06.599
The SGS3 uses an AMOLED panel, so it doesn't
suck as much juice as an LCD with a backlight,

00:02:06.599 --> 00:02:11.780
but it's still bound to be the biggest energy
hog on the phone.

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:16.320
Turning down the brightness is a big way to
cut back on that consumption, and while we're

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:23.110
on the display, killing any live wallpapers
will save you some clock cycles, and therefore

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:24.950
power, as well.

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:28.150
Finally, there are the accessory features.

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:34.450
On the Galaxy S3, that includes things like
S-Voice, SmartStay, the LED, and more standard

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:36.440
elements like the vibration motor.

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:40.770
All of these can be tweaked manually, but
the Galaxy S3 makes life easier for us in

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:42.590
two main ways.

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:47.880
The first is the dashboard of toggles in the
Android notification bar up top.

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:51.980
These allow us to quickly and easily enable
and disable features that we only need at

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:57.720
certain times, like wf and bt and gps ... and
it also lets us do some triage if we really

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:03.620
get into a critical state, giving us a means
to kill notifications, mobile data, and sync

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:04.920
as well.

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:09.220
You'll notice it also lets us jump right into
something called "Power saving."

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:14.570
That's the second way the Galasy S 3 makes
life easier on those looking to conserve battery.

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:19.030
As on most Samsung phones, there's a handy
little readme file hidden away in the power

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:22.450
saving menu that tells you all about what
the mode does.

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:27.520
In brief, enabling power saving mode does
four main things: it reduces the maximum clock

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:33.170
speed of the CPU, which does slow down the
device a bit, but it saves power and won't

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:38.690
cripple you unless you try to play a graphically
intense game.

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:42.970
It also reduces the frame rate and lowers
the brightness on the display, switches your

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:47.190
email and browser backgrounds to black to
reduce the number of illuminated pixels on

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:52.540
the AMOLED display, and disables haptic feedback
to stop the vibrate motor from wasting amp

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:53.540
hours.

00:03:53.540 --> 00:03:54.540
It's not as fancy or as elaborate as the Smart
Actions on the Motorola Droid RAZR line, but

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:55.540
it's a pretty wide array of power-saving options.

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:58.280
To really get the most out of the device,
you'll also want to hop into settings, then

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:07.100
display, and make sure Auto Adjust Screen
Power is checked, and also that your brightness

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:10.150
is set to a low level.

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:15.650
Using Smart Stay is a good idea, to keep the
device paying attention to when you are and

00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:17.440
aren't looking at it.

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:21.430
If you're really trying to squeeze every second
out of the phone, you can adjust the backlight

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:28.100
on the capacitive keys to time out sooner,
as well.

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:34.940
Finally, and for now, this is specific to
the SGS3, you'll want to hop into S-Voice,

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:42.090
go to settings, and make sure that you've
either disabled the wake-up command, or selected

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:44.120
Only Listen While Charging.

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:48.250
Samsung goes out of its way to tell you that
S-Voice may drain battery, so this is a step

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:51.090
you don't want to miss.

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:56.450
And if all else fails, there's always Airplane
Mode.

00:04:56.450 --> 00:05:02.290
Turn it on, then turn it off periodically
to check for messages, then turn it back on.

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:08.880
It's the time-honored tradition of power-starved
smartphone owners everywhere.

00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:13.340

This has been Michael Fisher with Pocketnow;
I'm gonna go get some sleep.

00:05:32.310 --> 00:05:50.620
See ya next time.
