00:00:04.379 --> 00:00:08.359
 In today's video we will see, step by step, how the mechanism that is built walking 

00:00:08.359 --> 00:00:10.528
 a spider robot. 

00:00:10.528 --> 00:00:13.958
 Also it is known as hexapod, as it achieves the displacement 

00:00:13.958 --> 00:00:18.239
 six-legged movement. 

00:00:18.239 --> 00:00:21.579
 Let's see how it's done. 

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:31.839
 This is the mechanism that we will use to build the hexapod robot or spider robot. 

00:00:31.849 --> 00:00:35.490
 Horizontal - this - 

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:37.450
 It is part of the robot frame. 

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:42.740
 Legs - here we have the three - pin 1, this is the 2nd 

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:44.740
 and this is the leg 3. 

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:51.210
 Pin 1 is the point of connection to the frame, and that point mobile. Can not 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.000
 be fixed. The same goes for these two crossbars. This is the bar 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.740
 cross 1 

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:00.650
 and the cross bar 2. They are also mobile points. 

00:01:00.649 --> 00:01:02.280
 It has moving point here. 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.379
 Mobile point. 

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:07.189
 And mobile point connection that goes 

00:01:07.189 --> 00:01:10.459
 in the two crossbars, and is connected 

00:01:10.459 --> 00:01:11.689
 the leg number 2. 

00:01:11.689 --> 00:01:16.299
 A turn is connected to this wheel we see here. Here it is not hard to see, 

00:01:16.299 --> 00:01:20.170
 but the wheel axle is at this point that is where the motor is connected 

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:23.920
 reducer. You will turn either way, but the connection must 

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.710
 be eccentric. Not connected in the center. Usually done more or less 

00:01:28.709 --> 00:01:32.179
 one centimeter. The distance from here to there will be about a 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:36.049
 centimeter. Axis where we're going to make the connection. At the top carries a point 

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:38.960
 it is not fixed, this should allow mobility 

00:01:38.959 --> 00:01:41.709
 Like this. The only fixed 

00:01:41.709 --> 00:01:45.618
 It is this connection that goes to the frame. Of all the connections that we're doing, 

00:01:45.618 --> 00:01:49.368
 the only fixed is this. Rest all are moving. Another option, 

00:01:49.368 --> 00:01:54.069
 some hexapods will see that they do, in this leg and leaving a gap 

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:57.298
 connecting a screw to allow mobility. This can be 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:01:59.429
 another option. But we will assemble today 

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:01.080
 is this. Let's see how it's done. 

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:05.739
 To start building the robot spider, we must make the framework that will support the legs. 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:11.719
 To this I bought a piece of balsa 15 x 15 mm and a length of about one meter. 

00:02:11.719 --> 00:02:16.099
 It was cut into two pieces of 20 cm and two 12 cm. 

00:02:16.159 --> 00:02:18.259
 And one of nine centimeters shorter and a half. 

00:02:18.259 --> 00:02:22.179
 With the help of four gourmands, using glue or screws as they stay easier, 

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:24.180
 We began to assemble the structure. 

00:02:28.979 --> 00:02:31.039
 We joined the first two. 

00:02:37.439 --> 00:02:44.439
 And we place on the other side. 

00:02:49.759 --> 00:02:54.560
 When we have this armed structure, we must place the piece of wood to the inside. 

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.960
 This is going to serve as a support for reducing motor. 

00:03:01.479 --> 00:03:05.639
 This is the figure that will initially assemble, using these little sticks. 

00:03:05.639 --> 00:03:08.679
 What we will do is open holes in all joints. 

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:09.900
 In this union. 

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.219
 In these three. 

00:03:11.219 --> 00:03:12.020
 And these two. 

00:03:12.439 --> 00:03:15.639
 Additionally, hollow in the middle of these two sticks. 

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:25.640
 When we have openings in all joints, at the midpoint of these two sticks 

00:03:25.639 --> 00:03:28.239
 and at the top of this, let's start them together. 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:32.659
 To join them, which we catch is a normal clip, straighten it 

00:03:33.439 --> 00:03:35.879
 at one end and give you a big return. 

00:03:35.879 --> 00:03:37.979
 Then we take the smallest part. 

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:41.280
 So it is something. 

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:43.680
 Then we cut it more or less than one centimeter 

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:46.740
 And we made the union. We crossed by one 

00:03:48.460 --> 00:03:49.360
 and then the other. 

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.120
 Note that reaches to have mobility. 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:53.760
 At the other extreme we fold 

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:56.819
 and we began to close in circles. 

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:06.320
 In the end we left are two sticks connected at their ends, but leave us to generate movement. 

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:10.360
 If you have screw and nut, they can do it without pressing both. 

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:11.900
 Scope to generate mobility. 

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.939
 And we do the same for these three points. 

00:04:13.939 --> 00:04:16.939
 In some cases we do not want to slip the legs go, 

00:04:17.259 --> 00:04:19.680
 then we can get some sandpaper, 

00:04:21.379 --> 00:04:23.379
 We cut a small piece, 

00:04:24.699 --> 00:04:25.819
 and with some glue 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:28.620
 We are put it in the corners. 

00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:33.340
 Then the gear motor seek to add. 

00:04:33.339 --> 00:04:35.279
 In this case I'm going to put the tires. 

00:04:35.339 --> 00:04:37.679
 It is not ideal, the best would be a pulley. 

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:40.379
 And more to less than one centimeter radio, open a hole. 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:49.639
 That hole will serve us to withstand the leg, which initially will give movement to the rest. 

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:51.539
 Then another piece of Clip, 

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:54.819
 We go through the rim and net. 

00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:58.360
 Here we have the rim and sticks, forming a M. 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:02.420
 What we lack is put two sticks. 

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:04.420
 Here as I did at the top. 

00:05:04.899 --> 00:05:08.219
 Much shorter, forming this fixed will be based. 

00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:10.220
 All joints that generate mobility. 

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:12.480
 Remember that this union is not in the center of the rim. 

00:05:12.699 --> 00:05:14.399
 It is more or less than one centimeter. 

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:16.579
 The connection point. 

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:18.740
 The next thing we do and install the gear motor. 

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:24.339
 We must place it in this way and it is only showing the shaft. We assure you with 

00:05:24.339 --> 00:05:26.959
 a piece of tape. 

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:31.020
 What we press very strong. 

00:05:31.028 --> 00:05:35.668
 and we have set our engine. Now we can mount the legs. Connect the wheel to the axle 

00:05:35.668 --> 00:05:39.399
 and we will ensure the legs. As the balsa is a very soft wood 

00:05:39.399 --> 00:05:42.919
 and easy to drill, I'll use needles with a round head. 

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:50.620
 We discussed it at the other end. 

00:05:54.879 --> 00:06:00.519
 And finally let's connect this to the structure. This is the only point that should be fixed. 

00:06:00.519 --> 00:06:02.519
 This will not only put a point, 

00:06:03.279 --> 00:06:07.799
 but at least two or three points, so that it is completely fixed. 

00:06:10.579 --> 00:06:13.839
 There you get to see. In this case I put three points to completely stay 

00:06:13.848 --> 00:06:17.588
 fixed. Then I remember them. Mobile point to the structure 

00:06:17.588 --> 00:06:20.459
 union between these two poles no more 

00:06:20.459 --> 00:06:22.468
 point of attachment to the wheel. 

00:06:22.468 --> 00:06:26.110
 I used a tire but not the most appropriate. Mobile point here in Part 

00:06:26.110 --> 00:06:29.129
 above, another mobile point, 

00:06:29.129 --> 00:06:32.778
 which it is inside is the only fixed, fixed point should be (this is not 

00:06:32.778 --> 00:06:36.189
 You should move). Mobile 

00:06:36.189 --> 00:06:38.760
 and moving point connected to the base. 

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:43.939
 Now we only have nine volt plug. If we realize and generates movement 

00:06:43.939 --> 00:06:45.939
 that will give movement like a spider. 

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:51.360
 Lack assemble the legs on the other side and ready our spider robot. 

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:53.480
