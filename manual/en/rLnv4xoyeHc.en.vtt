Hey I'm Travis T-Bone Turner and this is Michael Waddell and Nick Mundt and we're from

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:44.859
the Bone Collectors and we're here in Tennessee, Nashville Tennessee.

00:00:44.859 --> 00:00:49.950
At the NWTF National Convention and its safe to say that all them hunters are actually

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.750
passionate about hunting.

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:55.070
But especially turkey hunters its a... its kind of a different

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:57.250
breed. And this right here is a

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:58.650
redneck celebration.

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:00.340
A redneck pep rally.

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:02.340
Celebrating the turkey.

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:05.450
And the great conservation that NWTF do. Great job for conservation. They do a

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:09.250
great job for hunting and the heritage.

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:14.500
And its great to see everybody out here. Really its more like a family reunion. Oh yeah it is.

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:15.560
This is my

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:21.010
twenty-first one I've been coming to up here so its a cold beer and talking about turkey hunting.

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:22.630
I mean and it's about every type of hunting but

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:26.239
turkey hunting obviously your gonna hear more turkey calls, your gonna hear anything at the

00:01:26.239 --> 00:01:26.860
National Wild Turkey Federation.convention.

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:30.170
And i think one of the biggest things about turkey hunting

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.730
why people are so fanatical about it is just being able

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:35.790
to speak to the turkey to get him to come to you and then he comes

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.760
and you can use decoys and use a lot of different tactics to get'em.

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:43.280
It's just something about chasing turkey
just getting it done and be right there with them

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.630
talking to you. And getting them to answer your calls is why people are

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:50.770
really fanatical. Yeah great interaction. And I believe you can persist and kill a turkey

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:55.220
If you  can consistently get a turkey in range their aint nothing in the world you cant hunt.Nothing in

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:58.270
the whole wide world. I mean a turkey is an aggravating thing

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:02.240
to sometimes get within range it takes every bit of your ability. You got to have wisdomship.

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.500
Of course you know you got to know a language with turkey. A lot of times you'll be able to

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.810
you know help manipulate call them in but a.

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:10.820
That's a lot of fun and i've always felt
that women. If anybody should like

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:15.070
that kind of hunting women should love turkey hunting because its only thing out there that women can talk

00:02:15.949 --> 00:02:20.659
dirty to the other sex and call them in and she can be right in the beat in there and its perfectly

00:02:20.659 --> 00:02:25.139
legal. That's right I think a great tip too is to get a decoy here. We've got a great decoy out of the

00:02:25.139 --> 00:02:27.579
market it's called the Thunder Chicken.

00:02:27.579 --> 00:02:31.949
Its a full stuffed decoy with a little bit smaller body you can sneak behind it.

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:34.719
It's kind of a threat to those gobblers, because
they just want to beat it up so thats really

00:02:34.719 --> 00:02:37.949
good too get yourself a good decoy. Yeah. Get after them that way.

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:41.869
Yeah, and another thing is we're really excited about RealTree's new pattern.

00:02:41.869 --> 00:02:43.379
The RealTree Extra and Extra Green.

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:46.869
Which green is gonna work phenomenal in when things start greening up so...

00:02:46.869 --> 00:02:50.579
uh... to have this big physique your gonna need some good camouflage. And the tip  that I would say is

00:02:50.579 --> 00:02:54.109
probably the most important specially from my case is

00:02:54.109 --> 00:03:00.419
to hire yourself a good guy and good turkey callersto do all the turkey hunting for ya.

00:03:00.419 --> 00:03:04.629
So so what T Bone is saying is that he's easy, he can easily use his RealTree  and blend in if we'll call him in

00:03:04.629 --> 00:03:08.799
he'll shoot it that's it. Your good at reading between the lines.

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:12.690
And I would say if anyone wants an extra tip I would say when you're turkey hunting be.

00:03:12.690 --> 00:03:14.479
Be aggressive.

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:15.490
there's a lot of different ways

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:16.360
of turkey hunting.

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:20.109
You know a lot of times its a fast
paced world we dont have a lot of time so

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:22.340
dont be afraid to be a little bit aggressive on turkeys.

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:23.609
And uh...

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:27.879
And realize that you got to use your wisdomship skills every bit as much as your

00:03:28.669 --> 00:03:31.799
Every bit as much as you call ability
because it's called turkey hunting

00:03:31.799 --> 00:03:34.020
not turkey calling so

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:37.680
turkey calling is just a little tool that will help you to get a turkey in range. But if you use the same

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.819
techniques that you use Elk hunting or Whitetail hunting or deer hunting, dont be afraid

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:45.209
you know slip crawl slip around.
Understand what the turkey wants to do and use

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:48.400
your knowledge of the woods to help get
close cos like I said all you're trying to do is get within

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.389
fifty yards of him Dave's shotgun.

00:03:50.389 --> 00:03:54.589
So obviously a call could help do that but there's lots of different ways of getting within range of a turkey so.

00:03:54.589 --> 00:03:56.059
Be aggressive and uh

00:03:56.059 --> 00:03:57.979
And just hunt them down.

00:03:57.979 --> 00:04:01.799
There you have it from Michael Ordell and Travis T Bone Turner. I'm Nick Mundt.
