Kristin: This is Week 7 of the Rockettes Summer
Intensive. It's the final week here. That

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:16.760
means that we spend a lot of time doing our
famous eye-high kicks. They've had the opportunity

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:21.860
to not only work on their technique and to
learn actual material that the Rockettes perform,

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:27.540
but we've spent hours and hours kicking, working
on being really precise and bringing our toe

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:31.689
to our eye. That means that your hamstrings
definitely get a wake-up call.

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:37.989
Stacy: The kickline is so fast. I mean, it's
really fast for us and they have done a really

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:42.160
fantastic job. We always tell them it's not
really about getting your leg up, you have

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:46.399
to stay connected and it's about getting your
leg down in time so the next leg kick can

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:50.789
get up. We focus a lot on using your hamstrings
to pull those legs down in time.

00:00:50.789 --> 00:00:57.309
Morgan: I learned a lot about the technique
behind not only kicking, but also all of their

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:01.899
dancing. There's so many little intricacies
and so many details that the average person

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:06.670
would never notice, but to the Rockettes it's
really important. That, I think, gives it

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:10.050
the uniform look that you see when you go
to the Christmas Spectacular.

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:15.119
Maddie: In the kickline I'm thinking, what
leg goes first.

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:18.630
Megan: Just remembering the sequence and the
counts.

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.560
Maddie: All the counts and the sequences and
I'm just praying that no one is messing up

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.350
and that everyone is together.
Lexy: The hardest part about doing the kicks

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:31.729
is making sure they're exactly eye-high. So
you'll get energized and really feeling it

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:35.000
and the next thing you know your kicks are
way too high and they're not coming down fast

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.500
enough, so you have to be right on.
Alesia: Dancing in the Rockettes' rehearsal

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:45.409
space was really fun because it's just amazing.
Dancing here you know that other dancers and

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:49.170
the Rockettes, professional dancers, have
been dancing here. You're here too, so it's

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:49.869
just an honor being here.
