00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:09.900
There is a lot of work in the scientific literature

00:00:09.901 --> 00:00:11.001
on the brain mechanisms

00:00:11.002 --> 00:00:14.002
that underlie different kinds of emotions

00:00:16.503 --> 00:00:19.003
and compassion and

00:00:19.404 --> 00:00:23.904
love and loving kindness and forgiveness

00:00:24.905 --> 00:00:27.805
each include at least components of emotion.

00:00:29.206 --> 00:00:30.906
And so, you might think of

00:00:31.007 --> 00:00:34.907
these values or qualities as properly belonging

00:00:35.908 --> 00:00:38.008
to the scientific study of emotion.

00:00:39.009 --> 00:00:40.909
I've been

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:45.110
a person who has done a lot of research on

00:00:45.111 --> 00:00:49.111
what we call Affective Neuroscience which is the

00:00:49.112 --> 00:00:54.012
brain mechanisms that underlie emotion or affective processes.

00:00:54.013 --> 00:00:58.013
And, yet, if you turn to a textbook of emotion

00:00:59.014 --> 00:01:03.014
or to a scientific - the scientific literature

00:01:03.715 --> 00:01:07.115
on emotion, up until very, very recently

00:01:07.416 --> 00:01:10.816
there were hardly any references

00:01:10.817 --> 00:01:12.017
to these qualities.

00:01:13.118 --> 00:01:15.918
Virtually, all of the work was focused

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:19.719
on a much narrower and for the most part

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.220
considerably negative range of emotions.

00:01:22.221 --> 00:01:24.921
Emotions like fear and anxiety and disgust

00:01:26.922 --> 00:01:31.622
were the ones that were highlighted.

00:01:32.024 --> 00:01:34.424
And so,we decided that there is

00:01:34.825 --> 00:01:37.005
absolutely no reason why one could not

00:01:37.035 --> 00:01:40.125
harness the rigor and the tools

00:01:40.126 --> 00:01:43.026
that had been so effectively honed

00:01:43.027 --> 00:01:45.507
in the study of these negative qualities in mind

00:01:46.028 --> 00:01:49.828
and turn our attention to virtuous qualities.

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:56.829
Neuroplasticity is probably

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.230
the most important concept to emerge from Neuroscience in the last decade.

00:02:02.431 --> 00:02:04.731
And, simply put, it refers to the idea

00:02:04.732 --> 00:02:07.832
that more than any other organ in our body

00:02:07.933 --> 00:02:10.861
the brain is built to change in response to experience

00:02:11.034 --> 00:02:13.834
or in response to training.

00:02:13.835 --> 00:02:15.735
And, with that as a framework,

00:02:15.836 --> 00:02:20.636
we can then approach these positive qualities of mind

00:02:21.637 --> 00:02:24.637
as the end product of skills,

00:02:24.638 --> 00:02:27.638
which can be cultivated and trained.

00:02:27.639 --> 00:02:31.139
And so, the notion that a person has a fixed level

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.940
of compassion or of kindness

00:02:33.941 --> 00:02:35.941
really flies in the face of

00:02:35.942 --> 00:02:37.742
everything we know about the brain.

00:02:38.143 --> 00:02:40.033
But, we as a culture

00:02:40.144 --> 00:02:43.344
have not thought systematically about how

00:02:43.445 --> 00:02:44.945
these qualities can be cultivated.

00:02:44.946 --> 00:02:48.046
But, there really isn't anything fundamentally different

00:02:48.047 --> 00:02:49.947
about cultivating compassion

00:02:49.948 --> 00:02:54.948
than there is about learning to play golf or chess.

00:02:55.149 --> 00:02:56.849
It's our view that,

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:59.250
even among people who

00:02:59.451 --> 00:03:02.551
report that they have relatively little of these qualities,

00:03:03.152 --> 00:03:06.652
each of us is born with the potential

00:03:06.753 --> 00:03:08.553
for all of these qualities.

00:03:08.954 --> 00:03:11.754
And, it's something that through training

00:03:11.855 --> 00:03:12.955
can be cultivated.

00:03:13.556 --> 00:03:16.756
And, many of the world's great contemplative traditions

00:03:16.907 --> 00:03:21.757
have, as part of their set of practices,

00:03:21.898 --> 00:03:25.788
techniques to cultivate these positive human qualities.

00:03:25.959 --> 00:03:29.759
And so, we've been extremely interested

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:33.860
in the use of meditation and other kinds of contemplative practices

00:03:33.961 --> 00:03:36.361
as vehicles for training

00:03:36.362 --> 00:03:37.062
the enhancement of these qualities.
