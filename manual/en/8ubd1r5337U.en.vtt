00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:13.140
HTC Desire X.

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:15.500
Expected September 2012.

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:20.830
At the moment there seems to be a trend of
consumers looking at larger screens when upgrading

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:25.410
their smartphones, with a steady increase
in display size over the past couple of years.

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:29.920
But bigger screens tend to be more expensive,
and this creates a price barrier for potential

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:33.470
consumers.

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:39.410
The HTC Desire X is a handset that does offer
a relatively large 4.0" touchscreen display,

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:46.340
but it keeps the costs down by limiting the
resolution to a fairly modest 480 x 800 pixels.

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:51.990
Nokia pulled off an even more audacious version
of this trick with the 4.3" Lumia 900, and

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:57.510
it seems that many consumers are simply not
that bothered about the pixel count.

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:04.360
Furthermore, the rest of the Desire X's specifications
seem to have been designed in a similar way.

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:10.920
The dual-core 1GHz CPU isn't quite as fast
as the market leaders, the 768Mb of RAM is

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.590
a bit below what you might find in the top
of the range devices, the 5 megapixel camera

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:19.860
isn't quite keeping up with the 8+ megapixels
that are becoming common these days.

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:25.740
But it's a pretty powerful and capable handset
nonetheless.

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.869
Twelve months ago most of this hardware would
have been state-of-the-art.

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:33.280
But these days the hardware is just a lot
cheaper while still being pretty powerful,

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:40.679
so the Desire X is still likely to be a very
nice device in use.

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:45.030
Despite the slightly not-quite-cutting-edge
specifications, the software is much more

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:52.159
up-to-date with Android 4.0 and HTC Sense
4.0 running on top to make it look pretty.

00:01:52.159 --> 00:01:57.250
Music playback is enhanced with Beats Audio,
and there are number of other HTC enhancements

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:58.250
too.

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:02.700
It does everything that every other Android
4.0 smartphone does, but it has the advantage

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:07.810
of looking rather nicer than most of its rivals.

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:12.740
The HTC Desire X is due for release during
September 2012, but no guidance has been given

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:13.870
on price.

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.040
We don't expect this to be a very expensive
handset though, we guess that it will retail

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:24.250
for around â‚¬300 or so including taxes in
order to be competitive.
