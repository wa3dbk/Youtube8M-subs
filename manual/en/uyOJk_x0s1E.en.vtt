00:00:05.259 --> 00:00:07.599
How to incorporate merengue into a bachata.

00:00:07.599 --> 00:00:10.269
Merengue is a very, very interactive and playful
genre.

00:00:10.269 --> 00:00:13.250
What we're going to do is have as much fun
as we can with this next move.

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:16.930
We're going to start with the basic and one,
two, three forward.

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:19.410
Going to let go and swing back.

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:25.130
One, five and seven and we come back together
five, six, seven.

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:26.520
One, two, three.

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:27.520
Let's try it from the other side.

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:35.140
Five, six, seven and one, two, three tap,
open up and we swing back, five, six, seven

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:38.649
and we two, three, get back together.

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:40.160
Now let's break this step down.

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:45.559
We're going to start by basic in place and
one, two, three tap.

00:00:45.559 --> 00:00:47.850
Five, six and open up.

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:52.100
Here when we open, this is our cue that we're
going to be going away from each other.

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.250
So if you want to give each other a little
push which helps, we're going to start by

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:03.249
swinging, swing tap, swing tap, swing tap,
swing and tap.

00:01:03.249 --> 00:01:04.249
Here comes the basic.

00:01:04.249 --> 00:01:06.729
This basic into each other should be very
playful.

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:08.970
You're kind of going to get your partner,
right?

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:10.610
It's, like, "Hey, where are you going?"

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:12.370
And you're back to where you started.

00:01:12.370 --> 00:01:13.690
Now the tap.

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:18.720
Make sure that when you're swinging, the tap
lands in the middle, then you open.

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:24.370
Middle open, middle open, middle and then
we're ready to pick up our partner.

00:01:24.370 --> 00:01:28.750
Daniela: Ladies, for you it's all about the
hips.

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:29.910
Just keep moving your hips.

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:32.540
If you want to move your hands side to side
that's great.

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:39.820
If you want to move them up and caress your
body, not always level, but you'll look sexy.

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:44.440
Edwin: And gentlemen, for you merengue's all
about this whole feeling sure about the dance.

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:47.740
We have to make sure that you feel the bounce
in the step.

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:48.740
You're bouncing.

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.820
Your arms are not doing too much, but you're
still guiding them one side then the other.

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:57.030
Now remember when you're getting close to
each other again, make that basic very different,

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.250
than when you're just social dancing.

00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:02.170
You're just kind of picking up your partner,
like, "Hey, how are you doing?"

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:04.010
And you're back to normal.

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:15.280
Let's try this with some music.

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:36.459
Other side.

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:40.390
Make sure that you have as much fun with this
step and gentlemen make sure that you feel

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:41.390
confident.

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:43.190
Make sure that you smile, look at your partner.

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:47.660
Look at each other, interact, and have fun,
and that is merengue into bachata.
