00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:10.010
Hi, this is Dina for Splitcoaststampers. In
this tutorial I'll show you how to create

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:16.910
a Twisted Easel Card, and then two ways to
complete a double twisted easel card. 

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:22.150
The construction of the base of the single card
is very simple. You'll need a piece cardstock cut

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:29.150
to 4 1/4" x 8 1/2". Score down the center at
4 1/4". 

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:34.930
The second score line you'll make will

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:41.930
be a diagonal one, upper left corner to the
bottom of the center score line. 

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:51.520
Fold on the score lines and give them a good crease, and that's the basic structure for the card - the

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:56.600
diagonal line allows the card front to sit
up at an angle with the inside of the card

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.840
as its base. You're going to create a front panel for the

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:07.520
card - I made mine a square but yours can
be any size up to 4 1/4" wide and 4 1/4" to

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:12.160
5 1/2" high if you want it to fit in a standard
envelope. You'll adhere the panel

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:17.970
to the lower triangular section of the front
panel; do not put adhesive on the upper triangular

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.290
portion or your card won't sit up correctly.

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:26.960
 On the inside of the card, add a raised element - it can be a pearl or button or a raised die cut. 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:34.840
Put it toward the corner or even up toward the center of the panel and that will hold

00:01:34.849 --> 00:01:38.969
the easel element open and in place when the card is open.

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:45.880
Here's my completed card - that image is from the Cat's Pajamas Rubber Stamps and I think it is just so cute.

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:52.880
Let's move on to the double easel card - 

00:01:53.020 --> 00:02:00.020
we're going to start with a base that is 8" square,
and score it down the center at 4". 

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:06.500
I'm going to give the cardstock a quarter turn and line
it up at 4" again, and then I want to make

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:11.060
a cut from that score line straight up to
the edge of the cardstock.

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:16.620
There are 2 different ways that you can score
the diagonals for the double easel, so I'll

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:21.690
show you both and you can decide which one
will work best for your card. To have the

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:27.130
panels facing toward the center of the card,
your score lines will be made from the outside

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:34.130
corners down to the point where your score
line and cut line meet, and you'll make that

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:36.450
score line on both sides. 

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:44.140
If you're working on a Scor-Pal or other score board it's easy since this is a square to line up the opposite points 

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:49.840
on the score line, and then just make a score line from the corner down to the center there.

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.680
So those score lines allow your front panels
to face toward each other when the card is

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:58.980
displayed. That's my preference, but I've
seen easel cards that had the front panels

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:04.360
facing out instead, so I'll show you how to
do that too, in case you'd like to try it yourself.

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:09.500
The first steps for creating the base are
the same, but the score lines will go instead

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:13.620
from the top of the cut line out to the
ends of the scored line.

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:25.420
Whichever method you choose, after you've
made your score lines, go ahead and fold on

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:30.160
all the lines and crease them really well
with a bone folder or another tool - I like

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:33.240
to use the side of my stylus but you can use whatever works for you.

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:39.160
 When you make your creases, be sure your edges line up nicely.

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:46.700
Here you can see the difference between the
two methods of scoring the base. 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:49.860
It's just a difference of which way your panels will fold when your card is displayed.

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:56.819
You'll create 2 panels for your card front,
and this time I've made my panels 4" square,

00:03:56.819 --> 00:04:01.890
because I want this card to be able to fit
in a standard business size envelope. Just

00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:07.349
like before, You're going to adhere the panel
to the lower triangular section of the front panel;

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:14.349
don't put adhesive on the top triangle section or your card won't open correctly. 

00:04:14.349 --> 00:04:17.940
If you use this angle for your diagonal lines, when you put your front panels on

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:24.900
be sure to pay attention to the way
you position your panels. When the card is

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:30.850
open you want your image or text to be upright
but with this fold those bases are toward

00:04:30.850 --> 00:04:36.250
the center when the card is closed. I used
a pattern on my card front so that wouldn't

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:43.250
matter, but if you're using a stamped image
or text, you'll want to pay attention to that.

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:49.750
I put a cardstock panel on the inside of my
card, and I'm going to center this raised

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:55.400
die cut sentiment on the inside of the card,
and that's what is going to hold the front

00:04:55.400 --> 00:05:00.060
panels open when the card is displayed. Instead
of having one raised element in the center,

00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:04.910
you could use 2 elements, one on each side
- just position your inside elements so they're

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:09.750
either centered or at equal distances from
the center so the panels stand at the same angle.

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:13.780
Here's that card all finished - I used a strip

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:18.030
of cardstock to make a belly band to hold
it closed, with another die cut sentiment on the front.

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:24.750
The card with the alternate fold is constructed

00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:32.680
in the same way, with front panels and adhesive
just on the lower triangles. For this orientation,

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:37.730
if you use an image or sentiment, those will
align to the outside when the card is closed.

00:05:37.730 --> 00:05:44.730
I used the same die cut sentiment on this
card for the inside panel, but it might actually be better to use

00:05:44.790 --> 00:05:50.330
2 separate elements on the inside of the card
that would be placed toward the center of

00:05:50.330 --> 00:05:56.780
each of the panels when they're standing - maybe
next time I'll try it that way.

00:05:56.780 --> 00:06:00.419
Here's that completed card, with the belly
band again to hold it together for presentation.

00:06:00.419 --> 00:06:04.940
Hope you'll give one or both of these cards
a try and share with us. Thank you so much

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:05.710
for watching.
