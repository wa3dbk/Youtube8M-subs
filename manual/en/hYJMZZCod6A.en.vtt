00:00:22.424 --> 00:00:24.424
Come on! come on! come on!

00:00:24.652 --> 00:00:26.652
Come on! come on!

00:00:26.652 --> 00:00:28.415
Watch the keeper!

00:00:28.415 --> 00:00:28.997
Watch him!

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:33.840
Good, good! They are good!

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:41.400
Yes!!!

00:00:48.034 --> 00:00:50.034
You were very lucky, guys!

00:00:50.034 --> 00:00:50.931
They won!

00:00:50.931 --> 00:00:51.783
You were very lucky!

00:00:51.967 --> 00:00:53.967
We were focused on winning the game

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:59.120
and now let's see what happens against Javi and Soso

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.380
We hope we can beat them as well and be the champions

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:04.417
We hope that Soso and Javi beat AndrÃ© and Diego

00:01:04.417 --> 00:01:05.972
and that we beat them afterwards

00:01:05.972 --> 00:01:07.724
so that there is a triple draw

00:01:07.724 --> 00:01:08.902
and we can break the deadlock and win

00:01:08.984 --> 00:01:10.504
We want to win this tournament so let's go for it!

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:18.260
Come on, Javi!

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:19.280
Come on!

00:01:19.712 --> 00:01:21.712
Calm down, guy!

00:01:32.443 --> 00:01:34.443
Look who scored!

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:36.820
Wow, what a great talent!

00:01:39.309 --> 00:01:41.309
Wow, what a great talent!

00:01:42.601 --> 00:01:44.601
Watch it! things are getting warmed up!

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:02.140
What a wonder goal!

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:07.400
This was incredible!

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:08.820
Congrats, guys!

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:09.620
Thank you!

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.280
I think that they deserve the win and to continue in the competition

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:15.910
We are in the final so let's enjoy it!

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:17.470
We don't fear anyone

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:20.140
and I think we are getting better and better at it

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.700
We've got to have faith in ourselves!

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:42.600
Come on, come on!

00:02:44.966 --> 00:02:46.486
You don't know how to play this!

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:05.320
How lucky they were!

00:03:07.358 --> 00:03:09.358
Yes! Look at the time!

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:15.480
What a wonder goal!!

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:25.180
We are the champions!!

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:27.756
Thank you for the adventure!

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:29.895
You were the best

00:03:29.895 --> 00:03:30.795
Thank you very much!

00:03:30.809 --> 00:03:32.809
This is an honour and we are joint winners

00:03:32.809 --> 00:03:36.060
so now we have to compete with the second winning partnership to see who wins

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:40.360
We are very strong and thank you very much for the prize

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:45.600
And now we await the champions of the EA Sports suite at Mestalla
