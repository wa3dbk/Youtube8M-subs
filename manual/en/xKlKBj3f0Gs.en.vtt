00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:08.380
So, today I'm going to show you how to decorate
a cake with fresh fruit.

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:12.639
I'm using a mango, kiwi, blackberries and
strawberries.

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:18.440
But you can use any type of fruit that you
like as long as it fits in the parameters

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:20.290
of a cake topper.

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:23.630
So, anything nice and, kind of juicy and luscious.

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:25.150
Berries are great.

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:26.480
Mango is great.

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:29.650
I would just avoid anything that's going to
turn brown as it sits.

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:30.940
Like apples and pears.

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:33.180
But other than that.

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.160
I'm just prepping my mango by using my peeler.

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:37.829
Taking the skin off.

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:44.269
And then I'm going to take a nice big chef's
knife and just go around the pit.

00:00:44.269 --> 00:00:48.679
I choose the least ripe mango.

00:00:48.679 --> 00:00:52.210
I think I could have found, alright that's
plenty.

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:54.140
Hold on to this.

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:57.149
Now, for the mango I just like to use slices.

00:00:57.149 --> 00:01:01.989
But you really can have fun with this and
do any shape that you like.

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:09.960
I try to go nice and pretty thin but not too
thin.

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.622
If your mango is really ripe and soft you
can go really extra thin and, kind of, use

00:01:13.622 --> 00:01:16.400
it as ribbons and, kind of, fold it onto itself.

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.330
It's really beautiful.

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:25.190
In the meantime.

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:27.350
Beautiful.

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:32.520
So, our mango is ready.

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.750
Next I'm just going to prepare my kiwi.

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:38.540
I just like to trim the ends off.

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:45.860
Trim the ends off and then I take my peeler
and just peel the sides.

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:48.100
Just like I did for my mango.

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:55.370
This way I'm getting the most fruit I possibly
can.

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:57.190
Okay?

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:00.370
And just give that a nice little slice.

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:04.250
You can also just use a pairing knife if that's
easier.

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:05.570
Nice thin slices.

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:11.590
And again, the more color you have on your
cake and the more interest you can, kind of,

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:15.680
put on the top of it the better it will look.

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:21.410
If the two big slices are large I just cut
them in half right down the center.

00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:23.840
Beautiful.

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.090
And then for my strawberries.

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:33.319
For a good amount of them I'm just going to
take the stems off and cut them into quarters.

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:35.570
And then some of them I'm going to leave the
stems on.

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:40.200
And you'll see it will just make it a little
more decorative and very pretty.

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.930
And for my blackberries I'm just going to
half them.

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.830
Because I think that's the most beautiful,
really get a look into the inside and you

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:50.430
have that beautiful white and purple, kind
of, shining through.

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:53.910
It's going to be a really nice balance.

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:56.660
So, that's it.

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:57.660
Start building it up.

00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.120
Half my blackberries.

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:05.060
You can see it's just really, it's a nice
nice thing to do.

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:07.790
And blueberries would be really beautiful
on this.

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:12.270
If you have some pistachios sprinkle some
pistachios over on the end.

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:13.880
It's really pretty.

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:15.909
And that is it.
