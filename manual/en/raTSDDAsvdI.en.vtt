And that concludes
Mabel's Guide to Hair Topiary

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:04.880
What is it?

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:06.708
It's an ostrich.
It's clearly an ostrich.

00:00:07.954 --> 00:00:09.310
Ka-Kaw!

Today: Mabel's Guide To Stickers!

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:29.800
Throughout history, stickers have been

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.200
the backbone of many great civilizations

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:33.050
No, they haven't

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:35.420
The ancient greeks used leeches for stickers!

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:38.450
The more stickers you had, the cooler you were!

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:40.000
Nope. Not true!

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.651
The ancient aztecs chest skull
was the modern equivalent to today's

00:00:44.651 --> 00:00:47.130
"Orange You Happy, Mon?"

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:50.610
Yes, Aztec war paint was exactly like a rasta orange

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:52.680
Mabel, have you ever read a history book?

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:53.417
Edited out!

00:00:54.708 --> 00:00:56.914
Edit! Edit! Edit!

00:00:56.914 --> 00:00:58.080
Cut away!

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:01.170
Let's take a look at my personal Sticktionary

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.840
Stickers fall into several distinct categories

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.120
Puffy stickers

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:06.742
So soft!

00:01:07.371 --> 00:01:08.770
Goofily-eye stickers

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:10.910
Aah! It's like they're watching me!

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:12.060
Bumper stickers

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.080
Scratch and sniff

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.100
Sniff and touch

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.090
Listen and taste

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.660
And price stickers

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:18.850
You can get these ones free at the store

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:20.020
Don't they need those?

00:01:20.902 --> 00:01:23.290
Stickers. Stickers. Stickers.

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:24.970
Free TV's everybody!

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:26.680
Ah! Free TV!
Get free TV!

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.810
Listen, Dipper, you shouldn't doubt my authority

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:31.010
In the sticker world

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:33.337
I'm the girl who can get you things

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:35.920
I need a sticker to put on my car that will

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.480
You know, get the cops off my back

00:01:39.131 --> 00:01:39.850
Oh!

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:41.748
Uh-Un! My price

00:01:44.948 --> 00:01:46.580
I'm going to get so sick

00:01:49.565 --> 00:01:51.550
Mabel, don't you think those
are hazardous to your health?

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:52.011
Edited out!

00:01:53.337 --> 00:01:55.051
Edit! Edit! Edit!

00:01:55.554 --> 00:01:56.930
What? How'd i get here?

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:59.400
Thanks for watching Mabel's Guide to Stickers.

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:00.820
And now, a riddle!

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:03.010
What kind of sticker can save your life?

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.428
Waddles, if you please

00:02:07.108 --> 00:02:07.634
Oof!

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:11.462
Puffy stickers!

00:02:12.868 --> 00:02:14.240
Still really hurt, though.
