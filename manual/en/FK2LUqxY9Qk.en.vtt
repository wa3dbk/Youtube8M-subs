Breakfast is one of my favorite meals, and
one of my family's top morning requests is

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:06.910
the grilled breakfast sandwich. Let me show
you how to make it.

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:10.650
You know, this egg sandwich is a nice departure
from eggs and cereal and it's really easy

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:11.269
to make.

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:14.769
To make these grilled breakfast sandwiches,
I first start off by first cooking off my

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:15.530
bacon.

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:19.510
Today I'm making two sandwiches and I'm using
three slices of turkey bacon per sandwich.

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:23.230
Now you can use regular bacon, ham, or even
sausage if you prefer.

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:27.289
The bacon's cooked off. Now we're going to
go ahead and butter up the bread. I'm using

00:00:27.289 --> 00:00:30.189
sourdough for this grilled sandwich. It makes
all the difference.

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:36.800
For a uniform sandwich, you want to take your
two slices, unfold them, use room temperature

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:43.800
butter for easy spreading and you want to
go all the way to the edges.

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:50.559
After I fold the bread back over, butter side
to butter side, we're going to start laying

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:57.410
down our cheese. I'm using a Kraft deli deluxe
cheddar for one sandwich, that's my wife's

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:02.149
favorite, and I'm using a pepper jack cheese
for my sandwich.

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:09.140
Next we're going to lay down the bacon on
top of the cheese. 

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:15.520
Next I'm going to whisk up two eggs.

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:23.180
The pan's been preheating on medium. Now I'm going to go ahead and spray it 

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:28.610
and we're going to add the eggs. If you don't have cooking
spray, you can add butter to your pan. I'm

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:35.270
going to let that set up a bit and divide
it into two separate patties for the sandwiches.

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:36.820
Flip it.

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:43.820
All right, put that on top of the bacon. 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.940
And  these are going to go back in the pan but we have to get it hot again.

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:55.950
Place the sandwich into the pan, butter side
down. I have the pan medium high because I

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:02.700
want our bread to be golden brown and the
cheese to melt. 

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:12.900
After 3 minutes, it's time to turn and get a nice golden brown sandwich
there.

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:25.780
All right after another 3 minutes, it's time
to pull them out of the pan and eat. 

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:34.360
Perfectly grilled bread with a nice melted cheese in
the middle. It's going to be heaven.

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:40.940
Hope you enjoy this grilled sourdough breakfast
sandwich. I know I will. Thanks for tubing in!
