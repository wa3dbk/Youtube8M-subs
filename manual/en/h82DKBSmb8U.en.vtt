00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:20.000
I was telling you that when we graduate from college we believe that, 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
the outside world will be waiting for us with open arms, greeting us with flowers, etc

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
That we have done something incredible by graduating.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
(English)
Degree can't prove anything.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
You have to prove yourself,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.000
by what you are. 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Patience,

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
patience,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
patience comes through passion.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
If you have got passion for something,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
naturally, you

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
you will be 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
using your patience also

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000

About "three idiots", you should ask him

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
I always say 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
follow your passion

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
With the release of the film "three idiots"

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
Now people have begun to understand this

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
Before in Pakistan, 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
there used to be three  professions.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
One of them was 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
an engineer

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
The other one was a doctor

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
and the third one was an unfortunate

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Everyone and the parents used to say, 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
this one is an unfortunate.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
(English)
I was an assistant director in cooperatives,

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000
but there wasn't anything creative,

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
there wasn't anything which, 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000
mattered

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
so I resigned

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
and temperamentally, I think I was 

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
born with this thing

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
 And I love teaching

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
And teaching is something like a 

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
like a gardener

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
he plants small plants

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
and they grow

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000
and they bear flowers and fruits

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000
So going to observe them

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
growing

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.000
is a very satisfying experience

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
so if you are good to somebody he is going to, 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000
pay you back 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000
(Urdu)
You are making a very small sketch, why

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.000
Right now you are doing individual shapes, 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
in a small size.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
(English)
Painting is something, 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:44.000
an escape from your...

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
its an escape from your pain

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
so when you are involved in something,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
then, you forget,

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
your sufferings.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
If he asked me, who are you?

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
It's a very difficult question,

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
because I don`t know,

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.000
who I am.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000
If I tell him my name,

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
that doesn`t mean anything.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
my face,

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.000
doesn`t mean anything

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:24.000
because my face is a...

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000
is a mask.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000
everybody is wearing a mask

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.000
nobody know, who

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000
who am I

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000
It`s a difficult question, I 

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000
I don`t know if I 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000
tell him my name

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000
and my profession 

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
what does it matter

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.000
Life is, 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.000
one day morning till evening

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000
the gone is gone

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.000
and what is coming to you,

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.000
who knows what is coming next

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000
but today is important

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000
like you go on peeling an onion

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:21.000
Till the last minute you expect that something come out of it.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
And then...it`s gone.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:26.000
And nothing comes out of it.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.000
What matters is today.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000
Morning till evening

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000
So everybody lives,

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000
practically, everybody lives one day.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.000
Today

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000
How can..

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000
my experience

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:54.000
help to coming generations

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.000
because everything will be different

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000
Passing on my experience

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000
Yes, collectively knowledge

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000
is the starting point

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000
of the next generation

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.000
so they will have their own experiences

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000
life is such a game

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000
it`s a game

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000
when you understand the rule of the life,

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000
the time is up.
