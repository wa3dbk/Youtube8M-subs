Hey guise whats going on its Rob here from
Gadgetgyaan

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:15.530
with the preview of LG's 3D capable G-Slate
Tablet This tablet

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:20.800
unique from others like iPad or Xoom because
it has 3D videorecording

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:25.109
and playback capabilities This news is coming
just a few daays before

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:29.359
Moblie World Congress event which is going
to be held in Barcelona

00:00:29.359 --> 00:00:35.150
So guise like most of the tablets it supports
a 1GHz dual core NVIDIA Tegra 2

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:40.970
processor It has a 8.9 ich 3D capable multitouch
display

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:45.250
This slate from LG has built in gyroscope
and accelerometer as well

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:49.480
and G Slate will run on Honeycomb or Android
3.0

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:54.020
Also on this device you can do videochatting
over Wi-Fi or 4G network and from

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:59.359
4G network I remembered that this device is
going to T-Mobile and its a 4G device

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:04.660
Along with a 1GHz NVIDIA Tegra 2 processor
G Slate has 32 gigs of internal memory

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:11.850
On the back of the device what we can see
here is that their is a 5 megapixel camera

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:17.869
with flash present on the back and supports
1080p HD videorecording Also it can

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:24.070
playback 1080p videos on external display
via HDMI The G Slate will also feature a

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:29.450
rear facing 3D stereoscopic camera array which
looks to be made up of two cameras

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:36.450
operatin in tandem to produce the 3D effect
This will also allow users to record 1080p

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:39.819
3D videos
and view 3D content on the device or external

00:01:39.819 --> 00:01:43.940
display It is unfortunate that viewing 3D
on G Slate

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:49.280
will require glasses you know red and blue
variety well its expected that the device

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:52.340
will be launched in
this spring and the price of the device is

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:55.649
not confirmed yet But I am quite sure that
you will be

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:00.680
very excited about this tablet as I am as
its running Android 3.0 and most importantly

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:17.350
3D video recording and playback which keeps
the G Slate far from the crowd of

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:23.940
the other tablets.
