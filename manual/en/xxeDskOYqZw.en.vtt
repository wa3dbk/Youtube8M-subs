This is another episode of Sorry Can't Drive about the food that I ate when I was in Santa, Monica, California

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:08.220
I'm a vegetarian so I don't eat meat or fish.

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:13.469
I was really really open to trying new foods and trying new things under the kind of vegan/vegetarian

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:18.659
umbrella. Anyway here you go, here's some of the gorgeous tasty food that I had when I was in Santa, Monica

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:24.269
California and the places where I got this food. One of the places we went was Swingers diner a hipster

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:29.459
haven if I've ever seen one and it was really nice. We sat outside even though it was a bit chilly and we only had smoothies

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.060
But they have this massive

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:35.579
Huge range of smoothies and you can make your own and that's what we did. I can't really remember

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:36.630
what was in that one

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:42.059
but it was really really lovely and as you can see there's like some of the crazy selection of their smoothies and some of their

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:44.609
menu. The menu has all sorts of interesting things in it including

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:48.419
"Bite me!" cupcakes which reminds me of some of the things that I said when I went to the grocery store

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:52.710
new Moon chocolate for example which looked like it was way past expiration date and

00:00:53.170 --> 00:01:01.020
Sweethearts Twilight like love heart style as well as like real fruit pizza. Like does anyone actually eat that really?

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:02.699
We also wanted Panera.

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:09.118
I love Panera so much, but tomato soup in a bread bowl is my favourite thing in the world and then Interim cafe with Marion.

00:01:09.189 --> 00:01:16.289
So yummy such an amazing range of vegan foods of vegetarian foods with loads of hemp in everything so good for you

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.379
I had a Brazilian Bowl which is this amazing creation

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:28.470
Which the only unfortunate downside was that it in turned into this strange purple potion once you've eat all the really really good stuff.

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.470
But it was still really tasty.

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:34.559
I can't even remember the name of what Marion had but I think was called a Borbossa.

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.439
The cafe was a little head in a way, but everything was really fresh

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:40.859
They had a great range, there was Jimi Hendrix on the wall, there were these really amazing

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:45.899
Grapefruit lamps, which I really really enjoyed as you can see here and pretty cool

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:51.089
And there was also a pumpkin because apparently you know it's still Halloween. As you can see we ate very well.

00:01:51.089 --> 00:01:55.280
I also got an Egyptian rose Smoothie. Which I absolutely loved so I recommend it.

00:01:55.900 --> 00:02:00.520
Hey  wheat, yeast and gluten free pizza, and house tea,

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.600
and yours is a TV dinner right?

00:02:06.220 --> 00:02:09.660
But it's all vegetarian/vegan right? Yeah.

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:14.490
We also went to Real Food Daily which is a little on the pricey side and a little on the fancy side

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:18.329
But has an amazing range of food, and you don't think that all that food is going to fill you up

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:21.209
but it does after about two slices it was

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:23.909
Amazing. It was so so good

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:29.670
and the great thing about America is that if you can't finish it they give you these great little boxes that's something common to a

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.320
Lot of America you can just ask for box if you haven't finished your food

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:36.140
And you can take it home with you so that kind of makes up for the insane amount of food that they give you everywhere

00:02:36.149 --> 00:02:40.160
And also the slightly higher cost in this place, because I was eating at all evening

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:45.600
Something that me and my friend Bree really got into was making sandwiches. We also went to the farmers market

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:48.480
And bought lots of berries and things and took them to the beach

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:52.499
So trying everything to make it like a picnic style and also save us

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.369
a bit of money. Worked out really well in the end and we just ended up craving sandwiches all the time

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:04.050
But in America they didn't put butter on sandwiches

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:10.020
how weird is that? So weird! Everyone looked at me a bit strangely when I was buttering my bread. In conclusion and

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:12.600
Unsurprisingly Southern California has amazing food

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:17.459
Especially if you're a vegetarian there are lots of chain options available if you're a chain kind of person

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:20.519
But I recommend stepping outside the box because there's lots of great

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:28.110
Independent places to try so thanks for my friends to Bree and to Marion for showing me around and finding good places to eat. I appreciate it
