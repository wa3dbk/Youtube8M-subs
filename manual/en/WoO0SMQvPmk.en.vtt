00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:05.130
Now that you've learned about the
toolkit, I bet you're wondering what

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.669
classes you're required to take to
complete your degree.

00:00:08.669 --> 00:00:11.440
Your degree check is going to be a
helpful tool

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:13.529
as we walk through these requirements.

00:00:13.529 --> 00:00:17.300
Go ahead and keep it open in another
window as we walk through it.

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:20.779
Completing your degree is a little bit
like assembling a puzzle.

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:24.539
You have to fit all the different
pieces together to finish.  At first it

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:25.800
looks like a lot.

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.199
But if you take it one piece at a time
it will start to come together.

00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:30.910
So let's break it down.

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:33.810
Take a look at your online degree check.

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:38.900
The degree requirements start in the
section conveniently labeled degree requirements.

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:41.010
This section list three things:

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:42.070
total credits,

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:45.590
upper-division credits, and completion of a major.

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:50.020
The total number of credits you'd need to
get a degree is 180.

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:54.870
That's the minimum, so 179.5 is not gonna cut it.

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.350
From that 180, at least 60 credits must be upper-division.

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:02.890
Upper-division credits refer to the 3000- and 4000-level

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:04.850
classes that you'll take.

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:07.320
You also have to complete a major.

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.050
SPU has a lot of options to choose from.

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:13.009
You're welcome to do more than one major or add on a minor,

00:01:13.009 --> 00:01:16.390
but everyone must complete one major.

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:19.180
The next section is the competencies.

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:23.000
These are a couple of skills that you
need to master at a college level.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.980
And SPU requires two:

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:27.080
writing and foreign language.

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:32.000
Most new students will meet the writing
competency by taking ENG 2201,

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.110
our college composition course.

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.039
Some of you won't need to, though,

00:01:36.039 --> 00:01:39.810
if you have high test scores in English
or you've taken an approved composition

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.290
course before.

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:45.300
The English department will let you know
whether or not you should take the class.

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:46.610
Either way you do it,

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:50.250
everyone must fulfill the writing competency.

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:54.120
Now, this is a great time to mention that
a lot of people confuse the writing

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:58.280
competency with the writing credits
requirement.  The writing credits requirement

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.380
or "W" credits as they are often called,

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.890
are separate from the writing competency.

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:07.630
"W" credit classes teach you to write at an
advanced level within a particular

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:09.099
discipline.

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:12.989
These classes are usually upper-division
and you don't need to start looking for them

00:02:12.989 --> 00:02:15.619
until later in your sophomore or junior
year

00:02:15.619 --> 00:02:19.569
Most majors have these classes built-in already.

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:21.020
Back to competencies,

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:24.939
the other competency you need is foreign
language.

00:02:24.939 --> 00:02:28.260
Again there are a few different ways to meet this competency and you may already be

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:29.379
done with it.

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:32.280
If you've done three years a foreign
language of high school

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.159
and finished with a "C" or better,

00:02:34.159 --> 00:02:36.719
your foreign language competency is met.

00:02:36.719 --> 00:02:40.329
If not, you'll need to complete up
through level three of a foreign

00:02:40.329 --> 00:02:42.779
language series at SPU.

00:02:42.779 --> 00:02:47.109
If you're starting from square one,
that's three quarters of a language.

00:02:47.109 --> 00:02:50.869
If you've had some foreign language
before but still need more to meet the

00:02:50.869 --> 00:02:55.390
competency, be sure to take the placement test in this blackboard tutorial

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:57.930
and talk with your adviser at the NSA
event

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:02.039
about what courses you need to meet the
requirement.

00:03:02.039 --> 00:03:04.389
Now let's look at the Common Curriculum.

00:03:04.389 --> 00:03:08.359
Everyone who completes an SPU degree
needs these courses.  So, regardless of

00:03:08.359 --> 00:03:12.419
your major, all students have these
requirements in common.

00:03:12.419 --> 00:03:13.240
The first

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:14.889
is University Seminar.

00:03:14.889 --> 00:03:18.549
If you're an incoming freshman, you're
required to take USEM 1000

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:19.779
in the fall.

00:03:19.779 --> 00:03:23.159
If you've been out of high school for a
year or more, you are exempt from 

00:03:23.159 --> 00:03:24.979
USEM 1000.

00:03:24.979 --> 00:03:29.809
The three UCOR classes cover topics
in the arts and humanities, social

00:03:29.809 --> 00:03:32.049
sciences, and philosophy.

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:34.320
The three UFDN classes

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:36.519
cover topics in Christianity:

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:39.789
formation, scriptures, and theology.

00:03:39.789 --> 00:03:44.300
In general, you should take the 1000-level courses before you move on.

00:03:44.309 --> 00:03:47.790
If you're a transfer student with 90 credits
or more, you'll notice that you are

00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:51.089
required to take UFDN 3001

00:03:51.089 --> 00:03:55.649
instead of UFDN 1000 and 2000.

00:03:55.649 --> 00:03:59.319
The Ways of Knowing requirement allows
you to pick from a list of courses

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:02.599
within six different categories: arts,

00:04:02.599 --> 00:04:04.849
humanities, quantitative reasoning,

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:08.209
applied science, fundamental science, and social science.

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:11.779
For each category, you need five credits.

00:04:11.779 --> 00:04:16.149
The Ways of Engaging requirements gives you an opportunity to learn something in a

00:04:16.149 --> 00:04:18.229
different field than your major.

00:04:18.229 --> 00:04:22.439
You must pick a class that is not in your major to meet this requirement.

00:04:22.439 --> 00:04:25.619
Most students will take this course in
the second half of their SPU career

00:04:25.619 --> 00:04:28.069
once they finalize their degree plan.

00:04:28.069 --> 00:04:31.550
Remember, this is also a five-credit
requirement.

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:32.680
And that's it!

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:37.600
Put those all together and you have the
completed puzzle that becomes your SPU degree.

00:04:37.659 --> 00:04:41.449
Your degree is a unique combination of
course work beginning to...

00:04:41.449 --> 00:04:46.250
...bringing together core foundational
knowledge, liberal arts education, and the

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:49.009
intense study of a specific discipline.

00:04:49.009 --> 00:04:50.750
Sounds exciting, huh?

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:55.090
To  find out even more info about all of
this, you can read all the fine print in the 

00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:57.500
baccalaureate degree requirements
section

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:58.360
of the online catalog.
