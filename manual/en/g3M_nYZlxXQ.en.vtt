[Siri]Hello everyone.  Thanks for tuning in to this Quick Guide Video from iDevice

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:05.819
Mastery.

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:09.680
Here is your host, Ryan OBarr.

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:12.510
[Ryan] Thank You Siri.  Too kind, too kind.  Like she said,

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:15.800
my name is Ryan OBarr and I run the iDevice Mastery website.

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:20.080
You can find me over at www.iDeviceMastery.com.

00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:23.860
In today's Quick Guide Video Im going to show you just how to setup

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:28.390
iCloud Calendar sharing.  Now this is a great way to keep everyone in the family

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:32.180
up to speed on what's going on throughout the week.  Sharing your calendars

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:35.519
is a no brainer for a busy family with a lot of events going on.

00:00:35.519 --> 00:00:39.690
It's pretty easy to do, and it won't take us but about five minutes to get

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:40.300
through this.

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:46.290
So, without further ado, let's go ahead and get started.

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:49.050
So the first thing we have got to do is head over to iCloud.  You can

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:54.520
Google "iCloud", or just go to iCloud.com.  Once you're there go and sign in with

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:55.510
your credentials.

00:00:55.510 --> 00:01:00.400
And

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:06.100
once inside go ahead and click on the Calendar app.  From inside the Calendar app off to

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:06.830
the left there

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:10.230
you'll see all the Calendars that we share.

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:16.520
The green RSS-looking icon to the right indicates that it's shared.  If it's

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.369
greyed out it means that it's not shared.

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:22.050
So let's go ahead and add ourselves a new calendar by clicking the edit button and then the

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:25.250
"+" next to the calendars.  We'll call this "Test Calendar"

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:29.670
and

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.000
I'm gonna go ahead and add two events.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.990
Just so when they sync up you'll be able to see that they're there.

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.270
We'll call this one "Test

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:43.460
even for test calendar".

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:48.630
Very original.  Go ahead and click OK or

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:52.670
hit enter.  We'll create another one.  Call this one "test event two".

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:55.850
Hit Enter.  Now

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.170
you can see the gray looking RSS icon.

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:03.450
Go ahead and click on that next to our test calendar.  And here it gives you a couple of options.  You've

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:04.960
got the "Private Calendar",

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.070
which is what we're going to do.  Im going to go ahead and enter my wife's email address here.

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:11.560
Now you can add as many people as you want, I think.  I don't know that there are

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.380
limitations on it.

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:18.239
Also you can either allow them to "View &amp; Edit" or "View Only" calendar.

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:22.269
You've also got the option to make it a "Public Calendar", say, if you're a business.

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:27.610
Then click the SHARE button.  And

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:33.180
the person will receive an e-mail with the invitation in it.

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.280
Im going to my iPad here.  Swipe down the multitasking.

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.239
Click on the email that it just sent and click on the

00:02:40.239 --> 00:02:47.239
"Join Calendar" from within the email.  That'll take you over to the iCloud sign in.

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:55.370
Just enter your credentials and that's it.

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:59.319
So we'll open the calendar here and as you can see the

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:02.780
two events that I plugged in are already up here.

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:05.920
We'll go ahead and edit this one

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:12.920
just so I can show you the back and forth on it and how it does sync up.

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.930
And as you can see back in my iCloud

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:23.430
on my Mac, you see that it does say "Edited" in the "Location".

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:27.810
And that's pretty much it.

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:31.290
