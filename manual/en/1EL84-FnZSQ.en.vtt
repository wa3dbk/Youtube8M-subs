00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:10.660
I can't tell you how much fun it is to talk
to kids about their animals.

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:19.560
These are pretty cute, aren't they?

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:25.960
So, Tammy, have any of your rabbits ever gotten
loose?

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:26.960
Yeah.

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.980
Uh oh, what'd you do?

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.199
Well, I had to catch them and put them back
in their pen.

00:00:33.199 --> 00:00:34.730
They weren't too happy about it.

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:36.559
So, tell me about J.D. One here.

00:00:36.559 --> 00:00:38.170
He seems really happy.

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:39.170
What breed is this?

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:40.170
Is this a Palomino?

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:41.170
Yes.

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:42.930
Oh yeah, look at the color.

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:43.930
He's gorgeous.

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:47.480
Why did you choose this breed to raise?

00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.860
Because they're calmer rabbits and they're
a bigger breed of rabbits.

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:53.690
He's very calm.

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:55.870
And they don't scratch as much.

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:56.870
Oh, I see.

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:58.130
So they don't wiggle around on you?

00:00:58.130 --> 00:00:59.130
Yeah.

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:01.610
Some of them can be real wiggle worms, can't
they?

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:02.610
Yeah.

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:04.100
Yeah, he seems very, very calm.

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:05.399
Do you want to hold him?

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:06.399
Yeah.

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:07.540
Okay, there you go.

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:09.270
When is he up for judging?

00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:10.469
He hasn't been up yet, has he?

00:01:10.469 --> 00:01:11.469
No.

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:12.469
Here you go.

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:14.560
Okay, there you go, J.D. One.

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:16.600
What's the biggest prize you've ever won?

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:17.600
Best in Show.

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:18.619
Best in Show?

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:19.619
Was it with a Palomino?

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:21.829
No, it was with a Mini Lop.

00:01:21.829 --> 00:01:23.299
A Mini Lop?

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:25.950
Okay, so you have Mini Lops as well?

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:26.950
Yeah.

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:30.340
The Lops are the ones where the ears hang
down, right?

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:31.340
Yeah.

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:32.340
Yeah.

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:33.340
What kind of rabbit is this one?

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:34.340
It's a Dewlap.

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:35.340
A Dewlap, right.

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.570
A big Dewlap.

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:39.090
These Palominos are beautiful.

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:42.060
Well, thank you for sharing J.D. One with
us.

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:47.329
