00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:14.590
Schizophrenia is a disorder of brain development
and our research tells us there is a genetic

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:16.570
basis to schizophrenia.

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:24.110
So, what we know is if you have an identical
twin who has schizophrenia then your chances

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:29.410
of developing schizophrenia are 50 percent,
so half and half.

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:36.090
If you have a first-degree relative, your
parent or a non-identical sibling who has

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.500
schizophrenia, then your risk is 10 percent.

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:42.930
So, we know that it's an increased risk above
the general population risk if you have a

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:43.930
family member.

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:45.390
That's why we know it's genetic.

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.260
We don't know quite which genes are involved
yet.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:53.360
It's probably multiple genes, but we have
a few genes that we're specifically focusing

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:59.230
on with research to know whether they're involved
in developing schizophrenia and how we might

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:00.489
address that.

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:08.930
So, genes are one thing, but what we know,
too, are the things that affect brain development

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:11.840
will affect your risk of developing schizophrenia.

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:18.600
So, the perinatal period, the pregnancy period
and just after pregnancy and delivery period,

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:26.460
is really an important time of risk for the
fetus or baby to develop the risk for schizophrenia.

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:32.890
So, having low birth weight or bleeding during
pregnancy has been associated with the onset

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:39.450
of schizophrenia, or the risk for schizophrenia.

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.920
In addition, exposure to viruses or toxins
or malnutrition during pregnancy appear to

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.110
be risk factors as well.

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:51.580
So, those probably affect the development
of the brain and lead to the onset of schizophrenia

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:54.780
some 20 or 30 years later.

00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:04.900
There's also a relationship between traumatic
and stressful experiences- abuse and hardships

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:08.019
in a person's life - that lead to the onset
of schizophrenia.

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:14.810
As well, substance use, in particular marijuana
use, among people who have a genetic risk

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:19.980
for schizophrenia has been implicated in leading
to an increased risk.
