00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:03.580
hi I'm Emily Tatuk from the Wilton Test Kitchen

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:07.370
and today I am here to show you how to
make a multiple loop fondant bow

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:11.620
with Wilton's new edible fondant ribbon
let's begin by assembling

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:15.360
all the different components you'll need to
make your bow, first we need to make

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:16.160
some thinned out

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.980
fondant adhesive which will act as our
glue this adhesive

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.859
is very easy to make by mixing a small
amount of the fondant ribbon

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:28.039
with a few drops of water in a
microwave-safe bowl, microwave the mixture

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:32.739
at fifty percent power for five to ten
seconds the fondant will dissolve in the

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:33.160
water

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:37.280
and create a brushable edible adhesive with a similar consistency of

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:38.120
elmer's glue

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.950
next you'll want to cut out to small disks
out of the fondant ribbon

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:46.450
these will act as the base for each
layer of your bow so you're going to take a small

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:47.989
amount the fondant ribbon

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:51.059
and roll it to about an eighth of an inch thickness
just like this

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.739
I'm going to take my two inch cutters
and my one and a half inch cutters

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.579
and just cut circles out of the thin fondant

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:04.309
ribbon these we'll just place to the side and let them dry completely

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:07.380
now you'll want to create a loop for
your bow

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:11.400
unroll the fondant ribbon and cut 12
to 14

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.729
6 inch strips the number and size of your strips

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:19.159
will be dependent on your bow sides
using a brush, brush a small amount of

00:01:19.159 --> 00:01:19.720
adhesive

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:23.689
on both edges of the fondant ribbon, attach the
two ends together

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:28.040
by gently folding the ribbon over and
pinching firmly to create a strong bond

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:31.790
roll a small amount of paper towel into a tube

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:36.189
and slide it into a loop this helps
support the loop while it dries

00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:39.880
stand the loop on its side and place it on
a cake board

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:44.560
repeat this process with the remaining fondant strips, the fonant loops will have to

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:45.649
drive for a minimum

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:49.630
of eight hours so it's best to do them the
night before once the loop

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:53.259
and disks are completely dry you're ready to
start building your bow

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:56.579
place the large fondant disk on a cake
board

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:01.460
position 6-7 loops in a circle to form
the base of the bow

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.829
for the best fit trim the edges of your loops so they can fit together as

00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:07.229
close as possible

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:11.830
attach each loop to the base with a
small amount of fondant adhesive

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:16.530
continue building the bow, filling in
the center with the rest of the fondant loops

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:21.600
adhering each loop with a small amount
of fondant adhesive

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:25.290
once all your loops are in place let your bow
dry for a minimum of

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:28.350
eight hours once the bow is completely dry

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:32.190
it is ready to be placed on top of
your cake looking to create a bow with a

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:33.640
different width or collar
