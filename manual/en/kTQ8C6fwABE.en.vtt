00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:04.290
Yeah!!!!  Something to do with books?

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:11.290
 

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:12.860
When I read books, like um...

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:17.869
I try to visualise it, like I'm really in the world.
I like adventure books.

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:20.349
My favourite books are fantasy.

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:27.349
And I can just read forever.
We want the library to have a wow factor.

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:33.120
It looks chaotic in here at times,

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.880
that's because we have lots of kids in here

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:40.330
and sometimes we have two or three classes in at the same time.

00:00:40.330 --> 00:00:45.630
Probably not everybody could manage that.

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:50.440
It's probably the fact that...I'm really clear about the learning that needs to go on.

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.550
Here reading and information seeking is a very

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:55.430
collaborative and sharing activity.

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:59.630
We want kids to know it's a place where you can talk and discuss and be really happy.

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:04.540
Our school librarian, she is a really good teacher, she's really knowledgeable.

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:09.050
When you come here she will give us tips.

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:16.050
I just get the biggest buzz out of kids coming and talking to me about reading.

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:22.009
We have a secret book club...that was huge in making the library come alive.

00:01:22.009 --> 00:01:22.770
 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.049
We started small, that's why we called it a secret, 'cause everybody wants to know the secret.

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:27.790
They have to know

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:28.770
the password

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:30.520
which is

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:32.490
'Can I join the book club please?'

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:38.390
From that our issues went up exponentially!

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:42.440
We do a lot of inquiry skills and it's a lot of research,

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:45.079
so they use the library as a foundation for researching.

00:01:45.079 --> 00:01:49.490
When we're doing things like Maths or Inquiry or Reading

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:54.560
I send kids over to the library.

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:56.010
Part of it for me is the collaboration, um...

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:58.240
where I can collaborate with teachers

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.640
and talk to them about what's happening in their classrooms.

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.429
I think that the library has a great connection between classroom

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:10.110
literacy programs. That for me is really important important that I know that

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.090
what we're doing here is impacting on

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.649
the classroom programme.

00:02:13.649 --> 00:02:17.909
Our librarian are highly qualified, a highly experienced teacher

00:02:17.909 --> 00:02:19.130
and is also in the management team.

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:20.669
So, the library can't miss out.

00:02:20.669 --> 00:02:24.489
She's always keen to help students individually, in groups

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:26.289
and us as a whole class.

00:02:26.289 --> 00:02:29.499
She like makes it fun for reading

00:02:29.499 --> 00:02:31.689
instead of boring.

00:02:31.689 --> 00:02:36.660
Whenever I come to the library I always enjoy it every time. I make the most of it and

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.259
to have Miss Mes here, she's just the best librarian I've ever had.

00:02:38.259 --> 00:02:41.540
If your stuck on a test or something like that you just come straight here and

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:46.610
research, research until you find the answer. This is what I love about this place.

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:50.940
I like to connect with the students, from where they're at,

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:56.380
and further develop their critical thinking and

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:03.380
inquiry skills.

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:08.439
(laughter)..That's fantastic, right let's go and see what's happening over here.

00:03:08.439 --> 00:03:12.290
It's a space were kids can actually come and

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:16.619
research and use the technology which will help with their learning.

00:03:16.619 --> 00:03:19.109
I actually make it my business to find out about stuff.

00:03:19.109 --> 00:03:21.489
Me being a trained teacher

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:26.259
and being based in the library full time is what makes this library

00:03:26.259 --> 00:03:28.499
the special place that it is.

00:03:28.499 --> 00:03:29.989
The kids come and go for 'Just in Time' learning.

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:31.859
They know they can come in to choose a book,

00:03:31.859 --> 00:03:35.479
I'll help them with choice.

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:38.629
They love talking about books with us.

00:03:38.629 --> 00:03:41.339
I've issued about

00:03:41.339 --> 00:03:43.999
183 books this year,

00:03:43.999 --> 00:03:47.969
and I'm hoping to read more interesting books, like um...

00:03:47.969 --> 00:03:49.689
more challenging books to move up

00:03:49.689 --> 00:03:51.349
in my reading age.

00:03:51.349 --> 00:03:53.529
It's just like a learning center for me

00:03:53.529 --> 00:03:57.249
and when I read a book my mind is transformed.

00:03:57.249 --> 00:03:59.769
I have kids turn up rushing in the door, their five year olds, and their going

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:03.229
"We've just read a book

00:04:03.229 --> 00:04:04.340
about animals that live under the ground...

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:07.179
Can you please give us some books"

00:04:07.179 --> 00:04:08.809
Kids can read books

00:04:08.809 --> 00:04:09.659
and

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:15.379
jump on technology and look up, so to further their researching skills.

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:18.119
So it's not just from one source, but they can make links.

00:04:18.119 --> 00:04:24.260
The teachers that link into the library

00:04:24.260 --> 00:04:27.050
and use the library lots, I believe have better outcomes for their students.

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:32.229
Those students in those classes are library users.

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:33.580
I love coming to the library

00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:35.099
because I learn heaps

00:04:35.099 --> 00:04:36.840
and I gain more knowledge

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:43.840
and I take the knowledge I gain here to my own classroom or at home.

00:04:47.819 --> 00:04:49.160
(laughter)

00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:52.299
She's a really good teacher to us.

00:04:52.299 --> 00:04:53.299
Yeah!
