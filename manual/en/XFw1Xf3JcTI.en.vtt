00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:04.350
"Alright JR." "Okay." "Now your skin's nice
and clean and it's ready for extractions."

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.060
"Okay." "Okay." "I'm ready! Is it going to
be painful?" "I'm going to try and make it

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:12.879
as least painful as possible." "Okay! Let's
do it!" "Okay. What I'm going to do is I'm

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:16.580
going to take two pieces of cotton, they're
large cotton, going to wrap them around my

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:22.560
fingers. Okay?" "Okay." "And I'm just going
to gently..." "OKay." "...just squeeze right

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:28.790
in here." "OKay." "Now is that painful?" "Nope."
"That's about as painful as it gets." "OKay."

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:35.039
"Alright. And what this is doing is this is
cleaning the skin, cleaning out all the pores.

00:00:35.039 --> 00:00:43.999
Alright. So this is going to clean the skin,
clean out the pores. And you can see that,

00:00:43.999 --> 00:00:49.179
yeah, those are a few black heads right over
here." "Okay." "Okay." "And now, what are

00:00:49.179 --> 00:00:58.710
blackheads?" "Blackheads are oxidized white
heads. So, basically, when oxygen hits, goes

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:07.330
underneath the pore, and reaches the whitehead
it turns dark." "Okay." "Okay? So I have a

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:14.020
little tool here and this is, maybe, just
a little uncomfortable." "Actually, not bad."

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:18.980
"That's not bad is it?" "No" "But what this
is going to do...." "Eyebrow waxing hurts

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:24.210
more than this." "Oh. Okay." "Yeah, so this
isn't bad." "Yeah. Everyone's different. When

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:32.710
I have this done I'm cringing the whole time.
But, that's just me. But you're doing good.

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:40.260
And, see, what this is doing? This is just
cleaning out all the pores that have oxidized

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:46.480
white head in there. Okay, so it looks like
we got everything cleaned out there. Your

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:51.560
nose looks good." "Okay, now under there I
see a lot. Is that still whiteheads or is

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:57.740
that dry skin?" "These are whiteheads." "Okay."
"And on girls this is, this is a girl's hormonal

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:03.030
zone. And this is where most girls are going
to break out. And usually, what happens, they

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:09.009
get it in the same place." "Exactly." "Alright.
Maybe here, here, over here, a lot of times

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:14.599
they get a line of them right down here. They
go away and they come back. What you want

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:21.420
to do is use something on there that's going
to be an anti-inflammatory. I have a product

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:25.670
called 'Big Night Blemish Buster'. And that's
really nice. It has some salacilic acid in

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:31.060
there which is going to exfoliate the area.
And also green tea and nice calming ingredients,

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:38.239
like asaline which is going to help to take
the redness down, calm the skin, but also

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:42.720
be strong enough to kill the bacteria and
help it to go away." "Okay. I couldn't imagine

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.400
doing this at home. I know you can do it at
home, but, it's so much better to have somebody

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.430
else do it." "They say it's always better
to have someone else clean your skin, but,

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:56.389
like you know you can do it. You can do it
at home as long as the skin is clean, prepped,

00:02:56.389 --> 00:03:02.769
softened up, and ready for extractions. And,
it looks like your skin's good."
