00:00:00.299 --> 00:00:02.760
Hi guys, and welcome back to hair with Hollie
on Beauty Base.

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:07.160
Today 'm going to show you how to do a more
wearable version of the classic Lana Del Ray

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:11.860
beehive.

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:21.270
Ta da.

00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:25.019
So this look is all about sectioning, so once
you get your sections in place, the rest of

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:26.089
the look will follow.

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:32.969
So we're just going to section off the hair,
working from about the ear, and just behind

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:40.280
the ear, all the way around until the other
side.

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:52.329
We're going to work from ear to ear, going
across the crown, and again splitting this

00:00:52.329 --> 00:01:01.129
section into two.

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:05.340
So from ear to ear across the top of the head
you should have two sections, one slightly

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:06.340
bigger.

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:14.690
Now we're going to do one more section, working
from just behind the ear, again across the

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:19.670
top of the head, so a section about two inch
wide.

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:26.050
And we'll section that off again.

00:01:26.050 --> 00:01:31.280
And then any remaining hair you have after
this you can add to the lower part of the

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:32.280
hair.

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.490
So this is going to make up the kind of cascading
wave style.

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.410
Now as you know, Lana Del Ray's hair is usually
quite big, so it's quite an impressive beehive,

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:44.140
so that's why we're working with two sections,
to create that volume.

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:52.070
So the back section, we're going to prep this
with a bit of texturizing dust.

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:56.320
This is a great idea if you do have thinner
hair or hair that's just been washed and has

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:57.770
no grip.

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:05.390
So working with this, I'm going to backcomb
from about an inch or two from the root all

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:08.050
the way back to the hair.

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:11.150
And remember to work all around the sides
as well.

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:12.720
Very important.

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.700
This little section's going to be the foundation
of the style, so it's where we're going to

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.020
get the most height from.

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:23.090
So again, I'm going to prep this with a bit
of texturizing dust.

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:26.550
It just makes the whole look a bit easier
to achieve and you don't have to backcomb

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:27.970
as much either.

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:32.780
So with this part, we're going to backcomb
through the entire length of the hair, so

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:34.560
all the way to the tip.

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.950
And don't forget to work around the side sections
as well.

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:42.090
This is where you can really get creative
with your style, and you can build as much

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:46.390
volume as you want into this section, as it's
going to be covered with the smoother section

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:51.360
here, which is brilliant especially if you
have lighter, fair hair where the knots are

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:53.660
quite visible, so don't worry.

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:57.760
So keep working until the hair is quite matted
and can nearly stand up on its own.

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:00.380
It's kind of like those little trolls.

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:04.740
And then what we're going to do, this is the
important part.

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:13.590
Grab the hair and we're going to roll it back
like a sausage and pin it directly on top

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:14.790
of the head.

00:03:14.790 --> 00:03:21.460
Don't forget to fan out your sausage shape
so you get quite a well rounded finish.

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:26.110
So again, no need to worry if this is looking
quite messy because that's why we have the

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:29.450
hair at the front, to cover all these knots.

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:34.100
So with this you can go as big as you want,
so if you want it more dramatic, pull it closer

00:03:34.100 --> 00:03:35.350
to the hairline.

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:38.140
If you want it more subtle, pull it down a
bit from the crown.

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:40.070
You know, whatever you want.

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:46.740
Now we're going to secure that with a little
bit of hairspray.

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:51.430
Just makes it a bit sticky as well and helps
the hair to stick properly.

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:56.060
So with the final part of our style, we're
taking the fresh hair directly from the hairline,

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:01.980
going to pop a little dust in there as well,
and then very gently I'm just going to backcomb

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:08.940
about an inch or so of the root, just to give
it a little bit of lift.So again, if you do

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:13.569
have fair hair, just be careful because the
knots can become quite visible through the

00:04:13.569 --> 00:04:14.569
hair.

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:18.479
Once you're happy that the hair stands up
a little bit away from the hairline, just

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:24.930
simply brush it back over your style, doing
your best to cover any knots that you've created,

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:27.930
and then start pinning in place.

00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:38.770
So keep working this top section of hair back
towards the back of the head, and then pin

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:39.860
in place.

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:49.060
So it's a good idea to pop in some hair extensions
if you have them, for both length and volume,

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:53.669
just to kind of counteract the dramatic look
of the beehive, but if not, no worries.

00:04:53.669 --> 00:04:56.479
So what we're going to do with the remaining
hair, we're just going to put a slight wave

00:04:56.479 --> 00:04:57.479
in it.

00:04:57.479 --> 00:05:01.699
I'm just going to prep the hair with a little
bit of moose, just to give it a bit of grip.

00:05:01.699 --> 00:05:06.370
It's a nice idea, if you have any visible
clips as well, just to take a small section

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:16.600
of hair 
and weave it round.

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:23.449
There, you can create a little feature that
covers the hair clips.

00:05:23.449 --> 00:05:30.889
Or you can even pop in a nice piece of hair
jewelry here, or some flowers.

00:05:30.889 --> 00:05:36.129
Okay, so grabbing your wand, or your curling
tongs or your straightener or whatever you

00:05:36.129 --> 00:05:40.370
have, just start putting loose curls in the
hair.

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:46.099
So working from the upper sections all the
way down, and holding the hair in place for

00:05:46.099 --> 00:05:53.759
about ten seconds or until you can feel the
heat coming through.

00:05:53.759 --> 00:05:55.270
And release.

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:58.270
And just keep going until you've used up all
the hair.

00:05:58.270 --> 00:06:03.550
Once you're happy with the curls and the position
of the beehive, just finish off the look with

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:10.330
a good bit of hairspray, and smooth away any
flyaways you have around the hairline as well.

00:06:10.330 --> 00:06:16.509
So there you have it guys, a gorgeous Lana
Del Ray beehive which is perfect for everyday

00:06:16.509 --> 00:06:17.839
wear and special occasion too.

00:06:17.839 --> 00:06:21.830
