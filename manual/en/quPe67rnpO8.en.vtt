00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.140
Hi, I'm Melissa Powell with Expert Village.
And right now we're going to be going over

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:10.360
the basics of Texas Holdem. Texas Holdem poker
deals with a typical 52 card deck. And its

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:15.040
a gambling game as I'm sure you know. And
it can be from two to ten players. So in our

00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:21.130
examples today, we'll have five players doing
the game. So we're going to start with the

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:24.750
dealer button. This is the position of power,
and we'll go over all the details as to why

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:30.180
it is later. But the dealer will always start
with first, going over who gets the dealer

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:36.041
button. So if I have five players, I deal
five cards face up to my five players to determine

00:00:36.041 --> 00:00:41.239
who gets the button. The highest value card,
the Jack in this case, will be the dealer

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:50.589
button. I continue on the two to the right
of the dealer, the players left, are what

00:00:50.589 --> 00:00:55.449
are called the big and small blinds. Now it?s
important to note that in each hand, there

00:00:55.449 --> 00:01:02.429
will be forced bets. These two players will
be the forced bets in the hand. As we continue

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:09.329
in every single hand the button will move.
And accordingly, the players to their left

00:01:09.329 --> 00:01:14.969
will have to be the forced blinds. Let?s make
it in this case one and two. So this will

00:01:14.969 --> 00:01:20.759
be the small blind. And this will be the big
blind. You have one coin here, and two chips

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:29.320
here. So that would be the equivalent of the
big and small blind. Continuing on, we start

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:38.969
the shuffling of the game. I would deal two
cards to each player. Each player has two

00:01:38.969 --> 00:01:45.050
cards. Everyone looks at their cards and determines
what they have. We continue on without looking

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:49.680
at their cards and getting specifically into
what a fold and all of those things are, we'll

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.990
just go strait to the flop, the turn and the
river. As the dealer, let?s say that everybody

00:01:53.990 --> 00:02:00.450
has made a bet. They've all agreed to put
in two chips. And that's called, everyone

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:05.840
around has made the same bet. They've all
checked. As the dealer I tap the table. Pick

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:15.770
up all the chips. And now we're ready to continue.
I burn the first card. That's just to ensure

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:20.220
there's no cheating, nothings going on. There's
no funny business. I put that under the chips,

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:24.550
and I deal the first three cards face down.
