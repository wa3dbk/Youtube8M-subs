00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.780
Welcome to this week’s Movie Math, where
it was Dreamworks Animation’s turn for box

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:05.780
office fairy-tale.

00:00:05.780 --> 00:00:10.760
Yes, it was as if Helena Bonham Carter herself
appeared and turned Dreamworks Animation’s

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:15.000
tattered dress - the much delayed Home - into
a real show-stopper!

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:22.169
Home is the biggest debut for Dreamworks Animation
since 2012’s Madagascar 3, and their biggest

00:00:22.169 --> 00:00:29.550
debut for an original film - aka non-sequel
- since Monsters vs Aliens way back in 2009.

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:34.090
Now of course, back then Monsters vs Aliens
was actually considered a poor box office

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:38.560
performer for Dreamworks Animation, and the
sequel-happy studio never made any for the

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:39.560
Reese Witherspoon-starrer.

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:42.770
But what a difference a few years make!

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:47.080
Some of you have wondered just how bad things
really are for Dreamworks Animation - so let

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:49.180
me paint you a picture.

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:53.400
Earlier this year, the studio revealed a two
hundred and forty-seven POINT seven million

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:59.480
loss in their 2014 fourth quarter alone, which
led to another round of layoffs - this time

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:04.260
five hundred jobs - and the closing of one
of its bases in Northern California.

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:08.090
Dreamworks Animation has also dialed down
production, going from three releases a year

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:13.500
to two, and recently pushed back two hotly
anticipated films - Kung Fu Panda 3 and How

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:14.960
to Train Your Dragon 3.

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:20.759
That’s after Dragon 2 lost out on the coveted
Best Animation Oscar to Big Hero 6.

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:25.789
And BOO Bureau of Otherworldly Operations
has been put back in development while several

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:31.009
key people at the studio were replaced, including
Chief Creative Officer Bill Damaschke who

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:32.710
voluntarily stepped down.

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:37.420
To illustrate how important that position
is, it’s the job John Lasseter has over

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:39.679
at Disney Animation and Pixar.

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:43.280
Of course, this has all led to Dreamworks
Animation taking a beating on Wall Street,

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.970
not just in terms of its stock but the constant
stream of headlines as Wall Street analysts

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:51.460
keep evaluating the studio’s bleak future.

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:55.049
Dreamworks Animation had sought to get off
the Wall Street rollercoaster by going private,

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:58.810
but couldn’t convince anyone to buy the
studio.

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:03.110
Hasbro almost took the leap, yet as we’ve
discussed before rival Disney killed that

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:07.119
deal by alerting Hasbro it would lead to a
loss of all their Disney toy licenses...

00:02:07.119 --> 00:02:12.250
So, does a boffo first weekend for Home turn
everything around?

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:15.580
Of course not, but it does buy Dreamworks
Animation some time.

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:22.270
And Kung Fu Panda 3 up next for the studio
in March 2016, that could create some positive

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:27.300
momentum for the studio - which could benefit
their next original flick, Trolls, in November

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:28.300
2016.

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:33.060
But perhaps even better news to come out of
Home’s success is that after The Karate

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:37.310
Kid back in 2010, this is another win for
diverse family entertainment.

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:41.560
In fact, Home has debuted on par with that
remake!

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.590
Plus luckily Home will have no real competition
in the family market until Pixar’s Inside

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:50.210
Out in mid-June, then again Marvel has been
known to be uber kid-friendly.

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:55.090
And here’s something encouraging - while
films with non-white leads tend to usually

00:02:55.090 --> 00:03:00.110
appeal mostly to non-white audiences, that
was not the case with Home.

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:04.900
Forty-eight percent of the audience was caucasian,
twenty-two percent african-american, fifteen

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.810
percent hispanic and another fifteen percent
asian.

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:12.610
And while Home was another movie to score
with the female demographic - sixty percent

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:18.180
- it also flew in the face of recent trends
by appealing largely to kids!

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:23.120
Fifty-seven percent of Home’s audience was
under twenty-five, making it an animated hit

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:25.040
that DOESN’T rely on adults.

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.740
How strange...

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:30.260
So, what DID adults go to see?

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:34.570
That would be Get Hard, which came in second
for the weekend with around thirty-four million.

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:39.160
While it would’ve been nice for Will Ferrell
and Kevin Hart to open in first place, the

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:43.290
two comedians still earned a debut better
than their other recent entries.

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:48.540
This is Ferrell’s biggest opening since
The Other Guys in 2010, and for Hart since

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.440
Ride Along last year.

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:55.790
It’s also worth noting that those two films
were rating PG-13 while Get Hard has an R

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:56.790
rating...

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:02.490
Will this second place finish, losing to a
PG movie, finally end Hollywood’s 2015 destructive

00:04:02.490 --> 00:04:04.930
love affair with the R rating?!

00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:09.900
But one movie to benefit from a depreciated
box office thanks to all these R ratings is

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.690
another R-rated movie, It Follows.

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:17.030
With over half the box office coming in at
under five million a film, that allowed It

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:21.470
Follows to capture the number five spot as
it went semi-wide this weekend.

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:25.560
Expanding to a little over twelve hundred
theaters, the indie horror flick nabbed four

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:28.130
million in its third week of release.

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:32.680
This is fantastic news for newbie writer-director
David Robert Mitchell, as well as lead actress

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:33.730
Maika Monroe.

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:38.540
Don’t be surprised to see both sign exciting
new deals in the next week or so, plus this

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:42.790
shows that while exciting things are happening
with low-budget sci-fi, horror is still the

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:45.850
best genre in which to jump start your career.

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:49.930
Elsewhere in the box office, Insurgent dropped
a little under sixty percent in its second

00:04:49.930 --> 00:04:53.990
weekend - a few more points than Divergent
dropped in its second weekend.

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:59.310
In contrast, fellow femme-oriented pic Cinderella
was able to once again keep its drop under

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:04.380
fifty percent in its third week of release
- but delivered even better news worldwide

00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:09.410
where it was able to climb to second place
for the year to date, overtaking Taken 3 as

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:11.650
did Kingsman The Secret Service.

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:16.330
Kingsman also continues to hold steady domestically,
falling just a little over thirty percent

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:21.460
in its SEVENTH weekend, while The Second Best
Marigold Hotel demonstrated the other best

00:05:21.460 --> 00:05:24.300
hold for the weekend - also in the thirtieth
percentile.

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:28.600
Then over in the specialty market, it looks
like Jennifer Lawrence’s team successfully

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:34.450
killed Serena - as audiences took little notice
of the 2012 film as it finally opened in sixty

00:05:34.450 --> 00:05:35.780
theaters.

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:39.570
In addition to Lawrence and Bradley Cooper
refusing to promote the film, it’s also

00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:45.770
been available online for weeks - where it’s
so far pulled in ONE MILLION DOLLARS.

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:50.720
And yes, as Dr Evil himself discovers, these
days that’s a ridiculously low number.

00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:55.850
As for this coming weekend, Furious 7 looks
to post a ridiculously high number with the

00:05:55.850 --> 00:06:00.320
biggest debut for the franchise yet - an even
bigger opening than Captain America The Winter

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:02.360
Soldier at the beginning of April last year.

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:06.590
As you might recall, it was super hard for
movies last year to open with more than one

00:06:06.590 --> 00:06:07.650
hundred million.

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:13.280
In fact, only Mockingjay Part 1 and Transformers
were able to do so, with many studios claiming

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:16.050
the Transformers numbers were fudged...

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:19.020
Will 2015 be a different story?

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:20.449
And that’s the weekend box office.

00:06:20.449 --> 00:06:24.580
I’m Grace Randolph and we just did some
Movie Math - as always, thanks for watching,

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:39.300
and I hope you’ll go Beyond The Trailer
for these other top movies...
