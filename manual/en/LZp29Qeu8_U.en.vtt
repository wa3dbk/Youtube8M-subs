00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:09.620
What's up everybody, welcome back to my laboratory, where safety is number one priority.

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:17.520
And today I've got this bubbely drink, soda drinks, you know. It's very carbonated, very sweet and very tasty.

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:21.040
Especially when you're a kid you love one of these, right?

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:30.620
But, lets check out how much sugar is actually in this thing, it says 55 grams, you know, from around that

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:35.280
but what is it actually, how much is there? Is there a lot? Is it not much?

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.820
How about we gonna boil this thing out and see what is actually going to happen

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:46.980
because when you boil out the water, nothing stays after you boil it out.

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:54.300
But if there is a bunch of sugar left, we will actually see how much sugar there is left over in one of these.

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:55.800
Well lets get to it!

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:58.560
Then we're going to open one of these.

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:03.280
Oh shit, I shouldn't have shaken it up.

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:04.540
But oh well.

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:09.780
And... Grab it like that and pour it in there.

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:15.300
Just one of these, we're going to wait until it boils out

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:16.860
and see what happens.

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:24.340
As you can see it's starting to get boiled. We're gonna have to wait until it boils out

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:26.220
so we're going to wait a while.

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:30.440
Slowly boiling out, so hopefully it boils out soon.

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.200
As you can see it's almost done.

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:37.200
The 'bucket' is a lot dirtier now.

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:41.340
But, we'll see when it's all the way boiled out.

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.220
So, this is so much sugar from one little bottle of soda.

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:47.660
You know what I mean?

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.500
It's insane. Look how m... look how black it is.

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.120
It's got to be sugar

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:56.040
and all these other chemicals and stuff.

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:57.200
But...

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.900
So every time you drink a little bit of soda

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:07.800
you pretty much eat all that sugar and all the stuff, whatever inside of it.

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:11.380
So I put it away from the fire and look at this stuff...

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:15.020
This is stayed up sugar, look at this.

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:18.980
It's burned, but this is so much crap!

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.280
It's just from one little can, imagine...

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:27.660
So next time you want to drink soda, think of this video

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:34.140
and, you know, this is how much sugar and all that kind of stuff you actually drink,

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:38.760
every time you drink one little bottle - like that - of soda.

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:42.620
But, imagine if you drink a two liter bottle.

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:43.980
Well, why imagine?

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:49.120
Let's just boil it and see how much junk
is going to be in there.

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:56.080
So each bottle contains 500 milliliters

00:02:56.080 --> 00:03:01.620
so, two of them is a thousand milliliters
and a thousand milliliters is a liter.

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.420
So,  if we got four of these, that's two liters

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.560
as you can see full of this.

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:13.980
And now we're going to wait until it boils out and see how much sugar we're going to be left with.

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:18.500
Ok, as you can see it has been boiled out 'a lot'

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:25.040
and we still have to wait another 10 to 20 minutes
and we'll see what happens.

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:32.440
Ok, we're going to mix it it up, and you see... Now it's boiling so weird because it's so thick.

00:03:33.460 --> 00:03:39.140
So... We're going to give it a little bit time,
until it's going to get even darker

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:46.420
Do you see how much it's smoking because the sugar is burning? And do you see how much sugar there is?

00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:49.260
Oh oh, it looks like i overcooked it.

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:50.200
Shit.

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:51.340
But...

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:54.580
You know, this is why you gotta be careful.

00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:58.980
This is what happens when you overcook the sugar.

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:04.520
Look how much shit is in there,
look how much sugar in there.

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:08.340
Isn't it crazy?
Of course it's burned sugar.

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:16.200
so this is how much sugar is left over in a soda drink,
in a two liter soda drink, soft drink.

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.760
They have a bunch of sugar in there

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:23.840
so if you boil it, you see much burned out sugar is left.

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:27.240
and it's a lot, and if you drink it

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.800
that amount every day, two liters

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.480
it's really bad for you.

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:33.400
So, that's a cool experiment.

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:35.020
So, next time you actually know

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:37.660
how much sugar you are going to drink.

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:39.440
So, it's for you to decide.

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:46.220
Either you want to drink it and you don't care,
or drink or not drink it because it's healthier.

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:47.920
Alright guys, that's pretty much it.
