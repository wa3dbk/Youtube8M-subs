00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:05.900
How to Shave Your Face.

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:10.380
Should you skip shaving and save yourself
from potential razor burn, or should you get

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.250
a nice close shave and save a loved one from
certain whisker burn?

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:18.630
Learn to shave correctly, and you'll solve
this burning question to everyone's satisfaction.

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:29.570
You will need Warm water A razor Shaving cream
A mirror A sink or basin Cool water And a

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:36.649
towel The aftershave lotion or moisturizer
or your choice A washcloth (optional) (optional)

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:39.100
Styptic pencil (optional) (optional) and some
tissue or toilet paper (optional) (optional).

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:40.100
Step 1.

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:41.100
Shave the remaining areas above and below
your lips.

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:42.100
For a closer shave, contort your mouth as
needed.

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:43.100
Step 2.

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.550
Fill your sink or basin halfway with warm
water.

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:46.550
Step 3.

00:00:46.550 --> 00:00:50.350
Wet a washcloth with the warm water and hold
it to your face for a few minutes to soften

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:53.770
the hair and open up your skin's pores.

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:57.450
If you don't have a few minutes to spare,
just wet your face directly with warm water.

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:59.110
It's better than nothing.

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:00.110
Step 4.

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:02.170
Check to see if the blade on your razor is
fresh.

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:04.110
If not, replace it.

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:08.410
Shaving with a dull blade increases your chances
of cutting yourself.

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:09.410
Step 5.

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:13.259
Squirt a small amount of shaving cream into
your palm and, using the fingers of your other

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:16.010
hand, spread it evenly over your stubble.

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:18.890
Watch what you're doing in the mirror.

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:19.890
Step 6.

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.329
Concentrating on one side of your face, start
near your sideburns and slowly drag the razor

00:01:24.329 --> 00:01:27.220
downward in the direction your facial hair
grows.

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:31.440
Use light but firm pressure.

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:35.350
Shaving against the natural direction of your
facial hair can cause razor burn and ingrown

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:36.350
hairs.

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:38.440
Step 7.

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:41.909
After every few strokes, rinse off your blade
in the sink to keep it from getting clogged

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.070
with hair.

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:46.990
Continue shaving, and when you've finished
one side from your ear to your jaw line, move

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:49.420
to the other side of your face.

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:50.590
Step 8.

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:55.020
When you've finished both sides, tackle the
trickier spotsâ€”your chin and neck.

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:59.280
Shave more slowly and carefully in these areas,
stretching your skin with one hand while shaving

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.649
with the other.

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:06.040
If you cut yourself, use a styptic pencil
to stop the bleeding.

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:11.180
If you don't have one, press a small piece
of tissue or toilet paper onto the cut.

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:15.950
Step 9.

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:24.470
Check to see if you missed any spots on your
face, especially just under your jaw line.

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:26.480
If so, go back and shave them.

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.040
You may want to reapply some shaving cream.

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:31.090
Step 10.

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:34.890
Rinse your face with cool water and remove
any remaining shaving cream, then pat your

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:37.350
face dry with a towel.

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:38.360
Step 11.

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:43.100
Apply aftershave or moisturizer to revitalize
your traumatized skin.

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:45.250
Now go get 'em, handsome!

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:51.140
Did you know Some cave paintings depict ancient
man removing facial hair by using two seashells

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:52.950
as tweezers.
