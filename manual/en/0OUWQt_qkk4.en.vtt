00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:09.180
Now you want to measure some elastic to fit
the child and place the elastic right behind

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:17.850
the mask here and we're going to staple it
from the front going through the elastic to

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:25.000
the back and then you want to make sure that
it was secure and use a little bit of soft

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:32.050
tape to cover up the staples so that you won't
so the staple won't be scratching the person

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:37.010
who's wearing the mask. So electrical tape
is good, it comes in a lot of different colors

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:44.629
and it sticks well and that's a nice soft
way to finish that off and it won't show from

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:57.940
the front. And then do the same on the other
side

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:10.090
making sure that its secure. It didn't go
through. And you can trim off any excess,

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:20.529
put another piece of tape over anything that's
going to be scratchy. And then to finish off

00:01:20.529 --> 00:01:31.049
our chickadee mask, we're going to put a good
strip of glue here. Nice and thick. And I've

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:39.499
cut a little bit of yellow boa just to cover
the top and you want to glue that down nicely.

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:46.710
So what's nice about this mask, is that it
doesn't cover the child's nose or mouth, it

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:53.009
leaves everything clear for breathing. The
fun foam is very soft and the decoration being

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:57.920
up on the forehead stays out of the child's
line of vision.
