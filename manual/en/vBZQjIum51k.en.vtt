00:00:01.430 --> 00:00:29.850
I 

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:31.570
know what you’re thinking, and yes.

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:35.180
Paper used to come attached to each other,
that’s how we made paper.

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:39.350
We used to human centipede the sh*t out of
trees, and no one felt bad about it.

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:43.710
The world was a terrifying place during this
particular period in history, it’s Super

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:44.710
R.C.

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:58.450
Pro-Am, for the Game Boy.

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:00.559
So obviously, the “R.C.” stands for “real
criminals.”

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:04.589
And if you had any doubts or don’t care
about trees, well, check this out.

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:05.680
You goddamn tree-ist.

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.310
Or maybe you don’t care about racers, either.

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:09.670
Freaking race-ist.

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:13.150
Murder and death are the name of the game,
in Super R.C.

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:15.030
Pro-Am, for the Game Boy.

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.570
Actually, the name’s Super R.C.

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:18.570
Pro-Am.

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.060
This is a sequel to the NES game, R.C.

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.060
Pro-Am.

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:23.740
This is like that one, only super.

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:28.110
And yes, you could have games called “super”
on systems other than the Super Nintendo.

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:29.110
That was okay.

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:30.680
Now, if they made R.C.

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:32.939
Pro-Am 64 for the PlayStation…

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:36.470
Actually, no one would’ve cared about that,
either.

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:40.920
I mean, look what they were doing to trees
back then.

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:50.240
So this game was released in 1991, still a
few years before its developer would release

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.000
its breakthrough hit in a little game called
Donkey Kong Country.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.460
But that’s the thing, even though Rare didn’t
really become a huge name until that game…they’d

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:01.659
been putting good games on Nintendo systems
for years.

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:04.390
Marble Madness, Cobra Triangle, Battletoads…

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:07.080
And of course, Super R.C.

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:08.080
Pro-Am.

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:13.430
The game can be frustrating, as a lot of Rare’s
games tended to be, f*ck you, Battletoads…but

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:16.220
it’s still an excellent little racer for
the Game Boy.

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:24.309
Who puts a ramp in a tunnel?

00:02:24.309 --> 00:02:29.250
So it’s one of those old-school kind of
top-down isometric racers, which is awesome,

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.099
but the whole gimmick is the steering.

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:35.529
I mean, everything else is pretty straightforward,
but the game’s most distinguishing feature

00:02:35.529 --> 00:02:37.620
is definitely the actual driving.

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.519
See, racing in Super R.C.

00:02:39.519 --> 00:02:41.849
Pro-Am’s kind of like racing on a Slip ’n
Slide.

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:43.939
And a Slip ’n Slide covered in soap, too.

00:02:43.939 --> 00:02:47.560
Like, you jump on, you end up in the neighbor’s
yard.

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.169
That kind of Slip ’n Slide.

00:02:49.169 --> 00:02:51.159
So there’s definitely a learning curve.

00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:53.169
To…taking curves.

00:02:53.169 --> 00:02:56.870
I’d like to take some heads, after this
sh*t.

00:02:56.870 --> 00:03:00.250
Hey, speaking of which, you can kill your
opponents in this game.

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:02.139
There are weapons all over the place.

00:03:02.139 --> 00:03:06.069
Only problem is, there are apparently voodoo
priests all over the place, too, because your

00:03:06.069 --> 00:03:08.799
opponents resurrect themselves almost instantly.

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:12.779
Blowing them up basically just gives you a
chance to pass them real quick, and that’s

00:03:12.779 --> 00:03:13.779
it.

00:03:13.779 --> 00:03:15.689
Make one mistake, and they’re right back
on your ass.

00:03:15.689 --> 00:03:19.139
And kind of pissed about the whole “blowing
them up” thing.

00:03:19.139 --> 00:03:23.819
So you have to deal with tricky drifting,
voodoo priests, and some pretty ridiculous

00:03:23.819 --> 00:03:24.819
rubberbanding.

00:03:24.819 --> 00:03:28.459
It’s not quite Battletoads, but still, Super
R.C.

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:34.199
Pro-Am is not easy.

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:44.599
Still, once you get used to drifting and taking
turns and battling zombie cars…it’s hard

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:45.879
not to have fun with it.

00:03:45.879 --> 00:03:46.879
It’s a fun game.

00:03:46.879 --> 00:03:47.879
And it’s really charming, too.

00:03:47.879 --> 00:03:51.120
I mean, the tracks are a little plain, but
the cars look great.

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:53.379
And the audio’s a real highlight, too.

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:57.650
Whether it’s the sound of the cars, the
screeching of the tires, all the little sound

00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:00.049
effects…it’s just a really well-made game.

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:03.640
Lots of polish and attention to detail, which
you’d expect from Rare.

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:08.560
Plus, it supports the Game Boy link cable
for up to four players, which is awesome.

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:12.989
I guess if there’s any problems, uh…I
mean, the challenge might be off-putting to

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:13.989
some.

00:04:13.989 --> 00:04:15.779
It’s definitely bordering on cheap at times.

00:04:15.779 --> 00:04:20.419
And actually, since the screen’s so small,
you don’t see the obstacles until they’re

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:21.829
right in front of you.

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:26.720
So you have, like, a split second to avoid
them, which can also be frustrating.

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:28.770
To say nothing of the goddamn voodoo priests.

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:31.750
So yeah, this won’t be a game for everyone.

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:36.780
But if you’re patient, and good at drifting,
and you have a Game Boy link cable, and you

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:42.940
have friends with their own copies, and…actually,
that’s a lot.

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:44.389
Huh.

00:04:44.389 --> 00:04:49.289
Let’s try that again, if you have a pulse
and a Game Boy and a spear with which to keep

00:04:49.289 --> 00:04:52.349
the witch doctors at bay…check out Super
R.C.

00:04:52.349 --> 00:04:53.349
Pro-Am.

00:04:53.349 --> 00:04:56.210
The R.C. stands for “remorseless cutting.”

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:58.000
Of the trees.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.159
Freaking tree-ist.
