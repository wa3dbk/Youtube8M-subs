[Music playing]

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.400
The first day I was still welled up like a spring. 

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.100
And a day later I struggled immediately.

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:55.100
It took probably a day and on the second day, I was just coming as myself.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.100
It's quite challenging putting this kind of landscape down into film

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:04.400
because it is so broad and it is so beautiful.

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.900
And you don't know I was getting that right on film.

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:14.200
You can only get pieces of it, so you try to get the most beautiful pieces that you can.

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:18.200
My inspiration for photography as a photographer has been the natural world.

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:22.200
So whenever, I mean what I consider the natural world, it makes me feel good.

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:26.300
I feel inspired, I feel like I want to take pictures.

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:28.300
And I want to learn, I want to know.

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:36.800
Amongst esteemed landscapes, it is quite challenging shooting film alongside them.

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:40.200
Using digital has been quite challenging as well because it's a different mindset.

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:46.600
I'm still away thinking if I'll tend to stick to cities and crazy countries but there are people around.

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:50.300
And so that's been really interesting here.

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:55.800
It's the sense of people of living here but there's no trace of them.

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.100
Being a fast photographer, everything is quite fast.

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:05.200
You're looking for the news angle of the day.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.300
Coming into the Territory is looking at life a little differently.

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.900
To see that the light changing from sunrise to sunset.

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:19.600
And everyday it's different—you're not gonna get the same colours every single day.

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:23.900
Every single day something plays a part in this and it changes it.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:32.100
[Music playing]

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:38.400
I've directed many shoots and light and just the background is always the issue.

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.900
Whereas here, it's about what to shoot first.

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:42.700
And that says a lot.

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:46.900
You'll be looking at something and you might not see something.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.200
But then all of a sudden, something will grab your eye again.

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.000
Like every time you look at a scene, something new grabs your eye.

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.000
And it's just like you come for the discovery.

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:01.200
[Music playing]

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:06.400
I was a little bit nervous about sort of going to the long grass by the edge of the water

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:08.200
because there's always that threat of crocodiles.

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:11.700
And you can't help thinking about snakes, particularly crocodiles.

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:19.300
And there's extraordinary pink lilies, just that wonderful against the floodplains behind.

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:27.400
We've just arrived right on top of this hill, overlooking the floodplains and Western Arnhem Land.

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.200
It's just so stunning as you can see.

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:32.100
And the journey up here was just extraordinary.

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:36.300
Going up at the top to that sacred area, it's just beautiful.

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.500
So these ones, do you wonder what they were making?

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:39.500
[Aboriginal term]

00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:43.200
Oaks fleshing.

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:45.900
The light was fantastic in those caves.

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:51.200
That lovely frontal light, beautiful soft light and the way it reflected off their faces.

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:57.700
And the art behind, the rock art behind, from a photographic point of view, is very easy.

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:00.000
And the pictures look great.

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:07.400
And you got these two guys, Indigenous guys, both Gary and Wilfred and they let us in to their world.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:16.000
The best thing, for me, was Gary and the boys up there and also down at the Arts Centre.

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:17.700
I thought that was just wicked.

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:21.200
And Gary's smile was just awesome.

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:31.600
[Music playing]

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:35.400
I didn't expect as much of the woodie, the woodland.

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:39.800
I thought it would be a bit more just red dirt and not much growings.

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:43.700
So its lushness, that was a surprise.

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:49.200
I thought it would be the arid, harsh, impossible to survive in sort of place.

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:53.400
It's much greener—and the greens are really, really intense.

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:59.000
There's a sort of light green that's lovely and always wet.

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:12.600
[Music playing]

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:17.900
Getting out here on the water and seeing the crocodiles, which I've been looking forward to for some time.

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.000
[Laughing]

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:23.100
Yeah people love crocodiles well I think because it's the largest, most dangerous animal we have.

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:25.400
And there's a lot of them out there.

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:32.500
And the minute it got dark and Max said we've gotta get out here with that edge, I got really scared.

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:41.800
Just these people that you meet on your trip is extraordinary.

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:45.700
You know you hear about crocodile dug there or other people, they're not real.

00:05:45.800 --> 00:05:50.900
But these guys are real. They actually get out there and they're doing it they were only quiet about it.

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:55.400
And they give you an amazing experience, and you feel safe in their hands.

00:05:55.600 --> 00:06:05.700
[Music playing]

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:12.100
I think you do have to think about what you're doing as a photographer to feel where you are.

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:16.400
I mean there's quite a lot of shadow found here on my right and I don't wanna include too much of that.

00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:18.600
And there's raw of a life on the left-hand side.

00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:24.800
So I've got to get a nice balance between the two and at the same time maintain a point of interest.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.400
I love those Pandanas tree.

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:30.200
They're rising in my sort of main part of my picture. It's just lovely.

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:46.600
[Music playing]

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:50.300
We had a chance to see the landscape and to see the wildlife

00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:54.000
in a way that is actually compatible with the local people.

00:06:54.300 --> 00:07:03.200
And even for them to enhance our experience, they get the landowners to show us what their real treasures are.

00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:13.700
It's nice to be here—quiet, in the middle of the nature and the culture and the knowledge.

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:16.100
It's a [Aboriginal term] country.

00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:17.400
This is my Mother Land.

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:41.900
[Music playing]

00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:46.100
It's been great, I mean it's been great travelling with that crowd.

00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:50.100
Getting in the shower at the end of day and seeing all that dirt wash over you,

00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:51.500
you go, god I've had a great day. 

00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:55.100
Ah, it's a great experience.

00:07:55.300 --> 00:08:05.300
