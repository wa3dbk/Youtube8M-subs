00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.900
So, I'm talking about some of my off grid fears.

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:19.200
I'm assuming that any time you make a huge chance in your life

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:22.780
Or your lifestyle there are some fears.

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:33.300
So, I guess by talking about some of my fears I can overcome them and maybe you have advice to help me move forward.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Having a home base

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.800
One of my fears is that, I need a home base.

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:54.200
It would be nice to get into an RV and travel all over the place but I need a home base.

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:57.700
I want a place where my daughter can come visit.

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:04.600
I want a place where I can park and park for months and no one comes and tells me I have to move.

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:10.200
I want to be able to setup shop the way I want to

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.400
and no one says, you know, you can't put that there or whatever the case maybe.

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:18.900
So, I want a home base.

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:26.200
I also wanted a place where I can park my vehicles safely and travel where ever I want to go and come back

00:01:33.462 --> 00:01:34.462
and come back and know that I can stay at that location for however long I want

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:35.960
That's one of my fears

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:47.500
The reason why I can't use my current location for my home base is because I live in a development that HOA

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
and I can't tell you how much I dislike the HOA

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:57.500
Originally, ten years ago, when I move here, I came from the city 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:04.400
We didn't have an HOA.  I thought that it was a way to help protect your property value

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:12.500
and I had no idea how intrusive people, who are unpaid can be

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:21.900
So, needless to say I can not use my current property because of the rules for the HOA

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:30.100
One of the problems in achieving that here in Delaware

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:35.700
is that you can't, you can not buy land

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:40.100
pull your RV, travel trailer on it and live

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:41.400
its against the law

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:46.800
I have spoke to the housing and zoning

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:50.200
here locally and

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:52.240
its something that is not allowed

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:59.100
So, one way around that is to 

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:03.760
live on land that already has a primary structure.

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:12.400
Which means that it is hooked up to a well, septic, electricity whatever

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:13.940
I know, that's not off grid

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:21.500
But, lets say the land is two acres then you

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.600
could sub-divide it 

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:31.100
not legally but you know sub - divided it rent out the property 

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:33.600
and you can live on the other half of the property

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:36.700
with no questions asked

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:39.400
Having the loop hole option

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.100
actually helps

00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:44.300
because there will be a well and will be a septic 

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:47.100
because there is a primary structure there already

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:51.500
I could just hire someone to tapped into those

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:55.500
ulitilites and be able to use the well and septic

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:57.500
along with the tenant

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:02.600
Also, because I'm going to be renting the place out

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:07.000
that is a level of income that I don't have currently

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:09.900
so, that also will be a benefit.

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:14.800
So, although it seems like I'm jumping through a hoop

00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:19.200
to make this happen

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:21.300
in the long run I think it will help me out

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:23.420
and just think

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:26.300
if I ever decided that I nolonger want to live

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:30.200
in an RV.  I don't have to renew the lease

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:34.700
and there is a property that belongs to me there.  So I could

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:38.200
move in that.  So, it seems like a good plan

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:47.600
Another fear, although I love to traveling in my aliner

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:48.580
maybe i'st a little too small to live in

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:52.600
maybe it won't hold up well in bad weather

00:04:52.660 --> 00:04:56.300
So, those are others things that I have to consider

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:59.300
If you have checked out 

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.300
another video I did recently you will see

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.200
that I am researching 

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:08.000
larger living structures

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:11.300
so, one by one I am

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:13.300
putting my fears to rest

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:17.300
and moving forward with

00:05:17.998 --> 00:05:18.998
living off the grid

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000
because I am committed 

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:24.500
to living off the grid

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:27.000
it just has to be the right situation for me

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:30.700
or something that I can make compromising 

00:05:34.300 --> 00:05:36.300
