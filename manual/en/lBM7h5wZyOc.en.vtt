00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:21.360
Hello and welcome to another video brought
to you by AllFreeJewelryMaking.com and KeepsakeCrafts.net.

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:26.610
Today I'm going to show you how to make this
beautiful pair of earrings with just a few

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:27.980
simple tools.

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:29.722
The key is in choosing the right beads.

00:00:29.722 --> 00:00:35.500
So to make these earrings you just need a
few supplies.

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:38.030
You need two ear wires, two head pins.

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:43.650
I've chosen these silver head pins with a
decorative end, but you can also choose plain

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:50.199
head pins and then just add a spacer bead
and then the key to this design is the beads

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:51.640
you choose.

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:58.210
These are top drilled teardrop shaped beads
and the interesting thing is once you string

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:04.519
them together they start to spiral and make
an interesting shape.

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:05.519
I love this strand.

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:06.890
I chose it for a few reasons.

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:12.090
First of all because I love the colors and
I love the graduated look, although once you

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:18.210
look at it closely, it's really just three
different colors on one strand and I like

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.789
the frosted and the shape.

00:01:20.789 --> 00:01:24.990
I just thought it would be interesting and
fun to play with.

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:31.240
The other tools that you will need are two
pair of chain nose pliers, a pair of round

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:37.380
nose pliers, a pair of wire cutters and that's
it.

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.039
Just your usual regular jewelry making tools.

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:48.999
So I'm going to go ahead and open up this
strand of beads and I'm going to start to

00:01:48.999 --> 00:01:56.799
lay out my earrings and actually I'm going
to separate them into three piles because

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:00.689
when I first looked at it in the store I thought
"oh I've got gradations".

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:07.299
Once I looked at it more closely, I realized
it's just three different colors and you notice

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:14.100
they string them with these little seed beads
which kind of fills out the strand a bit more,

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:19.700
but you can save those seed beads and use
them for another project.

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:24.200
They're good fillers.

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:31.450
So here we have the beads and actually I'm
just gonna start playing.

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:44.090
I'm going to try doing two of each color and
what's nice about these and other similar

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:52.989
shaped beads is that they kind of snap together
as you thread them on.

00:02:52.989 --> 00:02:55.150
See?

00:02:55.150 --> 00:03:00.220
You can kind of push them down and then they
make that interesting shape.

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:05.060
So that's one way that it can be done.

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:09.849
I'm not sure if I'm thrilled with that, so
let's try it a different way.

00:03:09.849 --> 00:03:21.959
Let's try one, let's do this one and there's
more yellow green and then the blue green,

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:24.329
back to the turquoise.

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:26.720
There you go.

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:31.480
I think I like that better.

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:38.050
The one thing you can do when you're making
jewelry, don't be afraid to experiment.

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:43.800
Often it's just the materials that are inspiring
and as you put them together, you'll see the

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:45.430
ways that you like them best.

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:48.910
I think I like that better and that's it.

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:50.350
That's all there is to it.

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:58.459
I'm just going to make sure that the narrow
ends are all together so they make that pattern

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:08.750
and then I'm going to make a loop by grabbing
it with my chain nose pliers and bend it at

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:19.470
a 90 degree angle, grab it with my round nose
pliers right at the bend, hold nice and tight,

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:29.140
wrap that around as far as it will go and
then reposition your round nose pliers and

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:31.120
finish your loop.

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:45.790
Use your wire cutters to cut off the excess
and then use the flat part of your round nose

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:48.720
pliers to make that loop nice.

00:04:48.720 --> 00:05:00.840
The final step is to open up your ear wire
with chain nose pliers, pop on your loop and

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:05.730
close it up and that's it.

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:09.310
A very simple lovely pair of earrings.

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:13.770
So hang on a moment and I'll finish this one
and come back and show you again how they

00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:14.860
look.

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:19.370
So here's another look at our completed earrings.

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:25.040
As you can see it's really the shape of the
bead that does all the work for you so don't

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:29.830
be afraid to choose beads that have a different
unusual look.

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:32.960
Play around with them and you may find something
fun and new.

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:35.400
I hope you've enjoyed this project.
