(BACKGROUND MUSIC: Piano playing)

00:00:01.336 --> 00:00:05.785
MALE NARRATOR (off camera): As a child I was taught that to protect this world it would be a group effort

00:00:05.785 --> 00:00:09.170
and the job doesn't belong to just one generation.

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:15.225
Taking a class on contemporary social problems has showed me that there are still many issues in today's world,

00:00:15.225 --> 00:00:17.904
climate change being one of them.

00:00:17.904 --> 00:00:20.255
We can't wait until it's too late.

00:00:20.255 --> 00:00:24.420
Let's act right here, right now, together.

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.264

DR. LESZEK SIBILSKI, PROFESSOR, CONTEMPORARY SOCIAL PROBLEMS CLASS:  Climate change is your problem, more than anything else.

00:00:34.105 --> 00:00:39.304
This is about your survival, this is about your children, this is about your grandchildren.

00:00:47.864 --> 00:00:50.466
COURTNEY LIEBERMAN:  Climate change is a social problem we created

00:00:50.466 --> 00:00:52.065

00:01:19.586 --> 00:01:23.586
and we're here at the World Bank to connect with climate right here, right now.

00:01:23.586 --> 00:01:26.420
I'm excited and let's explore.

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:28.587

00:01:28.587 --> 00:01:33.703

KINNEY:  Our social problems class has brought us here to the World Bank.

00:01:36.023 --> 00:01:38.625
As you can see, the whole world is behind us.

00:01:38.625 --> 00:01:40.265
Thank you, Dr. Sibilski.

00:01:42.254 --> 00:01:45.170

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:51.625

00:01:54.170 --> 00:02:00.587

FEMALE NARRATOR (off-screen):  After the event, I was still wondering the way to make the world better.

00:02:28.024 --> 00:02:30.420
But now, I think in a different way.

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.024
Every big change starts with a small step,

00:02:33.024 --> 00:02:37.864
and here at the World Bank I have already seen so many young people all around the world

00:02:37.864 --> 00:02:40.465
to start fighting the climate change.

00:02:40.465 --> 00:02:43.785
They are my inspiration to change the world right here and right now.

00:02:43.785 --> 00:02:45.864
What are yours?

00:03:04.703 --> 00:03:06.144
Will you help us finish?

00:03:06.144 --> 00:03:08.865
DARBY WHITEHAIR:  There are over 7 billion people in 196 countries.

00:03:08.865 --> 00:03:12.104
This means there are 7 billion sets of hands that can help fight climate change.

00:03:12.104 --> 00:03:15.254
LIEBERMAN:  The polar bears and many other creatures are frequently losing their homes.

00:03:15.254 --> 00:03:16.904

00:03:31.505 --> 00:03:33.254
from the Terps to you:

00:03:33.254 --> 00:03:34.420
recycle.

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:36.267

00:03:40.498 --> 00:03:43.303
Mother Nature is calling. Are you going to answer it?

00:03:43.303 --> 00:03:44.919
SCOTT:  We've seen the past.

00:03:44.919 --> 00:03:47.763
