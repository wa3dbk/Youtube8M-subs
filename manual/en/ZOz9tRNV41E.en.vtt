00:00:01.959 --> 00:00:04.620
My name is Paes164 and I'm a professional
artist.

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.920
I've been painting since a teenager, and I've
been doing it for 20 years now.

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:18.939
Find me at Paes164.com (p-a-e-s-164.com) My
Facebook is facebook.com/paes_art.

00:00:18.939 --> 00:00:20.269
Next letter up, the letter V.

00:00:20.269 --> 00:00:22.590
We're gonna start off with a throw-y.

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:25.050
So, we just come off one end.

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.579
We want to get a good nice bubbly letter,
its kinda hard w ith such a straight one but

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:33.880
this will work.

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:40.510
Right after doing that, just a little bit
of a 3D, definitely makes the letter pop.

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:46.300
Work your way, fill up the whole 3D all the
way around.

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:47.300
Boom.

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:54.760
The letter V. Next, would be the blockbuster
so, just keep it in that box-y frame.

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:57.679
Just as simple as it sounds.

00:00:57.679 --> 00:01:00.531
Taking that same color we used to sketch it
in.

00:01:00.531 --> 00:01:09.580
And again, using a fatter tip, you would get
more coverage faster but you definitely want

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:13.720
to keep your hand movement steady, so there's
no paint build up.

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:20.060
Follow that up with an even darker color for
the outline.

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:27.170
A good typical outline tip, will have no problem,
doing the trick.

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:30.509
Taking the last color and creating an inner
outline.

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.969
There you go, a blockbuster V.

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:43.060
So, about the last little trick is going to
be us doing a wild style V.

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:47.479
So maybe we'll just bend it around.

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:49.182
Same color I used to sketch it, I'm going
to fill it in.

00:01:49.182 --> 00:01:53.369
We've got the fill of our letter done.

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.360
Come through, and do some fill in.

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:07.549
You know, the fill in is just a matter of
patterns and colors and whatever you fancy.

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:12.730
Take it as far as you can do on a flannel
shirt pattern inside your fill.

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:18.920
We are working our way through the outline
of our V. A lot of times you'll see graffiti

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:25.410
artists when they're doing big burners or
big murals, they'll kinda replace certain

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:33.000
letters in their name in their piece with
pictures, just because of the lack of what

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.850
you can do with it and I would say a V is
definitely one of those letters that can be

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:39.850
replaced.

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:44.750
Let's say, its all about standing ten feet
back and taking a look at the piece and reading

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:46.370
what it says.

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:52.380
So we got, just a little pattern of yellow's
skipping through and I'm gonna inner outline

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:53.660
it now.

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:58.370
Again, sometimes when you get into these long
lines, you don't want to go off, especially

00:02:58.370 --> 00:03:02.960
if you have a really complex fill and your
hand dips off and doesn't get the line right

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:05.290
you end up having to fix up a whole area.

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:10.171
So, if you have to, kinda pre-fill out the
line before you do it.

00:03:10.171 --> 00:03:13.760
It just makes it easier for you to get it
sprayed on right.

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:19.560
Let's finish this V up with a outer outline
or, outer gel.

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:23.070
Well, just like that, wild style V.
