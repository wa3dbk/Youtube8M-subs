00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:12.120
There are many Christian-atheists who act
like they are VERY concerned about the deepest

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.160
darkest jungle and the people that live there.

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:22.340
They ask questions like; "Will those people
go to HELL if they haven't had a Christian

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:24.900
missionary?"

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:32.300
See they are Atheists even though they call
themselves Christians because they don't believe

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:35.910
that GOD can speak for HIMSELF.

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:43.579
They think the only way is if a missionary
goes there with a Bible.

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:47.470
IT IS JUST A BIG FAT LIE!

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:55.769
Why is it that Christians believe fully that
Satan can find anyone in the deepest darkest

00:00:55.769 --> 00:01:00.410
jungle anywhere in the entire WORLD?

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:08.970
If that person is choosing to do EVIL we have
absolute faith that SATAN CAN find THAT person?

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:15.200
But how is it then we do not have absolute
faith in GOD that HE can find ANY PERSON ANYWHERE

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:20.380
IN THE WORLD, WHO IS A SEEKER OF RIGHTEOUSNESS?

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:21.380
WHY IS THAT?

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:29.110
That is because people do NOT believe that
Jesus actually CAN speak for HIMSELF.

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:34.040
They have been duped by the Christians who
THINK that God is dead.

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:40.070
They are Christian-Atheists and they THINK
the only way GOD can speak is through the

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:43.750
Bible and through THEIR missionaries.

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:46.070
It is a BIG LIE!

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:51.860
Those who seek WILL FIND, EVEN if they do
NOT know the name of JESUS.

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:53.450
THEY WILL FIND.

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.470
It matters where your HEART IS.

00:01:55.470 --> 00:02:02.700
If your heart is seeking out purity and Righteousness
JESUS WILL FIND YOU and HE WILL SHOW YOU THE

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:03.700
TRUTH.

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:09.380
BUT if your heart is wicked and you are seeking
out things that are wicked and evil, the devil

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:13.129
will certainly find you, and he will destroy
you.

00:02:13.129 --> 00:02:16.920
It depends where you heart is.

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.050
WHERE IS YOUR HEART?

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:21.819
May the grace of Jesus be with you.
