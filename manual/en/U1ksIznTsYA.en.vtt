00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.620
&gt;&gt; DAVE: Hi! My name is Dave Ward, and 
I'm here with my wife, Monica Ward,

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:14.900
who is doing The 21 Day Fix program.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.900
And, we just recently filmed a great tips 
video where Monica gave you her Top 10 Tips.

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:20.000
 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.900
That has generated a whole bunch of questions.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.500
So, I'm gonna interview Monica and we're 
gonna talk about these questions.

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.900
And, hopefully, get your question answered in this series.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.599
Alright, Monica, next question on our 21 
Day Fix FAQ video series is:

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:39.900
"Do you get to drink alcohol on the 21 Day Fix?"

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.900
&gt;&gt; MONICA: Yes, you do.
&gt;&gt; DAVE: Oh, boy.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.900
&gt;&gt; MONICA: What?
&gt;&gt; DAVE: Let's party.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.900
&gt;&gt; MONICA: So, three days a week you can substitute your carb...

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.900
one of your...

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.900
so I get two of these a day. And, three days 
a week, I can sub one of these.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.900
Honestly, it's the saddest size container for alcohol.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.900
&gt;&gt; DAVE: That's, like, maybe 4 oz, do you think?

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.900
&gt;&gt; MONICA: That's a good question.
&gt;&gt; DAVE: Maybe.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.920
&gt;&gt; MONICA: That I can't...I can't tell you.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.900
However, it is a very, very small portion of red wine.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.900
&gt;&gt; MONICA:: And, uh...
&gt;&gt; DAVE: Could I fill it with vodka?

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.900
&gt;&gt; MONICA: I don't know.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.900
You're such a trouble maker.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.900
So, one three times a week,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.900
you can sub out one of your yellow containers for red wine.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.900
&gt;&gt; DAVE: Okay.
&gt;&gt; MONICA: And, that's it.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.900
&gt;&gt; DAVE: And, that's it?
&gt;&gt; MONICA: That's it. So, don't give me any suggestions.

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:37.000
 

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.900
But my, I guess my..

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.900
if you have too...if you must, I would, you know,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.900
you have the option to do so. You also can sub out...

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.500
you can put potato chips in this.
They're very specific about which ones.

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.900
You can put in tortilla chips if you have that...

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.900
you know, have to have some tortilla chips.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.900
So, there's...there's options in here.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.900
And, you just have to be really careful.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:08.900
That stuff is gonna alter your results.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.900
Obviously, you're gonna get the best 
results by staying true to the program.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.900
And, honestly it's only two...it's for 21 days.

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:16.000
 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.209
&gt;&gt; DAVE: Right.
&gt;&gt; MONICA: You know, why not give yourself

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:21.900
the opportunity to get some rockin' results in 21 days?

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.900
And, then when you move into the next 
phase, you can...you have a baseline for RA.

00:02:28.019 --> 00:02:29.900
Three days a week I can have.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:36.900
&gt;&gt; DAVE: And, you know, we talked earlier 
in one of the other videos in this 21 Day Fix FAQ video series...

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.989
 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.310
we talked about establishing simple, healthy 
habits and the 21 Day Fix,

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:45.939
is not really designed to be this 21 day 
thing where you go 21 days and get some results,

00:02:45.939 --> 00:02:47.900
and then go right back to whatever it was you were doing.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.900
That's, I think, one of those simple healthy 
habits that can really carry people a long, long way

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:53.000
 

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.900
is learning how to really limit your alcohol content.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.900
&gt;&gt; MONICA: Um hmmm.
&gt;&gt; DAVE: Yeah. Okay, cool, thanks.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.900
