Alright, I'm Jose Perez and I'm the owner
of the Castillo Farms. We breed these pigs

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:12.509
here. All these pigs have came, they've been
born here, all these pigs were raised here,

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:19.330
born here and they do great for us at the
show. We order, we don't just use Corky as

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:26.960
our boar, we always use the top cut show sires,
and their located in Ohio, and we order semen

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:33.540
from them, and it comes in within a day, and
we breed them on the day that they're in standing

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:40.870
heat. They come in a heat every twenty one
days, and that's when we try to figure out

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:46.100
their heat cycle, so that we know if they
don't come in the next month, then they're

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:50.910
not bred, so we have to re-breed them. But,
they have to be bred within six months before

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:58.110
the fair starts, so that they can grow to
be around two hundred and fifty pounds. But,

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:04.460
here we sell our pigs for two hundred, or
two hundred and fifty dollars. We also clip

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:11.320
their ears on the markings they have on their
ears, we clip those as to tell us our identification,

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:19.120
we give them our premise ID number tag, and
ours are red, and we also clip their tails.

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:27.850
We clip their teeth, if their sucking on the
mama. We also castrate them here too, but

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:35.121
that's a job that I'm the one whose supposed
to do that because it's a really, it's a really

00:01:35.121 --> 00:01:42.540
hard job for them to, cause if you cut them
wrong, it can get infected or the cut will

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.240
be too long and you can cut into the meat.
So, all you want to do, is just do a small

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:52.840
incision, behind the back legs. Right now
we currently have for the kids for the fair,

00:01:52.840 --> 00:02:00.740
we sell about maybe sixty, sixty five pigs,
piglets and we have around eight sows right

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:06.590
now, and two boars. We give them shots here,
their iron shots and their penicillin, so

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:13.049
that they can stay healthy, and we do that
when their young, so it doesn't bother them.

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:18.340
But, you have to make sure that it's not in
the meat directly, that way it doesn't give

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:24.290
them purple meat. Right now it costs about
four hundred, fifty dollars to feed our animals

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:31.640
a month, and that's just in food, that's not
the panels that we buy, the water, it doesn't

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:32.379
include all of that.
