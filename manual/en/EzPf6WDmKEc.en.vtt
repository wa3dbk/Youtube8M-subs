00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:07.260
(cheerful music)

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:08.340
Hi everybody!

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.200
Today let's make something special,

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:13.160
delicious and sweet: baesuk

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.400
"bae" is pear,

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:18.960
"suk" means cooked.

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.600
So we are going to steam pear

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:24.580
if your family members or loved ones

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:28.900
are struggling from a cold,

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:29.600
make this for them and they will love this.

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.640
you can use this home remedy

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
for a cold, or dessert, and as a snack.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.980
Delicious.

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:37.080
Let's start!

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.480
(cheerful music)

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:43.220
So this is a Korean pear, I got

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:45.040
this at a Korean grocery store,

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.500
Also, this is a bosc pear,

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.640
Similar colour, similar - you know in my

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:52.700
bulgogi video, I used it all the time

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:54.700
in place of the Korean pear

00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:58.420
with a bosc pear. This guy is a bosc pear.

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:00.580
It tastes similar. I'm going to

00:01:01.340 --> 00:01:03.340
make baesuk, with a Korean pear

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:05.920
and also, with bosc pear.

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:08.940
I'm boiling water; this is my steamer.

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.360
I like to wash this nicely.

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.360
Dry off...

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:38.680
Cut it around 1 inch.

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:42.520
And inside, the seeds! We are going to take it out.

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:00.880
We need to get rid of this seeds part.

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.160
("zigeudeok" is the sound of the scraping)

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:16.660
We can fill this hole with

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:18.520
ginger and honey.

00:02:20.020 --> 00:02:22.020
This soft part; let's put it back a little bit.

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:29.060
We need ginger. Grate it,

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.400
like this.

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:34.380
Around one teaspoon, ginger.

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.520
Honey! Fill it up with honey.

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:46.120
Around one or two tablespoons.

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.820
Cinnamon powder: just a little bit.

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.540
Pine nuts,

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.380
jujubes. If you dont have jujubes, just skip it.

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:08.220
Add one more.

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:12.760
Put the lid on.

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:15.880
Put it here.

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:18.900
And, I'm going to steam soon!

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:20.560
Let's make bosc pear!

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.100
But as you see, it's not balanced.

00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:26.300
So I'm going to cut the bottom part a little bit,

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.200
like this.

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:32.000
So now, no problem. Same method,

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:34.700
we are going to do this,

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:38.320
And then inside, we need to scoop out.

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:44.760
This is very soft,

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:47.700
compared to the Korean pear.

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:53.220
You gotta (have to) be very gentle.

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:57.460
I don't see the seeds yet,

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:59.740
but I'm going to keep digging

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:01.740
until I see the seeds!

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:03.400
Okay, seeds!

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:11.040
I will just scoop out a little bit more.

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:12.420
Okay, done.

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.480
We have a nice "cave" here.

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:16.740
I'm going to put it back a little bit, just

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:18.680
like the Korean pear,

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:20.680
the soft parts.

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:22.160
Honey!

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:26.740
Honey, around 1 tablespoon.

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:29.140
Cinnamon powder,

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:34.720
And this is... ginger.

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:39.280
("cheeka cheeka" is the sound of the grating)

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:41.520
Ginger, around a half a teaspoon amount

00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:45.700
And then, this is the pine nuts!

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:49.240
Scoop out.

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:53.280
Remove the seed.

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:02.920
Beautiful. Done!

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:05.860
So this guy goes in the small

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:06.800
soup bowl.

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:10.940
This is a steamer rack,

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:14.260
and I'm going to put this in.

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:18.720
The water is boiling

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:23.800
and...I'm going to...

00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:29.120
steam this over medium high heat.

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:37.060
30 minutes after, the bosc pear, small sized,

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:38.900
is cooked properly.

00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:40.780
Let's take out the bosc pear first.

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:45.820
Looks really

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:47.720
translucent, with some juice

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:49.720
that came out on the bottom.

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:50.540
It's done.

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:52.800
So this guy,

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:54.800
we are going to cook longer.

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:57.200
Open this!

00:05:57.660 --> 00:06:01.080
Yeah! Wow! So steamy!

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:04.160
Great! Very soft.

00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:06.260
The ginger, cinnamon smells,

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:08.540
with this pear smell: really awesome!

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:11.620
This is going to be one portion for a really good dessert!

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:13.720
Right, and when you serve this,

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:16.360
how about some mint.

00:06:16.360 --> 00:06:17.340
Yes.

00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:19.000
So, really pretty!

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:21.480
Let me taste it!

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:23.800
With a spoon, you are going to scoop out

00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:26.860
and eat it all with the juice, together.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000
Mmm.

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:31.520
So tasty.

00:06:31.740 --> 00:06:35.020
It's a sweet, flavourful, delicious dessert.

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:43.940
Let's open this!

00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:46.160
See, well cooked

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:49.080
and you will see lots of liquid juice

00:06:49.080 --> 00:06:50.080
on the bottom.

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:55.180
(jazzy music)

00:06:55.180 --> 00:06:56.720
Hmm.

00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:58.440
So sweet!

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:01.180
When you serve this, your family members

00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:02.880
will really be grateful.

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:05.840
They will always remember your love.

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:07.700
Today, we made baesuk,

00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:09.700
steamed pear.

00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:10.920
Enjoy my recipe,

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:12.340
see you next time!

00:07:12.340 --> 00:07:14.100
Byeee!

00:07:14.220 --> 00:07:28.400
(cheery music) ((have a wonderful day! ~ the transcriptionist))
