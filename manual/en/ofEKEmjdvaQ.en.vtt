00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:08.439
Hello Bagar BÃ¤rta here!

00:00:08.439 --> 00:00:12.499
Today we're going to do a Swedish chocolate cake.

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:17.240
We start by checking that we have all the ingredients at home.

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.720
To this recipe that I use, so should we have ...

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.419
powdered sugar

00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:26.439
That we have here.

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:31.919
We need to have vanilla sugar, that we have here.

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:36.160
and so , we need to have salt and that we have here.

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:40.880
we need to have flour and that we have here.

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:43.100
and butter

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:44.500
and that we have here.

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:49.730
And of course , we need to have eggs too.I to retrieve

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:56.730
eggs and cocoa.
( cocoa............ Don't say it.......no

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:11.620
I have no eggs or cocoa home.

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:13.880
Shit pomesfrit 
( an expression)

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:20.880
Ohh, now I know, I'll call and ask the neighbor if I can get some.

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.980
Hi Edward.

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:37.300
I have a question for you.

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:43.220
Could I get eggs and cocoa of you

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:49.010
I need two eggs and four tablespoons of cocoa, can I get it from you?

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:53.650
Supreme Edward I will pass by and pick them up

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:56.280
It takes five minutes, I'm with you.

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.479
Thank you so much, goodbye.

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:03.490
Lucky to have so nice neighbors in this neighborhood, I'm going

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:05.279
rush home to Edward and retrieve cocoa and eggs

00:02:05.279 --> 00:02:07.460
and we will see soon

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:13.010
how to make a Swedish chocolate cake

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:15.159
Now I have been with the neighbor and retrieved

00:02:15.159 --> 00:02:16.499
eggs and

00:02:16.499 --> 00:02:18.159
cocoa

00:02:18.159 --> 00:02:21.489
We start with the to melted the butter.

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:23.889
we need to have 100 grams of butter.

00:02:23.889 --> 00:02:26.119
The butter I cut

00:02:26.119 --> 00:02:29.649
in to

00:02:29.649 --> 00:02:32.969
smaller 

00:02:32.969 --> 00:02:35.909
pieces

00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:39.599
Then it will speed up to melted the butter.

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:43.109
I put the bowl with the butter in the

00:02:43.109 --> 00:02:46.659
microwave

00:02:46.659 --> 00:02:48.939
becuse is quicker to melted the butter then.

00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:55.599
I melt the butter for about 1 minute in the microwave

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:05.199
Now we mix all the ingredients, but not the butter we put in later.

00:03:05.199 --> 00:03:12.199
crack the eggs

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:31.269
and it shall be two eggs in this recipe.

00:03:32.269 --> 00:03:34.229
then we put in cocoa

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:42.489
it is 4 tablespoons cocoa

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:47.469
then we will put in 

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:49.920
powdered sugar

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:53.389
and the will we have 

00:03:53.389 --> 00:04:00.389
3 cup granulated sugar

00:04:05.659 --> 00:04:07.339
so we add in this in the bowl

00:04:07.339 --> 00:04:09.949
swasch

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:11.079
one and a half  teaspoon

00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:18.079
vanilla sugar

00:04:30.729 --> 00:04:34.110
1.5 cups flour

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:01.870
and now we have 1.5 cups flour.

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:04.340
salt

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:11.680
and it'll be about a pinch of salt

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:13.270
Last but not least

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:14.919
will we put in the butter.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:35.000
stir so it gets a nice chocolate batter.

00:05:37.229 --> 00:05:42.469
I must now prepare a form for the chocolate cake.

00:05:48.749 --> 00:05:52.259
a form

00:05:53.090 --> 00:06:00.090
It should be greased with butter and sprinkle with breadcrumbs.

00:06:02.169 --> 00:06:03.479
Instead of breadcrumbs, I use oatmeal.

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:21.369
Chocolate Batter look like this when everything is mixed.

00:06:21.369 --> 00:06:28.369
Pour the chocolate into the mold.

00:06:37.209 --> 00:06:40.879
smooth out the batter.

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:04.549
yumi, a very good chocolate batter :)

00:07:05.979 --> 00:07:11.240
and now this in the oven for about

00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:13.490
35 min

00:07:13.490 --> 00:07:17.840
for abaout 150 degrees.

00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:24.840
In to the oven with this.

00:07:45.129 --> 00:07:45.990
and now we have a Swedish chocolate cake.
