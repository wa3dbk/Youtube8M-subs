00:00:01.970 --> 00:00:03.970
Here!
This is my Three-colored sweet desserts.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.790
It's very easy, but so cute.

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:10.770
You should try it.

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:13.210
Hello, again.

00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:17.820
Now,
I'm going to make "Three-colored sweet desserts".

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:21.360
This dish is easy, 
but looks so cute.

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:23.800
I often surprise my friends with this dish.

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:26.560
The ingredients are here.

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:32.640
Powdered gelatin, Sugar, Soymilk, Green powdered tea,
Sweet bean paste, Fresh cream and...

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:35.660
Sugar for a caramel decoration.

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.900
Now,
Let's get started!

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:41.200
First,
dissolve the powdered gelatin in hot water.

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:44.500
Prepare hot water at temperatures of over 176 degrees F (80'C).

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:51.190
Add the powdered gelatin in it.

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:54.040
Mix them.

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:57.990
To dissolve Gelatin,
you need to keep hot water over 180 F(80'C).

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.140
Be careful and keep the water hot.

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:02.290
When the powdered gelatin was dissolved...

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.960
Add the sugar.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.800
Mix and dissolve the sugar.

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.910
Then, the gelatin liquid is done.

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:20.110
Next,
make my soymilk pudding.

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:23.100
The soymilk pudding is very simple.

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:29.190
Add the half of the gelatin liquid 
to the soymilk at room temperature.

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:33.760
Add it.

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.670
Mix the liquid thoroughly.

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:47.130
Adjust the amount of the gelatin liquid as needed.

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:53.920
And then,
wrap and refrigerate for 60 minutes.

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:56.350
It's just too easy here.

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:59.690
Next,
make whip cream.

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:03.290
Today,
I have already added the sugar to the gelatin liquid.

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:07.580
So,
You don't need to add sugar to the whip cream.

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.710
Add the fresh cream in a food processor.

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.190
Switch on it.

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.230
On.

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:23.830
Here,
the cream was fully-whipped.

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:26.730
Stop it.

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.440
And,
divide the cream into two.

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:36.130
And
we are going to make two types of mousse.

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:42.990
You can guess the amount by eye.

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.250
Here,
the whip cream is done.

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.720
Next,
Add the ingredients to the whip cream.

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:59.000
First,
mix the sweet bean paste into the whip cream.

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:02.640
When they are well-mixed,

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:10.550
Mix half of the remaining gelatin liquid.

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:15.650
Adjust the amount of the gelatin liquid as needed.

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:21.520
Here,
the sweet bean mousse is ready.

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.330
Next,
make a MACCHA mousse (green tea mousse).

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:30.800
Mix the green powdered tea into the whip cream.

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:34.110
They are well-mixed.

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:38.820
Add the remaining gelatin liquid into this.

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:41.960
Mix together well.

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:46.990
Adjust the amount of the gelatin liquid as needed.

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:50.830
Good!

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:56.590
They are well-blended.

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:04.320
And then,
wrap and cool for 60 minutes in the refrigerator.

00:04:04.350 --> 00:04:07.470
Wrap them.

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:13.070
Cool for 60 minutes in the refrigerator.

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:17.240
While waiting for cooling,
cook caramel decoration.

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:22.030
First,
Place a baking sheet on a cutting board.

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:28.440
And,
add the sugar onto a pan.

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:34.210
And then,
cook the sugar over direct heat.

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:40.440
They are melting, like this.

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:49.490
Swing the pan frequently to prevent burning.

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:52.200
They are all melting, like this.

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:59.090
Swing the pan to prevent too burning.

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:01.180
Like this.

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:04.950
Stop the heat.

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:18.870
Then,
remove from the heat and cool little by little.

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:24.620
Now, 
the liquid is dripping, like this.

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:28.200
Cool it until it drop down like stringy.

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:33.090
Keep the liquid cooling until stringy.

00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:36.870
Cool to this stringy.

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:42.570
And then,
drop onto the baking sheet.

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:56.820
Drop from on high position,
so you can do well.

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:01.410
Here,
the caramel decoration is done.

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:05.450
Cool it for a while in the refrigerator, too.

00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:07.350
60 minutes have passed.

00:06:07.390 --> 00:06:09.980
There are the cooled ingredients.

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:12.970
Peel off the wraps.

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:21.670
Good!
it has solidified.

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:24.740
The sweet bean mousse has solidified, too.

00:06:24.780 --> 00:06:33.370
The soymilk pudding has solidified, too.

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:35.180
Next,
arrange them on a dish.

00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:43.540
First,
Remove the cooled caramel from the baking sheet.

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:46.050
It's beautiful. 

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:48.840
Place on the dish.

00:06:48.870 --> 00:07:02.430
Then,
scoop the soymilk pudding by a hot spoon.

00:07:02.470 --> 00:07:09.050
The sweet bean mousse.

00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:14.440
The MACCHA mousse (green tea mousse).

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:18.540
Finally,
Put up mint leaves for decoration.

00:07:19.090 --> 00:07:20.990
Oh, it's cute!

00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:29.980

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:33.790
