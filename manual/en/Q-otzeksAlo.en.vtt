Little dap.

It’s Jared Montz former pro and founder
of OnlineSoccerAcademy.com.

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:20.190
Today we are learning Barcelona midfielder
Andres Iniesta's Signature Move, La Croqueta.

00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:26.459
This OSA video is sponsored by our parent
company BelieveinitApparel.com.

00:00:26.459 --> 00:00:29.860
This move is an effective way to escape defenders
in tight spaces.

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:34.300
It's usually done at a slow to medium running
pace.

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:39.320
It looks simple but it's very advanced because
of how close you are to the defender when

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:40.480
you make this move.

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.419
Remember it's not easy to make it look easy.

00:00:43.419 --> 00:00:45.610
Check Iniesta in action by clicking here.

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:49.880
He is so good and smooth like a glass of cold
milk!

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:55.899
Shout out and Little Dap to OSA player Michael
Donnarumma for requesting this video.

00:00:55.899 --> 00:00:58.250
Love that last name!

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:59.259
Donnarumma!

00:00:59.259 --> 00:01:06.610
Key Point #1 - Push the ball at speed using
the inside of your dominant foot across your

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:08.510
body towards your non dominant foot.

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:10.949
The speed of this push is important.

00:01:10.949 --> 00:01:15.770
If the ball is moving to slow the defender
will have a better chance to win it.

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:23.800
Remember it's a push, don't kick the ball.

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:34.140
Key Point #2 - Make sure the ball doesn't
move forward toward the defender.

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.949
You want it to move across your body.

00:01:36.949 --> 00:01:41.409
Keep your toe up when you push the ball and
this will help keep better control versus

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:43.040
having your toe pointed down.

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:48.839
Key Point #3 - Pass the ball forward to yourself
2-3 steps ahead of you and past the defender

00:01:48.839 --> 00:01:51.470
with the inside of your non dominant foot.

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:57.189
This touch forward will be more like a pass
or kick versus a push like your first touch.

00:01:57.189 --> 00:02:02.490
If there are no other defenders around you
then your touch forward can be 3-5 steps.

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:07.549
If there are other defenders nearby then take
a smaller touch of 1-2 steps

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:13.160
The reason you take a bigger touch when no
defenders are around is so you can run faster

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:14.160
towards the ball.

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:19.309
Naturally you can run faster without the ball
at your feet, then with it.

00:02:19.309 --> 00:02:24.140
Plus now you can get your eyes up the field
versus staring down at the ball.

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.590
Key Point #4 - Change pace!

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:32.609
No matter what move you do the most important
thing to do afterwards is change pace.

00:02:32.609 --> 00:02:39.230
The La Croqueta is typically done at a medium
to slow running pace, but once the move has

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:43.690
been executed be all Iniesta like and accelerate
to escape your defender.

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:45.120
That's it for the key points.

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:48.460
Before we get into the exercise I have a question
for you.

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:49.730
Do you like my shirt?

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:57.340
If yes, you can shop for it and the rest of
our Believe in it® Apparel line at http://www.BelieveinitApparel.com.

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:03.120
It's for motivated athletes; all ages, all
sports and we have a great mobile website

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.120
too!

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.380
You will need a ball and 4 cones for this
exercise.

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:09.990
We will set up this exercise in 3 parts.

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:16.389
Part 1 - Practice doing the La Croqueta without
the ball from a stand still to get your body

00:03:16.389 --> 00:03:19.660
use to how it will feel.

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:22.389
Part 2 - Now practice with the ball from a
stand still.

00:03:22.389 --> 00:03:26.540
Go slow in the beginning and then as you feel
comfortable increase the speed of the move.

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:29.380
Do the move, change pace then repeat.

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:31.949
Part 3 - Set up four cones.

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:38.370
A start cone and 5 yards ahead of it are two
cones about 2-3 steps apart from each other.

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:42.059
Then place your end cone about 10 yards up
the field.

00:03:42.059 --> 00:03:47.190
Dribble by walking slowly up to the cone on
your dominant foot side, for me this would

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:53.619
be the cone on my right side, do the La Croqueta,
don't let the ball hit the cones, then accelerate

00:03:53.619 --> 00:03:55.080
to the top cone as fast as you can.

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:57.169
Light jog back and repeat.

00:03:57.169 --> 00:04:01.350
Once you are comfortable from a walk, then
start increasing your run up speed up to a

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:03.210
medium pace.

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:16.730
Repeat until you master it!

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:22.050
If the defender is winning the ball all the
time then you may be to close to the defender.

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:26.740
You want to be about a step away from them
when you do the move, not right on top of

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:27.740
them.

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:29.240
Keep your speed of the move up too.

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:33.552
If the ball is pushed to slow across your
body that will give the defender plenty of

00:04:33.552 --> 00:04:37.570
time to get their foot out and win it.

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:39.210
Make a play!

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:43.840
Once you beat a defender with Iniesta's La
Croqueta then make a play.

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:46.170
Don't try to dribble 3 more defenders.

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:49.770
Get your shot, pass or cross off and make
a play.

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:55.540
Yes, be confident and take players on but
get your teammates involved in the game; don't

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:57.790
always try to do everything yourself.

00:04:57.790 --> 00:04:59.010
It's a team game.

00:04:59.010 --> 00:05:02.270
