00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:01.580
Hello hello!

00:00:01.700 --> 00:00:04.980
So this is my next installment of Trich tips.

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:08.960
I want to talk about lotions and potions and stuff.

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:11.680
The first on my list is Vaseline.

00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:14.460
Where is the Vaseline!? Woooo!

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:18.780
I did have a big pot, but it's gone walk bounce so here is my tiny pot.

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:22.020
Apparently this has got extra cocoa butter, but it does the same thing.

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:26.060
Personally I don't find this too helpful, but other people have found it helpful.

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:31.600
What they do is they put it at the ends of their fingertips or they rub it into their eyebrows or eyelashes

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:36.400
and it stops them from being able to grip onto what they want to tug.

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.980
Basically it just makes your fingers slippery.

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:43.360
I wouldn't say this is fantastic for head hair, but for eyebrows it helps.

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:47.180
This is more of a winter product because in the summer it melts.

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.020
Hmm, it's not too bad right now.

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:54.480
This isn't good to put in your hand bag, I've had one of these melt inside a handbag before. Wasn't nice.

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.720
It was like someone had tipped a cup of this in my handbag. Uh uh

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:01.440
Next on my list is Burt's Bees!

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:07.160
What I find is when I put this on my hands are extremely greasy for a good fifteen minutes.

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:13.160
I find it prevents me from pulling or as more of a deterrent...I don't want to get this in my hair.

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:14.280
I'm sure there are probably cheaper products then this on the market that do the same thing, but for now this is the product for me.

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.840
On a side note, this is Nivea Lip Butter.

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:31.060
It sort of does the same thing. It was about 2 pound in Boots um but it's like a Vaseliney thing um it makes it harder to grip as well.

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:35.420
So, to be honest, lip balms might help in that respect.

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.400
I've only just started using Bio Oil.

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:44.340
My buttocks is covered in these lovely white lines that I didn't really know about until recently.

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:49.320
And then I do have scars like from my shingles and from my picking with my Dermatillomania.

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.400
So anyway yeah I just thought I'd try this.

00:01:51.400 --> 00:02:00.140
The reason I'm bringing this up is that from a Dermatillomania perspective I find that putting this on before I go to bed...I find it difficult to touch my face

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:07.140
Um because it's so oily and slippery. Additionally because I touch my face my fingers are then oily so I can't touch my hair

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:10.020
So I don't know. This is helping a little bit.

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.760
And finally we move onto the world of primers.

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:20.420
I only discovered makeup when I was about nineteen and it's only in the last year that I have discovered primers and I'm still kind of learning what they do.

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:26.360
To my knowledge right now you just smother your face in it before you put your makeup on and it helps the makeup stay longer.

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.680
So this is my current primer and it's L'OrÃ©al. It's pink.

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:35.160
But this was quite expensive so I went out into the world to try and find some cheaper primers

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.600
And one primer that I found was a great Trich deterrent. This product here.

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:47.540
That primer in particular I just rubbed into my finger tips to test it and for about 15 - 20 minutes afterwards I couldn't play with my hair.

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:49.520
I couldn't tear it.

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:57.120
Cause the stuff is designed to get into your wrinkles and pores it got into my finger tips and just made them really smooth.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:04.260
I hope that this video helped some of you and if you have any products that you'd recommend for this sort of stuff trying to prevent yourself from pulling

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.800
then please can you leave some in the description below because that might help other people.

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:10.940
I swear this is like a microphone.

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:13.500
(Singing)  Do you believe in life after love!?

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:15.600
I don't know.

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:16.400
Oh sure. Bye!

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:25.900
Prom was a stressful event to prepare and endure. There was the formal attire to find.

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:29.960
The stress over travel arrangements. Uh the friendship group problems!

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:33.840
And then there was the hair. Hair...
