00:00:05.159 --> 00:00:07.799
Q: What's your condition like now?

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:12.679
A: I'm in great condition.

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:21.142
Q: What sort of training have you been doing for this fight?

00:00:21.142 --> 00:00:27.215
A: I haven't done anything particularly different from usual.

00:00:27.215 --> 00:00:37.967
Q: Your opponent is a boxer, so have you worked on your defense?

00:00:37.967 --> 00:00:45.434
A: I've been training to keep level headed in the ring.

00:00:45.434 --> 00:00:54.478
Q: What do you think of Watanabe?

00:00:54.478 --> 00:00:59.323
A: I know he is a former champion in boxer, and he looks like quite an athelite.

00:00:59.323 --> 00:01:04.489
I think he is suited to MMA.

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:14.396
Q: What do you want to show in the fight?

00:01:14.396 --> 00:01:46.556
A: I need to win first and foremost.

00:01:46.556 --> 00:01:52.685
Q: Which weight class do you hope to fight in next year?

00:01:52.685 --> 00:02:07.425
A: I will fight in the class that gives me the most opportunities.

00:02:07.425 --> 00:02:21.725
Q: The fighter you wanted to fight has gone to the UFCâ€¦

00:02:21.725 --> 00:02:34.766
A: KID is a great fighter. I wish him all the best.

00:02:34.766 --> 00:02:40.142
Q: Please look back on the year and share your feelings with us.

00:02:40.142 --> 00:03:03.799
A: It wasn't a good year but at least against Hansen I could be aggressive

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:13.539
 so I hope to be able to carry on with that.

00:03:13.539 --> 00:03:28.023
Q: Recently you've picked up more losses than wins. Why do you feel thatis?

00:03:28.023 --> 00:03:55.127
A: I think mainly my training. I was pushing myself too hard, but not sparring enough I guess.

00:03:57.007 --> 00:04:03.255
Q: How were you pushing yourself too hard if you weren't sparring?

00:04:03.255 --> 00:04:07.464
A: I was doing too much physical training.

00:04:07.464 --> 00:04:14.106
Q: Have you made any changes?

00:04:14.106 --> 00:04:34.688
A: Yes, I think I am getting back to my more agile ways.

00:04:38.206 --> 00:04:41.742
Q: When did you realize you needed to change?

00:04:41.742 --> 00:04:59.103
A: When I was facing Hansen and he mounted me, I didn't know what to do.

00:04:59.103 --> 00:05:04.181
I knew then I needed to do something different.

00:05:04.181 --> 00:05:11.541
Q: Was that the first time in your career that you were lost in the fight?

00:05:11.541 --> 00:05:28.635
A: Yes. It wasn't so much that I didn't know what to do,

00:05:28.635 --> 00:05:44.499
but that my body wouldn't react.
