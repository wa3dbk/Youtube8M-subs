Hi, this is Joelle Meijer.

00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:06.150
I will show you how to use the book "The Rainbow
Fish" as a source of inspiration

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:12.950
for a visual arts activity using wax crayons
and watercolours.

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:16.360
This drawing and painting activity is based
on the wonderful book

00:00:16.360 --> 00:00:22.880
The Rainbow Fish, by the author and illustrator
Marcus Pfister.

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:26.210
I started by thinly drawing the outline of
the fish with a pencil

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:32.019
but this step is optional. You can start your
picture with crayons right away.

00:00:32.019 --> 00:00:39.019
I will draw all the important elements of
my picture with crayons.

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.500
I chose to use a blue crayon to draw the outline
of the fish, its fins,

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.210
its scales, the mouth and one eye.

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.370
Then I coloured some details of the fish with
other colours of crayons.

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:58.949
For example, I coloured the pupil of the fish
in black, the mouth yellow,

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:05.949
some scales red and others white. I also drew
white lines on the fins .

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.319
In addition to integrating reading with art
activities, this project can be used

00:01:11.319 --> 00:01:17.399
to talk about science topics such as the physical
appearance of the fish.

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:23.240
Fish have fins to help them balance and swim
in the water. You can also talk about

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:29.770
marine life, plants and other organisms in
the fish's environment.

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:34.959
So you can draw algae and corals of different
colours.

00:01:34.959 --> 00:01:37.439
Still in relation to the science subject,

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:43.060
you can explain to children how fish breath
under water.

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:46.179
With white crayon, you can represent the carbon
dioxide bubbles

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:50.749
that fish reject while breathing.

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:54.659
When you are satisfied with the crayon drawing,
it's time to cover the whole design

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:59.709
with a thin coat of blue paint applied with
a brush.

00:01:59.709 --> 00:02:05.739
What is interesting with this technique is
that the crayon does not absorb the paint.

00:02:05.739 --> 00:02:09.539
The areas of paper that are not covered with
wax absorb the paint

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:12.810
while the crayon drawing retains its colours.

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:19.219
In the story, the Rainbow Fish is covered
with shiny scales of many colours.

00:02:19.219 --> 00:02:24.870
To represent the shimmering, you can colour
the scales using glitter glue pencils.

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.590
To cover the white scales, I used silver glitter
glue

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:33.530
while I used various other colours on the
remaining scales.

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:38.609
In addition to integrating the reading activity
with visual arts and a science lesson,

00:02:38.609 --> 00:02:43.400
this beautiful book also allows you to talk
about sharing.

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:49.810
For young children, it is not always easy
to share but it is something they must learn.

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:52.989
