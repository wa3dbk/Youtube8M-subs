Chad Shepard: Welcome to Pete's RV TV today.
I'm Chad Shepard. We got some exciting stuff

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:12.940
going on here today. We have the Cougar product.
The number one selling brand in the marketplace

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:17.050
and it has been for over fourteen years. So
we're going to see why ... We have Kevin Horoky

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:20.599
from the manufacturer Keystone's number one
Cougar rep is going to take us through this

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:24.140
Cougar product and show us why more people
choose this brand than any other brand out

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:26.480
there.
Kevin Horoky directly from Keystone here to

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.739
show us and tell us why the Cougar retains
its value better than everybody else and why

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:32.689
it's been the best seller for the last fourteen
years.

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:34.649
Welcome Kevin.
Kevin Horoky: Hey, thanks Chad appreciate

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:37.270
having me at your dealership.
Chad Shepard: You got it. Kevin, we are in

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:40.390
the newest floor plan you have out there.
This is ... Can't see it from the video, a

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:43.670
front bed slide in this we're going to show
in a few minutes but plenty of room here.

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:45.260
This is a non-bunk. Which model are we in
now?

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.609
Kevin Horoky: Yeah we're in the Cougar X-Lite
Travel Trailer 30RLI.

00:00:47.609 --> 00:00:50.469
Chad Shepard: Beautiful in here.
Kevin Horoky: It's a rear living with an island

00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:51.929
kitchen.
Chad Shepard: Okay, tell us construction on

00:00:51.929 --> 00:00:54.370
a Cougar a little bit here. We've got the
arched interior ceiling.

00:00:54.370 --> 00:00:58.149
Kevin Horoky: Yeah. What you have is you have
a vaulted ceiling. It's a stamp steel roof

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:02.260
so it's going to create our head room which
we have in here. So a taller gentleman like

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:07.470
myself I still can have the headroom. So a
typical trailer right now is still a flat

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:10.350
roof. So this will give you that natural runoff
and it's a stamp steel construction.

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.520
Chad Shepard: Look at all the extra room we
got here. We got bigger, taller cabinets cause

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:16.910
that's not ... Guys just so you know it is
hotter than a firecracker on the Fourth of

00:01:16.910 --> 00:01:21.360
July in here in this video. So I look like
I'm baking in here it's because I am. But

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:24.770
we're going to talk about this a little bit
more. Beautiful ceiling in here, central air

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:27.460
conditioning, which obviously we don't have
on, a central air conditioner ... Tell us

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:29.640
a little bit more ... What's the furniture
that we have in here Kevin.

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.960
Kevin Horoky: Here the furniture it's a residential
furniture. It's Ashley brand furniture. It's

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:39.200
going to give you a tri-fold sleeper sofa
in this and then your tri-fold sleeper sofa

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.920
is a orthopedic sleep system. So it's going
to be cushiony, it's going to give you a residential

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:44.530
feel.
Chad Shepard: Don't get tricked into buying

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:47.860
a trailer that's going to jack my sofa guys.
This is something that's been upgraded. It's

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:53.080
really, really nice. Probably one of my favorite
features is these push back recliners. This

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.150
is just like what I have in my home.
Kevin Horoky: Yeah, sure it's, it's residential

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:00.000
then you notice too Chad if you get up and
pull the chair forward, where you're sitting

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.700
at [00:02:00] you'll notice that we do put
a outlet in the slide for you.

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.590
Chad Shepard: Can you catch that in the video
there Josh? So we got outlets in the slide

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:08.759
you know you have to run the extension.
Kevin Horoky: You're not running the extension

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:12.310
cord from the kitchen, you know? We thought
of everything when we built this for our customers.

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:14.610
Chad Shepard: Yeah, frameless windows. We
don't have it here in the video but you can

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:17.980
kind of see them on the back. We got them
here on the side. Frameless windows. Little

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:21.330
extra tint in here keeps some of the sun light
out. And plus we get the jalousie look on

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.000
them.
Kevin Horoky: Yeah, the jalousie window and

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.760
then the other thing that you have too Chad
which are nightshades throughout. What you

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.310
have is when those shades are open, I don't
know if we can catch that in the video or

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.660
not, but you do have cross ventilation through
your slide. Which is nice so it's going to

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:40.490
create that flow for you. And then another
thing that we have is we insulated our slides.

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:43.190
Chad Shepard: You got it. Maybe you can catch
this in the video. Josh, can you scoot down

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:47.530
here a little bit? Guys, it's hard to see
it. We can see that silver foil down there.

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:49.750
Kevin, what is that?
Kevin Horoky: That's called Astro Foil Insulation.

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:55.160
It's going, it's going to increase your R
factor. So here, perfect example like today,

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:58.880
we're burning up in here but if we had the
air conditioner running at 72 degrees we want

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:02.810
our slide room to be at 72 degrees. We want
control of the hot, cold exchange and not

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:04.959
have that be at 82 degrees.
Chad Shepard: You know they got some brands

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:08.050
out there ... Guys, they insulate the slide
boxes on these. Would you know the difference

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:12.270
if I didn't tell you? Be careful when you're
buying your next RV. Look for things like

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:14.600
that.
Kevin Horoky: Next thing we have Chad is our

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:20.410
entertainment package. This gives you a 32
inch LED TV. It gives you a Bluetooth stereo

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:24.610
so you can control everything from your phone
when you're outside on the camp ground and

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:28.390
you have your exterior speakers. And then
we also added, the 5000 BTU electric fireplace.

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:32.560
Chad Shepard: Yeah, I see you guys use Greystone.
One of the leading brands in the RV industry.

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:36.790
Puts out a little heat on those hot or cold
days, unlike today, but you don't have to

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:39.990
use your propane all the time. It's really
a nice, nice feature. Bigger fridge in here

00:03:39.990 --> 00:03:41.910
I've noticed too.
Kevin Horoky: Yeah we, we upgraded from the

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:47.280
six cubic foot to now a eight cubic foot refer.
With your freezer, which is nice, you can

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:50.630
store more stuff. How you can tell if you
ever want to know the difference, on a six

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:53.640
cubic foot you only get three on our eight
cubic foot it gives you four.

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:57.400
Chad Shepard: Good point so we got four door
caddies and four shelving on the inside. It

00:03:57.400 --> 00:04:00.920
gives us that extra storage. A nice, nice
upgrade. I really [00:04:00] like this.

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:05.090
Kevin Horoky: Yeah, solid surface counter
tops so it gives you the residential look.

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:08.870
You have an under mount stainless steel sink
with the high rise faucet. And then you also

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:12.110
have a stainless steel package within your
oven and your microwave.

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:13.940
Chad Shepard: High point microwave too I like
that feature.

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:17.160
Kevin Horoky: Chad, if you would, open up
one of the many bank of drawers that you have

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:17.650
there.
Chad Shepard: You got it.

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:20.549
Kevin Horoky: But they're all full extension
ball bearing drawer guide. Did you notice

00:04:20.549 --> 00:04:21.939
the handle that you have on there?
Chad Shepard: Yeah.

00:04:21.939 --> 00:04:26.169
Kevin Horoky: That's a five inch residential
pole versus competition uses a knob or maybe

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:27.479
three inch.
Chad Shepard: Yeah, that's the same one I

00:04:27.479 --> 00:04:30.860
have in my house. Very, very similar style
to what I have in my house. Tell me, really

00:04:30.860 --> 00:04:32.409
quickly what do we have here for lighting
Kevin?

00:04:32.409 --> 00:04:35.909
Kevin Horoky: Yeah. We have LED lights throughout.
The nice thing about our LED lights instead

00:04:35.909 --> 00:04:40.110
of being recessed you can actually control
Chad, left, right or off.

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:42.520
Chad Shepard: Yup.
Kevin Horoky: So, which will help that. And

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:46.889
then you have your feature wall over on this
side. Which is nice too if Josh can get the

00:04:46.889 --> 00:04:49.319
video of it. You have the charging station
that's something that ...

00:04:49.319 --> 00:04:51.580
Chad Shepard: Charging station down here.
It's hard to catch in the video but we got

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:53.439
a Cougar remote too. Tell me a little bit
about this Kevin.

00:04:53.439 --> 00:04:58.009
Kevin Horoky: Yeah, the Cougar remote's real
nice. It's real handy to set up your camper.

00:04:58.009 --> 00:05:03.520
Type in your code, you can control all of
your slide outs, you can control your awning,

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:07.189
you can control your scare light, and then
the nice thing that you can control is your

00:05:07.189 --> 00:05:10.419
power front, rear stabilizer jacks.
Chad Shepard: You can do it right from one

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:11.199
stop.
Kevin Horoky: Exactly.

00:05:11.199 --> 00:05:12.999
Chad Shepard: It makes it really, really handy
[crosstalk 00:05:13].

00:05:12.999 --> 00:05:14.939
Kevin Horoky: You're not running back and
forth into the camper.

00:05:14.939 --> 00:05:19.419
Chad Shepard: Okay. I've noticed this has
a lot of vinyl flooring, bow flooring to be

00:05:19.419 --> 00:05:20.729
exact.
Kevin Horoky: Bow floor, Leno, you know it's

00:05:20.729 --> 00:05:25.550
a great brand. Keystone uses it throughout.
So it gives you two years against cold cracking.

00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:28.080
And then if you look at the residential of
it it looks awesome.

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:31.300
Chad Shepard: Yeah, I agree. The Cougar obviously
has gone through some changes here in the

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:34.430
last twelve months. You guys have done a lot
of things right. Registers that are just like

00:05:34.430 --> 00:05:36.469
what I have in my home.
Kevin Horoky: Yeah, residential heat ducts

00:05:36.469 --> 00:05:39.370
versus a plastic heat duct.
Chad Shepard: Mm-hmm (affirmative). Speakers

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:43.509
in the ceiling, surround sound effects, a
lot of great things. Hardwood kitchen tables,

00:05:43.509 --> 00:05:47.469
true dinette so you can go ... Obviously the
Keystone has a couple different options. We

00:05:47.469 --> 00:05:49.909
can go with a booth dinette that makes into
a bed.

00:05:49.909 --> 00:05:53.740
Kevin Horoky: You can go with the booth dinette.
This one here on this package the 30RLI and

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:57.909
this floor plan we did put in the free standing
table and four chairs. But the four chairs

00:05:57.909 --> 00:06:01.900
too you do have storage under there. We keep
[00:06:00] talking about that letter S as

00:06:01.900 --> 00:06:05.139
far as storage, well here we like to think
we're best in class in storage.

00:06:05.139 --> 00:06:09.909
Chad Shepard: I don't doubt that at all and
you can tell guys in non-bunkhouse coaches

00:06:09.909 --> 00:06:12.300
the free standing dinette it think has been
most popular.

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:14.939
Kevin Horoky: Absolutely, yeah.
Chad Shepard: We've got a great bedroom in

00:06:14.939 --> 00:06:17.559
this. This is their brand new floor plan we
talked about so we're going to cut right here

00:06:17.559 --> 00:06:20.659
real quick. We're going to take a quick walk
up in that bedroom and show you why this is

00:06:20.659 --> 00:06:23.969
probably the nicest half ton towable travel
trailer I've ever seen.

00:06:23.969 --> 00:06:27.860
I love the front bedroom on this 30RLI Kevin.
You guys have done a wonderful job with it.

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:30.749
Tell me some of the features and why people
are starting to choose this floor plan.

00:06:30.749 --> 00:06:35.740
Kevin Horoky: Well this nice thing is we talk
about Cougar and the Ex-Lite series being

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:37.009
half-ton tow-able.
Chad Shepard: Yup.

00:06:37.009 --> 00:06:41.309
Kevin Horoky: Now, we integrated for couples
a bedroom slide. So it's easier for them to

00:06:41.309 --> 00:06:45.569
get around and then you know we added you
know the nice mattress in here. It's a Cougar

00:06:45.569 --> 00:06:50.050
platinum series which is a orthopedic sleep
system so we're not changing that. You have

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:54.759
a ton of storage up here and a, and a, and
a bed slide coach. I mean look at the storage

00:06:54.759 --> 00:06:58.719
that you have here in your wardrobe. You can
look at your dresser and it's a sixty inch

00:06:58.719 --> 00:07:03.430
dresser. You have full extension ball bearing
drawer guides. I mean you have four drawers

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:07.770
that pull out. You have another storage drawer
there and then look at the overhead cabinets

00:07:07.770 --> 00:07:10.210
that you have in here.
Chad Shepard: It's really, really nice. And

00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:13.990
those are ... Guys those are solid door wood.
That's not paneling that's built into there

00:07:13.990 --> 00:07:17.869
like some of the, some of the off brands are
using in it. We look up here at the front

00:07:17.869 --> 00:07:23.349
bedroom. We've got windows on both sides that
open up so we can let ventilation cross [inaudible

00:07:23.349 --> 00:07:24.800
00:07:23]. We got a window over here on the
other side.

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:26.800
Kevin Horoky: [00:07:25] cabinets.
Chad Shepard: Oh yeah you're right.

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:31.339
Kevin Horoky: Over that and then you also
... We left for our couples we left the LCD

00:07:31.339 --> 00:07:36.430
for you can mount your bracket TV here or
you can just plug it in and set it right here

00:07:36.430 --> 00:07:38.740
on this big sixty inch dresser.
Chad Shepard: That's really, really nice.

00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:42.189
Guys arched ceiling in here it makes it feel
huge in here. I mean this is a half ton towable

00:07:42.189 --> 00:07:46.249
travel trailer with a ton of space on here.
Kevin I want to go talk about some of the

00:07:46.249 --> 00:07:49.639
great features on the outside of this. Let's
take a walk outside, we'll show why people

00:07:49.639 --> 00:07:51.889
... They love the outside as Coach. Let's
show them why.
