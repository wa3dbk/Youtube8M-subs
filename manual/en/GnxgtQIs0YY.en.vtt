00:00:10.499 --> 00:00:13.999
Right, so what I'm gonna do now is I'm going to make a beautiful green bean salad

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:18.590
I'm using the French style beans. 
Just look at these colors: the green, the yellow, the black.

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:22.659
You can do it with the straight green ones if you want.I'm going to put them into a pot of 

00:00:22.659 --> 00:00:28.449
really fast boiling water and,  you know, if you've got a nice lid on there it will probably take about four

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:33.440
five minutes to cook until, again, they're not squeaky but they're nicely cooked. I wanna season that water

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:35.240
nicely

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:37.410
just like pasta really

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:40.820
it's going to start taking in some of that flavor 

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:45.740
so you don't want it to be just straight water. I've got a fillet of beef here - fillet in my belief is the only cut to use with this carpaccio.

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:49.220
So, what I want to do is just season 

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:53.790
the meat and the board with a little pepper, I want to get some salt 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:57.000
on and around the beef and then I've got some thyme here,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.600
then just roll it up like that

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.989
some will fall off it's not the end of the
world. Now once you've done that all I need is 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:04.600
a little bit of olive oil in a pan.

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:07.470
I want to just sort of sear this meat for 

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:11.090
twenty seconds. It's not about cooking the meat. 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:15.770
It's about sort of encrusting that beautiful thyme and salt and pepper

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:19.750
into the outside of that meat.

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:20.910
That is enough. 

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:23.310
And I'll put that here. 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.940
I want to make a lovely, sort of French style, dressing. So I'll get a good old 

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:29.270
couple of teaspoons 

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:30.979
of mustard

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:32.380
shallot

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:38.900
and there's no place for any chunky bits of onion in this salad at all. So about

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:43.210
a tablespoon worth of shallots for about
four people

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:48.810
about four tablespoons of extra virgin olive
oil, some nice vinegar  - about a tablespoon and a half,

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.840
pinch of salt, pepper.

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:59.280
I want to herb it up a bit, parsley is pretty damned good. 

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.190
Get thatinto your dressing. 

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:04.110
Give it a stir. 

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.300
Lovely. 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:09.229
Good, nice flavors. 
Now

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:11.079
look at the lovely color

00:02:11.079 --> 00:02:12.409
absolutely delicious.  

00:02:12.409 --> 00:02:14.560
With a little bit of excess water

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.079
you can let them fall in the dressing

00:02:17.079 --> 00:02:21.509
let those cool down and then with this carpaccio slice it 

00:02:21.509 --> 00:02:25.639
kind of as thin as you without wrecking the shape of it and I use the sort of 

00:02:25.639 --> 00:02:29.669
the base of the knife, like that,use the back of the knife. Can you see what I'm doing to rub it? 

00:02:29.669 --> 00:02:32.379
Now all of a sudden it's about

00:02:32.379 --> 00:02:36.729
the thickness of two beer mats and you know 

00:02:36.729 --> 00:02:40.789
it's kind of straggly and it's just sort of holding on to itself

00:02:40.789 --> 00:02:43.759
and that is really cool like that. 

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:46.789
Get yourself a nice

00:02:46.789 --> 00:02:52.759
load of your beans, just let them fall in sort of a natural pile

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:54.479
get yourself a nice little bit of this beautiful dressing

00:02:54.479 --> 00:02:56.589
and put that around the beans

00:02:56.589 --> 00:02:59.049
because that is just absolutely top stuff

00:02:59.049 --> 00:02:59.629
and then it's finished.
