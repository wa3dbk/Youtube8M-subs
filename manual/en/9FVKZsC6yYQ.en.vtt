00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:10.970
SimCity
Two Thousand Thirteen

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:14.880
Couldn't wait to get this on my machine
Paid 60 bucks for a premium game

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:16.430
Then not enough servers?

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:17.430
That's fucking lame!

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:19.570
Ya'd think they'd have learned from Diablo
3

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:21.170
Error 37 was enough for me

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:23.360
The game looks great
it's a pity it sucks

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:25.570
Why are there lines of garbage trucks?

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:27.410
Traffic
it's U-Turn central

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:29.460
Buses
they're completely mental

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.500
Fire Trucks
they just stop workin'

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.540
Man now half my city is burnin'

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.660
Abandoned houses out of control
I spend all my time playing whack-a-mole

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:39.640
Parks
they're all filled with tramps

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:41.649
Maps
the size of postage stamps

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:43.730
Population
the numbers fudged

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:45.859
Gridlock
the cars won't budge

00:00:45.859 --> 00:00:47.600
Factories abandoned
they got no tech

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:49.830
My students have gone missing
What the heck?

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:51.789
I'm puttin' in the hours to stay on track

00:00:51.789 --> 00:00:54.100
Thing's are looking better
Oh shit I got a rollback

00:00:54.100 --> 00:01:04.739
This games drivin' me berserk
Does anything in this fucking game work?

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:16.590
Change up
to Tropico 5

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:18.180
Military Dictator
Trying to surive

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.330
Things are lookin' great but I need a break

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:22.270
I'll just save the game
Oh big mistake

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:26.770
Now half my buildings won't complete
My goddam army has gone to sleep

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:30.770
All that time and now it falls
Penultimo you can suck my balls

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:36.960
Fuck it .. I'll build castles instead
Big strong walls so ya don't get dead

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.040
Towers full of archers
rain death and destruction

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.100
A guaranteed win
For this master of construction

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:43.000
Wait a minute
What the fuck was that?

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.090
Did I really see that
Am I going mad?

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:47.400
Enemy troops that can walk through walls?

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:48.400
Holy shit!

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:49.490
Am I trippin' balls?

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:52.560
Just another game that's gonna end in disaster
Doesn't make no difference if you're novice

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:53.560
or a master

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:55.810
No strategy can save you from this shit
