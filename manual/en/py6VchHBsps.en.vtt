00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:05.110
How to Get Rid of a Pimple Fast.

00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:09.019
Don’t let a dermatological disaster get
you down.

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:11.930
Here are a half-dozen ways to zap those zits
fast!

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:20.350
You will need Aspirin A cotton swab Lemon
juice Instant oatmeal Honey An egg Manuka

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:26.480
honey Non-gel toothpaste Tea tree oil or witch
hazel (optional) (optional) Eye drops for

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.589
red eyes (optional) (optional) Hydrogen peroxide
(optional) (optional) and dermatologist (optional)

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:31.589
(optional).

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:32.589
Step 1.

00:00:32.589 --> 00:00:33.730
Resist the urge to squeeze a pimple.

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:39.140
You might push bacteria further into your
skin, causing an infection that could lead

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:40.199
to scarring.

00:00:40.199 --> 00:00:44.600
Keep tea tree oil or witch hazel in the house
so that as soon as you feel a pimple starting

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:46.429
to bloom, you can dab some on.

00:00:46.429 --> 00:00:51.300
Both have anti-inflammatory and anti-bacterial
properties that will help nip a zit in the

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.300
bud.

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:53.390
Step 2.

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:55.370
Woke up with a full-blown blemish?

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:59.930
Crush an aspirin, mix it with a few drops
of water, soak the tip of a cotton swab in

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:02.969
it, and hold the swab against the zit for
about 15 seconds.

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:07.070
It won’t make the pimple disappear, but
it can reduce redness.

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:11.180
Eye drops--the kind for bloodshot eyes--work
too.

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:12.180
Step 3.

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.661
Look in your cupboard: If you have lemon juice,
instant oatmeal, honey, and an egg, you can

00:01:16.661 --> 00:01:20.510
make a paste out of a teaspoon of each and
some of the egg white.

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:25.490
Wash your face, smear the paste on the pimple,
leave it on for 20 minutes, and rinse with

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:26.490
warm water.

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:28.340
This should further reduce the redness.

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:33.520
If you have hydrogen peroxide, dab some on
the pimple first to disinfect it.

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:34.600
Step 4.

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.670
Now that you’ve stopped the pimple in its
tracks, it’s time to blast it off the face

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.000
of … your face.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.070
Pick up some manuka honey at a health-food
store, smear it on a bandage, and stick it

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:46.290
on your pimple before bed.

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.670
The zit will be far less noticeable by morning.

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:50.890
Step 5.

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:56.240
If you can't track down manuka honey, take
some toothpaste--the paste kind, not the gel

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.020
kind--and dab a pea-size amount on your pimple.

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:03.230
When you wake up, the zit should be a shriveled
shell of its former self.

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:07.270
Take care not to spread it on the skin surrounding
the pimple, or that will dry out, too.

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:11.560
Forget that movie that touted glass cleaner
as a zit remedy.

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:12.560
It doesn’t work.

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:13.560
Step 6.

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:18.440
If a gi-normous zit is threatening to ruin
a big day and no home remedies have helped,

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:27.070
visit a dermatologist, who can make it disappear--sometimes
within hours--with a single injection of cortisone.

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:34.550
Did you know Though greasy foods are often
blamed, acne is actually due in large part

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:35.610
to genetics.
