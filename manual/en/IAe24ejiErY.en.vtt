00:00:00.158 --> 00:00:02.453
- One time I had a Belgian waffle that

00:00:02.453 --> 00:00:04.299
had chocolate drizzled on it.

00:00:04.299 --> 00:00:06.276
And that was in Belgium.

00:00:06.276 --> 00:00:07.504
And that's it.

00:00:16.175 --> 00:00:17.322
- [Voiceover] Well, It's in Spanish.

00:00:17.322 --> 00:00:19.349
(reads in Spanish)

00:00:20.827 --> 00:00:21.353
- Ooh!

00:00:21.353 --> 00:00:23.550
- I picture being in a
South American countryside.

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.267
- You know, like an old, like brick house.

00:00:25.267 --> 00:00:26.518
- There's something
about this chocolate that

00:00:26.518 --> 00:00:27.811
takes me back to childhood.

00:00:27.811 --> 00:00:28.647
- I'm going to guess this is from --

00:00:28.647 --> 00:00:29.563
- El Salvador.

00:00:29.563 --> 00:00:30.397
- Argentina.

00:00:30.397 --> 00:00:31.148
- Mexico.

00:00:31.148 --> 00:00:31.840
- Mexico.

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:33.942
- Oh my God.

00:00:33.942 --> 00:00:34.818
- Yes!

00:00:34.818 --> 00:00:35.392
- Boom!

00:00:35.392 --> 00:00:37.422
- I've had this before.

00:00:37.422 --> 00:00:40.449
- Oh, that's such another
satisfying little snapped.

00:00:40.449 --> 00:00:41.450
- Woah, what the (beep)?

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:42.099
- Uh-uh.

00:00:42.099 --> 00:00:43.952
- Oh God. that's dark chocolate.

00:00:43.952 --> 00:00:45.412
- That just hit like a
whole 'nother dimension.

00:00:45.412 --> 00:00:46.966
- When I bite into it I envision --

00:00:46.966 --> 00:00:48.042
- The rainforest.

00:00:48.042 --> 00:00:50.041
- With the birds kind of flying
around, and they're like --

00:00:50.041 --> 00:00:51.460
- People wearing lederhosen.

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:52.169
- In Germany.

00:00:52.169 --> 00:00:52.580
- Germany.

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:53.062
- Poland.

00:00:53.062 --> 00:00:53.727
- Brazilian.

00:00:53.727 --> 00:00:54.398
- Ooh!

00:00:54.398 --> 00:00:55.258
- I'm close!

00:00:55.258 --> 00:00:56.009
- Of course.

00:00:56.009 --> 00:00:58.467
- Argh, you're playing mind games with me.

00:00:58.467 --> 00:00:59.384
- Oh gosh.

00:00:59.384 --> 00:01:01.553
- Oh my gosh! Wait, this is a good one.

00:01:01.553 --> 00:01:03.096
- 'Cause this one has,
like, a little design on it.

00:01:03.096 --> 00:01:03.930
- Mmm!

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:04.973
- Fancy.

00:01:04.973 --> 00:01:06.349
- It has some kind of like
weird filling inside of it.

00:01:06.349 --> 00:01:07.017
- Hazelnut.

00:01:07.017 --> 00:01:07.998
- This makes me think of, like --

00:01:07.998 --> 00:01:10.974
- A mountain top, a
little, like, yodeling hut.

00:01:10.974 --> 00:01:11.589
- This is definitely from --

00:01:11.589 --> 00:01:12.206
- Germany.

00:01:12.206 --> 00:01:12.713
- From Belgium.

00:01:12.713 --> 00:01:13.186
- Italy.

00:01:13.186 --> 00:01:13.569
- France.

00:01:13.569 --> 00:01:14.900
- Switzerland!

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:15.859
- It's so peaceful over there.

00:01:15.859 --> 00:01:16.610
It's in the chocolate,

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:18.069
you could taste the
freedom in the chocolate.

00:01:18.069 --> 00:01:19.279
- What lovely packaging.

00:01:19.279 --> 00:01:22.616
- Word, this thing is gold, son!

00:01:22.616 --> 00:01:25.094
- Every bar of chocolate
is a golden ticket.

00:01:25.094 --> 00:01:25.869
- Oh my god!

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:26.745
- What is that?

00:01:26.745 --> 00:01:27.496
- I picture --

00:01:27.496 --> 00:01:28.705
- An oil refinery.

00:01:28.705 --> 00:01:30.038
- A cloudy sky.

00:01:30.038 --> 00:01:30.750
- Jail.

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.459
- The place is hot, the place is swampy.

00:01:32.459 --> 00:01:33.376
- Russia.

00:01:33.376 --> 00:01:33.947
- Russia.

00:01:33.947 --> 00:01:34.711
- Finland.

00:01:34.711 --> 00:01:36.395
- Oh, I was going to say Vietnam!

00:01:36.395 --> 00:01:37.255
- Saigon!

00:01:37.255 --> 00:01:39.001
- I'm so pissed I didn't say Vietnam.

00:01:39.001 --> 00:01:40.744
I'm just thinking with
my gut, or my palate,

00:01:40.744 --> 00:01:42.010
if you will, next time around.

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:43.929
- Ha, Pineapple Lumps!

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:46.394
- Oh! No, that looks fun.

00:01:46.394 --> 00:01:48.433
- That's like chocolate and bubble gum,

00:01:48.433 --> 00:01:50.144
like if they had a beautiful child.

00:01:50.144 --> 00:01:51.020
- South Africa.

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.526
- Brazil.

00:01:51.526 --> 00:01:52.219
- Australia.

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:53.855
- New Zealand?

00:01:53.855 --> 00:01:54.898
What?

00:01:54.898 --> 00:01:55.774
- Wow!

00:01:55.774 --> 00:01:58.331
- (beep) I've got to book
a flight to New Zealand.

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:00.331
- My favorite chocolate by far

00:02:00.331 --> 00:02:01.988
is the pineapple New Zealand one.

00:02:01.988 --> 00:02:02.740
- I think the Pineapple Lumps.

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:03.573
- The Swiss.

00:02:03.573 --> 00:02:04.574
- The Switzerland one.

00:02:04.574 --> 00:02:06.245
- New Zealand's Pineapple Lumps.

00:02:06.245 --> 00:02:07.358
- The Swiss one.

00:02:07.358 --> 00:02:09.371
- The Venezuelan one was
definitely my favorite.

00:02:09.371 --> 00:02:10.331
- I'm still eating it right now.

00:02:10.331 --> 00:02:13.167
- I think chocolate seems
to be a universal language

00:02:13.167 --> 00:02:14.877
that everybody can appreciate.

00:02:14.877 --> 00:02:17.003
- Chocolate's the best, no
matter where it comes from.

00:02:17.003 --> 00:02:19.005
So, everybody, just

00:02:19.005 --> 00:02:21.642
keep doing what you're
doing and make chocolate.
