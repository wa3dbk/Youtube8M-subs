Hi, my name is Anais and we're here at Bounce
Back.

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:16.150
We will be learning how a basketball bounces.

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:20.580
What we have right here is, exactly that,
a basketball and what's going on is that right

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:25.390
here, right now, when I'm holding it that's
potential energy which means stored energy.

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:28.650
When I bounce the ball and move it, that's
kinetic energy.

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.260
We're gonna learn on how the energy transfers
to make the basketball bounce.

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:36.750
So my energy is going to be transferred onto
the ball, from the ball to the floor, and

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.360
then from the floor back onto the ball.

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:44.140
So what's happening when the ball hits the
floor is that the ball's energy is being transferred

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:45.480
onto the floor.

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.570
That same energy is being reflected back onto
the ball which squishes it and then the ball

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:53.910
wants to return back to its normal shape so
it springs right back up.

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:56.640
Bryant: Hey, so the same thing happens with
the soccer ball.

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:03.150
My foot is gonna kick the ball; its energy
going into the ball causing it to squish,

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:06.680
then springing back out and propelling it
to motion.

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:09.140
Alyssa: Same thing happens with a volleyball.

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:14.780
Whenever I hit my arms against a volleyball,
it will squish, then pop back into shape and

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:18.450
hopefully sending the ball up and over the
net.

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.810
Now let's learn how a ball bounces on a soft
surface.

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.840
Now when I throw the ball, will it bounce
back to me?

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:25.840
Let's see.

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:29.601
It doesn't really bounce back right back up
to me, so what's happening is when the ball

00:01:29.601 --> 00:01:34.420
hits the soft surface is that instead of the
energy being reflected back onto the ball,

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:39.530
most of it is absorbed by the soft surface,
so instead of squishing the ball and compressing

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:43.409
it, it squishes the floor, causing it not
to bounce as high.

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.670
I'm Anais and thanks for watching our video
