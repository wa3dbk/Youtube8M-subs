00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.620
Unless, of course, you count Spencer...

Huh?

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.600
Huh. It's only a pony. Shoo, shoo!

Kill it, kill it!

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:18.940
(groans) (splat) (horse whines) Huh?

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:28.480
(panting) What on Sodor even was that? (shudders)

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:31.060
Hmm?

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:37.140
Hey Gordon, have you seen my little -
