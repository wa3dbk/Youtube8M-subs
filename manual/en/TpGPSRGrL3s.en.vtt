00:00:04.535 --> 00:00:07.873
Thank you. You two wait outside.

00:00:07.956 --> 00:00:10.750
He's got a history, Doctor.
Violence.

00:00:10.875 --> 00:00:13.128
Antisocial six.

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.758
Repeated violations of
the Permanent Emergency Code.

00:00:16.881 --> 00:00:20.511
Insolence. Defiance.
Disregard of authority.

00:00:20.552 --> 00:00:22.679
Doing 25 to life.

00:00:22.722 --> 00:00:24.973
I don't think he's gonna hurt us.

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:28.227
You aren't gonna hurt us,
are you, Mr. Cole?

00:00:29.311 --> 00:00:31.273
No, sir.

00:00:43.202 --> 00:00:46.413
Why don't you sit down, Mr. Cole?

00:01:09.021 --> 00:01:13.859
We appreciate your volunteering.
You're a very good observer.

00:01:13.943 --> 00:01:17.237
Thank you.
We have
a very advanced program.

00:01:17.321 --> 00:01:21.491
Something very different.
Opportunity
to reduce your sentence.

00:01:21.576 --> 00:01:23.744
And possibly play an important role...

00:01:23.787 --> 00:01:26.372
in returning the human race
to the surface of the Earth.

00:01:26.455 --> 00:01:30.334
We want tough-minded people.
Strong mentally.

00:01:32.963 --> 00:01:37.593
We've had some misfortunes
with... unstable types.

00:01:37.633 --> 00:01:41.847
For a man
in your position, an opportunity.

00:01:41.847 --> 00:01:44.808
Not to volunteer
could be a real mistake.

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:47.603
Definitely a mistake.
