00:00:08.649 --> 00:00:13.639
Welcome to ItalianCakes. In this
video we show you our recipe of

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:15.809
sponge cake with hazelnuts.

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:21.580
We start by separating in two
different containers 8 egg whites

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:22.659
and 8 egg yolks

00:00:22.659 --> 00:00:29.659
that will work separately.

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:42.390
In the container with the yolks we add
200 grams of powdered sugar.

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:47.800
We mix well with

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:50.970
the blender or the planetary,

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:55.050
when the two ingredients will be well
amalgamated

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.780
we add

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.390
the juice of a lemon.

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:07.390
and then continue to blend
for about 5 minutes.

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:26.350
We add 250 grams of flour
hazelnuts

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:33.350
and mix for about 30 seconds.

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:48.590
Now let's go and whisk the egg whites.

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:58.510
We mount them well in the snow

00:01:58.510 --> 00:02:05.510
adding a pinch of salt.

00:02:37.439 --> 00:02:40.549
Now let's go back to the first compound

00:02:40.549 --> 00:02:47.549
and let's add 3 tablespoons
of grated bread,

00:02:52.359 --> 00:02:59.359
half a spoonful of honey,

00:03:00.039 --> 00:03:07.039
4 or 6 drops of almond flavor,

00:03:09.869 --> 00:03:16.649
a teaspoon of baking powder
sieved.

00:03:16.649 --> 00:03:18.659
Now we can add,

00:03:18.659 --> 00:03:22.209
in 2 or 3 shots, the albumen

00:03:22.209 --> 00:03:25.139
and mix gently

00:03:25.139 --> 00:03:29.200
with spoon or a spatula.

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:33.500
As the egg white is incorporated

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:37.500
add another portion.

00:03:37.500 --> 00:04:00.700
In this way we will have a dough
softer.

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:19.000
Now we pour everything into a buttered pan
and with a baking paper bottom.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.000
The baking paper is buttered
both below and above

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:30.500
Because this type of sponge cake
it sticks easily to the pan.

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:35.500
Pour all the dough

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:49.000
and then with a spatula or a spoon

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:55.180
let's go to place the dough well

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:58.009
so that the sponge cake comes

00:04:58.009 --> 00:05:04.289
perfectly leveled.

00:05:04.289 --> 00:05:08.110
We inform in a preheated oven

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:14.439
at about 170-180 degrees Celsius per
about 45 minutes

00:05:14.439 --> 00:05:17.629
checking the correct cooking with one

00:05:17.629 --> 00:05:23.930
toothpick and checking that the edges of the
sponge cake is removed from the pan.

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:25.979
