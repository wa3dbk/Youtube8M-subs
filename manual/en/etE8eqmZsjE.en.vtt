00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.710
Hello im back again. Yes you just can't seem to get rid of me.

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:07.330
I have the taste for making videos. 

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:14.330
So keep on giving me those nice messages and i'll keep on making them. Today im going to make something different, its not an easter treat or a christmas treat it is something

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:21.830
You can have all year round. Especially on those warm summer days.

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:23.589
Now what i like to have on a hot summer day

00:00:23.589 --> 00:00:28.210
is an ice block, who doesn't? But I'm going to make something different and not just

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:30.849
a normal ice block. 

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:34.649
So join me today as i make some gummy bear ice blocks. Yum!

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:44.280
So what you need to make

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:45.280
you gummy bear

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:46.850
ice block / icy poles

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:51.190
Gummy bears. You can smell the sweetness coming from 

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:53.380
that packet i just opened 

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:55.380
They smell yum.

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:57.609
You need an ice block tray

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:04.420
I just have a four because these are really sweet  and not something you want to have

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:07.380
all the time. But trust me 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:10.820
on a really hot day they are fantastic. With your gummy bears 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:16.530
place them evenly into

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:22.450
your ice block tray. Don't fill it up to high.

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:25.790
Not all the way to the brim. 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:27.980
Just enough so you

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:29.780
use all the gummy bears

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:34.260
So for that four ice blocks

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:38.880
Thats just used one packet of gummy bears. Not to top it up I'm going to pour

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:45.880
lemonade in them. You can also use Sprite. The reason why im using lemonade or sprite is because its clear so then their frozen

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:52.659
the gummy bears

00:01:52.659 --> 00:01:54.170
really stand out

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:56.310
pour it slowly 

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.960
Because you don't want it to fizz up and over flow.

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:03.399
now pop on

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:07.820
your lids

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:10.999
another reason why not to fill

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:13.999
with the gummy bears 

00:02:13.999 --> 00:02:15.719
to the top

00:02:15.719 --> 00:02:20.519
is because your lids will not fit on properly 

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:24.419
Now we place them in the freezer and i'll show you when their ready. 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:30.919
Now they have been in the freezer for just over an hour

00:02:30.919 --> 00:02:34.979
When you take them out rinse them under some

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:41.979
cold water, don't use hot water because you don't want to melt them.  And then they should just slide out like so.

00:02:42.409 --> 00:02:44.549
mmmm look at that

00:02:44.549 --> 00:02:46.439
how good does that look.

00:02:47.999 --> 00:02:50.549
Let me try it

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:55.930
yum

00:02:55.930 --> 00:02:59.700
So please make these at home. They are simply delicious 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:03.589
