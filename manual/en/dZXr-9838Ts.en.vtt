Hi Food Tubers, thank you so much for all
your lovely comments and questions on all

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:13.369
my other videos.

00:00:13.369 --> 00:00:16.750
Today I'm going to be making hit 'n' run sticky
tray baked chicken.

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:22.160
It's from Jamie's book Save With Jamie and
it's simple, it's affordable, it's easy to

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.070
make and your family are going to absolutely
love it!

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:30.710
This dish serves four people and comes in
at just under Â£2 per person.

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:34.570
So here we've got six boneless and skinless
chicken thighs.

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:40.030
Four medium to large ripe tomatoes, a yellow
pepper, a red pepper two red onion, some garlic

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:41.470
and some fresh thyme.

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:46.270
Some olive oil and some balsamic vinegar,
some smoked paprika, some salt and pepper.

00:00:46.270 --> 00:00:51.700
Equipment wise, a roasting tray, a chopping
board not forgetting a cheeky cooks tip of

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:54.180
a damp cloth underneath to stop it from moving
around.

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:56.620
A nice sharp knife and a bowl for our rubbish.

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:05.660
No let's start by taking our tomatoes and
we're going to quarter these.

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:08.600
Once they start to cook really slowly, the
flavour will start to concentrate and they'll

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:14.690
get really sweet and almost jammy and they;ll
make some lovely mopping up juices.

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:20.450
Now take our lovely peppers, it doesn't really
matter how you chop the peppers but this white

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:25.060
part, the membrane, is quite bitter so it
would be nice to take it out.

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:30.979
I mean it won't hurt to leave it in, if you're
in a rush but I always take it out.

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:37.000
And then we're just going to cut this up into
nice, even bite sized chunks.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.880
Put them in the tray as well.

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:45.200
Now these peppers are quite pretty looking
but you know like when you go to the supermarket

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:51.520
and you see the brand value bag of pepper
that's what I buy, they're not as pretty as

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.520
the others but they taste just as good.

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:54.900
It's win, win all round!

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:58.670
So we've got our pepper in there and now two
red onions.

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:03.170
Now because we're going to cut these into
wedges, I'm not going to cut the root off

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:06.150
completely.

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:07.460
The root is still in place.

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:13.950
So when we roast it, this little bit here
this root will keep it together so we have

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.659
nice big chunks.

00:02:17.659 --> 00:02:23.060
You could use normal white onions, but when
you sue the red it makes the colour come to

00:02:23.060 --> 00:02:26.109
life and it makes it looks a little bit posh
as well.

00:02:26.109 --> 00:02:32.170
Like you'd get in some bistro somewhere rather
than in my flat in hackney.

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:40.810
Now, we're going to get three nice big fat
cloves of garlic, smash it a little bit.

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:47.290
When you roast garlic in the skin it goes
from being really harsh and strong to being

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:52.409
really sticky and sweet and all caramelised
and really, really delicious.

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:56.659
Now we';re going to move onto the chicken
thighs.

00:02:56.659 --> 00:03:00.989
Chicken thighs are usually looked over the
lesser part of the meat because everyone is

00:03:00.989 --> 00:03:02.949
always interested in the breast.

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:07.969
For me chicken thighs are delicious, they,
they do a little bit more work than the breast,

00:03:07.969 --> 00:03:12.180
they're a lot cheaper and they taste fantastic.

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.099
Wash our hands.

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:19.559
A nice generous seasoning of salt, and pepper.

00:03:19.559 --> 00:03:22.620
And then we're got one teaspoon of smoked
paprika.

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:27.409
Now this is what's going to give us the colour
and the flavour as well.

00:03:27.409 --> 00:03:31.360
Now we need two tablespoons of olive oil.

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:36.469
Now my tablespoons, judging by the comments
on my other videos so a lot bigger than some

00:03:36.469 --> 00:03:37.629
of you's.

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:39.600
But if you want to use more, use more.

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:42.349
If you want to use less, use less.

00:03:42.349 --> 00:03:50.930
Two tablespoons of balsamic vinegar and most
importantly not forgetting our fresh thyme.

00:03:50.930 --> 00:03:55.180
SO you need a good few sprigs.

00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:57.489
About 15grams.

00:03:57.489 --> 00:03:58.999
Now for the fun bit.

00:03:58.999 --> 00:04:05.299
We're going to toss it all together to make
sure very little piece is covered in this

00:04:05.299 --> 00:04:08.749
seasoning of paprika, olive oil, balsamic
vinegar.

00:04:08.749 --> 00:04:20.239
And you know then that when it's cooked, everything
is going to taste delicious.

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:24.090
You don't want the chicken to be underneath
all the vegetables.

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:28.741
It will be nicer if all the chicken is sticking
out, because it will be all sticking out and

00:04:28.741 --> 00:04:29.741
golden.

00:04:29.741 --> 00:04:35.300
Now I've preheated an oven to 180 degrees
Celsius that's 350 degrees Fahrenheit or gas

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:36.300
mark four.

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:41.710
We'er going to put this in there for about
an hour.

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:45.970
So once this goes in the oven, you can put
a wash on, have a coffee, read the paper,

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:47.850
put your feet up for five minutes.

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:50.610
It is literally a dish that cooks itself.

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:54.130
Now look at this.

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:59.669
The chicken is all nice and golden the onions
are caramelised and sticky, the tomatoes have

00:04:59.669 --> 00:05:02.000
gone like jammy and concentrated.

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.620
It's so amazing.

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:08.840
I'm going to serve it with a green salad and
some nice crusty bread.

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:12.180
It smells absolutely brilliant.

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:17.069
now if you can mere and look at these onions
we left the root on.

00:05:17.069 --> 00:05:21.830
If we didn't we would have these all in single
bits, but because the root is here holding

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:25.710
them together we have a nice wadge.

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:31.759
There you have it, hit and run sticky tray
baked chicken with a nice green salad and

00:05:31.759 --> 00:05:32.770
crusty bread.

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:37.590
