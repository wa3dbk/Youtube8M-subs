00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:11.990
There’s no specific formula for how
to pursue a career in wildlife photography

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:14.149
and field science.

00:00:14.149 --> 00:00:16.990
Everybody has to find their own way.

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:18.510
The most important thing

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.689
for me is that you need to be 
completely passionate about your work.

00:00:23.689 --> 00:00:25.740
It’s more of a lifestyle

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.090
than a job.

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:32.910
My name is Tim Laman.

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.450
I'm a field biologist and 
a wildlife photographer.

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:40.180
I live in Lexington, 
Massachusetts, near Boston,

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:42.850
and I work all over the world. 
But I especially

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:47.190
spend a lot of time going to the
tropical rainforest regions of the world

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:47.910
such as the Amazon, 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:56.150
and especially, New Guinea 
and Indonesia.

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:58.030
I grew up in Japan.

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:01.090
I went to Japanese public school.

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:06.000
I can remember that when I was in first and 
second grade, I had a small pet turtle.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.740
And as part of a school exercise,

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:15.740
we were to write poems about something, and I
wrote a poem in Japanese about my pet turtle.

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:19.790
And my poem was, well, 
it was selected to be published in the

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:25.190
local newspaper there.

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.444
So I guess my first publication

00:01:34.444 --> 00:01:36.000
was this little poem I wrote 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
about my pet turtle in second grade.

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:44.970
I think I really got

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:47.890
intrigued with bird photography because

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:50.710
birds are challenging.  
They’re not  easy -

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:54.430
there's flight, interesting behavior, color.

00:01:54.430 --> 00:02:00.000
There’s lots of aspects to bird photography 
that are a little different than other kinds of wildlife.

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:05.060
I guess I like the challenge of it, as well
as the beauty, and just, you know, 

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:09.039
being out, being outdoors.

00:02:12.039 --> 00:02:13.860
When I was twelve, 
on one of the summers

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.269
when we were back 
in the United States,

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:20.959
my father took me on my first real
sort of experience in the wilderness. 

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:25.469
He took me on a canoe trip up in Boundary 
Waters Canoe Area in Minnesota,

00:02:25.469 --> 00:02:29.589
where we paddled our canoe off into the 
wilderness and spent a whole week.

00:02:29.589 --> 00:02:31.680
And I don’t think we saw anybody

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.659
for several days.

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:36.649
I just found that really exciting, this
idea of being out there in the

00:02:36.649 --> 00:02:41.480
wilderness, catching fish to eat for
dinner, and I think that was a real

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:43.930
inspirational trip for me.

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:50.930
I really developed this love of wild places
that I keep seeking out to this day.

00:02:54.939 --> 00:02:58.229
There wasn’t a specific moment that I can 
remember having an epiphany or anything, where I

00:02:58.229 --> 00:03:02.919
realized, oh yeah, I want to become a
wildlife photographer or field biologist.

00:03:02.919 --> 00:03:06.949
It was a gradual process of pursuing
various things that interested me and

00:03:06.949 --> 00:03:12.359
finding my way to this current
career that I’m pursuing.

00:03:12.359 --> 00:03:16.719
When I went to college,
I was very interested in biology.

00:03:16.719 --> 00:03:19.029
I began to

00:03:19.029 --> 00:03:24.549
look for opportunities to get 
involved in research and fieldwork.

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:26.100
I found out about a project

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:28.609
in Borneo.

00:03:28.609 --> 00:03:35.079
I was fascinated by the rainforests.
I’d never been to a rainforest.

00:03:35.079 --> 00:03:37.299
I was living at this

00:03:37.299 --> 00:03:40.000
research camp for an entire year,

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.249
and after many months, 
I really had this desire to,

00:03:43.249 --> 00:03:46.479
you know, see the sunset 
or get a little more distant view.  

00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:51.969
I mean, the forest is, is so tall.

00:03:51.969 --> 00:03:54.049
I got a friend to bring 
out some ropes and 

00:03:54.049 --> 00:03:56.929
I was able to climb up
the rope and get up there. 

00:03:56.929 --> 00:04:03.629
And that’s kind of what got me started 
on exploring the rainforest canopy.

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:07.169
Since few scientists

00:04:07.169 --> 00:04:11.669
bother to take that difficult step of climbing 
up into the tree tops, it’s really

00:04:11.669 --> 00:04:16.669
kind of a wide-open field of research.

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:23.069
That canopy level of the forest 
is really where most of the action is.

00:04:25.319 --> 00:04:26.599
Most people who look at

00:04:26.599 --> 00:04:27.888
pictures in 
National Geographic Magazine, 

00:04:27.888 --> 00:04:33.199
they have no idea how much 
work goes into every shot.

00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:33.930
For me,

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:38.320
I don’t have any qualms about spending
one week to get one amazing shot.

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:41.410
I’m not going to take one picture, I may 
take a couple thousand pictures during

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:42.550
that week,

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:44.729
but my goal is really just to get one

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:49.830
publishable image.

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:55.169
What I’m doing now, being a wildlife 
photographer as well as scientist,

00:04:55.169 --> 00:05:00.620
it really kind of requires a 
combination of skills or mindsets.

00:05:00.620 --> 00:05:05.510
This combining of my scientific
background and my photography interest,

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:10.400
it's a perfect kind of combination 
to make these expeditions where

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:12.440
I'm trying to photograph and record

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:15.850
wildlife to tell stories, but I'm also
making scientifically valuable

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:18.630
collections at the same time.

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:24.130
To me, that's the best of both worlds.

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:30.530
I really enjoy going to 
these remote places

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:33.550
and I love the experiences of

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:35.729
seeing the wildlife,

00:05:35.729 --> 00:05:37.069
being there firsthand 

00:05:37.069 --> 00:05:41.210
and seeing a Parotia Bird-of-Paradise 
do its incredible ballerina dance

00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:43.459
right in front of me.

00:05:43.459 --> 00:05:47.229
But then the really 
satisfying thing about it is

00:05:47.229 --> 00:05:49.750
that I’m able to share with others

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:54.550
and have people see these places 
that they wouldn’t get to see.

00:05:54.550 --> 00:05:55.699
Being able to be

00:05:55.699 --> 00:05:58.699
the eyes to tell the stories

00:05:58.699 --> 00:06:01.199
and to share that with 
people around the world

00:06:01.199 --> 00:06:02.209
makes it really satisfying.
