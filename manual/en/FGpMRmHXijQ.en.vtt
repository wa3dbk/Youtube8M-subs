One of the interesting things about Max 5
is in the last book we dealt with global warming

00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:18.299
a bit and in this book we deal with pollution
to the air and potentially to water in the

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:21.430
oceans whatever.
And a lot of these takes place underwater.

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:26.760
Something’s going on there. There used to be a phrase  to live under the ocean and you see this phrase, the  birds are

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:31.830
working and that would be those things cause all of a sudden you’ll see these hundreds and thousands

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:37.200
of birds on the surface of the ocean and obviously
there you see a lot of small fish there but

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.620
something’s going on because the birds are
working. But the birds are working in the

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:46.399
story off to Hawaii and Max and the kids went
up going underwater in the story and try to

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:48.350
find out what is going on.

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:55.350
This series continues to be probably my favorite
so, if you like Alex Cross and all that stuff

00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:02.289
you’ll probably like this but even more
importantly time to turn your kids on with.

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:06.130
Any movie news? Everyone’s dying to know!

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:12.600
Movie news, yes of course! Maximum Ride is
script is being written right now. Mr. Payne

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:18.920
who previously was wrote for I think 8 years
in the Simpsons.   Terrific funny good storyteller

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:25.920
and Avi Arad  who is producing and his son
Harry who did Spiderman and X-Men and iron

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:32.319
Man and Sam Raimi who is still attached
who did Spiderman movie, so everything is

00:01:32.319 --> 00:01:35.869
looking great for the Maximum Ride movie.

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:39.700
Who do you see playing the flock in the movie?

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:44.719
Here’s what I would have love to have happened.
I’d love them to go out much as it did for

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:49.200
Harry Potter to go and find a whole bunch
of kids that we don’t even know exists or

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:56.200
just great and who will never forget the chaos
because it’s terrific at different parts.

00:01:57.639 --> 00:02:04.639
So I don’t know that there’ll be any names
that we could talk about. That we wanna talk

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:12.109
about so I’m hoping that they’d just go
and get a bunch of very talented kids.

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:19.659
Max and Fang are getting older. Do you think
they’ll ever pause long enough to end up

00:02:19.659 --> 00:02:19.709
together?

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:23.280
Max and Fang yeah. Now things are heating
up in Max I tell you without a bat.  They are

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:28.239
closer than ever. There definitely is something
going on, there’s an attraction and also

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:35.239
they repel each other. Repels each other at
times. They’re very close. I love them both

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:38.540
and i wish them well.

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:45.540
The maximum Ride series has been on the new York Times Bestseller list for close to 100 weeks. What is it about the series that you think so many people love?

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:54.129
It’s very rewarding for me to have the book
on the times and another less, for such a

00:02:54.129 --> 00:03:01.129
long time, because I took the chance when
i started writing books that both adults and

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:06.939
young adults would enjoy. And I wanted to
in the same way that a lot of adults will

00:03:06.939 --> 00:03:11.489
go, “ I can’t wait for the next Alex Cross”
because the pages frankly turned themselves.

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:17.370
I really thought it would be useful thing
to write books that adults and kids will have

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:23.019
the same feeling about. That the pages frontly
turned themselves and also that adults and

00:03:23.019 --> 00:03:27.780
kids could talk to each other about. I mean
you know we’ll talk to each other about

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:34.200
movies but rarely about books. Maybe the Harry
Potters but too many others. So that notion

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:39.729
of opening communication around the book series
is very stimulating to me.
