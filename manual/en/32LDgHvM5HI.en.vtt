as much as you can...

00:00:52.799 --> 00:00:54.560
but we try to be humans

00:00:55.172 --> 00:00:58.078
will we succeed? heaven will...

00:00:58.127 --> 00:01:02.202

Will you do anything else, besides geting drunk?

00:01:09.879 --> 00:01:11.064
We'll welcome the new year

00:01:11.012 --> 00:01:12.634

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:16.082

00:01:16.669 --> 00:01:17.654
What kind of banging?

00:01:17.654 --> 00:01:19.262
Rocket banging

00:01:45.782 --> 00:01:48.964
And then we will celebrate with alcohol...

00:01:49.932 --> 00:01:51.804

00:01:52.474 --> 00:01:54.886

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:12.706

00:03:10.557 --> 00:03:13.959
Vaido Neigaus, how drunk will you get on New Year's Eve?

00:03:15.349 --> 00:03:16.375
None of your business

00:03:20.038 --> 00:03:22.962
How drunk will you get on New Year's Eve?

00:03:23.395 --> 00:03:24.676
No way

00:03:25.903 --> 00:03:29.490
to be drunk, it's the most pointless condition

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:31.107
it's stupidity

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:32.991
total stupidity

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:34.391
absolute stupidity

00:03:35.595 --> 00:03:37.392
100 % stupidity

00:03:37.727 --> 00:03:39.268
i don't use alcohol at all

00:03:39.835 --> 00:03:41.129
absolutely not?

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:41.990
at all

00:03:42.487 --> 00:03:44.468
I will welcome New Year with orange juice

00:03:45.048 --> 00:03:45.933
