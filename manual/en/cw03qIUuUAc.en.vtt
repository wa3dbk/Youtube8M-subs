00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:07.620
Alright today on this 2004 Ford E450 thats
an RV, were going to install a brake controller

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:08.700
part number 90915.

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:17.380
We will be using an adapter cord 3035-P, and
on the back of the vehicle well be using 4

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:24.140
pole to 7 pole adapter part number 37185,
and also a bracket to hold everything together

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:30.350
118140, and with these parts well fill in
the gaps that are missing on part of this

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:31.350
tow package.

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:33.940
Okay we are going to start off by working
on the rear of the RV and working our way

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:34.940
forward.

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:39.440
What we are going to do is actually remove
the 5 pole connector that is located on the

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:40.440
hitch right now.

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:44.649
Were going to disconnect that and add a new
connector to the back of the vehicle, and

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:49.809
that part number will be adapter part number
37185, and we will also be using an adapter

00:00:49.809 --> 00:00:55.679
bracket part number 118140, and we will start
with that part.

00:00:55.679 --> 00:01:00.949
This is the adapter bracket; we are going
to mount to the bottom by clamp to hold it

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:01.949
in place.

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.250
Were going to strap through the clamp and
then take the threaded part and push it back

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:08.040
towards it and it locks it in place.

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.790
Then you could go ahead and tighten it up.

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:27.610
Okay and then we will install the bracket
that comes with the adapter part number 37185.

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:41.110
Lets go ahead and add the connector, this
hardware does come with the connector.

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:59.320
Alright lets 
go ahead 

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:29.319
and leave it 
alone for now, lets go 

00:02:29.319 --> 00:03:37.709
ahead 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:04:01.409
and 

00:04:01.409 --> 00:04:52.639
remove 

00:04:52.639 --> 00:05:19.490
the 

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:30.199
old 

00:05:30.199 --> 00:05:55.020
connector on the other 

00:05:55.020 --> 00:06:01.630
side of the hitch.
