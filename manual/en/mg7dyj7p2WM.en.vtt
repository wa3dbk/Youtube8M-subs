00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.500
"Antioxidant Power of Plant Foods 
Versus Animal Foods"

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:07.900
In a review on vegetarian diets
and public health published last year,

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:09.840
they concluded that

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.630
“Sufficient scientific evidence exists
for public health policy to promote a

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:16.840
plant-rich diet for
health promotion.

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:18.740
This does not need
to wait for science

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:22.640
to provide all the answers
as to why and how.”

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.980
But this is certainly one reason:

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.050
on average, 64 times more
antioxidant power in plant foods

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:35.800
than animal foods—
but is this really a fair comparison?

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.600
Included in the plant group
were some things that were

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.010
really just off the charts—

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:43.750
like some exotic wild berries you
could never actually find in a store,

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:47.200
that really skewed the chart
upwards for the plant foods.

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.950
I mean, people eat things like corn;

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:55.809
they don’t eat things like
dried Norwegian cornflowers.

00:00:55.809 --> 00:00:58.560
So let’s bring it down to earth.

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:02.879
The average plant food does indeed
have over a thousand units

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:06.060
of antioxidant power,
but for comparison’s sake,

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.070
just to be fair to the animal foods,

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.470
I’m going to choose the least healthy
plant food I can think of—

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:19.670
good old American iceberg lettuce,
which I think of as basically just water.

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:29.330
It does not have 1,157 units of
antioxidant power; it has 17.

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:33.550
Still beats out fish, though,
which averages 11.

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:35.829
Even salmon?

00:01:35.829 --> 00:01:38.110
7.

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:40.380
Chicken?

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.080
6.

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:47.740
Iceberg lettuce has nearly three times
more antioxidants than chicken!

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:49.960
A hardboiled egg?

00:01:49.979 --> 00:01:51.530
2.

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:57.110
And Egg Beaters,
which is just the whites, zero.

00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:01.130
Even Coca Cola has 4!

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:06.130
The same amount found
in cow’s milk, or yogurt;

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:11.009
though soy milk only
has about twice that.

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:14.640
While plant foods
average over 1,000,

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.489
the best animal foods can do,
in the meat category,

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:23.680
is a serving of ox liver at 71.

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:30.280
It beat out moose meat, reindeer steak,
but still couldn’t quite reach the

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:35.920
antioxidant power
of a Snickers bar.

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.110
This is why we need to
eat a plant-based diet.

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.620
Because even if you
lived off of ox livers,

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.900
the wild blueberry
of the animal kingdom,

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.989
one of the few animal foods
that can beat out lettuce,

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:58.769
you’d still never come close
to your daily antioxidant need.

00:02:58.769 --> 00:03:04.599
There is one animal product, however,
that does kick some serious tush,

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:06.659
topping over 200.

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:11.470
There are even some types of berries
that didn’t test that antioxidant-rich.

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:14.050
An animal product so healthy,

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:20.209
I have to encourage everyone to
consume it—when you’re a baby.

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:25.519
That’s the antioxidant content
of human breast milk.

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:31.600
During infancy, breast is best.
After infancy, plants are preferred.
