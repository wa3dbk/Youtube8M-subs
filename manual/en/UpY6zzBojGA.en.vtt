00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.050
Morning guys, say hello Phoebe, hello, I am
just taking Phoebe to school then off to buy

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:06.459
some Spam for a food fear, do you know what
spam is?

00:00:06.459 --> 00:00:10.450
No � she does not know what it is and that
is a good thing, it is time to eat it and

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:14.500
see if we like it.

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:22.859
Ok folks so here is my tin of spam sometimes
I have hear there is a key on it to get the

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:31.199
key off or you can use a tin opener but this
one has got a ring pull wow oh my gosh did

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.020
you hear that it was like an explosion it
is trying to put me off already so lets pull

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:36.020
this back.

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:42.870
Come on, oh my goodness that is tough that
is really tough am I doing this wrong not

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:48.620
joking guys but actually giving that as much
force as I can I am going to get oh I can

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:54.320
smell it from here that is disgusting, I am
going to get the tin opener out of my drawer.

00:00:54.320 --> 00:01:01.990
Ok I got in there and it is turning around
the corner like a racing track or something,

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:08.270
anyhow I think I may be able to get it up
now, it has popped up anyway oh my gosh.

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:13.710
I have not even mentioned that it is 25 percent
extra free how luck am I, it stinks I am just

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:18.479
going to give it a smell that is like cat
food and there is all jelly stuff around the

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.660
edge ok lets get it out of the tin.

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:26.380
So on the back it says squeeze until it pops
so I am going to give it a squeeze and think

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:31.880
it popped oh can you see that fat there coming
out the edge just wanna give it a little wiggle

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:42.749
too lets get it out like a sandcastle oh look
it has started to come out like a sandcastle,

00:01:42.749 --> 00:01:45.189
yes, oh my gosh.

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:50.659
Alright if I wanted to summarise why I have
a fear of this food this frame that you are

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:55.759
seeing right now describes it without me having
to say anything look at that a massive slab

00:01:55.759 --> 00:02:00.930
of porky ham chopped pork and ham is what
it effectively is but other flavourings like

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:06.130
water and stabilisers and stuff but all this
jelly stuff on the side and back, it just

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:07.130
scares me guys.

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:11.689
I know I can fry it guys but just like all
my other food fears it is time to eat this

00:02:11.689 --> 00:02:17.450
no seasonings, just like the tongue and the
liver all that stuff before, we are going

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:20.030
to try and eat this right now.

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:26.409
Lets move the tin to one side, I am going
to tip this over and cut away a nice slab

00:02:26.409 --> 00:02:31.189
of it apparently you can fry in oil for spam
fritters which is quite nice but I want to

00:02:31.189 --> 00:02:35.569
just try it as it is on its own.

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:41.200
The smell is horrible guys but the whole point
of these food fear videos is to try and overcome

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:46.920
foods that I have always hated every day things,
I know people like spam I did beetroot recently,

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:51.120
I used to hate beetroot and now I absolutely
love it so I am allowing myself a glass of

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.599
water I have got myself a nice thick slab
here, do not really want to pick it up ooh

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:59.780
it kind of feels like a credit card it is
very heavy and slimey, I have even put some

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:05.019
of the fatty jelly stuff on it too which for
me is probably even the worst bit, lets have

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:06.019
a go.

00:03:06.019 --> 00:03:10.410
So I am going to make a big incision with
my fork to chop it off like that oh my god,

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:14.939
I do not like the way there are all different
tones of pink in there with the pork and ham

00:03:14.939 --> 00:03:18.879
in there but it is like a pig that has a really
bad sun tan or something like that.

00:03:18.879 --> 00:03:22.510
Ok lets get some of the jelly on it too.

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:28.739
Here we go�.

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:30.810
Urgh!

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:39.700
I hate it when my eyes water and I am only
eating food not chopping onions.

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:41.530
Really salty, mushy, urghh!

00:03:41.530 --> 00:04:03.030
Salty and tangy, the jelly was disgusting
not gonna lie there but, it is actually not

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:07.719
too bad if you want to get past the smell
and the jelly, I will scrape some of that

00:04:07.719 --> 00:04:12.859
jelly off it is not very full of flavour it
is just almost like old school chicken nuggets

00:04:12.859 --> 00:04:16.120
because chicken nuggets are a lot better than
they used to be now it is like they mashed

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:20.329
together all the worst pits of the pork and
ham probably any proper pork and ham in there

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:24.890
is that hair, is that a hair?!

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:25.890
Urghh.

00:04:25.890 --> 00:04:29.370
Ok I will give it another bit.

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:43.211
Very squidgy, mushy, extremely salty it is
bearable, I would eat it again in fact I am

00:04:43.211 --> 00:04:46.493
going to cut up another slice now and fry
it in some oil to make a fritter like it said,

00:04:46.493 --> 00:04:47.493
lets do that.

00:04:47.493 --> 00:04:48.493
Oh here we go, hear that?

00:04:48.493 --> 00:04:49.493
Going to fry this up.

00:04:49.493 --> 00:04:56.720
Time to turn it over, oh wow look at that
golden colour that is pretty cool, and with

00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:01.050
colour comes flavour so I might like this
even more, so will fry this side and give

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:02.050
that a quick taste.

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:06.740
So I fried it up in some oil as you saw, drained
it on kitchen towel and it has cooled down

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:12.960
a bit here we go.

00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:17.360
Do you know what that is actually pretty darn
good it is still very very salty but in the

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:22.289
inside it was still squidgy but warmed through
and essentially warm spam but that nice colour

00:05:22.289 --> 00:05:23.860
of being fried on there, really good.

00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:28.229
But I want to take some of that salt out of
it so would probably add seasonings next time

00:05:28.229 --> 00:05:29.470
to calm it down a bit.

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:33.110
But compared to liver and tongue what I have
had before it is actually pretty darn good.

00:05:33.110 --> 00:05:36.319
So if you have a food fear let me know what
it is down below, the cool thing about the

00:05:36.319 --> 00:05:39.930
World is everyones tastebuds are different
it is all about overcoming your fears like

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:43.990
ten minutes ago I hated spam and now I kind
of like it you never know I may use it on

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:48.710
a recipe going forward and my next fear is
going to be some snails so look out for that

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:49.710
