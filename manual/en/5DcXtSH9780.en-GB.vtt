Hi we're here at Windy Lake Provincial Park and I'm with Ryan. We're going cross-country...

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:12.680
Skiing!
See what this park has to offer.

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.380
You know Doug, Windy Lake is known for its
beaches and its waterfront fun, but one of

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:25.670
the coolest things actually takes place in
the winter. Windy Lake is home to 15 kilometres

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:29.449
of world class ski trails that are track set
and professionally groomed.

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:30.669
We're standing in them right now.

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:31.789
We're standing in them
right now.

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:36.960
One of the other cool things, Doug, I should tell you is that it's home to three-time Olympic athlete

00:00:36.969 --> 00:00:39.949
and 2012 world champion Devon Kershaw

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:41.309
Devon Kershaw is from here?

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.860
Yeah, home club, pretty cool. When the snow flies

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:48.469
The park partners with the Onaping Falls Nordic
Ski Club. They've been around for forty years here

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:51.360
So Ryan if I'm a beginner, you know, which

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:56.810
is pretty obvious nowadays, is this a good
spot for me to start from?

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:01.920
Actually, yeah. They have classic-style skiing and they have skate skiing which can take you from absolute

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:05.930
amateur to actual-Olympian-Olympic Champion, yeah.

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.740
Ryan, where have you taken us to now?
Well Doug we just happen to be standing on

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.490
the edge of a meteorite crater.

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:15.240
Right here?

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.509
Right here.
Over two billion years ago, a meteorite almost

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:24.959
15 kilometres across impacted the Earth and
went almost 15 kilometres into it, and created

00:01:24.959 --> 00:01:30.950
a crater that was 250 kilometres wide.
When the meteor struck, the shockwaves

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:35.750
created what's called shatter cones. And on
your drive up to Windy Lake Provincial Park

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:39.950
you can actually see some of those representations
at the A.Y. Jackson lookout in the summertime,

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:42.610
and in the wintertime, you can stop in at
Science North.

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:45.760
And we're standing on the edge of it?

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:46.920
We're standing on the edge of it.

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.560
So Doug, we've seen a lot of cool things in
the park, but one of the cooler things is

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:58.080
definitely our winter camping yurts. But what
makes it the coolest thing is that you can

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:01.119
ski right to it.
So our yurts have an electric heater, and

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:03.670
electric light, it sleeps six people, you
have a large

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:08.170
deck, a BBQ, a fire pit, and a winter heated
privy.

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:12.530
You have your world-class ski trails out the
front door, you have snowshoe trails out the

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:16.330
back door, the lake down the hill for ice
fishing - it's just all right there for your

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:18.620
taking
You've got everything you need right there

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.600
You've got everything there, it's an absolute
wonderful place to be.

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:21.340
Excellent.

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.060
Hey Doug, have you seen my hat?

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:28.560
What's that Ryan?

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.100
My hat, have you seen my hat?

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.600
No!

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:33.620
My precious
