00:00:04.030 --> 00:00:09.260
First, take a Snazaroo paint in lilac and load it up onto a face painting sponge.  

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:14.640
Gently press on the colour around the outside edges of the eyes covering the temples 

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:17.290
and bringing it down onto the tops of the cheekbones.  

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:25.020
Along the top edge, try to create a straight line which connects from the hairline down into the inside corner of the eyebrow.  

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:30.600
Take a Snazaroo paint in purple and apply this directly over the top of the lilac 

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:35.190
but this time concentrate the colour more around the edges of the eyes rather than bringing it outwards.  

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:42.600
Take a Snazaroo face paint in black and use a brush to create a line which starts right in the inside corner of the eye

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:46.260
sweeps under the eyebrow and then flicks up at the outside edge.  

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:52.110
It can be quite tricky to get it perfect with one stroke so just go back in and neaten up any edges.  

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:59.150
Then starting in the outside corner of the eye, create an upward swirl.  

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:07.850
For the cobwebs paint in three lines all starting from roughly the centre of the face and sweeping out into the hairline.  

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:11.090
Try to make sure that they’re equal distances apart.  

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:17.090
Then simply connect the lines together with a series of loops.  

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:25.100
Do exactly the same thing on the lower half of the face

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:31.000
but this time make sure the cobwebs are headed downwards towards the mouth.  

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:42.010
Fill in any small gaps you might have with some teardrops and then start on the spider.  

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:50.190
First paint in a small circle right in the centre of the forehead and then directly under this paint in a larger circle.  

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:56.210
From the point where the two circles meet start painting in the legs.  

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:03.180
You want the front two legs to flick upwards and the back two legs to be flicking down.  

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:30.040
Finally take some white Snazaroo face paint and to add some highlights, paint in lots of different size dots along the web.  

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:45.200
You could also add a few starbursts around the design and a little shine on the spider’s body.  

00:02:52.230 --> 00:03:01.240
If you want to add some real sparkle just take some loose glitter in a matching colour and press this over the cobwebs.
