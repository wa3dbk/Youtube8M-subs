00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:08.600
For this segment, I'm going to tell you about
the Queen B's in the game. Eventually, you

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:14.180
will get to a point in the game where it will
go to a cut scene when you're near your storage

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:23.430
room. And, it will show you about how these
bees a Queen B that will possess certain zombies.

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.640
When you kill these zombies, the queen will
get out and you can capture the Queen B. And,

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.460
the Queen B is a very powerful weapon. When
you smash the glass on the ground, it takes

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:37.050
out all the zombies surrounding you. It can
take out up to fifty zombies at least. So,

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:43.920
I'm going to show you how to identify this
and I'm going to show you a good way to use

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:52.370
it. You know a zombie has a queen in them,
if they're not wondering around and their

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:56.530
hands are in the air much like this zombie
right in front of me puking blood all that.

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:01.210
That's how you know there's a queen in them.
So, basically you kill them and you'll see

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:08.659
it flying around. You get close to it and
you hit B to catch it. After you've caught

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:20.890
it, you want to find a large group of zombies
to where it's actually going to make a difference.

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:24.050
So, there's a group of zombies in front of
me. I don't need to get close to them to do

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:31.290
it. I can take it and I can throw it. And,
when it smashes it kills all the zombies around

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:40.030
it. So, the Queen B is a good weapon for if
there's a lot of zombies in your path when

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.159
you're trying to save people and you need
to get them through and you don't want them

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:53.220
to die. It is a very useful tool in clearing
the path for you. Also, it will just help

00:01:53.220 --> 00:02:00.799
you kill a lot of zombies quickly to give
you more points towards leveling up. It's

00:02:00.799 --> 00:02:06.950
always a good idea that if you see these zombies
with their hands in the air not really running

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:13.150
around too much is a good idea to take them
out. And, keep a few extra of the Queen B's

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:18.920
in your inventory. Because, when if you get
in a jam where you're surrounded by zombies

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.840
or you're trying to get some people you're
trying to save through them it's a very useful

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:33.430
tool. Here's another one right here. So, I'm
in a position where I'm surrounded by zombies.

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:35.469
I smash it on the ground; it takes care of
it for me.
