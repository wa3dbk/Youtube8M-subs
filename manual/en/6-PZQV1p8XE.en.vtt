CARLISLE: It wasn’t until I was about what 3 or 4, or right around that age.

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:36.000
that I actually started to notice that there were Deaf adults and hearing adults.

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:47.260
I had asked my Mom and she sat me down and said, “You know, I have blonde hair and you have brown hair.

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:54.000
I have blue eyes and you have green eyes. I am hearing and you are Deaf.”

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.440
And at that moment I started bawling and my mother was like, ‘What’s wrong?’

00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:00.760
And I was crying and I said, ‘I want blue eyes!’

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:01.600
My mother gave me a look.

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.380
I played soccer and I actually made a goal for the wrong team!

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:19.140
I was running down the field, I looked over and saw people waving…

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.500
I thought they were cheering me on. I was feeling good!

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.500
I ran down the field the team behind me and made the goal.

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.640
So embarrassing!

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:34.820
I’m just not fit to be on land. I’m not a land animal. I am more of a water creature.

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.420
I did it for so long, so I knew it was time. My shoulders was giving out.

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:04.000
Right around 8 or 9 years old, I did yeah, I envisioned myself becoming a cartoonist.

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:11.020
As I grew up, I started to lose motivation because a lot of people said,

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:14.220
‘You can’t have a good career with art. You can’t!’

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:20.600
A lot of people would say, ‘yeah, your only option is to become a teacher.’ And I was like what?!

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:38.660
I feel like society still puts a lot of pressure on gender. Really we’re all human.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.800
I felt like I had to fit society's expectations.

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:49.480
And I did, and at that time I didn’t really know too much about transgender.

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:58.180
There’s a lot of oppression in the binary system, recognizing only male, only female.

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.700
But really there’s fluidity within that spectrum.

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.120
And there are people that don’t fit.

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:12.980
After doing some self-searching and at that same time, I realized I wanted to become a cartoonist as well.

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:17.720
It happened simultaneously. And that’s when my life took a 180-degree turn.

00:03:38.020 --> 00:03:40.420
I immersed myself and totally fell in love with it.

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:55.960
And comics can also educate people.

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.040
When there’s oppression within the system, comics can talk about it.

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:45.220
It was the scariest decision I had to make. But at the same time it’s the best decision I ever made.

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:49.820
I’m much happier now. I’m happy I made that decision. Yeah.

00:04:55.180 --> 00:05:00.580
RIKKI: You seem more comfortable in your skin. It’s because you found yourself.

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:03.740
CARLISLE: I consider myself very fortunate. I have a supportive family and friends.

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:07.280
RIKKI: You’re still the same person, still funny, still a klutz!

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:08.520
CARLISLE: Ah ha ha ha! I’m a klutz – yep!

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:11.920
Deaf people always have to support each other. We’re already a close knit community.

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:18.060
Seeing that Convo had the Ecosystem. Woah! I was thrilled, I mean that is an amazing

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:21.060
resource for Deaf-owned businesses.

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:44.980
I was thinking and it struck me… what if aliens came down? And they had six arms?

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:50.100
Would they view us as disabled? Thinking "Oh, you have two arms. Poor you."

00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:52.160
And from that idea, a vision was born.

00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:17.440
So, it’s still a work in progress.

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:21.160
Building their personalities and seeing what they are gonna be.

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:27.820
Web comics will soon be released. You’ll find out more later.

00:06:34.140 --> 00:06:38.540
Eat, sleep, comics – story of my life!

00:06:38.540 --> 00:06:44.200
Next thing you know it’s Graduation Day! And I’m moving to Massachusetts, near Boston.

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:46.600
Really looking forward to that new chapter in my life.

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:56.000
I hope we get to the point where everybody can just feel safe to be themselves.

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:26.140
My name is Carlisle.

00:07:26.140 --> 00:07:29.200
And I am artistic,

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:32.440
empowering,

00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:35.120
and happy.
