(female voiceover).
This webisode is intended to

00:00:02.073 --> 00:00:05.067
 give students a sneak peek
 into  Griffith University.

00:00:05.067 --> 00:00:08.040
Griffith is located in
Australia, and EIU students can

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.063
choose to study abroad at any
of their campuses.

00:00:11.063 --> 00:00:14.020
This webisode is designed to
give you information that you

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:17.020
may not find online or on
their website.

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:19.023
In the next few minutes
we will explore where

00:00:19.023 --> 00:00:22.010
 international students live,
 where to grab a bite to eat,

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:24.013
and what the night life
might be like.

00:00:24.013 --> 00:00:27.000
Oh yeah, and what the school
offers that EIU cannot.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.047
But let's begin with the basics.

00:00:29.047 --> 00:00:31.030
Griffith University has
multiple locations.

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:34.003
The one we chose to check out
was their Gold Coast campus

00:00:34.003 --> 00:00:37.013
because this is where most
international students attend.

00:00:37.013 --> 00:00:39.073
The Gold Coast campus is
about a five-minute walk away

00:00:39.073 --> 00:00:42.010
from the Pacific Ocean
and only a few minutes

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:44.023
from the outback.

00:00:44.023 --> 00:00:46.043
International students
make up about 23% of the

00:00:46.043 --> 00:00:49.060
population at the
Gold Coast campus.

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:52.047
At Griffith, international
students have many study options

00:00:52.047 --> 00:00:54.037
to choose from.

00:00:54.037 --> 00:00:58.010
For example, education,
psychology, business,

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:02.003
communication, engineering,
and information technology.

00:01:02.003 --> 00:01:06.033
The normal thing in our school
is either a one-hour lecture

00:01:06.033 --> 00:01:09.083
and two-hour tutorial,
or two-hour lecture and

00:01:09.083 --> 00:01:13.090
one-hour tutorial or workshop,
or a three-hour workshop

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:17.017
in the practice-based courses.

00:01:17.017 --> 00:01:19.023
(female voiceover).
We talked to professors within

00:01:19.023 --> 00:01:21.050
the arts and humanities,
and they said

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:23.020
this school is very unique.

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:25.060
Many students arrive in school
with sand on their feet,

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:28.020
you know, having come
straight from riding boards.

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:33.030
And so there's quite a vibrant
mix of students, and that's

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.080
before you include a lot of
international students from

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:44.090
China, the United States,
Taiwan, Thailand, and Europe.

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.037
(female voiceover).
So what can Griffith University

00:01:46.037 --> 00:01:48.033
 offer you that EIU cannot?

00:01:48.033 --> 00:01:51.067
One can't help but notice that
we are very nicely set up on

00:01:51.067 --> 00:01:56.003
the Gold Coast--some beautiful
beaches, great for surfing,

00:01:56.003 --> 00:02:02.053
great for walking, into land
that has a very interesting

00:02:02.053 --> 00:02:05.090
rainforest kind of environment.

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:07.067
(female voiceover).
Obviously Eastern cannot

00:02:07.067 --> 00:02:09.033
offer you a great beach
where you can surf or

00:02:09.033 --> 00:02:11.043
hang out, or a tropical
climate where you have

00:02:11.043 --> 00:02:13.047
great temperatures
all year around.

00:02:13.047 --> 00:02:15.077
To get a really good feel for
the general atmosphere of the

00:02:15.077 --> 00:02:19.007
campus, we walked around and
talked to a few students.

00:02:19.007 --> 00:02:21.020
In doing this, one might notice
that Griffith University

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:24.057
 has a very relaxed atmosphere
 and a beautiful campus where

00:02:24.057 --> 00:02:28.067
students can dine in a nice
 outdoor venue or go swimming.

00:02:28.067 --> 00:02:32.037
The community is great, we have
a lot of social events so people

00:02:32.037 --> 00:02:34.060
can come together and meet new
people from around the world.

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.047
They kind of branch out, it
kind of pulls you out of your

00:02:36.047 --> 00:02:38.083
comfort zone, and you make
a lot of friends that you

00:02:38.083 --> 00:02:41.083
normally wouldn't make just
sitting around on your balcony.

00:02:41.083 --> 00:02:43.087
(female voiceover).
Though students can live

00:02:43.087 --> 00:02:45.047
where they please, I checked
out some apartments

00:02:45.047 --> 00:02:47.083
on campus where many of the
international students live,

00:02:47.083 --> 00:02:49.050
and they are nice.

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:52.003
The main area has a basketball
court, a pool, a TV lounge,

00:02:52.003 --> 00:02:54.070
a gaming area, and
a computer lab.

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:56.060
We asked students where
to grab a bite to eat,

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.060
and you may be surprised to
find something familiar

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:00.027
but with a little twist.

00:03:00.027 --> 00:03:03.047
There's all kinds of good
little hamburger joints.

00:03:03.047 --> 00:03:05.053
There's one that's called
the Ozzie Burger with a

00:03:05.053 --> 00:03:09.013
big slab of pineapple on it,
it's just a massive burger.

00:03:09.013 --> 00:03:11.030
(female voiceover).
Of course, students can chose

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:13.020
from a variety of
places on campus or

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:15.037
head to a local eatery
nearby.

00:03:15.037 --> 00:03:17.080
There is a uni bar which
students are welcome to go to,

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:20.000
but if night life is more
your style, there are also

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.083
many bars and pubs
located in the area.

00:03:22.083 --> 00:03:26.077
There's some good Irish
pubs if you're into that,

00:03:26.077 --> 00:03:29.090
and there's some real
good clubs if you're into

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:31.090
dancing and stuff like that.

00:03:31.090 --> 00:03:33.083
(female voiceover).
When you want to get a bit

00:03:33.083 --> 00:03:35.067
further away from campus,
don't forget you're a mere

00:03:35.067 --> 00:03:37.033
five-minute walk to the beach.

00:03:37.033 --> 00:03:39.053
Some students go even
further away from campus

00:03:39.053 --> 00:03:41.027
on long weekends.

00:03:41.027 --> 00:03:43.017
We went on a six-day road
trip up to Cairns, up the

00:03:43.017 --> 00:03:45.067
east coast of Australia,
and we stopped at the

00:03:45.067 --> 00:03:49.057
national rainforest and saw
live kangaroos on the beach,

00:03:49.057 --> 00:03:52.033
and we went to a crater lake
and went swimming there.

00:03:52.033 --> 00:03:54.040
We went to the blue lagoon
and the rainforest,

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:56.030
so that kind of stuff.

00:03:56.030 --> 00:03:58.033
(female voiceover).
There are many opportunities

00:03:58.033 --> 00:04:00.030
that are available to
those who study abroad at

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:02.023
Griffith University
on the Gold Coast.

00:04:02.023 --> 00:04:04.027
This campus is a relaxed
learning environment that

00:04:04.027 --> 00:04:06.050
many students find advantageous,
and most students find the

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:09.083
natural surroundings of the
school to be beneficial as well.

00:04:09.083 --> 00:04:12.093
On the beach and in the bush,
we are EIU.
