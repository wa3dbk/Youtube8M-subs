00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:03.399
Well spring has well and truly sprung

00:00:03.399 --> 00:00:06.549
And things are bursting out with color

00:00:06.549 --> 00:00:11.690
and new growth all over the place. But
along with the good weather comes

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:14.299
unfortunately sometimes cold nights

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:17.890
that might get to beneath freezing point

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:23.920
and that can damage the soft, young growth and fleshy flowers on some plants that

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:24.230
are

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:27.820
early flowering like my Star Magnolia
here

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:32.739
which unfortunately was damaged in a
frost that we had last night

00:00:32.739 --> 00:00:35.780
The big fleshy flowers unfortunately

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:40.780
are vulnerable when the temperatures dip
beneath freezing point.

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:45.550
But, if you're in a situation like me
where you're having some damage

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:50.219
what can you do to prevent it? Well, we could
do like the commercial growers

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.070
and spray water over the plants,
particularly

00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:57.379
if there's a lot of plants concentrated in
one area

00:00:57.379 --> 00:01:00.850
Hook up all holes and spray water over
it

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:03.980
you see when water is sprayed and

00:01:03.980 --> 00:01:08.250
it releases latent heat and not often
enough to prevent

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.360
damage. Well, if you just have a few
isolated small plants like

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.990
this hydrangea here with soft young
growth on it, you can employ the old

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:20.369
method of putting some form of protection

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:23.520
over the top with it. Just gather the
branches and

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.960
cover it up for the night, and that will
do the trick.

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:31.680
It's not too pretty but at least it will
prevent the damage during the night

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:36.670
But when you have taller plants like
this Japanese maple here

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:39.780
that's got a lot of soft, young growth

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:45.340
you're going to have to employ other
methods. Now that would mean putting

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:47.840
some sort of insulation material

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.180
over the top for the plants, draping it
over. In the old days we used to use

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:52.799
sheets

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:56.100
perhaps even blankets, though they tend
to be a bit heavy

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:01.329
I sometimes use the fabric that I
use in the garden for collecting up trimmings and

00:02:01.329 --> 00:02:02.320
 

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:05.329
weeds and so on. And plastic

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:09.929
is better than nothing, but honestly
plastic isn't that great, because it

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:11.569
tends to collect humidity

00:02:11.569 --> 00:02:16.180
in underneath and the temperature under
plastic can sometimes actually be colder

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:19.520
then it is out in the open air. But, for
me

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:22.680
the best material is this fleecy

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.720
frost blanket...... this is great stuff

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:29.349
its light and airy, so it floats

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:32.489
over the top so the plants. It has great

00:02:32.489 --> 00:02:36.480
insulation properties, and yet it
breaths, so it doesn't collect

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:41.370
moisture underneath. And best of all, it
allows light to pass through

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:44.670
so that if you have to leave it on your
plant for

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.680
a day or two, it's not the end of the
world, it won't matter.

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.849
But whenever all frost passes, you can
take it off

00:02:52.849 --> 00:02:57.690
and you'll be able to enjoy your plants.
And very easy to put on

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:00.950
just cut into strips, tie it

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:05.950
onto the plant or you could use cotton
twine. Perhaps weigh it down here on the

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:06.500
bottom

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:10.459
with a rock, something that will help to
keep it in place

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:14.239
And you'll be able to enjoy your
magnolias

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:18.230
your Japanese maples or whatever it is
that you have to protect

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:21.330
very easily with minimal cost

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:25.590
Well that's all very well, but what do
you do when you have a Magnolia like

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:26.319
this one

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:31.730
that's twenty five, thirty foot in the
air?  That's full of gorgeous blooms

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:35.720
and you can get up to the top of the
plant! Well, you might have to employ a boy a

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:36.659
cherry picker

00:03:36.659 --> 00:03:40.580
or else to like the citrus growers and
put some heat underneath it.

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:44.519
Just enough to raise the temperature to
prevent the damage

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:48.790
And remember, if all else fails

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:52.159
and you haven't been able to get out to
protect your plants

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:57.189
you can always go out, and cut them, and bring them indoors. Put them in a vase

00:03:57.189 --> 00:03:58.220
like these ones

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:03.150
so that you're able to enjoy them
indoors, whether it freezes outside or

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:03.599
not

00:04:03.599 --> 00:04:07.080
Now there's lots more information on our
website

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:11.080
Gardensplendor.com. Enjoy your
gardening

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:17.409
It's good for us and it's very good for
our environment too.

00:04:17.409 --> 00:04:20.879
 

00:04:20.879 --> 00:04:23.009
