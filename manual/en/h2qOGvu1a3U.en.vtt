00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:09.800
The last intermediate mat exercise is the
mermaid which kind of speaks for itself once

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:11.550
you see what it looks like.

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.530
THe mermaid does however work a great deal
of lateral flection.

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:17.640
Lateral flection is side bending.

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:22.550
And lateral flection is hard on your lower
back and your lumbar spine if you're not supported

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:23.880
through the abdominals.

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.240
So it's a good idea that you've waited this
long through the mat series near the send

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:31.610
so that you can accomplish this in a healthy,
safe way.

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:36.090
And it's also just a really great stretch
after a pretty challenging workout.

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:42.380
So for the mermaid, you'll turn to the side
of your mat and start in the little kind of

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:44.380
cheerleader position.

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:48.460
You try to keep the knees and shins stacked
as much as possible but you'll separate them

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:52.710
enough so that both your hips and your shoulders
are squared.

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.380
And then reach your arms right up to a T position
here.

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:02.540
OK, you'll lean over toward your left side
and then lower your hand and forearm toward

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:07.130
the mat, lengthen your arm up by your head
and side bend.

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:12.570
From here you're lifting the underside of
the waist, so this is cinched and this waistline

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.280
is very long.

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:20.371
Then come back up to seated, wrap your right
hand around your right knee, and then take

00:01:20.371 --> 00:01:22.830
a counter stretch to the other side.

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:27.640
Now with a breath, inhale come to the center,
continue to inhale as you lean over to the

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:31.690
side, exhale as you bend here finding a deep
stretch.

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:37.420
Inhale, pinwheel yourself up to seated, exhale
take your counter stretch.

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:38.490
One last time.

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.950
Inhale come to a T position with the arms,
exhale side bend.

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:44.299
From here, feel the ribs soften.

00:01:44.299 --> 00:01:46.780
So you're stretched but you're working efficiently.

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:48.700
So no strain in pilates.

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:54.520
Take an inhale, then exhale come up to seated,
wrap your hand to the knee and side bend your

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.670
counter stretch.

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.790
All right, come back up to the starting position,
and with your arms in a T. And then we'll

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:02.350
switch to the other side.

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.299
So bring your hands behind you, extend the
legs, and fold them underneath you to the

00:02:06.299 --> 00:02:07.299
other side.

00:02:07.299 --> 00:02:13.100
Take an inhale, then exhale side bend to the
right, lower your hand and forearm over.

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:19.520
That's it, breathe in, then breathe out, come
back up to seated and take your counter stretch

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:20.520
here.

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:21.520
Nice.

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:22.880
Two more times.

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.230
Take a deep inhale, then exhale side bend
over.

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:29.950
Try to keep your hips anchored and equal to
the mat.

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:34.300
Inhale to seated, exhale side bend.

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:36.090
And soften here.

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:37.090
Last time.

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:41.180
Inhale come to the center, exhale side bend.

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:46.970
Deep breath in, then exhale come back up towards
to sitting, take your counter stretch, and

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:51.270
then come all the way back up to your seated
starting position.

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:55.610
So that's mermaid, and then you would end
your mat class by doing front support.
