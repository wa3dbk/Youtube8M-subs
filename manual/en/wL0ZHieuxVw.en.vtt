00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:06.740
Hey, everyone I'm gonna show you how to make 
the world's best popcorn. You're gonna love this.

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:11.690
Kitty, too.

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:15.109
So here's what you need to make 
the world's best popcorn.

00:00:15.109 --> 00:00:16.900
A saucepan,

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:21.880
A bowl,
Oil,

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:22.939
And popcorn.

00:00:22.939 --> 00:00:28.500
Plus a special ingredient. 
Stick around till the end.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.349
So let's put our

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:36.000
pan...

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.450
Pan? Sauce pan. Sauce-thing. 
Whatever this is.

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:45.650
and add a little bit of oil

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:47.070
just enough

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.160
to cover the bottom.
Not too much.

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.280
We're going to

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:59.070
light this up.

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.230
Let it go on 

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:01.820
high

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:03.920
until the oil is ready.

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:09.140
Well, how do we know when it's ready?

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:15.020
Easy! 
We put in three kernels..,

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:18.150
..four kernels into the oil.

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:19.520
When they pop, it's ready.

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.360
Gonna cover this up

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:29.800
and i'll meet you back here 
when it's ready.

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:34.630
So the oil's just about ready.

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:36.150
Lower that

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:37.310
heat.

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.260
Add the kernels,

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:44.330
cover it up,

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:50.580
stir it up a bit,

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:53.729
and wait for the popcorn to pop.

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.660
Now, this requires two hands,

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:04.660
so we'll see the end result soon.

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:12.780
So the popcorn is popping

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:26.150
Like magic!

00:02:27.389 --> 00:02:34.209
So next,

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:36.229
we,

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:42.059
put it in the bowl

00:02:42.059 --> 00:02:49.059
add some salt

00:02:50.949 --> 00:02:54.099
That's really good!

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:58.589
And now the secret ingredient:

00:02:58.589 --> 00:03:05.589
TABASCO SAUCE!

00:03:08.689 --> 00:03:11.109
There you have it: 

00:03:11.109 --> 00:03:12.159
The World's Best Popcorn.
