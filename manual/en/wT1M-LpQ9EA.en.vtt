00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:07.089
So I have, um, a fear of marriage, that's
a fear of mine. I feel like it's rational.

00:00:07.089 --> 00:00:13.420
I feel like it goes beyond my disdain for
tacky facebook engagement photos, and maybe

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:16.309
there's lie a little bit of psychological
damage there from my brother, but I think

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:23.309
the real reason is I have always had a deep-seeded
aversion to group projects...and from what

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:31.750
I've been able to gather, marriage is just
like a lifelong group project. Am I wrong?

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:41.260
Only, instead of your grade being at stake,
it's your entire life mission and eternal

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:48.260
salvation. Like, what kind of pressure is
that to choose a group for? But right now

00:00:48.569 --> 00:00:54.010
I feel like I'm at that time where the teacher
announced there is going to be a group project,

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:57.499
and everyone around me is like making eye
contact and pairing up, and I'm just like

00:00:57.499 --> 00:01:04.420
"No! I don't know anyone in this class! I
don't--How do you guys know each other so

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:09.119
fast? Are you just randomly getting together
so that you aren't alone? Are you trying to

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:14.420
avoid being partners with me, is that what's
happening right now?" It's going to get to

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.920
the point where the teacher is going to be
like, "who doesn't have a partner, raise your hand."

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:32.479
And I am the only one raising my hand
and I'll be like, "you know, can't I just

00:01:32.479 --> 00:01:39.479
work alone?" and they'll be like, "No, no,
is anyone willing to be partners with Hannah?

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:46.679
Maybe we could have a group of three?" And
everybody is like, "I finally get polygamy.

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:57.210
I get it now." The worst part about group
projects is that all the sudden everything

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:07.659
you turn in is both of yours. LIke, you work
so hard on this project, right, you put everything

00:02:07.659 --> 00:02:11.720
you have into it, you are working day and
night, doing research, you're not sleeping,

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:17.000
and he does maybe like one thing and then
you get to class and all the sudden it's

00:02:17.000 --> 02:24:00.000
"We're pregnant." Right?
