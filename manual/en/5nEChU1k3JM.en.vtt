00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.560
 

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:08.129
 

00:00:08.129 --> 00:00:12.450
Hi everyone. So, something that people
are always really interested in

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.839
and it's an area where I myself have levelled criticism

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.000
at companies in the past for but that
is heat

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.560
build-up. Now you might remember when the
Galaxy S4 was released I was

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:27.640
very negative on what Samsung
delivered there from a heat point of view, the

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.009
thermal properties of

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:32.520
well their design, and the cpu-gpu combination they'd use and the

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:36.080
clock speeds they'd gone for meant that you
had a device that was useless

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:37.290
for gaming in my opinion

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.470
for any longer than maybe 10 to 15
minutes at a time.

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:43.760
The device became far to hot to operate

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:48.010
normally. If you put a  case on it quite
a bit better but of course then you're building

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:48.400
 

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:52.200
more internal heat which could reduce 
the life expectancy of the device overall.

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.600
Now gaming is obviously something we're
very keen on here and I know

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:59.010
so many people are when they buy Android
devices. You know

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.870
it may very well be we're a kind of split
user base is some respects between those

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:03.590
people who are

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:07.760
only looking at their device as a productivity tool and those people who are looking at it as an

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.260
all round entertainment device which
includes high quality gaming.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:15.580
Now when we've been putting this device through its paces and we've put a lot of games through

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:17.690
this device so far in the last three or
four days,

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:20.870
we found a common thing. This device

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:24.640
doesn't get overly hot. In fact I would
say this has some of the best

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:28.060
thermal properties I've actually seen
from a smartphone in the last year.

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:31.390
It's very much comparable to the HTC One
before it

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:35.200
although actually I found the heat
dissipation seems to be better across the

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:36.030
back of the case

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:39.619
the hotspot as it were is much wider

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:43.409
and cooler than you would get from the
original HTC One

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.760
and considerably and I really do mean
considerably better than

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:51.830
the Galaxy S4. The Galaxy S4's primary
problem was the GPU CPU package

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:55.430
and the wifi radio they appeared to be
practically either

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:58.530
next to each other or combined
within the same chip. Now the problem

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.130
there was if you were running the wifi

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:03.729
and running 3D games simultaneously and it was really cranking through

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:07.310
then you would get a massive amount of heat
build-up very, very quickly

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:11.950
up to the point where frankly, it was
uncomfortable. With the HTC One we found

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:15.560
that the heat build-up is well quite excellent really

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.029
and by excellent I mean it doesn't gain
incredible hot spots in one corner.

00:02:20.029 --> 00:02:23.529
The heat is much more evenly distributed
down the casing. Now

00:02:23.529 --> 00:02:26.439
a lot of this comes from the fact that
we've obviously got this aluminium case. It's

00:02:26.439 --> 00:02:27.840
acting like heatsink

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.099
in its own right. And it may very well be
we have a copper layer

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:34.370
of some sort or another metal layer in
here which is acting as a heat

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:34.969
spreader

00:02:34.969 --> 00:02:38.859
inside the case as well. Again what this
is doing is it is moving the heat from away

00:02:38.859 --> 00:02:41.980
from the CPU GPU package and helping  to spread it down the case.

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:45.709
It does mean that you get a sort of hot
spot around this area

00:02:45.709 --> 00:02:48.909
but at no point was it ever
uncomfortable. No point did I get

00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:53.200
sweaty finger syndrome where I  kind of 
put the device down for a bit, let it cool.

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.419
I was able to game quite happily for
30-45 minutes

00:02:56.419 --> 00:02:59.469
even up to an hour and no real

00:02:59.469 --> 00:03:03.620
major problems here with heat build-up.
In fact, you know, overall I would say

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:07.439
this is one of the best devices I've
seen for gaming so far. It may not have

00:03:07.439 --> 00:03:08.290
the fastest

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:11.329
clock speeds from CPU GPU package for
instance

00:03:11.329 --> 00:03:15.180
that we will be seeing in the Galaxy S5 in a few weeks time but ultimately

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:18.349
just because you've clocked something higher
is not necessarily a good thing if the

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:20.120
chip's thermal properties

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.150
mean that at those higher clock speeds it's
obviously using a lot more heat.

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:26.249
You're generally also using a lot more power,
battery power.

00:03:26.249 --> 00:03:30.029
So there has to be a kind trade-off here and
the trade-off also has to be about

00:03:30.029 --> 00:03:33.089
heat and how comfortable the device  is to use over time as well.

00:03:33.089 --> 00:03:37.599
For my mind HTC have scored a bit of a winner here. At no point does this device

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:38.689
become too hot to handle

00:03:38.689 --> 00:03:43.059
even over those long gaming sessions
and the distribution of the heat down the casing

00:03:43.059 --> 00:03:43.519
as well

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:47.519
is excellent and hopefully will lead to
much longer lifespans

00:03:47.519 --> 00:03:50.849
from our CPU and GPU. Heat build-up is a 
killer.

00:03:50.849 --> 00:03:54.099
It lowers life expectancy of devices. Anything we can do to

00:03:54.099 --> 00:03:57.359
move that heat away from the source is
really beneficial.

00:03:57.359 --> 00:04:00.569
Ultimately I think here HTC might
have scored an

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:04.049
absolute winner but we'll have to see
what the Galaxy S5 delivers.

00:04:04.049 --> 00:04:08.019
If it delivers a very similar package that
we saw on the Galaxy S4

00:04:08.019 --> 00:04:11.309
then I may very well be saying the same
thing again - not great for gaming,

00:04:11.309 --> 00:04:15.620
gets a bit too warm in those hot spots. HTC you've scored a bit of a winner here as far as I'm

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:16.139
concerned.
