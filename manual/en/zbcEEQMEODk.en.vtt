00:00:00.909 --> 00:00:05.640
Hi guys, I got this awesome LEGO Technic Twin
Rotor Helicopter set.

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:13.160
It is a 2-in-1 set, so first I'll be building
the twin rotor one and next I'll be building

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:14.750
the single rotor one.

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:18.949
Let's take a look inside.

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:25.980
There's a small bag of Legos, a big bag of
Legos, an instruction booklet for the single

00:00:25.980 --> 00:01:08.640
rotor helicopter, an instruction booklet for
the twin rotor helicopter, and some stickers.

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:55.490
Let's start building!

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:01.130
And that's how you build the Lego Technic
twin rotor blade helicopter.

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:07.680
Pretty neat, huh!?

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:14.700
And at the back, there's this little bay that
cars or people can come out.

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:21.250
It opens and closes.

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:27.970
I also have this Lego 9V train motor that
I got for Christmas, and then I have a battery

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:36.040
pack, and this axle peg and I'm going to connect
the 9V train motor to the helicopter and the

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:37.700
blades are going to spin really fast.

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:46.260
So I connect the peg right here, connect the
motor right here, then connect the wire here

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:47.380
and I'm going to turn it on and see.

00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:48.380
Look, the helicopter is moving a little bit
by itself.

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:49.380
Look how fast the blades are going.

00:02:49.380 --> 00:03:01.940
I'm going to spin it the other way now.

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:18.800
But if you do this, be carefully do not touch
the blade.

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:23.810
The helicopter body is a little too heavy
to fly, but those blades spin really fast.

00:03:23.810 --> 00:03:32.280
I'm going to show it to you one more time.

00:03:32.280 --> 00:04:09.269
