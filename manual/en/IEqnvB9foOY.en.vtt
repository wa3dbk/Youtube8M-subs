Let's do a little summary...

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:18.820
It's been some time since the attack on
 the station.

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:24.120
I was very lucky that I met these two guys

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.900
The worst thing was that I did not know where is Randi

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:43.140
I found his rifle... I didn't know where can i look for him

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:03.220
It looks like that it was pub or something...

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:09.940
Drop the weapon

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:12.860
You'll hurt yourself or me

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.440
Very funny, but I have the advantage

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:20.400
 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.260
Better drop it young man

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.420
Did you hear? DROP IT!

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.520
Good decision, but we'll kill you anyway

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:39.660
Holy shit!

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.680
What?! A Girl?

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.520
Chill out, we are on the same side

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.820
I don't need your help. I'm doing well

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.440
Yeah... I saw

00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:14.960
Hey! Wait!

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.380
I saved your ass

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.180
Alright, what you want?

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.640
What are your plans?

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:33.120
I have to find my friend

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:38.720
I'll help you, but you'll go with me to the city

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.400
My name's Vicky and yours?

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.000
Helix

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.160
Let's go

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.460
We'll wait there

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.260
Damn... What is this place?

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:10.020
It looks like a hospital

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:20.760
Well, well I see that I have guests

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:27.780
Do not worry I'll take care of you

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:33.480
You will never leave me...

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:37.080
NEVER!
