00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:15.050
Hello! Jaystepher presents today a tutorial on how to build a cool little dinette set.

00:00:18.089 --> 00:00:21.089
The first thing we're going to start off with is our dinette table.

00:00:21.089 --> 00:00:24.199
So we're going to take a 4 by 8 plate

00:00:24.199 --> 00:00:26.430
and some smooth tiles.

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.400
I'm going to take a 1 by 6 tan tile,

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.430
we're going to place it in the middle.

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:38.110
Take another 1 by 6 tan tile.

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:42.900
We're going to take two of these 1 by 6 brown smooth tiles,

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.110
we're going to put one at the top,

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:49.230
one at the bottom.

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.760
And two 1 by 4 tiles,

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:56.060
place them on the sides.

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:58.620
We got the top of our table.

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:04.420
We're going to flip our table over, we're going to take eight

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:05.630
of these round studded Lego,

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:10.110
of these round studded Lego,

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.750
take two of them, place them

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.530
on top of each other

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.390
and we're just going to stick them inside the

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:26.390
holes here like this.

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:33.740
So, we'll just make three more of these for a total of four.

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:50.250
There you have it,

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.560
our little dinette table.

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.810
Now to make the dinette chairs is real easy. We're just going to take a

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:57.700
pre-molded chair, got a couple brown ones.

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:00.570
pre-molded chair, got a couple brown ones.

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.650
I'm going to make four chairs. So I'll show you how to make one.

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:06.689
Take one of these 1 by 1 studs,

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:12.219
we're just going to place it on the bottom like this,

00:02:12.219 --> 00:02:19.219
and take one of these 2 by 2 rounded plates,

00:02:19.909 --> 00:02:24.359
place it on the bottom like so.

00:02:24.359 --> 00:02:28.319
There you have it,

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:33.180
A nice dinette chair. I also made three other ones in advance to speed up the process.

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:36.339
Just place them around our table.

00:02:36.339 --> 00:02:38.779
Just place them around our table.

00:02:38.779 --> 00:02:40.620
This is mini-figure friendly.

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:45.049
This is mini-figure friendly.

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:49.699
There you have it,

00:02:49.699 --> 00:02:51.099
a cool looking little dinette set for any Lego home, castle,

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:54.979
a cool looking little dinette set for any Lego home, castle,

00:02:54.979 --> 00:02:59.549
meeting room, maybe doctor's office.

00:02:59.549 --> 00:03:00.209
Thank you for watching!
