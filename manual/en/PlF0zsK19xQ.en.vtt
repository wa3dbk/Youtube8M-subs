00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
If I get serious, they can’t keep up with me.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.800
Finally caught up, huh.

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.960
That’s not one of ours.

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.600
After two corners I won’t even see you in my mirror.

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:39.000
An Eight-Six?! You’ve gotta be kidding!

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.800
After this slow right, there’s a sharp left.
He’s going too fast!

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:49.000
What the hell?! Inertia drift..

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:04.400
Keisuke.. We’re gonna have the best seats 
in the house for tonight’s battle.

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:06.400
Here they come.

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:11.200
Nakazato’s easing up on the gas and waiting for the Eight-Six.

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:18.900
The real starting line comes as soon as we hit the first corner.

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:22.700
The R emblem on the rear is the legendary symbol for
invincibility. Can you get close enough to read it?!

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.900
His inside tires are gripping the rim of the road.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.900
The Eight-Six is catching up to me?!

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:34.000
Not from the outside!

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:35.900
Whoa..

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:47.400
Darn, Another 70000 yen to fix this.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.500
He’s not following. Why not?

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:00.700
Please don’t hit us!

00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:05.100
I admired the last generation RX-7.

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:19.400
That’s my big brother’s strategy. He always lets them get ahead at first, and then catches them later.

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.000
He has improved.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:30.700
I’m going at full power, and he’s right on my tail.

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.600
Too much speed.

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:37.600
He messed it up.

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:41.600
I can’t catch him like this.

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:45.100
Should I try “The other gutter driving”?

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:46.900
What did he just do?!

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:48.600
Outside?!

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:50.300
Their lines will cross!

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:53.600
My big brother has lost.
The legend of the unbeatable man is over.

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:58.700
Ryosuke: I clearly lost.
Takumi: I don’t think that I’m a 
faster driver or anything like that.

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:01.400
Ryosuke: You were very fast.

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:04.700
Ryosuke: See you around.
