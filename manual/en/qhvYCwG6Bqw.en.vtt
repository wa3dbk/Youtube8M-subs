00:00:00.459 --> 00:00:08.260
One of the most common illnesses with milk
snakes is the ingestion of foreign substances,

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:15.460
ie. Their substrate. If they digest too much
of their substrate when their eating a mouse,

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:21.159
it can lead to impactions internally which
can result in death of the snake, or if it's

00:00:21.159 --> 00:00:28.619
caught in time an expensive surgery. To prevent
this, you can take your snake out of the enclosure

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.989
when you feed it, put it in a Rubber Maid
container where there is no substrate to ingest

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:38.320
or you can use a grate or something on top
of the substrate when the snake is feeding

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:44.510
so that it's not right in the shavings when
it's eating. The other thing that sometimes

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:51.690
snakes get, are parasites such as mites. Again,
if it's a captive bred snake it most likely

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:56.769
isn't going to have mites but if it's in an
area where there could be a wild snake that

00:00:56.769 --> 00:01:02.339
was brought into captivity, is wild snakes
transfer the mites to the captive bred snake.

00:01:02.339 --> 00:01:10.070
Now, mites are kind of like fleas on a dog.
Their tiny and look like little black pieces

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:17.000
of pepper walking on your snake and they go
underneath the scales of the snake and actually

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:22.719
just feed on the snake's blood. They're very,
very tough to get rid of. But there are some

00:01:22.719 --> 00:01:29.420
easy methods that are available. There is
a stuff called iVomectin which is available

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:34.380
in injection form. You have to go to a vet;
they'll measure out the correct dosage for

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:40.530
the weight of your snake, and inject it. Usually
it takes a couple sessions, two or three visits

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:46.450
to the vet, two or three doses of the iVomectin
to completely get rid of the mites. There's

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:51.330
also an iVomectin spray. Now there is some
stuff they sell on the market as well to get

00:01:51.330 --> 00:02:00.010
rid of mites. Sometimes it's successful, sometimes
it's not. I mostly recommend, if your snake

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:06.939
has mites, go to your nearest vet that specializes
in reptiles and amphibians. That's your best

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:10.690
bet of getting rid of those tiny little mites.
