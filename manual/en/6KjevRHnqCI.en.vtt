00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:07.279
I need to know how to fix a dehumidifier that
freezes up.

00:00:07.279 --> 00:00:11.430
If the refrigerant is leaking out, it’ll
freeze up to the point that it runs out of

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:13.710
the chemicals to make stuff freeze.

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.830
At that point, it will thaw.

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:19.699
And it won’t work as a dehumidifier at that
point.

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:22.530
And in the mean time, it won’t work as well.

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:27.869
You’ll also get a lot of sweat on the dehumidifier
building up faster than it is designed to

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:32.070
collect, some of which will freeze around
the refrigerant leak.

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.930
What do I do about it having ice on it?

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:38.390
If you need to thaw it out faster, turn it
off.

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:41.730
I suppose a blow dryer would work even faster.

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.420
I thought there was something I could do to
actually fix it.

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.170
You could change the air filters yourself,
in case the dehumidifier is icing up because

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:53.239
of poor air flow through the air filters.

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:58.150
I can see how clogged filters make the motor
run harder to get the same output, but not

00:00:58.150 --> 00:01:00.530
how that causes it to ice up.

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:05.210
The lack of air flow around the dehumidifier’s
refrigerant filled coils can cause the cool

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:07.670
air to become cold enough to freeze.

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:12.649
And there’s not enough air flow passing
through the coils to melt the ice crystals,

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:14.840
so you get a frozen coil.

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.999
So changing the air filter could fix the air
flow problem that causes it to freeze.

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:25.029
It won’t fix a refrigerant leak, but it
could solve freezing due to other things.

00:01:25.029 --> 00:01:29.619
I probably need to wash them with bleach water
anyway to minimize the mold and mildew growth

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:31.319
it could have.

00:01:31.319 --> 00:01:35.560
And then there’s the possibility that your
cold dank basement is just too cold for it

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:41.529
to operate, so putting the equivalent of an
AC coil down there guarantees it will freeze.

00:01:41.529 --> 00:01:45.209
What else could I do to fix the icing up dehumidifier?

00:01:45.209 --> 00:01:50.319
You cannot buy the refrigerant to recharge
it, since only HVAC repair people have that

00:01:50.319 --> 00:01:51.719
license.

00:01:51.719 --> 00:01:56.459
You probably do not have the tools to fix
a leaking condenser or coil, though you might

00:01:56.459 --> 00:01:58.729
be able to replace a leaky valve.

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:02.819
That’s what an HVAC repair person is for.

00:02:02.819 --> 00:02:07.359
Many of them won’t touch a dehumidifier,
so you have to take it to an authorized repair

00:02:07.359 --> 00:02:08.359
place.

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:13.599
However, for many cases, you could simply
solve the problem by turning up the thermostat.

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:18.549
We’re talking about a dehumidifier, not
an air conditioner.

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:21.870
Turn up the thermostat in the room where the
dehumidifier is located.

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:28.909
It is designed to run in rooms that are 65
degrees except for a few basement specific

00:02:28.909 --> 00:02:34.939
ones made to tolerate 60 degrees, and sitting
in a too cold basement guarantees it’ll

00:02:34.939 --> 00:02:35.939
freeze.

00:02:35.939 --> 00:02:40.430
As long as I do not turn cold and damp into
Louisiana summer, that’ll work.
