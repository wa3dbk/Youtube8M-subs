00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.480
Today we are going to show you how to fix up your old bathroom vanity.

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:08.800
First we turned the water off below the sink.

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.460
Then we disconnected the water lines and drain pipe.

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.620
Now the faucet can be removed.

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:22.640
We used a template that came with our new drop in sink.

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:26.480
We outlined the template using a sharpie.

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:30.060
Then we cut the line using a jigsaw.

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:40.580
Next we removed the old sink.

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:45.040
The countertop needs to the sanded for the paint to stick.

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:51.600
Then we wiped the countertop and removed any dust or debris.

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:59.340
Next we applied Rustoleum's counter top coating.

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:07.320
It's easy to apply using a basic foam roller and produces a smooth, washable finish that is stain and chemical resistant.

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:12.540
The durable coating is made to last and stands up to daily wear and tear.

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:17.320
Now we can drop in our new sink that gives a nice contrast.

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.200
The we added a new faucet and drain valve.

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:31.540
We hooked up our new fixtures to water and drain.

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:38.500
Next we add drawer pulls by first drilling a hole and installed the bolts and handles.

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:45.680
The new drawer pulls install easily with included hardware and are a noticeable change for any cabinetry.

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:55.980
Next we cut 45 degree angle on our trim boards to frame out the vanity mirror.

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:00.640
Mirror adhesive was added to the back of the mirror frame boards.

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:06.360
Tape was used to hold the trim boards in place till the adhesive dries.

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.720
Lastly we caulked the seems to finish the countertop.

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:20.640
We let the mirror frame dry for 24 hours then removed the tape.

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:27.580
If you're tired of looking at that old vanity, you can fix it up today without breaking the bank.

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:33.260
Rustoleum counter top coating is a durable solution to change the counter top color.

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.300
While the cabinet pulls add an elegant touch.
