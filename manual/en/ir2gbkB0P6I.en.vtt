00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:06.290
 

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:09.320
I would describe this program as
creative,

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:12.940
collaborative, multi-disciplinary,
eye opening, innovative

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:17.769
and unique. Media is very competitive.
It's dynamic. It's changing

00:00:17.769 --> 00:00:20.710
and the future of media is going to be in the hands of people who not only know how to

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:22.630
make media but also know how to think media.

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:25.890
When I found the Media Production
program I was very interested in

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:29.479
enrolling because it would allow me to
further my academic development

00:00:29.479 --> 00:00:34.040
but also provide me with the industry
experience. This program prepares

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:37.200
talented people to be even better at
what they do.

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:41.610
We have new media designers. We have social media experienced designers.

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:45.880
We have video game designers. It's whatever your, what I tend to call, superpower

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:46.530
is

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.800
we cater to that.

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.829
So we're at Rainbow Cinemas Elgin MIlls in Richmond Hill and we're here premiering my documentary

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:55.560
that I filmed as my thesis.

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:59.230
It addresses the stereotypes, the
various stereotypes, 

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:04.420
in the media that plague black male and
females and how it affects us in reality

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:04.989
and

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:08.289
in our day-to-day lives. I ended up

00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:12.049
creating a hundred-page magazine so I actually designed the layout of the whole thing

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:15.429
including imagery and graphic layout
as well as

00:01:15.429 --> 00:01:16.490
basically writing

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:20.350
the entirety of all my research into it.
There was this gap

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:24.610
of knowledge in the industry and
somehow I was able to fill it with

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:25.210
new information.

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:29.770
My research project was on interaction
design for ubiquitous systems or

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:30.960
ubiquitous computing.

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.670
The mirror was designed to respond and
adapt to the user's actions based on their

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.960
context. A user could zoom in and out

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:41.929
of the mirror without having to use a bunch of different mirrors and tools

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:45.689
to get a closer look. Having an MA in Media Production puts you on the other side

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.700
in terms of you being able to think
about commanding the teams,

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:53.470
commanding the skill sets behind the
technology, the message and

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:56.959
generally the underpinning of all of this
is the story. In the program you are

00:01:56.959 --> 00:02:00.360
able to work with faculty that are very much
invested in their students

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:05.069
and that combined with being able to
access state-of the-art technology

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:10.030
really allows you to kind of explore the realm of creativity without boundaries.

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:13.920
The most memorable moment of the entire
process

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.880
was when I did my defense for my thesis
and they said yes.

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:23.200
It made everything really special and all the hard work

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.020
so worthwhile. I think that what I've garnered from the program has provided me with

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:30.420
invaluable experience which really gives me a competitive edge that I'm

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.940
confident about. The Master's program
really had an impact on me getting hired

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:38.270
in a senior management position at a
young age because it added credibility

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:39.970
to what I do.

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:43.410
This program is ideal for people who are
passionate about media

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:47.410
who want to make content for the rest
of their lives

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:51.390
but want to do it in bigger and better
ways. You should take this program

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:52.930
because it's a year long

00:02:52.930 --> 00:02:56.290
and in that one small year

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:59.320
you learn so much and you can take away
so much from it and you

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:02.900
build lifelong bonds that can really
help you in your

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:06.220
career and your future. It's really a
unique experience and it's different

00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:09.760
for everyone. It's an adventure and

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:14.650
that's worth finding out about.
