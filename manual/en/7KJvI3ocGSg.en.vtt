00:00:02.889 --> 00:00:12.380
This is my second video on the full moon and
the Guru.

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:21.199
What really happens on every full moon is
the enlightened masters; the Yogis, the Siddhas

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:36.820
and the Rishis, although they live in another
dimension, they come to the earth plane on

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:53.810
this day in order to bless the human beings
so that they can receive spiritual blessings.

00:00:53.810 --> 00:01:04.769
The earth plane is suited also for performing
certain rituals and meditation practices.

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:13.450
So the Siddhas come here on full moon days
in order to perform those rituals.

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:27.030
The earth plane is not all that bad, all though
it has become corrupt by many alien races,

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:40.350
invisible as they are and who have tried to
colonize this plane 

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:49.100
and they have corrupted the human genetic
substance so that we are condemned to a limited

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:59.730
understanding and the life of an animal through
this animal body and animal brain.

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:06.219
The brain is based on an intelligence which
is supported by sugar and if we run out of

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:10.950
sugar, our intelligence is gone.

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:20.120
So the earth plane in itself was conceived
for a different purpose, as a living library

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:27.420
as Barbara Marciniak would put it.

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:37.950
The full moon days are important because there
is a breakthrough on these days.

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:44.819
The enlightened beings are there to help us
particularly on the full moon of the Guru

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:52.110
which comes next month where I have program
to meet my people in New York and in San Francisco

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:57.390
is a very important one.

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:11.410
You can accomplish a great deal of things
on this full moon day; make sure to go to

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:21.709
these events if you can and if you donâ€™t
at least be prayerful.

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:33.330
I have said that Guru in other tradition are
the messiahs, the prophets or the founders

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:43.459
of certain traditions like the Sikh tradition;
they also revere their Guru, the Buddhist

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:50.090
tradition reveres their Lamas.

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:59.930
So you can visit them, get in touch with them
on this day, it will do you immense good.
