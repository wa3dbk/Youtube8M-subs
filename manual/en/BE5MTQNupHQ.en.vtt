Hi, I'm Karen for Expert Village. Because
this paper's a little firmer, I'm going to

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:15.400
attach the ribbon on the inside and then I
cut some small pieces of the same color that

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:19.750
I'm going to cover up the end of the ribbon
with. I'm going to do this with double-stick

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:28.820
tape. And I'll just put a little piece of
the the double-stick in there. It doesn't

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:43.440
want to stick. And then stick it to the ribbon.
And then again to a piece just to sort of

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:55.750
hide the ribbon. Like that on one end. And
then you do it on the other end also. A little

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:10.149
bit of double-stick. Here's my ribbon. Stick
it to the ribbon first. And then just the

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:22.270
little piece of the same paper...making sure
the tape doesn't stick out like that. That

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:33.959
will hide our thing. Now, you can..to send
it...or to give it, you can take the ribbons

00:01:33.959 --> 00:01:55.060
and wrap them around the opposite way and
tie it up like a little gift. And that can

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:04.999
go right in an envelope. Then when they open
it, it makes a beautiful star decoration.

00:02:04.999 --> 00:02:17.150
If you tie the two ends together, you get
a beautiful star decoration.
