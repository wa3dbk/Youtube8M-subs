00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:05.860
Today the Insurance Institute is

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:07.259
releasing new front crash prevention

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:10.281
ratings for 24 cars and SUVs.

00:00:10.281 --> 00:00:12.480
Automakers are making these systems more

00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.519
widely available and they're also making

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:16.859
them more effective at preventing crashes.

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:18.900
The advantage of auto brake is that even if

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.430
it doesn't prevent the crash, it will

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.890
reduce the speed and reducing the speed

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.480
reduces the damage to both vehicles

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:26.519
involved and also reduces the likelihood

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:28.230
that anybody in either vehicle will be

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:30.539
hurt.  So the institute rates front crash

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.669
prevention systems basic, advanced or

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:35.309
superior.  Basic systems are those that

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:36.899
have forward collision warning that meet

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:38.760
government criteria.  Systems that add

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:40.770
auto braking can earn advanced or

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.270
superior ratings depending on their

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:44.460
performance in tests at 12 and 25 miles

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.230
per hour.  Our ratings of front crash

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.910
prevention systems are based on

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:49.590
prescribed tests conducted here at the

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.719
test track.  When we're testing a vehicle

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:53.219
we've instrumented it with cameras,

00:00:53.219 --> 00:00:55.920
high-precision GPS that allow us to

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:57.300
measure the position of vehicle, the

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.129
speed of the vehicle, the timing of the

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:00.780
warnings, the timing of the activation of

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.550
the auto brake and ultimately the speed

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.949
reduction that results.  This is an

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:06.270
example of one of our front crash

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.760
prevention tests.  We'll drive straight at

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.920
the fake car at 12 miles per hour, listen

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:12.659
for the warning but I will not respond and

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:14.729
we'll see if the auto brake keeps us

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:19.049
from crashing.  There's a warning (beeping sound)

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:21.630
and the auto brake.  We're already seeing

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:23.280
improvements from automakers since we

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:24.299
launched our front crash prevention

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.570
ratings in 2013. Last year when we tested

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.180
the BMW 3 Series we saw no evidence of

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.920
its auto breaking capability in our 12

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.780
mile per hour test.  The new and improved

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.200
system on the 2014 model reduces the

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.000
speed by seven miles per hour in this

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.770
very same condition but an even better

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.290
system is available on the BMW X5 SUV

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.140
and five series sedan.  It avoids crashing

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.320
under this condition entirely.  Modern

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:50.520
vehicles are designed to protect people

00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.619
when crashes happen.  Front crash

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.020
prevention systems aim to prevent many

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.240
common crashes from occurring in the

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:56.940
first place.

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:06.360
