00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:11.340
Oh my god!

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:12.820
It's SPARKLE time!

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:15.260
Look at this glitter placement I did, guys.

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:17.460
It only took me, like, 18 years of my LIFE.

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:18.980
But I do it for you,

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:20.940
because I want you to see the *SPARKLE*!

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:21.460
KAY,

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:22.300
in all seriousness, it took me,

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:23.100
like,

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:24.220
five or six hours.

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:25.720
But it's TOTALLY WORTH IT.

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:28.740
I started with a dark colored base coat,

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:31.420
I think this was Seche 'Wonderfully Witty'

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:32.620
some navy blue?

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:36.280
I'm using five different colors

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.940
of holo hex glitter from Twinkled T.

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:39.440
Yes.

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:41.220
That's HOLO glitter.

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:42.460
'Cause it's rainbowy.

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.100
Use my code 'SIMPLY' for 10% off

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:46.840
your ENTIRE order of glitter,

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:47.560
and nail vinyls,

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:49.500
and every thing else that Twinkled T has.

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:50.400
Do it now...

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.020
Because there's glitter...

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:54.020
You are getting glittery...

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.780
Look at all the shiny objects...

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:58.620
SoooOOoo~ glittery~

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:00.340
You are getting sparkly...

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:01.180
*harsh reality slap*

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:03.020
Snap out of it!

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.580
It's time to get to work!

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:06.260
To place the loose glitter on the nail,

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:07.960
we gotta make it sticky.

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.260
So we do that by using a clear polish,

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:11.680
NOT a top coat,

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:13.780
because a top coat will get too thick,

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:14.760
and dry too fast.

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.540
And we just take some toothpicks,

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.160
mine are cinnamon flavor,

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:20.340
'cause I liked to lick things that are flavored.

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:21.600
And then you're gonna lick the tip

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:22.420
of the toothpick,

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:25.100
and I really don't think I need to show you that on video.

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:26.520
And then that's how you pick up

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:27.680
the little piece of glitter.

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:29.960
I like to start my glitter placements

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:31.440
at the bottom of my nail,

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.480
and then work my way to the top.

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:34.240
But,

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:35.040
I'm no expert.

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:36.920
Honestly, this is only like the second time

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:38.760
I've ever done a glitter placement,

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:40.160
and this is the first time

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:42.880
that I ever did a full mani.

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.720
All of my nail is glitter placement.

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:45.220
Okay?

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:45.720
So,

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:46.660
you should really just, like,

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:49.060
probably not listen to my tips on this one.

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:51.140
Because I'm sure there's other people out there,

00:01:51.140 --> 00:01:53.100
who have way better tips than I do.

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.620
So when you finish a line,

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:56.700
I'm just going to add another striped line

00:01:56.700 --> 00:01:57.700
down the side.

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:59.260
And then I'm going to keep building!

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.260
So if you notice the hexes,

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:03.120
I'm trying to position them

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:04.860
so that they kinda interlock

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:06.180
with each other.

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:07.500
But they're not completely...

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:08.480
touching,

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:09.520
or overlapping.

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.360
You can really push them together

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.220
as tight as you want them to be.

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:14.640
I like to leave a little space,

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:16.540
so I can re-jig it or move it around

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:17.540
if I need to.

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:18.180
So,

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:18.800
the pattern

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:20.440
that I'm actually making,

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:21.460
is supposed to be...

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.940
a downwards "V" shape?

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:26.040
So that's how you kinda see,

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.540
like,

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:28.280
if you look at the pink, for example.

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:30.620
It's kinda going in one direction?

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:31.300
It's like,

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:31.980
slanted.

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:33.560
It's not straight across the nail.

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:35.620
And then on the OTHER half of the nail,

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:36.380
I'm gonna do it

00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:37.080
going...

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.000
same downwards...

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:39.880
direction...

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:40.520
Err, actually,

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:41.580
upwards.

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:42.280
At an angle,

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:43.020
if you were looking at it.

00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:43.520
But,

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:44.040
whatever.

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:44.720
You know what I mean.

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.520
The design I was going for

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:47.760
kinda reminds me of those, like,

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:48.920
friendship bracelets

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:50.980
that I used to make with a bunch of knots,

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:51.600
in like,

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:54.060
grade seven at sleepover camp.

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:55.540
Those were the 'Good ol' days!'

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.080
But now we do it with glitter on our nails!

00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:59.160
It's just so much more fun!

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.400
Why didn't I do this when I was in grade 7?

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:01.900
Why?

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:04.040
The sides are always a little tricky,

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:05.960
because if you're like me and human,

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:08.460
our cuticles are not hexagon shaped.

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:09.660
So you're gonna hafta like,

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:11.660
move them around and make it work.

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:12.160
Alright!

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:13.520
First half of the nail is done,

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:15.260
and now we do the second half!

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.160
Only 17 more hours to go.

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:21.000
*activate light speed nail montage*

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:31.700
Alright,

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:33.080
now this is the tricky part.

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:34.820
You see how at the bottom of my nail

00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:36.300
there's still some glue space?

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:36.800
But,

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:39.040
an entire hexagon glitter wouldn't fit?

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:40.600
I take some...

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:42.180
what they call 'cuticle nippers'

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:45.440
but I don't actually EVER use these to cut my cuticles!

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:46.780
Do NOT cut your cuticles!

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:47.600
They will look ragged.

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:49.300
Like a dirty old man,

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:50.840
and you don't want that.

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:53.880
So I just cut the little hexagons in half.

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:55.040
And this is definitely

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:56.480
a difficult task

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:57.580
meant for...

00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:00.680
Tiny little leprechauns instead of humans.

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:03.420
Then I just kinda place them where I can,

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:04.160
and

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:05.140
after some point,

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:05.640
I'm like,

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:06.840
oh, I'm sooo tired

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:08.600
of cutting these stupid little pieces up

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:09.340
into... Pieces.

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:10.480
So,

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:11.240
I'm done.

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:13.000
And I don't really care

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.660
if there's extra glue space around.

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:15.480
Whatever.

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:16.200
But there!

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:17.120
Doesn't that look pretty cool?

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:18.380
Look at how shiny it is!

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:20.380
And you can 'kinda' see that it's a "V."

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:21.720
Didn't really turn out...

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.520
That much of a 'deep v' as I wanted.

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:24.220
But...

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:24.920
It's fine!

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:26.180
I'll learn for next time!

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:28.500
Add a really thick coat

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.100
of glossy top coat

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:31.180
to seal it all in.

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:32.760
In fact, I added two.

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:33.340
uh..

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:34.940
I just didn't film the second one.

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:36.060
Make sure to seal the tip

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:37.180
of the nail as well.

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:39.160
And by adding two layers of top coat

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:40.040
and sealing the tip,

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:42.000
the little glitters won't fall off.

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:44.460
'Cause you want this mani to last.

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:45.420
And NOW

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:46.380
it's your turn

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:47.600
to go out in the streets,

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:48.960
and wave your hands around,

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:50.360
and cause car crashes.

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:51.340
No, I'm kidding.

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:52.060
Please don't do that.

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:52.800
But,

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:53.860
if you're like,

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:56.120
need to distract a teacher from cheating on a test,

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:56.920
or something.

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:58.160
You can try waving your nails?

00:04:58.160 --> 00:04:58.660
Like,

00:04:58.660 --> 00:04:59.940
THAT'S probably fine.

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:01.040
'cause no one will die.

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:02.200
This mani is so epic,

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:04.220
I left it on for an entire week at work.

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:06.260
And no one thought I was crazy

00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:07.860
in a professional office environment.

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:08.360
Nope!

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:08.940
Not at all!

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:10.900
Alright!

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:12.040
Thanks for watching!

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:14.400
