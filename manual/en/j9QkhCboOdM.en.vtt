00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:30.660
well we're here in the stables at Equitana
on day two and the action keeps on

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:31.689
coming out of Melbourne

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:35.100
so sit back, relax and enjoy as we bring
you exclusive interviews

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.989
at farmadvisor.com.au
including a chat with Olympian Shane Rose

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:45.989
and legendary rodeo rider Kevin Cooper

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:02.150
Kevin you've had a long and illustrious
career mate, talk us through some of those

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:02.840
highlights

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:07.400
I've been thirteen times Australian national saddle bronc

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.410
riding champion which the world record
and

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:14.530
I've been rodeoing for about twenty-three
years. I've won nineteen titles

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:18.020
altogether. I've won 4 rounds and three team roping titles in

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:25.020
Australia

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.190
Bayer and Tamarang have already indicated that they will be our major

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:42.720
sponsors for the 2013 futurity

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.060
very very exciting from our point of
view. It's our fortieth year celebrations

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.650
we will have in excessive of seven hundred
thousand dollars in prize money

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:53.620
the first round of entries have already
actually closed on the first of

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:54.220
October

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:58.360
we've exceeded last year's nominations
and we're looking to break record

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:01.400
entries once again for next year. Bayer

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.880
became involved with the NCHA as the major sponsor

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.690
in conjunction with the Tamarang
quarter horse stud and we

00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:13.100
sponsored the Bayer futurity

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.880
and supported by Tamarang Stud. It was great exposure for Bayer

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:21.910
our first foray into this equine events and

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:28.910
it's been a been a fantasy Association
so far

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:42.620
were there any learnings out of the bitterness of the Olympic games for you?

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:45.879
yeah its a question is gone over and over
in my mind

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:49.599
realistically I was really happy

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:53.340
even in hindsight, I was really happy
with my program, my

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.060
management, everything. It's just
unfortunate that

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:00.909
things didn't quite hold together the way
we were planning

00:03:00.909 --> 00:03:05.609
and I guess, you know the only one
thing I'd just maybe try and get

00:03:05.609 --> 00:03:10.180
my qualifications done earlier and it may give me more options but

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:12.579
reality is I think

00:03:12.579 --> 00:03:16.430
if I was in the same situation I'd have
done everything the same and just hoped

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:17.299
for a bit more luck

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:21.299
I guess the thing with our sport is
that is different from some

00:03:21.299 --> 00:03:21.939
others is

00:03:21.939 --> 00:03:24.939
if I was a swimmer or perhaps

00:03:24.939 --> 00:03:28.060
you know, other sports where

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:32.840
you only have a short lifespan or ability
to compete in the sport it would change

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:33.879
but even before

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:38.569
London I had horses like
Virgil, the one I'm competing here at

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:39.609
exhibition eventing

00:03:39.609 --> 00:03:42.669
he's been training for the last two
years

00:03:42.669 --> 00:03:46.280
for Rio so there's been a, you
know

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:50.900
a succession plan in place and
Taurus is certainly the horse that I had

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:54.810
at London he's certainly young enough that
he could get to Rio and beyond as

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:55.590
well, so

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:58.620
it's definitely moving forward.
Normandie

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:01.840
the World Championships in France
in two years

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:05.129
and then moving forward to Rio are
certainly my aims and

00:04:05.129 --> 00:04:08.459
I'm doing everything I can to get as
many horses

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:12.349
fit and sound and ready to go that I can
before the games

00:04:12.349 --> 00:04:16.389
reigning is a western discipline. It
involves

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:22.139
spins, turnarounds, it involves big sliding
stops, it involves lead changes

00:04:22.139 --> 00:04:25.449
fast circles, slow circles, all controlled

00:04:25.449 --> 00:04:30.780
one-handed and yeah I think it's a pretty neat sport to

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:34.430
really the top-level

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:38.020
horses and riders are really a team and

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:41.349
they're really in sync and hopefully
that's what you'll get too see tonight

00:04:41.349 --> 00:04:44.349
how important is the partnership between
you and the horse

00:04:44.349 --> 00:04:48.190
when you're competing in reigning? It's
in parity

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:54.690
especially because it's
a judged sport the judges will judge you

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:55.229
on

00:04:55.229 --> 00:04:58.770
on how well your horses is

00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:02.529
willing. So they really need to

00:05:02.529 --> 00:05:07.330
not be wanting to take over. They really have to listen and wait for us

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:11.300
especially these older horses the get shown a lot they kinda get out there and

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:14.710
they're like old war horses, they know the job and

00:05:14.710 --> 00:05:17.860
you know, they kinda wanna to take over so it's

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:22.440
an art in itself just keeping them
you know, on the game and with you

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:25.919
Sean who's the man to beat tonight?

00:05:25.919 --> 00:05:29.979
hopefully I am. No, I think there's
gonna be some good competition

00:05:29.979 --> 00:05:34.090
Warren Backhouse has always got a
few good ones I know

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:37.760
there's a couple of really good
non-pro's, Mick Tayler

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:41.430
has got a really nice horse, so yeah
I think it should be

00:05:41.430 --> 00:05:45.630
a really good competition. Hi I'm here with Holly Dowsett the marketing

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:48.949
manager from Horseland we're at the
stand here at Equitana. Things are going

00:05:48.949 --> 00:05:52.680
crazy behind us. They certainly are Rogan. We're very happy to be here

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:56.039
Horseland's all about being part of the
equestrian community so it's great to be

00:05:56.039 --> 00:05:56.630
here

00:05:56.630 --> 00:05:59.919
talking to our customers directly getting
feedback on products and

00:05:59.919 --> 00:06:04.229
very excited to be here at Equitana. Well
the action just keeps on coming here

00:06:04.229 --> 00:06:05.650
at day two Equitana

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:08.729
I'm here with two of Horselands up-and-coming
superstars

00:06:08.729 --> 00:06:12.300
Chelsea and Rebecca. So far how's the event been for you Chelsea?

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:15.430
it's been fantastic we've been working
really hard

00:06:15.430 --> 00:06:19.610
and really busy, so it's been great. It
looks incredibly stressful for you I

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:20.300
must admit

00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:24.099
and Rebecca the Horseland retail,
things are going well? How's it been to be

00:06:24.099 --> 00:06:25.760
on your feet instead of actually riding?

00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:29.380
It's very different. I'm not used to being
on my feet

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:33.310
it's normally Wilson's job, but it's good
fun to get out of the office

00:06:33.310 --> 00:06:37.139
well here you go guys it's all happening down at Horseland. Pop in down to Equitana

00:06:37.139 --> 00:06:38.789
day two there's lots of sales to be had

00:06:38.789 --> 00:06:42.520
of course thank you three minute angels for making our afternoon a little more relaxing

00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:45.279
