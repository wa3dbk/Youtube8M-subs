00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.860
You - one vodka after another vodka in the buffet

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:20.860
Eyes around the wooden room

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:22.320
And your heart is pounding

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:23.300
Do you remember?

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:29.460
The orchestra slowly descends, gets quiet, says that soon

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.120
Do you remember how with me...?

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:34.500
He already found your eyes

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:37.980
My eyes, you already glide - it will stumble on the way

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:39.840
Right away, in a moment...

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.540
Do you remember how you danced with me...?

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:45.420
You walk away tiptoeing

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.020
And immediately overhead it roared to the waltz

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.140
You grab me for life and death

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:52.540
To a dance

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.780
Grande Valse Brillante

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:59.960
Do you remember how you danced waltz with me?

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.080
With miss, madonna, the legends of these years

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:07.160
Do you remember how the world went to dance?

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:10.140
The world, that felt into your arms

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:14.440
Scared blasphemer, you reached my heart

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:16.860
Secretly blossoming these two

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:20.700
Hovering hot, unisono gasping

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:23.940
Like me, all in conjecture and fog

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:29.860
And these two over two, they are, but they are not

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:32.200
Because covered by eyelashes

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.540
Soon covered, and down

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:36.260
As if they were there

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.560
And they caressed with deep blue

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.900
One, the other one, half by half

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.020
When you roll through the ceiling

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.580
You catch on the stars with the nose

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.740
When you grind on the groun

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.020
You pretend to be a strongman

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.680
You flax your meager muscles

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.840
You push out frail breast

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:13.200
I will have an athlete and a hussar for husband

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.960
Do you remember how you danced the waltz with me?

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.340
With miss, madonna, the legends of these years

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:28.880
Do you remember how the world went to dance?

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.760
The world, that felt into your arms

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:35.580
Scared blasphemer, you reached my heart

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.700
Secretly blossoming these two

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:43.020
Hovering hot, unisono gasping

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:46.080
Like me, all in conjecture and fog

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:51.800
And these two over two, they are, but they are not

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:53.640
Because covered by eyelashes

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:55.480
Soon covered, and down

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:57.900
As if they were there

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.480
And they caressed with deep blue

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:05.240
One, the other one, half by half

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.880
And here the leg got stucked

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:14.960
The sliver in the shoe is imprisoned

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.180
Because he has a hole in the sole

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:21.440
My husband - claimant

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:24.600
But he will pull away

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.920
And now slowly, it's gone

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:36.020
And he is rolling, shuffling with unworn sole

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:42.600
Do you remember how you danced waltz with me?

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:45.680
With miss, madonna, the legends of these years

00:03:46.180 --> 00:03:49.780
Do you remember how the world went to dance?

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:52.560
The world, that felt into your arms

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:56.280
Scared blasphemer, you reached my heart

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:59.500
Secretly blossoming these two

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:03.540
Hovering hot, unisono gasping

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:06.580
Like me, all in conjecture and fog

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:12.200
And these two over two, they are, but they are not

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:13.960
Because covered by eyelashes

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:15.940
Soon covered, and down

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:18.280
As if they were there

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.880
And they caressed with deep blue

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:25.220
One, the other one, half by half
