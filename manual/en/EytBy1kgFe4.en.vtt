Hey, Guy Cochran, here today, and thanks for
tuning into another session

00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:04.180
of the DVeStore Theater.

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:06.700
In this one we're going to talk a little bit
about HD monitoring.

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:09.770
A lot of people are getting HDV cameras, and
when they

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:14.000
go to cut their footage, they're going to
notice that all they can do is

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.430
watch it in this little, tiny monitor, right
here.

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:19.400
What you really want is
an external monitor, such as this one, or

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:20.400
this one.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.620
If you want to go this
route, you can get something from AJA, like

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:30.460
a Kona, or you can go SDI into
this beautiful, broadcast quality monitor.

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:33.250
Here we have a cable which carries HDSDI.

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:37.980
It's a BNC little locking
connector, and this carries both audio and

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.710
video over one cable.

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:41.620
The thing
is, you're going to be spending about $3,000

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:43.750
for the monitor, about $2,000
for the card.

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:47.329
If you want to spend less than $5,000, I suggest
getting this

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:48.329
one here.

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:49.970
This is the Blackmagic Intensity Pro.

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:53.110
It can hook up via
component cables, via this breakout cable,

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:59.920
or it can hook up via HDMI.

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:04.110
We're looking at the back of a consumer LCD
HDTV.

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.560
This is an expensive
monitor that you can pick up locally.

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.319
What you'll notice on the back of
this one is that it does have HDMI.

00:01:10.319 --> 00:01:14.549
We're using the HDMI cable out of the
back of our Intensity Pro, and we can plug

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:15.850
it right in.

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:20.779
This is carrying
both audio and video over one cable, and it's

00:01:20.779 --> 00:01:21.779
digital.

00:01:21.779 --> 00:01:24.579
Now, if you've got an LCD monitor that was
a little bit older, or maybe a

00:01:24.579 --> 00:01:26.979
plasma display, you may not have HDMI.

00:01:26.979 --> 00:01:31.319
In that case, you can use the
Intensity Pro's component cables.

00:01:31.319 --> 00:01:36.200
You get a breakout cable and you feed
your video here and your audio here.

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.009
You've got five cables that you would
have to plug in, rather than just one, but

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:41.630
you can still do it.

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:44.220
You can get
this HDMI monitor for pretty cheap at your

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:49.490
local electronics store, and now
you're able to monitor right out of the timeline.

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:51.819
You're going to be able
to see if your shots are in focus, or if they're

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:55.280
out of focus, and you're
seeing your gorgeous text and everything all

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.439
right there, playing in real-
time.

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:01.320
When you're out shopping for an LCD monitor,
ideally you'd get one that was

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.320
1080p.

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:05.579
This will give you the perfect resolution,
and you won't have any

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:06.579
scaling.

00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:09.000
With these smaller TVs that are very inexpensive,
you might be

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.259
getting a 720p monitor.

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:14.200
In that case, it's going to be 1366 x 768
most

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.450
likely, and you're not going to be getting
the full resolution that you

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.810
would be getting on a more expensive monitor.

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:23.610
1080p is going to be better
than the 720p, especially if you're shooting

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:27.170
HDV, which is 1080i.

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:28.170
Thanks for watching.

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:32.580
