00:00:00.046 --> 00:00:07.496
&gt;&gt; In August of 2012, I had the
opportunity to become a mentor

00:00:07.706 --> 00:00:11.896
for our first International
Space Station project.

00:00:11.896 --> 00:00:16.386
It includes eight girls
from Oahu, high school age.

00:00:16.746 --> 00:00:20.706
And we worked together
over six months

00:00:21.056 --> 00:00:24.246
to create a project
to send to space.

00:00:24.846 --> 00:00:27.176
And the project included
designing, building

00:00:27.176 --> 00:00:31.966
and incorporating
our biology project,

00:00:31.966 --> 00:00:33.886
growing microgreen [inaudible].

00:00:34.946 --> 00:00:38.666
&gt;&gt; Microgreens are basically
baby versions, smaller versions

00:00:38.666 --> 00:00:40.616
of regular plants or herbs.

00:00:41.346 --> 00:00:44.016
And we sent that into
a spaceship shuttle

00:00:44.286 --> 00:00:47.956
and our project stayed there
and grew in microgravity.

00:00:47.956 --> 00:00:49.016
We wanted something that kind

00:00:49.016 --> 00:00:51.066
of represented Hawaii
and who we were.

00:00:51.216 --> 00:00:55.036
&gt;&gt; [Inaudible] may have
limitations to products coming

00:00:55.036 --> 00:00:59.436
in from the mainland, but
if we could grow plants

00:00:59.646 --> 00:01:02.486
on the space shuttle, that
would be helpful for them

00:01:02.486 --> 00:01:04.306
because they could eat
and also provides oxygen.

00:01:04.716 --> 00:01:06.246
&gt;&gt; I am a total space geek.

00:01:06.246 --> 00:01:08.066
I have schooling in engineering

00:01:08.066 --> 00:01:10.166
and then military
training in electronics.

00:01:10.906 --> 00:01:13.126
We got the girls together
and we came to realize

00:01:13.156 --> 00:01:15.246
that this was a group of
girls that was interested

00:01:15.246 --> 00:01:17.636
in the same things that
I was interested in.

00:01:17.636 --> 00:01:21.026
They programmed all
the programming.

00:01:21.026 --> 00:01:22.966
They designed the
circuit board layout.

00:01:23.386 --> 00:01:26.796
They put together the
mechanical watering system.

00:01:26.796 --> 00:01:28.986
&gt;&gt; I did a lot of
the brainstorming.

00:01:29.586 --> 00:01:33.166
And later on, I helped on
designing the circuit board.

00:01:33.216 --> 00:01:36.126
&gt;&gt; I would take the measurements
and then I would draw

00:01:36.126 --> 00:01:39.696
out diagrams on a piece of graph
paper, which I would then input

00:01:39.696 --> 00:01:42.146
into the computer and they would
print them with their printer.

00:01:42.616 --> 00:01:45.466
&gt;&gt; I ended up putting all of
the components onto the board,

00:01:45.896 --> 00:01:48.676
creating the board from
scratch, taking photos,

00:01:48.756 --> 00:01:50.566
putting together a
PowerPoint and presentation.

00:01:51.076 --> 00:01:52.776
&gt;&gt; I worked on programming.

00:01:52.876 --> 00:01:56.336
And my favorite part was
when we're successful.

00:01:56.446 --> 00:02:00.146
So when we hit the play button
and we could see the valve work

00:02:00.146 --> 00:02:01.976
or see the white lights turn on.

00:02:02.456 --> 00:02:04.916
&gt;&gt; We went to Nalo
Farms, which is in Hawaii.

00:02:05.246 --> 00:02:08.006
We met the guy who was in
charge of the Nalo Farms.

00:02:08.426 --> 00:02:10.866
&gt;&gt; He had this cool watering
system for his plants.

00:02:11.236 --> 00:02:12.326
So we took some of that

00:02:12.326 --> 00:02:15.456
and we incorporated it
into our experiment.

00:02:15.976 --> 00:02:20.036
&gt;&gt; Yeah, they came to the
farm, and they walked the farm.

00:02:20.036 --> 00:02:20.976
And a lot of the girls,

00:02:21.086 --> 00:02:23.666
it was the first time
they had been to the farm.

00:02:23.726 --> 00:02:25.366
So we had them come over.

00:02:25.366 --> 00:02:28.546
We had them taste a
lot of the products

00:02:28.596 --> 00:02:29.916
that we grow on the farm.

00:02:29.916 --> 00:02:33.456
And never having seen the
farm, they were surprised

00:02:33.456 --> 00:02:36.386
at how fast things
grow, for example,

00:02:36.386 --> 00:02:37.406
or how slow things grow.

00:02:38.076 --> 00:02:40.436
&gt;&gt; He grew different
things, more organic things.

00:02:40.516 --> 00:02:45.406
He also grew microgreens, and
that's how we actually came

00:02:45.406 --> 00:02:47.976
up with, oh, yeah, maybe you
should send up a microgreen.

00:02:48.046 --> 00:02:52.776
&gt;&gt; The girls that I work with
came in to the program shy

00:02:52.776 --> 00:02:56.896
and less-talkative, less
able to express their ideas

00:02:57.126 --> 00:02:59.766
about science and experiments.

00:03:00.136 --> 00:03:03.406
After the project, I noticed
that they were willing to talk

00:03:03.526 --> 00:03:07.956
to an adult about a
specific engineering idea

00:03:08.416 --> 00:03:10.026
or a programming idea.

00:03:10.026 --> 00:03:11.916
And that was something
they weren't able

00:03:12.206 --> 00:03:13.366
to do before this project.

00:03:13.766 --> 00:03:15.756
&gt;&gt; We questioned ourselves
a lot in the beginning.

00:03:15.756 --> 00:03:18.556
And it was just the sheer
feeling of disbelief

00:03:18.556 --> 00:03:20.046
and awe and astonishment.

00:03:20.396 --> 00:03:21.886
We couldn't believe
that we were even going

00:03:21.886 --> 00:03:22.986
to send something up into space.

00:03:22.986 --> 00:03:24.136
It's like the unthinkable.

00:03:24.496 --> 00:03:25.996
&gt;&gt; Because we didn't
really know each other,

00:03:25.996 --> 00:03:29.976
so we were all super quiet,
and we didn't know how

00:03:29.976 --> 00:03:31.166
to act with each other.

00:03:31.166 --> 00:03:33.376
Then we were like,
we're all underqualified

00:03:33.426 --> 00:03:34.716
to do this because it's NASA.

00:03:34.996 --> 00:03:36.636
&gt;&gt; I mean, this is an experience

00:03:36.676 --> 00:03:39.406
that most people can't say
they've participated in.

00:03:39.996 --> 00:03:42.726
And just the fact that we
sent something up to space,

00:03:42.726 --> 00:03:43.866
it's just really rewarding.

00:03:44.046 --> 00:03:46.066
&gt;&gt; It's been a really
different experience.

00:03:46.316 --> 00:03:48.706
And I'm really glad the
Girl Scouts are going

00:03:48.706 --> 00:03:49.586
into something like this.

00:03:49.866 --> 00:03:51.366
It's a good turn.

00:03:51.766 --> 00:03:53.526
&gt;&gt; All the things that
I've learned here is

00:03:53.586 --> 00:03:54.186
really important.

00:03:55.236 --> 00:03:57.836
Working together,
being open-minded,

00:03:57.836 --> 00:03:58.816
thinking out of the box.

00:03:59.336 --> 00:04:03.416
&gt;&gt; This project kind of
opened up my ideas of going

00:04:03.696 --> 00:04:04.656
into something with space.

00:04:04.776 --> 00:04:09.006
&gt;&gt; This really helped enhance
my interest for science.

00:04:09.226 --> 00:04:13.286
&gt;&gt; I truly was amazed at the
capabilities of the girls.

00:04:13.546 --> 00:04:16.336
You know, my workforce at
my farm is mostly women.

00:04:16.596 --> 00:04:19.396
&gt;&gt; I don't get why people
label things guy things

00:04:19.486 --> 00:04:19.996
or girl things.

00:04:20.036 --> 00:04:20.896
I think it's anything.

00:04:21.006 --> 00:04:24.296
It's just, it's your thing,
it's what you love to do.

00:04:24.296 --> 00:04:27.396
Us eight girls, we came
together not knowing each other,

00:04:27.396 --> 00:04:30.356
and we ended up being successful
and doing this project.

00:04:30.466 --> 00:04:33.666
&gt;&gt; I'm glad there's a lot of
girls that I can relate to.

00:04:33.666 --> 00:04:35.716
And we definitely like
bonded through this.

00:04:36.036 --> 00:04:38.976
&gt;&gt; There are friendships
that they've forged here

00:04:38.976 --> 00:04:40.786
that go beyond when
we have our meetings.

00:04:40.786 --> 00:04:42.396
&gt;&gt; You always hear kids say, oh,

00:04:42.396 --> 00:04:44.176
I want to be an astronaut
when I grow up.

00:04:44.176 --> 00:04:46.286
And then people are like,
oh, yeah, that's cool,

00:04:46.286 --> 00:04:48.816
but then they don't
really see it as possible.

00:04:49.536 --> 00:04:51.716
And I think really assuring
people that it is possible

00:04:52.186 --> 00:04:56.096
for us to dream that big
and the sky is not the limit

00:04:56.236 --> 00:04:57.716
as that one saying goes.
