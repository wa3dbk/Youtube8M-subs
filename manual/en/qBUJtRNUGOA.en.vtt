Book cloth is fabric that is backed with a surface which makes it easier to adhere

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:08.179
to book covers. Not every type of material needs this backing,

00:00:08.179 --> 00:00:11.499
but most thin or cotton fabrics do.

00:00:11.499 --> 00:00:15.509
If you search "book cloth" you can find it for sale online or in some

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:17.140
specialty stores.

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:22.920
Or you can make your own...

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.560
In this tutorial, I'll show you a way to make your own book cloth.

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:30.130
This will make the process of gluing fabric onto your board much easier,

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:34.550
preventing air bubbles or wrinkles and glue seeping through.

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:36.310
What you'll need is an iron,

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:37.910
tissue paper

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:41.320
and HeatnBond UltraHold iron-on adhesive.

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:45.350
The HeatnBond UltraHold can be found at a fabric store or you can find it for sale online.

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.879
First off, don't do this method on your cutting mat!

00:00:51.879 --> 00:00:54.680
The heat from the iron will ruin your cutting mat.

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.280
Start with fabric that is fairly wrinkle-free.

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:58.980
Iron it it flat if you need to.

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.030
Cut the HeatnBond a little smaller than your piece of fabric,

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:06.530
so you have a border. This gives you an area to handle the fabric and prevents the HeatnBond

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:09.660
sticky side from being on the edges.

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:11.920
Set your iron to medium heat.

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:17.150
On your ironing board or table, place the fabric face down and iron the HeatnBond with the rough side down.

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:26.990
Iron each area for about 8 seconds.

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:34.080
Then peel the top layer off.

00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:35.850
Now take the tissue paper,

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:42.850
and iron it on until you see the full shape of the HeatnBond.

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:48.400
Then cut the excess tissue paper off.

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:51.810
It doesn't have to be cut perfectly, because the border will eventually

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.870
be cut off when you use it to make a book cover.

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:59.860
I've tried a few methods on making book cloth, and I have to say,

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:04.840
this one is by far the easiest and has the best results.

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:06.860
Now that you can prepare fabric for bookbinding and make your own book cloth,

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.109
you'll have even more cover design options to choose from.

00:02:10.109 --> 00:02:12.110
I hope you found this tutorial helpful.
