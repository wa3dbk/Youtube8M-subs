00:10
COMM: To the amazement of shoppers, Yakira

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:20.840
the cheetah is happy to be centre of attention
as she poses for photographs outside this

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:27.010
South African supermarket.

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:39.469
00:35
COMM: Although Yakira is tame, she is not

00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:40.519
a pet.

00:00:40.519 --> 00:00:44.039
She was raised at the Kwa Cheetah Project
by Desmond and Elizke Gouws, at the Kwa Cheetah

00:00:44.039 --> 00:00:49.569
Project where the vulnerable species is bred
and later released into the wild.

00:00:49.569 --> 00:00:53.899
00:49
COMM: But because Yakira’s mother sat on

00:00:53.899 --> 00:00:58.359
her when she was young, breaking her hip,
she can never fend for herself.

00:00:58.359 --> 00:01:02.829
00:57
ELIZKE: She spends too much time with humans,

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:08.940
which is not a bad thing um you know given
the situation with her legs unfortunately

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:12.140
she wont be able to released one day and be
free.

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:16.500
01:11
COMM: Growing up with the family dogs Sailor

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:22.730
and Gina and the rescued meerkat, Zulu, Yakira
is about as tame as a cheetah can be, and

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:28.030
she interacts with guests who visit the game
reserve as well as visiting schools to spread

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:30.350
awareness about cheetah conservation.

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:35.360
01:30
COMM: Today, Yakira needs to go to the vets

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:40.070
for an X ray – and happily sits in the backseat
of the car.

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:44.180
Although she is quite curious at what she
can see through the windscreen, she travels

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:48.740
unsecured and doesn’t cause any disturbance
during the journey.

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:57.100
01:53
ELIZKE: Your limo is waiting come.

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:01.100
01:57
COMM: On the way back from the vets, they

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.890
stop at the supermarket for some groceries.

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:08.520
As Yakira can’t be left in the car in case
she goes to the toilet, she is taken outside

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.440
in a harness.

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.120
Unsurprisingly, she soon attracts a crowd.

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.599
02:12
COMM: While it is sad that Yakira can never

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:21.609
live a normal life in the wild, she is well
cared for, and on this occasion was able to

00:02:21.609 --> 00:02:42.680
bring a smile to some unsuspecting shoppers’
faces.
