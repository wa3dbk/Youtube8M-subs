00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:05.060
Hi, I'm Tony Northrup and for chapter 4 of
my book Stunning Digital Photography,

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:06.490
my daughter, Chelsea and I are

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:09.860
out at a baseball diamond to demonstrate
why you

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:15.190
should learn to use back button focus.
Back button focus is a technique that

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:18.429
stops your camera from auto focusing
when you push that shutter button

00:00:18.429 --> 00:00:19.109
halfway.

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:23.669
Normally you push the shutter button halfway, your
camera autofocuses and then when it focuses

00:00:23.669 --> 00:00:26.800
you push it all the way to take a
picture. And that's awfully convenient

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.679
especially if you don't know how to use
a camera.

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:31.730
But if you separate the focusing

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:36.180
and the picture taking, it opens up a
whole new world of possibilities and

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:38.070
allows you to take pictures so much

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.520
faster. And one of the best examples of when to use this

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:46.420
is sports photography. But it's also terribly
useful for

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:50.340
night photography, portraits, wildlife,
weddings

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.329
candid shots. Just about anything you might
do, back button

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.329
focus can make it better. So first I'm
gonna show you just how much better

00:00:58.329 --> 00:01:01.609
by taking a couple of shots my daughter
here. Now,

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:06.730
she's batting and when she's at home plate
I like to use focus recompose so I can

00:01:06.730 --> 00:01:09.810
put hervright at the edge of the frame and
use that rule of space to leave plenty of room in

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:10.390
front of her.

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:14.140
But when she's running down the baseline,
my camera's auto focusing system needs all

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:16.130
the help it can get to keep up with her. So,

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:19.790
in other words when she's batting, I want
to use single focusing,

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:24.170
known as one shot for Canon cameras or
AF-S for just about anything else.

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:28.030
And then when she is running I want to use continuous
focusing, AFC

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.100
or a just AI servo

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.570
on Canon cameras. And it would be a little
tough

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:38.530
to switch modes while I'm trying to take
pictures because

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:41.680
I don't know when she's gonna hit
the ball, right, but as soon as she does I'd have

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:43.360
to switch modes and that could take a
little bit.

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.540
So I'll demonstrate taking pictures without

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:49.140
using back button focus first.

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:02.580
Nice one, Mad. So there you can see, I

00:02:02.580 --> 00:02:07.110
did manage to switch from single focusing to continuous focusing in a couple

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:08.470
shots before she got to

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:11.620
first base, but I'm also really practiced
with my camera.

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.800
If you weren't quite so good at switching modes
it would take you even longer.

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.790
But with back button focusing I won't
have to switch modes cause I'll leave my

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:20.780
camera in continuous focusing

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:24.440
and when I want to do focus recompose I
just hold down the

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.819
AF-On button or whatever but I've
assigned to use back button focus

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:31.540
and I'll hold it down until the focus is on her on the mound and I can recompose

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:34.920
and not worry about the camera refocusing.
Then when she starts running I'll just hold it

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.580
down and keep the focusing point on her.

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:40.319
Because it's already in continues focusing mode, there's no need to change modes.

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:44.399
So let's see how many shots I get using back button focus.

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:58.600
Great, awesome.

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:04.540
So you can see there was almost no delay
there. All I had to do was to

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:08.219
put the focusing point on her and then
hold down that back button focus. It took me

00:03:08.219 --> 00:03:09.260
less than a second

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:12.560
and that gave me 10 times more shots

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:16.859
of her running down the baseline. So now
that I've sold you on the usefulness of

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:20.329
back button focus, how do you actually
get it set up? And unfortunately it's

00:03:20.329 --> 00:03:20.959
different for

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:24.680
every single camera. All I can do is tell
you to search

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:28.099
for the model number of your camera and
the phrase "back button

00:03:28.099 --> 00:03:32.639
focus" in, say, Google. So you might say "Canon
70D back button focus"

00:03:32.639 --> 00:03:36.790
and you'll find somebody has nicely
provide instructions for you. In general,

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:41.450
it can be a one step process or a multi-step
process. Usually you have to find

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:44.530
the setting in your camera that turns off

00:03:44.530 --> 00:03:48.220
autofocusing when you push the shutter
button halfway down. Then if your camera

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:50.430
doesn't have a dedicated AF-ON button,

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:53.959
you need to assign autofocusing to one of
the buttons on the back

00:03:53.959 --> 00:03:57.689
of the camera. Those two steps are enough
to allow anybody to use

00:03:57.689 --> 00:04:01.639
back button autofocus. It's going to take some
practice though.

00:04:01.639 --> 00:04:05.489
You'll need to use it for a couple days
until the muscle memory kicks in

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:09.010
and you learn to automatically focus using that back button.

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:12.389
And until you get to that point, you might miss a few
shots, so I encourage you to set it up

00:04:12.389 --> 00:04:16.180
and then practice practice practice. If
you ever need to switch back

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:20.260
to your traditional focusing system, just
put that camera over in the green mode or

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:23.550
fully automatic mode and usually the
camera will override all of your

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:25.370
existing settings.
