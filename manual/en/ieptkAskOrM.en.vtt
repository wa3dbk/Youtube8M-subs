00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:21.939
The Chinese Consulate?!?

00:00:21.939 --> 00:00:25.220
How'd you boys let it get this far
without informing me?!?

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:28.430
That was a delicate undercover operation!

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:30.100
Hijo de puta!

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.019
They have no record of the dead man.

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.440
De Salvo did his job.

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:38.100
Bring him in, Sanchez.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.500
You asked for me?

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:44.240
Ah, yes. De Salvo.

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:47.659
You left a few unsolved mysteries
on the Madagascar, huh?

00:00:47.659 --> 00:00:52.079
A chilled off and that Chinese crooked
dame, Luli May Tang.

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.640
You know, maybe someday she makes a good wife...

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:56.120
She doesn't talk much.

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:59.160
Headaches put me in a deadly mood.

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:01.520
You better watch yourself.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.360
Now now Cousin Lee.

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:06.400
 Haven't you read the signs on my luggage?

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.380
"Handle with care"

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:11.960
I'm not window shopping, cousin Lee.

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:15.400
Time you get with my mood.

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:23.160
I've got men for months working on the Tang family.

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:24.720
I got nothing!

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.380
You need to trust me with this, son. 

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:31.900
The police are getting vicious!

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:34.000
I know what I'm doing.

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:36.580
Let me deal with this my way!

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.440
Nick! So good to see you.

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:44.000
You make a good liar, friend, huh?

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.000
I learned from the best.

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:48.200
Imagine that: you are a detective

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.440
- Surprised? 
- Everybody got secrets, right?

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:55.160
Quit the chit chat, Quintero.
This ain't Java time.

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:57.000
What do you got for us?

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.820
I picked up a few cables that Chinese dame
left in her cabin.

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:02.800
Talk about secrets, huh?

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:04.600
You guys pay for information, right?

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:05.640
I'm no sap, you know...

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:12.080
I used to work at a gambling house in Cairo.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.220
And why did you quit?

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:16.850
I broke all the house rules.

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:19.055
You might be worthy to work for us.

00:02:19.855 --> 00:02:21.300
Let's give it some thought.

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.500
Come up with a plan, De Salvo!

00:02:38.549 --> 00:02:40.169
I hope I didn't keep you waiting.

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:46.739
This is my boat.

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:50.370
It's a beauty.

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.190
What do you take me for, cop?

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:04.640
Don't insult me, policeman!

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:06.760
You need me!

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:08.820
I'm Johnny Dragon!

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:12.580
You got it all wrong, Johnny!

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:22.360
Sorry for the interruption.

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:23.920
Hi, Cap.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.320
Looks like you're having problems with your snitches.
