00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.040
 

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:08.130
 

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:12.580
This is Hans with

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:16.630
skis.com. We're at one of our retail locations at Don Thomas Sporthaus

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:20.790
and I just picked up this bum off the street and we're showing our bling off.

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:24.880
I won this tournament, regional soccer tournament in 1999.

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:28.950
Can you top that?
Probably not.
What do you got in your hand

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:33.140
there?
I got gold medal from

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:37.290
X-Games Big Air, that was two days ago and a silver medal from

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:41.380
yesterday X-Games Slopestyle.
I think you win.

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:45.460
Just joking around obviously. This is Henrik Harlaut. Henrik just flew in from

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.670
Dallas today, right? Denver to Dallas? Just came back

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:53.840
from the X-Games in Aspen where he, Saturday, won the gold medal

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:57.960
in the Big Air and yesterday won a silver medal

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:02.040
in Slopestyle. So, how does it feel right now?

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:06.240
Feels awesome. Couldn't be more happy, i guess.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:10.430
Being the big dog at the X-Games, right?
Yeah.
So, you're originally

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:14.550
from, if I understand, my son played hockey and I understand that was your sport

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:18.620
before you started skiing.
Yes. That is correct. When I was young until I was 9

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.670
I always wanted to become a hockey player.

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:26.810
Since being from Sweden obviously it's a really popular sport in your country so

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:30.860
but you guys moved up to Are, right?
That is correct.

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.890
And I skied there before too actually. I used to,

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:39.060
I was there in 92 for the Olympics actually and then we went to Are for

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:43.210
skiing so...what other home mountain

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:47.270
do you have?
Pretty much all over because

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:51.330
I usually, I travel a lot all over and I actually

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:55.380
haven't been back to Are since 3rd of January

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:59.450
2012 so being over a year since I was home, to my home mountain

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:03.510
so everywhere pretty much, in America usually I

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:07.680
like to call Mammoth my home mountain because that's where I try to

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.800
ski as much as possible and I love it there.
Cool. Cool.

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:15.890
So, people probably wonder, you got a nickname, what's your nickname?

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:19.940
It is E-Dollo.
And E-Dollo

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:23.990
what does that, where came that from?
This one

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:28.060
skier that was a very big inspiration, Mikael

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.110
Deschenaux, he came up with it when I was 13

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:36.180
and, yeah, I wanted to get a nickname

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:40.270
and he had one for me.
There we go. Simple enough.

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.330
So, the other thing is, you are traveling throughout the country right now with

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:48.520
Paul Bergeron and Phil Casabon, what

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.600
is behind, what's the story behind that tour?
It is

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:56.720
inspired by skateboarding. We've seen that Eric Iberg

00:02:56.740 --> 00:03:00.770
the manager and owner of Inspired

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:04.970
Media wanted to do it for the past 15 years

00:03:04.990 --> 00:03:09.080
but it wasn't really the time for it and nobody was really feeling

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:13.150
doing it but it's going around and

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:17.200
show some love and inspire kids that don't usually get to

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:21.370
see too many pro skiers and whatever and you just go to their home mountain

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:25.480
and ski with them and just, yeah, spread love

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:29.530
and have fun with them.
It's cool because you guys did, what, 45 resorts

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:33.720
in 60, I think that's about the number, right?
66 days.

00:03:33.740 --> 00:03:37.880
Yeah and that's a pretty cool thing.
Yep.

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:41.960
But again, congratulations for your medals from the X-Games

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:46.000
and we're super excited to have you here. As we say, we're stoked and 

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:50.180
hopefully we can show you a good time tonight and have a lot of kids

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:54.240
come in.
Sounds good to me. Thank you very much.

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:58.270
 

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:02.310
 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:03.991
