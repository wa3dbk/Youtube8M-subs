PATTERNS

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.680
I'm making a pattern

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:35.760
for an overcoat,

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:37.640
an Ulster model,

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:41.240
with patch pockets,
the classic Ulster,

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.640
that comes from England.

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:49.840
The marking

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.240
is demanding

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:56.040
and takes many hours of work

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:58.320
because it has two dots:

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.400
one at the hem

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.000
and one at 10 or 11 millimetres,

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:09.000
depending on the bulk of the fabric,

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.640
because, if the fabric
is lightweight,

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:15.800
it will take

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:18.440
less fullness,

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.640
if the fabric is heavy weight,

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:22.640
it will take more fullness.

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.640
To do a pattern well

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.040
requires at least 4 hours,

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.120
with everything well-explained,

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:39.680
with the collar, pockets,

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.120
sleeves, everything exact.

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.520
This is the result of our pattern.

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:51.640
This is the back

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:57.120
which should take up
the pleats in the centre back,

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:00.920
the position of the half-belt,

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:03.720
the position of the pockets,
the darts.

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.080
Here are the sleeves.

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:13.280
These are the reference dots
for the perpendicularity.

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:15.640
Once that is done...

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.200
it's hung up

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:23.200
and you get the fabric.

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:27.840
In this case,
I chose to make a pattern,

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.280
but it really isn't necessary.

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.040
If you have the jacket pattern,

00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.840
you can cut the overcoat,

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:45.000
but with a light-coloured fabric
the chalk markings are hard to see,

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.480
I feel a bit uneasy

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.560
and so I prefer an exact pattern.
