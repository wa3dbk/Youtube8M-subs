Hi I’m Dr. Scott Chandler with Silver Creek
Dental on behalf of Expert Village.com. This

00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:12.410
clip is about how to floss your teeth. Flossing
is that thing that nobody likes to do or nobody

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:18.080
likes to talk about. Flossing is a really
important way to avoid cavities between your

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:24.490
teeth as well as gum disease which can cause
tooth loss prematurely and they have now linked

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:31.829
that gum disease to a heart disease, stroke,
kidney disease and a whole bunch of really

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:36.840
terrible things. So let’s make sure we are
getting a good flossing done. What I like

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:43.140
to use is some of these newer flosses like
Glide or Oral B satin floss, kind of Teflon

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.860
like floss that is for those of you like me.
I have really hard teeth to get in between.

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:52.850
I use that for an excuse not to floss. Well,
not any more. This Teflon tape is a little

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:57.269
easier to slide this stuff between the teeth.
Now what you want to do with a piece of floss

00:00:57.269 --> 00:01:03.480
is first of all you get you a pretty good
size piece and you take it and wrap it around

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:10.400
your fingers like that so that you have a
good grip. You use other fingers to get around

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:13.860
that thing. Now I will show you a little bit
here on me and then I’ll show the model.

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:19.370
What you want to do is take that floss and
get it right up there in between the teeth

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:25.490
and you see how I’m using my fingers and
thumbs. Okay, now you can see better here.

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:29.890
We’ll take that floss and you want to slide
it right up in between the teeth and then

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:36.990
you wrap it around the tooth to the side and
you slide that up and down, up and down. Don’t

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:42.330
do a saw back and forth. You just want to
go up and down, tuck that underneath those

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:47.220
gums. If you can see that there where that
floss disappears underneath the gums. That

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:52.100
is what you want to have happen. Now if you’re
not a regular flosser for the first week or

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:56.850
two that you floss every day, your gums are
going to bleed and that’s okay. It just

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.590
means that they are not healthy and flossing
is going to get them healthy. So go ahead

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:05.810
and keep flossing and they will stop bleeding.
Don’t panic. What you do then is you come

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:09.989
out above those gums so you are not tucked
under the gums, then you scoot over to the

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:16.379
tooth beside it and same thing, you go up
and down, up and down. Make sure that you

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:21.560
are getting all that plaque off between those
teeth. Now you use that same concept all the

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.879
way around the mouth being sure to get really
well between the molars.
