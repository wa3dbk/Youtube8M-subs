Welcome to Stoked School

00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:17.050
Episode Cult Creator

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:30.359
Hey there! We're gunna talk about these good 'ol

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:33.480
Cult Creators here. The first thing you are going to want to know if how tall they are

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.670
They're 72mm tall. Then you're gunna wanna know how wide they are

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:39.900
They're 43mm wide. And then the contact patch

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:43.580
that's 29.5mm. We also have 

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:46.600
two awesome durometers. We have the 83a and 78a

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.489
And it has super sweet stone ground finish for ya

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:57.019
Now you may have noticed that I said
that these babies have a 29.5mm 

00:00:57.019 --> 00:01:00.250
contact patch with a 43mm width

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:03.579
What does that mean? It means they have a very round 

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:06.610
contact patch, so when they start it's gunna be smaller 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:10.060
and as you wear through it, it is gunna get wider

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:13.600
but don't worry, because that well supported lip is gunna give you a very slidey slide

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:18.979
all the way down to the core. Now let's get down to business. These wheels are probably my favorite wheel

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:24.490
on the entire market out there. These things do everything freeide

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:29.149
They are the slidiest wheels on the market and they

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:31.310
a durability that is outstanding

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.920
What else can you look for? What else can you ask for?

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.149
What MORE could you ask for in a wheel? 

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:43.599
I took these on a Californian fishing trip *wink* if you know what I mean

00:01:43.599 --> 00:01:47.289
and these babies lasted me an entire day!

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:52.470
on one in the sickest runs in all
California. Now if that isn't durability

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.520
I don't know it is. Now let's talk about

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.709
one of my favorite features about this
wheel. It has a massive core. 

00:01:58.709 --> 00:02:02.140
Look at it, it's huge. And what that massive core does is 

00:02:02.140 --> 00:02:06.729
supports those outer lips, so you
know that means, buttery consistent slides

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:10.110
all day long through the entire duration
of said wheel.

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:13.860
And what you're gonna know is even though this is a 72mm tall

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:14.540
wheel

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.860
is that is has a pretty shallow urethane depth

00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:19.280
so that means even

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.790
more control consistent slides all
day long

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.140
but watch out because these wheels are
insanely icy

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:30.260
and they will bite you will ice out and
you will hit the pavement

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:34.890
like here and here and here

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:39.090
Now, let's talk about kickout. What kickout? These wheels don't have one

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:43.959
because they're that dang slidely.
These wheels when you go to go turn them sideways

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:45.220
you just think about it 

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:48.510
and then you're going sideways. Think slide, that's it. 

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:52.430
One my favorite things to do these with
these wheels is super low angle slides

00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:55.780
that means you just tweak out that board a little bit

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:59.670
and hold it at that angle and you just like slide through corners

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:02.920
It is the sweetest thing and these wheels are prime

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:07.290
for it. So these are the raddest wheels on the market. 

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:10.680
They're my favorite wheel, they should be
your favorite wheel. You should go pick

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:12.150
them up. If you haven't tried them

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:16.030
you need do because, like I said, they're
the best wheels on the market

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:20.310
go to Stoked Skateboards (stokedskateboards.com) and pick them up today. 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:23.780
