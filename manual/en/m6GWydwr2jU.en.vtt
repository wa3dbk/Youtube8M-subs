Hi, I’m Wade Lucas, superintendent of the
Olentangy Local School District.

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:09.570
One of the most common questions I receive
every school year involves calamity days,

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:12.030
or snow days as they are sometimes called.

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:16.830
I’d like to to explain why Olentangy will
be keeping its current system for calamity

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:20.040
days and Blizzard Bag assignments.

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:24.810
You may have heard about a new state law that
allows school districts to change from providing

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:30.630
a minimum number of school days to a minimum
number of school hours.

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:36.660
Districts that move to this new hour-based
schedule will no longer have calamity days.

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:42.780
Instead, they will make up lost hours at the
end of the school year only if they have not

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.490
met the state’s minimum hour requirement.

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:51.870
Olentangy’s students receive 176 days of
instruction every school year.

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:58.320
Moving to the state’s new standard would
reduce 176 days by about a month.

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:01.390
That’s a significant difference.

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:06.860
This community expects and deserves far more
out of our services than the state’s minimum

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:07.860
requirement.

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:09.070
Olentangy’s standards have always gone above
and beyond the least required.

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:14.080
So, rather than switch over to the state’s
minimum requirement, we will continue to use

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.160
our existing system.

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:20.150
This means we will continue to have calamity
days.

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:26.480
If we exceed our allotted five calamity days,
then we will use online Blizzard Bag assignments

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:29.130
to make up the days we missed.

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:36.280
We used Blizzard Bags for the first time last
year and we know they did not meet your expectations.

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:41.150
We have listened to your feedback and have
spent a lot of time working to make the assignments

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:44.159
relevant and easier to use.

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:51.009
Hopefully, this will be a mild winter and
we won’t need to use calamity days or Blizzard

00:01:51.009 --> 00:01:52.009
Bags.

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:56.060
But if Old Man Winter has a different plan,
we will be ready.

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:01.140
