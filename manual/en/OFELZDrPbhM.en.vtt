00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:01.160
Steve Dotto here.

00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:03.020
How the heck are you doing this fine day?

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:04.020
Me?

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:06.509
I’m somewhat anxious, if the truth be known.

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:10.969
I’m anxious because I’m about to show
you a very deep piece of software which on

00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:15.879
the surface might not look quite as deep as
it is and I want to do a good job because

00:00:15.879 --> 00:00:17.840
I think it’s a really amazing tool.

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:22.870
I’m also somewhat confused because I’m
trying to figure out how this piece of software

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:25.920
has escaped my notice until now.

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.019
So today, I am somewhat anxious and confused.

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:31.019
Why?

00:00:31.019 --> 00:00:41.579
I will explain everything today on DottoTech.

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:44.469
Let us together look at Explain Everything.

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:50.490
Now this is a mobile app that will work in
iOS, Android and Windows mobile platforms.

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:54.969
The publishers really are focusing this product
on the education market, which is I think

00:00:54.969 --> 00:00:58.559
the reason why it has slipped by my notice.

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:02.820
Explain Everything is a drawing and annotating
tool that uses a whiteboard but allows us

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:11.070
to bring other elements in and it also records
whatever it is you’re drawing or creating

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:16.390
as a video, as a screencast of its own, if
you choose to do that so it’s got some really

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:19.010
cool educational functionality.

00:01:19.010 --> 00:01:25.360
It also has some use for all sorts of other
types of communications.

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.710
You will see as soon as we dive into it.

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.390
The other thing about is, I think one of the
reasons why it slipped my notice is its price.

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:40.200
I think it’s like $3.95 to purchase it,
far and away one of the best values I’ve

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.610
ever seen in software in my life.

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:44.540
So why don’t we just dive into it?

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:45.540
Let’s take a look.

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:48.000
I’ve got it running right now on my older
iPad.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.020
You can see right here, it’s Explain Everything.

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.150
For this demo, I’m using a Jot pen.

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:59.460
This is a pen that has a much more refined
nib than you would get from your finger or

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:00.740
one of the soft-tipped pens.

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:05.460
There are a variety of different styluses
available to you.

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:09.280
This iPad that I have is not pressure-sensitive
or anything like that so it’s just going

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.500
to work kind of as a basic pen but it does
give me a little bit more precision.

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:13.890
I quite like having it.

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:18.310
So let’s dive in to Explain Everything and
have a look.

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:25.010
Basically, if you think about it as a slideshow
creator, it’s like a PowerPoint or Persuasion

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:29.740
where you create a series of slides but each
of those slides, you can create drawings,

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:35.130
annotations, other things upon and like a
slideshow tool, you can import other elements

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:36.130
into it.

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:38.850
But the difference is it will actually record
what you’re doing in real time, which is

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:41.240
very cool and I’ll show you in a moment.

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:44.230
Just at the beginning they just kind of give
you some colored templates which are the preset

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:49.110
colors of pens, etc., but as you look at it,
you realize right away we’re in a graphics

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:50.110
applications.

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:51.110
We’ve got our pen tool.

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:54.070
You’ve got a text tool and you’re going
to recognize what most of the tools down the

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:56.380
side bar are going to do for you.

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:01.520
The unique area is the area right down at
the very bottom of the screen where we see

00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:04.821
a video controller with a red center button
there.

00:03:04.821 --> 00:03:08.150
We can actually start and record everything
that we’re doing.

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:10.720
So let me explain one of the purposes of this.

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:11.720
Why would you want to do this?

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:15.400
Well obviously, if you’re doing a sales
presentation or something like that and you’re

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:20.420
drawing or you’re creating a graphic, that
would be a nice thing to be able to record.

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:27.520
But in the educational space, if a student
has an iPad or a similar mobile device and

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:31.790
they are working on a math problem and working
through it, they can actually record their

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:37.270
thoughts as they go along and it will access
the other media tools within the device.

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:41.910
It will record their voiceover as they’re
drawing, for instance, so that they can work

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:46.480
out an equation and then the teacher can play
the recording back and see the process that

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:47.480
they went through.

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:50.770
So here we see some really profound educational
applications to it.

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:54.810
But for you and I, right now I’m just going
to select the black pen tool right there.

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:58.590
I’m going to select the type and the width
of the pen tip that I want.

00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:00.700
Of course, you can choose a soft tip or a
hard tip.

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:02.950
So you’ve got some nice basic graphic tools.

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:06.980
Once you’ve got that, I now have the ability
to draw on the screen.

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:12.500
Now if I choose to hit the Record button at
the bottom, it’s now actually recording

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:23.190
not just my pen strokes but it’s also recording
everything—isn’t my handwriting good?—I

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:26.840
am saying.

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:36.340
And if I stop this now, I now have a little
video recording which is just if you look

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:41.770
down, slide 1 of 1, so I can create multiple
sessions right while I’m doing this all

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:43.230
at once and I can hit Play.

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:48.510
Actually, let me turn up the volume here so
you can hear.

00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:56.770
I’m not sure if you’ll be able to hear
that very well.

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:57.770
So there we go.

00:04:57.770 --> 00:05:00.919
But it’s recording everything as we go along.

00:05:00.919 --> 00:05:06.370
This just causes my mind to go off like fireworks,
imagining different potential for this in

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:12.110
the style of videos that I produce here on
my channel, for sales and marketing, for training

00:05:12.110 --> 00:05:15.320
as well as education, all of this in an app
that’s $3.95.

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:18.540
Now we can now take this, if we look at the
bottom section over here at the right-hand

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:24.639
side, we have a variety of exporting tools
that will allow us to take and send the content

00:05:24.639 --> 00:05:28.820
out to video and store it in Dropbox in other
areas as well.

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:35.360
Plus, we also have the ability where we can
import existing video or images and we can

00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:40.919
import them onto the page that we’re working
with and real video can actually be running

00:05:40.919 --> 00:05:42.830
while you’re annotating over the top of
it.

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:44.010
So imagine this.

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:47.180
If you’re a golf instructor, you could videotape
your student.

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:52.260
You could bring the video in to explain everything
and you could be annotating over top and drawing

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:58.370
over top of the person taking their golf swing
and describing to them exactly what they’re

00:05:58.370 --> 00:06:04.080
doing wrong and create a video completely
annotating like the old telestrators that

00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:05.750
they used to have in television.

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:08.100
They also have the ability to do that just
with simple graphics.

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:12.479
Pretty much anything that we can see on our
computer screen, we can bring into explain

00:06:12.479 --> 00:06:17.460
everything and then we can work with it and
we can add annotation over top and create

00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:21.040
a video with it before we’re all set and
done.

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:24.820
Is that not a very cool app?

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:30.300
As I say, I’m kind of chagrined at the fact
that it’s been out for a long time.

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:36.790
It’s a very mature product and I’ve yet
to know anything about it and to include it

00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:38.040
here on the channel.

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:40.840
But that now has been dealt with.

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:44.760
We’ve now got our first video on Explain
Everything, a way cool app.

00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:49.860
For education, it’s definitely off the charts
but in so many other areas as well.

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:54.070
I hope you found this video today to be useful,
engaging and entertaining.
