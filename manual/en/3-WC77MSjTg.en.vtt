00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.109
the potatoes are small pieces and
we're going to fry them so instead of

dropping this potatoes you know i'm just
going to take a you know spoon like

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:08.189

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:12.570
add the potatoes to this oil just hold
on after you add little bit then keep

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.850
adding little by little if the oil is hot the oil may workflow and we're going

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:23.700
to fry these potatoes till they're slightly
colored and cooked;  now the potatoes are

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:28.229
frying but i'm going to show you the
masala for this you know here

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:35.820
pepper powder, little bit of turmeric, some
chaat masala and some amchur powder ok

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:42.420
coriander powder and some cumin seed
powder and also  lot of chopped

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:49.020
coriander and once these potatoes are fried we're going to add the hot potatoes in

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.490
this and mix it

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.140
of course we're going to sprinkle little bit of salt also in this and you

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.969
want this masala to be slightly to be simmered with this hot potatoes

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:03.390
that's when this masala is going to be
tasty I'm telling you these are going to

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:08.250
be one of the best samosas you've ever tried now you're going to have the masala in

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:13.680
a bowl and we're going to add this hot fried potatoes

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:21.359
in this and we're going to mix all this
masala along with this potato and this

00:02:21.359 --> 00:02:27.840
is the masala what we are going to you know stuff the samosas with ok

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:32.760
i'm telling you this is going to be very
tasty mixture but after you mix this

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.409
just put a lid and let it rest for few minutes after that i'm going to show

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:41.430
you how to make the samosas; now the
masala is all ready i'm going to show you

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:44.519
how to make the sheets for making
awesome

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:49.980
samosas, now I'm going to make this by
taking around 300 grams of flour, in this

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:56.579
for the flavoring i'm going to add ajwain in the dough and in this add right

00:02:56.579 --> 00:03:03.569
amount of salt in the sheet now make a
well and pour around hundred grams of

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:09.510
vegetable shortening oil or ghee
whatever you want to make now add water

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:14.609
and make it a stiff dough that is like poori dough not like chapati, chapati is very soft

00:03:14.609 --> 00:03:21.419
the poori is a tighter dough so we're going to add water and we're going to

00:03:21.419 --> 00:03:25.109
make the dough and another thing is once you make the dough

00:03:25.109 --> 00:03:28.650
we're going to rest the dough that's when
your samosas will come out even

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:29.579
better, now

00:03:29.579 --> 00:03:35.220
the dough is ready all you do is just
take a clean wrap or a cloth and just

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:40.169
wrap it and after resting it for you
know 30 minutes we're going to make the

00:03:40.169 --> 00:03:44.909
samosas, once you rest the dough divide them into the portions you want if you

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:49.439
want bigger samosas you may have to take bigger portions if you want small

00:03:49.439 --> 00:03:50.819
samosas take it

00:03:50.819 --> 00:03:57.239
lemon size because each dough you'll be able to make two samosas;  now roll it

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:03.870
first little bit rounds, for rolling the
pooris or samosa you never

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:09.659
have to use flour because if you use flour first thing oil spoils and you know if you

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:14.819
use the right amount of shortening in the dough then you will be able to roll

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:20.370
the sheet easily look at this first make
it slightly round and then now make it

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:24.930
elongated like egg shape make it slightly thinner, look at this

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:31.550
once you roll it and you'll be able to
see kind of literally the bottom little

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:40.340
bit that's when you cut like this and
you have the dough ready for 2 samosas got

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:40.849
it

00:04:40.849 --> 00:04:46.490
and one more thing is once you roll it
keep one or another and it'll not have a

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:50.300
problem because they won't stick and you can keep like this clean wrap in the

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:54.949
fridge for you know a day or two and still roll the samosas if you add the

00:04:54.949 --> 00:04:59.629
right shortening and the dough is correct they will will never stick now the sheets are

00:04:59.629 --> 00:05:06.949
also ready and to make this samosa is very easy just take the sheet and apply water

00:05:06.949 --> 00:05:10.909
on the edges and fold the samosas

00:05:10.909 --> 00:05:17.180
ok now

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:25.639
put this masala in this the more the
potatoes the merrier the samosas get

00:05:25.639 --> 00:05:33.860
so just seal the edges and press these edges
hot

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:38.870
ok that's when you will be able to seal
the samosas right now put it on the

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:45.289
table and shape them in such a way they stand like little buddhas look at them

00:05:45.289 --> 00:05:47.060
perfect isn't it

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:52.100
so this is our samosas so I'm going
to fill the rest of them now these

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:59.300
samosas are stuffed with our sukha aloo masala and you know the oil is just you

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:02.660
know it should sizzle when you put the
samosas and that's when you'll get even

00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:03.470
coloring

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:10.010
okay that's good now look at these
samosas evenly colored you know if you

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:14.599
put the samosas in really hot oil they
will get colored but the real the

00:06:14.599 --> 00:06:18.919
texture of the samosas will get damage if the oil is slightly low temperature

00:06:18.919 --> 00:06:25.460
the samosas will absorb oil so for the
right thing just put in little low heat

00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:29.479
and then you'll have good samosas, these kind of samosas are very popular

00:06:29.479 --> 00:06:33.410
especially when you're traveling and in
summers without adding onions anything

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:35.360
this samosas stays fresh little longer

00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:47.270
mmm too good dear friends some people also add raisins and other nuts making these

00:06:47.270 --> 00:06:51.830
samosas you know try this samosa and I'm telling you you will not only love these

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:56.240
