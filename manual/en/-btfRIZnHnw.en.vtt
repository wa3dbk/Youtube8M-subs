00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.180
"Flax Seeds &amp; Breast Cancer Survival:
Epidemiological Evidence"

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:10.720
The class of phytonutrients known
as lignans can be thought of as

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:14.660
the Western equivalent of
the isoflavone phytoestrogens,

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:18.160
found in soy foods, popular in
traditional Asian diets —

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:22.360
as they share many of the same
purported anti-cancer properties.

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:26.040
Since, as we’ve explored, soy food
consumption is associated with

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:30.060
both preventing breast cancer,
and prolonging breast cancer survival,

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.980
one might expect the same
to be found for lignans.

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:35.680
Well, we just covered
the prevention angle,

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:39.500
with population-based evidence,
in-vitro evidence, and clinical

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:42.860
evidence supporting lignans in
preventing breast cancer.

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:47.380
But, what about for women already
diagnosed with the dreaded disease?

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:51.440
Three studies, following a total of
thousands of women diagnosed with

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.940
breast cancer, were recently
published to answer that question.

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:59.940
The first was from New York, reporting
substantially reduced risks of

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.700
overall mortality, and especially
breast cancer mortality,

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:07.140
associated with higher lignan
intakes in postmenopausal women.

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.960
"…[A]lthough higher lignan intakes
may just be a marker of a diet

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.740
high in plant foods, specific
combinations of foods particularly

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:19.740
high in lignans may be necessary
to produce effects on mortality-related

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.680
risk factors to subsequently impact
[breast cancer] survival."

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.240
Then there was one out
of Italy, in 2012.

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.360
At surgery, when the women were getting
their primary breast tumors removed,

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:36.600
they had some blood drawn, and within
five years, those that had lower

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.400
circulating levels of lignans
(here in blue) were significantly

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:44.240
more likely to die from their cancer
coming back than those with more

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.860
lignans in their
bloodstream (in red).

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:51.000
They concluded, "lignans might play
an important role in reducing all-cause

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:56.780
and cancer-specific mortality of the
patients operated on for breast cancer."

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:58.980
And, same thing out of Germany.

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:03.080
The latest and largest study to date:
"Postmenopausal patients with breast

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:08.020
cancer who have high serum [lignan]
levels may have better survival."

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:11.540
Here’s the survival curve;
the higher the better.

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.740
Those who had the most lignans
in their bodies tended to live

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:20.500
the longest, and tended to
live the longest disease-free.

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:24.520
So, what should oncologists
tell their patients?

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.280
"Given this objective evidence
that [blood levels of lignans]

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.220
a biomarker of lignan intake
improves breast cancer outcomes,

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:35.160
should we declare success and
recommend that our patients

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.200
with breast cancer supplement
their diet with flaxseed?"

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.880
Not based on laboratory and population
evidence alone, the editorial concluded;

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:49.480
robust clinical evidence is needed —
which I’ll cover in the next video.
