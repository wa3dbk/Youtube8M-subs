Hey, do you want to
do them with me?

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:23.350
Well, if you don't have wings,
just flap your arms, OK?

ABBY: Yeah, but, whoa, wait.

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:56.070
The only problem is--

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:56.290
ELMO: What?

00:00:56.290 --> 00:00:59.397
ABBY: I can't do them while
you're playing your drums.

00:00:59.397 --> 00:01:02.740
ELMO: Well--well--well, what
does, what does Elmo's drums

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:04.457
have to do with Abby's
exercising?

00:01:04.457 --> 00:01:08.083

I exercise, I go like

00:01:08.083 --> 00:01:10.458
this, 1, 2, 3, 4.

00:01:10.458 --> 00:01:12.150

you play the drums--

ELMO: Oh, Elmo goes like this.

00:01:19.038 --> 00:01:20.022

ELMO: Like that.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.036
ABBY: Yeah, and it's really
loud and fast and, well, I

00:01:23.036 --> 00:01:25.630
lose my counting and
I get all confused.

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:28.710
ELMO: Oh, oh, well sorry, Abby,
but Elmo really, really

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.790
needs to practice on
Elmo's drums to

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:32.511
get better and better.

00:01:32.511 --> 00:01:34.780
ABBY: Yeah, but, Elmo I really,
really need to do my

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.090
fairy exercises to get stronger
and stronger.

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:40.746
ELMO: Well, so what should
Abby and Elmo do?

00:01:40.746 --> 00:01:41.662
ABBY: Hm?

00:01:41.662 --> 00:01:44.574
Oh, well, you could stop
playing the drum.

00:01:44.574 --> 00:01:47.475
ELMO: Or Abby could stop
doing her exercises.

00:01:47.475 --> 00:01:48.410
ABBY: Hm?

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:50.550

00:01:50.865 --> 00:01:52.796

ABBY: Oh, dear.

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:55.112
This is a big problem.

00:01:55.112 --> 00:01:57.560
ELMO: Yeah, Elmo and Abby can't
both do what we want to

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:59.340
