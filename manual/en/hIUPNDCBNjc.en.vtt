-Hi, I'm Pedro Freitas and I work on
product innovation here at Netflix.

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:14.290
Here's a quick guide how to use
Netflix on your Apple TV.

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:20.010
You can find Netflix on the second
row of the Apple TV menu.

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.880
After logging in for the first time,
you're presented with several ways to

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:24.490
find something to watch.

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:29.340
The Suggestions for You section provides
you with personalized lists based on

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.920
taste and what you've been watching.

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:37.630
You could use the buttons on your Apple TV
remote to navigate through the lists.

00:00:37.630 --> 00:00:43.870
Selecting a movie, this plays more
information with options to play, rate,

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:46.850
or similar titles to the
one you selected.

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:52.660
You can also select the More button to see
the actors, director, and categories

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:54.930

Netflix catalog by selecting Search from

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:24.270

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:28.610
Simply start typing the name of a title or
an actor that you're looking for and

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:31.790

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:33.950
