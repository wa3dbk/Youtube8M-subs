00:00:04.127 --> 00:00:08.840
Warning: In this experiment corrosive acids are used. Gloves should be worn.

00:00:08.875 --> 00:00:10.619
Greetings fellow nerds.

00:00:10.654 --> 00:00:15.761
I’ve gotten a lot of requests for this so in this video we’re going to make ferric chloride.

00:00:15.796 --> 00:00:19.413
A useful chemical to etch copper clad printed circuit boards.

00:00:19.448 --> 00:00:22.020
Start with 20g of iron.

00:00:22.055 --> 00:00:25.571
I’m using iron nails but steel wool also works.

00:00:25.606 --> 00:00:28.007
Just use whatever iron source is cheaper for you.

00:00:28.042 --> 00:00:35.643
Now add to it 100mL of water and then add 100mL of concentrated 12M hydrochloric acid.

00:00:35.678 --> 00:00:38.293
The acid should start dissolving the iron.

00:00:38.328 --> 00:00:41.472
This can take a couple of days if you’re using nails.

00:00:41.507 --> 00:00:43.769
Steel wool dissolves within a few hours

00:00:43.804 --> 00:00:48.325
but if you’re impatient like me you can speed up the dissolution by heating up the mixture.

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.278
I’m going to put this round bottom flask of cold water on top to recondense any vapors.

00:00:53.313 --> 00:00:55.883
And there it goes.

00:00:55.918 --> 00:01:00.603
Obviously if you’re going to boil acid do this outside or in a fume hood.

00:01:00.638 --> 00:01:04.757
What’s happening at this point is the iron is reacting with the acid

00:01:04.792 --> 00:01:09.629
to produce hydrogen gas and green iron (II) chloride also known as ferrous chloride.

00:01:09.664 --> 00:01:14.911
Once the iron is completely dissolved turn off the heating and let it cool.

00:01:14.946 --> 00:01:18.345
If any of the acid evaporated or boiled off

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.827
just top it up with more acid until the total volume is back to 200mL.

00:01:22.862 --> 00:01:29.148
Now with lots of stirring slowly add 200mL of 3% hydrogen peroxide.

00:01:29.183 --> 00:01:33.216
Do this in small portions since the mixture will heat up a lot.

00:01:33.251 --> 00:01:38.148
If it gets too hot to hold slow down and wait for it to cool before adding the rest.

00:01:38.183 --> 00:01:43.529
What we’re doing here is oxidizing the ferrous chloride into iron (III) chloride,

00:01:43.564 --> 00:01:45.762
better known as ferric chloride.

00:01:45.797 --> 00:01:49.154
If you don’t want to use hydrogen peroxide

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:53.065
then a cheaper way to oxidize it is to bubble air through the solution using an aquarium pump.

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:56.731
Okay I recommend using something a bit stronger

00:01:56.766 --> 00:01:59.264
than this pathetically weak pump but it will still work.

00:01:59.299 --> 00:02:05.219
Over the course of several days the oxygen will slowly react with the ferrous chloride to produce ferric chloride.

00:02:05.254 --> 00:02:10.723
This also has the added advantage of keeping the solution more concentrated than the hydrogen peroxide method.

00:02:10.758 --> 00:02:14.804
Of course the hydrogen peroxide method is faster if you’re impatient.

00:02:14.839 --> 00:02:20.034
Anyway, however you oxidize it, it’s now ready for etching printed circuit boards.

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:23.957
To test it we just stick in a small strip of bare copper clad board.

00:02:23.992 --> 00:02:27.773
After a few minutes we have etched off the copper.

00:02:27.808 --> 00:02:32.044
Obviously in an actual PCB production run you would stir the mixture

00:02:32.079 --> 00:02:34.615
so you don’t get that small piece of unetched copper at the bottom.

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:37.517
Anyway we have successfully made ferric chloride.

00:02:37.552 --> 00:02:43.611
You can store it as is or you can evaporate it to get ferric chloride crystals that take up much less space.

00:02:43.646 --> 00:02:48.188
