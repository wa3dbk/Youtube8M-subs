00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:10.680
Since the last nugget on how animal testing
kills humans, I’ve had several inquiries

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:14.450
about what viable alternatives there are.
By the way, now that Ooby’s back, you’ll

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:19.039
be hearing this in the background. *snoring
sounds*. Now animal testing isn't just dangerous

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:23.990
for humans, completely ineffective at producing
any scientifically viable results and totally

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:28.970
driven by greed, but it is not the only option.
During a government meeting about funding

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:34.390
for research, former US National Institute
for Health Director, Dr Elias Zerhoni admitted

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:39.160
that experimenting on animals to help humans
has been a major failure. He told his colleagues

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:43.340
“We have moved away from studying human
diseases in humans. We all drink the Kool-Aid

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:47.590
on that one. Me included. The problem is that
animal testing hasn’t worked and it’s

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:52.039
time we stopped dancing around the problem.
We need to refocus and adapt new methodologies

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:57.100
for use in humans to understand disease biology
in humans.” Stated most simply, by Doctors

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:02.179
MacLennan and Amos “There is no doubt that
the best test species for man is man.”

00:01:02.179 --> 00:01:06.380
So what are the alternatives? I’ll be pulling
a lot of my information from the John Hopkins

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.890
University Centre for the alternatives to
animal testing. Now we don’t have time to

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:13.950
cover all of the alternatives but here are
the basics. There are three main categories.

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:18.200
First there are sophisticated tests using
human cells and tissues. This is known as

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:22.360
in-vitro methods, then there are advanced
computer modelling techniques often referred

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:27.110
to in-silico methods, and third, there are
studies with human volunteers. These and other

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:31.700
non-animal tests are not hindered by the species
differences that make applying animal test

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:36.399
results to humans difficult or impossible.
And, they usually take less time and money

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:41.100
to complete. Here are some examples of in
vitro testing. Harvard University’s Wyss

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.579
Institute of biological inspired engineering
has created organs on chips that contain human

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:49.500
cells grown in a state of the art system to
mimic the structure and functions of human

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.350
organs and organ systems. The chips can be
used instead of animals and have been shown

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:58.340
to replicate human physiology, diseases and
drug responses much more accurately than crude

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:59.890
animal experiments do.

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:03.570
Artery on a chip has been used to study heart
disease and Canadian scientists have developed

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:08.590
microfluidic chips to enable fragile blood
vessels to be studied easily and cheaply.

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:12.750
The device will allow thousands of potential
new drugs to routinely screened for their

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.700
effect on blood vessels. Harvard’s Wyss
institute has produced a breathing lung on

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:21.150
a microchip on 2010. Wyss researchers were
later awarded a grant to develop a spleen

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:26.290
on a chip to treat sepsis. Now they have produced
a physiological realistic gut on a chip which

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:31.040
enables them to study much more complex interactions
than previous cell cultures or animal models.

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.590
They are currently working on more than 10
different organs with the ultimate goal of

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.390
linking them all together with fluidic channels
to produce a more representative model for

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:39.390
testing medicine.

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:44.180
Ceetox bought by Cyprotex, developed a method to
assess the potential of a substance to cause

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:48.209
a skin allergy in humans that incorporates
Mat Tek’s epidurum tissue model, a three

00:02:48.209 --> 00:02:52.690
dimensional human cell derived skin model
that replicates key traits of normal human

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:57.080
skin. Researchers of the European Union Reference
Library for the Alternatives to Animal Testing

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:01.560
developed five different tests that use human
blood cells to detect contaminants in drugs

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:05.019
that cause a potentially dangerous fever response
when they enter the human body. The non-animal

00:03:05.019 --> 00:03:08.799
methods replaced the cruel use of rabbits
in these painful tests. Now some examples

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:13.049
of some In silico models. Researchers have
developed a wide range of sophisticated computer

00:03:13.049 --> 00:03:16.360
models that simulate human biology and the
progression of developing diseases. Studies

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:20.510
show that these models can accurately predict
the way that new drugs will react in the human

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:25.269
body, now some examples of research with human
volunteers. A method called micro dosing can

00:03:25.269 --> 00:03:29.379
provide vital information on the safety of
an experimental drug. Volunteers are given

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:34.189
an extremely small one time dose and sophisticated
imaging techniques are used to monitor how

00:03:34.189 --> 00:03:38.470
the drug behaves in the body. Advanced brain
imaging and recording techniques such as Functional

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:43.000
Magnetic Resonance Imaging with human volunteers
can be used to replace archaic experiments

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.060
in which rats, cats and monkeys have their
brains damaged . These modern techniques allow

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:51.299
the human to be safely studied down to the
level of a single neuron, like in the case

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:56.129
of Intracranial Electroencephalography. Yet
another alternative are human patient simulators.

00:03:56.129 --> 00:04:00.970
These are strikingly lifelike computerized
simulators who breath, bleed, convulse talk

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:05.750
and even die. They have been shown to teach
students physiology and pharmacology better

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:09.920
than crude exercises that involve cutting
up animals. The most high tech simulators

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:14.840
mimic injuries and sickness and give the appropriate
biological response to medical interventions

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:19.430
and injections of medications and have been
shown in numerous studies to impart life saving

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:24.480
skills better than courses that require students
to dissect living pigs, goats or dogs . So,

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:28.400
as you can see there are plenty of viable
alternatives to animals testing. The whole

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:32.610
thing is a pretty shitty idea regardless of
the existence of alternatives, but given there

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:37.670
are alternatives that are cheaper, cruelty
free and more effective there really is no

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:42.630
fucking reason to continue testing on animals.
