00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:08.049
Let's begin with determining the
difference between the WS-1/2

00:00:08.049 --> 00:00:13.330
models. The difference between the models
is that we offer a rigid mounted model

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:19.449
called the WS-1/2, and a jointed
model called the WS-1/2-J. The

00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:23.350
concept of the jointed model is to help
those customers who do a lot of

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:28.840
4" 90-degree bends to get through them
easier. You will know it is time to do

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:32.110
some maintenance on the tool when you
see water leaking from the weep ports

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:36.550
and the inlet nut here, or if you notice
that the tool is rotating much faster

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:41.199
than when you initially ran it. If this
occurs, it is time to inspect the high-

00:00:41.199 --> 00:00:47.019
pressure seal and the fluid level inside
the tool. If the tool is rotating too

00:00:47.019 --> 00:00:52.329
fast, you need to add more viscous fluid.
To do this, fill the syringe with the

00:00:52.329 --> 00:00:58.179
fluid and hold the tool with the whip
hose upright in a vise. Unscrew the port

00:00:58.179 --> 00:01:07.299
screw and thread in the syringe. Slowly
squeeze the fluid into the swivel until

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:12.880
excess fluid begins to come out of the
weep holes here. If the fluid comes out

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.110
dirty or watery, continue squeezing in
the new fluid until it has flushed out of

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:22.860
the tool. Now remove the syringe and
replace the port screw.

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:26.940
If the tool is leaking water from the
weep holes, it is time to replace the

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:31.800
high-pressure seal. Begin this repair by
holding the tool and a vise and unscrew

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:37.860
the inlet nut from the body. First, we
will demonstrate the rigid model. Be sure

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.880
not to use the hose hex nut to unscrew
the inlet nut, but rather use the flats

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:52.320
provided here. Unthread the nut from the
hose assembly. Now, let's demonstrate the

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.060
jointed assembly. To take apart this
assembly you will need to begin by

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:04.410
prying out the face piece as shown. Pull
out the O-ring. Now unscrew the inlet nut

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:09.209
by inserting a 7/32 hex wrench
into the ball joint piece and unscrew

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:12.320
the two pieces.

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:36.870
Once the inlet nut is removed, inspect
the face here for any scratches or dings

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:43.709
on both models. Pull off the outer
centralizer. Now, remove the brass seat

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:46.880
and blue plastic seal.

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:54.239
Inspect the brass seat for any dings or
erosion and check the high-pressure seal

00:02:54.239 --> 00:03:00.630
for damage, replace either if necessary.
To replace the seal, be sure to apply

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:05.310
grease to the O-ring first. Now push the
seal into the bore of the shaft and

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:10.319
follow that with a brass seat. Pay close
attention to the orientation of these

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:13.860
parts, making sure that the brass seat
this plays with the chamfered side

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:20.660
facing the inlet nut. After applying
anti-seize, thread and tighten the inlet nut.

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:25.920
This level maintenance should allow you
at least 100 hours of operation. If

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:29.100
you have more than a couple hundred
hours of operation or if the tool does

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:34.190
not rotate smoothly by hand, it is time
for a complete overhaul.

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:47.580
Start the overhaul process by removing
the head from the shaft of the tool.

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:58.100
Look inside the head for any debris that
may have gotten lodged in the jets.

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:06.610
Now remove the inlet nut.

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:16.390
Slide the outer centralizer up and off.

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:25.190
Pull out the brass seat and plastic seal.
You can now pour out the old viscous

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:29.330
fluid into an appropriate receptacle. Pay
attention to the fluid coming out of the

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:33.440
tool: if the fluid has any water mixed in,
you will want to look at the remaining

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:37.250
inner parts for any rust or corrosion,
and also realize that you will need to

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:42.919
do the preventive maintenance more often.
Once the fluid is drained out of the

00:04:42.919 --> 00:04:47.180
tool, you can remove the shaft and
bearings. Separate the bearings from the

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:50.680
shaft, which may require a bearing press.

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:57.740
Pry out the shaft seals from the body
and from the inlet nut, and separate the

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:59.919
O-ring.

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:07.930
Now take all the individual parts and
clean and inspect them for reassembly.

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:12.590
There are a few parts that you may want
to look at closer. Be sure that the

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:18.530
inside diameter of the body is smooth,
and has no grooves. Look at the shaft and

00:05:18.530 --> 00:05:23.630
inspect the inner seal bore for any
grooves. Inspect the inlet nut by making

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:28.970
sure that the seal face is smooth and
has no pits. With each bearing, be sure

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:32.990
that they spin freely by hand with
little resistance or wobbling. Replace

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:38.120
the centralizer if it has been worn
through. Inspect the whip hose and

00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:41.320
replace it if it is worn.

00:05:43.849 --> 00:05:47.979
Now we are ready to reassemble the tool.

00:05:48.669 --> 00:05:54.669
Begin the reassembly by greasing the
inner lips of the shaft seals.

00:05:56.750 --> 00:06:02.140
With the seal installing tool, you can
press the shaft seals into place.

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:15.650
The lips of the shaft seal need to face
into the body here. The other shaft seal

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:21.560
needs to face in the inlet nut like this.
Now, slip the O-ring over the threads of

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:29.390
the inlet nut and apply anti-seize to the
threads. Press the shaft into the three

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:33.980
bearings. Be sure that the pressure is
added to the inside race of the bearings

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:37.570
when putting these bearings on the shaft.

00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:48.050
The inner race should sit flat against
the shoulder of the shaft. Replace the

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:55.760
port screw and insert the fill tube into
the body through the lip seal. Fill the

00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:59.750
body with about a half inch of fluid, and
then take the shaft and bearings and put

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:07.690
them into the body. This will push out
the fill tube.

00:07:09.660 --> 00:07:13.200
After you have done this, you should check
the fluid level and be sure that it

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:21.480
covers the top of the bearings. Replace the
outer centralizer. Install the high-

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:26.900
pressure seal and brass seat and inlet
nut as demonstrated earlier.

00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:42.189
Cover the threads of the show
after with Teflon tape and screw on the

00:07:42.189 --> 00:07:44.520
head.

00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:48.050
If you find that you're experiencing
rotational speed problems, you may look

00:07:48.050 --> 00:07:52.100
at sizing the jets, which eventually wear
out, and understand that these tools are

00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:56.060
easy to modify in order to accommodate
different pump sizes and hose links by

00:07:56.060 --> 00:08:02.330
simply replacing the jets. StoneAge
offers all the parts and tools seen here

00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:06.820
individually and in kits to help you
with your repair.
