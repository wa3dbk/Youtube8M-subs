00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:05.350
OK, so I'm going to show you how to start
doing that chain stitch. It's actually really

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:09.660
simple once you start going, get it started
going. That's the hardest part is starting

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:14.929
it. And so what I'm going to do, I'm just
going to catch a little piece just on the

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:19.280
back side. Don't put it through the front
side like this. Just catch it on the back

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:26.910
side where it comes right out on the edge,
OK? So we have that in, kind of pull it. Oh

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:32.689
I see that it came out. You know what? This
happens a lot. I'm just going to retie a knot.

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:36.829
And I guess maybe I cut it a little bit too
close to the edge, but this time I won't do

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:44.730
that. Do my double knot and I'm going to trim
it and I'm going to start again. I'm just

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.820
going to put it right through the back side.
There it is coming out inside and we pull

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:55.731
it. Oh that's staying in there a lot better.
I'm going to give it another loop so that

00:00:55.731 --> 00:01:00.790
it doesn't come out at all. OK, so now that
this is nice and tight, what I'm going to

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:07.759
do, I'm going to make another loop right next
to it. Just grab a tiny bit then we're going

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:14.380
to have this in this piece. And we're going
to make a chain stitch with these two pieces.

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:19.469
We have the loop here and the piece with the
needle here. We just kind of forget about

00:01:19.469 --> 00:01:26.069
the needle for a minute and what we do is
we put our forefinger and our thumb through

00:01:26.069 --> 00:01:31.859
this and this is what we're going to grab
this thread with. And we grab this thread,

00:01:31.859 --> 00:01:38.490
you pull it through. Here we go, just like
that. And then you just do it over, you pull

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:45.349
this out just like you were going to forget
about the loop and let it go and you get your

00:01:45.349 --> 00:01:49.140
forefinger and your thumb and grab it again.
And you might have to hold the garment down.

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:53.799
There you go. And when I'm pulling it like
this, you just pull it straight out. There

00:01:53.799 --> 00:02:00.840
you go and you just do it over and over. And
this is called a chain stitch and if I wanted

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.989
to, this whole thing would just come apart.
If I pulled this needle away and let this

00:02:05.989 --> 00:02:11.219
loop just slide through here it would go back
to nothing. It would all come apart. That's

00:02:11.219 --> 00:02:19.380
why it called a chain stitch. But I'm just
going to keep going, keep grabbing it and

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:27.580
here we go and this just makes a really big
thick piece of thread. It's almost just like

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:34.920
that elastic, but it's not stretchy. And a
lot of dresses will have this like on the

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:39.220
back where there's a little eye and a hook
they'll have this. You just keep grabbing

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:45.290
it with a finger and your thumb and your forefinger.
There we go. And I want to just take a quick

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:51.099
measurement just to see if maybe this would
be a good length. I'm going to put it next

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:56.420
to it. Cause it has to be able to fit around
the button and come back. I think I need some

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.830
more.
