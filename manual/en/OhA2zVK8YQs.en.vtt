hi loves

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.560
for this tutorial you'll need 1 yard/meter of fabric

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:13.060
an iron

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:15.980
a non-seperating zipper

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:19.220
pins

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:21.280
fabric scissors

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:22.320
and a sewing machine

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:27.400
first I cut a large piece at the top of my fabric

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:30.840
this is the piece I will use for the waistband

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.900
now it's time to create the folds in the fabric

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:39.860
what I do is fold it double

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:41.560
and then press it a little bit

00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:46.220
then I do the same thing on the other side and continue until it's large enough

00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.080
to fit my waist but also fit my hips

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:08.760
to make it easier for myself I already sew this part so the pleats stay in place

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:18.300
now I make sure my waistband fits the skirt by cutting a piece

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:28.260
Then I place it on top and pin the top as well

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:31.360
this is the part that we will sew afterwards

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.640
since the fabric is quite stiff I press it again

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:16.760
place the zipper with the wrong side up on the side of your skirt

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:20.920
pin it in place and then sew along

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:49.340
sewing a zipper on is quite tricky as you have to make sure that you sew it along the fabric side

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:52.880
without touching the parts that are hard otherwise your needle might break

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.680
now turn your skirt to the other side and then pin your zipper to that side as well

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:46.080
then open your zipper to make it easier when you're sewing

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:17.880
now that the zipper is in place we will sew the bottom and sew along these lines

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:39.020
now that that's done I will sew the waistband in place

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:42.540
fold it over and then sew along the bottom line

00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:07.840
I like my skirts short so I cut a little piece but if you like it longer you can leave it like that

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:09.700
then I hem the bottom

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:13.600
turn your skirt to the right side

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:17.820
since the print of the fabric is very good the back and the front look the same

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:22.460
now that it's facing the front I press it again and then it's ready to wear!

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:45.020
and this is the final look

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:46.720
I'm 'sew' excited

00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:51.420
