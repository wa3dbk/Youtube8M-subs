00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:11.050
I'm Steven Collins, I'm an assistant professor
in Mechanical Engineering at Carnegie Mellon

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:16.250
University, and I direct the Experimental
Biomechatronics Laboratory.

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:21.220
Our laboratory's main goal is to develop robots
you can wear on your leg to help you get around

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:22.220
more easily.

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:26.450
We develop technologies for rehabilitation,
where we try to help people relearn to walk

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:30.270
after they've had an injury, and for assistance,
for people with a permanent disability like

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:35.280
amputation, and for augmentation, to enable
people without disabilities to increase maximum

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:36.920
performance.

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:40.559
Our laboratory takes a different approach
to the development of these technologies.

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.969
Instead of using specialized product like
prototypes that take many years to develop

00:00:45.969 --> 00:00:52.890
and can only do one thing well, we use versatile
laboratory based systems that we call, Universal

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:56.820
Device Emulators, and these are very powerful
and controllable systems.

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:02.420
In fact, we have the highest performance prostheses
and exoskeletons in the world, and that enables

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:07.810
us to quickly try lots of ideas about how
to best assist humans.

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:12.600
So our research is building a foundation on an 
understanding how people interact with these

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:19.030
kinds of systems that will enable the design
of the next generation of robots for rehabilitation

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:20.610
and assistance.

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:25.490
One of the uses that we see for this emulator
system is also as a tool for enhancing the

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:27.290
clinical prescription process.

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:34.369
You can imagine, like when you go to an optometrist,
you have this big machine. They change around lens and

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:35.650
they ask you, "A or B?"

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:42.210
We can do that with prostheses by quickly
changing the behavior of this robotic device

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.500
thereby quickly optimize the prosthesis for
each individual patient.
