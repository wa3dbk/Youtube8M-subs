Hi, I'm Kelli, I'm an aesthetician and makeup
artist at Ultra Salon and Cosmetics, and I'm

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:09.490
going to talk to you today about evening out
a ruddy complexion. First thing that you want

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:15.110
to do if you do experience a lot of discoloration
and unevenness or a ruddy complexion, is,

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:20.580
you want to make sure that you're using appropriate
skin care products, making sure- first of

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:26.949
all diagnosing the cause of the ruddiness,
is it from a sensitivity or is it from discoloration

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:32.140
from the sun, and then using appropriate products
to diagnose the reason for the ruddiness.

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:39.079
Either if you're sensitive, getting on a good
gentle cleanser and a calming moisturizer,

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:44.380
or if it's ruddy from discoloration from the
sun, making sure that you're using a product

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:52.289
that's going to help to lighten up that discoloration.
So a couple examples of some products are,

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:58.929
if you're just experiencing a lot of discoloration
you can use like a brightening serum. Basically

00:00:58.929 --> 00:01:07.030
this is a pearlized that when you apply it
it's going to help to even any discolorations

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:13.830
and it's going to smooth overall look of the
complexion, so this is one example of a product

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:19.829
that you can use, this would be more if you're
suffering from a ruddy complexion from UV

00:01:19.829 --> 00:01:25.400
damage. Another example from a product would
be a redness relief product, this would be

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:32.950
more if you're having a problem with either
sensitivity or you have rosacea or something

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:37.159
to that nature. You can see that it's green
based, anything that's green is going to help

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:46.450
to neutralize redness. This is also calming,
it's a gel formula, aloe based, anything with

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:50.860
aloe, chamomile, is going to be very calming.
So you can see it kind of helps to even out

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:56.790
a lot of the discoloration. And once you start
to get on track with a good skin care routine,

00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:01.250
you can incorporate a green foundation primer
in there, and that's going to really help

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:05.579
to even your discolorations and your ruddy
complexion too. So those are some tips for

00:02:05.579 --> 00:02:07.150
evening a ruddy complexion.
