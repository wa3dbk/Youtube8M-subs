00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:24.960
The purpose of the Saint Niarchos Expedition was to survey reptiles in the Indian Ocean.

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:29.590
It's important to undertake a survey like this for a number of reasons. The first is

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:33.989
just having an accurate, current 
information on where species occur,

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:36.150
our distribution of biodiversity,

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:40.250
and that's particularly critical
in terms of preventing future extinctions.

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:42.100
So once you know

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:45.540
what's out there to protect, you can then
make smart decisions about where you

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:47.790
put your limited resources

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:51.100
The second thing is by collecting new
information,

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:56.440
observations, genetic samples.

00:00:56.440 --> 00:00:58.550
This actually allows us to then

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:02.180
understand better about the evolutionary
history of these organisms. It also

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:08.400
allows us to ask sort of interesting questions
about how this region

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:13.950
developed and evolved in this relatively
remote area of the Indian Ocean.

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:17.689
I really wanted to focus on three different island
systems.

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:20.159
And the first islands were the Seychelles,

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:23.260
which are found north of Madagascar.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:28.500
One of the more poorly known reptiles in the Seychelles is

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.750
the chameleon, which occurs there.  The first chameleon specimens that were collected

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:36.530
from the Seychelles were described as two separate species.

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:41.340
But for the last almost two
hundred years, they've always been assumed to

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.340
be a single species. We now know from the genetic data that they are, in fact, two species.

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:48.259
So essentially

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:51.700
these first descriptions made two
hundred years ago were actually correct. So

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.400
the _____ survey was really designed to

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.550
take us to the critical islands, really nailing down the distribution of these

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:03.320
two species. I was immediately
joining an experienced team of people

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.760
that I had worked with previously, who were

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:09.029
fantastic at catching chameleons.

00:02:09.029 --> 00:02:10.839
What we actually did was

00:02:10.839 --> 00:02:14.269
then visit a series of islands that we'd identified were

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:16.459
key priorities.

00:02:16.459 --> 00:02:18.789
The first of those islands was Silhouette Island.

00:02:18.789 --> 00:02:22.969
What we were doing is intensively at
night going out looking for chameleons.

00:02:22.969 --> 00:02:27.239
In the case of Silhouette, what was really fun about it was that the chameleons were there.

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:30.280
They were actually healthy populations

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:37.129
and I think over the course of three nights, we recorded in the order of thirty to

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:38.849
forty animals.

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:40.009
So after around

00:02:40.009 --> 00:02:44.319
Silhouette, we then took on the
high-risk part of the

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:47.869
expedition, which was to survey the islands where chameleons had never been

00:02:47.869 --> 00:02:51.899
found before or where there were museum records that

00:02:51.899 --> 00:02:56.039
were very old. Sadly we didn't find any
populations. One of the things about biodiversity

00:02:56.039 --> 00:03:00.069
is that surface area is a good predictor of a species' richness.

00:03:00.069 --> 00:03:04.400
In the case of islands, the smaller the island gets, the fewer species it has.

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.489
In the case of the Seychelles and the chameleons, this is sort of the typical pattern we

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:09.680
are seeing here.

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.709
The second expedition

00:03:11.709 --> 00:03:16.489
to the Mascarene Islands. This really interesting volcanic system,

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:19.499
which were formed from an ancient
hot spot.

00:03:19.499 --> 00:03:24.550
The oldest island is Rodrigues
and that the youngest is La Reunion. And I was

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:25.319
surveying both

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:27.879
those areas for reptiles.

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:32.589
Once we got to Rodrigues, the intensity of
the survey immediately kicked in and we spent the

00:03:32.589 --> 00:03:35.049
the next twelve days surveying

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:40.239
mainly Rodrigues and these off-shore islets. It's really been

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:44.790
transformed since humans arrived there
around the seventeen hundreds. The first

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:49.199
people who settled
started clearing vegetation

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:51.019
and species.

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:55.649
There have been surveys done in Rodrigues, but not all the rocky islets and islands

00:03:55.649 --> 00:03:57.589
have been surveyed, and

00:03:57.589 --> 00:04:02.180
even on the mainland there's some
uncertainty. For example, there were geckos

00:04:02.180 --> 00:04:07.809
on Rodrigues, which have never been seen in terms of living animals.

00:04:07.809 --> 00:04:11.229
The best place to look for those were in
the bottom of these steep canyons,

00:04:11.229 --> 00:04:15.979
which would have never been cleared for cultivation. We were also surveying rocky

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:21.840
outcrops in the hope that we might find
some rock-adapted geckos. During

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:26.439
the day it's walking through forests,
scanning, and looking for movements.

00:04:26.439 --> 00:04:31.360
The fine things like skinks we put in these pitfall traps, and we also, at night, go out

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:33.000
with headlamps

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.060
and look for animals that are active at night, which is particularly important for

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:40.870
seeing species that are otherwise you could very easily overlook.

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:45.039
There were four house geckos that we commonly came across, but

00:04:45.039 --> 00:04:47.259
what we actually

00:04:47.259 --> 00:04:50.739
found that was sort of interesting was that
each of these islands seem to have its own unique

00:04:50.739 --> 00:04:55.900
complement of different species. In the
case of one of these house geckos

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:59.620
_______, we actually found some interesting size differences

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:04.580
between different island populations,
which suggests that since

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:08.800
the time that they actually reached these islands there's already been some local adaptation.

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:14.370
It gives us an opportunity to actually see a new cycle of evolution starting. During La Reunion,

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:17.680
we did five surveys starting

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:21.639
from sea level all the way up to about fourteen hundred meters.

00:05:21.639 --> 00:05:26.049
And a higher elevation has very little reptile diversity.

00:05:26.049 --> 00:05:30.999
The amphibians are restricted to just these introduced toads, which are pretty much found everywhere in Reunion.

00:05:30.999 --> 00:05:34.870
It still has an active volcano on it and

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:40.030
you really get the sense that through this
volcanic activity that

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:41.270
if there were a species

00:05:41.270 --> 00:05:44.129
formerly evolved there they would have gone extinct.

00:05:44.129 --> 00:05:48.620
Many of the forests that we surveyed in Reunion looked just absolutely beautiful,

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:50.919
but they were sort of eerily quiet.

00:05:50.919 --> 00:05:55.259
I remember being at one site at six hundred meters and putting down a half-eaten tin of

00:05:55.259 --> 00:05:57.349
corned beef,

00:05:57.349 --> 00:06:00.599
and I forgot about it about six hours later, and I came back.

00:06:00.599 --> 00:06:06.129
Not a single insect on it. It was still sitting there completely untouched and uneaten.

00:06:06.129 --> 00:06:09.240
We found introduced species

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:10.999
and once we hit the coast of _____ we were

00:06:10.999 --> 00:06:13.700
surveying, we found things like the _____

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:16.069
_____ gecko on the island,

00:06:16.069 --> 00:06:21.229
but we were hoping we'd find skinks or these _____ day geckos.

00:06:21.229 --> 00:06:25.610
We didn't find any populations. The
surveys really provided a lot

00:06:25.610 --> 00:06:31.480
more information now about what
the situation is for these different islands.

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:37.150
That has important implications for conserving those species and of course

00:06:37.150 --> 00:06:39.740
allows us to then think about moving
onto the next step.
