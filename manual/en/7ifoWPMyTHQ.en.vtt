00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:05.769
&gt;&gt;WELL, THIS HAS BEEN

00:00:05.769 --> 00:00:06.889
QUITE AN EVENING.

00:00:06.889 --> 00:00:08.420
FULL OF TWISTS AND TURNS.

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:11.059
LIES AND DECEPTIONS, BUT I HAVE FINALLY EXAMINED

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:14.309
ALL THE EVIDENCE AND HAVE DISCOVERED SOME TERRIBLE THINGS.

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.470
SOMEONE HERE HAS BEEN KEEPING A SECRET.

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:17.000
&gt;&gt;WHAT?

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.660
AND I KNOW EXACTLY, WHO IT IS.

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:23.480
&gt;&gt;[LAUGHS AND CLAPS]

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:24.980
VERY GOOD INSPECTOR.

00:00:24.989 --> 00:00:26.860
VERY GOOD INDEED.

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:29.419
SO YOU UNCOVERED THE FACT THAT I HAVE BEEN EMBEZZLING MILLIONS OF

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:32.570
POUNDS FROM MY BUSINESS PARTNER, LORD BRANSTON.

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:33.579
&gt;&gt;WHAT?

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:34.989
HOW COULD YOU DO THIS TO ME?

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:37.879
&gt;&gt;THE POOR FOOL HAD NO IDEA UNTIL THIS NIGHT.

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:40.030
I MUST CONFESS THAT THOUGH I HAVE BEEN DISCOVERED,

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:43.109
IT BRINGS ME NO SMALL AMOUNT OF JOY THAT HE NOW KNOWS

00:00:43.109 --> 00:00:45.300
THAT IT WAS ME ALL ALONG.

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.100
[LAUGHS]

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.220
&gt;&gt;UM, I DIDN'T KNOW ANY OF THAT.

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:53.100
&gt;&gt;YOU DIDN'T?

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:56.559
&gt;&gt;NO, I WASN'T GOING TO SAY THAT AT ALL.

00:00:56.559 --> 00:00:58.359
&gt;&gt;AH, WELL.

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:59.320
DANG IT.

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.840
&gt;&gt;SO, WHAT WERE YOU GOING TO SAY INSPECTOR?

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.320
&gt;&gt;WELL, I HAVE IRREFUTABLE EVIDENCE THAT SOMEONE HERE

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:11.369
IS NOT WHO THEY SAY THEY ARE.

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.079
&gt;&gt;HOW DARE YOU!

00:01:13.079 --> 00:01:15.559
&gt;&gt;[LAUGHS AND CLAPS]

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:16.840
 VERY GOOD, INSPECTOR.

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:18.740
SO, WE ARRIVE HERE AT LAST.

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:21.030
I KNEW YOU WERE ON TO ME, BUT I MUST CONFESS I DIDN'T

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.530
THINK YOU'D FIGURE IT OUT.

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.110
I HAVE BEEN POSING FOR YEARS AS THE LONG LOST

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.070
SON OF THE ARCHDUKE.

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:26.520
&gt;&gt;WHAT?

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.759
YOU MEAN YOU'RE NOT MY SON?

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.390
&gt;&gt;NO.

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:34.950
NO, I SIMPLY WANTED YOUR INHERITANCE.

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.369
&gt;&gt;I KNEW IT!

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:39.560
I KNEW IT BECAUSE WE HAVE DIFFERENT COLOR
EYES.

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:42.039
IT'S THE EYES!

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:43.689
&gt;&gt;BRAVO, INSPECTOR.

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:45.340
VERY IMPRESSIVE.

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:47.390
&gt;&gt;YEAH, I DIDN'T KNOW THAT EITHER.

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:47.789
&gt;&gt;SERIOUSLY?

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:48.200
&gt;&gt;NO.

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:50.920
BUT TO BE FAIR, I PROBABLY WOULD'VE FIGURED

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:52.240
THAT ONE OUT ON MY OWN.

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:55.009
DIFFERENT COLORED EYES IS A DEAD GIVEAWAY.

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:59.189
&gt;&gt;WELL IT SEEMS I GAVE MYSELF AWAY THERE.

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:00.250
AGAIN.

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:01.409
CARRY ON, INSPECTOR.

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.560
PLEASE, DON'T LET ME INTERRUPT YOU.

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.649
&gt;&gt;WELL, IT APPEARS THAT SOMEONE HERE

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:08.160
HAS BLOOD ON THEIR HANDS.

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.830
[GASPS] &gt;&gt;[CLAPS AND LAUGHS]

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.760
AH, THIS TIME, WE ARE ON THE SAME

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.530
PAGE INSPECTOR.

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:18.220
IT WAS I WHO MURDERED THE MAID.

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.569
YES, IRREEFUTABLE EVIDENCE.

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:23.670
SPEAKING OF WHICH, SHE HAD IRREFUTABLE

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.819
EVIDENCE THAT I WAS NOT THE ARCHDUKE'S SON.

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:28.260
SO NATURALLY SHE HAD TO BE TAKEN CARE OF.

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:29.870
OF COURSE, I DIDN'T REALIZE I'D BE

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:32.590
REVEALING THAT SECRET MYSELF JUST A FEW HOURS LATER,

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:36.760
BUT AT THE TIME IT SEEMED VERY IMPORTANT TO KEEP HER QUIET.

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:38.030
BRAVO INSPECTOR.

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.290
HOWEVER DID YOU TRACE IT BACK TO ME?

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:41.349
&gt;&gt;I DIDN'T.

00:02:41.349 --> 00:02:41.870
&gt;&gt;WHAT?

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:45.239
&gt;&gt;YEAH, THERE IS NO WAY I WOULD HAVE FIGURED THAT ONE OUT.

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:46.940
&gt;&gt;INSPECTOR, I'M BEGINNING TO WONDER IF YOU

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:48.450
EVEN KNOW HOW TO DO YOUR JOB.

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:49.060
&gt;&gt;WELL, I DON'T KNOW.

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.730
SO FAR YOU'VE CONFESSED TO THREE CRIMES.

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:53.080
&gt;&gt;TOUCHÃ‰.

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:55.780
&gt;&gt;INSPECTOR, PLEASE.

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.440
TELL US WHAT THE ACTUAL SECRET IS.

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.860
&gt;&gt;VERY WELL, I HAVE DISCOVERED-

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:02.810
&gt;&gt;THAT I'VE BEEN BRIBEING THE PRIME MINISTER!

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:03.409
&gt;&gt;NO.

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:05.500
&gt;&gt;THAT I IMPERSONATED A PRIEST?

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:06.159
&gt;&gt;NO.

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:08.400
&gt;&gt;THAT I AM NOT DISABLED!

00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.709
[GASPS] &gt;&gt;DANG IT!

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:12.260
DANG IT!

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:13.799
DANG IT!

00:03:13.799 --> 00:03:17.370
&gt;&gt;BUT I HAVE FOUND OUT THAT YOU WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE BRIDGE

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:20.290
COLLAPSE EARLIER THIS WEEK THAT CLAIMED A
DOZEN LIVES.

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:22.200
&gt;&gt;[GASPS] &gt;&gt;I HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THAT.

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:22.489
&gt;&gt;REALLY?

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:24.340
&gt;&gt;NO, IN FACT, I WAS OUT OF THE COUNTRY

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:25.250
WHEN THAT HAPPENED.

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:27.400
COMMITTING A TOTALLY DIFFERENT CRIME.

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.829
&gt;&gt;OH WELL, I MUST HAVE MISSED

00:03:29.829 --> 00:03:30.810
SOMETHING THEN.

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:32.349
&gt;&gt;AH, INDEED.

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:34.750
LOOKS LIKE THE GAME'S TO ME INSPECTOR.

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:37.620
OH THAT'S A DUD.

00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:38.340
&gt;&gt;HM.

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:40.720
WELL I'M STILL ARRESTING YOU FOR THOSE OTHER THINGS.

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:41.370
&gt;&gt;BUT!

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:42.670
OH, RIGHT.

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:45.650
CAREFUL, THESE LEGS HAVE HAD LITTLE USE.

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:49.079
&gt;&gt;I WILL HOLD ONTO THIS, BECAUSE I--

00:03:49.079 --> 00:03:52.860
[LAUGHS] ACTUALLY DESTROYED THE BRIDGE.

00:03:52.860 --> 00:03:55.420
[LAUGHS] WAIT A MOMENT.

00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:56.560
[BUBBLE SOUNDS]
