Hi. It's Mr. Andersen and in
this podcast I'm going to talk about X-Inactivation.

00:00:09.879 --> 00:00:14.809
Sometimes we call this lyonization and that's
kind of giving credit to the person who discovered

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:19.030
most of this which is Mary Lyon. But I want
to start the whole thing by talking about

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:23.940
calico and tortoise shell cats. Calico cats
like this one and tortoise shell cats like

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:29.900
this are almost always female. Which puzzled
scientists for a long time until we finally

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:33.739
figured out how that works. And it puzzled
Mary Lyon as well. Here she is. She worked

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:38.519
at Cambridge. But basically what she found
is that when she was working with lab rats,

00:00:38.519 --> 00:00:41.989
some of them would be a white. Some would
be a grey. And some would be kind of a tortoise

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:46.249
shell between to two. But what she found is
that most of those tortoise shell mice were

00:00:46.249 --> 00:00:51.739
females. And so most of them had two X chromosomes.
And she was also working on chromosomes and

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:56.199
why some disorders are more prevalent in females
then they are in males. And so we know that's

00:00:56.199 --> 00:01:00.879
sex-linkage. But basically what she found
is that when you look into the nucleus of

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:07.879
a cell, so this is in the nucleus, in every
cell of every female, one of the X chromosomes

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:12.409
will be active. And so it works perfectly.
But the other one is going to be inactive.

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:17.990
It's going to fall apart. And so if you're
a female, in all of your cells, only one of

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:22.610
the X chromosomes is active and the other
one is inactive. It's okay though. Because

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:27.570
you're fine. On guy's side, same thing. We
only have one X chromosome and so sex chromosomes

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.590
like this are kind of designed to just work
on their own. And when it breaks apart like

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:37.109
that we call that a bar body. Or that X chromosome
is now inactivated. And so let me kind of

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:41.289
talk you through how this works. Well basically
when you were born, well before you're born,

00:01:41.289 --> 00:01:46.250
when you're a zygote, that zygote, if you're
a female will have two X chromosomes. And

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:50.140
those X chromosomes will be copied when the
cell goes through mitosis. And so we go from

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:54.789
having one cell to two. And then to four.
And then to eight. And I could keep doing

00:01:54.789 --> 00:01:58.359
this, but basically when you get a big ball
of cells like this, these are called stem

00:01:58.359 --> 00:02:02.619
cells. They're cells that can become any other
cell. But right around this time when you

00:02:02.619 --> 00:02:07.109
start to get this big blastula there's basically
a flip of the coin that goes on in each of

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:13.810
the cells. And so one of the X chromosomes
will simply wad up and become inactivated.

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:17.060
So this one might wad up. And it's fifty-fifty
chance which are the ones that are going to

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:21.650
wad up. So it might be that one. It might
be that one. So it's totally random which

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:28.349
one's going to wad up in each of these. Now
the one that's left, it's going to be able

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:32.239
to express all of the genes that are found
on that. And what's interesting is that all

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:37.879
of the cells that come from this cell, likewise,
are going to have one X chromosome that's

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:43.569
inactivated. And then one X chromosome that's
activated. And so basically this stem cell,

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:48.239
once that flip of the coin is occurred, it's
for the rest of the life of the cell and all

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:52.739
the cells that come from that. And so that
tells us why a calico cat is female. And let

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:57.620
me talk you through that. So if you're a male
cat you could basically be an orange or a

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:02.129
black cat. Or you could be a white cat if
you're lacking the pigment on the hair. And

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:05.650
so let's look at this. So it's found on the
X chromosome. If you have the black gene on

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:09.390
your X chromosome, since you only have on
X chromosome, then you're going to be a black

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:15.090
cat. If you have the orange gene on your X
chromosome then you're going to be an orange

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:18.799
cat. And it's pretty straight forward. Because
in every cell there's going to be an X chromosome

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:22.840
with that gene making that pigment color.
Now let's look at the female side. So if you're

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:28.180
a female cat and you have two X chromosomes,
if both of them are black gene, then you're

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:33.560
going to have a black cat. Now what you should
know is that in each of the cells of this

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:38.970
cat that produces this black pigment on it's
skin, it's going to be a different X chromosome

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:43.680
that's working in each of those. So that flip
of the coin has occurred. Likewise if we've

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:48.239
got you know an orange gene on each of those
X chromosomes, same thing. It's going to be

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:54.709
orange. But what's weird is if you're heterozygous
for it. So if you're this, if your a female

00:03:54.709 --> 00:04:00.200
who has one X chromosome with a black gene
and one with a orange gene, well, how could

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:04.650
this occur? Well simple. Let's say we match
this, a black cat with an orange cat, and

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:08.530
then all of the offspring are going to be
like this. And so what is it going to look

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:13.590
like? Well, this is not a great animation
or a great picture, but basically what you

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:18.620
will have is splotches of black and splotches
of orange. And so let's look at this black

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:25.240
right here. Basically what happened is at
the stem cell stage, the orange gene basically,

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:30.620
this orange gene became a bar body. So it
became inactivated and all the cells that

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:35.360
came from that produced black pigment. I think
that's really cool. Likewise in one's where

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:40.330
the black one wadded up, all of the cells
that come from that are going to produce orange

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:45.169
pigment. And so that's X inactivation. It's
rare that we see this occurring and that's

00:04:45.169 --> 00:04:49.430
just because sex cells are designed to work
on their own. The X chromosome. Now two quick

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:53.430
questions you should be thinking right away.
Is number one, what about the white? Why do

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:57.300
we get this white coloration. Well if you
remember when I talked about genetics there

00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:01.580
was a process called epistasis. And so basically
there's going to be a set of genes that determine

00:05:01.580 --> 00:05:05.810
the color of the pigment that's added to the
hair. But there's going to be another gene

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:10.860
or set of genes that are actually going to
tell us, is that color added to the hair or

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:16.560
not. And that's called epistasis. And so basically
in these cells we're not actually adding the

00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:21.520
pigment. But up here we've got X inactivation.
Another question you should be thinking to

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:25.880
yourself is at the beginning I said almost
all calico cats that you'll ever see are going

00:05:25.880 --> 00:05:31.930
to be female. Well how could we ever have
a male calico cat? It's pretty simple, but

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:38.229
maybe non-intuitive. But basically what you
could get is a XXY male. And so how does that

00:05:38.229 --> 00:05:43.360
occur? Well during meiosis you could get non
disjunction of the two X chromosomes. And

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:47.889
so basically you could get one that is of
the orange. One that is of the black. And

00:05:47.889 --> 00:05:53.460
so you could have a, we call this Klinefelter's
syndrome in humans. But you could have a calico

00:05:53.460 --> 00:05:58.940
male. But again, it's going to be incredibly
rare. So that's X inactivation. It's rare

00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:02.889
that you could see this in humans. However,
I was reading and there's a disorder in humans

00:06:02.889 --> 00:06:07.039
where they lack sweat glands. You could imagine
that's really, really dangerous because you

00:06:07.039 --> 00:06:12.449
can't regulate your temperature. And what
I found was that if you have or are heterozygous

00:06:12.449 --> 00:06:17.069
for this in some females, they'll actually
have patches of their skin where they have

00:06:17.069 --> 00:06:20.440
sweat glands and patches where they don't.
And that's just due to X inactivation. And

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:20.690
I hope that's helpful.
