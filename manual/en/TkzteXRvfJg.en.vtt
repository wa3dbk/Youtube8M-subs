Hi! This is Dave for expertvillage.com. We’re
making jambalaya today. We have got quite

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:24.690
a few of the elements. Now, we are going to
make the spice mix that is going to make this

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:29.970
really special. So, what we want to do again
this is going to be for 100 people. So, this

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:37.339
is going to be in this amount. We are going
to do for that many people, about 15 teaspoons

00:00:37.339 --> 00:00:41.979
of salt. So, I would like to measure by hand.
You can use a measuring cup for sure. I have

00:00:41.979 --> 00:00:49.469
got a pretty good eye for this after all these
years, so that is about 15. Also, we want

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:55.209
to add some bay leaves, about 10 or 12 of
them for 100 people, and just a couple you

00:00:55.209 --> 00:00:59.839
are just going to have 10 people or so. Then
next would be oregano. We are going to put

00:00:59.839 --> 00:01:06.340
in about 15 teaspoons of that as well. So
again, we’ll start out, I do there about

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:15.049
2 and then 4, and then as I say I have a pretty
good eye for these days. And then, we can

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:25.259
go to white ground pepper. This one is going
to be about 7-8 teaspoons of this. This is

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.780
pretty spicy. You think black pepper could
be spicy, but this is actually a little bit

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:40.909
spicier than black. So you have got that in
there. Next, will be our black pepper. I usually

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:46.319
like the table ground type or you can actually
grind it yourself, a table grind has a little

00:01:46.319 --> 00:01:53.180
more texture too it and a little more flavor
to it, and this one we want 10 teaspoons of

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:58.890
that. We can go over the recipe later than
that, we can adapt all of this to a smaller

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:10.429
amount. So, do not worry about large amounts
of everything. Next will be our thyme, this

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:23.420
is about 10 teaspoons also.

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:29.349
Now for my favorite ingredient is cayenne
pepper, depending on the spiciness you like,

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:34.239
be judicious with this, and I like it pretty
spicy, the cayenne actually gets you in the

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:38.590
back of the throat. Really a nice feeling
instead on your tongue, so you can’t taste

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:44.580
anything after it. So, really nice ingredient,
and really necessary in all Cajun meals. Now

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:49.519
this one as I say, you might want to go easy
on it until you have regulated your taste

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:59.379
on it, but for this amount of people, I usually
like to put about 5 or 6 teaspoons of cayenne.

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:08.780
See, the beautiful red color to it, and now
with this mix all put together, now mix it

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:17.280
up again, you could use measuring spoons,
mixed that all up well, and that is going

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:23.769
to be a key ingredient in this jambalaya that
is going to really spice things up.
