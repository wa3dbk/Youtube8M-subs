00:00:00.314 --> 00:00:01.414
Greetings.

00:00:01.482 --> 00:00:02.915
Greetings,
my genetomate.

00:00:02.983 --> 00:00:04.417
How was your day

00:00:04.485 --> 00:00:06.419
Ferrying humans
across the grid?

00:00:06.487 --> 00:00:07.920
[ cones hum ]
acceptable.

00:00:07.988 --> 00:00:09.989
Tips could have
been better.

00:00:10.991 --> 00:00:12.492
Ahh!

00:00:14.495 --> 00:00:15.928
The impending
cone prepares

00:00:15.996 --> 00:00:17.430
For its emergence.

00:00:17.498 --> 00:00:18.431
Ahh!            Ahh!

00:00:18.499 --> 00:00:19.932
[knock on door]

00:00:21.535 --> 00:00:22.768
[knocking]

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:26.873
It's khoudri.

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:27.874
Ahh!

00:00:27.941 --> 00:00:29.876
Welcome, my employer
and landlord.

00:00:29.943 --> 00:00:31.377
Beldar, forgive
my intrusion.

00:00:31.445 --> 00:00:32.879
Rhavi is sick.

00:00:32.946 --> 00:00:36.382
Can you work
the midnight shift,
use my car?

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:37.383
Most certainly.

00:00:37.451 --> 00:00:39.351
This is the last
triple shift.

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.854
The birth spasm
is near.

00:00:41.922 --> 00:00:45.458
Once again,
you have pulled me
from the fire.

00:00:47.961 --> 00:00:49.896
Beldar, you have
been working

00:00:49.963 --> 00:00:51.898
Through your
slar phase again.

00:00:51.965 --> 00:00:54.199
Goz deprivation
is not good.

00:00:54.267 --> 00:00:56.686
This dwelling
is no longer acceptable.

00:00:56.753 --> 00:01:00.889
It is not good enough
for you and our young one.

00:01:00.957 --> 00:01:03.892
We must settle
in a safer neighborhood,

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.394
One with better schools

00:01:05.462 --> 00:01:07.896
And a stronger
local economic matrix.

00:01:07.964 --> 00:01:09.898
We are no better off

00:01:09.966 --> 00:01:11.900
Than we were
two zerls ago.

00:01:11.968 --> 00:01:14.403
This ranch-style
dwelling is available

00:01:14.471 --> 00:01:17.673
At $6,900 down with a 9%
fixed-rate mortgage.

00:01:17.874 --> 00:01:20.609
But how?
Our currency stock
is insufficient.

00:01:20.677 --> 00:01:21.610
Incorrect.

00:01:21.678 --> 00:01:23.779
I have been saving.

00:01:24.214 --> 00:01:27.216
Ah! I praise you,
earthwoman.

00:01:27.283 --> 00:01:28.283
[rumbling]

00:01:28.352 --> 00:01:30.052
Ugh! Aah!

00:01:35.109 --> 00:01:36.542
My bluevarp has broken.

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:39.211
The birth spasm
has begun.

00:01:41.031 --> 00:01:42.564
Aah !

00:01:42.766 --> 00:01:44.383
Nothing to this.

00:01:44.451 --> 00:01:46.885
Childbirth is
an act of nature.

00:01:46.953 --> 00:01:49.888
Take care of prymaat.
We'll get good pictures.

00:01:49.956 --> 00:01:51.257
Aahh!

00:01:51.325 --> 00:01:51.874
Ugh!

00:01:51.942 --> 00:01:52.908
Ooh!

00:01:52.976 --> 00:01:54.877
I hate you,
beldar!

00:01:54.945 --> 00:01:56.879
I hate you!

00:01:56.947 --> 00:01:59.381
Aahh!

00:01:59.449 --> 00:02:00.816
[crunching]

00:02:08.642 --> 00:02:10.309
[screaming]

00:02:10.377 --> 00:02:13.912
1, 2, 3.
