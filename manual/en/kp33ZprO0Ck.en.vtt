﻿How a Microwave Oven Works EngineerGuy Series #4

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
This microwave oven is a truly remarkable feat of engineering.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
The rapid heating that makes microwaves popular

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
is made possible by power provided from

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.000
this vacuum tube

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Now, if you picture a vacuum tube at all it’s likely in

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
a radio like this.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Inevitably, tiny transistors and microchips replaced

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
clunky vacuum tubes, but it's too soon to

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.000
relegate them to the museum.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Microchips can’t easily replace tubes for producing power.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.000
For example, in heating food.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Now, a microwave contains three main components

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
A vacuum tube called a magnetron

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
it generates the energy that heats food.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
A waveguide hidden in the wall to direct that energy to the food

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
and a chamber to hold the food and safely contain the microwave radiation.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000
In principle, a microwave oven heats no differently

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
than any other type of heat transfer.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
At a molecular level heat is a transfer of energy

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
that results in increased motion of the molecules in a substance.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Since we aren't quantum-sized,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.000
we observe this increase in motion

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.000
as a rise in temperature.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000
In a traditional oven or stove we heat food

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.000
by placing a pan on a burner

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
or in the oven where the walls radiate heat,

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
which cooks the outside of the food.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
The insides cook when heat transfers from the surface

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:36.000
of the food to its interior.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
In contrast, energy from the magnetron penetrates

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
into the food, which means the whole mass of the food

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.000
can be cooked simultaneously.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.000
How does it do this?

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Well, our food is filled with water,

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.000
which is positively charged at one end,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.000
and negative at the other.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
To give these molecules more energy,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
we expose it to electromagnetic waves that emanate from the tube.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
By definition, the waves have electrical and magnetic fields

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.000
that change direction rapidly.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
For this oven, the direction of the fields change

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
two point four five billion times per second.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Water will try to align with the radiation’s electric field.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
The changing field rocks the water molecules

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000
back and forth rapidly and molecular friction

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.000
from this creates heat as the motion disrupts

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
the hydrogen bonds between neighboring water molecules.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Now, you can get an idea of the wavelength of the energy

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.000
emitted from the magnetron using cheese.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000
Now, you can see on here sections where the cheese

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
has completely melted, and other sections where it’s completely unheated.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000
The oven’s metal walls only reflect waves of

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.000
a length that fits inside the oven.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000
This standing wave causes hot and cold spots inside the oven.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.000
The three-dimensional pattern of waves is difficult to predict,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000
but the principle can be seen by looking at

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.000
the waves in a single dimension.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.000
The peaks and valleys in the wave represent

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.000
the greatest energy of the wave,

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000
while the nodes here correspond to the "cold" spots inside the chamber.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
If I measure the distance between melted cheese spots

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
I find about 2 1/2 inches.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.000
That would be half the wavelength

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
the distance between nodes

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
and is pretty close to the actual wavelength of microwave radiation used.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:24.000
Using that wavelength I can estimate the microwave radiation's frequency.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000
The frequency is related to the wavelength by the speed of light.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000
I get an answer that only has a 4 or 5 percent error.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000
Not bad for this primitive measurement.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
Now, the real engineering in the microwave oven

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
lies in creating the magnetron that

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
generates high powered radio waves.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
It's truly an amazing and revolutionary device.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.000
The vacuum tube is inside here.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.000
These are cooling fins

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000
thin pieces of metal that dissipate the heat as the magnetron operates.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000
The key parts are these two magnets and

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000
the vacuum tube.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
Now I have another one so you can see the inside.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.000
You apply a large voltage across both

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:10.000
the inner filament and the circular cooper outside.

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000
This voltage “boils” electrons off the center filament

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000
and they fly toward the circular copper section.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000
The filament is made from tungsten and thorium.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
Tungsten because it can withstand high temperatures

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000
and thorium because it’s a good source of electrons.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000
The magnets bend these electrons so they swing

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.000
back toward the center filament.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000
We adjust the magnetic strength so that the now

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.000
orbiting electrons just brush past the opening of these cavities.

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000
Like blowing over a half filled pop bottle to make it whistle,

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.000
this creates an oscillating wave - the microwave radiation that heats food.

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:44.000
It’s simply astonishing that these cavities can be made

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
with high precision, low cost, and incredibly high reliability.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000
I’m Bill Hammack, the EngineerGuy.
