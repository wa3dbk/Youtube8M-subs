00:00:02.830 --> 00:00:28.420
Here I am inside Spirited Soaps, the shop
here in the main street of Bowmore and this

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:30.980
is Ailsa standing behind me, hi Ailsa.

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:31.980
Hi Vicky.

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:37.670
I'm going to ask you Ailsa if you can tell
us a little bit about how you came to make

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:38.670
soap.

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:40.080
What was your idea, what was your vision?

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:41.080
My vision?

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:46.890
Well I was a chemist and we moved to Islay
six years ago to raise our kids and I thought

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:53.600
about making soap and I thought if I make
transparent soap I need alcohol and we've

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:54.770
a whole island full of alcohol.

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:57.650
So that's the secret ingredient in this soap.

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:04.600
I use vegetable oils, I use coconut, palm
and caster oil and I mix it with caustic to

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.110
make normal - what you'd think of as normal
- opaque soap.

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:13.250
And then while it's still hot in the pot I
add a sugar solution, vegetable glycerine

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:14.520
and whisky.

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:20.920
And what that does is it keeps the soap crystals
very small so that when it sets in the moulds

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:26.030
the soap crystals are held in suspension and
all you're left with is a nice transparent

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:27.030
soap.

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.030
Lovely.

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:29.030
With Laphroaig in it?

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:32.490
Yes those ones here have Laphroaig in it,
yes.

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.580
They're nice scents.

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:37.140
And you've had great interest from all around
the world.

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.650
Can you tell us some of the countries that
you sell it to?

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:41.070
Oh yes the soap is going everywhere now.

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.360
I'm sending to Moscow, to Japan.

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:52.250
I've got importers in Sweden and Denmark and
Germany and I've just sent a lot out to the

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:54.540
States and Canada there, so it's going everywhere

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:57.620
Did you ever expect it to be so popular?

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:02.479
No, no never and I even had a German man email
me.

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:07.229
He was delighted with his soap and he now
things that because I use whisky in the manafacture

00:02:07.229 --> 00:02:11.560
that he can drink his own bathwater.

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.000
I wouldn't recommend it, I wouldn't.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.980
Fantastic, that's great.

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:19.350
What other things do you make here?

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:21.500
Oh all sorts of things.

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:28.951
The soap was the catalyst for everything else
and I started this shop in 2007 and I make

00:02:28.951 --> 00:02:36.020
bath salts, body lotions, hand creams, bath
bombs - or as they're known on Islay "whisky

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:37.020
whizzers" -- and various gift packs.

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.000
So it's doing very well.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.280
You've got two children?

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:42.420
Two children.

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.840
Do they come and help you?

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:47.550
They help, yes.

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:48.820
A family industry.

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:51.550
Rowan is five, Rihanna's eight.

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:55.910
Rowan likes to come in and help me make the
bath bombs, but I'd left her one day with

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:01.890
the large bowl of dry ingredients and the
various liquids that you need to bind it and

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:08.650
nipped out for 2 minutes and it was like Vesuvius
had erupted because she'd poured the entire

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:10.730
jug in and it had gone all over the floor.

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:13.840
She thought it was fantastic... they "help",
yes!

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:19.930
I* must say, You can't smell it on this but
when you walk past Ailsa's shop you can smell

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:23.730
it before you can see it, it's very nice walking
down Main Street.

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:26.020
Even when your door's shut you can still smjell
it.

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:27.130
Is that so?

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:29.650
I'm immune now.

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:35.200
Well this is the vessel I use to make the
soap.

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:44.770
It's got a water jacket around it and inside
I put all the vegetable oils to melt and when

00:03:44.770 --> 00:03:51.010
they've melted I can switch the pot off and
add the caustic and that coordinates a thermic

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:57.340
reaction, it drives itself then and it takes
three hours to neutralise.

00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:01.730
I then add the sugar solution, the vegetable
glycerine and the whisky.

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:10.330
If I was making the full pot I can make about
800 bars at a time and that takes -- "everybody

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:16.160
asks how many bottles of whisky does it take?"
- but to make the 800 bars it takes on average

00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:22.270
three-and-a-half to four bottles of malt to
re-dissolve the soap solution.

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:29.599
By the time it's ready pour it actually looks
like hot whisky and I can just open the valve

00:04:29.599 --> 00:04:35.909
at the bottom and pour into the various moulds
and then I scent it in the moulds, leave it

00:04:35.909 --> 00:04:40.180
overnight, it sets, pop it out the mould in
the morning, leave it to dry for two weeks

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:42.770
before I can cut and wrap.

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:44.439
So that's the process.

00:04:44.439 --> 00:04:49.499
I'm always looking for new ideas to introduce
into the Visitor Centre, something different,

00:04:49.499 --> 00:04:52.520
and we've been looking at trying to incorporate
candles.

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:57.919
So I came to Ailsa and Ailsa's going to solve
all my problems with this, aren't you?

00:04:57.919 --> 00:05:02.050
She's going to turn her hand not only to soap
but to making some candles for us.

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:06.619
Vicky had a really good idea of the little
glasses which are engraved with the Laphroaig

00:05:06.619 --> 00:05:13.499
logo and so I should be making some candles
shortly in these little glasses and they'll

00:05:13.499 --> 00:05:16.289
look very, very smart I think, they're beautifully
shaped little glasses.

00:05:16.289 --> 00:05:21.279
What we're going to do is take the whiskey
tumblers that you can already buy for drinking

00:05:21.279 --> 00:05:28.070
your whisky in and put the wax in there so
you can burn them like a candle.

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:29.180
So watch this space...

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:34.610
That and possibly some whisky lip balm, Laphroaig
and honey lip balm.

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:35.610
Coming soon!

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:40.720
Well, thanks very much Ailsa for taking time
out to speak to us today.

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:43.740
I hope you haven't lost too many customers!

00:05:43.740 --> 00:05:45.000
No you're fine.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.839
Just give us a shout when the candles are
ready.

00:05:48.839 --> 00:05:52.469
Yes will do, thanks very much.

00:05:52.469 --> 00:06:01.449
Meeting with John Finlay here, he's a local
farmer from Port Ellen and the water source

00:06:01.449 --> 00:06:04.780
for Laphroaig runs down past your farm, John.

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:05.780
That's right.

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:09.719
Very special also because he is a longstanding
Friend Of Laphroaig and would you like to

00:06:09.719 --> 00:06:11.529
tell us what plot number you've got John?

00:06:11.529 --> 00:06:12.529
Number three.

00:06:12.529 --> 00:06:14.550
Number three, there you go.

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:16.710
One of the longest members.

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:19.729
How long have you been on Islay?

00:06:19.729 --> 00:06:21.029
All your life?

00:06:21.029 --> 00:06:30.449
No, 1964 we came to Islay and started farming
Kilbride, but I was in Fife before and New

00:06:30.449 --> 00:06:31.449
Zealand before that.

00:06:31.449 --> 00:06:33.409
Is your family settled on Islay as well?

00:06:33.409 --> 00:06:37.110
No John has, he's taken over the farm.

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:38.219
John's your son?

00:06:38.219 --> 00:06:39.219
Yes.

00:06:39.219 --> 00:06:45.699
I've got three daughters and they're scattered
about - one in Musselburgh and two in Glasgow

00:06:45.699 --> 00:06:47.569
Would they like coming back to Islay?

00:06:47.569 --> 00:06:51.789
Oh they do yes they all do yes of course they
do.

00:06:51.789 --> 00:06:54.489
Islay's a great place.
