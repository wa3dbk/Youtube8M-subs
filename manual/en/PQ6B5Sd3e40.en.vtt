00:00:07.534 --> 00:00:12.268
"Prayer: does it work?" is the next question.

00:00:13.738 --> 00:00:19.329
1st of all, we have to learn what prayer means.

00:00:23.223 --> 00:00:32.281
When we read a prayer, most of people, "God thank you for giving me 
 food, thank you for giving me house, thank you for giving me clothes"...

00:00:32.281 --> 00:00:39.000
"Thank you for everything you have given."  They consider it is a prayer.

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:47.933
I am not saying that saying 'thank you' is a wrong thing.  
 It is a good thing to say it, 'thank you'.  

00:00:47.933 --> 00:00:59.300
But, how do you know that there is such a power who 
 is creating food for you or creating everything for you?

00:01:00.910 --> 00:01:06.356
We never have seen it, because it is 
 not physical shape.  It is formless.

00:01:06.356 --> 00:01:10.189
When it is formless, it is hard to absorb this idea.

00:01:11.786 --> 00:01:22.972
So if there is a king sitting on the chair, and if you praise 
 to the king, king might be happy on you, will reward you.

00:01:22.972 --> 00:01:39.199
Because it has a body.  And I think, more or less I always think, that 
 this concept of God, to pray up to God, it comes from the king.

00:01:40.787 --> 00:01:49.890
Because king needs praise, king needs, if king gets angry, can 
 punish you.  King becomes happy, can reward you.

00:01:52.234 --> 00:02:05.830
But if God is almighty, God is omnipresent, if God is our father, suppose, according 
 to the majority of the world's people they think it is a father...

00:02:05.827 --> 00:02:13.080
How can a father punish his own child?  It is very difficult.

00:02:14.727 --> 00:02:21.170
And that father is not just a common father, 
 general father.  It is a special father.

00:02:22.366 --> 00:02:32.740
He's almighty.  I will tell you a simple father, even just a simple 
 father, if he sees that his baby is suffering from the pain...

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:44.990
He will whatever in his strength, in his opinion, 
 in his whatever he has, spend money.

00:02:46.393 --> 00:02:53.200
He will take him to the hospital if he needs operation or do everything.

00:02:53.204 --> 00:02:57.890
He will sell his own house, but he 
 cannot see the pain of a child.

00:02:59.041 --> 00:03:01.540
It is a simple father.  What about almighty father?

00:03:02.646 --> 00:03:06.370
He doesn't even have that much compassion?  People are suffering.

00:03:06.373 --> 00:03:14.310
And we are the children of that God?  That father?  
 He doesn't have any compassion to take us somewhere? 

00:03:15.619 --> 00:03:20.720
Or he can remove our pain right away. 
  But it doesn't seem to be.

00:03:23.047 --> 00:03:25.770
You already know that God is not almighty.

00:03:27.963 --> 00:03:30.940
If he's a father, he's not a very good father, then.

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:35.870
Because why he doesn't take our miseries away?  And he's almighty!

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:42.930
He can take it away.  The simple father cannot 
 take it.  Simple father just tries it.

00:03:44.201 --> 00:03:47.290
Almighty father can take it away.  He doesn't.

00:03:48.152 --> 00:03:50.810
Even you pray, still doesn't take it away.

00:03:50.811 --> 00:03:56.530
I have seen people - they pray and pray 
 and pray that, "Take my cancer away."

00:03:56.527 --> 00:04:06.920
It doesn't go away.  If it is already expanded 
 all over the body, now your blood, it cannot.

00:04:06.917 --> 00:04:09.550
There is no way prayer can take it.

00:04:11.127 --> 00:04:16.830
So I will tell you prayer doesn't work that way what people think.

00:04:18.304 --> 00:04:26.450
Yes, real prayer.  Because why it doesn't work?  Because 
 they are praising it.  They are not praying it.

00:04:27.022 --> 00:04:37.900
They are praising God.  "God, you are almighty, God you are omnipresent, God you 
 are everywhere.  God you are the best.  God you are this."

00:04:37.895 --> 00:04:43.700
Like praising king.  But God doesn't need that praising.

00:04:45.347 --> 00:04:52.350
God needs prayer.  And people fully misunderstand the prayer.

00:04:53.713 --> 00:05:03.530
Prayer is such a vague concept to understand, if people just 
 understand a prayer, this whole world will be changed.

00:05:05.659 --> 00:05:12.250
What is prayer?  Prayer is not praising to anyone, praising 
 a guru, or praising a king, or praising a god.

00:05:12.251 --> 00:05:27.350
That is not a prayer.  Prayer is when person sits 
 quietly, silently, and looks at himself or herself deeply. 

00:05:27.346 --> 00:05:37.310
And even in those moments, that person forgets everything, 
 even forgets his or her own body.

00:05:37.309 --> 00:05:43.050
His or her own thoughts.  His or her own mind.  

00:05:44.478 --> 00:05:53.330
When this you fully forget, you become present.  
 And when you are present, your prayer begins.

00:05:54.667 --> 00:05:58.660
If you are absent, your prayer never begins.

00:05:59.605 --> 00:06:04.040
So most of people when they are praying, they are absent.

00:06:04.587 --> 00:06:08.670
Even they are saying words.  They are just reading maybe.

00:06:10.616 --> 00:06:20.380
Their prayers are not more than thoughts.  And 
 where there are thoughts, you are absent.

00:06:20.385 --> 00:06:23.680
Where there is you are connected with your body, you are absent.

00:06:24.517 --> 00:06:28.060
If you are connected with your mind, you 
 are absent.  You are not present.

00:06:29.093 --> 00:06:34.020
Once you are present, it means your prayer begins.

00:06:35.949 --> 00:06:48.470
Just I will suggest you do prayer.  The real prayer is when 
 you are beyond from your body, beyond your thoughts, beyond your mind.

00:06:49.549 --> 00:06:59.970
And when you are beyond it means you are present, your soul 
 comes on the way.  Your soul itself is called prayer.

00:07:00.837 --> 00:07:07.870
It itself is prayer.  As soon as you are present, your 
 prayer begins.  That's what I will suggest to you.

00:07:08.601 --> 00:07:21.760
That prayer will work.  It worked in the past, it is working now, it will 
 work in the future.  It always works.  But it has to be prayer.
