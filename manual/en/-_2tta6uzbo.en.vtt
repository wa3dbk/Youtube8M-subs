Hi, this is Karen from Expert Village. Now
I'll show you how to make these rotten cupcakes.

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:11.860
This is what we'll need to make our rotten
cupcakes. You'll need some frosting. You can

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:18.020
use the ready made type if you want, and you
can use any color you want. We'll need some

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:24.830
chocolate cookies, some wafer cookies or chocolate
graham crackers are also good, some candy

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:34.060
worms, some assorted licorice and yucky looking
things and, of course, the cupcakes. Okay,

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:49.710
first we're going to ice our cupcakes. And
just put a quick coating of icing on that.

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:59.260
Next I'm going to crush up my chocolate cookies.
I'm going to place it into a plastic bag,

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:11.821
like this. And just use something hard, like
a can or rolling pin to crush it up and we

00:01:11.821 --> 00:01:22.400
want to crush it up so it looks like dirt.
Okay and then just pour your crumbs into a

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:36.480
bowl, like that and that looks like dirt.
Now you want to take your cupcake and just

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:40.409
dip it into the dirt. Woops we got a little
piece there that wasn't done. Dip it into

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:48.120
the dirt like that, and then you're going
to decorate with the worms. I like to stick

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:55.060
a worm right in, as if it's coming out of
a hole in the cupcake. Just push that worm

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:01.040
in there, like that, and then swirl them on
the cupcake.
