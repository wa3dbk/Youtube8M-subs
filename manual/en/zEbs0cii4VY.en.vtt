Hello.  My name is Katie Wardrobe and this is a MusicTechTips tutorial

00:00:11.778 --> 00:00:16.068
Musescore is a free notation program that offers a cost-effective alternative 

00:00:16.208 --> 00:00:20.220
to professional programs such as Sibelius and Finale. 

00:00:20.821 --> 00:00:28.821
This video is the first in a series that will walk you through 
 the basics of using Musescore to notate your compositions and arrangements. 

00:00:29.025 --> 00:00:32.447
You can download MuseScore from the website on the screen now

00:00:33.715 --> 00:00:36.962
Let's get started with the first tutorial: setting up your score

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.317
When you first launch Musescore you'll see the Create New Score window.

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:47.637
If it doesn't appear you can open it by going to File - New.

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:52.864
Enter the title of your composition...

00:00:54.521 --> 00:01:01.228
and other details and then choose here whether you want 
 to base your score on an existing template, 

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:04.898
or whether you'd like to create one from scratch. 

00:01:07.334 --> 00:01:12.039
We'll create a score from scratch today so choose that option and click Continue

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.624
In the next window, you can choose which instruments are 
 going to appear in your score.  

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.272
You can click on the arrows to the left of each 
 instrumental family to display the instruments for that group

00:01:26.987 --> 00:01:33.739
Today I’m going to create a 3 part round, so 
 I’ll choose Voice from the Vocals family.  

00:01:34.795 --> 00:01:40.600
You can click the Add button to add that instrument to 
 your score, or you can simply double-click on the name.

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.940
On the right-hand side, you can see the list 
 of staves I’ve created so far.  

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:51.800
Don’t worry too much about creating exactly what you need at this point

00:01:52.279 --> 00:01:57.080
you can always come back to this window 
 later on and add or subtract instruments.

00:01:57.618 --> 00:01:59.920
You can even change the order of staves in your score 

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:04.320
by selecting one of the instrument names in the list here 

00:02:04.558 --> 00:02:08.150
and use the up and down buttons to alter its position.

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.940
When you’re done click Continue and in the next window, select your key signature.

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:20.920
Finish off your score set-up by selecting your Time signature...

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:29.210
Pickup measure if you have one……and the total number of measures in your score

00:02:31.418 --> 00:02:34.420
remembering that these items can all be adjusted later on.

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:40.720
Once you're done, you’ll see your empty score, ready for you to enter notes.

00:02:42.191 --> 00:02:46.730
This is the first tutorial video in a series 
 titled Musescore in 10 Easy Steps. 

00:02:48.335 --> 00:03:01.600
