Hi everybody! It's me, the creator guy!

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:09.180
I just wanna say that Five Nights at Freddy's is probably THE most bizarre thing anyone could choose to turn into some anime gay fanfiction.

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:14.480
I mean, they're creepy robots that may or may not be possessed by children. That's not sexy at all.

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:23.720
And on top of that, you guys make porn of every goddamn object in the game! I wouldn't be surprised if I saw porn of the desk fan!

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:29.240
But I suppose most of you are just doing it as a bizarre way of conquering your fear of these games.

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:33.920
And I don't blame you. I find the games terrifying, too. Even just reading the lore surrounding the games gives me the jibblies.

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:38.480
But...try and keep your sex fantasies out of it, okay? Okay.

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.580
There's gonna be talking soon, so I gotta go now. Bye!

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:48.760
Good evening, Freddy.

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:49.700
Hi.

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.760
I am wearing my sexy anime skin tonight.

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:54.920
That's nice.

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.460
Do I not look sexy to you, Freddy?

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.080
Oh, I get it.

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:05.780
You are ignoring me.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.360
You are giving me the silent treatment.

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:10.580
The cold shoulder.

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.120
The shark dildo.

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:17.300
Is this because of last week?

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:19.593
When I showed you my talking dingus?

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.500
Please forgive me, Freddy.

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:28.000
I had a little too much to drink that night. I was not thinking clearly.

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:30.580
Can you forgive me, my love?

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.600
My sexy robot bear husband?

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.220
I know about your secret affair.

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:37.140
WHAT

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:42.200
I know that you've been sneaking out at night to see Foxy the Pirate.

00:01:42.973 --> 00:01:43.473
But..

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:44.240
But...

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:45.000
But, Freddy!

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:47.040
You have to understand!

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:47.540
THE CONCEPT OF LOVE

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:50.800
Those visits are strictly business-related!

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.560
There is nothing going on between us!

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:54.840
Oh, really?

00:01:55.383 --> 00:01:56.663
Then explain this!

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:58.300
Gasp!

00:01:58.406 --> 00:01:59.606
Where did you...?

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.020
I had some help from a special friend.

00:02:03.528 --> 00:02:04.808
This makes us even.

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.760
It's over, Vincent. I'm breaking up with you.

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:10.040
NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!

00:02:11.445 --> 00:02:11.945
But...

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.420
But, Freddy! I love you!

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.620
Well, now you can love Foxy.

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:20.000
Freddy, no!

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:21.460
Don't go!

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:23.700
Don't leave me, Freddy!

00:02:23.993 --> 00:02:25.193
Think of the kids!

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:27.380
Don't leave, daddy!

00:02:28.733 --> 00:02:30.333
They're coming with me.

00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:31.400
After all,

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.294
You aren't their real father.

00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:37.620
Freddy? Freddy, no!

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:38.580
Please!

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:39.680
Come back!

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:42.300
Come back, Freddy!

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:45.860
Freddy!

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:49.480
Freddy...

00:02:53.676 --> 00:02:54.396
Freddy...

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.100
Hey, purple face.

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:10.730
I can hook you up with some hot robot sluts for cheap.
