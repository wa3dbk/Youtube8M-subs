you know you need a Dermlite but with all the
models you're not sure which one to choose

00:00:14.029 --> 00:00:18.199
we're going to do a quick overview of
the most popular models and try and help

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:20.470
you you make the right choice

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:24.949
let's start with the original Dermlite
this revolutionary unit was designed for

00:00:24.949 --> 00:00:30.089
fluid free examinations using permanent 
cross polarization technology it's

00:00:30.089 --> 00:00:34.510
lightweight compact and will easily fit
in your pocket it's powered by

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:39.850
replaceable lithium batteries and has a
fifteen millimeter viewing area and a ten

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:43.219
times magnification it's also economical

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:45.690
being the least expensive of the
Dermlites

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.490
the next step in the Dermlite family is
the Dermlite Carbon

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:53.280
it's the same size as the original
Dermlite and also has a fifteen millimeter

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.610
viewing area with the ten times
magnification

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.280
and also uses replaceable batteries

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.010
the difference is that the Carbon ads a
second mode

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.470
and with the push of a button you can
switch from cross 

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:06.200
polarization viewing

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:11.670
to linear polarization giving you a clear
rendition of the skins surface

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:12.430
next

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:14.610
let's look at the Dermlite Twos

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:18.350
all of the 2 series Dermlites include a
slightly different shape

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:21.080
a larger viewing area of twenty five
millimeters

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:24.490
and a retractable contact plate with a
measuring grid

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:29.400
all of the Dermlite 2's are rechargeable

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:33.640
the Dermlite 2 HR is similar to
their original in that it has one

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.630
mode, permanent cross polarization

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.590
with the most available number of lights
and button press allows viewing from

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.140
sixteen or thirty-two l e d's

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.300
the Dermlite 2 Pro is the camera
adaptable version of the carbon

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:53.720
it also offers to modes of polarized
viewing cross polarization and linear

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:58.800
the Dermlite 2 fluid is designed to
use exclusively with immersion fluid yet

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:04.420
comes an a convenient an easily portable
size it's one mode is nonpolarized

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:08.829
the Dermlite 2 hybrid M offers two
modalities within one unit

00:02:08.829 --> 00:02:12.359
allowing you to choose between
traditional immersion fluid imaging

00:02:12.359 --> 00:02:14.729
or cross polarized dermoscopy

00:02:14.729 --> 00:02:19.120
like the hybrid they DL3 can be
used with immersion fluid in a 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:20.419
nonpolarized mode

00:02:20.419 --> 00:02:24.019
or with a quick tap switch to its
cross polarized mode

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:27.129
taking advantage of both methods within
one unit

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:30.889
it's the first hand-held Dermlite to
integrate a twenty five-millimeter, four

00:02:30.889 --> 00:02:32.080
element lands

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.540

nonpolarized modes and recharges from

00:02:58.119 --> 00:03:00.039

00:03:17.119 --> 00:03:20.179
