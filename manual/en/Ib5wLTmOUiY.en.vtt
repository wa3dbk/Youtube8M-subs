00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:04.000
Here, we're going to do a dot structure for
water, H2O.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.810
Let's write that down: H2O.

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:13.720
What we want to find out first is how many
valence electrons does water have.

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:15.660
I'm counting all the outer shell electrons.

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:18.860
I'll need my periodic table.

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:27.660
Let's see, Hydrogen's in group 1, so it has
one valence electron, but since there's two

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:31.690
Hydrogens I need to multiply that by 2.

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:37.540
Way over here, Oxygen has 6 valence electrons.

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:39.360
It's in group 6 or 16.

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.940
It has 6 outer shell electrons.

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:49.390
We add those there for a total of 6 plus 2
times 1: 8.

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:54.570
So we have eight total valence electrons to
satisfy the octets of all the H's and O's

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:55.910
with.

00:00:55.910 --> 00:01:02.670
We put the least electronegative one at the
center; however, we always put Hydrogen on

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.629
the outside.

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:05.729
I'm just going to draw it.

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.640
(I'm going to move it over here, give us some
room.)

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:17.249
H, O, H. Assign two electrons to each bond.

00:01:17.249 --> 00:01:21.649
So we're going to bond it together with a
covalent bond here.

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:25.930
So I've used 4 of my 8, so I have 4 left.

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:30.780
Then complete the octets on the outside atoms.

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.060
Here, because Oxygen needs 8.

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.590
Hydrogen needs two, but it already has two.

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:45.039
So I've completed the octets and I've used
up all my electrons here.

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:46.689
So I think we're OK there.

00:01:46.689 --> 00:01:53.039
Let's go ahead and check and see if we have
satisfied the outer shells, everything's full.

00:01:53.039 --> 00:01:59.789
Oxygen has 8, Hydrogen has 2, this Hydrogen
also has 2.

00:01:59.789 --> 00:02:04.509
You don't need to draw that on a test or a
quiz, but it is good to check.

00:02:04.509 --> 00:02:08.520
I've used 2, 4, 6, 8 electrons, that's all
I had.

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.500
Everything has an octet.

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:11.500
We're OK.

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:12.030
So we're done with water.
