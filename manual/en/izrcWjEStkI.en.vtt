Next up we are moving up to bronzer and I
know a lot of women of color say why would

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:12.969
I use a bronzer I'm already dark as it is.
What a bronzer works as a multipurpose cosmetic

00:00:12.969 --> 00:00:16.949
piece. First of all if you have any discoloration
of any of your skin tones is a little bit

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:23.990
lighter, a little bit darker it will even
it out. You can brush across the forehead

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:29.900
all around to the jaw. A lot of times the
face is a little bit darker then the neck

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:33.260
because this is where the sun hits and the
sun really don't get down in here as much.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:39.649
So you can take your bronzer and blend it
down to the neck. It works great as a contouring

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:44.260
but of course Katerina has gorgeous cheeks
bones so those are easy to find but if you

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:49.469
don't have such beautiful cheek bones you
can look half way from your eye underneath

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:56.449
and then blending up as you go. You can put
a little bit on the nose, a little bit on

00:00:56.449 --> 00:01:01.710
the forehead, a little bit on the cheek and
then on the neck just lightly around here

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:16.350
and there you have a beautiful bronze face
and it looks absolutely fabulous.

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.430
Next step we are going to move on to blush
the important thing about the blush it really

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:25.259
needs to match the lipstick. You don't want
to have a beautiful berry blush and then a

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:29.829
orange lipstick it just don't look right you
want it to be really well blend and you want

00:01:29.829 --> 00:01:35.770
it to look very natural. I have chosen a gorgeous
kind of burnish berry for Katerina. So you

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:40.219
just want to tap lightly I'm just tapping
off the excess and then right on the apple

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:46.369
of the cheek that will be mid way from the
eye and just straight across. You don't need

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:54.929
to over due the blush just a light soft circular
application is beautiful. Once you have the

00:01:54.929 --> 00:02:00.240
contouring and the blush it gives it a little
bit of a more 3 dimensional effect as oppose

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.439
of just having a straight blush you are looking
a little bit more natural as you do the contouring

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:07.229
and the blush together . Just one little extra
step.
