00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Hey guys. Kathryn requested a how-to video

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
on how to use Meltonian Shoe Cream

00:00:10.199 --> 00:00:13.300
how to know what is enough, how to match
colors

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.699
I have a pair of men's Clarks Privos

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.300
that are in so-so condition.

00:00:20.399 --> 00:00:23.699
They are pretty bare here ... and back here

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:28.300
So I'm going to use red mahogany

00:00:28.399 --> 00:00:31.699
which ends up being a pretty close match

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.700
It's not exact, but I think it's gonna be
close enough.

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.500
I have my Kiwi Honor Guard shine brush

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.100
that my husband has had for 25 years.

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.399
I have a chunk of fabric.

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:50.399
All I'm gonna do ... and no, I'm not wearing
gloves ...

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:51.500
I'm gonna regret that in 10 minutes.

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.200
I'm just gonna dip my finger in there.

00:00:54.299 --> 00:00:55.600
That's all I'm gonna start with.

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:59.399
And just rub it on

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:04.500
Try not to be too sloppy. I have white
top-stitching on these

00:01:04.599 --> 00:01:07.900
but I'm not real worried about that

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.799
I don't get particular about the
top-stitching

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000
It'll wipe off the soles real easily

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.200
so don't worry about it you get it on there

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Ok, I'm just gonna get a little bit more

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:30.900
That might even be a little bit too much

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.299
So I'm gonna put that up here cuz I can
spread it out a little better

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:54.799
This is real exciting, I know

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.200
Ok, the front's done

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:02.799
Let me get just a little bit more for the
back. You're not gonna need a lot.

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:05.200
Cuz there's not much back here to do

00:02:05.299 --> 00:02:07.400
There's a pretty bad spot here

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
The very back of these is suede

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.500
I'm gonna skip over that

00:02:17.599 --> 00:02:21.000
Go to the other side...

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000
Go back and wipe off. I got a little too much
back here

00:02:31.199 --> 00:02:33.300
So I'm just gonna wipe that off, rub it in a
little bit

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:45.300
And that's it. I'm gonna set that one aside
to dry

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:48.400
while I do the other one

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:58.400
[scrub, scrub, scrub]

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:05.800
I don't know how to pause the video

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.599
or I would do that instead of making you
watch me do this all over again

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:24.300
With this stuff, a little bit goes a long way

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000
It's a real thick cream. You don't need a lot

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:37.800
You should be able to get at least 10 pair of
shoes out of one of these jars

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:42.300
unless they're boots, obviously

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:56.199
Ok, that's about all the time that the first
one needs to dry

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:59.599
I'm gonna get my brush

00:03:59.699 --> 00:04:02.500
and just use real quick strokes

00:04:11.599 --> 00:04:15.599
All that's gonna do is shine it up a bit

00:04:15.699 --> 00:04:18.600
I should have left that other one not done,
so you could see a before and after

00:04:18.699 --> 00:04:21.199
Too late now.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000
When you do this, this is probably what's
gonna wipe of any that you got on the soles

00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:32.600
I had some here

00:04:32.699 --> 00:04:34.500
and that wiped it off

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:44.500
This color wasn't a perfect match, or we
wouldn't have this

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:45.600
This would even be filled in

00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:47.199
But I still think that looks better than it
did

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:49.500
So I'm not gonna worry about it

00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:00.300
That is it!

00:05:00.399 --> 00:05:02.199
There's your finished shoe.
