00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.380
A very common method to cool the
components inside of our

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:08.740
computers is something
called a heat sink.

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:13.290
This is a copper or aluminum
piece that is put on top of a

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:14.580
very hot component.

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:18.100
Usually these are the very hot
chips that are right on our

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:19.050
motherboards.

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.630
And as they heat up, all of the
heat is pulled up through

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:23.720
this heat sink.

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:26.470
And because we have all these
little holes that are being

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:30.040
pulled here as the air blows
through it, it is also cooling

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:31.170
the top of the heap sink.

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:34.140
So we're able to dissipate that
heat and get rid of it

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.360
outside of our computing case.

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.930
You can see that the surface
area is very large.

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:42.360
We take it from that very flat
area and extend it up through

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.340
these little fins, and let
that air flow through.

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:49.070
One important piece of this is
that underneath this heat sink

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:53.040
where it is connecting to that
very, very hot chip, we put a

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:56.010
thermal grease that is designed
to keep a good

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.660
connection between the heat sink
and the processor itself.

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:03.150
If that particular connection
is not very good, then the

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:05.050
heat is not going to
dissipate well.

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:08.200
And that thermal grease is
designed to keep a very good

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.490
connection between the heat sink
and the component itself.

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.010
One important safety tip is
if you're doing a lot of

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.560
processing on your computer,
these components are

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:17.550
getting very hot.

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:21.050
And because the heat sink is
dissipating that heat, it also

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:21.890
gets very hot.

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.540
So if you're working inside of
a computer that you've just

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.250
turned off, be careful, because
these heat sinks can

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:30.150
get very, very warm
to the touch.

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:32.600
In your computer, there's
probably more than one heat

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:33.620
sink that you have.

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:36.790
You can see a heat sink that
might be on a main processor.

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:39.680
There's other heat sinks that
might be on a north bridge,

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:41.200
and other components
themselves may

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:42.190
have other heat sinks.

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:44.660
These look kind of interesting
in that they have these little

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:47.060
fins come up, and they almost
look like flames coming up

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:49.610
through there for a little bit
of a design right there on

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:50.340
your motherboard.

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.390
But they're all performing
the same function.

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:55.090
They're taking the heat off of
these components that are on

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.030
the motherboard itself, and
pulling that heat right off so

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:01.170
that the air can cool
it as it goes by.

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:04.460
It's also not uncommon to put
heat sinks right on top of

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.840
your processors, and on top of
the heat sinks, you might even

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:10.880
have fans that are pulling that
air right off of the heat

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.730
sink itself and sending
it out of the case.

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:16.740
So you may have fans on the
case that are connected

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:20.070
physically to the heat sinks
themselves to add that much

00:02:20.070 --> 00:02:23.370
more cooling capability
to those components.

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:26.290
Sometimes you'll see an adapter
card that has on it

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:29.100
its own set of fans, especially
if it's something

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:30.510
like a video card.

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:33.380
These can be kind of bulky
because you not only have the

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:36.740
adapter card itself, but you've
now put a fan inside of

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:40.200
it to make sure that it gets
its own cooling as well.

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.630
It's almost always seen on these
high end graphics cards,

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:46.450
or other types of cards that are
performing very, very high

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:48.930
end processes, because those
components tend to

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.150
get very, very hot.

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:53.780
If you don't know how the air
flows through your particular

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:56.270
computer, you should take a look
at it and see, even if

00:02:56.270 --> 00:03:00.230
it's a laptop or a desktop,
there on that device is a fan

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:03.740
somewhere that's pulling air in,
and it should be exiting

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:05.820
out another part of the case.

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:08.640
You'll probably want to look
in a desktop computer

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:12.070
especially, because the layout
of the motherboard becomes

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:15.370
very important, especially the
cables that you use to connect

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:17.970
hard drives, cables that you're
using to connect back

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:21.980
to the case itself all have an
effect of the air flow through

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:22.550
the device.

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:25.630
So you want to be sure that all
of the fans are able to

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:28.590
pull air through as efficiently
as possible, and

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:32.360
that none of those wires or
cables are getting in the way.

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:35.090
There's a lot of different
styles of fans, and a lot of

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:37.530
different volume levels
of fans that you can

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:38.480
have in your case.

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:39.700
You may not just have one.

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:41.740
You may have multiple fans,
and they may be different

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:44.840
sizes, but they all work
together to make sure that

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:47.940
you're able to take the cool air
from the outside and blow

00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:51.550
it through the inside of the
computer to cool it off.

00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:53.980
Here's an example of a server
appliance that is

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:55.300
using that same idea.

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:58.300
There are fans that are pulling
from the cool side and

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:01.650
pulling that on top of and
through the motherboard, and

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:04.270
the air is exiting out these
holes in the back.

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:06.630
And that's an important
consideration, is you want to

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:09.150
be sure that those holes
are always clear.

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:10.800
You want to be sure
there's no dust.

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:13.470
You want to be sure that the air
is able to come into the

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:16.400
computer and exit out as
quickly as possible.

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:18.899
If these start to get plugged,
you'll find that the

00:04:18.899 --> 00:04:21.120
temperature inside of
your computer will

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:23.940
rise very, very rapidly.

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:26.450
If you're adding a fan or
replacing a fan and a

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:29.140
motherboard, you'll find there
are very standard sizes,

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:32.570
usually something like an 80
millimeter or 120 millimeter,

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:35.790
or different types, depending
on the case that you have.

00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:38.140
These fans can also run
at different speeds.

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:40.720
Often you can plug the fan into
an interface, and the

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:43.890
motherboard sensors will
determine how fast that fan

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:47.200
needs to run based on how hot
the inside of the computer

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:48.740
case happens to be.

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:50.120
There are also different
noise levels.

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:52.820
So if you don't like the fan
that's inside of your desktop

00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:56.960
computer now, you can probably
find one that is much quieter

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:00.480
at exactly the same size, that
probably moves the same amount

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:02.970
of air, and replace it,
and immediately

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:05.750
have a quieter computer.

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:08.690
But we don't always have to
use air for our computing.

00:05:08.690 --> 00:05:09.800
We could use liquid.

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:13.130
And these days, the liquid
is a coolant that we are

00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:13.900
circulating.

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:16.800
In this case, you can see
circulating from a connection

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:20.310
that's right on top of a
processor, and it's moving

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:21.410
into a fan.

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:24.990
It's radiating out that heat as
the air passes through, and

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:28.930
then the liquid goes back onto
that particular area to get

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:31.160
heated up again, and the
process repeats.

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:33.650
It's the same process we
use for automobiles.

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:35.710
It's the same process
we use for our

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:37.540
large mainframe computers.

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:40.140
We've taken that liquid cooling
and collapsed it into

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:42.600
a size that's small enough
to put inside

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:43.940
of our desktop computers.

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:46.480
You usually see this on
high end systems.

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:49.180
If you're doing a lot of gaming
or a set of processes

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:52.350
that really increases the amount
of work the CPU does,

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:55.450
maybe you need some additional
cooling that the air cooling

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:58.140
is just not going to be
able to do for you.

00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:00.800
And if you're experimenting with
your computer and you're

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:04.150
overclocking the CPU itself, you
know that that processor

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:05.550
is going to get warm.

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:09.020
That may be a perfect example
to, instead of using air

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:11.940
cooling, use some type of
liquid cooling for your

00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:13.190
processors.
