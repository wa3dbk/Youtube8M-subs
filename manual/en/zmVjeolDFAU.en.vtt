00:00:00.010 --> 00:00:02.950
Hey, what's up GG (guys and girls)? CouilleBleu's back today to play...

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:12.900
Here are the runes, masteries, skill distribution and items that you'll need to piss on everyone doggy style.

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:17.000
In the laning phase, you only have a single simple mission to accomplish :

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:23.900
last hit the minions with your Dance Pole Slap skill all day long to make you stronger even when you're busy poking the tower to oblivion.

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.900
If that skill is on cooldown, using your Dynamic Marking to wreck these weaklings is more than welcome.

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:36.100
After farming a bit, you'll notice that your Dance Pole Slap will deal tons of damage even without having a Trinity Phreak.

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:43.150
And that is why you should fight every fuckabish head on if they disturb your Epic Farm Time by buttfucking him in the brush with your minions.

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:51.600
If you get ganked by Chinese Spear, do not use Ghost or Flash to run away because you'll be able to get an effortless First Blood thanks to these greedy fatherfuckers.

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:59.150
If you're the one towerdiving with your ButtFucking Friend, make sure to become a Silver Dog to tank the turret and smack your enemy like a boss.

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:06.950
Late game, you'll be able to kill this rager before he has the chance to become a man and to wreck your enemy's base without giving a shit about Fizz's woman.

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:16.500
Thanks to your AP build, you will finally be able to pickpocket tons of minions faster than ever instead of poking them one by one like a dumb dog.

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:24.200
And, of course, you'll be able to (DOGGY STYLE OP) and to kill any running bastard with your Dynamic Marking.

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:31.700
Also, that skill is extremely useful to see who's hiding behind a tree or to piss off your enemies by not letting them go back home in peace.

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:40.500
Your AP build also benefits your Silver Dog skill because everyone around you will burn to death and that is why you can simply run over anyone like Bob the Builder.

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:47.300
Even if your an AP dog, you shouldn't neglect to farm your Dance Pole Slap at all stage of the game by last hitting the minions with your Q.

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:53.500
And guess what? This skill works on any kind of enemy, including the mini-ghost from Yorick Spamming Master!

00:01:55.120 --> 00:02:00.070
Oh, and by the way, large monsters and minions double the amount of damage that skill receives,

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:04.950
so use it on them whenever you have the chance if you want to become the toughest dog of history.

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:13.000
Be aware that enemy champions also double that amount, so consider them as some big-ass minions that must be killed at all cost...with your Dance Pole Slap.

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:19.750
And now, whenever you're raiding your enemy's base, everyone will always see that doggy OP icon if you use that skill.

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:27.800
In teamfights, you can come from the back to make your enemies shit in their pants and kill those in front of you with a Slow-Dynamic Marking-Dance Pole Slap combo.

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:36.050
If you accidently transformed yourself into a Silver Dog, don't sweat it and use Teleport to show that Flying Pikachu who's the true AP master of the game.

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:45.800
Thanks to your Lich Bane, your Dance Pole Slap will deal so much damage that you will be able to get every single kill in a teamfight, making your teammates think that you're a dogly god.

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:54.200
To avenge your call girl's death, you should Dance Pole Slap her killer, transform into Silver Dog mode and chase him with Ghost to not let him get away to safety.

00:02:54.210 --> 00:02:58.900
Then, Auto-Attack poison boy to slow him with your newly gained red buff from Udyr,

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:05.150
Dynamic Marking-Dance Pole Slap that running fuckabish, Slow him and finish him off with another Dance Pole Slap in his ass.

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:09.900
Sometimes, it is better to not group with your team to fight the enemies and let your allies die.

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:19.800
It's simply because you can go straight into the enemy's base to win the game before any member from the opposing team shows up.

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:23.100
That way, your team's sacrifice is not in vain, right HotShot?

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:28.000
That's it for today, people!

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:32.500
Don't forget to check out my channel for more boring League of Legends videos.

00:03:32.510 --> 00:03:40.300
Feel free to leave a comment in any language you want, but I'll only answer those in English and in French because I'm a racist fuckabish.

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:42.000
Ciaossu!
