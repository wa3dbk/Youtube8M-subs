00:00:06.443 --> 00:00:09.573
I need to know how to fix Xbox One sign in
problems.

00:00:09.573 --> 00:00:15.182
I’m assuming you are not trying to log into
someone else’s PS4 again.

00:00:15.182 --> 00:00:19.132
No, it is an Xbox One, and it is mine.

00:00:19.132 --> 00:00:23.923
My first step would be verifying if the Xbox
One server is down.

00:00:23.923 --> 00:00:28.643
There are a number of websites that track
whether Xbox live is down.

00:00:28.643 --> 00:00:34.003
I do not think that’s the problem – I
can see it live online via a web search.

00:00:34.003 --> 00:00:38.333
Then you should do a hard reset, also known
as a power cycle.

00:00:38.333 --> 00:00:43.454
Hold down the power button for ten seconds
to turn it off, wait a minute literally, then

00:00:43.454 --> 00:00:45.563
push the button again.

00:00:45.563 --> 00:00:50.843
If in doubt, reboot, has been standard Microsoft
tech support for years.

00:00:50.843 --> 00:00:56.193
If you do not want to use the button, go to
settings, system, restart.

00:00:56.193 --> 00:00:59.513
One path or the other, it is still the same
solution.

00:00:59.513 --> 00:01:01.933
But why restart it?

00:01:01.933 --> 00:01:06.533
Most of your account information is saved,
but the system cache gets cleared out and

00:01:06.533 --> 00:01:09.713
a number of settings revert back to defaults.

00:01:09.713 --> 00:01:14.783
If the sign-in problem is the gaming console
equivalent to a bad session cookie, restarting

00:01:14.783 --> 00:01:16.683
the box solves it.

00:01:16.683 --> 00:01:18.783
What if I need to fix this on the web?

00:01:18.783 --> 00:01:21.723
I’ve seen that error while trying to log
in.

00:01:21.723 --> 00:01:27.533
That may mean the problem is on the Microsoft
side, but because they locked your account.

00:01:27.533 --> 00:01:30.873
Or I might have, fat fingering a password.

00:01:30.873 --> 00:01:35.743
More likely because they think someone is
trying to sign into the account as an unauthorized

00:01:35.743 --> 00:01:37.283
third party.

00:01:37.283 --> 00:01:39.882
Is that fancy terminology for a hack attack?

00:01:39.882 --> 00:01:45.683
I’d log in and tell Microsoft I’m me,
but I cannot log in to tell them that.

00:01:45.683 --> 00:01:48.253
Go to account.live.com and log in.

00:01:48.253 --> 00:01:54.273
Microsoft will send a security code to your
phone or previously provided email address.

00:01:54.273 --> 00:01:58.643
And then I go through a password reset, like
any other site I might have locked myself

00:01:58.643 --> 00:01:59.643
out of.

00:01:59.643 --> 00:02:04.733
They’ll ask for verification via the standard
security questions, and then you need to change

00:02:04.733 --> 00:02:06.062
your password.

00:02:06.062 --> 00:02:11.783
And not one of the worst passwords ever like
let me in, or trust no one with the number

00:02:11.783 --> 00:02:16.313
1, which are about as bad as 123456.

00:02:16.313 --> 00:02:18.503
What if that does not fix it?

00:02:18.503 --> 00:02:23.503
If you have two step verification turned on,
create an app password and then sign in to

00:02:23.503 --> 00:02:25.303
the console.

00:02:25.303 --> 00:02:29.932
Then you can turn off two step authentication
so it does not lock you out again or go to

00:02:29.932 --> 00:02:36.363
security and privacy, change password, app
passwords and create a new app password.

00:02:36.363 --> 00:02:37.833
Of course there’s an app for that.
