Hi guys, welcome to a short presentation of SqueezePad for your iPad

00:00:08.579 --> 00:00:14.219
So here we are on the mainscreen, on the left
you can see the menu and on the right the current playing song

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:17.240
with a big image of your coverart

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:19.480
let's change the players first

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:22.289
as you can see we have icons for all player types

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:24.659
so you should easily spot the right one

00:00:24.659 --> 00:00:27.779
let's choose the Living room

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:31.259
the menus are the same as you know them from your SqueezeBox

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:36.700
No need to learn other paths, you will find your way around instantly

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:39.340
lets just go to my music and albums

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:41.640
here you can scroll

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.330
or just use the index for faster browsing

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:51.710
you can move to the previous menu by swiping

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:53.470
or hitting the button

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:59.180
and you can also use one of the buttons
on the bottom for fast access to most used menus

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:09.670
you can start an album by clicking on the cover art

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:13.680
or you can drill down too

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.670
if you do a long touch on a menu item

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:20.420
a context menu will appear

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:22.869
and they are the options to put a song into 

00:01:22.869 --> 00:01:25.110
the playlist and also stuff from

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:27.550
third party libraries like

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:28.720
Album Review 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:31.750
or Biography

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:35.140
on the right you can change the volume

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:41.250
or jump to different parts of the song

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.689
if you touch the cover art

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:45.409
you will switch into screensafer mode

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:47.170
which works in landscape and portrait

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:48.720
and is perfect for parties

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:51.610
where you want to see what playing from the distance

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:58.610
the current song has a context-menu as well

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:05.369
On the main menu you can also choose your Apps
of course all types of services are available: Napster, Pandora, Spotify, Last.FM

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:09.609
and Deezer

00:02:09.609 --> 00:02:11.229
here we go into Deezer

00:02:11.229 --> 00:02:15.939
so you can see that SqueezePad is really integrated into your whole system

00:02:15.939 --> 00:02:18.109
I hope you liked the small presentation
