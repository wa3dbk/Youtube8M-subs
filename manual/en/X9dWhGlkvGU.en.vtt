00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.600
"Which Fruit Fights Cancer Better?"

00:00:06.603 --> 00:00:11.220
There are many ways to compare 
the healthfulness of different foods.

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:14.668
One can compare nutrient 
content, for example.

00:00:14.668 --> 00:00:19.242
So if you're interested in antioxidants 
you might compare vitamin C levels.

00:00:19.242 --> 00:00:22.526
If you did that for our two most 
popular fruits, apples and bananas,

00:00:22.526 --> 00:00:27.000
based on vitamin C content bananas
would appear twice as healthy,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.499
10 mg in a banana compared 
to only 5mg in an apple.

00:00:30.499 --> 00:00:35.465
But vitamin C is just one of thousands of different 
phytonutrients in fruits and vegetables.

00:00:35.465 --> 00:00:41.667
Turns out the vitamin C in apples accounts for less 
 than 1% of an apple's total antioxidant activity.

00:00:41.667 --> 00:00:47.168
Here's the total antioxidant 
content of a red delicious apple.

00:00:47.168 --> 00:00:50.100
Here's how much the vitamin C 
in the apple contributes.

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.137
You can hardly even see it.

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:57.240
Even though there's only 5 mg
 of vitamin C in a small apple,

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:02.220
it has the antioxidant equivalent 
of 1500 mg of vitamin C.

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:06.980
I've reviewed before how taking that 
much vitamin C straight in a supplement

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:11.136
might actually have a pro-oxidant
 effect and cause DNA damage,

00:01:11.136 --> 00:01:19.170
but you can get three times the antioxidant power 
eating a single apple, without the adverse effects.

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.180
Of course, there's more than 
just vitamin C in bananas too.

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:24.720
In fact, I was surprised to 
see this study out of Harvard

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:28.874
suggesting that not only
 blueberries and strawberries,

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.720
but bananas were a significant 
sources of anthocyanins,

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:36.455
the red/blue/violet
 phytonutrients found in berries.

00:01:36.455 --> 00:01:41.380
Maybe I underestimated bananas. 
They are after all, technically berries.

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:49.380
Still, I'm looking at these three fruits and 
I see some anthocyanins here and here,

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.980
but not seeing much 
red, blue, or violet here.

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:58.380
Now wild bananas 
are a different story.

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:12.100
There's anthocyanins in blue, purple, orange red, red purple, and pink purple bananas, but NONE in yellow.

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:15.380
So the Harvard researchers were
 challenged on it and they said,

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:23.640
look, we just took values from the USDA, and it 
 turns out USDA apparently made a mistake.

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.740
No anthocyanins in bananas, 
and despite twice the vitamin C,

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:32.720
bananas were beat out by apples 
in terms of overall antioxidant power.

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:38.220
But that's just measuring the ability of these fruits 
to quench an oxidation reaction in a test tube.

00:02:38.223 --> 00:02:41.900
It'd be nice to measure 
actual biological activity.

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:46.900
For example in this apple study, they also
 measured the ability of apple extracts,

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.740
from both peeled 
and unpeeled apples,

00:02:50.754 --> 00:02:57.050
to suppress the growth of human cancer cells 
growing in a petri dish compared to control.

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:59.840
Wouldn't it be great to be able 
to compare that kind of superpower

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:04.180
between different fruits?
Well, now we can.

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:08.220
Here's a graph of cancer cell proliferation
versus increasing concentrations

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:13.080
of the 11 most common fruits 
eaten in the United States.

00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:16.760
They decided to use human 
liver cancer for this study.

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:21.680
If you drip water on these cancer cells 
as a control, nothing happens.

00:03:21.692 --> 00:03:27.720
They start out powering away at 100% growth 
and they keep powering away at 100% growth.

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:33.990
And pineapples, pears, and 
oranges don't do much better.

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:36.892
Peaches start pulling 
away from the pack.

00:03:36.892 --> 00:03:42.060
At high peach concentrations, cancer 
cell proliferation drops about 10%,

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:47.900
but bananas and grapefruits 
work about 4 times better,

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:51.480
dropping cancer growth 
rates by about 40%.

00:03:51.481 --> 00:03:55.984
Red grapes, strawberries, 
and apples do even better,

00:03:55.984 --> 00:04:01.180
cutting cancer cell growth up 
to half at only half the dose,

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:07.540
but these two fruits are the winners, 
causing a dramatic drop

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:15.600
in  cancer proliferation at just
 tiny doses, lemons and cranberries.

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:21.560
So if you look at the effective dose required 
to suppress liver cancer cell proliferation,

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:26.240
apples are more powerful than bananas, 
but cranberries win the day.

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:29.440
And there was no effective dose listed
 for orange, pear, or pineapple,

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:33.900
since they didn't appear to affect 
the cancer cell growth at all.
