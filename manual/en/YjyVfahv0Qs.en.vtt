J Cole Dreams I will try to kill this one
I will try to kill this one

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:26.220
Beginning I don't know what he says
follow me, something something

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:31.690
shits crazy that shit is crazy
Seems like I always had crushes on chicks

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:35.230
I couldn't have
And then I end up fucking with someone I shouldn't

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:37.390
have
See, in my mind, it's like I'm perfect for

00:00:37.390 --> 00:00:41.770
her, I gotta show her
But sadly, in reality, dog, I don't even know

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:44.270
her
But still somehow she got my mind infatuated

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:46.710
Absolutely fascinated with the thoughts of
what she might be like

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:49.600
Time after time after time I had to wait,
is-

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:50.600
Is fate procrastinating?

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.989
I can take it 'cause I might be right, 'cause
it's

00:00:53.989 --> 00:00:57.559
This is the girl of my dreams, yeah
Ay, is she good as what she seems?

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:01.670
Uh, or am I lying to myself?

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:03.810
Uh, ay should I try and get some help?

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:08.620
Yeah, this is the girl of my dreams
Is she good as what she seems?

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:11.260
Or am I lying to myself?

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.479
Ay, should I try and get some help?

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:17.990
Yeah, yeah
Oh shit, she passed me on the boulevard

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:22.259
Ay, tell me is it stalking if I follow her
Like all the way home without her knowing

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:24.409
Nah, nigga, I'm just curious where she stay
at

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:28.080
Besides when I'm with her, this gon' be the
spot we lay at

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.070
And maybe I'll just drive by occassionally
And if one day I happen to see her outside,

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.829
she wave to me,
Imagine what she'll say to me

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:36.729
This ain't no time to be afraid no more
It's time for bravery

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:38.479
No matter if my homies think I'm crazy

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:42.929
This the girl of my dreams
Hey, ay is she good as what she seems?

00:01:42.929 --> 00:01:46.590
Uh, or am I lying to myself?

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.740
Uh, ay should I try and get some help?

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:54.440
Yeah, this is the girl of my dreams
Ay, is she good as what she seems?

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.370

00:01:57.370 --> 00:02:01.280
Ay, should I try and get some help?

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.899
Yeah, yeah, look
I spot her walking in the mall, okay, it's

00:02:04.899 --> 00:02:08.060
time to grow some balls
If she really gon' be yours, oh my god, I'm

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.170
walking towards her
My mind screaming stop, but my legs keep walking

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.650
forward
Straighten up your face, nigga, she see you

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.260
coming for her
My heartbeat racing, and my hands keep shaking

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.209
Say something, you shy motherfucker, she's
waiting,

00:02:20.209 --> 00:02:24.680
"Wassup girl, don't mean to interrupt
But in the city I done met a lot of women

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:30.260
But you from my dreams, ay will you come true?

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:37.170
I know about a show that we can catch,
Some R&amp;B and rap, ay you should come thru"

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.599
She said, "uh, I love too, except I don't
like rap

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:46.150
Besides, if I went with you, then I don't
really think my man would like that"

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:47.150
Damn!

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.540
Man,
Okay, you say you got a man,

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:52.830
I mean, I definitely understand, I'm happy
for you, really am,

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:57.010
I couldn't have been the only fan in the world
Of a girl like you

00:02:57.010 --> 00:02:59.090
I mean, you're beautiful, and I'm sure he's
a very nice dude

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:02.220
It ain't no biggie, well I'm sure that I'm
gon' see you around the city

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:05.080
Only thing I ask if shit don't work out for
y'all, don't forget me

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:08.049
And don't act like a stranger when you see
me on the scene

00:03:08.049 --> 00:03:10.299
I came up with a world-class scheme to get

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:14.170
The girl of my dreams
Uh, ay is she good as what she seems?

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:16.450
Uh, or am I lying to myself?

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:19.060
Or should I try and get some help?

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:26.580

Ay is she good as what she seems?

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:29.920

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:36.420
Yeah, yeah
So I find out the nigga name, know exactly

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:39.700

Find out when he leave for work, hold up nigga,

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:40.700

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:42.950
I'm a follow in my car; I'm a cut in front
of his

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:44.909
Run him right into the wall, maybe even off
the bridge

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:48.659
I give her a little time, then console her
while she crying

00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:51.450
She gon' take that as a sign; finally she
will be mine

00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:54.400
I'll be king, and she'll be queen when I hit
her with ring

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:55.629
At the wedding, who gon' sing?

00:03:55.629 --> 00:04:00.170
This the girl of my dreams
Is she good as what she seems?

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:03.829
Or am I lying to myself?

00:04:03.829 --> 00:04:05.900

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:14.079
Or am I lying to myself?

00:04:14.079 --> 00:04:18.630
Think I should I try and get some help?

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:22.109
