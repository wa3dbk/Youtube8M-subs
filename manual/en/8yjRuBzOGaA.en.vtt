00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:05.100
The President:
Well, it is a great pleasure
to welcome four leaders from

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:10.266
Africa, all of whom are
doing extraordinary work --

00:00:10.266 --> 00:00:16.700
President Sall from Senegal,
President Banda from Malawi,

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:20.633
President Koroma
from Sierra Leone,

00:00:20.633 --> 00:00:25.200
and Prime Minister
Neves from Cape Verde.

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:31.033
The reason that I'm meeting with
these four is they exemplify the

00:00:31.033 --> 00:00:33.867
progress that we're
seeing in Africa.

00:00:33.867 --> 00:00:35.967
All of them have had
to deal with some

00:00:35.967 --> 00:00:39.200
extraordinary challenges.

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:43.400
Sierra Leone just 10 years ago
was in the midst of as brutal a

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:46.133
civil war as we've ever seen.

00:00:46.133 --> 00:00:50.133
And yet, now we've seen
consecutive fair and

00:00:50.133 --> 00:00:51.133
free elections.

00:00:51.133 --> 00:00:54.567
And under President
Koroma's leadership,

00:00:54.567 --> 00:00:56.467
we've seen not only
good governance,

00:00:56.467 --> 00:01:00.133
but also significant
economic growth.

00:01:00.133 --> 00:01:04.667
When you talk about Malawi,
there was a constitutional

00:01:04.667 --> 00:01:07.333
crisis just last year.

00:01:07.333 --> 00:01:14.567
And yet, President Banda has not
only been able to be in office

00:01:14.567 --> 00:01:18.066
and make sure that
constitutional order was

00:01:18.066 --> 00:01:22.100
restored, but has also made
significant progress on behalf

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:23.633
of her people.

00:01:23.633 --> 00:01:30.700
And her personal story of
overcoming a history of abuse

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:36.533
and leading women throughout her
country I think indicates the

00:01:36.533 --> 00:01:38.533
kind of progress that can
be made when you've got

00:01:38.533 --> 00:01:40.066
strong leadership.

00:01:40.066 --> 00:01:45.600
The same is true for His
Excellency President Sall.

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.900
There were some bumps in the
road in terms of transition from

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:54.900
the previous President, and yet,
the Senegalese rose up at the

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:58.166
grassroots level and
sustained their democracy.

00:01:58.166 --> 00:02:01.700
And Cape Verde is a
real success story.

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.333
We were hearing from Prime
Minister Neves about the fact

00:02:04.333 --> 00:02:08.433
that just in a few decades they
have moved from a per capita

00:02:08.433 --> 00:02:14.600
income of maybe $200 a
year to now $4,000 a year,

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:18.000
and are now moving into the
middle of the pack in terms of

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.200
development levels because of
good governance and management.

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:26.100
So what our discussion has
focused on is, number one,

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:29.433
how do we continue to build
on strong democracies;

00:02:29.433 --> 00:02:33.767
how do we continue to build on
transparency and accountability.

00:02:33.767 --> 00:02:37.834
Because what we've learned over
the last several decades is that

00:02:37.834 --> 00:02:40.433
when you've got
good governance --

00:02:40.433 --> 00:02:41.934
when you have
democracies that work,

00:02:41.934 --> 00:02:44.600
sound management
of public funds,

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.600
transparency and accountability
to the citizens that put leaders

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:51.600
in place -- it turns out that
that is not only good for the

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.367
state and the functioning
of government,

00:02:54.367 --> 00:02:56.767
it's also good for economic
development because it gives

00:02:56.767 --> 00:02:59.133
people confidence, it
attracts business,

00:02:59.133 --> 00:03:01.033
it facilitates
trade and commerce.

00:03:01.033 --> 00:03:06.066
And all of these leaders have
good stories to tell on that.

00:03:06.066 --> 00:03:08.633
They recognize that there's
still more work to be done,

00:03:08.633 --> 00:03:13.266
and so I'm very pleased that
all of them are looking to move

00:03:13.266 --> 00:03:17.433
forward on the Open Government
Partnership that we helped to

00:03:17.433 --> 00:03:20.800
organize through the United
Nations several years ago,

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:24.567
and that we are now seeing
countries from all across the

00:03:24.567 --> 00:03:27.800
world sign up for -- setting
up international norms for

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:30.700
accountability and
transparency that can lead to

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:32.266
good governance.

00:03:32.266 --> 00:03:34.867
We also talked about
the economic situation.

00:03:34.867 --> 00:03:39.500
And all of us recognize that,
although Africa has actually

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:44.000
been growing faster than almost
every other region of the world,

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.300
it started from a low baseline
and it still has a lot of

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:47.300
work to do.

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:51.400
And that means building human
capacity and improving education

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:56.166
and job skills for rapidly
growing and young populations.

00:03:56.166 --> 00:03:58.934
It means improving
access to energy and

00:03:58.934 --> 00:04:01.066
transportation sectors.

00:04:01.066 --> 00:04:04.333
And so we discussed how the
United States can continue to

00:04:04.333 --> 00:04:07.633
partner effectively with
each of these countries.

00:04:07.633 --> 00:04:10.400
And then we finally talked about
young people generally and how

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:14.400
we can mobilize the next
generation of Africa leaders.

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:20.333
And individuals like President
Koroma have taken great interest

00:04:20.333 --> 00:04:25.867
in finding additional ways that
we can recruit and engage young

00:04:25.867 --> 00:04:30.700
people not only to get involved
in public service but also to

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:32.700
get involved in entrepreneurship
that helps build

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:33.967
these countries.

00:04:33.967 --> 00:04:38.033
And so my main message to each
of these leaders is that the

00:04:38.033 --> 00:04:40.900
United States is going
to be a strong partner,

00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:44.600
not based on the old model in
which we are a donor and they

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:47.600
are simply a recipient, but
a new model that's based on

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:51.100
partnership and recognizing
that no continent has greater

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:55.900
potential or greater upside than
the continent of Africa if they

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:59.633
in fact have the kind of strong
leadership that these four

00:04:59.633 --> 00:05:01.500
individuals represent.

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:04.500
And we intend to continue to
engage with them through a range

00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:09.800
of programs -- through the
Millennium Challenge, through

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:14.200
the USAID, through the
PEPFAR programs --

00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:18.200
but we're also looking for new
models that can potentially

00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:21.066
improve our bilateral
relations even more.

00:05:21.066 --> 00:05:23.700
The last point I'd make --
we all discussed some of the

00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:25.400
regional challenges involved.

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:29.667
Obviously, economic development,
prosperity doesn't happen if you

00:05:29.667 --> 00:05:31.633
have constant conflict.

00:05:31.633 --> 00:05:35.600
And nobody knows that more
than these individuals.

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:39.600
Some like President Koroma
has seen that firsthand.

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:43.066
Now many of the threats
are transnational.

00:05:43.066 --> 00:05:46.934
You've seen terrorism
infiltrate into the region.

00:05:46.934 --> 00:05:52.200
We've seen drug cartels that are
using West Africa in particular

00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:53.934
as a transit point.

00:05:53.934 --> 00:05:58.133
All of this undermines some of
the progress that's been made,

00:05:58.133 --> 00:06:00.934
and so the United States will
continue to cooperate with each

00:06:00.934 --> 00:06:04.467
of these countries to try to
find smart solutions so that

00:06:04.467 --> 00:06:07.800
they can build additional
capacity and make sure that

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:10.834
these cancers don't
grow in their region.

00:06:10.834 --> 00:06:13.367
And the United States intends
to be a strong partner for that.

00:06:13.367 --> 00:06:16.667
So I just want to say to each
of them thank you for your

00:06:16.667 --> 00:06:18.567
extraordinary work.

00:06:18.567 --> 00:06:20.834
You should know that you have
a great friend in the United

00:06:20.834 --> 00:06:23.867
States, in the people
of the United States,

00:06:23.867 --> 00:06:26.400
and in the President
of the United States,

00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:29.633
because we believe that
if you're successful,

00:06:29.633 --> 00:06:32.533
that ultimately will help
us grow our economies and

00:06:32.533 --> 00:06:34.633
contribute to a more
peaceful world, as well.

00:06:34.633 --> 00:06:36.967
So thank you very much.

00:06:36.967 --> 00:06:39.300
Thank you, guys.

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:40.533
The Press:
Mandela?

00:06:40.533 --> 00:06:46.300
The President:
Well, obviously we're all
deeply concerned with Nelson

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:47.467
Mandela's health.

00:06:47.467 --> 00:06:49.600
He's a hero I
think to all of us.

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:52.800
I'm sure that I speak for
the other leaders here.

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:57.467
And we will be keeping him
in our thoughts and prayers,

00:06:57.467 --> 00:07:00.500
and his entire family.

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:08.433
He is as strong physically as
he's been in character and in

00:07:08.433 --> 00:07:14.834
leadership over so many decades,
and hopefully he will come out

00:07:14.834 --> 00:07:16.834
of this latest challenge.

00:07:16.834 --> 00:07:23.500
But we all recognize that he has
given everything to his people,

00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:26.266
the people of South Africa, to
the people of the continent,

00:07:26.266 --> 00:07:30.066
and he's ended up being an
inspiration to all of us.

00:07:30.066 --> 00:07:35.400
When you think of a single
individual that embodies the

00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:38.400
kind of leadership qualities
that I think we all aspire to,

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:40.700
the first name that comes
up is Nelson Mandela,

00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:45.100
and so we wish him
all the very best.

00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:46.433
Thank you, guys.
