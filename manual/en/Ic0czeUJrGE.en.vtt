00:00:04.360 --> 00:00:07.180
How do digital cameras work?

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:10.440
The camera is one of those wondrous inventions
that changed the world.

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.750
Before it arrived the only way to make a picture
was to draw it or paint it.

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:18.030
Which obviously removed a fair amount of the
spontaneity when you were trying to knock

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:22.230
out a quick selfie of yourself giving epic
duckface while eating a Maccy-Ds with your

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:23.230
bezzie mates.

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:26.541
Which is probably why Rembrandt always looked
so depressed in his self-portraits.

00:00:26.541 --> 00:00:32.450
Anyway, the camera made it possible to make
an instant picture in a fraction of a second.

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:37.660
But the process involved in getting the image
out of the camera and printed was a complicated

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:38.660
one.

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:42.670
The light-sensitive film had to be carefully
removed, sent to a processor, get developed,

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:46.329
turned into a negative and then printed onto
photographic paper.

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:47.760
In the dark.

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:52.450
Which was a problem with the rise of the digital
age, the internet and your pressing need to

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:56.960
upload a picture of Fluffy to the 'my cat
looks like Hitler' web forum.

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:01.030
But while the microprocessor revolution started
to transform many parts of our lives from

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:06.970
the 1970s onwards, the digital camera was
a relatively late invention, arriving after

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:12.060
the video camera, the mobile phone, the laptop
computer and even the Billy Big Bass singing

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:13.750
plastic fish.

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:19.460
This was because the technology that lies
at the heart of it, the sensor chip, is unbelievably

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:20.600
complicated.

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:26.270
In a film camera, light is sent through a
lens and a shutter onto photo-sensitive film.

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:31.330
Which, with a subject shot in normal light,
needs just hundredths of a second of exposure

00:01:31.330 --> 00:01:33.000
to capture the image.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.090
The front end of a digital camera works on
exactly the same principle, light is focused

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:41.360
through the lens and controlled by a shutter
and variable aperture.

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:46.700
But instead of film, there's a light-sensitive
sensor chip that has to record all of the

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.740
data in a very short space of time.

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.810
There are different ways of doing this, but
we're going to concentrate on the CMOS or

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:59.700
Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor sensor
that now sits in the majority of digital cameras,

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:06.640
from those integrated in phones to fairly
chunky DSLRs (that's Digital Single Lens Reflex

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.229
in the jargon) their the sort that look like
'real' cameras.

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:15.760
The camera's sensor is covered with tiny individual
light sensitive cells, each of which can measure

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.650
the amount of light that falls on in.

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:23.680
As the digital camera has evolved, so have
the number of these pixels on the surface

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:24.870
of the sensor.

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:29.030
Ten years ago, you'd struggle to get a digital
camera capable of delivering much more than

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:38.480
a single 'megapixel' of resolution, a million
total pixels, or a grid 1200 by 900.

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:45.090
But these days, 12 or 16 megapixels are commonplace
among top-spec 'prosumer' and professional

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:46.090
camera.

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:50.090
That's enough to enable you to produce images
the size of a magazine cover with no loss

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:51.950
in perceived quality.

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:56.612
The cells act like the photosensitive chemicals
on old-fashioned film, reacting to the light

00:02:56.612 --> 00:03:01.880
that falls on them and then reporting to the
camera's microprocessor brain.

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:06.420
That would be fine for the sort of moody black
and white shots favoured by gothy Instagram

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:07.420
users.

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:12.040
But, because most of us want to post pictures
of our lunch to Facebook in colour, it's also

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:16.459
necessary to split the light 'seen' by the
camera into the three primary colours which

00:03:16.459 --> 00:03:19.239
can then be used to create an accurate image.

00:03:19.239 --> 00:03:23.800
There are different ways of doing this: some
expensive cameras will even employ three different

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:24.800
filters.

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:29.349
But most CMOS sensors will use what's called
a 'Bayer Filter'.

00:03:29.349 --> 00:03:35.220
This is a grid of coloured filters that sit
over the sensor with red, green and blue elements

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:41.050
over individual pixels that will only allow
their respective light colours through.

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:45.050
Because the human eye is most sensitive to
green light, which largely determines how

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:49.800
'bright' an image looks, there are twice as
many green pixels as red or blue.

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:54.790
The filters are arranged in a clever mathematical
pattern, which means that the camera's brain

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:58.890
can interpolate using a demosaicing algorithm.

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:00.420
Yes, really.

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:05.930
Or, in slightly plainer language, the camera
doesn't just look at an individual pixel on

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:10.470
the sensor, it also looks at the pixels around
it to come up with an informed guess of what

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:13.330
the true colour of that pixel is.

00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:18.780
Although even the most advanced sensors in
the world still struggle with the increasingly

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:29.439
unlikely colour of Richard Hammond's hair.
