Hi, my name is Jeremy Farrell,

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:11.210
I'm the Manager of Standard Product Engineering here at VPT.

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:14.560
Today, I'm going to talk about line and load regulation.

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:17.240
Both of these specs are in our datasheet.

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:19.040
The load regulation is

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:21.890
the change in V-out when the load is

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:24.920
varied from zero to one hundred percent

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:29.840
and line regulation is the change in V-out

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:34.260
when V-in goes from its minimum, either 15 or 16,

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.400
to its maximum, which is either 40 or 50,

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.140
depending on the part.

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.300
For this example, we're going to use a

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:47.090
DVFL2812S and we're going to show that

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:50.980
the line and load regulation is well-within

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:54.360
the specs that we have in our datasheet.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.100
First, we're going to measure the load regulation of our DVFL.

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.660
The set up is critical in this measurement.

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:04.480
The DVFL has sense leads.

00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:11.260
The output voltage calculation internal to the unit is done through the sense leads.

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:15.340
If you want to measure the load regulation at the pins,

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:17.880
you can short the sense leads directly to the pins,

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.520
which is what we have in our test setup here.

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:23.640
First, it's running at no load.

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:28.360
The output is 12.019 at the output pins,

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:31.020
where the sence pins are shorted

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:36.900
and 12.019 at the load, with no load.

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.280
Next, if I switch to full load,

00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:42.820
which in this case is 9.2 amps,

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:48.480
the output at the pins is still 12.019

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.020
which is zero volts of load regulation.

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:56.460
However, the voltage at the load is 11.826,

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.920
which is a result of the resistance in the load connection.

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.300
Next, we're going to talk about line regulation.

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.480
First, the line regulation is the change in V-out

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:15.670
when V-in is varied from 16 to 40 volts for the DVFL product.

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.340
And also taking that full load.

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:23.960
Here, a full load 9.2 amps.

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:30.040
V-in is 16 volts and V-out is 12.017.

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.720
As V-in is varied up to 40 volts,

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:47.580
V-out has changed to 12.013

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.460
which is a variation of 4 millivolts,

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:53.460
well-within the specs of the datasheet.

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:55.110
When you're measuring these two parameters,

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:58.500
the measurement point is critical for V-out.

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.740
For our parts with sense pins,

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:05.760
V-out should be measured at the sense pins and wherever they're connected.

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:07.740
For our parts without sense pins,

00:03:07.740 --> 00:03:10.260
V-out needs to be measured at the pins

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.900
because any kind of connection resistance

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.020
can cause a large variation in the V-out measurement.

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:25.420
Thank you
