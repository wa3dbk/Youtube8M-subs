00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:06.420
What's up, guys?

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:07.420
Jeff Cavaliere, ATHLEANX.COM.

00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:11.870
So, it's Washboard Wednesday, and we're talking
about Squats??

00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:12.870
Stick with me here guys.

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:14.870
I promise you that this will be worth your
while.

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:19.850
You see, when you go to do your heavy Lifts,
if you're not thinking about your abs, and

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:23.080
I mean thinking about actually contracting
your abs,

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:27.070
you're probably not lifting nearly what you
could lift because your abs provide such an

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:32.070
important stabilization to your big Lifts
that allow you to direct all of your energy

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.070
towards that big Lift.

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:34.449
I talk about it all the time.

00:00:34.449 --> 00:00:38.470
These energy leaks are the bane of your progress
in the gym.

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:41.110
If you don't have a good, stable core,

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:44.470
you're going to lose a lot of the force that
you're trying to generate and put into the

00:00:44.470 --> 00:00:45.470
Lift.

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:47.150
We don't have to have that happen.

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:52.330
If you don't believe me at how much of an
impact this can have on your Squats, do this

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:53.519
quick test for me.

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:54.519
Stand up.

00:00:54.519 --> 00:00:55.519
Stand up right now.

00:00:55.519 --> 00:00:58.960
Stand up and just go through a Bodyweight
Squat, and I want you to do it two different

00:00:58.960 --> 00:00:59.960
ways.

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.500
The first time, I'll demonstrate it right
here.

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:02.780
You can watch me.

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:09.229
I want you to allow yourself to breathe in
as you go down, and then breathe out on the

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:10.229
way up.

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:12.729
We all hear that a lot, that breathe out on
the exertion, right?

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:16.729
For a Bench Press, we'd be down and then,
wheeew, we'd breathe out on the exertion.

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:20.060
Well, for the Squat, we think we have to breath
out on the way up.

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:23.570
No, because that means we're breathing in
on the way down.

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:26.060
Try it right now and see how unstable you
feel.

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:30.451
Matter of fact, you might feel stable when
you start and as you go down, you breathe

00:01:30.451 --> 00:01:35.409
in, you lose all the stability, and you should
lose a lot of strength in doing so.

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:37.820
Now, do it the way I'm showing you here.

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:43.049
Breathe out and tighten down, contract your
abs, forcefully be conscious of how hard you're

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:44.420
contracting your abs.

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:47.730
Make sure that you've expelled the air and
that you're tightening up from the inside

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:48.730
out.

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:52.640
You're creating that interabdominal pressure
but by doing so by tightening down the muscle,

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:54.200
not just blowing out, ok.

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:55.369
There's a big difference.

00:01:55.369 --> 00:01:57.950
And when we do that, now go down into your
Squat.

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.280
You should notice an immediate difference.

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:01.950
You should feel much more stable.

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.820
The Squat should feel much lighter.

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:08.250
And now it's time to actually put it into
practice now, and put the weight on the bar.

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.289
And I guarantee the same thing will happen.

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:11.860
Now I've got some plates on the bar.

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:13.390
I do the same thing.

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:16.159
You want to focus on baring down.

00:02:16.159 --> 00:02:19.400
Tighten up those abs as hard as you can, and
then execute the rep.

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:20.890
Breathe out as you come to the top.

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:25.680
If you have to reset at the top, breathe in
and then out and then tighten down,

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:26.680
then do that.

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:30.019
It's ok if it takes you an extra second or
second and a half between the reps, as long

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:32.769
as you're getting good quality reps, that's
all that matters.

00:02:32.769 --> 00:02:37.709
So, guys, remember, even when it comes to
your leg training, your abs are critically

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:38.709
important.

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:41.090
And they should be critically important to
every single thing you do.

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:45.180
And it's such an important part of what we
do here at ATHLEANX that we build core training

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:49.170
and a core focus into every single workout
and every single exercise.

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.790
We call it putting core at the core of everything
we do.

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:55.870
If you're looking for a program that helps
you to build a big, strong core,

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:59.540
that allows you to start doing some big strong
lifts, better and better, then guys, head

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:01.940
to ATHLEANX.COM and start training like an
athlete today.

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:05.340
In the meantime, if you found this video helpful,
make sure you leave your comments and thumb's

up below,

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:09.599
and tell me what else you want to see me cover
here, and once a week, Washboard Wednesday,

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:10.799
I'll do my best to do so.

00:03:10.799 --> 00:03:12.030
Alright guys, I'll see you back here soon.
