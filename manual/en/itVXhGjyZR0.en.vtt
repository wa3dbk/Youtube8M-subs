00:00:03.735 --> 00:00:07.575
Let's make a pipe cleaner bunny with just 3 pipe cleaners.

00:00:13.555 --> 00:00:17.155
Let's start with the body. Fold a pipe cleaner in half.

00:00:18.295 --> 00:00:24.775
Twist the sharp edges a couple of times, but make sure that you're only twisting a few millimeters.

00:00:30.234 --> 00:00:34.874
Now, leave out the twisted piece, and fold the rest in half.

00:00:41.529 --> 00:00:45.929
Once again, leave free the twisted piece, and fold the rest in half.

00:01:02.896 --> 00:01:07.296
The twisted piece will be the neck, the rest will be the body and the 4 legs.

00:01:36.456 --> 00:01:39.496
Shape the body, make sure it's proportional and the front legs are shorter than the back legs.

00:01:58.735 --> 00:02:01.775
I am showing one more time how to make the body.

00:02:33.035 --> 00:02:35.195
The body should not be too short.

00:02:43.635 --> 00:02:50.635
Now secure a green pipe cleaner around the neck and wrap it around the body and between the legs. You can also start wrapping around the waste first.

00:03:12.915 --> 00:03:17.155
Once the body looks proportional, secure, and trim the excess.

00:03:45.314 --> 00:03:46.354
Shape the paws.

00:03:51.895 --> 00:03:55.095
Let's make the ears. Fold a pipe cleaner in half.

00:04:00.875 --> 00:04:03.595
Fold one more time, but leave out an inch, so the ears are not too long.

00:04:18.514 --> 00:04:19.554
Shape two ears.

00:04:24.074 --> 00:04:30.234
The ears should come behind the neck. Bend the neck around the ears backwards to secure them.

00:04:47.014 --> 00:04:51.094
Cross the two pipe cleaners in front, and then pull them back.

00:04:54.374 --> 00:04:58.774
Cross the pipe cleaners behind the head and pull them to the front. Make a loop around each ear once again.

00:05:24.634 --> 00:05:31.634
Now prepare the nose. Take a small piece of a black or pink pipe cleaner, twist it in the middle to shape the nose.

00:06:00.655 --> 00:06:01.855
Shaping the nose.

00:06:11.854 --> 00:06:14.494
Place the nose under the pipe cleaners.

00:06:29.854 --> 00:06:32.414
Now make a few rounds around each side to shape the cheeks.
