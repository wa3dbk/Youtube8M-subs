00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:12.340
What're you doing?

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:14.180
The core explodes in two minutes.

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:16.480
I can fly it out over the bay.

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.600
You could've gone anywhere but you came back here.

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:19.540
So did you.

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:21.460
I guess we're both suckers.

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:28.540
Shouldn't people know the hero who saved them?

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.300
A hero can be anyone.

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.020
Even a man doing something as simple as putting a coat on a young boy's shoulders.

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.800
I... may or may not have been that boy.

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:45.940
Oh... oh really?

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:47.500
The boy who... I don't know...

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.800
Maybe had just had his parents murdered?

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.700
Right--

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:51.840
Making me...

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.140
[sarcastically] Oh, my god, you're Bruce Wayne!

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:54.900
You know there's a bomb that's gonna go off...

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:55.940
Shhh......

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.700
It's not who I am underneath--

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:59.240
But what you do that defines you.

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:00.500
It's what I do...

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:01.880
That defines me.

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:07.640
I forgot to mention.

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.260
No autopilot.

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:12.700
So I'm straight up sacrificing myself for my city.

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:15.740
[sarcastically] Oh, that is so sad. Oh, look at the time--

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:16.980
We need a relic.

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.000
For a masked vigilante.

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:22.340
Who's name... we don't even know.

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:24.320
Perhaps Bruce Wayne...

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:25.600
[Catwoman] Oh my god, he hasn't left yet?!

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:26.480
No, I told him!

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:30.220
Batman! Aren't you forgetting something REALLY important?

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:30.920
Oh right!

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:32.100
Selina.

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:35.540
I forgot to give you... the clean slate.

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:38.220
Look at that! You already gve me the clean slate, so...

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:38.960
You can go.

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:40.040
THE CLEAN SLATE.

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:43.500
The ultimate tool for a master thief with a record.

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:44.780
I already know what it--

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:45.920
THE CLEAN SLATE!

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.020
It wipes your record clean.

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:50.120
Clean as a clean slate--

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:52.040
SHUT UP ABOUT THE CLEAN SLATE! JUST GO!

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.040
Clean slate!

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:00.020
I forgot to do my stretches.

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.380
Alright, you're about to die so you don't really need to stretch.

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.040
Okay...

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:06.320
It's a little mormy, but... fair point.

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:07.080
I'm outie.

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:10.600
One more thing.

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:13.420
I can't help but feel like our kiss was rushed.

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:14.320
What?

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.320
For a last kiss on earth...

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:17.920
It's like a seven.

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:19.560
I feel like I should get another shot.

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:20.860
If she kisses you will you leave?

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:22.300
Totally.

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:24.680
[whispers] I'm sorry. I'm sorry!

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:27.340
[sighs]

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.400
Are you fucking kidding me right now?

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:36.420
Sorry.

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:39.640
It's been awhile since a bat's been in the cave, if you know what I mean.

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:42.380
[Gordon] Yeah, see, you're not even a bat. You're a pig!

00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:43.860
[Catwoman] Save the goddamn city!

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:44.860
Okay!

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:46.100
I'll go.

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:47.900
Drop the bomb in the bay.

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:49.260
The bay.

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:50.980
Where it won't hurt a soul.

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:52.640
-Good.
-Thank you!

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:54.120
The bay.

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.900
[Gordon] Yup.

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:58.080
