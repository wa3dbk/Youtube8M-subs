00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:02.960
Whassup, everybody.

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:05.560
My name is Kid Glyde.

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:07.890
I'm the leader of the Dynamic Rockers, pretty
famous B-Boy.

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:11.000
I travel around the world, I organize events.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.120
I've been dancing for 15 years.

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:18.890
So I think I'm pretty credible to teach you.

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:23.430
Be positive, be strong, let's do it.

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:30.750
Alright, I hope you remembered to practice
your handstand, 'cause now we're gonna do

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:31.750
the headstand.

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:33.250
Headstandâ€”self-explanatory, we're basically
doing a handstand, but on your head!

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:35.090
But, we wanna do it correctly.

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:38.690
Alright, so let's do this, the right way.

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:44.600
You wanna have your head, just the top of
your head, not the center, the top of your

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:45.600
head on the floor, alright?

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.300
'Cause this right here, is where your neck
is strict, is where the neck, and all the

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.500
weight goes, into the neck.

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:54.210
So, think of a pyramid, alright.

00:00:54.210 --> 00:01:01.670
Alright so, hands are up, they're even, so
they're lifting it, alright.

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:06.460
You want your head to be in the middle.

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:10.060
So basically, like I said, pyramid, alright.

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:16.970
So right here, feet up, use your stomach to
get up, do not pull your legs up.

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:20.530
Lift your stomach, your legs are up, bam.

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:26.220
Alright, this may not happen in the first
try, but you wanna keep practicing it, so

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.380
you're able to do it, alright.

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.080
The easiest way is against the wall, alright?

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:34.150
So let's do it.

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:35.310
And, there.

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:37.040
That's a headstand.

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:49.540
You open your legs, take one leg off, little
by little learn how to do it without the wall.

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:52.140
It's a lot easier than the handstand.

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.140
So, there you go.

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:54.140
Hold that.

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:59.979
You wanna be able to hold this for a good
amount of time.

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:05.649
And get a lot of strength, lifting your neck.

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:11.719
So now, if you think you're ready, let's try
it, let's try it without the wall.

00:02:11.719 --> 00:02:22.309
Alright, same thing, triangle, top of your
head, pull your hips up, use your stomach,

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:32.620
plant your feet, open, together, and there
you go, you got your headstand!

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:32.870
Keep practicing.
