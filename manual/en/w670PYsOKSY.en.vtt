00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.570
We're going to look at how to set up
clipless pedals and shoes.

00:00:06.249 --> 00:00:10.480
First, set the cleat placement in the
shoe. The cleat is this little metal

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:15.170
interface that actually clips into the
spring retention system on the pedal.

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:19.020
Placement on the bottom of the shoe is
really important for pedaling efficiency

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.600
but also affects how well you move your
weight around on the bike.

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:26.690
In the bottom of your shoe, you have two
of these slots so you can move the cleat

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:30.760
up and down and get a feel for where you
want to place that cleat .

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:34.560
Something I see a lot of with coaching is
a lot of people have their cleat really

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:39.200
far forward in the shoe and that will
make you ride slightly toe-down.

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.330
It's not always the best place to be,
especially if you're riding technical

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:47.090
trails. So actually sliding your cleat
further back in the shoe will make you

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:50.262
stand a little bit flatter on the
pedal rather than being up and

00:00:50.262 --> 00:00:51.770
on your toes like that.

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:54.990
There's a slight argument in that if you
stand a little bit more toes-down,

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:59.060
you'll use your calves more for pedaling
but there's nothing that really proves

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:03.470
that that is a more powerful pedal stroke,
so something I definitely know is if you

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:07.960
bring that cleat a little bit further back
it will flatten your foot out and that can

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.190
really help with riding technical terrain.

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:14.690
The ball part place start with your cleat,
is about on the ball of your foot.

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:19.100
I actually run my cleat as far back in the
shoe as it will go and that slides my foot

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:23.110
a little bit further forward on the
pedals. Makes me slightly more heels-down

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:26.610
and that really suits my style of riding,
but something that's well worth playing

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.480
around with, that front-to-back
movement on the shoe.

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:33.510
With your cleat you'll get two bolts to
mount that cleat to the bottom of the

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:36.610
shoe, but also you'll get this
little plastic spacer.

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:40.590
First thing you'll do is mount that cleat
at the bottom of my shoe in that fore-

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.660
to-aft position I feel is comfortable for
me. And then try and actually put the shoe

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:47.750
on, and clip into your pedal.

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.710
If you feel any of that rubber touching
that pedal and restricting you

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:56.400
from clipping in or clipping out,
I would then try fitting the spacer.

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.320
That's going to bring your cleat a little
bit further away from the shoe and that

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:02.840
might help so you don't touch that shoe on
the pedal.

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.860
Alternatively, you could just take a bit
of a Stanley blade to that rubber and get

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.140
rid of some of that rubber so you can get
in and out nicely. Crank Brothers have

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:14.120
this nifty little system with their
cleats, so one cleat has a dot on it,

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:18.030
the other one doesn't. If you put the
cleat with the dot on your right shoe,

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:23.650
you'll release at 15°. If you put it on
your left shoe, it will release at 20°.

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:28.690
So you can actually choose when you want
your foot to come out of that pedal.

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:32.647
Really nifty little system, I run the dot
on my right shoe so I've got

00:02:32.647 --> 00:02:33.972
the earlier release.

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:38.030
So once we've got our fore-to-aft
position, next we'll look at the side-to-

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.330
side placement. You might find that that
if you have your cleat too far to the

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:47.010
outside of your shoe, that's going to put
your foot really close up to the cranks.

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:52.170
So especially on your back foot you might
find that when you try and clip out you

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:56.220
actually push your toe into the crank
before you can get out of your pedal.

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:59.690
So in that case I would then slide this
cleat to the inside of the foot.

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:03.900
That's going to bring the pedal a bit
further away and the crank further away to

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:08.070
give you a bit more space. But you might
also have to play around with that so that

00:03:08.070 --> 00:03:12.510
your rubber of the shoe doesn't touch the
pedal before you clip in or clip out.

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:17.270
Alternatively, you can actually fit
spacers to the pedal to bring that pedal a

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:21.550
little bit further away from that crank.
So now to set the angle of this cleat

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:26.020
in the shoe. You really want that to match
your natural stance on the pedal, so nice

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:30.000
and square, in line with the length of the
shoe, is probably the best place to start.

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.800
Try that out, see how that feels. You can
also play around with that a little bit,

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:40.690
angling that cleat slightly so that it's
already closer to the point of release of

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:44.840
the pedal, so you toe it inside like that,
even when you're stood normally,

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:49.030
it's really close to popping out. It
depends how you like it. Some people don't

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:52.930
like that you might come out of the pedal
when you're not expecting to.

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:56.610
Once you found that nice placement of this
cleat, make sure you tighten it down nice

00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:59.790
and tight. You don't want these coming
loose or a bolt falling out.

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:03.940
I have seen that happen . What then can
happen is that cleat will start spinning

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:07.340
in the shoe and you'll get stuck to that
pedal and then you have one of those

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:09.180
embarrassing tip-overs where you can't get
out.

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:13.790
Now for the pedals. You can get different
styles of pedals. Here is a Crank Brothers

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:18.490
Mallet DH, you can see there's a big cage
on the outside of it, a downhill pedal.

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:23.080
Here is a Crank Brothers Candy. This is
more of a cross-country pedal,

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:26.070
as you can see it's much
smaller, much lighter.

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:29.520
So let's start with the downhill pedals.
Obviously, this big cage is going to give

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:33.390
you some support. So you can actually feel
that pedal on the bottom of your shoe.

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:37.810
So you get a little bit of friction.
You've also got these little adjustable

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:41.370
grub screws, so you can play around with
those. You can feel a little bit of the

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:44.550
pedal on the bottom of the shoe.
Obviously, if you bring them out too much,

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:48.560
you'll get too much friction and that's
going to make it much harder to get in and

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:50.080
out of that pedal.

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:54.870
I really like this style of pedal, and
it seems to work really nicely with

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:58.470
a slightly softer-soled shoe. It feels
almost like a flat pedal.

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:02.730
You can actually feel that pedal in the
bottom of your shoe. What you'll find is

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:06.930
with these smaller cross-country pedals,
they're suited much better to these

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:11.420
cross-country shoes. They'll have a much
stiffer sole, so you don't really need the

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:16.820
extra support of a big platform pedal, you
just got that sole support on your foot.

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:20.990
As you can see with this big downhill-
style pedal, the shoe is really touching

00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:25.080
the pedal, so there's a lot of feel
there in the bottom of your foot.

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:29.970
Also really good for maybe for not clipped
in on a technical section and you still

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:32.070
got a big platform to stand on.

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:36.020
Compare that to the cross-country-style
shoe and pedal, obviously

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:40.560
much less platform there. So you're not
going to get that same feeling at the

00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:44.620
bottom of your foot and it doesn't matter
so much when you're clipped in,

00:05:44.620 --> 00:05:48.720
but if for any reason you ride clipped
out, it's not going to help quite so much.

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:53.350
So this is the style of pedaling shoe I
like. Quite a big, slightly heavy,

00:05:53.350 --> 00:05:58.080
but soft shoe, with a big downhill pedal,
that really does suit my style of riding

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:00.180
where I've got a good feel for the
pedal in the bottom of my foot,

00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:05.070
so it's worth matching your shoe and your
pedal to the type of riding you do.

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:08.958
