00:00:02.259 --> 00:00:05.059
 In today's video we will learn to do the worm robot. 

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.640
 Let's learn how to assemble your mechanical part and the electrical circuit. 

00:00:11.039 --> 00:00:13.039
 Let's see how it's done. 

00:00:22.339 --> 00:00:24.739
 The electrical circuit of the worm robot is very simple. 

00:00:24.739 --> 00:00:28.919
 It consists of a nine-volt battery, a switch and a geared motor, 

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:31.600
 In this case I used one of 1kg of force 

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:33.760
 and a speed of 100 rpm. 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.740
 For mechanical engineering we will use two sticks of balsa 

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:38.740
 more or less 20cm long. 

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:41.420
 They were the same as used for the spider robot. 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.160
 Remember to use a very light material. 

00:00:44.159 --> 00:00:46.619
 Otherwise we will not be able to move the robot worm. 

00:00:46.679 --> 00:00:48.679
 And another stick slightly wider balso. 

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:51.859
 We drilled a corner three sticks of balsa 

00:00:55.399 --> 00:00:56.899
 to cross an axis. 

00:00:56.899 --> 00:01:01.739
 In this case I am going through with a screw, but may use a wire or any other material. 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.859
 I look with a nut. 

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:11.780
 It should not be too tight to allow movement. 

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:15.420
 This will allow 

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:19.299
 the worm opens and closes. 

00:01:19.959 --> 00:01:23.159
 Then we cut a shorter piece, more or less than 7 cm 

00:01:23.219 --> 00:01:25.420
 to give firmness to the two corners. 

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:30.560
 I look. 

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:41.319
 Then the ends drilled two holes to install the rear tires. 

00:01:41.319 --> 00:01:44.759
 We put a shaft that holds and go through. 

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.140
 We put another tire and look with a nut, 

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:52.920
 Loosely for mobility while. And they were the two rear wheels. 

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:57.740
 For the front tires did not have the same size of the rear, so I used these larger 

00:01:57.739 --> 00:01:59.699
 and let's fix it with screws. 

00:02:05.459 --> 00:02:09.359
 The screw should not be so tight, so that the wheel turns freely. 

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.260
 After putting the tires, we must install the brake. 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:16.859
 We will use a plastic strap about 5cm. 

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:18.460
 We left. 

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:25.299
 It must be installed in this way to the rim just walk forward, and if he wants to return will slow. 

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:29.020
 Only allows this movement. Ande forward and backwards is braked. 

00:02:29.419 --> 00:02:31.659
 To set two screws are placed. 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.219
 Thus the brake is installed. Only forward and backward braking. 

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:47.539
 We have finished installing the four brakes both front and rear tires. 

00:02:47.539 --> 00:02:51.139
 That's the secret to the worm robot not only open and close the legs 

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.500
 but progresses. 

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:59.040
 This lever is about 9cm or 3.5 inches. 

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:03.000
 We make the point without being decentered support will be fixed. 

00:03:04.719 --> 00:03:06.719
 So you can generate this movement. 

00:03:07.159 --> 00:03:10.819
 At the other end we put a screw so that it can be fixed to the other leg of the robot. 

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:14.860
 The gear motor that we will use in this case is 1kg of force 

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:17.080
 and a speed of 100 rpm. 

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:20.000
 It's not a normal engine. If you buy a normal engine, 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.520
 You will not have enough force to move the worm robot. 

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:26.120
 Let's say this is part of a normal DC motor, 

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:29.840
 but at the top you will find a peñonería makes reduction 

00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:32.240
 to slow down and increase strength. 

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:37.320
 It is designed to work between 3- 12 volts. There are some six volts going to work very well, 

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:39.959
 with nine volt battery for short periods. 

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:43.600
 We must fix the motor well on the front legs. 

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:46.640
 And tighten well. 

00:03:49.659 --> 00:03:51.659
 Then install the wheel or pulley. 

00:03:52.939 --> 00:03:58.680
 Remember that connects decentered. Twice this distance will give the movement of the wheels. 

00:03:58.759 --> 00:04:00.759
 We look at the other end. 

00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:05.600
 This should allow movement like this, 

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:08.760
 so that both sides of the engine are opened and closed. 

00:04:08.979 --> 00:04:11.299
 This is the offset generated by the tires. 

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.560
 They are opening and are closing. 

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:17.460
 After installing the engine, 

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:21.599
 on the other side we can install the nine-volt battery to balance the weight. 

00:04:21.639 --> 00:04:23.639
 It can be adhered with a piece of tape. 

00:04:26.279 --> 00:04:28.799
 And you are ready to make the battery connection 

00:04:30.019 --> 00:04:30.939
 the engine. 

00:04:31.259 --> 00:04:33.500
