00:00:00.403 --> 00:00:05.678
The scene shows a WWII fighter plane that you will texture using 
the Viewport Canvas tool.

00:00:06.208 --> 00:00:10.495
At this time the plane is an Editable Poly with no mapping coordinates.

00:00:11.138 --> 00:00:15.525
To use Viewport Canvas on an object, the object first needs 
to be unwrapped.

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:20.938
However, the unwrapping process complexity can be kept at a bare minimum.

00:00:21.328 --> 00:00:24.010
Apply an Unwrap UVW modifier.

00:00:24.585 --> 00:00:30.390
In the Edit UVWs window, switch to Face mode and select all faces 
representing the airplane.

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:34.100
From the Mapping menu, select Flatten Mapping.

00:00:35.178 --> 00:00:42.961
Uncheck Rotate Clusters. This isn't absolutely necessary but it ensures 
clusters are laid out in a horizontal/vertical configuration.

00:00:43.491 --> 00:00:48.486
Uncheck Fill Holes to ensure you don't get 
any "clusters within clusters" areas.

00:00:48.841 --> 00:00:53.088
By clicking on OK, 3ds Max unwraps the UVs the best way it can,

00:00:53.303 --> 00:00:58.171
based on the Angle Threshold specified, in this case the default 
45 degrees.

00:00:58.516 --> 00:01:03.851
Notice also how unwrapping packs all the clusters within the boundaries 
of the working area.

00:01:04.181 --> 00:01:08.146
This is significant as you don't want any clusters outside 
of these boundaries.

00:01:08.378 --> 00:01:15.191
Adding to that note that Real-World Textures/Real-World Mapping 
are not recommended when using Viewport Canvas.

00:01:15.536 --> 00:01:19.934
Looking at the current results, unwrapping work doesn't usually stop here.

00:01:20.386 --> 00:01:27.516
In a typical production workflow, you'd need to clean up the UVs quite 
a bit more if you are paving the way for work in a paint application.

00:01:28.029 --> 00:01:34.506
All the smaller bits and pieces would typically need to be stitched 
to other clusters and the cleanup time can be substantial.

00:01:35.001 --> 00:01:41.804
With Viewport Canvas, you can already stop working on your UVs even 
at this early stage and start painting away in the viewport.

00:01:42.147 --> 00:01:45.079
Notice the UV coordinates display in the viewport.

00:01:45.377 --> 00:01:49.097
You can get rid of that by collapsing the model to an Editable Poly.

00:01:49.324 --> 00:01:51.214
The UV coordinates will be preserved.

00:01:51.669 --> 00:01:55.382
You also need to ensure that the model has a material applied to it.

00:01:55.382 --> 00:02:00.152
In this case, a Standard material with default settings has already 
been applied to the model.

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:05.019
From the Tools menu, choose Viewport Canvas. A floating dialog appears.

00:02:05.297 --> 00:02:11.322
Always ensure the model is selected, otherwise, you get a warning 
if you try using a Viewport Canvas tool.

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:17.377
Click the Paint tool and choose the Diffuse Color as the channel 
to paint on. A dialog appears.

00:02:17.622 --> 00:02:23.957
Since you have not specified a bitmap in the applied material, 
you will use this dialog to create a base bitmap.

00:02:24.255 --> 00:02:28.467
You will then use Viewport Canvas tools to edit the bitmap 
in the viewport.

00:02:28.797 --> 00:02:31.522
Specify a Preset Size of 1024. 

00:02:31.832 --> 00:02:37.012
This represents a medium to high quality settings, a 1024x1024 pixel image.

00:02:37.695 --> 00:02:43.538
Change the color to a pale olive green. This represents the base color 
for the newly created bitmap.

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:48.840
Save the file to a local folder and give it a name, for example P47.TIF, 

00:02:49.123 --> 00:02:52.213
which was the number given to the Thunderbolt WWII fighter plane.

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:57.048
Click OK to exit the dialog, now the plane has a green color applied to it. 

00:02:57.543 --> 00:02:59.603
Next, you add a camouflage pattern.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:03.690
With Viewport Canvas, it is important to make good use of layers.

00:03:04.033 --> 00:03:09.430
Avoid painting on the Base (Background) layer as you cannot delete it 
or make edits to it.

00:03:09.953 --> 00:03:17.543
Create a new layer. Double-click its label and rename it: "Camo". 
You will use it for the camouflage pattern.

00:03:21.008 --> 00:03:28.326
Choose a darker green color and bring your cursor onto the model's 
surface. You can see the effect of the brush before applying it.

00:03:28.588 --> 00:03:34.191
Set the Hardness value to 90%. Camouflage patterns are usually 
well-defined, not blurred.

00:03:34.608 --> 00:03:38.961
The brush size can also be changed but remember that it is screen-dependent.

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:43.980
This means that the brush can get bigger or smaller as you zoom in or out
of the scene.

00:03:44.296 --> 00:03:49.931
Start laying down a few brush strokes on the wings and the horizontal 
stabilizers.

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:05.189
Notice as you paint that the strokes affect the top and the bottom 
of the wings.

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:08.920
This is because the brush is spherical, not circular.

00:04:08.921 --> 00:04:15.374
In this case, the diameter value of the brush is larger 
than the distance that separates the top and bottom faces of the wings.

00:04:15.723 --> 00:04:18.905
When you're done with the wings, try painting on the fuselage. 

00:04:19.155 --> 00:04:23.120
Notice how easy it is to match the seams between the left and right sides.

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:31.950
Notice also that since the brush size is smaller than the width 
of the fuselage, you're only painting one side at a time.

00:04:50.906 --> 00:04:54.286
Finish off the work by painting the tail of the plane.

00:04:58.596 --> 00:05:02.181
Create a new layer and name it "Nose".

00:05:07.381 --> 00:05:11.883
Switch to a Yellow color and paint the nose of the airplane.

00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:19.690
If you make a mistake, hold the shift key and paint over the areas 
you want to erase. 

00:05:19.888 --> 00:05:23.103
This is faster than switching to the Eraser tool.

00:05:34.305 --> 00:05:37.393
Switch to a brown color to paint the air intake.

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:41.680
Instead of a Paint brush, try the effect of a Burn brush.
