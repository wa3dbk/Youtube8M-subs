SCOTT GIAMBASTIANI: Hi.

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:09.610
I'm Scott Giambastiani, one of
the executive chefs at Google.

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:12.220
In our cafes, we feed thousands
of hungry Googlers

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:13.090
every single day.

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:15.015
And we're always trying to come
up with new, interesting,

00:00:15.015 --> 00:00:16.960
fun, and healthy recipes.

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:19.620
Today I'm happy to introduce a
new search feature from Google

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:22.020
that allows you to find
that perfect recipe.

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.500
Let's say you are looking
for a recipe for chili.

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.390
When you search for chili
on google.com,

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:27.620
you'll see many results.

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:29.900
But not all of them
are recipes.

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:33.150
In the left hand panel, we've
added a new link for recipes.

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:36.450
Click it to see just recipes
in your results.

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.120
Part of our food philosophy at
Google is to use local and

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.620
seasonally-sourced ingredients
whenever possible.

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:43.960
The recipe search feature is
a great way to come up with

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:45.670
recipes for ingredients
that you may not

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:47.270
have cooked with before.

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:49.590
Let's just say you picked up
some turnips and are wondering

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:50.990
what you can make with them.

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:52.850
Search for turnips on Google.

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:56.580
Click into recipe view, and
get plenty of ideas.

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:58.460
Ever find yourself in a
situation where you need to

00:00:58.460 --> 00:00:59.660
prepare a dish, but
you're finding

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:01.090
it hard to get inspired?

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:02.330
Well, there's good news.

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:03.720
Now you can search
for anything--

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:06.380
such as a holiday, or event--
and get recipes.

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:08.990
For example, you can search
for baby shower, or Saint

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:11.890
Patrick's Day, and get
all kinds of ideas.

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:14.020
Here at Google, we always
prepare something fun for

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:14.970
Cinco de Mayo.

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:16.720
Let's use the recipe search
feature to come

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:18.930
up with some ideas.

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.360
With this new search feature,
you can further slice and dice

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:22.730
your results.

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:25.910
One way you can refine your
results is by ingredient.

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:29.290
For example, you can click Yes
on chicken or avocado to see

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:31.190
only recipes with those
ingredients.

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:34.120
The ingredient list updates
dynamically based on what

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:35.020
you've searched for.

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.680
If you have limited time to
cook, the recipe search

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.420
feature helps you find foods
that can be prepared in less

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:44.560
than 60, 30, or even
15 minutes.

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.230
If you're looking for lighter
recipes, you can even filter

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:50.340
your recipe search results
by calories.

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:52.410
Now finding that perfect recipe
to share with your

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:55.760
friends and family is as easy
as searching on Google.
