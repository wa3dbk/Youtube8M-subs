BRYAN KARNEY: Hi.

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:06.600
My name is Bryan Karney.

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.080
I am a professor of civil engineering
at University of Toronto, and the

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.430
Associate Dean of Cross-Disciplinary
Programs.

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:17.060
And I would like to invite you to join
us this year as we look at this new

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:20.750
course, which is going to explore
our energetic planet.

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:23.940
The earth is a phenomenally
energetic place.

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:28.060
The surface of the earth is surrounded
by phenomenon, and include everything

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:33.080
from waves breaking on a beach, to
watching a river flow, to perhaps

00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:37.060
looking at an amazing cloud formation
and seeing the light and the water.

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:41.370
And when we look at those things we're
looking at not just mass, not just

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.000
matter, but we're looking at
the transfer of energy.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.490
We're looking at how that moves from
one place to another, and how it's

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:49.740
transformed in its movement.

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:53.890
We also are going to be looking at the
most tranquil things, looking at light

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:56.520
on water when we might walk by a pond.

00:00:56.520 --> 00:01:00.400
And what our challenge in this course
is to connect these images together,

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:05.760
to ask why sometimes energetic
phenomenon are dispersed and widely

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:09.780
separated, why they sometimes
concentrate together into amazing

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:14.540
things like waterfalls or like waves
on a beach or like a thunderstorm.

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:18.720
And what we're fundamentally going to
do is to try to use energy as the

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:23.610
theme or as the metastory, the story
that underlies all the other stories

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.300
of how these transformations
take place.

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:29.780
We're going to be looking at some basic
questions, the questions that

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:34.160
humans have asked since time immemorial,
questions like why is the

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:38.650
sky blue, where does the wind come from,
and where does the wind go to?

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:41.620
Well, we're also going to ask some very
interesting questions, like why

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:45.950
is the Earth as warm as it is, and
why does it get older when we go

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:46.980
deeper in the ocean?

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:50.280
And perhaps we'll ask why does it
get colder when we go up in the

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.120
atmosphere?

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:56.020
We know that hot air rises, so
why is it cold when we go up?

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.340
And we're going to try to connect
these things together, so we

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:01.820
understand the circulation of the
oceans, the circulation of the

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:06.410
atmosphere, and how it relates to this
overall theme of our energetic planet.
