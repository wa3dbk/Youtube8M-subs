Hello and welcome to Neeta in Kitchen.

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:12.480
Today we will make Dry Ginger Powder.

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:16.480
Dry ginger powder is easily available in market but

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.600
it costs very less when made at home.

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:23.400
Moreover you are very sure of its quality and hygiene

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.640
It is one of the most used spices in Indian dishes.

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:28.280
Let us see how we can make

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:29.980
dry ginger powder at home.

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:33.540
Here we have taken 200 grams ginger.

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.300
We have properly washed the ginger and

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:39.580
dried it with the help of a clean cotton cloth.

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:43.260
It will wash away all the mud from the ginger.

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:47.980
Now we will cut the ginger in small pieces.

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:50.760
Ginger has many medicinal properties

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.920
It keeps you of a from cough and cold.

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:58.860
It helps to improve digesion, it also decreases colestrol.

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:01.400
We have many other medicinal properties

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:03.240
which ginger possess.

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:08.520
Dry ginger powder is used in many dishes like

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.700
tea masala, buttermilk, raw mango powder

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.880
and many many others.

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.860
In a similar fashion we will cut all the ginger..

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.640
We can make ginger powder in two ways:

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:25.640
The first method is to dry ginger pieces in sunlight.

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:29.440
For that spread the ginger pieces nicely in a wide plate

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:32.860
or tray and let it dry in sunlight for two days

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:35.580
It will be dried and you may then grind it.

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:38.660
in a mixture grinder to make dry ginger powder.

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:42.140
Now if you want to make ginger powder immediately

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.180
you can make it in a microwave.

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.140
Let us look at the microwave method

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.380
of making dry ginger powder.

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:53.060
First of all spread the ginger pieces properly in the

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:57.460
microwave so that it is heated properly on all sides.

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:04.660
After spreading them nicely, microwave it at

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:07.800
sixty percent (60%) power for around 5 minutes.

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.640
While you are continuously sterring it.

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:19.780
We stir it in between so that

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:24.000
all the pieces are equally heated.

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:34.220
When this is done we will again microwave it for five

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:37.800
minutes but this time at eighty percent (80%) power.

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:47.540
After microwaving it for five minutes at 80 % power

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:50.620
Now we will give it a 10 minutes standing time.

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:54.880
Now we will observe that the ginger is dry

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:57.100
and ready to be powdered.

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:00.700
Put it in a grinder and grind it very well.

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.660
to powder it completely.

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:05.920
Our dry ginger powder is now ready.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.640
You can keep it in an airtight container

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.660
and use whenever required.

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:13.620
