00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Snoop Dog's trying to add me on fac-e-book

00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:13.020
Eh, right. Uh thats perfectly fine but um (ignore) its called facebook.

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:15.100
It's called Facebook

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:17.160
Thats what I'm saying

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:21.540
No you're saying Fac-e-book. You're saying Fac-E-Book!

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:23.020
It sounds the same to me.

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:28.180
But its not. It- Look, just say what you're saying. Say Fac-e-book, say fac-e-book.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.220
Fac-e-book

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:31.460
Now say Facebook

00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:33.080
Fac-e-book

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:35.200
*super annoyed hand gesture by annoyed Jack*

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.040
Did I get it right?

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:43.180
No, you didn't! You're seperating the 'e' for some reason. You're saying 'fac', then you're giving the e its own little place.

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:46.960
Like a detached house. It's a lonely 'e' Dean. It's shivering in the cold.

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:47.980
Like you're nan at christmas

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:49.840
You don't even know my nan, she lives in Tenerife

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:52.980
And you genuinely don't know you're doing it do you?

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:53.900
Look at your face!

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:55.300
You don't know you're doing it!

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:56.980
I'm gonna record it.

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:57.940
Okay?

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:01.660
Say Facebook.

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.320
Fac-e-book.

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:04.580
You just did it then.

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:05.780
You just did it then!

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:07.000
Listen.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.600
*recording of Dean saying Fac-e-book*

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:09.600
What did you hear?

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:10.860
Fac-e-book.

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.180
Yes!

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:16.680
But you think I'm saying Fac-e-book?

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:19.540
Yes.

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.040
When I know, I'm saying Fac-e-book.

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.740
*annoyed* Right!

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:25.900
Listen up!

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:26.960
I'm only gonna say this once.

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:28.820
What's this?

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:29.900
That's a book.

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:32.080
Well done! Gold star!

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:32.920
Get off me.

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:34.680
Now what's this?

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:35.980
Your face!

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:38.880
Right! You should be proud of yourself.

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:40.920
Now say these two words together.

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.100
Book-Face. *slam*

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.340
Try Again

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:46.100
Pff

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.240
Come on Dean, its not that hard your nan could do it!

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:56.860
You don't even know my nan! She can't read

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:03.540
Fac-e-book

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:23.060
Why'd you flip the tabl-e

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:24.840
TABL-E!

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:25.920
WHAT IS A TABL-E

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.760
I dont even know what that is!

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.700
You see this plant?

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.340
This is you

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:35.600
I wish that was you!

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.060
Did you just punch a cabbage?

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:38.180
It's a metaphor

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:39.940
Your face!

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:42.420
wow

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.720
Dean, this is what you've taken me to.

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:45.320
Destruction.

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:47.920
That's what- you made me do this!

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:49.300
I'll put it back for ya.

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.780
It's all because you, you can't say Facebook

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:58.180
I don't understand it!

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.060
What's so hard about saying Facebook?!

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:01.800
Did you take you're shirt o-

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:03.640
Right!

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.680
There is absolutely no logic to what you are doing!

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:09.460
You are seperating random 'e's from certain words. For absolutely no reason

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.400
Why're you doing it?

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.000
because it annoys you Jack.

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:18.380
Fac-e-palm.

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:20.420
Okay, I am tired. My fingers hurt- good night.
