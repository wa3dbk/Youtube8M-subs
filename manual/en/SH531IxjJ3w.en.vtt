00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:03.740
if you're a fan a pot legalization and
then broke Obama's got some good news

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:04.259
from

00:00:04.259 --> 00:00:07.640
before you or at least you that made
some statement that you give you some

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:11.400
a I think good good impression where we
might go over the course the next year

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:11.880
too

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.950
now he was recently interviewed by The
New Yorker

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:18.020
and talked about how dangerous he
thought pat was and this is actually

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:19.480
good stuff he says

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:23.670
as has been well-documented I smoked pot
as a kid added you as a bad habit and

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:24.310
advice

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:27.550
not very different from the cigarettes
they spoke to the young person up to a

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:28.880
big chunk of my adult life

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.630
I don't think it is more dangerous than
alcohol little

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:36.690
bath obvious and a good sign is
recognizing the obvious

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.370
so yet we're making progress as bush you
say

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:44.350
so I i'm happy about that it's a big
deal that in my lifetime

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:47.730
we we present on the United States
America saying that pot is less

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:48.980
dangerous than alcohol

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:53.960
i mean i i grew up other Reagan years
have I

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.199
we've had that I would not envision that
okay

00:00:57.199 --> 00:01:00.090
so it's a great development and they
have actually taken some affirmative

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:00.820
steps

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:03.890
legally to make sure but they're not
cracking down

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:07.320
on pot a special words but legalize
recreational uses Colorado Washington

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:07.990
Center

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:11.950
who is live a long long long way to go
yes could present Obama do more

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:16.110
legally yes and did he in his first term
break the record for

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:19.290
most amount of dispensaries yes okay

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.810
but feels but you have course israel's
but it

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:26.280
at least once he has begun his verbal
transition

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.450
at some point legal transitions follow

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.960
yeah so look at his position on gay
marriage that he

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:37.040
didn't actually believing gay marriage
earlier on in his first term

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:42.229
was ridiculous right but once his
evolution begins in is usually around

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:45.670
when the issue gets above the 51 percent
mark I

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:50.329
as it did on gay marriage and as it has
now on POD hey I and it looks like it

00:01:50.329 --> 00:01:52.020
moves people to some extent

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:56.020
and hopefully this will as well your and
Obama's not a leader

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:00.689
he is a politician and hence he's a
follower but once he gets ahead of the

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:03.500
train like now the train is headed in
that direction

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.579
any jumps on board it does give the
train momentum your

00:02:06.579 --> 00:02:10.959
so that's why it's important now I see
you often pointed out the hypocrisy

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:14.900
a Bronco Bama smoking pot talking about
it when he was younger and now working

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:16.550
to enforce a system that

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:19.730
that makes it illegal for other people
here's a good sign he says

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.129
we should not be locking up kids are
individual users for long stretches the

00:02:23.129 --> 00:02:26.340
jail time when some other folks who are
writing those laws have probably done

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:27.550
the same thing

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:31.480
so he seems to at least be self-aware
pock received from some of his

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:36.430
pretty previous actions so I look I'm
slightly torn on acres I actually I love

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:37.019
that quote

00:02:37.019 --> 00:02:40.060
I love it I think that's exactly right
that's what I've been hoping a

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:41.819
politician would say for a long time

00:02:41.819 --> 00:02:46.170
you know and and applies a clinton to
apply so George W Bush in and apply so

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.780
Obama

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:51.269
lololol other legislators who all smoke
not of course not all legislators a

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:53.340
smoke but a lot of apps modified

00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.980
and at the park but and the head bowed
up on we try to

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:01.050
and then said the area I don't you
should send all those kids in a jail

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:02.159
ruin their lives

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:06.060
for the same exact thing I did get at
least Obama's pointing out his own

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:07.349
hypocrisy and others

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:10.530
cialis or mostly completed on that is
that

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:14.819
president I'm always seems to react to
his own presidency as if he's not the

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:15.909
president

00:03:15.909 --> 00:03:20.120
right like what you're the guy who broke
the record on the dispensary raids

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.560
and and all those people you said the
prison so like

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.349
it is is it news do you like he always
like whenever anything bad happens

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:31.200
but he comes out like %ah we were
tapping Angela Merkel's phone

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:36.140
I golly gee are you I'm shocked shocked
to find other that was happening

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:39.799
yellow for putting kids in jail for the
same thing I did hun

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:43.000
whether this five years in my presidency
Epping in Epping out although he's like

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.849
Kelly from the office when he talks his
own some sub out:

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:49.470
it's like I'm not paid into that stuff
many watch the tape players like holy

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:50.760
shit I'm anti bot

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:56.250
I but it but again we're making progress
on this is really important that

00:03:56.250 --> 00:04:00.870
and he also was with other partners the
seems to understand how the war on drugs

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:04.500
inherently discriminatory not apply the
same way to different groups

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:08.750
he says it's important for to go forward
the legalization or at least experiment

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:09.580
in Colorado

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:13.530
disperse specifically because it's
important for society not have a

00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:16.859
situation in which a large portion of
people have at one time or another

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:21.479
broken the law and only a select few get
punished there is talking about how

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:24.630
you know if you're white your lot lot
less likely to go to jail for somebody's

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:27.560
same crimes for smoking the same
substances for injecting

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:32.030
the same substances input so the racial
a go for a second even if you take it

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:34.290
out that role he so right about that

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:38.800
they just as Martin Luther King said if
you're a poor white kid in Appalachian

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:41.840
you're gonna suffer the same income
inequality but in this case you are

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:42.699
gonna suffer

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:45.770
the same justice and equality Union
locker for pot

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:49.310
do you like them for taking any kind of
drugs but the guys who

00:04:49.310 --> 00:04:53.199
why are politicians are that are in
beverly hills or wherever they are

00:04:53.199 --> 00:04:57.320
10 not going to get locked up for pie
you know what I know everybody knows it

00:04:57.320 --> 00:05:02.340
for that year the best my kids that
eager just think it's gonna Prince them

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:06.250
yeah they're not gonna get locked up for
pilot me might be a really rare

00:05:06.250 --> 00:05:07.050
exception

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:11.500
whereas if you're in the Bronx or urine
Logan West Virginia

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:14.520
their new it like that to you think
they're gonna blink an eye before they

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:16.370
send you to jail for twenty years

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:20.560
now the OU get laptop if you drive drunk
and kill people now we've got a weather

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:22.280
that in this country we don't have

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:23.870
I justice equality
