As you can see those chips are coming off
and it's not a bad idea to wear a face mask.

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:08.360
For filming right now I'm not going to wear
this face shield because it makes the voice

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:12.220
sound kind of funny and you can't really understand
me but make sure you have one of these in

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:16.460
your shop and if you are roughing it keep
the mouth closed because those chips will

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:23.159
come right in your mouth if you're not careful.
Now while we are talking here and while I

00:00:23.159 --> 00:00:28.039
have got a minute to talk I want to talk about
kind of my simple principles of cutting and

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:32.950
I'm not sure who told me this but they said
you use the ABC's and I have added a D to

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:38.110
the cutting principles. The first thing we
want to do is always we want to anchor the

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:44.070
tool and we want to anchor it before it touches
any wood, anchor it on the tool rest. The

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:49.510
next thing we want to do, the B is the bevel
and what we want to try to do on our tools

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:54.440
like most of our gadgets, we want to try to
rub a bevel. So we anchor it, then we put

00:00:54.440 --> 00:01:01.600
the bevel on the tool. We are not cutting
yet and now we can have another fulcrum or

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:06.920
support point the tool rest and the bevel
is the support point. Then the C we want to

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:12.640
do is cut. So now we cut and now you can start
to see that the shavings are coming off. So

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:18.369
I've anchored, I've got the bevel rubbing
and now I'm cutting. The D I have added is

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:22.600
direction and there is a lot of things as
far as direction goes. The first thing I always

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:27.810
want to think of is the direction of the flute.
If I am cutting in this direction I want that

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:34.020
flute not to be open like this where it is
looking straight at me. I want it to be closed,

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:39.490
closed in the direction I'm going. This kind
of a cut is going to get a catch and it will

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:44.159
be quite dangerous for you so make sure you
close it in the direction you are going. I

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:48.600
also want as far as the direction goes, I
want the tool pointed in that direction. I

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:54.969
want to point it in that direction and we're
going to cut this direction, cut up hill because

00:01:54.969 --> 00:01:59.219
remember we showed you the broom, the fibers
there and you want to make sure that it is

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:04.130
going in that direction. So we'll cut in that
direction. The handles point in that direction

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:10.220
and here is another D, we want that handle
down on that. So there's the ABCD's of cutting.
