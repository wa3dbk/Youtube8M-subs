00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:10.700
[Music]

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:16.500
- If you want to convey an idea with passion
and with purpose, this is the book to read.

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:21.460
- To Sell Is Human isn't just about selling,
it's about sales being an important part of

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:23.040
what life is.

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:29.330
DEBBIE MILLMAN: Any time Dan Pink comes out
with a book, I always make a bee-line for

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:30.710
the bookstore.

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:31.710
They're more than books.

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:32.750
They're like primers for life.

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:38.079
JEAN CHATZKY: He takes in an awful lot of
information and spits it back out in a way

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:40.530
that makes it more, not less accessible.

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.890
CATHY SALIT: I don't know whether Dan would
say this, but one of the ways that I read

00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:47.120
the book is that it's about relationships.

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:53.159
MIKE RUGNETTA: This idea that selling is part
of being human, I very much disagree with.

00:00:53.159 --> 00:00:58.359
I think I was really excited to read it, but
maybe because of how skeptical I was.

00:00:58.359 --> 00:01:01.780
DOV SEIDMAN: Dan Pink really understands the
world we now live in.

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:07.880
How it's changing and how it means for us
to turn these changes into an advantage.

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:17.080
DEBBIE MILLMAN: To Sell Is Human is about
how to move people with authenticity, with

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:18.450
passion, and with purpose.

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.329
MIKE RUGNETTA: Daniel Pink splits the book
into three parts.

00:01:21.329 --> 00:01:23.480
The first part is the Rebirth of a Salesman.

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:28.289
DANIEL PINK: One day, I went back, I looked
at my sent emails, I looked at my calendar,

00:01:28.289 --> 00:01:30.670
I looked at the tweets that I've sent.

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:35.030
I realized that an enormous portion of my
time involved selling.

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:40.409
Not only selling books, but just convincing
people, persuading people, cajoling people.

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:44.180
I had this bizarre realization that I'm a
salesman.

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:49.540
DEBBIE MILLMAN: The book truly cemented the
suspicion that I've had which is, we're living

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:52.109
in a world now where we're all salespeople.

00:01:52.109 --> 00:01:57.170
DANIEL PINK: One in nine American workers
earns their living trying to get someone else

00:01:57.170 --> 00:01:58.450
to make a purchase.

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:03.710
But those other eight in nine—they're in
sales, too, in what I call non-sales selling.

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:08.090
They are pitching at meetings, they are asking
their boss for a raise, they're asking people

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:09.090
out on dates.

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:14.220
MIEK RUGNETTA: I don't think I buy the idea
that we're all in non-traditional sales selling.

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:20.770
I don't see the world that way, so I think
to cast everything in the sales light—I

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:22.020
feel like it cheapens it.

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:26.140
DANIEL PINK: You tell people I'm in sales,
you're in sales, we're all in sales now and

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:30.160
people's reaction to it is, oh God.

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:39.110
- When I think of salesmanship, I think somewhere
between an infomercial and a car dealership.

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:42.600
DANIEL PINK: Sleazy, smarmy, cheesy, slimy.

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:46.720
It's like these are the new seven dwarves,
right?

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.980
I thin that view of sales is a description
of the past.

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:57.280
DEBBIE MILLMAN: The old, old-school mentality
of ABCs, always be closing, was despite any

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:01.360
resistance, always close the deal.

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:04.000
We're living in a very transparent world now.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.270
The modern day salesperson can't be selling
via manipulation because it's too easy to

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:10.270
see through that.

00:03:10.270 --> 00:03:14.420
MIKE RUGNETTA: I think the Internet has done
a lot to change the way that people behave

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:17.670
both as salespersons and as consumers.

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:21.720
The connection between consumer and producer
is now direct and it makes both of those people

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:22.720
a lot more powerful.

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:27.770
DANIEL PINK: Until very recently, the seller
always had more information that the buyer.

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:30.250
And so the seller could rip you off.

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:35.010
In the last ten years, that information asymmetry
has started to end.

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:41.370
CATHY SALIT: Now what's required to be affective
is to be more collaborative and more democratic.

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:46.840
DOV SEIDMAN: It's not just selling something
to somebody, but rather investing them in

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:47.840
a relationship.

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:51.420
CATHY SALIT: Dan's saying, look, the world
has changed and we need to grow.

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:56.340
We need to shift our mindsets and here's some
things to do to help you along.

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:02.160
CATHY SALIT: Dan puts together research that
other people have done and he himself does

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:07.680
really interesting research and gives us a
new way to see something that we think we

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.910
completely understand but we now have an entirely
new way to understand it.

00:04:11.910 --> 00:04:16.280
DANIEL PINK: One of the things I talk about
in the book is the move from ABC, Always Be

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:21.350
Closing, to what I think are the new ABCs
which are Attunement, Buoyancy, and Clarity.

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:25.060
Attunement is about seeing the world from
someone else's perspective, which is the prelude

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:27.290
to actually helping them out.

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:31.410
Buoyancy is how do you remain afloat when
you're dealing with rejection.

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:35.560
Clarity is how you help people make sense
of murky situations and solve problems they

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:36.730
don't realize they have.

00:04:36.730 --> 00:04:40.960
DEBBIE MILLMAN: In his sort of ABC of selling,
Dan sort of gives you the tools to convey

00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:44.680
a message that's actually going to move somebody
and not manipulate them.

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:48.190
JEAN CHATZKY: I really like the how-to aspect
of the book.

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:53.000
Do these couple of exercises, try X, Y, &amp; Z.
DOV SEIDMAN: We're building new muscle, new

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:58.250
mindsets, and new habits of relating to others
and he does give us the gym to go to and build

00:04:58.250 --> 00:04:59.250
that new muscle.

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:03.750
DANIEL PINK: One of the exercises is a test
that social psychologists use to measure prospective

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:05.410
taking called the E test.

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:07.150
JEAN CHATZKY: Y'know what, I did the E test.

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:08.150
I failed.

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:12.740
I was so sure that I was gonna come out on
top, but it really bothered me that I failed.

00:05:12.740 --> 00:05:16.690
DANIEL PINK: You ask the participants, snap
your fingers 5 times quickly.

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:23.150
[Snapping] Then, on your forehead, draw a
capital E. There are two ways that I draw

00:05:23.150 --> 00:05:28.750
a capital E. The first E, the one that looks
like this, I'm taking my perspective.

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:31.940
This E, I'm writing it so you can see it.

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:33.680
I'm taking your perspective.

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:37.900
One of the keys to persuading, influencing,
selling other people is to see the world from

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:42.801
their perspective and so if you do this test
and you're always going like this, you're

00:05:42.801 --> 00:05:44.540
gonna have a problem persuading people.

00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:51.520
For me, the exercises are integral because
I want this book to translate into action.

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:56.240
CATHY SALIT: I'm thrilled that he wrote this
book.

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:58.150
It isn't just about selling.

00:05:58.150 --> 00:06:03.220
He's teaching us something about sales being
an important part of what it means to be human.

00:06:03.220 --> 00:06:08.650
DOV SEIDMAN: Whether we like it or not, we're
all in sales and if we come to appreciate

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:14.090
sales as a human endeavor, we'll bring forth
our best humanity and that is to our mutual

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:15.090
advantage.

00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:20.280
DANIEL PINK: This sleazy, smarmy, cheesy,
sort of sales can become more humanistic and

00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:24.860
if we do it more like human beings, we end
up doing it better.

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:29.250
And, you can sleep at night.

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:34.730
Hi, I'm Dov Seidman.

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:36.050
My name is Cathy Salit.

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:37.080
I'm Debbie Millman.

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:40.110
I'm Mike Rugnetta from PBS Idea Channel and
you're watching THNKR.

00:06:40.110 --> 00:06:41.990

And we're friends.

00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:56.270
I'm gonna high-five the cameraman now.

00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:56.271
Yes.
