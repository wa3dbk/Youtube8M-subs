00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:10.250
So I am going to demonstrate for you how you
would bandage a torn toenail from a dog. We

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:18.640
are working with Ty here and he has torn his
right dewclaw. Dewclaw is the nail that is

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:26.470
upside on the leg and he has torn that completely
off. So first thing that we want to do is

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:33.949
you can see that the hair around the dewclaw
is a little bit matted and the first thing

00:00:33.949 --> 00:00:42.720
we need to do is clean that area up. We need
to brush that hair out. Now you can shave

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:51.299
the area if you want to. I am trying to save
the coat so I am just going to brush this

00:00:51.299 --> 00:01:02.460
area out. It is going to tender and sore so
I am being very careful to hold the hair away

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:14.640
from the skin so I don't hit the skin with
the brush

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:28.680
and it is actually matted like this because
he has been licking it. Ty stop. I am going

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:44.440
to expose the area. Put your head down. Okay,
put your head down. Okay you can see that

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:49.979
it is a little bit red and raw here, the area
that he has been licking; the area around

00:01:49.979 --> 00:02:00.600
the dewclaw that is missing and in fact I
will scissor the hair away from this area;

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:12.660
make it a little bit easier to work. Okay
he is very obvious sensitive in this area

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:23.520
so I am going to work carefully.
So this is the dewclaw here. It is a little

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:29.560
bit swollen. The dewclaw itself is actually
missing. We are going to clean this area out

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:40.700
here. I am going go use some Betadyne from
my first aid kit; some Betadyne and cotton.

00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:48.099
If you can leave a wound like this open for
the air to heal, that is always better but

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:56.280
if the dog is worrying it, licking it and
causing it to swell up like this then we really

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:00.870
do need to close it off. Before we close it
off though, I want to clean it out.
