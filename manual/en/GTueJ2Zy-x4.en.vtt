Hi, I'm Chris Wall and we're here at the Boulder Rock Club

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:15.760
We're doing an 8 week training program using only the auto belays as a method of protection

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:23.260
The TRUBLUE system is there to provide safety for a single climber who would otherwise have to have to have another climber climbing with a rope

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:36.960
When we started this 8 week program, we really had no idea how things were going to turn out

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:45.120
Everybody was all over the map, from rank beginners to very advanced, expert climbers and everything in between

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.120
I've never climbed before

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:50.020
Jenn my wife has improved a lot

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:55.860
She's climb 5.10 minus, she didn't even know how to do route climbing, put on a harness, or anything when she started

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.360
She's looking super strong

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:01.520
I think Rick has improved a lot. He's in the best shape I've ever seen him in

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:07.720
He started out with virtually no experience, not being able to get up 5.8, and is now moving into the 5.10 range

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:13.840
You know since I started this I feel like my clothes fit better, I feel like I have more strength in my upper frame, I've got more energy

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:17.680
We both benefitted a lot from Tyler and Marc's advice

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.700
Marc is our overall fitness specimen

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:26.740
It's been super fun to work with Marc. He and I, depending on the routes that we're on, have very different strengths, we approach things differently

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:34.260
There's a lot of finesse in climbing. It makes you realize how much technicality there is in the sport

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:45.240
I've been climbing with Tyler a lot. We climb really similar grades. He excels a little bit more than I do on the dead vertical and I excel a little bit more than he does on the overhanging

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:56.880
Shannon came to us with an interesting situation. He has a fair amount of alpine climbing experience and quite a bit of rock climbing experience, but he was coming off of a pretty severe ankle injury

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:11.000
I've been really impressed with Megan, who wasn't a huge climber at all before starting, and I think today she's climbing 5.11 or on the brink of 5.11 which is pretty bad ass. I've been really impressed with her

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:21.120
One person who has helped me out a lot during this whole thing, on several occasions, has been Leslie

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:29.700
Leslie tops out the talent pool in our women's group of team TRUBLUE. She comes to us with a very high level of fitness and quite a bit of climbing experience

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:34.800
Candie has done really well.

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:36.460
She just had a baby.

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:38.200
She's progressed so much

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.760
She's getting to the top on 5.9s now

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:58.920
As a team, this group has really coalesced. They've really pushed each other and acted as partners in a non-traditional sense in climbing. They're not belaying each other, but they're more like actual teammates giving their energy to each other and motivating each other to come in, do their homework, and push each other while they're here

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:00.940
Chris has definitely helped a lot

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:04.360
He's really given me the confidence to reach my goals

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:09.240
Having a structure behind it and a progression has really helped

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:14.740
He's a really energetic guy and you're really like, you can really get behind him

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:17.080
I was really impressed with the progress overall

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:21.620
Everybody improved their climbing by at least a grade

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:35.140
We started the Reach Your Peak program because we wanted to show a different look at how to use auto belays and show people how they can actually integrate the auto belays into their own training program

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:46.260
So even if you don't have an awesome trainer like Chris Wall guiding you along, we want you to be able to follow us through our progress and be able to do the same thing in your own gym on the auto belay

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:13.440
