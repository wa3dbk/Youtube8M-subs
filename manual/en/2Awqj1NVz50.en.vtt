Welcome to a new Tutorial!

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:52.670
And i show you how you can create a world
of warcraft privat server 

00:00:52.670 --> 00:01:11.370
on patch 3.3.5 thats wrath of the lich king.

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:31.450
For this you 
have to download these files the links are

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:35.210
in the description.

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:52.189
And now we go into the repack folder.

00:01:52.189 --> 00:02:05.049
I downloaded the maps and the database separately,
alternatively you can extract them with these

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:18.550
Extractors.Then you copy the four folders
into the Core folder and then you start the

00:02:18.550 --> 00:02:19.550
repack control panel.

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:25.400
And this red means, that the paths are not
set up correctly.

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:43.690
And how you 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:03:01.910
see 

00:03:01.910 --> 00:03:30.030
it became green so it 
was correct.

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:37.970
And then start everything.

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:53.980
So and now we have to create a new account,
you can do this by typing 127.0.0.1 in your

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:56.240
webbrowser.

00:03:56.240 --> 00:04:07.590
Password is not long enough.

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:24.650
Now go into the WoW Client Folder and edit
the realmlist.wtf to set realmlist 127.0.0.1
