00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:04.290
What's going on YouTube Omarr here with the
s4

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:05.760
This video we're going to be looking at how

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:07.730
To check if you've got a software

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:10.160
Update on a samsung galaxy s4 very very

00:00:10.160 --> 00:00:12.320
Simple all you do is you go into

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:14.200
The settings menu by clicking the menu

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:15.829
Button there and then you go

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:18.801
Onto more tab right down to the bottom to

00:00:18.801 --> 00:00:20.530
About device

00:00:20.530 --> 00:00:22.750
And then you hit the Software Update button

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:23.990
You'll get these options

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:26.330
Here obviously you can set up an auto update

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:28.260
So it automatically updates whenever

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.080
There's one available and you have this

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:31.310
Option here to

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:33.770
Only download the update once you are

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:35.480
Connected to a wifi

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.260
Of course you can manually check if there

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:39.260
Is an update

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:40.890
I've already downloaded this so this is

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.340
What you'll get and all you do

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:46.649
Is you'll get message here

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.739
With the amount all you do is you select the

00:00:49.739 --> 00:00:52.149
Okay button the device will be rebooted

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:55.990
You'll get like an Android robot kind of spinning

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:57.260
Around and stuff

00:00:57.260 --> 00:01:00.660
To say that it's being updated so you'll get

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:04.409
This screen once its rebooted and all it is

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:09.600
Is a little Android robot and you've got like

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.280
A percentage bar on the bottom

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:16.350
To say that it's been updated so once it's
finished

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.740
Installing the update it'll automatically

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:22.630
Restart like so and your phone should boot

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:24.260
It'll start to optimize

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.840
The applications are on your phone one

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:31.400
By one like so

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.090
As you can see there its going through each

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:36.080
Application optimizing it for the new update
now

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:38.710
With this stability Update Samsung

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:40.990
Addressed the issue of the space

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:43.189
The hard drive space

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:45.950
The space which allows you to put your stuff
on

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:49.650
Cause if you remember they actually used half

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:52.840
Of the allocated space for system applications

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.200
So with this update you'll be able to transfer

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.049
Applications over to your micro SD card

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:02.220
From the software itself

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:05.560
And there you go if we just keep the a second
to

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:11.050
Initialize and we start the...if we just wait

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:12.560
For the widgets and stuff

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.800
If you go into...the way you check it is you
go

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.780
Into the settings menu go into the same place
where

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.849
You went before so that's about device

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:24.150
And then here the build number will change

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:25.450
As you can see this was a different

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:27.900
Build number before and now its changed to

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:33.200
The new update and that's basically it

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.120
And you'll get this message to say the device

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.170
Has successfully been updated so that was
a

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:39.670
Quick look at how to check if you've got an
update

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:44.720
And also install an update over-the-air or
wirelessly

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:47.069
Which is same thing on your Samsung Galaxy
s4

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:48.629
