Tara: We're here today with David Solomon
of Peachtree Audio, and he's doing trainings

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:08.900
at Crutchfield today. So we're just going
to talk to a little bit and learn a little

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:13.670
bit more about Peachtree. So we're going to
start here with the iDac, which is one of

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:16.540
your newer products and if you can just explain
a little bit about it.

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:20.501
David: Yeah, the iDac was something that we've
had in the works for quite some time. It's

00:00:20.501 --> 00:00:29.030
really for, for people who have multiple digital
devices. With an iPod, you can stick this

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:37.050
into our, into our, our dock, and this dock
is actually a digital dock that will take

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:43.510
the information from the iPod, the 1s and
0s from the iPod instead of the analog output,

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:48.899
and transfer it directly to our DAC, which
basically, our DAC doesn't know that this

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:54.629
is an iPod. It thinks it's a high-end CD player,
as it does anything that transfers 1s and

00:00:54.629 --> 00:01:01.229
0s. So you have all kinds of things that you
can hook it up with. It's got an iPod input,

00:01:01.229 --> 00:01:07.409
digital iPod input. It's got a USB for your
computer, coax. And then you've got opticals

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:14.700
for things, like Apple TV. So just about any
of the devices that you have, that are digital

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.049
you can hook up to this.

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:21.159
Tara: And would you explain a little bit about
why using this, as opposed to the electronics

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:23.960
that are built-in to the iPod? Why this is
such a huge improvement?

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:28.200
David: Yeah, the iPod's actually got a very
good D-to-A converter, but the one thing that

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.390
it doesn't have is, is a big power supply.
You just can't really fit much of a power

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:38.259
supply into something like this. So we don't
have to rely on the power supply of something

00:01:38.259 --> 00:01:42.579
like this. The only thing that we rely on
out of this device, or any of the other digital

00:01:42.579 --> 00:01:49.320
devices are the 1s and 0s. If we can get the
1s and 0s out of this, our unit basically

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.759
thinks that it's high-end CD player.

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:57.340
Tara: So this is going to take signal from
an iPod, your computer, Sonos, even a gaming

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:02.110
system, and let you play it through your high-end
system and have it sound fantastic.

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:05.189
David: That's right. That's exactly right,
because a lot of people have systems that

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:11.250
they really adore right now. The problem is,
is they've got 7 or 8 analog inputs and frankly

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:17.320
there are no more analog sources, other than
a turntable these days. Everything else is

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:23.610
digital. The problem is a lot of people take
these digital sources, convert them to analog,

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:28.410
put them through their analog setups and the
performance is never very good.

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:29.920
Tara: But with this it will be.

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:33.490
David: Yeah, with this, it's going to be very,
very good.

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:36.970
Tara: To learn more about Peachtree Audio,
just give us a call.
