00:00:02.822 --> 00:00:09.438
In this set of videos, we’ll create and animate a facial control rig using Softimage Face Robot.

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:15.582
This first video introduces you to Face Robot and how to get set up to use it.

00:00:16.769 --> 00:00:20.028
Face Robot is a special mode within Softimage designed to

00:00:20.028 --> 00:00:25.324
quickly create versatile facial animation rigs for humanoid heads.

00:00:26.487 --> 00:00:32.199
It also provides tools to animate the rig using either keying or motion capture data.

00:00:37.032 --> 00:00:39.968
In a nutshell, here’s how it works:

00:00:40.339 --> 00:00:46.486
Through an initial four-stage process, Face Robot binds the head mesh to a soft tissue model.

00:00:47.066 --> 00:00:51.431
This soft tissue model is a solver that controls how the face deforms

00:00:51.431 --> 00:00:54.894
when you create facial expressions for your character.

00:00:55.722 --> 00:01:02.633
Although you can’t technically see this solver, you can think of it as an invisible mask covering the face.

00:01:03.273 --> 00:01:09.465
This mask is divided into regions that roughly match where the facial muscles are on a real face.

00:01:10.463 --> 00:01:17.862
You control these regions with a set of animation controls in a rig that Face Robot creates during the process.

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:24.739
Moving these controls drives the regions which simulate soft tissue compression on the face.

00:01:25.958 --> 00:01:29.839
Each one of these controls affects a specific region of the face.

00:01:30.775 --> 00:01:35.425
This makes it much easier to create variations of a given facial expression

00:01:35.425 --> 00:01:39.746
since you can layer these deformations together in a modular fashion.

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:43.224
This is referred to as a “bottom-up” approach.

00:01:43.786 --> 00:01:47.139
We’ll expand on this further in the following videos.

00:01:47.722 --> 00:01:50.620
So let’s get started with our zombie character.

00:01:51.413 --> 00:01:58.933
He used to be a somewhat lazy, slightly overweight country club employee…and now, he’s just a zombie.

00:01:59.515 --> 00:02:04.455
We’ve set up this poor fellow as a simple, unrigged mesh in T-stance pose,

00:02:04.455 --> 00:02:07.965
similar to what you would see in a production pipeline.

00:02:08.871 --> 00:02:13.737
Once you’ve gone through this set of videos and are more accustomed to the Face Robot workflows,

00:02:13.737 --> 00:02:16.718
you can apply them in your own custom pipeline.

00:02:17.404 --> 00:02:23.332
To access the Face Robot controls, you must first enable its mode from the main menu bar.

00:02:25.094 --> 00:02:30.477
This automatically switches the default Softimage layout to the Face Robot layout,

00:02:30.477 --> 00:02:35.562
which opens up a new side panel with all of Face Robot’s tools and controls.

00:02:36.142 --> 00:02:40.959
You’ll also notice that new Face Robot elements are loaded into your scene

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:43.206
in a special Face model hierarchy.

00:02:43.895 --> 00:02:47.873
These elements are used by Face Robot throughout the setup process,

00:02:47.873 --> 00:02:50.975
so it’s important not to change or delete them.

00:02:51.816 --> 00:02:55.514
The first stage of the solving process consists of loading our model,

00:02:55.514 --> 00:02:57.654
setting its DNA type,

00:02:57.979 --> 00:03:02.053
and making sure it meets the Face Robot modeling requirements.

00:03:02.786 --> 00:03:07.261
We’re actually off to a good start since we’ve already loaded our zombie model.

00:03:07.901 --> 00:03:13.236
You can also load other types of heads and spare parts from the Library tabs.

00:03:15.516 --> 00:03:17.495
Next, go to the Type tab.

00:03:18.244 --> 00:03:23.391
Here you set whether your character’s face DNA is symmetrical or not.

00:03:23.939 --> 00:03:29.976
If we don’t count the exposed left brain lobe, the zombie’s face itself is symmetrical,

00:03:29.976 --> 00:03:33.830
so click on the Apply button next to Human Face Symmetric.

00:03:34.561 --> 00:03:40.788
This choice will affect the next stages of the solving process, which we’ll cover in the next video.

00:03:42.162 --> 00:03:46.811
Now the last thing we need to do before moving on to the next stage is to go through

00:03:46.811 --> 00:03:49.850
The ten Face Robot Modeling Requirements.

00:03:50.556 --> 00:03:57.265
Basically, this is a list of “what to do” and “what not to do” to ensure a successful solving process.

00:03:58.232 --> 00:04:02.548
First off, Face Robot is designed to work with humanoid heads,

00:04:02.548 --> 00:04:07.259
as opposed to animal heads or extreme cartoonish facial proportions.

00:04:08.247 --> 00:04:12.711
That said, it’s flexible enough to adapt to different human head proportions,

00:04:12.711 --> 00:04:16.277
as is the case with our zombie’s exaggerated features.

00:04:17.415 --> 00:04:25.433
As a general rule of thumb, Face Robot supports mesh resolutions ranging from 1,500 to 20,000 polygons.

00:04:26.655 --> 00:04:30.254
A denser head will result in more detailed deformations,

00:04:30.254 --> 00:04:33.859
but could be more difficult to manage once you start animating it.

00:04:34.796 --> 00:04:40.441
On the other hand, a head with too few polygons could affect the Face Robot solving process,

00:04:40.441 --> 00:04:42.643
which wouldn’t give you good results.

00:04:43.687 --> 00:04:49.708
The zombie head we’re using is at the lower end of this range to reflect the polygon count limitations

00:04:49.708 --> 00:04:52.296
you may have when working in a game pipeline.

00:04:53.591 --> 00:04:58.117
Since Face Robot relies on facial anatomy, you’ll get much better results

00:04:58.117 --> 00:05:01.423
if you model your head with proper topology in mind,

00:05:02.173 --> 00:05:07.540
with edge loops expanding from the eyes and mouth, and matching the main facial muscles.

00:05:08.583 --> 00:05:14.342
Make sure your model is pointing in positive Z, and uses positive Y as its up axis.

00:05:15.606 --> 00:05:20.923
If your model is too small, either by design or by scale, Face Robot may have problems

00:05:20.923 --> 00:05:25.371
distinguishing one vertex from the next, which will cause solving problems.

00:05:26.603 --> 00:05:30.267
To avoid this, consider modeling your character following a unit system,

00:05:30.267 --> 00:05:34.573
as well as using the sample heads from the Library for reference.

00:05:35.947 --> 00:05:39.129
The eyes, teeth, and tongue all need to be separate objects

00:05:39.129 --> 00:05:43.199
since they will be controlled individually by the Face Robot rig.

00:05:44.045 --> 00:05:49.705
The tongue is not absolutely necessary, but since we’ll be doing some lip sync later on,

00:05:49.705 --> 00:05:52.902
our zombie will look a little bit weird without one.

00:05:54.154 --> 00:05:59.348
It’s important that the eyes be centered on their pivot, or else they will not rotate properly

00:05:59.348 --> 00:06:02.388
and you’ll end up with a googly eyed zombie!

00:06:03.464 --> 00:06:07.629
Face Robot is designed to work best with separated head models.

00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:13.373
This means we don’t want our zombie’s body to be used during the solving of the head.

00:06:14.167 --> 00:06:20.095
So an easy way to get around this is to extract the head as a separate object first,

00:06:20.095 --> 00:06:24.059
and then recombine it with the body once we’re done animating the head.

00:06:27.166 --> 00:06:31.708
Select the zombie mesh, then select the ‘zombie_head’ cluster.

00:06:32.889 --> 00:06:36.774
This selects the polygons associated with the head and neck.

00:06:37.853 --> 00:06:40.896
It’s important to include the neck in our selection

00:06:40.896 --> 00:06:45.234
since Face Robot accounts for the neck muscles in the solving process.

00:06:46.216 --> 00:06:49.150
Depending on the type of character you are working with,

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:53.315
you could also extend your selection to the collarbone and shoulders.

00:06:54.295 --> 00:06:59.756
With the cluster selected, choose Extract Polygons (delete) from the Model toolbar.

00:07:01.159 --> 00:07:06.062
Now that we’ve literally cut off our zombie’s head, we can hide the body mesh

00:07:06.062 --> 00:07:09.412
and rename the new object to “zombie_head_geo”.

00:07:11.494 --> 00:07:19.001
All openings in the head must be closed, which includes the inside of the mouth, the eye sockets, and the nostrils.

00:07:19.886 --> 00:07:23.412
But what about the hole left at the base of the neck?

00:07:23.412 --> 00:07:26.054
Shouldn’t we close it like all other openings?

00:07:26.691 --> 00:07:33.382
Actually, we don’t need to because Face Robot supports it as long as it’s the only hole in the head.

00:07:35.026 --> 00:07:41.062
Finally, the last requirement refers to the global position of the head's center.

00:07:41.062 --> 00:07:49.708
You can place it anywhere on the positive Y axis, as long as it's set to 0 on both the X and Z axes,

00:07:49.708 --> 00:07:52.591
corresponding to where the neck joins the head.

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:59.104
With these modeling requirements met, we can go ahead with the solving.

00:07:59.948 --> 00:08:07.793
In the next video, we’ll start the solving process which will allow us to bring some life back into our zombie's head.
