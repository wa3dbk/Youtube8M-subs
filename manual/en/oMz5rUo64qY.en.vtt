00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.360
This week’s creator’s tip shows you guys
how to use the keyword suggestion tools from

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.410
YouTube and from Google to formulate great
tags for your videos, titles for your videos

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:13.420
and even help you know what kind of videos
to make for your audience in the first place.

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:15.060
That’s coming up.

00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:19.150
Hey guys, my name is Tim Schmoyer and welcome
to another week of creator’s tip where every

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:22.539
week, I help you guys who are making online
video content know how to make that stuff

00:00:22.539 --> 00:00:24.060
stand out on the web.

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.710
And this week, we’re going to look at the
keyword suggestion tools from Google and YouTube.

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:30.909
We actually talked about this a little bit
in last week’s creator’s tip video about

00:00:30.909 --> 00:00:35.360
how to formulate a simple but effective video
marketing strategy for your brand, product,

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:36.460
company, yourself or whatever.

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:38.160
If you haven’t seen that, I’ll link it
up below so you can go check it out.

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.580
I want to dig into it a little bit more this
week because it really is essential for making

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:47.010
your videos optimized for search engines and
also driving new traffic and new viewers to

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.010
your videos.

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:50.300
Let me start off with a real life example
for you guys that’ll hopefully tie all this

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:51.300
together for you.

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.530
A friend of mine is really passionate about
fishing, in fact, he’s even opening up an

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:57.970
online fishing business and he really likes
making online video.

00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:01.990
So he wants to combine the two to have the
videos drive traffic to his business website

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:06.219
and sell some of the lures, rods and all sorts
of stuff that he’ll be making personally

00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:08.719
and selling.

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:13.770
But fishing is so broad, what kind of videos
should he make for fishing that would have

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.649
the maximum impact, draw the maximum number
of viewers, what are people really even looking

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:19.479
for in the field of fishing online anyway?

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:23.560
So I go to YouTube’s keyword suggestion
tool and I just search for fishing and I find

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:29.090
out that there are over 10 million searches
for bass and there are over 100,000 searches

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.730
for bass fishing every month just on YouTube
alone.

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:37.040
Of course the word bass, b-a-s-s could also
refer to like the guitar.

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:45.649
So we’re going to focus in on bass fishing
specifically that has over 100,000 searches

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:46.649
every month on YouTube.

00:01:46.649 --> 00:01:50.130
There really wasn’t a whole lot of people
searching for fly fishing or different lures

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.600
or things like that so that helps him know
what kind of videos to focus in on.

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.759
Not only does that help him know what kind
of videos people are actually looking for

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:00.939
in his niche, but is also helping him know
how to maximize his efforts to get the most

00:02:00.939 --> 00:02:03.011
amount of viewership for that video that he’s
creating.

00:02:03.011 --> 00:02:06.719
If he was making something about fly fishing,
it probably wouldn’t receive nearly as many

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:08.780
views as something he would make about bass
fishing.

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:12.909
It also helps him know that he should make
his titles, description and his tags on YouTube

00:02:12.909 --> 00:02:17.731
just rich with words that revolve around bass
fishing and fishing and things like that.

00:02:17.731 --> 00:02:20.530
Bass fishing is actually the number two most
searched result around fishing, the number

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.819
one is bloopers and funny.

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:26.189
So if he can make his videos funny and maybe
throw in some bloopers out there as well,

00:02:26.189 --> 00:02:28.010
he gets two birds with one stone.

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:29.709
Or two fish with one hook?

00:02:29.709 --> 00:02:32.380
But what if he wants to make videos that show
up for Google search results?

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:37.650
Well, you go to the Google keyword suggestion
tool and it shows that 20.4 million searches

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.430
a month are revolving around how-to tutorials
for fishing.

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.860
But furthermore, the keyword suggestion tool
on Google shows the competition for the how-to

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:48.159
market revolving around fishing is really
low.

00:02:48.159 --> 00:02:52.720
So if he starts making videos in that genre,
he has a very high likelihood of showing up

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:55.340
pretty well on the search results for fishing
on Google.

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:59.370
After that, Google shows the second most searched
fishing keyword is fly fishing with about

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:02.790
four million and after that, shimano with
about one million searches per month.

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:06.310
So that helps my friend know that he should
make how-to videos about fishing for Google

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:09.989
and he should make bass fishing and blooper
videos for YouTube.

00:03:09.989 --> 00:03:14.239
Better yet, he can make a how-to video for
bass fishing that throws in some bloopers

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:17.400
and maybe some funny moments and he’d have
a video that works both for Google search

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:18.549
and for YouTube search.

00:03:18.549 --> 00:03:21.640
Of course, this doesn’t just work for the
fishing niche, this can work for any niche

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:22.640
at all.

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:25.730
I’ll link up the keyword suggestion tools
in the description below both for Google and

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:27.939
for YouTube so you can go check them out and
use them yourself.

00:03:27.939 --> 00:03:31.240
A couple tips for you guys as you do so, number
one, as we’ve said in earlier creator’s

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:35.349
tip videos, you want to put your main keywords
very close to the beginning of your title.

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:39.060
Also, you want to put those main keywords
very close to the beginning of your description

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.100
and put them first in your tags as well.

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:44.230
Number two, use the keyword suggestion tool
to dig down maybe a little bit deeper into

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:45.519
the keywords that you’re coming up with.

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:49.959
For example, we saw that bass fishing is the
most popular searched term on YouTube for

00:03:49.959 --> 00:03:50.959
fishing.

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:54.110
So actually take that term, bass fishing,
plug it into the keyword suggestion tool on

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:55.969
YouTube and dig down further.

00:03:55.969 --> 00:03:59.540
What specifically are people searching for
about bass fishing on YouTube?

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:03.219
And then maybe make a video about that, plug
those keywords, if it applies, of course,

00:04:03.219 --> 00:04:04.280
into your video as well.

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:07.291
Comment below and let us know if you’ve
ever used these keyword suggestion tools and

00:04:07.291 --> 00:04:10.080
if you have, how have they helped your videos
really gain a new audience?

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:13.680
How have they really helped search traffic
come in for you and how have they really helped

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:16.799
you know what kind of videos to make for your
audience and your niche in the first place?

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:18.150
