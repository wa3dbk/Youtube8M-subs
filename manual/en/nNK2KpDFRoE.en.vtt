00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:36.960
The first one we are gonna review is the M134 also known as the minigun. The M134 Tiger is a powerful weapon for almost

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:39.559
all game modes, especially zombie mode and
Battlegroup.

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:43.860
In battle group it’s really easy to destroy
vehicles like the Humvee and the truck.

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.010
and if you get spawn killed in for example Pargona
dogfight, the minigun is the perfect weapon

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:52.350
to change the game since you can destroy MD helicopters in a matter of seconds.

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:56.559
In zombie mode you can easily kill heavy's,
chariots, bombers and crushers. The minigun

00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:01.110
is a must have in zombie mode next to the
m249 nickel on your 8th slot.

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:05.869
The m134 is just a beast when you wanna camp in CQC. This maybe sounds weird but I have

00:01:05.869 --> 00:01:10.009
made severals multikills with it by just walking around in an explosive match. The minigun

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:14.210
has only one problem and that’s that the
gun is to heavy to carry around. The next one

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:17.310
is the k1 tiger.  As you may know the K1 is one of the favorite

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.000
weapons for the medic and engineer class in
WarRock.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.400
The k1 tiger shoots fast, does a lot of damage
and the tiger has a nice scope which

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:28.159
is really useful on a far distance.
Since it’s a light weapon you can move really

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:33.189
fast from one place to another, the only disadvantage is is that this weapon does not contain a lot

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:37.380
of ammo for killing several people with one
ammo clip. This weapon is a must for every

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.930
cqc player.

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:45.590
and now one of the most feared weapon on WarRock and that's the AW50F Tiger. I am not really good in sniping with any sniper

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:51.200
rifle so trying out this weapon took a little
more time then expected. The aw50f is a beloved weapon because

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.700
of its power and accuracy.
It’s good for maps where you got an open

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.450
view (like for example odyssey, nerbil or
emblem) and maps where you can hide behind

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.850
hills and objects ofcourse. This aw50f can shoot through windows from vehicles.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.040
that's also the main reason, why you, as a battle group player should get it.

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.280
The only disadvantage of this weapon is that

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:11.900
it shoots a bit slow compared to the dsr1tc
hex.

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.720
It’s just a perfect sniper rifle for long
distance.

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:16.960
and the next one is the M4A1 Tiger

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:21.220
I heard a lot of bad things about this weapon so I had to check it out myself. I don’t think

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:25.110
this weapon is that bad, the good points of
this weapon is that it’s having a good scope

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:29.720
that is similar to the scope of the G36GT.
It may look that this weapon is silenced but

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:34.599
it isn’t. The M4A1 tiger does the same damage
as the normal m4a1 and can also be compared

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:37.980
with the other m4a1 versions.
The problem of this weapon is that it’s

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.900
shooting slower than the other m4a1's. This
weapon is good for short and medium range.

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:45.959
It’s great weapon for close quarters combat
and some battlegroup maps. The speed of this

00:02:45.959 --> 00:02:48.519
weapon makes it the weakest weapon among all
tiger weapons.

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.100
and last but not least the PP91KEDR Tiger

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:54.540
The PP91 is in my opinion the best weapon

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:58.450
from all the tiger weapons. The best thing
about this weapon is that it’s silenced.

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:02.300
The PP91 lets you run pretty fast and the
damage of the weapon is great for small maps

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:05.209
like Rusty Nails.
The downsides of this weapon that it doesn't 

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:08.680
contain a lot of  ammo and it's not good
for far distance aiming.

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:14.349
If you are a person who likes to play 4vs4,
8v8 or 12v12 deatmatch it’s a great weapon

00:03:14.349 --> 00:03:19.080
to have in your inventory. The PP is a perfect
weapon for rushing tactics and for killing

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:20.960
enemies on a short distance.
