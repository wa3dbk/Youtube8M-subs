00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.530
 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:17.730
One of the most important
processes in development is

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:20.440
for a cell to divide and
increase in number to generate

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:23.630
an entire organism.

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:26.330
But at some point these cells
must stop dividing and stop

00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:29.660
proliferating and take on some
kind of specialised function,

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:32.560
and this might be to become a
neuron, a nerve cell, or a

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:34.650
muscle cell.

00:00:34.650 --> 00:00:37.430
And this choice between
proliferation, so increasing

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:40.960
in number, and differentiation,
becoming

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.900
specialised, lies at
the very heart of

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:46.980
developmental biology.

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.930
So when geneticists are
interested in a process, they

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:53.010
look for situations when
it has gone wrong.

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.460
We can then work out why things
have gone wrong, and

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.850
ultimately understand
more about how the

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:59.250
process normally works.

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:02.980
What we do is we use a tiny
worm called caenorhabditis

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:06.010
elegans, and look for mutants,
those are worms where there

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:09.350
are mistakes in their DNA,
where the control of cell

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:10.120
proliferation and

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:11.790
differentiation has gone wrong.

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:19.410
 

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:22.160
So I'm going to show you
some really cool worms.

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:23.960
These worms are wild
type worms.

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.160
They're normal worms, and
they're quite happy wiggly

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.230
around on the plate.

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:30.930
Now, I'm not particularly
interested in the whole worm.

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:35.470
I'm interested in a specific
cell type called seam cells,

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:38.380
and these are a bit
like stem cells.

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:42.590
Now, these normal worms
have 16 seam cells.

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.520
We can see these cells because
we tagged the gene with a

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:48.070
green fluorescent protein.

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:50.720
Now, I'm going to show you a
type of mutant which is quite

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:51.970
interesting.

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:54.590
 

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:57.680
These worms have fewer
than 16 seam cells.

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:00.560
And that is because there's been
a mutation, so the DNA

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.005
sequence is not correct,
in a gene called RNT-1.

00:02:04.005 --> 00:02:08.490
And RNT-1 is the worm version
of a human gene called RUNX.

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:11.600
RUNX genes, one of which is
found on chromosome 6, are

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.600
involved in cancers, and they're
key in the decision

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:17.400
making process between
proliferation, so making more

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.820
cells, and differentiation,
so becoming a

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:21.830
specialised cell type.

00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:25.000
I'm now going to show you a
mutant which has too much

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.730
RNT-1 gene product.

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:31.460
So this worm has over
expression of RNT-1.

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:34.210
So these worms have too many
seam cells, and this is

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:38.650
because too much RNT-1 protein
is being made.

00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:41.260
So essentially, I've given these
worms a tumor, which

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.130
isn't very nice.

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:45.300
And why these two different
types of mutants are

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:48.360
interesting to us is because
it shows that RNT-1, and

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.240
therefore RUNX, is very
important in the decision to

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.905
proliferate, or differentiate
and become specialised.

00:02:53.905 --> 00:02:58.060
 

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:00.990
So what we have here is a simple
biological system in

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:02.840
which to study RUNX genes.

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.350
And it's hoped that the insights
gained from this tiny

00:03:05.350 --> 00:03:08.580
but really significant worm
will help us in the fight

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:09.830
against cancer.

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:38.359
