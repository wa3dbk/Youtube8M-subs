00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.350
(♪♪♪)

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:08.480
Hi everybody! So welome back. Umm today I'm gonna 

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:12.670
be talking about something that I don't really know how many people out there 

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.860
have talked about this before. Did not research it before but 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:21.050
I don't know I haven't heard any gurus talking aobut it. Today I'm gonna be talking about 

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:25.110
tampons. Yes so the first one 

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:29.220
is the Kotex U by Kotex 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:33.300
Sleek. Uhh this is the super. 

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:37.440
These are full size, 

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:41.610
unscented... uhhhh yeah. So the ones in this box 

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:45.820
actually come in 2 colors which kind of confused me at first. One is blue, one is 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:50.000
purple. I thought that I'd gotten like a multipack by accident but 

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:54.200
apparently they just make different colors. I don't know why. I think it's confusing. 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:58.310
Anyways so those are the Kotex. The other one which I only have 1 

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:02.440
left cause I found one randomly. These are the Tampax 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:06.590
Pearl. Umm if I can find a picture online I will insert a picture here. 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:10.800
Umm they are also full size. So these are kinda 

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:15.010
I believe the top of the line for the Tampax, pearl. Umm

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:19.200
I'm not sure if these are like the top of the line for Kotex, but 

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:23.260
uhh Jenna bought these and she likes them. So, 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.350
I'm going to kind of show you the diffference between then. Umm the packaging 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:31.460
and everything. So, here are the 2 packagings. 

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:35.590
So this one, the Kotex, you can see 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:39.770
here has these little dots on it right here. So, what 

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:43.940
you do is you just.. is you

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:48.080
rip it off like so and the 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:52.270
tampon. The one by [Playtex] 

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:56.440
has these two little wings on the front. 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.640
Here you just go ahead and pull the wings and 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:04.830
it opens up this way. So you can pull the top if you 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:08.970
want to make it a little easier and there is the tampon. 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:13.180
Ok take them out and show you a 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.380
comparison. Ok this is the Pearl, this is the 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.570
Kotex. Ok so as you can see, the Tampax 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:25.620
Pearl, both are super. This one is quite thicker 

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.720
than the Kotex. They're approximately the 

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:33.830
same size as you can see. Ummm

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:38.000
the Tampax Pearl, the gripper 

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:42.180
on it has this... if you can see that... 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.390
that little swirly mark on there. So that's to kind of help you grip 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:50.610
umm. It's got like this 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:54.680
uhh pinched in I would say so you can hold it like that. 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:58.760
The Kotex on the other hand has this 

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:02.900
little flower on each side. But if you can see the difference between the shiny and the 

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:07.020
this matte... this is actually like rubber. So, 

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:11.220
for me and for Jenna we both agree that this 

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:15.440
Kotex is much easier to hold when you're putting the tampon on. 

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:19.630
So that's what we really like about these ones. 

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:23.670
Also, another thing is that even though these are both super like I mentioned, 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:27.760
the Tampax is a lot thicker than the Kotex. So if you have issues 

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:31.850
umm with the thickness of super tampons, 

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:36.000
or bigger, the Kotex is gona be a little bit thinner for you. 

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:40.190
Umm if that's an issue for you. That way 

00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:44.380
you can use the larger size tampons that hold more 

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.570
when you go out and you can't be chaning your tampon every fricking 30 minutes! 

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:52.740
Tampons! So we'll start with the Tampax. So as you can see 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:56.820
uh this is how it opens up, like that. 

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:00.950
Ok, and then this one has this like blue here 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:05.110
and this is a thick braided part of that 

00:04:05.130 --> 00:04:09.300
string. Then it just has umm 

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:13.490
I don't know like kind of ... uhh braidy string along the way. So they 

00:04:13.510 --> 00:04:17.680
say with this one that this braided part is to help stop 

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:21.760
leaks. Ok so this one opens up more horizontally. 

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:25.850
Alright, this is the Kotex. 

00:04:25.870 --> 00:04:29.940
As you can see it's quite different with the string. 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:34.080
This one doesn't come apart as easily as the 

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:38.250
Tampax does. Like it doesn't come apart. So what I'm gonna do is kinda soak it a little 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:42.440
bit in solution of some water. Just so you can see how 

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:46.650
it opens. Ok, so this 

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:50.750
is puffed up a little bit cause it has water in it. So as you can see, there is a difference 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:54.840
here between these 2. This will probably 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:58.930
be the reason why what I say later makes sense. This one comes out 

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:03.030
flat like this and it comes apart very easily. So as you can 

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:07.210
see even with absorbed water this one comes out very 

00:05:07.230 --> 00:05:11.380
horizontally. Now obviously depending how you're shaped, if you know 

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:15.600
it could be this way. It could be this way, but it opens up this way and 

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:19.780
horizontally. The Kotex on the other hand opens up 

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:23.850
um like a circle. Like it opens up this way, not 

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:27.970
horizontally. So it's still very circular. Ok, and then again 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:32.100
there's a difference between the strings of them. This one doesn't have that 

00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:36.290
that braided string. It just has a regular string with a knot 

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:40.480
on the end. So that's what you can grip onto to pull it out. 

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:44.670
Now I myself between 

00:05:44.690 --> 00:05:48.850
these 2, haven't really noticed too much difference between like 

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:52.920
leaks per say. But I did speak with Jenna and she said 

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:57.030
that the Kotex works a lot better. I don't know 

00:05:57.050 --> 00:06:01.160
if it has to do with our personal bodies, or she's a little bit 

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:05.340
heavier than I am. So I don't know if that has anything to do with it. But she says 

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:09.540
that the Kotex do not leak compared to the Pearl, the Tampax 

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:13.740
Pearl do leak uh sometimes for her. Which wouldn't make 

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:17.760
sense becuase you think the braided part would stop it and this one doesn't have. But that 

00:06:17.780 --> 00:06:21.840
is why I was thinking that they way that... the difference between this being horizontal 

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:25.910
and this being cirucular. This would creat more of a barrier 

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:30.040
for the leak to not come out. Wher since this is being horizontal 

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:34.170
you know it could cause leaks to come through one way or the other!

00:06:34.190 --> 00:06:38.320
So that is the comparison between the 2 

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:42.560
different tampons. Between umm the 

00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:46.740
Kotex and between the Tampax 

00:06:46.760 --> 00:06:50.930
Pearl. So again it is up to you which one you want to 

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:55.030
use. Uh we personally prefer using Kotex, but either 

00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:59.170
one works really well. I just thought I'd give a kind of comparison on 

00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:03.340
them. Uh the lasting time again is all gonna depend on how heavy you are.

00:07:03.360 --> 00:07:07.530
All that type of thing so you can't really compare on that cause it's very personal, but 

00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:11.720
yeah hopefully this video has helped you guys if you where thinking 

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:15.900
either and not sure which one you would like to get. You don't want to spend you know a bunch of like 

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:19.990
of liek $7 or $8 per box, or $4 or $5 per box it get 

00:07:20.010 --> 00:07:24.100
something and then if you don't like them you know that would suck. So, 

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:28.270
if you guys have any other videos that you would like me to do, comparison 

00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:32.480
product reviews, umm you know. It could be some as personal 

00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:36.690
as tampons, pad, uh makeup, beauty, whatever. 

00:07:36.710 --> 00:07:40.880
You want me to do cooking, let me know down in the comments below. 

00:07:40.900 --> 00:07:45.070
