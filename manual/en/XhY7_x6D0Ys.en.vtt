00:00:08.192 --> 00:00:11.123
Why does my internet keep disconnecting?

00:00:11.123 --> 00:00:13.032
Did you pay your last phone bill?

00:00:13.032 --> 00:00:15.142
That isn't the cause.

00:00:15.142 --> 00:00:17.813
The cause could still be your utility.

00:00:17.813 --> 00:00:22.303
The phone company might be changing the IP
address for the router near you.

00:00:22.303 --> 00:00:24.173
How do I fix that?

00:00:24.173 --> 00:00:27.993
Move to wireless internet instead of a DSL
line.

00:00:27.993 --> 00:00:32.383
Then again, it might be the VoiP and Skype
that are killing the connection.

00:00:32.383 --> 00:00:34.493
I've never heard of that.

00:00:34.493 --> 00:00:39.993
Voip is short for voice over IP, AKA phone
calls over the internet.

00:00:39.993 --> 00:00:45.043
Skype is a visual messenger service kind of
like the video calls on the Jetsons.

00:00:45.043 --> 00:00:46.743
I know what Skype and Voip are.

00:00:46.743 --> 00:00:49.813
Why would it kill my connection?

00:00:49.813 --> 00:00:54.123
Too many data packets for the limited band
width can cause the equivalent of a digital

00:00:54.123 --> 00:00:55.822
traffic jam.

00:00:55.822 --> 00:01:00.463
Too long a delay as the traffic backs up,
and you could lose the connection.

00:01:00.463 --> 00:01:03.743
They haven't implemented net neutrality yet.

00:01:03.743 --> 00:01:07.352
That doesn't mean signals don't interfere
with each other.

00:01:07.352 --> 00:01:11.833
If you have a wireless router or internet
connection somewhere, your neighbor's wi-fi

00:01:11.833 --> 00:01:14.562
could be interfering with yours.

00:01:14.562 --> 00:01:16.483
What's the solution for that?

00:01:16.483 --> 00:01:20.953
Alter the frequency or band yours is on to
eliminate the interference.

00:01:20.953 --> 00:01:23.393
I don't think it is the neighbors.

00:01:23.393 --> 00:01:25.093
It might not be.

00:01:25.093 --> 00:01:29.253
It might be your cordless phone too close
to the wireless router.

00:01:29.253 --> 00:01:32.163
My wireless phone isn't close to the router.

00:01:32.163 --> 00:01:36.382
Your ISP might be rotating the IP addresses
frequently.

00:01:36.382 --> 00:01:41.603
That'll kill your internet connection until
your local router can talk to the ISP again.

00:01:41.603 --> 00:01:45.003
I thought it might be something wrong with
my computer.

00:01:45.003 --> 00:01:50.483
If the PC was overheating and resetting, that
could interfere with the internet connection.

00:01:50.483 --> 00:01:53.543
Try dusting it with a spray air canister.

00:01:53.543 --> 00:01:56.253
Or just seeing if it overheats.

00:01:56.253 --> 00:02:01.233
Dust around a router or card connection won't
be as obvious as layers of dust inside a PC.

00:02:01.233 --> 00:02:04.683
That would mean the router was really old.

00:02:04.683 --> 00:02:06.233
It might be.

00:02:06.233 --> 00:02:10.533
And that increases the odds of a hardware
failure being to blame, too.

00:02:10.533 --> 00:02:13.163
At least it becomes an excuse for a new computer.
