"My name is Sanket Shah.

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:19.140
I'm a graduate student at the University of
Miami.

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.660
I work in the lab of Dr. Dorraya El-Ashry.

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:27.620
My project is to understand the role of cancer-associated
fibroblasts, also known as CAFs, and tumor

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:30.620
progression and metastasis.

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:36.719
My studies has revealed that these cancer-associated
fibroblasts, also known as CAFs, interact

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:41.719
and communicate with the tumor cells through
secretion of microRNAs that help them end

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:43.809
tumor progression.

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:48.230
Most interesting thing that I find working
in the lab is that it's very challenging.

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:54.190
We are always keep yourself updated to understand
new concept and you're always challenging

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:55.829
yourself.

00:00:55.829 --> 00:01:01.230
The best part is that data modeling and everything
is interesting.

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.671
When it comes to data generation, the data
generation is in the hand of the scientist.

00:01:05.671 --> 00:01:10.110
We are adding something new to the field,
which is exciting too.

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:16.280
As any high school student would be growing
up, he would like to become a sports athlete.

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:18.920
That was one of my dream as well.

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.549
Unfortunately I wasn't that good at it.

00:01:21.549 --> 00:01:24.200
I was good at studies.

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.060
I was a nerd, so to speak.

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:31.690
That's how I eventually wanted to go in the
field of science because I was interested

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:33.479
in biology as well.

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:38.850
After my dad was diagnosed with cancer, I
wanted to go into the cancer field.

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:42.329
This is how I feel I'm contributing towards
that field.

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:46.140
I was born in India, in Ahmadabad Gujarat.

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.840
The current prime minister Modi is from my
home city.

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:54.039
I think the most difficult part about research,
as any other scientist you talk to would say,

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:58.170
that you face failures on a daily basis.

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:01.890
The experiments that you plan, the hypothesis
that you have generated do not work that way

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:03.270
you want to.

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:08.280
The major challenging thing is how to overcome
those failures on a daily basis.

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.090
How to keep yourself still motivated.

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.890
That is, I think, the major challenge that
you face as a researcher.

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:21.989
The most fascinating thing is that you know
that whatever you doing is going to somehow

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:27.150
impact a patient's life somewhere down the
line, even though you are working at a laboratory

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:28.150
level.

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:32.230
There's a very strong potential that this
research and the work that you do in the laboratory

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:37.750
might be commercialized someday, and will
be present in the market for the patient's

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:38.750
use.

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:40.720
That will affect in improving the patient's
life.

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.209
That is the most fascinating thing about research.

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:48.870
I hope to achieve that I find a novel biomarker
for tumor metastasis based on the studies

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.500
and research that I have done.

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:56.250
I hope to get few good publications through
this research.

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:05.580
I hope, that the main goal after all the studies
and hard work, is that I get a good job.

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:10.659
That is the goal to do this.

00:03:10.659 --> 00:03:16.330
One message I would like to give to all the
young scientist who think that we are very

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:22.860
intelligent and we are very smart people,
that we are, but we had a thing that when

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:26.310
we were at your age we were still confused.

00:03:26.310 --> 00:03:30.040
We had no idea what we want to become.

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:31.140
Give yourself some time.

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:37.510
Take it easy, explore multiple options, see
what you like, keep an open mind and make

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:38.650
your own mistakes.

00:03:38.650 --> 00:04:04.569
Learn from your mistakes as well.
