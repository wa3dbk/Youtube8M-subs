00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:13.960
This family went from
living this urban city

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:18.895
life with financial stability
to boom, being off the grid.

00:00:18.895 --> 00:00:20.270
I don't think that
it's something

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:22.380
that many Americans could do.

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:30.090
What was that adjustment
period like for you?

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:32.189
For the first few months
that we were here,

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.890
we felt successes
after successes.

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:37.910
This is our bike-powered
washing machine.

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:40.720
I got this off of
Craigslist for $20.

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:42.820
We got this bike
at a thrift store,

00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:47.340
and we were able to select gears
so that we can go kind of slow

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.100
for a tumble, and
then we can gear up

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:54.040
and go really fast to drain
it and to spin it out.

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:58.700
The kids bathe in a bathtub
once a week on the weekends,

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:01.620
and then Nick and I also
shower at least on Sundays,

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.390
and more often if we
feel like we need it.

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:05.459
We carry water for the
shower, just like we

00:01:05.459 --> 00:01:08.190
carry everything in a basin.

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:11.094
We heat up water on
the propane torch

00:01:11.094 --> 00:01:12.635
and mix that together
with cold water

00:01:12.635 --> 00:01:14.670
until we have the
temperature right,

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.410
and then that mix will
run through a hose

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:18.910
downhill to the shower.

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:21.120
My rule is that I won't
shower at anything

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:22.330
less than 20 degrees.

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:24.580
It's something that I thought
would be a disadvantage,

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:26.650
but actually it's
very enjoyable.

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:29.310
It wasn't until the wintertime
that we met challenges

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.830
that we really weren't
able to surmount.

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:35.270
I had not been
prepared for how dark

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:38.720
it is in the wintertime when
you don't have electricity

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.546
and how that affects
your emotions.

00:01:41.546 --> 00:01:44.240
It's too cold for the kids
to be outside very much,

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.970
so we did have that
sense of family cooped up

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:47.980
in small spaces.

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:49.410
It just wears on you.

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:50.890
It just got to be really heavy.

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:52.090
I want you to calm down.

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:54.150
Find something else to do.

00:01:54.150 --> 00:01:56.760
What else could you do other
than torture each other?

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:59.760
And I had a few failures as
a homesteader at that time.

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:05.400
I had failed to take care
of my first bee colony.

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:06.998
There they are.

00:02:06.998 --> 00:02:09.289
You also mentioned you had
a confrontation with a bear.

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:12.010
So when the bear came, my
husband was out of town,

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:14.310
and I was caring for my
three children by myself.

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:16.810
And I have no communication,
so I couldn't call someone

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:17.680
to come.

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.070
That was a scary moment for me.

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:24.420
So this dish that our dog drinks
out of, it's bent in from my

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:26.374
banging it against
another pan when

00:02:26.374 --> 00:02:28.040
I was trying to get
the bear to go away.

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.940
I got this gun after we
had the bear incident.

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:36.350
I have very mixed feelings about
it, and we rarely, if ever,

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:38.180
actually load it.

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:42.600
But I do hope at some point
to gain the skills to be

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.740
able to use it.

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:48.060
Esther puts on this very
brave, optimistic face,

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:51.820
but it is clear that she
has had a tough time here

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:55.310
and has second guessed their
whole decision to move out

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:56.410
here.

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:58.460
How would you describe
your emotional state

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:00.550
having had to deal
with all of that?

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:02.790
At that point, I
considered trying

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:06.670
to hang up the homestead
idea as a failed experiment.

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:08.090
You thought, this is it.

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:09.560
We should give it up.

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:11.620
I felt like we
should give it up.

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:15.410
Nick never felt like
we should give it up.

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:19.130
We just had to reprioritize
and figure out all over again

00:03:19.130 --> 00:03:20.300
what we're comfortable with.

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:22.390
We've changed our
strategy substantially

00:03:22.390 --> 00:03:23.640
going into our second winter.

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:27.080
I'm trying to see
things as a slower, more

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:28.270
incremental process.

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:29.810
What's your five-year plan?

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:33.066
Well, five years from now, we'll
definitely be in the house.

00:03:33.066 --> 00:03:33.940
That you're building?

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:35.404
That we're building, yeah.

00:03:35.404 --> 00:03:37.070
Out of these trees.

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:39.340
My husband's an
amazing crafts person.

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:44.130
His ability to make a space
for his family to live in

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:45.760
is really fulfilling.

00:03:45.760 --> 00:03:47.770
And I heard that he
sews your underwear.

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:48.680
He sews my underwear.

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:49.960
Yes, indeed, he does.

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:54.105
I've got a kids t-shirt
here with a tiger on it.

00:03:54.105 --> 00:03:59.870
We're going to try and center
it up right on the butt.

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:03.640
I made the pattern from
an old pair of underwear.

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:06.610
I just use a kid's marker
to mark on the fabric,

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:09.510
because it's so washable,
it comes right out.

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:12.950
I think there's plenty of
stuff out there in the world,

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:17.470
so anything that I can do
to take existing materials

00:04:17.470 --> 00:04:24.080
and have them provide for us,
that's what I'm in it for.

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.440
Do you guys think
that you're unique?

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.330
Oh, I don't think
we're unique at all.

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:30.630
I think we're actually
part of a current trend

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:32.970
moving towards
alternative lifestyles,

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:35.340
and particularly
self-sufficiency.

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:39.550
How do you hope this lifestyle
influences your children?

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:42.560
I hope that it makes them
stronger, more resilient

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:43.380
people.

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:47.420
Not long ago, Milo,
in school, was

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:50.080
assigned to write a
letter to somebody,

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:53.200
so he wrote a letter
to Sadie saying,

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:56.600
I wish I could be at home
with you, and I love our home.

00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:00.010
For him to make that
one of the things

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:03.790
that he's happy to talk about
is how much he likes his home.

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:06.160
That's been pretty
awesome for me.

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:09.980
How much do you have riding
on this for this to work?

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:13.850
This is kind of
everything that I have.

00:05:13.850 --> 00:05:18.220
I don't really have
a plan B. I don't

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:21.100
know how I would go back now.

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:24.620
I don't know that I could
live in an apartment again.

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:26.478
This is where it's
all at for me.

00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:34.670
