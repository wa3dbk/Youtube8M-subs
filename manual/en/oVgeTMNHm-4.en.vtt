00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.340
I am singing – sing with me.

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:35.160
I am sleeping – sleep with me.

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.520
I am singing – sing with me.

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:46.280
I am sleeping – sleep with me.

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:52.700
Again.

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:14.560
I am singing – sing with me.

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:20.120
I am sleeping – sleep with me.

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.660
I am singing – sing with me.

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:31.320
I am sleeping – sleep with me.

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:48.460
We must slowly become equal once more.

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:57.820
Our motion is like that of a foetus…

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:09.240
A long time ago, there was nothing.

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:23.940
Though I think it’s too late to notice that now…

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:50.420
We searched, we touched, we laughed lots, and then we went.

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:53.480
We died, and we cried lots.

00:02:54.920 --> 00:03:01.620
We searched, we touched, we laughed lots, and then we went.

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.900
We died, and we cried lots.

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:21.920
Perhaps equality is not enough.

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:31.680
But I’m okay with that.

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:32.460
A long time ago, there was nothing.

00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:39.940
So I’m okay with that.

00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:46.560
I cast the flames of my burning heart towards the night.

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:52.260
Can you see them from over there?

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:57.860
Just wait for me a little longer, a little longer…

00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:23.640
Yes – that, which is more precious than anything else, is shining inside my hand…
