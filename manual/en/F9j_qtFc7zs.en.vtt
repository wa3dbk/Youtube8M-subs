00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:04.569
Hi, I'm Mark Emiley on behalf of Expert Village.
In this segment, we are going to chill our

00:00:04.569 --> 00:00:10.130
wort and get it ready to put our yeast into.
To do this, we're first going to take our

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:21.530
wort and put it into our sink. Next, we're
going to take our drain plug and put it in

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:27.680
there and start flowing cold water. In the
chilling process, we're trying to drop the

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.320
temperature of the wort as fast as we can
to encourage something called "cold break"

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.649
which will precipitate proteins and also get
the wort to a temperature at which we can

00:00:35.649 --> 00:00:39.739
mix in our yeast as quickly as we can so the
yeast has the best chance of establishing

00:00:39.739 --> 00:00:44.640
itself since it's the dominant microbe in
the wort. While I'm doing this, I'm stirring

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.559
the water around the pot in order to break
up the boundary layer that's forming of hot

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:54.390
water. Also, you can kind of give the pot
a little stir and that breaks up the boundary

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.969
layer on the inside so this will encourage
a cooler slowing...or a faster cooling. While

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:04.960
you are waiting for your wort to chill, you
may want to get a head start on the next step

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:09.730
which is yeast preparation. Since we put in
steeping hops, we're going to need to take

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:13.720
those out before we mix them with our water.
So we're going to go take our tongs and go

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:17.860
put them in our sanitization solution so they
will be nice and clean before we need to use

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:21.920
them. While we are waiting for it to cool,
we are going to start filling our bucket up

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:28.970
with some nice cold water. Now, with these
buckets, this typically represents the halfway

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:33.280
mark or (I'm sorry) the five gallon mark.
So, we're going to start filling it to roughly

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:37.090
two and a half gallons and then we're going
to top off with the wort and then whatever

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:42.790
else we need to get just above five and a
half gallons. So grab your water and start

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:48.730
pouring and filling it up. You're going to
want to fill your airlock half up with sanitizing

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:54.300
solution or water. This is going to help prevent
any microbes or air from getting in and also

00:01:54.300 --> 00:02:01.070
allow the carbon dioxide to escape. Now, with
our freshly sanitized tongs, we can go in

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:16.250
and take out our hop sack. Let it drip for
a minute or so. You really don't want to try

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:22.200
to introduce any kind of bacteria at this
point because the wort is very vulnerable.

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:30.280
And after a minute or so of letting it drain,
I'm just going to throw that in the garbage.

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.340
The hot kettle will heat up your water pretty
quickly, so once its gotten to a pretty warm

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:37.590
temperature, you're going to want to drain
it. And then we are going to fill it up and

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:48.909
get some ice next time. Now that we've filled
the sink up again with a nice cold batch of

00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:52.170
water, we're going to make it even colder
by adding a whole bunch of ice from our refrigerator.

00:02:52.170 --> 00:03:03.480
Then we are going to continue to swirl the
water around it so that it gets nice and cold

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:09.560
and breaks up the hot boundary layer. After
a half-hour or so, you should be able to take

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:16.989
out your pot, hold your hand here, and if
it doesn't feel hot at all, you are in good

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:21.439
shape. If it still feels pretty hot, you're
probably going to want to let it sit in some

00:03:21.439 --> 00:03:22.709
cold water for a little while longer.
