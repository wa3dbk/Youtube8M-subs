00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:19.380
Hello and welcome back.

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.190
That's right, today is a tie day and I bet
you can guess why.

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:28.870
That's right, it's lesson 100 and you've made
it to the end of this unit and all 100 lessons.

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:30.920
Congratulations.

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:36.090
Today since it's a special day I decided we'd
learn our first duet.

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.340
With a duet there are two parts.

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.110
The Primo part is for the person playing the
higher notes.

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:45.650
The Secondo part is for the person playing
the lower notes.

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:49.370
And I'm actually going to give you a choice
which one you would like to play.

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:54.800
The duet we're going to learn is called "La
Cinquantaine" by Grabriel Maure.

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.300
Now "La Cinquantaine" means 50th Anniversary.

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:06.300
So this is dance music that might have been
played at a 50th wedding anniversary party.

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:09.550
Let's hear what the parts sound like.

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:13.110
So first I will show you the Primo of "La
Cinquantaine".

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:15.590
This is the melody.

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:50.800
Alright next I'll show you the Secondo part
which plays the accompaniment.

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.730
Alright now is the fun part.

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:23.970
In order to hear what "La Cinquantaine" really
sounds like, I'm going to need your help.

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.200
You see I don't have four arms so I can't
play the duet for you.

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.579
I need your help.

00:02:29.579 --> 00:02:33.489
You get to choose which part of the duet you'd
like to learn and I'll play the other

00:02:33.489 --> 00:02:35.569
and we'll make music together.

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:39.209
If you'd like to learn the Secondo part click
here.

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:41.499
The Secondo part is the accompaniment.

00:02:41.499 --> 00:02:47.019
If you'd like to learn the higher notes, the
Primo part which plays the melody, click here.

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:53.859
Go ahead and choose one, and I'll see you
at the next lesson.

00:02:53.859 --> 00:02:56.040
Go ahead, choose one.

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.219
The choice is yours.

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.780
Why aren't you choosing? Go ahead.

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:04.030
Make a choice.
