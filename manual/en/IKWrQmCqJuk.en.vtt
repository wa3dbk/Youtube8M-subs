00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:05.250
Welcome back and thank you for your questions
on our last piston video. Here are a few more

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:12.250
piston FAQ's that you sent in. A lot of
your questions have revolved compression ratio

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.599
and a pistons role within compression ratio.
So first we really need to define what compression

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:29.640
ratio is. Compression ratio is the measurement
of engine cylinder volume; it's basically

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.890
a comparison of the engine cylinders volume
with the piston at bottom dead center with

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:39.989
its volume at the piston and top dead center.
If an engine cylinder had a volume of 100

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.809
cubic inches with the piston at bottom dead
center and a 10 cubic inch with the piston

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:50.210
at top dead center, the compression ratio
would be ten to one. So what factors play

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:54.940
a role in compression ratio well there are
a lot of factors there is engine bore size,

00:00:54.940 --> 00:01:00.030
stroke, piston head volume even head gasket
thickness. Summit Racing has taken a lot of

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:05.110
the guess work out of calculating compression
ratio by putting a compression ratio calculator

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:10.810
on our website under the expert advice tab.
So how do pistons fit in with the compression

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:15.950
ratio calculation well they are a huge part
of the puzzle specifically the compress height

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:22.079
which is measured as the area from the center
of the wrist pin hole to the piston deck and

00:01:22.079 --> 00:01:26.310
the piston head volume which the area over
the deck and conclude the dish or the dome

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:31.110
of this piston. These two areas make up the
physical size of the piston and determine

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:35.850
how much volume of air in the piston will
move. Another question we hear quite a lot

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.469
is what is piston to valve clearance, well
just like it sounds piston to valve clearance

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:45.299
is the area between the valves and your piston
when the piston is at top dead center. You

00:01:45.299 --> 00:01:48.479
don't want these two components to ever
touch the valves or the piston or else you

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.240
are going to have yourself a really bad day
so you're going to want to take the time

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:56.810
to check proper clearance's between the
valves and the pistons by claying the valve

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:02.789
pockets on the pistons now the amount of minimum
clearance varies by manufacturer but a lot

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:08.130
of places such as Wiseco recommend eight 100th
of in an inch on the intake valve and one

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:13.160
10th of an inch on the exhaust valve. Another
measurement you need to know is piston to

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:18.120
wall clearance. What is piston to wall clearance
well simply that is the area between the piston

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.030
and the cylinder wall? There needs to be a
minimal amount of clearance between the two

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:26.840
to prevent the piston from bonding up in the
cylinder once is expands at full operating

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:33.120
temperatures. Now minimum piston to wall clearance
is recommended by manufacturers varies by

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:38.959
the manufacturer depending on piston material
used. Most of the time the minimum piston

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:43.569
to wall clearance recommended by the manufacturer
is geared toward naturally aspirated street

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:48.140
engines now if you have a higher horsepower
engine or a forced induction engine you are

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:52.030
going to want to air on the side of caution
and use the maximum piston to wall clearance

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:58.099
recommended by your manufacturer. If you have
more questions related to pistons or any other
