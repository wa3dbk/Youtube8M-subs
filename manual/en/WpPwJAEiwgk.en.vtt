Hey girlfriend! Thanks' for tuning in!

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:24.900
If you like cooking, eating, and or having
a family, you likely spend a lot of time in the kitchen.

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:31.500
Whether your cabinets are over stuffed, your things are inconveniently located

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:37.980
or just a plain stressful place in there.
I have the top 5 ways for you to organize your cabinets and shelves.

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:43.680
Alright let's go, we have a lot to cover.
Let's get this kitchen party started!

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:52.460
Okay so kitchen cabinets and shelving can
be tricky because once you get everything in there,

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.960
it's hard to imagine taking it all
out and re-strategizing, 

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:57.740
but that's often a solution.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:03.540
There's a strategy behind where every single
thing needs to go, but to back up, 

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:05.260
the first step is this;

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:07.460
Purge lady! 

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:12.040
You done it before, get rid of the things that you are honestly not ever using,

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:16.540
and don't forget to get rid of things
that are broken or chips or that you simply don't like.

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:23.760
Okay STEP#2: Sort your like items together; get all your mugs together, your glasses, your bowls and plates.

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:30.980
STEP#3: Keep the items that you use the most often accessible even if that means breaking up your like items.

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.140
 Heeeeh?! I'll show you what I mean.

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:37.860
Over here, I have a my little mini blender
that I use all the time for my shakes

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.600
and I split it up for my big ass blender which I put up there, 

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:43.900
which is like I only used it 2 to 3 times a year. 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.340
So I want to keep the one I used all the time accessible even though I'm splitting them up.

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.060
STEP#4: Store items where it's most convenient to where you're using them. 

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:54.100
I'll show you example.

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:58.260
For years I have all my glasses and mugs over here 

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:03.579
but our coffee pot and the tea pot are
over here. It took me awhile to figure out

00:02:03.579 --> 00:02:08.319
that maybe I should switch them. And now,
we have all our glasses and mugs over here

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:10.659
right by where our drinking things are.

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:19.820
STEP#5: STACK, stack, stack! Remove your lids and stack your items; your pans, your pots,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.220
your colander, your bowls so you'll get the
greatest amount of storage space.

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:30.080
Okay, so that was just the basics but if you just step back and think about how to strategize

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:35.600
what goes on your cabinets and shelves, you can really make this work space a lot more efficient for you.

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:39.580
And, get a lot more time to be doing the things you'd rather be doing.

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.100
