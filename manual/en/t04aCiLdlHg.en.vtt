00:00:00.539 --> 00:00:09.450
Okay, now, we are ready to learn the G seven
chord. There's a couple different ways to

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:13.790
play this one, but they're all going to be
related to the G major. So let's start with

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:21.140
the finger of the G major, third finger on
the low E string. Third fret, the G. Second

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:32.500
finger on B of A. D, G, open B. Your pinky
on the bottom, if you recall. Okay, one simple

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:38.110
way is, look at this G octave up here, well,
we want to play an F instead of that G, we

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:43.320
don't need that octave. So you can play it
like this. This is one way of playing it,

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:51.750
this is a way that's very convenient from
switching from C to the G seven or vice versa.

00:00:51.750 --> 00:01:00.440
However it gives you a tritone feel. A tritone
would be an example of the notes from B to

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:07.060
F that create some tensions. So what you might
want to do is double your D. You have an open

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:11.290
D, you can double the D with your pinky on
the third fret of the B string, get a little

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:20.790
more strength out of that. If you notice the
difference in sound, play them both, see which

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:30.650
one you prefer, then try switching from the
G seven, as a five-seven, to the C major chord.

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:36.030
So notice this is very simple, even if you
have the fourth finger. You move your third

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.650
and second finger down one, and your first
finger up. Abandon that fourth finger if it's

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:48.350
there, if it's not, it's even easier. But
this stretch can be difficult. You might find

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:55.020
yourself moving your wrists a little bit.
Try to keep your thumb steady, and good luck

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:56.630
playing the G seven chord.
