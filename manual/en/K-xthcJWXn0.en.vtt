00:00:00.268 --> 00:00:03.237
&lt;i&gt;and we wilI remain here&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;on the scene&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;as this alI unfolds.&lt;/i&gt;

00:00:03.304 --> 00:00:05.238
&lt;i&gt;That's the Iatest from here&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;in Iower Manhattan.&lt;/i&gt;

00:00:05.306 --> 00:00:08.036
&lt;i&gt;Reporting Iive,&lt;/i&gt;
&lt;i&gt;I'm Sandra Endo. Back to you.&lt;/i&gt;

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:11.043
VlKRAM: "Protect and serve"
my ass. Where's my turban?

00:00:11.578 --> 00:00:13.569
l'm not talking to anybody
without a turban.

00:00:13.647 --> 00:00:16.741
lt's part of my religion,
to cover my head in respect
to God. l'm a Sikh.

00:00:16.817 --> 00:00:18.114
MlTCHELL: Okay,
we'll find your turban.

00:00:18.185 --> 00:00:20.483
Not an Arab, by the way,
like your cops called me
outside.

00:00:20.554 --> 00:00:22.579
Now, no,
l don't think you heard that.

00:00:22.656 --> 00:00:24.988
There was a lot going on.
You were probably disoriented.

00:00:25.059 --> 00:00:27.027
l didn't hear that.
l heard what l heard.

00:00:27.094 --> 00:00:29.187
l'll give you
all the information you want.

00:00:29.263 --> 00:00:32.164
l don't need this.
l need my turban.
lt's part of my religion.

00:00:32.232 --> 00:00:34.291
We'll get you your turban.
We'll find it for you.

00:00:34.368 --> 00:00:36.802
No, no, no. Not "get me."
l want my turban now.

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:39.600
You just got to start
thinking about the people
inside the bank now.

00:00:39.673 --> 00:00:40.731
lt's a dangerous situation.

00:00:40.808 --> 00:00:43.276
You got to start telling us
about what's going on inside
the bank.

00:00:43.343 --> 00:00:45.777
We can talk about this later.
We'll get an officer
to come down.

00:00:45.846 --> 00:00:47.313
You can write a formal complaint.

00:00:47.381 --> 00:00:49.747
But for now,
we got to deal
with this situation.

00:00:49.817 --> 00:00:51.876
First you beat me,
and now you want my help.

00:00:51.952 --> 00:00:54.614
You need to start thinking
about your coworkers.

00:00:54.688 --> 00:00:58.249
l could apologize on behalf
of the NYPD, but that was
not us. We are detectives.

00:00:58.325 --> 00:01:00.384
We're gonna try
and find out...
What do you want to know?

00:01:00.461 --> 00:01:03.089
How many were there?
l think there were about four.

00:01:03.163 --> 00:01:06.929
How many hostages?
l don't know
how many hostages, 20, 30.

00:01:08.368 --> 00:01:12.327
l'm fucking tired
of this shit. What happened
to my fucking civil rights?

00:01:12.406 --> 00:01:15.273
Why can't l go anywhere
without being harassed?

00:01:15.342 --> 00:01:17.572
l get thrown out of a bank.
l'm a hostage. l get harassed.

00:01:17.644 --> 00:01:18.770
l go to the airport.

00:01:18.846 --> 00:01:21.644
l can't go through security
without a "random" selection.

00:01:21.715 --> 00:01:23.546
Fucking random, my ass.
l nearly lost my job...

00:01:23.617 --> 00:01:25.949
l bet you can get a cab, though.

00:01:26.887 --> 00:01:28.912
l guess that's one of the perks.

00:01:29.523 --> 00:01:31.514
Put the ice on your face.
