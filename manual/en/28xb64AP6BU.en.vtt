00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:04.640
G'day everyone.
My name is Daniel O'Grady and welcome to another

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:09.710
Wasabicars video.
And, guys. Check out this Mazda Roadster Coupe.

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:14.160
Oh, my lord.
This blew me away when I saw it. I mean, I

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.820
was not expecting it.
How could you expect it?

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.920
I'd actually never seen one before.
Bloody hell!

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.400
Just driving down the road, I was going to
visit a friend... somewhere.

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:32.480
Somewhere in Fukuoka, and I was driving down
the road minding my own business, and then

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:35.379
I saw it.
I almost had an accident.

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:38.960
Wow.
Actually, I had seen one once before, and

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:43.910
it was on the Automobile Otaku website.
Sorry, channel.

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:48.109
A fellow called Eric, he runs it.
We used to go to car shows together.

00:00:48.109 --> 00:00:53.589
So, he one day spotted one. Not this exact
one, but a different one, so there are two

00:00:53.589 --> 00:00:56.409
in Fukuoka.
But, what a surprise.

00:00:56.409 --> 00:01:03.409
Let me tell you a bit about these cars.
These were built from late-2003 to mid-2004,

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.830
and there were four variants.
There was the base model which had a 1.6l

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:13.160
engine, and there were 53 made.
The next one up was the Type E.

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:19.220
That had a 1.8l engine, automatic only, and
23 were made.

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:24.290
Then there was the Type S. This particular
one is a Type S.

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:29.110
It says so on that placard on the front windshield.
That's how I know that.

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:34.620
And, it has a 1.8l engine, 6-speed manual,
it's the sports model.

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:41.620
So, Type S for sports; Bilstein shocks, front
strut tower brace, and it was only available

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:49.670
in three colours; red, white and silver.
Of the Type S's, only 63 were made. So, this

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:56.700
is a 1 of 63.
Actually, in all how many were made?

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:02.560
Just give me a second, guys.
179 of these Mazda Roadster Coupes...

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.720
Did I say that right?
... Mazda Roadster Coupes, were built.

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:12.549
1 of 63, and then 1 of 179 in total.
Wow.

00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:16.849
There was one other variant above this one.
It is the Type A.

00:02:16.849 --> 00:02:23.670
This one was a bit sportier.
It had the 1.8l engine, the same 6-speed gearbox,

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:30.280
same suspension but there was additional aero.
Front-bumper, fog lights.

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:35.040
And the rear, some other body-mods were done
in the back.

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:38.049
The colours for that one were red and yellow.
So, there you go.

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:40.829
40 were made of those.
Unbelievable.

00:02:40.829 --> 00:02:45.359
(weird noises)
Guys, when I saw this, it just surprised the

00:02:45.359 --> 00:02:48.540
hell out of me.
Okay, I'm going to go now.

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:53.139
Please, if you want to support Wasabicars,
buy a t-shirt.

00:02:53.139 --> 00:02:55.810
That'd be awesome.
Buy a hoodie, that'd be great.

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:58.859
But, I'm going to leave it there.
Thank you guys for joining me.

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:00.599
See you all later. Have yourselves a Merry
Christmas.

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:03.409
(But, I will be posting before Christmas anyway.)
Goodbye.
