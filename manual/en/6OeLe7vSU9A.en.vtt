00:00:03.719 --> 00:00:10.719
Welcome viewers. Today, you will be watching
a Let's Play of Sim City 2000. This is a really

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:18.980
old game. Um... I tried playing a different
game today, that I wanted to Let's Play, but

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:27.239
it was too tough on my processer to run CamStudio,
which is crap by the way, buy Fraps if you

00:00:27.239 --> 00:00:32.040
have the money, and um, also play the game
at the same time. So instead I've decided

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:35.060
to do something a little, um... Easier on
my computer. So I can actually give you an

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:41.340
entertaining performance. Um... *Cough cough*
If you don't know how to play Sim City 2000,

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:48.340
or if you've never seen this game before,
I'll be explaining things as I go, trying

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:53.300
to be as entertaining as possible.

00:00:53.300 --> 00:01:00.300
So the first thing you're gonna want to do
is edit a new map. And of course it will tell

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:08.080
you that it's reticulating the splines. That's
not true... but the people thought that sounded

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:16.290
good. So anyways, um, this is your map that
you'll be making and you've got all kinds

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:22.140
of tools that will help you shape the terrain.
You've got these sliders to determine, um,

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:29.140
mountains, how much water there is... You
know, if you want a lot of water... *laugh*

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:36.290
Oops. Um, you know, tree cover. So let's get
something a little moderate. You can make

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:46.070
it a coastal city. You can make it a river
city. You can do both... or neither. Let's

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:55.190
go with river. And... we don't want too many
hills, but we don't want it to be flat, in

00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:03.030
case any tornados come to get us. And uh,
mostly what you want to is just, um... Mostly

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:08.670
what you want to do is keep generating terrain
until you find something you like. So... fewer

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:08.920
trees...

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:15.729
Ok. Uh, we're gonna start with this. And then
you've got these tools down here. This is

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:28.180
one's, you know, raise terrain, and this is
to lower it... This lets you raise one point

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:34.410
at a time, and lower it back down... This
is the evening tool where you grab a certain

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:41.410
elevation of terrain and drag it around and
you can set all the terrain to that elevation...

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:49.620
So let's get rid of some of this water. *Humming*
This game has great music, especially for

00:02:53.319 --> 00:03:00.319
its time... *Humming* I wish you could hear
this. can you hear this? Tell me in the video

00:03:06.349 --> 00:03:13.349
comments. Um, cause it is... some awesome
music. Oh... this could take awhile. So, I'm

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:25.370
gonna go ahead and fix up this map. And when
we're ready we'll go on to the next step.

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:26.670
So, be back in a second.

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:33.670
Ok folks, weclome back. I've finished editing
the map using these tools at my disposal.

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:40.989
Um, like... Lowering and raising the water
level, and placing water... placing trees...

00:03:47.379 --> 00:03:54.379
zooming around, using the zoom tool. Oh. That
made a mess. That's odd... Uh... Ok folks,

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:32.440
I just ruined this map. So... What are we
gonna do? ... *sigh*, Give me a minute to

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:35.669
fix it.

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:42.669
Ok. I think I got this now. Let's not waste
any time, or else I'll probably you know,

00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:46.139
I might crash my computer next time I try
to fix something.

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:48.370
Ok, now that you're done editing your map,
that everything's pretty, everything's the

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:55.120
way you want it, you're gonna wanna hit done.
And that'll bring you to the actual city part

00:04:55.120 --> 00:05:00.540
of the game. This is where you're gonna wanna
name your city, select your difficulty, and

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:07.540
the year you start it. So let's call this
city... Pittsburgh! No... Gurkenville. No...

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:20.800
We'll just go with Johnville. Pretty basic
name. The difficulty, easy, medium, hard.

00:05:34.210 --> 00:05:41.080
Um, Easy starts you off the game with $20,000
to start building. Medium gives you $10,000.

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:48.080
Hard gives you $10,000, but it's a loan. So
you'll have to pay it back These; this is

00:05:48.669 --> 00:05:54.949
your money. Hard, this is a loan, it's a bond.
So you'll have to pay that back at some point.

00:05:54.949 --> 00:06:01.949
The year dictates how much technology you
have. Um, back in 1900, you know you're not

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:08.639
gonna have subway stations or airports and
stuff. But that's usually where I like to

00:06:08.639 --> 00:06:15.639
start cause we can work up to stuff like that.
So, Johnville, with lots of money, in 1900.

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:23.180
And, you'll get this newspaper here. It's
basically just a bunch of articles that kinda...

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:34.030
are randomly generated. Sometimes it'll tell
about events that actually happened, other

00:06:34.030 --> 00:06:37.889
times it's just be people complaining about
the traffic in the town that doesn't exist

00:06:37.889 --> 00:06:39.570
yet.

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:45.050
So, in the next video, I will show you what
all of this does, you know, how it affects

00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:52.050
how you'll build your city... And we will
begin development in Johnville. Until next

00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:53.710
time.
