00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.500
last poll anew poll finds that the tea
party is the political group that is

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.899
anti-gay back the mod by the biggest
margin margin

00:00:07.899 --> 00:00:11.570
this is a great analysis by david but
that's over at the new civil rights

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:12.339
movement

00:00:12.339 --> 00:00:17.060
as it turns out the tea party is against
homosexuality the most this is a new

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:20.800
poll that was released by the washington
post and members of the tea party have

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.789
the lowest level of support

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:24.539
for same sex marriage

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:28.349
by a huge margin overall fifty three
percent of adults believe

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.539
same sex marriage should be real

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.550
democrats sixty eight percent

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.240
independence fifty-seven percent
republicans thirty percent

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:38.710
tea party six percent

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:42.260
six percent of tea party members say
they support same-sex marriage no other

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:47.280
group was even close and what's shocking
is that even republican religious values

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.180
voters self-identified lewis

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:54.010
eleven percent believed that same sex
marriage should will be should be legal

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:57.170
why is the so shocking was particularly
shocking

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:01.450
because the tea party since its
inception has claimed they're only

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:03.850
concerns are smaller government

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:05.210
and lower taxes

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:10.000
this is yet more evidence that wait a
second this is a group with the lowest

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.159
acceptance of same sex marriage

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:14.270
i thought the big concern was small
government

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:17.790
yeah another government legislating that
gay people shouldn't get married

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:20.079
well the thing is for the readers but
uh...

00:01:20.079 --> 00:01:23.520
produced by the tea party that may be
true pretty bolded might have an i_q_

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:29.119
over eighty who are actually politicians
working in government yeah at those are

00:01:29.119 --> 00:01:32.229
probably the real issue wet but for the
for the

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:35.900
thousands maybe tens of thousands maybe
more people who

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:38.070
claimed to be tea party years right

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.580
well order the really what was yeah

00:01:41.580 --> 00:01:44.960
religious extremists from better term
who who have just

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.819
social agendas there there's some
pay-back for tea party members the

00:01:48.819 --> 00:01:52.139
washington post poll also found that
forty seven percent of voters oppose the

00:01:52.139 --> 00:01:55.209
tea party itself so that's that's at
least something interested

00:01:55.209 --> 00:01:59.329
i'll take a break album liam news about
the whole chinese issue oca uh...

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:02.770
apparently according to what i found out
they are not the same thing

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:06.580
uh... there in the same family of plants
they can be used somewhat similarly but

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:10.390
they're not identical well as the
political parties anything worse

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:14.979
are you going to say that what you meant
was that they were in the same family

00:02:14.979 --> 00:02:16.640
no i thought

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.349
they were the same thing

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:20.800
i love being vindicated

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:21.769
but they are

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:24.699
very very similar uh... well the both
agree

00:02:24.699 --> 00:02:27.639
the very similar okay let's take a break
we'll be back with play more after this

00:02:27.639 --> 00:02:34.639

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:47.260
