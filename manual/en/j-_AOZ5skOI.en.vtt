00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:05.500
Proprietary is a synonym to bad. Proprietary
is non-standard and not open.

00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:09.790
That means, others cannot poke into the proprietary
stuff to make it better,

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:13.700
and the consumers are stuck with inferior
yet overpriced products.

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:18.280
Microsoft XBOX is a textbook example of proprietary
being bad: it uses

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:23.530
USB joysticks with non-standard shaped connectors,
it uses common dvds with

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:27.950
proprietary security sectors, it uses common
flash memory cards with

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:32.499
proprietary power specifications, it uses
common hard-drives with proprietary

00:00:32.499 --> 00:00:37.120
filesystems and non-standard plugs, and it
uses common USB drives limiting

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:42.649
them to 16Gbs. Needless to say, that official
XBOX hardware costs several

00:00:42.649 --> 00:00:46.890
times more than the average for the similar products.
You can get a terabyte

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.879
hard drive for the price of Microsoft 20 gigabyte
drive, and you can get

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.800
32 gigabyte flash card for the price of Microsoft's
16 megabytes memory card.

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:59.879
The problem is Microsoft did not develop any
hardware, they order standard

00:00:59.879 --> 00:01:03.350
and just change a few bytes in the firmware
and alter the shape of the

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:07.270
connectors, so it won't fit to standard ports
no more, and resell them to the

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:11.759
customers. Basically, it is the same equipment
available on the market much

00:01:11.759 --> 00:01:16.170
cheaper. That is called extortion, and that
is exactly the reason proprietary

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.460
stuff exists: to glue the customers to the
original supplier, depriving them

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.689
of choice.
There's is a way to spoil the feast for the

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:27.259
Microsoft, well, for a little bit
at least. Some time ago, Microsoft allowed

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:31.520
the users to store their data
on USB drives. Of course, there is a catch:

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:37.390
no matter how big the storage is,
you may use only 16gb of that. Want more?

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:41.149
Purchase the original MS HDD
for a skyrocket price.

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:46.130
Actually, you may use the external drive to
the full capacity with the XBOX360.

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:51.479
A quick disclaimer: no, the system will see
only 16gb, since increasing this

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:55.109
value just crashes the system. But will trick
the console to use the rest

00:01:55.109 --> 00:01:57.859
of the space.
To do that, connect your external drive to

00:01:57.859 --> 00:02:02.289
the XBOX and follow the options
menu item to prepare it for use with the console.

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:04.259
Then connect the drive
to your computer.

00:02:04.259 --> 00:02:09.970
What you'll see is a 16gb partition with only
one folder - XBOX360. If

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:13.459
you don't see the folder, enable hidden files
view in the Control Panel

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:18.620
Folder options. The folder contains at least
three Data files, together

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:23.909
they form the so-called FAT-X file system.
Now, copy this folder to your computer.

00:02:23.909 --> 00:02:28.040
Then, use a partitioning software to reformat
the drive. There's like a ton

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.700
of drive partitioning tools, I wouldn't give
instructions on using every

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:36.260
single one of them. But I would recommend
starting with GParted, which is free.

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.790
What you need to is delete all partitions
from the external drive and

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:44.569
create a single one for the whole space, and
format it to FAT32. You have to

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:48.379
do it in partitioning editor, since Windows
is bad at managing partitions on

00:02:48.379 --> 00:02:53.030
removable drives and it doesn't allow a FAT32
partition to exceed a couple

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:57.549
gigs. Partitioning editors have none of this
limitations, so use it to create

00:02:57.549 --> 00:03:04.080
a single FAT32 volume for the whole capacity.
Now, copy the XBOX360 folder to this drive.

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:08.750
And create multiple copies of it,
adding a digit to the end of the name. Basically,

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:13.110
we are filling the entire
drive capacity with 16gigabytes chunks.

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:16.560
With the USB drive attached, the console will
be using the folder named

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:22.379
XBOX360. So, by renaming the XBOX360 folder
to some other name, and removing

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:27.250
the end number of some other XBOX360 folder,
you will force XBOX to use this

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:31.730
folder. Yes, that is not very convenient and
you have to use a computer for that,

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:36.200
but this is the only way to use a standard
drive with XBOX to its full capacity.
