00:00:25.069 --> 00:00:27.660

yes that's clearly what i see and it's a very
powerful image and you can see why cc criticism

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:41.850
their other sketches where appeared as off
within earshot

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:46.860

a gun to queen elizabeth

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:47.920

uh... you know well subjects fighter

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:09.979
uh... my objection is irrelevant when it comes
to art

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:14.250
uh... this nothing you do about it art is
art as an artist in brazil he wants to draw

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.560
up we did it

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.150
it's like fox news show

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:22.230
now on inside people they wanna their first
on the right so that's here in the u_s_

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:26.300
but we got a first amendment here bailout
do whatever they want right now have their

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:30.680
public money in again understand this adress
of prejudice if it was an america s i don't

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:34.650
know what the rules are them from the laws
on the constitution is a puzzle but it was

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:35.610
here

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.470
that is city public money went to that

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:42.070
i'd be ours now from

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:45.800
if you are one side and you don't like the
guys that he put the guns to the head of our

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.170
agencies easy flip it

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.370
and take but if you put a gun to the head
of

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:55.880
oreilly grayson f_c_c_ justice you know

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.400
or martin luther king

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:03.230
and then does this look cool but it does look
cool looks violet looks ridiculous is powerful

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:04.920
i get it is an artist

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.779
blessed in many ways for a bit of private

00:02:06.779 --> 00:02:08.529
uh... museum

00:02:08.529 --> 00:02:12.459
to free country ross perot but his house a
free country danny's public taxpayer money

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:15.579
for i'm going home

00:02:15.579 --> 00:02:20.069
i can if you if they're if there is public
money uh... being used to be that create this

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:22.219
art or featured this art

00:02:22.219 --> 00:02:23.900
that yeah i'm against that as well

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.510
but prob a lot of people are calling for a
pen on the side

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.859
are and they want a sensor basically they
now have an honest and i'm not in favor of

00:02:31.859 --> 00:02:33.749
that you there regardless of how

00:02:33.749 --> 00:02:38.799
powerful and offensive those images are however
reiterate i don't know what's in brazil so

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:39.969
i would just having it

00:02:39.969 --> 00:02:43.060
that a hypothetical conversation here and
that's all you would

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:48.159
rizal should do according to its own that
strictures now but i'm saying from my perspective

00:02:48.159 --> 00:02:51.609
i don't believe it's us ship no matter how
much i'm offended by it

00:02:51.609 --> 00:02:54.869
that's not it's not my place the judge

00:02:54.869 --> 00:02:58.289
but if i'm offended by some of it turns out
to be genius

00:02:58.289 --> 00:02:59.739
entirely possible

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:01.789
i'm not the judge of it

00:03:01.789 --> 00:03:06.489
arms it could be judge enough to to snow that
i want to speculate on it right

00:03:06.489 --> 00:03:08.589
but outside of that

00:03:08.589 --> 00:03:10.589
so free world opens the free world

00:03:10.589 --> 00:03:11.729
as always will push for
