00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.818
I got a question for you.

00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:03.098
What was the last wedding you went to?

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:05.020
Did you dance at that wedding?

00:00:05.056 --> 00:00:06.976
If you didn't dance, why not?

00:00:06.976 --> 00:00:09.435
See I used to be one of those guys who was too cool to dance.

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:10.940
Maybe you know some of those yourself.

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:13.560
Like your dad, or your brother, or maybe...

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:14.140
You?

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:18.650
You know we kind of stand on the side line, clinging to our drink, like it is a life preserver.

00:00:18.703 --> 00:00:20.363
And when the girls invites us to dance...

00:00:20.363 --> 00:00:22.283
No no no, go ahead and have fun!

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:23.880
I got my drink here.

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.420
So... I'm good.

00:00:25.509 --> 00:00:27.909
Do you want in on a little man secret?

00:00:27.909 --> 00:00:32.912
Those of us who don't dance, don't because we think we can't, or probably more accurately...

00:00:32.912 --> 00:00:35.049
Because we are afraid of looking stupid.

00:00:35.049 --> 00:00:36.963
And I definitively used to fall into that category.

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.420
But back then there was this one night

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:42.160
where I scored a date with Michelle.

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:44.900
And Michelle was way out of my league.

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:48.300
She was this crazy hot night club chick

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.360
You know there is always this one girl on the dance floor,

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:52.700
that attracts all the attention.

00:00:52.708 --> 00:00:54.549
Well, that was my date. He he.

00:00:56.484 --> 00:00:58.644
So as a result my self confidence started sky rocket.

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:00.117
My head started bobbing.

00:01:00.637 --> 00:01:02.383
My shoulders started swan.

00:01:02.383 --> 00:01:04.435
I started biting my bottom lip.

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:08.420
Before I knew it something rather profound happened.

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.640
I put my drink down.

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:13.100
Both hands were now free.

00:01:13.944 --> 00:01:15.904
I marched right out there to my girl.

00:01:15.904 --> 00:01:19.952
Made clear that all the dudes watching her that she was with Koval.

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:23.080
We both started dancing.

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:27.640
I remember it felt like the last sequence of some great dance movie.

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:32.633
But about 10 minutes later, she said something to me that I didn't quite catch.

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:35.520
What baby?

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.720
I said, your dancing like a duck.

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.600
Oh...

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:43.736
Oh.. ok.

00:01:43.736 --> 00:01:46.064
So much for the sky rocket of confidence.

00:01:50.328 --> 00:01:52.868
Yeah so she didn't stay with me for very long.

00:01:52.868 --> 00:01:54.848
Honestly though these days I really don't care.

00:01:55.173 --> 00:01:59.759
Now you guys just get out there and be goofy and be fun, and.. enjoy life.

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:02.035
So tell me, do you ever dance at weddings?

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:04.980
If not, why not? And don't try to make me feel bad and be like.

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:07.100
Well I'm in a wheelchair Matt, what do you think about that?

00:02:07.260 --> 00:02:09.320
Then get your butt out there and roll over peoples toes.

00:02:09.577 --> 00:02:10.513
I'm Matt Koval.

00:02:10.620 --> 00:02:11.840
Say hello June.

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:12.820
Hello!

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:13.720
Hello!

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.000
What a little baby!
