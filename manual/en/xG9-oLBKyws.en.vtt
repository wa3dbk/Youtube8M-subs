Hi Groovers, Chris here from www.MTBtips.com with my Top 4 Tips for riding down
comment on top for tips for writing down

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:07.009
stairs with more speed,

00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:11.330
ease and control.  Stairs are great fun, and the skills you learn here can be applied

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:13.850
to Mother Nature's stairs on the trails, too.

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:17.539
Click the link on screen or in the
description for the complete tips,

00:00:17.539 --> 00:00:18.109
including

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:22.849
the 'How to Ride Up Stairs' video.  Start
on just two or three steps, advancing to

00:00:22.849 --> 00:00:23.720
longer flights

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:26.960
as your skills and confidence improve.

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:30.679
Step 1. Look ahead to the stairs on approach,
then lead your bike down with

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:31.179
your eyes.

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:35.750
On short flights look ahead to the start, at the start quickly spot the bottom, 

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:38.780
then boost your eyes ahead to whatever's coming next.

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:43.949
Step 2. On approach: adjust to the speed you want to ride down, so that you start the stairs

00:00:43.949 --> 00:00:45.210
in total control.

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:49.199
About walking pace for beginners.  Too slow, and you'll bounce about.

00:00:49.199 --> 00:00:52.829
Too fast, and you'll lose control. On shorter stairs

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.190
aim to descend with just a little rear
brake, or none at all.

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:00.300
Feather both brakes on longer flights, or
flights with turns or landings

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.539
to control your momentum and traction.

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.200
Step 3. Approach the stairs in the Attack
Position, bent arms and legs, cranks

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.350
horizontal with your weight through the
pedals.

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:13.870
If you've got a dropper post, use it!   At the stairs, ease the bar forwards and shift your

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:15.260
Attack Position rearwards.

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.570
to keep your weight through the pedals.  Weighting your pedals

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.920
helps you descend in control with
relaxed, light hands

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:25.370
instead of leaning heavily on the bar.

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:28.650
Step 4. Maximize that control by relaxing your limbs even more.

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:32.620
Instead of resisting the shock with stiff
limbs, let them go a bit loose!

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:37.170
Let your body suspension absorb the
shock, so you can Float your head smoothly

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.300
and keep clear focus on your line.  1. Lead with your eyes.

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:45.580
2. Set your speed.  3. Attack Position - weight through the pedals.

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:50.910
4. Relax and Float your head.  Like and
