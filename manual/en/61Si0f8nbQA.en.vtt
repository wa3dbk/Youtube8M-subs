60g (½ cup) powdered sugar, sifted

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:05.300
2 tbsp water

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:07.500
Direction for the cream filling :

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:16.500
Put the milk, half the sugar and vanilla seeds along with the pod in a saucepan and heat over medium heat.

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:23.500
Beat the egg yolks with half the sugar in a large bowl.

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:28.000
Add the cornflour into the egg and sugar mixture.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Pour half of the hot milk over the egg mixture and whisk to combine

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
then pour this mixture back into the saucepan with the remaining milk 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
and whisk over medium heat until the cream is thick.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Spread the cream into a deep bottom dish

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:53.300
and cover with plastic wrap directly over the top of the cream to prevent skin forming.

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:57.500
Place the cream in the fridge and let it cool completely.

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:58.700
Direction for the pastry :

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:06.300
Place the milk, water, butter, salt and sugar in a saucepan over medium heat. 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:11.500
Stir until the butter is completely melted, making sure it doesn’t come to a boil. 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:23.000
Turn the heat up and bring to a boil then take the pan off the heat, add the flour and stir with a wooden spoon. 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:34.300
When the flour is completely mixed, put the saucepan back over medium heat and cook the dough for 1-2 minutes to dry out, stirring constantly.

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:38.000
The dough should no longer stick to the border of the pan.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:46.000
Transfer the dough in a large bowl and spread it over the borders of the bowl and let it cool for a bit for a minute.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:03:02.500
Add the eggs one by one into the dough and stir to combine.

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:11.000
Put the dough into a piping bag and pipe the eclairs on a baking tray lined with parchment paper. 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.200
They should be about 6 cm long and 2 cm wide.

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.700
Brush the top of the eclairs with the egg wash.

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:26.000
Bake the eclairs in a preheated oven at 190°C for 30 minutes.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.500
Direction for the chocolate icing :

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:32.500
Heat the chocolate over a bain-marie

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:38.500
Add the sugar and butter and stir until smooth. 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:46.000
Remove form the heat and add the water, little by little.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.500
Prepare the eclairs :

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:52.500
Make 2 small holes at the bottom of the eclairs using a nozzle.

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:59.200
Whisk the pastry cream a little then put it into a piping bag and fill the eclairs through the holes.

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:07.500
Dip the top of the eclairs into the chocolate icing and keep in the fridge until ready to serve.
