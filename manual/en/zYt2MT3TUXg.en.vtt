00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:24.490
In this video, I'm going 
to show you how to body surf.

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:30.510
So, it's a lot like surfing, in catching waves
and like, when you're on the body board or

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.030
a surf board catching waves, but obviously,
you go solo.

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:35.440
You've got no board.

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.690
You just, you know, you're going to put yourself
on the wave and the wave's going to carry

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:40.690
you to the shore.

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:46.110
So, first off, you're going to hit the surf,
paddle out, swim out, go as deep as you want,

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.110
okay.

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:50.000
A lot of body surfers, it is an actual sport.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:57.350
They actually wear body board flippers, which
helps them paddle into the waves but for the

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:01.280
purpose of just going out, having fun and
catching waves and body surfing them in.

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.950
I'm just going to show you quickly how to
do that.

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:09.569
So, jump in the sea, paddle out, get to just
about waist depth of water.

00:01:09.569 --> 00:01:14.619
So, for the purposes of this video, just pretend
I'm waist deep in water.

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:20.240
So, waves coming in behind me, once I pick
my wave, here it comes.

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:21.240
Here it comes.

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.930
I'm going to dive down, okay?

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:26.850
Dive down and you take your body as streamline
as you can.

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:27.999
Point your toes.

00:01:27.999 --> 00:01:29.159
Cup your hands.

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.700
Tuck your head in.

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.310
Kick as hard as you can.

00:01:32.310 --> 00:01:33.310
Kick.

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:34.310
Kick.

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:35.310
Kick.

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.310
Kick.

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:37.310
Head down.

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.539
As streamline as you can, once the wave's
got you, you can carry on kicking, okay?

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:44.030
Propel you toward the shore.

00:01:44.030 --> 00:02:00.170
So, that is, pretty much, how to body surf.
