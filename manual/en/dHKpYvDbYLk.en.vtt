Hi I'm Michelle and I'm here on behalf of
Expert Village. We are going to learn how

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:08.270
to knit a scarf for beginners and while we
are doing that we also go over some basic

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:12.300
tips that you need to know to get started
in knitting. Another stitch that I enjoy using

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:18.400
when I make scarfs is a basket weave stitch.
Now to do that stitch I simply do it in sets

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:23.320
of four. So I'm going to knit four and pearl
four, knit four and then pearl four and do

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:29.349
that all the way across. I'm going to do that
for about four rows and then I'm going to

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:33.790
switch it. So I would begin by pearling four
and then knitting four and the pearling four

00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:39.180
and then knitting four. What that is going
to lead us is a very nice pattern that actually

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:46.570
looks like the entire woven pieces of a basket.
Right now I just done three pearl stitches

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:55.540
so I'm going to do my forth pearl stitch and
then remembering that I must, when switching

00:00:55.540 --> 00:01:00.960
from knit to pearl move the yarn back to the
back of my piece before I start knitting.

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:17.670
I'm going to do four straight stitches.
And I have know come to the end of the row.

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:23.470
When I go to start again in order to get this
enter woven look to my pattern I'm going to

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:32.880
switch hands and rather then pearling here
is what I would do ordinarily I'm going to

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:39.830
come in from the front to the back with the
yarn held behind my work. I'm going to knit

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:51.310
four stitches.
After having completed this four knit stitches

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:56.049
because I have chosen to make a four by four
basket weave you can choose to make it larger

00:01:56.049 --> 00:02:02.010
or smaller depending on your personal preference.
I'm going to bring my yarn to the front again

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:15.890
so I can start to pearl and I'm going to pearl
over my stitches that right now are knit.

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:26.230
The pattern that this yields you can see look
like a basic with entire woven parts of the

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:26.680
fabric.
