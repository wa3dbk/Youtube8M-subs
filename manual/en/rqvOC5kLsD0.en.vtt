00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.309
Hey I'm Justin with AmericanMuscle.com, and
I'm here to break down the benefits of using

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:17.080
a Bama SF3/X3 flash tuner, loaded with 3 custom
Bama tunes, on your 2011 or newer Coyote Mustang.

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:21.880
If there's any one modification that is capable
of unlocking your car's true potential, this

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:27.650
is it, an SCT tuner loaded with 3 custom Bama
tunes, unleashes the power on your 2011 or

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:33.290
newer GT by optimizing your fuel ratio, your
spark timings, and your variable cam timing

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:37.320
while making adjustments to both your rev
and speed limiters, as well as any changes

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.400
to gears or tire size.

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:44.140
For the automatic cars you can expect increased
shift firmness as well as adjustable shift

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:45.140
points.

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:49.140
As well as that the SCT tuner can be used
as a diagnostic tool, allowing you to read

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:51.370
and clear check engine lights.

00:00:51.370 --> 00:00:56.460
What sets our tunes apart is what makes them
custom, our experienced Bama performance tuning

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:02.540
team asks you a series of 19 detailed questions
about your Mustang, and all of its modifications

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:07.490
and then creates three custom tunes, a street,
performance, and race tune, specifically for

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:08.490
your ride.

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.530
In addition, with Bama's free tunes for life,
as your modifications grow, Bama will create

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:18.690
a new set of custom tunes for each and every
modification, so you can get the most power

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:19.990
out of your setup.

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:24.640
If any reason you want to return your ride
to stock, it's a simple push of a button on

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:25.690
the tuner.

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:31.640
When you receive your package from us, you'll
find the SCT SF3 flash tuner, a USB cable

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:36.610
used to connect the programmer to your computer,
and finally this very cool personalized laser

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:37.610
etch plaque.

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:41.890
So how much power will a custom Bama tune
add to your 2011 and newer GT?

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:46.659
Well in order to find out, I need to grab
a quick baseline run using our automatic 2011

00:01:46.659 --> 00:01:54.600
GT behind me, just to see where the car stands
now, and then get to work installing our tune.

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.920
Uploading your custom Bama tune using the
SCT programmer is as easy as it gets, you'll

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:06.520
first want to plug the programmer into your
car's ODB2 port, and wait for it to power

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:07.530
on.

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:12.670
At this point go ahead and navigate to the
tune you wish to upload, select that, follow

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.939
the detailed instructions on the screen, and
you should be good to go.

00:02:15.939 --> 00:02:20.120
If you should run into any problems, or you
need some more detailed instructions on how

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.969
to upload your tune, we do have a video on
the site here where I walk you through this

00:02:24.969 --> 00:02:29.040
process step by step, from start to finish,
that should help you out.

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:34.200
With the tune uploaded, let's make another
pull here on the Dynojet and see what kind

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:37.090
of gains we're looking at.

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:44.560
Our baseline run with our automatic 2011 GT
gave us 336 horsepower and 302 ft/lbs of torque,

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:51.129
with our custom bama tune installed, we put
down 357 horsepower and 331 ft/lbs of torque

00:02:51.129 --> 00:02:56.430
making for a peak gain of 21 horsepower over
our baseline numbers, and gains of 29 horsepower

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.370
and 53 ft/lbs of torque throughout the curve.

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:03.510
Whether your Mustang's bone stock or heavily
modified, there's no denying the value of

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:08.379
a custom tune, it'll uncork the performance
and increase the drivability of an otherwise

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:13.069
stock car, and in the future as mods come,
it'll squeeze every ounce of power out of

00:03:13.069 --> 00:03:14.069
each bolt on.

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:19.849
So with that said, be sure to check out this
Bama SF3/X3 flash tuner loaded with 3 custom

00:03:19.849 --> 00:03:23.819
tunes for your 2011 GT right here at AmericanMuscle.com
