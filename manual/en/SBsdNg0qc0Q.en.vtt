00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:11.340
hello everyone Michael here with the daily
note 2 and 3 YouTube channel today want to

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:15.940
show you what used to be called pop up note
for the galaxy note 2 it has been changed

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:20.450
to action memo but it works just about the
same except it has gained some cool features

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:26.790
that I want to show you so I have default
settings still set all my device so when I

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:32.910
pull the pen out it unlocks the screen it
pops up this air command thing and I can access

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.730
the popup note which is now called action
memo or if you have S pen out you could just

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:44.320
double tap on
and there you go so he could write as usual

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:49.420
but I want to show you a couple differences
the eraser when you just click on the letter

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:53.250
it removes the whole letter and I think that's
really cool

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:59.130
I think that is an improvement another new
great addition is if you have notes that you

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:02.300
were working on before you don't have to write
a new one

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.580
You just hit that menu button and then he
could just continue on with the memo that

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:11.579
you had
save it

00:01:11.579 --> 00:01:15.470
but one thing it doesn't do a lot surprisingly
I'm going to bring a note up

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:21.110
I'm going to write something
It used to close and save when I used to insert

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:26.850
the S pen, it no longer does that
maybe it's a feature I can change but it doesn't

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:32.369
seem like it automatically saves which I thought
was a cool feature on the note 2 but it doesn't

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.229
do it here
so let me show you a couple of more things

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:41.920
here are some really cool ways to use pop-up
memo and I think it really make sense to use

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:47.030
it like this because you know a lot of times
you are taking down somebody's name and phone

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:52.250
number and you really don't have time to break
out that contact list, type in the number,

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:57.200
type in the name
you could just whip your S pen out and just

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:06.870
write the name and phone number so I will
write Jenny, the number is

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:14.340
okay so say that you wrote that
and you go to this button and you could call

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.170
her
it recognized the number and you could see

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:23.010
that there's this little post-it note thing
here when you hit that again your note is

00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:26.750
still there
let's check out our other options you could

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:31.940
add that to contacts I'm going to add that
to my device and what do you know it got the

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:36.620
name and it got the number which is really
cool

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:42.709
and let's continue
you could text message her and you could just

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:45.860
write out your messages hit send.

00:02:45.860 --> 00:03:00.070
That's a no-brainer if it does have an email
address my mike@mike.com see how it does with

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:09.430
that
Ok so it got the email address but I'll admit

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:14.860
I had to write the email I just a couple times
to show you this example because my handwriting

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:21.450
is not that great so make sure you write legibly
it can't work miracles especially if you can't

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:24.920
make out what you wrote previously.

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:29.441
And let's go to the next one say that you
wrote down a meeting place and you were in

00:03:29.441 --> 00:03:32.879
going to meet your friend but you don't exactly
know where it is

00:03:32.879 --> 00:03:50.390
it's In N Out, Hollywood
Let's see if it can find that

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:59.629
Oops I meant to go to maps but as you can
see it did manage to find the location

00:03:59.629 --> 00:04:04.709
and of course it found that there is the high
school here's Hollywood Boulevard

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:07.709
there we go.

00:04:07.709 --> 00:04:13.069
so it looks it found it with no problems so
I think there's a lot of potential here

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:18.269
so let's look at the last option we saw on
there which was make a task list so say that

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:23.740
you just remembered that almost 6 months ago
you filed a tax extension and you really to

00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:32.000
do it by October 15 well better write that
down and set an alarm on that baby

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:41.940
ok and then say you gotta pick up dry cleaning
and let's see how it does

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:53.370
yeah, I really like what Samsung did here
and don't look at it as something you write

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:59.009
and then you do, it's a really powerful way
to read your notes back and do something with

00:04:59.009 --> 00:05:03.300
it or to file them right
you can make a contact with them or you could

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:08.590
actually call them after you look at their
phone number that you've written and you don't

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:11.520
have to type it in you just let it do its
thing

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:14.669
wow
I think there are some really powerful uses

00:05:14.669 --> 00:05:18.360
here
I want to talk about one lasting say that

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:24.539
you're at your lockscreen here and you haven't
really done your unlock pattern to unlock

00:05:24.539 --> 00:05:29.289
your device and you've got what looks like
action memo open

00:05:29.289 --> 00:05:34.409
Well it looks a little different its missing
those cool features because you need unlocked

00:05:34.409 --> 00:05:40.919
your phone before you can access any those
features also to get a list of your notes

00:05:40.919 --> 00:05:46.430
that you've written previously it would have
to be the owner of this device to access that

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:53.279
information so it makes sense that you can't
access them at lockscreen

00:05:53.279 --> 00:06:00.849
you are limited to only writing notes
after you unlock it

00:06:00.849 --> 00:06:05.909
you can access action memo and then you can
do something about it

00:06:05.909 --> 00:06:13.439
so that's a brief look at action memo I think
you can briefly resize here

00:06:13.439 --> 00:06:17.550
you can't really resize it any bigger than
that

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:21.899
and then this little plus button it will save
it and it will create a new memo

00:06:21.899 --> 00:06:27.110
that's it for action memo I really love the
improvements and it is a welcome addition

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:31.679
to what we had on the note 2
so anyway if you haven't it's my channel yet,
