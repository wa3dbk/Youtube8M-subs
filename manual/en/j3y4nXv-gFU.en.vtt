00:00:00.919 --> 00:00:01.919
Hello everyone.

00:00:01.919 --> 00:00:04.440
Michael here with the Daily Note II/3 YouTube
channel.

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:09.650
Welcome to part 3 of What's New on Android
4.3 for the Samsung Galaxy Note 2.

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:13.480
Reading through all the comments, I do see
that most of you are saying you still haven't

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:14.480
got the update.

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:18.590
Well, just a stab in the dark, but it could
be that the updates are still being worked

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:19.590
on.

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.410
I personally had to reinstall about a dozen
apps after the update because the update process

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:29.130
didn't go smoothly, so hopefully by the time
you guys get it, the update process will be

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:30.130
trouble-free.

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:44.010
In the meantime, let's check out what new
changes you might see after you get the update.

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.010
But first.

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:46.899
I forgot to mention two things in the last
video.

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:51.910
One, I talked about how you got the updated
multi window feature with drag and drop features.

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:54.059
They've also changed how this works.

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:57.989
When you drag the middle bar all the way up,
it readjusts itself there.

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:01.800
But when you do it again, the app is fully
maximized.

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.800
I really like that because it is a lot more
intuitive than hitting this dot, making sure

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:10.660
you have the right window open, and hitting
expand.

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:14.780
And the second thing I forgot to mention when
talking about the new and improved stock browser

00:01:14.780 --> 00:01:17.829
is that the popup browser, is totally gone.

00:01:17.829 --> 00:01:21.719
I know some of you never used it, and some
of you loved it.

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:27.210
Well, good news is that someone has ported
the popup browser and it's super easy to install.

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.070
I'll provide a link in the comments on where
to download it.

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:34.219
It looks like the popup browser that you are
used to with some improvements.

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:39.549
Or you can go to the Google Play store and
search for popup browser, and find many alternatives

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:44.200
that are more featured, but maybe not as clean
looking.

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.630
So today, I wanted to show you a couple of
things and this is one of my favorite new

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:50.149
things about Android 4.3.

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:53.590
The two finger notification bar drag.

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:55.749
So this is one finger.

00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:57.210
Then two fingers.

00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:02.040
Once finger again, two fingers...

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:03.829
But did you know you can do this?

00:02:03.829 --> 00:02:08.729
Drag down with one finger, but as you're dragging,
you can touch the blue line, and this will

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:10.709
happen.

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:15.540
A little hidden animation to reveal the same
menu you see when you drag with two fingers.

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.739
What's it useful for?

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:22.849
Maybe, one finger drag to check notifications,
then do a touch to access all the toggles

00:02:22.849 --> 00:02:23.950
when necessary.

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:28.700
Or maybe you meant to drag with two fingers,
and instead of starting over, just simply

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.560
touch the blue line.

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:32.659
Onto the next thing.

00:02:32.659 --> 00:02:36.480
You can see the change on how the automatic
brightness is displayed.

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:41.010
I'm not sure if the code underneath it has
changed as well and if it is able to adjust

00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.349
the brightness automatically better than before.

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:48.709
I'm still just running the note 2 at full
manual brightness pretty much all the time

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:51.750
because the battery can handle it.

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.670
On a related note, let's go look at the Display
color settings.

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:57.220
Here's a shortcut to the display settings.

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:01.280
Just long tap on the screen rotation icon
to go to display settings.

00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:03.400
Let's go to screen mode.

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.930
You can see two changes here.

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:11.750
The adapt display, when enabled, says it will
change the color range for these apps as accurately

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:13.040
as possible.

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:17.799
I'm not sure if I like the limited support
for those apps listed, so I'll just keep that

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:18.980
off for now.

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:24.430
Photography being my main hobby, this new
option interests me quite a bit.

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:28.780
Professional photo, a title like that just
screams color accuracy.

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:31.880
The option in this same spot used to be called
Neutral.

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:37.510
I'm not 100% sure if the color has changed,
but I always thought Neutral looked very washed

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:42.690
out and that's why I never used that mode
even though the colors seemed a lot more accurate.

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:47.599
But now, it seems more saturated and I'm happy
leaving it at professional photo now.

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:50.470
Much better than Dynamic or standard in my
opinion.

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:56.099
As for color, accuracy, I wouldn't say you
can use the Note 2 now as a color calibration

00:03:56.099 --> 00:04:02.030
tool, but I do think the colors are a little
bit better, so it's a big improvement in my

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:03.030
book.

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:06.019
The rest I'll talk about today are just cosmetic
changes.

00:04:06.019 --> 00:04:11.079
The notification bar is a transparent gradient...Your
carrier logo may show up on the top left.

00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:12.079
At least it did for me.

00:04:12.079 --> 00:04:14.430
The smart stay eye icon is always there.

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:19.010
It just becomes highlight for a split second
while it's checking to see if you're there.

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:22.650
If you don't have Smart Stay enabled, I recommend
you use it.

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:24.620
It's a great feature.

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:29.950
Smart stay has changed slightly on how it
works on Android 4.3.

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:33.970
It used to be that, if it didn't see you for
the first time, it dims the screen and checks

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:38.780
to see if you're there again before turning
off the screen 5 seconds later.

00:04:38.780 --> 00:04:42.600
Now, once it goes dim, it does not check to
see if you're there.

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:46.360
You have to touch the screen in 5 seconds
before it turns off.

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:50.100
At first I didn't like this, but it makes
sense.

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:54.220
When you see it go dim, you normally would
just tap on the screen anyway.

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:58.290
And not wait around in front of the camera
for a few seconds to make it go brighter again.

00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:02.750
I think this will save some battery as well.

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:04.350
So that's it for today.

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:07.760
Hopefully everyone will get their updates
to 4.3 soon.

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:12.080
Just in case the update bugs are not addressed
before you get the update, I'll create a video

00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:16.970
to walk you through the possible problems
you may encounter during the upgrade and how

00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:17.990
to solve them.

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:23.980
It will definitely be beneficial when it comes
to not losing your save data for some apps.

00:05:23.980 --> 00:05:29.580
So stay tuned for episode 4 of what's new
on android 4.3 for the Galaxy Note 2.
