00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.690
I think we struggle with a healthy identity
because we’ve never been forced into the

00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:12.639
kind of agricultural realities that almost
every culture and cuisine has struggled with

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:14.230
over thousands of years.

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:16.620
They evolved out of hardship.

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:21.020
They evolved out of peasant agriculture and
they evolved out of this negotiation that

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:23.200
peasants were making with the landscape.

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:28.760
How can we get something to harvest out of
this soil, this landscape and how can we make

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:31.900
it nutritious and delicious for our family
and our community.

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:33.480
That’s the history of cuisine.

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.020
Actually the exception is America.

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:41.030
I mean we never were forced into that negotiation
because well we’re a young country and also

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:45.390
because when the settlers came over here they
came to the Garden of Eden.

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:51.360
I mean you drop a seed in the soil here and
then you have, you know, incredible harvests

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.360
anywhere.

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:53.360
You have rainfall.

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:54.360
You have temperate climates.

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.360
You have this unbelievable soil.

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:59.219
When you look at the history of this you start
to understand that our poor eating habits

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:06.340
in America, some of our health diet related
diseases and problems associated with poor

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:09.600
eating stem from just a history of poor eating.

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:15.280
The expression eating high on the hog is really
an American expression because it’s about

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:23.780
having the wealth, the agriculture wealth
to just eat the loin and the tenderloin of

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:29.950
an animal and to because of the abundance
be able to live off that.

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:30.950
And that’s not cuisine.

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:34.040
That’s, you know, if you look at any of
the great cuisines of the world they don’t

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:40.580
allow you to eat that seven ounce protein,
the steak or chicken breast or filet of fish

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:42.250
twice a day, seven days a week.

00:01:42.250 --> 00:01:44.570
That’s an American phenomenon.

00:01:44.570 --> 00:01:50.170
When you look at the cuisine, the Japanese
cuisine and you see, you know, a rice culture

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:55.030
well you also see that to get that rice they
needed buckwheat to grow the rice.

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:57.990
Buckwheat into rice was a famous rotation.

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.650
Well what did the Japanese do with the buckwheat?

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:05.159
In this country we feed the buckwheat – it
goes into dog food or it goes into bag feed

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:06.259
for chickens.

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:08.880
In Japan it becomes soba noodles, right.

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:15.700
And so to eat in Japan is to – it’s to
eat a lot of rice but it’s also to eat soba

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:16.700
noodles.

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.350
And that becomes inculcated into what it means
to be Japanese because it’s an agricultural

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:25.709
necessity and it becomes a gastronomic necessity
as well or a cultural necessity.

00:02:25.709 --> 00:02:28.890
Well we don’t have any of those kind of
negotiations in this country.

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:30.220
Every cuisine does, we don’t.

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:31.220
And so we’re the exception.

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:36.690
And what you learn from studying those other
cuisines is they have this advantage of history

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:41.030
that’s tethered to an agricultural reality
that we never faced.

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:46.910
The real advantage of American cuisine for
the future – because I think we will land

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:48.700
on a cuisine but it’s going to be hyper
regional.

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:52.300
It’s going to be you’re going to a certain
part of the United States and you’re going

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:55.100
to eat because diners are increasingly demanding
this.

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:57.560
They’re asking for what is special about
this place?

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.040
What is unique about this place?

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:05.670
And how can we through a plate of food or
through a meal experience what it is about

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:06.750
this region that’s so special.

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:09.040
And that’s where restaurants and chefs can
play, I think, a big role.
