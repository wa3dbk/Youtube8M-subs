Hi it's Jim at Atlantic British.

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:08.210
I take care of the technical support here.

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:13.020
The other day we had someone actually, I think
it came of one of the YouTube videos, has

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:15.580
a question about thermostats on the Disco
II.

00:00:15.580 --> 00:00:23.980
It is a reasonable simple operation, but we're
it is and what you kind of have to do to replace

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:25.750
t.

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:27.250
Here's a picture of the thermostat.

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:28.800
It sits in the car this way.

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.390
There are 2 hoses on the top, one on the bottom.

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:36.489
Now if you are going to replace it, you have
to get this top cover out of the way.

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:43.390
There's 4 screws, 2 up here.

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:46.070
There's another one straight down there.

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:59.629
And another one over here, which I all ready
took out.

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:03.430
Just do a quarter turn on them, they should
come loose.

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:07.690
Get your upper radiator hose out of the way.

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:13.070
Just lift it up out of there.

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:16.740
With that out of the way you should be able
to see where the thermostat is.

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.031
I'm going to turn my little extra light on
here so Cheryl can get it.

00:01:20.031 --> 00:01:21.840
It is right here.

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.670
You can see the 2 top hoses and the bottom
hose.

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.550
Really all you're going to have to do with
this is get a pair of pliers on this, take

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:32.439
the top hose off.

00:01:32.439 --> 00:01:34.539
Pair of pliers just squeeze these and get
that off.

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:39.210
When you get that you can kind of turn it
and do the same thing on the bottom.

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.789
Disco II there is no real radiator drain.

00:01:41.789 --> 00:01:46.040
This is the only way you are going to get
the coolant out of the system, so make sure

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:52.390
you have a pan on the ground underneath there
when you are taking the hose clamps off.

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:58.509
Once you get your new thermostat in there,
you put your cover back on, I don't really

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:01.390
need to do that now, it is simple.

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:05.939
The thing you need to remember, and I'm going
to highlight it again, here is the bleeder

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:07.470
for the cooling system.

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:15.300
Before you do anything take this out and then
slowly fill by the coolant tank over here,

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.930
until you can see some water coming out of
here.

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:21.360
Then you are just going to start it up and
let it run.

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:22.430
Heat it up.

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:23.850
Let the car cool down again.

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:27.780
Check the level, top it up as necessary.

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.250
Some people wonder what goes wrong with these.

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:37.820
Common thing is they stick open and you don't
have any temperature in the engine.

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:41.970
Once in a while they'll stick close, that's
not too often.

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:43.240
Sometimes they get air bound.

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:46.890
That will be if you have a leak somewhere
in the system and a little air got in there.

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:51.200
So if you fill it up and bleed the air out
you should be fine.

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:53.160
That's about it with the thermostat in this
car.

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.790
It is a very simple system.

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:07.020
You can get thermostats here at Atlantic British
at RoverParts.com or give us a call at 1-800-533-2210.

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:08.620
We carry this 2 ways.

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:14.880
This one in my hand is the genuine part straight
from Rover, or we have an aftermarket alternative.

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:16.990
You can buy that one.

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:20.340
Same part just not in a Rover box.

00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:22.020
Check out your thermostats.

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:23.010
You could have a problem there.
