00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.750
JOE WILES: Segment 2 of the "Santeria" by
Sublime, we're going to take a look at the

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:08.490
arpeggiated picking pattern and which strings
we pick when we play the four chords we just

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.360
reviewed in the last segment. Let's take a
look at the guitar. To review real quick,

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:19.600
we're using an E power chord, with these three
strings. Next one is a G sharp major, C sharp

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:27.220
minor, and a B major, okay? You have to remember
those as we continue. The first chord, you

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:42.049
have to pick like this. Watch my right hand.
Okay? That's the A string, D string, G string,

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:51.390
back to the D string, and then twice on the
A string, twice on the G string, D, A. Again,

00:00:51.390 --> 00:01:02.609
that's...okay? We go from the E power chord,
slide down to your G sharp major. It gets

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:12.859
picked like this. Watch my right hand. And
then we finish that riff off on the A string,

00:01:12.859 --> 00:01:20.350
2nd fret, the 4th fret, like that. Then we
transition from our G sharp major up to our

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:25.579
C sharp minor. Just move your little grouping
up, and this chord is picked like this. Pay

00:01:25.579 --> 00:01:39.710
attention to the right hand.
Again.

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:44.729
Then we transition from our C sharp minor,
slide up to the 7th fret to our B major. It's

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:57.329
picked like this. Pay attention to the right
hand. Nothing to it. Those four chords, in

00:01:57.329 --> 00:02:18.360
sequence, slowly sound like this.

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.990
Now, on a song like that, I don't want you
to feel like you have to play it exactly like

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:25.209
the original artist. You give it a free-flow
picking pattern, okay? So, if you're getting

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:29.620
hung up on which chords--or which strings,
rather, to pick with your right hand, don't

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:32.819
get so caught up in it. Just play the chords
and break 'em up, and make it sound good,

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:37.150
okay? In our next segment, we're going to
take a look at "Welcome Home (Sanitarium)"

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:38.640
by Metallica. I'll see you there.
