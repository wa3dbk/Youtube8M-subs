Two of the biggest fighting games are going
to

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:21.690
throw down in your living room now I know
what you're

00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:23.100
thinking but that's like

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.600
five months from now I know i know the
anticipation is killing me too

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:30.610
but I'm here to help you get through these
tough times

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:33.690

00:00:43.039 --> 00:00:44.629
Now we got two titans

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:47.960
crossing the line into enemy territory for
a dream match up

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:49.589
match up i'm talking Ryu

00:00:49.589 --> 00:00:52.460

King Abel yoshimitsu and plenty more to
be announced all in one game

00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:59.679
it's pretty sweet

00:00:59.679 --> 00:01:03.200
But of course not everyone is ready to cross
the line with a

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:06.810
handshake and a good game bro. Nope this is
without a doubt

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.909
an intense rivalry and players are taking
sides

00:01:09.909 --> 00:01:12.100
which brings us to a segment I like to
call

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:13.100
Cross Talk

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:18.729
This is a segment where we hear from you the
players.

00:01:18.729 --> 00:01:21.280
Do you have something to say? Well clearly

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:24.450
you gotta let us know. @ GameJay tweets

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:29.520
not to start nothing but if it wasn't for
projectiles, Tekken would destroy Street Fighter

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.590
Is that true Team Street Fighter?

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:34.229
Hadoukens and sonic booms are all you can
do?

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.079
Leave us a response and let us know

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:37.079
Fight back

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:39.979
And let's hear some smack talk from the other
side

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:43.030
Check out what YouTuber Zobe70 aka CoolNerdz
has to say.

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:44.030
Oh my God I can't

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.210
wait for for this game to come out.
I can't wait to test my hand with Street Fighter

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:49.509
and Tekken characters.
I'm not picking any of the Tekken characters

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:51.340
when that game comes out.

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:52.570
Bull crap

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:56.039
You will not see Zobe 70 picking any of the
Tekken characters right now.

00:01:56.039 --> 00:02:01.270
Ever since day one when Tekken came out and
plagued my life with this bull crappery.

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:03.820
I was like Tekken is the worst fighting game.

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:06.340
Tekken is a disgrace to all fighting games
right now.

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:11.319
Come on Tekken fans, are you gonna take that?
Defend your game!
