Hi my name is Don Dangler on behalf of expertvillage.com.
In this clip we are going to talk about blackjack

00:00:06.399 --> 00:00:12.910
and what it is. Blackjack is a casino game,
sometimes played at home or online, where

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:18.160
the house and the player are both attempting
to get the best possible score on there cards

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:27.420
up to 21. You might be asking how the cards
are valued. The numbered cards are value as

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:33.460
the number shown. The face cards are valued
for 10 each and Aces are worth either one

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:40.240
or 11 as needed. On the table the card are
dealt as follows. The dealer deals all player

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:46.530
cards face up; the dealer cards are dealt
face down. When all player cards are dealt,

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.750
the dealer will expose their top card. This
is the card that the player use to make their

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:57.011
decision. In this case, the player has a Jack
worth 10 and a 4 a total of 14. Player has

00:00:57.011 --> 00:01:02.949
decided to take another card a hit. He signals
by tapping the table. Here he gets a card.

00:01:02.949 --> 00:01:11.880
16 he decides that is not enough. He signals
for another hit. 21 player stands. The dealer

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:19.540
would then play their hand. Turn there card.
20 the player wins. Let's try another scenario.

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:34.369
In this situation the player has 14. the dealer
is showing a 5. now the player just hit a

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:40.090
14 to make a better hand, but in this case
the dealer has 5 showing; we know the dealer

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:47.469
must take a card. No card right here will
give the dealer 17 or more so he can stop.

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:56.229
So we won't take a card. Lets see what happens
to the dealer. 15 dealer breaks. Doesn't that

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:03.909
card look better here. Now lets look at another
situation. In this one the player has a Ace.

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:11.130
As you recall Aces can be other 1 or 11. So
this player who has the hand can be score

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:18.150
as 8 or 18. So if the player is playing 18
verses this dealers 8, according to the basic

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:24.101
strategy rules which are available in most
casino gift shops as well as on line, player

00:02:24.101 --> 00:02:33.120
should stand on this hand. 18, 18 it is a
push.
