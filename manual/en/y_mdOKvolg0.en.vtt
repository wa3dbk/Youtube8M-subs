00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.731
What's the deal with lithium-ion batteries and risk in planes?

00:00:02.731 --> 00:00:06.611
Lithium-ion batteries allow large 
amounts of energy to be squeezed into a

00:00:06.611 --> 00:00:12.651
very small volume. And they allow that 
energy to be extracted very fast. This

00:00:12.651 --> 00:00:16.521
is fantastic news for airlines
 where lighter planes reduce

00:00:16.521 --> 00:00:21.511
environmental impact and increase 
profits. But as Boeing are discovering in

00:00:21.511 --> 00:00:27.390
their 787 Dreamliner, these 
benefits are not risk-free.

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.320
To understand how lithium ion batteries 
potentially cause harm and how this

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:36.871
might be avoided, we really need to dig 
into the science behind the technology.

00:00:36.871 --> 00:00:43.361
We'll be doing this next week on Risk Bites. But for now, here are the risk highlights.

00:00:43.361 --> 00:00:47.370
The primary hazard in lithium-ion 
batteries is the electrolyte -

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.211
the stuff that the lithium ions move 
through when the battery is charged and discharged. 

00:00:52.211 --> 00:00:56.381
This often contains an organic solvent 
that is corrosive and flammable.

00:00:56.381 --> 00:01:00.491
Fine when it's sealed inside the battery. Not so fine if it gets out or gets

00:01:00.491 --> 00:01:02.681
hot - or both.

00:01:02.681 --> 00:01:06.891
Under the wrong conditions, this stuff 
can cause problems through corrosion,

00:01:06.891 --> 00:01:08.861
fire, and explosion.

00:01:08.861 --> 00:01:11.821
These are the associated risks.

00:01:11.821 --> 00:01:12.601
But what

00:01:12.601 --> 00:01:17.971
are the wrong conditions that 
transform this hazard into a risk?

00:01:17.971 --> 00:01:21.911
There are four things you can do to the 
lithium ion battery that transform its

00:01:21.911 --> 00:01:24.431
inherent hazard into a tangible risk:

00:01:24.431 --> 00:01:26.681
you can mechanically abuse it.

00:01:26.681 --> 00:01:28.701
You could short circuit it.

00:01:28.701 --> 00:01:31.841
You can over-charge it. Or you can 
heat it up.

00:01:31.841 --> 00:01:34.691
None of these are a good idea.

00:01:34.691 --> 00:01:38.711
Bashing the battery around, for instance,
 increases the chances of a breach in the

00:01:38.711 --> 00:01:43.521
casing, leading to a release of corrosive 
electrolyte. It could also lead to an

00:01:43.521 --> 00:01:45.801
internal short circuit.

00:01:45.801 --> 00:01:51.981
Short circuits in lithium-ion batteries - whether inside or outside - are bad news. They

00:01:51.981 --> 00:01:56.981
cause the battery to heat up fast as it
 discharges. And the hotter it gets, the

00:01:56.981 --> 00:01:59.371
faster it heats up.

00:01:59.371 --> 00:02:04.581
When this happens the electrolyte vaporizes, 
pressure builds up, and either flammable

00:02:04.581 --> 00:02:08.520
vapor is released, or the battery explodes.

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.410
And if your overheating battery is next to 
another one, the heat produced can possibly

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:15.190
start a knock-on reaction.

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:18.750
Internal short circuits can be caused by rough handling. But over-charging

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:20.930
can also cause problems

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:25.190
and turn a high-hazard but low-probability product into something you

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:29.610
probably don't want to hang around with for any length of time.

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:33.490
The good news is that a lot of
technology goes into making lithium-ion

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:37.560
batteries safe - and it's getting better all the time.

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.440
And even where the inherent hazard remains, it's getting increasingly

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.290
difficult to transform this into a 
significant risk.

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.070
But, as Boeing are finding out,

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:51.290
high-hazard technologies need to be
 handled carefully if they are to be used

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:53.361
successfully in low-risk

00:02:53.361 --> 00:02:56.130
products.

00:02:56.130 --> 00:03:00.350
Next week, Risk Bites will be delving deeper into the science behind lithium-ion battery hazards

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:03.450
and risks. So stay tuned, and stay safe.
