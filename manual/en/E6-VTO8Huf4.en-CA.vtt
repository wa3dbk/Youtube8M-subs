00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:03.950
[intro video]

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:09.520
&gt;&gt; ELLA: Hi guys. It’s Ella from MakeCheese.ca,
here to help you find your inner cheesemaker.

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:13.889
Today we are going to be making the famous,
the fabulous, the fantastic, the drum roll

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:14.889
[drum roll]

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:17.080
We’re going to make feta.

00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:24.150
I’m really excited. I want you to be ready
and all set, so a helpful list can be found

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:32.060
below. And also, to get everything you need,
check out the PDF recipe.

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:38.020
&gt;&gt; NARRATOR: Now that you’ve got the proper
equipment and milk, you can start making feta.

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:43.140
Begin by putting your heat on a low to medium
setting so that the milk heats up gradually.

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.110
I would recommend taking your milk out of
the fridge about 30 minutes before you begin

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:52.370
so the milk has a chance to warm up and doesn’t
get too shocked by the temperature change.

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:57.060
In this video, I will be making cow feta and
have purchased a higher fat milk - homogenized

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:02.260
3.25% - to get a better flavour and a higher
yield.

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:08.990
Next, you need to gradually heat up your milk
until it gets to 93 degrees fahrenheit or

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:18.889
33 degrees Celsius. This should take about
five minutes.

00:01:18.889 --> 00:01:24.549
Once your milk has achieved the desired temperature,
it is now ready to have the culture added.

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:29.219
You can put in a pinch or an eighth of a teaspoon.

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:36.420
The reason we add culture is to ripen the
milk, which in turn gives the feta its flavor.

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:42.430
Make sure to stir the culture in gently until
it has fully dissolved and is evenly distributed.

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:56.670
Next we’re going to add our calcium chloride.
Calcium chloride is a salt solution used to

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:02.669
restore calcium balance lost in the pasteurization
process when the milk is rapidly heated and

00:02:02.669 --> 00:02:03.669
cooled.

00:02:03.669 --> 00:02:10.210
We’re going to add a quarter a teaspoon
of calcium chloride to a quarter cup of non-chlorinated

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:16.930
water. Then we’re going to add it to our
milk, stir, and cover for an hour while the

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:27.860
culture and calcium chloride take effect.

00:02:27.860 --> 00:02:32.640
While you are waiting for the milk, it is
a good idea to prepare the rennet in advance.

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:39.510
Cut your tablet into four equal pieces along
the perforated line and add a quarter tablet

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:47.239
to a quarter cup of non-chlorinated water
and stir. Keep in mind it won’t fully dissolve.

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:54.780
It’s good idea to prepare your rennet early
so it has time to release its active ingredients.

00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:00.079
Rennet is an enzyme that essentially brings
the milk solids together to form a mass of

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:06.319
curd. And it, therefore, separates out the
liquid whey.

00:03:06.319 --> 00:03:11.129
Rennet is originally found in the lining of
a calf’s stomach, but the rennet we use

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:14.290
is a vegetable rennet.

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:18.360
As your adding your liquid rennet, you want
to make sure that you get all of the pieces

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:24.510
of the rennet out, so dip it back into the
milk and pour the leftover bits back in the

00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:26.489
milk.

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:32.520
You want to give it a good stir and then cover.
And after an hour, you’ll have found that

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:47.409
you have now made a curd mass.

00:03:47.409 --> 00:03:51.620
After an hour, you’ll find that your milk
has turned into one solid mass.

00:03:51.620 --> 00:04:06.709
Congratulations, you have just made curd.

00:04:06.709 --> 00:04:11.730
The next step is to cut the curd. Essentially,
we are cutting the curd so we can release

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:15.900
the whey and form an even stronger mass of
curd.

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:23.300
We want to cut the curd into a grid, and we
want to do this over a period of five minutes.

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:31.040
So, for example: you want to make a cut, wait
for 30 seconds, and then make another cut.

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:36.820
And this will just help to release the whey
from the curd mass.

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:49.310
Remember to make sure that your knife cuts
reach all the way to the bottom of the pot.

00:04:49.310 --> 00:05:11.190
Next, we’re going to prepare our cheese
mold. You want to make sure that you get a

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:15.380
bowl that’s big enough to catch all of the
whey that is going to drip from the curd and

00:05:15.380 --> 00:05:20.110
then line your cheese mold with cheese cloth.

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:24.430
You can make your cheese cloth as thick as
you like. And keep in mind that if you have

00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:30.180
a fairly weak curd, then you might want to
double up the cheese cloth so that it doesn’t

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:33.560
drip through.

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:38.050
Now we’re ready for stirring. We do this
because we want to release the whey from the

00:05:38.050 --> 00:05:40.680
curd.

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:45.180
You generally want to stir your curd for about
15 to 20 minutes. It really gives it a chance

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:50.310
to have the whey release from the curd and,
eventually, you want it to settle to the bottom

00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:56.590
of the pot, and you’ll see that the yellow
whey will rise to the top.

00:05:56.590 --> 00:06:07.591
As you can see, this is a fairly weak curd.
And if you wanted to make it stronger, you

00:06:07.591 --> 00:06:14.620
can put it back on a low temperature and stir
for about 5 minutes. And what it’s going

00:06:14.620 --> 00:06:25.970
to do is help the curd mass just to become
that much stronger.

00:06:25.970 --> 00:06:30.120
Now that your curd has settled to the bottom,
it’s ready to be scooped into the cheese

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:38.430
mold. This is going to allow all of the excess
whey to drain and essentially form your mass

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:41.710
of feta.

00:06:41.710 --> 00:06:46.070
Depending on the type of milk you use, especially
if you use goat’s milk, you might find that

00:06:46.070 --> 00:06:51.260
you have excess curd that won’t fit into
the cheese mold. Just wait a few minutes until

00:06:51.260 --> 00:07:00.370
all of the whey drains from the mold and then
put in the remaining cheese mold.

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:05.530
Once the curd has been fully transferred into
the mold, pile the cheese cloth on top of

00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:09.770
the cheese.

00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:15.280
The whey is now going to drain for the next
12 or 24 hours. I often like to put a bit

00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:19.530
of a weight on top of the cheese to help release
the whey more quickly.

00:07:19.530 --> 00:07:25.370
It’s also a good idea to flip the cheese
within the first 2 hours a few times to evenly

00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:31.330
distribute the whey being released.

00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:37.020
After about 18 hours, your cheese should be
a quite firm. If you desire a really dry feta,

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:40.610
then it would be a good idea to unwrap the
cheese from the cheese cloth and lay it out

00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:46.740
on a cutting board for an extra few hours
to dry out.

00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:52.750
Now that the cheese has reached its desired
firmness, it’s ready for cutting and salting.

00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:57.400
Sprinkle your cheese with coarse salt and
store in the fridge for a few days in a loosely

00:07:57.400 --> 00:07:59.550
covered container.

00:07:59.550 --> 00:08:04.200
If you desire a strong feta, then follow the
instructions on the recipe to make a brine.

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:07.820
Congratulations, you’ve just made feta.

00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:09.740
