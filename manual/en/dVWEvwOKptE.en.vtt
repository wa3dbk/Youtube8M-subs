00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.337
Not-so-random players, Standard Cordiform
Earth

00:00:00.337 --> 00:00:02.328
Washington gets his own landmass

00:00:02.328 --> 00:00:05.068
Writing was found in ruins - game over!

00:00:05.068 --> 00:00:06.668
But how did we get there?

00:00:06.668 --> 00:00:08.947
Archery researched, the city grows

00:00:08.947 --> 00:00:10.338
Settle as much as possible

00:00:10.338 --> 00:00:12.257
Down here is also ours

00:00:12.257 --> 00:00:13.878
King of America!

00:00:13.878 --> 00:00:15.308
New New York

00:00:15.308 --> 00:00:17.608
The Great Wall of the Andes

00:00:17.608 --> 00:00:20.898
Beantown to the west, if that is west on this
map

00:00:20.898 --> 00:00:23.278
Gotta get a Temple of Artemis

00:00:23.278 --> 00:00:25.378
As easy as said as done

00:00:25.378 --> 00:00:28.078
So settle more, need a Panama Canal

00:00:28.078 --> 00:00:30.578
More labour too - there's work to be done

00:00:30.578 --> 00:00:31.578
A man.

00:00:31.578 --> 00:00:32.578
A plan.

00:00:32.578 --> 00:00:33.578
A Canal.

00:00:33.578 --> 00:00:34.578
Philadelphia.

00:00:34.578 --> 00:00:35.848
Unhappy but workers are on it

00:00:35.848 --> 00:00:37.348
Bought some salt

00:00:37.348 --> 00:00:38.478
The Purple City

00:00:38.478 --> 00:00:41.378
North America is complete - sorry Canadians

00:00:41.378 --> 00:00:42.578
You can't live with us

00:00:42.578 --> 00:00:44.318
We've tamed the horses

00:00:44.318 --> 00:00:46.488
We've claimed the northses

00:00:46.488 --> 00:00:47.738
We're anchored

00:00:47.738 --> 00:00:48.997
We're not spicy yet

00:00:48.997 --> 00:00:54.348
Truffles, Gems, and Spice - Sugar if we're
lucky (we're not lucky)

00:00:54.348 --> 00:00:57.427
Even reached out for Sugar but it's still
a lost cause

00:00:57.427 --> 00:01:00.358
Engineering to boost border growth - What?

00:01:00.358 --> 00:01:03.318
Grew too fast - need insta-library for a National
College

00:01:03.318 --> 00:01:05.908
6 Turns until academia

00:01:05.908 --> 00:01:07.808
Send more settlers down south

00:01:07.808 --> 00:01:10.598
And maintain happiness with team sports

00:01:10.598 --> 00:01:12.428
Must become Chilean

00:01:12.428 --> 00:01:13.518
Hey look - Australia

00:01:13.518 --> 00:01:14.858
Bananas!

00:01:14.858 --> 00:01:16.208
Great.

00:01:16.208 --> 00:01:18.897
Ponder bananas.

00:01:18.897 --> 00:01:19.967
More minerals!

00:01:19.967 --> 00:01:21.758
And Uluru awaits

00:01:21.758 --> 00:01:24.708
Defend the cities before AI arrives

00:01:24.708 --> 00:01:26.698
Also make sure we're happy

00:01:26.698 --> 00:01:28.918
Can't look unhappy - we bought crabs

00:01:28.918 --> 00:01:30.908
Globe Theatrics

00:01:30.908 --> 00:01:32.808
South America is worked on

00:01:32.808 --> 00:01:34.397
Maybe feed Philly

00:01:34.397 --> 00:01:36.238
Castles in DC

00:01:36.238 --> 00:01:38.778
Liberty liberated - so free Great guy

00:01:38.778 --> 00:01:40.357
Why not Taj Mahal!

00:01:40.357 --> 00:01:42.528
East Australia is ours

00:01:42.528 --> 00:01:44.808
Not sure if we need west Australia

00:01:44.808 --> 00:01:46.528
East Australia is enough

00:01:46.528 --> 00:01:47.528
It is a neutral world

00:01:47.528 --> 00:01:50.228
I haven't left much America for anyone else

00:01:50.228 --> 00:01:52.318
AI borders trapped this dude

00:01:52.318 --> 00:01:56.018
Hey look - World's Fair stats, forget about
that Spearman

00:01:56.018 --> 00:01:57.308
Cool enough for school

00:01:57.308 --> 00:02:01.018
L.A. gets a harbor, San Francisco demands
a Circus

00:02:01.018 --> 00:02:03.168
Rome looks to get at silk

00:02:03.168 --> 00:02:05.428
America avoids disorder

00:02:05.428 --> 00:02:07.697
Teach San Francisco about books

00:02:07.697 --> 00:02:10.438
Ignore Elizabeth's Spice acquisition

00:02:10.438 --> 00:02:12.548
At least they aren't settling Australia

00:02:12.548 --> 00:02:16.278
Do I worry that Rome will use these cities
to pump out units?

00:02:16.278 --> 00:02:17.278
Yes.

00:02:17.278 --> 00:02:20.508
Seattle is protected, Chicago might need more
men

00:02:20.508 --> 00:02:23.667
Hydro plants - because rivers are useful

00:02:23.667 --> 00:02:24.807
Boston builds one too

00:02:24.807 --> 00:02:26.807
BOOM!

00:02:26.807 --> 00:02:30.238
Eventually Factories boost Science - thanks
Order

00:02:30.238 --> 00:02:33.518
Kremlin might complete, that'd be kinda neat

00:02:33.518 --> 00:02:35.118
Ignore Tourism - go for gold

00:02:35.118 --> 00:02:37.428
1870 - third place

00:02:37.428 --> 00:02:39.667
Enshrine the city of Brotherly Love

00:02:39.667 --> 00:02:41.798
Minutemen keep us in time

00:02:41.798 --> 00:02:44.197
Import the finest boats from Boston

00:02:44.197 --> 00:02:46.188
Buy a bunch of Temples

00:02:46.188 --> 00:02:47.288
You get a Temple

00:02:47.288 --> 00:02:48.998
And you get a Temple

00:02:48.998 --> 00:02:49.998
Temples for everyone!

00:02:49.998 --> 00:02:51.848
Now faith is insane!

00:02:51.848 --> 00:02:53.308
So insane we need Shrines

00:02:53.308 --> 00:02:54.848
Can't have a Temple without a Shrine

00:02:54.848 --> 00:02:56.428
Faith a bit better

00:02:56.428 --> 00:02:58.158
England is growing!

00:02:58.158 --> 00:03:00.568
It's appeared over in Australia too

00:03:00.568 --> 00:03:02.968
This is Arabian Indonesia

00:03:02.968 --> 00:03:04.388
This is just madness

00:03:04.388 --> 00:03:07.557
But Rutherford, we already know about atoms

00:03:07.557 --> 00:03:09.998
On the Seaport, is where I spent most of my
days

00:03:09.998 --> 00:03:11.578
Broadcast more

00:03:11.578 --> 00:03:14.087
Gotta tell the world about the Manhattan Project

00:03:14.087 --> 00:03:15.988
Science us through Ecological differences

00:03:15.988 --> 00:03:19.167
Made-in-USA Space Parts

00:03:19.167 --> 00:03:21.408
Engineer a holy manufactory

00:03:21.408 --> 00:03:24.158
Right here on that hill - no we don't want
your loom

00:03:24.158 --> 00:03:25.858
More friendly than neutral

00:03:25.858 --> 00:03:27.757
Oxford is a little late

00:03:27.757 --> 00:03:29.608
But it gives us instant-internet

00:03:29.608 --> 00:03:31.528
And cash gives bombs

00:03:31.528 --> 00:03:34.048
We could nuke the planet while blasting off

00:03:34.048 --> 00:03:36.428
Hotels for the astronauts' families

00:03:36.428 --> 00:03:39.568
Arabia is welcome in America, we're leaving
soon

00:03:39.568 --> 00:03:41.257
Just need three boosters

00:03:41.257 --> 00:03:44.018
And hospitals - in case people need treatment

00:03:44.018 --> 00:03:46.197
Excess happiness IS a thing

00:03:46.197 --> 00:03:48.738
No one wants the Australian outback

00:03:48.738 --> 00:03:50.628
Everyone wants robots

00:03:50.628 --> 00:03:52.848
Boston's booster makes its way to Washington

00:03:52.848 --> 00:03:55.748
Fusion means the robots get bigger and more
dangerous

00:03:55.748 --> 00:03:57.417
Space race is tense

00:03:57.417 --> 00:04:00.018
Ignore Tourism more!

00:04:00.018 --> 00:04:01.188
Engineer it!

00:04:01.188 --> 00:04:03.378
1982 and we're outta here

00:04:03.378 --> 00:04:04.897
Action shot!

00:04:04.897 --> 00:04:06.057
Appropriate!

00:04:06.057 --> 00:04:07.207
Cosmological!
