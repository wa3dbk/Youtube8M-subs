Hello everybody, my name is Daria. Today we will test a Strida bicycle with an installed electric motor.

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:21.680
The front brake is disabled, because it is replaced with the electric motor.

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:26.380
This is our electric gearbox, which we made in the previous video.

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:38.240
We decided not to install a motorcycle throttle, but to use a thumb throttle instead.

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:44.360
In our bag, we have a battery and a motor controller.

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.800
The power supply is a 24V Li-ion battery pack.

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:13.420
By changing a transmission ratio, we achieved a maximum speed of 25 km/h without the acceleration loss.

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:18.400
The energy consumption is 11 Wh/km.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.440
It means that even a 4A/h battery is sufficient for almost a 10-km ride.

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:29.600
And if youâ€™re simultaneously using pedals, the 4A/h battery will last for 15 km.
