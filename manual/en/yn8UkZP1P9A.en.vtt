Graham Spanier: I'm delighted to welcome all of you to Penn State this evening.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.333
[Applause]
[Cheering]

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.400
I met a lot of people, I met all of my floor mates.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.733
My boyfriend's still in prison.
I don't have a boyfriend.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Me either, don't worry about it, you don't need a boyfriend.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.866
This could be a fresh start.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.133
These students with cameras followed us from our freshman arrival for our first thirty days.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.466
Here's the story of our first thirty.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.066
I'm Ainsley, from Pennsylvania.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.200
Hey, I'm Bianca, rep Connecticut.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.333
Hi, I'm Lindsay, I'm from Ney York.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.266
I'm Alexandra from Maryland, whoo!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.800
My classes are all like, 8, 9, 10. 3 days a week.
Mine are all early too.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.733
My classes on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday are Theater, and that's it.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.333
This is the Thomas building, I've got two in here.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.666
I'm still anxious to start classes, and see how everything's gonna be.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.933
I'm hoping of course, to find out where my classes are and be comfortable.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.400
Most of my buildings are right around each other, Forum, Carnegie, it's pretty easy to find 'em.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.533
I'm really anxious to see if the classes are harder than I expected.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.133
I'm hoping they're not too hard.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.466
I think I'll be able to handle it, it's just if I get bored in some of my classes,

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
that's the only issue I think I'm gonna have.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.066
Hopefully I won't be worried about the workload, or you know, what's coming.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.266
Biology's a lot different, because it's in like, a lecture hall,

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.066
once a week, everybody goes to a two hour lab.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
My classes really made it like, all the better, I guess, 'cause I really enjoyed them all.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
I definitely feel a lot better, I feel a lot more confidant.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.466
Oh, look at these!
I know, I tried those on but they're not my size.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.666
The corner is like the popular place.
This is Allen street, right here.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
This is so cute

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.133
I'm done, I cannot buy anything.

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.800
We're crazy, we're having so much fun, this is like day two of our year.
