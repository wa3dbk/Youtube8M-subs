Hey DIYers, today on Make Your Mark with DecoArt, I finally get to experiment with freezer paper.

00:00:15.493 --> 00:00:18.914
You know that stuff you find at the supermarket to wrap frozen meat in?

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:22.080
Well apparently, it makes an awesome stencil.

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:27.735
We're also using Americana Multi-Surface Satin paints, because they're great on fabric.

00:00:27.735 --> 00:00:32.256
You guys are going to love this project. Are you ready? Here's what you'll need.

00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:01.339
I am actually going to wear this T-shirt, and I'm going to put the pillow on my bed.

00:04:01.339 --> 00:04:05.157
I hope you guys like this rocket ship T-shirt and pillow project.

00:04:05.157 --> 00:04:09.893
