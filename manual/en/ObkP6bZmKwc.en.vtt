00:00:01.074 --> 00:00:05.618
Now, backhand clear steps

00:00:05.618 --> 00:00:10.872
before I demonstrate the things has to be clear

00:00:10.872 --> 00:00:15.123
now, when shuttle has been hit to my backhand side

00:00:15.123 --> 00:00:17.723
every single shuttle cock is different

00:00:17.723 --> 00:00:21.856
height, length, speed is different

00:00:21.856 --> 00:00:25.873
there fore I have to have different steps

00:00:25.873 --> 00:00:30.704
different timing of steps each shot

00:00:30.704 --> 00:00:35.205
now, if shuttle goes high and deep

00:00:35.205 --> 00:00:37.556
I need more steps

00:00:37.556 --> 00:00:41.205
if shuttle goes flat fast, less steps

00:00:41.205 --> 00:00:45.274
much faster, much less steps

00:00:45.274 --> 00:00:49.607
but many players have one backhand step

00:00:49.607 --> 00:00:54.224
and then hit all different kinds of backhand clear

00:00:54.224 --> 00:00:54.872
watch this

00:00:56.307 --> 00:00:58.307
if shuttle goes high

00:00:58.307 --> 00:01:03.684
then at the beginning I have to do that small steps

00:01:04.872 --> 00:01:10.092
this small steps to adjust the different shuttle cocks

00:01:10.092 --> 00:01:14.892
so lets say shuttle goes high and watch my feet

00:01:25.373 --> 00:01:30.576
so because I do that I adjust the timing

00:01:30.576 --> 00:01:36.542
and when I found out, I move my right foot to the shuttle cock

00:01:36.542 --> 00:01:38.577
so, watch again

00:01:38.577 --> 00:01:40.376
shuttle is there

00:01:40.376 --> 00:01:41.011
do that

00:01:42.959 --> 00:01:45.977
if I don't do it, if I just go

00:01:45.977 --> 00:01:48.145
many players do, club players

00:01:48.145 --> 00:01:50.477
shuttle goes there, they go

00:01:51.493 --> 00:01:53.360
there is no timing

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.859
because I am too early I have to wait longer

00:01:55.859 --> 00:01:59.627
shuttle is high, I go already and wait

00:02:01.076 --> 00:02:02.776
but if I do the steps

00:02:06.513 --> 00:02:09.028
yeah, the timing is much better

00:02:09.028 --> 00:02:13.494
and its much more accurately your power can be used

00:02:13.494 --> 00:02:16.137
let's say shuttle goes faster

00:02:16.137 --> 00:02:19.104
then I don't have time to do two

00:02:19.104 --> 00:02:22.705
I may able to do only one if shuttle goes flatter

00:02:22.705 --> 00:02:23.456
watch my feet

00:02:29.572 --> 00:02:32.921
because shuttle goes faster I can't do that

00:02:33.738 --> 00:02:38.437
there fore I will look, see and then go

00:02:38.437 --> 00:02:40.389
but if shuttle cock goes very high

00:02:41.456 --> 00:02:42.071
very high

00:02:48.921 --> 00:02:51.673
you have to do small

00:02:51.673 --> 00:02:58.805
at the beginning small step, last big little bit slow step

00:02:58.805 --> 00:03:00.937
that's the way to create the power

00:03:00.937 --> 00:03:01.722
watch this

00:03:02.589 --> 00:03:03.956
small

00:03:03.956 --> 00:03:04.838
big

00:03:12.088 --> 00:03:13.055
little away

00:03:16.955 --> 00:03:19.323
not, just go

00:03:19.323 --> 00:03:24.141
many players when shuttle comes to the backhand side they panic

00:03:24.141 --> 00:03:25.642
they think they have to go now

00:03:25.642 --> 00:03:31.010
so shuttle goes they go like this squeezed

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:33.507
they have to hit the shuttle away from the body

00:03:34.425 --> 00:03:35.043
away

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:38.224
because its away

00:03:39.841 --> 00:03:42.557
I can use my power

00:03:42.557 --> 00:03:44.856
but, if I rush to the shuttle cock

00:03:46.975 --> 00:03:48.841
I can't use my power

00:03:48.841 --> 00:03:50.209
stay away

00:03:51.191 --> 00:03:51.923
stay away

00:03:53.625 --> 00:03:54.424
stay away

00:03:56.592 --> 00:03:58.924
make big final step

00:03:59.991 --> 00:04:04.257
do not go to the shuttle immediately like this

00:04:05.224 --> 00:04:06.574
don't go to the shuttle cock

00:04:08.773 --> 00:04:09.856
stay away

00:04:11.157 --> 00:04:14.842
and then big last step

00:04:14.842 --> 00:04:16.876
last one

00:04:16.876 --> 00:04:23.224
when you hit your right foot should land same time

00:04:23.224 --> 00:04:24.156
like this

00:04:27.408 --> 00:04:28.156
not

00:04:31.241 --> 00:04:32.773
no like that

00:04:32.773 --> 00:04:34.693
no power, no timing

00:04:34.693 --> 00:04:38.574
there is no time to do that and then hit

00:04:38.574 --> 00:04:42.891
because you are already late

00:04:42.891 --> 00:04:47.558
so hit, right foot lands same time

00:04:55.402 --> 00:04:55.868
like this
