00:00:00.236 --> 00:00:07.255
As you move on to the last third of the horse 
 then, you are going to evaluate the horses hip area.

00:00:07.255 --> 00:00:14.498
The horses hip area, for some people, is the 
 most difficult to evaluate because we don't have

00:00:14.498 --> 00:00:23.631
a simple ruler that we can lay out on this horses body to 
 determine if he has adequate length and depth to his hip.

00:00:23.631 --> 00:00:30.465
But the first thing that we would like to determine is 
 for a performance horse whether or not this horse

00:00:30.465 --> 00:00:37.320
has a square appearance in his hip. Now generally speaking what 
 I like to do is draw a line 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:43.143
right here from the top of this horses hip bone straight out 
 to his tail head drop my line straight down 

00:00:43.143 --> 00:00:45.687
and go across the front of this horses stifle. 

00:00:45.687 --> 00:00:53.905
And obviously when we look at horses we are never going 
 to see a perfect square filling in all of those.

00:00:53.905 --> 00:01:01.228
This horse here is a fairly good example of a horse 
 that shows some fullness in his hip and 

00:00:53.905 --> 00:01:01.228
This horse here is a fairly good example of a horse 
 that shows some fullness in his hip and 

00:01:01.228 --> 00:01:05.822
generally speaking what we would say has some fullness in 
 the lower third of his hip and has

00:01:05.822 --> 00:01:10.541
adequate length of his hip in comparison to the rest of his body.

00:01:10.541 --> 00:01:22.355
This horse, for our purposes today,we can certainly evaluate his 
 balance and say that he is adequately balanced.

00:01:22.355 --> 00:01:28.248
And we can have a pretty good idea of how this horse 
 should move out and track when we watch  him

00:01:28.248 --> 00:01:32.280
on the lunge line and we will get the ability 
 to see that here in a little bit. 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:38.115
The last thing I would like to talk about then in 
 terms of balance in using this horse as a model

00:01:38.115 --> 00:01:52.640
is the depth of his heart girth which is the 
 length form the withers to that horses elbow.

00:01:52.643 --> 00:02:02.860
We certainly would like to see the same or greater 
 length in this horses heartgirth than we would 

00:02:02.859 --> 00:02:08.400
from the point of the elbow to the ground. In this 
 animal as we stand back we can certainly see 

00:02:08.403 --> 00:02:14.040
that he's got an adequate depth of heart in 
 comparison from this point straight to the ground.

00:02:14.041 --> 00:02:19.580
The other thing that we can look at is that we would like 
 to see a difference or a tapering in that horses 

00:02:19.576 --> 00:02:25.040
underline as you move back. And as you evaluate that horses 
 depth of heart you can come back to 

00:02:25.036 --> 00:02:34.350
see, in this area, that we are still at a ratio of 
 a 2:1. This horse really does show a great depth of

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:42.680
heart and has a nice, strong tapering underline, along with 
 a strong topline and so he would be 

00:02:42.681 --> 00:02:46.840
considered a good model horse to evaluate in that area.

00:02:46.843 --> 00:02:52.350
Now we have another horse here that we are going to 
 talk a little bit about this horses balance 

00:02:52.353 --> 00:02:55.590
in comparison to the sorrel gelding that we just looked at.

00:02:55.589 --> 00:03:02.240
We just simply like to point out some differences in the horses, and 
 then like I said later we're going to talk about how 

00:03:02.241 --> 00:03:05.690
these two horses move in comparison.

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:11.620
We will again start off up here, in the front half 
 and evaluate the horse's neck. And certainly from 

00:03:11.625 --> 00:03:18.560
this horses mid-point of his wither to his poll and the underline 
 of this horses neck where he ties into the shoulder

00:03:18.558 --> 00:03:27.080
he certainly reaches our 2:1 ratio in that area. as 
 we move and we talk about his topline 

00:03:27.078 --> 00:03:32.570
while this horse is a little differently shaped than the gelding 
 that we just talked about, he is still 

00:03:32.574 --> 00:03:37.820
certainly balances out. So, it is one of those situations where you 
 want to be able to look at different horses 

00:03:37.825 --> 00:03:44.100
and use the same set of tools that you are given but 
 realize that not every horse  is going to fall under

00:03:44.103 --> 00:03:46.110
the same example.

00:03:46.104 --> 00:03:54.200
This horse, again if we measure from the mid-point of his wither 
 to the point of his loin and them measure his length

00:03:54.205 --> 00:04:02.430
of underline we still certainly see an adequate 
 ratio of 2:1 in that capacity. 

00:04:02.431 --> 00:04:07.950
The last thing then that we talk about with this horse is 
 this horse does show us a little bit different 

00:04:07.949 --> 00:04:16.330
makeup and shape to his hip, this horse is a 
 little bit longer across the length of his hip

00:04:16.329 --> 00:04:26.970
Both to the edge of his stifle, where his hip ties 
 into his gaskin and across the top of his croup.

00:04:26.969 --> 00:04:30.430
Potentially speaking whats going to end up happening 
 when these horses move and track 

00:04:30.426 --> 00:04:36.180
is we are going to see a horse here that 
 has the ability to drive forward through his hindquarters

00:04:36.185 --> 00:04:45.190
And to utilize his hindquarters to a better extent 
 than the sorrel gelding that we saw earlier.

00:04:45.189 --> 00:04:50.740
While this horse has a different appearing hip and we can 
 say that both horses are strong and certainly adequately balanced

00:04:50.740 --> 00:04:56.000
we'll be able to point out some differences 
 in how their balance effects their movement.
