Hi. I'm Karen for Expert Village. Now I'm
going to show you how to make a bridle for

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:12.889
our horse. You can use a variety of pretty
ribbons or straps. Anything you can find that

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:18.860
interests you. You can even take strips of
fabric if you want, to make this bridle. Now

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:25.860
you can do it with a ring or you don't need
the ring. If you want you can just take a

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:36.229
ribbon and put it around the nose like this.
And then take another ribbon that's going

00:00:36.229 --> 00:00:45.429
to go around the nose like that and just hand
stitch it in place. Okay? If you want to you

00:00:45.429 --> 00:00:53.670
can use a ring. This is how we'll do it. I'm
going to just take a piece of fabric and fold

00:00:53.670 --> 00:01:31.259
it over the side of the ring and I'm going
to sew that in place with a sewing machine.

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:41.860
Okay. And then you'll take the ribbon around
and cut it off where you have enough to overlap

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:53.299
it. It'll go like that. Now you can do it
with a ring on either side, too. I'm only

00:01:53.299 --> 00:02:02.479
doing a ring on one side. And then the other
piece will get sewn on the ring like this.

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:06.799
Again, I'm going to sew it with the sewing
machine first. Then I'll finish it with a

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:30.790
hand stitching. Just go back and forth to
secure that nice and tight. And trim off any

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:40.680
of the strings.
Okay. So we have one that goes up around the

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:54.930
top and one that goes around.
And the top one should come up. Just part

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:14.230
the mane a bit and have that go up over the
ears and underneath this one like so. And

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:22.150
then around and back around the ring. I'm
going to cut it just a little bit past the

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:35.230
ring so I can fold it over. Like that. And
then you just want to hand sew that in place.
