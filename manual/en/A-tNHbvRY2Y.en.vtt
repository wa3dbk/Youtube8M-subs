00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:09.229
Traditional Encaustic waxes create a soft hazy quality many artists have sought to replicate.

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:15.380
Encaustic painting requires a hot plate and a heat gun and needs to be done and specially prepared rigid supports.

00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:21.739
Let's take a look at real wax being applied so we can discover. What GOLDEN products are most similar to it.

00:00:22.409 --> 00:00:25.849
The closest GOLDEN product to this liquid wax is the Fluid Matte Medium,

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:34.099
It readily brushes and flows onto the panel and will level fairly well, but with some tool marks remaining upon drying.

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.349
Next up is GOLDEN Soft Gel Matte it is also easy to spread onto a surface,

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.629
but will retain more tool marks the edges round or soften as it dries.

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:48.229
Finally we apply the GOLDEN High Solid Gel Matte

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:52.849
it creates a lot of texture and is often applied with a palette knife instead of a paint brush.

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.858
Upon drying all three GOLDEN products have developed most of the visual qualities of wax.

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:03.980
Let's take a closer. Look at the wax surface.

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:11.690
The surface is satiny and the edges rounded off. The Fluid Matte Medium is level but retains some motion lines formed during application.

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:18.380
The Soft Gel Matte has developed distinct yet rounded edges from the knife.

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:24.649
The High Solid Gel still has about the same degree of texture created when applied.

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:31.309
Encaustic wax as a slight Amber tone to facilitate this we will add some paint to our mediums.

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:39.349
Into this puddle of Fluid Matte Medium we had just a couple of drops of Fluid Interference Gold (Fine) and Quinacridone

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.720
Nickel Azo Gold.

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:47.359
Artists have created many recipes to emulate the color of wax. This is just one of them.

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:52.759
For the next mixture we start with the same additions of paint into Soft Gel Matte,

00:01:54.799 --> 00:02:00.639
because this blend is probably much too strong for our needs, we'll take a small amount of it and add it into more gel.

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:08.259
This approach allows for more control of the color intensity. Which is very important when applying thicker layers of gel.

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:16.839
The extended mixture is let down once more to provide a greater range for us to work with.

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:24.489
The dry test cards give us a better idea of what to expect during use.
