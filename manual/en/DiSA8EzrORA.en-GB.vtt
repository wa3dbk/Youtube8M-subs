00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:05.259
If asked which is your favourite Elder Scrolls
game, Skyrim is the easy answer. It's polished,

00:00:05.259 --> 00:00:09.430
looks better and is more finely balanced than
the earlier games. It has a large and current

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:14.089
fanbase, whereas those who prefer Morrowind
or Oblivion tend to look like bitter, nostalgic

00:00:14.089 --> 00:00:16.350
losers who hate it just because it changes
things.

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:24.890
But it IS my favourite, and I don't want to
discuss its obvious strengths. Those are trumpeted

00:00:24.890 --> 00:00:29.380
enough already. I want to say why it's special
to ME, and even after hundreds of hours in

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:32.780
the earlier games, this one still stands out
as being the best.

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.590
Before its release, I didn't care much for
Skyrim. I excitedly watched the first trailer

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:41.530
minutes after its release, only to leave it
somewhat disappointed. Okay, it looked better

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:45.420
and had an interesting setting. But it was
still limited to current-gen technology and

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:49.930
would no doubt be hindered by it. We wouldn't
have hundreds of characters onscreen at once.

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:53.970
The polycount and texture detail would suffer.
And let's face it- the Elder Scrolls games

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:58.360
have never been about good gameplay.
Honestly, they haven't. If I wanted good swordfights,

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:04.910
I'd choose Dark Messiah. If I wanted graphics,
Crysis. For magic, Magicka. If I wanted an

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:08.470
RPG... um, actually I'd probably still go
for Final Fantasy 9.

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:12.901
However, The Elder Scrolls has been about
the bigger picture. About the freedom. What

00:01:12.901 --> 00:01:17.260
amazes me is how no other game offers the
sheer sandbox scale that the Elder Scrolls

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:21.570
can. I'd happily overlook its many imperfections
just because it's more ambitious than any

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:26.470
other game out there. It's effectively a continent
on a disk. I was astounded when Oblivion came

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:32.650
on a single DVD, and even more so with Skyrim.
A single disk, limited by current-gen technology.

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:36.420
Even when I finally got around to playing
the game it wasn't love at first sight. I

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.450
was disappointed by how dull and scripted
the intro was. Bethesda have always managed

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:44.810
to disappoint me with their intros. Minutes
later I questioned why I'd bother exploring

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.270
a world that looked to me as a God... but
slowly, it grew on me.

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:52.500
I watched the villagers amble about, carrying
out every-day activities. I harvested some

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.020
bushes, spoke to some guards and the opportunities
for mischief began to formulate in my mind.

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:01.680
And that's when I saw it- the mountain. I
wanted to climb it, and just like in real

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:05.770
life, the closer I got to it, the larger and
more impressive it became. As I rushed past

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:09.070
mountain goats and towards the snowy upper
regions I questioned how the game could even

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:12.540
simulate it so well... and then I got smashed
in by a troll.

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:17.030
I wasn't a God and this one annoying creature
was restricting a part of the world from me.

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:22.110
I'd show him! I rushed into a near-by cave,
only to get destroyed by a vampire. All of

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:26.770
a sudden, the world was growing around me.
I knew my place and I knew my foes. I understood

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:30.140
that one day, things would be different and
hoped that the whole world would be full of

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:34.210
as many little touches as my first hour had
been. It was.

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:38.320
I recall several hours later in the main city,
looking at the quests I had to do. They were

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:42.660
piling up in my inventory faster than I could
complete them. For every one I finished, several

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:46.550
more would take their place. I was overwhelmed
and almost wanted it to stop!

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:50.870
This continued, not just for the next few
hours, but for days and days. I remember I

00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:55.360
went to have tea half-way through Sheogorath's
quest, my head buzzing from the opportunities

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:59.790
and experiences I had encountered so far.
The game left its mark on me- the last 2 months

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:04.430
of 2011 for me will forever conjure up images
of the Northern lights, the sad Nordic chanting

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:09.160
and the beauty of Skyrim. I remember admiring
my magic professor as we embarked on a terrifying

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:12.930
quest into a tomb, aware that something bad
could happen at any second.

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:17.490
Despite completing hundreds of quests, I continued
to respect each one and they never ceased

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:22.150
to amaze me with their twists and turns. Tens
of hours after Oblivion was becoming repetitive,

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:26.120
Skyrim's world kept giving. The levelling
scaled just enough to keep me on my toes,

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:30.250
but would let me see my progress by challenging
me to fiercer looking creatures. It was kind

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:34.210
enough to chuck in the occasional, unfortunate
low-level bandit to show me how much of a

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:37.840
bad-ass my character had become.
Earlier games had relied on their scale to

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:42.260
compensate for sub-par gameplay, but Skyrim's
could stand on its own two feet. I've heard

00:03:42.260 --> 00:03:46.630
people moan about how it removes elements.
Really? Did you ENJOY jumping around the world

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:50.790
to level up your acrobatics, or continually
heal yourself to become a wizard? Skyrim's

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:55.060
world is harder to exploit and I didn't find
myself developing irritating tics to take

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:58.300
advantage of them. I played as I was meant
to!

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:03.380
Skyrim is a diverse and beautiful place. You
have forests, open plains, bubbling springs,

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:08.770
marshes, mountains, SNOW and grassy valleys.
Each area is memorable and unique and has

00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:13.040
helped me chart up a mental map of the world
that I could never do in Oblivion and Morrowind.

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:16.930
Although the earlier games had variety, it
either looked artificial or was too subtle

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:20.300
to make any difference.
And how about the tombs. These were the places

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:24.630
I'd avoid in Morrowind and Oblivion. I'd dread
entering them and would long to leave once

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:29.850
inside. Skyrim's are vast and varied and are
ingeniously designed. If you're in a massive

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:34.100
tomb and get to the end, there's almost always
a quick way out to avoid back-tracking. The

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:38.160
architecture, creatures and stories that exist
in these dark places help to add another side

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:42.700
to Skyrim. They don't feel tacked on, but
rather serve as another side to the game that's

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:46.050
just as well thought out and constructed as
the world above it.

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:50.150
The main storyline is a massive improvement
over previous games. In my opinion it's still

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:53.880
the weak-point of the game and after a while
the dragons become a flying joke, but honestly

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:59.290
I don't care. I enjoy staging battles between
villagers and a dragon, or guards and a giant.

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:03.550
Whilst in previous games, the creatures seemed
limited to a certain size, Skyrim isn't afraid

00:05:03.550 --> 00:05:07.500
of adding a sense of scale and progression
to your abilities. It's a small touch with

00:05:07.500 --> 00:05:10.750
big consequences.
I pity anybody who hasn't tried this game.

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:14.741
It's a game that has something for everyone,
and even if you only like 5% of what it has

00:05:14.741 --> 00:05:18.890
to offer it's still greater than most entire
other games. I've been quick to point out

00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:23.840
flaws to the previous games, but Skyrim isn't
so easy to criticise. I feel I've done everything

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:28.050
there is to the game, and yet one quick conversation
with my sister later reveals things that I've

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:32.520
missed, or different paths I could have taken.
I still play as my original character, the

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:37.389
fearless and mentally challenged Odgrub the
Basher. With him I conquered this harsh land.

00:05:37.389 --> 00:05:41.870
I remember gradually maxing out his abilities.
I treated the last unexplored regions of the

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:46.400
world with the same respect as a child with
their last unopened present on Christmas day,

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:49.889
knowing that it would be a long time before
such treats would come around again. The game

00:05:49.889 --> 00:05:54.419
to him is no longer a challenge, but a playground
to muck about on. I scale mountains for the

00:05:54.419 --> 00:05:59.300
fun of it and fill houses with cheese rolls
because I can. Some of the quests remain unfinished

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:03.180
because I attempted them before the patches
rolled out and these tease me to this day,

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:06.479
begging me to start the game again from scratch
to experience them the way they were meant

00:06:06.479 --> 00:06:09.331
to be played.
But I've grown too fond of Odgrub, and it's

00:06:09.331 --> 00:06:13.120
not an experience I'm going to throw aside
easily. No doubt he'll be the one who will

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:17.270
boldly venture first into the Elder Scrolls
6 for me. Our friendship may last for the

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:21.210
rest of my life and extend far beyond the
reaches of the world of Tamriel. Authors claim

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:26.240
that the characters they create take on personalities
of their own and Odgrub to me is no exception.

00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:30.320
He isn't just my eyes and ears in these games,
it's as though his personality takes over

00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:35.370
and I begin to play as him. I know it sounds
incredibly sad but... I don't care. My experiences

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:39.449
with him have been more exciting and memorable
than any in the multiplayer games that I've

00:06:39.449 --> 00:06:41.490
played.
I could happily jump in to this game again,

00:06:41.490 --> 00:06:45.870
were it not for the fear that it will swallow
up entire weeks of my life. When Deus Ex:

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:49.880
Human Revolution came out earlier that year
it was the best game I had ever played. I

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:53.680
didn't expect the experience to be trumped
so soon afterwards by Skyrim. I am almost

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:57.660
frustrated by it, since Skyrim doesn't need
any support and most definitely doesn't need

00:06:57.660 --> 00:07:01.430
me making a video trumpeting how amazing it
is. I don't need to convince any of you to

00:07:01.430 --> 00:07:04.580
play this game since you have most likely
already experienced it.

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:08.130
Although the tangible parts of this game are
great, the true importance of Skyrim are the

00:07:08.130 --> 00:07:12.580
personal experiences that you alone have encountered
thanks to its sandbox nature. I believe that

00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:15.510
when you search for videos such as the one
you're currently watching, you don't want

00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:19.070
to hear about what's so good about the game.
You want to hear WHY it's a good game and

00:07:19.070 --> 00:07:22.870
how it is worth more to you than the sum of
its parts may suggest and I'm afraid that

00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:26.770
you'll likely be left disappointed.
Nostalgia is a bitter-sweet and poetic fact

00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:31.729
of life and what's truly important about this
game to you may not be the same as for me.

00:07:31.729 --> 00:07:35.600
Words can't describe the importance of discovering
a certain quest, or of losing your dearest

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:39.919
Lydia in an accidental sword-blow. I too share
your frustration at being able to recall the

00:07:39.919 --> 00:07:44.320
best bits of this game, but being so unable
to convey them into words for others to appreciate.

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:49.070
It's one of the most lonely parts of life.
But I urge you to keep the screenshots, save

00:07:49.070 --> 00:07:53.130
games and favourite music tracks from it safe
in a folder somewhere, because in 10 years'

00:07:53.130 --> 00:07:57.180
time when new games have rendered this one
obsolete in all areas, you can go through

00:07:57.180 --> 00:08:00.630
those memories again and remember just how
special Skyrim was to you.

00:08:00.630 --> 00:08:04.580
You'll argue with fans of the newer games,
sharing your reasons for why Skyrim was better.

00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:08.680
They won't understand. And how can they? Their
memories will be with newer games that have

00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:12.210
built on Skyrim's strengths further. They
won't appreciate how without the earlier games,

00:08:12.210 --> 00:08:14.880
the ones that they're playing now wouldn't
be possible.

00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:18.699
You too can then become a bitter, nostalgic
loser who hates newer games just because they

00:08:18.699 --> 00:08:18.730
change things.
