00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:03.790
How do light bulbs work?

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:08.850
By any standard, the invention of the light
bulb was a real light bulb moment.

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:09.850
[Ping!]

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:13.610
And it didn't come a moment too soon.

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:18.619
Because although we'd known how to produce
electricity through chemical reaction since

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:24.820
1800, and how to generate it mechanically
since 1831, thanks to Michael Faraday, there

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:29.749
just weren't very many uses for the new force,
other than impressing other Victorian scientists

00:00:29.749 --> 00:00:32.200
by using it to make sparks and flashes.

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:37.500
Of course, the early electrical pioneers were
bright [geddit?] enough to realise you could

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:41.790
use an electrical current to make a wire glow
-- and if you made a thin enough piece of

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.740
wire with a high enough melting point then
it would glow white hot.

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:50.960
This is because, in pretty much the simplest
possible terms, the atoms in the metal release

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:56.380
some light photons when their electrons become
excited by the electrical current.

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:00.250
The problem with using these glowing wires
as a source of light became obvious after

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:01.990
a couple of minutes really.

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:07.370
Exposed to the oxygen in the air, they would
quickly oxidise and disintegrate.

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:12.900
The light bulb was the solution: a see-through
sleeve to protect the hot wire.

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.140
Like many good ideas, it had many fathers.

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:20.200
Indeed, the light bulb as we know it was invented
pretty much simultaneously on both sides of

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:27.180
the Atlantic in the 1870s, by Joseph Swan,
who was British, and by Thomas Edison, who

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:28.180
wasn't.

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:31.090
And the basic idea has barely changed since.

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:36.630
The light bulb is made out of very thin glass,
and contains a wire filament made from a metal

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:44.070
chosen to have a very high melting point -- usually
tungsten, wound around in a coil pattern.

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.320
Early light bulbs contained a partial vacuum,
the space around the filament was emptied

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:53.210
of most of the air, reducing the potential
for an oxidising reaction to take place.

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:58.270
More modern bulbs switched over to the use
of an inert gas (one that doesn't react with

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:01.020
the white hot element) for the same effect.

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:05.750
The result is a bulb that could provide up
to 1000 hours of light at the flick of a switch,

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.220
and sometimes considerably more.

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:13.761
One that was manufactured in 1883, just five
years after the light bulb was invented, is

00:02:13.761 --> 00:02:18.480
still in daily use in the UK, 130 years later.

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:23.690
America claims another light bulb that's been
switched on continuously for 109 years.

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:29.230
But for all its ubiquity, the light bulb isn't
what you'd call an advanced piece of kit.

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:33.590
Even its name is a bit of a misnomer -- we
should probably call it the heat bulb, as

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:38.480
over 90 per cent of the energy it consumes
is converted into heat.

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.880
Visible light is really just a by-product.

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:46.340
It's why old fashioned light bulbs get so
hot -- useful if you're making an incubation

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.410
cage for some chickens, or trying to heat
a student flat when your landlord has turned

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:51.630
the gas off.

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:53.580
But not really ideal.

00:02:53.580 --> 00:02:58.849
Which is why the humble light bulb has become
a threatened species in recent years.

00:02:58.849 --> 00:03:03.950
More modern compact fluorescent 'energy saving'
light bulbs are four times more efficient

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:08.319
for producing the same amount of light, and
the new generation of LED-based lights are

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:09.760
more frugal still.

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:15.770
The production and sale of the old incandescent
light bulb is now regulated in many countries,

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:20.400
with believers in the old ways having to buy
in stocks of bulbs for the future.

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.490
Like in the war.

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:26.390
And it's not just in homes and schools and
offices that the light bulb is running out

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:32.640
of time: Mercedes recently launched a new
car that doesn't have a single bulb in it,

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:37.950
every bit of illumination (including the headlights)
is done by LEDs.

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:42.890
That in fact was their big light bulb moment.

00:03:42.890 --> 00:03:45.990
Except obviously it was LED.

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:50.500
LED moment, sounds a bit feeble doesn't it.

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:54.970
What will cartoonists do if they can't draw
a glowing light bulb over a boffin's head

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:57.600
to indicate a good idea.

00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:06.209
LED moment, doesn't have quite the same ring
to it, does it?
