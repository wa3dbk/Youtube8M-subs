00:00:04.610 --> 00:00:09.729
we expect that in every situation there are going to
be a little pregame jitters and going to maybe

00:00:09.729 --> 00:00:12.759
feel a little excitement maybe even a little
nervousness

00:00:12.759 --> 00:00:14.879
your hands might be sweating when you get in there

00:00:14.879 --> 00:00:16.650
you might be thinking

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:18.699
I wonder what I am going to do after school

00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:23.029
or you might be thinking I hope I do really
well on this test

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:24.510
whatever your thinking

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:27.039
it's always normal

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:28.439
to just feel how you feel

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:33.079
you know it's totally expected that before
a person goes into a big game

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:35.870
they are going to feel a little nervous than when the game
starts

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:38.210
then those jitters tend to go away

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:40.420
and then you are just doing the thing okay

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:44.970
so that's what we're going to do were going to expect first of all that it if there jitters

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:45.950
there jitters

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:48.750
one thing you can do about that i'll tell
you right now

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:49.550
you can

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:51.080
stop

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:52.210
whatever you are doing 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:54.970
and just look around you a little bit

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:57.500
you can just look right even if you want to
do right now

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:00.200
look around and see what's see what's
around

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:01.190
are there other

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:03.110
of your friends around

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:04.570
teachers probably up there

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:07.630
you're seeing a video of me talking to you

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:09.140
what is around

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:15.920
take a second just check that out

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:21.060
you can do that during the test you know
as long as you are not looking at somebody else's test

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.390
so look around take a little break
 when you need it

00:01:23.390 --> 00:01:24.420
if you are 

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:28.010
a little like activated if your thinking oh man
I don't know what to do

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:29.200
and I stop

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:31.100
i look around for a second

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:37.140
when I do I see and I see out there
 I listen a little bit

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.780
an easier breath comes and then I start again

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.909
see it's not all one long thing

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:46.899
all of that test is broken down
into little pieces there's one question

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:48.709
there's one paragraph

00:01:48.709 --> 00:01:51.149
there's one word that there's one sentence

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:54.110
it's all just small moments

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:55.959
and we could take a break in the midst of
it

00:01:55.959 --> 00:02:00.110
that's one of your keys to being less nervous
and continuing on to

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:05.830
finish the whole thing

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:07.759
for every game that you play

00:02:07.759 --> 00:02:10.399
for every goal that you want to score

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:14.719
everybody practices a little bit here is something
you can do at home to practice

00:02:14.719 --> 00:02:19.239
this might sound a little funny it might sound
a little weird but i'd try it and then

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:20.790
see what works

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.859
so I take a pencil at home

00:02:22.859 --> 00:02:24.750
and I get a piece of paper

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.119
and I draw circles on it

00:02:27.119 --> 00:02:28.369
maybe ten circles

00:02:28.369 --> 00:02:29.859
and then I say

00:02:29.859 --> 00:02:31.819
to myself go

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:36.689
and then I fill in the first circle and then as soon as I
finished filling that circle I say

00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:38.019
yeah I did it

00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:39.480
and then they go to the next circle

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:42.379
I fill that in and I go yah I did it

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:44.840
you know what by the time you finish ten of
those

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.310
you will have told yourself ten times

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.009
yeah I did it and you did

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:53.619
it's a way of really supporting yourself you can
do that every time in the test if you want 

00:02:53.619 --> 00:02:55.260
every time the film a circle

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:56.319
yeah it did it

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:58.169
and by the time you get through

00:02:58.169 --> 00:03:00.279
you will finished and you will have done it

00:03:00.279 --> 00:03:02.590
I have been asked to say a little bit about

00:03:02.590 --> 00:03:05.540
how to feel powerful in this kind of situation

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:07.889
so let's take the worst-case scenario

00:03:07.889 --> 00:03:11.010
let's take the case of like getting into

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:12.299
the test

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:14.180
and being in your underwear

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:19.120
well no that's that's a really may be that's
too bad let's think of a different a scenario let's

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.649
think of a scenario we go in there

00:03:21.649 --> 00:03:23.230
and it's like oh

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:24.009
what's the answer

00:03:24.009 --> 00:03:25.359
I don't know what's going on

00:03:25.359 --> 00:03:27.199
I don't know what the answer is

00:03:27.199 --> 00:03:29.709
I am going to just stop

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:32.339
and then when I stop I think

00:03:32.339 --> 00:03:35.599
boy what i'd really like right now is too

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:37.599
have a piece of chewing gum

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:44.079
and so I imagine myself just for a moment

00:03:44.079 --> 00:03:46.589
having a piece of chewing gum

00:03:46.589 --> 00:03:49.849
it's pretty good grape my favorite kind

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:50.980
what I'm doing

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:54.949
is I am just imagining something different I am
taking another break

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:56.579
so one of the things that you can do

00:03:56.579 --> 00:03:58.010
to feel powerful

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:00.079
is to let yourself feel

00:04:00.079 --> 00:04:02.310
 not powerful at first

00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:06.460
I have all these thoughts I have all of these
ideas about how it's not gonna work

00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:08.089
I do that

00:04:08.089 --> 00:04:10.709
and then I say what do I want to do now

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:14.559
what I want to do now and it could be anything
it could be like go for a walk and I just

00:04:14.559 --> 00:04:15.530
in my mind

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:17.060
go for a second down

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.539
the stairs

00:04:17.539 --> 00:04:19.139
of the Front of the school

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:19.989
or I say umm

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:22.910
what I wanted to know is that I want to go to the lunchroom

00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:24.400
well maybe not the lunchroom

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:29.210
but in any case then I might want to go to my locker
and I might want to go out to the soccer field

00:04:29.210 --> 00:04:32.340
and for just a second if I'm feeling not powerful

00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:34.310
and let myself freak out and then I go

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:36.109
 where would I rather be

00:04:36.109 --> 00:04:38.990
and then I go in my mind just for a second

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:41.580
to where that is

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:42.680
now what that does

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:43.660
for your body

00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:48.659
is really different it actually changes the
chemistry in the brain the chemistry in the body

00:04:48.659 --> 00:04:50.729
and it gives you that shift

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:53.360
that can change everything in the moment and
then

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:54.339
coming back

00:04:54.339 --> 00:04:56.309
to my goal

00:04:56.309 --> 00:04:59.670
i am going to fill out more of these bubbles and I am going to be
more successful

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:06.670
and I am going to win at finishing this test

00:05:08.939 --> 00:05:11.449
there's a lot of emphasis put on these tests

00:05:11.449 --> 00:05:15.120
but you know what it's only a short amount
of time it's only a small amount of time in

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:19.029
the day that you can spend on this

00:05:19.029 --> 00:05:20.690
so when you get done with the thing

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:22.889
you've said all those times I've done it

00:05:22.889 --> 00:05:24.099
I did it 

00:05:24.099 --> 00:05:25.490
I was successful

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:28.179
and then when it's done as soon as you walk
out of the room

00:05:28.179 --> 00:05:32.629
I would just forget completely about it and just go about
your day you are free after that

00:05:32.629 --> 00:05:33.940
and just

00:05:33.940 --> 00:05:36.979
you can't just let it go at that point

00:05:36.979 --> 00:05:41.539
and just enjoy your whatever there is to enjoy you're
going to be going home you are going to be playing

00:05:41.539 --> 00:05:43.069
your going to be seeing your friends

00:05:43.069 --> 00:05:44.229
and I would

00:05:44.229 --> 00:05:46.349
even try to forget

00:05:46.349 --> 00:05:49.180
that another test may come up the next day

00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:50.550
and when you walk in

00:05:50.550 --> 00:05:51.690
then you are fresh

00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:53.239
it is like it is starting over

00:05:53.239 --> 00:05:54.490
cause really

00:05:54.490 --> 00:05:57.439
every moment is another moment start over right

00:05:57.439 --> 00:05:59.689
there's there's no present

00:05:59.689 --> 00:06:01.110
like this present

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:03.009
and your job in a way

00:06:03.009 --> 00:06:06.699
is just to let things happen in the moment right

00:06:06.699 --> 00:06:09.919
so when the test comes you there for that
when it's done it's done

00:06:09.919 --> 00:06:12.069
and you're on to the next thing right

00:06:12.069 --> 00:06:15.099
the reason that's so important is

00:06:15.099 --> 00:06:18.819
because this is a small small part of your
life right

00:06:18.819 --> 00:06:21.569
we believe in you as a person

00:06:21.569 --> 00:06:24.379
in who your dreams are and what your dreams are

00:06:24.379 --> 00:06:25.740
and your

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:27.150
steps for taking that

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:29.210
are many many steps

00:06:29.210 --> 00:06:31.650
so I hope you enjoy each of them

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:33.900
let go of the ones that haven't worked for
you

00:06:33.900 --> 00:06:37.260
and now just embrace the next one when you have
the possibility

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:39.080
of competing winning

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:46.080
and being the person you are
