00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:08.799
This video explains how to fix your printer if an Incompatible Cartridge , Cartridge problem,

00:00:08.799 --> 00:00:15.000
or Cartridge missing or damaged error message displays on your printer.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.210
The ink cartridges may not have full electrical contact with the printer. Removing and reinstalling

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:29.400
the cartridge might help. To remove the cartridges, first make sure

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:40.400
that the printer is turned on. Next, open the front access door of the printer.

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:45.910
The carriage moves to the dock on the right side of the printer.

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:51.350
Gently press the cartridge down. The cartridge releases, so you can remove it.

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:56.860
Be careful not to touch the copper-colored electrical contacts or ink nozzles. This can

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:01.449
cause clogs, ink failure, and poor electrical connections.

00:01:01.449 --> 00:01:07.290
Inspect the cartridge. Clear any protective tape that hasn’t been removed. Also check

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:10.820
the copper-colored electrical contacts for debris.

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:17.180
After inspecting the cartridge, place it back into the slot and gently but firmly push it

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:21.210
until it pops into place. Make sure that each cartridge is in the correct

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:25.470
slot. Tri-color on the left. Black on the right.

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:33.710
Once the cartridges are back in place, close the front access door. Check the printers

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:38.990
control panel to see if the error is still being displayed on the LCD. If there is no

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:44.850
longer an error being displayed, you do not need to continue troubleshooting. If the error

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:48.880
is still there, continue on until the next step.

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:53.610
There may be debris on the electrical contacts that can prevent the printer from recognizing

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:58.479
the cartridge. In this step, we will clean those contacts.

00:01:58.479 --> 00:02:01.729
Before you begin, gather the following cleaning materials:

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:05.830
• Clean, lint-free cloth • Clean cotton swabs

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:11.920
• Clean water to dampen the cloth. Distilled or bottled water is preferable but not required.

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:18.920
Do not use alcohol or other chemical cleaners. Open the front access door on the printer.

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:24.800
The carriage moves to the dock on the right side of the printer.

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:31.800
Gently press the cartridge down. The cartridge releases, so you can remove it.

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:39.220
Unplug the power cord from the back of the printer.

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:44.480
Clean the copper-colored electrical contacts on the cartridge. Make sure not to touch the

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:49.250
ink nozzles. Next, clean the carriage contacts inside of

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:53.930
the printer. Once the cartridges and the carriage contacts

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:59.739
inside of the printer have been clean, let both sit for 10 minutes to allow the cleaned

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:04.349
area to dry. After everything has dried, reinsert the cartridges

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:10.370
back into the carriage. Place them one at a time back into their respective slots and

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:16.090
gently but firmly push them until they pop into place

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:23.090
Plug the power cord back in. Close the front access door of the printer.

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:37.349
Turn the printer on. Try printing a self-test page to see if you

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:42.220
receive the message again. On the printer control panel, press the Setup

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:47.470
button. Scroll to Print Report and press the OK button.

00:03:47.470 --> 00:03:53.019
Then scroll to Self-Test Report and then press the OK button.

00:03:53.019 --> 00:03:57.939
If the page prints successful, you do not need to continue troubleshooting. If the page

00:03:57.939 --> 00:04:07.360
does not print, continue on to the next step. If you have completed the previous steps and

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:13.890
the issue continues, repeat steps one and two. Cleaning and reseating a second time

00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:17.859
may fix the issue. If cleaning the cartridges and the printer

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:23.620
contacts did not resolve the issue, replacing the problem cartridge may fix the issue.

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:28.290
Replace the cartridge by first opening the front access door on the printer.

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:32.110
The carriage moves to the dock on the right side of the printer.

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:37.389
Let the carriage settle into the dock, then gently press the cartridge down. The cartridge

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:44.389
releases, so you can remove it. Now, take the new cartridge out of its package.

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:55.100
Using the pink pull tab, carefully remove the protective tape.

00:04:55.100 --> 00:05:00.810
Be careful not to touch the copper-colored electrical contacts or ink nozzles. This can

00:05:00.810 --> 00:05:05.800
cause clogs, ink failure, and poor electrical connections

00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:12.039
Place the new cartridge into the slot and gently but firmly push it in until it pops

00:05:12.039 --> 00:05:14.919
into place. Make sure that each cartridge is in the correct

00:05:14.919 --> 00:05:19.100
slot. Tri-color on the left. Black on the right.

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:25.910
When the cartridges are in, close the front access panel on the printer…

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:35.020
An alignment page will print. Finish the alignment process by setting the

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:42.020
printed alignment sheet print side down on the scan bed

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.820
and pressing the OK button. If the alignment page prints are and you are

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:58.580
able to complete the alignment process, you are done troubleshooting. If the alignment

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:04.440
page does not print, and the error continues to persist, continue on the next step.

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:08.669
If you’ve tried everything described in this video and you still have a problem, your

00:06:08.669 --> 00:06:14.770
printer likely needs some type of service. Contact HP to find out what the support options

00:06:14.770 --> 00:06:19.750
are for your printer. Your options for service may vary depending on how long you’ve owned

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:26.750
the printer and what country you live in. To print in ink backup mode, first make sure

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:32.729
that the printer is turned on. If the printer is off, press the power button to turn on

00:06:32.729 --> 00:06:39.729
the printer. Open the front access door on the printer.

00:06:41.009 --> 00:06:46.440
Let the carriage settle into the dock, then gently press the cartridge down. The cartridge

00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:52.160
releases, so you can remove it. Only remove the cartridge that the control panel indicates

00:06:52.160 --> 00:07:03.099
has a problem. The control panel will indicate that one of

00:07:03.099 --> 00:07:12.099
the cartridges is not available for printing. Press the OK button to clear the message.

00:07:13.889 --> 00:07:19.090
With one of the cartridges removed the printouts will not look as expected. If the tri-color

00:07:19.090 --> 00:07:24.780
cartridge is removed, printouts will appear in grayscale. If the black cartridge is removed,

00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:29.150
the printer will print slowly and the printouts might not appear as expected.
