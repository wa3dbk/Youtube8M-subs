00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:25.740
Has it really come down to this?

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:31.259
The PS Vita, probably the most advanced single
piece of hardware and the only games we can

00:00:31.259 --> 00:00:34.710
look forward to are ports of mobile games.

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.190
That can drive someone insane.

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:43.140
At least if the Vita is going to become basically
a touch phone with analog sticks, the mobile

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:44.630
games are pretty solid.

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:50.200
Case and point, Nun Attack, which while being
a mobile game is still very entertaining and

00:00:50.200 --> 00:01:02.480
fun, and comes with a low price tag as well.

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:08.350
Nun Attack is a mix of touchscreen action
shooting with traces of strategy and RPG elements.

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:13.750
A bunch of demons are causing chaos, like
those pesky demons tend to do, and they can

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:17.140
only be stopped by a small group of holy sisters.

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:21.920
Apparently, when they are not smacking your
wrists with rulers in school, nuns are out

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.460
saving mankind from demons.

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:30.219
There are 4 different nuns, Eva, Rosy, Olga,
and Mandy to take into battle, each with their

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:32.770
own unique abilities and play style.

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:35.600
The levels start off like a strategy game.

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.170
There you have to carefully guide your nuns
across the battlefield.

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:43.649
While doing this, there are portals that will
launch flaming skulls at you, and you have

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:45.159
to deflect back.

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:49.910
After you navigate your way across to the
final portal, you enter into combat.

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:56.260
Here you individually move the nuns and attack
with handguns, assault rifles, and shotguns.

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.270
Everything is controlled by touch.

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:01.549
You tap to select the guns, and slide to move
them.

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:04.009
Tapping on an enemy will have the nun target
them.

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:09.840
The action becomes very chaotic, but the controls
work perfectly with the gameplay and never

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.010
leave you feeling overwhelmed.

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:16.450
Defeating enemies will cause them to drop
gold coins, which can be collected and used.

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:20.840
The coins can be used to purchase new weapons
and upgrade current ones.

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:25.980
The sisters themselves will earn XP and go
up in level, giving them more health and having

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:27.319
them do more damage.

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:30.510
But with the Vita release, there are some
new additions.

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:35.730
There are over 40 levels to play through and
plenty of hidden items and treasures to find.

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:41.150
Also the Vita gets rebalanced gameplay and
improved graphics, which completely justifies

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:53.550
a Vita purchase, right?

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:57.980
It looks like the major game releases on the
Vita are going to be few and far between,

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:01.909
and in meantime it will receive mobile games
like this.

00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:08.139
But thatâ€™s not all bad, if they are all
as entertaining as Nun Attack.
