Hi guys, its Cindy Lietz, your Polymer Clay
Tutor, and today's Studio Tip is making a

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:12.219
playing card thickness guide for your pasta
machine.

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:18.200
Now, a few…I don’t know, it was a year
ago or a little bit more, a bunch of the artists

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:24.280
kinda got together and talked about the fact
that all the different pasta machines that

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:29.330
are out there, every setting seems to be a
little bit different, and there needed to

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:34.140
be a bit of a standardization between everybody,
so that we knew what we are talking about,

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:39.960
because some machines…like in my case, this
one goes from number 1 setting all the way

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:47.630
down to a 9, and the 1 is the thickest, some
pasta machines it's the other way around;

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:53.450
the 1 is the thinnest, some go to 7, some
go to 5, you know all that kind of stuff.

00:00:53.450 --> 00:01:00.550
And as an instructor, when I'm teaching a
technique in a tutorial, it's very important

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:06.000
that everybody has the same kind of thickness,
otherwise the cane design or whatever it is

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.040
that you're working on won't work out.

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:14.320
So, now I think it was Maggie Macchione and
Sage Bray were some of the artists involved,

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:20.060
but I don't know exactly everybody, but this
idea came up where you use playing cards,

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:27.200
you know, your standard deck of cards to measure
the thickness of your pasta machine.

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.740
So what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna just show
you…I've got it at the thickest setting

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:38.570
which is a 1 on here, and I'm just gonna see
how many will fit through, and I keep taking

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:43.350
them away until I get a number that will fit
through.

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:51.869
So that one fit through but the previous one
didn't, so that would be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:56.170
7, 8 cards, and you do that for each setting
all the way down.

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:59.470
Now you can write it down on a little chart
or whatever, but one of the things I like

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:05.310
to do is I have one of those little label
printers, so I just made a sticker that I

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.840
stuck right down to my pasta machine here,
and you could just use a piece of tape if

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:16.230
you don't have a label maker, and I just put
the number 1 setting equals 8 cards, the number

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:23.120
2 setting was 7 cards, you know…all the
way down, and my…when I got down to 8 and

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:32.800
9, they were pretty close, 8 would fit 1 card,
I'll show you here, but…this is stiff from

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:46.489
this angle, 8 got 1 card, kinda, and 9 barely
could get it through, so what I considered…

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:51.170
8 is the 1 card, and 9 is half a card.

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:55.040
By the time you're getting down there, it
starts rippling and doing funny things anyways,

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.180
so it doesn't matter that much.

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:03.280
But that way, when I'm using this pasta machine
here at the studio and I'm making up a design

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:09.860
and then you're making it out there with your
own machine, if I say it needs 4 playing cards

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:15.260
thickness, then you know exactly what we're
talking about and you can set your machine

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:19.190
to suit it perfectly, we’re on the same
page that way.

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:24.390
So I hope that tip was helpful for you, now
my question…

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:29.160
oh if it was helpful, make sure to click that
like button that would be great.

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:38.879
And my question for you today is, are you
gonna use this tip, I mean it is a neat one,

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:43.239
it will really help you regulate things, so
if you are gonna use it, put that answer in

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:45.820
the comment section below, that would be great.

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:52.209
And make sure to subscribe, we have new videos
that come out every week and you're not gonna

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:53.690
wanna miss them.

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:55.750
So we'll see you next time, and bye for now.
