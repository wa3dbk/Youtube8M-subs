Hi guys! I'm Laura Vitale, on this episode
of Laura in the Kitchen I want to show you

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:24.600
how I make my delicious Ham and Cheese Croissants.
They're so delicious, couldn't be easier to

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:28.200
make, you're going to need just a couple ingredients,
so let me take you over them to get started.

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:33.120
You're going to need some store bought frozen
puff pastry, that has been thawed in the fridge

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.320
overnight, and then your choice of cheese,
I'm just using some cheddar and some smoked

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:42.440
ham, you're going to need one egg and with
a little bit of water, and salt and pepper.

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:47.149
Now if you want to, you can certainly make
your own puff pastry, but I have made it puff

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:51.410
pastry in the past, plenty of times and I
can tell you its a very labor intensive process,

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:56.289
it takes a very long time and I just don't
have the time or patience for it. And I think

00:00:56.289 --> 00:01:01.059
puff pastry is one of the greatest bargains
in the supermarket so, you'll find it in the

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:05.220
freezer section of any grocery store around
the country, and if you want to use it, just

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:10.140
thaw it overnight in the fridge and its good
to go! So, your cheese, and your ham, you

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:14.880
can use whatever you want. I make so many
varieties of this, I make prosciutto mozzarella,

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.630
I make provolone and salami, you name it.
So for now, we are just going to go right

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.530
into it. First thing you want to do is get
your oven hot, to 425F. Second thing you want

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:26.250
to do is get a baking sheet and line it with
parchment paper and get that ready. So now

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:29.640
we are going to start working with the puff
pastry. I am going to lightly flour my work

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.800
surface, because I am going to roll this out
just a little bit, because I want to get it

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:41.800
just a little bit thinner than it already
is. So, just take my rolling pin and roll

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:49.950
it out. That's looking good. Now what I'm
going to do, is I'm going to cut this in half,

00:01:50.649 --> 00:01:55.099
then cut it in half again, and then you're
going to cut in half again, but you're going

00:01:55.099 --> 00:02:02.099
to do it this way, so you're going to have
little triangles when you're done. Now I put

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:07.200
the rest of my triangles aside and now what
I'm doing with my hands is just working it

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.470
so that you have the pointy side right in
the center. Now here is how we are going to

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:17.340
do this. You're going to take your ham, and
then you're just going to fit it, OK, just

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.819
like that because these are going to be folded
in anyway, top it with your piece of cheese,

00:02:20.819 --> 00:02:26.650
you can do a little extra ham and cheese if
you want, if you want them real cheesy, just

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:33.610
like so, another little half piece of cheese.
Now, I have beaten my little egg here with

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:38.090
a little bit of water, and that's going to
make the glue, its going to make these really

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:42.320
really pretty as well when were done. And
now you're just going to fold them up, which

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:54.100
is really simple to do, just fold them on
each other. Just roll them, just like that.

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:57.500
that's how I make them. you'll want the little
pointy end to be at the bottom. Don't worry

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.560
these will puff up, and they are not going
to be like these huge croissants, but they

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:06.510
are going to be puffed up and gorgeous. So
continue to do those until they are all stuffed.

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:12.300
Last one done, look how cute they are. And
I just want to give you a heads up really quickly.

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:18.069
These are fantastic for brunch. They are fantastic
at anytime of day. But, if you want to, you

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:22.010
can make these ahead up until this point,
and then freeze them, so whenever you want

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:25.670
to make them just thaw them overnight in the
fridge and pop them in the oven the next morning.

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:31.010
You have homemade ham and cheese croissants.
I know! So, what I am going to do now is brush

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:36.040
the tops really well with the egg wash because
it is going to help them brown, and get lovely

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:41.170
and beautiful and golden as they puff up,
and then because these are savory, what I

00:03:41.170 --> 00:03:46.630
want to do, is I want to sprinkle just a little
bit of salt and pepper over the top, just

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:52.680
because, well they are savory, and I like
it. If I was making say, Nutella croissants

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:57.910
then I would skip that step and just finish
them with a little confectioners sugar. But

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:04.660
for these, this is how I like them. A little
bit of salt, not too much, and these are going

00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:09.100
to go into your preheated oven at 425F for
about 15 minutes or so, or until they are

00:04:09.110 --> 00:04:15.300
golden brown and puffed up. My little croissants
baked for about 15 minutes, and they are lightly

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:19.269
golden, they've puffed up, and are ready to
be eaten, which is exactly what I am going

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:33.200
to do to this one right here. I'm really excited,
but its going to be really hot. So good, but

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:40.650
hot. So delicious, so quick, so simple, and
like I said, if you want to make them in advance

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:45.280
and freeze them before you bake them, more
power to you, so go ahead and do that. As

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:48.680
you can see, they don't take anytime at all,
they just require a few ingredients, and they

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:53.300
come out perfect every single time. I hope
you have enjoyed spending time with me, go

00:04:53.370 --> 00:05:00.300

and I will see you next time. Bye bye!
