00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.490
How ya doing guys, you folk loved the ten
british treat video that I did the other day

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:08.124
so much so that i'm back today to show you
some more - what did we learn from the first

00:00:08.124 --> 00:00:13.081
video we learnt that Australians call teacakes
whippets which is what we call a breed of

00:00:13.081 --> 00:00:16.580
dog here in the UK, we learnt that those love
heart sweets that I showed you if you wet

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:21.450
them and stick on your arm you could make
tattoos I never knew that I feel like my childhood

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:25.730
needs to restart again and also Americans
what I was calling sherbert they refer to

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:30.480
that as some sort of ice-cream thing which
I think we call sorbet here in the UK anyhow

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.210
here's another ten for you to check out and
I hope you give them a try.

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:37.690
Now first up is jaffa cakes so I bought a
packet of these for the first video I did

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:40.830
but I had a feeling that most people in the
World knew what these were so I ended up eating

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:43.050
them before I shot the video - whoops.

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:46.230
Right so they come in a little orange tube
like this and as you can see i've eaten a

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:48.940
few of them already they are very addictive
once you get started eating on them they have

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:54.150
a sponge base with dark chocolate on top and
in the middle is an orange flavoured jelly

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:55.150
- super good.

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:59.000
And it's a true fact that top sporting teams
like Manchester United at half-time rather

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.570
than having oranges they would eat jaffa cakes
becuase they're so low in fat and give a massive

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:07.610
energy boost - such an energy boost that you
feel like a rasta running around your kitchen.

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:11.500
Next up is a sherbert fountain now these have
been around for yonks but i've never actually

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:16.040
had one before it looks kinda like a marker
pen or a nipple from that angle but we just

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:23.890
twist this lid off - oooh it's got liquorice
in it, I hate liquorice.

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:27.120
Alright so inside this canister there's a
load of sherbert just like the dip dab lolly

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:32.540
the other day but rather than the strawberry
lolly we've got liquorice this time.

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:39.470
And I hate liquorice as I say, there was a
lovely zing of the sherbert at first but then

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:46.040
that liquorice came through urgh tastes like
trainers, so give that a try if you want to.

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:49.930
Next up is an edible watch, now I used to
love these things as a kid basically it's

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:54.420
a watch with candy on it that you can eat
off like so and they're a lot like the loveheart

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.270
sweets they're hard crunchy and with a little
bit of a sherbert kick in there for the ultimate

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:03.299
in edible bling so for 23 Hours and 59 Minutes
these watches were kinda pointless but for

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:08.500
one minute you had the coolest watch in the
world - yo man you know what time it is?

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:11.380
It's 07:30 baby for the next minute.

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:15.540
Alright so next up is a tube of fruit pastilles
right so the best thing for you to imagine

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:19.050
is that these are gummy bears that have just
been made with a little more fruit juice and

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:21.980
the gummy bear is just walking down the street
and all of a sudden a giant bear squishes

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:27.110
it makes it into a coin shape scatters it
in sugar then runs off and you've effectively

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:28.670
got a fruit pastille.

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:33.560
Wow they've got a really chewy middle and
there's grains of sugar on it that give it

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:37.400
a teeny bit of crunch obviously a very naughty
crunch I remember my Mum &amp; Dad just shoving

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.066
me these whenever we were on road trips and
I was in the car going ' Are we nearly there

00:02:41.066 --> 00:02:44.180
yet?!' and they were like 'just give him some
fruit pastilles to shut him up!' and what's

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:48.120
also cool about it brings back memories of
when I was at school and kids would frantically

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.653
buy these from the vending machines and bite
into it and actually catch a little bit of

00:02:51.653 --> 00:02:55.860
the tin foil on their fillings in their teeth
- not good!

00:02:55.860 --> 00:03:00.200
Next up is a very popular pick n mix item
here in the UK called dolly mixtures now these

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:04.510
sweets are super naughty and they come in
all different shapes and sizes they are very

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:09.810
addictive indeed you've got a rounded square
one a rectangular one a jelly sugar coated

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:15.370
one and a cylinder shape one now back in the
1920's and 30's these used to be a lot more

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:20.150
bland they used to either be white, brown
or black it's kind of like now if you were

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:23.550
to re-introduce the modern dolly mixtures
and go back in time it'd be like walking into

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:25.810
a funeral dressed as where's wally.

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:31.000
Now next up are gold bars I was absolutely
fascinated by these little bars as a kid becuase

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.269
when I had one it felt like i'd actually struck
gold 'well spank my buttocks and call me Marlene

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:38.909
we struck gold partner yeeeha!'.

00:03:38.909 --> 00:03:42.650
Now they are actually gold coloured as you'll
see just like that it's from a caramel white

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:47.780
chocolate coating on top of a really crunchy
biscuit just like that.

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:51.409
Something I really wanna do with these gold
bars I don't wanna eat them all I wanna ring

00:03:51.409 --> 00:03:56.620
up one of those cash for gold companies and
go 'hi i've got some gold that I want to sell,

00:03:56.620 --> 00:04:01.450
i've got 198g of authentic gold' and see if
they give me any money for it that would be

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:04.540
kinda funny, maybe I should do a video of
that let me know if you want to see it.

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:09.069
And these my friends are rainbow drops very
colourful naughty things so effectively what

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:13.220
we're eating here is giant cereal that's been
super sized died a neon colour andd coated

00:04:13.220 --> 00:04:17.220
in sugar you bite into it and get through
that crispy layer of sugar you're basically

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:19.289
just eating breakfast cereal so maybe just
stick to that.

00:04:19.289 --> 00:04:22.529
We used to play a game with these at primary
school which got banned very quickly you've

00:04:22.529 --> 00:04:25.849
put it up your nose and attempt to exhale
it out and see who could get it the furthest

00:04:25.849 --> 00:04:29.839
someone inhaled it had to go to the school
nurse letters went home it got banned pretty

00:04:29.839 --> 00:04:32.439
quickly so don't do that game - don't do it!

00:04:32.439 --> 00:04:36.169
Next up are jelly babies which used to be
called peace babies to mark the end of the

00:04:36.169 --> 00:04:40.529
first world war but then we ended up going
back to war again so then they got re-branded

00:04:40.529 --> 00:04:44.680
after the second world war as jelly babies
now these jelly babies are a lot like gummy

00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:48.259
bears in that they are primarily made of gelatin
except these have got an outer layer made

00:04:48.259 --> 00:04:52.659
up of sugar and starch which gives it a teeny
bit of crispness when you bite into it.

00:04:52.659 --> 00:04:56.880
They come in different colours and the different
colours are different flavours and they've

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:02.419
even got individual baby names for them like
baby bonny, big hear and this is brilliant

00:05:02.419 --> 00:05:07.319
and there's something weird about biting off
a babies head.

00:05:07.319 --> 00:05:11.219
Next up is another world beater from tunnocks
you thought the tea cakes were good the caramel

00:05:11.219 --> 00:05:15.719
was legendary amongst school lunch boxes if
you opened your lunch box and saw a caramel

00:05:15.719 --> 00:05:19.349
in there you knew you we're gonna have an
amazing day good times and the other pupils

00:05:19.349 --> 00:05:20.809
would be very jealous of you.

00:05:20.809 --> 00:05:25.119
And it's such a simple thing it's individually
wrapped again, chocolate coated, break into

00:05:25.119 --> 00:05:31.009
it wafer, bands of caramel, wafter, bands
of caramel chocolate you wanna be on that

00:05:31.009 --> 00:05:35.719
bus of caramel loving and i'm gonna take you
there.

00:05:35.719 --> 00:05:39.770
Next up is a battenburg cake which is requested
by Mrs Barry actually it's a very sexy looking

00:05:39.770 --> 00:05:43.199
cake like a checkerboard finish on it like
that one thing I noticed when i was looking

00:05:43.199 --> 00:05:46.439
around the shops these are getting smaller
just like a lot of food I don't know if my

00:05:46.439 --> 00:05:49.922
eyes are getting bigger and companies stop
making things smaller please is it just my

00:05:49.922 --> 00:05:54.300
country this is happening to these used to
be enormous for half the price - crazy.

00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:58.770
It is super good my friends you've got the
coloured sponges with apricot jam holding

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:06.599
it together surrounded by a cloth of almond
paste / marzipan - oh my goodness so, so good.

00:06:06.599 --> 00:06:10.469
But to me the name battenburg seems kind of
wasted maybe they should use it also for a

00:06:10.469 --> 00:06:14.550
detective show, battenburg he's always on
the case.

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:18.659
So that's it then guys another ten reviewed
sorry about the sun coming in and out during

00:06:18.659 --> 00:06:22.639
the video hopefully that hasn't annoyed it
too much I did wanna show you drumstick lollies

00:06:22.639 --> 00:06:27.050
which are raspberry chewy lollies but that's
effectively all they are, I did want to show

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:30.280
you cadburys curly wurly but it turns out
you can get those in most countries anyway

00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:33.360
and I did want to show you werthers originals
because I thought they were a traditional

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:38.409
British sweet but it turns out they are made
in Germany -so clever marketing, what do I

00:06:38.409 --> 00:06:40.849
know anyhow if you enjoyed this video don't
forget to give it a thumbs up share subscribe

00:06:40.849 --> 00:06:44.119
and all that stuff if you wanna chuck in any
suggestions you wanna see on another one of

00:06:44.119 --> 00:06:47.300
these let me know or if you have sweets from
my country you want to send me to show the
