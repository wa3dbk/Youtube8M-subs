00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:11.620
Alright, today we are going to do some stress
tests on the Galaxy Note 5. This phone is

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:16.309
pretty much made out of the same basic materials
as the Galaxy S6 and the Galaxy S6 edge, so

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:20.000
I am not going to do the same stress tests
that I did on those phones. You can watch

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.449
those videos if you want to see how it handles
flame or scratches on the front or the back.

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:29.330
In this video I am just going to see how scratch
resistant the camera lens is with my razor

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:32.830
blade, and I am going to do a bend test as
well. As you can see I am taking my razor

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:36.940
blade and sliding it along the glass, a bunch
of different angles on the lens. And it actually

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:41.010
held up pretty darn well. The camera lens
is probably made out of the same tempered

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.989
glass that the front and the back of the phone
are made out of. So it is pretty resistant

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:47.690
to scratches, which is very nice. So I am
doing to do this bend test in a couple different

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:51.719
ways. First of which I am going to take my
hands and distribute the weight of the bend

00:00:51.719 --> 00:00:56.039
along the frame of the phone as well as the
screen and the back. So you can see me press

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.020
on the screen of the phone here. And it actually
survives pretty well; it handles the pressure

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:03.789
of my hands pretty well. I am going to flip
it around still keeping the pressure along

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:08.070
the frame of the screen to see how much that
can handle. Still pretty straight, screen

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:11.410
is just fine, everything is still working
really well. So now I am going to take my

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:16.140
hands and press more along the center of the
screen, to you know, put more pressure on

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.190
the 'guts' of the phone. It looks like the
'guts' allow for a little bit of flex, but

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:23.020
the frame definitely stays ridged along the
side of the phone. I am going to try twisting

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:27.950
it a little bit in my hands, just to see if
the frame can handle that torque motion, and

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:32.229
everything looks good so far! You can see
that the phone is slightly warped, But there

00:01:32.229 --> 00:01:36.300
is no permanent damage. So I wouldn't have
any problem putting this in my back pocket

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:39.560
and sitting on it all day. Overall, pretty
satisfied with the build quality of this phone.

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:43.830
It feels pretty solid in my hand. Honestly
the only problems that I have with this phone

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:47.750
is that it just doesn't have an SD card slot,
and doesn't have a removable battery. Those

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.000
are pretty important to me as a smart phone
user. Anyway! If you have any questions, be

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.690
sure to leave them in the comments. Don't
forget to like if this video was interesting,

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:58.580
and don't forget to subscribe! It does help
me out a lot. Overall this phone held up WAY

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:03.140
better than the HTC M9. That phone snapped
in half in my hands. Go ahead and click on

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.399
this video if you want to check that out!
And don't forget to check out my Instagram,

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:10.509
I promise I do more fun things than JUST taking
apart cell phones. Thanks for watching!
