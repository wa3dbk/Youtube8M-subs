00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:05.130
.

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.630
Uh, hi.

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:09.830
My name is Cory Arcangel,

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.230
and we are sitting

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:13.360
in the Whitney Museum right now

00:00:13.430 --> 00:00:15.900
in an exhibition that I put together

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.500
called "Pro Tools."

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:19.260
The kind of centerpiece of the show,

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:21.300
the piece that the whole show is kind of

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:23.060
constructed around, is a piece called

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.500
"Various Self-Playing Bowling Games."

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:26.860
It was a co-commission

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:28.300
between the Whitney Museum

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:29.760
and the Barbican in London.

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:31.400
As you kind of walk into the museum,

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:32.560
you're presented

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:33.930
with these big projections.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.200
In each projection is different

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.100
bowling games from the history

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:38.830
of video game bowling.

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:40.560
Part of this piece is me saying

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:42.330
that these things are worth preserving

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:46.400
culturally outside of disposable culture.

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:48.600
Each of them have been modified

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.360
to play themselves

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.000
and only roll gutter balls

00:00:52.060 --> 00:00:55.330
over and over and over again.

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.000
CHRISTIANE PAUL: What we see in the games

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:59.260
is only gutter balls being thrown,

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:00.630
which is, of course,

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:03.360
a very frustrating process.

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:05.630
Everything that the game promises

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.030
in terms of, um, reward,

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.630
a rewarding experience is denied

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.000
to the viewer here.

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:15.260
So the connection between our physical

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.730
activity and what it should result in

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:22.500
within the game is disrupted.

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.160
I've always liked to watch people

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:26.030
play video games, um,

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.730
or to watch video games as cinema.

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.500
So when you start watching a video game

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:31.700
and you start considering it as cinema,

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.960
it becomes so unlike what you've seen

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:38.800
in cinema that it's kind of interesting.

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:41.500
We see the evolution of the human

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.560
figure, um,  throughout those games.

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:46.600
The way in which the avatars

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:49.330
become more and more sophisticated,

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:52.960
but at the same time remain a kind of

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:54.730
cheesy or sometimes funny depiction

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:56.760
of the human body.

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:59.300
Of course, there is a goal of being

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.930
more and more representational.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.760
With this kind of depiction, we will

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:07.230
then approach the uncanny valley

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:09.860
where it becomes realistic and creepy

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:11.760
at the same time.

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:13.900
That also highlights our expectations.

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:16.830
What do we really want from this medium

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.060
and what is this all about?

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:21.230
ARCANGEL: I can pick only the best six

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:22.930
to show at the Whitney.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.460
The superstar and my favorite of the bunch

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.230
is the PlayStation...

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:28.700
the "Brunswick Bowling" for PlayStation.

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:33.660
It... like, it's early 3-D.

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:36.430
It's, like, really clunky polygons.

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:37.560
It's the characters that it generates.

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:38.860
It generates a different character

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:40.800
every day.

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:42.060
They're... they're kind of like

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:44.060
barely human.

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:45.230
They're... they're also sexless.

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:49.330
It's hard to tell what gender they are.

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.100
Um, you know, they're kind of zombie...

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:53.530
like they're kind of zombie-ish.

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:55.130
You know, it's just horrifying.

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.400
And I... and the colors, it's like blue

00:02:57.460 --> 00:02:59.060
and yellow with really garish...

00:02:59.130 --> 00:03:01.660
and so that, I think, right now

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:06.730
in 2011, that particular era of graphics

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:09.560
is the most visually upsetting, therefore

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:11.960
the most interesting, I think, you know.

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.730
And as the piece ages, and you know,

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:16.500
I'm sure other graphics

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:17.800
will start to stand out.

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:19.100
Like maybe the GameCube,

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:20.460
the last one,

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:24.900
which is almost, almost, almost realistic,

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:28.000
you know, it's almost like a...

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:29.400
it doesn't look realistic

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:31.500
but it's not quite cartoonish.

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.130
It's... it's in this kind of

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:34.400
uncomfortable place as well.

00:03:34.460 --> 23:59:59.000
.
