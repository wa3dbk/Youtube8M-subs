00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:19.800
I've had Staffordshire Bull Terriers virtually
all my life. My father bred them and I grew

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.910
up with the, and my children have grown up
with them. I have kept quite a few breeds

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:30.700
in my life as well as the Stafford, but I
mean, it is the best breed.

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:39.270
Staffies are brilliant dogs. They're really
lively, really energetic, really fun type

00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:44.320
dogs, and they are real people dogs. They
love people so they make fabulous pets. Staffies

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:48.180
often get a bad press, which really isn't
fair. They're great dogs, they're real fun

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:53.830
personality dogs, lively, they love to play
games, and in the right environment with the

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:57.890
right training they make fabulous pets.

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:03.480
if you buy a Stafford to protect it when it's
young. Don't let a dog down the road bully

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:08.909
it, don't give it a bad experience with another
dog, because that is when you're likely to

00:01:08.909 --> 00:01:14.619
create a dog that doesn't get on with other
four-legged animals. People think of them

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:21.300
as a guard dog, and they are not. They love
people, they're reserved as most guard dogs

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:28.240
are. They will look after people, particularly
weak people, the weakest in the family, either

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:34.860
the child or a woman against a man, but they
won't necessarily look after your pictures

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:36.970
or your furniture or your jewellery.

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:43.520
When you think about a Staffie, you're getting
a small dog with a huge personality. Anecdotally,

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.299
they're supposed to be good with children
and not so good with other dogs and that's

00:01:47.299 --> 00:01:51.890
probably because there's some terrier in there.
From a behavioural point of view, when I think

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:57.560
of a Staffie I'm thinking of a chewer, and
a powerful chewer at that. So we're looking

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:02.799
at leaving it lots of appropriate things to
chew such as Nylabones. If you don't he may

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:07.500
well start chewing your furniture. They can
also tug a lot because they've got that bulldog

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:11.880
part of the heritage, and that means that
they can hang on to things a lot. So you need

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:17.700
to teach and 'off' command very early, while
it's still a puppy. Big personality, small

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:25.340
dog, very muscley, you need to train it.

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:30.331
Staffordshire Bull Terrier has a smooth coat,
which is really low maintenance coat. Doesn't

00:02:30.331 --> 00:02:36.760
need to be groomed by a professional dog groomer,
just brush with rubber brush on a regular

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:42.140
basis. If you don't want to spend money on
grooming, Staffie is idea breed. They don't

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:48.950
smell, they're easy to look after, always
clean.

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:57.450
If you already have a dog in the house you
have to be careful. If they come as a puppy,

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:03.349
then you'll probably be alright. A lot of
people two bitch Staffords. I would say never

00:03:03.349 --> 00:03:09.050
try to keep two male Staffords together. Before
they buy them I think they should go and meet

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:14.770
them in people's homes. They're very lively,
so they will come immediately up to you and

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:20.120
probably jump up to you depending on how well
trained the owners have them. They have now

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:25.860
become mixed with a lot of other breeds, and
so whilst they might look a bit like a Strafford,

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:30.640
if they're not a full Stafford they may very
well have the characteristics of the other

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:35.900
breed, so you're not getting what you expected.
It does actually pay to go to a proper breeder

00:03:35.900 --> 00:03:41.530
and have a proper Kennel Club registration.
And all the health checks that go along with

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:55.340
that, by the way. Because you're more likely
to get the proper character if you do that.
