00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:09.810
There is a condition called bloat or torsion;
gastric torsion which is common in some breeds

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:15.910
of dogs. More common in some than others but
certainly almost any breed dog is susceptible

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:25.080
to it and what happens is the stomach fills
up with gas and it bloats up. The stomach

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:32.160
lining becomes very tight and the dog is in
a lot of discomfort and torsion is when the

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:41.620
stomach turns on its axis and twists. When
that happens, there is a serious time limit

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:48.249
before your dog eventually dies. You need
to get to doctor or veterinarian as soon as

00:00:48.249 --> 00:00:59.059
possible. Bloat is most common in large breed
barrel shaped dogs. There is a couple of things

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:07.190
you can do to avoid bloat. One thing is to
make sure after your dog has had a lot of

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:15.900
exercise they don't eat or drink huge amounts
of water. If it is very very hot out and your

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:21.501
dog has been exercised, you want to monitor
very closely the amount of water that the

00:01:21.501 --> 00:01:27.090
dog takes in and you certainly should not
feed your dog before or after within about

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:37.360
an hour of series of exercises. Another thing
that can reduce the risk of bloat is eating

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:45.660
whole foods, so real foods often recommended
to feed raw meat or a cooked diet as opposed

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:55.070
to a Kibble diet and although a number of
years ago it was thought that by feeding in

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:00.780
raised food bowls and water bowls that it
would reduce the likelihood of bloat. There

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:06.200
is a study that is put out by Cornell that
demonstrate that in fact that can increase

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:12.870
the risk of bloat. The Cornell study is very
informative and I would suggest anyone with

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:19.550
a breed of dog that may tend to bloat, read
the study, inform themselves about what bloat

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:25.889
is, find out what the symptoms are and read
as much as you possibly can. This is a killer

00:02:25.889 --> 00:02:30.989
that hits people and their dogs and many many
people never knew what it was until it was

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:31.390
too late.
