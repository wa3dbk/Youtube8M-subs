00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:09.320
The first thing we're going to do is. We're
lucky actually that it has already been drilled.

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:18.100
Somebody drilled this at some time. A long
time ago it looks like. So what we have on

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:28.790
the door is two basic parts. We have the doorknob
section. This is a used one but still perfectly

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:39.109
good. We're going to put these on here and
then in the, and then we're also going to

00:00:39.109 --> 00:00:49.039
put on another piece that will go into here.
Now right off I'm seeing that this piece is

00:00:49.039 --> 00:00:55.929
hitting on the inside so we're probably need
to, see how this does not sit down here quite

00:00:55.929 --> 00:01:01.989
far enough so this, this wasn't supposed to
do this but this is a common problem that

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:08.220
you can run into when you're replacing it.
Now the type of doorknobs that I recommend

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:17.160
is a manufacture called Kwikset K.W.I.K.S.E.T.
This brand, it just works pretty well and

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:23.720
it's a pretty good design and it's pretty
easy to install. So that's my recommendation

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:30.930
but it appears as though somebody has put
in a different style of a lock. I don't know

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:37.850
back in the 1940's or 50's. It's a little
bit different and also it looks as though,

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:45.560
this is the back set but the back set looks
like it is proper for this but the hole is

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:51.630
a, it's hitting so this won't go in far enough
and you know it's starting to look like, the

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:59.920
hole may be the wrong size also. This is going
to need to go through here and I'm seeing

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:07.730
that the bolts won't go through so we're going
to need to make this hole a little bit bigger.
