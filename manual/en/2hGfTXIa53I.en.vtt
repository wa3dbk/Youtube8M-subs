00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:08.020
Mark Hall, University Writing Center Director: The University Writing Center offers free

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:14.050
one-on-one and small-group consultations for any writing you do while you’re at UCF. 

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:20.180
 

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:26.320
dam Benzekri, peer writing consultant: Tutors work with writers by both the tutor and the writer thinking about the work that has to be done, thinking about the paper,

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:32.360
and thinking about how each person can solve the problem together. 

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:38.470
Brianna Williams, peer writing consultant: We’ll spend the first few minutes just discussing the assignment. Before we can even begin reading your paper, we have to understand what exactly you’re trying

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:44.590
to do with your paper, what does your professor want you to do with your paper. Adam: It’s a lot easier than if the writer was at home and thinking, 

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:50.600
oh, how do I solve this, if you can bounce off ideas with a tutor. 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:56.740
Nate King, peer writing consultant: So basically what we do is we help you plan, you know, your paper, organize what you already have, or even

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:02.840
[help you learn to] go through and edit or help you with citations. 

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:08.920
Brianna: The students that we work with in the writing center will range from either freshman to even like graduate-level to even maybe working on their Ph.D. 

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:15.060
 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:21.140
Brianna: So a group consultation is basically a consultation that a consultant would have with more than one student. Generally those students would be working on a project

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:27.200
together and as your role as a tutor, you would be facilitating that conversation. 

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:33.290
 

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:39.460
Adam: Writing consultants are peers that are very versed with genres. 

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:45.500
Nate: Writing consultants are either graduate students or undergrad students that come in and help you with your writing. A lot of us come from different academic backgrounds; that’s very helpful. 

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:51.590
Adam: They don’t necessarily have all this content experience with every single field, every single subject, but they do know how to problem-solve. 

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:57.640
 

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:03.780
 

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:09.920
Sasha Krawczyk, peer writing consultant: At the UWC, students come in to work on all types of writing. So in one day of working here, I might see someone come in with a Ph.D. dissertation; I might see somebody come in

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:16.000
with an [ENC] 1101 research paper, we might even see Peace Corps applications, resumes, scholarship applications, 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:22.040
Sometimes we even get thank you letters and love letters. So you can see everything in one day. 

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:28.050
Sasha: To come to the writing center, students don’t need much of anything. They can come in with just a blank piece of paper and ideas; 

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:34.220
they can come in with a textbook that they need to reference; they can come in with a complete draft or a piece of paper that doesn’t have anything on it yet.

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:40.230
So there’s no need for students to come in with tons of writing, but if they feel comfortable coming in with a draft, they can as well. 

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:46.320
 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:52.370
Mark Hall: The University Writing Center is located on the first floor of Colbourn Hall, which is near the campus bookstore in the John T. Washington Center.
