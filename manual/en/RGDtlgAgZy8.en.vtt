00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:04.529
JOE WILES: We're on segment three of System
of a Down's "Hypnotize." We've gone through

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:07.782
the first two segments, learned most of the
introduction, and in this one, we're going

00:00:07.782 --> 00:00:11.960
to finish it off and put it all together.
Take a look at the guitar. Now, this is a

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:43.370
quick review of what we've learned so far,
okay? In this next bit, we're going to go

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:48.469
all the way up. Now, we're still fretting
everything on the B string and answering with

00:00:48.469 --> 00:00:55.899
the open G string. We're going to go all the
way up to the 15th fret up here, okay? Then

00:00:55.899 --> 00:01:10.490
we're going to down to the 13th fret--12th
fret--10th fret--back up to the 13th fret--12th

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:42.920
fret--10th fret--8th fret. All right. This
part, slowly, has this sound. And to finish

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:57.250
this out, we're going to go on the 11th fret--10th--8th
and then 7th. It feels a little uneven, but

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:04.619
the introduction doesn't have an even set
of measures. This whole last riff, slowly,

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:27.610
sounds like this.

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:33.400
Now, put together the whole introduction.
Slowly, I want you to play along. It sounds

00:02:33.400 --> 00:03:29.690
like this. And repeat. And let's go up to
the 8th fret. Repeat this beat at the 8th

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:49.120
fret--up to the 15th. In our next segment,
we're going to take a look at number 35. See

00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:49.379
you there.
