00:00:01.100 --> 00:00:03.260
Take a random word

00:00:03.560 --> 00:00:07.180
say- melancholy

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:10.520
Melancholy has a number of synonyms

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:13.420
but what about the synonyms of those synonyms?

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:16.940
and the synonyms of those synonym's synonyms?

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:20.120
if you went far enough and in the right direction - 

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:21.920
what words would you find?

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:24.380
And how different would these words become?

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:29.240
even a path from 'melancholy' to a word like, say - 

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:34.020
'fulfilled' can be uncovered if you dig deeply enough

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:37.940
Synonymy is a game of finding these paths

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:04.540
When you start a new game you are presented with a goal word, and it's definition

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:08.960
for this tutorial, our goal word is 'synonymy'

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:14.520
swiping from right to left, we see our starting word, in this case 'trust'

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:20.580
We see trust has many pages of synonyms, four on each page

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:28.160
Tapping on any one of these replaces the current term and reveals synonyms for the new word

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:35.540
In order to complete the game, you must get to the goal word in as expeditious and ergonomic a way as possible

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.940
Sound reacts dynamically to your choices, and can help indicate whether you're going in the right direction

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:48.640
If you make a mistake, the previous word is always in the upper left hand corner

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:54.920
And if the goal word is among the current word's synonyms, it will always be in the upper right

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:05.320
In the 'more' section, you can change the difficulty of the game

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:09.020
You can also see the latest winning paths and scores of other players

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:19.360
By holding down the 'new game' button, you can enter challenge mode where you can input a passcode

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:25.440
If any two players input the same passcode and are on the same difficulty setting, they can compete

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:34.720
In this way, you can challenge existing scores on twitter or race friends and family

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:41.140
We hope you enjoy your journey through Synonymy!
