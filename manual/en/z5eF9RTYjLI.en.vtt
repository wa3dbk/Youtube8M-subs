00:00:01.163 --> 00:00:10.452
(Background music)

00:00:10.452 --> 00:00:11.272
(Bell ringing)

00:00:11.272 --> 00:00:13.437
Good afternoon. Have you ever been curious

00:00:13.437 --> 00:00:17.268
about how much time does a person spend driving in their lifetime?

00:00:17.268 --> 00:00:20.097
Well, the answer is five-and-a-half years;

00:00:20.097 --> 00:00:23.433
given an average life span of 77 years,

00:00:23.433 --> 00:00:27.013
an average person is driving for 7% of their life.

00:00:27.013 --> 00:00:29.498
What is more astonishing is that the odds of

00:00:29.498 --> 00:00:32.724
dying in a plane crash are around one in 11 million;

00:00:32.724 --> 00:00:37.224
but the odds of dying in a car accident are around one in 5,000.

00:00:37.224 --> 00:00:39.830
So, we are all much more likely to die

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:43.364
getting to the airport than we are flying in the plane.

00:00:43.364 --> 00:00:46.223
So let me ask who drove to school today?

00:00:46.223 --> 00:00:48.857
Well, if you did, there's no time to worry yet,

00:00:48.857 --> 00:00:53.222
there is a 99% chance that you'll make it home safely tonight.

00:00:53.222 --> 00:00:55.074
But if car accidents did happen

00:00:55.074 --> 00:00:57.713
then the chances of us surviving are very much

00:00:57.713 --> 00:01:00.655
dependent on the types of collisions involved.

00:01:00.655 --> 00:01:03.385
Side-impact crashes, particularly account for

00:01:03.385 --> 00:01:05.495
a high percentage of fatal crashes.

00:01:05.495 --> 00:01:09.115
Well, this is because unlike frontal and rear [unclear] vehicle,

00:01:09.115 --> 00:01:11.796
there's a limited space for vehicle's side structure

00:01:11.796 --> 00:01:14.473
to deform before hitting the near-side passengers.

00:01:14.473 --> 00:01:16.980
For my PhD, I'm looking for a way

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:19.150
to strengthen the vehicle's side door

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:21.281
with protective structure such as

00:01:21.281 --> 00:01:22.879
a side-impact beam.

00:01:22.879 --> 00:01:25.301
A side-impact beam is a longitudinal bar

00:01:25.301 --> 00:01:27.004
moulded on the inner door panels

00:01:27.004 --> 00:01:28.859
and fixed to the door supports.

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:31.336
But the hollow structural sections of existing

00:01:31.336 --> 00:01:34.104
side-impact beam often has limited power

00:01:34.104 --> 00:01:36.963
to resist severe and perpendicular impact

00:01:36.963 --> 00:01:38.378
into the middle of the door.

00:01:38.378 --> 00:01:40.679
So what does this have anything to do with nature?

00:01:40.679 --> 00:01:44.037
Well, recent research shows that cellular structures

00:01:44.037 --> 00:01:45.632
are mechanically efficient.

00:01:45.632 --> 00:01:49.247
The material porosity may serve a variety of functions

00:01:49.247 --> 00:01:51.761
including provision for high stiffness

00:01:51.761 --> 00:01:53.672
and crush energy absorption.

00:01:53.672 --> 00:01:56.361
So I'm going to take a pitch from nature.

00:01:56.361 --> 00:02:00.281
Materials with such cellular structures are widespread in nature

00:02:00.281 --> 00:02:04.298
such as wood, cork, plant stems and even leaves.

00:02:04.298 --> 00:02:07.985
For example, the honeycomb-like microstructure of wood and cork

00:02:07.985 --> 00:02:11.264
and the polyhedral cell structure found in plant stems

00:02:11.264 --> 00:02:13.053
give a high performance index

00:02:13.053 --> 00:02:15.692
for resisting bending and buckling.

00:02:15.692 --> 00:02:17.701
While the sandwiched structure of

00:02:17.701 --> 00:02:20.808
iris and cattail leaves with two stiff and strong faces

00:02:20.808 --> 00:02:23.006
separated by a lightweight [foam ?] core

00:02:23.006 --> 00:02:26.150
could provide structural rigidity and strength.

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.915
Emulating such cellular structures by

00:02:28.915 --> 00:02:31.368
means of metals or composites

00:02:31.368 --> 00:02:34.286
is believed to be able to improve the mechanical response

00:02:34.286 --> 00:02:35.695
of traditional materials.

00:02:35.695 --> 00:02:37.609
So the next thing on my research

00:02:37.609 --> 00:02:40.946
is to investigate and compare different cellular structures

00:02:40.946 --> 00:02:43.735
mainly looking at how the [unclear] arrangement,

00:02:43.735 --> 00:02:47.377
pattern, size affect the structural response of

00:02:47.377 --> 00:02:48.823
simple metal beam.

00:02:48.823 --> 00:02:50.456
But this is not the aim of my research.

00:02:50.456 --> 00:02:54.679
The ultimate aim of my research is to apply similar cellular structures

00:02:54.679 --> 00:02:57.346
to side-impact beam to improve the crashworthiness

00:02:57.346 --> 00:02:58.758
of vehicle's side door

00:02:58.758 --> 00:03:00.830
and more importantly, increase our chance of

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:02.843
getting home safely tonight. Thank you.

00:03:02.843 --> 00:03:05.047
(Applause)
