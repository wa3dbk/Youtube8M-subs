Howdy folks it is Barry here welcome to my
virgin kitchen just a little bit of fun for

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:09.510
you today as you know the world cup football
tournament is in full flow at the moment and

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.990
I have had loads of messages in the last few
weeks in the run up to the world cup too saying

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.290
Barry are you doing some sort of edible world
cup trophy now I do not know if you have ever

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:22.470
seen that trophy but it is not the easiest
trophy to replicate it is a little crazy shaped

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:26.940
thing but there is a way around it and it
involves food it is just a little bit of fun

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:30.980
inspired by David Baddiel and Frank Skinner
check out the song 3 lions It is a really

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:36.170
popular England football song *sings 3 lions*
I do not think it has been spread that much

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:40.429
so I am going to show you how to do it right
now all you need is some sort of device to

00:00:40.429 --> 00:00:47.449
hold a lot of custard, you also need a lot
of custard and you need a melon, really easy

00:00:47.449 --> 00:00:50.019
lets do it.
Right then folks I have just opened up 18

00:00:50.019 --> 00:00:53.469
separate tins of custard it was super cheap
as they did not have the ring pull on it so

00:00:53.469 --> 00:00:59.250
I had to do manual labour but anyhow lets
get that now into our custard holder. So all

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:06.060
I am going to do now is get my custard and
pour it into the custard vessel that is what

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.130
we are going to call it ï¿½ yeah. Alright
so I will make this my last tin and this is

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:14.229
nice and full I still have about 7 tins left
but anyhow we will push the melon right in

00:01:14.229 --> 00:01:18.119
there the volume will increase and it should
look like the World Cup trophy.

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:23.470
Alright guys picture the scene it is world
cup final day your team has just won the world

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:26.689
cup in fact who do we think is going to win
the world cup I think argentina but that is

00:01:26.689 --> 00:01:32.520
just my opinion let me know down below here
we go in it goes oh my goodness will get my

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:41.090
hand right in there to get the effect it is
the world cup trophy right? Oh my gosh it

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:46.729
does look like it it looks a bit veiny and
I am getting custard all over my floor like

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:52.179
a dirt protest but there we go then guys argentina
my tip for winning the world cup or England

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:56.280
Barry Lewis has just scored the winning goal
in the World cup final, this is how you can

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.520
make your very own homemade world cup trophy
just like that as I say inspired by David

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.219
Baddiel and Frank Skinner check out the 3
lions video, enjoy the world cup guys and

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:10.720

Sorry guys just one thing, I smell amazing

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:15.290

de custard for men so so good I kind of want

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:19.250
to take it up a level now not a little bin
I want to take it into a big paddling pool

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:22.646
crash helmet on and make a human world cup
trophy that is the sort of thing I would do

00:02:22.646 --> 00:02:26.040
