00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:05.490
Whazzup homies,

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.520
I'm going to show you

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:10.559
how to play two players splitscreen,

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:11.980
two controllers,

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:13.950
one on the GamePad and one on the TV.

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:15.769
The first thing you want to do is actually

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:16.930
not be in a lobby.

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:18.650
You don't want to be searching for a lobby.

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:20.570
You see here, it's not working for me.

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:22.690
So what you need to do is back out of the
lobby.

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:24.590
Once you've done that, next thing you want
to do

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:27.650
is actually connect the controller you want
as Player 2 and hit A,

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:29.940
and once you do that, this little screen will
come up

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:32.270
and what you want to do is scroll down to
the bottom option,

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:34.160
which is 'Sign in additional player',

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.420
and what this will actually do is bring up
another screen,

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:38.170
which asks which User you want to Sign In.

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:39.850
In this case, I'll just 'Play as guest',

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:41.789
and you can play two player as a guest,

00:00:41.789 --> 00:00:43.829
but if you actually have a Nintendo Network
ID

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.379
under another User Account,

00:00:45.379 --> 00:00:46.379
you can use two accounts

00:00:46.379 --> 00:00:49.069
and actually Level Up on that account as well.

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:51.829
Two players at the same time on two completely
different screens,

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:54.519
so you have two full screens.

00:00:54.519 --> 00:00:57.679
You may require a HDTV for Double Screen.

00:00:57.679 --> 00:00:59.339
Here's a quick demonstration of:

00:00:59.339 --> 00:01:00.339
Double Screen.

00:01:00.339 --> 00:01:01.420
Player 1 on the Wii U GamePad

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:04.500
and Player 2 on Wii Remote and Nunchuk.

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:05.500
Split Screen

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:07.500
Select Split Screen on the Wii U GamePad

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.380
Player 1 on the Wii U GamePad

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.079
and Player 2 on Wii Remote and Nunchuk.

00:01:13.079 --> 00:01:14.079
Double Screen.

00:01:14.079 --> 00:01:15.430
Player 1 on Wii Remote and Nunchuk

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:18.350
and Player 2 on the Wii U GamePad.

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:19.350
Split Screen

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:21.340
Select Split Screen on the Wii U GamePad

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.630
Player 1 on Wii Remote and Nunchuk

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:28.000
and Player 2 on the Wii U GamePad.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.469
Signing in a secondary Wii Remote and Nunchuk.

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:32.469
Double Screen.

00:01:32.469 --> 00:01:33.789
Player 1 on Wii Remote and Nunchuk

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:39.320
and Player 2 on Wii Remote and Nunchuk.

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:40.380
Split Screen

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.570
Select Split Screen on the Wii U GamePad

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.960
Player 1 on Wii Remote and Nunchuk

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:48.359
and Player 2 on Wii Remote and Nunchuk.

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:50.159
Sign Out the Secondary Player by Pressing
B

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:51.880
on the Secondary Controller.

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.409
That's pretty much to it, that's what I've
got for you there.

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:56.829
Anyway, I hope you enjoyed the video.

00:01:56.829 --> 00:01:58.119
I realise it was kind of basic

00:01:58.119 --> 00:01:59.119
but there were some very, very important things
in here,

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:00.200
and I'm hoping I was able to teach you something
new

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.200
and you will be ready

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:02.200
to take on Multiplayer

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:03.200
whenever you start playing.

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.200
So that's it for this video,

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.200
hopefully these tips have been helpful for
you.

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:06.200
So, after you do this,

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:07.200

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.200
