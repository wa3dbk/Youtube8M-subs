00:00:09.031 --> 00:00:15.480
lessons

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:31.961
When we talk about shifting

00:00:31.961 --> 00:00:35.871
we just be moving your hand up and down the neck to different positions

00:00:35.871 --> 00:00:39.371
before we get to that let's take a quick
second and get to know you guitar a little

00:00:39.371 --> 00:00:41.460
better

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:44.360
most guitars use dots or some other kind
inlay

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.621
to mark certain frets

00:00:46.621 --> 00:00:49.891
They are usually marked on both the fretboard and the upper side of the neck

00:00:49.891 --> 00:00:55.501
the first dot is usually on the 3rd
fret. Go ahead and find that on your

00:00:55.501 --> 00:00:56.151
guitar

00:00:56.151 --> 00:01:00.361
let's just play the third fret on the
low E string

00:01:00.361 --> 00:01:07.361
the thickest string highlighted in red

00:01:08.831 --> 00:01:15.401
Let's just try that

00:01:15.401 --> 00:01:17.391
sweet

00:01:17.391 --> 00:01:21.811
there will probably also be dots or inlays on the 5th, 7th and 9th fret

00:01:21.811 --> 00:01:26.291
let's find those

00:01:26.291 --> 00:01:29.591
Amazing

00:01:29.591 --> 00:01:32.371
Amazing

00:01:32.371 --> 00:01:37.451
That was almost too perfect

00:01:37.451 --> 00:01:41.851
the next one up is the twelfth fret
usually marked with a double dot

00:01:41.851 --> 00:01:45.171
the twelfth fret is special because notes
12 frets apart

00:01:45.171 --> 00:01:48.571
are what we call an octave higher. That
means it's the same

00:01:48.571 --> 00:01:52.211
note, just a higher pitch

00:01:52.211 --> 00:01:55.991
same thing with third and 15th frets, they are 12 frets apart

00:01:55.991 --> 00:01:58.421
so it's another octave

00:01:58.421 --> 00:02:02.031
notice the dot pattern about the 12th
fret just repeats the pattern from the

00:02:02.031 --> 00:02:02.951
lower frets

00:02:02.951 --> 00:02:06.741
the dots above the 12th fret

00:02:06.741 --> 00:02:09.911
are the 15th, 17th, 19th and

00:02:09.911 --> 00:02:13.811
21st. Don't worry as you play
more

00:02:13.811 --> 00:02:17.331
these fret numbers will become second
nature and you'll be able to quickly tell

00:02:17.331 --> 00:02:18.341
whichever dots are an

00:02:18.341 --> 00:02:21.701
octave higher than the lower ones

00:02:21.701 --> 00:02:26.901
try it at your own pace

00:02:26.901 --> 00:02:29.691
right on nice

00:02:29.691 --> 00:02:34.501
sweet

00:02:34.501 --> 00:02:38.361
perfect

00:02:38.361 --> 00:02:45.361
Now here is a riff that will take some shifting to play

00:02:51.951 --> 00:02:58.951
listen to this riff one more time
before you play it

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:10.391
now your turn

00:03:15.961 --> 00:03:21.020
Yeah, that was good

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:24.201
Here's another one with

00:03:24.201 --> 00:03:30.521
a little more shifting to it

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:45.770
here's that riff again but let's just
listen to it, you can play after that

00:03:48.881 --> 00:03:55.881
okay try playing it now

00:03:59.641 --> 00:04:06.641
That was pretty sweet. You're ready to apply this to a practice track now

00:04:08.701 --> 00:04:15.701
Here it goes

00:05:12.561 --> 00:05:19.561
perfect performance!
