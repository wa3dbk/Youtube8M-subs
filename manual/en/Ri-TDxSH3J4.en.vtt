00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:04.690
so in a striking display of the free
market inaction that state governments

00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:07.950
around the country are returned to north
carolina where their state senate is

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:11.300
considering a bill that would
effectively banned the auto manufacturer

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:15.940
tests la from selling cars in their
state uh... now i'm not exaggerating if

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:18.109
it is passed its current form

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:22.240
all week as to what will be outlawed in
north carolina

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:24.200
to c_n_n_ idea of how the bill functions

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:28.380
what they're worried about is what they
consider to be unfair competition uh...

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.540
i think that what they're really worried
about is just competition but they say

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:33.310
unfair for their for their sick

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:35.750
so the problem is they have with tassel
specifically

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:39.340
is that they don't operate for a network
of third-party dealers which every other

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:41.850
auto manufacturer that i know that lease
does

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.070
uh... they just do direct sales idea
through their showrooms through online

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:47.920
and those than they sell directly to the
consumers

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.410
now who is backing this bill in north
carolina isle of this the north carolina

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.469
automobile dealers association uh...
you're not going to press on that out

00:00:56.469 --> 00:01:00.450
and other sponsor of a state senator tom
apple dhaka

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:04.640
little bit of trivia about tom papa doc
a what he's best known for at least in

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.730
this story is taking the maximum eight
thousand dollars in donations from the

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:12.610
north carolina automobile dealers
association just last year

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:15.040
maybe those are connected maybe they're
not let's do a little bit of research

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:16.260
find out

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:20.540
and so they would be in tests love from
from uh... engaging in any sales

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:23.530
whatsoever even online sales in north
carolina

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:26.830
just give you an idea of why this is
worthy of discussion

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:30.840
test what is one of the most ideas
modern uh... automobile dealers mate

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.229
they sell exclusively all electric cars

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:35.500
and they're doing really well by the way

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.180
there of repaying the government for the
loans at they took out

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:39.499
way ahead of schedule

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:41.570
and also doing well in sales

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:47.070
died just this last quarter they out
sold the mercedes s class the bmw seven

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.510
series and how the a

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:53.510
uh... all those are extremely well-known
extremely respected extremely luxurious

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:55.890
and well performing cars there

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.650
uh... now look we're not being sponsored
by any of them were also not being

00:01:58.650 --> 00:01:59.829
sponsored by test let

00:01:59.829 --> 00:02:03.200
although i would love to get out she
police i think that would be also

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.640
aboard don't really have

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:08.860
um... so we got this north carolina bill
i think the steve owen has something to

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.129
say about that this is a bill of attain
their

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:14.599
uh... for dead by article one section of
the constitution

00:02:14.599 --> 00:02:17.829
uh... and a corporate distaste reporting
that amendment

00:02:17.829 --> 00:02:21.579
the point is you can't make a law that
this singles out a ones

00:02:21.579 --> 00:02:24.379
one individual as we all know
corporation the people may friend ka

00:02:24.379 --> 00:02:28.819
misled anti silver have like and has a
lot of things dot roller can't

00:02:28.819 --> 00:02:32.679
you know walking the sidewalks past nine
pm that's the goal of the painter

00:02:32.679 --> 00:02:34.430
disability and he can't do it

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:36.599
it is a legal isn't unconstitutional

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:37.489
secondly

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:38.340
my god

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:42.110
the ordeal of the free market this is
the most likely says the most anti-free

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:45.440
market bill ever come to your point by
the way but the bills are tender there

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.219
being a little bit clever in the
crafting of this bill

00:02:48.219 --> 00:02:51.159
they're not saying tassel specifically
they're just saying you have to have the

00:02:51.159 --> 00:02:52.949
network of third-party dealerships

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:56.969
uh... they're not the only state by the
way that sister mandating against esler

00:02:56.969 --> 00:02:58.749
i've texas also has a bill

00:02:58.749 --> 00:03:02.069
uh... that would help to stop them from
selling

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:03.430
you cannot sell cars

00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:06.280
through dealerships there'll still rooms
at the slabs

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:10.160
uh... those specifically if you're not
one of the license third-party dealers

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:14.010
you can't sell cars to the dealerships
offer test drives or even mentioned

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:17.159
uh... cost of the car to a customer the
comes in

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:20.199
uh... but they do still allow you to
sell your cars online are they not

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:24.319
merciful now that's texas which i wonder
if carolina uh... really briefly one of

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:28.249
the reasons i hate this is that i've
recently gotten just enough money to buy

00:03:28.249 --> 00:03:32.119
an extremely cheap car and there's
nothing i hate more than a third party

00:03:32.119 --> 00:03:35.729
automobile dealers i don't see why
they're necessary we're living in twenty

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:40.509
thirteen where was so far past somebody
wandering on allotment saying what

00:03:40.509 --> 00:03:42.889
currency have will cut engine to they
have

00:03:42.889 --> 00:03:46.719
by the time you get to a ford dealer
today you know more about the cars in

00:03:46.719 --> 00:03:50.719
the dealers to i think that they have
long outlive uh... any usefulness that

00:03:50.719 --> 00:03:51.589
they have

00:03:51.589 --> 00:03:53.550
i like the test what is innovating

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:55.430
uh... and unfortunately

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:58.870
uh... if this passes a bill because
trained at least in one st

00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:02.380
i have a feeling that this will be seen
to be unconstitutional at least that's

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:02.660
my hope
