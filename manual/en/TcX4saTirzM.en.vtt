00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.520
Hey everyone. I guess I said I wanted an adventure,
so here I am in Athens!

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:20.300
Athens: a vast sea of white punctuated by
a couple tall hills, one of them the famous

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:25.420
Acropolis, standing guard over the buildings
and markets below.

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:32.140
By 10:00 a.m. the main square and surrounding
streets are busy and full, but when we arrived just

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:39.360
two hours earlier at 8:00, the place was peacefully
still and quiet. We wandered the deserted

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:46.010
streets as the shopkeepers just began to arrive
and watched as the fruit and veggie stands

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:50.430
were stocked and arranged for the day.

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.880
Athens is one of the world’s oldest cities
and reminders of this are located all throughout

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:02.050
the city in the form of ruins and ancient
Greek sites. Woven into the contemporary framework

00:01:02.050 --> 00:01:09.250
of the city, the ruins and ancient sites stand
out against and yet at the same time somehow

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:13.730
blend in with their modern surroundings.

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:22.010
From ancient stone houses to churches; unmarked
columns just hanging out along the side of

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:28.960
the road; theaters still used today, and of
course the Parthenon upon the great Acropolis,

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:34.520
the past and the present mingled together
around every corner.

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:39.790
The underground stations are no exception,
either. When digging and installing the Metro,

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:44.760
several layers of ancient sites and ruins
were discovered and parts of them ended up

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:50.810
getting incorporated into the underground
station itself, so that even they boast impressive

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:54.310
archaeological sites and information.

00:01:54.310 --> 00:02:00.040
And then of course Athens is also home to
some more recent additions, namely that of

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:05.700
graffiti and street art, which really seemed
to be everywhere around the downtown area,

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:14.160
and made me question at what point graffiti
and street art diverge from one another.

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:19.340
All that exploring made us quite hungry, but
we were in luck because it just so happened

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:25.700
that Athens has no shortage of food options.
From Greek yogurt with fresh and canned fruits

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:33.010
to breads and, of course, gyros and souvlaki,
which is what we went for. It was tasty and

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:39.300
I especially liked how they put the fries
right into the wrap for easy eating on the go.

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:45.340
Just off the main square we also stumbled
across an amazingly tempting ice cream place,

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:50.160
and I just couldn’t resist. In fact, when
I saw those ice cream sandwiches, I didn’t even try.

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:57.140
With graham cracker cookie pieces, chocolate
ice cream, and vanilla ice cream sandwiched

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:04.270
between two brownie-like cookies...uhm, it
was so good, so good that we came back for

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:07.270
another one the next day too!

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:12.290
But even more than the ice cream, one of my
favorite things in Athens, apart from the

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:19.100
historical sites, was exploring and meandering
around and getting lost in the narrow streets

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:24.700
between the white washed houses just below
the Acropolis. This area was first inhabited

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:30.569
by people from the island of Anafi, and they
basically recreated the houses of their home

00:03:30.569 --> 00:03:36.509
here in Athens, so this area really had that
Greek islands feel to it.

00:03:36.509 --> 00:03:44.540
And while we did see some dogs hanging out
in the city, it was clearly, clearly the cats

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:53.090
that ran the show in Athens.

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:58.390
The cats, and the kittens.

00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:04.740
Another place that fascinated me in Athens
was the Ancient Agora. "Agora" means gathering

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:10.370
place or assembly, and was a central place
in Ancient Greek cities. At first the agora

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:16.629
was a place for political discussions and
city-related announcements, but it later became

00:04:16.629 --> 00:04:22.740
a marketplace area for buying and trading
goods. In its heyday, the Ancient Agora here

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:29.080
in Athens was a busy, bustling place full
of covered shops, and frequented by many of

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:34.320
the great minds such as Socrates, Plato, and
Aristotle.

00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:41.840
Today it’s full of ruins. Impressive ruins,
but ruins nonetheless.

00:04:41.849 --> 00:04:49.409
Athens is also home to not one, but two Olympic
stadiums, one from the first modern Olympic

00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:55.969
Games in 1896, which is the only stadium in
the world constructed entirely out of marble,

00:04:55.969 --> 00:04:59.949
and the newer stadium used in the 2004 Summer
Olympics.

00:04:59.949 --> 00:05:05.309
Just in front of the Parliament Building in
Syntagma Square are the Presidential Guards,

00:05:05.309 --> 00:05:15.360
guarding the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier.
While they do do a small post change every

00:05:15.369 --> 00:05:20.939
single hour, which is what we saw, the main
changing of the guards event takes place on

00:05:20.939 --> 00:05:27.520
Sunday at 11:00 a.m. But even the smaller
hourly events were pretty impressive and drew

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:35.600
a pretty large crowd.

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:45.740
With so many diverse areas and something either
historical or cultural or just plain beautiful

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:54.620
seemingly around every corner, Athens really
impressed and amazed me.

00:05:54.620 --> 00:06:00.280
I will put links down below to everything
I can, from the AthenStyle Hostel, which has

00:06:00.289 --> 00:06:06.189
a great rooftop bar you just saw and offers
information and tours and activities in Athens;

00:06:06.189 --> 00:06:12.589
as well as a link to Hotel Nafsika a lovely
hotel outside the city center. And I’ll

00:06:12.589 --> 00:06:17.889
also link in there restaurants we ate at,
that ice cream place, and other information

00:06:17.889 --> 00:06:22.189
on the city.

00:06:22.189 --> 00:06:25.639

Facebook page for more updates and photos
from the trip. Until next time, auf Wiedersehen!

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.860
Oh, I just also wanted to say that there were
lots of public restrooms in Athens. So no

00:06:41.869 --> 00:06:45.019
worrying about finding a toilet; lots of toilet
options.
