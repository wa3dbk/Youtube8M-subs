Hi this is Colin from GIGABYTE

00:00:12.405 --> 00:00:14.016
With the new launch of our new Z68 Motherboards

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:17.020
We have name of a new technology call Intel Smart Response technology

00:00:18.064 --> 00:00:20.500
So basically what this is

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:24.968
It allows people to use a lower capacity SSD as well as traditional hard drive 

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.095
To get complete total system wide performance 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.043
As if there were using higher capacity SSD

00:00:32.044 --> 00:00:34.044
So in front of me here I have a new system

00:00:34.691 --> 00:00:36.691
That I’ve just built

00:00:36.944 --> 00:00:37.950
And I got two hard drives in front of me

00:00:38.104 --> 00:00:41.700
The first one here is Intel Larson Creek 20GB SSD

00:00:42.934 --> 00:00:44.934
And I also have a traditional hard drive 

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:50.240
Now what I want to show is actually installing Intel Smart Response Technology

00:00:51.126 --> 00:00:54.500
But as you’ll see it will require many different steps

00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.000
And is kind of complicate process for most users

00:00:57.578 --> 00:01:00.578
So in front of me here I have our new GIGABYTE Touch Bios

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.920
This is our new utility that allow users to make BIOS changes in the windows OS

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:08.920
So as you can see here the system  is set up in to IDE mode

00:01:10.589 --> 00:01:12.589
So what I’m going to do is I’m going to click out of here 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:14.457
And I’m going to try to install Intel Smart Response Technology

00:01:17.137 --> 00:01:19.137
So as you can see here that application has started it

00:01:19.915 --> 00:01:22.400
But as you can see: ‘This computer does not meet the minimum requirements’

00:01:22.593 --> 00:01:26.900
Now that's because as I said before this system is in IDE mode

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Now what we have to do is change this to RAID mode

00:01:30.256 --> 00:01:32.256
But as any of you who set up RAID before knows

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:37.460
You have to re-install the OS completely in order to able this new function

00:01:38.274 --> 00:01:43.270
So of course this is going to take you a long time to install Intel Smart Response Technology

00:01:43.956 --> 00:01:45.960
So what GIGABYTE has done is

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.350
we've created a new utility that actually allows you to set up your system in to RAID mode

00:01:51.985 --> 00:01:54.980
As well as automatically install Intel Smart Response Technology

00:01:55.929 --> 00:01:57.930
Just by clicking the utility here

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:01.050
So now I'm going to enable this new technology

00:02:02.013 --> 00:02:04.010
The system is going to go to through several re-boots

00:02:04.358 --> 00:02:09.360
So the first re-boot is going to the bios and enable the system into RAID mode

00:02:10.843 --> 00:02:13.840
Is going to re-boot and then go and install Intel Smart Response Technology

00:02:15.767 --> 00:02:17.770
So I’m going to quickly do that and I’ll show you the process

00:02:17.929 --> 00:02:19.930
But of course its goanna take a little time

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.570
So we are going to fast forward the speed a little bit

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:26.690
So as you can see here

00:02:26.893 --> 00:02:29.900
‘The system will be set in to RAID mode and the system will re-set when it's done’

00:02:30.938 --> 00:02:32.940
So all you have to do is click continue

00:03:08.526 --> 00:03:10.530
So there you have it

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:11.220
So it’s gone through to the re-boot process

00:03:11.501 --> 00:03:14.500
And now it has automatically installed Intel Rapid Storage Technology

00:03:15.746 --> 00:03:17.750
Now this has included Intel Smart Response

00:03:18.788 --> 00:03:23.790
So as you can see here Intel Smart Response Technology is now enabled

00:03:24.476 --> 00:03:26.480
So there you have it

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.500
GIGABYTE new Easy Smart Response Technology utility 

00:03:30.226 --> 00:03:33.800
Allows users to very quickly enable Intel Smart Response Technology 

00:03:34.668 --> 00:03:37.200
Without having to re-install the OS

00:03:37.284 --> 00:03:39.900
So this has save users a lot of time and hassle

00:03:40.359 --> 00:03:42.360
Having set up their system
