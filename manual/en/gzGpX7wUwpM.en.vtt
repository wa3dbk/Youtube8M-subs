00:00:00.063 --> 00:00:03.669
- Hey guys, so growing up with
an Italian-American father,

00:00:03.669 --> 00:00:06.223
Easter time for me always meant cannolis.

00:00:06.223 --> 00:00:07.733
If you're not familiar with a cannoli,

00:00:07.733 --> 00:00:10.168
it is a delicious Italian pastry

00:00:10.168 --> 00:00:13.143
filled with sweetened ricotta
and mascarpone cheese.

00:00:13.143 --> 00:00:15.163
So a few years ago, my
dad and I got together

00:00:15.163 --> 00:00:17.833
and we thought, "Let's try
to make cannolis ourself."

00:00:17.833 --> 00:00:19.776
Because on the west coast,
it can really be hard

00:00:19.776 --> 00:00:22.678
to find a good Italian
bakery that sells cannolis.

00:00:22.678 --> 00:00:25.196
So the good news was that the
cream was really easy to do

00:00:25.196 --> 00:00:26.612
and was delicious.

00:00:26.612 --> 00:00:28.847
Homemade cannoli cream, nothing compares,

00:00:28.847 --> 00:00:31.837
however, making the shells
was a bit of an undertaking.

00:00:31.837 --> 00:00:33.462
We had to drag out the pasta machine

00:00:33.462 --> 00:00:35.854
and roll out the dough,
deep fry the shells.

00:00:35.854 --> 00:00:37.990
It took forever and at the end of the day,

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:39.616
they weren't even that good (chuckling).

00:00:39.616 --> 00:00:40.590
They were too hard.

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:42.401
So after that little fiasco, I figured

00:00:42.401 --> 00:00:44.166
there had to be an easier way.

00:00:44.166 --> 00:00:45.605
So I took my love of cannolis

00:00:45.605 --> 00:00:48.090
and merged it with my
newfound French influence,

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.413
coming from my husband's family,

00:00:49.413 --> 00:00:51.875
and developed the cannoli Napoleon.

00:00:51.875 --> 00:00:54.080
It takes this dessert
to a whole other level

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:55.613
and it couldn't be easier to do.

00:00:55.613 --> 00:00:57.939
We're first gonna create
our Napoleon layers.

00:00:57.939 --> 00:01:00.376
You're gonna take some
store bought puff pastry,

00:01:00.376 --> 00:01:04.483
roll it out and cut 3" to 4" rectangles.

00:01:04.483 --> 00:01:06.851
Transfer them to a
parchment lined cookie sheet

00:01:06.851 --> 00:01:08.685
and then you are going to bake

00:01:08.685 --> 00:01:10.543
for about 10 to 12 minutes,

00:01:10.543 --> 00:01:12.168
just until they are golden brown.

00:01:12.168 --> 00:01:14.235
Now one word of advice
when it comes to serving

00:01:14.235 --> 00:01:16.046
individual desserts like this,

00:01:16.046 --> 00:01:17.299
I don't know about your house,

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:19.691
but in our house we always
get a last minute guest

00:01:19.691 --> 00:01:20.991
and I always get into a panic

00:01:20.991 --> 00:01:22.615
that I'm not gonna have enough dessert,

00:01:22.615 --> 00:01:24.519
so in order to just cover my bases,

00:01:24.519 --> 00:01:26.400
I always make one extra.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.368
The worst thing that can happen

00:01:27.368 --> 00:01:28.838
is you have one extra dessert

00:01:28.838 --> 00:01:30.254
that somebody can eat the next day.

00:01:30.254 --> 00:01:31.392
While your layers are baking,

00:01:31.392 --> 00:01:32.451
you're then gonna get on

00:01:32.451 --> 00:01:34.433
with making your cannoli cream.

00:01:34.433 --> 00:01:36.926
So you're gonna take
whole milk ricotta cheese,

00:01:36.926 --> 00:01:38.637
I really think the whole milk works better

00:01:38.637 --> 00:01:40.911
than the skim milk or the nonfat ricotta.

00:01:40.911 --> 00:01:43.233
It's a dessert after all,
so go for the full fat.

00:01:43.233 --> 00:01:45.853
To that you're gonna add
the mascarpone cheese

00:01:45.853 --> 00:01:47.343
and your powdered sugar.

00:01:47.343 --> 00:01:49.038
You don't even need an electric mixer.

00:01:49.038 --> 00:01:50.524
You can just whisk this all up

00:01:50.524 --> 00:01:51.778
with a wooden spoon.

00:01:51.778 --> 00:01:54.027
Then you're gonna add some vanilla

00:01:54.027 --> 00:01:56.023
and some orange zest.

00:01:56.023 --> 00:01:58.001
Give that a good mix until combined

00:01:58.001 --> 00:02:01.135
and basically, your cannoli
cream, at this stage, is done.

00:02:01.135 --> 00:02:02.669
Now if you're making
this dessert for a party,

00:02:02.669 --> 00:02:04.781
you can do some of this the day before.

00:02:04.781 --> 00:02:06.615
So you can make your cannoli cream,

00:02:06.615 --> 00:02:08.937
cover it with foil and
pop it in the fridge.

00:02:08.937 --> 00:02:11.561
However, I would wait to
make the Napoleon layers

00:02:11.561 --> 00:02:12.675
the day of.

00:02:12.675 --> 00:02:14.139
Puff pastry is really at it's best

00:02:14.139 --> 00:02:15.601
when it's nice and flaky

00:02:15.601 --> 00:02:17.760
and so you want it to
be as fresh as possible.

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:19.060
Then when it's time to serve,

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.031
you're gonna take your cannoli cream,

00:02:21.031 --> 00:02:24.606
transfer it to a pastry
bag fitted with a star tip.

00:02:24.606 --> 00:02:27.122
You're gonna take one of
your puff pastry sheets

00:02:27.122 --> 00:02:29.509
and pipe out a layer of cannoli cream.

00:02:29.509 --> 00:02:30.879
On top of that, you're gonna add

00:02:30.879 --> 00:02:32.725
your chopped pistachios

00:02:32.725 --> 00:02:35.100
and your chopped semi-sweet chocolate.

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:36.451
You're gonna cover with another layer

00:02:36.451 --> 00:02:37.958
of puff pastry

00:02:37.958 --> 00:02:39.145
and then dust the whole thing

00:02:39.145 --> 00:02:40.367
with powdered sugar.

00:02:40.367 --> 00:02:43.069
And you will see, you will have
one elegant looking dessert

00:02:43.069 --> 00:02:44.694
that is so delicious.

00:02:44.694 --> 00:02:46.807
It is over the top, I promise.

00:02:46.807 --> 00:02:48.840
So I hope you guys give this one a try

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.243
and let me know what you think.

00:02:50.243 --> 00:02:52.099
I think you'll find it'll soon become

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:53.842
one of your favorite go-to desserts

00:02:53.842 --> 00:02:55.561
that's perfect for entertaining.

00:02:55.561 --> 00:02:56.838
It takes minutes to put together

00:02:56.838 --> 00:02:58.556
and it will always impress a crowd.

00:02:58.556 --> 00:02:59.245
I'll see you next time

00:02:59.245 --> 00:03:00.168
when I'm gonna teach you

00:03:00.168 --> 00:03:02.201
how to make my full-proof homemade crepes.

00:03:02.201 --> 00:03:03.571
I'll see you then.

00:03:03.571 --> 00:03:04.752
