Hi! I am Dr. Adrienne Mulligan and I am the
owner of Camp Verde Veterinary Clinic and

00:00:06.399 --> 00:00:16.610
I am here today on behalf of expertvillage.com
to talk to you about cat first aid and administration

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:22.560
of medications. Another way to deal with ear
mites if they are diagnosed as ear mites is

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:30.920
a product called Revolution. Revolution is
a little liquid that comes in a pouch, that

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:44.880
you have to open it out of the pouch, and
it is a liquid in a plastic holder and I will

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:52.230
show you how to open it, but then we are going
to put all of this on to his skin and the

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:59.940
best place to put it on a cat is at the back
of their skull right between the ears, so

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:06.600
the label will actually tell you near the
shoulder blades, but a longtime ago, the first

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.900
product of this type was Advantage and they
did some studies and found that it worked

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:17.420
better in cats if you put it up here and they
determined that cats probably get to it down

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:22.909
here more easily and I have always sort of
held to the belief that we should put it closer

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:30.760
to the skull, so that is what I do. And you
want to spread the fur and get it right down

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:35.869
on to the skin and then you do not want to
rub it or touch it because you want it to

00:01:35.869 --> 00:01:40.310
do what it is going to do and it will spread
all over the body and go in through the little

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:50.600
capillaries and it will kill ear mites. It
will kill fleas and ticks for a month and

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:59.070
also in cats de-worm them as well. So it does
many things and it prevents heart worm, that

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:06.990
is another thing heart worm disease, soâ€¦
now, so what I do is get kind of as close

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:15.480
to that back of the skull as I can and I spread
the fur and I place this and they do not like

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:26.739
it when they feel the liquid, I just want
to get liquid down on to their in little different

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:40.469
spots if you need to but just make sure you
are getting it on the skin. And

00:02:40.469 --> 00:02:46.900
you empty all of it on to the kitty and then
just do not do anything with it and it will

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:51.700
dry within about two hours and they will be
absorbed and they will do its work and it

00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:56.629
will last for a month and that ?? (0250) all
you need to do to treat the ear mites.
