Song By / ONE OK ROCK

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:28.140
"The Beginning"

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:35.060
Just give me a reason to keep my heart beating

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:40.400
Don't worry it's safe right here in my arms

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:44.340
As the world falls apart around us

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.480
All we can do is hold on

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:51.900
Hold on

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:57.880
Take my hand

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:03.280
and bring me back

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.240
I'll risk everything if it's for you

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.960
a whisper into the night

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.140
Telling me it's not my time and don't give up

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.180
I've never stood up before this time

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.700
でも 譲れないもの

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:34.440
握ったこの手は離さない

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.140
So Stand up stand up

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:37.200
Just gotta keep it

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.700
I wanna wake up wake up

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:40.100
Just tell me how I can

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:41.500
Never give up

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.720
狂おしいほど刹那の艶麗

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:46.000
Just tell me why baby

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.840
They might call me crazy

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:54.080
for saying I'll fight until there is no more

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.240
愁いを含んだ閃光

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.820
眼光は感覚的衝動

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:04.640
Blinded I can't see the end

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:09.200
so where do I begin

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.120
Say not a word I can hear you

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.960
The silence between us

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:37.880
なにもないように映ってるだけ

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:41.980
I'll take this chance and I'll make it mine

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.460
ただ隠せないもの

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.220
飾ったように見せかけてる

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:49.940
So Stand up stand up

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:51.020
Just gotta keep it

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:52.640
I wanna wake up wake up

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:53.980
Just tell me how I can

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.400
Never give up

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:57.540
悲しみと切なさの艶麗

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:02.640
Just give me a reason to keep my heart beating

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:08.060
Don't worry it's safe right here in my arms

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:11.080
くだけて泣いて咲いて

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:14.340
散ったこの思いは

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.560
so blinded I can't see the end

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:21.420
Look how far we've made it

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:24.280
The pain I can't escape it

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.700
このままじゃまだ

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:30.780
終わらせる事は出来ないでしょ

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:34.560
何度くたばりそうでも

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.100
朽ち果てようとも

00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.420
終わりはないさ

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:44.100
so where do I begin

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:06.140
握りしめた

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:08.720
失わぬようにと…

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:14.020
手を広げればこぼれ落ちそうで

00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:17.740
失うものなどなかった

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:22.080
日々の惰性を捨てて

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:24.560
君を…

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:27.140
Just tell me why baby

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:29.720
They might call me crazy

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:34.960
for saying I'll fight until there is no more

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:38.120
愁いを含んだ閃光

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:41.720
眼光は感覚的衝動

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:45.680
Blinded I can't see the end

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:48.440
Look how far we've made it

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:51.720
The pain I can't escape it

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:53.900
このままじゃまだ

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:57.800
終わらせる事は出来ないでしょ

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:01.720
何度くたばりそうでも

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:04.040
朽ち果てようとも

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:06.660
終わりはないさ

00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:12.020
It finally begins
