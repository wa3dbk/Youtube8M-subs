00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:08.470
Today on our 2008 Acura MDX, we'll be installing
the Curt Hitch, part number 13354.

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:11.360
Here are a couple measurements that will assist
you in selecting accessories for your new

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:14.870
hitch such as a drawbar, a bike rack, or a
cargo carrier.

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:18.470
From the center of the hitch pin hole to the
outermost edge of the bumper is 4 inches.

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:22.170
From the top of the receiver tube to the ground
is 16 inches.

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.550
Now, let's go ahead with the installation.

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:27.680
Before we begin our installation, we've already
gone ahead and removed the spare tire.

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:31.780
Next, before we can install the hitch, we'll
need to go ahead and lower the exhaust and

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:33.739
remove the muffler heat shield.

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:38.550
First, before we lower the exhaust, we'll
pull a safety strap underneath so we can control

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:43.720
how far and fast the exhaust will fall once
we remove the rubber isolators.

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:47.800
On each side, there will be one on the in-board
side of the muffler and one on the outward

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:54.380
side of the muffler.

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:57.470
We'll spray down the hangers with some spray
lubricant and then we'll use a pry bar to

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:02.290
remove them.

00:01:02.290 --> 00:02:17.879
Now with the rubber isolators removed, we
can go ahead and use 

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:45.599
our 
safety strap 

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:47.749
to lower the exhaust.
