hello namaste

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.849
salaamwalekum satsriyakaal;  welcome back to another session with your VahChef at

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:17.580
Vahrehvah.com. Today we're going to make orange flavored tea biscuits so

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.080
let's go ahead and make this for this
take 150 grams of butter

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:28.769
and add 75 grams of powdered sugar and
then mix this to nice creamy

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:33.989
consistency look at this, this is very
nicely creamed;  in this add one egg add

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:39.510
little by little and mix this till it is nicely mixed and creamy do not add

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.500
the entire egg in one go just add little by little that way this mixture

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.059
will not curdle, now in this add orange essence, if you do not have orange

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:55.140
essence you can also add almond essence, in this add 225 grams of flour and mix this to

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.449
a nice smooth consistency because we're
going to use this for piping;  one has to

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:05.100
understand what is a piping consistency
see if this is too thick then you will

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:10.590
not be able to pipe if it is too soft
then the cookies won't come out good so

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:15.240
if it is too thick you can always add a
little more of a beaten egg into this if

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:19.290
you follow the recipe more or less you
will get the perfect piping consistency

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:24.960
but sometimes if you use a smaller egg
the dough maybe slightly tough then just

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.829
beat little more of egg and add to this
and mix it with a nice piping

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:34.200
consistency. Now take a piping bag and
these are very good disposable kind of

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:40.200
piping bags and fill this mixture inside
this sometimes i find it easy to take

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.600
this piping back into a Jug like this and spread the piping back on the

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.610
rim of this jack and then fill this up
because they are transparent piping bags

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.920
you can also see any air gaps and then
just twist the top edges and then you

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:01.500
will be able to pipe them easily and in
a circular motion just pipe it, if the

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:04.860
mixture is too tight you can add a
little bit of egg or even few drops of

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:10.349
milk to make the mixture soft;  because i
do not have candid peel you can always put

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:11.670
a candid peel on top

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:12.960
what I did is, I took the

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:18.810
fresh skin of the orange and then just
cut them in juliannes put them little bit

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:24.600
of sugar on top and then just made my
own preparation and then just put this

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:30.750
fine strips of fresh orange skin you know do not put too much of it

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:35.010
on each cookie; just a little bit of this on each cookie will make these

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:40.230
cookies very flavorful. Back these cookies like all the cookies at 180

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:43.320
degrees centigrade for around 12 to 15
minutes.

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:48.900
Look at these cookies you know such a
nice golden crust on all these edges and

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:55.080
these fine orange skin has nicely
caramelized and has a nice fantastic

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:56.940
flavor,  with every bite

00:02:56.940 --> 00:03:01.230
these tea biscuits are fantastic,  i hope
