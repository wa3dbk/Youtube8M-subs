00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:16.220
- What’s that?
- A bat!

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.220
Get down, keep down!

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:23.970
It’s casing the joint,
let’s see what it’s up to!

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:30.360
Let’s get under the bed.

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:32.690
Go away, beastly bat!

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:35.150
Don't say that.

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:39.570
You'll offend it if you call it a
beastly bar, you've got to be nice.

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:45.160
Oh bat, sweet creature of the night,

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.210
you'll find the window on your right!

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:53.130
"What luck!"

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.420
That’s what poetry's all about,
you called it a beastly bat...

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:58.970
It always works.

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:01.760
I was shaving in the bathroom yesterday.

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:03.310
A spider climbed in

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:06.140
and I said to it,
"Spider dear, get out of here".

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.810
- It went!
- And if you find a mouse?

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:13.230
"Mr. Mouse, leave this house"
then run for it.

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:16.110
Will you teach me to write nice poems?

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.900
How did you become a poet?

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:20.240
How do you start?

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:24.370
I was small, younger than you are now,
eight or nine.

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:28.790
I was with my mother,
I loved her so much...

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:34.290
We were at Uncle Giustino's
and there was a wood.

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.760
- Do you know what happened?
- What?

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:44.760
A little bird flew by,
singing, flying lower...

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:47.520
and lower.

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.560
He landed right here on my shoulder.

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:56.440
I swear!

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:58.990
He'd chosen me, of all people.

00:01:59.150 --> 00:02:02.570
I was afraid he'd fly away,
so I pretended to be a tree,

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:04.490
I didn't move a muscle.

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.500
I started to feel my heart beating,
thumping actually.

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:17.960
- And then?
- It flew away.

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:20.630
I wanted to tell my mother.

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:24.970
"Mamma, a little bird, flying and singing...

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:29.220
landed on my shoulder
and sat there for an hour. "

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:33.650
She said, "I thought something awful
happened" and carried on chatting.

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.650
That was mean of Granny,
didn't she like birds?

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:40.360
No, Granny wasn't mean,
and she did like little birds.

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.410
It wasn't her, it was me.

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:46.910
It was my fault for not telling
the story properly,

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.330
for not making her feel what I'd felt.

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:53.000
I was so upset I told myself,

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:57.340
"There must be people whose job
it is to use the right words,

00:02:57.670 --> 00:02:59.760
put things in a way...

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.510
who when their hearts beats,
can get other people's hearts to beat. "

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:06.260
That day I decided to become a poet.

00:03:07.470 --> 00:03:11.680
- My heart beat.
- Mine too, but Granny's didn't.

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:15.190
If the words aren't right, nothing's right.

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:19.690
If I say now, "go to sleep",
those are the right words.

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:23.450
- And if another bat comes in?
- Off to bed with you.

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:26.070
I've got to get you to school
at 9:00 tomorrow.

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:27.700
At 8:30!

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:31.700
I know.
