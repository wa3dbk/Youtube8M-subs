00:00:12.045 --> 00:00:15.265
So where are the others?

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:18.702
So they didn’t come out yet?

00:00:18.785 --> 00:00:22.339
Hey, by the way, those glasses…
4
00:00:26,093 --&gt; 00:00:15,350
Oh, nothing. It was rude of me to ask.

00:00:29.997 --> 00:00:33.934
By the way, did Asbel go on ahead without us?

00:00:34.034 --> 00:00:37.621
No, Asbel always likes to be late

00:00:37.638 --> 00:00:41.124
It seems that Cheria and the others are also late

00:00:41.208 --> 00:00:43.894
Sorry to keep you waiting

00:00:56.957 --> 00:01:00.093
H…how is it? Does it look good?

00:01:00.194 --> 00:01:03.463
It’s a little embarrassing. Aha…ha…

00:01:04.765 --> 00:01:09.052
Is it that embarrassing considering your usual attire?

00:01:09.169 --> 00:01:12.523
No~ It’s not a problem

00:01:12.539 --> 00:01:16.360
Besides what’s wrong with my usual clothes!?

00:01:16.527 --> 00:01:19.796
Kopo, kopo, kopo, kopo

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.151
What is it Pascal? Why are you wearing such a strange suit?

00:01:24.251 --> 00:01:27.871
Those words, I’ll return them to you entirely

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:33.694
I tried to stop her

00:01:35.379 --> 00:01:39.166
Oh yes, other than that, do you find Sophie’s swimsuit cute?

00:01:39.283 --> 00:01:42.536
Nya~ Hubert, Instuctor.

00:01:42.803 --> 00:01:46.540
Oh, it’s not cute. It’s a cat isn’t it?

00:01:47.658 --> 00:01:50.594
Yes, a mating season cat.

00:01:50.667 --> 00:01:54.364
J- Just a minute, what are you talking about, Sophie!?

00:01:54.448 --> 00:01:58.385
This is… you don’t mean Cheria inspired this?

00:01:58.485 --> 00:02:01.755
T-That’s not it!

00:02:01.855 --> 00:02:05.592
I’m sorry I made a mistake. It’s a growing season cat.

00:02:05.692 --> 00:02:09.112
Ah, a big mistake. Just be careful.

00:02:09.329 --> 00:02:12.015
Yes, instructor

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:14.985
The instructor is the perpetrator…

00:02:15.068 --> 00:02:17.888
Just when…

00:02:18.772 --> 00:02:22.192
Hey, how come Asbel didn’t come back yet?

00:02:22.292 --> 00:02:25.762
I was a little too late to say it wasn’t I…

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.666
Instructor…?

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:33.036
Now how are we going to do the flirting contest?

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.523
Wait, where are you going with this!?

00:02:36.623 --> 00:02:39.693
Cheria, are you alright?

00:02:39.793 --> 00:02:42.396
Huh?

00:02:42.396 --> 00:02:47.234
You are lacking sex appeal. Right now Asbel doesn’t seem to notice you at all.

00:02:47.351 --> 00:02:51.021
J-Just wait, I’m not… it’s not like that

00:02:51.104 --> 00:02:55.025
But, the good thing is that there’s still time before he comes

00:02:55.042 --> 00:02:59.663
Polish up your sexiness, Cheria. Make that guy notice what a good girl you are!

00:02:59.746 --> 00:03:02.482
Y-Yes!

00:03:02.583 --> 00:03:05.319
Kopo, kopo

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:09.756
J-Just what exactly is this…

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:12.543
Mating Season…

00:03:15.913 --> 00:03:19.449
Well now, in order to flirt you need to-

00:03:19.553 --> 00:03:23.921
Wait a moment. Why are all of you flirting?

00:03:23.937 --> 00:03:27.140
I definitely won’t.

00:03:27.241 --> 00:03:30.794
It can’t be helped. Well then, Cheria do your best.

00:03:30.894 --> 00:03:35.632
T-that was a sudden “do your best.” So are you going to teach me how to be a good woman?

00:03:35.716 --> 00:03:38.986
A man wouldn’t understand what he’s thinking

00:03:40.487 --> 00:03:43.707
Cheria, do your best

00:03:44.358 --> 00:03:47.117
Kopo Kopo

00:03:47.728 --> 00:03:50.797
Fight, Cheria!

00:03:50.914 --> 00:03:53.617
Even Sophie…

00:03:53.634 --> 00:03:57.454
Oh, fine. I understand! I’ll do it.

00:04:02.943 --> 00:04:05.679
U-um…

00:04:06.847 --> 00:04:10.167
Oh what? Are you trying to flirt with me?

00:04:10.184 --> 00:04:14.238
Seriously this is the best. This is the first time someone flirted with me!

00:04:14.254 --> 00:04:17.574
So how are we going to go out together?

00:04:17.591 --> 00:04:20.677
Or, do you want to get married?

00:04:20.761 --> 00:04:24.848
N-no… this is… I got the wrong person! Sorry~

00:04:28.335 --> 00:04:32.289
Haa haa… That didn’t seem like a successful flirt at all! 

00:04:32.372 --> 00:04:35.959
Where? That guy just had a misunderstanding with you 

00:04:35.976 --> 00:04:40.197
Don’t tempt your opponent.  Your true enemy is Asbel.

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:42.900
Oof…

00:04:42.983 --> 00:04:50.440
At the least, is it impossible for you to try and put some of your sexiness in your effort?
71
00:04:47,688 --&gt; 00:03:53,500
Sexiness…

00:04:50.524 --> 00:04:53.327
Kopo Kopo

00:04:53.427 --> 00:04:56.246
Boldy, or…

00:04:56.330 --> 00:05:00.284
Well, you see… Cheria more… that… 

00:05:00.367 --> 00:05:03.854
That’s enough, Sophie. No more.

00:05:04.438 --> 00:05:08.926
I can’t believe I am taking advice from Sophie, I think I might just cry… 

00:05:09.009 --> 00:05:12.796
Irresponsible, if Asbel comes he’ll think this is funny 

00:05:12.813 --> 00:05:16.900
Next is the last of your feelings. Cast away that shyness.

00:05:16.984 --> 00:05:19.736
Y-yes!

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:23.974
I’ll definitely show off my bold sexiness for Asbel to see

00:05:24.057 --> 00:05:27.344
A woman’s courage! I’ll do my best!

00:05:32.766 --> 00:05:37.187
Hey there ♥ I hope that you are having a super vacation?

00:05:38.071 --> 00:05:41.608
Yeah. You just can’t do it Cheria 

00:05:41.708 --> 00:05:44.595
Kopo Kopo?!

00:05:44.678 --> 00:05:48.165
Eh, is that so. Now, she’s showing her potential.

00:05:48.248 --> 00:05:51.401
That’s, sexy

00:05:54.054 --> 00:05:57.608
Um… What are you doing… Cheria?

00:05:59.693 --> 00:06:02.513
A-a-ah…

00:06:05.165 --> 00:06:08.051
(Cheria screaming)

00:06:12.840 --> 00:06:16.126
Everything, it’s the instructor’s fault!

00:06:17.644 --> 00:06:21.398
Heh… Failing when you’re young can come in handy later

00:06:21.481 --> 00:06:25.502
Just when! You should have said that earlier!

00:06:25.586 --> 00:06:28.805
Well, that was fun.

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:32.843
No it wasn’t…

00:06:35.929 --> 00:06:39.950
Why was Asbel there in the first place!

00:06:41.468 --> 00:06:45.155
Why… I was looking for you guys

00:06:45.239 --> 00:06:49.393
The normally late Asbel being first! I can’t believe it!
