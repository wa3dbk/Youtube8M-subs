00:00:00.539 --> 00:00:02.600
Welcome to ToysReviewToys everyone.

00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:06.100
Today we're going to show off the town of
Radiator Springs.

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:11.900
Radiator Springs is a peaceful little town
where nothing could possibli, I mean possibly

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:12.960
go wrong.

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:19.040
First we're going to start at the Cozy Cone
which is a sweet little...what is that thing?

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:20.770
Is that the Hulk?

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:30.770
This could mean trouble!

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:49.760
(Rock music)

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:50.760
What happened?

00:00:50.760 --> 00:01:04.110
The whole town's been destroyed!

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:05.110
It gets worse.

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:08.030
They left Red's garage door open.

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:10.630
Who could do this?

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:13.180
Guys have you seen my tire shop?

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:14.680
It's ruined.

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:18.360
My Cozy Cone is also completely destroyed.

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.960
The same goes for my junk yard.

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.020
It never did look that great, but now it's
worse!

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.220
Who would've wanted to destroy the whole town.

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:34.120
I don't know, maybe it...wait a minute.

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:35.120
Uh oh.

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:36.850
Have any of you seen Guido?

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:40.130
Yeah, he served me my drink earlier at Wheel
Well.

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:44.560
When I told him it was the wrong one, he appeared
to be mad and drove off really fast.

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:46.200
Uh oh.

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:53.350
Well, Guido's usually so happy he wouldn't
hurt a bug, but when he gets upset, watch

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:54.350
out!

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:56.240
He turns all green and goes crazy.

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.280
Hello, pit stop!

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:03.979
Hello Guido, how's it going?

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:10.099
Guido, did you get upset and do your green
rampage through the town?

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:11.099
Me?

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:12.109
No.

00:02:12.109 --> 00:02:15.829
Guido, it's time you do some anger management
training.

00:02:15.829 --> 00:02:17.629
Welcome to anger management.

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:24.819
Pacer, before we share our feelings, I'm going
to need you to lower the blow torch.

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:27.580
