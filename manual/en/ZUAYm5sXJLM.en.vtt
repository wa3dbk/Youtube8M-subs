00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:15.170
Volkswagen Car-Net offers you a variety of
ways to connect remotely to your car, using

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:19.810
a Smartphone, tablet, computer, or by calling
the Car-Net Response Center.

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:23.160
But Volkswagen vehicles are all about being
driven.

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:27.710
So let's begin by reviewing some of the features
and functions of Car-Net that can be accessed

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:29.570
from inside the car.

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:34.199
First of all, you'll see the three-button
control panel in the overhead console.

00:00:34.199 --> 00:00:39.350
The green LED indicates that Car-Net has been
activated and it is operational.

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:45.030
Pressing the "i" information button connects
you with a Car-Net Customer Specialist.

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:51.220
"Hello, and thank you for contacting the Volkswagen
Car-Net Response Center.

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:52.220
This is Shannon; how may I help you today?"

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:55.670
Available 24 hours a day, the live operator
can send destination directions directly to

00:00:55.670 --> 00:01:00.190
your Volkswagen Navigation System, which is
a helpful feature when you're navigating in

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:03.470
a new city or when you just need some assistance.

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:07.740
If you get a flat tire or have another problem
with your vehicle, there is no faster way

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.830
to get assistance than by simply pushing the
Car-Net "wrench" button.

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:15.250
You're connected immediately to Volkswagen
Roadside Assistance.

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:19.360
One of the advantages of pressing the Car-Net
"wrench" button (over calling roadside assistance

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:25.360
with your cellphone) is your vehicle's exact
location is sent along with diagnostic information

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:28.610
to help insure prompt and accurate assistance.

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:32.440
No more walking down the road, looking for
a mile marker, or trying to guess how many

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:35.040
miles you travelled past the last major crossroad.

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:40.370
The next in-car Car-Net feature that we're
going to look at is one that you don't have

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:44.590
to push a button to activate, and I hope that
you never require it.

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:46.110
It's Automatic Crash Notification.

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:51.020
If there is no response from the vehicle,
the Car-Net Emergency Specialist contacts

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.229
the authorities to dispatch help to your exact
location.

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:58.890
If you have a medical emergency, or if you
want to alert the authorities about another

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:04.530
unsafe issue, you can also access a Car-Net
Response Center Emergency Specialist by pressing

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.369
the red "SOS" button in the overhead console.

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:12.760
This places an emergency call to an emergency
specialist who will confirm the nature of

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.620
the emergency and connect you with local authorities.

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:21.639
Your vehicle location is transmitted automatically
when you press the "SOS" button.

00:02:21.639 --> 00:02:27.280
With Car-Net's in-car functions, you're always
connected, helping to keep you safe and secure.
