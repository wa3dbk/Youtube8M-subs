00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:17.440
Well, hello, dear friends, we are already…

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:18.060
Wassup!

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.440
As you can see, we are at the Sand Banks Hotel…

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:22.980
The same location as yesterday…

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:26.070
Yep, the same location as yesterday, you can see our balcony over there.

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.780
And we are waiting for our taxi to go to the Bovington Tank Museum.

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:45.160
Here we are.

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:50.530
At Bovington, and you see a large number of vehicles here, 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:53.500
and we shoot a British TD, the FV, while approaching.

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.450
To be honest, we… There, there, see, lots of vehicles! 

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:59.210
And this is how many people we have here.

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:02.460
Look, crowds of people. That’s fantastic! 

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:05.180
That’s really a full house, guys! 

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.360
I don’t know what it will all look like in the evening, 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:11.070
but now it’s morning and you can see people everywhere.

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:12.570
Good morning, Sir!

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:18.900
You don’t speak Russian? You’re a Russian soldier!

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:19.730
That’s right.

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:22.180
Ah?

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:23.380
Please speak Russian.

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:35.870
Well, dear friends, we are at the main entrance of Bovington Tank Museum, 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:40.170
at the tank and military vehicle festival.

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.440
Even in the hall you can feel the spirit, 

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:46.860
see what’s on display, and the number of guests.

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.240
The upper floors are already crowded with people,

00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.740
and we are going further.

00:01:54.910 --> 00:01:56.980
And this, guys, is a garage.

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:58.250
One of many garages.

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:01.350
One of them, and what do we see…

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:03.960
We’ll come back later to inspect everything more thoroughly. 

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:05.660
But what do we see now? 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.880
Our friend, the AMX-13-90! And a Charioteer, our pleasure!

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:12.630
Keep the roads clean! Use mops to upgrade your tank!

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:21.220
Well, guys, we met an STB here. I think so. 

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:23.980
Tell me if I’m wrong. 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:31.390
By all means, that’s a Japanese medium tank. 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.700
In World of Tanks, this is a Tier X STB-1.

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.120
Now you see a Matilda. 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.090
Matilda covered with British camouflage.

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:45.370
Like Matilda? Like the video!

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:50.540
If I remember it right, guys, it’s the Leopard.

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:52.240
What, where? 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:56.070
This thing is a Leopard? I don’t think so.

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:56.760
I remember it wrong.

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:10.250
Now you can witness a Soviet lady cook serving German nurses.

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.020
It’s pretty small, right, Max? What do you think?

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:15.340
Yep, some small Valentine.

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:19.550
Well, that’s toyish. Far from that M103. 

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:22.340
Awesome! If it’s her…

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:22.840
Is it really an M103?

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:24.030
Well, I guess, look at its turret… yes.

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:24.710
Wow, I don’t believe my eyes.

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:28.570
The turret… I can’t see the hull yet, but the turret is…

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:29.250
Hi artillery lovers!

00:03:30.420 --> 00:03:32.270
Who’s that we see here?

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:35.010
What kind of tank is it?

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:36.320
Brad Pitt!

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:37.810
Here!

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:39.050
Here?

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:40.000
It’s Brad Pitt.

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:46.390
Brad Pitt, is this you? What happened to you?

00:03:47.450 --> 00:03:47.910
Exhausted

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:03.250
We are running past some Patton, or whatever it is.

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:05.800
If you know, tell us in the comments, 

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:08.880
as we don’t know the name of this giant.

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:22.770
Here’s a PZ! And an armored personnel carrier!

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:26.220
The reenactment of some battle is about to start. 

00:04:26.470 --> 00:04:30.320
It’s not from “Fury,” some other battle. 

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:33.540
But it’s featuring the vehicles that starred in “Fury.”

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:41.840
Here comes Lucky Sue, I think I saw her in the movie. 

00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:46.610
And a little further you can see that Fury Sherman, looks like it did on the screen. 

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:50.130
And German troops, totally invisible, 

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:53.050
are hiding literally 150 meters away from them.

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:55.880
Action!
