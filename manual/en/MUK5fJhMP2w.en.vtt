Hi, I'm Bill with Zoar Outdoor on behalf of
expertvillage.com. We're here today at Chapel

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:10.690
Ledges in Ashfield, Massachusetts, the Trustee's
of the Reservations Property and in this series

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:14.570
I'm going to be talking about preparing to
climb. In this segment I want to talk about

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:18.870
climbers etiquette and we're not talking about
which fork to use at the table, but how to

00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:27.740
be a responsible climber. Climbers are land
users and it's a good idea to know who owns

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:34.129
the land you're at and how to take care of
it well. So as a general rule bringing in

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:38.059
what you bring out, leaving the place at least
as nice as you found it, maybe even pickup

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:43.899
someone else's trash and take it out. Leave
No Trace is a national organization that has

00:00:43.899 --> 00:00:50.199
a great website that promotes opportunities
and ideas about how to be a good responsible

00:00:50.199 --> 00:00:54.929
land user. This property where we're at today,
Chapel Ledges in Ashfield, Massachusetts is

00:00:54.929 --> 00:01:00.850
a land trust owned by trustees of the reservation,
it's member supported and the trails here,

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:07.010
the beautiful trails are maintained by volunteer
efforts. There's a workday every spring, which

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:11.939
I try and volunteer for whenever I can. It's
a great idea to know who owns a cliff in your

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:18.670
area and how you can help out, get involved.
Keep the reputation of climbers as good responsible

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:24.820
land users. The access fund is a national
climbers organization that's instrumental

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:29.539
in securing access to lots of cliffs and if
you can get involved in them, they can help

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:34.210
you out as well. So on a more personal note
how to be involved with other climbers at

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:40.850
the cliff; respect them, respect their gear,
don't walk on peoples ropes, don't kick around

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:45.020
their stuff. If you find their anchors at
the top of the cliff, be real gentle with

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:49.579
them, leave them alone. Don't be the guy that
walks by and has to give the advice about

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:54.560
how to climb the climb. "Hey go, go left,
go!" People don't want to necessarily want

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.590
to hear that. If they ask for it then that's
fine. So be responsible about the land, be

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:05.600
responsible to other climbers, leave the place
as nice as you found it, then you're a good

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:06.740
part of the climbing community.
