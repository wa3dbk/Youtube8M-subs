00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:16.950
Probably more than any other natural threat
to our existence, a mass extinction event

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:24.050
involving a collision with a large near-Earth
object may be the most likely. Asteroids and

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:29.070
comets are the primitive, leftover ingredients
from which the solar system formed; they are

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:35.770
strewn haphazardly throughout our neighborhood,
thrown about by gravity like trash over a

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:36.770
windy landfill.

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:43.900
There are a great number of these small, rocky
bodies circling the Sun in menacing, highly

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:49.409
elliptical orbits that can cross the relatively
circular orbits of the planets. It is these

00:00:49.409 --> 00:00:55.920
orbits that make them so dangerous, they can
all too easily cross our path as they make

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.489
their own way around the Sun.

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:04.120
They are very small and dark relative to planets,
and they don't reflect much sunlight which

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:10.030
makes finding these elusive rocks difficult.
Many small asteroids passing close to the

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:16.360
Earth aren't found until they are almost right
over our heads.

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:22.580
Of course, these close encounters occur almost
daily and we never notice. More and more however,

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:28.870
thanks to NASA's Near Earth Object Program,
more are being seen earlier. In fact, the

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:35.610
week this video was made, on February 9th,
2011, an asteroid the size of a small car

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:42.760
flew a mere 93,000 km over our heads.

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:48.190
NASA is currently keeping track of almost
8,000 known near-earth objects, both asteroids

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:55.030
and comets. The vast majority are small, less
that one kilometer in diameter.

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:00.810
One of them, an asteroid about 400 meters
in diameter has had our attention for some

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:08.250
time. An asteroid known as Apophis.

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:14.340
Named after the ancient great adversary of
the Egyptian sun God Ra, Apophis was the embodiment

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:23.330
of dissolution, darkness and non-being. Apophis
was the un-creator.

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:31.069
It isn't surprising that with such a name,
Apophis the Asteroid has started to garner

00:02:31.069 --> 00:02:32.069
attention.

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:37.890
NASA first announced the discovery of the
asteroid in December 2004, and initial calculations

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:42.590
suggested that this body had an excellent
chance of colliding with the Earth on April

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:53.879
13, 2029 with a chance of 1 in 37 that it
would hit us. This announcement got a lot

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:56.430
of attention.

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:01.040
Followup radar observations at the Arecibo
Planetary Radar Telescope, performed almost

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:06.520
immediately after the discovery, ruled out
that possibility.

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:11.610
These radar observations, coupled with more
detailed analysis of historical images eliminated

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:18.389
the possibility that Apophis would collide
with the Earth in 2029, but it will come extremely

00:03:18.389 --> 00:03:24.180
close: it is currently projected to come so
close that it will fly within the orbit of

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:33.639
geosynchronous satellites, less than 40,000
km over our heads.

00:03:33.639 --> 00:03:37.919
While this close encounter with Earth won't
be cause for alarm, the story isn't over.

00:03:37.919 --> 00:03:45.489
The exact path Apophis follows in April, 2029
is crucially important because it will determine

00:03:45.489 --> 00:03:54.150
whether it hits the Earth when it circles
around a second time in 2036.

00:03:54.150 --> 00:04:00.249
If, on April 13th 2029 Apophis passes through
a very narrow window, known as a keyhole,

00:04:00.249 --> 00:04:06.599
as it passes by the Earth, its orbit will
be affected such that when it returns in 2036,

00:04:06.599 --> 00:04:18.350
will directly cross that of the Earth and
collide with it on Sunday, April 13th.

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:25.490
So will Apophis pass through this keyhole
in 2029? In order to answer this, we need

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:32.230
much more precise measurements. As of early
2011, Apophis is very close to the Sun to

00:04:32.230 --> 00:04:42.140
make any accurate observations and won't be
in a good position until late 2011.

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:47.880
In order to accurately determine whether the
Earth is in for a bad day on April 13th, 2036,

00:04:47.880 --> 00:04:53.250
we also need to know more about Apophis' spin
direction and other physical parameters. These

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:58.220
will be collected from a variety of projects
at NASA as well as the Arecibo radar telescope

00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:04.810
in 2013. These radar observations in particular,
will allow astronomers to determine the location

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:09.530
of Apophis through 2070.

00:05:09.530 --> 00:05:13.590
Throughout its history, life on Earth has
been at the mercy of these wandering, early

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:19.570
building blocks of our Solar System. Early
in its life, Earth was bombarded much more

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:25.410
than it is now. It is easy to understand how
ancient people viewed the arrival of a comet,

00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:31.220
these "un-creators", with dread and dispair.

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:36.290
Paradoxically, life on Earth may owe its very
existence to the early rain of comets and

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:41.670
asteroids across the surface. They may have
been the source of water and other primordial

00:05:41.670 --> 00:05:48.820
building blocks, bringing the spark from which
early life emerged.

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:54.200
As the solar system ages, these events will
become fewer and fewer as asteroids and comets

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:59.330
are either thrown out of the solar system
or collide with other planets.

00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:05.530
The question is, how many will hit us before
they are gone, and will we find them in time?
