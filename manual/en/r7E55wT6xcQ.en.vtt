00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:05.340
The Ranger Challenge competition boils
down to leadership development

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:07.660
Give 100 percent, watch your body

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:12.360
drink, eat, keep that engine going all day long

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:15.860
It's a competition between 40 individual Ranger Challenge Teams

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:18.000
from Universities all across the East Coast

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.940
At this competition you're ruck marching with about

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:23.240
a thirty-pound pack on your back

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.280
We run about 14 miles over
the course this competition

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:29.450
So basically over the two days is more
than a

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:34.280
half marathon, completing 10 totally
different stations that they've had to train for

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:39.760
Everybody thinks, right? Everybody's
involved, don't just wait for him to tell you, you know what to do

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.210
So we left the start point, we were so confident and so motivated

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:46.750
Unfortunately I think that excitement took us a little too far and we ended up missing

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:48.710
a very important turn in our route

00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:50.770
We had made a major error

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:53.930
We were exhausted, because at that point we had rucked about 12 miles

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:55.510
and we hadn't even made it to our first event

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:57.160
(Hey, it's movement or it's over. Yep)

00:00:57.240 --> 00:00:58.960
We just couldn't dwell
on the past

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:03.480
and had to focus on our next event and
and carry on

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:11.020
UVA has a lot of inherent advantages
in terms and mental agility and just general leadership

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.790
so we knew that we weren't out of the fight

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:18.810
What we set out to do was quit using hardball rodes

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.030
bust through the woods for ultimately
a better time

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:29.740
Everybody can be strong

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:33.600
Everybody can hit the gym, can do the push-ups

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.780
they can lift the weights like we do

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:40.800
What sets us apart from other teams is
our mental strength

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:49.020
The crazy thing is, we didn't have the slowest course time. We did those

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:54.110
extra miles so fast and so hard
that we beat the heck outta people

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:58.330
We were not only able to recognize the
mistakes but we were able to improve from there

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:01.630
even when we were extremely tired and
physically wrecked

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:05.330
It didn't even really run through our minds that we weren't gonna win first place

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:07.780
We still wanted to win first place and we were going to try our best throughout the end

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:11.220
As soon as the competition ended I got hungry for next year
