00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:05.480
Saddle stitch binding with staples is commonly
used for booklets, magazines, catalogues and

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:10.540
brochures.

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:15.280
In this tutorial, I'll show you how to saddle
stitch bind using staples, with a focus on

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:20.079
just the binding method itself. This can be
useful if you ever need to mock up a pamphlet

00:00:20.079 --> 00:00:24.779
without sending it to a printer. And if you
draw your own comics, this can help you make

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.630
your own comic book.

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.279
This binding method is commonly done by a
saddle stapler. If you don't have one of these

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:37.210
tools, and your regular stapler doesn't reach
past the width of your pages, here's another

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:40.320
way you can achieve the same results...

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:47.320
First, here's a list of materials and tools
I'll be using.

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.320
For this book, I'll be using 10 sheets of
paper. To determine the amount of pages, I

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:59.510
would recommend your page count not to exceed
over half of the height of your staples. Otherwise,

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:02.900
you won't have enough staple left to press
down onto your book.

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:09.159
To start, fold or score the paper where the
spine will be. You can run a bone folder across

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:13.490
the edge if you want to. If you don't have
a bone folder, see the about section below

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.689
for a video on substitutes.

00:01:16.689 --> 00:01:23.689
Then stack them in the order you want,
and place binder clips to hold them together.

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:45.189
Using a stapler, staple out the amount of
staples you need. For books that are smaller,

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:48.389
I use 2. For taller books I usually use 3.

00:01:48.389 --> 00:01:54.270
Now unfold the staples.

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:59.859
Find the center of the spine, and make two
marks where the staple will go.

00:01:59.859 --> 00:02:06.859
Measure 1.5 inches or about 4cm from the edges
and make marks for the remaining staples.

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:17.950
Now pierce through all the marks with an awl.
You can find a video on awl substitutes below.

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:25.250
Then push the staples through the holes. And
on the inside, press the ends down.

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:42.220
An eraser works well for this.

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:56.390
Remove the clips, and fold the book. You can
put it in a book press or put weights on it

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:03.390
to help the book stay closed.

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:08.540
For books with a lot pages, you can use a
utility blade or an x-acto to trim off the

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:15.540
excess paper on the edge.

00:03:18.430 --> 00:03:19.990
Now your book is finished!
