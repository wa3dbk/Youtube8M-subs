00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:19.250
Good day.

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:23.330
Now FEAR would go on to become fairly popular,
as it should have simply because it was a

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:26.400
good game even if it wasn't very scary.

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.420
Now it would receive two expansion packs and
we're going to be taking a look at the first

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.270
one today called Extraction Point.

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:37.040
Now Extraction Point takes place immediately
after the first game.

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:40.730
And you have to try to escape the city after
a nuke goes off in it.

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:42.440
That still, of course, did not stop Alma.

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:46.640
And also apparently couldn't kill the titular
Point Man, who is the main character that

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.760
never speaks and generally just doesn't interact
with anybody.

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.070
Although you have to wonder, when people talk
to him and he doesn't respond, do they think

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.690
he's a complete asshole?

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:55.690
I don't know.

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:58.410
Gordon Freeman gets away with it so maybe
Point Man does too.

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:02.670
Now this game is virtually unchanged from
FEAR 1.

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.330
You shoot pretty much all the same enemies,
and you do pretty much all the same things.

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:10.720
There's some freak out moments where they
don't really actually matter all that much

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:15.970
cause you don't get hurt, although they do
actually send some spectral enemies after

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:18.000
you that you do actually have to shoot.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.020
However, it's fairly rare and they're easily
killed in one or two hits.

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.920
The atmosphere in this game is still just
as good as FEAR 1's, although it now is kind

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.250
of old seeing as how you just played through
pretty much the exact same atmosphere in the

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:46.050
first game, but it still works.

00:01:46.050 --> 00:02:02.409
Unfortunately, the game's story doesn't make
a lot of sense.

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:07.970
Now, in the first game, the sub-boss was a
man named Paxton Fettel, he was the eeeevil

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:09.440
psychic commander of all the clones.

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.590
Now in the first game, spoiler alert, you
kill him.

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:14.630
In this game, he comes back to life.

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:15.630
Somehow.

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:18.340
He even says it doesn't make any sense!

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:21.810
And I guess you kinda have to have him come
back because if he doesn't you don't have

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.930
any enemies because Alma apparently doesn't
want to attack you or send spectral enemies

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:28.530
after you, even though she does at times.

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:33.040
This game is already losing logic already
at the first bloody expansion pack.

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.930
Now really, there's not much else to say about
this expansion pack.

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.820
It's just FEAR 1 rehashed again.

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:42.410
But that's really what an expansion pack does;
it gives you what you liked in the first game

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:44.129
and just adds on to it.

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:47.760
It's definitely a good expansion pack if a
bit repetitive at this point.

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:55.510
And so, this is Jon, signing off.
