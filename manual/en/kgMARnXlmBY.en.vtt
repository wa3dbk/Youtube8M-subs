00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:13.620
Double displacement reaction

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:20.180
Chemical reactions are part of our daily life.

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:26.120
From photosynthesis occurring in plants, to
cooking of food in the kitchen, there are

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:33.130
different sets of chemical reactions happening
around us. A chemical reaction happens when

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:40.060
two or more elements interact together to
form a chemical bond between atoms and form

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:47.440
a chemical compound. Chemists have classified
the chemical reactions into four different

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:54.600
types depending upon the type of chemical
change occurring in the reaction. 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:03.170
 Combination or synthesis reactions are those in which
two or more chemical elements or compounds

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:13.730
unite to form a more complex product. Decomposition
reactions are those in which a compound is

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:22.500
decomposed into smaller compounds or elements.
Single displacement reactions are characterized

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:29.689
by an element being displaced by a more reactive
element .Double displacement reactions

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:37.630
represent those reactions in which two compounds
exchange ions or bonds to form different compounds.

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:45.769
The aim of this experiment is to study the
reaction between sodium sulphate and barium

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:54.140
chloride solutions and classify it as combination
reaction, decomposition reaction, displacement

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:58.300
reaction or double displacement reaction.

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.780
Materials required:

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:13.760
Boiling tubes, solution of sodium sulphate
and Solution of barium chloride.

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:16.980
Procedure

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.560
Take a small quantity of sodium sulphate solution in a boiling tube.

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:31.920
Then take a small quantity of barium chloride solution in another boiling tube

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:38.180
Pour the barium chloride solution taken inthe boiling tube into the boiling tube

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:41.300
 containing sodium sulphate solution.

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:48.360
On adding, a white precipitate of barium sulphate
is formed in the boiling tube

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:54.160
This confirms the presence of sulphate 
ions in the solution

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:59.849
Now keep the content of the boiling tube undisturbed
for 10 minutes

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:06.040
After 10 minutes, we can see that the white
precipitate in the test tube settles to the

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:11.829
bottom of the test tube.
Now decant the upper solution in the boiling

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:18.579
tube into the beaker.
Add a few drops of dilute HCL to the white

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:23.619
precipitate of barium sulphate and shake the
test tube well

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:31.320
We can observe that white precipitate remain
insoluble in the dilute HCL

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:38.820
Here a chemical reaction occurs between sodium
sulphate and barium chloride to form barium

00:03:38.919 --> 00:03:45.919
sulphate and sodium chloride. This is a double
displacement reaction in which sulphate ions

00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:54.511
are displaced by chloride ions and chloride
ions are displaced by sulphate ions
