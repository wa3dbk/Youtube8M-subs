Hey everyone! It's the Code Police. We're
doing the 190 second 90's challenge, which

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.470
we made up. We allowed ourselves preparation
to get images but that is IT. We're gonna

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:15.110
see who can come up with the best 90's-esque
web page in 190 seconds. 

00:00:16.380 --> 00:00:18.160
190 seconds on the clock.

00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:19.220
Let's Go.  

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.120
[Beeping]

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:59.980
Oh, oh. NO! Nooooooo! Done!

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:07.000
 
Okay, clearly, clearly the biggest mistake

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.160
was trying to write Javascript. 

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:14.380
So okay, let me at least, let me at least finish. 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:28.060
Let's just finish and I'll speed up this part.

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:35.540
Okay,
so the idea for mine was for Kirby to be dancing.

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:43.580
But, you know, it took me more than 3 minutes.
But hey, that thing is dancing. What is that

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:48.979
font? That's a beautiful font. I used what
is called the cursive family. Oh, the cursive

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:55.349
family. Yeah like it auto-picked the font
based on... the cursiveness. Apparently I

00:01:55.349 --> 00:02:01.509
restarted the timer. Six minutes, there we
go! It was less than six minutes, we know

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:08.509
that! Okay so, it's "os nice to meet you!"
My neopet's name is Zelda91112, this is a

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:16.849
true story. Its not there anymore. I'm still
kind of upset about it. Um, it was a Zafara.

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:25.290
We're talking about Neopets? Yes, we're talking
about Neopets. If anyone didn't obviously

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:31.989
know that. There's the things I like. These
are beautiful non copyrighted images you found.

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:38.989
My petpet. My petpet's pet. PICKLES. Magic!&lt;3
And evening tea and cookies~! That is awesome,

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:46.709
Jillian. Congratulations, you have shown us
the epitome of the 90s. Thank you, thank you.

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:53.709
Well we tried. And we possibly failed, but
we'd love to see your versions of your 190

00:02:54.019 --> 00:02:58.989
second HTML 90's challenge videos or whatever.
Go ahead and take 6 minutes like we did if

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:03.870
it takes you that long. Or longer, we'd still
love to see your old school pages. I have

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:07.029
a low battery now, so it's time. It's time
to stop.
