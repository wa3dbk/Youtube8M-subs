00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.370
I’m Arne Duncan and I’m very pleased,
my favorite teacher is right here with me

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:06.819
today, came all the way from Chicago. Really
appreciate it. It’s Darlene McCampbell.

00:00:06.819 --> 00:00:11.589
She was my high school English teacher and
she was just extraordinary. Not just for me

00:00:11.589 --> 00:00:13.809
but for so many students who were lucky enough
to have her.

00:00:13.809 --> 00:00:18.230
She worked us hard. She challenged us. It
was not easy work. And there was never talk

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:21.290
of limits or ceilings or what you can’t
do. It’s was always sort of pushing you.

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:23.900
As good as you thought you were she was pushing
you to the next level.

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:31.510
My joy is so much when I’m there in that
classroom. I think it’s the kids who have

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:37.879
done…done the work to make themselves to
become successful and to be good people. And

00:00:37.879 --> 00:00:45.520
it’s true that I see my role as encouraging
that and believing in that and tapping into

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:48.929
the hunger for people being good and doing
good things.

00:00:48.929 --> 00:00:53.260
She worked extraordinarily hard. I just remember
that the number of comments on papers. It

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:58.489
was like there was more red than blue on the
papers. And sometimes, oh my goodness. But

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:02.979
it was all constructive and it was all to
make you better. At the end of the day, she

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:08.620
brought the best out in us. I think that’s
what great teaching is about. And I would

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:14.890
not begin to be here today if it were not
for that. Part of my job is frankly, an obligation

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:19.470
to help other students have those opportunities.
As a child you almost take it for granted.

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:24.170
You don’t sort of realize how special that
is. So as we go forward and we talk about

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:28.810
the baby boomer generation retiring and a
million new teachers coming into the profession,

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:34.530
I see a huge opportunity to try and recruit
the next generation of extraordinarily talented

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.520
extraordinarily committed people who want
to make a difference in students’ lives.

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:46.070
A reason to go into teaching is that it’s
a total joy. There’s no better job. And

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:52.950
yes, it’s hard work. I mean, the occupational
hazard of bringing home papers every night,

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:57.170
if you’re an English teacher, that doesn’t
stop. But it’s a gift.
