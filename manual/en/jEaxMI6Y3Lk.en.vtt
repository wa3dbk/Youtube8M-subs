00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.440
Today we're going to do an install on part
#87005 on an '04 Suzuki XL7.

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:09.950
This also applies to part # 41537.

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:18.480
This covers the Suzuki Grand Vitara, Vitara,
XL7, Chevy Tracker 2 door, and 4 door.

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.560
The first thing we need to do is take this
factory tie down bracket.

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:33.980
This will be taken off and left off, so we'll
take this off and go to the other side.

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:37.350
Then we'll go to the other side where there
are to threaded holes which we'll have to

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:46.050
clean out first since they have road grime
and stuff inside of them.

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:54.110
With our threads clean and dried out we can
install our hitch.

00:00:54.110 --> 00:01:10.860
We lift it up into position and use a couple
of bolts to hold it up there.

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:21.350
Although its hard to see, the hitch has probably
been tweaked in this way for whatever reason.

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:25.810
We're missing the hole by about an 1/8 of
an inch at most.

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:29.040
We really just need to push this over a bit.

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:37.740
You can take a regular pry bar and put it
against the edge of the hitch and push it

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:39.829
as you need it.

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:43.010
Yes we are near the gas tank, but we're not
using much pressure.

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:49.930
That should give us our clearance to get to
the bolt hole.

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:59.100
At this point we can tighten our bolts down
and then give them their final torque.

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:24.500
Now we can torque down our bolts.

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:28.569
That covers it for our install of the 2004
Suzuki XL7 using part # 87005.
