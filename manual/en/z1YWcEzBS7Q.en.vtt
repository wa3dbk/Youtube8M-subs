00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:05.400
Now I have set my tomatoes aside and now I'm
going to open my chicken and the spinach,

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.599
then combine the tomato, chicken and spinach.
If you have never used a manual can opener

00:00:10.599 --> 00:00:21.590
before, you just clamp the blade down into
the can so it punctures the seal. Then firmly

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:31.210
squeeze the handle as you torque the knob
around several times, thus freeing the lid

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:40.870
from the can. I get a little messy. The juice
inside of chicken is just water that keeps

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:49.620
it fresh in the can. You'll go to the sink
and just putting pressure on the lid of the

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:56.220
can with your thumb, you can drain all that
water out, cause we don't want our salad to

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:09.360
be runny. Then throw the lid away and this
is where you get your mixing bowl and you

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:23.860
can just use your fork to pull all the chicken
out of the can into your bowl. You can add

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:38.380
your tomatoes and you can open your bag of
spinach. I usually find one or two handfuls

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:48.930
is more than enough spinach for me.
So we have most of our ingredients in here

00:01:48.930 --> 00:02:02.130
and now we are going to mix them around a
little bit. Now we are ready to check on our

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:02.710
noodles.
