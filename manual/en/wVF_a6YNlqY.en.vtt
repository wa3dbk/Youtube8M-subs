posted in upton sinclair quote to

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:15.080
a forty seven percent ic takers when i
pointed out that sinclair was a

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:18.910
socialist mccuen question most certainly
did not mean what he thought it meant he

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:21.500
shrugged off the historical context

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:26.150

cannot falsely attributed ramli can i

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:28.300

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:37.400
just hit this taking a brenham

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:39.300
hi get these emails all the time

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.430
and the first thing i did

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.530
and i get in for my father in law

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:48.100
with the first thing i did

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:51.650
and i got in from other people but i've
been taken off the list is

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:53.330
um...

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:56.910
they send about two bunch of people they
don't know how to use bcc

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:00.640
so the first thing i do is i take one
sentence from the mail

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:02.260
and igoogle is

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:07.600
and then i go to the snopes link that in
variably shows up

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.810
and then i find out that it was
completely fabricated that there is no

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:14.740
lieutenant glued lieutenant colonels jim
steven berg

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:16.330

00:01:16.330 --> 00:01:20.150
and

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:23.780
using them for a quick there is no
intelligent stephen breyer to serve the

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.580
seventh for me it is still the poor and
iraq

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:32.640
and then i just called from snopes and
the like and i send it back to everybody

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.240
and then i get out the email est

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.759
