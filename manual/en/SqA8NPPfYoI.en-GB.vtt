00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.240
My name is Nadia Mogilev 
and I am a concept artist at MPC film art department.

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:12.420
I worked on projects like "Guardians of the Galaxy", "Exodus", "Cinderella" and I am currently working on the "Pirates of the Caribbean".

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:17.040
I started as a video game concept artist 
when I used to live in San Francisco, California.

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:22.960
Some time ago I move to London and I thought the film industry would be something I would like to pursue.

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:26.760
And after a few years working as a freelancer, 
I joint the talented team of MPC.

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:37.180
I have always used a medium sized Intuos and I really like it and use it at home and at work.

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:43.860
I also used to own a 21-inch Cintiq that I used a lot and now I swapped it with a Cintiq Companion 2.

00:00:44.380 --> 00:00:50.180
I travel quite a lot and it is a great device for those who like to be mobile so you can sketch anywhere anytime.

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:56.280
My background is fine art and illustration 
and I do quite a lot of fine art on the side.

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:04.760
And when I draw, I try to go no smaller than A4 to A3 format. So the size of the Cintiq 27QHD is quite good.

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:11.860
One of the main softwares that I use is Photoshop
and the Cintiq 27QHD is quite good for that,

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:16.860
because I can fit all of my tools as well 
as the art work on the same screen.

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:24.080
The second screen that we use in the usual set up becomes secondary just for checking emails or reference pictures.

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:31.080
I personally donÂ´t use the ExpressKey remote,
because I am old school and use keyboard shortcuts.

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:37.960
But the new design of it being so customisable, 
you can put it anywhere, is quite good.

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:43.920
Because nowadays it is all about customization 
and making the customers experience bespoke.

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.900
So for that purpose 
I think the ExpressKey Remote is great.

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:57.140
I was very curious when the Cintiq 27QHD came out, because it is quite massive.

00:01:57.660 --> 00:02:03.580
But I feel like the Ergonomic stand is quite good,
you can move the Cintiq up and down easily.

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:10.920
What I found most useful about the device is the size, you can keep all your tools and artwork in one space.

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:16.100
I use mostly 2D software and have not tried the 
3D software on the Cintiq 27QHD yet,

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:21.600
so I am curious to see how it will work 
with a software like Model ZBrush.
