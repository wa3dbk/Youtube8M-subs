Hi my name is Teri Lynne and I'm here with
David O'Donnell. And we're here on behalf

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:11.160
of Expert Village and in this segment I'm
going to show you how to slick back your hair.

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:17.311
So you want to start with very damp hair.
So his is a little damp, and we want it a

00:00:17.311 --> 00:00:24.110
little wetter than this. You don't want it
completely soaking wet. This is just a spray

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:28.051
bottle of water. It's good to have one of
these on hand when you're doing your hair.

00:00:28.051 --> 00:00:33.600
And if it dries and you don't like the way
it looks, you can just dampen it and fix it.

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:41.230
OK, so you want to take either a brush or
a comb, whatever moves more freely through

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:49.100
your hair, and you want to just start at the
crown, or at the, yes you can start at the

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:56.309
crown and start slicking back and then work
forward towards your hair line. And then if

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.579
you want to choose you can either go straight
back, I'm not really a big fan of that look.

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:08.380
I like to choose a part so you pick a side
that you want to slick more over to. I'm just

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:17.992
choosing the right side.
Just comb it and you really want to make sure

00:01:17.992 --> 00:01:32.340
these sides are back. Those you don't want
falling back in. If you want to use a bit

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:39.140
of product for something like this, I recommend
a styling cream to put over top of it just

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:44.740
to hold your hair like this. A little bit
of hairspray works as well. You can use gel.

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:52.719
This is a bit more of a formal look. If you've
got somewhere where you're trying to look

00:01:52.719 --> 00:01:56.890
a bit more professional and not so shaggy,
you might want to want to have your hair nicely

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:01.100
slicked back like this and there we have it.
