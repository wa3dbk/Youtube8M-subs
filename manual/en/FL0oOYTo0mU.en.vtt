00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:11.369
Hello, this is Jaystepher here with another Lego review.

00:00:11.369 --> 00:00:13.569
This is for the Police Minifigure Collection.

00:00:13.569 --> 00:00:17.619
Set number 7279,

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:22.039
contains 57 pieces.

00:00:22.039 --> 00:00:25.089
This is what we get.

00:00:25.089 --> 00:00:30.689
I paid 9.99 for this.

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.600
You get one of the police officers and an ATV.

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:36.550
You get one of the police officers and an ATV.

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:40.280
It's kind of cool.

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:42.630
Lots of detail.

00:00:42.630 --> 00:00:46.320
You also get a police dog.

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:53.070
Actually his face is painted on. My other two dogs, that I actually have, are not.

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.380
Another police officer with handcuffs and a flashlight

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:03.170
which is kind of cool.

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:04.850
Well, it's mostly just mini-figures,

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:08.240
Well, it's mostly just mini-figures,

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:09.870
but you get a robber

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:12.240
with a backpack full of money,

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.810
well one dollar.

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.390
And we have another like a burglar with the crowbar. I don't even have a crowbar, this will be my first.

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:21.900
And we have another like a burglar with the crowbar. I don't even have a crowbar, this will be my first.

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:25.420
And here's the ATM machine.

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:27.580
Here's the money inside.

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:30.610
Get it open.

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:34.980
Basically slipped the money in the hole,

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:41.050
the bad guy comes by and just rips this open with his crowbar.

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:43.690
I mainly bought this kit for the oven piece,

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:45.189
but other than that,

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:49.370
it does come with the computer.

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:53.790
That and the mini-figs were the only things I was really after.

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:56.920
Of course this is just a mini-fig collection.

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:58.740
But, there's the review for the

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:01.120
But, there's the review for the

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:04.670
kit number 7279. Really fun.

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:05.070
Thanks for watching.
