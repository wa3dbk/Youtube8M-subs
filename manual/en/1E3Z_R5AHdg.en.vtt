00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:03.160
What I want to do in this
video is think about the two

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:07.030
different ways of
interpreting lowercase g.

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:09.820
Which as we've talked about
before, many textbooks will

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:14.430
give you as either 9.81
meters per second squared

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:17.120
downward or towards
the Earth's center.

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:19.410
Or sometimes it's given with
a negative quantity that

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.090
signifies the direction, which
is essentially downwards,

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:25.410
negative 9.81 meters
per second squared.

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.570
And probably the
most typical way

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:38.670
to interpret this value, as
the acceleration due to gravity

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:47.069
near Earth's surface for
an object in free fall.

00:00:47.069 --> 00:00:49.235
And this is what we're going
to focus on this video.

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.520
And the reason why I'm
stressing this last part

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.280
is because we know
of many objects that

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.450
are near the surface
of the Earth that

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:06.990
are not in free fall.

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:10.310
For example, I am near the
surface of the Earth right now,

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:12.400
and I am not in free fall.

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:15.720
What's happening to me right
now is I'm sitting in a chair.

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:20.100
And so this is my chair--
draw a little stick

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.150
drawing on my chair,
and this is me.

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.570
And let's just
say that the chair

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:26.970
is supporting all my weight.

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:29.940
So I have-- my legs
are flying in the air.

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:31.190
So this is me.

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:32.980
And so what's
happening right now?

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:35.850
If I were in free fall,
I would be accelerating

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:39.500
towards the center of
the Earth at 9.81 meters

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:40.610
per second squared.

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:46.920
But what's happening is, all
of the force due to gravity

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.810
is being completely
offset by the normal force

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:54.810
from the surface of the
chair onto my pants,

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.390
and so this is normal force.

00:01:57.390 --> 00:01:59.175
And now I'll make
them both as vectors.

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:07.210
So the net force in my
situation-- the net force

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:10.750
is equal to 0, especially
in this vertical direction.

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:13.320
And because the net
force is equal to 0,

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:16.110
I am not accelerating towards
the center of the Earth.

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.340
I am not in free fall.

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:22.630
And because this 9.81
meters per second squared

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:24.590
still seems relevant
to my situation--

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:26.070
I'll talk about
that in a second.

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:29.060
But I'm not an
object in free fall.

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:32.610
Another way to interpret this
is not as the acceleration

00:02:32.610 --> 00:02:34.226
due to gravity near
Earth's surface

00:02:34.226 --> 00:02:35.850
for an object in free
fall, although it

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:38.960
is that-- a maybe more
general way to interpret

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:42.830
this is the gravitational-- or
Earth's gravitational field.

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:46.491
Or it's really the average
acceleration, or the average,

00:02:46.491 --> 00:02:47.990
because it actually
changes slightly

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:49.830
throughout the
surface of the Earth.

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:54.250
But another way to view this, as
the average gravitational field

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:55.650
at Earth's surface.

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:57.810
Let me write it
that way in pink.

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:02.970
So the average gravitational
field-- and we'll

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:05.060
talk about what a field
means in the physics

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:09.670
context in a second-- the
average gravitational field

00:03:09.670 --> 00:03:14.420
at Earth's surface.

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:16.610
And this is a little bit
more of an abstract thing--

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:18.068
we'll talk about
that in a second--

00:03:18.068 --> 00:03:20.000
but it does help
us think about how

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.760
g is related to
this scenario where

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.500
I am not an object in free fall.

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:27.750
A field, when you think of
it in the physics context--

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:29.350
slightly more
abstract notion when

00:03:29.350 --> 00:03:31.683
you start thinking about it
in the mathematics context--

00:03:31.683 --> 00:03:33.780
but in the physics
context, a field

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.020
is just something that
associates a quantity

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:38.350
with every point in space.

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:48.029
So this is just a quantity
with every point in space.

00:03:48.029 --> 00:03:50.320
And it can actually be a
scalar quantity, in which case

00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:52.365
we call it a scalar
field, and in which case

00:03:52.365 --> 00:03:54.080
it would just be a value.

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:55.812
Or it could be a
vector quantity,

00:03:55.812 --> 00:03:58.020
which would be a magnitude
and a direction associated

00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:59.610
with every point in space.

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:02.370
In which case you are
dealing with a vector field.

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:04.840
And the reason why
this is called a field

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:08.490
is, because at near
Earth's surface,

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:11.770
if you give me a mass--
so for example-- actually,

00:04:11.770 --> 00:04:14.240
I don't know what my
mass is in kilograms.

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:15.890
But if you're near
Earth's surface

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:17.660
and you give me a
mass-- so let's say

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:21.300
that mass right over
there is 10 kilograms--

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:26.560
you can use g to figure out
the actual force of gravity

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:31.090
on that object at
that point in space.

00:04:31.090 --> 00:04:34.945
So for example, if this
has a mass of 10 kilograms,

00:04:34.945 --> 00:04:36.570
then we know-- and
this right over here

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:39.390
is the surface of the Earth, so
that's the center of the Earth.

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:41.737
So it actually associates
a vector quantity

00:04:41.737 --> 00:04:43.320
whose magnitude,--
so its direction is

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:45.500
towards the center of the
Earth, and the magnitude

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:51.674
of this vector quantity is
going to be the mass times g.

00:04:51.674 --> 00:04:53.340
And you could take--
since we're already

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:54.756
specifying the
direction, we could

00:04:54.756 --> 00:04:57.120
say 9.81 meters
per second squared

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:58.724
towards the center of the Earth.

00:04:58.724 --> 00:05:00.140
And so in this
situation, it would

00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:07.920
be 10 kilograms times 9.81
meters per second squared.

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:10.644
Which is 98.1.

00:05:10.644 --> 00:05:12.310
And even this I've
rounded a little bit,

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:14.390
so it's actually
approximate number.

00:05:14.390 --> 00:05:20.570
98.1 kilogram meters
per second squared

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:24.870
which is the unit of
force, or 98.1 newtons.

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:26.740
And this thing might
not be in free fall,

00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:30.380
so this is why g
is relevant even

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:33.130
in a situation where the
object isn't in free fall.

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:36.550
g has given us the
force per unit mass--

00:05:36.550 --> 00:05:41.890
the force per mass of
gravity on an object

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:44.960
near the surface of the Earth.

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:46.700
Another way to think
about it-- so this

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:50.440
is the average gravitational
field, and what it's giving

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:54.960
is force per mass.

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:57.570
So you give me a mass
near Earth's surface--

00:05:57.570 --> 00:05:59.350
whether it's an
object in free fall

00:05:59.350 --> 00:06:02.790
or not-- you multiply
that mass times g,

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:05.080
because it's giving
you force per mass,

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:08.990
and it will give you the
force of gravity acting

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:11.330
on that object near the
surface of the Earth,

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:12.722
whether or not
it's in free fall.

00:06:12.722 --> 00:06:14.680
So I just want to make
this little distinction,

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:17.140
because although g
tends to be referred

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:18.980
to this way right over here.

00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:20.750
Sometimes you might
encounter a stickler

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:24.020
who says oh no, no, no, no,
no but g is relevant even when

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:25.370
an object is not in free fall.

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:28.020
You obviously can't say
that my acceleration when

00:06:28.020 --> 00:06:30.395
I'm sitting in my chair is
9.81 meters per second squared

00:06:30.395 --> 00:06:31.728
towards the center of the Earth.

00:06:31.728 --> 00:06:34.330
I am not accelerating towards
the center of the Earth.

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:35.920
And so they'll say,
oh no, no, no, no,

00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:38.730
you can't just call
this acceleration.

00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:40.330
It is true, it is
the acceleration

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:43.850
when an object is in free fall
near the surface of the Earth--

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:47.780
if you don't have really air
resistance, if the net force

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:50.040
really is the force of
gravity-- then this really

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:52.200
would be the object's
acceleration.

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:54.019
But it becomes
relevant, and we know

00:06:54.019 --> 00:06:56.060
most objects that we know
of aren't in free fall.

00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:58.070
Obviously, an object in free
fall doesn't stay in free fall

00:06:58.070 --> 00:06:58.569
for long.

00:06:58.569 --> 00:07:00.170
It eventually hits something.

00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:02.190
But we know that
now g is actually

00:07:02.190 --> 00:07:03.840
relevant to all objects.

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:07.040
It tells us the force
per mass And it's

00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:08.870
tempting to call it
always acceleration--

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:10.869
because the units
are acceleration--

00:07:10.869 --> 00:07:12.410
but even when you
talk about in terms

00:07:12.410 --> 00:07:14.784
of the gravitational field,
it's still the same quantity.

00:07:14.784 --> 00:07:19.050
It still has the exact same
units, the same magnitude,

00:07:19.050 --> 00:07:20.620
and the same
direction-- it's just

00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:22.170
a different way of viewing it.

00:07:22.170 --> 00:07:24.560
Here, acceleration for
an object in free fall.

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:27.030
Here, something to
multiply by mass

00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:29.874
to figure out the
force due to gravity.
