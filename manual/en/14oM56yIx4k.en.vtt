00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:06.200
Hi I'm Helen Picket and I'm back to talk about
my new ballet

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:07.730
called "The Exiled."

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:11.430
The Exiled is one of three narratives that
I'm working on currently.

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:17.150
The Exiled specifically deals with ideas of
existentialism but then I started branching

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:25.390
out to basic ideas of the human condition
and the human response to how we are with

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:34.700
each other so as with every ballet my direct
link to the human condition is communication.

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.810
That is still of the utmost importance.

00:00:37.810 --> 00:00:45.640
I have a set in this piece that includes a
plexiglass front wall so interestingly I've

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:53.740
put up a wall to if you will to stop that
communication so I've even created one more

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:58.330
barrier for myself in the effort to reach
the audience.

00:00:58.330 --> 00:01:03.380
I thought that was quite interesting when
I looked at the set and I thought, "hmmm look

00:01:03.380 --> 00:01:04.470
what I've done."

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.210
That's an interesting choice.

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:11.760
But um I think it has a lot to do with what
these five characters are going through in

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.469
this play.

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:20.780
There are two characters called The Reckoners
they are handing out justice in there own

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:26.870
terms and it is not something that I condone
at all.

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:32.179
I thought it was a very interesting dramatic
element to see two people handing down justice

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:39.920
on three people that they consider as criminals
so things they have done in their life to

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.340
warrant a vigilantes justice.

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:49.659
I don't know if there are any good guys in
this piece but what I attempt to illustrate

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:55.049
is that no human being is all good or all
bad.

00:01:55.049 --> 00:02:02.490
All of these sides live in us and what is
the point where we get pushed to react although

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:08.690
we might not have seen this in ballets before
and I'm sure we have it is evident in film

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:18.620
and literature so again my whole idea of bringing
dance into and with and to communicate with

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.091
other art forms is also very important to
me.

00:02:22.091 --> 00:02:29.700
To deal with subjects that we see on a daily
basis perhaps in the news or definitely in

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.459
our cinema and movies.

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:40.370
So its been quite a beautiful journey with
the two casts that I've been working with.

00:02:40.370 --> 00:02:46.540
I have collaborated as ever on the movement
but also on a script.

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:53.420
I've written a script in collaboration with
Christian, and Jonah, and Heath, and Rachel,

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:59.640
and Nadia and we've created a text a prologue
and an epilogue that book end the dancing

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:05.410
portion of this piece and so I have brought
in if you will narrators this time to help

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:06.980
tell the story.

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:14.620
So it is my first ballet in which I use text
and it is the first time that these four people

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:19.200
Christian and Nadia in the first cast and
Jonah and Rachel in the second cast it is

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:23.610
the first time in which they are speaking
and I have to tell you they are just out of

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:24.610
this world.

00:03:24.610 --> 00:03:30.290
They are taking it on like any other role
and it speaks so much to the spirit of this

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:35.629
Company and the creativity of this Company
and how they're ready for any challenge.
