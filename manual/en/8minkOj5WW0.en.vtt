one, two, three, four!

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:06.040
Rev up your engines!

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:17.460
It's time for the Scotty Kilmer Channel

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:24.150
if your lights are getting cracked and are getting full of
water when it rains, then stay tuned

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.180
because today I'm going to show you how
to replace a headlight assembly on your

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.789
car,
now modern headlight assemblies are much

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:33.540
more complex than old cars, they come in
sections so you got to take a whole

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.769
bunch of stuff off, in order to get to
them, so the first thing we have to do is

00:00:37.769 --> 00:00:43.620
unbolt this cover, it covers the front
bumper and in this case you got to unbolt

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:50.040
the bottom parts too here and take off
the turn signal here to get that out of

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:54.840
the way, because hiding inside here are
two 10 millimeter bolts, they hold this

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.859
part in and you got to bolt it off from
the inside, so just stick your hand

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:05.369
inside and start on unbolting with a ten
millimeter wrench and out comes the bolt

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:11.009
then you can just pull this half off, to
access the headlight and if you notice

00:01:11.009 --> 00:01:14.789
I'm lazy, I got enough room to get this
headlight off, but I didn't unbolt

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:19.229
the whole other side because I don't feel
like putting that all back again and

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:22.530
there's a tip, have a new headlamp
assembly ready, because then you know

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.979
here's the mounting bolts and here's
another mounting bolt, you know there's

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.399
only three and you know where to take
them off from, now the bottom bolt doesn't

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:32.459
have much working room, so I'm using a
quarter inch socket with a ten

00:01:32.459 --> 00:01:36.300
millimeter because it's small and it'll fit
in the hole, it'll fit right in the

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:39.869
bottom here and then you can get it
right off

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:45.450
then finish taking the easy top two off
and then out comes the whole assembly you got to do a

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:49.379
little wiggling but it comes out and here's a
mechanic's tip for buying a new assembly

00:01:49.379 --> 00:01:53.190
they're pretty expensive, so I just
google it and find the cheapest one

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:55.610
wherever I can get it and have it
shipped to my house

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:01.319
then just wiggle it and put it back in
and bolt the bottom one in first because

00:02:01.319 --> 00:02:05.610
it's hard to get to, you want to get that
on it first, then bolt the easy top ones

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:11.370
in and don't forget to snap the light
bulb connector back in, then of course

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:15.920
put the bumper cover back on, you don't
want to be driving around in a junker

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:23.700
so goodbye old broken headlight and
hello shiny new one and remember if

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.849
you've got any car question just visit

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:32.849

back from the asylum!
