00:00:10.150 --> 00:00:16.219
Hello and welcome to another jewelry making
video brought to you by KeepsakeCrafts.net.

00:00:16.219 --> 00:00:20.600
Today I'm going to teach you how to make caged
beads.

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:23.430
Wrapping them with wire is a cool effect.

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.610
Then you can string them any way you like.

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:28.240
Today we're going to make them into a bracelet.

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:32.439
To make this project, you will need first,
of course, some beads, whatever beads you

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:36.890
like to make up the length of your bracelet.

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:46.300
Today I'm using 10x15mm oval ceramic beads
and in between those I'll have these 6mm bicone

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:47.300
beads.

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:48.510
You'll need a clasp.

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:52.970
You can use a lobster clasp if you like, but
I have a toggle clasp today.

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:58.620
You'll need some bead stringing wire and crimps
to string your bracelet together and for the

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.040
wire wrapping you'll need some 20 gauge wire.

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:03.430
You can use anything you have.

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:05.140
Sterling silver is beautiful.

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:06.970
You can oxidize it.

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:08.350
This is bright copper.

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:11.170
A caged bead is a rather fun element to make.

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:15.250
It's just a piece of wire that's wrapped around
a bead in a spiral.

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:17.410
It gives it some interesting texture.

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:22.142
Now depending on the size of beads you have
will depend on the length of wire to start

00:01:22.142 --> 00:01:26.080
with so there is a little bit of trial and
error here.

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:34.870
For these beads a 4" piece is just right so
just use your wire cutters and cut yourself

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:46.380
a 4" piece of your wire and then use round
nose pliers to make a loop on one end and

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:50.670
then grab that loop and continue spiraling
that wire around.

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:56.780
Now if you have soft wire you should be able
to at this point start spiraling it with your

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:03.890
fingers and just make a loose spiral and keep
spiraling until you've used up half of your

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:14.130
wire and then repeat on the other side.

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:22.440
Your second spiral should go in the opposite
direction so that when they meet, you have

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.519
a fancy 'S' shape.

00:02:25.519 --> 00:02:32.909
The next step is to grab a hold of that center
loop and just give a gentle pull so that you

00:02:32.909 --> 00:02:40.180
pull that spiral out into a cone shape and
do the same for the other spiral, pulling

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:55.629
them both to the same side 
and then fold that whole thing in half and

00:02:55.629 --> 00:02:59.159
now you see how easy it is to make the cage
for your bead.

00:02:59.159 --> 00:03:04.349
A this point you can pop that open sliding
your bead.

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:07.370
Now these are oval and flat.

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:11.639
Round beads really are the best ones to start
with if you've never worked with wire before,

00:03:11.639 --> 00:03:14.840
I recommend that, but you can just take a
little time.

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:21.239
Like I said soft wire is great because it's
softest and you can manipulate it with your

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:27.120
fingers and you want those loops that you
started with to line up with the holes in

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:33.489
your bead and so just repeat until all of
your beads are caged.

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:37.959
So once you've finished caging all your little
beads, it's time to put it all together into

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:39.319
a bracelet.

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:46.859
Cut yourself about a 10" piece of bead stringing
wire, slide on a crimp, slide on the round

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:54.959
part of your toggle clasp and then slide that
end of the wire back through the crimp.

00:03:54.959 --> 00:04:00.489
Make sure the wires are parallel and not crossed
inside the crimp and then just flatten that

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:04.859
crimp near your clasp with a pair of chain
nose pliers.

00:04:04.859 --> 00:04:14.900
Give it a tug, make sure it's secure and then
you can cut off that extra bit of wire and

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:21.320
now simply string your beads to the length
you want and make sure that when you go through

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:25.910
these that you go through the loop of your
wire and then the hole of the bead and then

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:28.280
back out through the other loop of the wire.

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:32.310
It might take a bit of manipulating to accomplish
that.

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:38.620
When you get done, string a few small beads
on the end so that you can bend your toggle

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:43.430
clasp and then finish your toggle with a crimp
as well and you're done.

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:46.990
So here's another look at the bracelet we
made today.

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:50.650
Keep in mind that you can use this technique
for any kind of jewelry.

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:53.990
You can use it for earrings, for necklaces.

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:56.950
It's a great way to dress up a plain bead.

00:04:56.950 --> 00:05:03.330
Also you can use any number of combinations
of wire colors and bead colors.

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:06.771
If you have sterling silver wire you could
oxidize it.

00:05:06.771 --> 00:05:11.819
If you have bare copper wire you can patina
it, all kinds of choices.

00:05:11.819 --> 00:05:15.760
