00:00:15.629 --> 00:00:19.730
Misa Criolla is a very famous piece and I'm surprised that so many people 

00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:21.859
in the Netherlands Argentinean know this.

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:26.369
There is a tradition in the performance of this piece

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:27.939
like in the barock music

00:00:27.939 --> 00:00:32.629
Actually this tradition started with the first recording in the sixties

00:00:32.629 --> 00:00:35.529
performed by Los Fronterisos and Ariel Ramirez,

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:39.460
I heared these performances when I was a child

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.150
Musica Temprana always performs barock music

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:59.850
This is the first time we are going to record a piece from the sixties

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:03.190
This music, the Misa Criolla comes from the barock music

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:26.460
remarkable is the way to sing this piece

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:32.040
the voice with classical education is based on resonance

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.880
and in this piece it is about stress on the vocal chords 

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.230
such that it almost sounds like whining

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.000
therefore it makes the music very emotional 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:45.080
You should never let go, it is always fixed

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:56.980
I think we have a nice chance to perform the Misa Criolla in the Netherlands

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:02.080
We have so much musicians from different Latin American countries

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:07.830
really good musicians, and these two give us the possibility to develop a real Latin American version

00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:11.410
like we perform barock music from this whole continent

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:17.500
giving us a general Latin American sound

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:44.759
We have always had the Misa in ourselves,

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:46.339
We have grown with it

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:49.150
 Now we are ready to perform it
