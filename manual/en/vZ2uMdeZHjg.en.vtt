Hi I'm Coach Collin Castellw with SHot Mechanics.com
and this is the LeBron James Power Dip.

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:42.950
Now the power dip is an awesome move that
LeBron james uses all the time and has kinda

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:44.700
perfected it in the last couple years.

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.739
It's the perfect move because not only does
it give him extra separation to get off a

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:50.710
shot but also most of the time draws a foul
on his defender.

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:54.690
So because not only you get separation but
you also draw fouls it is perfect for defenders

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:56.790
even if they are bigger or smaller then you.

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:00.960

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:06.320
Alright so let's break down the move and be
on the look out for the 3 main keys that will

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:07.570
help you execute this move.

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:10.020
The LeBron james Power Dip is brought to you
by Krossover.

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:16.040
So this move begins as LeBron james beats
his man to the basket.

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.700
It works best of your defender is running
hip to hip next to you.

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:19.700
That way they are out of position.

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.150
So the first key is that you want to launch
off your inside foot.

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:26.600
this makes it look less like LeBron James
is initiating the contact and makes it look

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.310
like it is more of a foul on the defender.

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:31.070
The next thing you want to do is initiate
the contact early.

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.479
It works best if you can draw contact before
your defender has a chance to jump.

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:37.710
this will catch them out of position and make
it easier for the referee to call a foul against

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:38.710
them.

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:41.970
So the last thing you want to do is focus
through the contact and find your target you

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:42.970
are aiming at.

00:01:42.970 --> 00:01:45.780
You can't go wrong with locking your eyes
on the top corner of the square and then putting

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.400
the ball softly off of it.

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.840
Alright so remember there are 3 main keys
to keep in mind doing this move.

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.540
#1 you want to jump off of your inside foot
that way it creates more natural power and

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.110
it does not look like your jumping into the
defender as much drawing that offensive foul.

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.500
Key #2 is that you want to create that contact
early.

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.420
it is really important that you create that
contact before you defensive player can get

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:05.420
set.

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.170
This is really important because it puts your
defender out of position and so when the refs

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:11.540
need to make a call they really can only call
it on the defender.

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.650
And finally key #3 you need to focus with
your eyes through contact, find your target

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:17.890
as soon as you possibly can and put the ball
on point.

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:22.590
You will see sometimes that guys forget to
aim the ball and just kinda throw it off the

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:23.590
backboard.

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:26.819
So really focus through that contact, find
your target, and put it in.

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:30.040
