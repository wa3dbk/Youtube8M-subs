Hello everybody! First of all,

00:00:03.379 --> 00:00:07.980
I have to say this: I know my pronunciation
is not so great...

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.889
and I know I sort of speak like Sofia
Vergara, so...

00:00:12.889 --> 00:00:17.210
I am adding subtitles to his video. I'm
sure you will need them.

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:23.060
okay so, today I have this amazing puzzle to show you

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:26.849
a puzzle we have been waiting for a long
time...

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:31.519
the 4x4 Mirror Cube. When I heard that this puzzle...

00:00:31.519 --> 00:00:35.559
was being sold in Mexico I was very
skeptical

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:38.920
because the only videos of a 4x4 Mirror Cube...

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:42.739
I had seen on YouTube where of a 3x3
Mirror Cube...

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:47.160
with like pasted pieces to make it look
like a 4x4.

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:50.379
But the designer was kind enough

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:53.770
to send me one to try it out and, Wow!

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:58.530
I am impressed by the quality. I really
like the box

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.640
with this transparent kind of window

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:08.640
and we can see the puzzle through it. So let's take it out of here.

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:14.369
So, This is a very well handmade mod. You
can actually see...

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:17.640
the original pieces... let me see where...

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:23.159
Here. And the material that was added to
them.

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.339
And in one of the corner pieces... Here...

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.360
We can see the...

00:01:30.369 --> 00:01:34.750
designer's signature. There it is. 

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:39.920
It is really smooth. And before I scramble it...

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.990
so you can see it is fully functional

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:47.530
I want to compare sizes with this 4x4
ShengShou.

00:01:47.530 --> 00:01:50.659
which is the cube it was made out of.

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:54.959
so here you can see how much...

00:01:54.959 --> 00:01:59.579
material was added to it. 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:06.400
Okey, so let's go ahead and scramble it.  

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:12.280
If you are interested in buying this puzzle 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:17.160
There is one store... only one store that has them in stock. 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.000
Is this one... 

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.760
“Rubikstore Xalapa”

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.040
I think the price is 100 US dollars

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.320
and they ship all over the world.

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:36.820
I have it a little bit loose. I like them loose

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:40.950
But somethis it is a little bit difficult to scramble this...

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:44.250
with this kind of tension.

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:47.680
Ok, so here it is...

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:51.810
totally scrambled.

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:55.150
So, if you want buy this I will...

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:59.340
You will have a link of the store
in the

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:03.079
description. And.. also...

you will find a link to another video...

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:10.389
where I am solving it. I didn't want to
solve it

00:03:10.389 --> 00:03:13.739
in this same video, because I know some of you

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:17.689

planning on buying one.

00:03:17.689 --> 00:03:20.819
