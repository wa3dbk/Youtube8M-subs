00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:11.820
The term medical condition is scary by itself
but what happens when even the doctor hasn't

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:17.770
heard of it? Well brace yourself as we count
down our top five strangest medical conditions

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:21.940
ever heard off.

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:28.539
At number one is the Cotard's Delusion also
known as the walking dead syndrome. This seems

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:34.640
like a term taken right out from the walking
dead series. But people who suffer from this

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:39.559
condition believe that they are missing body
parts such as the brain or are actually

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:45.710
dead. This disorder occurs because there is
a dysfunction in the areas in the brain responsible

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:52.760
for recognizing emotions and faces including
their own. This leads to a complete emotional

00:00:52.760 --> 00:00:58.989
detachment and removes any sense of personal
identity when looking at their bodies. The

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:06.240
only known cure for it electroconvulsive therapy
which has worked better in some cases.

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:14.100
At number two is Epidermodysplasiaverruciformis.
This disease causes unnatural tree bark like

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:19.780
growth on a persons skin. Of course it
isn't tree bark but are warts that worsen

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:26.990
by exposure to sunlight. While there is no
cure there are however a few treatments available.

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:33.399
Coming in at number 3 is the vampire syndrome.
If y'all are vampire fans then this might

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:40.590
sound pretty interesting. Around 1 in 1 million
people suffer from xerodermapigmentosum. These

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:47.289
people are extremely sensitive to sunlight
and UV rays. Slight exposure may cause extreme

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:53.229
sunburn and the breakdown of the skin while
long exposures may even cause skin cancer.

00:01:53.229 --> 00:02:00.090
Xerodermapigmentosum is caused by a rare recessive
mutation of the nucleotide excision repair

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.439
enzymes.While there are some treatments available,
the best prevention from damage is merely

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:08.740
staying completely out of sunlight, just like
a vampire.

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:13.630
At number 4 Alien Hand Syndrome. The phrase
the right hand doesn't know what the

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:19.600
left is doing is actually literally true
for some people. People who suffer from this

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:24.450
condition literally don't know what their
one hand is doing. This is usually caused

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:30.370
due to a brain injury or surgical severing
of the corpus callosum. As of now there is

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:37.250
no cure for this condition.
And last but not least is Foreign Accent Syndrome.

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:42.620
While accents can reveal a lot about a person's
residence there are some people who develop

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:48.360
a condition that causes them to uncontrollably
speak in a foreign accent, even if they have

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:53.840
never visited that area before.Often, several
types of accents can be used at different

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:59.480
times, or may even be blended together. This
is usually caused due to side effects following

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:06.080
stroke or other brain injury.     For strange and weird facts make sure to subscribe to our channel
