00:00:07.049 --> 00:00:11.749
When I formed the Antelope, I went back
to my roots so to speak &amp; I

00:00:11.749 --> 00:00:14.769
took up the question of clocking again.

00:00:14.769 --> 00:00:17.269
So, the year is 2005

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:21.420
and we're going back, you know we
have the new animal

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:27.230
and times have also progressed &amp;
technology progressed, the chips

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:28.220
and the ideas.

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:32.550
I was looking for ways to improve what
I've done with the Aardsync

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:36.840
and that's where by I realized, I would
have to go to a more stable time base

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:42.150
&amp; I introduced the idea of oven controlled
crystal oscillator.

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:45.800
So, by putting the crystal oscillator,
which is the heartbeat of the clock,

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:50.510
inside an enclosure

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:54.460
and keeping the temperature constant.
Keeping the temperature constant is important

00:00:54.460 --> 00:01:00.120
because the crystal is an analog
component that vibrates, it oscillates.

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.980
So it response to the environment.

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:06.940
By keeping the temperature constant you
can considerably improve its stability

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:08.800
&amp; its jitter performance.

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:13.300
So, that’s when I introduced the Isochrone Line.

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:17.800
‘Iso’ pre-fix means constant or
the same

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:21.760
&amp; ‘chrone’ comes from time. It's supposed to
suggest

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:26.400
the elements of time…

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:31.620
that are stable. OCX’s name comes from
oven controlled crystal oscillator that we

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:35.360
started shipping around 2005

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:38.930
and we got quite a bit of

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:43.880
firstly American customers, big
guys very excited about it because there

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.190
was a period between the two animal
companies

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:50.050
when the Aardvark ceased doing
business

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:53.030
and before the Antelope shipped its
product.

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:54.930
So, when we got back,

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:00.219
when we started shipping OCX, people
were excited to try out the new clock from me.

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:04.409
and they listened to the oven controlled
technology. They really liked the way it

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:08.899
sounded. They thought it was doing a lot
more to improve the sound quality.

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:13.870
We now have almost 18 years and it
almost took that long for the awareness

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:15.490
to build, that the clock is important.
