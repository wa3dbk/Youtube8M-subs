00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:10.350
A new telescope for mapping the skies is about
to start work at ESO’s Paranal Observatory

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:19.060
in Chile. The VLT Survey Telescope, or VST,
with the 268 megapixel OmegaCAM camera at

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:26.740
its heart, is the latest addition to the observatory.
It is the largest telescope in the world designed

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:28.620
to survey the sky in visible light.

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:40.140
This is the ESOcast! Cutting-edge science
and life behind the scenes of ESO, the European

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:49.980
Southern Observatory. Exploring the ultimate
frontier with our host Dr J, a.k.a. Dr Joe

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:51.670
Liske.

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:57.050
Hello and welcome to the ESOcast. The new
telescope is called the VLT Survey Telescope,

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:02.600
or VST for short, and the special thing about
it is that it has a very wide field of view—

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:08.389
about twice as broad as the full Moon. It’s
dedicated to mapping the skies both very quickly

00:01:08.389 --> 00:01:14.320
and with very high image quality. The VST
is housed in an enclosure right next to the

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:19.549
VLT Unit Telescopes on the summit of Cerro
Paranal under the pristine skies of one of

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:22.439
the best observing sites on the planet.

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:27.689
Now, over the next few years the VST and its
huge camera OmegaCAM will be busy making some

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:33.099
very detailed maps of the southern skies and
in this episode you’ll get to see the very

00:01:33.099 --> 00:01:41.889
first released images from this brand new
telescope.

00:01:41.889 --> 00:01:47.240
The VST is a visible light telescope that
perfectly complements the VISTA infrared survey

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:53.810
telescope. The unique combination of the VST
and VISTA will allow many interesting objects

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:59.840
to be identified that can then be studied
in detail with the powerful telescopes of

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:06.439
the VLT.

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:11.930
The VST is a state-of-the-art 2.6-metre telescope
equipped with an active optics system that

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:16.920
keeps the two mirrors of the telescope perfectly
aligned at all times in order to ensure the

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:23.120
highest possible image quality. Now, at its
core, behind huge lenses, lies the OmegaCAM

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:29.000
camera which was built around no less than
32 CCD detectors which, together, create a

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.340
whopping 268 megapixel image.

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:38.011
Now, the camera also contains some extra CCDs
that help with the telescope guiding and the

00:02:38.011 --> 00:02:44.181
active optics system, as well as some absolutely
enormous colour filters. Both the telescope

00:02:44.181 --> 00:02:48.750
and the camera were designed to take full
advantage of the excellent observing conditions

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.250
on Paranal.

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:56.109
The VST is a joint venture between INAF, the
Italian National Institute for Astrophysics,

00:02:56.109 --> 00:03:02.129
and ESO. INAF, and in particular its Capodimonte
Observatory in Naples, designed and built

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:08.359
the telescope, while ESO was responsible for
the civil engineering works at the site. OmegaCAM

00:03:08.359 --> 00:03:12.989
was built and designed by a consortium of
astronomers working in the Netherlands, Germany,

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:14.129
Italy, and at ESO.

00:03:14.129 --> 00:03:25.989
The VST will make three public surveys over
the next five years.

00:03:25.989 --> 00:03:31.540
One survey, called KIDS, will image several
regions of the sky away from the Milky Way.

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:37.349
It will help astronomers understand more about
dark matter, dark energy and galaxy evolution,

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:43.299
and find many new galaxy clusters and high-redshift
quasars.

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:49.209
The VST ATLAS survey will cover a larger area
of sky and will focus on determining the properties

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:55.909
of dark energy. Like KIDS, it will also hunt
for far-away galaxies and quasars.

00:03:55.909 --> 00:04:01.870
The third survey, VPHAS+, will image the central
plane of the Milky Way to map the structure

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:07.569
of the Galactic disc and its star-formation
history. It will yield a catalogue of around

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:14.090
500 million objects and will discover many
new examples of unusual stars at all stages

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:20.220
of their evolution.

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:24.850
The data volume produced by OmegaCAM is going
to be pretty large with about 30 Terabytes

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:29.960
of raw data produced every year. Now, these
data are going to flow back into data centres

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:36.069
in Europe for processing. The huge lists of
objects found in the images, as well as the

00:04:36.069 --> 00:04:41.370
images themselves, will then be made public
so astronomers all over the world can use

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:46.130
the VST data to help them figure out the answers
to a vast range of different astronomical

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:52.810
questions

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:56.660
The VST has just made its first release of
images.

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:02.610
The spectacular Omega Nebula, also known as
Swan Nebula, is a region of gas, dust and

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:08.660
hot young stars that lies in the heart of
the Milky Way. The VST field of view is so

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:14.780
large that the entire nebula, including its
fainter outer parts, is captured — and retains

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:23.440
its superb sharpness cross the entire field.

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:28.590
Omega Centauri is the largest globular cluster
in the sky. But the VST, with its very wide

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:33.620
field of view, has no problem in capturing
the whole object in a single image, including

00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:45.620
its very faint outer regions. 
This image contains about 300 000 stars and

00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:54.240
it highlights the impressive sharpness of
the VST’s images.

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:59.250
The combination of large field of view, excellent
image quality, and the very efficient operations

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:04.139
scheme of the VST will produce an enormous
wealth of information that will advance a

00:06:04.139 --> 00:06:08.930
number of different fields of astrophysics.
Many astronomers — including myself, actually

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:13.539
— are really looking forward to the first
results from the VST surveys.

00:06:13.539 --> 00:06:18.229
This is Dr J signing off for the ESOcast.
Join me again next time for another cosmic

00:06:18.229 --> 00:06:18.749
adventure.
