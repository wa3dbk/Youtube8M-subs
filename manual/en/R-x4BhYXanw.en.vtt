Once you have ripped your strips, you're going
to want to decide how big you're going to

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:14.290
want your purse to be. So I have gone ahead
and ripped my strips, and now I have ripped

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:18.919
them lengthwise too, and this is how you're
going to be able to see how big it is, is

00:00:18.919 --> 00:00:22.869
you fold it, tri-fold it like that with the
flap coming over, and remembering that there

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:26.669
will be seams on either end so it will be
shorter. And once you have those the right

00:00:26.669 --> 00:00:33.050
size, you're going to go ahead and put your
strips together so we can make it a patchwork.

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:43.719
Now I always finish stitch so that it won't
fall out before I get ready to put it together,

00:00:43.719 --> 00:01:05.190
and allow about a half inch seam. Then I've
got one more that's going to go on the other

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:13.680
side, and that will be plenty wide enough
for what we're doing. I'm actually going to,

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:17.361
I think that's going to be wider than I want,
so what I'm going to do is cut this one in

00:01:17.361 --> 00:01:25.840
half, just rip it down the center. That leaves
the skinnier piece, see, it's nice when you

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:30.670
can adjust whenever you want, that's what's
fun about doing it how you want it is you

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:33.850
can adjust whatever you want. When you're
doing a pattern you always feel obligated

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:38.770
to follow it, so if you lose the pattern and
never start with one, than you can go wherever

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:45.030
you feel like going with it. That makes it
a lot more fun to sew, and a lot less frustrating.

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:59.790
And it will end up looking something like
this.
