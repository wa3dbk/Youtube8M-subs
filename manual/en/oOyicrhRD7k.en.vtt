Hello Everyone, today I am 
going to show you how to make traditional Chinese Almond Cookies

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.980
Let's have a look at our ingredients

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:15.220
First of all, the cake moulds

00:00:15.274 --> 00:00:17.274
The ingredients are

00:00:19.186 --> 00:00:21.186
Almond powder 180 grams

00:00:21.574 --> 00:00:23.574
Flour 180 grams

00:00:25.889 --> 00:00:27.889
This is unsalted butter 100 grams

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:34.220
If you have solidified vegetable oil, you can substitute it

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:36.200
Almond flakes 70 grams

00:00:37.274 --> 00:00:39.274
Sugar 120 grams

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.640
Almond essence

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.120
Water

00:00:47.533 --> 00:00:49.533
and 1/4 teaspoon of table salt

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:57.900
Okay, now we will put in the almond powder, flour and sugar into the bowl

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.840
Mix them together

00:01:04.753 --> 00:01:06.753
Butter

00:01:06.753 --> 00:01:08.200
and 1/4 teaspoon of salt

00:01:09.914 --> 00:01:11.914
Mix the ingredients well

00:01:11.914 --> 00:01:13.410
Mix them all up

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:19.880
Mix the powder and the butter well

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:22.120
Add in few drops of almond essence

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:26.160
to intensity the almond flavour

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:30.620
Break the almond flakes into small pieces and all them into the bowl

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.260
Okay, mix them well

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:40.300
We now add 2 tablespoon of water

00:01:43.774 --> 00:01:45.774
one teaspoon

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.020
two teaspoon

00:01:53.716 --> 00:01:55.716
do not add too much water

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:59.760
because if we put too much water, the cookies will be gooey

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.000
This consistency is perfect 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:09.040
If you feel that the dough is too powdery, add in more water

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:13.240
Now we put the cookie dough into the mould

00:02:14.893 --> 00:02:16.893
Press the dough hard

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:23.120
The pattern will come out better

00:02:24.754 --> 00:02:30.714
Now scrape off the excess dough with a dough cutter

00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:39.940
Press the dough hard

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:45.250
Flip the mold over

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:48.250
With a bit of force

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:49.050
2 biscuits

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.054
Get the cookies out of the mould

00:02:52.054 --> 00:02:56.194
Place them separately onto the baking tray

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:03.640
If you want to make them extra special

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:06.700
You can put some crushed fried black sesame seeds

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.180
and mixed them into the dough

00:03:12.413 --> 00:03:14.413
A small amount will be enough

00:03:14.413 --> 00:03:15.760
Not too much

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:26.180
Place the tray in the centre of the oven

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:30.720
Now we can take them out

00:03:32.508 --> 00:03:34.508
Let them cool them

00:03:34.508 --> 00:03:37.808
Let some of the moisture evaporates

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:41.760
Do not use tongs to pick up the cookies

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.253
because the cookies will break apart

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:48.060
the cookies are light and fluffy

00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:55.380
Here we are, almond cookies are now ready

00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:01.620
Tea is now served

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:04.120
Thank you very much for watching
