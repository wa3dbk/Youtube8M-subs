00:00:02.173 --> 00:00:06.513
In this video I will show you how to successfully manage the generation 

00:00:06.513 --> 00:00:08.985
of your keyframes inside of Voice-O-Matic.

00:00:10.604 --> 00:00:16.170
For this we will use a character called Whip from the award winning animated TV series; 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.371
tripping the rift, created by Cine-Groupe mostly here in Montréal.

00:00:22.591 --> 00:00:25.650
So looking at Whip here, you can see that several

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.539
of his morph targets are currently available in Morpher, 

00:00:28.539 --> 00:00:33.072
each of these representing the various mouth positions of this character.

00:00:33.753 --> 00:00:36.960
Whip’s head has already been setup with Voice-O-Matic.

00:00:37.043 --> 00:00:40.978
By clicking on “open Voice-O-Matic”, you access its interface 

00:00:40.978 --> 00:00:43.797
and the default mapping of the various morph targets.

00:00:44.772 --> 00:00:47.395
Let’s generate the key frames and look at the results

00:00:47.395 --> 00:00:50.343
achievable with all of the settings by default.

00:00:50.818 --> 00:00:54.764
You will then be able to tweak the results to obtain a much better quality.

00:00:55.374 --> 00:00:58.170
So let’s take a look at this default animation

00:01:07.725 --> 00:01:10.953
Ok, so analyzing what we just saw.

00:01:10.484 --> 00:01:13.614
This first pass of animation had our friend Whip switch 

00:01:13.614 --> 00:01:16.981
from one mouth to another in a rather sharp manner.

00:01:17.103 --> 00:01:21.682
this can be easily resolved by enabling the weighting option.

00:01:23.748 --> 00:01:30.158
Moving on, we can go to the phoneme mapping section and select the “UWQ” mouth position.

00:01:30.852 --> 00:01:34.449
If you look at the bottom left corner of this section you will see that

00:01:34.449 --> 00:01:38.129
the intensity of this viseme is of 2, instead of 1.

00:01:38.132 --> 00:01:40.530
The reason for this is that by default,

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.136
Voice-O-Matic is set to exaggerate the U mouth position.

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:47.234
As typically in the English language, you will naturally

00:01:47.234 --> 00:01:50.302
exaggerate the puckering of the lips when speaking.

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.592
So I will reduce that to 1 and lower the intensity of the mouth opening as well, 

00:01:56.592 --> 00:02:04.441
and instead of keeping the “A” at 100% I will keep it at 70%, like this and hit create keys.

00:02:05.118 --> 00:02:07.844
Now if we just look at the modified results.

00:02:18.806 --> 00:02:22.929
Already, this has improved our animation drastically.

00:02:23.918 --> 00:02:27.570
Next what we want to do is go  to the “TH” mouth position, 

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:30.104
where as you can see it is triggered.

00:02:30.352 --> 00:02:33.302
We will let it be weighted; this weighting will generate 

00:02:33.302 --> 00:02:37.768
a more subtle animation instead of always going from 0 to 100.

00:02:38.763 --> 00:02:44.649
next, we will reduce the smoothing value which will allow us to have more keyframes.

00:02:45.422 --> 00:02:47.358
Let’s watch the results.

00:02:56.988 --> 00:02:58.562
Thats much better.

00:02:59.441 --> 00:03:03.618
I’ll just open up the track editor so we can see the various key frames.

00:03:06.494 --> 00:03:08.874
We can see the key frames that are lowered here

00:03:08.874 --> 00:03:13.173
are the ones for the “TH” viseme because they are weighted.

00:03:13.564 --> 00:03:16.983
Therefore all of the keyframes go from 0 to 100,

00:03:16.983 --> 00:03:21.178
with the exception of the “TH” mouth position that is weighted.

00:03:22.222 --> 00:03:26.126
Now another thing that is very cool is that in 3ds max 

00:03:26.126 --> 00:03:29.534
we can use the keyframe’s tool to adjust the keyframes.

00:03:30.012 --> 00:03:33.444
So let’s change the interpolation of the keyframes, like this,

00:03:33.444 --> 00:03:35.425
and click, create keys.

00:03:35.646 --> 00:03:39.853
You can now see that all the keys and all of the curves have been adjusted.

00:03:40.446 --> 00:03:42.071
Let’s watch the results.

00:03:52.362 --> 00:03:55.910
So just by adjusting a couple of values we have managed

00:03:55.910 --> 00:03:59.195
to change to look of the lipsync created by Voice-O-Matic.

00:04:00.423 --> 00:04:06.915
Should I want to completely change the style of this animation, I could use stepped keyframes.

00:04:06.915 --> 00:04:11.412
Stepped keyframes would make the animation look very claymation-esque.

00:04:21.101 --> 00:04:23.399
That’s not really what we want though, right?

00:04:23.598 --> 00:04:26.596
We really want something smooth and natural.

00:04:27.506 --> 00:04:29.491
So going back to the curve editor,

00:04:29.491 --> 00:04:33.670
we can see that all of the curves have this smooth progression.

00:04:41.279 --> 00:04:44.813
So by adjusting a couple of values we have successfully tweaked

00:04:44.813 --> 00:04:47.454
the way the Voice-O-Matic creates key frames.

00:04:47.737 --> 00:04:52.592
What is really cool is that if weclose Voice-O-Matic and don’t need the plugin anymore,

00:04:52.884 --> 00:04:58.039
the generated keyframes as they are just regular keyframes and have been saved in the scene.

00:04:58.992 --> 00:05:03.110
With Voice-O-Matic the lipsync animation is automatically created

00:05:03.110 --> 00:05:06.606
as if you had done a rough blocking pass of animation. 

00:05:07.575 --> 00:05:13.553
It can also be tweaked to achieve your desired results using tools built into 3ds max.

00:05:20.331 --> 00:05:21.331
As you can see it is very fast to create high quality lipsync animations

00:05:24.667 --> 00:05:29.765
with the help Voice-O-Matic While keeping full control of your keyframes.

00:05:32.342 --> 00:05:34.706
