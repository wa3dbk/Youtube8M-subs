00:00:00.599 --> 00:00:05.210
The next style of sunglasses that I am going
to show you is probably the most popular among

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:15.120
sunglasses and that is just your metal frame.
Let me see here, this one is fairly small

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:22.160
does not have a wide lens here, but generally
speaking it is very stylish, you know gentleman

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:30.800
really prefer this kind of sunglass. It has
a little bit of a wrap but not that much.

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:39.949
As you can see not a great fit for me but
very narrow so you are not getting a whole

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:46.070
lot of sun coverage from even the side because
there is a very narrow temple here. Below

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:51.129
I can see, up I can see, so basically only
giving you coverage dead ahead. So light is

00:00:51.129 --> 00:00:57.719
going to cut through these. To me that does
not bother me all that much, you know I feel

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:04.220
like I always wind up seeing the rim of my
glasses. So you know seeing the rim probably

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:10.240
would not bother me that much. But a lot of
you that are looking for more coverage may

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.170
not think that these are ideal, you want something
that gives you a little more coverage. You

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:19.719
want something with a little more wrap. But
these are fairly basic, fairly simplistic,

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:25.549
and again seems to be one of the most popular
menâ€™s sunglasses around. Just a basic metal,

00:01:25.549 --> 00:01:31.840
a smaller sunglass and seemingly the amount
of coverage just does not bother. I will show

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:37.689
you another one, obviously they come in all
different sorts of shapes and sizes and styles.

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:44.219
This again is the double bar and not giving
you anymore protection than you would if you

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:53.119
had one without it. But a little bit more
coverage so you get a little bit more sunglass,

00:01:53.119 --> 00:01:57.631
but still on the sides you are still not getting
total coverage and again from the bottom you

00:01:57.631 --> 00:02:06.859
can see out of them. So in the end you know,
use your discretion. Obviously this is a fairly

00:02:06.859 --> 00:02:13.480
wide breath of selection in terms of metal
sunglasses so ask your optician what choices

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:19.820
they have, what kind of coverages they have,
wrap the frame comes in. But again these are

00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:24.300
very adaptable as opposed to the plastic ones,
generally speaking they have longer temples

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:31.050
so you can adjust them a little bit more.
So that is really about it for menâ€™s metal

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.190
sunglasses.
