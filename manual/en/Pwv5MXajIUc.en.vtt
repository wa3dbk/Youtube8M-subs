00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:09.809
Now time to get our straws from the form that
it is right now, into that long breadstick

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:19.920
formation. To help us get that shape, I'm
just going to use a pizza cutter. Again, the

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:31.000
same way I did with the phyllo pastry, except
this time a different shape. I've read in

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:43.909
magazines and places where they say use a
ruler to make sure that the lines are absolutely

00:00:43.909 --> 00:00:47.329
even. But you know what? It doesn't really
matter all that much, because you're going

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:55.479
to end up twisting it onto the sheet, and
you'll see it becomes quite beautiful. So

00:00:55.479 --> 00:01:07.750
the fact that it's precisely, each one is
3/4 of an inch or so, it doesn't really matter.

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:16.370
This is a great tool for pastry. It's just
a pastry cutter. I call it my scraper. To

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:23.920
lift pastry that's not participating, take
the cheese straw in mid-air, stretch it a

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:32.830
little bit, and deposit it gently on the cookie
sheet. And our next strip. You can see that

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:41.350
it's already sort of. . . like any dough it's
quite delicate, so you wouldn't want to roll

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:46.890
it out much more than that because then it
would get thin and break. That would just

00:01:46.890 --> 00:02:09.330
not be good. That's my last one that will
fit on that cookie sheet. I will get another

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:17.910
one for the rest of these. But these can go
in a 375 degree oven, same temperature as

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:25.420
the tarts, too, how convenient. These are
going to go for 10, 12, maybe even 15 minutes

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:32.140
depending on your oven. But check them at
the 10 minute mark and see if they're golden

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:37.569
enough for you. If not, give them another
two minutes, but no more than 15 minutes because

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:38.480
they'll just be too dark.
