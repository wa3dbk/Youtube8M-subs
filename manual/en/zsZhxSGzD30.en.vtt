00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.560
i think the relationship between

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:09.469
john personally and castrol

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:11.679
is in essence the key to the

00:00:11.679 --> 00:00:13.789
success of this operation

00:00:13.789 --> 00:00:18.109
uh... i i think the relationship was
solidified even further

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:20.840
because castrol support in that

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:22.769
very difficult time

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:25.970
was one of the things that carried john

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:27.929
through and made the whole team

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:30.939
able to survive

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:33.220
uh... something that

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:37.140
you would have thought would have been
unsurvivable

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:38.290
so uhhh

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:40.630
i think john

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:44.970
thinks of castrol in the in the in the
same way that he thinks of his girls

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:47.410
uh... that they've been there through
this

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:49.060
incredible journey

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:50.290
and he doesn't want

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:51.990
that to ever change

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:55.220
that their linked is one forever on
a deal like that

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:59.680
when i first met castrol over twenty five
years ago

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:02.800
they were basically a motorcycle oil

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:04.699
and they had a vision where they were going

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:07.260
and i was part of that vision

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.960
i've run out of oil for every win ok

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:13.850
for every championship

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:15.260
i did at all

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.060
castrol gtx in my motor

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.270
and i can say that with pride

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:25.050
because i was part of the development of
the oil that goes in the car you drive

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:27.090
that sets in your driveway

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.600
that you drive every day to take the
kids to school

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.900
that you drive everyday when you go to
work or you go shopping

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.620
i was part of that development

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:38.490
because samples were taken from the
racetrack

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.470
week after week back to the labs at
castrol and they would develop a better brand

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.210
to put into the car so it wasn't just
about

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:47.689
john force racing and

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:51.399
going three hundred miles an hour in a
funny car and winning the championship and

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:55.439
preaching the gospel holding up a gtx can
that isn't what it was about it was about

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:57.390
the development of a great oil

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:03.359
the oil in these race cars is a very
specialized thing

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:05.910
and tim miranda has worked

00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:06.810
with us

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:11.059
and developed new additives and
formulations

00:02:11.059 --> 00:02:15.159
that have been a big asset to us

00:02:15.159 --> 00:02:17.120
we have oil that

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.629
from what i can tell from having talked
with our competitors

00:02:21.629 --> 00:02:26.299
we have oil that's superior to
anything else on the market out there

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:31.279
and that certainly has helped
us in engine reliability in

00:02:31.279 --> 00:02:32.739
parts usage

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:34.680
and uhh it's

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.829
when we do have a problem that you know
we're thinkin man is there any way to

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:42.940
make this a better well that castrol
engineering staff

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:44.960
has frequently been able to

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:48.430
go back to the lab and come up with some
ideas of

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:52.249
and quite often they come up with an
answer that ends up saving our bacon

00:02:52.249 --> 00:02:56.049
of you know it's been a real good
working relationship

00:02:56.049 --> 00:03:01.429
you know for developing oils that work
under these horrific conditions the the

00:03:01.429 --> 00:03:05.279
engines and in the john force race cars are under extreme environment

00:03:05.279 --> 00:03:10.959
so we know that the technology that we
use in those cars can get the job done

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:15.110
we're very confident that that technology
can perform very well

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:17.149
in the passenger car engine oils

00:03:17.149 --> 00:03:20.839
that the everyday consumer uses in their
vehicles one of the uh... things that

00:03:20.839 --> 00:03:24.290
we've been able to accomplish with the
help of castrol

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:30.039
and their line of lubrication products has
been performance we have

00:03:30.039 --> 00:03:34.309
led the field in performance in
record-setting we've you know been able

00:03:34.309 --> 00:03:38.789
to do uh... develop big horse power but
there's more to it than that because you

00:03:38.789 --> 00:03:43.239
have to have reliability to go along
with that and that's uh... that's one of

00:03:43.239 --> 00:03:47.829
the things that castrol has really given
us an advantage with their oil

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:50.579
engineering is second to none and uh...

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:55.259
it's just been a real boost to uh
this team it's not just a financial

00:03:55.259 --> 00:03:56.039
deal

00:03:56.039 --> 00:03:59.439
uh... is it's a real partnership

00:03:59.439 --> 00:04:01.839
they have brought so much engineering

00:04:01.839 --> 00:04:06.269
and quality product to this game that's
that it's really uh... it's it's raised

00:04:06.269 --> 00:04:07.439
the level for everybody
