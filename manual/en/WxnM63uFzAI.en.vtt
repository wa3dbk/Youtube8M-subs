00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:11.220
For the filling part, I still need to add some water

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:13.600
Add a little soup

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:18.320
If there is no soup, I have a quick way

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:22.440
Here are 600g plum ground meat

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:30.100
You can also choose the side meat (also known as the two layers of meat,triangle meat)

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:33.420
You can buy meat with vendor

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.100
Taiwanese is called

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.900
Or two layers of meat

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:45.000
No matter what method you use to cook, you can eat it well.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:49.160
The two layers of meat is not as oily as pork

00:00:49.160 --> 00:01:01.520
If you don’t mind a slightly higher price, I suggest that you buy the two layers of meat, very delicious

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:06.960
Two layers of meat stir twice into ground meat

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:12.020
use water to make broth (120~150c.c water or stock)

00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:16.060
We can't cook it well, so we use chicken powder

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:30.960
Cut a thin slice of ginger and chop the green onion and put it in water

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:35.740
Rub it inside, called onion ginger water

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:42.240
Soak it out to drain the onion ginger water residue

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:51.420
The more you cut the juice of the onion ginger, the easier it is to release it.

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.080
Bubble for a while

00:01:53.640 --> 00:02:01.560
This is some coriander, you can also add onions or celery, etc. ... very casual

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:06.140
You don’t want to add pure soup with onion ginger water.

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:12.920
A little white pepper

00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:17.880
2 tablespoons of soy sauce

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:27.420
The salty portion has to try on its own. I use 600g of ground meat and the amount is quite large.

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:37.680
It's not just about dumplings. It's applicable for pork stuffing.

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:44.580
Thai fish sauce about 1 tsp

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:53.520
Chicken powder to add onion ginger water or meat can be

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.320
About 2 tsp chicken powder

00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:02.480
Stir in the same direction

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:07.540
If meat is bought in the supermarket

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.360
I suggest you can add some rice wine

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:12.600
I bought a fresh pig meat

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.740
I don’t think there is a problem with smell, so I’m not going to

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:22.860
Let's start the meat and let it go

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:39.280
If you are not afraid of onion ginger, you can also do not drain residue, cut into fine powder to join

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.080
Slowly add water to it

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:45.020
Add a little onion ginger water at a time and start stirring

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:51.460
Until the water cannot be absorbed by the meat, stirring is complete

00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:56.060
This part of the water is not like so much

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:59.820
Because of fear of too wet

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:06.640
wonton Because the cooking time is short, so it's okay

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:14.900
After the stirring is completed, it is also necessary to put in refrigeration for 20 to 30 minutes

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:17.060
Better operation

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:23.400
All the water was added, about 120c.c water

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:27.400
It is still possible to add onion ginger water

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:29.540
But I think it's almost

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:32.640
The meat is ready to finish

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:36.220
Finally stir in the coriander

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:39.980
The part of the coriander is very casual

00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:47.780
If you want to change to Italian style, you can also

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:49.980
Stir evenly

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:57.060
The coriander is special in the meat and I like it very much.

00:04:57.060 --> 00:05:06.000
So I add cilantro to the dishes I need stuffing

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:10.140
I really like that special aroma

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:16.880
About 1 tablespoon of sesame oil

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:19.160
Don't like it, don't add it

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:22.040
The filling is finished

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:27.400
Refrigeration 20~30min

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:31.160
Will be better
