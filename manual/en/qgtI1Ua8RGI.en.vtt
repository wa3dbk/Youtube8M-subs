Research universities are vital 
to our nation's prosperity 

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:16.240
and to our shared hopes 
for a healthier, more vibrant world. 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.640
At the University of Kansas, 
we contribute to our society 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:24.020
through our mission of educating 
leaders, building healthy 

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:27.840
communities, and making discoveries 
that change the world. 

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:32.140
That mission is central to all that we do, 
and guides us as

To succeed after graduation, 
and to continue on with a 

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:46.070
lifetime of learning, 
students need a range of skills and 

00:00:46.090 --> 00:00:48.490
knowledge, from critical thinking 
to a broader understanding 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.160
of our world. 

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:53.400
That's why we launched 
the KU Core Curriculum,

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:56.510
a comprehensive, 
university-wide improvement

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:58.080

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.830
Focused around six learning outcomes, 
the curriculum 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:04.360
integrates experiences vital 
to students' success in their 

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:08.550
careers and lives, such as 
study abroad, service learning, 

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:10.450

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:12.480
PAUL: To be doing original 
undergraduate research,

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:14.170
especially in a field like history,

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:17.190
and the opportunity 
to gain knowledge for myself

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:19.210
and then disseminate it to others,

00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:21.640
is something that I find 
very challenging,

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:24.010
but very rewarding at the same time.

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.700
We're also changing how we teach, 
by creating hybrid 

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.990
courses that combine 
online elements with traditional labs 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:33.460
