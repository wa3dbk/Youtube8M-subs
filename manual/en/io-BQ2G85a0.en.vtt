00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.908
-Happy Monday,
my fellow Minescraftmen.

00:00:01.908 --> 00:00:03.280
Hope you had
a heck of a weekend,

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:05.162
got plenty of rest,
ate all your vegetables,

00:00:05.162 --> 00:00:06.489
and kissed your mom a good-bye,

00:00:06.489 --> 00:00:08.122
'cause we've got some
heavy-liftin' to do.

00:00:08.122 --> 00:00:11.618
It's time for Let's Play!

00:00:11.618 --> 00:00:13.202
-Play more Minecraft.

00:00:13.202 --> 00:00:17.168
-Uh, yeah. Thanks, Scott
Pettersson, aka Captain Obvious.

00:00:17.168 --> 00:00:19.201
[laughs]
Now, where was I? I think--

00:00:19.201 --> 00:00:21.370
-Let's Play Minecraft #3!
Let's Play Minecraft #3!

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:23.203
Let's Play Minecraft #3!
Let's Play Minecraft #3!

00:00:23.203 --> 00:00:24.951
-I GET IT!
You want me to play more--

00:00:24.951 --> 00:00:26.035
-More Minecraft!!!

00:00:26.035 --> 00:00:27.761
-All right, you little griefers!

00:00:27.761 --> 00:00:29.394
You want more Minecraft,
you got it;

00:00:29.394 --> 00:00:32.100
but I'm gonna need some requests
of stuff to build pronto!

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:34.684
It'll sort of be like
Ask Orange, but with an axe,

00:00:34.684 --> 00:00:37.284
so I guess it's "Axe Orange."
[laughs]

00:00:37.284 --> 00:00:38.366
But seriously, I have an axe.

00:00:38.366 --> 00:00:42.699
[rock music plays]

00:00:42.699 --> 00:00:43.697
-Make a butt.

00:00:43.697 --> 00:00:47.122
-Make a butt? I've been waiting
my whole life for this moment!

00:00:47.122 --> 00:00:48.822
Whoo-hoo!
[laughs]

00:00:48.822 --> 00:00:49.997
All right, as you can see,

00:00:49.997 --> 00:00:52.074
we've built our butt out of TNT.

00:00:52.074 --> 00:00:54.662
But...I don't think
we built it big enough.

00:00:54.662 --> 00:00:56.446
Got to put some more
steps on the back porch,

00:00:56.446 --> 00:00:57.590
if you know what I'm saying.

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:58.531
Ha! You know what I'm saying?

00:00:58.531 --> 00:00:59.784
Seriously, does anyone
know what I'm saying?

00:00:59.784 --> 00:01:02.621
Doesn't matter, because building
butts is what I do best. Ha!

00:01:02.621 --> 00:01:06.336
The trick is you just gotta
"block" out some time. [laughs]

00:01:06.336 --> 00:01:08.014
I know, I know,
I should just shut up and work.

00:01:08.014 --> 00:01:10.095
All these jokes are
just holding up the rear.

00:01:10.095 --> 00:01:11.429
[laughs]:
Oh man.

00:01:11.429 --> 00:01:13.614
I can be such a "glute."
[laughs]

00:01:13.614 --> 00:01:16.402
And there you have it--
one big butt.

00:01:16.402 --> 00:01:19.781
Too bad it totally blows!
[laughs]

00:01:19.781 --> 00:01:22.900
♪ And another butt down,
another butt down ♪

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:25.026
♪ Another butt bites the dust ♪
Whoo!

00:01:25.026 --> 00:01:26.701
♪ Hey, gonna get you too ♪

00:01:26.701 --> 00:01:28.618
♪ Another butt bites the dust ♪
Ha!

00:01:28.618 --> 00:01:30.248
-Build a giant pear.

00:01:30.248 --> 00:01:32.572
-Build a giant pear? Boring.

00:01:32.572 --> 00:01:35.369
-(Pear) Hey! I heard that!
-Okay, okay.

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:36.454
I'll build a giant "pear"...

00:01:36.454 --> 00:01:38.668
of butts!
[laughs]

00:01:38.668 --> 00:01:40.931
'Cause one good butt
deserves another.

00:01:40.931 --> 00:01:42.967
Yup-yup, everything's
lookin' pretty good back here.

00:01:42.967 --> 00:01:44.842
Chisel this block,
drop off some fire,

00:01:44.842 --> 00:01:47.471
and RUN!!!
[laughs]

00:01:47.471 --> 00:01:49.966
Double exploding butt
all the way!

00:01:49.966 --> 00:01:51.229
Oh, my goodness!

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:52.634
No, but seriously,
you gotta be careful.

00:01:52.634 --> 00:01:54.538
Exploding butt is
highly contagious.

00:01:54.538 --> 00:01:56.206
It's like throwing
gas on a fire.

00:01:56.206 --> 00:01:58.765
[laughs]
I can't stop. Exploding butts!

00:01:58.765 --> 00:02:00.403
-Grief a server!

00:02:00.403 --> 00:02:03.023
-Grief a server?
No way, Vampiregirl!

00:02:03.023 --> 00:02:05.204
If I do that, she won't bring me
any more cheese fries.

00:02:05.204 --> 00:02:06.287
Speaking of which...

00:02:06.287 --> 00:02:08.408
[bell dings]
-Order up.

00:02:08.408 --> 00:02:10.536
-[chuckles]
Thanks, Edna.

00:02:10.536 --> 00:02:12.373
You know how much
I love these cheese fries.

00:02:12.373 --> 00:02:14.869
[munches loudly]

00:02:14.869 --> 00:02:16.912
Exploding butts!

00:02:16.912 --> 00:02:17.999
-Build a house.

00:02:17.999 --> 00:02:20.448
-Build a house?
[burps]

00:02:20.448 --> 00:02:22.531
Sorry, that was the
cheese fries talking.

00:02:22.531 --> 00:02:24.538
What I meant to say is,
"Bor-ing."

00:02:24.538 --> 00:02:27.426
That's even more boring
than building a giant pear.

00:02:27.426 --> 00:02:29.370
-(Pear)
I can still hear you, you know?

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.124
-And the point is, I don't play
video games to get bored.

00:02:32.124 --> 00:02:34.884
I can get bored all by myself.
Seriously, happens all the time.

00:02:34.884 --> 00:02:37.182
Thank goodness I have a
super-short attention span.

00:02:37.182 --> 00:02:39.318
What were we talking about?
Oh yeah, cheese fries.

00:02:39.318 --> 00:02:41.732
Oh, thank goodness
I have cheese fries. Edna!

00:02:41.732 --> 00:02:43.601
-Build a house out of TNT!

00:02:43.601 --> 00:02:46.243
-Ehh, what's this now?
Build a house agai--

00:02:46.243 --> 00:02:47.953
Wait, out of TNT?

00:02:47.953 --> 00:02:50.370
[record scratches]
Edna, cancel the fries!

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:54.199
I got some building to do!
[laughs devilishly]

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:57.037
You know, some say the best
foundations are built on trust.

00:02:57.037 --> 00:02:58.448
I prefer TNT.

00:02:58.448 --> 00:03:00.579
Sure, it's unstable,
highly explosive,

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:01.843
and ridiculously dangerous,

00:03:01.843 --> 00:03:04.421
but-- ha-ha!-- but--
ha-ha-ha!-- but...

00:03:04.421 --> 00:03:06.119
[sighs]
What was I saying again?

00:03:06.119 --> 00:03:08.340
Was I talking about my
short attention span again?

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:09.623
I do that all the time.

00:03:09.623 --> 00:03:11.707
No wait-- oh yeah,
that's right. TNT.

00:03:11.707 --> 00:03:13.926
It goes boom. Orange likey boom.

00:03:13.926 --> 00:03:16.105
That's all you really
needed to know. [guffaws]

00:03:16.105 --> 00:03:18.311
A house made of TNT? Pshaw.

00:03:18.311 --> 00:03:20.949
When I'm done, you'll be calling
this the "Temple of Boom!"

00:03:20.949 --> 00:03:24.780
Why? 'Cause Orangey likey boom.
[laughs]

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:27.151
Oh, I just said that two seconds
ago. Weren't you listening?

00:03:27.151 --> 00:03:29.399
Who's got the lousy
attention span now? Ha!

00:03:29.399 --> 00:03:32.238
Well-- [yawns]
it's morning now.

00:03:32.238 --> 00:03:33.366
I really wish I hadn't canceled

00:03:33.366 --> 00:03:34.998
that second order
of cheese fries.

00:03:34.998 --> 00:03:37.074
Who knew Minecraft
could be such hard work?

00:03:37.074 --> 00:03:38.955
These graveyard shifts
are killing me.

00:03:38.955 --> 00:03:41.504
But I'm a slave to the boom.
Whatcha gonna do?

00:03:41.504 --> 00:03:44.831
[grumbles] Who built this
chimney? It's awful!

00:03:44.831 --> 00:03:47.367
Santa will never fit!
That's why I'm tearing it down.

00:03:47.367 --> 00:03:48.867
Don't even try
and talk me out of it.

00:03:48.867 --> 00:03:51.373
None of it works!
Totally ruining the feng shui!

00:03:51.373 --> 00:03:52.140
Aah!

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:54.808
All right!
House is looking good!

00:03:54.808 --> 00:03:56.478
Just slap a door on it
and we'll be all done.

00:03:56.478 --> 00:03:58.644
I could just put one door on,
but if Grapefruit comes over,

00:03:58.644 --> 00:04:01.052
he'll never be able to fit,
which, come to think of it,

00:04:01.052 --> 00:04:02.352
it's not such a bad thing.

00:04:02.352 --> 00:04:04.102
Ooh-ooh!
I'm gonna need a window too!

00:04:04.102 --> 00:04:05.616
I get cranky when
I don't get enough light...

00:04:05.616 --> 00:04:07.532
or sleep.
Did I mention I haven't slept?

00:04:07.532 --> 00:04:08.980
[brays]
I love coffee.

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:11.025
And kicking through doors!
[laughs]

00:04:11.025 --> 00:04:13.375
Aw, that was adorable.
[laughs]

00:04:13.375 --> 00:04:14.691
Seriously though,
I hated that door.

00:04:14.691 --> 00:04:16.570
All right, time to burn this--

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:18.952
Oh wait, no, no, no, duh.
I forgot the flowers.

00:04:18.952 --> 00:04:21.161
I would've felt so dumb
if I'd blown up the house

00:04:21.161 --> 00:04:22.755
without planting flowers first.

00:04:22.755 --> 00:04:24.340
I mean, really.
What would the neighbors think?

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:26.122
Seeing as how they
don't make fences out of TNT,

00:04:26.122 --> 00:04:27.593
I'll just have to go
with the real thing.

00:04:27.593 --> 00:04:29.372
Besides, I don't want
any goats getting in here

00:04:29.372 --> 00:04:31.220
and eating the flowers.
Nope, not gonna do it.

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:33.452
Not gonna deal with it!
[laughs]

00:04:33.452 --> 00:04:35.260
All right, gang.

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:37.226
Time to light the fires
and kick the tires!

00:04:37.226 --> 00:04:38.788
So long, Temple of Boom.

00:04:38.788 --> 00:04:42.367
WE'LL NEVER FORGET YOU!

00:04:42.367 --> 00:04:44.388
Oh-ho-ho! Whoa!

00:04:44.388 --> 00:04:47.644
Oh, from this angle, you can
see the living boom! [laughs]

00:04:47.644 --> 00:04:49.068
All right, guys.

00:04:49.068 --> 00:04:52.398
As usual, it's been extremely
dangerous and extremely fun.

00:04:52.398 --> 00:04:54.830
Hit me up in the comments below;
let me know what you want to see

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:56.323
next time on
Let's Play Minecraft.

00:04:56.323 --> 00:04:58.791
As for me,
I think it's time for a nap....

00:04:58.791 --> 00:05:02.166
AND CHEESE FRIES!!
[laughs, imitates munching]

00:05:02.166 --> 00:05:03.125
EXPLODING BUTTS!

00:05:03.125 --> 00:05:05.747
Timber!
What the he-- okay.

00:05:05.747 --> 00:05:08.287
All right, trees don't fall--
okay.

00:05:08.287 --> 00:05:10.708
Chopping down a floating tree.
Hmm.

00:05:10.708 --> 00:05:12.622
Yeah, I should probably go home.

00:05:12.622 --> 00:05:14.854
I'm "trunk."
[laughs]

00:05:14.854 --> 00:05:17.127
Wow! What the?
