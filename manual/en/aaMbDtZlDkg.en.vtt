00:00:00.104 --> 00:00:02.786
- Hey guys, so a few weeks
ago in my travel tips video,

00:00:02.786 --> 00:00:06.713
I asked if you guys wanted to
see a DIY luggage tag video.

00:00:06.713 --> 00:00:09.664
And you guys said you did, so here it is.

00:00:09.664 --> 00:00:11.645
I'm going to be making
two different versions,

00:00:11.645 --> 00:00:14.126
one made out of duct tape,
and one made out of leather.

00:00:14.126 --> 00:00:15.221
Let's get started.

00:00:15.221 --> 00:00:16.451
(gentle guitar music)

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:19.464
So for the duct tape luggage tag

00:00:19.464 --> 00:00:21.309
you're going to need three rolls of tape.

00:00:21.309 --> 00:00:23.990
Two with contrasting colors or patterns,

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:26.509
and then one roll of clear packing tape.

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:28.766
Start by cutting off a piece
of the solid color tape

00:00:28.766 --> 00:00:31.799
that is about as long as you
want your luggage tag to be.

00:00:31.799 --> 00:00:33.184
Cut off a second piece of tape,

00:00:33.184 --> 00:00:35.564
and stick it directly on
top of the first piece,

00:00:35.564 --> 00:00:37.272
smoothing out any air bubbles.

00:00:37.272 --> 00:00:38.689
To make it a little bit stronger,

00:00:38.689 --> 00:00:41.114
cut out a third piece that's
the same length again,

00:00:41.114 --> 00:00:42.530
and stick it directly on top,

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:43.529
and then flip it over

00:00:43.529 --> 00:00:45.852
and do the same thing on the other side.

00:00:45.852 --> 00:00:48.091
Then trim the edges and you
should have a piece of duct tape

00:00:48.091 --> 00:00:49.671
that is four layers thick.

00:00:49.671 --> 00:00:50.994
I want to add a decorative shape

00:00:50.994 --> 00:00:52.445
to the end of my luggage tag,

00:00:52.445 --> 00:00:54.411
so I'm going to grab
a little business card

00:00:54.411 --> 00:00:56.705
and fold it in half to make a pattern.

00:00:56.705 --> 00:00:57.836
Once you have the shape that you want,

00:00:57.836 --> 00:01:00.431
trace that onto the duct
tape, and then cut it out.

00:01:00.431 --> 00:01:02.291
Now grab your packing
tape and cut off a piece

00:01:02.291 --> 00:01:04.646
that is the same size as your duct tape.

00:01:04.646 --> 00:01:06.411
Cut off a second piece and stick that

00:01:06.411 --> 00:01:08.432
directly on top of the first piece.

00:01:08.432 --> 00:01:10.927
Trim the edges so it is
exactly the same size

00:01:10.927 --> 00:01:12.737
and shape as the duct tape.

00:01:12.737 --> 00:01:15.258
Now grab a long piece
of your patterned tape

00:01:15.258 --> 00:01:17.326
and stick it directly to your cutting mat.

00:01:17.326 --> 00:01:19.099
Use your ruler and X-Acto knife

00:01:19.099 --> 00:01:20.992
to cut off a quarter inch strip.

00:01:20.992 --> 00:01:22.269
Then, cut a piece out of that

00:01:22.269 --> 00:01:24.835
that is the length of the
short side of your duct tape.

00:01:24.835 --> 00:01:27.169
Use this to finish the
top edge of the duct tape,

00:01:27.169 --> 00:01:28.631
and then trim off the edges.

00:01:28.631 --> 00:01:30.316
Then, cut a piece of your patterned tape

00:01:30.316 --> 00:01:33.380
that is the same length as the
long side of your duct tape.

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:35.016
Use that to tape the duct tape

00:01:35.016 --> 00:01:36.596
and the packing tape together,

00:01:36.596 --> 00:01:38.813
folding it over and then
trimming off the edges.

00:01:38.813 --> 00:01:40.682
Do the same thing on the other side.

00:01:49.111 --> 00:01:52.001
To close off the bottom, cut
a piece of your patterned tape

00:01:52.001 --> 00:01:54.357
that is as wide as your luggage tag,

00:01:54.357 --> 00:01:56.379
and then stick it to the bottom triangle.

00:01:56.379 --> 00:01:57.656
Cut off all of the excess tape

00:01:57.656 --> 00:01:58.780
so that you just have two flaps

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:00.558
hanging over the edge like this.

00:02:00.558 --> 00:02:02.032
And then, just fold those over.

00:02:02.032 --> 00:02:03.540
Cut off another piece of duct tape,

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:05.492
and tape it over the triangle on the back,

00:02:05.492 --> 00:02:07.733
and then trim off the excess completely.

00:02:07.733 --> 00:02:09.414
Now that your luggage
tag is all put together,

00:02:09.414 --> 00:02:11.621
grab a ruler and measure exactly how big

00:02:11.621 --> 00:02:14.720
the paper with your address
should be to fit inside.

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:16.219
You could cut this out of paper

00:02:16.219 --> 00:02:18.436
and hand-write your
name and address on it,

00:02:18.436 --> 00:02:21.119
but I decided to make a label in Photoshop

00:02:21.119 --> 00:02:22.232
and print it out.

00:02:22.232 --> 00:02:23.777
Then just cut this out of your paper,

00:02:23.777 --> 00:02:25.552
and slide it into your luggage tag.

00:02:25.552 --> 00:02:26.726
To attach it to your suitcase,

00:02:26.726 --> 00:02:29.580
grab the rest of your long
piece of patterned duct tape

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:33.018
and make a long, thin strip by
folding it over onto itself.

00:02:37.694 --> 00:02:39.916
Then grab your X-Acto
knife or utility knife

00:02:39.916 --> 00:02:42.236
and cut a slit at the
top of your luggage tag,

00:02:42.236 --> 00:02:44.255
cutting through both the packing tape

00:02:44.255 --> 00:02:45.974
and the duct tape layers.

00:02:45.974 --> 00:02:48.319
This may take a minute to cut
through all of the layers,

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:49.550
but just keep at it.

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:50.292
Once you've done that,

00:02:50.292 --> 00:02:52.220
just thread the long
piece of patterned tape

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:53.026
through the slit.

00:02:53.026 --> 00:02:54.995
For one final touch,
I'm just going to grab

00:02:54.995 --> 00:02:57.096
one of these gold letters that I used

00:02:57.096 --> 00:02:59.541
in my business card banner project.

00:02:59.541 --> 00:03:01.635
This time it is a K for Karen,

00:03:01.635 --> 00:03:04.360
and I'm going to stick it to
the back of my luggage tag.

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:05.233
And that's it.

00:03:05.233 --> 00:03:07.032
Your duct tape luggage tag is finished.

00:03:07.032 --> 00:03:08.249
To attach it to your suitcase,

00:03:08.249 --> 00:03:10.103
just cut off another small piece of tape

00:03:10.103 --> 00:03:13.373
and use that to attach the two
ends of the hanging together.

00:03:13.373 --> 00:03:15.458
(gentle guitar music)

00:03:24.743 --> 00:03:28.128
Okay, so now it is time to
make the leather luggage tag.

00:03:28.128 --> 00:03:30.230
Since you don't need a ton
of leather for this project,

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:32.319
I just got a handful of leather scraps

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:34.408
from a recycled craft supply store.

00:03:34.408 --> 00:03:36.235
And I only paid a couple dollars for them.

00:03:36.235 --> 00:03:37.613
Or, if you don't wanna use leather,

00:03:37.613 --> 00:03:39.993
you could probably do it
just as well with felt.

00:03:39.993 --> 00:03:42.129
Let me know if any of you guys try that.

00:03:42.129 --> 00:03:43.348
Okay, so I'm going to be using

00:03:43.348 --> 00:03:45.750
this piece of gray
leather for this project.

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.248
Decide how big you want
your luggage tag to be,

00:03:48.248 --> 00:03:50.709
and then draw a guide on
the back of your leather.

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:52.887
I made mine four inches by two inches.

00:03:52.887 --> 00:03:55.051
Carefully cut that out,
trying to keep your edges

00:03:55.051 --> 00:03:56.625
as straight as possible.

00:03:56.625 --> 00:03:58.379
Then trace that piece and cut it out

00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:01.134
so you have two pieces that
are the exact same size.

00:04:01.134 --> 00:04:03.293
Now, take one piece and draw a guide

00:04:03.293 --> 00:04:04.842
for a window in the center.

00:04:04.842 --> 00:04:07.033
Take your scissors and
carefully cut it out.

00:04:07.033 --> 00:04:09.888
Now at this point, you could
skip straight to the gluing.

00:04:09.888 --> 00:04:11.837
But I'm going to add a
little bit of decoration

00:04:11.837 --> 00:04:14.082
with this seafoam colored
embroidery thread.

00:04:14.082 --> 00:04:15.657
Make sure you also have a needle

00:04:15.657 --> 00:04:17.468
that is big enough for embroidery thread.

00:04:17.468 --> 00:04:18.814
A regular, small sewing needle

00:04:18.814 --> 00:04:20.312
won't be good enough for this.

00:04:20.312 --> 00:04:22.436
Put down a cutting mat,
and then grab your awl,

00:04:22.436 --> 00:04:23.993
or if you don't have an awl,

00:04:23.993 --> 00:04:25.629
a thumbtack could work too.

00:04:25.629 --> 00:04:26.987
Decide where you're going to sew.

00:04:26.987 --> 00:04:29.833
I'm going to stitch an outline
around the inner rectangle,

00:04:29.833 --> 00:04:32.594
So take your awl, and start
poking holes in the leather

00:04:32.594 --> 00:04:35.311
as close together or as
far apart as you want.

00:04:35.311 --> 00:04:37.297
Technically, you don't
have to do this step,

00:04:37.297 --> 00:04:39.236
but it's so much easier to sew leather

00:04:39.236 --> 00:04:41.114
if the holes are already there.

00:04:41.114 --> 00:04:42.451
Once you've poked all of the holes,

00:04:42.451 --> 00:04:45.083
thread your needle and start sewing.

00:04:52.282 --> 00:04:54.071
And then, once you've
gone all the way around,

00:04:54.071 --> 00:04:56.684
tie off the ends and grab
your other piece of leather.

00:04:56.684 --> 00:04:58.785
Sketch out whatever
design you want to make.

00:04:58.785 --> 00:05:01.014
I decided to sew a cute little heart.

00:05:01.014 --> 00:05:02.907
Then grab your awl, and once again,

00:05:02.907 --> 00:05:05.045
start poking holes around the outline.

00:05:05.045 --> 00:05:06.471
Once you've gone all the way around,

00:05:06.471 --> 00:05:07.447
thread your needle again

00:05:07.447 --> 00:05:10.271
and sew all the way around the outline.

00:05:14.672 --> 00:05:17.269
And there you go. A
cute little sewn heart.

00:05:17.269 --> 00:05:19.206
So now that the front and
the back are finished,

00:05:19.206 --> 00:05:20.706
it's time to glue them together.

00:05:20.706 --> 00:05:22.667
I'm going to be using E-6000,

00:05:22.667 --> 00:05:24.049
which is a really strong glue

00:05:24.049 --> 00:05:25.952
that works really well on leather.

00:05:25.952 --> 00:05:27.565
Just open up your glue and apply a line

00:05:27.565 --> 00:05:29.710
around three sides of the luggage tag,

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:31.916
being careful not to apply too much glue.

00:05:31.916 --> 00:05:34.472
Place the other piece on
top, and press it down

00:05:34.472 --> 00:05:36.110
to really set the glue.

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:38.270
And use a tissue to
wipe off any excess glue

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:39.822
that leaks out the sides.

00:05:39.822 --> 00:05:41.707
And then go and wash your hands right away

00:05:41.707 --> 00:05:43.677
if you got glue all over them like I did,

00:05:43.677 --> 00:05:45.791
because it can cause some minor irritation

00:05:45.791 --> 00:05:47.788
if you leave it on your
hands for too long.

00:05:47.788 --> 00:05:50.263
So set it aside, and let it dry overnight.

00:05:50.263 --> 00:05:52.490
The next day, once the
glue has fully dried,

00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:54.929
trim the edges to make them
look a little bit neater,

00:05:54.929 --> 00:05:57.224
making sure that you don't
cut all of the glue off.

00:05:57.224 --> 00:06:00.071
Then once again, measure how
big the address label should be

00:06:00.071 --> 00:06:02.012
and print it off, or write it by hand.

00:06:02.012 --> 00:06:04.449
Since there's no plastic
built into this luggage tag,

00:06:04.449 --> 00:06:06.330
I'm just going to cover
it with packing tape

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:08.569
so it doesn't get ruined
if I am out in the rain.

00:06:08.569 --> 00:06:11.112
So just slide that in, trimming
it down if you have to,

00:06:11.112 --> 00:06:12.928
until it fits nice and snug.

00:06:12.928 --> 00:06:14.607
To attach it to your suitcase,

00:06:14.607 --> 00:06:17.207
cut off a piece of string
and fold it in half.

00:06:17.207 --> 00:06:19.250
Thread the loop through
the luggage tag window,

00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:21.144
and then pull the two
ends through the loop

00:06:21.144 --> 00:06:22.571
and pull that tight.

00:06:26.923 --> 00:06:27.865
Grab your suitcase

00:06:27.865 --> 00:06:30.040
and tie the two ends
of the string together.

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:32.045
And you can dab the
knot with a little glue

00:06:32.045 --> 00:06:34.163
if you really wanna make
sure it doesn't come apart.

00:06:34.163 --> 00:06:34.906
And there you go.

00:06:34.906 --> 00:06:37.209
Your own custom leather luggage tag.

00:06:47.961 --> 00:06:50.356
So I hope you guys liked
these luggage tags.

00:06:50.356 --> 00:06:51.698
If you want to make them,

00:06:51.698 --> 00:06:53.509
I put a list of all the materials

00:06:53.509 --> 00:06:55.763
in the new Sublime list right down below.

00:06:55.763 --> 00:06:58.480
So let me know in the Comments
which one you liked better.

00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:00.928
And also, if you could
travel anywhere in the world,

00:07:00.928 --> 00:07:02.228
where would you wanna go?

00:07:02.228 --> 00:07:04.865
So if you missed my
last travel tips video,

00:07:04.865 --> 00:07:06.767
you can watch that right here.

00:07:06.767 --> 00:07:09.066
And if you're just really
in a DIY mood right now,

00:07:09.066 --> 00:07:11.180
I put up a video that's
three projects you can make

00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:12.620
with old business cards.

00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:14.267
You can watch that video right here.

00:07:14.267 --> 00:07:15.440
Thank you guys so much for watching.

00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:17.067
I will see you all next time.

00:07:17.067 --> 00:07:19.265
