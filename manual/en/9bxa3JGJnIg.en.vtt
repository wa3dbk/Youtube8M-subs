00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.439
Welcome to BirthdayBullseye.com!

00:00:09.439 --> 00:00:13.039
we are making a can cake which is
basically a cake made out of a 12 pack

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:16.529
of your favorite drink - guaranteed
be a hit!

00:00:16.529 --> 00:00:19.149
here are the things you're going to need

00:00:19.149 --> 00:00:24.599
first get some wide ribbon and some thin ribbon, a bow, three different pieces of

00:00:24.599 --> 00:00:26.640
cardboard cut 3 inches

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.369
6 inches and 9 inches in diameter

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:34.399
some scissors, strong tape, regular tape and
wrapping paper, and of course your

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:36.190
12 pack

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:38.160
clear yourself some space

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.480
and get started

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.180
first you are going to wrap your cardboard

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:46.300
keep one side smooth

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:49.070
but then you don't have to worry too much
about the other side, just make sure it

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:54.110
gets covered

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:57.430
then do the exact same thing with the
other two pieces

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:03.700
don't worry too much about getting it perfect

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:05.420
then get your nine-inch piece

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:08.110
turn it smooth-side down

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:11.939
and start placing cans around the edges

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:15.600
you want the pretty side of the can facing out

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.570
and you're going to need about 8 cans
take this layer

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:24.080
yep, that's 8

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:28.659
okay now you're gonna need to put some
strong tape on the bottom to secure them

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:29.950
to the base

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:32.909
so go ahead and get a big strip of
tape

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.530
put it on the bottom of the cans

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:36.970
like that

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:40.690
and squish it down

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:43.509
that's going to make it sturdy so that you
can actually take it

00:01:43.509 --> 00:01:44.470
to

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:49.240
the birthday party

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.590
now get some wide ribbon

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.280
now you're going to cut a strip long enough to
actually tie a bow

00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:01.020
now don't go skimpy, cut it long enough.
you can always cut it shorter later

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:03.160
tie your bow

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:09.059
we'll make it pretty later

00:02:09.059 --> 00:02:12.599
then tape down the six inch piece of
cardboard

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:13.629
on top

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:15.719
of this layer

00:02:15.719 --> 00:02:17.329
pretty side up

00:02:17.329 --> 00:02:22.589
now you're going to go ahead and do the same steps with these four cans

00:02:22.589 --> 00:02:25.959
making sure the pretty side is out, taping
them down

00:02:25.959 --> 00:02:27.559
to the tier base

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:30.489
and then wrapping them with the ribbon

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:33.999
of wide ribbon mind you

00:02:33.999 --> 00:02:36.799
then grab the top piece and tape it down
too

00:02:36.799 --> 00:02:38.519
with the strong tape

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:42.369
then you're going to take your thin ribbon and
cut it in pieces too

00:02:42.369 --> 00:02:46.529
you want these ribbons to be about
twelve to eighteen inches long, not too

00:02:46.529 --> 00:02:49.529
long but not too short either

00:02:49.529 --> 00:02:52.429
get some different colors because that makes it fun

00:02:52.429 --> 00:02:58.989
and tape them all to the top using
regular tape

00:02:58.989 --> 00:03:03.289
and when you've finished securing that
grab yourself an extra strong piece of

00:03:03.289 --> 00:03:04.659
tape again

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:06.999
put it on top and add your bow

00:03:06.999 --> 00:03:10.629
and then curl that ribbon

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:17.629
makes it pretty

00:03:18.289 --> 00:03:22.149
great. okay now it's time to fix those
bows in the front

00:03:22.149 --> 00:03:24.049
you'll want to make them a little bit smaller

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:28.430
and you want to trim the edges to be just
about as big as the loops are

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:29.729
up top

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:32.529
so make your loop

00:03:32.529 --> 00:03:37.599
and trim those edges to be the same size

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:41.139
straighten it out

00:03:41.139 --> 00:03:42.499
isn't that pretty?

00:03:42.499 --> 00:03:46.069
now grab yourself a card

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:48.169
and you're going to need

00:03:48.169 --> 00:03:50.369
a candle

00:03:50.369 --> 00:03:56.079
now if you just put the candle on top
like in the bow, it's gonna fall out

00:03:56.079 --> 00:04:00.229
so instead get yourself a tea light
candle, burn it a little bit, let it

00:04:00.229 --> 00:04:02.989
melt, put your birthday candle in there

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:03.919
and then

00:04:03.919 --> 00:04:07.469
hide the tea light in the bow

00:04:07.469 --> 00:04:10.299
tada!

00:04:10.299 --> 00:04:17.299

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:21.759
