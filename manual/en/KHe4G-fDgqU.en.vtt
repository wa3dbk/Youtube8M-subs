00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:05.970
Hi guys, and welcome back to Haul Rox on Videojug
with me, Alana.

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:10.510
This week I'm going to be doing
a haul on kind of like smart, casual work

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:18.169
wear
that's quite tailored and a little bit structured.

00:00:18.169 --> 00:00:21.570
Now for work wear, you don't want anything
too crazy

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:29.890
jewelry wise, so I got this little pearl bracelet,
but it's from ASOS.

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:34.540
It's a brand called Orelia
I think that's how you say it, and I got it

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:36.510
for ten pounds.

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.760
It's very pretty and very supple, quite delicate
actually.

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:45.480
It's got these little tiny pearls that go
all the way around

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.610
and it's got little gold hearts at the bottom,
which is so sweet.

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:51.850
I got this skirt from ASOS.

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:57.010
It was 32 pounds, and it's
a really, a really good appropriate length

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:58.770
for a work skirt.

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.580
It comes to about the knee length, and it's
such a bright color.

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:06.381
I mean, if you're ever bored with work wear,
you can

00:01:06.381 --> 00:01:10.962
really like add a big old color to your outfit,
so this one

00:01:10.962 --> 00:01:14.799
actually has a, sort of like a painted effect
to it, with a

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:18.460
lace overlay, and it has a lining as well.

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:23.429
I think this would
look really nice with a, kind of like a, leotard

00:01:23.429 --> 00:01:28.179
body-con
top, and a very smart blazer and some pumps.

00:01:28.179 --> 00:01:30.200
I got this bag from Oasis.

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:35.659
It was 28 pounds, which is
actually quite good value for money for Oasis.

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:39.600
What I really like about this bag is the paneling.

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:47.780
I'm such a green fan, like a lime green, and
it's got a little section here in the back,

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:51.149
gold edging, a really cute
buckle in the front.

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:57.439
It's got this chain detail as well,
which is really nice and really elegant and

00:01:57.439 --> 00:01:58.439
classy.

00:01:58.439 --> 00:02:00.530
It's a great bag to just shove like, your
essentials in

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.029
and just like, chuck over your shoulder.

00:02:03.029 --> 00:02:06.990
For work wear, I love Mango so much.

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.060
I think it's
really good value for money.

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:16.290
I got these shorts for 22.99
from Mango, and they're so, so flattering.

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:18.520
They kind of just
float over your legs.

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:23.739
They're not too clingy; they're very
smart and look really nice with a blazer.

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:26.420
Um, team them
up with like, a pair of wedges and you're

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:27.420
good to go.

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.420
ASOS has a really good jewelry range; they
have a brand

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:38.620
called Pieces, and they have some really amazing
pieces, but they have this really amazing

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:39.620
necklace.

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:40.620
How nice is this?

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:45.239
If I wore this, I would probably
wear it with a shirt like this actually, have

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:47.770
it kind of
underneath the collar.

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:53.190
It's very tribally, and has all these
little like, ridges and sections to it.

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:56.409
It's a nice little number
to sort of take from work to, you know, a

00:02:56.409 --> 00:02:58.299
night out afterwards.

00:02:58.299 --> 00:03:03.200
Now you know how much I love ASOS, and I think
it's much easier to do my shopping online

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:04.310
as well.

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:09.640
So I got this shirt/blouse for 25 pounds at
ASOS, This

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:13.580
is going to be one of my staple pieces for
this summer.

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:17.689
It's just a plain black vest, and it's got
like, a sheer

00:03:17.689 --> 00:03:21.209
texture to it, so I'd probably have to wear
it with straps

00:03:21.209 --> 00:03:23.439
up underneath, for work anyway.

00:03:23.439 --> 00:03:27.700
But you know, if you
want to make it a little bit more sexy after

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:29.890
work, you
could always, you know, just wear a bra underneath.

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:34.610
I mean, you could wear skinny jeans with it,
you could wear like a pair of shorts with

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:36.540
it;
it kind of is one of those pieces that

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:39.840
goes with everything, and it's great, it's
got no sleeves

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.629
as well, so when you do get hot and flushed
in the summer,

00:03:42.629 --> 00:03:43.700
it's not going to be a problem.

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:47.840
The best thing about summer is getting to
wear so many

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:52.830
cute dresses, and this is one of my favorites
I've found.

00:03:52.830 --> 00:03:56.450
This one is from ASOS, and it's 55 pounds.

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:58.040
It's such
an appropriate length.

00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:02.549
It comes to about the knee, and
it's got this little belt that goes with it.

00:04:02.549 --> 00:04:05.799
It really like, cinches
you in at the waist, which is where you want

00:04:05.799 --> 00:04:07.620
to be
cinched in, and it's got this really nice

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:11.090
detailing, like
round the top, kind of like crochet effect.

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:13.520
It's got the low
sleeves as well.

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:17.859
It's really pretty and a real summer
number, especially the color as well.

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:19.180
It's perfect.

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:21.139
It's not coat season anymore.

00:04:21.139 --> 00:04:24.660
We can wear, you know,
like a lightweight blazer, and this one is

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:26.240
perfect.

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:30.000
This
one is from Mango, and it's 59.99.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.650
It's so structured,
and it's got kind of like, shoulder pads in

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:34.569
it, a really
nice material.

00:04:34.569 --> 00:04:40.970
It's not too heavy, it's very throwback 80s
with a modern twist kind of feel.

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:42.759
It hasn't got a collar,
which I really like.

00:04:42.759 --> 00:04:45.979
It's really sleek, and it hasn't got
fasteners either.

00:04:45.979 --> 00:04:49.830
It's one of those pieces that you can
just throw on top of anything.

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:53.840
Nautical is also really
on trend this season, so a jacket like this

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:54.840
is great.

00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:58.280
If you want something a bit more office wear,
a little

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:00.690
smarter, this dress is such a good option.

00:05:00.690 --> 00:05:03.610
It's from
Warehouse, and it's 68 pounds.

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:06.560
It's got lots of different
panels there.

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:13.550
It's got a really nice cream section with
blacks and grays, and this is the best bit.

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:16.250
The back is really flattering.

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:21.259
It's got like this open back
here, with the v, so it's quite sexy, but

00:05:21.259 --> 00:05:25.669
in a very smart,
classy way, and it's got a little section

00:05:25.669 --> 00:05:27.810
at the top as well,
so it holds everything in place.

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:32.569
I would team this with
like, a pair of smart horseshoe heels and

00:05:32.569 --> 00:05:34.020
a smart
blazer.

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:35.020
It's a really good option.

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:37.349
You can just take
the blazer off when it gets a little bit hot

00:05:37.349 --> 00:05:39.069
and you'll
still look really, really smart.

00:05:39.069 --> 00:05:43.690
So I got these shoes because I had so many
recommendations from a few of my friends,

00:05:43.690 --> 00:05:46.910
even
my mom, even a customer in the shop actually

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:49.139
told
me to buy them because she was coming in to

00:05:49.139 --> 00:05:50.139
buy a
second pair.

00:05:50.139 --> 00:05:53.069
That's how good, that's how
good I know they are.

00:05:53.069 --> 00:05:59.190
These are from Clarks, and
they are 54.99, and they are so smart.

00:05:59.190 --> 00:06:01.389
They do them
in like a range of colors.

00:06:01.389 --> 00:06:04.979
They do them in this shade
which are nude, they do them in gray, black

00:06:04.979 --> 00:06:05.979
and white.

00:06:05.979 --> 00:06:08.759
This is kind of like a nudie-pink color.

00:06:08.759 --> 00:06:11.639
The reason
these are so great are you can't get such

00:06:11.639 --> 00:06:15.160
a decent
pair of shoes, and they really, really last

00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:19.470
a long time,
and if you are at work all day, these are

00:06:19.470 --> 00:06:21.349
so
comfortable.

00:06:21.349 --> 00:06:25.629
It says softwear inside them, and I
know for a fact they are, because so many

00:06:25.629 --> 00:06:26.629
people
told me.

00:06:26.629 --> 00:06:28.289
They're so on trend as well.

00:06:28.289 --> 00:06:32.770
These go with
trousers, skirts, dresses; they will go with

00:06:32.770 --> 00:06:33.770
everything.

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:37.050
And they also have this little patent detail
on them,

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:39.820
and this is a little bit of something extra
to them.

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:44.370
I found these trousers for 35 pounds in Top
Shop,

00:06:44.370 --> 00:06:49.180
and they are quite smart fabric, but they
have that really

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:51.840
fun element to them, they've got little tiny
elephants

00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:52.840
all over them.

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:55.860
These would look so cute with
a little white shirt and maybe a little black

00:06:55.860 --> 00:07:00.220
blazer,
just something a little bit quirky and different.

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:03.000
Next up I have these shoes from Top Shop.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:04.419
They're
35 pounds.

00:07:04.419 --> 00:07:09.770
Now you can't get summer without
a pair of some sort of ballet shoes or flats.

00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:13.610
These
are in a really, really cute pink color, and

00:07:13.610 --> 00:07:16.310
they're
real leather, really breathable as well, especially

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:18.129
with the little bit of gaps in them.

00:07:18.129 --> 00:07:20.800
So I'd probably
wear these with like a skirt or dress, just

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:24.270
to sort of
finish it off with a real feminine touch.

00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:29.840
This dress is so great to go from work to
a night out, or even just drinks.

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:33.020
It's from Mango,
and it's 22.99, and it's got

00:07:33.020 --> 00:07:36.090
that bandage effect to it, that really cinches
you in

00:07:36.090 --> 00:07:38.040
where you want to be cinched in.

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:40.530
Nautical is also
so on trend, like I said.

00:07:40.530 --> 00:07:42.720
This isn't just like a boring
nautical sandstripe.

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:47.650
It's actually got the thinner
stripe and goes all the way down to the bottom,

00:07:47.650 --> 00:07:49.190
very
flattering.

00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:54.460
I've worn this actually before with a little
blazer, a little pair of heels.

00:07:54.460 --> 00:07:57.139
It's really, really great
as a go-to summer outfit.

00:07:57.139 --> 00:08:00.199
Anyway, thank you so much
