00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:19.060
Before I put the 

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:23.249
WonderSwan away, let it be known that the
hamsters have spread from Nintendo�s stable

00:00:23.249 --> 00:00:29.740
of handhelds all the way to Bandai�s under-appreciated...
whatever the heck this thing is. Pain to film

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:34.600
on, in any case. But new friend of the show
Matt in Bedford, Texas not only managed to

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:39.390
hook us up with a copy of Dokodemo Hamster,
but he even made this sweet case for it out

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:44.180
of a DS case. And I have no idea why Miku�s
on the back of this thing, either. She�s

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:48.870
not a hamster, she�s a Vocaloid! Oh, there�s
a hamster with her? Then she�s cool. Point

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:52.390
is, it�s Hamsters on the WonderSwan and
it comes at the perfect time, considering

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:57.800
that Felicity sent us Dokodemo Hamster 2 for
the PS1. Now I can begin at the beginning.

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:04.809
And apparently the beginning means... the
hamster pulls out a writing desk.

00:01:04.809 --> 00:01:12.680
Yes, while Hamster Paradise had minigames,
and Hamtaro had linguistics, and Kisekae Hamster

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:19.100
had crass commercialism, Dokodemo Hamster
has... mail. Your hamster writes you mail.

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:23.932
Your hamster is Very, Very Interested In Your
Personal Habits. Your Hamster Wants To Know

00:01:23.932 --> 00:01:28.399
What TV Show You Watched Last Night. Your
Hamster Is Certainly Not Selling This Information

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:34.329
To Google. Absolutely Not. Put That Thought
Out Of Your Mind. If you feel like contributing

00:01:34.329 --> 00:01:39.810
to this data-minin... erm, RELATIONSHIP more
proactively, you can even teach your hamster

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:45.140
your favorite words! So long as they�re
no longer than 6 mora, and can be easily described

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:51.240
via a series of prompts. Is it a name, or
a thing? Is it usually put in your mouth?

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.670
Upon reflection, this is way too dangerous
a tool in the hands of the wrong people. Fortunately,

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:02.159
by my experience, the wrong people don�t
have WonderSwans.

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:10.410
Anyway. Aside from snail-mail correspondence,
Dokodemo Hamster features... not a lot of

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.010
anything. Your hamster�s just happy enough
to have busted out of his oppressive small-town

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:19.980
hamster existence. He�ll even do tricks,
which might clip off the side of the screen...

00:02:19.980 --> 00:02:24.599
and loop to the other. Oh, and you can poke
him to make him giggle, all Pillsbury-dough-boy

00:02:24.599 --> 00:02:29.430
style. So let�s take a look at the other
thing Matt sent us: 20th Anniversary Kirby

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:37.360
gummy candies! For THREE BUCKS. Let�s open
it up and see what�s inside... two. Two

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:43.870
candies. TWO. And a collectable card, if you�re
the type to repeatedly spend THREE BUCKS on

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:50.400
two candies. I will say this though, the card�s
shiny. All foily and reflectivey, like it�s

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.849
trying to pretend it�s a Pokemon card or
something. Sorry, Kirby Squeak Squad promotional

00:02:54.849 --> 00:03:00.120
object, you are not a Deoxys-EX. The gummies
don�t taste bad, though. Apparently Kirby

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:05.060
is a strawberry marshmallow. See you next
week, when Hamster Thursday will be less reliant

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:06.629
on the postal system!
