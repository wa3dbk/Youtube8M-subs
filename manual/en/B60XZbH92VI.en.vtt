00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.910
Every time when I'm on vacation, and after vacation when I come back

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:21.960
To this stage, the main stage at the Bolshoi Theatre

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:27.290
My feeling is amazing, I was feeling something special, something magical.

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:31.920
It is incredibly enjoyable for me to be on the Bolshoi stage.

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:39.680
There are currently so many interesting productions,

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:45.520
set long before, that are now being revived.

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.850
I've danced almost every ballet in the Bolshoi Theatre

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.940
I was just very lucky, it's how the stars aligned.

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:55.450
I love my profession

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:59.400
It is very hard, it's ungrateful.

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:01.510
But I can say I was fortunate.

00:01:03.371 --> 00:01:09.485
Our entire profession, all our ballets, all our roles, all our performances

00:01:09.628 --> 00:01:11.314
are based on one thing...

00:01:11.514 --> 00:01:12.685
Only love, love alone.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.971
Everything I have, I give to the audience and to the stage

00:01:21.028 --> 00:01:24.142
and if it comes to the point of tears, then it's probably great.

00:01:25.114 --> 00:01:29.857
The stage is my own world, and I can create anything within it

00:01:31.371 --> 00:01:34.914
through myself, through my story,

00:01:35.114 --> 00:01:39.285
and tell the audience what I'm capable of feeling.

00:01:39.514 --> 00:01:40.942
My worries, my thoughts,

00:01:41.257 --> 00:01:45.714
even tragedy or perhaps happier moments, love...

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:47.828
absolutely everything.

00:01:48.057 --> 00:01:50.028
I'm in my third season with Bolshoi Theatre.

00:01:50.457 --> 00:01:54.028
In these three years I've accomplished such a wide variety

00:01:54.857 --> 00:01:59.371
I can't imagine any other company in the world where I could've achieved so much

00:01:59.885 --> 00:02:01.800
in such a short a period of time.

00:02:02.371 --> 00:02:04.114
You come as a recent graduate,

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:06.685
still very much a student

00:02:06.971 --> 00:02:09.314
you need to start building repertoire, everything is unfamiliar

00:02:10.885 --> 00:02:17.342
and yet my repertoire to date is so varied from costumes, styles,

00:02:17.571 --> 00:02:22.657
to contemporary choreographers that work with artists today.

00:02:23.028 --> 00:02:24.285
It's a priceless experience.

00:02:24.542 --> 00:02:28.600
I really love digging and searching for new layers and meanings.

00:02:29.542 --> 00:02:32.685
Even though it's been ten years and you've danced the same role

00:02:34.085 --> 00:02:39.600
thinking you've found everything and worked on it to its full extent

00:02:39.942 --> 00:02:41.914
And yet you still go to the studio

00:02:42.342 --> 00:02:43.571
and you search

00:02:45.371 --> 00:02:50.028
and you're constantly striving, with every performance,

00:02:50.085 --> 00:02:51.514
to achieve something greater.

00:02:52.228 --> 00:02:54.171
And this never allows you to relax.
