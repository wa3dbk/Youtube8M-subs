00:00:01.509 --> 00:00:02.342
- [Interviewer] Carlos.

00:00:02.342 --> 00:00:03.175
- Yeah.

00:00:03.175 --> 00:00:04.614
- [Interviewer] You're out
here homeless in Hollywood.

00:00:04.614 --> 00:00:05.768
How do you survive?

00:00:05.768 --> 00:00:07.351
- How do I survive?

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:10.749
Any way I can.

00:00:10.749 --> 00:00:13.252
You know, there's youth
centers I can go to,

00:00:13.252 --> 00:00:14.976
'cause I haven't aged
out of any of 'em yet.

00:00:14.976 --> 00:00:16.649
Kinda young, you know, only 21.

00:00:16.649 --> 00:00:18.125
And, so, like, I go to
these youth centers,

00:00:18.125 --> 00:00:19.427
and they'll hook me up with resources

00:00:19.427 --> 00:00:20.877
that I didn't know were out here.

00:00:20.877 --> 00:00:22.911
You know, and they let
me do my laundry there

00:00:22.911 --> 00:00:24.494
whenever I need it.

00:00:25.531 --> 00:00:27.411
I have a squat that I stay at here,

00:00:27.411 --> 00:00:29.518
with Ashley and her boyfriend, and stuff.

00:00:29.518 --> 00:00:32.467
And I have three people
that stay with me in total,

00:00:32.467 --> 00:00:34.087
and we have permission by the guy who

00:00:34.087 --> 00:00:36.039
does janitorial work there, to stay there

00:00:36.039 --> 00:00:37.180
throughout the entire night.

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:39.153
It's in a dog park, and
we stay in the bathroom

00:00:39.153 --> 00:00:41.360
outta the rain, outta the weather.

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.923
It's pretty warm in there,
with all of us in there.

00:00:43.923 --> 00:00:46.049
And the only rule is we
have to, like, you know,

00:00:46.049 --> 00:00:47.810
pick up all our blankets, fold 'em up,

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:49.881
and like, we go hide them
in this little wooded area,

00:00:49.881 --> 00:00:51.031
and nobody touches it, you know?

00:00:51.031 --> 00:00:52.164
So, we're pretty safe there.

00:00:52.164 --> 00:00:53.044
(bus loudly passing by)

00:00:53.044 --> 00:00:54.728
And so, that's, you know, my spot to sleep

00:00:54.728 --> 00:00:56.720
for the night, you know?

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:59.559
Only one stop away on the
Red Line in Universal, so.

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:01.623
- [Interviewer] So, why Hollywood?

00:01:01.623 --> 00:01:03.133
- 'Cause there's a lot
more resources out here

00:01:03.133 --> 00:01:05.428
for the youth, than
there are in other places

00:01:05.428 --> 00:01:06.903
that I've seen.

00:01:06.903 --> 00:01:09.424
And I kinda grown to like Hollywood,

00:01:09.424 --> 00:01:11.779
because Hollywood isn't just
people that live in Hollywood,

00:01:11.779 --> 00:01:13.574
it's a buncha tourists too, you know?

00:01:13.574 --> 00:01:15.244
So, you don't feel so different out here,

00:01:15.244 --> 00:01:17.215
'cause all the tourists,
they're all different,

00:01:17.215 --> 00:01:18.286
and they don't know anything about you.

00:01:18.286 --> 00:01:19.681
You see them lookin' around clueless,

00:01:19.681 --> 00:01:21.326
just as I am sometimes.

00:01:21.326 --> 00:01:23.337
- [Interviewer] Everything
fits in Hollywood.

00:01:23.337 --> 00:01:24.170
- Yeah,
- Yeah.

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:26.015
- 'cause you can't (stutters)
be weird in Hollywood,

00:01:26.015 --> 00:01:27.295
'cause it is Hollyweird, ya know?

00:01:27.295 --> 00:01:28.404
- [Interviewer] Yeah,
right, exactly, exactly.

00:01:28.404 --> 00:01:29.471
(Carlos laughing)

00:01:29.471 --> 00:01:31.762
So, what do you do when you
get out of homelessness?

00:01:31.762 --> 00:01:33.821
- I just got done writing my first book,

00:01:33.821 --> 00:01:35.156
and I'm working on my second book,

00:01:35.156 --> 00:01:37.296
and I'm doing a spoken-word CD,

00:01:37.296 --> 00:01:38.709
which I got a demo disc of, you know,

00:01:38.709 --> 00:01:39.987
I got three tracks in there, and I'm doing

00:01:39.987 --> 00:01:41.460
everything I can to get me
hooked up with all kinds

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.591
of resources for writing
programs, and everything.

00:01:44.591 --> 00:01:48.248
And I'm actually just got
qualified for a Student Aid Loans,

00:01:48.248 --> 00:01:49.660
and I wanna become an English Major,

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:51.623
and just master the craft
of writing, 'cause that's

00:01:51.623 --> 00:01:52.899
what I love to do, you know?
- Great, great.

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:53.865
(encroaching siren wails)

00:01:53.865 --> 00:01:55.859
- And so, I figure, if I can go to school,

00:01:55.859 --> 00:01:57.755
there's programs out here
that've already told me

00:01:57.755 --> 00:02:00.913
they'll take me in to a
living program for 18 months,

00:02:00.913 --> 00:02:02.910
and if I stay in school,
and get good grades,

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:05.761
I can live there for as long as I need to.

00:02:05.761 --> 00:02:07.309
- [Interviewer] So what's your book about?

00:02:07.309 --> 00:02:09.506
- It's about things that
happened in my past, you know,

00:02:09.506 --> 00:02:12.017
with family, and loved ones, you know,

00:02:12.017 --> 00:02:14.815
lotta bad stuff, you know.
- What's the title?

00:02:14.815 --> 00:02:17.524
- The title of my first book,
is The Orange Compilation.

00:02:17.524 --> 00:02:20.653
My second book is called A
Life Once Lost, Tears of Blood,

00:02:20.653 --> 00:02:23.227
and that one gets really
deep into my past.

00:02:23.227 --> 00:02:24.586
- [Interviewer] And you
told me some organization

00:02:24.586 --> 00:02:25.889
helped you publish it.

00:02:25.889 --> 00:02:27.578
Some arts organization here.

00:02:27.578 --> 00:02:31.752
- Yeah, it's, well CalArts
students that go to school

00:02:31.752 --> 00:02:35.686
for editing and publishing,
they go to MFP once a week

00:02:35.686 --> 00:02:37.661
to do a writing workshop,
where homeless youth

00:02:37.661 --> 00:02:39.191
can go there, they can write

00:02:39.191 --> 00:02:40.720
about how they feel, journals, whatever.

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:42.233
They even give them writing
prompts to help them

00:02:42.233 --> 00:02:44.023
be better at writing if
they wanna get better.

00:02:44.023 --> 00:02:45.112
They don't force you though, you know,

00:02:45.112 --> 00:02:47.337
it's all free will, free mind.

00:02:47.337 --> 00:02:48.751
You know, whatever you wanna do.

00:02:48.751 --> 00:02:51.304
And they pick out certain people,

00:02:51.304 --> 00:02:53.796
in these writing workshops,
to publish for free,

00:02:53.796 --> 00:02:55.444
anything you want, you know.

00:02:55.444 --> 00:02:57.264
And all they do, is
they edit your writing,

00:02:57.264 --> 00:03:00.132
because it gives the students
real-life work experience,

00:03:00.132 --> 00:03:01.193
to publish your work.

00:03:01.193 --> 00:03:02.866
So they do it for you for free.

00:03:02.866 --> 00:03:06.096
They-- I had 20 copies, but
the center took five for them,

00:03:06.096 --> 00:03:07.781
and then five to hand out
to other organizations

00:03:07.781 --> 00:03:09.184
to show them, it's what they do.

00:03:09.184 --> 00:03:11.802
And so I have ten to myself,
and I've been handing those out

00:03:11.802 --> 00:03:14.007
to very certain, specific people.

00:03:14.007 --> 00:03:16.572
So, like, to, you know, like,
bigger, more famous people,

00:03:16.572 --> 00:03:18.371
so that, you know, if they
show it off, you know,

00:03:18.371 --> 00:03:19.332
people will start
- Yeah.

00:03:19.332 --> 00:03:20.559
- to recognize my name, somehow.

00:03:20.559 --> 00:03:21.433
- [Interviewer] Right, great.

00:03:21.433 --> 00:03:22.638
- You know, so.

00:03:22.638 --> 00:03:27.523
- [Interviewer] If you had three
wishes, what would they be?

00:03:27.523 --> 00:03:30.351
- I guess if I had three
wishes, the first one would be,

00:03:30.351 --> 00:03:32.486
you know, just to see my
daughter again, you know,

00:03:32.486 --> 00:03:34.004
just that le-- and if I couldn't see her,

00:03:34.004 --> 00:03:35.577
then at least make it to her funeral,

00:03:35.577 --> 00:03:37.736
without havin' to worry about
gettin' killed, you know?

00:03:37.736 --> 00:03:39.519
My second wish would be able to, you know,

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:42.856
have Sarah back in my life,
'cause, like, when I had her,

00:03:42.856 --> 00:03:45.455
I was sober, and all that
stuff, and I would do anything

00:03:45.455 --> 00:03:47.222
just to be a better man.

00:03:47.222 --> 00:03:50.305
My third wish, I guess, would be to..

00:03:51.705 --> 00:03:54.811
to, if I ever had the chance
to do this experience again,

00:03:54.811 --> 00:03:56.080
because this experience of bein' homeless

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:58.173
really does change you as a person.

00:03:58.173 --> 00:03:59.251
It can either make you, or break you,

00:03:59.251 --> 00:04:01.669
and right now, it's
makin' me what I am, so.

00:04:01.669 --> 00:04:02.906
- [Interviewer] That's great.

00:04:02.906 --> 00:04:04.508
Thank you very much for talkin' to us.

00:04:04.508 --> 00:04:05.615
- No problem, sir.

00:04:05.615 --> 00:04:09.782
(traffic passing, people
shouting in the distance)
