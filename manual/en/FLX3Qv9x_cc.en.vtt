This instructional video will show you how to install or replace a shower pump.

00:00:05.934 --> 00:00:10.104
For the purposes of this video we are installing a Grundfos Niagra 1.5 bar

00:00:10.104 --> 00:00:14.064
shower pump. The 1.5 bar relates to the pressure output delivered by the pump.

00:00:14.064 --> 00:00:18.504
When you receive a pump they often come with flexible hoses supplied. This makes the

00:00:18.504 --> 00:00:22.784
installation much easier. These are rubber washers to use in water connection.

00:00:22.784 --> 00:00:26.574
They're very important so don't lose them. If we look closely we can see the

00:00:26.574 --> 00:00:29.375
water supply inlet and the rubber feet. These disperse

00:00:29.375 --> 00:00:33.345
any vibration caused by the pump in operation. On the outlet of the pump there are two

00:00:33.345 --> 00:00:35.155
pressure sensors. When the

00:00:35.155 --> 00:00:38.735
pressure drops due to a shower being opened the sensors activate the pump.

00:00:38.735 --> 00:00:42.945
Before doing any work on a shower pump ensure it is electrically isolated by switching it

00:00:42.945 --> 00:00:47.105
off and pulling the fuse. Remove the electrical box cover and remove the wires

00:00:47.105 --> 00:00:54.105
once you have ensured they are not live by using a volt meter.

00:01:00.005 --> 00:01:03.215
Turn off the hot and cold water supply to the pump.

00:01:03.215 --> 00:01:06.585
Remove the pump water connections, making a note of which ones are the inlet and

00:01:06.585 --> 00:01:12.695
the outlet.

00:01:12.695 --> 00:01:16.525
Sometimes water is still in the pipes so have a bucket or towel handy to catch any drips.

00:01:16.525 --> 00:01:18.405
 

00:01:18.405 --> 00:01:21.785
Remove the old pump.

00:01:21.785 --> 00:01:25.255
Fortunately the new pump is the same model so no major alteration in

00:01:25.255 --> 00:01:27.295
pipework is required.

00:01:27.295 --> 00:01:31.015
Use the rubber washer supplied to make a watertight seal. Ensure the washer with the gauze filter

00:01:31.015 --> 00:01:33.055
is on the inlet.

00:01:33.055 --> 00:01:36.295
This protects the pump from any debris in the water.

00:01:36.295 --> 00:01:43.295
Tighten all joints right up and turn on the water supply. Check for leaks.

00:01:46.135 --> 00:01:48.695
Now remove the electrical cover of the new pump.

00:01:48.695 --> 00:01:52.545
Thread your wire through the nut, rubber washer and cover before connecting the wires.

00:01:52.545 --> 00:01:54.355
 

00:01:54.355 --> 00:01:57.175
Identify which wires go in which terminal and using a small

00:01:57.175 --> 00:01:59.074
slotted screwdriver

00:01:59.074 --> 00:02:00.894
tighten them in place.

00:02:00.894 --> 00:02:03.005
Now replace your electrical cover.

00:02:03.005 --> 00:02:06.005
It's often a good time to try and purge your system of air before running the pump.

00:02:06.005 --> 00:02:07.304
 

00:02:07.304 --> 00:02:09.685
Do this by opening your shower valve.

00:02:09.685 --> 00:02:15.084
Turn on the electrics and test pump operation by using the shower.
