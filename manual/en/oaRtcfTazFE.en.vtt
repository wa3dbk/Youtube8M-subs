00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:21.920
I'm the witch who protects your sweet dreams

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.720
Trust in me, I just want to see my loved world in harmony

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:35.940
All began like any other day

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:37.940
Everything in a normal way

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:39.960
Hear the waves, it's the sound from the sea

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:41.800
Bringing calm when I see it

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.000
I wish knew about the destiny

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.100
Gaze at fate with clarity

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:47.960
A heartbeat, an inkling of something,

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.060
Suddenly commences to invade a strange feeling

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:55.580
What can be? I don't know

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:01.340
It's like a picture of a fate

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.280
But all turned red

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.860
Red will make you happy, don't you see?

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.920
It's incredible how gullible you are

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.740
Just open your eyes

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:29.520
It's a vision from an uncertain existence

00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:35.920
Submerged in a crimson sea. The hopes rest

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:37.760
Don't surrender

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:39.540
I'll show them the strength of my heart

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:41.860
How my yearning never falls

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.780
I will raise my magic power

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:45.760
I will protect everyone

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:49.800
I'm the witch who protects your sweet dreams

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:53.880
Trust me, I just want to see my loved world in harmony

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:12.020
In a blink, many things never seen

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:14.040
That appear in front of me

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:15.780
Can't believe, make damage is the aim

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:17.980
I wish it was just a game

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:19.960
In seconds the heartless intentions

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:21.880
Leaving all the reflections

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:23.960
In my way I met wickedness

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.200
And this mind got dominated completely by fears

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:32.740
Why am I so weak?

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.180
I feel powerless, this depresses

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.060
It's a sad problem

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:48.280
You are really easy to trick

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.340
You're a powerless witch

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:57.620
Just open your eyes

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:05.760
Darkness conceals all the sentiments, all the blames

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:11.900
The sadness from all my friends, I don't want more

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:13.500
It must be stopped

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:15.640
I'll show the strength of my heart

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:17.980
How my yearning never falls

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:19.960
I will raise my magic power

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:21.800
I will protect everyone

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:25.580
I'm the witch who protects your sweet dreams

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:29.780
Trust in me, I just want to see my loved world in harmony
