00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:04.780
...

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:17.880
We’re looking at Rock And Roll Ain’t Noise
Pollution – the first guitar you here on

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:23.680
that track is what we’re learning today
and it uses major 3rd and minor 3rd intervals.

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:29.260
For more on those intervals, check out Guitar
Practiced Perfectly software.

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:36.760
The 1st interval is the open B string with
the 1st finger placed on fret 1 of the G string

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:37.760
...

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:45.809
I’m finger picking this intro, so I’m
holding my plectrum inside my hand so when

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:55.160
I need it, I can grab it really easily. I’m
using my 1st and 2nd finger to sit on those

00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:02.920
2 strings and then when I want to make the
sound I gently pull upwards. You want to avoid

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:07.130
a really harsh sound ... unless that’s what
you’re after ...

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:13.950
That’s the 1st interval ...

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:19.799
Then we change to the 2nd fret of both strings
...

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.659
Then on the 2nd string we’re on fret 3 ...

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:28.270
And on the 3rd string we’re on fret 4 ...

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:33.810
Back to the 2nd fret on both strings, but
this time we’re going to include the A string

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:43.119
with it, so you can see my thumb’s on the
A string ...

00:01:43.119 --> 00:01:46.080
Back to the 3rd and 4th fret of the B &amp; D
strings ...

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:56.390
Then I’m reaching over with my 1st finger
to grab the low E string at fret 3, bending

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:58.390
it slightly sharp so it sounds bluesy ...

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:06.080
Then I’m playing an E 5 power chord open
low string ...

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.550
2nd fret of the A ...

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:14.120
And 2nd fret of the D ...

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.330
Then we play through all of that again ...

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:25.560
Finish short, back to the low E string ...

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:30.580
Then that note again ...

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:37.270
Finish on the E5 chord then play that E5 chord
an octave higher, 7 on the A string, 9 on

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:40.430
the D, slide down ...

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:47.530
