Now of course, when we look at Pollock paintings,

00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:13.133
they’re familiar and they’re accepted.

00:00:13.133 --> 00:00:15.467
At the time that they were made,

00:00:15.467 --> 00:00:17.433
they were an affront; they were downright shocking,

00:00:17.433 --> 00:00:20.000
because they were an attack on painting itself.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.767
To make this work, Pollock placed the canvas on the floor and

00:00:23.767 --> 00:00:26.367
spattered and dripped the paint, making a painting which is

00:00:26.367 --> 00:00:30.266
about the substance of paint itself, the fact that paint is liquid.

00:00:30.266 --> 00:00:31.767
And when we see

00:00:31.767 --> 00:00:33.166
paint on canvas, normally

00:00:33.166 --> 00:00:34.367
that’s hidden.

00:00:34.367 --> 00:00:35.100
You know paint is made to resemble

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:36.334
something else,

00:00:36.334 --> 00:00:37.367
whether it’s the sky,

00:00:37.367 --> 00:00:39.467
or a field or flesh.

00:00:39.467 --> 00:00:45.000
But what Pollock does is just present us with paint as paint. He was the first person to do this. Many people have tried to

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.166
copy Pollock. None of them have the

00:00:48.166 --> 00:00:50.634
energy, the spontaneity

00:00:50.634 --> 00:00:54.533
and the sheer skill in handling paint that he has.

00:00:54.533 --> 00:00:59.100
From afar you read the painting as being different shades of gray, fairly restrained, but when you get up

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:02.400
close, other colors jump out at you, so to begin with

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:07.767
it appears as if Pollock spatters matte black paint which seeps into the bare canvas.

00:01:07.767 --> 00:01:11.533
And then on top, he’s layering this riot of colors: silver, cream, pink,

00:01:11.533 --> 00:01:13.634
gray, touches of green, turquoise and

00:01:13.634 --> 00:01:16.334
yellow. You think of it as being a flat

00:01:16.334 --> 00:01:19.667
image, but it’s this very, very built up,

00:01:19.667 --> 00:01:21.533
knotted, clotted

00:01:21.533 --> 00:01:24.100
surface. Sometimes the

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.900
lines are quite

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.934
thin and fine. At points

00:01:29.934 --> 00:01:33.266
the paint pools, and starts to clot and

00:01:33.266 --> 00:01:35.934
is even smeared. Some paint is fluid, other

00:01:35.934 --> 00:01:39.367
paint is shiny and forms impasto on the surface,

00:01:39.367 --> 00:01:43.100
so the painting is quite textured.

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.600
The paintings are all incredibly human in the sense they’re scaled to the reach of

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.333
Pollock’s arm, so each of those lines

00:01:49.333 --> 00:01:53.634
is recording the gesture of his hand as it moves

00:01:53.634 --> 00:01:57.800
over the canvas. So even though the work is now sixty or more years old, you’re

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:01.266
aware of the moment in which it’s made. So in a sense,

00:02:01.266 --> 00:02:06.667
Pollock, the artist, is present here with you as you’re looking at the painting. This painting is incredibly

00:02:06.667 --> 00:02:14.567
honest; Pollock isn’t trying to fool us in any way. However, our brains can’t resist trying to read perspectival depth.

00:02:14.567 --> 00:02:18.967
They draw you into this forest or thicket of lines and paint.

00:02:18.967 --> 00:02:23.667
You could characterize them as landscapes of just paint itself.

00:02:23.667 --> 00:02:26.734
No matter what your background is, what your understanding is of twentieth-century art,

00:02:26.734 --> 00:02:29.133
of any art, there’s

00:02:29.133 --> 00:02:31.600
no requirements, there’s no iconography. They’re

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:34.734
open to everyone. The immediacy with which it was painted

00:02:34.734 --> 00:02:37.300
is also the immediacy with which we can encounter the

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:40.700
work and understand it.
