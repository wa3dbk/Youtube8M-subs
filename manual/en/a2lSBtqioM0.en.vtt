00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.950
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.140
JAY LENO: It's the final track
day at the Shell Eco-marathon.

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.470
And there are only a few hours
left to get on the course

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:22.910
and show off all the hard work.

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:25.880
NICOLAS: 3,000's mpg will be great.

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:27.300
JAY LENO: Universite
of Laval have

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.080
had several impressive
runs, each averaging well

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:32.540
over 2,000 miles per gallon.

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:34.590
BRUNO: This year,
we want to beat our score

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:35.590
from two years ago.

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:37.570
JUDGE: How much
fuel did you use?

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:39.060
NICOLAS: I think about 10.2.

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:41.040
JUDGE: You had 10.7 milliliters.

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.210
So that's 2,271
miles per gallon.

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:46.360
ETIENNE: Thank you.

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:48.610
TEAM MEMBER: We know that
the car can do a lot better.

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.260
ETIENNE: The goal is always
to get close to our own record

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:57.560
and pushing the bar higher.

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.900
JUDGE: 3,365.

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:07.620
Good job.

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:09.370
JAY LENO: Believe me,
that won't keep them

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:11.480
from pushing for even
more impressive numbers.

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:17.460
ETIENNE: We are so near to beat
our previous record.

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:19.880
JAY LENO: Meanwhile,
the underdogs

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.600
from Dudley High
School, well, they've

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.310
hit some more speed bumps.

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:24.120
JETSUN: For
about two minutes,

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:25.180
the car kept on stalling.

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:26.660
JEREMY: Wow, it keeps stalling.

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:27.870
JETSUN: Wait, what happened?

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:28.450
JEREMY: I don't know.

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:31.870
It stalled out, and then
he got it started again.

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:33.510
We just want a valid
run at this point.

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:38.480
JETSUN: He's exceeded, but
he's just 26 seconds slow.

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:39.100
Half a bottle.

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:39.600
Whoo!

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.070
JUDGE: It's an invalid run.

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.060
JEREMY: Over time?

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.040
It's 25.46.

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:44.020
Oh, OK.

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:45.330
Max is 25.

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:46.210
All right.

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:47.040
Tire was off.

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:47.540
I'm sorry.

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:49.830
JETSUN: They refused
to check the fuel because we

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:51.330
didn't meet the time limit.

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:53.320
Our fourth run, we lost
communication with him

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:54.320
with the walkie-talkies.

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:57.500
For a while, I'd have to yell at
him, telling him instructions.

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:58.320
All right.

00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.860
I'm going to go head
back to the pit.

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:01.190
You be ready for him, all right?

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:02.690
JEREMY: OK, yeah.

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:04.420
JETSUN: We thought we
did worse for fuel,

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:06.090
but we actually turned
out to do better.

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:07.590
We actually got a record of--

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:09.090
JUDGE: 237.39

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.000
CAMIN: 237.39.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:11.820
Better.

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:14.330
JETSUN: Which isn't really incredible
for our Shell Eco-marathon

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:14.830
standards.

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:17.170
But for us, it was fantastic.

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:19.660
JAY LENO: After overcoming a
mountain of mechanical issues,

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:21.680
the returning
hopefuls have finally

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.650
taken their first official lap.

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:25.610
JESSICA: We worked all
night working on the car

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:27.560
so that we could go first
thing in the morning.

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:29.400
The car was solid
all night long.

00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:31.350
And we go in to the track today.

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:33.670
And the first lap was amazing.

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:34.670
And then our nose falls.

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:37.770
It was so disappointing.

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:40.420
And we're like, oh my God, this
could've been it, you know?

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.420
But then we're like,
OK, well, it's OK.

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:47.030
So we go back into the line.

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:48.740
And we're so ready to start.

00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:52.190
And we go on and
again, an engine issue.

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:53.940
And my heart sank.

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:57.260
I cried bitterly.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:02:59.540
ALVARO: They didn't even
get to lap three this time.

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:00.750
I don't know, you know?

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:06.740
It's disappointing.

00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:09.370
Something like that stops
you from completing a run yet

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:09.870
again.

00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:11.850
It's just really,
really heartbreaking.

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:20.930
JAY LENO: Will the defending
champs' previous high score

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:23.570
be enough for them to win?

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:26.630
You'll find out in
the next episode.
