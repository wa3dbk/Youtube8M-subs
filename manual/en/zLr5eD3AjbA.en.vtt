Hi, I’m Josh Ellsworth with Stahls’ CAD-CUT®
Direct. A big trend we’re noticing out there

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:16.420
in the industry is the trending of neon fabrics
for decoration and also Heathered fabrics

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:21.180
in stylish t-shirts. This spring and summer
you need to start decorating these types of

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.810
fabrics and we have a great product to decorate
them with. That’s CAD-CUT® Glitter Flake™

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:31.330
in the new colors Hologram Silver and Hologram
Gold. Let me show you some completed looks.

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:37.510
First we’ll show you the Hologram Silver
on this neon pink performance shirt. I really

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:43.550
like the look of Hologram Silver on neon fabrics
and I think your customers will too. As with

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:47.390
all Glitter Flake™ materials, we just heat
press it, a single step application, peel

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:56.420
it warm, and we have a completed result guaranteed
to last. Let’s do a sorority shirt on this

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:07.920
neon green tee. The Hologram Silver and Gold
both have that extra rainbow-like effect which

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.230
makes them stand out over the basic silver
and gold and often girls prefer that. You

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:17.090
should also note that the flake is a little
finer and a little smaller particle size in

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.770
these two colors but it still has plenty of
bling and sparkle.

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:25.700
Here we’ll apply this zip-up hoodie in neon
orange. This product is perfect for dance

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:46.929
apparel as well. One more idea on how you
might show this product to a business. Here

00:01:46.929 --> 00:02:01.219
we’re decorating a shirt for the Island
bar and grill restaurant. Let’s move over

00:02:01.219 --> 00:02:06.109
to the Hologram Gold and show you a couple
looks there. We’re pressing on a Heathered

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:11.800
shirt. All of these garments are from SanMar
and the Hologram Gold really looks great on

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:30.989
these Heathered shades. A couple design concepts
for the Glitter Flake™ are doing girlfriend

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:44.519
or mom t-shirts. There are increasing popular
as well. So whether for dance, cheer, retail,

00:02:44.519 --> 00:02:50.040
or Greek apparel, there are plenty of opportunities
for these new t-shirts types and new materials.

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:55.340
