00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Streaks when copying through the automatic document feeder--the ADF.

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:16.000
Lines or streaks appear on copies or scans made through the automatic document feeder.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:24.000
When using the automatic document feeder for copies or scans, streaks or lines appear on the copies.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:46.000
The streaks appear on the copy from the bottom to the top of the page.

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:53.700
This area is used when documents are copied on the flatbed glass.

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:58.800
This area is used when a document is copied through the ADF.

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:02.300
As the original passes across the bottom of the document feeder,

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:08.000
it is scanned by optics located here below the ADF glass.

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:20.000
The original is fed down through the ADF, passes across the ADF glass, then moves back into the ADF.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.500
HP data indicates that greater than 99% of the time if you have a streak

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:30.000
when copying through the ADF, it is caused by debris on the ADF glass.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:47.500
Debris can be caused by: paper dust, markers, white-out correction fluid or tape, adhesive from Post-It notes or flags.

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:54.300
Clean the ADF glass with a soft lint-free cloth moistened with glass cleaner.

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:58.800
Spray only onto the cloth and not directly onto the glass or device.

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:06.500
Wipe the glass again with a dry portion of the cloth to remove any residue or smudges.

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:16.200
The following are recommended for cleaning: glass cleaner, lens cleaner, soft lint-free cloth, or microfiber cloth.

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:22.000
Make another copy. If the streaks still appear on your output, follow these steps:

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000
Place a blank sheet of paper in the ADF.

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.000
Draw and "X" on the paper as shown.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
Make a copy of the test page.

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:54.000
Open the ADF. Place the copy face-up on the flatbed glass with the "X" located as shown.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:00.000
Be sure the upper left corner of the copy is aligned with the upper left corner of the flatbed.

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:06.500
The line or streak will point to the area on the glass where the debris is located.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.000
Use your fingernail to loosen debris that might be stuck on the glass.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:20.900
Use only your fingernail. Other sharp objects might scratch the ADF glass.

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:29.000
After loosening the debris, clean the glass and then wipe the entire area to remove residue or smudges.

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.000
Now, make another copy to verify the streaks are gone.

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:52.000
Cleaning the ADF glass periodically will help prevent streaks and ensure great copy quality.

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:59.000
Do not use abrasives, acetone, benzene, ammonia, ethyl alcohol,

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.800
or carbon tetrachloride on any part of the product. These can damage the product.
