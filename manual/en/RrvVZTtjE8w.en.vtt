weapons trafficking okay

00:00:14.739 --> 00:00:18.470

i would not miss the fact that it was

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:18.859
the

have been

00:00:24.399 --> 00:00:29.079
anyway um... so it turns out that he was
interested

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:31.280
can we do sensational jr right now

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:35.140

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:41.129
kinsey ology

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:42.800
as i pronounce it

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:43.790
macedonian

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:48.000
both offices in assisting the does
present buster and yet is is a sense is

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:48.950
that professor

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:52.430
cell and let you see about seventy
thousand dollars a year had cast a

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:53.689
center did you know

00:00:53.689 --> 00:00:56.759
uh... and the president of the
university's very shocked and surprised

00:00:56.759 --> 00:01:01.889
about this when police raided his home
they found some meth amphetamines so

00:01:01.889 --> 00:01:05.359
they believed they believe that he
wasn't selling meth amphetamines

00:01:05.359 --> 00:01:09.520
but he was distributing it she drug
dealers so they can sell it to feed a

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:13.909
uh... about the weapons trafficking it
turns out that uh... if he had a large

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:17.560
amount of weapons but the details on
that at this point are very sketchy so

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:20.929
we don't know exactly how many weapons
he had what he was doing with the

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:23.810
weapons that he harm anyone with the
weapons we don't know that yet they're

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:28.310
still investigating uh... but it's just
fascinating because

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:30.640
it turns out that in uh...

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:32.550
the biker club culture

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:36.080
a lot of them have like completely
normal day jobs in fact a lot of them

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:40.200
work as professors but then that night
you know they have this is the double

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.680
life whereas their trafficking narcotics
as a personally don't have a problem

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:49.290
with um... and you know right about his
house and a third of the extracurricular

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.460
activity it's actually pretty good idea
obviously the more life would be an

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:54.980
assistant professor

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:56.810
an outcast in central europe

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.680
they decided to go into the things that
are llamas today maybe not much or give

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:03.920
me some money but like i said you have
the tightest if there is the drug

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:09.070
dealers or danger of being on top of it
that-that's julie their life been

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:11.279
intimated that there was a from saying

00:02:11.279 --> 00:02:14.509
bindings then coming up on saturday and
sunday

00:02:14.509 --> 00:02:17.699
if you can ride but on the letter

00:02:17.699 --> 00:02:22.269
anniversary there were in shirts and
ties yeah they were in a sense

00:02:22.269 --> 00:02:25.810
today and this is it is the big is a
huge subculture melanoma

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:28.829
absolutely out west and i'd love to do
more research is about

00:02:28.829 --> 00:02:32.340
uh... by the way of don't number one
thing that annoys me the most on the

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:36.469
road are motorcycle riders for the
country traffic number one big winner

00:02:36.469 --> 00:02:39.620
daily because they make you nervous to
these so called too because you wish you

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.540
could get the trafficking nl okay first
of all i do wish i could get through

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.599
traffic but that doesn't know anything
about that at all

00:02:44.599 --> 00:02:48.439
what annoys me is when they do cut you
off and we need to really risky

00:02:48.439 --> 00:02:51.800
maneuvers and you're worried that you're
getting hit them or kill them

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:55.340
the worst thing the worst nothing
analyzing when this is when someone

00:02:55.340 --> 00:03:01.540
possibly lee in front of me looked into
i'm not impressed by your really okay

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:06.139
this is what your car down drive safe
don't cut me off because i would

00:03:06.139 --> 00:03:07.209
aggressive driver

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:10.979
so if you cut me off last minute to
announce i could possibly chile i'm more

00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:13.889
annoyed by people who have been briefed
on the freeway than people who probably

00:03:13.889 --> 00:03:16.269
is going to happen to try something else

00:03:16.269 --> 00:03:18.689
he looks like that vivid for life

00:03:18.689 --> 00:03:21.709
four five blocks from israel's that i'll
be by the way

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:23.380
another dentist then

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:27.469
i'm impressed by your really as bad as
you're not settling the you should do it

00:03:27.469 --> 00:03:33.219

00:03:33.219 --> 00:03:35.049
heads and rather this is not easy

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:37.099

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:41.319
finance an easy this danger is intended
as well as anybody get almost will end

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:42.749

00:03:49.609 --> 00:03:52.209
but you know so whatever differences
they laid off

00:03:52.209 --> 00:03:54.239
this guy who brought in from the space

00:03:54.239 --> 00:03:55.249
anything

00:03:55.249 --> 00:03:58.189
people of my cooking was a salah
slowdown

00:03:58.189 --> 00:04:02.249
begins the space of the crash of our
lord lie within a month or so

00:04:02.249 --> 00:04:06.429
work at a time is the one issue and tell
insults and really don't that scares me

00:04:06.429 --> 00:04:08.359
to death and all the time

00:04:08.359 --> 00:04:12.429
yeah soulmate we don't do it under your
enemies that with the moving in a

00:04:12.429 --> 00:04:15.359
isn't getting out nothing's gonna change
another thing that annoys me

00:04:15.359 --> 00:04:17.340
you can't deny that this is an annoying

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:20.600
when they pull up right next to you know
and then they tore

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:24.060

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:34.809
but when you seem coming up

00:04:34.809 --> 00:04:39.559
