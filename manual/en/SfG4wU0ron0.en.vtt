00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:18.695
Let's start with the basic black mascara and how I apply it

00:00:18.695 --> 00:00:22.383
Firstly, I brush out my lashes using a lash comb

00:00:22.383 --> 00:00:26.764
I do this because my lashes are often 
 stuck together after using Lash serum or

00:00:26.764 --> 00:00:32.384
because of  fallouts from eyeshadows or I've drawn 
 my eye liner on top of my lashes

00:00:32.384 --> 00:00:36.706
So I comb out my lashes to separate them

00:00:36.706 --> 00:00:39.562
Next I curl my lashes using a lash curler

00:00:39.562 --> 00:00:43.697
I break down the process into 3 to make the curl natural looking

00:00:43.697 --> 00:00:46.864
I repeat the same process on my bottom lashes

00:00:46.864 --> 00:00:52.539
And today, I will be using Rimmel's Great Curl Mascara

00:00:54.141 --> 00:00:57.079
Firstly, apply the mascara near the roots of your lashes

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:04.792
Your lashes don't look too overdone even if you apply a lot of mascara 
 to the base and it gives the illusion that you've lined your eyes

00:01:05.116 --> 00:01:10.046
You can also apply generous amounts of mascara 
 if you use the tip of the wand

00:01:10.712 --> 00:01:14.768
Next apply the mascara from the top of your lashes starting at 
 the base going towards the tip. By doing so,

00:01:14.768 --> 00:01:23.353
it will create nice bundles of lashes leading to separate lashes so start 
 from the base towards the tip then, apply mascara as usual

00:01:24.022 --> 00:01:31.614
by slightly patting the wand when applying it won't 
 create clumps and the results will look great

00:01:31.614 --> 00:01:38.967
Also, do not worry if you get mascara on your lids, 
 you can easily remove it later with a Q-tip

00:01:38.967 --> 00:01:41.940
I repeat the same process for my bottom lashes.

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:49.740
Some people may find it easier to use the wand vertically 
 so I recommended applying mascara according to your eye shape

00:01:52.384 --> 00:01:56.260
After applying mascara, I remove any mistakes with a Q-tip

00:01:56.255 --> 00:02:01.680
Depending on what sort of make up I wear I 
 change how many coats of mascara I wear

00:02:01.681 --> 00:02:05.030
But today, I only have one coat of mascara

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:09.980
This completes how I normally apply mascara

00:02:18.856 --> 00:02:27.560
Next, as a variation I would like to show you this brown 
 mascara. It is also Rimmel's Great Curl Mascara in 002

00:02:28.119 --> 00:02:32.860
I apply it using the same method as earlier

00:02:32.856 --> 00:02:38.190
By using a brown mascara, it will make your 
 eyes look very natural and soft

00:02:38.189 --> 00:02:42.370
I recommend this to anyone who thinks black is a little harsh

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:47.070
This completes the brown mascara look

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:51.020
Finally, I would like to introduce this Volume Black Look

00:02:51.025 --> 00:02:57.270
You can add volume by applying mascara several times but 
 today, I will be using a mascara base instead

00:02:57.268 --> 00:03:02.100
By using a mascara base, it makes the process a 
 lot faster and the results look better so

00:03:02.101 --> 00:03:08.660
to anyone who wish to excentuate their lashes, I 
 recommend using a mascara base first

00:03:11.225 --> 00:03:17.620
This completes, my volume black mascara look

00:03:17.617 --> 00:03:22.470
How was it? I hope I was helpful to you in some way

00:03:22.466 --> 00:03:24.970
If you have any style that you like, please let me know!

00:03:24.967 --> 00:03:29.000
Thank you for watching till the end, see you in my next video!

00:03:29.004 --> 00:03:31.950
Bye!
