00:00:04.240 --> 00:00:05.240
Hi, everyone.

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:06.309
I'm Alejandra from Alejandra.TV.

00:00:06.309 --> 00:00:10.260
And in this video, I'm going to show you how
to organize your tools and your hardware inside

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:11.260
your garage.

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:14.250
But first, if you're looking to get organized,
you can check out my free organizing video

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:16.080
series on my website, Alejandra.TV.

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:17.230
The link is below.

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:18.230
OK.

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:21.890
So when it comes to organizing the tools in
the garage, a lot of people just kind of throw

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:23.460
things inside the garage.

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:24.460
There's no real system.

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:27.730
And when you need something, you're having
a hard time finding what you're looking for

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:31.530
and it's really cold or really hot so you
get frustrated and maybe you get stressed,

00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:32.910
maybe you never find it.

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.470
But I'm going to show you what I do to kind
of contain the clutter and show you what works

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:37.470
for us.

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:38.470
OK.

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:40.610
So this is the shed where we have all of our
tools and hardware and stuff.

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:43.540
And we actually got this for free and kind
of cleaned it up.

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:44.989
And now, it's good as new.

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:47.710
It looks like it's like barely even used.

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:52.409
But I'll show you inside in a second but at
the very top of the closet, I have a -- or

00:00:52.409 --> 00:00:58.030
not the closet but shed, there's a bin for
all of our paint cans and stuff.

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:02.950
And I use a bright yellow thick jumbo label
to kind of pop out or have the labels pop

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:05.780
in here because it's kind of dark in the garage
and the yellow pops.

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.740
And when I think of yellow, I use it for like
hardware and power and electrical and stuff.

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:12.079
So that's why it's yellow.

00:01:12.079 --> 00:01:16.909
But let me show you a cool -- this cool label
that I recently came across.

00:01:16.909 --> 00:01:21.140
It's for paint cans.

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.109
It's a label that you put on top of the can
and it comes in different sizes.

00:01:24.109 --> 00:01:29.180
And you label the area in the room where the
paint was used, the color, the finish and

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:33.310
the base, the brand where you got it, the
store, the date and then other and then you

00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:34.579
put a little sample right here.

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:39.840
What I like about this is like obviously this
blue color, if this was in the bathroom, you

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.549
would know that this blue is in the bathroom.

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:46.799
But like this label comes in handy when you're
labelling all the whites and beiges and stuff

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:49.369
that goes on like the trims or the baseboards.

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:53.060
And often, it's confusing to do touch up like
paintwork and stuff.

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.250
So this label is awesome for that.

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:56.250
OK.

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.960
So that's what I do for the paint cans.

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:05.220
And then inside the shed, let me show you
what's inside here.

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:10.509
The top shelf over here, I use shoeboxes to
kind of categorize all the different categories.

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:15.870
So there are old rags, there are adhesives,
there's hardware, not like small hardware

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:18.940
but like everything but nails, and screws
and stuff.

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:23.820
There are light bulbs which I showed how to
make this in my light bulb video.

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:31.640
There is tape, there are paint brushes, there
are the bigger light bulbs, there's all of

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.320
my drill bits for drilling.

00:02:34.320 --> 00:02:42.580
And then let me just show you these light
bulbs.

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:46.220
I did a light bulb video on this recently
and showed you how to make this.

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:51.570
I'll put the link below to where you can find
it.

00:02:51.570 --> 00:03:00.700
And then all of my hardware like nails and
screws is contained in this tackle box that's

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.410
really organized.

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:06.100
So if you have a system in place for all the
nails and screws, it's easy to maintain.

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:09.570
Like if you don't have a system and you're
just like throwing it in one big pile, when

00:03:09.570 --> 00:03:14.290
you're looking for a specific size screw,
it's hard to find and you end up buying another

00:03:14.290 --> 00:03:16.090
one because you can't find what you're looking
for.

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:21.460
So just taking time to sort it all into a
tackle box, it's kind of painful at front.

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:25.150
But it's worth it when you're looking for
that item down the road.

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:26.150
All right.

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:32.930
And all of the anchors are inside of this
tackle box right here.

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:37.230
And there are links on my website to all the
products that I'm showing inside this video.

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:39.170
All right.

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:43.970
Then the Dremel and then the Dremel kit kind
of hangs out in the side up here.

00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:45.370
All right.

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:51.560
Then here, I have a toolbox.

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:59.240
It's really heavy but it basically has all
the tools that we -- like if we need to fix

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:03.900
something inside the house, basically, we
just bring this inside if we're hanging something

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:04.900
or fixing something.

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:11.510
It has a screw driver, the measuring tape,
the hammer, the mallets, everything else but

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:13.150
I don't know the names of.

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:14.620
All right.

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:22.860
And then on this side, I just reuse old containers
that I got from Target like ten years ago

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:26.440
to put like our drill.

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:30.639
I feel like before, we can never find the
drill when we needed it.

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:35.460
So I just put it inside its own bin in here
and then there's working gloves and then there's

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:38.919
rope over here.

00:04:38.919 --> 00:04:40.520
OK.

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:45.100
So one of the problems I was having is like
recently, we've been like changing our furniture

00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:49.189
and stuff and all of the furniture that we
buy seems to come with this extra pieces in

00:04:49.189 --> 00:04:53.319
case we needed to fix something or mount it
differently and I start to think, "OK, where

00:04:53.319 --> 00:04:57.100
do I put all these random parts and pieces
that I don't need right now but might need

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:58.100
years down the road?"

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:04.979
So what I've done is grabbed all the pieces,
just grabbed a jumbo Ziploc bag just like

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:13.759
this and I put all of the pieces inside here
and then I just took painter's tape on the

00:05:13.759 --> 00:05:21.040
back and I just labelled like here is my craft
organizer then here is my office bookcase,

00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:22.040
just like that.

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:26.580
And so, when the time comes when I need these
pieces, I'll just come here and I'll just

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:29.610
come to this bag and I'll find exactly what
I'm looking for.

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:35.039
So it's nice, easy, it will never get lost,
and it's super organized.

00:05:35.039 --> 00:05:40.020
And so, when this bag like we don't -- well,
when we get more furniture, this bag might

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:44.040
fill up and stuff but right now, the system
works for like small amounts of pieces.

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:45.180
OK.

00:05:45.180 --> 00:05:47.370
So that's the top part of the shed.

00:05:47.370 --> 00:05:48.789
Let me show you what's in the bottom part.

00:05:48.789 --> 00:05:49.789
OK.

00:05:49.789 --> 00:05:51.500
So here is the bottom part.

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:52.770
All right.

00:05:52.770 --> 00:06:02.289
So basically what I've done here is grabbed
these circular bins from the Dollar Store.

00:06:02.289 --> 00:06:06.199
They're nice and they're not that sturdy but
like they're good enough.

00:06:06.199 --> 00:06:09.499
And I just put all the round ones containers
inside this round organizer.

00:06:09.499 --> 00:06:10.840
They fit really nicely.

00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:15.749
It's just like spray paint, there's spray
adhesive, there's -- I don't know, just like

00:06:15.749 --> 00:06:17.560
spray bottles that we have.

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:22.320
And then on this one, the same thing, this
is all like car stuff but again, it's round

00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:24.349
stuff inside here.

00:06:24.349 --> 00:06:28.439
So really, like if I wanted to fit a third
one, I could fit a third one.

00:06:28.439 --> 00:06:31.580
But I don't -- we don't have that many like
circular bottles and stuff.

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:33.189
But OK, that's there.

00:06:33.189 --> 00:06:36.490
And then down here, I've just taken two shoeboxes.

00:06:36.490 --> 00:06:40.580
And inside here, I put moving blankets and
old towels and stuff.

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:44.349
So like if we're moving something or we're
hauling something in the car, I'll just come

00:06:44.349 --> 00:06:48.449
here, grab this bin, grab the blankets, and
then put them in the car.

00:06:48.449 --> 00:06:51.129
And then down here is all of the really bulky
paint supplies.

00:06:51.129 --> 00:06:57.259
They are really awkward to store like the
pain tray is really weird to store and like

00:06:57.259 --> 00:06:59.349
the paint rollers and stuff are really weird.

00:06:59.349 --> 00:07:01.700
So those just fit nicely tucked away inside
that bin.

00:07:01.700 --> 00:07:04.259
And then again, I use the bright yellow tape
so it pops.

00:07:04.259 --> 00:07:05.259
OK.

00:07:05.259 --> 00:07:10.120
So over here, I have all of the bags for yard
work and really just like the heavy contractor

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:12.009
bags for storing heavy things.

00:07:12.009 --> 00:07:13.759
So, how do you organize your garage?

00:07:13.759 --> 00:07:18.659
Is there something that you do to kind of
contain the clutter and so it's really easy

00:07:18.659 --> 00:07:20.330
to come inside your garage and find exactly
what you're looking for?

00:07:20.330 --> 00:07:22.389
Leave a comment below and let us know what
that is.

00:07:22.389 --> 00:07:26.099

Bye!
