Ed Rudd: I grew up in Cleveland. My father was a truck driver,

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:08.050
my mother, you know, held several different

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:12.070
types of jobs. She had typical struggles being a single

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.090
mom, trying to take care of her kids and

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:20.110
hold down a job and go to community college. I think over time it

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.150
kind of overwhelmed her, to the point where she couldn't finish that up.

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:28.170
But even from when I started high school, early on we were

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:32.190
talking and planning about how to get a college education.

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:36.250
And it was something really important in our family. My family wanted to get me into

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.300
a prep school to prepare for college, so one of the

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.320
things we did to be able to do that is, I did a work study

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.340
for the four years, working with the janitors, you know, mopping floors and

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:52.410
things like that, to be able to afford the private prep school tuition.

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:56.450
That just became part of my overall education experience

00:00:56.470 --> 00:01:00.480
and I expected to continue that, and I did that all the way through

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:04.530
as an undergraduate and even when I went back to graduate school, there was always a work study

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:08.560
component, or an assistantship. If you're not afraid of doing the

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:12.680
work, there's almost, there's nothing you really can't do, and I think at the university

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:16.770
it helps you develop, you know, and

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:20.840
you start to understand, if you're in the right environment and you're not afraid of doing the work

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:24.940
then there are a number of people who are willing to work

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.980
with you and help you get through anything, and

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.020
that's something very powerful to take into the business world or into the work

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:37.130
world after you leave college. After putting in, you know,

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:41.150
a good 10, 15 years post-graduate work,

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:45.160
I started, with a few other partners, an IT consulting

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:49.190
group. Every family has that hope and

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:53.220
desire for their children--I certainly have it for my children--

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.230
to make sure that they have the same opportunities I had or maybe even

00:01:57.250 --> 00:02:01.230
have it a little bit easier, given that I got a little farther

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:05.260
along. It becomes not just you yourself, it's your whole family now.

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.300
I think that stuck with my sister and inspired her to go back later and to do

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:13.340
that, so I think it's very much a family, a family achievement. It's

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.980
not just an individual getting a diploma.
