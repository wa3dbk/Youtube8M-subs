I actually just got into doing a lot
more squats at the gym

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.480

but my booty on point I'm busy

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:26.660

issues

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:30.470
surrounding other people and what other
people go through but

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:33.630
I don't say much about like what I'm
going

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:37.610
there what's going on in my life and I
kinda wanna start to incorporate that

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:41.360
more in my video so I'm not just ok

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:44.600
I'll be honest sometimes guys these
videos like I wanna talk about

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.340
important issues but when I talk about
important issues

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:52.579
all the time it gets really heavy so I want to 
update you on a lot of things that are

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:53.500
going on

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.850
in my life right now first I love the
discussions that we have on here because

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:01.289

conscious people

respond to each other in the comments

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:05.439
 

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:09.740

out with each other's issues I don't

produce the music that I have wanted to
for my whole life but I just couldn't

00:01:39.829 --> 00:01:44.610

I will be running for a charity

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:04.750
I was I wanted to run for charity before
but I just didn't find one that really

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:05.869
aligned with

00:02:05.869 --> 00:02:10.239
you know something that I was interested
in running for and then I saw that the

00:02:10.239 --> 00:02:11.700
Human Rights Campaign

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:14.830
was involved with the Chicago Marathon
so I'm now running for

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:19.260
the Human Rights Campaign I think I have to raise like fifteen hundred dollars

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.980
and not Human Rights Campaign you know
stands for equality for the LGBT

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.130
community

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:28.750
which is something that I stand for. so

a book I want to be something simple and
since

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:47.010
this channel is a lot like motivational
stuff and I

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:50.060
there's a lotta quotable things I
thought about doing

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:53.350
a book of like funny and

00:02:53.350 --> 00:02:56.569
like motivational and

00:02:56.569 --> 00:02:59.600

with me another thing I've

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:40.390

I'm not good at this is

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:43.820

could start

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:49.420

for people who don't go on YouTube
they can't listen to it but they still

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:00.489
want the information

00:04:00.489 --> 00:04:04.620
as well as having a forum where people
can go and like

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:07.700
