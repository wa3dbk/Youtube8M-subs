00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:04.250
&gt;&gt;Julia: Today we're going to discuss the
average cost for remodeling a bathroom.

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:08.059
From simple things like accessories or adding
a vessel sink all the way to a complete remodel,

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:09.059
we have the answers for you.

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:17.210
Please keep in mind the information presented
here are just averages but we do get this

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:18.630
question quite often from our clients.

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.640
So it seemed like a great topic to discuss
and walk you through all the things to take

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:25.829
into consideration just so you can get an
idea of what to expect if you're going to

00:00:25.829 --> 00:00:26.829
remodel your bathroom.

00:00:26.829 --> 00:00:29.220
The first thing to consider is cabinetry.

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:36.330
If you have custom built cabinetry you can
expect the low end to be about $75 per linear

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:42.300
foot for paint grade cabinetry up to $250
per linear foot.

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:43.969
Again that's for custom vanities.

00:00:43.969 --> 00:00:53.269
To have that finished to put the paint or
stain on it, you can expect that to be around

00:00:53.269 --> 00:00:55.350
$100 dollars per linear foot additional.

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.120
The thing to take into consideration with
plumbing is whether or not you can use the

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:05.880
existing plumbing lines or are you going to
be doing a major renovation meaning you're

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.540
going to relocate the toilet to a different
part of the bathroom or you're going to relocate

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:10.540
your shower.

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:17.369
If you are just changing out fixtures as an
example like your faucets and shower head

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:21.860
you can expect that to be around $600 for
the entire bathroom.

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:27.619
However if you're doing a major renovation
changing out the layout of your plumbing.

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:30.119
You can expect that to be about $2600.

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:37.159
In addition if you want to add a Jacuzzi tub,
the average cost of adding that is about $1000.

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:40.170
For mirrors budget between $200-500 dollars.

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:46.670
That's a good amount of money to get a high
quality mirror.

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:52.150
Lighting and electrical run very similar to
plumbing.

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:59.250
Can you use your existing fixtures and electrical
lines or are you going to need to move your

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:01.549
existing layout?

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:05.520
If you're just changing out existing fixtures
and hang up new lighting fixtures, you can

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:10.610
expect an electrician to cost between $75
-$100 dollars an hour.

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:16.300
If you're going to totally revamp your lighting
design and add things like recessed lighting

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:20.900
or an exhaust fan, you can expect that to
cost an average of about $1500.

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:26.700
The next thing would be flooring, there are
two pieces or two components to your flooring.

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:28.740
You need to think about labor and material.

00:02:28.740 --> 00:02:34.191
Your labor install will really depend on the
area you're working in, but we have found

00:02:34.191 --> 00:02:37.860
that the average cost is between $4-6 dollars
a square foot.

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:44.500
Then obviously the tile material or whatever
you choose for your flooring can range between

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.630
$2-$20 per square foot.

00:02:46.630 --> 00:02:53.550
Tile is the most popular but there are other
things to consider like wood.

00:02:53.550 --> 00:03:02.950
Moving on to the shower, if you were just
going to add a once piece around shower you

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:05.580
can expect that to cost around $400.

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:10.650
If you want a tiled shower you can expect
those costs to be similar to the tile costs

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:14.900
that we had talked about with flooring for
example.

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:23.560
Drywall and paint: budget about $600 for basic
textured walls.

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:28.520
But if you decide to go with something fancy
like an artistic plaster finish you can go

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:31.530
up to as much as $2500 dollars.

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:33.430
Counter tops also vary.

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:39.880
If you go with something popular like granite
or marble you can expect to pay anywhere from

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:42.640
$40-$60 dollars per linear foot.

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:47.260
And that's really dependent on the material
you use.

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.380
Accessories range from about $100-500.

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:59.440
Accessories would be all the little stuff
that you're going to add to your bathroom

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:00.440
remodel project.

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:10.700
It could be the hardware on your vanity or
your towel bars just to name a few ideas.

00:04:10.700 --> 00:04:13.140
Just keep in mind that these are average costs.
