Hi, this is Brian from OpticsPlanet and
I'm here today to talk to you about the

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:10.959
Brite Strike APALS.

00:00:10.959 --> 00:00:15.079
APALS actually stands for
All-Purpose Adhesive Light Strips

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:18.649
they were designed by the military to
give you a portable, reliable, and

00:00:18.649 --> 00:00:22.609
disposable light source that's super easy
to use. They come in a number of different

00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:23.520
colors

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:26.410
from clear white, to green, pink

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:28.640
orange, blue, and red.

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.160
Because they were designed by the military,
the APALS can also come in an infrared

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.820
which will show up on night vision
but not to the naked eye.

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:39.460
Using the APALS is actually very easy, a
single button press turns on the fast strobe

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:41.899
where a second press will
go to a slow strobe

00:00:41.899 --> 00:00:44.360
and a third press gets to a constant on

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:45.790
forth press turns it off

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:48.560
but you're going to get a really nice
bright light. So when you're out at night

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:52.570
you can be seen up to a quarter mile away
and it can be seen through thin fabric, so

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:53.980
that's really nice.

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:57.590
Now it also has a 35 hour run time,
that's going to be really useful

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:00.960
you're not going to run out of
battery life halfway through a jog.

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.949
That reliability from the runtime is
also prevalent in the adhesive, it

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.830
adhere's to a number of different surfaces
including wood, brick,

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:09.920
steel,

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.770
and fabric. In addition to that if you're
wearing this on in the rain, it's still

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.900
going to adhere and the light is completely
submersible. So if you get wet the light

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.110
itself is not going to short out.

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:24.040
There are a number of different uses for
the APALS as well, it's really good

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:26.710
for keeping yourself visible when
you're out jogging at night

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:30.220
if you're out for breast cancer walk you can
actually use one of the pink ones to show a little

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:31.329
extra support

00:01:31.329 --> 00:01:34.670
and any of the other colors are
really great for marking yourself

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:37.100
when you're in a paintball game or
if you're training for tactical

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:38.100
situations

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.079
you can mark yourself with one color and
the other team with a different color to

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:42.810
keep track of who's who.

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.630
