00:00:00.178 --> 00:00:03.230
(cheery guitar tone)

00:00:03.413 --> 00:00:06.975
(happy guitar music)

00:00:07.964 --> 00:00:08.655
- Today we're visiting

00:00:08.655 --> 00:00:10.890
two of the favorite spots just outside

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:12.271
of San Francisco.

00:00:12.271 --> 00:00:13.571
Muir Woods.

00:00:13.571 --> 00:00:15.548
And Sonoma wine country.

00:00:17.423 --> 00:00:19.170
It's amazing that just over the bridge

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.365
a short drive from San Francisco,

00:00:21.365 --> 00:00:23.214
you find this oasis.

00:00:23.214 --> 00:00:25.637
It's so serene and peaceful.

00:00:26.972 --> 00:00:29.166
There are all sorts of different trails

00:00:29.166 --> 00:00:31.056
through Muir Woods so you can

00:00:31.056 --> 00:00:33.819
walk along, you can come here for a run.

00:00:33.819 --> 00:00:36.703
You just have these
trees towering above you.

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:38.856
Wow.

00:00:39.419 --> 00:00:41.877
These trees are so big,
I fit right inside.

00:00:41.877 --> 00:00:43.509
I feel like a little house.

00:00:43.895 --> 00:00:45.019
Unbelievable.

00:00:45.542 --> 00:00:48.048
(rustic upbeat music)

00:00:48.935 --> 00:00:51.225
We've arrived here, in beautiful Sonoma.

00:00:51.225 --> 00:00:52.327
We're gonna head to a winery,

00:00:52.327 --> 00:00:53.641
and try some wines.

00:00:55.096 --> 00:00:57.758
This winery is one of only ten wineries

00:00:57.758 --> 00:01:00.486
to produce wine during the prohibition.

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.352
This is actually a descendant of the first

00:01:04.352 --> 00:01:07.385
vine grown in northern California.

00:01:08.252 --> 00:01:10.203
Mm, you can have some of the grapes

00:01:10.203 --> 00:01:11.814
right off the vine.

00:01:12.763 --> 00:01:13.799
We've explored the winery,

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.095
now it's time to taste some wine.

00:01:16.095 --> 00:01:17.462
My favorite part.

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:21.590
- The first one is called Ruset.

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:23.818
- Mm, I like that.

00:01:23.818 --> 00:01:25.008
Good start.

00:01:25.524 --> 00:01:28.014
Fun fact, some of the
barrels here at the winery

00:01:28.014 --> 00:01:29.416
are made of redwood.

00:01:29.416 --> 00:01:31.894
And unlike oak, which affects the flavor

00:01:31.894 --> 00:01:34.989
of the wine, redwood
leaves it just the same.

00:01:35.795 --> 00:01:37.299
- This is chardonnay.

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:39.926
Very light-bodied, but still, very citrus.

00:01:42.114 --> 00:01:43.353
- I've had such a wonderful day

00:01:43.353 --> 00:01:46.041
exploring Muir Woods, and Sonoma,

00:01:46.197 --> 00:01:48.189
gonna finish one last glass of wine

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:50.491
and head back to San Francisco.
