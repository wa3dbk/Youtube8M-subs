Part 1 The Pattern and Cutting Out

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.660
I have lost count of the number of times I
have made this classic

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:25.380
I have made it up in cotton lawn, cotton poplin

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:28.610
printed silk, silk chiffon, polyesters and
more

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:32.340
This time it's this glorious silk print

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:35.500
bringing a ray of sunshine into the winter
wardrobe

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:39.540
I have downloaded and printed the pattern

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.620
I now produce A4 and Letter size versions

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:45.060
There's the intro page

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:47.060
A handy sheet for your own notes

00:00:47.289 --> 00:00:49.819
a small scale diagram of the pattern pieces

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:51.439
and then the pattern itself

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.260
The columns are numbered and the rows have
letters

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:57.820
Each size is a separate PDF

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:03.140
To prepare your pattern you just need tape
and scissors

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:12.960
For cutting out your fabric you need pins,
fabric shears

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:16.110
smaller shears are useful for awkward curves

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.020
a ruler

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.400
a large set square is handy

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.800
I have had this one since college days and
it's specific to pattern drafting

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:36.400
a tape measure and my handy gauge

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:49.020
and for construction you will need the pins,
tape measure

00:01:52.980 --> 00:02:01.480
perhaps the shears, gauge, basting thread

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.180
contrast thread for tailor tacks

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:13.470
machine thread most suited to your fabric

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:17.480
needles called sharps for hand sewing

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:23.680
a thimble, I often use a tailor's thimble,
the one with a hole

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:33.900
small sharp scissor for snips, interfacing
for collars and cuffs

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:43.780
I keep black and white handy in useful weights,
this time I'm using woven

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:51.840
some nice shirt buttons and lastly a stitch
ripper for slitting the button holes

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:55.980
Not forgetting of course a sewing machine

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:59.780
Now for a recap on preparing the patterns

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:04.920
Layout the columns and rows, edge to edge,
no overlap

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:10.720
Use something to keep the pages in place while
you stick

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:38.069
Don't forget, this is the seam line

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:43.160
These are net patterns.  You add seam allowance
as you cut out the fabric

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:47.140
Our pattern is ready

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:56.260
We have a collar band, we need to cut 2, the
collar itself, 2 again

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:03.060
2 cuffs, cut 2 sleeves

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:06.880
The shirt back is
placed on a fold so cut 1

00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:13.340
and lastly 2 shirt fronts.

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:20.239
This pattern is quite long

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:23.570
which is nice if you want to wear it outside
a skirt with a belt

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:25.100
or if you want to blouse it

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.660
but I am limited by the length of my silk
so I'm going to make it shorter

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:34.220
Because the pattern is cut straight

00:04:34.220 --> 00:04:36.560
I can just take some from the bottom edge

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:38.980
You can of course have it any length

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:44.919
Try a boxy version - a great look for wearing
with 60s style slacks

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:47.000
You can even extend it to become a shirt dress

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:51.880
I'm going to reduce the length of the sleeve
as well

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:56.169
It is quite blouson so I can afford to loose
some here too

00:04:56.169 --> 00:04:59.530
But this time to retain the integrity of the
sleeve shape

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:03.810
I shall take it out of the middle

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:13.800
¾" should do it

00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:31.360
Line up using the grid and correct the seam
line if necessary

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:41.010
This sleeve is comfortably wide

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:52.400
I might make that just ½” shorter

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:56.080
When you make this up in the future try a
short sleeve

00:05:56.680 --> 00:06:00.320
or three quarter length with a neat, above
the wrist cuff

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:03.580
Let's get this shirt cut out

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:26.200
My silk is 44" that's 110cm. wide and I only
have 2 metres in length

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:29.600
This is how I have laid it out

00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:32.759
I have had to cut the collar and collar band
pattern in half

00:06:32.759 --> 00:06:34.539
and placed them on the fold

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:38.440
Cut out the large pieces but leave the collar,
collar stand

00:06:38.449 --> 00:06:42.110
and cuffs until later - you will see why

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:46.479
