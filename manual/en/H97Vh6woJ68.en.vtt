00:00:03.440 --> 00:00:10.559
now we're going to replace the
driver's-side inner axle seal which is

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:19.699
on the transmission case it's called the
left-side output shaft seal

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.590
there you go you want to do the same
thing like I showed you in the

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:51.810
transmission filter you just want to
destroy the seal with a screwdriver and

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:59.960
pop it out of the bore you'll get a rag
they'll have some oil here

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.120
just clean up the oil with a rag

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:24.610
this is our new seal some time you
required a special tool to install this

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:31.420
seal what I did is I went to the Home
Depot I got a piece of pipe I use this

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:38.140
pipe to install the converter pump seal
and this side to install the axle seal a

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:43.920
simple pipe still made in China

00:01:46.590 --> 00:02:05.970
and I will take my plumbers pipe place
it up on the outer ring of the seal and

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:21.540
that's it our seal is in now you have to
replace the axle and destroy so if you

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:26.370
have to change our seal you will have to
replace the axle now when you install

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:32.190
the axle into the field make sure you
put some oil on the end of the axle and

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:35.810
enjoy thank you
