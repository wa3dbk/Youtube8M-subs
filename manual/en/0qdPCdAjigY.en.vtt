00:00:04.932 --> 00:00:11.853
Hello. I'm a ladder truck. Maybe you met my pal, the pumper truck. Together, we work to take

00:00:11.853 --> 00:00:18.850
firefighters to the scene of the fire, where they get people to safety and save buildings and property.

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:21.612
How do I work?   Let's take a look...

00:00:21.612 --> 00:00:28.839
	The truck has a captain, a driver, plus seats for eight to ten additional firefighters. Some ladder

00:00:28.839 --> 00:00:36.685
trucks are so long, there's a second driver - called the tiller - to steer the back end of the vehicle. The

00:00:36.685 --> 00:00:42.869
ladder truck carries a large folding ladder that can extend to more than one-hundred feet in the air. Many

00:00:42.869 --> 00:00:49.119
times, firefighters need to get high above the fire to properly put it out, or to rescue people from the

00:00:49.119 --> 00:00:56.047
upper floors of buildings. Underneath the ladder is a pipe that carries water to be sprayed from the very

00:00:56.047 --> 00:01:02.546
top. Along with a panel to control the pumping of water to the hose, the ladder truck can carry more than

00:01:02.546 --> 00:01:05.386
seven-hundred gallons of its own water.

00:01:05.386 --> 00:01:12.572
	When the ladder truck first arrives at a fire, the driver must extend two sets of stabilizers - front

00:01:12.572 --> 00:01:19.206
and back - to keep the truck from tipping over once the ladder is stretched up high over the fire. And,

00:01:19.206 --> 00:01:25.379
along with the ladder - boy, there's a lot of gear that firefighters need to put out fires. All the

00:01:25.379 --> 00:01:31.769
compartments on the ladder truck hold equipment like hoses, smaller ladders, axes, sledgehammers,

00:01:31.769 --> 00:01:39.557
saws, bolt cutters, ropes, fans to clear away smoke, and other very important tools.

00:01:39.557 --> 00:01:44.761
	The ladder truck is just one of many vehicles that show up on a fire scene, along with the pumper

00:01:44.761 --> 00:01:51.165
truck, ambulances, police cars, and other rescue equipment. They all work together to help the

00:01:51.165 --> 00:01:58.299
firefighters, EMTs, police officers, and other rescue crew members to do their jobs the very best they

00:01:58.299 --> 00:02:03.867
can.  	See ya! And hey, be careful out there!
