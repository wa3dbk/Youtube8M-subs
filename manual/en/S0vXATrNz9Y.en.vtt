00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:20.740
Hey!

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.640
Hey!

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.160
Uhh, I hate Mondays.

00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:27.520
Same, first day of the working week?
Uhh, so boring.

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:29.400
Yeah, I totally agree.

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.160
(CRASH)

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:43.000
Wow.

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.260
(EXPLOSION)

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:53.120
Well that's not something you see every day.

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:56.260
Do you think we should go help that guy?

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.760
Nah.

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.640
Aah, I'm on fire!

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:02.000
Aaah, help!

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.160
Help, somebody!

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:04.140
Aaah!

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:08.480
What the hell! Didn't either
of you try to save me?

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:12.360
Nah, it's our coffee break,

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.600
we don't have to work!

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:16.020
Well you could have at least
checked if I was okay?

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:18.560
We couldn't be bothered moving.

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.560
Yeah, it's coffee break, best part of the day.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.840
Well, apart from home time.

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.520
What?

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:26.200
We're on patrol here

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.280
so we need to make sure that nothing
goes wrong and no-one trespasses.

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:31.160
Wait, what planet is this?

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.140
Yeah, we should've checked that
before we came.

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:37.040
I think we're on Kashyyyk but I'm not sure.

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.780
Probably but I dunno,

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.760
we would've seen some Wookies by now.

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:42.440
Yeah.

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:45.560
I don't think Vader will be happy with us,

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.080
I mean, we're supposed to
arrest anyone who trespasses here.

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.300
Do you think we should arrest this guy?

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:52.660
Probably.

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.140
You're under arrest! For uhh,

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.640
well, you're just under arrest.

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.640
What?

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.440
First you let me die
and now you're going to arrest me?

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:04.760
Now come on, you both know it was
an accident that I crashed here. Be nice.

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:06.140
Well

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:07.440
I dunno.

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:09.740
I think we should arrest him

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:11.900
to be on the safe side with Darth Vader.

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:13.600
Now wait a second.

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:16.520
(WOOKIE GROWLS)

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:18.960
Hey asshole, let us go!

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:21.640
Yeah, why aren't you going for him?

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.320
Well you see, I'm friends with these guys

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:25.980
we play poker every Saturday night.

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:27.500
(WOOKIE GROWLS)

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.040
Good, now tell them to let us go.

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.020
I can't really do that.

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:33.520
Uhh why not?

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.880
Well I could if I wanted to

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.820
but you didn't exactly try and save me.

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:40.760
Oh come on, we'll be nice to you?

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:42.500
Hmmm.

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.740
We'll fix your ship for you.

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:45.560
What?

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:46.280
Deal!

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.500
Oh come on I didn't agree to this.

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:50.160
Ahhhhh.
