00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:07.960
Hello everyone and welcome back in my
kitchen today we see the various steps

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:12.010
necessary to the realization of a good
risotto fundamental basis to achieve

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:13.979
then the various risotto

00:00:13.979 --> 00:00:18.719
generally for 4 portions
sufficient 360 grams of rice up

00:00:18.719 --> 00:00:19.869
or superfine

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:24.259
the most suitable are arborio Carnaroli
but also the Vialone Nano

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:28.109
approximately one half of the white background vegetable
broth cartoon depending on the type of

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:32.009
risotto to be realized from 40 to 70 grams
fat usually

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:35.589
represented by butter or oil
extra virgin olive oil that passono be the st

00:00:35.589 --> 00:00:40.320
also used together with 25 grams of 30
white or golden onion finely chopped

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.550
70 80 ml of red wine or white wine
sparkling champagne or other alcoholic substance

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:50.549
salt and white pepper or black
Depending on the type of risotto finally from 30

00:00:50.549 --> 00:00:54.559
to 50 grams of grated cheese
usually grain or Parmesan

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:58.320
It used for almost all types of rice except for some rice with fish

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.350
we start with the roast of rice
that should be done in a base made up

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:06.140
or with finely chopped onion
shallots or leeks always chopped

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:06.909
finely

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:10.659
to which is added then a fat
which may be butter or oil depending on the preparation

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:14.009
we can use them 'together primarily because of

00:01:14.009 --> 00:01:16.670
the fact that the butter has a smoke point of more
bass

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:18.880
and therefore it tends to burn quickly

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:22.760
add the onion and let it fry very gentle flame until

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:24.130
becomes transparent

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:27.870
at this point we combine the rice and
we toast, stirring often

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:31.540
until the beans are hot, however, it is important that you do not dorino

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:34.560
we can see the intensity of the temperature by touching the beans with a finger

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.399
and 'important however that the roasting
always takes place over moderate heat

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:42.100
both to avoid that the grain can take up a
golden color is to prevent

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:43.580
the onion does not burn

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:44.820
at this point sfumiamo with wine

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.340
and let evaporate

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:51.750
once the wine is completely evaporated
begin cooking, adding the

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:52.640
broth

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.950
the amount of broth should be
enough to cover the rice

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.100
then let simmer and add more broth from time to time each

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.630
time is absorbed

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:04.700
let cook rice for another 6 7
minutes after which we combine the sauce

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.729
then characterizes risotto that will be a mushroom sauce with asparagus sauce fisherman

00:02:08.729 --> 00:02:13.019
or simply
saffron or other ingredients

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:17.559
we consider that for cook
a risotto takes between 14 and 16 minutes depending

00:02:17.559 --> 00:02:19.139
to the type of rice used

00:02:19.139 --> 00:02:22.299
when the rice is still very al dente
add salt we remove it from the

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:23.829
fire

00:02:23.829 --> 00:02:27.219
once removed from the fire will have rice
present wave that is shaking

00:02:27.219 --> 00:02:30.069
casserole will form the classical wave

00:02:30.069 --> 00:02:34.070
so at this point we can whisk
in the case of a fish

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:39.469
mantechiamo only with oil otherwise
add butter and parmesan

00:02:39.469 --> 00:02:43.319
then stir vigorously

00:02:43.319 --> 00:02:48.329
so that it creates an emulsion is formed and the classic creamy sauce
typical risotto after

00:02:48.329 --> 00:02:52.249
cover with lid let rest
for a minute so that the flavors are in keeping

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:58.490
very important for the success
the rice is toasting

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:03.419
that the asterno jelly beans
preventing a large spill of starch

00:03:03.419 --> 00:03:05.209
