00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:07.590
A rash is a skin condition in which the color,
appearance or texture of skin changes.

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:13.969
Rashes can appear as blotches, redness, bumps,
lumps, welts, or blisters. They can be red,

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:20.350
itchy, scaly, dry, or weepy, and they can
occur in one area of skin or all over the

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:21.350
body.

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:26.190
In addition, some rashes may come and go,
while others never seem to go away.

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:31.930
To the untrained eye, all rashes may look
alike and seem easily treatable with over-the-counter

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:35.300
oral antihistamines or hydrocortisone cream.

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:40.980
However, since rashes have many causes, the
best way to correctly diagnose a rash is to

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.540
see a dermatologist.

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:49.100
Although most rashes are not life-threatening,
some may signal something more serious.

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:55.140
If you have a rash and notice any of the following
symptoms, see a dermatologist immediately.

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.060
The rash is all over your body.

00:00:57.060 --> 00:01:02.449
A rash that covers the body usually indicates
something more serious, such as an infection

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:04.300
or allergic reaction.

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:06.159
You have a fever with the rash.

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:09.420
If this is the case, seek immediate medical
attention.

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.530
This could be caused by a serious allergic
reaction or an infection.

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:19.410
Examples of rashes caused by infection include
scarlet fever, measles, mononucleosis, and

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:20.880
shingles.

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.759
The rash appears suddenly and spreads rapidly.

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:25.750
This could be the result of an allergy.

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:29.990
Allergies to medications are common, and some
can be serious.

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:35.939
If breathing becomes difficult, go to the
emergency room immediately or call 911.

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:40.369
The rash is made up of blisters, or the rash
turns into open sores.

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:46.310
This could be the result of an allergic reaction,
a reaction to medication, or an internal cause.

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:51.110
Go to the emergency room immediately if the
blisters affect your eyes, multiple areas

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:53.030
in your mouth or your genitals.

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:55.590
The rash is painful.

00:01:55.590 --> 00:02:00.290
Painful rashes can be a sign of a serious
problem and should quickly be evaluated by

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:01.939
a dermatologist.

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:03.500
The rash is infected.

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.560
If you have an itchy rash and you scratch
it, it may become infected.

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:13.260
Signs of an infected rash are yellow or green
fluid, swelling, crusting, pain and warmth

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.940
in the area of the rash, or a red streak coming
from the rash.

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:23.250
Go to the emergency room or call 911 immediately
if you have a rash and youâ€™re having trouble

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:28.110
breathing or have swelling of the lips, tongue
or throat.

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.110
Rashes can come in many forms and, depending
on the cause, they can take days or even weeks

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:33.110
to heal.

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:38.390
Rather than try to treat the rash on your
own, see a board-certified dermatologist.

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:41.810
A dermatologist is trained to tell which rashes require more extensive medical testing and

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:46.530
can properly diagnose the rash and determine
the best course for treatment.
