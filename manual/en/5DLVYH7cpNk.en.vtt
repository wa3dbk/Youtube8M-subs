This is Yolanda Vanveen from Vanveenbulbs.com.
In this segment we're learning all about how

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:15.430
to care for Lucky Bamboo. Now, first off Lucky
Bamboo is not even bamboo. It's really the

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:21.070
Dracaena plant. It's like a house plant. It's
the Dracaena. It grows a lot like a bamboo,

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:26.600
but it's still a different plant. Now, this
Dracaena or Lucky Bamboo I just have in a

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:31.680
vase with water and rocks and then the roots
are down there. It's so easy I don't really

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:36.941
take care of it in anyway. I just leave it
in a sunny window or even part window. It's

00:00:36.941 --> 00:00:42.079
not very sunny in there at all. It seems to
grow really well. I did let it dry out too

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:49.379
much and as you can see I've lost some leaves.
So, all I have to do is peel off these leaves

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:54.239
and they'll just grow more and more plants.
At one time I had left it out on the deck,

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:59.690
outside during the summer, and it got too
cold at night in the fall. It did lots of

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:03.739
damage and it pretty much froze down. So,
I just chopped it all the way back and put

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:09.400
it in the house in a sunny window and eventually
it just shot up new shoots again. So, one

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:15.020
thing I love about my Lucky Bamboo is even
if I kill it, usually I don't kill it. It

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.870
will come back again. So, periodically I just
take out all the yellow leaves or the dead

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:24.260
leaves or if it looks really ratty I'll chop
them all the way down and they'll grow new

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:30.170
growth again. This particular Lucky Bamboo
probably should be in more sunlight. It's

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:34.150
kind of; I haven't been watering it very well
and it's a little bit wimpy looking. I might

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:37.700
give it just a little bit of fertilizer just
to give it some more nutrition, because it

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:43.780
hasn't had any nutrition in years. At this
point I might give it some fertilizer. Lucky

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:48.460
Bamboo is so easy to grow. It's a wonderful
plant for inside and outside in the summer.

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:52.321
I'll just leave it on my deck all summer long
as well and then just bring it in the fall

00:01:52.321 --> 00:01:56.850
when it starts getting cold at night. I do
know if you do leave it outside and it gets

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:01.240
below even forty-five it seems like they get
damaged, so you'll eventually loose them.

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:06.750
So, they're more of an indoor plant, especially
in the winter time. I leave mine indoors year

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.250
around and as you can see I don't take much
care of it and it does really well.
