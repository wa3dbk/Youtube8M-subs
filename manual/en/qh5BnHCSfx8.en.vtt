00:00:01.155 --> 00:00:03.387
I'm here with Nicolas Belleux.

00:00:03.707 --> 00:00:04.330
Good morning,

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:06.509
I am really honored and it’s a great pleasure

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:08.353
to welcome you here in Milan today.

00:00:08.651 --> 00:00:09.498
Hello Xenia

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.225
thank you for the invitation

00:00:11.345 --> 00:00:13.157
I am also pleased to be with you today.

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.712
You are a doctor, a psychiatrist

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.613
and work as a doctor since 15 years.

00:00:39.795 --> 00:00:43.809
How did you get to be a traditional doctor

00:00:44.182 --> 00:00:52.094
and develop a so great, innovative,
and not exactly traditional technique?

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:53.202
That's right

00:00:53.322 --> 00:00:55.443
I am, as you say, a doctor

00:00:55.777 --> 00:00:58.951
and after achieving my studies in medicine in Lausanne

00:00:59.183 --> 00:01:03.502
I gradually got specialized in psychiatry, psychotherapy,

00:01:03.832 --> 00:01:06.906
and also in all neuroscience techniques.

00:01:08.203 --> 00:01:13.568
During my studies...

00:01:13.688 --> 00:01:15.996
...I already felt that something was missing.

00:01:17.167 --> 00:01:18.758
It was extremely interesting,

00:01:18.878 --> 00:01:21.172
since it was studying biochemistry, anatomy, physiology,

00:01:21.292 --> 00:01:24.125
and finally various branches of western medicine,

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:28.123
but it's like going out on something

00:01:28.582 --> 00:01:30.834
and that is when I discovered eastern techniques,

00:01:31.301 --> 00:01:34.214
such as Indian medicine or Chinese medicine, Ayurveda,

00:01:34.334 --> 00:01:37.942
where I discovered another way of seeing the human being,

00:01:38.062 --> 00:01:40.032
illness and healing.

00:01:40.635 --> 00:01:43.561
Your technical support to anxiety,

00:01:43.817 --> 00:01:45.448
and that helps...

00:01:46.096 --> 00:01:47.673
...to raise its potential.

00:01:47.793 --> 00:01:50.073
I saw a lot of results

00:01:50.311 --> 00:01:52.705
and many applications of this technique.

00:01:53.115 --> 00:01:55.273
But it's still somewhat of a mystery...

00:01:55.393 --> 00:01:56.675
...and I would understand,

00:01:58.025 --> 00:02:00.829
not being an expert on a scientific basis,

00:02:01.116 --> 00:02:04.807
what is the practice of this technique?

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:10.821
You know, we often hear that
we use only 10% of our brain potential.

00:02:11.072 --> 00:02:13.275
Yes, I heard that many times!

00:02:13.598 --> 00:02:18.371
And maybe you've recently seen
the fabulous movie by Luc Besson: Lucy.

00:02:18.883 --> 00:02:21.634
It tells the story of a woman...

00:02:21.895 --> 00:02:24.309
...who gradually increases its brain potential.

00:02:25.294 --> 00:02:27.856
Luc Besson shows, at least makes an assumption...

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:30.963
...of how one could live that experience.

00:02:31.083 --> 00:02:31.832
It wouldn’t be bad!

00:02:32.375 --> 00:02:33.488
That would be quite interesting,

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:35.104
but later the woman disappears!

00:02:37.685 --> 00:02:40.576
Luc Besson is right and wrong at the same time.

00:02:41.713 --> 00:02:46.112
Wrong because it is false
that we only use 10% of our brain capacity.

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:48.148
The 100% is used.

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:55.668
However, it is right because
we consciously use the 10% of our brain capacity.

00:02:56.284 --> 00:02:58.135
The other 90%...

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:00.455
...is unconscious.

00:03:00.968 --> 00:03:06.455
To allow the heart beat, digestion, kidneys, etc.

00:03:06.706 --> 00:03:08.734
Even the movements that I am doing...

00:03:08.854 --> 00:03:09.956
...the posture I have...

00:03:10.076 --> 00:03:11.750
...all is perfectly unconscious...

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:13.969
...even if I decide I do not do that...

00:03:14.408 --> 00:03:17.646
...this muscle will contract, that finger will raise.

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:25.306
My brain will unconsciously give orders to my body
so that it can perform what I want.

00:03:25.895 --> 00:03:28.196
Hence the history of the 10%-90%...

00:03:28.584 --> 00:03:34.178
...and the entire Energy1 technique
is about making the person act more conscious.

00:03:41.457 --> 00:03:45.164
I would like you to explain to me how it goes.

00:03:45.472 --> 00:03:49.190
What happens during a typical session with you?

00:03:49.398 --> 00:03:50.641
It’s not about psychiatry,

00:03:50.761 --> 00:03:52.870
I'm not going to analyze you,

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:54.580
I don’t need to know what you did during your childhood.

00:03:54.988 --> 00:03:57.226
I just need to know who you are...

00:03:57.892 --> 00:03:59.725
...and what difficulties you have now.

00:04:02.101 --> 00:04:06.529
Next, I will discuss what process I will use...

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:10.110
...because Energy1 has different techniques...

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:15.150
...to help the person, according who she is.

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:18.150
So this is not a single technique?

00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:22.988
It is a technique that will fit the needs of the person,

00:04:23.108 --> 00:04:24.526
to whom she is now.

00:04:24.944 --> 00:04:29.270
What is the success rate of your technique?

00:04:29.390 --> 00:04:32.270
The part of success, I'd say,

00:04:33.170 --> 00:04:34.544
is a very modest 100%.

00:04:35.465 --> 00:04:36.830
Since everyone...

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:38.470
...gets something.

00:04:39.333 --> 00:04:42.830
Now to get to the goal that the person has set,

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:44.910
it takes more or less time.

00:04:45.170 --> 00:04:47.910
I saw with a friend of mine...

00:04:48.714 --> 00:04:50.583
...that you used your hands.

00:04:51.848 --> 00:04:53.880
You spoke with that friend...

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:57.110
...and you took a lot of time
and understood what she had

00:04:57.410 --> 00:04:59.670
and then you treated her by hands.

00:05:00.193 --> 00:05:02.874
What will happen when you do this
without touching the person?

00:05:03.262 --> 00:05:04.284
Without touching the person.

00:05:05.087 --> 00:05:07.547
Here is one of the techniques I use.

00:05:09.768 --> 00:05:11.195
It is rather an oriental theory.

00:05:11.505 --> 00:05:14.085
I think you know Chinese medicine

00:05:14.205 --> 00:05:17.758
where you see these posters
with a man back and face

00:05:18.083 --> 00:05:21.984
with plain circuits used for acupuncture.

00:05:22.926 --> 00:05:27.453
All these channels are energy channels
that will bring energy to the entire body,

00:05:28.076 --> 00:05:31.533
and all the channels will be grouped
into three main channels,

00:05:32.186 --> 00:05:34.838
and it is these channels that will distribute energy
throughout the body.

00:05:36.045 --> 00:05:40.844
The technique that I used with your girlfriend
is precisely to release these three channels

00:05:41.658 --> 00:05:45.470
to allow the person to regain the potential it had originally.

00:05:46.532 --> 00:05:49.312
This is to remove the bottlenecks created

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:53.561
based on events from childhood or installed beliefs

00:05:54.094 --> 00:05:57.996
and create a limitation at different levels in life.

00:05:58.232 --> 00:06:04.197
Is it different from the Reiki technique
that is this healing technique with hands?

00:06:04.261 --> 00:06:04.817
Yes.

00:06:05.966 --> 00:06:09.849
The difference between Energy1 and Reiki is,

00:06:09.969 --> 00:06:11.151
as I said earlier,

00:06:12.078 --> 00:06:14.530
in the research that I have done in the field of neuroscience

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:18.639
for exceeding the eastern side

00:06:18.973 --> 00:06:23.876
and create a whole between wealth and the Eastern wisdom

00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:28.037
and Western modernity and scientific side

00:06:29.368 --> 00:06:31.617
Reiki is purely oriental.

00:06:32.611 --> 00:06:35.173
The other major difference is that in Reiki...

00:06:36.034 --> 00:06:40.854
...the therapist will capture energy in an egregore,

00:06:41.562 --> 00:06:43.514
energy will pass through it

00:06:43.634 --> 00:06:45.691
and it will transmit to person.

00:06:45.974 --> 00:06:48.732
The person is in front of him,

00:06:49.123 --> 00:06:50.539
sometimes he touches

00:06:50.903 --> 00:06:51.827
or remotely.

00:06:52.528 --> 00:06:56.371
The difference with Energy1 is that I bring you anything...

00:06:57.348 --> 00:07:01.579
...because I'm assuming that you have everything inside you.

00:07:02.521 --> 00:07:04.459
You are someone immensely rich,

00:07:04.948 --> 00:07:08.487
but as I said earlier, you only use 10% of your wealth.

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:13.043
So why bring you something from the outside
while you have everything inside of you?

00:07:13.867 --> 00:07:17.105
So rather than give you something from the outside
perhaps not for you,

00:07:17.524 --> 00:07:19.998
maybe this energy does not go well with you,

00:07:21.478 --> 00:07:23.567
I release your own energy...

00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:25.399
...your potential.

00:07:26.511 --> 00:07:28.320
This is the potential Energy1!

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:29.299
Exactly!
