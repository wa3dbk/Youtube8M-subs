My name is Christine Marquette, and I'm a
registered dietitian with the Austin Regional

00:00:04.040 --> 00:00:07.931
Clinic, and I'm going to talk to you about
how to make a natural diuretic. There are

00:00:07.931 --> 00:00:14.459
actually a lot of different things that are
natural diuretics. Tea for example, coffee,

00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:19.019
anything with caffeine in it. Caffeine in
itself is a diuretic that will actually cause

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:24.960
you to urinate a lot more frequently. Other
things that are diuretics; fruits and vegetables;

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.140
in particular, those that have a very high
water content, for example, watermelon, or

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:34.840
cantaloupe, or honeydew. All of those things;
because they have such a high water content,

00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:39.489
when you eat them you will get the urge to
go urinate more frequently than say if you

00:00:39.489 --> 00:00:45.250
ate fruit like a banana. Even though it has
water it has a lot less than a watermelon

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:52.910
or a honeydew melon would. A few other things
that have been used herbally; dandelion, ginger,

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:59.359
and Fennel Greek. Those are also herbs that
have been used for many years as diuretics.

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:04.680
One of the reasons that people use diuretics
are to help lower blood pressure, or for people

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:10.490
that suffer from edema that's basically fluid
retention. Now, if you're suffering from high

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:16.830
blood pressure or edema you really need to
see your doctor, because using an herbal remedy

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:22.110
is not the best method of controlling your
blood pressure or flushing out fluid that's

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.450
built up to the point that you could actually
have visual edema. So you really need to see

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:31.820
your doctor first. Get medically checked out;
get evaluated. Find out exactly what is going

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:37.340
on, and then if you truly need a diuretic,
prescription type will be the best option

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:43.250
for that particular problem. If you're just
looking to basically make sure that you are

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:49.450
flushing things out of your systems it's perfectly
fine to use water, an occasional glass of

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:54.410
tea, lots of fruits. Those are all good healthy
things, but again, that's just for normal

00:01:54.410 --> 00:02:00.510
amounts of urination. You don't want to overdose
on any of those things to try to control blood

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:05.700
pressure or to relieve pitting edema. Really,
go see your doctor. So, a couple of things

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.000
to keep in mind about natural diuretics.
