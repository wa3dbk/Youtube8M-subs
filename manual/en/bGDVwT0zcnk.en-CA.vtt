Hi, I'm going to do a tutorial on adding a
Guest Account to Windows 10.

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:17.090
You go to the Start Menu and start to type
User and User Accounts will come up at the

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:21.410
top.
Click on That.

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:31.980
Then Click on Manage Another Account.
Then Add a New User in PC Settings.

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:55.800
Add Someone Else to this PC.
The Person I want to add does not have an email. Add 
a User Without a Microsoft Account.

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:02.789
Then fill in the Name, you can't just use
Guest and you must create a password as well

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:06.880
here.
Then go back to the Start Menu.

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.159
Type User again.
Go to User Accounts.

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:21.579
Manage another Account.
You will see that your Guest Account is here.

00:01:21.579 --> 00:01:35.590
Now to get it to start, left click on your
name and you will see a switch 
to Guest, where you can switch to the Guest

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:38.590
Account.
Left click on your Name and you will see Guest

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:41.570
pops up and both Account options are on the
desktop as well.

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:46.780
You will be able to use those.
Hope this helps someone!

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:47.030
Have a great Day!
NOTE: You will not be able to do this if you

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.530
are not the Administrator of the computer.
