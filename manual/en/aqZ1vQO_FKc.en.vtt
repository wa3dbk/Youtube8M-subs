Hi my name is Kathrin Brunner and today I'm going to show you how to make all-natural

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:14.380
facial toner, so we're going to use half
a cup of rose water

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:17.400
making sure that it's actual rose water
and not rose scented water

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.750
it's incredibly soothing for the
skin, it's antimicrobial so it's really

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:23.470
good for acne prone skin

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:27.920
and it's a gentle cleanser, then we'll use
alcohol-free witch hazel which is a

00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:30.189
wonderful astringent so it's great for

00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:33.339
reducing any inflammation or puffiness in
the face

00:00:33.339 --> 00:00:36.550
takes away redness and helps to
balance out our skin tone

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:42.200
so a quarter cup of that and then we're going to use 1 tablespoon of aloe vera juice gel

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:46.199
which is wonderfully soothing
for the skin it's also a gentle

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:47.800
moisturizer so it's really good to

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:53.100
add during colder months or even for
sunburns, it helps to heal sunburns really quickly

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.309
and then vegetable glycerin which is a humectant, so a humectant means that it actually

00:00:57.309 --> 00:00:59.369
attracts moisture to the skin

00:00:59.369 --> 00:01:03.420
we're going to use a quarter of a teaspoon of the vegetable glycerin

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:07.650
and it'll help to keep the outer layer
of our skin really supple and smooth

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.630
especially in winter months when it's a
bit colder

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.600
and then last we'll use some lavender
essential oil, so lavender essential

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.900
oil is wonderfully healing for the
skin

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.890
helps to repair the skin and also
antimicrobial

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.850
so we'll give that a stir, all of these
ingredients should be found at your

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:25.870
health food store

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:30.500
if not you can find them online and the
wonderful thing about making your

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:34.020
own facial toner is that there's no need
for preservatives

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:38.340
in it so you don't have any of those
chemicals and it's so much cheaper when

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:38.890
you make your own

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:42.740
so a funnel works really well for this
and we'll want to use

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.990
a glass bottle or a BPA free

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:51.200
plastic bottle, preferably dark, and it will
store in the bathroom for

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:54.310
six months, longer if you store it in the fridge

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:59.260
so after you've washed your face you can
spritz it on your face and leave it on

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:00.800
to moisturize your face

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:04.720
or you can actually just wipe it off
with a cotton pad if you want to remove some more

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:05.659
debris from the skin

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:09.869
and there you have it all natural facial
toner that'll leave you with glowing

00:02:09.869 --> 00:02:15.780
vibrant skin

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.130
