00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Hi there. I’m Ocelot, the captain of my team, called “SK-Gaming”

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
And we come here to Dreamhack with Kingston HyperX to play LCS.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Coming here to Sweden is always a pleasure because the people, the crowd, is always so emotive about our team.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
They’re always cheering for us so much, and we really love it.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
So far, the second split of the season, we just want to improve where we did worse last season. 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.000
For the next week, we just want to improve, improve, improve, so we can play in the world finals.
0:00:34.000,0:00:10.000
I think our toughest opponent is Fnatic, and this season, it’s time to beat them.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
This weekend we didn’t do it, but the next time, be afraid of us.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:54.000
So here in Dreamhack, Kingston HyperX is launching the SteelSeries Siberia V2 edition.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
I actually used it myself and it’s really, really awesome

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:06.000
The sound quality is perfect and it’s literally, one of the best headsets you will find for competing in gaming, listening to music even; it’s really awesome.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:18.000
So, the Kingston HyperX headset is really comfortable, pretty light and just awesome to listen to music, play games, and just a good overall headset.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:28.000
HyperX products improve the performance of your PC, particularly when playing games or competing, when it’s so important to have everything perfect and not lag, and just have everything super smooth.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.000
I use it myself and I can tell you that you really notice it.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:42.000
To make eSports rule, we obviously need people who put a lot of effort into it , and luckily Kingston HyperX is around the world they’re sponsoring Dreamhack,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.000
They’re sponsoring a lot of teams around the world, and it’s really helpful because they’re always so awesome with us.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000
They always take care of us, and they provide us with the best quality so we’re very happy about it.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:04.000
We were with my team at the HyperX booth, signing autograph with the fans and everyone is so kind to us here and it’s always a pleasure to work with them. 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Thanks to HyperX for everything.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:14.000
So after these days here in Dreamhack in the HyperX booth,  with HyperX people and the HyperX fans even, 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:20.000
We are so happy and we can’t wait for the next year to come here again and spend time with you guys again.
