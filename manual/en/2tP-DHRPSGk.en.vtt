Hi, everybody! My name is Phil

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
and today we'll examine this
bass amplifier by Behringer

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
model BXL 1800A Ultrabass series.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
This is a 180-watt bass station
with dual-channel amp

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
and 12" aluminum speaker by Bugera.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
The front panel has two Gain knobs
for both channels and

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Shape and Level knobs for
the overdrive channel.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Also there is a 7-band graphic EQ

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.000
with Spectrum Analyzer function.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
At the right there is a Compressor knob,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
adjustment knob for the Ultrabass
function - it is a built-in octaver,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
and a master volume knob.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
The rear panel has a balanced XLR output,

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
a line output, external effects
loop connectors,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
an input for the external audio source

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
and a jack for the included footswitch.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.500
Let's listen to the clean channel.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.500
Let's try the Ultrabass mode.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
Now let's listen to the overdrive channel.
