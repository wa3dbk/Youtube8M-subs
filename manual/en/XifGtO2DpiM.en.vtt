00:00:12.434 --> 00:00:17.583
Pressing Ctrl + J, we can join two or more objects in one

00:00:20.323 --> 00:00:25.208
This is very useful, for example, to make a character into separate parts

00:00:25.458 --> 00:00:30.171
such as arms, legs and head, and later join them all

00:00:30.421 --> 00:00:32.835
to form one full character

00:00:54.125 --> 00:00:58.801
On the "Object Data" are the properties of the selected object

00:00:59.051 --> 00:01:04.391
This tab contains the configuration options, according to the object that is selected

00:01:04.641 --> 00:01:09.877
For example, if an object "Curve" is selected, the settings of the curve will be present

00:01:16.173 --> 00:01:20.085
The layering system is a very interesting and useful

00:01:20.335 --> 00:01:23.853
Layers are like an onion, for example,

00:01:24.103 --> 00:01:27.405
It has various layers, divided at the same Onion

00:01:27.655 --> 00:01:32.995
We can use the whole onion, one layer or just as seasoning a meal

00:01:33.245 --> 00:01:36.417
Suppose that in each layer of this onion

00:01:36.667 --> 00:01:38.455
were possible to store information

00:01:38.705 --> 00:01:40.597
and when we needed them

00:01:40.847 --> 00:01:43.338
we choose only the layer that contains what we want

00:01:43.588 --> 00:01:47.049
So does the system of layers in Blender

00:01:48.199 --> 00:01:49.792
Blender has 20 layers

00:01:50.042 --> 00:01:53.057
where we can store the objects we want

00:01:53.307 --> 00:01:56.688
We can save, for example, the cubes in one layer

00:01:56.938 --> 00:01:58.883
curves in another layer

00:01:59.133 --> 00:02:01.417
and other spheres in a layer

00:02:03.193 --> 00:02:06.066
With the cube selected, press the M

00:02:06.316 --> 00:02:08.522
This is the menu "Move to Layer"

00:02:08.772 --> 00:02:13.746
Just click on one of the layers 20 to move the object to her

00:02:14.922 --> 00:02:19.154
Now, the object appears only when the layer is active

00:02:21.714 --> 00:02:23.882
Again in the "Move to Layer"

00:02:24.132 --> 00:02:29.080
holding Shift, you can move the object to several layers at once

00:02:29.446 --> 00:02:33.469
Now, the object appears only in selected layers

00:02:40.731 --> 00:02:42.951
To activate or deactivate a layer,

00:02:43.201 --> 00:02:46.739
can click on the desired layer with the left mouse button

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:48.463
or use the keyboard

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.400
The numbers of alpha-numeric keyboard

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:55.934
activate the layers of the upper line

00:03:00.401 --> 00:03:03.640
segurando Alt e pressionando os mesmos nÃºmeros

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:06.200
activate the layers of the bass line

00:03:10.589 --> 00:03:14.115
Holding shift, and doing these same operations

00:03:14.365 --> 00:03:17.328
can select multiple layers simultaneously
