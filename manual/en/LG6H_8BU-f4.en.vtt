00:00:01.723 --> 00:00:02.919
- [Voiceover] You might
be wondering whether

00:00:02.919 --> 00:00:05.194
there are any factors that
might make someone more or less

00:00:05.194 --> 00:00:07.818
likely to conform or the
likelihood that they will

00:00:07.818 --> 00:00:09.397
adjust their behaviors or thinking

00:00:09.397 --> 00:00:11.139
to go along with the group.

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:12.851
And there certainly are.

00:00:13.077 --> 00:00:14.854
And while I won't go over
all of them in this video,

00:00:14.854 --> 00:00:17.315
I do want to give you a
pretty wide or diverse variety

00:00:17.315 --> 00:00:19.822
so you can see just how
much of this behavior

00:00:19.822 --> 00:00:21.912
can be dependent upon external factors

00:00:21.912 --> 00:00:23.781
that otherwise might have nothing to do

00:00:23.781 --> 00:00:25.308
with the person themselves.

00:00:26.602 --> 00:00:29.412
And the first factor I want
to talk about is group size.

00:00:29.412 --> 00:00:31.374
Specifically, people
seem to be more likely

00:00:31.374 --> 00:00:33.829
to conform when they're
in groups of three to five.

00:00:34.915 --> 00:00:36.157
We are also more likely to conform

00:00:36.157 --> 00:00:38.490
when the opinion of the group is unanimous

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:40.893
or when everyone in the group
agrees upon a certain opinion.

00:00:40.893 --> 00:00:45.893
As an example of this, in one
variant of the Asch line study

00:00:46.338 --> 00:00:48.277
the researchers changed the experiment

00:00:48.277 --> 00:00:50.773
such that the participant had a supporter,

00:00:50.773 --> 00:00:52.874
someone who gave the correct answer

00:00:52.874 --> 00:00:55.063
before it was the
participant's turn to answer.

00:00:56.055 --> 00:00:58.620
And what they found was
that even one defector

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.588
can influence how likely
an individual is to comply.

00:01:02.417 --> 00:01:03.834
So while in the original Asch study,

00:01:03.834 --> 00:01:06.411
37% of participants fully complied

00:01:06.411 --> 00:01:08.257
or complied on every trial,

00:01:08.257 --> 00:01:10.880
total compliance dropped to only 5%

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:12.628
when there was a supporter in the group.

00:01:13.493 --> 00:01:15.037
When they asked the
participants whether or not

00:01:15.037 --> 00:01:16.952
the presence of that defector in any way

00:01:16.952 --> 00:01:20.685
influenced their responses,
they claimed that they didn't.

00:01:21.329 --> 00:01:23.499
So while the research does
show that the presence

00:01:23.499 --> 00:01:26.635
of a defector influences how
likely we are to conform,

00:01:26.635 --> 00:01:27.993
it appears that we're not aware

00:01:27.993 --> 00:01:29.786
of the effect that they can have.

00:01:31.174 --> 00:01:34.610
If we admire a group status
or some other characteristic,

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:37.269
we are also more likely
to go along with them.

00:01:37.269 --> 00:01:38.917
And while this can be used to explain

00:01:38.917 --> 00:01:40.879
why children might be
more likely to go along

00:01:40.879 --> 00:01:43.573
with a popular group,
because they admire them

00:01:43.573 --> 00:01:46.208
or want to be like them,
it also explains why

00:01:46.208 --> 00:01:48.796
we're more likely to trust
the opinion of four doctors

00:01:48.796 --> 00:01:51.346
than four gardeners when it
comes to our health decisions.

00:01:52.628 --> 00:01:55.437
Group cohesion can also
have a strong influence

00:01:55.437 --> 00:01:56.941
on our likelihood to conform.

00:01:57.956 --> 00:02:00.232
If we have no connection or
feel no connection with the

00:02:00.232 --> 00:02:03.965
group, we feel less of a need
to go along with that group.

00:02:06.188 --> 00:02:07.755
Another factor is
whether or not we believe

00:02:07.755 --> 00:02:09.584
that our behavior is being observed.

00:02:10.727 --> 00:02:12.527
In a different variant
of the Asch line study,

00:02:12.527 --> 00:02:14.845
the participant was told
that because he came in late,

00:02:14.845 --> 00:02:17.561
he would record his
answers on a sheet of paper

00:02:17.561 --> 00:02:19.465
instead of saying them out loud.

00:02:19.465 --> 00:02:20.963
And because of this,
they're responses were

00:02:20.963 --> 00:02:22.762
not shared with the group,

00:02:22.762 --> 00:02:24.306
and when these participants were confident

00:02:24.306 --> 00:02:25.687
that their answers wouldn't be judged

00:02:25.687 --> 00:02:27.557
by the others in the room, they were

00:02:27.557 --> 00:02:29.548
much less likely to conform.

00:02:30.622 --> 00:02:34.139
Relatedly, how people believe
that the public will respond,

00:02:34.139 --> 00:02:35.806
also can have a large effect.

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:38.818
If we think that we'll be met
with the public's acceptance,

00:02:38.818 --> 00:02:40.635
we're happy not to conform,

00:02:41.046 --> 00:02:43.439
but when we think that
we'll be met with shunning,

00:02:43.439 --> 00:02:45.615
we are much more likely to
go along with the group.

00:02:46.944 --> 00:02:48.465
There are also a number
of internal factors

00:02:48.465 --> 00:02:50.828
that can influence how
likely we are to conform.

00:02:51.577 --> 00:02:53.736
One of those is prior commitments.

00:02:53.736 --> 00:02:55.605
If we state something upfront,

00:02:55.605 --> 00:02:58.049
then we're less likely to
go against it later on.

00:02:58.577 --> 00:03:00.458
So a prior commitment
to the group's message

00:03:00.458 --> 00:03:03.221
or direction, can serve
to increase conformity,

00:03:03.221 --> 00:03:05.520
but at the same time, a prior commitment

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:07.975
against it will decrease conformity.

00:03:10.117 --> 00:03:11.615
We're also more likely to conform when

00:03:11.615 --> 00:03:14.187
we feel or are made to feel insecure.

00:03:14.796 --> 00:03:16.015
It makes us feel less comfortable

00:03:16.015 --> 00:03:17.895
about our own knowledge, which

00:03:17.895 --> 00:03:19.196
increases the likelihood that we're

00:03:19.196 --> 00:03:21.408
going to follow the judgments of others.

00:03:23.788 --> 00:03:25.429
There are also a number of factors

00:03:25.429 --> 00:03:27.212
that can influence obedience.

00:03:27.624 --> 00:03:30.062
And to review, while
conformity can involve

00:03:30.062 --> 00:03:33.289
us changing how we think, obedience is

00:03:33.289 --> 00:03:35.844
the act of following
directions or instructions

00:03:35.844 --> 00:03:39.216
or orders without question
and without protesting them.

00:03:39.988 --> 00:03:41.462
And it's usually done in order to avoid

00:03:41.462 --> 00:03:44.638
negative consequences
associated with disobeying.

00:03:45.503 --> 00:03:47.069
And because of this, a lot of the factors

00:03:47.069 --> 00:03:49.588
that dictate whether or not we will obey

00:03:49.588 --> 00:03:52.578
depend on the type of authority
that is giving those orders.

00:03:54.209 --> 00:03:55.707
How close we are to the authority

00:03:55.707 --> 00:03:57.565
can have a strong influence.

00:03:57.565 --> 00:03:59.260
We are more likely to accept orders

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:02.110
from someone we know and respect
than someone who we don't.

00:04:03.508 --> 00:04:06.307
Interestingly enough,
actual physical closeness

00:04:06.307 --> 00:04:09.355
or physical proximity
can also influence it.

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:11.403
Participants in the Milgram study

00:04:11.403 --> 00:04:13.469
were much more likely to obey the commands

00:04:13.469 --> 00:04:15.966
of the experimenter
when they were standing

00:04:15.966 --> 00:04:18.066
right behind them, as compared to

00:04:18.066 --> 00:04:19.866
when they were standing
in the back of a room

00:04:19.866 --> 00:04:21.649
or standing in a different room.

00:04:22.502 --> 00:04:24.969
The legitimacy of the
authority also matters.

00:04:25.543 --> 00:04:27.180
People were more likely to obey commands

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:29.340
in the Milgram study when the experimenter

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:31.546
was wearing a lab coat
and carrying a clipboard,

00:04:31.546 --> 00:04:33.073
as compared to when they did not.

00:04:34.425 --> 00:04:36.944
Institutional authority also matters.

00:04:36.944 --> 00:04:39.817
Milgram's study took place at
a well-respected university.

00:04:40.125 --> 00:04:41.739
And you really don't expect such places

00:04:41.739 --> 00:04:43.475
to give you harmful commands.

00:04:44.281 --> 00:04:45.744
And while this institutional authority

00:04:45.744 --> 00:04:48.130
can be physical, it can also be symbolic.

00:04:48.518 --> 00:04:50.724
So the institution of the
police or the government

00:04:50.724 --> 00:04:52.890
also tends to bring about
a certain authority.

00:04:54.764 --> 00:04:57.150
Victim distance can also have an effect.

00:04:57.342 --> 00:04:58.885
In the original Milgram study,

00:04:58.885 --> 00:05:00.441
participants were in a different room

00:05:00.441 --> 00:05:02.287
than the learner or the victim.

00:05:02.287 --> 00:05:03.674
So they couldn't see him.

00:05:04.017 --> 00:05:05.480
When the study was repeated such that

00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:07.685
the participant had to physically pick up

00:05:07.685 --> 00:05:09.705
the learner's hand and
place it on the board

00:05:09.705 --> 00:05:11.087
that would electrocute them,

00:05:11.087 --> 00:05:12.678
it tended to reduce the likelihood that

00:05:12.678 --> 00:05:15.353
the participant would obey the
commands of the experimenter.

00:05:16.044 --> 00:05:18.076
But note that this didn't stop everyone.

00:05:18.076 --> 00:05:21.252
30% of the participants
still gave all of the shocks.

00:05:21.965 --> 00:05:25.064
This relates to the idea
of depersonalization,

00:05:25.064 --> 00:05:28.176
when the learner or victim
is made to seem less human,

00:05:28.176 --> 00:05:31.154
possibly through
stereotypes or prejudices,

00:05:31.415 --> 00:05:34.405
people are less likely to
object to acting against them.

00:05:35.897 --> 00:05:38.195
And similar to conformity,
obedience is also

00:05:38.195 --> 00:05:39.716
more likely to happen when there are

00:05:39.716 --> 00:05:41.695
no models of defiance.

00:05:42.421 --> 00:05:44.035
We're more likely to disobey orders

00:05:44.035 --> 00:05:45.875
when we see others doing the same.

00:05:48.574 --> 00:05:49.583
And one thing that you might be wondering

00:05:49.583 --> 00:05:52.103
after hearing all of
this is whether or not

00:05:52.103 --> 00:05:53.983
there is a certain type of person who is

00:05:53.983 --> 00:05:56.486
more likely to conform
or more likely to obey.

00:05:57.838 --> 00:05:59.696
And the answer seems to be no.

00:05:59.696 --> 00:06:01.960
There is no one personality
that leads people

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:04.485
to be more susceptible to
groups or to authority.

00:06:05.814 --> 00:06:07.718
That said, we do know that people's moods

00:06:07.718 --> 00:06:09.268
can have a strong effect.

00:06:09.703 --> 00:06:12.536
People who are having a
rough day are less likely

00:06:12.536 --> 00:06:14.968
to conform than those who
are having a good day.

00:06:16.855 --> 00:06:19.472
We also know that status
and culture can play a role.

00:06:20.221 --> 00:06:23.019
People of a lower social
or economic status,

00:06:23.019 --> 00:06:25.143
so those who don't have a lot of power

00:06:25.143 --> 00:06:27.720
socially or economically and politically,

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:29.903
or those who lack power in general,

00:06:29.903 --> 00:06:31.709
are more likely to conform.

00:06:32.574 --> 00:06:34.234
We also know that people
in individualistic

00:06:34.234 --> 00:06:36.939
cultures like the U.S. or western Europe

00:06:36.939 --> 00:06:40.155
that emphasize personal
achievement over group achievement,

00:06:40.155 --> 00:06:41.896
are less likely to conform than people

00:06:41.896 --> 00:06:44.299
in collectivist cultures, or cultures that

00:06:44.299 --> 00:06:47.155
emphasize the family or the
group over the individual

00:06:47.155 --> 00:06:48.903
like China or Korea.

00:06:49.651 --> 00:06:51.358
But even so, you need to keep in mind,

00:06:51.358 --> 00:06:53.760
that people in individualistic
cultures still conform

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:57.301
all the time by doing
things like going to school

00:06:57.301 --> 00:06:59.084
and eating cereal for breakfast.

00:07:00.216 --> 00:07:03.478
And taken together, all
of this helps to describe

00:07:03.478 --> 00:07:06.079
why perfectly ordinary
people can sometimes

00:07:06.079 --> 00:07:08.523
do very terrible things,

00:07:08.934 --> 00:07:10.653
but by being aware of these factors,

00:07:10.653 --> 00:07:12.725
we can also help to reduce them.

00:07:13.334 --> 00:07:15.018
I remember being really strongly affected

00:07:15.018 --> 00:07:18.337
by the idea that the presence
of just one nonconformer

00:07:18.337 --> 00:07:21.862
in a group could cause others
to not conform as well.

00:07:22.575 --> 00:07:24.793
It made me consider the
fact that by not conforming

00:07:24.793 --> 00:07:26.719
or not obeying myself, I could have

00:07:26.719 --> 00:07:28.752
a strong influence on others.

00:07:28.752 --> 00:07:31.347
And I find a lot of comfort
and strength in that idea.

00:07:32.130 --> 00:07:34.231
I can also take the
time to think about why

00:07:34.231 --> 00:07:37.244
I'm conforming to a group or
why I'm obeying an instruction.

00:07:37.737 --> 00:07:40.071
Knowing the ways in which
people can be influenced

00:07:40.071 --> 00:07:41.719
can give us more insight and possibly

00:07:41.719 --> 00:07:44.186
more control over these situations.
