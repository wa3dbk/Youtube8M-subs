00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.800
So, we'll start off here with the Hayes disc
brake. You can remove these pads when they're

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:10.820
on the bike, but it's a pretty simple process:
just stick a finger in there, pull the pad

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:21.390
out, and our pads are out. The Hayes brake
pads are actually different for each side.

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:25.800
It's hard to tell just looking at them, but
you can tell they're profiled a little bit

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:32.599
differently. You can see on the back, they've
got a little spring, and then a bore on them,

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:43.429
which sits over the piston and the brake.
Here's a Hayes brake piston. And what we see

00:00:43.429 --> 00:00:53.760
is that this is the wrong side for this pad
because the pad wants to line up with the

00:00:53.760 --> 00:01:00.019
piston. So I slide this one on, and you can
hear and see that it's a positive connection.

00:01:00.019 --> 00:01:07.800
So they are handed, left- and right-handed.
Depending on the type of the replacement disc

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:11.550
brake pad that you get for your Hayes brakes,
they may or may not come with these little

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:15.110
springs. So these little springs are like
gold; don't let them go flying across the

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:19.580
garage or lose them in the parking lot on
the trail because your brake pads aren't going

00:01:19.580 --> 00:01:24.200
to work without them. And sometimes you buy
replacement pads that don't come with them.

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:35.460
We're going to move on now to removing Avid
disc brake pads. I'm going to leave this one

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:45.190
on the wheel here, and it's a similar operation.
The inside pad here is actually bent, which

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:54.660
makes it easier to grab. I like to grab both
at the same time if I can. Tug on them. Going

00:01:54.660 --> 00:02:00.530
to grab the outside one and that's a little
bit rough to get out. So what I'm going to

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:06.320
do is I'm going to go to the toolbox and grab
some needle-nose pliers, and that's going

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:08.380
to make this operation a little bit simpler.
