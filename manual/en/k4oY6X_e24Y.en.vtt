Not only can you align a image in a single
line of text, but you can float it out in

00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:10.860
a paragraph, and the one way to do that is
to just place it in there and use alignment.

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:16.710
And so our paragraph, we have it set to align
left in our div tag, but I'm going to take

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:21.410
that out so I can show you how that has kind
of nothing to do with what we're doing. So

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:31.249
I'm going to take out these divs, and then
I'm going to insert an image within my paragraph;

00:00:31.249 --> 00:00:41.170
image source equals, and I have an image called
flower jpeg, and then after the image I'm

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:58.550
going to do align equals quotation marks left
and save, and then if we go over here and

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:08.960
preview it, it's not picking up the flower,
because I mistyped the name. You have to be

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:23.560
careful with code. So we'll go over here;
save, refresh. Flower don't you look good.

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:34.310
Let's compare that to our actual; see I had
misspelled it in the flower. There's the correct

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:40.180
file name, so we'll save that. Now we'll go
over and preview it, and it's staying up here

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:44.399
flush line with the text, but if we were to
just put an image within the paragraph this

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:50.049
is what happened, what would have happened
if we hadn't defined the alignment. So we'll

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:55.149
save that and refresh it over here, and now
it's doing the automatic thing where it lines

00:01:55.149 --> 00:02:00.030
up with the bottom of the text, and that just
doesn't look good, and so I really like it

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:00.409
when.
