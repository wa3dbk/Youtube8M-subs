Hey guys so today I will do 3 different Sophia
Smith hairstyles, so I hope you guys like them

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:08.470
and let´s get into the tutorial!

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:12.360
[Music is playing]

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:16.640
So the first step is to take your favorite
heat protection and spray it in all your hair,

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:18.769
because we dont want to damage it when we
curl it

00:00:18.769 --> 00:00:26.429

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:30.919
So now you are just going to take a section
of hair and curl it towards your face and

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:34.700
you are just going to do that on both sides
until all your hair is curled.

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:38.660
I´m just using my straightener to curl my
hair with, but if you dont know how to do

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:42.920
that or you find it easier to curl your hair
with a curling iron, then just go ahead and

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:43.980
do that instead.

00:00:43.980 --> 00:01:08.200

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:11.490
So when you have curled all your hair, you
are just going to run your fingers through

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:16.820
it or brush it through, just play with it
until you think it´s perfect. And if some

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.860
of the curls aren´t perfect you can always
just curl them again.

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:23.380

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:26.260
And this is the finished look of hairstyle
number 1

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:32.979

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:38.290
So for the next hairstyle you are just going
to do a high ponytail on the top of your head.

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:42.350
[Music is playing]

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:47.490
So now you are going to secure the ponytail
very losely and then pull it tight, that creates

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:51.409
a lot of volume, but if you dont think that
enough, you can always pull a little bit in

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:53.509
your hair to make more volume.

00:01:53.509 --> 00:02:00.400
[Music is playing]

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:04.439
And this is the finished look of hairstyle
number 2

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:09.810
[Music is playing]

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:14.530
So for the last hairstyle all you have to
do is to take a section of hair from the front

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:19.260
and pin it to the back of your head and when
you have done that, you are going to do the

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.200
exact same thing to the other side.

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:31.740
[Music is playing]

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:34.550
And this is the finished look of hairstyle
number 3.

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:39.640

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:44.180
