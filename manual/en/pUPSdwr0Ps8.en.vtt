BILLBOARD: “This episode brought to you
by Meow Mix Catstarter.

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:08.700
Things cats love, made by people who love
cats.”

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:14.460
---INTRO
HI I’M CATIE WAYNE AND THIS IS ANIMALIST

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:15.460
NEWS.

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:18.820
HAVE YOU EVER NOTICED THAT WHEN YOUR CATS
SLEEP THEY TWITCH THEIR PAWS OR EVEN CHATTER?

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:20.650
IT’S SO CUTE OH MY GOD.

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:23.250
WHAT’S EVEN CUTER IS THAT THEY HAVE TINY
LITTLE KITTY DREAMS!

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.090
JUST LIKE HUMANS, IMAGES OF PAST EVENTS REPLAY
IN A CAT’S MIND WHILE IT SLEEPS.

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.340
ALTHOUGH CATS HAVE A MUCH SMALLER BRAIN, THEIR
HIPPOCAMPUS - THE PART THAT RETAINS MEMORIES-

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:33.770
IS BELIEVED TO BE WIRED THE SAME AS A HUMAN’S.

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:37.470
IN ORDER TO TEST THIS THEORY, RESEARCHERS
AT M-I-T MONITORED THE BRAINS OF RATS.

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:41.260
THEY FOUND THAT A RAT’S BRAIN ACTIVITY WAS
IDENTICAL WHILE BOTH AWAKE AND ASLEEP, MEANING

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:43.040
THAT THEY DREAMED ABOUT THE DAY’S EVENTS.

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:47.820
SURE, RATS AND CATS ARE VERY DIFFERENT SPECIES,
HOWEVER, THIS STUDY LEADS RESEARCHERS TO BELIEVE

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:49.030
THAT ALL MAMMALS DREAM…

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:50.170
ESPECIALLY CATS!

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:53.120
I MEAN, HAVE YOU SEEN HOW MUCH THEY SLEEP?

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:57.120
THE AVERAGE HOUSECAT SLEEPS NEARLY FIFTEEN
HOURS A DAY AND SPENDS TEN PERCENT MORE TIME

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.310
DREAMING THAN HUMANS.

00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:03.030
PLUS RESEARCHERS BACK IN THE 1950’S AT THE
UNIVERSITY OF LYON, FRANCE, ACTIVATED CATS

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.820
MOTOR SKILLS DURING REM SLEEP.

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:09.240
WHILE SLEEPWALKING, CATS ACTED OUT PLAYING
WITH TOYS, POUNCED ON AND SWATTED AT IMAGINARY

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.240
PREY.

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:14.409
WHILE M-I-T SAYS THAT THOSE EXPERIMENTS DO
NOT DEMONSTRATE ACTUAL DREAMING, IT ONCE AGAIN

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:18.470
SUGGESTS THAT A BRAIN FUNCTIONS THE SAME WAY
DURING SLEEP AND WAKEFULNESS.

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:21.900
DREAMS ARE REALLY JUST THE BODY’S ATTEMPT
AT UNDERSTANDING INFORMATION BEING PROCESSED

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:23.840
IN THE BRAIN.

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.659
SO AS NEURONS ARE FIRING, THE BRAIN CONSTRUCTS
A STORYLINE TO FIT.

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:32.950
IN FACT, YOUNG ANIMALS MAY DREAM EIGHTY PERCENT
OF THE TIME WHILE ASLEEP BECAUSE THEY HAVE

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:35.549
SO MUCH NEW INFORMATION TO INTERPRET.

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.190
WHAT DO YOU THINK YOUR CAT IS DREAMING ABOUT?

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:38.940
LET ME KNOW IN THE COMMENTS BELOW.

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:40.799
MAYBE IT’S THE NEXT BIG CAT INVENTION!?

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:44.780
