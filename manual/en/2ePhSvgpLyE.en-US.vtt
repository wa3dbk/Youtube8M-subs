00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:07.359
Sometimes people think that emotion and art
are sort of sideshows to human intelligence

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:12.490
and the real essence of intelligence is thinking
logically.&nbsp; If that were true, computers

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:18.170
are already smarter than we are because they're
much better at logical thinking than we are.

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:24.950
It's actually things like being funny, being
sexy or expressing a loving sentiment; maybe

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:30.220
in a poem or in a musical piece.&nbsp; That's
the cutting edge of human intelligence.

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:37.030
It has to do with the hierarchy of the neocortex
and at the low levels things might seem cold

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:42.720
and mechanical because we're -- our neocortex
can recognize very simple objects and make

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:49.040
very simple decisions.&nbsp; At a high level,
it's dealing with concepts like the beauty

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:53.940
of a poem by Emily Dickinson or the ability
to create a poem like that.&nbsp; And we can come

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:59.860
back to creativity I believe it's an exercise
in metaphors and the neocortex is a metaphor

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:05.010
machine.&nbsp; That's what it's good at.&nbsp; That's
why humans are creative, but we have this

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:12.010
very large hierarchy where we have more and
more abstract and complex patterns.&nbsp; You

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:19.210
know, builds on patterns below it. And the
difference between humans and say other primates

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:23.669
is that we have more of the neocortex.&nbsp; We
have this big forehead that we can fit in

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:29.060
the frontal cortex and, therefore, have a
higher number of hierarchies - of levels of

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:34.760
the hierarchy.&nbsp; And that was an enabling
factor that permitted the evolution of language

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:40.270
and technology and art and science.
We are going to create synthetic neocortexes

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:47.270
based on the same principles.&nbsp; I'm actually
working on that.&nbsp; And we've had hierarchal

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:53.520
systems like that.&nbsp; I helped pioneer a concept
called Hierarchical Hidden Markov Models,

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:59.360
which is similar to what happens in the brain
but we only had a few levels. The brain has

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:04.650
a very large number of levels and all the
way from recognizing edges of objects up to

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:11.650
&amp;quot;she's beautiful&amp;quot; or creating a beautiful
painting or work of music, or scientific insight.

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:20.230
We will create artificial neocortex that have
a comparable number or a greater number, and

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:26.599
I think the principal application will actually
be to extend our own neocortex.&nbsp; We have

00:02:26.599 --> 00:02:33.599
300 million pattern recognizers in the neocortex
by my estimate. That hierarchy we build ourselves

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:38.900
each of these pattern recognizers capable
of connecting itself to other neocortexes,

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:45.030
to build its hierarchy. We build that hierarchy
from the moment we're born or before that.

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:51.950
We're constantly building it, but we run up
against this limitation of 300 million.

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:54.379
We'll be able to extend that and think in
the cloud.

00:02:54.379 --> 00:03:00.049
You know, if you do anything interesting with
this, do a search or a language translation,

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:05.190
or bring up a map or ask it a question.&nbsp;
It doesn't take place in the box.&nbsp; It goes

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:12.190
out to the cloud.&nbsp; We're going to put these
just really gateways.&nbsp; This is a gateway

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:17.620
to the cloud.&nbsp; We're going to put gateways
to the cloud in our brains and have more than

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:22.470
300 million, just like the cloud can give
you a thousand or a million computers for

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:29.470
a tenth of a second.&nbsp; You need another billion
pattern recognizers, you'll be able to access

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:37.120
that in the cloud.&nbsp; That's where we're headed
and we'll be more intelligent and able to

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:43.180
actually think in a greater number of hierarchies.
If you think that -- realize that the quantitative

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:50.180
improvement from primates to humans with the
big forehead to allow a larger neocortex was

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:56.839
an enabling factor for language art and music
and science.&nbsp; What kind of qualitative leap

00:03:56.840 --> 00:04:02.230
can we make with another quantitative increase?&nbsp;
And that's I think where we're headed.
