00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:07.360
Hello Food Tuber's. Today I have a stonkin little

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:10.370
recipe for you. It is my family traditional

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:13.959
Irish Seafood Chowder. It is totally
heartwarming, comforting,

00:00:13.959 --> 00:00:18.760
delicious. This soup was one of my
favorite recipes my mom used to make when I was

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:22.220
growing up. It is total comfort food, and it's a great family little dish. 

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:25.610
Very easy to make. So it starts off by
chopping up some onions to give us a

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:28.010
really great base flavour. 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:38.040
To start this off, I'm going to sweat down these onions with a good bit of 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.300
Irish salted butter. So get that straight
into a pot,

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:45.720
a nice bit hearty pot, this is a kind of soupy, stewy, chowdery thing so we want to give something

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:46.620
that's scrumptious and delicious, 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.739
delicious and comforting, and all that wonderful things. So onion goes straight in with all that wonderful

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:51.739
butter.

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:58.740
Just add a tiny touch of salt in there to bring out the moisture in the onions, and it will

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:02.450
give you a wonderful sweetness to those
onions. Really special and a great start

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:04.070
to the base of this soup.

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:09.440
Once that onion is nice and soft get in some smoked streaky bacon, 

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.860
and a little bit of thyme.

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:15.790
Now while that bacon is cooking out, I'm just going to chop up

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:20.230
some potatoes. So peel them up and chop them into a nice kind of fine dice.

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:26.420
Typically you're looking for waxy
potatoes or potato that's gonna hold its

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:28.520
shape when it cooks out in a chowder like this.

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.440
Now that I have all my potatoes beautifully chopped up, come right over here and check this

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:34.299
out because in the 

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:38.360
bottom of this pan lies the secret of a truly good chowder.

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.920
All those little brown bits that have caramelized at the base of

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.380
the pan that is where all the flavours
gonna come from. So make sure you get

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.780
that.

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:49.770
Once you have it, add in those potatoes straight in on top. Give them a little bit

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.869
of a stir, and come and get excited with all the other flavours that are in there.

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:56.530
Make them flavour friends. Give it a
quick stir and just toss.

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:01.440
At this point now, when you have
your potatoes covered in all that wonderful flavours,

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.310
and saltiness from the bacon, it's
time to cook out the potatoes. To do that,

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.649
I have about a litre of fish stock going in
here. If you don't want to use fish stock here you

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:09.959
can

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:13.119
of course use vegetable stock, and it's a
great little alternative. 

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.900
For an extra aromatic dimension add in a bay leaf.

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.110
Bring all that liquid up to the boil and
potatoes are now gonna cook

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:26.090
just until they're tender when you pierce them with a fork. So it's about twelve minutes or so.

00:02:28.989 --> 00:02:33.239
Whilst those potatoes are cooking away just grab a tiny touch of sea salt and black pepper

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:40.190
and season it up. To give wonderful richness to the soup, once the potatoes are

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:44.180
nice and cooked, add some cream in here and turn down the heat and just

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:49.830
trickle this through. It turns this very kind of simple little soup

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:54.620
into something rich and indulgent. Now the fish I'm using today, and it's totally up to you

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:55.810
what you use

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:59.629
I'm using some smoked un-dyed haddock, and it really adds some

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:02.860
great intense smoky flavour to your chowder.

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:05.890
I've also got some cod and some salmon, but it's really up to you

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:10.670
whatever fish you want to use in here. So I'm going to start off by adding in my mussels.

00:03:13.390 --> 00:03:15.880
Give them a quick stir through and then just

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:19.780
over-the-top get all that wonderful fish in there as well.

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.600
At this point now, once the fish is in
there don't be tempted to stir it around

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:26.050
too much.

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:31.430
Just get them in straight on and let it cook for a few minutes. Just until the fish is nice and firm.

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:39.040
My fish has had it's time to cook and
now it's time

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:42.590
for the big seafood chowder reveal. So bring it over,

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:44.110
open it up,

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:46.930
look at that! Steamy, fishy goodness!

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:49.860
You've gotta try this recipe. This is a
real

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:52.920
real winner and now I can't resit but to jump in there,

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:57.560
and taste it, because it has the most
beautiful smoky smell wafting around the 

00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:58.340
kitchen right now.

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:02.660
And it totally delivers.

00:04:02.670 --> 00:04:05.940
Creamy, salty, sweet and really rich.

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:10.030
I want you to give this a go, but if you
