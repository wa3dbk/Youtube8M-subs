to do some pasta dish

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:09.070
but we don't want to do the noodles
because of the gluten

00:00:09.070 --> 00:00:12.940
and it's refine car because carter
dancer fast

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:15.579
so you can do spaghetti squash

00:00:15.579 --> 00:00:18.619
or if you can try this incredibly simple

00:00:18.619 --> 00:00:20.929

00:00:25.929 --> 00:00:27.140
all you do it

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:29.800
as you get a couples who can you get
some sauce

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:32.419
uh... make sure you get this often it's
not

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:36.240
with a look at yours so i have one prime
granted your cop

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:13.330
chesta

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:20.490
