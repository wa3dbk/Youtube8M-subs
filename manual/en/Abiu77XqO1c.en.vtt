Narrator:
Welcome to the West Wing Week,
your guide to everything that's

00:00:03.333 --> 00:00:05.800
happening at 1600
Pennsylvania Avenue.

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:08.667
This week, President Obama
focused on the second part of

00:00:08.667 --> 00:00:11.567
his State of the Union goals of
out-innovating, out-building,

00:00:11.567 --> 00:00:13.400
and out-educating the
rest of the world,

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.433
putting forward plans to build
a 21st Century infrastructure,

00:00:16.433 --> 00:00:18.633
investing in things
like high-speed rail,

00:00:18.633 --> 00:00:21.934
and expanding broadband access
so all of America's families

00:00:21.934 --> 00:00:24.133
will be equipped
to win the future.

00:00:24.133 --> 00:00:26.467
Oh, and the Prime Minister
of Canada dropped by.

00:00:26.467 --> 00:00:28.400
That's February 4th
through February 10th,

00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:33.767
or "The New Electrification."

00:00:33.767 --> 00:00:36.667
On Friday, February 4th,
President Obama welcomed Prime

00:00:36.667 --> 00:00:39.467
Minister Harper of Canada to the
White House to strengthen the

00:00:39.467 --> 00:00:41.533
partnership between our nations
and to provide the prime

00:00:41.533 --> 00:00:43.133
minister with some
warmer weather.

00:00:43.133 --> 00:00:45.033
Speaker:
I'm from Ohio, so actually --

00:00:45.033 --> 00:00:46.066
Prime Minister Harper:
That's unreasonably cold.

00:00:46.066 --> 00:00:46.967
Speaker:
I know.

00:00:46.967 --> 00:00:49.266
Narrator:
The two leaders talked about
the vital economic partnership

00:00:49.266 --> 00:00:52.000
we share and agreed to a new
vision for managing our shared

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.200
security, not just on the border
we share, but beyond the border.

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:57.934
The President also took the
opportunity to address the

00:00:57.934 --> 00:00:59.433
situation in Egypt.

00:00:59.433 --> 00:01:01.433
President Obama:
We want to see this
moment of turmoil turned

00:01:01.433 --> 00:01:03.867
into a moment of opportunity.

00:01:03.867 --> 00:01:06.867
The entire world is watching.

00:01:06.867 --> 00:01:10.166
What we hope for and what we
will work for is a future where

00:01:10.166 --> 00:01:14.000
all of Egyptian society
seizes that opportunity.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.834
Narrator:
On a beautiful and
temperate Monday morning,

00:01:15.834 --> 00:01:16.667
February 7th --

00:01:16.667 --> 00:01:18.533
President Obama:
What a spectacular thing.

00:01:18.533 --> 00:01:21.100
Narrator:
The President, accompanied by
Senior Advisor Valerie Jarrett

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.734
and Chief of Staff Bill Daley,
crossed Lafayette Park to

00:01:23.734 --> 00:01:26.333
address the Chamber of Commerce
on what the government is doing

00:01:26.333 --> 00:01:28.934
to make America the best place
in the world to do business and

00:01:28.934 --> 00:01:32.200
the responsibility the business
community has to invest in

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.533
America's workers and
economic recovery.

00:01:34.533 --> 00:01:38.600
President Obama:
But as we work with you to make
America a better place to do

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:43.433
business, I'm hoping that all
of you are thinking what you

00:01:43.433 --> 00:01:46.667
can do for America.

00:01:46.667 --> 00:01:52.033
Ask yourselves what you can do
to hire more American workers,

00:01:52.033 --> 00:01:54.633
what you can do to support the
American economy and invest in

00:01:54.633 --> 00:01:56.400
this nation.

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:57.467
Narrator:
Back at the White House --

00:01:57.467 --> 00:01:58.200
President Obama:
Coach?

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.800
Narrator:
-- President Obama called Green
Bay Packers' Coach Mike McCarthy

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.734
to congratulate him on
the Packers' victory in

00:02:02.734 --> 00:02:04.100
Super Bowl XLV (45).

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.200
President Obama:
Even for a Bears fan, it's
heartwarming, you know,

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.767
that the Green Bay community
is able to celebrate like this.

00:02:11.767 --> 00:02:14.800
So, you guys, you should be
very proud of yourselves.

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.133
I'm looking forward
to hosting you.

00:02:17.133 --> 00:02:20.000
Narrator:
On Tuesday, February 8th,
Vice President Joe Biden and

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Secretary of Transportation Ray
LaHood hopped aboard the Amtrak

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.233
Acela heading to Philadelphia to
announce the administration's

00:02:27.233 --> 00:02:29.233
plan to build a 21st Century
infrastructure from roads and

00:02:29.233 --> 00:02:31.133
bridges to high-speed rail.

00:02:31.133 --> 00:02:34.600
Vice President Biden:
I went to school -- this is a
place called Claymont, Delaware,

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:37.066
and it became a steel town.

00:02:37.066 --> 00:02:39.400
Narrator:
Famous for his daily commutes
from Delaware to D.C. when he

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:41.600
was a senator, the Vice
President knows just about

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:43.133
every mile of these tracks.

00:02:43.133 --> 00:02:45.467
At 30th Street
Station in Philly,

00:02:45.467 --> 00:02:47.400
the two laid out the
comprehensive plan that will

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:50.734
help the nation reach President
Obama's goal of giving 80% of

00:02:50.734 --> 00:02:53.734
Americans access to high-speed
rail within 25 years,

00:02:53.734 --> 00:02:56.066
as outlined in his State
of the Union Address.

00:02:56.066 --> 00:02:59.300
Vice President Biden:
In a global economy, we can't
forget that infrastructure,

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:03.867
and also are the veins and
the arteries of commerce,

00:03:03.867 --> 00:03:05.233
you think about
it in those terms;

00:03:05.233 --> 00:03:11.266
they literally are the veins
and the arteries of commerce.

00:03:11.266 --> 00:03:13.800
You know, if those
passageways get clogged,

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.734
commerce is going to suffer,
and it's going to show up in

00:03:15.734 --> 00:03:19.767
the bottom line, and it
shows up really quickly.

00:03:19.767 --> 00:03:22.934
Narrator:
By clarifying the long-term
federal role in passenger rail,

00:03:22.934 --> 00:03:25.266
this six-year program will
provide states and cities with

00:03:25.266 --> 00:03:28.734
the certainty they need to make
long-term transportation plans

00:03:28.734 --> 00:03:30.734
for their communities.

00:03:30.734 --> 00:03:33.800
On Wednesday, February 9th, we
caught up with Aneesh Chopra,

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:35.800
the Federal Chief
Technology Officer,

00:03:35.800 --> 00:03:38.200
who explained some of the nuts
and bolts of expanding broadband

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:41.100
access and how crucial it will
be to economic development in

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:42.200
rural America.

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.900
Aneesh Chopra:
And it's not just about
roadways, railways, and runways,

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:47.467
President Obama believes
in a nation's 21st Century

00:03:47.467 --> 00:03:51.133
infrastructure that must include
connectivity to every corner of

00:03:51.133 --> 00:03:53.667
the country so that people that
live in rural parts of the

00:03:53.667 --> 00:03:55.800
country have access to
global markets just as

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:58.467
they would if they lived in
urban environments that have

00:03:58.467 --> 00:04:00.600
access to technology today.

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:02.266
This is a challenge
we faced before in

00:04:02.266 --> 00:04:05.967
our country with electrification.

00:04:05.967 --> 00:04:08.967
Our cities were lit up far
before our rural communities

00:04:08.967 --> 00:04:11.934
were, and it was a priority
administration back then to

00:04:11.934 --> 00:04:14.533
make sure the entire country
had access to this critical

00:04:14.533 --> 00:04:17.200
infrastructure as it is today.

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:20.066
It is in that spirit, in a
collaboration with the private

00:04:20.066 --> 00:04:22.867
sector, that President Obama
wishes to extend high speed

00:04:22.867 --> 00:04:26.700
wireless access to 98% of the
nation's population so that an

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:29.667
entrepreneur in rural America
can tap into global markets and

00:04:29.667 --> 00:04:32.433
compete in this 21st
century economy.

00:04:32.433 --> 00:04:35.367
Narrator:
On Thursday, February 10th,
President Obama traveled to

00:04:35.367 --> 00:04:38.200
Marquette, Michigan, located
in the snowy upper peninsula

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:40.567
of that state, where local
businesses have been able

00:04:40.567 --> 00:04:43.300
to grow as a result of
greater broadband access.

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:45.233
The President went to see a
demonstration of how Northern

00:04:45.233 --> 00:04:48.467
Michigan University's WiMAX
Wireless Network has enabled

00:04:48.467 --> 00:04:51.133
distance learning for university
and community students.

00:04:51.133 --> 00:04:54.400
President Obama:
What is so exciting is
the fact that, you know,

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:58.934
talented young people like the
kids in your class or the ones

00:04:58.934 --> 00:05:04.867
in Negaunee, you guys can
basically start a company

00:05:04.867 --> 00:05:08.834
or do your work anywhere.

00:05:08.834 --> 00:05:11.233
Narrator:
The next generation wireless
network in Marquette is an

00:05:11.233 --> 00:05:14.133
effective demonstration of how
the President's proposal to open

00:05:14.133 --> 00:05:16.800
up airwaves will
spark new innovation,

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:18.900
put people back to
work, grow the economy,

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:20.467
and help America win the future.

00:05:20.467 --> 00:05:22.567
President Obama:
When it comes to
High-Speed Internet,

00:05:22.567 --> 00:05:27.934
the lights are still off in
one-third of our households.

00:05:27.934 --> 00:05:31.133
One out of every three
households in America

00:05:31.133 --> 00:05:34.333
don't have that same access.

00:05:34.333 --> 00:05:39.667
For millions of Americans, the
railway hasn't showed up yet.

00:05:39.667 --> 00:05:41.800
And for our families
and our businesses,

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:45.367
high-speed wireless service,
that's the next train station.

00:05:45.367 --> 00:05:47.266
It's the next off-ramp.

00:05:47.266 --> 00:05:50.133
It's how it will spark new
innovation, new investment,

00:05:50.133 --> 00:05:51.533
new jobs.

00:05:51.533 --> 00:05:53.834
Narrator:
The President also got a
chance to stop by Donkers,

00:05:53.834 --> 00:05:56.333
a local candy shop
and lunch spot.

00:05:56.333 --> 00:05:59.066
President Obama:
The Obama Burger seems like a --

00:05:59.066 --> 00:06:01.100
Speaker:
Our chef did his research.

00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:04.200
President Obama:
Nice. Yeah, that looks --
that's a tasty looking burger.

00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:06.400
Narrator:

events, go to whitehouse.gov.

00:06:09.667 --> 00:06:12.467
And thanks again for checking
out your West Wing Week.

00:06:12.467 --> 00:06:15.000
Vice President Biden:
Well, I can tell you -- Chuck
will tell you -- my mother used

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.033
to say, if it looks like
a duck, walks like a duck,

00:06:18.033 --> 00:06:20.433
and quacks like a
duck, it's a duck.

00:06:20.433 --> 00:06:21.734
This is a duck right here.
