00:00:02.568 --> 00:00:04.170
Dear me, first and foremost,

00:00:04.203 --> 00:00:05.538
please get some sleep.

00:00:05.571 --> 00:00:08.241
You are the only one
responsible

00:00:08.274 --> 00:00:09.475
for your own happiness.

00:00:09.508 --> 00:00:11.744
Stop trying so hard
to please your parents.

00:00:11.777 --> 00:00:14.881
Stop trying so hard to be
someone you're not.

00:00:14.914 --> 00:00:17.150
Just be yourself
and love yourself.

00:00:17.183 --> 00:00:19.152
And stop trying to get people
to like you.

00:00:19.185 --> 00:00:20.386
Don't try to fit in.

00:00:20.419 --> 00:00:21.654
You were born to stick out.

00:00:21.687 --> 00:00:23.956
Don't cut your hair just
because you have lice.

00:00:23.989 --> 00:00:27.693
It's okay to experiment,
but be mindful.

00:00:27.726 --> 00:00:30.630
Be confident, because that's
really one of the only things

00:00:30.663 --> 00:00:32.432
that people actually notice.

00:00:32.465 --> 00:00:33.800
Ignore them.

00:00:33.833 --> 00:00:35.501
Those are #DearMe videos,

00:00:35.534 --> 00:00:38.304
where grownups give advice
to their teenage selves,

00:00:38.337 --> 00:00:39.505
because they don't understand

00:00:39.538 --> 00:00:41.908
how the space-time continuum
works.

00:00:41.941 --> 00:00:43.876
What is this,<i> The Lake House?</i>

00:00:43.909 --> 00:00:45.078
Check the mailbox;

00:00:45.111 --> 00:00:48.181
see if there's any letters
from the future.

00:00:48.214 --> 00:00:49.582
They asked me to participate,

00:00:49.615 --> 00:00:53.119
and since kids love stupid
inspirational crap, I agreed.

00:00:53.152 --> 00:00:55.288
But, apparently,
they edited me out.

00:00:55.321 --> 00:00:56.622
[laughs]

00:00:56.655 --> 00:00:59.592
Lucky for you,
I went back in time

00:00:59.625 --> 00:01:01.628
and got my hands
on an earlier version.

00:01:03.395 --> 00:01:07.066
Dear me, look how awesome
your life turns out.

00:01:07.099 --> 00:01:08.568
Screw saving money.

00:01:08.601 --> 00:01:10.236
Just keep doing you, buddy.

00:01:10.269 --> 00:01:12.572
Junior high, it can be
a rough place.

00:01:12.605 --> 00:01:14.073
Don't get too attached
to Devin.

00:01:14.106 --> 00:01:17.543
He will die in a gruesome
car accident real soon.

00:01:17.576 --> 00:01:20.179
A lot of the friends you thought
were your friends, they're not.

00:01:20.212 --> 00:01:23.149
Do not sweat
any pregnancy scares.

00:01:23.182 --> 00:01:24.250
I don't know how you do it,

00:01:24.283 --> 00:01:25.718
but you dodge bullets, baby.

00:01:25.751 --> 00:01:27.019
When you recover
from anorex--

00:01:27.052 --> 00:01:28.154
When you're in Dallas,

00:01:28.187 --> 00:01:30.022
stay away from a dessert
called the Pizookie,

00:01:30.055 --> 00:01:31.457
unless you feel
like telling a story

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:33.159
about [bleep] your pants
in a hotel lobby

00:01:33.192 --> 00:01:34.260
for the rest of your life.

00:01:34.293 --> 00:01:36.562
Having your period
is the worst thing in--

00:01:36.595 --> 00:01:38.331
Basically,
from the age of 18 on,

00:01:38.364 --> 00:01:40.433
I need you to keep toilet paper,
wet naps,

00:01:40.466 --> 00:01:41.434
a full change of clothes,

00:01:41.467 --> 00:01:42.835
and shoes in the car.

00:01:42.868 --> 00:01:44.737
You do survive--

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:46.873
Find a kid named Mark Zuckerberg

00:01:46.906 --> 00:01:48.608
and murder him.

00:01:48.641 --> 00:01:50.943
You will be doing the world
a huge favor.

00:01:50.976 --> 00:01:53.179
And also tell your family
about any pain--

00:01:53.212 --> 00:01:54.514
All right, one day, the Dolphins

00:01:54.547 --> 00:01:56.215
are gonna have to decide
between Drew Brees

00:01:56.248 --> 00:01:57.550
and Daunte Culpepper.

00:01:57.583 --> 00:01:59.152
I'm gonna need you
to convince them

00:01:59.185 --> 00:02:00.486
his shoulder will be fine

00:02:00.519 --> 00:02:01.954
and they should go with
Drew Brees.

00:02:01.987 --> 00:02:04.690
God, you had
such a big crush on--

00:02:04.723 --> 00:02:06.759
If a certain ballerina
catches your eye

00:02:06.792 --> 00:02:09.328
during a performance of
<i> Swan Lake,</i> trust me.

00:02:09.361 --> 00:02:10.997
Do not go backstage to meet her.

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:13.366
That's a life sentence
you will quietly regret

00:02:13.399 --> 00:02:14.734
until death do you part.

00:02:14.767 --> 00:02:16.636
So save yourself the drama

00:02:16.669 --> 00:02:19.071
and a lot of time
and just go to the--

00:02:19.104 --> 00:02:20.072
<i> Snowpiercer.</i>

00:02:20.105 --> 00:02:22.508
I cannot stress this enough.

00:02:22.541 --> 00:02:24.977
Do not watch that movie.

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:26.412
It is horrible.

00:02:26.445 --> 00:02:27.747
If you're 13 right now,

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.148
you're going to have
a pretty difficult--

00:02:29.181 --> 00:02:31.017
You're gonna be in New York
in 2001

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:32.852
just killing it on Letterman.

00:02:32.885 --> 00:02:33.986
Congrats.

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:35.988
I need you to stick around
an extra week

00:02:36.021 --> 00:02:38.791
and see if you can stop
a little something called 9/11.

00:02:38.824 --> 00:02:39.792
Good luck.

00:02:39.825 --> 00:02:41.661
You push the people that--

00:02:41.694 --> 00:02:43.563
Just focus on the clitty.

00:02:43.596 --> 00:02:45.865
I remember
not feeling black--

00:02:45.898 --> 00:02:48.467
Y2K is real.

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:50.636
You will need months
of clean water, all right?

00:02:50.669 --> 00:02:52.705
A secure bunker,
heavy artillery.

00:02:52.738 --> 00:02:53.940
Trust no one.

00:02:53.973 --> 00:02:55.408
The first kill is gonna be
difficult,

00:02:55.441 --> 00:02:57.510
but just keep shooting.

00:02:57.543 --> 00:03:01.214
If that helps one dirtbag
teenager in Titusville, Florida,

00:03:01.247 --> 00:03:02.647
then it was worth it.
