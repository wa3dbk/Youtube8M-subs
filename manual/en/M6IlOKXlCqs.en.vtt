00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:03.699
The Comprehensive Dilated Eye Exam:

00:00:03.699 --> 00:00:08.170
Opening the Door to Preventing Blindness

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:12.510
During a comprehensive dilated eye exam,
the patient receives special

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:15.690
eye drops that dilate the pupils.

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:21.820
The pupils open wide allowing the doctor
to see the back of the eye clearly.

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:25.790
With a better view of the back of the
eye, the doctor can look for signs of

00:00:25.790 --> 00:00:29.430
the common eye diseases that can lead to
blindness:

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:36.430
glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy and
age-related macular degeneration.

00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:36.989
 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:42.620
When eyes are dilated, the doctor can
clearly see the retina,

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:45.130
optic nerve

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:48.750
and the macula.

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.489
This is the optic nerve.

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:56.100
The doctor is looking for early signs of
glaucoma.

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.820
This patient's optic nerve is healthy,

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:04.580
but here's what it would look like if it
showed signs of glaucoma.

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:05.880
The doctor will see changes

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.890
in the shape or color of the optic
nerve.

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:15.930
The doctor may also see what is called
cupping of the optic disk.

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:20.920
Glaucoma is most common in African Americans over the age of 40; 

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:27.740
people over 60, and in people with a
family history of glaucoma.

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:31.840
In addition to the optic nerve, the doctor can also clearly see the retina

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.159
at the back of the eye.

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:40.260
The doctor might see signs of diabetic
retinopathy.

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.830
Early diabetic retinopathy starts with
small red dots

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:48.390
called micro aneurysms and can progress
to leaking blood vessels 

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.630
causing thickening of the retina and
blurring of vision or new blood vessel

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:53.950
growth that can bleed

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:58.030
and cause blindness.

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:04.080
If you have diabetes, you are at risk for diabetic retinopathy.

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.980
While still examining the retina, the doctor
can also look for signs of

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:13.620
age-related macular degeneration or AMD.

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:18.620
If this patient had AMD, the doctor would
see yellow spots beneath the retina

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:20.670
called drusen

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:22.880
or dark clumps of pigment.

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.630
AMD is the main cause of visual
impairment and blindness in older

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:29.730
americans.

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:33.520
Dilation enables doctors to get a better
view of the back of the eye

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:38.590
which allows them to determine whether
there are early symptoms of disease.

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:41.600
But it's important to know that all
people older than 60

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:45.420
need a comprehensive dilated eye exam
each year

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.970
and should inform their doctor right
away if they begin to have problems with

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:50.239
their sight.

00:02:50.239 --> 00:02:54.879
People at higher risk may need to have a
dilated eye exam more often.

00:02:54.879 --> 00:02:57.849
Risk factors including race, age

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:02.370
and family history are all important to
determine how often patients should

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:06.130
receive a comprehensive dilated eye exam.

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:10.530
