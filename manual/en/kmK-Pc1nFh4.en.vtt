This is John Kohler with growingyourgreens.com.

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:04.980
Today we have another irrigation episode.

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.250
I seem to get many questions on irrigation.

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:13.019
I covered some irrigation stuff in my other
two shows, one about converting a standard

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:19.350
faucet spigot or hose bib to basically using
an inline timer using a battery.

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:25.800
Then I had another episode regarding using
your basically lawn sprinkler time to use

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.500
for drip irrigation and that's what I'm doing
here in the front yard.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:32.509
I didn't get into the third part that I never
had actually edited and put up.

00:00:32.509 --> 00:00:36.219
I actually had some good new information that
I'm going to share with you today and show

00:00:36.219 --> 00:00:41.350
you actually work in progress that we're doing
to finish the irrigation here.&nbsp;

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:45.829
So basically the front yard we have the timer
on the wall over there.

00:00:45.829 --> 00:00:49.860
It's basically the standard sprinkler irrigation
timer.

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:54.629
We basically converted over, instead of this
coming up with the sprinklers now we unscrewed

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:57.890
the sprinklers and basically converted it
over the PVC pipe.

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:01.079
We come up in each bed with a PVC tube.

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.870
So it's basically, it comes out of the ground
as 3/4 inch.

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:08.880
We then did then adapt it to a half inch because
a half inch ball values are much less expensive

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:14.560
than the 3/4 inch ball values and then we're
going into basically a half inch drip pipe

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.910
anyways, so we got to convert it over to half
inch at some point anyways.&nbsp;

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:20.260
So we come out, this is the 3/4 pipe.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:26.490
We convert it over into half inch, we go into
a ball value, this allows us to control the

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:27.710
flow of water.

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:33.030
So this does restrict the flow, so you could
put the pressure really high to spray a lot

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.020
of water or a little bit or cut it off if
we don't want it being watered.

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.930
In this case it has been cut off because this
was a new bed, it was getting rained on for

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:47.130
the watering in the winter time, but now we're
into spring it's raining less and we're going

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:48.770
to replant this bed.

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.710
This is what's left of the bok choy bed and
we've been harvesting those.

00:01:52.710 --> 00:02:00.290
I had a nice bok choy salad last night with
orange nut dressing and that was quite delicious.

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:04.560
So this is how it comes out and we're going
to show you once it comes out of this, basically

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:07.790
these are half inch fittings, a half inch
ball value, it'll only go into a half inch

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:14.660
T and then we basically go into these half,
these inserts that basically convert the PVC

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:18.560
over to accept the drip hose tubing.

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:21.760
So that's this bed here, lets go to the next
bed here where we're actually installing the

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.140
drip tubing and we'll show you more about
that.&nbsp;

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:28.520
Now we're going to install out of the upright
here, we're going to install the drip hosing.

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:30.210
So it's very easy.

00:02:30.210 --> 00:02:34.260
What we do is we basically take the drip tube
here and then when we convert it and we go

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.260
down to the soil level, this is an extra step.

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:42.040
You could probably save about, I don't know,
a dollar fifty, about two dollars in parts

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:45.240
if you didn't want to go back down to the
soil level.

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:49.550
You can just run the hose out and it'll be
high for a little while and then go down.

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:54.290
But to be flexible and have the optimal use
of the space and like if it went down we would

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:57.100
just come straight out and then we wouldn't
be able to adjust our row.

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:00.600
But with this, we could put this and adjust
a row in the soil.

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.410
So if we put this in here our row could be
over here, or we could move our row over to

00:03:04.410 --> 00:03:05.650
this side.&nbsp;

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:09.099
So basically it's really easy, just want to
take this drip hose and we have a little section

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:11.100
of drip hose about that long.

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:17.170
We're just going to put it in here like this
and wiggle it back and forth until it's tight.

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:23.170
That's how easy it is to put the drip hose
in there into the quick-fit connectors.

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:25.849
So now our drip system is all set up in this
bed.&nbsp;

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:29.160
So now we've laid out all the drip pipe in
this small bed.

00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:34.300
We basically have three rows, so we're running
the drip pipe in three rows that are going

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:37.040
to correspond with where we're going to plant.

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:44.060
This is the last connection we have to do,
at each, every corner we have these joints.

00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:49.849
You just basically push the hose into the
joint, basically you just take it like this

00:03:49.849 --> 00:03:51.209
and just literally just push them in.

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:55.300
You got to kind of wiggle back and forth as
you're pushing the hose in.

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:58.980
It'll just kind of get inserted and it's just
basically just pressed to fit, that's how

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:00.170
tight it works.

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:03.349
The other thing I highly recommend is you
get some stakes, so if you could use some

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:09.670
old wire, but they make these galvanized stakes
here to secure your hose because this hose

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:10.920
does come in a spool.

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:18.299
When it does come in a spool it gets basically
contorted to the shape of the spool.

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:23.470
I recommend when you dry your drip hose definitely
buy the longer spool and check the cost per

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:24.470
foot.

00:04:24.470 --> 00:04:28.410
Sometimes it's cheaper to by the five hundred
foot spool but sometimes it's cheaper to buy

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:30.470
two, four hundred foot spools depending on
the price.

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:35.060
So you're going to use a lot of it, you could
calculate in each bed, some of the fifteen

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:39.400
foot beds I have up to six lines going up
and down that bed.

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:41.190
So definitely buy a lot of drip tube.

00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:42.190
It's relatively inexpensive.

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:45.280
A hundred feet runs about ten bucks but then
if you go up to five hundred feet I think

00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:47.530
it's around forty buck or so.

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:52.690
Or I think my friend got recently two hundred
feet for about twelve to fifteen dollars.

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:56.220
So buy a lot, you're going to need it.

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:59.750
I think I bought, this roll was a thousand
feet actually.&nbsp;

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:02.260
So now we're going to talk about the different
sizes of drip tubing.

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:11.000
The two standard sizes of drip tubing are
basically .700 OD or outside diameter and

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.490
.0620 OD or outside diameter.

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:18.020
Each drip tubing is a little bit different
size.

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:25.610
So if this is the .700 OD and that's known
as the 5/8ths and this is the .6200 known

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:28.850
as a half inch.

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:29.900
They're not interchangeable.

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:34.110
So they're two different, completely different
sizes and you can tell by the fittings on

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:41.840
here, the end fittings on the half inch are
.620 is green on the ends, and then the .700

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:43.000
is black on the end.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:48.300
So I think we had it one time where we had
most of my stuff was made with the half inch

00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:53.540
OD and then I started buying the 5/8ths inch
OD and then it wouldn't be compatible.

00:05:53.540 --> 00:06:01.300
So you can get connectors that have a .620
or half inch OD and then a .700 or 5/8ths

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:06.139
inch OD to basically join between the two
different sized connectors.

00:06:06.139 --> 00:06:10.490
In a pinch I have actually taken the 5/8 inch
and pinched it down and really shoved it into

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:13.830
the .620 but I don't recommend doing that.

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:14.830
Get the right connectors.

00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:20.670
Overall I would recommend getting the .700
OD, all things remaining equal, that's going

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:24.090
to flow a little bit more water, but get water
you have available.&nbsp;

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:25.560
Why do I use drip irrigation?

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:29.380
Well drip irrigation, probably the number
one reason why I use drip irrigation is because

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:31.920
I love to travel so much.

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:35.800
When you travel or when you have a busy job
or when you're away from your home and you

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:39.190
forget to water at night because you're too
tired after you get home from work or actually

00:06:39.190 --> 00:06:44.550
you're not even at home, the drip irrigation
is all on a timer, it's going to water basically

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:47.550
whenever you want it to water and you don't
have to water.

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:50.639
So it takes a lot of the labor out of watering
your plants.

00:06:50.639 --> 00:06:54.470
I have friends that come out, come home from
work every day and they water their plants.

00:06:54.470 --> 00:06:58.699
But they could, if they had a drip system
installed they would not have to worry about

00:06:58.699 --> 00:07:04.430
that task and they could have basically a
drip timer and a system do that and take care

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:05.430
of all that for them.

00:07:05.430 --> 00:07:08.199
So save them time and they could go on and
do other things.&nbsp;

00:07:08.199 --> 00:07:12.460
The other reason for a drip system is because
specifically is because it waters at the base

00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:13.910
of the plant.

00:07:13.910 --> 00:07:18.340
Instead of overhead watering, which may people
have overhead watering, that wastes water,

00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:23.031
it waters a whole area which not only waters
the plant, not only gets the leaves wet, but

00:07:23.031 --> 00:07:28.550
it also waters all the ground around the plant,
which may basically, you're watering the weeds

00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:30.690
or the seeds that may come up between the
plants.

00:07:30.690 --> 00:07:35.160
So also watering each plant could deter weeds,
which guess what, in the long run it's also

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:38.919
going save you labor because now you're not,
you may not pulling weeds because you're only

00:07:38.919 --> 00:07:40.340
watering at the plant.&nbsp;

00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:41.470
So I'm going to get back to work.

00:07:41.470 --> 00:07:44.320
This is John Koher with growingyourgreens.com.

00:07:44.320 --> 00:07:46.040
Keep on irrigating!

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:48.370
It'll save you time and money in the long
run.
