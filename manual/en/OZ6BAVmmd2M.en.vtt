00:00:02.941 --> 00:00:07.626
(bouncy electric music)

00:00:16.321 --> 00:00:19.277
- Today, we're making my family favorite,

00:00:19.277 --> 00:00:22.479
barbecued, glazed chicken
tenders and oven fries.

00:00:22.479 --> 00:00:23.932
The best part of this meal

00:00:23.932 --> 00:00:25.697
is that it's really quick and easy.

00:00:25.697 --> 00:00:28.353
This will only take about
20 minutes to prepare

00:00:28.353 --> 00:00:30.201
and 25 minutes to cook,

00:00:30.201 --> 00:00:32.011
and dinner, is served.

00:00:32.011 --> 00:00:35.216
The first thing to do is
preheat the over to 400 degrees.

00:00:35.216 --> 00:00:37.316
Mine is already heating up.

00:00:37.316 --> 00:00:40.705
I've already scrubbed our
three potatoes, cleaned,

00:00:40.705 --> 00:00:43.541
and started cutting them into fries.

00:00:43.541 --> 00:00:45.490
Potatoes just need a little bit of rubbing

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:47.938
under cold water to
remove any of the dirt.

00:00:47.938 --> 00:00:50.656
I left the skin on mine
because I like the flavor,

00:00:50.656 --> 00:00:53.639
but you could always peel
the skin off if you don't.

00:00:53.639 --> 00:00:56.448
I'm going to cut the
potatoes to one-eighth inch

00:00:56.448 --> 00:00:59.549
to one quarter inch strips,
whichever you choose.

00:00:59.549 --> 00:01:01.454
We just want them to be even in size

00:01:01.454 --> 00:01:04.050
so they cook through at the same time.

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:06.074
I'm just going to cut the potato in half,

00:01:06.074 --> 00:01:07.408
and then you're gonna take that half

00:01:07.408 --> 00:01:09.277
and put it down on the cutting board,

00:01:09.277 --> 00:01:11.749
and then cut vertically

00:01:13.129 --> 00:01:15.486
into thin strips.

00:01:15.486 --> 00:01:17.681
And then because we're
wanting these to be skinny,

00:01:17.681 --> 00:01:22.347
you take those slices and
then cut again vertical wise.

00:01:22.347 --> 00:01:27.347
I'm now gonna spray our baking
sheet with non-stick spray.

00:01:27.643 --> 00:01:29.580
Now we're gonna put them on to the sheet.

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:33.276
We want to make sure
that they don't overlap.

00:01:34.395 --> 00:01:36.081
All right.

00:01:36.081 --> 00:01:38.415
We'll set that aside and
now get ready to make

00:01:38.415 --> 00:01:40.574
the seasoning mix for the fries.

00:01:40.574 --> 00:01:41.748
In a small bowl,

00:01:41.748 --> 00:01:46.171
I'm gonna combine one-half
teaspoon of garlic powder,

00:01:46.171 --> 00:01:49.454
one-half teaspoon paprika,

00:01:49.454 --> 00:01:52.590
and about a eighth teaspoon of pepper.

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:58.349
Now, you just sprinkle
those on top of the fries.

00:01:58.349 --> 00:02:00.243
All right, so now we can just put them

00:02:00.243 --> 00:02:02.970
in the oven for 25 minutes.

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:04.107
Now the chicken.

00:02:04.107 --> 00:02:06.555
I've got one pound of
boneless, skinless chicken

00:02:06.555 --> 00:02:08.357
tender loins that I've trimmed off

00:02:08.357 --> 00:02:11.155
the excess fat using my kitchen scissors.

00:02:11.155 --> 00:02:12.651
To cook the chicken

00:02:12.651 --> 00:02:15.898
I'll spray the skillet with cooking spray

00:02:17.608 --> 00:02:20.325
and then we're gonna turn
up the heat to medium high.

00:02:20.325 --> 00:02:21.487
We're gonna add the chicken

00:02:21.487 --> 00:02:24.366
and cook each side for about four minutes

00:02:24.366 --> 00:02:26.757
or until it's no longer pink.

00:02:27.987 --> 00:02:31.485
All right. These are ready
to flip to the other side.

00:02:33.955 --> 00:02:36.985
You know, this really is
a family favorite of mine.

00:02:36.985 --> 00:02:39.492
My girls already like chicken tenders

00:02:39.492 --> 00:02:42.907
but by simply adding the
barbecue marmalade on top

00:02:42.907 --> 00:02:45.135
it makes it so great.

00:02:45.135 --> 00:02:48.360
They love the sweetness and flavor of it.

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:49.605
I think these are about done

00:02:49.605 --> 00:02:51.404
so I just want to cut it open a bit

00:02:51.404 --> 00:02:53.609
to make sure that it's not pink inside.

00:02:53.609 --> 00:02:56.988
You can use just a simple
knife and fork to do this.

00:02:56.988 --> 00:02:58.412
Perfect.

00:02:59.612 --> 00:03:02.514
I'm going to quickly mix up
the glaze for the chicken.

00:03:02.514 --> 00:03:06.449
Just combine one-half cup barbecue sauce.

00:03:06.449 --> 00:03:10.203
This has the lowest sodium I could find.

00:03:10.203 --> 00:03:12.501
You're also wanna add a half a cup of

00:03:12.501 --> 00:03:15.354
no sugar added orange marmalade.

00:03:15.354 --> 00:03:19.084
You can also use grape
jelly or jam for this

00:03:19.084 --> 00:03:21.964
but I'm feeling orange today.

00:03:21.964 --> 00:03:24.785
Mix this together.

00:03:24.785 --> 00:03:27.223
Now we're just gonna cover this

00:03:27.223 --> 00:03:29.116
and then put it into the microwave

00:03:29.116 --> 00:03:32.157
at 60% power for 40 seconds.

00:03:32.157 --> 00:03:33.793
To make sure we time this meal

00:03:33.793 --> 00:03:35.522
so that it's all ready at the same time,

00:03:35.522 --> 00:03:37.101
we can put that in the microwave

00:03:37.101 --> 00:03:40.089
with just two minutes
or so left on the fries.

00:03:41.889 --> 00:03:43.617
And once the glaze is warmed,

00:03:43.617 --> 00:03:46.054
go ahead and spread it on the chicken.

00:03:46.054 --> 00:03:47.817
That's all you need to do.

00:03:47.817 --> 00:03:49.837
Simple, easy, healthy.

00:03:49.837 --> 00:03:52.236
That's the way I like it.
