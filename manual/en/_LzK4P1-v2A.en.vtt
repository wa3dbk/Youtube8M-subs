If you have suffered a VERY serious injury
or the death of someone you love, you may

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:09.710
not want to watch this. Not because of the
graphics but that it could be emotionally

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:15.290
disturbing. However, because your loss is
so important and because what lawyer you choose

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:20.670
is so very important, you need to know exactly
how your case and loss will be handled by

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:28.089
Gordon and Elias, L.L.P. There are other videos
that are available on this page that are not

00:00:28.089 --> 00:00:32.900
as emotionally charged. If you have suffered
a very serious injury or the death of someone

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:38.149
you love, you may not want to watch this.
Not because of the graphics but that it could

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:46.360
be emotionally disturbing. However, because
your loss is so important and because what

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:49.410
lawyer you choose is so very important, you
need to know exactly how your case and loss

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.570
will be handled by Gordon and Elias LLP. There
are other videos that are available on this

The following reenactment happens everyday

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:06.240
somewhere in the United States. Mom, thank
you so much. Everything was just delicious.

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:21.130
You know, you really have to come more often.
It has been too long, hasn't it? So, are you

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:22.130
ready to go? Yeah, we really should be hitting
the road. Oh, so soon? Yeah, she's got a ballet

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:24.640
lesson, so my little ballerina. Yeah. Watch
the truck! Being involved in a truck accident

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:31.290
is a serious and life-changing event. My name
is Steve Gordon and I'm with the law firm

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:39.950
of Gordon and Elias. If in your accident there
was a serious injury or death, you will need

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:46.070
competent legal representation. You will need
experienced truck accident lawyers to represent

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:53.200
you. One aspect of truck accident representation
is getting the person the right medical care

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:59.440
that they need. Depending upon the injury
is depending upon what type of medical expert

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:05.490
you need to treat you. At Gordon and Elias,
we make sure that this occurs. If in your

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:14.580
accident a spouse has been killed, the grieving
process will take years and years to get over.

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:20.170
The additional problem is the economic hardship
that is created in the short term that is

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:26.220
while your case is pending, and then of course
in the long term after your case is resolved.

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:32.190
At Gordon and Elias, we are keenly aware of
these problems and we deal with them with

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:38.220
you. When you come to Gordon and Elias, we
will literally get to know you personally

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:44.310
and your family personally. The process of
litigation takes time and in that process

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:51.030
we literally become friends, not just your
lawyers. So anticipate with Gordon and Elias

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:56.380
not just getting good representation, but
actually getting almost an extension of your

00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:03.810
family. Not every case goes to trial but some
cases do. At Gordon and Elias there is 40

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:10.540
years of combined trial experience available
to you. The best experts are utilized, the

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:18.020
best doctors and the case is presented using
the best electronic means and sometimes just

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:24.810
a good old fashioned poster board will do.
The point is that the trial will be presented

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:31.940
in a way that is most professional but really
brought down to where the juror understands

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:38.430
the grief, the pain, the sadness that you've
experienced. Because at the end, they're going

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:43.270
to be asked to award monetary damages. And
we donâ€™t want them to be shy when they do

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:52.240
that. We wish you had not gone through what
you had to go through in order to end up contacting

00:03:52.240 --> 00:04:00.569
us, but you have. And the law allows in every
state you to recover money. That's what we

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:08.610
do. And we want to get you the most money
possible. So in the end, when all is said

00:04:08.610 --> 00:04:16.659
and done, you can take that money and go and
live your life the best you can, even if somebody's

00:04:16.659 --> 00:04:22.199
no longer in your life. They would have wanted
that for you. So you need to hire lawyers

00:04:22.199 --> 00:04:27.429
that are going to do just that. And at Gordon
and Elias, we pledge to you to do that. Gordon
