00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.660
While we’re waiting around for a giant earthquake
to rip California from the rest of the United

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:08.980
States, we thought we’d take a look at what
the US would lose without TestTube Daily’s

00:00:08.980 --> 00:00:10.370
home state of California.

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:12.790
So, just how powerful is California?

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:17.410
Well, for starters, California is the US’s
most populous state, and is home to one in

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:20.670
eight Americans with a population of nearly
40 million.

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.580
In fact, more people live in California than
in all of Canada!

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:27.500
That huge population brings in a ton of income.

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:34.120
Alone, California generates more than 2 trillion
dollars in GDP, about 12% of the US’s total

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:35.180
GDP.

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:39.230
The state’s economy ranks around the 8th
or 9th largest in the world.

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:44.230
That’s about the same amount of money generated
by global superpowers like Russia and Italy.

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:47.730
California’s robust economy isn’t an accident.

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:51.910
The state hosts some of the biggest companies
in the world, including, Apple, Disney, Google,

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:52.910
and others.

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:58.660
California is also one of the top agricultural
producers in the US, churning out more fruits,

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:01.820
vegetables, wines, and nuts than any other
state.

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:06.500
But the bulk of their farming cash comes from
grapes, cotton, oranges, and maybe unsurprisingly,

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:07.610
marijuana.

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:13.320
California grows nearly 40% of America’s
weed, some 8.5 million pounds a year.And let’s

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.310
not forget, California has the single most
successful film industry in the world, responsible

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:21.189
for some half a trillion dollars a year.

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:25.380
Clearly, if California broke off from the
US, they’d be pretty well off as the Weed,

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:27.890
Wine, and Walnut capital of America.

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:32.240
But what are they gonna do if some country
wants a piece of that California sunshine?

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:33.590
Can California defend itself?

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:37.229
Well, between the California National Guard,
and State Military Reserve, they’ve got

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:40.590
about 25,000 ground, air, and sea troops.

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:44.630
That’s roughly on par with Denmark in terms
of active troop levels, which is not much.

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:49.609
Plus, with some of the strictest gun control
laws in the country, the idea of a local militia

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:51.890
uprising is unlikely.

00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:55.899
All in all, California could be one of the
greatest and most powerful nation-states in

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:56.899
the world.

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:00.880
But despite its high yield status, California
has the highest tax rate in the country, is

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.320
suffering from the worst drought in a millennium,
and holds nearly half a trillion dollars in

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:06.320
debt.

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:10.750
California also suffers from an influx of
illegal immigration, with roughly 2.5 million

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:13.670
out of a total 11.2 million, country-wide.

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.820
Clearly California isn’t as self sufficient
as it would need to be for this whole “breaking

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:20.040
off the continent” pipe dream to work out.

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:24.170
Still, without it, the US wouldn’t have
Hollywood or In-n-Out Burger.

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:25.940
So how powerful is California?

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:26.940
HELLA POWERFUL.

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:40.280
