PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Finally,
we're launching a $100 million

00:00:02.665 --> 00:00:06.360
dollar competition for innovative
ideas to train and employ people

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:09.790
who are underrepresented in tech.

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:10.700
At a time when--

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:11.590
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:15.770
--at a time when we
all lead digital lives,

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:18.720
anybody who has the drive and
the will to get into this field

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.680
should have a way to do
so, a pathway to do so.

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:25.200
So my administration is
committed to this initiative.

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:29.300
We've got a lot of private and
nonprofit sectors leading the way.

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:32.920
We want to get more on
board, but ultimately success

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.400
is going to rest on folks
like you-- on mayors,

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.750
council members, local leaders--
because you've got the power

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:41.410
to bring your communities
together and seize

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:44.390
this incredible economic
development opportunity that

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:46.740
could change the way
we think about training

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:48.340
and hiring the workers of tomorrow.

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:57.760
And the good news is these workers may
emerge from the unlikeliest places.

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:02.410
So let me wrap up with just
the example of one person,

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:05.244
a woman named LaShana Lewis.

00:01:05.244 --> 00:01:05.910
Where's LaShana?

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:07.246
She's here today.

00:01:07.246 --> 00:01:09.570
I hear she was here.

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:11.244
There she is over there.

00:01:11.244 --> 00:01:11.910
There's LaShana.

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:17.186
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:17.186 --> 00:01:21.340
Now, the reason LaShana's
story is so relevant

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:26.120
is-- LaShana grew up
in east Saint Louis.

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:35.190
She had a passion for computers, but
because of circumstances, constraints--

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:39.840
she wasn't born with a
silver spoon in her mouth--

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.145
she wasn't able to get a college degree.

00:01:42.145 --> 00:01:44.020
And because she didn't
have a college degree,

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:52.480
she couldn't even get an interview for
a tech job despite her coding skills.

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:58.000
So she was working as a bus driver and
she was working in entry level jobs.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.840
But LaShana, apparently, is a
stubborn person which is good.

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:04.423
Sometimes you need to be stubborn.

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:14.480
So she refused to give up on her
dream, and she used her free time

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:18.680
to teach herself new computer skills.

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.570
And she started going
to a coding meet-up that

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:25.817
was run by LaunchCode which
is a non-for-profit that

00:02:25.817 --> 00:02:28.650
finds talented people across Saint
Louis and gives them the training

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.120
and credibility for
the tech jobs employers

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.490
are desperately needing
to fill as we speak.

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:38.410
So LaShana had the skills.

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:42.700
LaunchCode went to bat for her.

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.010
And today she's a system
engineer at MasterCard.

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:49.461
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:59.880
Now, LaShana, it's a great story,
but understand this-- MasterCard

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.670
wants to hire more folks like LaShana.

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:10.480
Moreover, 40% of LaunchCode's
first class came in unemployed.

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:14.230
90% of its graduates
were hired full-time

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:23.600
with an average starting
salary of $50,000 a year.

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:29.280
So that's what's already happening,
but it's happening at a small scale.

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:33.120
And what we need to do is expand it.
