Hi, I'm Jake Jorgenson, once again. I'm going
to be showing you how to tune your bass drum.

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:11.760
And this bass drum, after so much use - a
bass drum, you don't have to tune as often

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:19.249
as, for example, a snare or a tom-tom drum,
But you want to make sure that if you want

00:00:19.249 --> 00:00:24.880
to change it, you're doing it pretty - you're
doing it the right way. And pretty much, what

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:31.550
you're going to be doing is - a lot of it
is not - this is just really by ear and just

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:38.500
tightness-wise, of how tight you want your
drum. You can loosen, and you want to be making

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:45.430
sure that your lugs, just that it supports
it. The wonderful thing about bass drum is

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:50.991
it doesn't have to be perfectly on. It can
be totally off. I mean, I can have these lugs

00:00:50.991 --> 00:00:57.250
down here totally off and these ones tightened
all the way. As you can see, I don't even

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:01.600
have these tightened all the way. It really
doesn't affect the sound all that much on

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:06.939
a bass drum because it's just so big. But
a lot of it is just depending on how you want

00:01:06.939 --> 00:01:12.460
yours. For more like a jazz, you kind of want
a - you don't use too much bass drum. You

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:17.509
just kind of "feather the bass drum," is what
they say, just kind of boom-boom-boom. You

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:23.759
don't really - it's supposed to be felt, not
heard, and so to do that, you make sure that

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:28.609
your front head - this is the front where
your actual beater of your - where you actually

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:34.840
hit, you want to make sure this is tightened
looser than this. And it doesn't have to be

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:40.530
perfect tone-wise, it just needs to be a little
bit tighter than this. That's for jazz; they

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:49.299
use that. For rock or for kind of heavy metal,
for what I usually use, I actually make this

00:01:49.299 --> 00:01:55.810
head the head. I make it looser than this.
This makes it so it's a little more damp,

00:01:55.810 --> 00:02:02.020
a little more kind of watery kind of sound,
just kind of a dut-dut-dut. Because I also

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:07.990
have a, if you can see over here, I've got
double bass. And you want to be able to distinguish

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:13.090
a double bass sound from just one sound. You
want that to be real dut-dut-dut-dut-dut-dut

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:20.011
instead of a bom-bom-bom-bom-bom - really
meshed togheter. You want really sharp and

00:02:20.011 --> 00:02:20.599
noticeable.
