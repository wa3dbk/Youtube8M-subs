00:00:01.569 --> 00:00:07.240
The City of Carlsbad set aside valuable open
space as part of its award winning habitat

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:10.700
management plan to protect the local environment.&nbsp;

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:16.020
The Rancho La Costa Habitat Conservation Area
is managed by the Center for National Lands

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.100
Management.&nbsp;

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.400
This is an area that we call Denk Mountain.

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:23.320
It’s part of our Rancho La Costa Habitat
Conservation Area.

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:28.020
It’s actually a 1400 acre preserve that
runs from El Camino Real all the way out to

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:33.940
Elfin Forest - a really large piece of land
probably the size of about Balboa Park.

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:38.030
This open space preserve was set aside in
about 2002.

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:42.050
This area was primarily set aside for the
Coastal California Gnatcatcher, which we have

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:44.430
10 or 15 pair every year.

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:51.350
But it also is a wildlife corridor that connects
Escondido and Elfin Forest out to Carlsbad

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:56.899
and we have a wildlife undercrossing and we
tend to have a lot of deer, bobcat and coyote

00:00:56.899 --> 00:00:59.650
that are very common here.

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:03.620
We look at seasonal patterns and we look for
different species.

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:07.570
Some of these animals you can tell which ones
they are each time they go through so you

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:12.490
know if it’s the same animal or a different
animal.

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:16.829
Our primary job really is to keep an eye on
the preseve and we get a lot of users.

00:01:16.829 --> 00:01:23.750
It has 6 or 7 miles of trail so we spend a
lot of time maintaining trails, talking to

00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:24.750
our users.

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.130
We have a mixed user group of horseback riders,
mountain bike riders, joggers.

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.030
What’s really neat about this area is a
lot of the history.

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:40.060
First, a big portion of it is part of a Spanish
land grant from many many years ago and the

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.170
vegetation and the habitat has hardly ever
been disturbed.

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:47.049
The one thing that we had on this mountain
were mine shafts.

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:49.000
They used to mine copper.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.880
I think this is an amazing asset to Carlsbad
and the quality of life.

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:59.191
There’s so many people that are into fitness,
in addition, for all the folks that enjoy

00:01:59.191 --> 00:02:01.340
outdoors and wildlife.

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:02.789
You get a huge sample here.

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:08.230
It’s such a big open space and the trails
meander right into the hillside and fit real

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:10.160
well into the ecosystem.

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.720
And on any given day you can have a really
enjoyable hike or bike.

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:19.120
