00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:02.140
Hi! I'm Noah

00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:04.120
and today we will be talking about pets!

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:05.600
oh my gosh...

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:11.100
and apparently this is my first ever TV commercial

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:12.463
*Dinosaur chicken noises*

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:16.320
there once was 2 dogs named Barney and...and Ed

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.260
they both, they both had a friendship

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:21.140
it would never end

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:21.940
apparently! apparently!

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:25.140
but he didn't like any of the food

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:28.280
and it made his farts stink allll day and night

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:30.300
i'm tryin to touch my toes

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:33.540
I like ca...I like dogs better

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:35.880
because they like to lick your face

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:36.960
*dog sounds*

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:40.220
well first you're going to have to train them to be a good boy

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:42.760
and second, you're going to have to play fetch...

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:43.952
FETCH!

00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:45.160
helfy dog food (whispers)

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.420
well apparently Freshpet food is the best food than ordinary dog food 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:52.640
he wants to eat it every night, every day

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:53.760
*dinosaur chicken sounds*

00:00:54.077 --> 00:00:56.077
apparently, now that's some good food!

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:59.720
by the way, you can keep on playing some TNT on that one 

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:03.260
but don't blow it up until you have something captured in there

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:08.040
this is the greatest pet food!

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:09.220
for a pet!

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:11.620
and I also keep my dog's food in the fridge

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:12.420

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:16.480
