bjbj Drive smart and you could save on your
insurance The Co-operative Insurance Did you

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:10.080
know that having a smartbox installed in your
car could reduce your car insurance premiums?

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.230
Everyone likes careful drivers and having
a box installed means you can see just how

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:16.080
safely you drive.

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:21.750
This could mean that you make savings on your
car insurance if you drive safely, but premiums

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.860
could also increase if you demonstrate poor
driving behaviour.

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:31.330
Installation of a smartbox is done by a professional
engineer and takes only a few minutes.

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:35.960
They can come to you and install the smart
box at a time and location to suit you.

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:41.860
So, if you are at home, at work or even at
your friends, as long as it is safe to do

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:45.190
so, the engineer will quickly and simply install
your smart box.

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:51.000
You do not need to be present while the box
is installed and the box does not affect you

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.570
car s warranty.

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:57.120
When the engineer visits to fit your Smartbox,
you need to make sure you have the right documents

00:00:57.120 --> 00:00:58.160
ready to show the engineer.

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:03.750
You ll need both the paper and photo card
part of the driving licence, for both the

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.549
policyholder and any named drivers.

00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:11.060
You ll need any proof of no claims discount
from your previous insurer (if this applies

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:16.900
to you) and the V5 vehicle registration document,
or the section 10 new keeper supplement.

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:23.310
We can t fit a Smartbox without the engineer
seeing your documents so please ensure you

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:24.930

available 24/7 on your online dashboard, accessed

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.550

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:38.990
By checking speed, breaking, acceleration
and time of day reports you can improve your

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:43.479
safe driving score every day, helping you
to lower your premiums.

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:48.350
But please be aware that your premiums could
increase if you demonstrate poor driving behaviour.

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:53.930

on the road safely and with a smart box you

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:57.340
could help improve your own safe driving and
be rewarded with savings.
