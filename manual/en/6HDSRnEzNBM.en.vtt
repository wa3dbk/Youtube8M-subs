00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:06.700
Hobby Mom: This is Saw Mill from Chuck and
Friends, Play-Doh Diggin' Rigs, we're going

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:10.400
to open them up and he has friends to help.

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:13.881
"Hey everybody, come with me to work today.

00:00:13.881 --> 00:00:17.560
I'm going to show you how I build a wall at
the construction site.

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:21.260
Here we are, this is my job, this is where
I work."

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:22.330
"Wow, that's pretty cool."

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:25.900
"This is the machine I use to make logs.

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:33.050
I'm going to pack in my big dirt boulder,
squish it in there, push this handle down

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:36.649
and out comes my triangle log.

00:00:36.649 --> 00:00:38.429
Wow.

00:00:38.429 --> 00:00:44.210
Now Mater is going to help me cut the log
with my saw mill."

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:50.510
"Hey, hey, I can't see anything.

00:00:50.510 --> 00:00:53.389
Oh, that's better."

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:58.619
"Now I'm going to move the log and begin to
build a wall along with the cushion cones

00:00:58.619 --> 00:01:01.170
so nobody gets hurt.

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.759
Oh good, here comes Buster with my steel frame."

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:09.840
"Here you go."

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.880
"Thanks Buster Boss for your help.

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.210
I'm just going to put this on over here and
help build my wall."

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:21.750
"Hey, I want to keep helping too, so I just
... What do I do?

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:27.680
Just take this brick and put it over here
somewhere, is that what I do?"

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:29.840
"Oh, I'm just going to do that anyway."

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.270
"Hey guys, champ, champ, I'm here with my
claw.

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:38.130
I'm here to pick up some bricks and move them
for you.

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:43.479
This brick looks like it needs moving, I'll
just pick that up, put that there."

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:47.310
"Um, yeah, that didn't need to be moved, but
thanks anyways.

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:53.090
I have a piece of tar that I need to squish
down before we throw it away in the trash.

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:55.520
Let me just pack it down real good here.

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.770
Squish, squish, squish, squish.

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:01.830
Oh no, I rolled over my safety cone.

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:03.810
Oh man."

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.149
"Hey Cool, are we squishing stuff?

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:09.819
Look I can do that too.

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:13.459
I'm pretty sure this is more fun than tractor
tipping."

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:16.510
"Hey it's me Buster, I'm back.

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:18.970
Do you need me to pound anything for you?

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:21.739
Oh, looks like you already did that on your
own.

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:23.500
You squished that cone pretty good."

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.790
"Hey guys, I'm Rowdy.

00:02:25.790 --> 00:02:27.819
Do you need any garbage taken out?"

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:31.430
"I sure do.

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:34.120
This old piece of tire needs to be taken to
the dump.

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:35.970
Thanks for your help Rowdy."

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:38.700
"Ooh, can I see what's in there?"

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.489
"Oh, hey wait, I want to see what's in there
too?

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:47.170
All this uses steel bar and looking it ... wow,
look at all that trash.

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:49.050
Oh no, I fell in."

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:50.290
"You look funny."

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:54.270
"It isn't not funny to me."

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:58.180
"Are you ready to go for a ride Mater?"

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.750
"Hey, hey.

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:04.790
Oh wait, this is kind of cool.

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:06.500
Way better than tractor tipping."
