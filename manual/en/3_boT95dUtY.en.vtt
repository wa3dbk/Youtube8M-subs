00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:10.270
Busy Lamp Field

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:10.960
is a feature

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:12.470
that allows monitoring the working

00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:16.170
status of other extensions or trunks

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.900
through pre-configured indicators of an IP phone.

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:22.030
MyPBX now allows BLF to subscribe the state of PSTN and GSM trunk.

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:26.490
A solid green BLF indicator

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:31.750
means the extension or the trunk is free.

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:36.960
A solid red indicator says busy.

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.400
A flashing red indicator tells you the extension or the trunk is ringing.

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:45.980
The feature needs both IP phone and MyPBX to support.

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:46.800
As an illustration,

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:50.700
we use IP phone of extension 500 to monitor

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.390
extension 501 and trunk pstn1.

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.580
Log in the Web interface of the IP phone.

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:04.340
Extension 500 is registered on Line 1 of the IP phone.

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:08.090
Click "Phone"

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:11.710
and "DSS Keys".

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:14.409
Use DSS Key 1 to monitor extension 501.

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:18.360
 

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.790
In the pull down list of Type,

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:26.790
choose BLF.

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.000
Fill in 501 in the value field.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.170
Choose the line that extension 500 is registered to for Line.

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:41.250
 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.689
In the field of Extension, enter the feature code of call pickup

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:47.700
and the extension number,

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:51.650
i.e. asterisk 04501.

00:01:51.650 --> 00:01:55.740
Next, we use DSS Key 2 to monitor trunk pstn1.

00:01:55.740 --> 00:02:02.090
In type, also select BLF,

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:09.090
the "Value" is the name of the trunk that is to be monitored.

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:14.560
Choose Line 1

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:21.080
and leave the extension field blank.

00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:25.780
Save the settings.

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:30.220
From the BLF indicators of extension 500, we can see that

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:34.010
when extension 501 is free,

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:40.409
the DSS Key 1 indicator is green,

00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:47.239
when 501 rings, the indicator blinks red,

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:52.879
and when 501 picks up, the indicator shows solid red.

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:57.310
In addition, when 501 rings, we can press the DSS Key 1

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:04.310
to pick up the call.

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.760
When the call is picked up, the indicator turns green,

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:14.360
meaning 501 is idle.

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:18.569
Monitoring trunks is almost the same as monitoring extensions, except that there is no call pickup function

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:19.340
but the monitored trunk can be directly picked.

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:24.050
If pstn1 is free,

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:30.020
and when we press DSS Key 2, we will have dial tone.

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:34.110
In this case, extension 500 can directly calls out through this trunk

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:37.460
without matching any outbound routes.

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:42.650
Note that this method only works for PSTN trunk but not GSM trunk.
