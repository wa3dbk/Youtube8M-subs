00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:06.680
In this segment, we're going to cover draining
the radiator. Prior to draining the coolant

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:12.960
out, first thing we need to do is remove the
cap. If the system is under pressure, when

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:16.400
you push down on this cap to release it, in
order to turn the cap, it's got a lock system

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:21.440
on it. You have to push down and twist simultaneously.
When you push down, if you hear a venting

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:27.650
of pressure, that means your system is still
under pressure. Hold it down for a few seconds

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:32.050
until you hear that sound stop. What it's
doing is removing any pressure and equalizing

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:36.320
the pressure between the radiator and the
over flow tank. In other words, just removing

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.620
the pressure from the radiator and bringing
it back down to atmospheric pressure. After

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.629
you hear the sound stop, twist and just twist
it all the way around until you can remove

00:00:45.629 --> 00:00:50.399
it and it will lift straight off. At this
time, inspect your cap. What your looking

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:53.850
for is, look at these rubber seals are on
there. There's two of them. One's at the bottom

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:58.559
and one sits up on the inside of the cap.
This is a pressure release valve seal here.

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:04.479
What your looking for is any indication that
dry rot cracks, splits or damage to the rubber.

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:10.010
Also inspect the inside one for the same situation.
Your looking for dry rot cracks, splits or

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:14.800
any damage that would prevent it from sealing.
Then you squeeze in on the spring and see

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:19.890
if the diaphragm assembly moves and everything.
That's not going to tell you if its building

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.590
the pressure correctly but it will tell you
that it is moving. If anything there doesn't

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:29.610
work as directed that will indicate that you
need to replace your cap. It's a good idea

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:35.130
to replace the cap when your replacing the
radiator. It's a good preventive maintenance.

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:40.610
Now that we have the cap off, we want to place
the drain pan underneath. On your petcock,

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:44.530
you see a rubber hose connected to it, a clear
rubber hose, and that's going to down through

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:49.310
a hole in your lower splash pan and you want
your drain pan to be located underneath that

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:53.850
hose. Then, just go ahead and twist the petcock
open. You should be able to do it with your

00:01:53.850 --> 00:02:04.020
fingers. Go ahead and open up the petcock
and allow the coolant to drain out into the

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:10.489
pan. At this time we want to wait until all
the coolant is drained out of the system before

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:15.480
we go on to our next step. Please watch our
next segment. We'll cover disconnecting the

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:18.150
transmission cooler lines and drain the transmission
cooler.
