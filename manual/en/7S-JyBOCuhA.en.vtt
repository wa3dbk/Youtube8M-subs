00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:08.660
My Playstation 3 has two displays connected
- a flat panel TV and 3D helmet.

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:15.380
Both of them are 720p, however, the TV can
receive up to 1080i, while the glasses can

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:17.330
process 1080p.

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:21.130
The problem is the game console doesn't allow
to enable 3D mode in custom

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:25.800
video settings, and in automatic mode it sets
up the best possible resolution

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.640
which is 1080p for the 3D glasses, and the
TV cannot process this signal and

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.230
goes to black screen.

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:34.500
In the end, each time I want to switch between
the

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.520
glasses and the TV I have to put on the glasses,
browse through the menu,

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.829
lower the resolution (which automatically
disables 3D) and only then turn

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:43.829
on the TV.

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:47.590
I fail to understand the need to first upscale
and then downscale

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:54.399
in the first place, as according to HDMI 1.4
specifications 3D games are 720p,

00:00:54.399 --> 00:00:58.530
which is the native resolution for both my
TV and the 3D-helmet.

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.571
Anyway, having to switch the options looses
time and a lot of nerves, so

00:01:02.571 --> 00:01:06.830
I decided to put an end to Sony's firmware
thinking it is smarter than the

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:07.830
user.

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:22.560
To do that, first enable QA flag, browse debug
settings for 3D and switch it

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.360
from automatic to On.

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.790
Now, making sure your current display is the
inferior one, which is the flat panel

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:40.610
in my case, go to Video Settings, then HDMI
and select Automatic settings.

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:45.360
Agree to whatever resolution it detects as
best, which is 1080i in my case,

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.270
and then go to the next screen.

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:48.420
It's a miracle!

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:52.700
It asks you to setup 3D
output for a TV that actually doesn't support

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:53.700
3D.

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:58.680
Select the appropriate
screen size, which is 150 inch in my case

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:00.180
and finish the setup.

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.750
It's done.

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:04.570
Now I don't have to browse through options
whenever I need to switch

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:06.100
output to another display.
