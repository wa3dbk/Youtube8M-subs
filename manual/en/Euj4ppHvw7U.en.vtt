00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.780
History has repeatedly demonstrated, that tsar Alexander III was right and Russia has only two allies - the army and the navy

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:14.480
But have been visiting Balkan Peninsula you understood that  to these two things  we can add, the Serbs

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:22.680
This nation, so dear to us, has been surrounded by hostile states for a very long time

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:25.920
Perhaps that's why Serbs see us with such affection

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.540
because we had protected them from encroachments from the East and from the West time after time

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:31.500
and they remember it.

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:40.440
Thus, the monument of the Emperor Nikolay II was erected in the capital of Serbian Bosnia and Herzogovina in memory of the events of a century ago

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:46.760
Then Russian Empire couldn't not to protect this fraternal nation from agression from Austria-Hungary

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:52.180
The local Orthodox bishop shared with us the plans of the construction the church of Russian-Serbian friendship

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.040
one of the altars in this church should be consecrated in honor of the royal martyrs (murdered tsar and family)

00:01:04.434 --> 00:01:20.334
We have an idea that this church should should have three altars - Sergiy Radonezhskiy, royal family and Savva Serbsky

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:28.560
Not only common spiritual roots unite Russia and Serbia

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:33.200
There are a lot of young people who see their future with Russia, not Europe

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:41.740
Language courses, organized by the fund Russkiy Mir (Russian World), are so popular here, that this fund has made a decision to organize additional classes in the evenings.

00:01:42.360 --> 00:02:06.400
"Students learn Russian enthusiastically. The usually come here because they love Russian language, and some of them come  because they want to study in the Universities in Moscow or in the other Russian universities"

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:13.040
Its important to understand that Serbian  people instinctively reach out to Russian not because they are thinking about material well-being

00:02:13.579 --> 00:02:17.999
They can make money in Europe, but are unlikely to find a friendly shoulder to lean on there

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.480
For them, Russia is really like an older brother

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.180
And this is how most people see Russia, from old to young,

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:41.700
Serbian love Russia and they see Russia like its a really great friend, fraternal country, with a very close culture, with one  faith

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.340
Before the trip to Banya-Luka I had doubts that there exists a place where people really like Russians

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:55.000
But, here, when people hear you speaking Russian, they offer to buy you lunch in a cafe, offer to drive you somewhere, or just want to shake your hand and call you "Brother"

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:58.460
and you understand that Russia has serious friends here

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:03.180
No other nation looks at Russia with such love and hope as the Serbs
