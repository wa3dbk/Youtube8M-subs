My name is Adriana Cornell I had braces
for three years in high school which

00:00:05.069 --> 00:00:08.610
turned out to be a good experience
because it helped me decide to pursue a

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:13.469
career in the dental field the Phoenix
College dental hygiene program prepared

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:18.869
me to be successful by providing me with
the highest quality education dedicated

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.279
faculty members taught me the skills to
be a qualified professional they

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:28.560
encouraged learning by doing both in the
lab and out in the dental field not only

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:33.059
did i receive an amazing education but
the scholarship opportunities available

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:38.399
to pc students made it possible for me
to pursue my educational goals while

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:42.989
still having time to spend with my
daughter when i graduated in 2006 i

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:48.239
became a registered dental hygienist
today I not only work in a private

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:53.399
dental practice but I am also a faculty
member here at pc i've learned that

00:00:53.399 --> 00:01:00.420
service to others is the highest calling
raymond m tanaka i am i'm a general

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:09.150
dentist by education and over the past
20 years I've attended the panky

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:14.840
Institute in Key Biscayne Florida and
currently am attending the junk boys

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:20.729
seminars in Seattle Washington my
practice is primarily adult restorative

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:29.189
practice of phoenix college is dental
hygiene program is run by very competent

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:34.439
and caring professionals from the dental
hygiene standpoint what I found out

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:41.310
since I do have two of the graduates
here it's been very consistent one of

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.790
our hygienist graduated in nineteen
ninety and our other rivers hygienist

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:54.960
graduated two years ago so that would be
19 on the 2008 and over that 18 years I

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:01.260
see a very consistent student that has
come out of the program they are

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:07.930
not only technically competent but they
are very versed in communication skills

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:16.120
and that to me is a very very necessary
skills to have before you actually start

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:21.520
your hygiene career in any dental office
and having the right training get you a

00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:28.810
job and and like I mentioned earlier I
didn't I feel very blessed that I can

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:33.450
wake up and come into something that
truly love
