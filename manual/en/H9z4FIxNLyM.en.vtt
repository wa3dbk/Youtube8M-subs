Hi, I'm Amelia and on behalf of Expert Village,
I'll be talking to you about understanding

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:11.210
the laws of hair color. This is a pocket color
wheel that you can get at any art supply store.

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:16.789
You're probably wondering what I'm doing with
it? Well actually this is very important.

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:22.070
Because without this, you really can't countact
the different colors that are going on in

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:30.599
your hair. So what does that mean? At every
level, there is something called an undertone

00:00:30.599 --> 00:00:36.680
in your hair. In other words at every level,
if I was to put bleach straight on that hair,

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:41.680
and lift it to your level, what would be the
color that would be remaining in the hair?

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:47.910
So if I took the outside color off, what would
be the inside color, in a manner of speaking?

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:53.510
Well at a level six the inside color would
be orange. And let's be honest, nobody really

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:59.750
wants orange hair. So what would you do if
you had orange hair? Well, you would put blue

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:05.519
color on it. And what would that do? That
would make it a nice neutral brown. So these

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:10.920
are the things you have to take into consideration
when performing color on yourself at home.

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.840
I've seen a lot of women come in to the salon,
and they've got the dark roots, and they've

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.479
got the really brassie ends. And what I mean
by brassie, is that nice orange color that's

00:01:19.479 --> 00:01:23.770
a level six. And they're wanting to know why
it's like that, and I'm having to explain

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:29.789
to the that when they put the color on their
hair, five weeks ago, they probably didn't

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:35.950
use a good product, or a good shampoo, and
the color has faded off. And what's left is

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:41.149
the undertone. What's left is the underlying
color. What's left is what's showing, what's

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:46.749
underneath the hair, what's underneath the
color. So, when I have to apply a corrective

00:01:46.749 --> 00:01:54.249
base, I choose a color that has a blue base.
So, for example, in this range, I would choose

00:01:54.249 --> 00:02:01.340
something more in this, oh, that's red violet,
in this ash blue over here. So I would have

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:09.810
to apply like a level six AB, and that would
counteract and make her a nice neutral 6N.

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:15.530
So whenever you're applying color, and you're
wanting to make sure that you're not going

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:20.710
to be brassie, that you're not going to pull
warm, you have to take into consideration

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:26.350
your level, the lightness and darkness of
your hair, and the tone of your hair. So if

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:30.090
you're warm, in other words if you have a
lot of red in your hair, if you grandmother

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:34.720
was a red head, you're not going to want to
put red on your hair. You're going to want

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:40.870
to choose maybe an ash base. And that ash
base will then counteract that warmth in your

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:48.220
hair, and make a nice neutral color. So, whenever
choosing a color, always take into consideration

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:54.350
the underlying tones in your hair. Are you
warm, or are you cool? And if you're warm

00:02:54.350 --> 00:03:01.090
and you want to stay warm, apply a warm color.
If you're warm and you want to be neutral

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:06.990
or cool, you apply a cool color. So whenever
you're thinking about the color wheel, or

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:11.760
whenever you're thinking about color, remember
the color wheel. Whatever color is across

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:16.420
from the color you want to be, that's the
color that's going to neutralize it. So this

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:22.190
yellow orange, blue violet is going to neutralize
it and make a nice brown base. So you might

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:24.600
want to pick one of these up if you're going
to be doing a lot of home color.
