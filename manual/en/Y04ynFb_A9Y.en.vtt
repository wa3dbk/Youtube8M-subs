Hello! I'm coming to you from Dogma Premier
Dog Spa in Wayne, Pennsylvania and today we're

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:12.509
going to do some demonstrations on how you
can do creative coloring for your pet. We

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:18.350
use completely safe nontoxic materials. One
technique you will see we will wash off pretty

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:23.840
much immediately. The other technique fades
over time and it may take up to 6 weeks to

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:29.400
wash off completely. Now for the fun part.
Anna has had her ears and nails done. She

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.769
has been completely brushed and combed out
and bathed and hand dried. Now we're going

00:00:34.769 --> 00:00:41.179
to add some color to her coat. We're going
to do that with what we call blow pens. They're

00:00:41.179 --> 00:00:46.940
actually made for little kids, so they're
very very safe to use. These are very temporary.

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:52.030
You can wash them off in one bath. Fro the
blow pens, I'm going to use a couple different

00:00:52.030 --> 00:01:02.460
techniques. One is going to go free hand.
First get the pen ready. I'm going to do her

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:08.420
legs in green and I'm going to do some tips
on her tail and her ears in green. With the

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.810
blow pens, it's exactly what it sounds like.
It's like an airbrushing technique that you

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:18.040
have to blow through here to put the color
on. Some dogs do think it feels a little odd

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:36.909
when you blow on them. You can see the yellow
just brightens the green right up. It gives

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:47.509
a nice layer like a tie-dye effect. Now to
do the ears on her, I just want to do the

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:51.389
tips on the ears. Iâ€™ll grab the ears with
my hand.
