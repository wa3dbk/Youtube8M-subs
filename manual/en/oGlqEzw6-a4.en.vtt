Lost Corners consists of charcoal paintings with pastel on paper and canvas.

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:27.500 position:97%
The series shows landmarks, places and objects which we are so used to that we do not really see them anymore.

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.000 position:97%
We would only notice if they would disappear, when it is too late.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:45.000 position:97%
Most of the charcoal paintings have a desolate atmosphere, enhanced by the limited range of color, consisting mostly of tinted grays, with the deep black of charcoal.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:57.000 position:97%
While showing rather inactive scenery with no humans in sight, there is nevertheless a suggestion of life.

00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:02.000 position:94%
Somehow these places look as if action can start any minute.

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:07.300
Soon a car might drive by...

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
a crane starts working...

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.000 position:81%
a railway bridge may tumble... and click into place.

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:16.000 position:72%
However, some of the artwork do contain people

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:21.100 position:91%
but always in transit, moving from one place to the other.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000 position:97%
And then we have the train and tube stations devoid of people, or other signs of life, except for the suggestion of a train coming in...

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.100 position:97%
just outside the view, throwing a deep shadow over the platform.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000 position:97%
Or simply a frozen moment , things you notice while waiting...

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000 position:97%
your eyes wander over the powerlines, the iron constructions and other things you otherwise might neglect.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:14.700 position:97%
And finally,... there are the series of bridges seen from below, in no mans land,...

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:18.000 position:95%
where people do not venture unless they are lost or homeless.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.000 position:98%
Lost Corners is a reflective type of artwork series that doesn't seek to trigger high emotions.

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:35.000 position:91%
It simply wants to show the hidden pearls in the ordinary.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:44.500 position:97%
If you are interested, you can have a look at the artwork in detail on www.raboo.info.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000 position:97%
There are digital prints available in the form of hand signed glicees.

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:55.000 position:97%
