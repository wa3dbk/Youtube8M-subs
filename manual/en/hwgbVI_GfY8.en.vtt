00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:08.180
Ever wonder what happened to the big coupe?

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:11.510
Do you remember nameplates like Cougar and
Monte Carlo?

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:16.840
And you used to be able to buy 2-door variants
of the Camry and Altima, as well.

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:21.590
But while most manufacturers have given up
on the bodystyle, Honda decided to keep it

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:26.880
when they launched the all-new Accord in 2013
and for those with sportier intentions, that’s

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.130
a very good thing.

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:31.990
018The Accord is one of the best-selling cars
in America.

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:35.090
But of course, the vast majority is sold with
4-doors.

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:39.710
Let’s say you prefer the silhouette and
sexiness of a coupe though but can do without

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.100
the often small and juvenile nature of a 2+2.

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.110
Well, before you is the perfect solution.

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:52.510
The Accord Coupe is a front-drive midsize-proportioned
2-door underpinned by Honda’s chassis expertise,

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:58.770
available with 4 or 6-cylinder power matched
with either a stickshift or automatic transmission.

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:05.719
Mine is the range-topping EX-L V6 with navi
and 6-speed auto with no options, priced at

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:06.719
$33,370.

00:01:06.719 --> 00:01:12.050
I hadn’t driven one since the car’s launch
a couple years back and this week reminded

00:01:12.050 --> 00:01:14.950
me of just how fun it really is.

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:19.250
Just 2” inches shorter between the wheels
than the sedan, the Coupe comes styled with

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:24.440
a similar level of maturity with just the
right infusion of luster to give it that racier,

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:25.440
sports car look.

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:29.210
If it’s hood scoops and oversized spoilers
you’re after than move along.

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:34.750
But I really like the understated nature of
this car and these 18” wheels are a perfect

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:35.750
match.

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:42.740
When you go V6 you buy into a 278-horsepower,
251 pound-feet of torque Accord that’ll

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:47.930
squeal its high-end Michelins on its sprint
to 60mph in a scant 5.5-seconds.

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:56.140
It responds to your impulses with a surprising
urgency, with 6 gears, a sport mode and paddle

00:01:56.140 --> 00:01:57.220
shifters with which to play.

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:01.479
There's something very straightforward and
simple about the Accord Coupe that people

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:03.830
who like to drive will appreciate.

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:09.649
It doesn't try to deliver an overtly sporty
experience; instead it puts you in control

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:15.950
of a car with precise, light steering, frisky
handling and a strong, smooth powertrain.

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:21.090
It has Honda's sophisticated diving feel in
a more exciting package that doesn't neglect

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:22.930
practicality.

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:27.389
Some bemoaned the deletion of the double wishbone
suspension when this car was redesigned, but

00:02:27.389 --> 00:02:32.120
the MacPherson struts do a yeoman’s job
of balancing ride and handling, reducing body

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.080
roll and contributing to quietness.

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:39.129
The virtual absence of torque steer is a feat
as is the Coupe’s willingness to plant its

00:02:39.129 --> 00:02:44.340
nose considering 63% of the car’s 3,500
pounds is up front.

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:48.569
It’s not a rear-wheel drive drifter but
it’s definitely engaging to drive.

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:54.849
The 3.5-liter Earth Dreams engine dreams a
little less than its 4-cylinder counterpart

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:59.569
with a single – not double overhead cam
design - and without direct-injection, but

00:02:59.569 --> 00:03:05.599
uses variable cylinder management to muster
an impressive 21mpg city/32mpg highway on

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:06.839
regular unleaded.

00:03:06.839 --> 00:03:10.569
There’s also an Eco mode for tooling around
town.

00:03:10.569 --> 00:03:15.669
This EX-L trim has leather, of course and
a host of other standard niceties to justify

00:03:15.669 --> 00:03:21.469
its premium pricing – such as heated seats
with driver’s side memory, push button start,

00:03:21.469 --> 00:03:27.670
Active Noise Cancellation and the feature-laden
though cumbersome HondaLink infotainment system.

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:31.919
With just-right front seats and excellent
all-around visibility the Coupe makes for

00:03:31.919 --> 00:03:36.620
an agreeable handshake and items like Lane
Watch, Forward Collision Warning and Lane

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:39.309
Departure Warning solidify the safety.

00:03:39.309 --> 00:03:44.969
It’s fairly unadorned and a little old school
inside yet other than the fussy center stack,

00:03:44.969 --> 00:03:48.209
the cabin functions with an appreciated ergonomic
grace.

00:03:48.209 --> 00:03:53.499
You’d laugh at most coupe’s rear seats
but these are absolutely adult usable and

00:03:53.499 --> 00:03:55.980
easy to access from the passenger’s side.

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:01.699
The trunk loses only 2 cubic-feet to the sedan
too, though my car’s rear seat proved problematic

00:04:01.699 --> 00:04:02.699
to drop.

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:08.119
When the demands of adult life call yet a
youthful passion still burns, the Accord Coupe

00:04:08.119 --> 00:04:13.709
is there to work it out.
