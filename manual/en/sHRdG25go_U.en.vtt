[music]

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:09.840
You know, I look back every once and a while on my great-grandfather and what he would think.

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:12.880
He was such a practical guy...

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:16.410
His attitude always was: You do the best; the
best will happen.

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:20.189
And I think that's what's happened. I think he
would think this was all great,

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.780
and he would, and he'd be proud of it, he would.

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:26.820
But he'd be much more interested in being on the factory floor.

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:28.520
And that's the truth.

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:32.029
It's a great tradition to carry on and legacy to
carry on.

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:35.960
The only toys I ever got to play with were little
Caterpillar toys, you know, way back when

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.160
in 1948 is when I was born in Peoria, Illinois.

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:41.380
My father was
working for Caterpillar at the time.

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:45.560
But my fondest memories
are when I first started.

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:46.820
I mean, there's no doubt about it

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:50.040
I was a kid, and you know, I started out as a parts runner.

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:52.860
And I remember my first job, outside at the wash rack

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.260
and I burned up my rubber boots because I left them on the steam cleaner. Those kinds of things.

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:58.920
I remember these guys --

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:02.300
I started working as an assistant for the field service guys –

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.060
which I just loved that because 
we were out all day, every day,

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.219
working hard on your own and all that kind of
stuff.

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:11.880
You know, they'd just razz me. Remember, I was the boss's son. I mean, every day.

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:15.049
And, you know, I remember one day being taken out

00:01:15.049 --> 00:01:18.159
into a landfill – back then we called them garbage dumps, remember, now they're landfills –

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:22.729
This was in Corpus Christie, Texas – 110 degrees, 100 percent humidity.

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:27.450
They told me I had to do something under the belly pan.  Well, of course, it wasn't clean.  So, I had to crawl through the garbage

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:30.819
the way back to the back end. They were all standing around the back end laughing, of course,

00:01:30.819 --> 00:01:35.270
because I'm now covered in garbage. So, those are the kind of memories you have, and it has to do with people.

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:38.460
I mean, yes, I love the machinery.  I love the machinery.

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:43.720
I love being in the machinery business at all levels.  Engines – luckily we were in the territory from day one.

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.680
Big on engines: shrimp boat engines; oil field engines.

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:49.400
But the machinery and
all of it goes together.

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:52.810
So, for me, it still was the people.

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:56.240
I just love our customer base. I love the people that like this type of business

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:02.400
and want to be in it. And, luckily, Caterpillar Inc.– Caterpillar Tractor Company, when it was merged in 1925 – now Caterpillar Inc.

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:07.500
has carried on that tradition using the
same innovative ways of operating,

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:12.171
the same focus on character and ethics, and become truly a worldwide company

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:14.779
in a very strong way on a on a global basis.

00:02:14.779 --> 00:02:19.659
