00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.800
Welcome friends of analog entertainment to a new episode of Hunter &amp; Cron 

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:11.660
Today again with a Spiel des Jahres, this time 2012: Kingdom Builder by Donald Vaccarino.

00:00:11.669 --> 00:00:18.009
Mister Dominion! 2-4 players, Queen Games, ages 8 and up, playable in three quarters of an hour. 

00:00:18.009 --> 00:00:24.489
A strategy game. Very accessible. With a game board that looks a bit like Settlers of Catan, 

00:00:24.489 --> 00:00:27.400
but works quite differently. 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:36.040
On this board we must build a kingdom using typical settler houses. 

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:42.120
And the game ends when a player has put down all his houses.

00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:47.200
That means at the end the game board will be full with houses of different colors 

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:51.120
and then there will be the scoring.

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.460
The board is always put together differently. It consists of 4 parts. 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:00.840
But there are more parts that are all different, 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:04.080
with different landscape fields, arranged differently.

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:11.300
And these landscape elements also have such town and castle fields. 

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:14.860
The castle fields give points if you settle there. 

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:22.320
But the town fields have a special function, because one must always put two tiles on top of these. 

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:25.580
Here we see, for example, the tavern. 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:30.560
Use the tavern to get a settlement on one of the two ends 

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.460
of one of your own contiguous settlement chains. 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:40.500
Here we see the paddock. With the paddock I can move a settlement two fields. 

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:47.320
And on the other landscape parts are even more special fields 

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:51.720
such as the harbor or the tower or the oracle. 

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:58.340
The victory conditions for getting points in the end are also variable in Kingdom Builder

00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:03.299
And these are always three, which are drawn from a small stack of cards. 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:08.170
We have the fisherman in our example. It says: Build settlements next to the water. 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:15.150
Because you get one gold for each settlement, which is built adjacent to one or more water fields.

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:20.120
The Knight: Build many settlements in a horizontal line.

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:25.260
2 gold, gold stands for victory points, for each settlement on the horizontal line 

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:28.860
with the most of your own settlements. 

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:31.599
We also have the merchant. 

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:38.359
Here it is lucrative to connect two town and castle fields that exist on the board with each other.

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:41.240
Because you get 4 gold for each town or castle field, 

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:46.019
that is connected with your settlements with one or more other town or castle field. 

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:51.399
There are quite a number of other cards like lords: Build the most settlements in each quadrant. 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:55.770
Miners, now it is lucrative to settle next to the mountain. And so on and so forth. 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:00.259
How is this thing played? Very simple indeed. 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:06.380
It's not going to get any easier indeed, because I just draw a single card. 

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:12.000
And this card tells me, on which landscape I have to settle!

00:03:12.009 --> 00:03:19.509
In that case it is desert. And to settle means I'm building three houses. 

00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:25.249
And I have built the houses, so that they adjoin here to one of these special fields. 

00:03:25.249 --> 00:03:29.260
In this case the oasis, then I get such a special action tile "oasis". 

00:03:29.269 --> 00:03:34.780
So in the future I can settle on an additional desert field once per turn 

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:36.840
Now you must still consider the following 

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:41.620
namely the settling has to follow a few very important basic rules. 

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:49.880
For example, I have to constantly settle next to already existing settlements. 

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:56.860
That means would I draw desert again, I would automatically settle on these three desert fields. 

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:02.780
My second landscape, which I draw, is flower. But I currently only adjoin to desert and canyon. 

00:04:02.789 --> 00:04:10.289
And only in this case, I may now actually occupy any flower field. 

00:04:10.289 --> 00:04:18.489
And of course I grab quickly the second special tile. 

00:04:18.489 --> 00:04:27.759
Now I can settle on another meadow , but I currently don't adjoin to any meadow field. 

00:04:27.759 --> 00:04:35.259
So now I can actually open up a third settlement. And I do it here.

00:04:35.259 --> 00:04:42.399
I'm trying a chain and even closing it. Now I have connected two town fields. 

00:04:42.400 --> 00:04:48.460
And I get a special ability. This is good for the "merchants" scoring at the end. 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:53.039
So it goes on and on. I draw actually always only a single card. 

00:04:53.039 --> 00:04:59.059
This sounds shockingly limited, but if you're getting into it, it is not limited at all. 

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:07.080
Because you actually have many possibilities, through all these special abilities 

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:12.000
that I have collected, I could settle to another desert once per turn,  

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:19.700
once per turn settle on an extra meadow. Also, I could move a house thanks to the paddock. 

00:05:19.700 --> 00:05:28.180
And I could build an additional house at rows with at least three houses with this special ability. 

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:31.620
And I can really use all these special abilities in each turn. 

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:34.860
We must now remember, that there are three other players in the mix, 

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:38.380
wishing to grab the special tiles, blocking space.

00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:41.740
They spread precisely where you wanted to spread. 

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:48.220
I found "Kingdom Builder" very convincing. It is a very approachable strategy game 

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:51.540
with an amazing amount of depth. 

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:59.900
Personally, I was a bit put off in the beginning because of this abstract feeling. 

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:03.480
I had it standing in the closet, bought it quickly. I am a big fan of Dominion. 

00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:09.320
But then haven't played it for a long time because I thought somehow ... I do not know. 

00:06:09.330 --> 00:06:14.150
But then we unpacked it finally and it instantly clicked with us. 

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:15.930
And that night we have played nothing else. 

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:19.450
It is great because it is really played in three quarters of an hour.

00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:23.360
That means you can play a revenge, a revenge, a revenge and a revenge. 

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:27.380
Not as with many other games, which consume the whole evening with only two plays. 

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:35.580
I think, Spiel des Jahres is well deserved, but it is more complex than it appears. 

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:39.280
The rules are read in 5 minutes and explained 5 minutes. 

00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:46.550
But there is more gameplay depth, as you think at first glance. 

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:53.160
Yes and that is the small dilemma with Kingdom Builder. Is more gameplay depth negative or not? 

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:58.020
Everyone needs to decide that for themselves, for me, of course, more depth is always good. 

00:06:58.020 --> 00:07:05.580
If you want you can dive into it very deep and maximize every game, think for a long time. 

00:07:05.580 --> 00:07:12.640
And try to achieve as much as you can. But then it's almost not a family game any more.

00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:17.800
Although there is a luck factor at the beginning. An immense advantage for the starting player

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:22.490
but it can be compensated by rule options from the internet,

00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:26.350
or in the current Spielbox is another proposal. 

00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:30.580
So hardcore gamers and tactic foxes are likely to do that in the long run. 

00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:34.460
Otherwise, I'm curious what this gentleman will release next 

00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:37.520
and I am eager to look at all of his other games.
