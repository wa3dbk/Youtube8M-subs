Hello, in this tutorial I show you how to make inflated paper hearts

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:19.870
material

00:00:25.332 --> 00:00:38.714
letter size paper of the color you want, ruler, scissors and pencil

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:50.155
take the sheet of paper and rule

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:58.257
accommodate the rule up and measure spaces of 1.5 cm

00:00:59.578 --> 00:01:01.935
and mark with pencil

00:01:07.834 --> 00:01:09.805
do the same in the bottom of the sheet

00:01:20.992 --> 00:01:29.252
you should have 2 marks each at 1.5 cm away, up and down

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:35.029
take the rule and align at the first top mark

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:39.266
accommodate to match with the bottom

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.130
so that the line is straight

00:01:49.115 --> 00:01:54.070
draw the line at each mark

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:00.320
after that, you´ll have strips of 1.5 cm wide

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:05.030
cut the strips, if you want you can cut in pairs

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:13.230
fold in half and mark well the fold

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.360
again fold in half marking well the fold

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.900
unfold and you´ll have folds well marked

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:39.870
cut each fold

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:46.390
if you cut in pairs, cut them in half

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.770
when you finish, take one strip

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:05.370
take the right corner and fold up making a triangular shape

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:11.590
match and mark the fold

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:17.700
you should have a triangle

00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:21.170
fold back inward marking the fold

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:35.900
fold the triangle again

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:41.600
continue folding marking well the folds

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:46.650
repeat this procedure until you have a small rectangle

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:55.180
you should have something like this

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.850
a triangle and a tab

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:06.200
cut the edges so they are diagonal

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.000
you´ll have this, insert the tab on that opening

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:20.640
take it and fold without insert

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.150
verifies that there is no leftover on the diagonal side of the triangle

00:04:25.863 --> 00:04:27.480
cut with scissors

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:33.750
insert the tab into the opening

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:37.100
and mark well the fold

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:40.520
you should have a triangle like this

00:04:40.458 --> 00:04:43.200
it shouldn´t be too loose or too tight

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:50.090
take it between your fingers and with your thumb push it inward

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.460
again just push inward with the thumb

00:04:58.700 --> 00:04:59.910
you will have something like this

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:08.350
take the heart and with your fingers press the two peaks edges

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:18.320
with scissors cut the edges so that they are rounded

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:31.930
you finished

00:05:35.980 --> 00:05:38.090
leave aside and make more

00:05:41.741 --> 00:05:45.780
remember that you can make them on different papers

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:52.150
or even you can make them bigger

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:59.230
you can use them for bottled cards or gifts

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:08.460
I hope you enjoyed this tutorial
