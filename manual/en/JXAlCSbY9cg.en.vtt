00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:07.120
Being the new FIFA U20 World Cup
ambassador is the latest gig

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:12.400
for Tuhoe and Ngai Te Rangi
descendant Stan Walker.

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:18.400
He's out and about today
in his new role promoting football

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:22.800
to the Maori
and Pacific Island community.

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:27.400
Raniera Harrison caught up
with Stan today.

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:36.080
It's a far cry
from what he's used to...

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:48.560
Stan Walker has been named
the national ambassador

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:52.080
for the upcoming FIFA U20 World Cup.

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:58.800
Today he was out and about spreading
the cheer at Sutton Park School,

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.600
in Mangere, South Auckland.

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:06.240
And he's not taking
his new found role lightly.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.440
He was also informing
two lucky students

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:31.880
they have been given the honour
of running out the visiting teams

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.760
when they arrive in coming weeks.

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.160
For these youthful players

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:49.280
to see the benefits
of this traditional fixture.

00:01:55.080 --> 00:02:00.680
All in the comedic fashion Walker
has become well-known for.

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.800
But there's truth
in what he is saying.

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:30.120
Growing the indigenous
football stars of tomorrow.

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.680
Raniera Harrison, Te Karere.
