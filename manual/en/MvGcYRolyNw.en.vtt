&gt;&gt;&gt; DR.

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:16.090
DAVID MARGILETH: Let’s next talk about the
somewhat controversial issue and also somewhat

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:22.490
confusing issue of the role of scans in patients
with breast cancer.

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:31.110
I think patients with breast cancer often
overestimate the benefit and need for scans

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:38.000
but in my own practice, we typically will
do PET CT scans on patients with node positive

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.429
breast cancer, on patients with locally advanced
breast cancer and on patients with what’s

00:00:44.429 --> 00:00:47.050
called inflammatory breast cancer.

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:53.239
These are the more high risk patients that
have at least some likelihood of having established

00:00:53.239 --> 00:01:00.780
metastatic disease at the time of diagnosis,
although interestingly that percent is not

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.929
very common.

00:01:02.929 --> 00:01:12.470
In low stage patients, patients that are node
negative, I tend to discourage scans as the

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:19.610
true positive rate, that is finding overt
metastatic disease, is incredibly low and

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:26.610
the false positive rate, that is finding abnormalities
of the scan that are not due to the cancer,

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:29.800
is more common than true positive.

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:35.530
The dilemma there is that you got a scan that
show something, you are not quite sure what

00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:36.530
it is.

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:41.480
You are fairly convinced it is not the cancer
but you are left with something to evaluate,

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:47.580
which may be stressful for the patient and
for which there may be no easy way at least

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:53.120
at that point in time to determine the significance
of that abnormality.

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:59.200
In that case, the patient may remain quite
nervous until one repeat the scan three to

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.510
four months later to see if there has been
a change.

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:08.039
So on higher risk patients, I think scanning
is appropriate but in lower risk patients

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:14.420
has not been beneficial and I would try to
discourage it.

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:21.980
Hi, I am Dr. Jay Harness and I want to share
with you important information that I believe

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:26.460
that every newly diagnosed patient with breast
cancer needs to know.

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:28.680
Susan Denver: I am a breast cancer survivor.

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.350
Katherine Stockton: I am a breast cancer survivor.

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:32.950
Coree: I am a breast cancer survivor.

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.370
Susan Denver: And I want every woman to know…

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:38.280
Katherine Stockton: …about personalized
breast cancer treatment…

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:39.280
Susan Denver: …and the Genomic Test.

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.130
Coree: A test that helps guide a woman and
her doctor…

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:47.150
Katherine Stockton: …to the best treatment
options for her.

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:54.450
Susan Denver: Pass it on!
