Hi! My name is Matt, and on behalf of expertvillage.com,
I’m going to show you some stretches, some

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:10.370
basic exercises that you should do before
doing gymnastics, or basically any sport or

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:14.660
strenuous physical activity. If you want some
more information, go to lagymnastics.com.

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:22.949
Okay, you’re going to go chin to your knee.
Now chin to your other knee. You’re going

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:34.660
to want to do a butterfly. Stretch down. You
make a pike and stretch down again. You make

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:47.390
a tuck; you tuck and roll. Put your hands
back like this, put you hands on floor; make

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:58.140
a bridge. Always go back and tuck and roll.
Climb up on your knees; put your hands on

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:02.780
your hips. You’re going to try and do some
splits so one leg in front, make a lunge.

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:10.049
Big space under your knee, chest up tall,
and you push your knee straight, hands on

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:14.570
either side, and go as far as you can. This
is far enough, if you can farther, go farther,

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:26.630
and you switch legs. Take a step and make
a lunge. Okay, then stretch your leg straight,

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:32.340
hands on the floor, and go and do splits.
As far as you can. If this is far as you can,

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:40.139
that’s fine. If you can go farther, go farther.
Then you want to do the splits in the middle.

00:01:40.139 --> 00:01:45.450
Both hands down on the floor, straddle, go
as far as you can all the way down the middle.

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:52.899
If you on a line, put your heels on the line
and your hips stay over that line. You’re

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:58.170
not way over here and you’re not sitting
down here. Your hips are over the line and

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.369
you go as far as you can.
