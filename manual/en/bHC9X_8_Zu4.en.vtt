00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:06.430
Hello, this is Kumamiki.

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:11.209
I’m gonna dye my hair with Ancels color treatment butter which I always use to dye my hair at home.

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:17.240
 

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:22.170
It’s called treatment of magic and come in 25 colors.

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:25.449
 

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:32.449
You can mix and make the colors of infinity.

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:37.960
 

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:43.030
And it’s for advance, mix ash milk tea ”3", baby pink ”1" and clear ”6”, it’s gonna be your original color. 

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:47.539
 

00:00:47.539 --> 00:00:51.059
Let’s get started.

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:57.640
What you need are news paper, towel, vaseline, rubber gloves, comb for dying, hair clip, hair rubber band, a bowl, a spoon, a whisk and saran.

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:04.000
 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:11.000
 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:16.670
At first, wet your hair and dry with a towel.

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:19.850
And then, do a blocking for dying easily.

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:25.369
 

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:29.159
I’m gonna paint that pink milk tea for outside and inside gonna be colorful.

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:34.250
 

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:38.119
If you use colorful rubbers, you don’t miss a patch of hair.

00:01:38.119 --> 00:01:42.719
Next, paint vaseline on your face line. 

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:46.719
Applying this will make it easier to rinse off the dye that gets on your skin.

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:52.210
Put a towel around your shoulders and wear a cardigan which you don’t need.

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:56.700
It’s time to dye.

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:03.469
I’ll use light purple, baby pink, ice  mint green and pink milk tea.

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:06.649
 

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:12.670
 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.520
If your hair has white blond, it’s dyed exactly what you see, 
but there are some pink in my hair. I put the dye behind my ear.

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:20.890
Wipe off the dye with a tissue paper in a few minutes.

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:25.230
It’s time to start dying.

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:31.110
Paint the back with two mirrors, your friend or family because it’s difficult.

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:36.270
Apply the dye to your hair and wrap it with saran.

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:41.830
 

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:44.870
Now I’ll talk the difference of color butter and hair manicure.

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:49.630
If you use a hair manicure. your hair get dry because of organic ingredients.

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:53.970
 

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:59.140
And what the bad point is gonnna be messy at sink or bathroom because the water has color.

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:03.980
 

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:09.160
One the other hand, crip joint god made the color butter. 

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:13.560
There is no organic ingredients. The bright color is not enough, 

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:18.030
but the main ingredient is treatment, it's good for repairing hair.

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:22.830
It’s easy to use because I don’t feel guilty for my hair.

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:29.450
 

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:33.540
After rinse your hair, the water is clear, so it won’t be messy at the sink. 

00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:39.760
 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:44.590
I usually dye at salon and when the color fades, fix hair color at home. 

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:50.020
It’s  almost once every two weeks.

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:54.730
There are so many kinds of brown color, it’s useful for repairing hair.

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:58.070
 

00:03:58.070 --> 00:04:05.070
 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:09.410
To keep the color, use a color shampoo.

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:12.770
 

00:04:12.770 --> 00:04:16.750
 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:21.400
How to use is in the same way as shampoo. The more you use, the better hair color will keep.

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:26.880
 

00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:30.180
 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:34.870
I recommend it to dye color pink from blond little by little.

00:04:34.870 --> 00:04:37.710
 

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:42.620
The purple color shampoo will dye your blond hair white blond, and 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:47.460
the silver color shampoo will repair silver color.

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:52.040
Leave the hair dye in twenty minutes after wrap your hair by saran.

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:55.430
 

00:04:55.430 --> 00:05:00.350
It’ll keep deeply when it gonna be hot. I recommend that you take a shower while you are waiting.

00:05:00.350 --> 00:05:03.440
 

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:07.690
Ok, done!Got beautiful color. 

00:05:07.690 --> 00:05:12.480
The base color is milk tea, but the inside has a lot of colors. So When wind blows, it’s very beautiful.

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:17.230
Before Dye my hair, it was light pink, so my hair got beautiful pink color and green color got deep what you see.

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:21.920
 

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:24.920
 

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:30.100
 

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:34.500
The main ingredient is treatment.

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:40.490
That’s why the finish will be smooth and when I wash my hair, I’m not worried about losing hair.

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:46.250
 

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:52.640
I

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:57.460
 

00:05:57.460 --> 00:06:03.800
If there are some left,  keep it in a place which doesn’t get sunrise.

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:09.220
So you can use it for 2 years.

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:14.030
The liquid which you made by yourself might be separated,  so you should run out of it on that day.

00:06:14.030 --> 00:06:17.250
 

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:24.250
That’s all.

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:29.040
See you~!
