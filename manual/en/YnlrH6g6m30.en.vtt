00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:09.040
On behalf of expertvillage.com my name is
Neal Jones and I’m with A Perfect Fit Alterations

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:15.460
and we’re at 102 Main Street in historic
old town Burleson and our phone number is

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:25.300
817-447-3522. Continuing with our serger we
will we’ve gotten down to the about the

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:32.800
quarter mark and then we’re going to open
the door, now this door that is used while

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:38.580
you’re operating the machine and it is also
an area where we’ll be able there will be

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:45.110
some service performed. Now in order to make
this machine operate properly some of the

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:50.100
adjustments that we’re going to need to
do are inside this door as you can see the

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.960
thread, the different colored threads for
the sake of the demonstration we have loaded

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:01.770
this machine with the color thread that is
indicated by the adjustment but of course

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:06.800
you don’t have use those colors, you can
also use any color, you can use all the same

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:12.330
color, the reason why the colors are there
are to enable you to thread the machine the

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:20.370
way it needs to be threaded. There are several
major differences, this machine has two what

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:27.480
we call the needles or the mechanisms at the
bottom of the machine are called loopers and

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:33.700
we have two, we have a lower looper, we have
an upper looper and those loopers are to form

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:40.540
the bottom part of the thread of the stitch.
We also have two needles in this particular

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:46.120
machine and those needles are similar to the
needles that are in a regular sewing machine

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:53.700
and they are able to supply the thread to
the top of the machine. We also have another

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:59.310
very important part of this inside this door
which should be a permanent part of the machine

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:06.310
and that is our thread guide here, this thread
guide when the manuals are lost and not being

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:13.480
used is very important because this machine
is complex enough that you can’t possibly

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:20.220
remember all of the ways to set it up for
the different uses, so we have a thread guide

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:27.180
here which shows different colors and it also
shows a little diagram of a picture of the

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:36.670
thread of the stitch that would be generated
by this particular thread setup. If we were

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:42.720
going to use a four thread which is this setup
for now it tells you the order in which to

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:47.750
thread the machine, we’ve got a number one
here which is on the third one along, a number

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:53.160
two on the fourth one along, a number four
on the first one and a three on the second

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:58.630
one. The reason why those numbers are out
of order is that, that is the order in which

00:02:58.630 --> 00:02:59.430
the machine should be threaded.
