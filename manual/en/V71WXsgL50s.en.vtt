Today's topic is how to change a flat tire.
Changing a flat tire is very easy. The proper

00:00:05.629 --> 00:00:11.740
jacks is what you really need. This is a floor
jack that comes with, most garages have. This

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:17.430
is a floor jack that a lot of people have
in their trunk. Your car comes with a jack,

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.560
by looking in your owners manual you can find
out which jack, where to place the jack on

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:27.050
your vehicle and where the jack location is
in your vehicle. Place the jack under the

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:38.360
frame on your vehicle and jack it up. My emergency
brake is on at this point. This is a four

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.730
way lug wrench which you have to buy after
market, they don't usually come with your

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:45.530
vehicle. Your vehicle usually comes with a
single one, they all work. These are a lot

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:51.130
easier and I suggest getting one for your
vehicle. Put it on the lug and break and loose,

00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:57.940
turning the lug nut off, these are very easy
to use this way. Remove all four lug nuts,

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:10.310
I already have three of them off. Of course,
these are harder ones to take off than a lot

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:19.630
of them. Take your wheel off, set it aside,
you're now ready to put your wheel back on.

00:01:19.630 --> 00:01:24.650
Take your wheel put it back on the studs,
and reverse the process by putting the lug

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:31.680
nuts back on. It's great, the best thing to
do is to put all four of them on before you

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:40.240
go tightening them all up, okay. Then tighten
your lug nuts up, in a sequence all four,

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:52.759
one, two, three, and four. If it has five
lugs, you go one, two, three, four, five,

00:01:52.759 --> 00:01:57.700
skipping every other one tightening them up
slowly at a time until they're all tight.

00:01:57.700 --> 00:01:59.149
This is the proper way to change your tire.
