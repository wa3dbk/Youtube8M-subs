00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:09.920
KRISTAL: Kristal Wick here with Artbeads CafÃ©,
where we have caffeine, beads, Cynthia, Kristal.

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:16.209
That's a good time, if I may say so myself.

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:19.869
Cynthia, we are having some fun now.

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:24.320
This little invention here, you guys, I can't
even wait for her to start talking about it,

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:25.869
because I want one in every color, please.

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:27.020
Thank you very much.

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:28.529
Oh my gosh, dive in.

00:00:28.529 --> 00:00:29.529
Fill me in.

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:30.529
Tell us everything.

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:31.529
CYNTHIA: Yeah.

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.870
I've been seeing this type of bracelet a lot,
and I thought it's been awhile, I wanted to

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:35.880
try that.

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:38.649
I finally did, and they're so easy to make.

00:00:38.649 --> 00:00:39.649
KRISTAL: Seriously?

00:00:39.649 --> 00:00:40.800
Because I do not think so.

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:41.800
CYNTHIA: They are.

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:42.800
KRISTAL: I haven't tried them.

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:43.800
Okay, I believe you.

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:44.800
Okay, I'll believe you.

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:50.800
CYNTHIA: So the only thing that you need is
a piece of leather.

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.070
On this little one with a button, I just chose
a round leather.

00:00:54.070 --> 00:01:02.000
On this one, I chose a Regaliz 5 millimeters,
and then a knotting cord, and of course the

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.000
cupchain, Swarovski.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.500
KRISTAL: Our favorite Swarovski cupchain.

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:06.500
Beautiful.

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:07.500
And that's all you need?

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:08.500
CYNTHIA: That's all you need.

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:09.500
KRISTAL: Oh, this is good.

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.800
CYNTHIA: And you just wrap and wrap and wrap.

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:18.120
I chose this contrasting color because it's
really fun to make different colors with it.

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:19.120
KRISTAL: Sure.

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:23.240
CYNTHIA: On this one, I thought the Regaliz
10 millimeters was really nice.

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.500
It already has some colors on the side.

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.939
KRISTAL: That's an interesting thing to point
out.

00:01:27.939 --> 00:01:34.210
The leather is the brown cord, the normal
color leather, and then the edges are just

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:38.899
a touch of color, but that's actually what
you see on your bracelet.

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:40.390
CYNTHIA: Yes.

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:45.969
Because I wanted to leave this color there,
I chose a very brown color for the cord, which

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:48.370
matched the inside of the leather.

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:49.370
KRISTAL: Got it.

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:52.570
CYNTHIA: And in that case, I use a bigger
size cupchain.

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:53.570
KRISTAL: Wow.

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:58.630
CYNTHIA: Like I said, they're very easy to
make, and you can go on our Learning Center

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:59.630
page.

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.610
There is a step-by-step Handy Tip how to make
those.

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:06.659
KRISTAL: Oh, that's great, because everybody
wants to know exactly how you made it.

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:07.690
Oh, this is so fun.

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:10.200
CYNTHIA: And like you said, in every single
color.

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:11.740
KRISTAL: One every color, please.

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:14.920
These would also make really great Christmas
presents, I bet.

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.030
CYNTHIA: Yes.

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:17.480
KRISTAL: Thanks for sharing, Cynthia.

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:18.670
CYNTHIA: You're welcome.

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:20.260
KRISTAL: These are great.

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.530
KRISTAL: Cynthia, it's time for Kristal Wick's
Picks, where I get to share with you -- and

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:26.030
you -- some of my favorite things.

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:31.400
Because we're talking about holidays and time
to get ready for the holidays, nothing in

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:34.080
my book is better than hotfix.

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:36.730
Swarovski hotfix for the holidays.

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:38.060
Oh my goodness.

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:43.230
Anything fabric, it secures itself to that
and it's there forever and it's wonderful.

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:45.340
You can even wash these things.

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:46.440
Hotfix is the best thing for that.

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:51.440
You use your little tool, you have all these
great shapes; your hotfix tool to make sure

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.909
that the glue melts into the fabric, and then
voila!

00:02:55.909 --> 00:02:57.630
Here's a few things that I have to share.

00:02:57.630 --> 00:02:59.709
Stockings, oh my goodness.

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:00.830
Love the stockings.

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:05.470
You have to have them for your pets, of course,
as well as humans.

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:08.200
So here, this is for the cat lovers out there.

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:12.470
You have to have a stocking for your cats
or your dogs, and this guy, this stocking

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:13.470
was about $1.50.

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.290
Very inexpensive.

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:16.989
The blank stockings are very inexpensive.

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:19.440
Then you embellish with your hotfix.

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:24.440
So I used some beautiful marquise hotfix stones
here.

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:30.019
Now, the crystals that are marquise shaped,
they have a really different kind of reflection

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:33.720
on them, and they give a very classy, elegant
feel to it.

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:37.680
So I wanted to use that on some of the stockings
as well as the cute little hearts.

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.959
This guy here, this was a dollar.

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:42.490
I know, hard to believe.

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:47.019
And I used our Kanzashi templates and made
Kanzashi flowers.

00:03:47.019 --> 00:03:49.040
CYNTHIA: This is such a great idea.

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:50.470
KRISTAL: Isn't it cute?

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:51.709
And you could do any colors.

00:03:51.709 --> 00:03:55.040
I did the traditional holiday colors, but
of course, you could do a theme.

00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:00.740
If you've got -- maybe your husband's a fisherman,
you could use fish fabrics and make his stocking

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:02.019
with Kanzashi.

00:04:02.019 --> 00:04:04.709
There's all kinds of fun things you can do.

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:05.829
And then again, embellished.

00:04:05.829 --> 00:04:08.980
Anywhere there's fabric, you can use hotfix,
which is really fun.

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:14.220
Here are some really pretty, lovely different
shapes, and as you can see, I used this bar

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:21.730
shape here on the stocking to give it a different
kind of look as opposed to just round.

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:24.790
This guy, oh my goodness, this is one of my
favorites.

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:28.410
This is Sparkle, my dog's, coat.

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:29.550
She loves plaid.

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:35.060
So she has a little plaid coat with a little
hoodie here.

00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:36.670
Yeah, because she gets cold.

00:04:36.670 --> 00:04:40.610
And then I did some hotfix on the "Woof."

00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:43.470
So you can always spell out names or initials.

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:44.910
It's really fun.

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:49.530
And of course, this is what makes it stand
out, is the hotfix.

00:04:49.530 --> 00:04:55.920
You can do that on anything: on little ornaments,
especially for little kids, you can use really

00:04:55.920 --> 00:05:01.160
cute little hotfix for their initials or for
their name.

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:02.160
That's really cute.

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:04.390
They love their name on anything.

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:06.950
I could go on and on forever, like I said.

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:08.110
Love affair with the hotfix.

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:13.670
But I just wanted to share some lovely Christmas
ideas and holiday things.

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:19.570
KRISTAL: Cynthia, it's time for our Q&amp;A, and
we have Shirley in Texas.

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:21.500
She asked, "How do you set rivolis?"

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:26.850
CYNTHIA: That's a great question, because
a lot of people use rivolis with seed beading.

00:05:26.850 --> 00:05:27.850
KRISTAL: Right.

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:29.280
CYNTHIA: They do a bezel with seed beads.

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:32.600
KRISTAL: And it's very common with seed bead
and rivolis, they go together.

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:36.800
But everyone else loves looking and drooling
over rivolis, including myself?

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:38.870
What do you do with them?

00:05:38.870 --> 00:05:39.870
What else can you do?

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:44.830
CYNTHIA: We have this great component where
the only thing you do is glue the rivoli inside.

00:05:44.830 --> 00:05:45.830
KRISTAL: Sweet.

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:46.830
I like that.

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:48.710
CYNTHIA: It is that easy.

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:54.900
We have like here, you have this beautiful
little ring, and you just glue the rivoli

00:05:54.900 --> 00:05:55.900
inside.

00:05:55.900 --> 00:05:57.270
KRISTAL: It's hard to believe it's glue and
go.

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:58.550
CYNTHIA: Exactly, exactly.

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:00.250
KRISTAL: I love it.

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:03.760
CYNTHIA: You use the 12 millimeters size rivoli.

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:09.240
Then we have this great little chandelier,
and I made a pair of earrings out of them.

00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:10.770
KRISTAL: Those are so sweet.

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:12.210
Yes, and easy to do.

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:17.200
We love TierraCast, of course, and so they
come in all these different finishes.

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:18.200
Right.

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:24.990
CYNTHIA: Then you've got some links also,
you have the little charm pendant.

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:29.940
All of these are so easy to use, and there
is so many things that you can do with them.

00:06:29.940 --> 00:06:32.670
Like I made this necklace here.

00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:37.490
The rivolis come in different sizes, so you
have to make sure to use the right size.

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:38.900
KRISTAL: Good to know, yeah.

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:44.480
The tip would be set up your rivoli with your
component and bezel, so make sure they're

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:45.580
the same sizes.

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:49.050
CYNTHIA: And then Kabela also have some great
components.

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:50.450
KRISTAL: Oh, I love Kabela.

00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:52.800
CYNTHIA: Yes, where you just put the rivoli
inside.

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:58.770
Something to know, that is a rivoli have a
pointy back, so when you choose a setting,

00:06:58.770 --> 00:07:02.680
make sure that there is a little curve inside.

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:03.680
KRISTAL: Good to know.

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:08.110
So the setting inside has to be concave for
that pointy back to fit into.

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:09.110
CYNTHIA: Exactly.

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:10.110
KRISTAL: That's important.

00:07:10.110 --> 00:07:12.380
CYNTHIA: So like those two filigree.

00:07:12.380 --> 00:07:16.200
I was able to do that, yes.

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:17.200
KRISTAL: Perfect.

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:18.530
Those are great ideas.

00:07:18.530 --> 00:07:20.090
Oh, I love this.

00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:22.370
CYNTHIA: They're so colorful, so easy to play
with.

00:07:22.370 --> 00:07:27.430
KRISTAL: Yeah, and it looks like it would
be perfect for beginners, like somebody who

00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:31.740
hasn't made a single piece of jewelry ever
in their life, they could just dive into this

00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:33.830
and have a good time.

00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:34.830
CYNTHIA: Exactly.

00:07:34.830 --> 00:07:35.830
KRISTAL: Nice.

00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:38.740
Well thanks, Cynthia, for sharing rivoli delights.

00:07:38.740 --> 00:07:43.200
