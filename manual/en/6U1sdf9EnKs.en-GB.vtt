00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.030
Sony Xperia C3.
Expected August 2014.

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:21.680
"Selfie" seems to be one of the key buzzwords
of 2014, and the Sony Xperia C3 tries to ride

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:26.939
this somewhat narcissistic phenomenon with
a 5 megapixel front-facing camera and a big

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:32.340
5.5" screen just in case you have long arms.

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.980
The front camera has a wide-angle lens with
a soft LED flash, 720p video recording plus

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.570
a whole bunch of software enhancements to
allow you to retouch and enhance your self-portrait..

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.770
and yes, you can even make yourself look more
beautiful than you are. On the other side

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:55.050
is a conventional 8 megapixel camera also
with an LED flash and 1080p capture.

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:02.219
The display is big but not particularly high
resolution, coming in at 5.5" and 720 x 1280

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:07.920
pixels. It should still be a good quality
display as it uses Sony's TRILUMINOS technology.

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:15.050
This all makes it a fairly large handset at
156 x 79 x 7.6mm and 150 grams, but it is

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:18.510
hardly a brick.

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:26.320
Inside the Xperia C3 is rather modestly specified
with a 1.2GHz quad-core CPU, 1GB of RAM, 8GB

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:34.310
of flash storage plus a microSD slot, a decently-sized
2500 mAh battery. The Xperia C3 supports LTE

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:40.380
bands 1, 3, 7, 8 and 28, has NFC and comes
with an FM radio plus of course all the usual

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:45.100
features such as WiFi, GPS and GLONASS support,
Bluetooth 4.0 and everything else that goes

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.860
into a modern smartphone.

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:54.400
This is a dual-SIM Android 4.4 KitKat device
with all the Sony enhancements you would expect,

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:59.240
and Sony say that it should start shipping
from August onwards (first in China) in Black,

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.440
White and Mint colour schemes. No guidance
was given on price, but we would think that

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:08.770
it will be a little more expensive than the
upcoming Xperia T3 and will retail for between

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:16.780
€300 to €350.
