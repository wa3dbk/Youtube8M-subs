00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:05.050
Today I’m going to tell you why for some
people, UV rays are like…

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:06.540
crack.

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.470
And stay tuned until the end of this episode
for the question

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:11.110
of the day; if you answer it correctly,

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:14.070
you'll have a chance to win a free skincare
product!

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:15.070
Hello,

00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:16.900
I'm Dr. Neal Schultz

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:17.900
[pause]

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:22.780
And welcome to DermTV.

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:24.880
Some people always love to be tan.

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:26.810
Do you know why?

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:30.300
Your gut reaction, as is mine, might be that
they just like

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.710
the look of a tan.

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:34.149
But the journal of Addiction Biology

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:36.420
recently published research that indicated

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:37.940
there is more going on.

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.620
In fact, tanning can be addictive!

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:43.390
This new research showed that the UV rays

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:47.569
that cause tanning also cause changes in brain
activity

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:49.479
during tanning sessions that actually mimic

00:00:49.479 --> 00:00:52.839
the same patterns seen in drug addiction…

00:00:52.839 --> 00:00:54.140
I know.

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:55.289
It sounds far out.

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.700
I couldn’t believe it either!

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.719
Without over simplifying, several parts of
the brain

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:03.530
that play a role in addiction are activated

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.930
when we’re frequently exposed to UV tanning
rays,

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:09.210
such as once a week or more often.

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:10.450
And the study showed that

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:13.990
the brains of frequent tanners have the same
changes

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:16.560
as those of addicts.

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:17.860
These results may help explain why

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:23.649
many people tan compulsively: 30 million in
tanning salons alone

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:26.299
despite awareness about the real risks

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:29.210
such as premature skin aging, wrinkles

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:31.880
and of course skin cancer.

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:36.700
Some continue to tan even after having skin
cancer!

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.539
While people who frequently tan claim they
just like the look

00:01:39.539 --> 00:01:43.670
of their tan, we now know that tanning is
actually an addiction,

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:47.170
and as with any addiction, a hard one to break.

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:50.810
I hope this episode serves as another reason

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:54.880
to avoid unprotected, damaging UV exposure:

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:55.880
You can get addicted.

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.840
If you want a tan, by all means get one.

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.090
But get it from a bottle.

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:03.609
And if you want to go in the sun, I won’t
stop you,

00:02:03.609 --> 00:02:06.450
just make sure to protect yourself when you
do,

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:10.220
to help avoid premature aging, wrinkles, skin
cancer

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:16.890
and also an addiction that can be fatal!

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:19.980

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:35.620
So now that you know that tanning can be addictive...

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:37.960
Which are the UV rays that cause tanning?

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:40.570
UVA or UVB?

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:41.570
Don't forget.

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:56.540
