Hello everyone and welcome to the art of cooking
channel

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:08.960
Today we're gonna make together
Ramen burger

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:12.820
The ingredients.

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:21.830
For one burger, you'll need 1 packet of ramen,
1 beef patty, 1 egg, vegetable oil, green

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:27.929
onion, arugula, soy sauce and ketchup.

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:30.679
2.

00:00:30.679 --> 00:00:32.210
Cook the ramen.

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:35.950
Prepare the ramen according to the package's
instructions.

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:39.770
Drain off excess liquid and let it cool for
like 10 minutes

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:43.120
3.

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:47.760
Mix the egg into the ramen until thoroughly
blended.

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.140
4.

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:52.400
Form the ramen "buns."

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:58.760
Spray the inside of two deep, flat-bottom
bowls with cooking spray and divide the ramen-egg

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:01.270
mixture equally among them.

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:07.620
Press the noodles into the bottoms of the
dishes to form discs, then cover with saran

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:09.640
wrap.

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:11.660
5.

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:16.290
Weight the "buns" with a heavy glass, can
or jar.

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:20.050
Soup cans and jam jars work well here.

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:25.050
Place both bowls in the refrigerator for about
30 minutes.

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:26.130
6.

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:31.909
Invert the "buns" onto a pre-heated skillet.

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:38.690
Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a non-stick skillet
on medium-high heat.

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:44.450
Remove the bowls from the refrigerator, remove
the saran wrap and invert one of the "buns"

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.460
over the pan.

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.490
7.

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:54.690
Cook for 4 to 5 minutes until golden brown
on one side.

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:56.260
Then flip.

00:01:56.260 --> 00:02:03.830
After you've flipped it, you should only need
about 2 to 3 minutes more to cook it thoroughly.

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:05.340
8.

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:09.070
Slice green onion.

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:11.890
9.

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:17.549
Prepare the beef patty to your liking and
top with arugula, green onion, soy sauce,

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:22.069
ketchup and whatever else you like.

00:02:22.069 --> 00:02:24.819
10.

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:30.549
taste tour work, taste your recipe and enjoy
