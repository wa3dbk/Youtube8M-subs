00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:40.130
Vincent Malloy is seven years old
He's always polite and does what he's

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:43.790
told
For a boy his age, he's considerate and

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:50.790
nice
But he wants to be just like Vincent Price

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:05.210
He doesn't mind living with his sister,
dog and cats

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:12.210
Though he'd rather share a home with spiders
and bats

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:21.479
There he could reflect on the horrors he's
invented

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:32.960
And wander dark hallways, alone and tormented

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:43.430
Vincent is nice when his aunt comes to see
him

00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:50.430
But imagines dipping her in wax for his wax
museum

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:05.390
He likes to experiment on his dog Abercrombie
In the hopes of creating a horrible zombie

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:12.390
So he and his horrible zombie dog
Could go searching for victims in the London

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:18.040
fog

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.910
His thoughts, though, aren't only of ghoulish
crimes

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.410
He likes to paint and read to pass some of
the times

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:27.680
While other kids read books like Go, Jane,
Go!

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.810
Vincent's favourite author is Edgar Allen
Poe

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:38.620
One night, while reading a gruesome tale
He read a passage that made him turn pale

00:02:38.620 --> 00:02:45.620
Such horrible news he could not survive
For his beautiful wife had been buried alive!

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:52.019
He dug out her grave to make sure she was
dead

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:59.019
Unaware that her grave was his mother's
flower bed

00:02:59.049 --> 00:03:03.840
His mother sent Vincent off to his room
He knew he'd been banished to the tower

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.480
of doom
Where he was sentenced to spend the rest of

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:14.209
his life
Alone with the portrait of his beautiful wife

00:03:14.209 --> 00:03:19.489
While alone and insane encased in his tomb
Vincent's mother burst suddenly into the

00:03:19.489 --> 00:03:22.810
room
She said: "If you want to, you can go out

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:29.810
and play
It's sunny outside, and a beautiful day"

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:35.380
Vincent tried to talk, but he just couldn't
speak

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:40.959
The years of isolation had made him quite
weak

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:43.900
So he took out some paper and scrawled with
a pen:

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:49.720
"I am possessed by this house, and can never
leave it again"

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:53.560
His mother said: "You're not possessed,
and you're not almost dead

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:56.090
These games that you play are all in your
head

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:59.470
You're not Vincent Price, you're Vincent
Malloy

00:03:59.470 --> 00:04:03.030
You're not tormented or insane, you're
just a young boy

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:08.690
You're seven years old and you are my son
I want you to get outside and have some real

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:09.699
fun."

00:04:09.699 --> 00:04:12.410
Her anger now spent, she walked out through
the hall

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:16.430
And while Vincent backed slowly against the
wall

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:21.959
The room started to swell, to shiver and creak
His horrid insanity had reached its peak

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:28.750
He saw Abercrombie, his zombie slave
And heard his wife call from beyond the grave

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:32.310
She spoke from her coffin and made ghoulish
demands

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:35.669
While, through cracking walls, reached skeleton
hands

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:42.669
Every horror in his life that had crept through
his dreams

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:50.110
Swept his mad laughter to terrified screams!
To escape the madness, he reached for the

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:57.050
door
But fell limp and lifeless down on the floor

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:04.050
His voice was soft and very slow
As he quoted The Raven from Edgar Allen Poe:

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:10.680
"and my soul from out that shadow
that lies floating on the floor

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:17.680
shall be lifted?
Nevermore..."
