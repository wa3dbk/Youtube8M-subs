Hi, Youtubes welcome to a new video for the Deborah Milano Beauty Club

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:21.469
And I received their new gel effect nail polishes, so I was really happy with them, and I saw a yellow polish

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:26.780
So of course my first nail art is going to be with the yellow polish because I liked them so much

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:33.409
And I'm just going to keep on posting videos with yellow colors until you all like yellow nail polish

00:00:33.409 --> 00:00:36.139
So let's take a look at my tutorial

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:41.989
I started with pret-A-Porter 01 french manicure as my base this step is not necessary

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.879
But I prefer to use the base color because I don't want the visible nail line

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:52.518
you only need to use one coat because you don't see the white color anymore when we're done if

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:56.689
You want to use the white color in your design then apply two coats

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:00.660
Let's start with gel effect number 12.

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:04.040
I'm making 8 lines and give them a little curve

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:10.510
After each line I apply some new polish on my brush

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.320
When I'm satisfied with the lines I'm going to make them a little thicker

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:27.970
Now I'm using number 21

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:34.510
I'm applying this pink polish next to the yellow lines remember to keep some space for the third color

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:39.320
I always apply the polish first on a piece of paper

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:43.639
And then dip my brush in if you notice the polish is harder to use

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:49.339
take a new drop of Polish because the previous one is probably already too, dry I

00:01:50.069 --> 00:01:55.789
Also clean my nail art brush with some nail polish remover after a couple of lines so it's easier to work with

00:01:56.459 --> 00:02:01.429
It already looks really cool, and if you want you can leave it like this and just apply the topcoat

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:03.859
But I am going to add a third color

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:09.348
Now I'm using number 11. I'm going to fill in the final parts right now

00:02:09.349 --> 00:02:14.328
You can't really see the difference between the pink and orange but I promise you that when it's done

00:02:14.329 --> 00:02:16.329
I will show you how cool it looks

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:31.130
when you're done, it's time for cleanup, just use an eyeliner brush and some acetone or nail polish remover

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.369
Of course don't forget the topcoat

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:43.260
And here's how it looks when the top coat is dry, and no direct sunlight

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:47.040
So thanks for watching and I will see you next time bye. Bye
