00:00:04.649 --> 00:00:09.740
The top ten food myths are that low fat equals
healthy.

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:14.999
You actually need fat in your diet to protect
your joints, to feed your brain.

00:00:14.999 --> 00:00:22.019
And a lot of low-fat processed foods are filled
with extra sugar and salt and preservatives

00:00:22.019 --> 00:00:23.779
to make them taste good.

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:28.320
So, low-fat foods may actually be worse for
you than their high fat versions.

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.669
Another food myth is that baked foods are
healthier than fried foods.

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:37.790
Many baked foods are actually just as bad
for you, in terms of your cardiovascular health

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:39.159
and your insulin levels.

00:00:39.159 --> 00:00:45.670
A lot of baked foods that you'll find in packages
are filled with extra salt and extra sugar,

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:49.230
and may actually be filled with trans-fats
as well.

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.270
Another top ten food myth is that wooden cutting
boards are not safe.

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:59.360
Actually, wooden cutting boards will protect
you from bacterial contamination.

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:03.189
Just because you're cutting into the board
with a knife doesn't mean the bacteria are

00:01:03.189 --> 00:01:05.939
gonna harbor their way into the wood.

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:10.350
When you clean it properly with hot water
and soap, you're getting rid of all the surface

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:11.350
bacteria.

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:15.510
And actually using plastic cutting boards
over time will cause little pieces of plastic

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:19.570
to chip off into your food, which you don't
need.

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:24.510
Salads can be a health food, but that might
be a myth if you're building your salads improperly.

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:30.100
You can make a great salad with lots of healthy
fruits and vegetables, even nuts and seeds.

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:36.060
But if you're using your salad as a way to
get your Baco's and high fat, and highly sugared

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.650
dressing into your body, it's not such a health
food anymore.

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:43.410
It can be a myth that chicken is a healthy
meat.

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:48.229
Chicken can be healthy if it's organic, and
if it's not fried, if you choose to eat animal

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:49.229
proteins.

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:54.450
But, if you're eating your chicken and it's
deep fried, or it's not organic, then it's

00:01:54.450 --> 00:02:00.550
definitely being fed things like, growth hormones,
antibiotics and even arsenic, which can show

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:02.670
up in the meat that you consume.

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:08.640
So, be sure to choose organic chicken and
either bake it or saute it, but don't fry

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:09.640
it.

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:15.579
It is a myth that you need dairy in your diet
to grow or maintain healthy bones.

00:02:15.579 --> 00:02:21.389
There are countless cultures around this planet
that do not have dairy as a traditional food

00:02:21.389 --> 00:02:22.389
source.

00:02:22.389 --> 00:02:26.279
And they have no problem maintaining healthy
bones, and avoiding osteoporosis.

00:02:26.279 --> 00:02:31.359
So, it's a myth that you need to get your
calcium from dairy.

00:02:31.359 --> 00:02:36.909
Get your calcium instead from healthier choices
that are low fat and cholesterol free, like

00:02:36.909 --> 00:02:41.720
green leafy veggies, and sea vegetables, and
nuts and seeds.

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:46.670
Another top food myth, is that you shouldn't
eat after 9:00 pm at night.

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:51.779
Well, that may be true for some people, some
of the time, but you're not necessarily going

00:02:51.779 --> 00:02:56.849
to gain a lot of weight or ruin your night's
sleep, if you eat after 9:00 o'clock.

00:02:56.849 --> 00:03:01.540
If you're staying up late, or if you work
the night shift, and it depends on what you

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:03.279
eat at night, as well.

00:03:03.279 --> 00:03:07.659
Maybe you're having an apple or a few crackers
before bed.

00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:11.260
That's not going to ruin your diet, or your
good health intentions.

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:16.629
There is a myth that sea salt has less sodium,
and I'm here to tell you that sea salt has

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:20.519
the same amount of sodium as other, regular
table salts.

00:03:20.519 --> 00:03:26.209
But, sea salt might have some trace elements
and minerals in it that you're not getting

00:03:26.209 --> 00:03:29.950
from refined white, granular table salt.

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:34.599
It's a myth that brown sugar is healthier
for you than white sugar, they're basically

00:03:34.599 --> 00:03:35.620
the same thing.

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:40.069
They've just added some of the molasses that
they've stripped away to create whit sugar,

00:03:40.069 --> 00:03:42.459
and added it back in for color and flavor.

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:47.340
So, brown sugar is basically white sugar with
a little coloring added to it.

00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:52.780
The final myth is that you've just exercised
so you need a sports drink, that's not really

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:53.780
true.

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:58.379
Humans have somehow evolved this far without
sports drinks.

00:03:58.379 --> 00:04:04.439
You can exercise all day and get by perfectly
well with good, clean, water, and a nice healthy

00:04:04.439 --> 00:04:05.439
meal.

00:04:05.439 --> 00:04:09.269
So, these were my top ten food myths that
you can use to help you start making better

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:09.980
choices.
