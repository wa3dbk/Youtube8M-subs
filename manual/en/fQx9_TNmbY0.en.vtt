Hello, this is JB, I'm with Austin Homebrew
Supply in Austin, Texas. Today we are talking

00:00:06.009 --> 00:00:11.660
about beer-making equipment and wine-making
equipment. Well specifically right now I want

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:18.630
to talk about some beer-making equipment and
this particular apparatus that I'm about to

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:29.349
show you is called a pre-chiller, or a pre-wort
chiller. So this little guy here looks a lot

00:00:29.349 --> 00:00:36.309
like our standard wort chiller. Now, what
a wort chiller does, is, and I'm going to

00:00:36.309 --> 00:00:42.570
bring one into the shot here. A wort chiller
is something that you would put down into

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:49.769
the beer at the end of the boil and you would
run cool water from your tap, from your either

00:00:49.769 --> 00:00:56.289
garden hose connection or from inside we have
a little adapter that enables you to adapt

00:00:56.289 --> 00:01:02.390
it to your faucet. Where you simply hook this
up, off the female end and run cool water

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:09.700
through it. Well in the South, we are in Austin,
Texas, it's not real cool in summer is around

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:16.140
here. It's really hot. So subsequently a lot
of folks will use a pre-chiller. So this is

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:21.950
a pre-chiller. What's the concept? You take
your garden hose water, you run it through

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:30.040
this guy and you put this guy into a big bucket
of ice water. So what it does it runs through

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:37.310
the, the tap water will run through the ice
water, chilling it down so that when you take

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:43.010
the male connection, you hook it up with the
female from the work chiller itself. Once

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:49.469
the water gets to the chiller, it's already
pre-chilled a little bit. So this guy really

00:01:49.469 --> 00:01:56.479
helps if your water is hot coming out of your
tap, if your water is fairly cool, maybe below

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:02.479
you know seventy degrees or so, you are probably
okay with this guy. But if your water is hot

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:06.830
coming out of the tap like it is here in Texas,
a pre-chiller really helps.
