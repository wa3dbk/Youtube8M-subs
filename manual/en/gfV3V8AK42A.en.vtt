Hi, this is Sean Hobson, for Expert Village.
One of the fun things you can do with linebackers

00:00:05.419 --> 00:00:13.200
is called to stunt or to blitz. That means
we'll take our linebackers and put them on

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.830
an all out run through the line to try to
stop the play in the backfield with the running

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:24.289
back or to try to get to a quarterback. You
have to make your decision. When you call

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:30.109
blitz, you're selling this guy out. He no
longer has his gap responsibilities. He no

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:35.020
longer has to read the play and react to the
play. He has one job. That job is to go as

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:40.320
hard as he possibly can through the gap and
try to get to that quarterback and make a

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:48.519
stop in the backfield. The first thing we
want to talk about is the stunt. The stunt

00:00:48.519 --> 00:00:53.280
is showing, when you have a defensive lineman
down in his stance, you're going to bring

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:58.220
your linebackers up and show that they're
going to blitz. They're going to come up real

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:04.110
quick. Sometimes you can stunt and drop them
back. Sometimes you stunt them and then blitz

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:09.369
them. The first thing we'll show is what it
looks like to stunt up into the holes (video

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:15.260
demo). They're going to stunt up, they're
going to be ready, and then they can return

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:30.909
back. The next thing is called a stunt into
a blitz (video demo). That's a

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:38.390
stunt to a blitz. The last thing we have is
the all out blitz. That means the linebackers

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:48.049
make the decision to go all out through (video
demo). They are going as hard as they can

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:52.860
to get into the backfield. Most of the time
you will not blitz both linebackers. You'll

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:57.350
either blitz up the middle, or you'll blitz
from the right, or you'll blitz from the left.

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:01.119
You don't want to waste all those guys if
they don't get to the quarterback. That's

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:03.490
what you call a stunt and a blitz.
