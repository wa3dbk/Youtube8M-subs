00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:06.000
Whoa, it's so high, dude...look...

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:08.000
Look, they look like little ants...

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:08.700
Look...

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.500
...cool, dude!

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:12.200
I doing...

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:14.500
...basic...meditation...

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:17.000
...to "levitating".

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:19.900
Mind being capable...

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.700
...of dominate egg.

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.700
Whoa, cool, that's intense, 
my brother, that's intense!

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:27.500
It's like flying...

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:29.600
...but levitating, 
my brother...look...

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:31.500
...look...you get it?, 
you connect, bro...?

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:32.300
I do...

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.200
...but you...shutting up...

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:35.500
That means, shut up...

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.100
...to allow Zen,

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:39.800
Master Egg, 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.400
meditation...

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.200
...to jump into the void...

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:44.500
...without consequences...

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.300
     Wait, wait, wait, wait, 
wait, wait...WAIT, brother! Look...

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:49.900
First, tie yourself up, dude...

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.100
...to avoid detachment of
your body and soul, brother...

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.200
...I mean, you get it?,

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.500
so you don't meet the 
 #$%&amp; Reaper, dude...

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:59.900
  And I said "#$%&amp;", 
but it doesn't matter.

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.300
So you don't kiss,

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:04.300
   that light that turns on
at the end of the tunnel, dude...

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:09.200
           As all the living dead say,
"the living dead", whoa, that's intense, dude...

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:12.100
I don't know what I'm saying, dude, 
  but there's no light, is it?...

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:13.500
...or isn't, dude?

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:14.900
Don't jump, my brother...

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.400
You shut your snout!

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:17.700
Shut up! Shut up!

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:20.900
Whoa, so you'll jump to the void
   without tying yourself up?

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.400
    Whoa, cool, I want to witness
the presence of your "flying", dude...

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:26.700
Go, dude, go...

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:34.900
Holy shit!

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:36.100
What a thump!

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:37.800
It hurt like a f*cker!

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.000
Dude...

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:46.300
  ...you didn't add enough ketchup to your burger,
my bro, what a good blow, my bro, what a good blow...

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.800
Look, look...here I come, dude,
     here I come, dude...

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:52.100
Whoa!

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:56.500
This was indeed effective, my brother...
look the cherubs, the cherubs...

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:57.900
What's your name, chubby cheeked?

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
Come here, chubby cheeky...
