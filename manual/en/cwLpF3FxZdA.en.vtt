Hey Cookaholics, Chef Kendra here and today
we're making pepperoni pizza but what's cool

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:17.170
about this pepperoni pizza is the crust is
do fat to make.

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:21.779
Very fast, very easy, so you can make pizza
any day of the week.

00:00:21.779 --> 00:00:25.440
Alright, let's do what we do and head into
the kitchen and make it happen.

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:29.020
Ok guys, we have our stuff ready as per usual.

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:31.829
You to preheat your oven to 450 degrees.

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:37.040
We're pouring water into this bowl and the
next thing we're going to do is add the yeast.

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.670
Now make sure that water is warm.

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:42.730
Now we're going to add some honey.

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:45.120
You can also use sugar if that's your thing.

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.050
So now we're going to stir that up a bit.

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:52.690
We have some regular cornmeal here and we're
just going to dust our 12 inch pizza pan with

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:53.690
the cornmeal and set it aside.

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:57.230
Now we're going to add some flour to our bowl
not hat our yeast has bloomed.

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:03.880
We are tossing in some olive oil, some salt.

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:06.640
Some Italian seasoning and some garlic powder.

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:11.770
Now we're going to give this a good stir just
until it comes together.

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:15.100
Here you can knead it, use your food processor.

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:22.350
I'm using my kitchen aid with the dough hook
to knead it for five minutes.

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.950
Toss a little flour on the board and shape
the dough.

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:26.780
Slide it on to our pizza pan.

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:29.549
We're going to drop down our sauce.

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:33.150
If you need a terrific pizza sauce recipe

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.799
Spread the sauce on.

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:40.549
Toss down some mozzarella cheese, I'm also
using a little parmesan cheese but you can

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:41.929
stick with mozzarella cheese.

00:01:41.929 --> 00:01:46.560
Dropping down those pepperoni boys, and make
sure you use a good pepperoni.

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.979
Some brands suck.

00:01:48.979 --> 00:01:53.909
Bake this guy off for 15-20 minutes and that's
all it is to it.

00:01:53.909 --> 00:02:01.580
