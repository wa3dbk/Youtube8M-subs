00:00:06.965 --> 00:00:09.176
Hi, today we'll be looking and 
listening 

00:00:09.176 --> 00:00:11.887
to the most recent version of 
Beachtek's preamplifier...

00:00:11.887 --> 00:00:14.250
the DXA-SLR PRO!

00:00:15.307 --> 00:00:18.018
This is the most advanced and 
complete model

00:00:18.018 --> 00:00:21.480
offered by the well known 
company.

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:27.653
It has a very solid construction
with a strong aluminum chasis.

00:00:27.653 --> 00:00:33.242
It's specifically designed to be
used with DSLR cameras

00:00:33.242 --> 00:00:38.580
it's shape adapts perfectly to 
their bodies.

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:42.584
It can also be mounted on any 
other part of your rig 

00:00:42.584 --> 00:00:47.297
thanks to it's 1/4"-20 threaded 
hole and screw.

00:00:47.297 --> 00:00:52.177
It allows the use of 
professional XLR microphones

00:00:52.177 --> 00:00:56.640
with cameras that don't feature 
this option.

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:04.273
12V or 48V phantom power is 
provided depending on the 
situation.

00:01:04.273 --> 00:01:06.483
It has two gain settings...

00:01:06.483 --> 00:01:14.074
giving up to an extra 20dB of 
strength to our microphone's 
signal.

00:01:14.074 --> 00:01:19.121
Each channel can be adjusted 
independently

00:01:19.121 --> 00:01:22.958
by using the included LCD screen
and meters.

00:01:22.958 --> 00:01:28.005
A headphone jack allows us to 
listen to our recordings in real
time,

00:01:28.005 --> 00:01:31.967
something that’s not possible 
with some cameras.

00:01:31.967 --> 00:01:35.554
It comes equipped with limiters 
that protect our signal 

00:01:35.554 --> 00:01:38.348
and prevent it from clipping.

00:01:38.348 --> 00:01:42.728
It can also disable the AGC of 
the camera...

00:01:42.728 --> 00:01:49.901
a useful option to get quality 
results with some DSLR models.

00:01:49.901 --> 00:01:54.531
Lastly, it uses a single 9V 
battery for energy

00:01:54.531 --> 00:01:59.328
and a coiled 3.5mm cable is 
included.

00:01:59.328 --> 00:02:02.751
Now, let's listen to the audio 
recorded by the

00:02:02.751 --> 00:02:06.835
internal microphone of our 
camera, the Canon T3i.
28
00:02:06,835 --&gt; 00:02:06,250
This is the internal microphone 
of the Canon T3i...

00:02:09.671 --> 00:02:11.423
you can understand what I’m 
saying but there's

00:02:11.423 --> 00:02:13.675
probably a lot of hiss and noise
in the background.

00:02:13.675 --> 00:02:16.500
1, 2, 3... testing sound.

00:02:17.137 --> 00:02:21.183
Now we'll plug a RODE NTG-2 
microphone directly

00:02:21.183 --> 00:02:27.000
to the camera with an XLR to 
3.5mm cable.

00:02:27.814 --> 00:02:31.860
This is the RODE NTG-2 plugged 
directly into the Canon T3i. 

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.071
It should sound better than the 
previous example

00:02:34.071 --> 00:02:36.406
but it's not the most 
recommended option.

00:02:36.406 --> 00:02:39.743
1, 2, 3... testing sound.

00:02:39.743 --> 00:02:43.997
Now, we'll plug the microphone 
into the DXA-SLR PRO...

00:02:43.997 --> 00:02:46.541
and then into the camera.

00:02:46.541 --> 00:02:50.128
Next, we'll lower the internal 
gain on the Canon T3i

00:02:50.128 --> 00:02:53.000
to let the Beachtek do the work.

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:58.929
This is the RODE NTG-2 plugged 
into the Beachtek DXA-SLR PRO...

00:02:58.929 --> 00:03:00.555
plugged into the Canon T3i. 

00:03:00.555 --> 00:03:03.809
The audio should sound much 
better than before because

00:03:03.809 --> 00:03:07.229
it now has a stronger signal 
with less hiss in the 
background.

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:10.500
1, 2, 3... testing sound.

00:03:11.024 --> 00:03:15.112
The preamplifier can also be 
used between the microphone 

00:03:15.112 --> 00:03:18.448
and an external recorder like 
the Zoom H4n. 

00:03:18.448 --> 00:03:23.745
This produces a clean signal 
with the best recording quality.

00:03:23.745 --> 00:03:31.250
Plus, it gives us better 
physical controls to adjust our 
gain.

00:03:32.421 --> 00:03:37.759
This is the RODE NTG-2 plugged 
into the Beachtek DXA-SLR PRO...

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:39.761
plugged into the Zoom H4n. 

00:03:39.761 --> 00:03:42.514
It should be sounding excellent 
right now and it's only 

00:03:42.514 --> 00:03:45.475
disadvantage is having to sync 
the audio in postproduction.

00:03:45.475 --> 00:03:48.812
1, 2, 3... testing sound.

00:03:48.812 --> 00:03:50.939
Here's another comparison...

00:03:50.939 --> 00:03:57.000
this time using a very 
inexpensive dynamic microphone.

00:03:57.237 --> 00:04:09.250
1, 2, 3... testing sound.

00:04:09.791 --> 00:04:14.212
We have found that when using 
this model with a DSLR...

00:04:14.212 --> 00:04:17.048
it's necessary to unscrew them 
to be able to change

00:04:17.048 --> 00:04:18.550
the batteries of the camera. 

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:22.721
This translates into lost time 
when working.

00:04:22.721 --> 00:04:26.725
We have also noticed that the 9V
battery tray

00:04:26.725 --> 00:04:29.186
doesn't feel as solid as the 
rest of the product

00:04:29.186 --> 00:04:33.774
and it always seems to stay a 
bit loose when closed.

00:04:33.774 --> 00:04:36.276
The Beachtek offers very good 
sound quality

00:04:36.276 --> 00:04:38.320
and a great set of professional 
tools that

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:40.822
provide a lot of control over 
your recordings. 

00:04:40.822 --> 00:04:44.750
It's definitely an excellent 
option if you seek professional 
results.
