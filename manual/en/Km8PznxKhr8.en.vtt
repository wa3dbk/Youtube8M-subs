00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.980
New Cardboard Minoriko 1

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:06.510
One

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:07.380
Oneechan, there's someone I like
 

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:10.310
Oneechan, there's someone I like
Don't get romantically involved with a human

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:11.050
It's a cardboard, not a human
 

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:16.450
It's a cardboard, not a human
You said "someone"

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:17.650
I know what you're trying to say, Oneechan. I know it's wrong for a goddess to fall in love with a cardboard
 

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:22.380
I know what you're trying to say, Oneechan. I know it's wrong for a goddess to fall in love with a cardboard
I think something's wrong with your head

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:23.650
But I think it could pass in Greek mythology
 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:28.380
But I think it could pass in Greek mythology
It wouldn't pass even in Greek mythology

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:29.510
Two

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:30.380
So, I'm going to marry this paper
 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:34.310
So, I'm going to marry this paper
Do what you want

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:35.580
Oh! Now that I think about it, I'm a god [kami], and this is a paper [kami]!
 

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:39.310
Oh! Now that I think about it, I'm a god [kami], and this is a paper [kami]!
Who cares?

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:40.050
I'll be over there. Don't peek, okay?
 
 

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.780
I'll be over there. Don't peek, okay?
Are you going to weave a cloth or something?
[Reference to the Japanese folktale "The Crane Wife"]

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:44.510
It's our wedding night
 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:48.310
It's our wedding night
See you

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:49.710
Three

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:50.450
Listen, Oneechan!
 

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:53.450
Listen, Oneechan!
Oh, good morning

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:54.180
Morikawa-kun got all crumpled!
 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:59.580
Morikawa-kun got all crumpled!
Who's Morikawa-kun?

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:00.850
I was sleeping right by. Who could have done such a thing......!?
 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:05.610
I was sleeping right by. Who could have done such a thing......!?
You always toss and turn in your sleep

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:06.850
Who could have done such a thing!?
 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:11.650
Who could have done such a thing!?
I'm saying it was you

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:12.850
Four

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:17.580
I think this is the end for me. Good-bye

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:18.780
No! Morikawa-kun!
 

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.580
No! Morikawa-kun!
Oh, that was Morikawa-kun's line just now

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:28.510
[Morikawa-kun Number 2]
Ohh! Inside Morikawa-kun, there's Morikawa-kun Number 2!
 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:31.380
[Morikawa-kun Number 2]
Ohh! Inside Morikawa-kun, there's Morikawa-kun Number 2!
So the cardboard was the woman

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.680
Five

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:48.780
FWOOSH

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.780
Six

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:51.780
Good-bye, Morikawa-kun
 

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.780
Good-bye, Morikawa-kun
You're burnt, Minoriko

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:55.980
Oneechan, take me to my bed. I'll get better once I get some sleep
 
 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:56.780
Oneechan, take me to my bed. I'll get better once I get some sleep
I steamed some potato. Do you want some?
 

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.710
Oneechan, take me to my bed. I'll get better once I get some sleep
I steamed some potato. Do you want some?
Yeah

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:05.710
[peel]

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:07.180
I guess this is karma

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:11.750
......yeah

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:20.310
Thank you for watching
[Minoriko: I'll make sure Morikawa-kun Number 2 grows up to be a fine cardboard!
Shizuha: Good luck]
