00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:10.580
Hi. This Megan with Beadaholique.com
I'm going to show you how to

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:11.859
bead weave a star using

00:00:11.859 --> 00:00:14.839
brick stitch.

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:18.910
We do have a video on how to do

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:20.880
brick stitch and a video on how to do

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.439
a round circular brick stitch.

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:27.119
So go ahead and watch those if you
don't know how because that's what you're

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:29.039
going to use to make this.

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:36.039
To start you're actually just going to
do a piece of circular brick stitch that

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:40.520
is about as big as you want the middle
of your star to be without the points

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:41.370
and

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.829
if you want a five pointed star like I'm
doing you need to have the number of

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:48.930
beads on your last row be divisible by
five.

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:54.290
As you know if you know how to do circular
brick stitch or as you will pick up very

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:55.460
quickly if you

00:00:55.460 --> 00:00:57.719
are just learning

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.580
there's a little bit of wiggle room as far
as how many beads

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:03.550
you fit into the spaces.

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:06.240
So can you kind of play around

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:10.740
with the number of beads that you add a number
of rows that you do to get your final

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.350
count of beads divisible by five.

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.680
So I've this

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:19.440
piece here and it has 25 beads on the
outside a row.

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.460
So that's perfect.

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:24.030
I'll just to 5 beads

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:25.900
per point.

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.640
So now you're going to

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:29.720
do 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.590
a regular brick stitch

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:36.910
and you're just going to do five beads
and a regular brick stitch along

00:01:36.910 --> 00:01:42.710
that same edge in the next row.

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:44.829
So you'll always start brick stitch

00:01:44.829 --> 00:01:47.610
by adding two bead and skipping the first

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:54.610
thread bridge right there.

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.150
And don't add in extra beads

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:06.810
like you might in circular brick stitch.

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:12.809
Just go ahead and stretch them along
because they're just groups of five

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:16.389
so it won't make it

00:02:16.389 --> 00:02:22.129
buckle. It'll still lay flat.

00:02:22.129 --> 00:02:26.089
If you're trying to make a very large
star you may have to

00:02:26.089 --> 00:02:28.249
add in extra beads.

00:02:28.249 --> 00:02:31.449
If you're doing something smaller and
you're only going across

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:36.279
three or four or five you're probably fine.

00:02:36.279 --> 00:02:39.470
So do your five beads then you're going
to

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:42.719
stop and do a short row

00:02:42.719 --> 00:02:47.889
and you're going to continue to do the
brick stitch

00:02:47.889 --> 00:02:52.089
and then extra above those five beads.
Your going to go ahead and let it

00:02:52.089 --> 00:02:59.089
decrease as it naturally would

00:03:00.289 --> 00:03:02.269
because we want that point.

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:05.090
We want that pointy shape so

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:12.090
that's why this stitch works well with this.

00:03:22.029 --> 00:03:26.489
When you get to the end of your row

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:33.489
just turn and start a new row.

00:03:47.889 --> 00:03:49.139
And turn

00:03:49.139 --> 00:03:51.069
and do that last row

00:03:51.069 --> 00:03:53.789
of the regular brick stitch

00:03:53.789 --> 00:03:56.709
which we'll only have the two

00:03:56.709 --> 00:04:03.709
beads from the first edge

00:04:05.699 --> 00:04:10.209
and then you're going to pickup one bead

00:04:10.209 --> 00:04:13.909
and go back down the side

00:04:13.909 --> 00:04:17.290
opposite of where your threads coming out just

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:20.019
through those beads

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:22.639
that are part of

00:04:22.639 --> 00:04:27.289
the regular brick stitch did and you're
gonna come out next to that last row of

00:04:27.289 --> 00:04:30.139
beads in the circular brick stitch.

00:04:30.139 --> 00:04:33.900
when you pull it tight you can see you get that one
last bead that makes a nice little point for

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:36.410
your star.

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:37.740
And then before you

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:40.400
start again on the next point

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:42.030
take your needle

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:44.030
and go through the bead

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:45.929
just inside

00:04:45.929 --> 00:04:48.489
the point

00:04:48.489 --> 00:04:52.240
in that last row

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:55.749
and then you're going to go

00:04:55.749 --> 00:04:57.550
back up towards the outside

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:02.499
in the next one over.

00:05:02.499 --> 00:05:06.389
Now you're ready to make your next
point. So you will go just like you

00:05:06.389 --> 00:05:07.889
did on this one.

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:10.949
Pick up two beads and start a row of

00:05:10.949 --> 00:05:14.789
ladder stitch five beads long and go back
and forth

00:05:14.789 --> 00:05:17.250
and you're going to continue around if
you're

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:19.990
last row of beads was divisible by
five

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:21.360
then you will end up

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:23.459
finishing right where

00:05:23.459 --> 00:05:24.889
you started.

00:05:24.889 --> 00:05:26.239
And you well end up with

00:05:26.239 --> 00:05:28.219
a nice even star

00:05:28.219 --> 00:05:30.580
when you go back down.

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:32.179
And you're done

00:05:32.179 --> 00:05:33.740
and then you can just

00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:36.909
tie off your ends and weave them in.

00:05:36.909 --> 00:05:40.099
We also have a video on how
to do that if you're unfamiliar on how to do

00:05:40.099 --> 00:05:41.219
that.

00:05:41.219 --> 00:05:44.029
You have this nice brick stitch five
pointed star

00:05:44.029 --> 00:05:45.639
that you can use for

00:05:45.639 --> 00:05:46.499
all kinds of things.
