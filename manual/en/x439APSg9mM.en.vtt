00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:32.081
We are going to a botanical garden

00:00:32.081 --> 00:00:35.841
And then to lunch at a very, very cool restaurant

00:00:35.841 --> 00:00:37.021
Let's go do it!

00:00:37.021 --> 00:00:38.941
Parker: Fish!

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:42.239
Where? Whoa, look at those fish!

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:44.859
Those are some big fish!

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:48.780
So we are at Seaside Garden which is in
Carpentaria.

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.269
and it is a very cool place where you
can buy plants

00:00:52.269 --> 00:00:55.309
and they also have a bunch a plants on
display

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:59.260
and they had a bunch of people make these

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.320
beautiful walkways that have a
bunch of different

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:05.460
Plants on them. So we're gonna look at some plants!

00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:05.960
Right, Parker?

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:08.470
Okay.

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:10.210
Bailey: That's a silk tree.

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:12.200
Chris: A Silk tree?

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:14.147
Bailey: That's an Orchid tree

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.140
Chris: What are those?

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:17.480
Parker: Chickens.

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:25.400
Kids: Bawk! Bawk! Bawk!

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.240
They're loud. 

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:29.480
Chris: They're loud?

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.660
Was that fun guys? Did you like the gardens?

00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:35.460
Kids: Yeah.

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.360
Yeah. That was fun.

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:40.020
Jessica: I liked it!!!

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:43.290
I think Jessica was missing our--living here.

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:46.980
Because we used to live here. Not like--not in the garden.

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:50.240
Jessica: Since we've been kicked out of the garden it's been really rough.

00:01:50.259 --> 00:01:53.939
Yeah. Since those gnomes moved in!

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:55.940
Oh I was kinda going like a Garden of Eden thing.

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:00.680
Oh, you took it and you made it Biblical!

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:07.740
But we used to live here in Carpinteria. So if you live in Carpinteria come to Seaside Gardens and have the same adventure we did.

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:11.120
and then go to Padero grill and have fish tacos like we're gonna do!

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.240
But tag us on Instagram to do that.

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:18.720
And continuing our tour of Carpinteria we come to Padero Grill!

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.680
*Musical Fanfare*

00:02:23.690 --> 00:02:26.330
So this is the area you eat at at Padero Grill

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:29.230
and look over here ...

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:30.590
It's the OCEAN!

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:37.620
and train track. So hopefully a train'll
pass by and we'll get to wave to it or something.

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.280
But look at how beautiful this is.

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:42.440
I mean you could not want to eat anywhere other
than this.

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.420
Parker you like this place yeah

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:47.780
what do you see?

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:49.360
Parker: Baby.

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:57.620
Hey Bailey there are a lot of toys out
here to play with like a whole bunch

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:59.360
Bailey: This is one of the toys--

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:00.440
No that's trash.

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.394
Bailey: I actually found it in the toys section.

00:03:02.394 --> 00:03:04.029
Well, but it's--that's trash.

00:03:04.029 --> 00:03:07.120
That is the one thing out here that's acutually--it's trash

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.160
Can you go throw it away?

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.080
The Train!!!

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:18.920
Do you see the train?

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:37.500
Parker: Bye-bye train.

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:52.760
*Funky Dance Music*

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:55.851
We just got home from Padero Grill and
I love that place

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:59.269
it is so cool I've never been to a place
it's quite like that

00:03:59.269 --> 00:04:03.069
where its geared towards families not
just geared toward kids

00:04:03.069 --> 00:04:05.000
or geared towards adults

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.780
it geared toward the entire group

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:12.280
Because the parents can sit there enjoy the sunset or the ocean breeze

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:15.680
and the kids can I go out and play and use their imaginations

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:18.900
and and then you eat food and it's--I mean

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:22.690
just good stuff highly recommend that if you're ever in the Carpentaria area

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:25.130
safest beaches in the world

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:28.820
is their beach's slogan I don't know
if that's true but that's the slogan

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:30.530
Bailey made up a recipe today

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:33.780
and set it all up in the kitchen
including this

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:36.930
framed recipe that she wrote up

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:39.810
if you're interested in making it don't follow the recipe exactly

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:44.100
because we did omit the soy milk and we did more than one date

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:45.950
we used like a cup of dates

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:49.970
We actually ended up making this and this is what it looks like.

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:52.550
And I'm going to try one for the first time because I haven't tried one yet.

00:04:52.550 --> 00:04:54.382
I'm going to have this little nugget.

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:57.160
Boom!

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:02.840
Pretty good.

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:04.690
Yeah. It's like a homemade Lara Bar.

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:07.950
Hi.

00:05:07.950 --> 00:05:09.515
Let's talk about what we learned today.

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:16.220
We learned that chickens...

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:19.949
...are loud.

00:05:19.949 --> 00:05:25.970
We learned that anything can become a toy with the right amount of imagination.

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:31.360
and as long as it's not a piece of trash.

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:35.220
And finally we learned that

00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:41.460
if your gonna try a new recipe, the
best course of action

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:46.780
is to frame it so that people take you
seriously

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:51.900
I'll thanks for watching everybody
