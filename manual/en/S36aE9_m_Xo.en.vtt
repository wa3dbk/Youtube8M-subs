00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:04.970
Genetically modified crops are plants that
have been created by adding new genes using

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:09.840
methods of gene technology.

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:14.889
Most plant crops grown today have been created
by breeding.

00:00:14.889 --> 00:00:19.040
Breeding achieves introduction of new traits
into existing crop lines by crossing them

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:24.950
with other lines of the same crop that have
a desired trait.

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:29.410
During initial stages of breeding, all genes
of parental lines are recombined in a random

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:30.920
order.

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:35.290
Because resulting plants are quite a mix,
both genetically and phenotypically, they

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:39.480
are backcrossed to one of the parents, and
then backcrossed again several times until

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:45.320
the original genotype of the parent is restored
to large degree.

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:52.940
Now, think of the time it takes to do all
the backcrossing.

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:57.530
On average it takes about ten generations,
or five years of back crossing, to develop

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:04.199
a new variety of wheat by conventional breeding
methods.

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.189
Breeding a new variety of apples takes about
fifteen years.

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:14.650
Another challenge plant breeders face is that
they can only transfer genes between closely

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:18.289
related species.

00:01:18.289 --> 00:01:22.979
Even if there was, say, a very useful draught
tolerance gene in oranges, it could never

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:28.170
be transferred to apples by crossing.

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.499
These two limitations of breeding can be bypassed
by introducing genes into plant genome directly,

00:01:33.499 --> 00:01:35.490
either with Agrobacterium or with a gene gun.

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:44.829
A gene that is being introduced can be isolated
from a related plant species, isolated from

00:01:44.829 --> 00:01:49.020
a completely different organism, or it can
be designed on a computer and synthesized

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.039
in a test tube.

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:59.709
Agrobacterium tumefaciens is a soil microorganism
that can naturally transfer some of its DNA

00:01:59.709 --> 00:02:02.990
into plant cells.

00:02:02.990 --> 00:02:08.039
In wild Agrobacterium strains this DNA, called
transfer DNA, contains several genes that

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:13.200
hijack plant biochemical pathways and make
plant cells synthesize chemical compounds

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.910
that Agrobacterium uses for food.

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:22.950
Using methods of molecular cloning, all bacterial
genes on transfer DNA can be removed and replaced

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.560
with the genes of interest.

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:30.640
Agrobacterium then delivers these genes into
plant nucleus where they integrate into plant

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:34.470
genome.

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:39.170
Another technology widely used for plant transformation
is a gene gun.

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:44.460
Instead of inserting genes of interest into
Agrobacterium, the DNA is loaded onto microscopic

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:49.960
gold particles and it is literally shot into
plant cells.

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:54.510
Some of the gold particles land in cell nuclei
and DNA from them gets inserted into plant

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:57.230
chromosomes.

00:02:57.230 --> 00:03:07.180
Both Agrobacterim- and gene gun-mediated gene
delivery is done in plant tissue culture - little

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:12.930
clamps of plant cells that later on differentiate
and grow into actual plants.

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:18.820
So, in the form of breeding, genetic modification
of plants has been practiced for thousands

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:21.710
of years.

00:03:21.710 --> 00:03:26.010
Modern methods of gene technology make this
process faster, more precise, and open to

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:28.120
using genes from unrelated species.
