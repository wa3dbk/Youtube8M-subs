Handle the glass panels carefully and
protect the edges.

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.489
Remove the warranty sticker and save for

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:43.570
Before discarding the carton, check to
see that no small hardware parts have

00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:46.210
fallen to the bottom of the box.

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:53.210
Identify all parts using instruction
sheet as a reference.

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.070
To install your Basco bath

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.440
enclosure you'll need a tape measure, level, #2 phillips screw driver

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:04.710
a 3/16" wrench, hacksaw, clear silicone caulking

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.990
and drill with the 1/8" standard
drill bit in 3/16" tile masonry drill

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:12.060
bit

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.940
Start by measuring the opening at the
center the tub rim.

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:20.570
Measure and cut the tub track 1/16"
short of this dimension.

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:24.970
Place the tub track in the center of the
tub rim with the tall leg to the exterior.

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:28.040
For fiberglass or acrylic units,

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:32.480
it may be necessary to file a radius on
the ends of the tub track and wall jams

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:35.820
to match the corners of the enclosure.

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.100
Press both wall jams into position
over the tub track.

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.500
Use a level to plumb both wall jams.

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:47.460
Then mark the pre-drilled hole locations
on the wall. Lightly mark on the side

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.110
of the tub track with a pencil,

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.150
then remove all the parts.

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:56.880
For tile or marble walls drill six 3/16" diameter holes

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:03.000
and insert the plastic wall anchors. For
fiberglass or acrylic units,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.069
if reinforcement is built into the wall
or the unit drill six 1/8" holes to

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:11.209
install mounting screws directly into
the reinforcement.

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:14.750
Next, run a heavy bead of silicone caulk

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:19.900
inside the pencil marks on the tub rim.
Place the tub track in the exact pencil

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:20.989
marked positions

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:24.510
and press it firmly in the caulking.

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:27.410
Replace wall jams in the tub track and
attach

00:02:27.410 --> 00:02:31.650
each to the wall with one 8" X 1.5" truss head screw.

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:35.730
Slip a nylon spacer over the two middle
truss head screws

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:38.990
and install each into the center hole
of both wall jams.

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:42.660
Check each jam for plump, and tighten the screws,

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:49.260
being careful not to over tighten. The
6150/7150 bath enclosure is equipped

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:51.460
with safety T Lock wall jams.

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:55.740
When properly installed, the header is
permanently locked to the wall jams

00:02:55.740 --> 00:02:59.500
and cannot be accidentally dislodged. To
secure this,

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.580
measure the wall-to-wall opening at the
top of the wall jams

00:03:02.580 --> 00:03:06.060
and cut the header 1/16"
short of this dimension.

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:09.400
Check the header for fit.

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.520
Place the header on top of the wall jams,
making sure the Basco logo is

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:14.420
facing out.

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:18.750
Holding the header in position, carefully
twist the loose while jam

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:23.790
and fit into place inside the header.
Pivot the wall jam back into place,

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:27.230
press into position and attach it to the
wall with two

00:03:27.230 --> 00:03:31.390
8" X 1.5" truss
head screws inserted through the top and

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:33.650
bottom holes.

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:37.130
Attach the four nylon roller bearings to
the door panels using

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:40.130
8/32" by 3/8" hex head screws

00:03:40.130 --> 00:03:43.280
centered in the outside slots in the top
bearing fits.

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:47.930
Lift the interior panel with a rough
surface closest to the top, fit

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:51.750
into position with the rollers fitting
into the roller slide in the header.

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:56.110
For maximum waterproofing, position the
interior panel closest to the shower

00:03:56.110 --> 00:03:56.510
head.

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:01.880
Repeat this procedure for the exterior
panel. If the door panels are not

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:03.420
parallel to the wall jams,

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:06.910
remove them from the header and adjust
the rollers up or down.

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:13.300
Slide the four towel bar trim rings over
the clear acrylic towel bar brackets

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:16.609
and press the brackets into the ends at
the two towel bars.

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:20.400
Attach one towel bar simply to the
exterior panel

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:24.530
with the # 10 24" X 7/8"
inch truss head screw through the

00:04:24.530 --> 00:04:29.880
inner rail. Insert a # 10 24 X 1 1/8"  flat head screw

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:32.950
through an acrylic finger pull, then
through the outer rail

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:37.669
and into the outer towel bar bracket. Do
the same for the interior door panel.

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:43.160
Locate the nylon bottom guide in the
middle at the tub track with the door

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:43.780
panels.

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:48.100
With a 7/64" bit, drill a
hole into the v-groove

00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:51.840
through the mounting hole in the bottom
guide. Install the bottom guide with a

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:55.220
6" X 3/8" pan head screw through
the drilled hole.

00:04:55.220 --> 00:05:02.220
Slide the stainless steel bumper inserts
into the two soft vinyl jam bumpers.

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:06.020
Align the slides and the bumpers with the
outer rails at the door panels

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:10.419
and snap the bumpers downward over the center while jam screws with the nylon

00:05:10.419 --> 00:05:11.180
spacers.

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:17.050
Neatly silicon both the interior and
exterior of the entire unit where the

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:19.910
tub track and wall jams meet the top
tub or tile,

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:23.220
paying special attention to the interior
of the tub track.

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:27.250
