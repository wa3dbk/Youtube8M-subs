00:00:19.546 --> 00:00:27.546
well, well, I was shoting during the ride, 
 but.. I wasn't the one who's driving,

00:00:23.729 --> 00:00:30.729
we both had helmets, we were travelling at 30km/h with electric scooter,

00:00:29.121 --> 00:00:34.121
and was a street were the traffic higpoint is 3 cars. and a tractor.

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:43.590
and now we open the contest: what the hell was I thinking?

00:00:43.564 --> 00:00:49.564
after seeing my face you can leave a comment 
 writing what you think I was really thinking

00:00:48.364 --> 00:00:51.364
you could even win something XD

00:00:50.781 --> 00:00:57.781
then they'll explain me why they have to make 
 vlogs in Milan or Rome, those cities..

00:00:56.077 --> 00:01:00.077
where if you walk recording your face they think you're an idiot..

00:01:00.423 --> 00:01:03.423
while you can do it here, in the middle of.. nothing

00:01:03.326 --> 00:01:05.326
no, wait wait!

00:01:04.747 --> 00:01:07.747
no no it's really nothing.

00:01:14.684 --> 00:01:17.684
oh well, I was in a train going nowhere..

00:01:17.833 --> 00:01:24.833
this is my new 

00:01:27.402 --> 00:01:36.402
seen under Lana Del Rey video I received that comment 
 [beautiful like every video, could you make Gaga?]

00:01:34.905 --> 00:01:38.905
I said, ok, I'll try. indeed it's easy drawing in a train.

00:01:37.863 --> 00:01:41.860
while all's shaking. it's a piece of cake, no?

00:01:41.381 --> 00:01:48.380
the real problem is that I choose a photo 
 reference where Lady Gaga wasn't very recognizable

00:01:47.124 --> 00:01:53.120
it was difficul to me recognize her at least, but 
 I loved the pose and the expression so sweet

00:01:54.561 --> 00:02:06.560
she had not weird masks, no big glasses, no drag queen makeup, 
 all the ambaradam [ITA for big mess] of meat and sequins

00:02:07.164 --> 00:02:09.160
so she was allmost.. human.

00:02:10.167 --> 00:02:14.170
maybe it's the reason why I didn't recognize her 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:18.010
a bit it's cause i drew in the train, not a very comfortable situation..

00:02:17.735 --> 00:02:23.740
oh, it was what it is

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:27.750
but on Facebook you said you wanted to see the video anyway, so ok

00:02:27.009 --> 00:02:30.010
I used the same technique of the last time

00:02:29.497 --> 00:02:34.500
drew with the 2B, inked with my usual hurricane-proof pen

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:42.170
colored always with my Winsor &amp;amp; Newton watercolors

00:02:43.915 --> 00:02:51.920
like I said even the last time (but seen that people ask 
 me stuff I already said in the video itself, I repeat)

00:02:53.961 --> 00:02:57.960
it's a basic box with 12 colors I think, nothing special

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:09.060
and my usual waterbrush. in Italian I think it's calles Acqua-pen, by Koi Waterbrush

00:03:10.545 --> 00:03:13.540
and see 10000 has asked me where to buy it

00:03:13.006 --> 00:03:17.010
you can buy them in art &amp;amp; crafts shops or online

00:03:16.713 --> 00:03:20.710
they not expensive, I think around 5â‚¬

00:03:20.026 --> 00:03:25.030
(this is my beautiful Mars Plastic eraser by Staedler)

00:03:27.872 --> 00:03:32.870
they have no extreme prices, like said you can find them in internet

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:36.350
even for 5$, but you'd pay more for the shipping

00:03:35.583 --> 00:03:41.580
so better you check them online only if you're 
 planning to buy a lot of things

00:03:42.592 --> 00:03:45.590
so.. I decided to make the image oddish..

00:03:46.667 --> 00:03:52.670
half portrait, half weird necklace [I donno neither me what I'm saying]

00:03:54.250 --> 00:04:01.250
in another part I've added 2 X that 
 could barely cover ehm, y'know the breasts

00:04:03.659 --> 00:04:06.660
they're purely casual btw

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:09.400
I made the hair in 8 different colors

00:04:09.981 --> 00:04:18.980
and finally I tried to make the shadows with a dottish 
 way with the waterproof pen, on the dried colors

00:04:24.864 --> 00:04:33.860
here the X I was talking about.. anyway I finished to 
 color it during the rehearsals of my fiance's concert

00:04:34.393 --> 00:04:44.390
so in the end I'll leave you a bit of the music they 
 was trying.. and a partial view of him and his.. instrument

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:47.060
hope you'll like the image anyway, even if not my best one

00:04:51.301 --> 00:04:55.300
oh well, it's nice enough XD

00:04:56.161 --> 00:04:59.160
I wish you a happy new year

00:05:01.019 --> 00:05:05.020
PS. I accept suggestions in the comments for new pictures.!

00:05:05.497 --> 00:05:08.500
and never forget to smile!
