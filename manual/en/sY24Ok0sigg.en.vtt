00:00:04.421 --> 00:00:07.591
Excited about using your new phone, but feeling like things just

00:00:07.591 --> 00:00:10.052
aren't the same without your contacts and pictures from

00:00:10.052 --> 00:00:11.386
your old phone?

00:00:11.386 --> 00:00:14.765
AT&amp;T's new and improved Mobile Transfer app transfers your contacts,

00:00:14.765 --> 00:00:18.227
media, messages, phone records, and documents from your

00:00:18.227 --> 00:00:19.269
old phone to your new phone!

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:23.148
With AT&amp;T Mobile Transfer you can connect your new phone with your

00:00:23.148 --> 00:00:26.568
old phone so you can easily transfer your information from one phone

00:00:26.568 --> 00:00:29.863
to another without deleting your content from your old phone.

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:37.454
You can transfer content from your old phone to your new phone in a

00:00:37.454 --> 00:00:38.288
few easy steps.

00:00:38.288 --> 00:00:42.376
Step 1: Prior to removing the SIM from your old phone, you will need

00:00:42.376 --> 00:00:45.754
to download the Mobile Transfer app by texting the word "transfer"

00:00:45.754 --> 00:00:47.256
to 6565.

00:00:47.256 --> 00:00:50.259
You will receive an application link to download and 

00:00:50.259 --> 00:00:52.010
install the app.

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:57.724
Step 2: Place the SIM in your new phone and text 'transfer' to 6565.

00:00:57.724 --> 00:01:00.894
Again, you will receive an application link to download and 

00:01:00.894 --> 00:01:02.521
install the app.

00:01:02.521 --> 00:01:05.899
Step 3: On your new phone, open the Mobile Transfer app and 

00:01:05.899 --> 00:01:06.984
tap "TO this phone".

00:01:06.984 --> 00:01:10.153
And, on your old phone open the Mobile Transfer app and 

00:01:10.153 --> 00:01:12.531
tap "FROM this phone".

00:01:12.531 --> 00:01:14.700
Now you are ready to begin the next step of

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.618
transferring your data.

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:25.502
With AT&amp;T's new and improved Mobile Transfer application, content is

00:01:25.502 --> 00:01:28.880
shared between phones through Wi-Fi communications.

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.967
Remember some commercial Wi-Fi networks don't allow peer-to-peer

00:01:31.967 --> 00:01:32.968
connectivity.

00:01:32.968 --> 00:01:36.555
So make sure you're on one that does.

00:01:36.555 --> 00:01:39.558
Using your new phone, scan the QR code that appears within the

00:01:39.558 --> 00:01:41.685
app on your old phone with your new phone.

00:01:41.685 --> 00:01:44.146
Once you scan the code your phones will connect and 

00:01:44.146 --> 00:01:46.148
be ready to transfer.

00:01:52.863 --> 00:01:56.074
With AT&amp;T Mobile Transfer, you can seamlessly move from your old

00:01:56.074 --> 00:01:59.244
phone to your new phone without leaving your friends, media,

00:01:59.244 --> 00:02:02.372
messages or important documents behind.

00:02:02.372 --> 00:02:05.542
To begin the transfer, on your new phone select the content you'd

00:02:05.542 --> 00:02:07.377
like from your old phone.

00:02:07.377 --> 00:02:11.256
You have the option to sort by the last three months, six months or

00:02:11.256 --> 00:02:12.257
one year.

00:02:12.257 --> 00:02:15.260
Once you have chosen the content you would like to transfer, 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.095
tap "Transfer".

00:02:17.095 --> 00:02:20.057
The app shows a progress bar and estimates how long the transfer

00:02:20.057 --> 00:02:21.725
will take to complete.

00:02:21.725 --> 00:02:24.269
You'll see how much space is remaining on your new phone, in case

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:27.272
there are things you want to transfer later.

00:02:27.272 --> 00:02:30.150
Once the content is transferred, a transfer summary appears on 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:31.401
your new phone.

00:02:31.401 --> 00:02:33.403
Tap "Next".

00:02:33.403 --> 00:02:36.406
Now your phone is ready for use.

00:02:36.406 --> 00:02:39.534
The AT&amp;T Mobile Transfer app is improved for faster and

00:02:39.534 --> 00:02:40.911
more convenient transfers.

00:02:40.911 --> 00:02:44.539
So, you can enjoy all of the bells and whistles of your new phone,

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:47.376
without leaving the things that matter most behind!
