Hi welcome back to expertvillage.com and since
we are already done cleaning the PC next the

00:00:09.211 --> 00:00:12.710
last thing that you want to do now is put
back all the stuff that we just took out.

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:19.160
So over here I just put back the fan of the
CPU over here so I'm just going to tighten

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:26.160
up some screws right here and make sure that
what ever stuff that you take out or whatever

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:37.860
plug that you take out always remember or
at lease mark it so you could put it back.

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:46.140
Okay right here I'm putting back the cage
for the hard drive. Just tighten the screws

00:00:46.140 --> 00:01:04.170
a little bit. Another screw goes underneath.
Okay make sure that you remember the plugs.

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:14.710
This is the plug for the fan of the hard drive
which I'm going to plug it in back in.

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:27.020
right over here we got the plug for the hard
drive. Back here the power plug and this wire

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:38.210
over here. Here we go. Okay and then last
but not least the video card that we took

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:46.880
out earlier. Make sure when you install the
video card back make sure that it sits properly

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:53.390
on the slot otherwise if it is loose you are
not going to have any picture when you start

00:01:53.390 --> 00:02:07.760
up the PC. Then here is the power plug which
I took out earlier. Plug it right back in

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:19.049
and then you are done. All you got to do is
slide this panel back in. like that make sure

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:27.769
that it locks. Oh one more thing make sure
that slots here goes in the slots over here

00:02:27.769 --> 00:02:41.609
but, it all depends on the case that you have
on the PC. Slide it back in. screw the case.

00:02:41.609 --> 00:03:01.230
Screw the panel on here on the back side.
Here we go and that is it there you have it.
