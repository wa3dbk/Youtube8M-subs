00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:11.920
This is Salah G. Hamed

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:16.680
And today I’m standing between 2,260 PS3 counsels!

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:19.680
These are all connected together to form a single computer

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.555
which is the most powerful supercomputer in Jordan

00:00:21.555 --> 00:00:23.305
Let's introduce you to it in this video

00:00:23.305 --> 00:00:24.815
But before we get into it 

00:00:24.815 --> 00:00:26.635
I'll leave you with the Project manager

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.155
to tell you more details about IMAN1

00:00:29.155 --> 00:00:30.235
and I'll be right back after

00:00:30.235 --> 00:00:31.550
My name is Zaid Abodyeh

00:00:31.714 --> 00:00:33.874
the project manager of IMAN1 supercomputer 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:36.280
It's the first and fastest supercomputer in Jordan

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:39.320
the idea of this project came from his majesty King Abdullah II 

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:42.480
The project was founded to fulfil his majesty’s vision

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.460
in the field of supercomputing to strengthen and ensure Jordan's place

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:49.340
 as a pioneer in the field of ICT in the middle east

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.980
IMAN1 is gigantic supercomputer

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:56.240
Created from combining thousands of computer

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:58.079
mainly PS3 devices 

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.560
all connected though a high speed fiber optic network

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:03.400
and they all work together as one unit 

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:07.380
It's capable of processing 25 trillion calculations per second 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:14.440
IMAN1 has over 18,000 cores, from 2,260 PS3 counsels 

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:20.540
the project is under the umbrella of the Jordanian Atomic Energy Commission

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:26.180
and the center of Synchrotron-light for Experimental Science and Applications in the Middle East

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:29.700
to address their needs of high speed super computing 

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:34.700
and it's also available as an R&amp;D tool to all Jordanian universities and institutions

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:38.960
to support and help scientific, medical and engineering research 

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:42.100
to put the processing power of IMAN1 into prospective 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:44.660
let’s translate the power it has to something we all are familiar with,

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:45.591
smartphones! 

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:51.200
if we were to compare the amount of data IMAN1 can process in 1 second 

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:54.020
it would take about 120,000 iPhone 6

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:55.815
or 90,000 Nexus 5

00:01:55.815 --> 00:01:57.675
or 50,000 Galaxy Note 4

00:01:57.880 --> 00:02:00.480
IMAN1 is used mainly for scientific purposes 

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:03.100
but let's say for a minute that we want to use it for gaming 

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:06.920
the supercomputer will run any game you can think of buttery smooth  at it's highest configurations

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.780
whether it came out today or 10 years from now

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.880
It won't matter if it was “Call of Duty War Fare” or “Call of Duty 77” !

00:02:13.415 --> 00:02:15.415
This was a quick look at IMAN1

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:20.960
