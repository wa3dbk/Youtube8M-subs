00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:09.110
Ello summoners, Ashley and TJ here, and Welcome
to League of Legends Bot Lane Synergies.

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:12.549
Ashley, why don't you tell them what Bot Lane
Synergies is all about.

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:17.720
In this show we take two champions who we
think go extremely well together and break

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:20.050
down exactly why that is.

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:23.390
This week we have some footage we captured
of karma and Lucian.

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:24.470
BARLEY!

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:27.880
What did you guys think of all the server
problems this past week?

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:31.630
It definitely made our life harder, trying
to collect footage for this week.

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:33.100
RIOT PLS!

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:34.100
Anyways.

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:38.030
Lucian the purifier, is a poke heavy ADC who
can remove slows with is dash and gain bonus

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:39.450
movement speed from his W procs.

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.980
Karma, the enlightened one, is equipped with
a high damage poke, and tons of utility for

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:44.980
her team.

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:46.370
But .. you already knew that!

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.370
Lucian and Karma are able to poke down targets
with their Q's giving them very strong early

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.350
game control and zone potential.

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:53.730
Yeah talk about scary!

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.220
What's even better is that Karma has the ability
to disengage herself and Lucian AFTER unleashing

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:59.510
their full combo.

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:03.460
I definitely can recall a bunch of times you
saved me with that amazing shield.

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:06.190
Bonus movement speed on an already fast ADC?

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:08.870
That will make him run faster than Usain bolt!

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:14.180
Woah there lets slow down a bit and take a
look at a few of these plays or runs!

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:15.900
In action.

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.940
here we have Karma and Lucian engaging onto
fiddle sticks as Gragas arrives.

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:25.471
Fiddle flashes to dodge gragy boys body slam,
but Lucian flashes to secure the kill.

00:01:25.471 --> 00:01:30.700
They switch onto jinx but she flashes, We
didn't want to mess with crazy lady anyway.

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:34.250
Lucian and karma are fleeing away to their
tower as they see Xin Zhao arrive to gank.

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:36.781
Lucian times a dash to bring Xin to his tower
bringing him to low HP.

00:01:36.781 --> 00:01:40.690
Lux lands a double bind ult combo As Lucian
and karma switch focus to twitch.

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:46.750
Lucian uses the culling to bring them low
and get the kill on xin.

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:51.530
here they see the trickster Leblanc coming
for a gank. karma Q Tethers Leblanc forcing

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:53.640
her to flee as Farvan arrives.

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.130
as karma gets chained Lucian casts the culling
while karma uses a mantra Q on their whole

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:00.409
team devastating their LIVES.

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:04.700
They switch onto thresh and get him to flash
but as the chase continues thresh hooks onto

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.910
the wight camp and escapes.

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:10.670
NOT!

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:14.129
karma and Lucian begin to head back to lane,
while karma decides to fight as soon as the

00:02:14.129 --> 00:02:15.129
enemy arrives.

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:18.349
Lucian sits back waiting for the right moment
to enter While his friend soaks up most of

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:19.930
the enemies spells.

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:23.659
As Lucian fully engages he pokes down the
enemy team while karma sits in the back speeding

00:02:23.659 --> 00:02:26.280
him up allowing him to stick to his targets.

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:31.980
Lucian gets feared as karma goes in for the
kill on jinx, but a crow and tower hit sends

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:32.980
her back.

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:40.599
She then casts a mantra q killing fiddle while
Lucian sacrifices himself for jinx.

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:45.129
Here we see Lucian and Karma attempting to
engage on the enemy jinx, Lee sin shows up

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:47.629
for a surprise gank causing them to flee.

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:52.739
As lee sin dashes in, karma and Lucian kite
and poke them down turning the tide of the

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:53.739
gank.

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:57.480
Lee Sin Q's into karma but is hit face first
with a ton of damage brining him down.

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:02.409
Nidalee arrives to aid her team chasing them
back to tower with a spear onto fiddle they

00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:05.239
able to focus down jinx and switch to the
scarecrow.

00:03:05.239 --> 00:03:08.909
Lucian culls fiddles sticks on tower but the
fight isn't over yet.

00:03:08.909 --> 00:03:15.790
A NEW CHALLENGER APPROACHES, Syndra makes
her way down botlane as karma and Lucian push

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:16.790
to tower.

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:20.639
When Syndra arrives she attempts to burst
down Lucian but a quick barrier and karma

00:03:20.639 --> 00:03:22.569
shield will keep him alive.

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:27.290
Nidalee comes back into the fight and DEAD.

00:03:27.290 --> 00:03:29.730
karma and Lucian push their way to mid tower
poking vi down.

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:31.739
They then turn onto the tower bringing it
down.

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:35.280
Vi begins to charge up vault breaker to what
looks like an attempt to flee but she quickly

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.159
turns around as her team arrives.

00:03:37.159 --> 00:03:40.359
They are able to bring vi down before they
rest of her team comes but they are now surrounded

00:03:40.359 --> 00:03:43.849
karma runs off to the side poking him down
while Lucian kites.

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:47.150
They bring down kenen and Lucian pops barrier
to continue fighting.

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:51.739
Leblanc soon arrives bringing Lucian down
to EXTREMLY LOW HP, shields speed ups and

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:53.159
dashes are able to keep him alive

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:54.159
just barely to take out Ezreal and Leblanc.

00:03:54.159 --> 00:03:55.470
unfortunately thresh arrives killing Lucian
reuniting him with his wife.

00:03:55.470 --> 00:03:59.409
Jarvan then avenges his fallen ally ulting
onto of thresh for Demacia ending in a 4 for

00:03:59.409 --> 00:04:06.349
