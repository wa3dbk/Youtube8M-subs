00:00:09.849 --> 00:00:15.528
The Employability and Careers Service offers a range 
of services to students and those include

00:00:15.528 --> 00:00:18.082
helping you to construct a professional CV 

00:00:18.082 --> 00:00:24.073
and cover letters as well. Also mock interviews, 
because practice makes perfect

00:00:24.073 --> 00:00:27.277
and you need to learn the tricks of the 
 trade, and there's a wealth of knowledge

00:00:27.277 --> 00:00:29.808
in the Employability and Careers 
Service to help you do that.

00:00:29.808 --> 00:00:33.849
Personal statements and application 
forms for graduate firms as well

00:00:33.849 --> 00:00:38.609
because there are techniques in which to 
tackle it and the Employability and Careers 
Service can help you there.

00:00:38.609 --> 00:00:42.788
And last but not least, helping to 
tackle assessment centres.

00:00:42.788 --> 00:00:47.246
A lot of graduate firms have assessment 
days where they put you through a lot of tests

00:00:47.246 --> 00:00:51.263
and ask you to do a lot of tasks which 
they then assess you on at the end.

00:00:51.263 --> 00:00:56.488
I think it's very, very essential to 
tap into the resources and also

00:00:56.488 --> 00:00:57.599
the knowledge and the help at 
the Employability and Careers Service

00:00:57.599 --> 00:01:03.942
whilst you're studying because you get 
advice there that is completely free that will

00:01:03.942 --> 00:01:05.544
not be free when you graduate.

00:01:05.544 --> 00:01:09.073
I believe that all students must go 
through that process where they do

00:01:09.073 --> 00:01:10.582
test the waters and try it

00:01:10.582 --> 00:01:15.180
and the Employability and Careers 
Service is the perfect place to do that.

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:17.711
I'd recommend using the 
Careers Service to anyone.

00:01:17.711 --> 00:01:21.751
It gives you a really good insight 
as to what's expected from

00:01:21.751 --> 00:01:26.302
the actual interview and application
process. Now I'm at the stage of applying

00:01:26.302 --> 00:01:27.928
for a graduate position

00:01:27.928 --> 00:01:33.315
and part of the application 
process, certainly for some of the bigger

00:01:33.315 --> 00:01:41.160
organisations, is to make you sit online 
aptitude tests. What the Careers 
centre deal with is they run 

00:01:41.163 --> 00:01:44.020
mock psychometric testing.

00:01:44.019 --> 00:01:47.620
It gives you an excellent idea 
of what's actually involved 

00:01:47.618 --> 00:01:51.150
in the application process.

00:01:51.148 --> 00:01:55.390
The role of a Placement Officer is to 
support you in finding your placement

00:01:55.386 --> 00:01:58.930
to give you the skills you need in 
terms of helping you develop your CV,

00:01:58.926 --> 00:02:02.800
preparing you for interviews, helping 
you with the application process.

00:02:02.804 --> 00:02:06.430
There's lots of different placements 
that students get involved in,

00:02:06.426 --> 00:02:09.930
so there is the year out placements that a 
lot of people know about, but there's also

00:02:09.933 --> 00:02:12.950
an increasing amount of opportunities for students

00:02:12.951 --> 00:02:20.310
to do part-time placements, placements over the 
summer, and to do placements as part of their 
course during their semesters.

00:02:20.312 --> 00:02:25.120
We have a lot of resources and we've got 
a lot of skills and experience, and 
we want to help you find a placement.

00:02:25.119 --> 00:02:29.250
We genuinely believe if you want to 
find a work placement, you'll get one.

00:02:29.252 --> 00:02:32.390
Please come and use our service 
because we're here to help you.

00:02:32.386 --> 00:02:34.060
They gave me advice

00:02:34.058 --> 00:02:38.500
encouraged me, and even

00:02:38.496 --> 00:02:39.790
to the point that I'd thought 
about giving up personally

00:02:39.794 --> 00:02:44.480
they were there to support me. 
They assisted me in 

00:02:44.484 --> 00:02:49.380
how to approach a prospective employer,

00:02:49.383 --> 00:02:55.070
how to answer most challenging application questions,

00:02:55.072 --> 00:02:59.460
how to stand out from the crowd, and 
it's been really, really good.

00:02:59.461 --> 00:03:03.590
I would recommend all students use the service.

00:03:03.594 --> 00:03:07.330
They are friendly, they are there to help, 
they are there to encourage

00:03:07.332 --> 00:03:11.910
and they're there to assist you with 
whatever thing you need.

00:03:11.907 --> 00:03:15.180
Today's employers are looking for 
graduates with self confidence, 

00:03:15.181 --> 00:03:21.080
and self-awareness. You've got to be able to 
describe your strengths and skills fluently, 

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:28.650
using relevant examples from your own experience, in 
writing, during interviews and at assessment centres.

00:03:28.648 --> 00:03:32.850
As well as this employers are looking 
for strong, well-structured CVs

00:03:32.851 --> 00:03:38.120
thorough personal statements and 
a good polished performance at interview.

00:03:38.122 --> 00:03:43.930
So, if you would like support in the career 
planning process, don't hesitate to come in

00:03:43.927 --> 00:03:49.480
and see us at the Employability and Careers Service. 
We're a friendly team and happy to help.
