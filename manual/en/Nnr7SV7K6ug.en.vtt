Hi my name is Madeline Franco and I'm here
to talk about birds, specifically in this

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:08.710
segment we are going to talk about how to
take care of your birds. You see here several

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:14.640
birds. This one is Kiki. She is a kiek. She
is a parrot. She is one of the smaller parrots.

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:21.039
I have other larger parrots. At 140 grams
she is certainly one of the more diminutive

00:00:21.039 --> 00:00:26.390
of them but even with her small weight it
is said that nothing will change your life

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:31.380
more than a parrot. I have a number of friends
who don't really cook for themselves but they

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:35.829
cook for their birds so that is one of the
changes that may take place. The basics of

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:48.039
parrot care are food, shelter, housing, and
proper medical care. Food very many of them

00:00:48.039 --> 00:00:56.190
eat pelleted diets. They also can become seed
junkies so if you get a new bird you want

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:02.940
to vary their diet as much as possible. Get
them a good pellet type food and get them

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:09.460
a good seed mixture if you are going to feed
seed. Also you may want to keep in mind that

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:14.640
they love fruits and vegetables. They love
to eat what you eat. They'll even eat pizza.

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.810
There are some things to avoid however. You
don't want to give them any chocolate, caffeine,

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:27.090
avocado and a couple of other things that
are not good for them. Many of your bird clubs

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:33.229
will publish lists, I know ours does about
the things of things that you should avoid

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:37.360
as far as foods. You might want to get yourself
involved in a bird club because they can help

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:43.479
you with some of those issues. As far as housing
your bird should have a cage. You shouldn't

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:48.159
keep your bird in the cage all day but the
cage should be of adequate size. Many people

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:53.390
say get the largest cage you can avoid and
I say get a cage that is the right size for

00:01:53.390 --> 00:02:01.499
your bird. Although an African Gray is larger
than a kiek by about twice and then some with

00:02:01.499 --> 00:02:07.280
size and many times an African Gray will not
want or use or need a cage s big as a kiek

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:15.170
can. Kieks love to play and they live to play
and play to live so they will use more space

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:22.230
within their cage than many other birds. One
of the other vital things for your bird is

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:29.250
fresh water at all times. I like to bottle
train my birds because it creates a supply

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:35.471
o clean water all the time. Birds tend to
like to dunk their food and if they have a

00:02:35.471 --> 00:02:41.640
bowl of water they will get their water pretty
grody looking in no time flat so you want

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.920
to pay strict attention to their water and
they need some play time and some attention

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:51.020
from you. In order to keep them tame you need
to take them out of their cages and make them

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:57.950
a member of your family. If you take care
of your bird and follow some basic tips you

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:02.360
will have a very long and fun relationship
with your bird. Keep in mind that they do

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:06.700
live a long time and after you have bought
your bird and you have bought some good food

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:10.840
and you have bought a cage one of the best
things you can get for your bird or for yourself

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:14.970
is a couple of great books. One of the things
you should also keep in mind about your bird

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:21.500
is that they require and enjoy regular bathing.
Some of them are dunkers, some of them appreciate

00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:27.300
being in the shower with a human and some
of them just appreciate being under a gentle

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:35.240
spray. Among my birds I have all kinds. Some
of them like to dunk in their bowl. This one

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:37.061
really enjoys dunking in a bowl.
