Hey!Hey! How you doing? This is Jonathan Escotto,
also known as B-boy Xcel, on behalf of Expert

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:08.820
Village, and today we're showing breaking
tips. Now we're going to talk a little bit

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.780
about more about footwork. The most basic
footwork step out there is what we call the

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:18.500
6 step. Now, obviously, it's called a 6 step
because there's 6 steps. I'm going to break

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:22.050
down the 6 steps. Now, before we take it to
the ground, I'm actually going to show it

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:28.939
to you standing up so you can get a basic
idea. I prefer to counterclockwise, but in

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:33.440
footwork you should be able to do your basic
steps in both directions, which would be clockwise.

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:38.071
Clockwise I should say and counterclockwise.
It's good to be able to go in both directions

00:00:38.071 --> 00:00:42.490
and kind of be ambidextrous. Here we go, 6
steps. I'm going to break it down. We're going

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:45.520
to start off with left foot, kind of like
we're doing the Indian step at a 90 degree

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:51.211
angle. Step 1, this is step 1. Now we're going
to take our right foot and we're going to

00:00:51.211 --> 00:00:57.470
step back right behind our left foot. Take
a left foot again, step so you're facing forward

00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:02.719
now. You're going to take your right foot,
you're going to step over your left foot here.

00:01:02.719 --> 00:01:08.250
Take your left, it's going to step back here,
and you take your right foot and step forward.

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.040
Step back I should say. Okay, we just did
a 6 step standing up. I'm going to break it

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:18.700
down again so you can see. I'm going to keep
the rotations going. 1, 2 with your right

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:26.520
foot, 3 with your left foot. Now you're back
facing forward. Right foot in front, 4, left

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:31.242
foot back, 5, right foot back, 6, you're back
at the beginning. Now we're going to do 2

00:01:31.242 --> 00:01:38.550
rotations so you can see the transition. It's
going to look something like this. 1, 2, 3,

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:51.910
4, 5, 6, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. The more you do
it, the easier it's going to become. You want

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:55.430
to stay light on your feet and you want to
actually try that in both directions. The

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:59.969
opposite direction, basically, reverse the
motions. So instead of starting with your

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:02.320
left foot, you want to start with your right
foot. It's going to look something like this.

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:11.280
Right foot first. Indian step; 1, 2 is the
left foot behind, 3 is forward, 4 is in front,

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:19.650
5 is back, 6 is back to the beginning position.
Now, that was basically your warm up. Before

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.190
you learn the 6 step on the floor, that's
your warm up standing up so that you can get

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.750
the motions and you get the step in your head.
Now, it's very important that you actually

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:31.720
count these steps out in your head or out
loud. It's okay to count. Trust me, counting

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:36.391
helps. You want to get this in the beginning
both ways. Practice it in both directions.

00:02:36.391 --> 00:02:42.319
I would recommend doing reps of 5 or 10 in
each direction so that you get it down packed.

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:46.190
Again, 6 steps standing up. Next that follow,
6 steps on the floor.
