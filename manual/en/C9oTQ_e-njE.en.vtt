00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:11.160
Sometimes it's easy to forget that Firemint,
the developers of the Real Racing series for

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:15.920
iOS have another game they're rather famous
for - a little line-drawing App called Flight

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:20.430
Control. While racing has its fans, Flight
Control made perfect use of the touch-screen

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.200
interface to create a fun game based around
the pressures of multitasking.

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:29.369
So what if Firemint decided to boil the concept
down in to something a bit more bite-sized?

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:33.230
What if you were rewarded for your puzzle
solving skills along with your perfect timing?

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:37.300
Wonder no more because SPY mouse has landed,
giving you the opportunity to scamper around,

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:41.590
avoiding (or in some cases, confronting) cats
while ducking in and out of nooks and crannies

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:43.280
while stealing cheese.

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.300
You only get to control Agent Squeak by drawing
a path for him to follow, directing him towards

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:51.030
various objectives along the way. He's no
slouch either and you'll have to take in to

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.120
account his speed to avoid being spotted,
though carrying cheese will slow him down

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:59.220
(with higher scoring pieces weighing him down
further). This turns the game in to one of

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:03.270
careful planning, with multiple attempts being
required to tweak things 'just right' to gain

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:05.250
all the available medals for a level.

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:09.430
Instead of a traditional and banal three-star
system, additional side-objectives are given,

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:13.580
rewarding medals for completing three varied
tasks ranging from not being spotted; using

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:17.060
only one line; not using certain items; and
so on.

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:21.430
If there's one weakness it's in the controls
and this can be a large sticking point considering

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:25.210
there's only one way of interacting with the
game. Drawing lines isn't a simple matter

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:28.680
of following the finger directly as the line
attempts to make it easier for you to see

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:33.020
what's happening when drawing extended paths
by moving away from the contact point. You

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:37.170
can get used to it, but when some levels require
precise timing it can be frustrating to lose

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.119
your progress thanks to an unwanted change
in direction. Checkpoints in later levels

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:43.510
help to alleviate the issue, but it's there
none-the-less.

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:48.020
All of this excitement takes place in a wonderfully
vibrant world that packs a lot more variety

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.310
than you'd realize amongst its six worlds.
Each introduces new concepts that make life

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:56.040
easier (or harder depending on what you're
trying to achieve), but they're also capped

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.670
off by fun 'Boss' stages that mix up the gameplay
with speedy stealth sequences followed by

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:02.670
action-packed 'boss fights'.

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.979
From its charming designs to its elegant and
complex challenges, SPY mouse is yet another

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:10.869
great release from Firemint that feels at
home on a touch-based device no matter where

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:11.510
you are.
