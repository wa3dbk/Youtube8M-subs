00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:10.170
Jamie Reyes deals with a lot of drama: High
School, family, and a murderous blue scarab

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.139
embedded into his back.

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:17.380
Khaji-da, the scarab, was built by the Reach,
an interstellar race infamous for subjugating

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:20.519
whole planets… when not destroying them.

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:27.599
Now, as Blue Beetle, Jamie struggles to wield
a weapon of destruction as a tool for good.

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.800
The Reach Infiltrator is a Marksman-Assassin
who injures from afar and then sprints for

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.739
the kill.

00:00:33.739 --> 00:00:37.230
His Marksman passive is Reach Directive: Disrupt.

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.559
Using a skill empowers his next basic attack
with additional true damage.

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:45.760
The amount of additional damage is determined
by the target’s current health.

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:50.219
Afterwards, Disrupt goes on cooldown for several
seconds.

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.640
Energy Canon charges and fires a shot that
deals Attack Damage to the first enemy hit.

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:59.350
The shot will then explode, dealing lesser
Attack Damage to nearby enemies.

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:04.570
Blue Beetle can launch his Scarab Scanner
at a target location, granting vision.

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:09.620
The scarab explodes after a long duration
and marks nearby enemies for a short time.

00:01:09.620 --> 00:01:14.320
Alternatively, Blue Beetle can activate the
skill a second time, or use his ultimate,

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.790
causing the scarab to detonate early.

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:20.520
Damaging enemies marked by the explosion will
consume the mark and deal additional true

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:23.370
damage as if hit by Reach Directive.

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:27.659
Use Stick and Move to dash a fixed distance
while firing four shots at enemies behind

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:28.659
him.

00:01:28.659 --> 00:01:32.659
The shots auto-target enemies, and consecutive
shots against the same target deal reduced

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:33.659
Attack Damage.

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:38.219
Blue Beetle’s ultimate is Infiltrator Mode,
which allows him to toggle between Marksman

00:01:38.219 --> 00:01:39.649
and Assassin form.

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:43.310
His Assassin form has different skills and
a higher Move Speed.

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.470
Additional ranks of Infiltrator Mode increase
the potency of all skills in that form, except

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:48.890
for Reach Directive.

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:53.110
In Assassin form, his passive becomes Reach
Directive: Execute.

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:57.310
Execute functions like Disrupt, but its true
damage will increase based on the target’s

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:58.390
missing health.

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:01.579
Reach Directive uses the same cooldown in
either forms.

00:02:01.579 --> 00:02:06.450
Use Lethal Measures to dash to an enemy and
deal Attack Damage while applying on-hit effects,

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.180
including Execute.

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:13.230
Use Hypersonics to emit a loud blast that
fears drones and creatures for a short time.

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:18.510
If Hypersonics hits enemy champions it reduces
their damage and marks them for several seconds.

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.480
Damage a marked champion to consume the mark
and deal True Damage as if effected by Reach

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:23.870
Directive.

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:27.780
Attack with Mandible Taser to deal Attack
Damage and severely reduce the target’s

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:29.980
Move Speed for a few seconds.

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:34.319
Because Scarab Scanner and Hypersonics apply
true damage like Reach Directive, level the

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:37.480
passive early for more frequent true damage.

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:42.430
Energy Cannon is great for poking at enemy
champions and can be used to last hit drones.

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:47.040
While its secondary area damage can be useful
to harass enemies behind drones, try landing

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.260
direct hits for max damage.

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.910
You can setup vision with Scarab Scanner,
placing it in stealth pads while you fight

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:54.090
drone waves.

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:58.870
To use it offensively, mark all targets with
Scarab Scanner and follow-up with Energy Cannon

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:01.739
to damage your targets and activate Reach
Directive.

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:06.150
Try to save Stick and Move for moments when
you need to escape, as it’s a strong deterrent

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.269
against chasing enemies.

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:12.480
Use Infiltrator Mode when one or more enemy
champions are low on health.

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:17.040
Lethal Measures has a low cooldown so it can
be used frequently to gap-close, especially

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.120
against low-health targets.

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:23.520
Mandible Taser’s high slow can help chase
a fleeing enemy, but can also be used as an

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:25.690
emergency escape.

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:29.910
If an enemy champion uses an escape skill
when hit with Mandible Taser, you can follow-up

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:31.780
with Lethal Measures.

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:35.810
If enemy drones stand between you and the
fleeing champion, use Hypersonics to clear

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:38.870
out nearby enemy drones and follow-up with
Lethal Measures.

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:43.330
Blue Beetle scales at a moderate pace, so
strong early credit gain is vital.

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:48.650
Essential artifacts include Joe Chill’s
Revolver, Soultaker Katana, and Deathstroke’s

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:49.739
Claymore.

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:54.090
Huntress Crossbow’s cooldown reduction helps
activate Reach Directive more often.

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:58.790
Batman’s Utility Belt provides a nice boost
to health and further cooldown reduction.

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:03.590
Moreover, its active skill, Purge, is useful
when slowed by enemy champions.

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:07.739
Blue Beetle's X-Ray vision grants 30 credits
for each Surveillance Camera destroyed while

00:04:07.739 --> 00:04:08.879
the skill is active.

00:04:08.879 --> 00:04:13.620
This can be used for efficient camera clearing
that reduces the enemy’s vision while accruing

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:14.620
credits.

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:19.470
Kick some butt and MURDER INDISCRIMINATELY
as the Reach Infiltrator, Blue Beetle.
