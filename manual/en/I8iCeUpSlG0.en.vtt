00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:01.560
Hi, everyone.

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:04.670
This is Ann Clemmer and Stamper from stamperdog.com.

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:07.759
And I'm in my stamp room - oh, yes!

00:00:07.759 --> 00:00:13.010
And spring is almost over and it's time to
really hunker down

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:15.460
and get some control on that card stock.

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:19.620
We're having a private discussion on our private
Facebook page

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:23.590
for the 24/7 Stampers about this one subject.

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:26.099
Here is my answer to Bobby's question.

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:30.760
But first, I think Stamper's not in the mood
to work (laughter).

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:34.630
Okay, now that I got all the dog hair off
me -

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:39.801
Anyway, we are having a discussion on our
24/7 Stampers

00:00:39.801 --> 00:00:47.100
private Facebook group and it's all about
what to do with all those little pieces of

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:48.330
card stock.

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:52.440
You know, I'm an avid stamper and over just
maybe three days

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.240
I can have at least this much scrap paper.

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:57.550
And what to do with it?

00:00:57.550 --> 00:01:01.140
As you can see right over my shoulder here,
I've got a couple

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.350
of paper towers and that's what I use for
my full size paper.

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:07.530
And some people use other things.

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.469
They have some really good ideas, too,
because it all depends on what your workspace

00:01:11.469 --> 00:01:12.469
is.

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:16.109
Let me show you what I do with my scraps.

00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:19.659
First of all, I have a cutting station and
it's right here.

00:01:19.659 --> 00:01:23.060
And just to the right of it I have a scrap
basket.

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:27.689
And it's just about ready to be redone for
one reason or another.

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:34.060
In each of these folders - like here it's
a two-sided folder,

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.210
it's sealed on this side, sealed on this side
and it's open here

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:40.090
and I've got all my neutrals.

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:43.679
So those I probably keep down to smaller sizes.

00:01:43.679 --> 00:01:48.369
Some of you keep every little bit because,
to quote one of my 24/7 stampers,

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:53.950
Well, actually a couple of them -
even a little piece of scrap can make a flower.

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:58.509
However, when you stamp a lot, why, I have
to have room for my bed

00:01:58.509 --> 00:02:01.740
and to sleep, so you know, I can't keep everything!

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.279
What I like to do is here I've got one of
these

00:02:04.279 --> 00:02:06.719
and here's all the blues together.

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:09.000
Now you notice that's not how I keep my regular
paper.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.480
My regular paper is alphabetized because that
makes sense to me

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:15.730
and maybe that makes sense to you or maybe
you have a different plan.

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:19.260
But when it comes to scraps, I just put all
the blues together.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.239
Now usually I only keep down to maybe a half
page size

00:02:23.239 --> 00:02:27.849
and smaller than that I'm donating to the
church Sunday school

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:32.099
or the battered women's shelter that we have
locally

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:35.209
or someone who can use it more than me.

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:36.819
Don't hold on to every little scrap.

00:02:36.819 --> 00:02:38.799
Give it to someone who can use it.

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:41.379
It could be a little daycare center by your
home.

00:02:41.379 --> 00:02:42.790
It could be anything.

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:47.400
But until you do, you can put them in something
like this

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.579
and just get a basket . . . this was just
a basket that I got

00:02:51.579 --> 00:02:55.000
at some discount place.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:58.540
You want to make sure - see, here's all my
pinks together, right?

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:02.390
And it's usually just the larger stuff because
I could just get

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:04.430
inundated with the little ones.

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:09.110
So there's the big towers, here's where I
cut, and then

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:10.610
this is where the scraps go.

00:03:10.610 --> 00:03:14.180
The garbage is right behind me and then just
the other side

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:17.940
of this one is where I put the ones I'm going
to give away.

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:21.800
And it's a great big box and when I get it
big enough, I donate it.

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:24.280
Be open to sharing the love of stamping with
your friends.

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:28.280
And drop by stamperdog.com some time and share
with us.

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:31.629
Think about becoming a part of our 24/7 Stampers.

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:32.629
We have a riot.

00:03:32.629 --> 00:03:34.510
We have our own personal blog.

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:38.790
We have our Facebook group where everybody
chats and shares.

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:40.459
We have webinars once a month.

00:03:40.459 --> 00:03:41.459
And hey!

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:45.079
A bunch of us are going to convention -
we are going to stamp our hearts out!

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:49.540
So come with us some time and see what it's
like on the other side.

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:54.290
This is Ann Clemmer and - well, wherever Stamper
is - from stamperdog.com, trying to put a

00:03:54.290 --> 00:03:57.219
little ink, paper, and fun into your day.

00:03:57.219 --> 00:03:58.999
Oh, Romeo, Romeo.

00:03:58.999 --> 00:04:01.370
Wherefore art thou, Romeo?

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:03.750
Time for a bath!
