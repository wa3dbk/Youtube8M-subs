&gt;&gt; DREW: Now we go on to a game called Song
Styles. This is for Brad with Laura Hall on

00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:10.240
the piano. Laura Hall, how 'bout her?
[applause]

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:13.429
&gt;&gt; DREW: Brad is going to make up a song about
someone in the audience. Let's turn right

00:00:13.429 --> 00:00:17.489
behind me. And is there anyone here in the
audience who would like a song made up about

00:00:17.489 --> 00:00:18.539
them? You mam, with your hand raised. What's
your name?

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:20.720
&gt;&gt; NEROSHI: Neroshi.
&gt;&gt; DREW: Neroshi? 

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:25.490
Ha ha.
[laughter and applause]
 &gt;&gt; DREW: What do you do Neroshi?

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:30.749
What do you do? 
&gt;&gt; NEROSHI: Uh, I go to UC San Diego. 
&gt;&gt; DREW: You go to UC San Diego? And what's your major?

00:00:30.749 --> 00:00:35.120
&gt;&gt; NEROSHI: Political science and economics. 
&gt;&gt; DREW: So Neroshi, who majors in political science

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.210
and economics 
[laughter]

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.370
&gt;&gt; BRAD: Neroshi?
&gt;&gt; NEROSHI: Yeah.
&gt;&gt; BRAD: Neroshi.
&gt;&gt; DREW: Try rhyming that.

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:48.039
[laughter]
&gt;&gt; DREW: And, uh, you'll be singing in the

00:00:48.039 --> 00:00:55.039
style of a rock love ballad.
[music starts playing, piano and stuff]

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:01.929
[Brad starts singing]
&gt;&gt; BRAD: I don't know 

00:01:01.929 --> 00:01:08.929
what to do; I'm failing out of political science, 

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:16.850
Neroshi.
I don't know what to say, 

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:24.659
but let us to go away to France and sail on the Rive Gauche(-y).

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:35.040
Neroshi, let's cook some brioche(-y). Neroshi, I'll put on some suntan losh-y. Neroshi, I love you. It's true, I really do. I wanna sail across the seven seas, and the Pacific osh-y. Neroshi, oo oo. WHY? Couldn't you 

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:21.330
have an easier rhyming name? Oh, why? I'd
have an easier time in this game. Neroshi, we're so close-y. Neroshi, I love you.

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:54.550
[applause]
&gt;&gt; DREW: Thank you Neroshi, that was great.
[applause continues]

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:57.270
&gt;&gt; DREW: Hundred points for Pacific osh-y.
[laughter]
