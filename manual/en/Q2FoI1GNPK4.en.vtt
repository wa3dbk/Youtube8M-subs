00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:14.600
another my son played before

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:19.610
uh... you know steve had just asked me
about this may be a week ago

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:22.730
and i've been battling with a
back-and-forth i'll i'll football i've

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:24.440
played football in high school

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:25.279
and so

00:01:25.279 --> 00:01:28.390
i was leaning towards let him play
football ways younger

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:29.740
cut-off in college

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:33.660

t plane

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.560
uh... but now i'm done with it

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.979
and so many times the carolinas

00:01:39.979 --> 00:01:42.210
it's a concussion issue

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.720
you might look into this and maybe maybe
find out that it doesn't have to do with

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:47.380
that

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:50.760
but may it is at this point but question
please

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:55.580
statistically significant the number of
suicides you have among of football

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:56.390
players

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:58.910
their and rigid in an appropriate

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:02.240
how long the liver is somewhere near
