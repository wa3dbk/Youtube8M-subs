Hi, I'm Terri Lynne and this is David O'Donnell,
and we're here on behalf of Expert Village.

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:11.769
In this segment we're going to be doing a
game called "The Chair Game." And with the

00:00:11.769 --> 00:00:17.740
chair game the object is you want to be sitting
on the chair; and there's only one chair and

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:25.460
two people. The thing is the other person
has to always take your suggestion or your

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:30.610
offer; which is what improvisation is all
about. So if David's on the chair I have to

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:35.550
come up a creative way to get him to get off
the chair; by either creating a situation

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:42.720
or a circumstance or asking him a question
that might have him get up or asking him to

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:46.250
do something, and then I'm going to take the
chair and then he has to come up with a new

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:50.190
creative way to get me out of it and then
we just keep doing that until we run out of

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:59.450
ideas to get ourselves in or out of the chair.
Are you ready? David: Yes Terri: I think your

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:06.440
shoelace is untied. But you're going to need
to......could you just stand up and I'll get

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:14.670
it for you, yeah, no I'd love to. David: Hey,
you know you're bottoms on fire. Terri: Hey!!

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:24.240
Oh, oww! David: Yeah, take care of that. Terri:
Oh! They called your number, 32? At the bank,

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:34.770
you're next, sir. Go ahead. David: Oh, ok.
Terri: Yeah! David: Ma'am? Do you realize

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:40.360
what you're sitting on? This bench dates back
to the Civil War, you might want to get up

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:42.830
because, seriously, you're not allowed to
be on there and the police are coming. You

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:46.610
could actually get a ticket. Terri: Oh, I
didn't know, I'm sorry! Oh, I feel terrible!

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:54.080
David: Yeah, it's a $50 fine. It's not a big
deal, $50 is $50. Terri: Sir, can't you tell

00:01:54.080 --> 00:02:05.560
I'm eight months pregnant? You took the last
chair on the bus, that's kind of rude. Thank

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:17.010
you! Okay, so as you can see, we were changing
characters and changing environment as well

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:21.760
when we were playing this game. So to get
them off the chair you can change who you

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:26.590
are, or the location or the environment. You
can change what their sitting on, I could

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:30.160
have been sitting on a stick of dynamite or
David could have been sitting on a stick of

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.450
dynamite to get him off. It doesn't matter
what it is as long as you're offering a suggestion

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:39.810
and they have to accept your suggestion EVERY
time. And that is the chair game.
