Colouring-in a flower with colour transitions

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:10.360
This is what we'll be working towards

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:16.200
I'll be using these materials in this video

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:32.740
Step 1: Using the fine-liner, draw a line on the inner side of the leafs.

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:47.220
Colour the outerside of the leafs with pencil. Apply presure the make sure the colour really pops

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:49.440
Repeat te previous step with the yellow pencil, colour the white areas on the inside

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:17.380
Now colour the rest of the flower with less presure 

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:25.160
Colour the heart of the flower with a bright colour

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:32.500
