hello minecraft this is Maxwelljones for
the tutorial

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:09.780
on the Pulverizer. So first you need to

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.650
get a Pulverizer, i'm not gonna show you the recipe. You will need some kind of power to

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:14.360
power it.

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:18.760
Here we use some Redstone energy conducts from our power source here

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:23.000
and we power down our pulverizer. we
see me deity that's the energy

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:26.670
is coming in; it can store 4800

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.420
minecraft Joules. On the right side you
have a configuration panel

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.629
showing you that the maximum power is
four minecraft Joules per tick

00:00:34.629 --> 00:00:39.469
second option the Redstone control
you can control your Pulverizer  with

00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:41.679
redstone so like a lever for example

00:00:41.679 --> 00:00:44.719
and here's the configuration for the
inputs and outputs

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:48.600
first we'll put everything blank.
everything blank means

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.069
you need to put your stuff inside
manually so here we have some

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:55.379
iron ore, we drop it in there and its
pulverizing

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:00.159
and getting in the output sectionpulverized iron on the main outputs and down

00:01:00.159 --> 00:01:01.619
is the secondary output

00:01:01.619 --> 00:01:06.150
you can by pipe it also into pipes like
cobble stone and stone transport pipes

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.110
like so

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.500
and let's say

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.010
the top output will be for the main product
and right output will be for the

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:16.410
secondary products

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:20.130
we can put a lever

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:23.490
in front of it so we can activate or
deactivate it so i'll put

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.890
one iron ore inside then you see it's pulverizing because it's activated at the

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:29.660
moment so lets deactivate it

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:32.820
and see. now it should be off and not

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:39.820
doing its work. there is a couple of ways
to input or materials in the pulveriser

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:46.330
so now we input from the left side

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:49.610
we can see the blue color code, we can use a hopper for example

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:55.200
and turn it with the Crescent hammer we
can

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:59.380
drop our stuff in the hopper if you have
lots of stuff it's kind of useful

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:02.640
here I prepared a chest with

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:08.259
some stuff inside, there's Iron ore, gold ore,
silver, ore copper, certus, blaze rode

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:15.259
bones and so on... you can choose to

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:20.739
pipe it in if you like or you can choose to

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:25.109
add another hopper on the bottom of the
chest and the things are

00:02:25.109 --> 00:02:29.499
going to go directly from the chest to
the hopper and into the second hopper

00:02:29.499 --> 00:02:32.680
and then into our pulveriser

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.750
then

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:36.770
everything

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:40.500
will be processed, but only one at the time

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:40.600
 

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:44.800
after some time waiting we can see that the top chest has all the process materials

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.400
and the bottom chest has all the secondary
process materials

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.870
thank you very much for watching have a
good day and if you'd like to video

00:02:51.870 --> 00:02:52.670
please
