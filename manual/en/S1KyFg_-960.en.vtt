00:00:01.390 --> 00:00:25.499
Listen, there�s nothing I hate more than
people who steal other people�s gimmicks.

00:00:25.499 --> 00:00:31.960
Yeah, I�m talking to you, Shawn White. I�m
calling you out publicly, you coward. You�re

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:36.940
lucky you cut that hair, too. Because as we
all learned in the 1986 classic Highlander,

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:40.210
there can be only one.

00:00:40.210 --> 00:00:45.649
I�m not Shawn White. I don�t take other
people�s stuff. That�s one reason I hate

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:51.620
to do this...to review Zhu Zhu Pets for the
Nintendo DS. These are f*cking hamsters, and

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:57.420
we already have a hamster guy. I hate hamsters
and I hate Thursdays, so this is, like...I�m

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.289
way beyond the outskirts out of my comfort
zone here.

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:03.230
Plus it�s...this is for little girls.

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:10.450
So this game was sent to us by Felicity in
the UK. This girl...I�m telling you, guys.

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:16.510
She sends us boxes upon boxes of the weirdest
crap...I mean, Hamster Thursday is only a

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:21.759
weekly thing because she sent us so many hamster
games, it became a weekly thing. Nonetheless,

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:26.490
even TJ was like, �Nah, man. I�ll pass
on the Zhu Zhu.�

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:29.799
�You can do the Zhu, Derek.�

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:33.020
He�s...TJ�s like a nerdy Dale Junior.

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:37.300
So I got news for you, guys. I have a whole
freaking stack of Zhu Zhu games. And I�m

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:42.340
going to review them. Because no one else
on the freaking Internet has. I might not

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:48.640
be the hero you need right now, Zhu Zhu fans,
but...I�m the hero you deserve. Lieutenant

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.660
Gordon. And obviously, I have no freaking
idea what to say about this game.

00:01:52.660 --> 00:02:00.329
I mean, look at it. What do you want me to
say about this? Honestly.

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:15.750
So Zhu Zhu Pets is, like...a hamster simulator
and maze game. How is that even a thing? You

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:21.660
start with one hamster, and you have to...take
care of it. You have to water the hamster,

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:27.500
feed the hamster, pet the hamster...put it
in the toilet. You can�t flush the toilet,

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:31.730
unfortunately. The hamsters all have needs,
like any pet simulator, so you�re giving

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:37.459
them what they need like a human slave to
your hamster masters.

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:42.620
Who�s really running in the wheel here?
You tell me.

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:47.690
There are nine Zhu Zhu Pets to unlock in total,
so eventually, you have to multitask to address

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:51.569
their needs. It actually gets a little hectic
for a kid�s game, which is kind of fun.

00:02:51.569 --> 00:02:56.610
Once you�ve done all your nurturing, you
can put the hamsters in these crazy mazes,

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:02.050
which is when things get a little more interesting.
They�re kind of like those plastic hamster

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:06.010
cities, only with freaking ramps and coins.

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:13.730
What do hamsters even...purchase? Like, cedar
chips?

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:20.540
There are about 30 of those mazes, and at
first, they�re kind of fun. Eventually,

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:25.340
that wears off a bit. The game is really repetitive
and shallow, so it�s not long before you�ve

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:29.930
kind of seen everything it has to offer. The
touch controls are nice, but...the gameplay

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:34.280
in the mazes never changes, the sim stuff
is never as deep as something like Nintendogs.

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:45.519
It�s just, it�s a very basic...very kid-friendly
pet simulator and hamster action thing.

00:03:45.519 --> 00:03:50.890
I remember reviewing a Zhu Zhu Pets game for
Wii a long time ago, back when I was yelling

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:56.360
into the microphone. Why was I doing that?
I was new at this whole video thing, and my

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:01.700
hearing was bad. But I remember that game
being a solid little platform game for kids.

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:06.750
This is the same thing. It�s a solid little...whatever
it is, for kids.

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:10.980
If I had to recommend one, I�d go with the
platformer for Wii. To me, that was substantially

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:14.500
more fun than this. Then again, I use the
word �substantially.�

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:18.630
So I�m probably not this game�s target
audience.

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:20.220
I also have balls.

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:25.840
But hey, I still have a bunch of these left
to play. So we�ll see where it goes from

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:31.970
here. Could get better. Could get way worse.
It�s Zhu Zhu Pets for the Nintendo DS.

00:04:31.970 --> 00:04:42.380
It�s like a hamster soup kitchen.
