00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.370
SO WHEN I SAY "RAMEN," I BET I KNOW EXACTLY
WHAT YOU ARE THINKING.

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:06.729
YOU ARE THINKING, YEAH, IT IS THAT STUFF YOU
BUY AT THE GROCERY STORE FOR 20 CENTS IN A

00:00:06.729 --> 00:00:11.710
PLASTIC PACKAGE OR IF YOU ARE FEELING REALLY
FANCY, YOU CAN GET A 30-CENT CUP OF NOODLES.

00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:15.910
AND THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT, TOO, UNTIL I MET
MY FRIEND, MARK HARTSTEIN, WHO IS MY FRIEND,

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:20.610
WHO IS MY NEIGHBOR. HE IS ALSO A COOK ABOUT
TOWN, AND AN AMAZING FOOD INNOVATOR, AND TODAY

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:24.920
I AM CALLING HIM THE RAMEN SHAMAN. ARE YOU
READY, MARK?

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:27.750
&gt;&gt; SURE.
&gt;&gt;HE'S READY. I AM LISA BRALTS, AND THIS IS

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:34.750
"BACKYARD INDUSTRY."

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
&gt;&gt;&gt; WE ARE HAVING A POP-UP.
IT IS GOING TO BE AT MY FRIEND'S COLLABORATIVE
KITCHEN. IT IS CAFETERIA AND COMPANY.

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:08.000
THEY HAVE A PIZZERIA AND A COFFEE SHOP IN
ONE LOCATION.

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:13.450
THEY WORK OUT OF ONE KITCHEN. WE ARE TAKING
OVER ON THE NIGHT THEY ARE CLOSED, TUESDAY.

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:17.729
WE ARE GOING TO GO IN IN THE MORNING AND PREP
ALL THE FOOD THERE IN THE KITCHEN. WE ARE

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:20.259
GOING TO BRING ALL OF OUR OWN DISHES, ALL
OF OUR OWN FOOD.

00:01:20.259 --> 00:01:25.509
IT ALL GOES IN IN THE MORNING, AND IT ALL
GETS BUILT UP THROUGH THE DAY, AND SERVE IT

00:01:25.509 --> 00:01:29.429
THAT NIGHT.
RAMEN IS A JAPANESE FAST FOOD.

00:01:29.429 --> 00:01:34.740
A BOWL OF RAMEN IS BASICALLY RAMEN NOODLES
WITH BROTH AND GARNISHES.

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.409
THERE ARE VERY MANY VARIATIONS OF THE BROTH
AND NOODLES AND GARNISHES, DEPENDING ON THE

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:45.990
REGION OR THE PARTICULARITIES OF THE COOK.
IT WAS DEFINITELY ONE OF THOSE KEY ITEMS OR

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:52.219
KEY FOOD TRENDS OF TAKING STREET FOOD OR LOW
FOOD AND THEN ELEVATING IT UP AND USING MORE

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:58.380
REFINED INGREDIENTS, USING LOCAL INGREDIENTS,
SEASONAL INGREDIENTS, TREATING THEM IN A KITCHEN

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:05.380
WITH A LOT OF RESPECT, AND PRESENTING THEM
ALMOST RELIGIOUSLY IN 
A WAY.

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:21.000
RAMEN--WHAT DIFFERENTIATES RAMEN FROM THIS,
IT IS A FLOUR BASED NOODLE THAT USES WATER.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.170
BUT THE THING ABOUT THE RAMEN NOODLES IS IT
USES SOMETHING KANSUI, WHICH IS AN ALKALI

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:31.530
SALT.
IT CHANGES THE PH OF THE NOODLE.

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:36.010
THAT'S WHY RAMEN NOODLES ARE KIND OF YELLOWISH
BECAUSE THE ALKALINITY OF THE KANSUI ACTUALLY

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:43.010
CHANGES THE PROTEINS IN THE FLOUR AND MAKES
IT FIRMER AND CHEWIER.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:27.800
&gt;&gt;&gt; PARSNIP, CARROTS, CELERY, A BUTT TON OF ONIONS.
I AM ALSO GOING TO ADD GOOD ORGANIC LEEKS,

00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:33.200
AND WE'LL SPIKE IT WITH GINGER AND GARLIC.
LASTLY, THE OTHER THING WE ARE GOING TO PLAY

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:40.200
WITH TODAY IS THIS IS A TERRA ROOT.

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:53.540
SO THE EGGS, WE BOILED FOR SIX MINUTES, NO LONGER, SO THAT THE EGG WHITES ARE STILL PRETTY
FIRM, AND THE YOLKS, CENTER IS STILL CREAMY.

00:03:53.760 --> 00:04:00.270
THEN WE CRASH THE TEMPERATURE IN ICE WATER,
AND THEN WE LET IT SIT FOR A COUPLE HOURS

00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:02.600
IN VINEGAR.
&gt;&gt;YES, THAT'S WHAT I'M SMELLING.

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:08.000
&gt;&gt;SO WHAT THE VINEGAR WILL DO IS HELP US TO
PEEL IT BECAUSE THE EGG IS SOFT.

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000
&gt;&gt;RIGHT. OH, BOY.
&gt;&gt;IT WILL BE TRICKY.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000
MY MAD EGG SKILLS!
&gt;&gt;WOW!

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.500
&gt;&gt;&gt; WE WILL BE DONATING A PORTION OF OUR PROCEEDS
TO THE EASTERN ILLINOIS FOOD BANK WHICH IS

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:24.220
A CHARITY THAT WE HAVE BEEN GIVING TO OFTEN
IN OUR OTHER EVENTS, NOT JUST THE RAMEN EVENTS,

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:28.980
BUT OTHER POP-UPS WE DO.
THERE IS A REASON TO DO THE POP-UPS. IT IS

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:33.000
NOT TO GET MY NAME OUT THERE WHICH I DIDN'T
WANT IN THE FIRST PLACE, BUT IT IS GOING TO

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000
A GOOD CAUSE.
