00:00:00.969 --> 00:00:06.120
OK, to make the adjustment on the valve. This
engine has four valves two intake and two

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.471
exhaust for each cylinder. The intake on the
intake side of the engine and exhaust on the

00:00:10.471 --> 00:00:16.330
exhaust side. The two valve use different
clearances. The exhaust valve using more clearance

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:23.079
because they have a tendency be hotter. In
order to check the clearance you select the

00:00:23.079 --> 00:00:27.489
proper clearance from your feeler gage and
that should be between fifty one and fifty

00:00:27.489 --> 00:00:31.839
seven, I believe, for the intake side and
then you slid that between the rocker arm

00:00:31.839 --> 00:00:43.640
and the cam shaft and it should fit snugly.
Without any excess free play. So we're going

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.780
to slid it in there between the rocker arm
and the cam shaft and then we're going to

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:54.280
break the twelve millimeter nut free and the
valve is adjusted with a slot in the center

00:00:54.280 --> 00:01:00.190
and while holding that retaining nut in place.
You turn clockwise to tighten the valve clearance

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:06.100
or counter clockwise to loosen it. We'll adjust
each one go down to our snug and then the

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:11.970
feeler gage fits snuggly. Once we've got it
adjusted correctly then we'll tighten down

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:20.580
that locking nut and then recheck it again
and we'll do that on each valve. You can break

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.560
them free with a twelve millimeter socket
it gets you a little better torque and with

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:32.210
an extension it you got better accessibility.
But when it comes time for tightening a twelve

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:37.743
millimeter box end wrench works best because
you have to have clearance to get to the adjustment

00:01:37.743 --> 00:01:44.450
slot in the top while your holding the nut.
You could use an open end box wrench but it

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:54.590
has a tendency to slide off. Easier than a
box end and see it's difficult here to get

00:01:54.590 --> 00:02:02.360
the right angle with the socket. Accessibility
can be a little difficult. So once I've broken

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:11.980
the retaining nut free then I'm going to adjust
this center till it becomes snug, tight. Checking

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:16.250
the feeler gage with each adjustment. You
just want to feel good drag or tension on

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:22.550
that like you've lightly sandwiched it between
the two and what I like to do is turn down

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:29.310
I'll back it off first counter clockwise and
then I'll turn down tightening clockwise.

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:34.580
Until it becomes snug and then I give it maybe
about fifteen to twenty degrees further and

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:40.739
I found that to work really well and then
while holding the center in place. You don't

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:44.950
want to turn the center piece while you're
tightening down the retaining nut cause that

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:50.530
changes the clearance and while your holding
in place. You can go ahead and tighten down

00:02:50.530 --> 00:03:05.260
the retaining nut. After you've got it snug
then you need to recheck your clearance again

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:12.210
and to do this go ahead and pull the feeler
gage all the way out. Check the free play

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:17.739
again and then slide it back in and then make
sure that you don't have any debris that might

00:03:17.739 --> 00:03:22.330
have got hung up underneath something during
your adjustment and if it fits real snugly

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:27.480
going back in. You got a good bit of drag
then that means that valve is properly adjusted.

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:33.620
So that concludes part one of adjusting valves.
Please watch our next segment on part two

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:34.780
of adjusting valve.
