Visit Osaka Japanese Steak House and Sushi
Bar for the finest quality sushi and sashimi

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:10.410
in Houma Louisiana.

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.939
Watch Master Sushi Chef Darren as he
implements his culinary skills into action

00:00:14.939 --> 00:00:20.990
and prepares this 102 lb Yellow Fin Tuna for
a variety of awesome dishes.

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:24.640
This select sushi grade
Louisiana Gulf Tuna is one of the reasons

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:27.890
Osaka is known for excellent Asian cuisine.

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:34.280
Osaka uses only fresh, sushi grade, Louisiana
Gulf yellow fin tuna that is hand selected

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:35.940
from their regular tuna supplier.

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:40.110
To guarantee proper
sushi grade tuna, highly experienced tuna

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.340
graders must measure the fat content in the
meat for quality assurance.

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:49.420
The fat content is a very important factor
in properly grading this species and actually

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:52.650
determines the market value of each individual
fish.

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:57.920
The higher the fat content, the better the
quality of tuna, which dictates a higher market

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.010
value and served in restaurants that demand
a better

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:03.550
grade of product for their customers.

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:08.580
Many restaurants claim to use fresh fish for
their sushi and sashimi dishes, but in fact

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:11.290
use vacuum packed products from purveyors.

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:13.890
As this
presentation demonstrates, this is not the

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:51.770
case with the fish being served at Osaka.

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:57.119
