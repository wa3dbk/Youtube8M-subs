00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.009
the previous masa 3 used to be the
alternative to the alternative

00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:09.490
attack was almost medieval inside that
car so for 2014 Mazda gave some new life

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:13.530
in some new tech to their compact 3 a
new design that fits with its more

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:14.589
expensive brother

00:00:14.589 --> 00:00:17.680
the mazda6 and tech to compete with most
of its competitors

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:21.970
so let's take a look at the tech inside
this 2014 Mazda three hatch

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:28.970
up there are a lot of great material
inside here some really nice leather

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:32.529
synthetic leather soft touch touch
points just about everywhere

00:00:32.529 --> 00:00:35.610
there is a bit a plastic still left from
center console region but other than

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:36.070
that

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:41.350
mostly things are pretty good I even do
dig this photo carbon fiber treatment on

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:42.149
the steering wheel

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:45.420
and the doors i'd other fake but it is a
nice touch

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.840
and then we can turn our attention to
display you might be asking why is it

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:49.800
sticking up like that

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.840
well I have the same question but here
is a great news and finally I can say

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:55.350
this

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.050
this is not running tom-toms navigation
system this is monsters first attempt at

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:00.730
making their

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:04.570
own infotainment system usually
first-generation don't go too well

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:08.659
this one however is a pretty functional
one and it looks great

00:01:08.659 --> 00:01:11.920
first call you are greeted by this menu
system but it is a touch screen if

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:13.540
you're wondering you can touch things

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:17.460
but it's a lot more easy to use me put
his goalie on the bottom here

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:20.830
so under applications you actually don't
have a story only have these

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:25.220
select few applications yet HD radio
traffic map we have fueled timely manner

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:28.450
maintenance warning guidance and vehicle
data transfer

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:32.220
don't ask you the last one is I don't
know have a scroll wheel here is a very

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.220
functional when you have scroll left to
right in you up down left to right in

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:38.500
your also happy shortcut buttons for
music

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:42.170
basically entertainment home navigation
you have your favorite spun and the go

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.890
back button

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:47.520
130 Metab do you have your listing audio
sources you have a about that yet except

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:48.079
haha

00:01:48.079 --> 00:01:51.770
Pandora stitcher Bluetooth USB one in
usb2

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:54.799
the best thing about using bluetooth
streaming on this car is you get four

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:58.070
men attacks from your iPhone or Android
device which is very good

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:01.659
no don't do a navigation system this is
their first generation system and its

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:02.430
kinda

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:06.549
not finish yet you have an option to the
mapping and 3d mapping is kinda funny

00:02:06.549 --> 00:02:10.220
driving through downtown only thing a
cup or Hampel buildings actually

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:14.560
coming out on the map it I were you I
would stick with the 2d mapping because

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.440
he kinda gets a little weird especially
having one building in a crowded

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:19.629
downtown arena

00:02:19.629 --> 00:02:23.300
important destination address as goes
two ways either say it's more important

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:24.420
for you to scroll wheel

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.480
or a touch screen let's give the boys
entry option it right

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.900
235 second Street Nashville Tennessee

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:37.900
what

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:42.300
for me because I hurt my number you can
all things for me

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:45.930
to my income or school step by step into
infantry

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:49.800
but one what

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:54.080
to begin the application for me you can
see a force treated resident picks up

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:56.760
all the information at one time I
haven't had many

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.120
miss confusions with the system so it's
a very good effort by Mazda

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:03.810
extra hot hatch opening lines but it is
a quick car your side paddle shifters

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:07.190
trust to a sluggish but he kills six
speed automatic transmission

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:12.209
PL turn yourself it will hurt Top Gear
however there is a sport button but I'm

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:16.060
not exactly sure what it does it seems
bound automatic

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:19.680
it will lie heading into gear for a lil
bit longer than usual but

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:23.180
the other been bad I'm not exactly sure
what it does there is no

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:27.890
active suspension ur engine mapping or
anything I think it just basically

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:32.820
takes on a little longer for your change
in sport mode instead about an attic

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:36.260
gonna drive this car took a civilized
person against a very good right now

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.510
both are you with something through the
system here

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:42.780
it delivers natural sound that's a very
good idea of this and I think

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:46.810
I thought we not be banging the one with
the Bang &amp; Olufsen stereo system on an

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:49.400
hour eat but you don't pay that much to
get one

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:53.519
so that we take the both of them had on
their side view mirrors on this car are

00:03:53.519 --> 00:03:56.260
enormous I don't think martha has one
single person

00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:59.989
working on the aerodynamics around us
Thanks make a lot of noise

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:04.360
please change that I'm going to sign
this car is really fun to drive miles

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:06.799
above always not be more fun car to
drive

00:04:06.799 --> 00:04:10.049
especially more fun mature and grow up
not were

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:14.049
normal Honda Civic this one is no
exception it's been really fun to drive

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:15.410
its really sporty

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:18.700
I mean you can have fun in the small
monarchs back

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:23.250
that is completely possible yet you
still get 30 miles to the gallon

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:27.560
not breathing really fun rain you have
to drive a retard the masa

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:31.550
32 foreign package you do you have words
want action warning

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:35.590
great departure warning well for her
passive about exactly how I like it

00:04:35.590 --> 00:04:39.130
I don't want the card a vibrator shaker
move itself

00:04:39.130 --> 00:04:42.419
when I'm doing something wrong I'd
rather have you morton or more

00:04:42.419 --> 00:04:44.690
justification hey you're getting out
here lame

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:46.870
I not exactly what this one done
