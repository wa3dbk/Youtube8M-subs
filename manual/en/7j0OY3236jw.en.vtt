Welcome to Storyline Online, brought to you by the Screen Actors Guild Foundation.

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.580
I'm Betty White, and I think we're going to have a good time today!

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:16.080
At least I know I am. I'm going to be reading you a book, okay.

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:21.240
I love animals, all animals, but maybe dogs in particular.

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.789
So today, I'm going to be reading you a story about Harry the Dirty Dog.

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:32.009
It's by Gene Zion, pictures by Margaret Bloy Graham.

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:36.980
Harry was a white dog with black spots who liked everything,

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:39.320
except getting a bath.

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.140
So, one day, when he heard the 
water running in the tub,

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:49.060
he took the scrubbing brush... and buried it in the backyard.

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:53.520
Then he ran away from home.

00:00:54.580 --> 00:01:00.320
He played where they were fixing the street and got very dirty.

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:05.960
He played at the railroad and got even dirtier.

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:12.620
He played tag with other dogs and became dirtier still.

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:18.290
He slid down a coal chute and got the dirtiest of all.

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:26.060
In fact, he changed from a white dog with black spots to a black dog with white spots.

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:37.900
Although there were many other things to do, Harry began to wonder if his family thought that he had really run away.

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:48.060
He felt tired and hungry too, so without stopping on the way, he ran back home.

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:55.840
When Harry got to his house, he crawled through the fence 
and sat looking at the back door.

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:02.220
One of the family looked out and said, "There's a strange dog in the backyard...

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:05.040
By the way, has anyone seen Harry?"

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:13.180
When Harry heard this, he tried very hard to show them he was Harry.

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:20.680
He started to do all his old, clever tricks. He flip-flopped and he flop-flipped.

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.440
He rolled over and played dead.

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.480
He danced and he sang.

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:32.740
He did these tricks over and over again, but everyone shook their heads and said,

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:35.360
"Oh no, it couldn't be Harry."

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:46.400
Harry gave up and walked slowly toward the gate, but suddenly he stopped.

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:51.240
He ran to a corner of the garden and started to dig furiously.

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:57.640
Soon he jumped away from the hole barking short, happy barks.

00:02:57.640 --> 00:02:59.940
He'd found the scrubbing brush!

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:03.580
And carrying it in his mouth, he ran into the house.

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:07.560
Up the stairs he dashed, 
with the family following close behind.

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:14.749
He jumped into the bathtub and sat up begging, with the scrubbing brush in his mouth,

00:03:14.749 --> 00:03:17.680
a trick he certainly had never done before.

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:21.700
"This little doggy wants a bath!" cried the little girl,

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:25.680
and her father said, "Why don't you and your brother give him one?"

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:33.140
Harry's bath was the soapiest one he'd ever had. It worked like magic.

00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:37.880
As soon as the children started to scrub, they began shouting,

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:42.440
"Mummy! Daddy! Look, look! Come quick!

00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:46.959
It's Harry! It's Harry! It's Harry!" they cried.

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:51.800
Harry wagged his tail and was very, very happy.

00:03:51.800 --> 00:04:01.760
His family combed and brushed him lovingly, and he became once again a white dog with black spots.

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:07.029
It was wonderful to be home.

00:04:07.029 --> 00:04:11.339
After dinner, Harry fell asleep in his favorite place,

00:04:11.339 --> 00:04:16.299
happily dreaming of how much fun it had been getting dirty.

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:24.500
He slept so soundly, he didn't even feel the scrubbing brush he'd hidden under his pillow.

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:32.780
Did you like that? 
Well you're going to like this even better.

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:34.040
This is my friend Ringo.

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:39.500
I just met him, but he's a shelter puppy who found a wonderful forever home,

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:47.740
so he has a happy ending just as Harry the Dirty Dog had a happy ending. Thank you.
