Hi Geeks I’m here at accessorygeeks.com.

00:00:15.535 --> 00:00:19.296
We have a little concern with our Samsung impression right here.

00:00:19.297 --> 00:00:23.011
We are not selling the phone but the casing that we sell to go with it.

00:00:23.661 --> 00:00:29.280
It’s a lot easier than he is, but you might find someone with a little bit more finger strict .

00:00:29.281 --> 00:00:37.872
Front  casing is one of the most difficult part. Well what I can I show you is that taking off the casing is a little difficult and pressing it on.

00:00:37.873 --> 00:00:41.494
So that’s what we are gonna show you today here at accessorygeeks.com.

00:00:41.495 --> 00:00:50.480
So here we have the Samsung impression, the casing is a little difficult to __ here. But it is possible, so lets open the rubber.

00:00:50.481 --> 00:00:54.544
Get ready, here, we sort the front and since it's the hardest part.

00:00:54.545 --> 00:01:02.322
So we open it up as so.. pull line it up correctly, these are open spots to go with the utensils there. 

00:01:02.323 --> 00:01:06.107
What I wanna do is just line it up, clip on the bottom.

00:01:06.108 --> 00:01:12.957
Apply pressure using your thumbs upward, and you should here a little click on the back.

00:01:15.186 --> 00:01:23.267
A little bit forces on a little bit tricky on the last. So it should feel nice and snug right there.

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:30.279
Barely across line, you might wanna use your index fingers or thumbs to press more on the side right here.

00:01:31.301 --> 00:01:33.994
The back part is a lot easier.

00:01:33.995 --> 00:01:44.371
What I wanna do is just locate where the camera would go this speaker phone, open it up once more, line up.

00:01:44.372 --> 00:01:53.592
You should hear the snaps on, too easy as that, so we have the impression already to go.. 

00:01:53.593 --> 00:01:57.841
So your Samsung impression is already to go, ready to use.

00:01:44.372 --> 00:02:00.906
The most difficult part is while you’re taking it off.

00:02:00.907 --> 00:02:08.453
What you wanna do is sticking your finger nail inside one of the clips, you’re moving the clip, it should be easy to go .

00:02:08.454 --> 00:02:15.721
__, just easy casing, ya, enjoy your phone.

00:02:15.722 --> 00:02:20.109
