00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.150
What's up guys? Andy with MyTechMethods. This is a Chromecast. It's one of my favorite

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:04.830
devices

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.519
and it's something that I think everybody should have so in this video I'm going to show you

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.679
the Chromecast setup. How to get it set up step by step. It's easy to do but I'm here

00:00:12.679 --> 00:00:14.290
to help, going to show you exactly how to do it

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:21.290
so let's get right into this video the
Chromecast is a thirty dollar device that

00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:23.600
lets you wirelessly stream

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.840
anything from your web browser most likely
video to your HDTV

00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:29.769
the link to the Chromecast for the best price available on Amazon is in

00:00:29.769 --> 00:00:32.710
the description below so let's get right into this Chromecast setup

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:36.640
first let's go over what you need in
order to use and setup your chromecast

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:41.230
you need an HDTV, a WiFi network and a
smartphone or computer

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:45.190
now let's quickly go over the contents of
the box. When you first open the box you'll

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:48.899
see a quick start guide on the inside
cover and you'll see the chromecast itself

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.090
the Chromecast is small about the size of a
thumb drive and it has an HDMI connector

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:53.860
on the end

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:58.079
the rest of the box includes a USB cable, an HDMI extender,

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.469
and the power adapter. The first step is
to plug the small end of the USB cable

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:07.200
into the chromecast. Next connect the
Chromecast to one of your TV's HDMI ports

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.930
If your Chromecast cannot fit into the area near your HDMI port you'll need to

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:11.409
use the

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:14.689
HDMI extender to give it a little more
room to fit properly

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:18.479
next step is to power the chromecast
there are two different ways to do this

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:21.750
one is to use a USB port on your TV if
it has one

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:25.710
if it does just plug the USB cable into
it and it will power the chromecast

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.310
your TV does not have a USB port you'll
need to plug the USB cable

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.470
into the power adapter and plug the
power adapter into an outlet

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:36.299
so once your chromecast is powered on and connected next step is to change your

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:39.619
TV's input or source to the HDMI port that
your Chromecast

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:43.250
is connected to once you're on the
correct HDMI input you'll see a screen

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:43.930
like this

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:47.110
now to set up the Chromecast you can use a smartphone, tablet

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:51.030
or computer but I found it works best
with a smartphone so let's do that but

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:53.060
the process is the same on a computer

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:56.509
open your web browser and go to chromecast.com/setup

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:00.090
and that will open a page with a link to the App Store so click on that

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.509
the app store will open the Chromecast app so click on install

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:08.039
it is a free app. Wait for it to download and
install then open the chromecast app

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:11.400
accept the terms it will scan for
Chromecasts. Okay now

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.890
we'll click set up a new chromecast

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:17.590
now it says to go to your phone's wifi
settings and select your new chromecast

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:20.590
look for the same device name you're
seeing on your TV screen

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:25.470
mines Chromecast 8436. Yours is gonna be different select it and wait for it to

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:26.090
connect

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:29.870
Once it's connected go back to the
Chromecast app and it should say it found a

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:30.720
new chromecast

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.650
then hit next and make sure your input
source is showing the chromecast so

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:35.760
that you see the code

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.530
on your TV screen then hit next. Choose your country

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:42.710
here you can give your Chromecast a custom name for example

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:46.320
I'll name mine Andy's Chromecast and if you're a true fan of mine you'll name it the same

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:46.910
thing

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:51.770
kidding on the screen tap choose WiFi
network and select your WiFi network from the

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:52.270
list

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:56.620
then enter your wifi password now your
chromecast will connect to your WiFi network

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:59.970
and when it's done you'll see that it
has been set up successfully and you're

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:01.300
ready to start casting

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:05.250
you can cast from your smartphone, tablet, and computer as long as they're connected

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:06.470
to your wifi network

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:09.980
it works with many different apps and to
see the full list you can visit

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:11.110
Chromecast.com/apps.

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:14.720
To start casting from your computer
you'll need to be using Google Chrome

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:18.510
which is a free web browser that you can
get from Google.com/chrome

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:22.790
Once you have Chrome on your computer
open it and search Google for "chromecast

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:27.550
extension" and click the first result. Click the free button and add the extension

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:28.220
to Chrome

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:31.690
once it has been added you'll see the
new chromecast icon in the top right

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:34.970
of your browser that's what you'll click
to cast to your TV

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:39.590
so for example to cast a YouTube video to
your TV while on the YouTube video watch

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:41.140
page you can click the chromecast

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:44.700
icon in the bottom right of the video or
click on the Chromecast icon in the top

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:45.770
right of your browser

00:03:45.770 --> 00:03:49.860
and choose your Chromecast in the drop down menu. Once you do that it will start to play

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:52.550
the YouTube video on your TV pretty cool
huh

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:56.510
and this works with any browser window in
Chrome it also works with sites like

00:03:56.510 --> 00:04:00.850
HBO Go and just many more different web
sites now I'll show you how it works

00:04:00.850 --> 00:04:04.450
on your smartphone or tablet first make
sure your phone or tablet is connected

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:06.910
to your wifi network then open a
compatible

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:11.210
app such as YouTube and now you'll see a
chromecast icon in the app or on the

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:12.280
video that's playing

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:15.740
so tap on the icon and choose your
chromecast name and it will send the

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:17.270
video straight to your TV

00:04:17.270 --> 00:04:20.670
and when the video is playing through your
chromecast you don't have to keep your

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:21.250
phone

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:25.710
unlocked you can lock your phone and the
video will continue to play on your TV

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:29.879
which is awesome to stop casting just
tap the chromecast icon again and tap

00:04:29.879 --> 00:04:30.810
disconnect

00:04:30.810 --> 00:04:35.270
so that is how to set up and use your
Google Chromecast I freaking love this

00:04:35.270 --> 00:04:35.840
thing

00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:39.219
I use it every day and it's helped me get
through life without paying for cable

00:04:39.219 --> 00:04:43.189
so I highly recommend getting this for
yourself and it also makes a great gift for

00:04:43.189 --> 00:04:44.560
family members and friends

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:48.120
so for 30 bucks you can't beat that
value again the link to this is in the

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:49.060
