00:00:01.690 --> 00:00:05.040
Hi there, you may not know me, but I sure know you...

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:07.050
actually I don't...

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:10.140
but whatever, let's talk about human progress.

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:11.879
... and gaming.

00:00:12.279 --> 00:00:16.679
when I say human progress, I specifically mean the advance of science and technology

00:00:16.679 --> 00:00:21.510
and since in the 21st century gaming is completely connected to technology

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:24.570
computer and video games are quite literally...

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:25.670
human progress...

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:29.230
So! An amazing new title just came out,

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:30.250
you've probably heard of it...

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:31.750
Rome 2 total war.

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:36.250
The world became a better place.

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.150
That game is going to become A LEGEND.

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:41.250
Just like Rome 1...

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.050
Rome... total war... They didn't know there's gonna be a "two".

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:49.050
Just for the record. This video is not a promotion of the game...

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:50.450
I just like total war.

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:53.350
TOTAL WAR! TOTAL Annihilation!

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:58.550
Computer gaming has gone a long way for Rome 2 to be born.

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:04.350
The game's size is 35 Gigabytes, and the recommended system requirements for you to run it are right here.

00:01:14.050 --> 00:01:20.250
Of course, covering recommended system requirements doesn't equal running the game on ultra settings.

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.450
Sometimes not even on high.

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:24.850
Buy yourselves new computers.

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:32.850
But, as the game developers had already stated long ago, the minimum requirements are the same as for previous titles.

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.450
Which is quite cool of them.

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:41.750
In contrast to the new Rome, Rome 1, which came out exactly 9 years ago, was 10 times smaller.

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:47.050
And that's quite interesting, because it's somewhat accurately predicted by a law called "Moore's law".

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:53.350
Moore's law roughly states that less than every 2 years computational speed and memory capacity doubles.

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:57.150
Meaning that computers and everything related gets twice as powerful.

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:04.250
Of course, Moore's law... is much broader than that... but I'm not gonna go into details.

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:06.150
You should definitely check it out for yourselves!

00:02:07.650 --> 00:02:11.550
In terms of gameplay Rome 2 promises to be greatly improved.

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:13.650
I can hear my head vibrate...

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:20.850
And... although it's common sense that alongside increasing processing power, AI should get better...

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:23.750
I'm frankly kind of worried...

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:25.850
Empire total war, anyone?

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:30.850
Anyway, in a matter of days we'll know exactly how good the AI's performance is...

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:32.850
is....

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:37.050
Apart from that the Creative Assembly added some exciting new features, like...

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:44.350
Cities being completely unique and retaining their specific traits both on the campaign map and on the battle map.

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:47.450
That's actually a huge improvement from previous titles,

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:50.950
especially Shogun 2, where you'd get...

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:52.550
almost the same...

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:53.550
generic...

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:54.750
siege environments...

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:55.750
over and over again.

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:00.050
40 versus 40 unit battles, and tactical view.

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:02.550
We're onto tactical map view now.

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:07.250
As you see, the enemy is pressing upon that line, so I'm gonna have to get back into the action...

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:08.750
and reform.

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:10.050
Tactical map.

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:15.050
And this one I really like...

00:03:15.050 --> 00:03:16.950
Merging land and naval battles.

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:22.050
Total war first implemented naval battles in Empire total war.

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:39.950
And now, more than 4 years later, the two battle modes are seamlessly combined.

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:43.850
Could that mean combined Airplane and land battles in the future?

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:46.350
Total world war... 1 and 2?

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:50.350
A guy can dream, right?

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:54.050
But let's not get too carried away.

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:57.250
What I love about total war titles and computer games...

00:03:57.250 --> 00:04:00.650
Is that... they actually teach you useful skills.

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:03.350
Although... it's probably pretty hard to notice...

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:07.050
They require logical and prospective thinking and that's always good for your brain.

00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:11.950
Plus... total war series teach you to appreciate history... Which is amazing.

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:16.850
Either that, or they... teach you that it's totally fine for Romans to talk in English.

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:17.650
Meh!...

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:21.350
Rome 2 is an amazing game and I'm gonna have lots of fun playing it.

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:26.750
What about you guys? Also, what future total war titles do you think that we'll see?

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:29.750
Finally - Graphics.

00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:33.650
A popular saying states that... you can't judge a book by its cover...

00:04:35.850 --> 00:04:38.350
And that's actually totally true.

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:40.450
When it comes to strategy games...

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:45.250
Complexity, balance and a good challenge are of utmost importance.

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:46.650
But, frankly...

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:48.850
Isn't it just great to watch these guys march?

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:50.950
Oh wow, that's beautiful.

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:55.950
Yeah, the cinematic cam, putting you on the, sort of, the shoulders of your troops...

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:58.750
Is definitely a feature, that's gonna lose me...

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:02.350
more battles than anything else, because....

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:05.650
I can just sit here and just watch now... and I'm done...

00:05:05.650 --> 00:05:06.350
My job is done...

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:15.850
Thank you for wasting your time, listening to my crap and also a big thanks to Lionheart,

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:19.650
who let me use his footage that he recorded at CA's headquarters...

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:23.950
He's an amazing total war player, and you should totally check his channel out.
