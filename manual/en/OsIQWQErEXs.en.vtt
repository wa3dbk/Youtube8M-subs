00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:21.055
Ruth Richards: I’m Ruth Richards and I’m the subject leader

00:00:21.055 --> 00:00:22.727
in planning and housing in the

00:00:22.727 --> 00:00:25.104
department of Urban, Environment and Leisure Studies.

00:00:25.104 --> 00:00:28.682
We provide courses in planning, housing and tourism

00:00:28.682 --> 00:00:32.444
and pretty much all of our courses are professionally accredited

00:00:32.444 --> 00:00:35.840
by the relevant professional institutes.

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:41.535
Past students have jobs in a wide range of places,

00:00:41.535 --> 00:00:47.778
central government, local government, organisations like the environment agency

00:00:47.778 --> 00:00:51.278
and regeneration agencies and even currently

00:00:51.278 --> 00:00:55.432
the president of our professional institute is one of our past students.

00:00:58.749 --> 00:01:01.910
Mark Plummer : My name is Mark Plummer and I am a team leader

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:03.974
in the department for communities and local government.

00:01:03.974 --> 00:01:08.754
I lead a small team with particular responsibility for developing

00:01:08.754 --> 00:01:12.229
and implementing national planning policy on minerals and waste,

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:15.886
and ensuring that it’s done so in a manner consistent with the government’s

00:01:15.886 --> 00:01:19.961
overall objective of sustainable development and planning.

00:01:21.084 --> 00:01:27.223
I did a Masters in Planning, Policy and Practice at South Bank University.

00:01:27.223 --> 00:01:31.611
It was a great opportunity to understand how planning was applied

00:01:31.611 --> 00:01:33.414
in different countries across Europe.

00:01:33.414 --> 00:01:38.508
One of the strengths of the course I went on was an opportunity

00:01:38.508 --> 00:01:42.740
to go on a field visit to Barcelona where I 
 learnt an awful lot about the planning system

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:47.000
in Spain and how different that was to the planning system in this country.

00:01:47.233 --> 00:01:50.080
Ruth Richards : I think that South Bank is 
 a really fun place to study 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.420
and I think that the tutors really care about making sure

00:01:53.424 --> 00:01:55.930
the students excel in their studies and

00:01:55.931 --> 00:01:58.460
that they excel in their work places and in their future lives.
