00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:08.309
Alright we are going to talk about a few slides
now. And sliding is very important in determining

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:13.259
whether you are going to be safe or out on
a close play. If you are running and you have

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:21.730
a bad slide, if you have a late slide you
are at risk for being called out, for being,

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:26.180
called interfered with if you run into a player.
So it is very important to understand the

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:31.690
right way to slide. The first slide we are
going to talk about is just a regular foot

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:42.039
first bent leg slide. What’s going to happen
is as you get close to the base you’re going

00:00:42.039 --> 00:00:50.129
to start to bend this leg and go down and
you slide and end up being like this with

00:00:50.129 --> 00:00:52.960
your foot first. The other slide we are going
to talk about is a popup slide. It is very

00:00:52.960 --> 00:01:03.140
similar to that except when you go in you’re
going to get down and your momentum is going

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.680
to allow you to hit the base and popup right
when you get to the base. So you use, you

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:15.250
utilize the spikes on your shoes or your cleats
to popup at second base. Again, slide, get

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:25.520
down, you’ll be sliding, use your spikes
to stop and they’ll pop you back up. The

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.980
last thing we are going to talk about is a
head first slide. It’s the most common slide

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:34.860
for people stealing second base. You might
want to avoid it more when you are in a close

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:40.320
play at home because you could injure your
shoulder, injure your arm if the catcher lands

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:46.490
on you or something like that. But a head
first slide is just what it sounds like. Going

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:55.510
in you slowly get low and then use your arm
and your head to navigate to the base before

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:57.440
the ball can tag you.
