00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:06.020
Hi, my name is Chell Garcia-Trias, and I'm
a modern dance instructor in Austin, Texas.

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:12.730
I'm going to show you how to find proper alignment
in modern dance. So I'm going to do that by

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:17.800
finding--I'm going to put my hands on my back,
and I'm going to find my spine. And if I follow

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:25.280
my spine down, down, down, I'll find a little
spot pretty low down where I'll find my tail

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:30.880
bone, and it tucks under. It goes like this--a
little hook. I'm going to put my hand on that

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:38.680
tail bone. And then I'm also going to find
the crown of my head. When I feel like I found

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:45.620
it, I'm going to gently pull up on it. You
should feel your neck or your chin fall slightly

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:49.781
back into your neck when you do that. Usually
we stand with our head sticking out. So we're

00:00:49.781 --> 00:00:55.810
going to pull our neck back. And if I rock
my head side to side, pulling on this spot,

00:00:55.810 --> 00:01:00.890
it should pivot gently. There shouldn't be
any swing to it. If you find that you're swinging

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:06.439
your neck out, then you haven't found the
right spot. So try it again. So find that

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:14.840
crown, pull up on it. Now I want to imagine
little bits of air forming between each of

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:22.520
the vertebrae in my spine, so that my spine
goes from being collapsed and crooked to being

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:29.130
straight and open. And I do that by reaching
down with my tail bone, and reaching up with

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.170
the crown of my head. So you want to do this
for a little while, just stand here and nod

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:38.600
side to side, feel that connection between
your tail bone and your head. If you want

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:43.200
you can bounce a little bit here and see if
you can keep that connection. And once you

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:49.560
feel like you've really found it, you'll let
it go and just gently walk around the room,

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.959
and see if you feel a little bit different.
See if you feel a little taller, and more

00:01:53.959 --> 00:01:59.280
open. So that's a great way to find proper
alignment in your spine in modern dance.
