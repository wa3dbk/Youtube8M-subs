hi I'm Chris freytag, national health
and fitness expert.

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:06.290
Today we're going to make gluten-free
blueberry muffins

00:00:06.290 --> 00:00:09.830
and to get started, we're  going to start with
the dry ingredients first. So I've

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:10.830
already combined

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.219
all the dry ingredients into this bowl
here and I'm going to pour them

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:18.660
right into my mixing bowl and what's in
here is the brown rice flour, the potato

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:19.570
starch,

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:22.800
the tapioca flour, sugar,

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.900
baking powder, and salt. So all those, I
put together. Then we also need some

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:27.510
BiPro

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.090
whey protein. Remember that BiPro is
naturally gluten-free.

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:34.710
and I'm going to scoop a quarter cup
right here

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:38.450
and BiPro is also unflavored and I think
that's a really

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:42.140
that's a perk because it doesn't
taint the flavor of what you're making. It's

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:44.670
completely unflavored so you can and get
some extra protein

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.829
but you still get the flavor the recipe what
you're actually making.

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:52.469
Now once we put the dry ingredients in and we're going to add eggs. I've got my two eggs

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:55.960
ready to go. Some milk and oil which I've

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.850
already measured out, vanilla

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:03.910
always makes recipes delicious and we're going to mix it together.

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:07.130
So take a spatula, got to break those egg
yolks.

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:10.680
Mixed it together to make the batter and

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:14.619
we're just going to stir it up and then once we get it

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:17.780
well mixed together here. Got to get that egg.

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:21.189
Alright, we're going to add the blueberries so fold in

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:24.890
one and a half cups of blueberries. I'm
just get that egg mixed in.

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:28.210
You can use fresh blueberries, maybe even frozen just

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:33.420
put them in there and then you got your
batter. Then you're goning to take your

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:36.869
muffin tin over here and line it with paper.
Preheat your oven.

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:42.299
Fill the muffin tin with batter as
begun here. We've already baked them

00:01:42.299 --> 00:01:45.579
and look what you get. These gorgeous
golden brown

00:01:45.579 --> 00:01:49.250
blueberry gluten-free muffins. YUM!
