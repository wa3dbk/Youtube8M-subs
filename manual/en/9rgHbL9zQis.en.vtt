I met Jim Irving in 2001 when he was making wine and I

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:20.430
was running wine and spirits
distributorship

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.910
uh... in 2002 he figured
pretty quickly that he needed somebody

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:29.950
to distribute his wine because he couldn't do it
and make wine so he hired me

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:31.829
me to sell his wine

00:00:31.829 --> 00:00:33.350
as a distributor

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:39.420
uh... we started Firefly Distilling
Company in 2004

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:43.010
and by 2006 we made our
first product which is our muscadine wine

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:48.340
flavored vodka out of his muscadine wine
we had to make our first product in

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:53.920
Florida because the laws of South Carolina
would not permit us to do it

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:59.780
so we had to get a couple laws changed
which we did in 2006 and 2009

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:03.590
2006 we have the the uh...
law changed because they gave us the capability to distill

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:05.360
here on property

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.770
which really gave Jim, my
partner Jim, is just twenty years older than me

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:11.790
and has a degree in chemistry from

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.820
Vanderbilt and he's a wine maker and a distiller

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.990
uh... by being able to do it here verses
doing it in Florida gave him the opportunity to do a

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.690
lot of uh... experimentation

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:25.729
this is where we do all the tastings
where all the flavor

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:31.090
uh... comes up we make
everything here before it goes

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:36.080
onto bottling line or anyone else tastes it
my dad and I will sit back here and Scott

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:42.680
will sit back here and taste different um...
flavors and see what we can come up with

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:46.810
and it's really fun

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:52.689
uh... for years people have been making
ice picks and cocktails with tea or sweet tea

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:55.510
and vodka or sweet tea and bourbon

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:59.939
uh... the idea to put in a bottle was was
mine and my partner is the one

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:00.919
that actually

00:02:00.919 --> 00:02:03.409
created the formula for it

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:05.609
we use South Carolina tea

00:02:05.609 --> 00:02:10.970
from the tea plantation which as the crow flies
is like two miles away from here and

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:14.909
it's the only tea plantation in America
the only working tea plantation

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:20.879
and uh... so we wanted you know to keep
everything local our ingredients local

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:26.569
um... so we use the South Carolina tea
in our sweet tea

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:29.739
in this distillery everything that we do
is done by hand

00:02:29.739 --> 00:02:36.999
we don't use any automation um...
we hand bottle from a gravity feeder

00:02:36.999 --> 00:02:40.889
from that it goes to a hand capper
the guy puts the caps on by hand

00:02:40.889 --> 00:02:47.829
they hand label the bottles they handpack the
bottles hand tape the boxes

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:51.310
and there's no machine that ever touches
any of it we don't even use

00:02:51.310 --> 00:02:53.560
force fillers to bottle the

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:57.279
to bottle the product

00:02:57.279 --> 00:02:58.249
so it's all gravity filled

00:02:58.249 --> 00:03:00.209
it fits really nice

00:03:00.209 --> 00:03:01.949
so it's nice

00:03:01.949 --> 00:03:04.559
like an organic process

00:03:04.559 --> 00:03:08.989
the most recognized state flag in the
union is the Texas flag

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:14.479
the second most recognized state
in the United States flag is South Carolina

00:03:14.479 --> 00:03:19.619
people don't really know that our goal is to
make the South Carolina flag the most recognized

00:03:19.619 --> 00:03:22.229
flag in the United States so it's on all
of our labels
