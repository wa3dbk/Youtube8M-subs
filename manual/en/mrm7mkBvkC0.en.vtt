00:00:00.659 --> 00:00:04.820
We're about to start a basic horsemanship
session and we're going to identify those

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:10.429
things, within the rider and the horse partnership,
that will bring us to our best outcome. When

00:00:10.429 --> 00:00:16.230
we begin to work with our horse, we want to
think of it, in as simple as terms as possible.

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:21.820
We're going to look at two basic lines, that
help keep us in balance with the horse and

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:27.400
help us to go towards, what we call development
of our seat and our leg, that's so important

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:33.600
in the skill of horseback riding. My rider
here is going to sit up tall, good posture,

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.910
high up out of her seat bones, as she creates
then a nice straight line from her ear, to

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:44.140
her shoulder, her hip, to her heel. We want
to have the leg relaxed naturally at our side,

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:49.000
with the balls of our feet only, in the stirrups
and the heels go down because we flex our

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:55.090
ankle. We don't want to have kind of a stiffness
through that leg position. We want to have

00:00:55.090 --> 00:01:00.510
our tone, from the knee up, as that, which
helps secure us, so that our seat and our

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:06.000
hips can follow the movement of this horse.
We want to reserve everything from our knee

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.630
down. Our calf muscle, through and into our
heel, for the communication of the horse because,

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:15.770
although we may not think of ourselves as
horse trainers when we embark in this sport,

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:21.290
any time we're on a horse, we are training.
So we want to do our best to communicate effectively,

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:25.700
which comes very much from that position,
where our knee down, is reserved for that

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:30.990
communication. Our other straight line is
going to be from our elbow all the way on

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:36.730
through to the horse's mouth. We want to hold
our reins. We're choosing to use a two handed

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:42.840
method today. In Western riding, we train
and school our horses, most often, in two

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:48.430
handed riding. Some of the sports go on to
continue with that, barrel racing, team pinning,

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:54.820
ranch sorting, junior horse classes in Western
pleasure or other breed shows but once the

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:59.360
horse reaches five years old, in a lot of
competitions, we would go to a one handed

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:03.280
method, as well as, in cutting and reining.
Today we're going to look at the straight

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:07.630
line that comes from the two handed method.
Knowing that we want to communicate all the

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:13.020
way through that straight line, holding our
reins correctly, thumbs on top, hands in,

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:17.680
what we call a mirror image, so that we can
create that fine tone and articulation that

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:24.950
comes from that position. With all these things
together, this rider's ready to go on out

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:26.310
and begin her performance.
