Hi everyone. This is Galaxy Assault. 

00:00:11.359 --> 00:00:14.569
If you're looking for a challenging game this weekend this has got it.

00:00:14.569 --> 00:00:20.090
It's a bullet storm hell style game so essentially sideways scrolling.

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:24.240
I'm a strange bug-eyed alien thing that shoots lasers out of its eyes and other

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:29.609
assorted strangeness and the idea is to survive basically to destroy as many things as

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:34.670
you can, gain as many points as you can grabbing the power-ups and not getting splattered in the face by

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:35.850
large creatures.

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.780
Or by bullets.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.910
The gameplay is really really fast and fluid. On the Galaxy Note 2, no slowdowns whatsoever, just

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.480
really really good gameplay...but it's a difficult game.

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:55.620
I'm doing so badly at it today as well. As usual, I'm not quite sat exactly 

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.820
square on.

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:00.550
So it does become a slightly more challenging game to play for me.

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:04.489
But it is a challenging game anyway. When I was playing it yesterday, really really difficult.

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:08.780
In between levels and when you die etcetera and have to reset, you do get adverts. It's a free to play game though

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:10.270
so

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:12.770
that's OK.

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:13.740
And you know

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:18.090
the adverts, while I'm not a big fan when they interrupt the game play in that manner, you know, 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.310
between levels by flipping an advert in,

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:21.100
it's OK, do you know what I mean?

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:23.840
It's not too bad.

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.680
As I say, the gameplay here is really really well done, the graphics are

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:31.270
fantastic the gameplay is fast and furious
and you've really got to keep your

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:34.780
wits about you and watch everything
going on on screen,

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:39.200
not always easy to do when you're
reviewing and talking simultaneously

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.320
at the same time as playing.

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:50.850
To be fair, I have found this game to be a real
challenge. It's a difficult difficult game. You have to like I say

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.430
keep your wits about you all the time watch your position and the 

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:59.840
position of the enemy bullets coming in
to try and dodge them. It gets quite tricky

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.300
later on. The coins allow you to buy upgrades of your weaponry and so on

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:08.899
standard kind of trope with these
kind of games but it's a very very

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:12.630
good execution of a bullet storm hell style game really right up there with some of the 

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:15.609
the best like Raidon and Xenon

00:02:15.609 --> 00:02:18.560
really really great gameplay.

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:28.159
I would certainly recommend grabbing this game and having a play, especially if you are interested

00:02:28.159 --> 00:02:31.889
in titles which are a little bit more difficult, something where you're really going to have to 

00:02:31.889 --> 00:02:33.419
really pay attention and master

00:02:33.419 --> 00:02:34.739
the gameplay.

00:02:34.739 --> 00:02:38.769
Really really excellent game.

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:43.149
Die bug-eyed monstery things. Die!

00:02:43.149 --> 00:02:45.189
Ooh! Missed it!

00:02:45.189 --> 00:02:49.089
You have power-ups as well which you collect 

00:02:49.089 --> 00:02:50.150
for destroying 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:54.450
these creatures and also collecting the coins and power-uppy bits and that allows you,

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:55.229
tap on that and 

00:02:55.229 --> 00:02:57.730
you get a big fireball type thing.

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:04.730
But obviously I need to get a bit better at the game to actually show that.
