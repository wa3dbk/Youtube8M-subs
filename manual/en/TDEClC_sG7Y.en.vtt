NEHA GHERA: Hi, this is Neha on behalf of
Expert Village. Now, again, roast it. Now,

00:00:06.479 --> 00:00:15.360
it depends on how do you like it. Now, again,
you do it. Very softly, use your hands and

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:21.420
roast it. Now, I want in this particular format.
If you want a better thing--I mean, if you

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.220
want a better and a thicker thing, what you
need to do is you need to roast it further.

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:35.339
Now, put it in a circular thing, like very
softly and swiftly. Now, you're almost done,

00:00:35.339 --> 00:00:42.109
as you can see from the--on, I would say,
on the corners. The whole mixture has actually

00:00:42.109 --> 00:00:48.980
got thickened. Now what you need to do is
put off the gas; the things are almost ready.

00:00:48.980 --> 00:01:01.649
Take a small bowl and put the things into
it, say, like...and let's add the semolina

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:18.030
full into the whole bowl. Add some dry fruits
from the top, like this, and serve it with

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.630
a spoon. I'm sure you're going to love this.
Well, this is a recipe just made in like,

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:27.351
say, ten, twenty minutes, and I'm sure that
after lunch or dinner, if you serve this recipe,

00:01:27.351 --> 00:01:31.540
people are going to have them. And as I've
told you, it's a totally Indian, Indian recipe.

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:36.770
Well, if you talk about south India, it's
actually called rava and it's like very popular.

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:41.250
Other than making a sweet dish, it's actually
being used lavishly in other kind of thing.

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:47.040
If you talk about uttapam, you talk about
any other thing, sooji, or this particular

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:52.610
thing, farina, or like--it has different names.
It's used lavishly in India. So, I would just

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:56.640
tell you that try this recipe out and I'm
sure if you want to get it cool and you put

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:01.300
it into a refrigerator, you'll find a different
taste. So try this recipe out. I'm sure you're

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:01.940
going to love it.
