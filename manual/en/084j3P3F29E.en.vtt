00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:11.820
Hello and welcome to the
Indicator Warehouse.

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.690
In today's video, I am going to
be going over the Momentum

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:20.110
Multicolor Line and Bars.

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:24.360
The Momentum Multicolored Line
and Bars indicator is a great

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:28.990
way to detect trend weakness,
as well as reversal points.

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:32.200
Now, the standard momentum
technical analysis indicator

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:36.860
measures the rate of change in
closing prices, and it's used

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:41.580
to detect trend weakness and
likely reversal points.

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:44.830
Now this indicator is often
overlooked because of its

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:46.110
simplicity.

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:49.790
Our Momentum Multicolor Line and
Bars measures the amount

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:53.210
that an instrument's price has
changed over a given time

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:56.780
span, and it expresses
it as a red and

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:58.870
green oscillating line.

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:01.750
Or you can actually use it
as a paint bar tool.

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:04.030
I'll show you how to do that
in just a few minutes.

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:07.420
There are several different ways
you can use the Momentum

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:10.320
Multicolor Line and
Bars indicator.

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.020
One of the things I'd like to
point out-- one of its great

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.570
uses-- is you can use the
Momentum Multicolor Line and

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:20.120
Bars indicator as a
leading indicator.

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:23.630
Now this method assumes that the
market tops are typically

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:28.780
identified by a rapid price
increase, basically when

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:32.320
everybody expects price to go
lower or higher, and then the

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:37.840
market bottoms typically end
with a rapid price decline, or

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.450
basically when everybody
wants to get out.

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:43.500
Let's go ahead, and let's take
a quick look at that.

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.090
Of course, it's very clear to
see that we're definitely in a

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:51.210
downward direction right here
in regarding price movement

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.980
here with the oil market.

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:56.660
If we notice down here, look
at where the Momentum

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:59.240
Multicolor oscillator
bottoms out.

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.060
What we're actually seeing is,
we're starting to see the

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.660
downward price movement weaken
right here, as the Momentum

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:11.470
Multicolor line starts to
bottom out and turn.

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:14.380
Another handy feature
of the Momentum

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:16.550
Multicolor line is this--

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:19.480
I like to use it as a
trending indicator.

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.380
And simply put, if my oscillator
is above the zero

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.650
line, I'm looking
for long trades.

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:31.580
And if my oscillator is red and
below the zero line, then

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:34.100
I'm looking to take
short trades.

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:37.690
It's a great indicator to use
if you're a trend trader.

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:41.260
Now as I mentioned, you can also
color the bars, which is

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.750
one of the great features about
this indicator as well.

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:47.880
So not only can you see the
color down here on your

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:52.650
oscillator, but if you come in
here to your indicators and

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:53.590
color the bars--

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:55.980
change that to True,
click Apply--

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.630
now it clearly tells you without
even looking at the

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:03.500
oscillator exactly what
the trend is.

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:06.640
Like I was saying, it's a great
leading indicator, as

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.120
far as measuring the
instrument's rate of change.

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.920
Theoretically what we've got
right here is where price

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:16.320
actually does start to change,
and then we do see that

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:20.860
eventually price rises and
we move into an up trend.

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:24.140
So the Momentum Multicolor
line actually gave us the

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:27.300
heads-up back here that we might
want to start thinking

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:30.100
that, well, perhaps there's
going to be a change in market

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:32.220
direction, which we're
seeing right here.

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:35.750
Currently we see price starting
to drop off here on

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:36.760
the oil market.

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:39.050
So we can take a look
at this as well.

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:42.070
We can see where price, it's
kind of started to slough off

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:43.130
here just a little bit.

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:47.060
We can see back here with the
Momentum Multicolor oscillator

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:51.180
that price pretty much peaked
out right here.

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:54.330
And, like I said, it gives
us a heads-up.

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:58.440
Now granted, price still
continued to rise, but it did

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:01.930
give us an early warning back
here that perhaps price will

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:02.930
be weakening.

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:05.830
Now before I close this video
out, there's one thing in

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:08.440
particular that I would
like to point out.

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:12.370
This indicator has a
sophisticated plotting method

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:17.339
that eliminates the typical
mispaint problem associated

00:04:17.339 --> 00:04:20.220
with the standard multicolor
lines.

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:24.300
The plotting of trend changes
are guaranteed accurate

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:29.180
regardless of what
CalculateOnBarClose is set to.

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:34.170
So regardless if it's true or
false, there is no repainting

00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:35.930
on this indicator.

00:04:35.930 --> 00:04:38.730
Well, all right, I hope you
enjoyed this video and found

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:39.840
it to be informative.

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:43.010
