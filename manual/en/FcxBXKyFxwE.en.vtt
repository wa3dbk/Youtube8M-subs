00:00:04.759 --> 00:00:11.980
My favorite shadow boxing drill was taught
to me by the one and only Delen Parsley, Sr.,

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:13.360
DD's dad.

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:16.070
It's called corner to corner.

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:21.760
It's a very basic way of shadow boxing in
a linear fashion.

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:26.800
In this case we're in a ring, so we'll go
from one corner to the other corner.

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.260
And we'll go a round robin in the ring.

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:33.500
It can also be done on a linear line at your
house.

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:38.879
Corner to corner builds your basics, and we're
going to show you how it's done.

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.989
So, Delen, face the direction.

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:48.640
Let's work the jab with the box step forward,
Delen, double jabs.

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.350
Good.

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:52.940
Double jabs.

00:00:52.940 --> 00:00:55.510
Spin a quarter turn.

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:57.659
Spin a quarter turn again.

00:00:57.659 --> 00:01:03.059
How about one-two's coming down the line,
one-two's.

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:04.330
One-two again.

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:07.850
Throw me a nice one, right cross.

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:08.850
Good.

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.940
Throw a hook punch on that.

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:15.430
Quarter turn.

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:22.260
In his quarter turns he might even want to,
spin again.

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:23.350
Keep that foot right there.

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:24.350
Spin again.

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:25.830
He might even want to throw a shot.

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.700
Throw two shots right there.

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:29.030
Quarter turn again.

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:31.250
Throw another two shots.

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:33.040
Quarter turn.

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:35.060
Another two shots.

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:38.910
Throw one two three four forward.

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:40.300
Step to the right.

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:41.880
Right hand left hook.

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.700
Step to the left.

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:44.880
Liver shot.

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:48.750
Left hook to the head.

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:49.750
Do that again.

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:51.340
Liver shot.

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:52.490
To the head.

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:53.490
Good.

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.390
Roll right.

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:58.050
Right hand left hook.

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:00.680
Four straight forward.

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:07.760
So, where we're going with this here is he
can go back and forth, move in properly with

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:13.450
his footwork, punching with good, crisp technique.

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:18.909
He's able to go from one corner to the other
corner, back around, and it gives a trainer

00:02:18.909 --> 00:02:24.680
a good, fresh pair of eyes to look at his
fighter and say, my fighter's looking sharp,

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.919
it's time to move to traditional shadow boxing.
