00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:06.649
You we are in step 4 of the yarn braids style
in this that I will be showing you how to

00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:13.360
do your yarn braids in a rush so when doing
your yarn braids in a rush is done just to

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:19.780
simply make it appear as if your hair is completely
finished this is extremely handy because life

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:25.190
always happens whether or not you have to
go run errands or simply rush off to work

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:30.920
sometimes you're not able to finish your style
so by doing your yarn braids in a rush and

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:37.090
make it appears as if all of your hair is
finished braided so important to do this type

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:43.460
of style you have to make sure that you do
your yarn braids are covering the perimeter

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:49.379
of your head the thickness of your braids
have to be enough to cover up the hair that

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:56.109
is undone so right now it appears as if my
hair is finished but it's simply not so if

00:00:56.109 --> 00:01:02.210
I go ahead and take down my hair you can clearly
tell that I have more my natural hair in the

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:08.250
middle of my head that you see braided so
every time I do my hair when I do my yarn

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:12.550
braids or my zillion braids (micro braids)
or my single braids I want to make sure that

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:18.130
I make sure to go completely around the perimeter
of my head with enough braids to cover up

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:25.350
my hair so I probably have about 4 to 5 braids
in width around the perimeter and you don't

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:32.360
have to braid a lot actually have a home and
a half size hand of your head while I have

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:40.580
braids the edges and no one would you tell
that your hair is not finished braided if

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:46.070
you braided enough the perimeter to cover
up your hair so depending on how thick your

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:51.180
yarn braids are you can probably get away
with three braids going around the edge of

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:57.140
your head or maybe 4 or 5 you just make sure
that you have enough braids braided so that

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:04.550
when you pull them over your hair it doesn't
look like your style is unfinished so that

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:11.330
how you do your yarn braids in a rush and
then step, step number five I'll show you

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.939
the finished results to your yarn braids
