Hi guys today im gonna show you how to make
a ball out of the snake cube this is my cat

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:15.660
here he's a fuzz ball....he's just doing his
thing in the middle so ya just gonna  undo

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:40.280
undo this ball ......yes now there are two
ways of making the ball one is the white part

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:47.780
is covering most of the ball and the other
is covering most of the ball so im gonna show

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:52.120
u both ways but first im gonna start with
the red part so if ur doing the red part ur

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:59.190
gonna see a red triangle here and its gonna
be facing upwards like a ramp so first ur

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:06.119
gonna turn it away from you like that then
ur gonna count two .... one two and turn it

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:16.280
towards you then you gonna count one ...one
and then turn it away from you then you wanna

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:24.350
count two again and turn it away from you
then these two have to meet so you have to

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:32.100
turn this joint here has to turn like this
and then this joint too has to turn like that

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:46.920
sooo now u want to turn this joint and do
this after that u want to do this and this

00:01:46.920 --> 00:02:01.349
and thisss and just repeating it for u thisss
this and this then u want to do the same thing

00:02:01.349 --> 00:02:20.010
this this this and then here's a bit tricky
part u do this okay? then u have to this this

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:30.260
and do that then u wanna turn this but it
really dosen't quite fit so you have to turn

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:38.520
this again and it fits perfectly then your
gonna hold it like this do this turn the last

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:45.780
