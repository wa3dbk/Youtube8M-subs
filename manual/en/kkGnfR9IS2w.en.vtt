00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:08.320
A group of red deer start the day in the early
morning mist.

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:11.900
A sight you might expect to see in a nature
reserve.

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:17.230
But this is actually a military training site
in Germany.

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:27.119
Here at the Grafenwoehr Training Area in Bavaria
there is an abundance of wildlife.

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:30.689
“We have wildlife throughout the area.

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:36.660
We have some of the largest red deer populations
in Western Europe actually located in the

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:37.660
training area.

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:42.570
As well as a number of other protected flora
and fauna species.”

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:47.199
Most people would be surprised to learn that
military training areas hold some of the most

00:00:47.199 --> 00:00:53.460
endangered species of plants and animals,
precisely because they are used by the military.

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.980
But military training sites, which are often
protected in many NATO member states and some

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:04.410
partner countries, are in fact used for more
than training military personnel, serving

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:05.950
as islands of biodiversity.

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:13.870
“You have an area here of about 34000 acres,
roughly about 17000 hectares in size.

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:19.390
One of the premier areas for military training
actually in Europe is Grafenwoehr Training

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:20.409
Area.

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:26.799
But it is also known, or I should say increasingly
being known for as a high high high hotspot

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:28.320
for biodiversity.

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:35.630
So, you have this fascinating win-win combination
between a premier military training area and

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:38.150
also an area of very high ecological value.”

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:42.740
“Probably a lot of people don’t know this
while it is hard to understand.

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:49.990
Actually, military training supports biodiversity
and this is due to the nature of training.

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:55.409
That you have training throughout the landscape
that opens the land and creates bare soil

00:01:55.409 --> 00:02:02.039
and give species that have a hard time to
compete with other species a chance to survive

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:04.060
and to get larger in numbers.”

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:09.940
The US military Grafenwoehr Training Area
offers the largest and most dynamic live-fire

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:16.300
training facility in Europe that also provides
training facilities for NATO countries.

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:24.190
Given the apparently destructive nature of
military training it may seem paradoxical

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:29.190
that sites like these are full of large numbers
of red listed species.

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:34.330
But many of the threatened and endangered
species living on military lands thrive there

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:37.630
because of the disturbance, not despite it.

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:39.520
“Even explosions, they create craters.

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:44.880
You can have a water puddle in the crater
and certain animals live in those water craters,

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:47.310
in the bomb craters.

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.760
Tank tracks are good.

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:53.650
Even erosion, created by military training,
can be positive.

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:59.230
For example, for the kingfisher who lives
in the bankments of eroded creeks or erosion

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:00.230
ditches.

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:04.880
He digs his hole or caves into the embankments.

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:08.200
So, it is actually any kind of military training.”

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:14.620
“Here you can see a typical pond created
by vehicle driving in the training area.

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:21.579
And this is the perfect habitat for the yellow
bellied toad, but also it is a good habitat

00:03:21.579 --> 00:03:24.480
for other animals like frogs or dragonflies.

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:31.630
And these kinds of habitats are getting very
rare in other places in Germany.”

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:38.560
“They need these kind of tracks to survive,
because in former times they lived in areas

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:45.120
of the rivers, but the riverbanks they are
very regulated in our times, so there the

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:52.430
toad doesn’t have a habitat anymore and
so the last places where they live are actually

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:54.350
the training areas.”

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:58.890
Military training areas throughout Europe
and North America are among the richest and

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:04.510
most important sites for biodiversity, often
because they are fenced and not open to the

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:06.440
general public.

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:12.060
But also because environmental awareness and
wise tactical use of natural resources is

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.060
encouraged among soldiers.

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:18.590
“One of those products that every soldier
training at Grafenwoehr Training Area receives

00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:21.620
is what we call our soldiers field card.

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:28.070
And the soldier’s field card includes environmental
dos and don’ts, emergency contact information,

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:29.440
all kinds of maps.

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:34.670
So this is a handy reference for all soldiers
training here at Grafenwoehr.

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:40.290
And what we have seen with products like the
soldier field card and also the playing cards

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:46.390
as well, which include a lot of the environmental
do’s and don’ts messages, is that a small

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:51.420
investment in environmental training, means
a large savings down the road in potential

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:53.650
repair or other types of maintenance projects.”

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:56.880
“If there is anything like a leak, you have
to stop it, you have to contain, you have

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:00.920
to call range control and do anything you
possibly can.

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:06.530
When we refuel in the field, we have to make
sure that we do it on concrete pad and that

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:09.980
it is done by the support platoons that know
what they are doing and that have the proper

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:10.980
equipment.”

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:14.850
A well-maintained environment also adds to
training realism.

00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:20.010
Good environmental stewardship in fact supports
authentic training conditions.

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:30.220
“You know we have the ability to focus on
conservation, but that focus gives us a sustainable

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:31.220
training area.

00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:36.110
For example, we’re not driving around in
mud and in dust.

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:45.810
We actually have vegetation and the management
of forestry that gives us a better natural

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:49.780
conserved training area and a better place
for our soldiers to train.”

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:54.720
Although the general tendency is to prevent
disturbance when trying to preserve unique

00:05:54.720 --> 00:06:01.000
plant and animal species, disturbances such
as fires caused by bombing, are crucial for

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.240
ecosystems.

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:10.890
“Well, we have a kind of a decline of the
yellow bellied toad in training areas as well,

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:16.460
because we don’t have as much vehicle and
tank training on the open areas as in former

00:06:16.460 --> 00:06:17.820
times.

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:24.570
So, we need to think about what to do for
the yellow bellied toad.

00:06:24.570 --> 00:06:31.301
Maybe we can have an ecological tank or something
like that, creating puddles like this or maybe

00:06:31.301 --> 00:06:38.520
also we can convince the military trainers
to go more into the open areas again.”

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:45.560
Military training areas are increasingly recognized
as sites of high biodiversity and large numbers

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:48.580
of threatened and endangered species.

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:53.370
In the case of the Grafenwoehr Training Area,
it is even considered to be one of the possible

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:55.419
spots for the return of the wolf.

00:06:55.419 --> 00:06:58.510
