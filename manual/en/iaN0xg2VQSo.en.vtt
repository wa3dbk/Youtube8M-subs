00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.900
[INTRO MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:04.315
Let's not beat around the bush.

00:00:04.315 --> 00:00:05.690
You know you've
thought about it,

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:07.350
and today we're
going to answer it.

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:09.776
Could you fart your
way through space?

00:00:09.776 --> 00:00:12.572
[THEME MUSIC  PLAYING]

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:17.164
If space suits didn't
put a firm barrier

00:00:17.164 --> 00:00:18.830
between you and the
outside environment,

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:20.026
space would kill you.

00:00:20.026 --> 00:00:21.400
But for the sake
of this episode,

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:22.850
let's take some
biological license

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:24.870
and pretend you could
survive without a suit,

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:26.730
or if you prefer,
pretend you have

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.310
a suit with a special valve
that would allow you to pass gas

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:30.460
into the vacuum of space.

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:32.759
Could you then propel
yourself with farts?

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.370
And if you could, how fast
could they make you go?

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.901
Before we can analyze the
concept of a fart rocket,

00:00:37.901 --> 00:00:39.900
we need to understand the
mechanics of those two

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.652
ingredients separately,
farts and rockets.

00:00:42.652 --> 00:00:44.110
Let's start with
rockets, actually,

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:45.310
because there's a
common misconception

00:00:45.310 --> 00:00:46.750
I want to clear
up from the start.

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:49.700
Rockets do not have
to ignite or burn fuel

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:51.320
in order to achieve propulsion.

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:52.920
An analogy will
help explain this.

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.250
Imagine standing on a
skateboard holding something

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:57.480
really heavy, like
a bowling ball.

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.227
In this picture, you represent
the rocket and the ball

00:01:00.227 --> 00:01:01.060
represents the fuel.

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:03.410
Now if you push the
ball forward hard,

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:05.414
the ball also pushes
backward on you,

00:01:05.414 --> 00:01:07.080
giving you and the
skateboard a backward

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.350
velocity in the process.

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:10.310
Fundamentally, that's
how a rocket works.

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:12.240
As it throws fuel
in one direction,

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.894
the fuel pushes
back on the rocket

00:01:13.894 --> 00:01:15.560
to accelerate in the
opposite direction.

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:17.730
But unlike me, a
rocket has no arms.

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:19.190
So how does it throw the fuel?

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:20.460
Well, in conventional
rockets, that's

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:21.626
where the ignition comes in.

00:01:21.626 --> 00:01:23.740
As the rocket's
propellant oxidizes,

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:25.362
chemical bond
energy is released,

00:01:25.362 --> 00:01:26.820
raising its
temperature and causing

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.800
it to expand until it becomes
a gas of particles bouncing off

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.300
the walls of the
combustion chamber.

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:33.630
Particles strike the
lateral sides equally often,

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.370
so there's no net push sideways.

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:37.380
But along the
longitudinal axis, there's

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.450
only one wall to strike,
and the particles

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:41.410
push the rocket forward
as they ricochet

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:42.960
and escape out the open end.

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.940
But if rockets did
have arms, they

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:47.640
could just as easily use
baseballs as propellant

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:48.740
without igniting anything.

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.170
If you attached seven million
clones of Madison Bumgarner

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:54.750
to a rocket and each clone
threw one 90 mile an hour

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.150
fastball out of the
rocket every second,

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:58.910
you would achieve
the same thrust

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:00.695
as the most powerful
rocket ever built,

00:02:00.695 --> 00:02:03.760
the SLS Booster that NASA
recently test fired in Utah.

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:06.324
So long as you throw enough
mass sufficiently fast,

00:02:06.324 --> 00:02:08.240
it doesn't really matter
what you're throwing.

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:11.146
So what's all this
have to do with farts?

00:02:11.146 --> 00:02:12.020
Well, think about it.

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:14.650
Flatulence is just
throwing gas, as opposed

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:17.190
to baseballs or rocket
fuel, out of your body.

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:19.180
Clearly, the resulting
thrust is tiny enough

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:20.889
not to move you
noticeably here on Earth.

00:02:20.889 --> 00:02:23.179
That's why you don't see
patrons at Taco Bell achieving

00:02:23.179 --> 00:02:23.680
lift off.

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.590
The same is true inside
the space station.

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:28.520
Famed Canadian astronaut Chris
Hadfield revealed on Reddit

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:31.180
that he had performed his
own poot-pulsion experiments

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.350
on the ISS with no
noticeable movement.

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:35.340
But in the near total
vacuum of space,

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.710
expelling gas would
have to make you move.

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:40.430
In fact, with just a single
day's worth of flatus,

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:42.710
you could travel the
entire Earth-Moon distance

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:46.250
in only 300,000 years.

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:48.200
And that's only if
there were no gravity.

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.390
In truth, even starting
out from low Earth order,

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:52.290
you'd be short of
Earth's escape velocity

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:54.070
by a factor of about a billion.

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:56.110
So you'd reverse course
almost immediately.

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:58.750
What's the root cause of
this fart rocket fail?

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:00.470
Conservation of momentum.

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:03.140
After a propulsion
event, the net momentum

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:05.720
of you and your fuel
must remain zero.

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:08.170
So your forward momentum
must be equal and opposite

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:10.560
to the backward momentum
of the gas you expel.

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:11.860
So how much momentum is that?

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:13.860
Let's start with the
exhaust velocity of a fart.

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:14.160
[FART NOISE]

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:15.697
I'm a scientist,
so I would prefer

00:03:15.697 --> 00:03:17.780
to measure this directly
using the wind speed fan.

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:19.630
But I couldn't
get one, so I used

00:03:19.630 --> 00:03:22.160
the 3 meters per second value
I kept seeing on the internet.

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:23.970
Estimating the mass
is more involved.

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:26.570
You can click over here to see
my method of weighing farts.

00:03:26.570 --> 00:03:29.510
My result was that even
over a full 24 hours,

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:32.860
an average person produces
around one measly gram

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:37.490
of flatus, and that recoil speed
ends up being a staggering 43

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:38.820
microns per second.

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:43.060
That's 15 centimeters an
hour, 3.7 meters per day,

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:47.030
26 meters in a week, or
1.3 kilometers per year.

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.930
Bottom line?

00:03:47.930 --> 00:03:49.580
Cutting the cheese
just won't cut it

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:51.080
for long distance space travel.

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:53.750
There's simply not
enough mass in your gas.

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:56.007
But maybe your space travel
goals are more modest.

00:03:56.007 --> 00:03:57.340
Let's take a different scenario.

00:03:57.340 --> 00:03:58.910
Suppose you were
stranded at rest

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:01.790
10 meters away from the
air lock door on the ISS.

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:03.610
Could you fart
your way to safety?

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:06.190
Sure, over a period of
about two and a half days,

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:08.940
or three and a half if you
actually took a full 24

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:12.140
hours to build up and
release that one gram of gas,

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:14.780
flatulating yourself to
top speed in small bursts.

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:17.380
And in case you're wondering,
sneezing would probably have

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:19.930
a similar result. The
masses and exit speeds

00:04:19.930 --> 00:04:21.920
of sneezes and farts
should be comparable.

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:24.900
I know the internet says sneezes
travel at 100 miles an hour,

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:26.940
but a study that we linked
to in the description

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:28.460
used high speed
photography to get

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:30.700
an answer closer to
4 meters per second,

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:33.030
right around my estimate
for the speed of a fart.

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:34.670
While we're comparing
bodily functions,

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:36.810
what about peeing
your way to safety?

00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:37.940
Let's do the math.

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:40.480
You can measure the exit
speed of a urine stream using

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:41.480
projectile kinematics.

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:42.920
See the link in the description.

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:45.720
Mine was in the same 3 to
4 meter per second range

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:46.780
we've seen all episode.

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:48.830
Now, since urine is mostly
water with the density

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:51.140
of 1 kilogram per
liter, the half liter

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:53.389
or so capacity of a full
bladder would have a mass

00:04:53.389 --> 00:04:54.430
of about half a kilogram.

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:57.300
That's 500 times more
than a day's worth of gas.

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:59.510
So the net result for
momentum conservation?

00:04:59.510 --> 00:05:03.360
About 500 to 700 times higher
recoil velocity, a little

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:05.750
over 77 meters per hour,
or enough to get you

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:08.370
back to the ISS in
under eight minutes.

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:09.850
So peeing looks
like the way to go.

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:12.020
To pick up comparable
speed from farting,

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:14.670
you would have to literally
break the sound barrier.

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:16.920
The required exit
velocity would exceed

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:20.540
Mach 4, over 3,000 miles
per hour, which is over

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:24.740
50% faster than the top
speed of the SR-71 Blackbird,

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:27.020
and I'm sorry, but no
amount of nozzle engineering

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:28.860
or blue flaming
shenanigans will ever

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:31.590
get you anywhere close
to that, so don't try it.

00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:32.880
Moral of the story?

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:35.620
If you stick to moving
sideways, can technically

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:39.117
fart your way through space, but
you're much better off peeing.

00:05:39.117 --> 00:05:41.450
Or if you're still holding
on to the seven layer burrito

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:43.380
you had planned to
use as raw material,

00:05:43.380 --> 00:05:44.850
just throw it instead.

00:05:44.850 --> 00:05:45.960
You'll get more recoil.

00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:47.880
I hope you found today's
analysis informative.

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:50.030
Your comments and questions
are welcome below.

00:05:50.030 --> 00:05:52.550
And if anyone is aware of
documentable measurements

00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:55.600
of flatological exhaust
speeds, include those too.

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:58.470
Let's just say, inquiring
minds want to know.

00:05:58.470 --> 00:06:00.450
As always, I'll
report any findings

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:02.270
on the next episode
of "Space Time."

00:06:02.270 --> 00:06:04.790
Last week I considered whether
the moon in Majora's Mask

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:06.050
might harbor a black hole.

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:07.220
You guys had a lot
to say, and we'll

00:06:07.220 --> 00:06:08.469
get your comments in a second.

00:06:08.469 --> 00:06:10.300
But first, an
encore announcement.

00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:12.310
This weekend, April
11 and 12, I'll

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:14.590
be hosting NASA's Space
Apps Challenge at the Main

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:15.690
Stage in New York City.

00:06:15.690 --> 00:06:18.100
You can attend in
person at various cities

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:19.990
across the world or
virtually online.

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:22.130
Check out
spaceappschallenge.org.

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:23.280
Now to your questions.

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:25.950
The Cosmos asked whether
gravitational forces

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:28.460
are about the mass or density
of the gravitational source.

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:30.540
Answer-- once you're
outside the gravitating

00:06:30.540 --> 00:06:32.070
object, what matters is mass.

00:06:32.070 --> 00:06:35.250
But how close another object
can get before it's ripped apart

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:37.250
by the tidal forces due
to a first object, which

00:06:37.250 --> 00:06:38.920
is due to gravitational
differentials,

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:41.560
that turns out to depend on the
density of that second object.

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:43.760
Look up Roche
limit on Wikipedia.

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:46.180
R MH, Noah Fence,
Fat Lum, Gareth Dean,

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:48.676
and Parrish Danforth all
asked in one way or another

00:06:48.676 --> 00:06:50.800
why the shell of the moon
wouldn't collapse and get

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:52.020
sucked into the black hole.

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:54.020
The short answer is that
black holes don't suck.

00:06:54.020 --> 00:06:56.314
In fact, far from their
horizon, which in this case

00:06:56.314 --> 00:06:58.230
would be just centimeters
since the horizon is

00:06:58.230 --> 00:07:00.021
sub-millimeter sized,
the fact that there's

00:07:00.021 --> 00:07:02.222
a black hole in play
becomes kind of irrelevant.

00:07:02.222 --> 00:07:03.930
If you have material
that's strong enough

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:06.080
to withstand internal
stresses, you

00:07:06.080 --> 00:07:07.710
could put a shell
that just sits there

00:07:07.710 --> 00:07:09.877
around pretty much anything,
including a black hole.

00:07:09.877 --> 00:07:12.168
Chronoflect asked whether
Termina's moon could actually

00:07:12.168 --> 00:07:14.090
rip apart in the three
day window of the game

00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:15.630
if it were the density
of Earth's moon.

00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:17.171
It turns out that
time to disassembly

00:07:17.171 --> 00:07:19.280
versus time to impact is
a pretty tricky issue.

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:20.950
A lot of factors come into play.

00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:22.450
I've seen this
modelled in the case

00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:24.899
of the Shoemaker-Levy comet
that hit Jupiter in 1994,

00:07:24.899 --> 00:07:27.190
but I don't recall whether
there's a definitive recipe.

00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:29.564
I think it depends a lot on
the details of the situation.

00:07:29.564 --> 00:07:31.049
Raphael Hviding
and Daniel Jenkins

00:07:31.049 --> 00:07:33.590
asked, wouldn't a black hole as
small as the one I'm claiming

00:07:33.590 --> 00:07:34.580
evaporate quickly?

00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:35.750
In relative terms, yes.

00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:38.290
But it would still take ten
thousand trillion trillion

00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:40.470
times the current age of
the universe to do so.

00:07:40.470 --> 00:07:42.720
Finally, Patrick Fadgen
asked, how can the moon be

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:44.470
seen all day long from Termina?

00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:46.530
You'd seem to need the
moon to orbit around

00:07:46.530 --> 00:07:48.190
the planet at the same
rate that the planet spins

00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:49.830
on its axis, which I
agree is not something

00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:51.720
that should happen if the
moon is also gradually getting

00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:52.220
closer.

00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:54.632
It's a major inaccuracy in
the game, and as I said,

00:07:54.632 --> 00:07:55.840
I don't have all the answers.

00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:57.150
Thanks for all the
great questions.

00:07:57.150 --> 00:07:58.983
Keep it up, and I'll
see you guys next time.

00:07:58.983 --> 00:08:01.870
