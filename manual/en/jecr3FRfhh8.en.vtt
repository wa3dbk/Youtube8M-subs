00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:01.260
Hello guys.

00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:08.700
Today I will give you a quick walkthrough
the menus of the ImmersionRC EzOSD.

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:09.890
this is the menu here.

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:11.750
there are two menu
screens.

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:14.340
Set home is for setting the launch point.

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:20.380
Call sign and other options - to show your
call sign on the video.

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:24.640
margins are options for the margins of the
sod.

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:33.010
There are four options: none, normal, safe
and HD margins for the OSD.

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:38.990
Max Distance and MAx Altitude options - you
can set the alarm for distance and altitude

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:45.920
or you can switch them off.

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:53.090
Next you set the pack capacity
capacity at which the OSD sounds an alarm.

00:00:53.090 --> 00:01:02.829
low battery alarm goes from six Volts to sixteen
volts or it can be automatic.

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:11.360
The topmost three options on the screen allow
you to change the units for speed distance

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:14.920
and altitude display.

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.990
on the next screen we have more options.

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:20.080
watts per kilometer

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:24.320
if you switch it on
you'll see additional display on

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:32.460
the main screen of the OSD that will show
your watts per hour spent per kilometer

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.640
uh... average and

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:36.640
current

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:42.030
and also the sod will display the number of

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.530
and also the sod will display the amounts
of kilometers you can travel

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.930
with current power spending

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:58.799
the uhf blank option selects which channel
will disable the OSD display in case you have

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:03.330
an ImmersionRC ezuhf

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:06.760
now let's look at the main display
overlay

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:11.280
starting from the top left you have
current speed, distance from ohm, a small

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:17.500
compass that shows the direction to the home
point, current altitude and an arrow that

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.400
shows whether
you're gaining altitude or losing altitude.

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:27.260
at the bottom row you have current voltage,
current amp draw and amount of milliamp hours

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:32.340
consumed from that moment the OSD was switched
on

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:34.520
now let's have a look at some and fight
inflight footage.

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:41.200
you can see my current amp draw, the amount
of battery milli amp hours consumed, my voltage

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:46.440
and the distance from the home point

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.000
now we have an alarm

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.150
because the voltage drops below 14.6 volts

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:56.700
please rate, comment and subscribe
and I will see you guys next time

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:57.700
