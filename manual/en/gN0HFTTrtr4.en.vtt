You know Pat's coming in Wednesday Night.

00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:04.150
Is she...Oh right. Is she gonna stay here?


00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:04.930
Yes, she is.

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:19.820
[rapid clicking sound]

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:21.810
This is how many animals are dying while you're
reading.

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:22.890
[rapid clicking sound]

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:32.259
Hey thanks for inviting me to movie
night. So what are we watching?

00:00:32.639 --> 00:00:36.529
Oh it's this great film called Earthlings.
You're gonna love it!

00:00:36.719 --> 00:00:38.149
You know meat contains poop.

00:00:38.279 --> 00:00:39.569
You know milk contains pus

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:43.759
You know apples can be coated with beeswax-

00:00:43.759 --> 00:00:47.419
You know…oh you’re not eating…I’ll
come back.

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.709
Can't believe I just woke up with this pimple!

00:00:49.819 --> 00:00:50.940
That's from eating meat!

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:52.009
[sniffs]

00:00:52.119 --> 00:00:53.079
That's from eating dairy!

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:57.500
That’s from eating eggs! [voice in the distance]

00:00:59.279 --> 00:00:59.980
[sneezes]

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:01.260
swine flu

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:01.900
[coughs]

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:02.580
bird flu

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.000
You know, this is from not getting enough
fiber!

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:06.560
[knock knock]

00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.560
Come back inside- I made you some nut cheese.

00:01:19.389 --> 00:01:23.880
Hi it’s Emily from Bite Size Vegan and I
hope you enjoyed this little vegan nugget

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:29.029
poking fun at the sometimes rather comical
intensity we vegans can have. Of course it’s

00:01:29.029 --> 00:01:33.729
usually coming from a genuine place, but we
all have to be able to laugh at ourselves sometime.

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:35.220
Oh, you can't?

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:39.890
Well then...[whispers], sorry about this video.

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:45.390
If you’re non-vegan and want a more grounded
discussion of why vegans are so passionate

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:51.609
at times, you can check out this video- also
linked up there and down there- don’t worry

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:56.249
it’s not graphic. And for my vegans out
there, if you want to find ways of talking

00:01:56.249 --> 00:02:02.979
about veganism that may be more effective
than the ones we just saw, (which doesn't take much), do subscribe and

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:07.929
check out some of my videos on this topic,
as well as stay tuned for more content addressing

00:02:07.929 --> 00:02:10.490
communication between vegans and non-vegans.

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:13.670
And eventually, an entire e-course on the subject!

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:18.400
If this gave you a giggle, do give it a thumbs
up and please share it around to spread the laughter.

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.780
If you want to keep your own laughter
going, check out my video “shit people say

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:28.510
to vegans” or my vegan superhero “the
veganizer” where I run about punching meat-eaters

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:34.970
in the face and generally being a bit of a
douche, or watch my far more serious explanation

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:40.540
of why we vegans can seem so intense in my
“what vegans see” video. If you want to

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:46.869
help support Bite Size Vegan in my ongoing
efforts to provide quality, free, approachable, vegan education,

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:02.200
Now go live vegan, take the time to laugh at yourself, and I’ll see you soon.

00:03:05.759 --> 00:03:06.549
Okay, it's pus.

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:07.400
Pus.

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.740
Pus.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:14.000
