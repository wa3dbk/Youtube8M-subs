00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:10.730
Lameness is a very broad term and it's just like
colic

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:12.019
as a very broad term

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:15.660
It just defines abdominal pain and then the causes
or myriad

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.279
of reasons and lameness the same thing.
Horses can exhibit the lameness

00:00:19.279 --> 00:00:22.980
as a deficit in their gate but it could
be the result of

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.590
any number of conditions ranging from
laminitis or

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:30.759
arthritis or tendinitis and sometimes
neurological conditions that have

00:00:30.759 --> 00:00:31.939
nothing to do with the

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:35.329
actual musculoskeletal system can cause
lameness so

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:38.809
so it definitely is a broad term.
Probably the most common cause of

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:39.469
lameness

00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:43.629
is arthritis obviously lameness can be a
result of an injury

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:47.579
so we can have an acute lameness that
results from direct trauma to

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:52.710
any area of the leg but probably the
more common type of lameness that we see

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.420
in the performance horse would be

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.930
a result of wear and tear that that
ensues after the horses

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:03.130
activities have taken the toll on a
variety of tissues whether they be soft

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:05.640
tissues or hard tissues or tendons or
bones

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:09.369
but the joints seem to be the ones that
pay the price the most for the wear and

00:01:09.369 --> 00:01:10.360
tear process.

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:14.259
as a result probably the most common
reason for us to ever evaluate horses for

00:01:14.259 --> 00:01:15.860
lameness is because they have arthritis

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:19.549
So when we start our exam we

00:01:19.549 --> 00:01:22.880
we start by palpating the soft
tissues

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:27.909
of the leg. We primarily palpate

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:32.399
the ligaments that are present in a
cannon bone region of the horse

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:35.420
Just very standard palpation.

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:41.479
We compare always to the other side

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:45.119
since the horses aren't likely to tell us
where things hurt

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:51.399
we kinda need to do different ways.
Arthritis can develop in horses

00:01:51.399 --> 00:01:55.419
at a relatively young age so even in the
midst of their career where you would

00:01:55.419 --> 00:01:57.909
expect them to still be able to perform
just fine

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:02.310
the jobs that we ask courses to do can
oftentimes be extremely taxing on some

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:02.899
joints

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:06.270
and those joints eventually end up deteriorating enough

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:09.739
to to have arthritis happen and then
lameness as a result.

00:02:09.739 --> 00:02:13.230
There's a lot of factors that can
contribute to the onset of lameness

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:16.300
probably the most important one would be
conformational

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:19.360
defects that the horse my have so it's
important that owners

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.090
know how to recognize common
conformational defects such as

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:27.530
a toed-in or a toed-out confirmation or in
the rear limb and upright limb versus a

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:28.750
slope behind then

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.460
so having the veterinarian advise them at the
time of the purchase

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:35.890
with regards to those things is really
important. Other things clearly

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:40.140
a that might play a role is the horse
being overweight.

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.710
Obesity is a cause of lameness in
people and small animals and the same

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:44.570
thing in the horse

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:49.250
um but at the end of the day that the
main reason why horses become lame is

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:49.700
because

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:54.100
of the way we use them. A 
lot of horses are high-end athletes and

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:57.970
they're prone to injuries and just like
in the human field if you're a high-end

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:01.380
athlete, you are more prone to developing
the wear and tear associated with your activity.

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:04.790
Let's go through back palpation.

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:08.200
Back soreness is fairly common
in

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:12.740
competitive horses and then palpation
of the rear limbs

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:19.160
follows.

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:25.210
This is the stifle region of the horse and 
stifles are often a source of lameness

00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:26.980
in horses so we need to make sure that

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:32.190
we've palpated  both sides to ensure
that there's not any joint swelling or

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:37.070
any pain on palpation. Then we'll

00:03:37.070 --> 00:03:44.070
pick up the rear limbs to palpate the
soft tissues and nose.

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:51.959
Owners may not be able to recognize a
subtle lameness but

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:55.340
things that they might want to look for
is that if the horses been used in a

00:03:55.340 --> 00:03:56.209
certain way

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:59.400
for a period of time and then all of a
sudden changes occur

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:02.760
in the way that the horse is able to
perform and that might be shown as

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:05.700
reluctancy to go on the trail ride or
reluctancy to

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:10.069
go over the fence or to maintain the
frame during dressage or depending on

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:11.140
the activity of the horse,

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:14.159
the horse may just demonstrate an
unwillingness to do its job

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:17.850
essentially and and that might be totally
incidental

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:21.019
or it might be worth a phone call to the
veterinarian to see if there's something else

00:04:21.019 --> 00:04:21.590
going on.

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:25.520
Horses usually don't lie and so a keen
owner should

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:29.289
obviously know their animal and should
recruit the help of the veterinarian as soon as

00:04:29.289 --> 00:04:30.570
possible to see if that

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:35.200
change in behavior is related to a lameness issue. 
Next thing is to

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:39.690
put hoof testers on the horse. The horses' lamenesses are

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:43.740
seventy percent of the times originate
from originate from their hoof

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:47.300
so it's important to test that their
hoofs for

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:52.740
any lameness issues since its kinda hard
to squeeze the hoof with your fingers

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:54.289
you kinda have to use an instrument

00:04:54.289 --> 00:04:57.400
and the instrument is called the hoof
tester

00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:02.720
so we just kind of work our way around
the hoof

00:05:02.720 --> 00:05:05.849
while squeezing to make sure that

00:05:05.849 --> 00:05:09.830
he doesn't have a painful response. This
horse is not

00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:16.830
reacting in any way to it.

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:22.090
So one of the things that might have
come out from watching the lameness exam

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:22.730
is that

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:26.150
lameness exams take time. They take a long time

00:05:26.150 --> 00:05:30.350
as a matter of fact in order to dissect
the lameness down to where it originates

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:30.830
from

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:34.140
one has to take the time to use
different surfaces to

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:37.810
to move horses around because different
terrains will elicit different problems

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:42.380
the grass will be more taxing on certain
things like soft tissues

00:05:42.380 --> 00:05:45.740
versus the concrete might be more taxing
on the hoof

00:05:45.740 --> 00:05:48.840
and so we tend to use as many tools as
we can to

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:52.330
get to the root cause of the lameness.
That's the hardest part of  lameness workup

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:52.810
is that

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:56.140
the horse shows the lameness on a limb but
you have no idea

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:59.820
where the origin of that lameness is. It might be
coming from the back it might be coming

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:02.230
from the hip region and it might be coming
from the

00:06:02.230 --> 00:06:05.860
cervical spine it could it could be any
number of places

00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:09.360
and it's not uncommon at all that we
would have clients come to the

00:06:09.360 --> 00:06:10.400
university and

00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:13.460
ride their horses and that's the whole
reason why we have this

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:17.980
lameness area because they will get on
the horses back and demonstrate

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:21.870
demonstrate what they actually see when
the horse or feel when the horse is lame

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:25.070
and that's really vital information. One
of the most rewarding

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:29.310
ways to to identify the source of lameness is to have

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:33.170
a educated rider on the horse that
tells you this is what I feel and then

00:06:33.170 --> 00:06:35.470
you can see it from the ground then you
can match

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:38.590
the interpretation of the trainer or the
rider with what you're actually seeing

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:39.260
and then

00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:40.670
things make a lot more sense.
