00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:04.260
So you wanna make a fire?

00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:12.059
I'll show you how.

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:22.320
Hey, who doesn't love a warm fire on a cold
night?

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.250
But, you know, if you're going to have a fire
in a firebox, there are a few things you need

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:28.559
to know to build it properly.

00:00:28.559 --> 00:00:30.490
So let's just go through a few of those.

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:34.340
What I've got here are just some basic things
lined up that I wanna show you.

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:40.039
I built this fire, setting first some tinder,
which in this case I'm using newspaper.

00:00:40.039 --> 00:00:42.620
Then I used kindling on top of it.

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:46.440
Then I stacked some of this well-dried oak
on top of it here.

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.160
And, you can see, I have about four or five
logs.

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:57.280
And notice how I've placed the logs down where
a lot of this splintering is going to be facing

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:58.699
the fire as it comes up.

00:00:58.699 --> 00:01:00.860
This will help ignite the fire.

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:03.319
It's important that the damper is open.

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:08.220
Don't try to build a fire unless you know
the damper is open because what will happen

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:10.890
is you will fill the entire house with smoke.

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.430
You don't want that, okay?

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:17.640
If you have glass doors on your firebox, make
sure you open those for at least 30 minutes

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.450
because what you want is you want the warm
air of the room to kinda go up through the

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:27.080
chimney and warm the inside of the chimney
in the shaft, you see.

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:31.670
Because warm air is going to pull through
and help draw.

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:35.100
Drawing the air up through here is really
important to keeping the smoke out the room.

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.009
Okay, now I'm gonna light it, and you can
use these long matches, and you light the

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:41.920
tinder down here first.

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:46.829
The idea is that the tinder then lights the
kindling, the kindling then lights the logs

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:48.200
or the fuel.

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:54.460
Now, you can have a gas starter, which I have
here, which is cheating just a little bit.

00:01:54.460 --> 00:02:00.700
I'm gonna reach over here and turn this on
just a bit so you can see what happens.

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:05.310
What's good about gas, I think, is that you
can preheat that whole shaft so you make sure

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:07.090
you get plenty of draw.

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:13.510
If you don't have that, you can buy some of
these logs that are fake logs that are fire

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:17.890
starters, and you can put one of those in
your firebox and help warm it up first before

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:19.550
you start laying in all the logs.

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:26.140
Now, if you find that you're not drawing enough
air up through the chimney, just go across

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:31.250
the room and if you can crack a window just
a little bit, it'll help pull the air through

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:32.710
and go right up the chimney.

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:35.590
So, as you can see, it's really moving along
nicely.

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:38.100
One last tip: Don't use a lot of newspaper.

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.690
Newspaper when it burns is really smokey.

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:45.280
So if you just add a lot of paper like that,
it's just gonna fill the room with smoke.

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.870
