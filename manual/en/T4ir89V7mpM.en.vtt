00:00:02.379 --> 00:00:09.420
In burlesque, we use lots of props.

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:14.599
I'm going to show you how you can incorporate
all your props in one routine.

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:17.830
I have my feather fan, my boa.

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:22.390
I have a chair that I'm on, and my hat.

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:28.269
In this routine, we're going to use each prop
and my gloves, and I'm going to show you how

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:35.420
you do it slow, sexy, and seductive, and teasing
the audience.

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:41.220
First, we're going to use the fan, nice and
slow.

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:47.400
From here, you might just take you leg off
the chair, slowly and sexy.

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:51.600
Then slowly you could put down your fan on
the chair.

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.990
From here, work your boa.

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:57.990
Tease the audience.

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:08.049
Slow, sexy, whip it down, bring it up and
place it on the chair.

00:01:08.049 --> 00:01:13.570
From here you could slowly take off your gloves
one by one.

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:17.649
You could either use your fingers to pull
it off, or you could use your teeth.

00:01:17.649 --> 00:01:23.670
I'm choosing to pull it off with my hands.

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:24.670
Slow, reach, whip it down.

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:26.650
Nice and slow.

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:32.249
As you take your glove off, tease, whip.

00:01:32.249 --> 00:01:33.829
Last is your hat.

00:01:33.829 --> 00:01:35.520
Now you want to play a little bit.

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.950
So, you kind of give a twirl, nice and sexy.

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:48.899
Caress your body, take the hat, come around
with it, maybe put it back on.

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:50.779
Have fun with it.

00:01:50.779 --> 00:01:54.490
Take it and throw it at the audience.

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:57.280
That is how we use our props in burlesque.
