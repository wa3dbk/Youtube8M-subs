00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:28.600

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:32.400
Ask him if he smells that.

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:34.460
Woah hold on..

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:36.260
Do you smell that?

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:37.340
Ask him "Are you cooking something?"

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:38.280
Are you cooking something?

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:39.260

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:40.400
Ask him what he's cooking.

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:41.180

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.140
*laughter*

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:47.300
Your asscheek hurts so bad.

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:50.220

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:54.040
Uh...so...how's the movie? How was it shooting and that?

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:58.740
Why is your face like that? Why are you making that face like you're doing something? What are you doing?

00:00:58.800 --> 00:00:59.300
Sorry.

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:01.600
You think a bug crawled in to your ass crack.

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:07.200

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:12.000
Is that always what you're cooking? Since the Rock has been cooking thing.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:12.500
Yes

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:16.080
Has it always been horsesh*t or do you alternate judging by season

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:22.060
Well uh *stutters*. It's horsesh*t, it's llama sh*t, sometimes it's gorilla sh*t. But either way

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:22.720
Is it always sh*t?

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:24.980

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.080

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:43.520
Start rolling your stomach.

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:45.560

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:46.540

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:52.880
No. You look like you're in your second trimester.

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.560

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:58.140
Oh good I love presents.

00:01:58.360 --> 00:01:58.860
It's a water gun.

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:00.240
Ask him to squirt it in your mouth.

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:02.480
Could you please squirt this in to my mouth

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:05.800

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:10.140

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:34.580
Well, you know. It's been really great interviewing you and you know I was told I had to tip.

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:35.740
