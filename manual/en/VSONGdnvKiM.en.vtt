Hey guys, I'm Mark Healey, professional waterman
and GoPro athlete. Today I'm going to take

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.500
you through a new accessory by GoPro and also
give you some tips on how to get really insane

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.000
underwater shots.

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.550
Before I go diving I always like to prep my
cameras ahead of time, preferably the night

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:33.120
before. Really important- make sure the inside
of the port is clean. Get those moisture absorbing

00:00:33.129 --> 00:00:38.079
wafers in there, make sure they're not in
the hatch of the camera so it doesn't leak.

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:42.359
You want a really good seal when you're diving.
Also most of the time I go in the water I'm

00:00:42.359 --> 00:00:45.879
going to put one of these floaties on. So
you have a fighting chance of finding your

00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:48.000
camera should it get lost in the water.

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:57.800
New to the accessory line is the GoPro Dive
Filters. They come in two different colors

00:00:57.809 --> 00:01:03.390
to suit your needs. Both are rated for 15
to 70 feet. You can go deeper, it's definitely

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:09.710
not going to hurt. Both made of glass, amazing
optics. The difference is- this red filter,

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:14.810
you're going to use this is in more blue water.
I dive a ton in Hawaii, this is my go-to filter

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:19.140
and it's really going to make those colors
pop. The magenta filter on the other hand

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:23.640
is something that you're going to use in fresh
water, perhaps lakes or diving a kelp bed

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:29.900
in California. Just either fresh or kind of
green water. These are all tool-free. They

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:34.540
pop on and off that easy. You've got to make
sure you put a little tether on there so it

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:40.160
doesn't get accidentally knocked off in the
water. You can either go into the water with

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.390
it off and put it on just to make sure that
there's no air bubbles between the port and

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:49.140
the filter. Or if you have too much gear and
you're messing around you just want it on,

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.270
you can go down in the water, but pop it off
or either shake out the bubbles because there

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.000
is a little space and you want water in between
this port and this filter.

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:09.440
As opposed to surfing where I'm kind of thinking
of slowing it down in post, diving I'm just

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.260
looking for the best image quality I can get
while underwater, so I'm going to bump the

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:20.460
frame rate down. So 1440 by 30 is probably
the most all around dive friendly setting

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:25.520
that I know of. If you're not worried about
low light situations, it's just super bright

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:33.160
coral reef, Bora Bora, tons of light, clear
water, I go to 2.7K at 30 frames per second.

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.260
That gives you more of that really crisp cinematic
quality.

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:42.020
Alright guys, I'm GoPro Athlete Mark Healey
with your GoPro Athlete Tips and Tricks. Today

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:46.220
we went over the dive filters and also a couple
of modes that I like to use while diving.

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:49.280
Now get out there, get a mask on your head,
have fun.
