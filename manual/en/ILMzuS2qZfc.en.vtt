One Laptop per Child announced this week that
they will debut a prototype XO-3 computer

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:09.340
two years ahead of schedule. The tablet, of
which you’re seeing a rendering of here,

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:14.630
will eventually cost 75 US dollars according
to OLPC’s founder and chairman Nicholas

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:15.630
Negroponte.

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:23.160
At CES 2011 we will show a tablet that can
be and will probably be used for children

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:32.270
in the developed world that will allow us
to start testing that combine if you will

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:41.070
a laptop and iPad and Kindle and sort of take
those and put them into one device. The 75

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:48.350
dollar mark, we’re going to hit it that’s
not a problem. What is a problem is at the

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:55.990
moment when will we get plastic? Because we
really want this to be 100% plastic, unbreakable

00:00:55.990 --> 00:01:07.100
and almost extruded from a machine. CES 2012
we’ll probably see that. CES 2011 it’ll

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:08.500
be glass.

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:13.930
He said that the XO-3 will run an Arm processor
and that the screen would be 9 or more inches.

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:17.860
The first prototypes would most likely run
Google’s Android operating system, but he

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:20.491
said it’s ultimately an open source Linux
laptop.

00:01:20.491 --> 00:01:27.180
And more important than anything else, and
that’s why I say god willing, you’ll see

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:34.410
a dual mode display. One that works both in
the sunlight and is backlit. To me that’s

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:39.950
one of the biggest features we need for our
kids. Our kids are outdoors a lot and just

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:47.560
having it backlit doesn’t quite work outdoors
and just having it reflective doesn’t quite

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:53.369
work.

00:01:53.369 --> 00:01:57.260
OLPC has had a tough road with hitting promised
price points so we can only wait and see if

00:01:57.260 --> 00:02:01.640
the group’s latest offering comes in on
budget. Reporting from the MIT Media Lab in
