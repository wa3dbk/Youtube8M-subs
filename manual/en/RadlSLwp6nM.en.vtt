00:00:01.750 --> 00:00:06.950
Hi! I’m Adria one of the professional jugglers
here at expertvillage.com. Right now we’re

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:12.639
going to learn what are called one up, two
up combos, one up, two up combinations, one

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:17.890
up, two up patterns: the name pretty much
describes what it does cause jugglers don’t

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:22.140
have much of an imagination. We’re going
to throw one ball up in the air, followed

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:27.820
by two balls up in the air. The basic pattern
for the one up, two up pattern is to keep

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:33.780
the outside balls parallel, and always in
the same hand, but the inside ball travels

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:41.300
from hand to hand: that way each hand gets
an equal amount of work. As you can see…the

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:48.059
outside balls stay in the same hands, the
inside ball gets shuffled from hand to hand,

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:56.070
this is the initial basis of the one up, two
up patterns. This is called cheating: two

00:00:56.070 --> 00:01:00.770
balls are in the right hand, the left hand
is just paralleling the outside ball with

00:01:00.770 --> 00:01:05.430
the right hand, and the right hand is doing
twice as much work by handling the inside

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:13.670
ball itself; this is the basis of that, two
balls in one hand, going up and down parallel.

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:18.860
This is the same pattern, cheating; we call
it cheating cause the ball never leaves the

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:25.290
left hand. Now anything that one can do with
the right hand in juggling can be done with

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:36.880
the left hand as well. The same two ball pattern…two
up, one up the left hand doing all the work,

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:45.880
and again we have the cheating…the right
hand parallels the outside ball with the left

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.690
hand, and the inside ball is just on with
the left hand.
