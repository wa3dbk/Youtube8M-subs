00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:01.229
Hey everybody.

00:00:01.229 --> 00:00:02.229
Welcome to Hilah Cooking.

00:00:02.229 --> 00:00:03.229
I'm Hilah.

00:00:03.229 --> 00:00:06.470
Today, I'm going to
show you how to make super-shortcut-easy vegetarian

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:07.470
lasagna.

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.730
I have this
new lasagna pan.

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:10.730
Look at it, it's shiny.

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:14.019
It's never been used, that my
friend Joe sent me from Germany.

00:00:14.019 --> 00:00:15.019
Thanks, Joe.

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:20.010
I came up with this recipe
when I was in high school, when I was a 'vegetarian'.

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:25.589
I was a vegetarian
for 7 years, but I put it in quotes because

00:00:25.589 --> 00:00:26.589
I'm an idiot.

00:00:26.589 --> 00:00:27.589
Anyway, it's
really easy.

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:35.110
I'm not going to boil the noodles first; super-shortcut,
awesome, fast, bad-ass lasagna coming at you.

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:48.530
The things that we need for to make this lasagna
are a cheese mixture,

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:53.129
which is some grated mozzarella, some grated
parmesan, some ricotta cheese,

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.800
and some chopped zucchini which would be in
a layer.

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.579
This is marinara
sauce.

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:02.579
Super-basic, no meat; it's just tomatoes,
garlic, oil, and spices.

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.200
I'll put the recipe for that on the website.

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.130
Super-simple, you don't really
need me to demonstrate it; otherwise, you

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.250
can just buy a jar 28-ounce jar
of sauce.

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.720
Some noodles, just regular noodles.

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:16.780
You don't have to buy the
ones that are expensive that say no-boil,

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.860
because basically you add enough
water to the sauce, they're all no-boil-necessary.

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:25.100
I'm going to start with the cheese mixture.

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.931
Just mixing some stuff
together, and I'm going to add an egg to the

00:01:27.931 --> 00:01:30.420
cheese mixture, too.

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.171
Plop this
in there.

00:01:33.171 --> 00:01:38.720
You do want to make sure you get some full-fat
cheese going on in

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:39.720
here.

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:42.150
You can totally use low-fat or even fat-free
ricotta.

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:47.740
I've done it,
but it is a little more special if you can

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:53.170
afford it; the calories, not the
price because they cost the same.

00:01:53.170 --> 00:02:01.780
About half this; we'll save that for
topping, and then my egg, and some oregano.

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:06.390
I'm just going to pull the
leaves off.

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.780
If you don't have this, you can use some parsley,
some fresh

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:16.450
basil, some dried oregano, or whatevs, or
just leave it out; it won't hurt

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:17.450
my feelings.

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:19.959
Then we just mix this together real good.

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:25.560
The egg is just there; it acts as a binder
so that your lasagna stays

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.709
together when you cut it.

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:31.739
If you are a vegetarian that doesn't do eggs,
you

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:36.209
could probably just sprinkle in a teaspoon
of flour in with this, and that

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:39.920
would help to bind it all together.

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.650
Handy tip from me to you.

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:44.749
That's all
mixed up.

00:02:44.749 --> 00:02:47.350
Now I'm going to have some whiskey.

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:49.280
Cheers, everybody.

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.550
I've got
my approximately 28 ounces of sauce; I'm going

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:58.540
to add about another 1-1/3
cup of just water to that sauce.

00:02:58.540 --> 00:03:02.930
Now I'm going to start layering this
business together.

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:07.099
It's going to be so awesome.

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:08.099
It's going to blow your
mind.

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:15.040
I'm just going to pour a little bit of my
extra-watery sauce in the bottom

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:19.650
and then . . . look; my oven's all heated
up.

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:22.670
Oh snap.

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:27.209
Then, let's see.

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:34.150
[inaudible: 03:30] lasagna sheets, and these
will expand and fill it up.

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:35.909
I
know I'm probably going to get a lot of shit

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:40.340
from people that are like,
"You have to boil the lasagna noodles because

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:41.719
it tastes awful."

00:03:41.719 --> 00:03:42.719
It doesn't.

00:03:42.719 --> 00:03:44.360
It's not very authentic I guess.

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:49.239
To me, we're running out of fucking fresh
water, dude, so if I can save a bunch of water

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:53.930
by not boiling a huge pot of
noodles and do this shortcut, then I'm actually

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:55.760
helping the planet.

00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:00.639
I
should probably get an award.

00:04:00.639 --> 00:04:03.480
Then spread this around.

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:11.069
There's not really a
neat and tidy way to do this, but we'll just

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:14.230
see what we can do.

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:27.620
I also
think I'm going to shove a little one in there

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:43.560
too, just to fill it up a
little bit more.

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:53.610
A little bit of sauce, a little bit of cheese,
and some of

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:54.610
my zucchini.

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:57.530
Now I'm just going to cover it with foil and
stick it in the

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:58.530
oven.

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:02.600
Then in about 1 hour, we're going to have
some wicked awesome

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:06.390
vegetarian lasagna.

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:09.090
It's been actually about 50 minutes.

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:16.740
I'm going to take the foil off and
then put it back in.

00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:21.190
You can see the noodles are totally absorbing
all the

00:05:21.190 --> 00:05:22.190
liquid.

00:05:22.190 --> 00:05:24.510
Another 15 minutes just to get the top browned
up, some of that

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:31.640
liquid cooked off, and then we'll have lasagna,
bitches.

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:35.720
Look at that
lovely, delicious vegetarian lasagna.

00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:38.830
Holy crap that looks good.

00:05:38.830 --> 00:05:40.470
Holy cow.

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:47.880
Wait, we should probably let it rest before
I cut right into it, so cut.

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:54.230
This has been resting for 10 or 15 minutes;
I forget.

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:55.230
I'm drunk.

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:59.770
We can
just use this to cut into it.

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:06.520
It's cool; I don't know if you noticed, when
they went in, they were only this big, but

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:14.390
now they've expanded to this
big, so awesome; totally worked.

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:24.930
Probably need to cut it more.

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:31.020
It probably
could've rested a little bit longer but I

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:32.370
am impatient.

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:36.880
If you've ever
watched the show, I'm totally impatient.

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:42.630
Let's taste this mother.

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:48.230
Dude,
that's delicious.

00:06:48.230 --> 00:06:50.780
That is a delicious lasagna that you can make
on a cold

00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:54.160
and rainy day, and warm the hearts of your
loved ones.

00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:59.730
Much like Joe warmed
my heart when he sent me this pan as a Christmas

00:06:59.730 --> 00:07:01.770
present.

00:07:01.770 --> 00:07:05.460
Super-easy awesome vegetarian lasagna; try
it out for yourself.

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:08.990
Go to the
website and I'll post the recipe: HilahCooking.com.

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:12.130
You can leave some
comments and you can even send me a picture

00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:13.310
if you make it.

00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:14.310
That'd be
awesome.

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:15.310
Thanks everybody.

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:16.310
Thanks for watching.

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:19.630
Thanks especially to Joe
for the awesome lasagna pan.

00:07:19.630 --> 00:07:20.420
Peace.
