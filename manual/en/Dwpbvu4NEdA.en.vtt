00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:12.060
Uh, the price of petrol is--

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:15.200
uh, very high!

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:23.760
and, uhm, in Finland it's even higher, than here. It's terrible. In Finland-- In Finland, smokers

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.600
get more annoyed when you ask them for a light, than for a cigarette.

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:41.020
But I noticed that, in America, did you know, that in America, that fresh petrol is just, like, 50 cents a litre.

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:46.240
So, it's really cheap, and I-- I'm starting to get really bitter that Finland did not attack Iraq.

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:53.720
I'd like some petrol.

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.440
If the USA is pulling out, I'm going in.

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:06.940
I'm gonna go by myself.

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:10.800
with a rifle and a bucket!

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:27.620
But I-- I got this American friend, and we always argue, like, uh, like-- like, about the Iraq thing,

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:33.780
and he always says, "No, no, the USA did not attack Iraq for the oil, because USA has it's own oil wells."

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:40.580
Well that's a really solid argument. Like, "No, no, Johnny did not rob the bank, he had a fiver."

00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:00.920
"No, no, Ismo does not want to get laid today. He has had sex, once."

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.360
It's a solid argument.

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:12.620
Uh, se-- sex is nice.

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:20.500
I-- I've been to Ireland, like, three times before, and it-- it's not been easy.. to.. get laid.

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:22.560
[Audience member:] Aww

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:23.380
Aw, yeah.

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:28.220
I think it-- I think it's a while. I think the last time I had sex, in Ireland,

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:30.780
I-- I-- I think I still payed for it, in pounds.
