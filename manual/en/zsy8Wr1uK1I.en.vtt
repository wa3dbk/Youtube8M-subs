Pull up the trigger completely to clean with a cloth the black straight tubings.

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:40.240
Insert the cam head and the springs into warm soapy water moving the trigger repeatedly.

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:50.320
Dry it completely. Compressed air can help to remove dirt from the cam head and the springs.

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:58.480
Straighten the cables to keep them perpendicular to the guide (guide: is the black part where all cables pass through)

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:15.040
Pull down the springs one by one to release them free from torsion force.

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:25.940
Lube the axle and the springs with a watery wax lube.

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:30.220
Avoid WD40 or similar because they can create a thick layer of dirty very difficult to remove.

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:52.380
Lastly, remove excess lube.
