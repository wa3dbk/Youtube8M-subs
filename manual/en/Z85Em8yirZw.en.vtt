00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
I think that Illinois apart from a lot of other schools 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:16.000
of it's size really focuses on the community.

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:20.000
I love that there are so many different types of people here.

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:23.000
You get international students, people from other states, 

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:27.000
people just from small towns in Illinois, to the big city of Chicago.

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:31.000
It's a 40,000 person family.

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:34.000
Personality wise and major wise we have so many different 

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:37.000
majors that people excel in.

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:40.000
You come here and you really get the sense of belonging here.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Students should apply to Illinois because first of all,

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:51.000
it's a very prestigious school there's obviously a lot of 

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:52.300
really great programs here.

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:56.000
If you have a major or interest, like even if you're not sure, 

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:59.000
Illinois has something related to it,

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:01.000
so it's a place where everyone can fit in.

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:04.300
But secondly, once you get here the atmosphere is very relaxed.

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:10.000
It's a lot of diversity, it has anything that anyone could want.

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:12.000
There's a lot of school spirit people here work hard,

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.300
but they also play hard you know and have some fun, 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:18.000
get out and take advantage of the activities that are offered here.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
The best location here at Illinois is probably the football stadium.

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.000
My favorite place on campus is probably the 

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:31.000
Krannert Center for the Performing Arts.

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:33.000
And it's just really a great atmosphere.

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.000
I go there a lot, there are a lot of great performances, 

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:40.000
from dances to operas to musicals.

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:43.000
And being in the student section with everyone wearing orange, 

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:48.000
usually no matter how the team is doing, usually gets you feelingâ€¦

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.150
pumped.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
I really like school and school is really important to me,

00:02:01.150 --> 00:02:03.000
and academic rigor is super important to me. 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:06.000
But I also really like football games and basketball games, 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:08.000
and goofing around with my friends.

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:10.000
At Illinois you get the best of both worlds.

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:13.000
You get athletics and you get academics.

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.000
And Illinois and Illinois students are all of those things.

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.000
We're a really well rounded group.

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.000
So for me it was just a perfect fit.
