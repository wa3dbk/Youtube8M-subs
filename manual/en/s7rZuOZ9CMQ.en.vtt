00:00:01.568 --> 00:00:03.628
Hi, I'm Koji Tamaki

00:00:04.604 --> 00:00:05.924
I heard a good story

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:17.980
There was a boy from Indiana
who loved to play lacrosse.

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:20.086
He thought, "I'll never make
the national team,

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:22.889
"but I could probably play
for somewhere like Japan"

00:00:22.922 --> 00:00:24.562
So that rotten kid

00:00:24.957 --> 00:00:26.992
took his lacrosse stick

00:00:27.026 --> 00:00:28.561
and his little kitty

00:00:28.594 --> 00:00:30.294
and he came to Japan.

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:31.620
 Mr. Mediocre

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.900
Suprisingly enough, he put his
heart and soul into lacrosse,

00:00:34.934 --> 00:00:37.503
and he grew up to become
quite a nice guy.

00:00:37.537 --> 00:00:38.104
 Mr. Mediocre

00:00:38.137 --> 00:00:39.639
Then one day...

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.060
They did select him for
the Japanese team.

00:00:42.642 --> 00:00:43.142
 Mr. Mediocre

00:00:43.443 --> 00:00:44.923
20 years later

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:49.160
He played in his final World Cup
before retirement

00:00:49.616 --> 00:00:50.216
 Mr. Mediocre

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:51.380
They finished 9th 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:51.880
 

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:52.618
 Mr. Mediocre

00:00:52.651 --> 00:00:55.931
In Japan, the headlines were
"Funasshi Gets Sore Back"

00:00:56.656 --> 00:00:57.356
 Mr. Mediocre

00:00:57.389 --> 00:00:59.669
What had he done
with his life?

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:01.300
Mr. Mediocre!

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.640
3 days after his cat started
to call him "Mr. Mediocre"...

00:01:12.871 --> 00:01:14.631
 "Japanese Toilets Inc."

00:01:15.441 --> 00:01:20.480
Give me an American-size
version of that Japanese toilet!

00:01:31.657 --> 00:01:35.277
Come in with me, please!

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.060
DOGEZA!!!
