00:00:00.516 --> 00:00:01.400
Hi, I'm Andrew Hackard.

00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:02.380
I'm a committed gamer.

00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:04.100
And I love introducing
other people to the

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:07.310
games that I love.

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:11.050
I worked with Steve Jackson
Games from 2000 to 2004, and

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:15.210
then took a sabbatical, and
came back in 2009 because

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.690
Munchkin had gotten so big,
Steve needed someone to take

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:19.320
over the management
of the line, so he

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:20.160
could write the games.

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.900
Steve Jackson Games is a game
publisher that's been around

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:24.260
since 1980.

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:26.240
They make a lot of games,
including Chez Geek, that we

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:29.780
just played, Munchkin, that's a
very popular game right now.

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:33.250
I talk to fans, but I also
track sales numbers, keep

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:36.020
track of where things are in
the printing process, make

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:38.840
sure we have all of the art,
make sure Steve is hitting his

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:40.260
deadlines to write
rules, which, of

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.450
course, he always does.

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:43.120
So it's really just the
day-to-day management.

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:44.260
It's kind of directing
the game.

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.610
The thing to know about being
inside the game industry is,

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.375
at the end of the day,
it's a fun job, but

00:00:49.375 --> 00:00:50.410
it is still a job.

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:54.160
And we still have to deal with
all of the same troubles, and

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.550
missed deadlines, and slow
boats from China that

00:00:57.550 --> 00:00:59.760
everybody else has to deal
with in publishing and in

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:00.720
business in general.

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:03.750
But we do love what we do, and
we really appreciate it when

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.680
the people who buy the games and
enjoy them come up to us

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.860
at shows and let us know that
they've really enjoyed it.

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:10.950
So yeah, at the end
of the day, it's a

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:11.900
job, but we're fans.

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:13.140
We enjoy what we do.

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.340
Oh, I'm a hardcore gamer.

00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:17.570
It's a very rare week where
I'm not out with friends

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:19.020
playing games at least once.

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.070
Some of my favorite games are
Chez Geek, obviously,

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:24.480
Munchkin, obviously, a card game
that came out a couple

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:27.300
years ago, called Dominion,
that's one of the new

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:30.780
innovative designs, and a game
called Castle Panic put out by

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:32.530
my friends Justin and
AnnMarie Dewitt.

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:34.680
One of my favorite things about
gaming is that it's one

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.440
of our true social activities
that we have left.

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:40.210
There's so much disconnect,
where people are just talking

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:42.210
over a phone line or internet.

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.530
Gaming brings people into the
same space to enjoy each

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:46.760
other's company and
have a good time

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:47.790
for a couple of hours.

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.460
When I started gaming it was
with the original Dungeons and

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:52.690
Dragons set, back when
I was nine years old.

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:54.040
It was one of my babysitters
who brought it

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:55.090
over, and we played.

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:56.370
And I was hooked from then on.

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:59.820
In my life, gaming has meant
the foundation of a lot of

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.960
friendships dating all the way
back to when I was in middle

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:04.360
school, high school, college.

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.420
Some of my closest friends
today are the guys that I

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:10.000
gamed with in college over
a long weekends--

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.910
sometimes longer than they
should have been.

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:16.550
The characters in Chez Geek
are kind of stereotypes.

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:19.190
We all have a little bit of the
web designer in that our

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:20.330
work is never quite done.

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:22.430
We're always trying to
please other people.

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:23.760
There's a little corporate
drone in

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:25.400
everyone that's just--

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:26.260
I don't have any free time.

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.230
I'm just doing this
for the paycheck.

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:30.660
Probably the grossest character
in the game is the

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.100
choad warrior, who just shows
up in your room and eats all

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:36.463
your good stuff, takes all
your good stuff, and then

00:02:36.463 --> 00:02:38.820
leaves to harass someone
else-- if you're lucky.

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:42.180
The card that nobody likes to
see is the psycho ex because

00:02:42.180 --> 00:02:44.730
not only does she take up space
in your room, she drives

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.390
away all of your live-in SO's,
and all of your nookie.

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:49.770
I have some real-life choad
warrior friends, but that's

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:51.010
why I live alone now.

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:52.520
I really am living a dream job.

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:53.520
It is.

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:56.630
Every day I go to work, and my
job is to play games and to

00:02:56.630 --> 00:02:59.160
make games that other
people will enjoy.

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.830
I've also designed some games,
created some games.

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:04.550
Steve and I collaborated on a
game called Chez Greek, which

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:07.640
is a sequel to Chez Geek
set in a frat house.

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:09.350
Gaming is my life.
