00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:09.160
Hello friends!
In today's episode, we will look at a Garden Cart

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:13.100
 Its something that will make your gardening a lot more enjoyable

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.720
As its very easy to carry your stuff around the garden

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:17.100
using the Garden Cart

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:20.700
We will also compare it to a Wheelbarrow

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:23.280
And then you can decide what is best for you!

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:25.980
So the Garden Cart we will be taking a look

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.260
at today is a Garden Dump Cart by Gorilla
Carts

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.640
And its actually very decently priced

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:35.000
See the video description for more details

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:45.670
So lets start unboxing this Garden Cart

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.440
And it wasn't really that heavy as I thought

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.890
Its actually pretty light and easy to carry

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:56.080
And this has a plastic base

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:59.490
Its the lower end version of the Garden Cart

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.600
There is a higher end version that comes with

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:07.410
a much more sturdy base

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:10.220
But I guess for most practical purposes, the

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:16.180
plastic cart should be good enough
Its got some nice wheels - 4 of them

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:21.860
Its got clear instructions on the assembly

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.480
And all the parts are pretty well packaged

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:47.900
Compared to a wheelbarrow, 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.240
A Garden Cart has
4 wheels which makes it easy to maneuver the cart

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:56.640
And it also has a Dump feature which makes emptying very easy

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.180
So we have all the parts laid out

00:02:01.489 --> 00:02:03.729
And the cart is now ready for assembly

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.080
Now assembling the cart was moderately difficult

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:17.460
And most of the difficulty was because there
were a lot of bolts that needed to be tightened

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:22.530
And although I tightened most of these by
hand, I realized that if you had a power drill,

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:27.020
it would have been a lot easier to complete
the assembly

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:32.520
So you could use a power drill to tighten
the bolts while holding the hex nut from the

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:35.970
other side and that makes the assembly a lot
faster

00:02:39.780 --> 00:02:45.460
But as I said, it should take you probably
about an hour or so to assemble everything

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:49.510
if you have a power tool
If you are doing it by hand, it might take

00:02:49.510 --> 00:02:52.980
you a bit longer
because its a little exhausting to tighten

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:57.670
all those nuts
I think there are about 15 or 20 of them

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.160
So we have almost assembled out dump cart

00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:25.200
We now need to assemble the wheels

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:39.360
And the wheels feel a little flimsy but I
think they did a good job when I eventually

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:41.670
tested them with some weight

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.400
Now one important step that I wanted to show

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:54.150
you here was "How to use a Cotter Pin"
A "Cotter Pin" is something that will keep

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:57.590
the wheels in place
And this is a general instruction on how to

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:02.209
use a cotter pin
So you basically take pliers and bend them

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:07.160
over on both sides
And that should do the job of setting up the

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:15.560
Cotter Pin on your wheel
And if you notice, the Cotter Pin is what keeps the wheels in place

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:19.940
So here we are - that's our assembled cart

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:24.960
- our Garden Cart
Now a Garden Cart is a modern version of the

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:29.310
wheelbarrow
Its much more easy to maneuver and the best

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:36.050
part as you can see here is its maneuverability
So here you can see that I have added a lot

00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:40.279
of weight to this garden cart
And it was actually easy to move it with all

00:04:40.289 --> 00:04:43.740
this weight
I am guessing this would be about 75 lbs or

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:48.560
so
And look at the profile - you can easily navigate

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:53.279
this cart between raised beds
Now I know I haven't shown you my raised bed

00:04:53.279 --> 00:04:55.639
yet - that's going to be one of my future
videos

00:04:55.639 --> 00:05:01.340
But if you look at how easy it is to maneuver
this cart along raised beds

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:07.189
So if you do have raised beds and have about
2 feet or so between them, a garden cart will

00:05:07.189 --> 00:05:08.849
work much better than a wheelbarrow

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:15.820
So this is the "Dump" feature of the cart

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:20.520
And this is something that you cannot do with
a wheelbarrow

00:05:20.529 --> 00:05:25.659
So you just lift the lock off like that
And then the wheels come together

00:05:25.659 --> 00:05:28.979
And you can dump whatever is in your cart

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:35.360
If you're mixing things like soil and fertilizer

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:41.570
Or anything in your garden cart, the dump
feature lets you easily dump it without breaking your back

00:05:44.640 --> 00:05:46.580
So here we have it - this is our garden cart

00:05:46.590 --> 00:05:51.710
And it has a lot of advantages
Like it lets you move a lot of soil and other

00:05:51.710 --> 00:05:53.610
things without breaking your back

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:57.360
It will also let you carry things around your

00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:03.449
garden like fertilizer, plants, pots, things
that are heavy

00:06:03.449 --> 00:06:06.029
Become very easy when you use a Garden Cart

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:09.440
So how about a wheelbarrow?

00:06:09.789 --> 00:06:11.329
Now a wheelbarrow is a good option, 

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:13.880
especially if you are used to maneuvering it

00:06:14.509 --> 00:06:18.949
But when I used a wheelbarrow, I just found
it was a little inconvenient, compared to

00:06:18.949 --> 00:06:22.520
a garden cart
Now I've used wheelbarrows for a while, but

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:26.270
a garden cart is just a little more comfortable
to use

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:31.039
Another disadvantage of a wheelbarrow is that
its a little wide

00:06:31.039 --> 00:06:35.589
So if you have raised beds and narrow paths
in your garden, a wheelbarrow is going to

00:06:35.589 --> 00:06:39.169
be much more difficult to maneuver compared
to a garden cart

00:06:41.949 --> 00:06:45.439
So there we have it - that's what a Garden
Cart is

00:06:45.439 --> 00:06:51.039
And that's what a wheelbarrow is
Now which one suits you better is up to you

00:06:51.039 --> 00:06:54.809
to decide
Those of you who have been using a wheelbarrow

00:06:54.809 --> 00:06:59.960
for a while might just like to use it or get
a replacement wheelbarrow

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:02.759
But for those of you looking to buy a new
one

00:07:02.759 --> 00:07:08.529
You now know what the difference are and you
can make a much more informed decision

00:07:08.529 --> 00:07:11.779
So I hope you liked this video
And I'll see you again soon

00:07:11.779 --> 00:07:16.399
In another episode of California Gardening
Until then...Happy Gardening!
