00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:19.680
So you had a success on the home consoles
in the 8-bit era.

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.420
What’s the next logical step?

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:22.789
DO IT AGAIN.

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:26.510
Change one or two things, then do whatever
you just did again.

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:28.029
Call it Mega Man 2.

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:29.240
Call it DuckTales 2.

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.980
Call it Super Mario Bros. 2 (in Japan, anyway).

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.200
And don’t look back.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:37.109
When I extracted Wagyan Land 2 from Felicity
in Worcestershire’s box of import goodness,

00:00:37.109 --> 00:00:38.199
I immediately had a preconception.

00:00:38.199 --> 00:00:46.059
And, after plugging in the rather large cart
and playing the game, I can say with conviction,

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:47.829
“IT IS WHAT I THOUGHT IT WAS.”

00:00:47.829 --> 00:00:53.119
It’s more Wagyan Land, with the same platforming,
the same weird edutainment boss fights, and

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:55.350
the same mechanical dinos... wait.

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:58.019
You say it’s the first Wagyan’s son?

00:00:58.019 --> 00:01:00.089
How the hell can you tell?

00:01:00.089 --> 00:01:03.100
It’s the same sprite!

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:10.530
But, this IS Wagyan Land 2, and that number
isn’t just hanging about there because it’s

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.340
Wednesday and it has nowhere better to be.

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:14.869
There are a number of improvements, starting
with a greater diversity of power-ups.

00:01:14.869 --> 00:01:18.719
Some of these just boost your score (thus
moving you closer to extra lives), but some

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:22.350
can imbue Wagyan II with invincibility or
a propeller function for his tail, allowing

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.229
for glide jumps so long as you continue to
mash the jump button.

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:28.509
These make the platforming sections a little
more forgiving; said sidescrolling areas can

00:01:28.509 --> 00:01:34.490
now be taller than one screen high and seem
to be a bit shorter than in the predecessor.

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:37.810
That said, it’s still a fairly bog-standard
platformer.

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:44.170
The occasional weird weapon like the Egg Helmet
helps to spice things up, but aside from emulations

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:50.200
of Bonk’s Adventure, it’s really not that
much more useful than the basic shout-at-things-to-stun

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:54.240
them armament that comes pre-installed on
all Wagyan models.

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:55.700
And then, there’s a boss fight which has
nothing to do whatsoever with weapons or anything.

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:05.060
In addition to the word-chains and concentration
puzzles from the last game, Wagyan Land 2

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:10.820
introduces a kind of number-race challenge,
where you and the boss go head-to-head finding

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:17.379
and selecting numbers in order from a five-by-eight
grid of shuffled cards.

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:24.360
Manage to claim enough numbers to fill or
exceed your quota, and the boss sulks off

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.870
and does whatever defeated bosses do.

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:32.400
But even these feel significantly easier than
last time; the bosses take their sweet time

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.790
finding numbers, and during the shiritori
throw-downs, there’s not as much deviation

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:38.530
in the tiles available.

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:45.459
Two such fights played out almost identically,
with both bosses being stymied at the lack

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:47.910
of a word starting with “do.”

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:52.019
Did kinda take the fun out of it.

00:02:52.019 --> 00:03:01.450
Wagyan Land 2 is a decent enough game, but
the diminished challenge and largely retrodden

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:04.340
territory prevent it from being in the upper
echelon of sequels.

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:08.159
But now you’re better at finding numbers
really fast!

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:09.680
So there’s that.
