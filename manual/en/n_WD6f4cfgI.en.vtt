securely into the port

00:02:31.449 --> 00:02:35.859
another option is to move the ethernet
cable to a different ethernet port on

00:02:35.859 --> 00:02:37.609
your wi-fi router

00:02:37.609 --> 00:02:43.019
you can also try using another ethernet
cable if available

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:46.979
remember if the phone light and internet light are
flashing in unison

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:50.879
do not disconnect the basic talk power
