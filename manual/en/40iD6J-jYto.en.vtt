00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.360
Oh, so you decided to stop by in the middle of the cat party? As you see it's a total success!

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:07.720
For real! I'm gonna puke! 

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:09.720
It smells so disgusting!

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:13.540
Today's recipe is coffe machine made cat food cake!

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:16.220
Coffe Machine Cuisine cooks Cat food cake.

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:20.300
We'll start with the kibble in the jug.

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:23.020
Oh, I droped a lot.. Doesn't matter!

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:28.260
And then water. But not too much, only to cover the kibble.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.260
This is suppose to be loosen up.

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:32.940
I think this is the most disgusting recipe I've ever done.

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:34.120
But it's fun!

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:38.740
While we're waiting for this to be all nasty,

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:44.740
I'll prepare the tin dressed with a bit of film.

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:47.080
Okey, it smells so bad!

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.340
It has begun to take form as a big grunge.

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:56.400
One layer of disgust..

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
I feel sorry for you who're filming! 

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:00.840
And then some ham. 

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:02.680
Oh, it's so disgusting!

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:04.740
 What wouldn't you do for your cats?

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:09.900
That's why they've been starving all day. Because now they have to eat this one!

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.460
Let's wrap it and put it in the freezer.

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:14.460
Zappa, you have to wait!

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:17.080
Soon there will be food!

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:21.700
Now I've changed my clothes to a more festive outfit because it's almost party time!

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:23.700
I just have to decorate the cake.

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.700
Then you put it upside down.

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.700
Beautiful, huh?

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.320
It's perfectly shaped like a heart! And here you can see all of the layers!

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.320
They start to get all excited!

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.340
I bought the wrong liver pâté. 

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:40.040
It should have been the spreadable one, but this one says sliceable?

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.340
I didn't even know there was a sliceable liver pâté!

00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:46.400
It was suppose to be easy to spread. 

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:51.840
We want that nice top layer! All smooth.

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.580
You know how to do with a sandwich layer cake? When you take soft cheese and spread it all over

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:59.500
so it becomes nicely plain and not look like this.

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.960
Ah.. I wanted to make an impression on the cats!

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.940
Well, I hope they'll be happy because at least I tried.

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:06.940
Anyway, they like tuna!

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.320
Cats have to like it.

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:11.640
Of course it has to be a rose on the top of the cake.

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.020
Let's make a hole where it can be attached. 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:17.640
And a few shrimps.

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.940
Hi, do you want a shrimp?

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:23.260
No, she dosen't like the shrimps. She are waiting for those crisps!

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.380
It smells awfully!

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:30.240
Why not put a shrimp like this? After all, it's a party!

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:34.020
I'm not sure the caviar is appropriate for cats to eat, I'll just give them a little bit..

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:35.280
Okey, then!

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.280
Now let's see if they want to taste some.

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.560
Come here, Zappa!

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.200
It isn't dangerous!

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:46.220
He likes all of this stuff, so please eat now!

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:49.440
Now, when I've been cooking this awful cake. You gotta eat it!

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:52.500
He tasted a bit!

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:53.920
Now another one's coming!

00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.920
I'm barely breathing because I'm afraid they'll run off. 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:01.040
Gucci's wearing a funnel collar and feels too ugly for being on a party.

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:03.500
You have to wear a hat.

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:09.180
Look what they're eating! They are eating on the wrapping string! 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:11.560
Do you want to wear this?

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.140
Well, today we've been cooking cat food cake.

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:19.420
Maybe the reason was to cheer Gucci up, she's so depressed in her funnel collar.

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:22.240
As you see, she's happier now!

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:26.160
If you also have cats who are depressed, a cat food cake will make them happy again!

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.160
Right, Gucci?

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:32.820
If I were a cat I would have been tempted by this one.

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:36.400
Zappa!

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:39.120
Zappa!

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:43.760
They don't care about it.
