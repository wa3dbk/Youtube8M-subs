00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:05.359
 

00:00:05.359 --> 00:00:09.120
What you want out of a trailer? 
How about the versatility to all the ATV's,

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.980
motorcycles, antiques, furniture,
construction materials,

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:14.490
or just about anything you need to get the job done?

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:17.759
What about the durability, to get where
you need to go without the maintenance

00:00:17.759 --> 00:00:19.450
hassles with all the other brands?

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:24.230
Hi, I'm Justin. And this is the Featherlite
Trailers Model 1611, multiple purpose hauler.

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:24.769
 

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:28.070
In the next few minutes I'm going give
you a quick walk around tour of the Model 1611.

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:29.109
 

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:33.530
The wider,  bigger,  brother model of the
1610.

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:34.839
You'll get to see some of the 1611's 
standout features

00:00:34.839 --> 00:00:40.830
and options so can figure out if this is
the right trailer for you.

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:43.420
The 1611 comes with tandem axle
set-ups on all its lengths

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:47.160
from twelve-foot all the 
way up to eighteen-foot.

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.670
You'll also see that this model is available in seven wide

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:53.000
or a full 8 foot 6 inches wide, 
which is different than the 1610.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.290
Height wise it's available in six foot six inches or seven feet tall.

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:00.300
All these are to help maximize your cargo area. 
The 1611 features

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:02.490
cross members on 16 inch centers.

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:06.580
You'll notice .040 side sheets. 
You want to be careful when shopping the

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:07.460
competition

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:10.760
they tend to stretch the cross members
or go with thinner side sheets such as

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:15.400
.030. 
This can cause problems later on with the trailer buckling side

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:15.850
sheets

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:19.560
structural damage and so on. 
As I stand at the front the trailer I want to point out

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:20.729
the Aerodyne Nose.

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:23.440
Now what it's gonna do is, we're driving down
the road it's going to help drastically

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:25.240
reduce the wind resistance

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:29.320
but as another benefit on the inside it's
gonna give you any where from 37 to 45 inches

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:29.830
 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:32.800
more room depending on which like the
goal with, and which width.

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.960
The last thing you want to deal with pulling a trailer is wiring issues

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.619
To help drastically reduce that,
Featherlite puts this one piece wiring harness on

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:40.540
the 1611,

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:44.460
like all other models. Its gonna
drastically reduce any issues you may have

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:45.600
It's encased in rubber,

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.110
runs the entire length of the trailer. 
It's gonna reduce any moisture issues

00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:52.410
or vibrations or connections coming
apart like a lot of our competitors when

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:53.470
they use butt connectors

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:57.240
As you notice, the clearance lights on this
trailer are a new design.

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:01.050
They're round, recessed,  they're lighter
brighter and they last longer

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:04.080
The 1611 comes with an optional side door

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.360
it's got a whole back at the bottom, 
nice tight water seal and its lightweight

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.769
As make our way over to the wheels... 
standard it's gonna come with steel.

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:15.590
This one however has got the
simulators on it. You also have some

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:16.700
aluminum options...

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:20.950
site sheet standard is white you get
anything from black, grey,

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:24.140
orange, red and so on... 
or dual color options

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.840
As I mentioned earlier the 1611 comes
standard with LED lights

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:31.500
a good benefit about Featherlite's, though
are the dual LED rears.

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:34.890
They give you good visual of those behind you. 
This trailer also comes standard

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:37.600
with double rear doors, however, this one
has the rear ramp

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:42.700
option on it. It's got a heavy hold back.
Good camlock support for a good tight seal.

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.900
Bring the ramp down and you'll notice it comes
standard with a wood floor

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:50.480
The interior the trailer has the aluminum
upgrade option on it and it will

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:51.480
come wood also.

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:55.200
One area that Featherlite really shines, is
taking care of your cargo.

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.300
You're buying an enclosed trailer for a reason. - you want to protect it from the elements

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:02.170
Now, over time our engineers have spent a
lot of resources

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:06.600
designing a roof to reduce leaks. 
You're gonna notice that our cross members

00:03:06.630 --> 00:03:09.600
and roof bows have a little camber to
them. That's gonna reduce

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:13.200
any puddling on top of that roof. 
Now, the aluminum roof itself

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:17.200
is one piece. It runs the whole length of
the trailer without any cuts or seams

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:20.200
At the top where it attaches to the cross
members

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:24.600
is our Pierce &amp; Roll system. 
The Pierce &amp; Roll system attaches the roof

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:27.700
to the roof rails securely 
without creating any holes

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:31.700
The roof is completely sealed to
eliminate leaks. It's the same kind of system

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:33.100
used on aluminum aircraft

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:36.300
It sheds water easily thanks to these
cambered roof bows

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:41.000
Standard the 1611 is gonna come with the
Featherlite advantage wood floor

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:44.300
This patented material is going
drastically reduce any moisture

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:48.900
issues you may have inside the trailer

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:52.700
The 1611, like other Featherlite models,
comes with multiple options

00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:55.700
Some of the other interior options 
you'll see with this model

00:03:55.770 --> 00:04:00.300
are lining and insulating. You also have
optional interior and exterior lighting

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:01.200
available

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:04.900
such as halogen load lights, 
interior dome lights...

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:09.000
everything from air conditioning
multiple cabinetry options

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.300
you have extra side vents on the walls
Standard this trailer's gonna come

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:16.600
with whites side sheets. 
You have multiple color options to choose from

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:21.000
including dual or tri color options. 
Now it's not uncommon over time to suffer

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:24.200
some nicks and dings in the front of your
trailer from either the vehicle that's towing it

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:28.900
or oncoming traffic. To help prevent that
I recommend this heavy-duty gravel guard

00:04:28.930 --> 00:04:32.700
and by the way it's pretty good looking too.
You have multiple floor tie down

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:34.500
options such as wheel chocks,

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:38.600
recessed d-rings, surface mount tie downs,

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:41.900
E-Track A-Track and lots more.

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:45.700
After all the great things I've mentioned
about this Featherlite Model 1611

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:49.300
the one thing I haven't talked on,
is its 10-year limited warranty

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:53.400
It's transferable on a purchase a new
Featherlite and that means your trailer

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:57.570
will hold its value for a long time. These are
just a few the highlights the Model

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:58.500
1611

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:02.300
you can see a lot more at your local
Featherlite dealer. Why not go there and

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:04.800
see for yourself with the 1611 has
to offer?

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:07.800
