00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.533
I'm gonna show you
how to cut up a whole pineapple

00:00:02.533 --> 00:00:05.967
into chunks and slices,
but--but first if you're wondering

00:00:05.967 --> 00:00:09.300
how to pick a ripe pineapple,
really what you're looking for is color.

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.767
You want a nice balance
between green background

00:00:12.767 --> 00:00:16.633
and a little bit of gold running
all throughout the pineapple.

00:00:16.633 --> 00:00:20.700
Okay, let's get started
with the cutting up part.

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:24.200
So, first of all, we want to remove
both ends of the pineapple.

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.567
So holding it very, very firmly
and taking a really sharp knife.

00:00:27.567 --> 00:00:29.633
It's important now to have
a very sharp knife,

00:00:29.633 --> 00:00:33.433
which will go through the bottom
of this very easily, like that.

00:00:33.433 --> 00:00:36.567
Flip it around to the other side
and do the same thing,

00:00:36.567 --> 00:00:37.867
removing the fronds.

00:00:37.867 --> 00:00:40.133
This is very attractive
and it's very decorative

00:00:40.133 --> 00:00:43.233
and you can use it as a centerpiece,
maybe, for a fruit bowl,

00:00:43.233 --> 00:00:44.900
but we really don't need it
for this purpose,

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:47.500
so let's just set that--move that aside.

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.567
Now I'm gonna cut this again
in half crosswise,

00:00:50.567 --> 00:00:55.333
so let's just take that and cut it
straight down the middle.

00:00:55.333 --> 00:00:59.233
Move one side to the side,
one piece to the side.

00:00:59.233 --> 00:01:02.133
Take the other piece and, again,
with your sharp knife--

00:01:02.133 --> 00:01:05.433
you can see the eyes very easily in this,
all around the edge,

00:01:05.433 --> 00:01:07.700
so what you want to do is remove those,
as well.

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:10.700
So we're going to cut
down the pineapple,

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:16.833
following the curve of the fruit
all the way down and through,

00:01:16.833 --> 00:01:19.367
much the way you would do
a piece of citrus fruit,

00:01:19.367 --> 00:01:23.667
like if you were cutting up an orange
that you wanted to slice up

00:01:23.667 --> 00:01:27.233
into smaller pieces,
so let's do that.

00:01:27.233 --> 00:01:29.767
All right, and--and if you have
a few little eyes

00:01:29.767 --> 00:01:33.567
that are--or pieces that are, um,
still in there,

00:01:33.567 --> 00:01:36.400
you can always trim that up a little bit.

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.333
We have that pretty much
cleaned up.

00:01:39.333 --> 00:01:41.567
Oh, here's another one
we wanna get rid of.

00:01:41.567 --> 00:01:46.267
Okay, let's move this off to the side so
it's not in your way.

00:01:46.267 --> 00:01:51.000
And, um, now we're cutting this half
into quarters for chunks,

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:57.600
so we're gonna cut that into half
and then again into another half.

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.000
And then, you can
pretty easily see the core

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.767
running through
the center over there,

00:02:02.767 --> 00:02:06.433
so it's really easy just to go like this
and get rid of the core.

00:02:06.433 --> 00:02:10.467
So now we've got the pineapple
and you can cut it into pieces

00:02:10.467 --> 00:02:14.833
as large or as small as you need them
for whatever purpose.

00:02:14.833 --> 00:02:19.300
All right, now, let's take in--or bring in
the other side of this

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:20.667
and do some slices.

00:02:20.667 --> 00:02:24.800
So, again, um, I like to put
the bigger side down first.

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.267
Let's do the same thing all around.

00:02:28.267 --> 00:02:31.967
I know you're thinking, "Boy, I don't want
to waste too much of this."

00:02:31.967 --> 00:02:35.467
And I would totally agree,
but you really do need to cut off

00:02:35.467 --> 00:02:40.233
those little brown bits,
or eyes, along the sides,

00:02:40.233 --> 00:02:44.500
so you're gonna have a little bit of waste
here no matter how you look at it.

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:50.267
So, in this case, I'm going to just cut
through the pineapple once,

00:02:50.267 --> 00:02:53.433
not into quarters,
but just into halves,

00:02:53.433 --> 00:02:58.867
and then lay it down like that
and then cut that into slices.

00:02:58.867 --> 00:03:01.533
Why would I want to do this
and leave the core in?

00:03:01.533 --> 00:03:04.267
Because I'm going to be using this
for grilling, perhaps, tonight,

00:03:04.267 --> 00:03:08.767
and if you leave the core in, it just
really helps the fruit to hold together

00:03:08.767 --> 00:03:13.267
because as it cooks, this will soften
and, um, and, you know,

00:03:13.267 --> 00:03:18.133
it might become a little bit less--
it won't be as firm as it when it's raw.

00:03:18.133 --> 00:03:19.267
So, that's it.

00:03:19.267 --> 00:03:23.033
It's really very, very easy to do
and try it at home.
