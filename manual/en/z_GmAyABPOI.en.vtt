00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:12.190
Another tool that you might use for your long
coated dog is an electric razor. I got 2 examples

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:21.640
of razors here. I'll start with the simple
one. This is actually a small hand held battery

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:30.770
operated. It takes one double A battery, so
it's a small hand held battery operated electric

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:42.070
razor. It comes with cleaning solution and
a little brush tool to clean off the razor,

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:52.320
and it also comes with different sized attachments
that you can place right on here. That helps

00:00:52.320 --> 00:01:00.440
you keep your distance from the skin. A couple
of different companies make them They're relatively

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:11.760
inexpensive and these tools are great to one;
start getting your dog used to the sound of

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:18.560
the razor. It's very convenient to use in
small places when you're working on your dog,

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:25.600
on their feet, getting into tight areas under
armpits. It's a great little tool to have

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:31.159
in your grooming box, very handy. You want
to make sure that before you actually start

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:40.289
using it on your dog that they are
comfortable with the sound. You can see this

00:01:40.289 --> 00:01:46.899
guy doesn't care too much. He's sleeping on
the table like he's supposed to be doing.

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:56.659
Another type of razor, also indispensable
at times for a large coated breed is an electric

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:05.219
razor. This is a larger type of razor. It
is an electric one. When you go out to buy

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:11.760
one you can see here that this cord is a little
bit long, but it's very very handy. You never

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:17.890
know where you're going to have to be plugging
it in. This is a very long corded electric

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:24.580
razor. Millions of companies, tons of companies
make different ones. This is fairly heavy,

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:33.750
hefty one. Again, it comes with different
attachment pieces so you know exactly what's

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:40.530
the distance from the hair from the skin that
you're cutting. They also will come with attachment

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:48.080
replacement blades. This could be a very good
thing to have with your dog. If your dog get

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:51.670
very matted. If you have a long coated breed
and he get very, very matted, you actually

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:56.710
might need this tool to cut him down and start
over from scratch, but let's hope not.
