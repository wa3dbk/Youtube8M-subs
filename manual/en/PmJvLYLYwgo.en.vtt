00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:06.040
Barbie - Raquelle Gets Ken?

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:08.500
(Phone ringing)

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:09.620
Hello?

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:10.640
(crackle! crackle!)

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.060
Barbie, is that you?

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:15.900
(crackle!) Yes

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:19.160
(crackle!) me Barbie

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:21.580
I think we've got a bad line

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:23.940
(crackle!) sorry (crackle!)

00:00:24.440 --> 00:00:27.500
Ken (crackle) not going out (crackle!)

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:29.140
would like to (crackle!)

00:00:29.260 --> 00:00:31.240
go out with you (crackle!)

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:32.220
What?

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:36.360
If I heard correctly, Ken is no longer going

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.240
out with Barbie and he wants to see me!

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:44.180
If they just broke up, Barbie is being really good about it

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:47.380
(crackle!) want (crackle!) to come over now

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:48.380
Yes!

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.980
I mean, yes, of course

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:52.320
Thank you Barbie!

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.920
Are you sure this won't bother you?

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:58.480
(crackle!) no (crackle!) that's fine

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:59.960
(crackle!) Bye! (crackle!)

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.320
You have to be joking?

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.080
All these years I've been chasing after Ken

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.620
and she hands him over to me on a a silver platter

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.440
She's one crazy girl!

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.060
Better hurry and look my best

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:18.720
Well the line was not very good,

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.540
but I think she understood

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.200
So this friend of yours is happy to meet me?

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.100
Ahhh, Ben...

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:28.020
She's over the moon!

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.040
I think she thought I'd have a problem with it...

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:33.460
Anyway, go, go!

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:35.240
Raquelle's waiting for you

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:36.960
Have fun Ben

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:41.060
Be careful, she can be a strange one at times

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:42.700
Thanks guys

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.160
See you later

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:46.280
(Doorbell rings)

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:48.380
Hi Raquelle, I'm...

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:50.380
Oh don't be silly!

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:51.880
I know who you are

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.960
Finally we can be together

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:55.880
But...

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.040
But nothing

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:58.600
We can talk later

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:00.940
So, what do you want to do?

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:05.400
Movie, shopping, drive up the coast,

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:08.400
go for a walk, have some lunch,

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.440
a picnic maybe, bake a cake, ride a bike...

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.920
Hmmm, Ken said you can be strange at times...

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:18.500
Weird!

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:20.660
Ken's talking to himself

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:22.560
How about lunch?

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:24.940
I know this burger place

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.940
Perfect!

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:29.240
Let's go....my new boyfriend...

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:32.740
I am starving!

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:34.780
How about we sit here?

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:36.300
I'll go order

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:38.660
Ok...

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.080
Alright, you go order and I'll sit here...

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:45.520
Ok...

00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:46.940
Raquelle?

00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:48.200
Yes...

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:48.740
Oh!

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:50.020
Hmmm...right!

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:50.720
Sorry!

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.060
I'll go order

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:55.520
Be right back...my new boyfriend...

00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:59.380
Ha, ha, ha...

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:01.720
Ken your so funny!

00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:03.760
What?

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.360
Why that little...!

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:09.560
How dare they play a nasty trick on me

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:11.340
How could they!

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:12.400
I mean...

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:13.220
Raquelle?

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:14.580
Are you alright?

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:16.860
What do you mean am I alright?

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:19.600
I just saw you with what's-her-name

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.600
Raquelle, I've been sitting over there waiting for you,

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.120
so I'm not sure what you're talking about

00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:28.640
If this isn't a good time for you...

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:29.920
No, no!

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:30.560
It's fine

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:32.880
I must be imagining things

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:34.500
Let's have lunch

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:38.080
Thanks for lunch Raquelle

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:40.020
I'll get the next meal

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:42.340
Maybe even dinner tonight!

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:44.820
I would love that...

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:46.300
It's a date!

00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:49.540
I've got to catch up with a few friends now

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:51.340
but I'll pick you up after that

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:55.580
Hmmm, looks like I left my jacket inside

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:57.240
Just be a moment

00:03:58.300 --> 00:03:59.060
Ok

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:01.720
I'll be waiting here...

00:04:02.020 --> 00:04:02.560
Ken...

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:04.640
I don’t think he heard me

00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:08.340
I can't believe I'm going out with Ken!

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:11.560
After all these years he's finally realised

00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:13.060
he can't live without me

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:16.700
Barbie must be crazy to let him go

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:18.280
Barbie...

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:19.740
Barbie!

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:22.220
What is she doing with Ken!

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.700
How dare she!

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:28.080
She has no right to...

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:28.740
Raquelle...

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:30.080
You ok?

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:31.860
You seem a little upset

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:36.360
Well you would too if someone stole your boyfriend...

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:37.420
You’re here!

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:39.360
But, but...

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:40.800
You were there...

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:42.560
but now you're here...

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:44.800
I'm going to take you home

00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:47.060
You're not making much sense

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:49.160
Ahhh, yes

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:50.340
Good idea

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:52.220
But we're still on for tonight!

00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:58.760
Well, I feel much better after that rest

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:02.660
Maybe I'm imagining things because I'm so excited

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:07.040
Actually, Barbie's been so nice about this

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:09.000
I really should thank her

00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:14.200
(Phone ringing)

00:05:14.560 --> 00:05:15.200
Hello...?

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:16.680
Hi Barbie!

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:17.680
It's Raquelle

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:19.280
Hi Raquelle!

00:05:19.780 --> 00:05:21.820
How did you little date go?

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:23.940
Did I do well or what?

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:25.940
It went great!

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:28.740
In fact that's why I'm ringing you

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:32.040
I wanted to thank you for being so generous

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:33.200
Generous?

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:35.200
That's a bit much

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:36.340
I only...

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:38.160
Hold on Raquelle...

00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:41.240
Ken, can you keep it down

00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:42.600
I'm on the phone

00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:43.740
Ken!

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:45.440
Ken's there?

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:49.200
Yes of course he's here, why wouldn't he be?

00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:52.160
It's Raquelle ringing on the phone to thank me

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:54.380
Ok Ken, ok...

00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:57.000
Ken said to say hi

00:05:57.700 --> 00:05:58.920
Oh did he now!

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:01.580
Tell him he better start running!

00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:03.840
(Doorbell rings)

00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:05.260
Raquelle...

00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:06.260
You're here

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:07.740
That was quick!

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:11.480
Don't act funny with me miss goody two-shoes

00:06:11.980 --> 00:06:12.860
Where is he?

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:14.120
Ben?

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:15.260
Ben's here

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:16.940
Hi Raquelle!

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:18.060
Ben?

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:19.900
Whose Ben?

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:21.420
Oh!

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:22.740
I see...

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:25.880
Is this some sort of practical joke?

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:27.340
Ha, ha...

00:06:27.660 --> 00:06:28.280
Funny!

00:06:28.620 --> 00:06:30.160
Ken, Ben...

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:31.320
I get it

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:33.460
I suppose Sven is here too?

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:35.040
Hey Raquelle!

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:37.680
So what did you think of my cousin Ben

00:06:38.420 --> 00:06:39.960
He seems to like you

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:41.460
Ken!

00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:43.880
You're not supposed to tell her that!

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:45.360
What the...?

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:47.660
But I though he was you...

00:06:48.520 --> 00:06:49.600
but he's not you...

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:52.060
so you're you and he's...

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:55.140
I think I need to lie down again...

00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:58.900
I told you she was a funny one Benny boy!

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:01.020
You can say that again!

00:07:01.740 --> 00:07:04.200
I wonder if she still wants to go out with me?

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:07.120
You won't have to worry about that Ben

00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:10.240
I've got a good feeling she'll be back!
