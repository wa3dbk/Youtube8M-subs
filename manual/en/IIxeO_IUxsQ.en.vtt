00:00:07.009 --> 00:00:10.651
You've checked out Part 1 of the series on
howcast.com and successfully successfully

00:00:10.651 --> 00:00:12.160
drained the used oil.

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:16.070
Now it's time the replace the filter and add
new oil.

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:22.750
You will need Your car’s owner’s manual
A car jack and jack stands An oil pan An oil-filter

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:30.970
wrench A new oil filter A funnel A rag or
a paper towel A large resealable plastic bag

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:39.070
Motor oil and an approved automotive store
that can dispose of your used oil and filter.

00:00:39.070 --> 00:00:41.260
Changing your oil can be dangerous, so be
careful.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:46.250
If the car is jacked up incorrectly, you can
hurt yourself and damage the car.

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:47.390
Step 1.

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:51.620
Under the hood or under the car, locate the
oil filter, which is usually in the lower

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:53.010
half of the engine block.

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.940
Put the oil pan on the ground underneath the
filter.

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:59.840
With the oil-filter wrench, turn the filter
counterclockwise to loosen it.

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.660
Slowly and carefully remove it with your hands.

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:06.240
The filter is full of oil: Have the oil pan
handy.

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:09.670
Seal the filter in the plastic bag and set
it aside.

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:13.440
Once you remove the filter, make sure the
rubber seal has come off with it and is not

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.350
still attached to your car.

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:16.460
Step 2.

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:17.640
Open the new filter.

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:22.240
With your finger, rub a thin layer of fresh
oil around the rubber seal to lubricate it.

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:23.290
Step 3.

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:26.330
Install the filter securely by turning it
clockwise.

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:28.100
You don’t need the oil-filter wrench.

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.550
If the filter is screwed in too tightly, it
can be damaged.

00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:33.550
Step 4.

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:35.800
Jack the car up slightly higher.

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:39.580
Remove the jack stand; then lower the car
back to the ground.

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:41.300
Remove the jack.

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:42.420
Step 5.

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:46.380
Under the hood, insert the funnel into the
oil filler you opened earlier.

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:48.130
Pour the oil into the funnel.

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:50.510
Most cars require 4 to 6 quarts.

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:51.840
Don’t top it off.

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:53.450
Replace the oil cap.

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:54.450
Step 6.

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:59.010
Start the car, let the engine run for about
30 seconds, and then turn it off.

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:00.159
Step 7.

00:02:00.159 --> 00:02:04.700
Under the hood, pull out the oil dipstick,
and wipe it with a rag or paper towel.

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:07.510
Slide the dipstick all the way back into its
slot.

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:08.950
Pull the dipstick out again.

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:12.830
Notice where the line of oil falls on the
stick -- it should be somewhere between the

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:15.049
“add” and “full” markers.

00:02:15.049 --> 00:02:17.299
If you need to add more oil, do so.

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:19.340
If not, replace the dipstick.

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:20.340
Step 8.

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.819
Close the hood and take your car for a spin.

00:02:22.819 --> 00:02:28.190
First stop: an automotive store, to drop off
the used oil and filter for proper disposal.

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:33.469
Did you know In 2007, an eco-friendly company
produced the first widely available synthetic

00:02:33.469 --> 00:02:36.459
motor oil made entirely from animal fat.
