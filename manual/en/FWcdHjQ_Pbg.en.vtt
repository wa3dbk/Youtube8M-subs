00:00:00.299 --> 00:00:02.480
Yeah my name's different. It's actually 

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:03.790
got a gnarly meaning.

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:06.450
It means God will judge so

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.309
thanks Mom.

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:50.750
I got into surfing

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:53.490
when I was young. I mean, I don't remember my first wave

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:58.500
or anything like that, cause I was just always around the ocean

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:59.980
My dad, he surfed.

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:02.030
He shaped boards and my mum

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:04.080
fished she loved fishing.

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.310
My brother and my sisters we'd just hang on the beach and dad would push me into waves

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:09.530
and stuff like that

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:14.600
so just as long as I remember I've been surfing. 
Yades was a classic kid like when he was

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:16.310
growing up. He was cheeky 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:21.710
as f@#k ya know, super cheeky, always playing pranks on hoops of people and... but you know, 

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:26.180
he's an animal in the surf.

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:27.560
Gracetown

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:32.430
is probably the best spot to grow up surfing as- being a kid.

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:35.290
It's a big bay, you've got North Point on one side which is like

00:01:35.290 --> 00:01:37.520
one of the best waves in Australia.

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:42.580
Anytime that was breaking I was out
there with my friends and family and

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:43.800
that bay was, 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.230
was kinda me when I was younger.

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:48.980
Where I'm from and where Yadin's from is

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:52.890
pretty simple living it's just country towns.  There's not much besides

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:54.110
wineries and 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:55.650
really nice beaches.

00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:00.740
There isn't that much to do besides surf if you're a kid. So we'd, we'd surf

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:02.390
all the time.

00:02:02.390 --> 00:02:09.390
It's a good place to grow up.

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:10.499
Well Yadin tried for a 

00:02:10.499 --> 00:02:13.489
few years to qualify for the World Tour which is 

00:02:13.489 --> 00:02:15.249
the top 32 in the world. It's really 

00:02:15.249 --> 00:02:16.140
tough. Only a few

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:17.359
 guys make it ya know, 

00:02:17.359 --> 00:02:19.019
so he knew that if

00:02:19.019 --> 00:02:25.499
he got a result at the US Open last year, 
he could qualify for the World Tour. 
Going into Huntington and needing a

00:02:25.499 --> 00:02:30.999
result, I knew what I needed to do and that felt good.

00:02:30.999 --> 00:02:32.730
I had an early morning heat against Royden.

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.209
Yadin Nicol, live action, on his back end.
Boom.
Nice snap.

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:38.959
I snuck through that one and I gotta, I got a couple

00:02:38.959 --> 00:02:41.249
waves that I made work.
Yadin Nicol

00:02:41.249 --> 00:02:42.719
right here taking off.

00:02:42.719 --> 00:02:45.370
That is what we're talking about.

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:47.679
I ended up getting Kolohe in the semis.

00:02:47.679 --> 00:02:50.039
That was a pretty good heat. I mean he was

00:02:50.039 --> 00:02:53.400
surfing great the whole event. He was kind of that guy that was blowing up.

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.229
Kolohe Andino with the arial rotation.
Whoa! Kolohe.

00:02:57.229 --> 00:02:58.389
What's it like in the 

00:02:58.389 --> 00:02:59.599
dying moments of a heat Yadin

00:02:59.599 --> 00:03:02.279
when you know that Kolohe needs about a seven

00:03:02.279 --> 00:03:05.729
and he gets a wave and you hear the crowd roaring?

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:09.579
Kolohe can get a seven in his sleep, so when he did that blast I was 

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:11.419
pretty rattled to be honest.  

00:03:11.419 --> 00:03:12.200
I got a good left.

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.319
Backed it up with an average right

00:03:14.319 --> 00:03:16.799
and umm, at the end he needed a score

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:19.699
so it was kind of a nail biter in that sense

00:03:19.699 --> 00:03:20.709
That was critical.

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:22.069
Frick, I'm over the moon.  At the start of the week

00:03:22.069 --> 00:03:23.349
there's no way

00:03:23.349 --> 00:03:27.059
I would've thought I'd be in the final with Kelly.
You like it?

00:03:27.059 --> 00:03:29.790
Yeah, I love it, I mean, what's not to like.

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:31.419
I didn't think I'd ever be in 

00:03:31.419 --> 00:03:35.709
the US Open final at Huntington.

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:40.229
Those waves don't really suit me that much
at all.  I've never really had a good result

00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:41.359
there. I've never

00:03:41.359 --> 00:03:47.149
got through that many heats. I've never done good there. So I was like, "Alright this is actually gonna be fun."

00:03:47.149 --> 00:03:50.829
You know, there were peaks everywhere and a little wedge came that

00:03:50.829 --> 00:03:53.939
I was deepest for and I could've got and I was like, 

00:03:53.939 --> 00:03:57.719
"Ahh, that's a small one." 
I let Kelly get it. I should've got it.

00:03:57.719 --> 00:04:00.869
He saw something that I didn't in that wave and

00:04:00.869 --> 00:04:05.589
that was just, that was it.
I think what happened was I got that 8.5 to start and he knew

00:04:05.589 --> 00:04:09.080
he had to get a big score to get in the heat
and um...

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:12.139
so he was just going to be patient and wait for a good, big one.

00:04:12.139 --> 00:04:15.329
It couldn't have gone any slower that final.

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:17.069
I was just

00:04:17.069 --> 00:04:20.509
looking around everything was so surreal just like "F#@K look at 

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:23.020
all these people watching

00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:25.770
and I can't catch a wave."

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:29.610
There's guys on the pier going, "Hurry up and catch a wave!"

00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:34.669
And I was just like, "Really? You f#@khead. You think I'm having fun?"

00:04:34.669 --> 00:04:41.179
I said, "Kelly, I don't give a f#@k, if you're on the next good one, I'm going." And he's like, "Yeah, that's cool, I feel-"

00:04:41.179 --> 00:04:43.449
He was like, "Usually like, I'd be- I'd want 

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:50.449
the ocean to go flat, but you know, this is- this is heavy I kinda want you to get a wave right now."

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:53.000
And I caught a close out, went straight.

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.969
That was it, that was the final.

00:04:56.969 --> 00:04:59.940
Well, I guess Yadin wanted me to win he just didn't catch any waves.

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:02.800
He was just sitting out waiting for the big sets.

00:05:02.800 --> 00:05:06.029
You know if he'd got it he probably would've thrown one of those big rotations but he just

00:05:06.029 --> 00:05:07.610
he just never got the wave.

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:11.449
I mean, it was the worst thing ever, seeing someone get cheered up the beach

00:05:11.449 --> 00:05:16.690
I was just like, "Alright how do I find a way to get up, put my head down, get through this

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:21.279
crowd?" That's all I wanted to do, I wanted to just get out of there. 

00:05:21.279 --> 00:05:22.720
Like, glad that's over.

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:29.720
On to the next.

00:05:35.849 --> 00:05:38.889
I like going on a surf trip before a contest.

00:05:38.889 --> 00:05:41.669
We were having so much fun. The waves were pumping.

00:05:41.669 --> 00:05:44.139
I'd just stuck a big air and I was

00:05:44.139 --> 00:05:45.460
feeling good.

00:05:45.460 --> 00:05:48.889
I got another one and

00:05:48.889 --> 00:05:52.319
I felt it snap.

00:05:52.319 --> 00:05:53.659
Life was good

00:05:53.659 --> 00:05:56.349
before that. Life was really good.

00:05:56.349 --> 00:05:57.969
They called the ambulance

00:05:57.969 --> 00:06:01.749
and I was just sitting there tripping out like, "Whoa,

00:06:01.749 --> 00:06:03.349
I don't think I'll be surfing for a
while."
