00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:03.540
(Intro Music)

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:13.500
It's been a year since we last talked about game compulsion

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:15.380
I think it's time we look at it again

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:19.040
In the last year a number of you have written to us talking about your own experiences

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:21.820
and James has had several people, both friends and students,

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:23.520
ask for help getting back to the world

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:25.280
We've learned a lot from these interactions

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:27.160
and I think it's time we talk about what we think are

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.940
some of the root causes of the compulsion that many of us wrestle with

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:33.140
Because, the more we learn, the more  we realize that there's a larger issue

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:34.500
A sense of being lost,

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:35.960
a sense of not having a purpose

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:37.820
that many of us turn to games to solve

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:40.500
I believe that game compulsion is the result of many things,

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.000
but the thing that I rarely hear all of the studies talk about is the human element

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.400
The pressures society may put on us that leave us with the unmet needs that games feed

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:52.100
James talked to several experts and read many papers on game compulsion,

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.380
and we have great respect for the people doing work in this field,

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:57.080
but most of those he talked to didn't play games

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:58.640
They never had to wrestle with that dragon

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:00.680
or see how it affected the lives of those around them

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:02.960
and, because of that, they seem to focus on things like

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.520
the Skinner Box element of games, or adrenaline rush addiction, or whatever

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:09.100
when what's at the heart of it may be a lot closer to home

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:10.760
maybe in our society itself

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.480
I think, today, many of us are lost in society

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:16.600
We don't understand our purpose or why we matter in this world

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:19.100
Back when mankind lived in little villages it was easy.

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.080
If you were the only cobbler in the village, you understood why you mattered

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.080
if you weren't there, no one in the village would have shoes

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:25.820
Today it's just so much harder

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:30.080
I don't know if the human brain was built to comprehend a society of six billion people,

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:34.400
to understand why being a cog in the vast machinery of our modern times could possibly matter

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.860
Many of us look to our jobs, to our lives,

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.440
and see no greater purpose, no reason to be,

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:40.780
and this wears on a body

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.880
If you're entering data into a spreadsheet that you don't even know what it means,

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.560
or pressing a button that puts a cog on a sprocket, which will eventually be some part of a machine you'll never see,

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.740
it's hard to always remember why it all matters

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:53.360
And this is something we NEED.

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.280
It's also something games are very good at giving us

00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:59.680
In this giant post-industrial world, where our purpose might be obscured,

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:02.980
games are very good at giving us a clear sense of purpose,

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:03.660
of being a hero,

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:05.600
of mattering to the people around us

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:08.960
When you're the healer or the tank, you know exactly why you're there

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:10.480
and you can take pride in a job well done

00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:13.560
You can feel accomplished and proud, like you're part of something greater,

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.100
without being subsumed by it

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:17.260
When at the end of a game you save the world,

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:20.620
you're sure of who you are, that you're not just some interchangeable part

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:22.440
And we, as human beings, need that

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.140
You may not notice it in your day-to-day,

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:25.780
you may not be consciously aware,

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.980
you may not be actively registering or saying to yourself regularly:

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:30.920
"I wish I understood better why I matter"

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:32.940
but for many of us, on a subconscious level,

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:34.700
today's society leaves us with that void,

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.220
that gaping hole that games can help fill

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.000
And so, when we talk about game compulsion,

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
we have to talk about a sense of purpose,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.240
about the meaning in our lives outside of games

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:45.120
otherwise the discussion is incomplete

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.980
But along with this loss of meaning also comes a loss of control

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.580
In this giant incomprehensible world we live in,

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:53.600
sometimes you feel like you don't have any agency over your own life

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:57.420
You're going to school, taking classes you don't care about because it's "what you have to do"

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:58.840
your parents would be ashamed if you didn't,

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:01.720
you're stuck in your job because of choices you made years ago,

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:04.820
You can't be with that girl you like cause you're not good enough at talking to people,

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:07.720
or you can't be with that boy you like cause his friends are too cool

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:09.760
Now, these are all illusions

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.380
they're all things we actually do very much have control over,

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:15.940
but it's very very easy to feel powerless in a society where someone else

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:19.940
assigns you grades, gives you job reviews, rejects your resume, or lays you off,

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:22.200
but games give us a sense of agency,

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:23.900
they show us the consequences of our actions,

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:28.340
and always leave the outcome we want as something we can achieve through our direct control

00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:30.300
In a game you know it's a fair playing field

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:33.080
a place where, if you really try, you can succeed

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:35.860
No force beyond your control is going to tinker with that outcome

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:40.480
You're never gonna be denied that job 'cause someone had a bad day in the HR office out of the kipsy,

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:42.520
or get rejected from the school you wanted

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:46.320
because someone didn't have time to really read your essay, 'cause they had to rush out to get their daughter from daycare

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:47.100
No,

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:50.260
in games, YOU are the ultimate authority, the final Arbiter

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.520
The designers make a pact with you that, if you work hard enough and are skilled enough,

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:54.720
you will succeed

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:58.940
That feeling of control, that assurance that our destiny is really our own,

00:03:58.940 --> 00:03:59.920
is something that we all need

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:03.020
something that's essential to our moral, to our well-being

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:05.740
Studies have shown that kids who feel like their choices matter,

00:04:05.740 --> 00:04:09.700
that what they do will get them into the collage they want, or earn them the career they long for,

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:11.700
simply perform better than those who don't,

00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:13.980
regardless of IQ or even school system

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:15.660
When we don't feel that in our lives

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:17.560
it's easy to retreat to games to find it

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:20.880
and slowly withdraw more and more into that world we can control,

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:25.000
as doing so causes our real lives to seem more and more out of our control by comparison

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.760
Lastly, there are times where our society doesn't reward us for things that we think make us great

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:31.380
I mean, I was lucky in high school

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:33.400
I met good people, I found my tribe,

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:36.620
but we've talked to several young people who see all their talent and their gifts;

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:39.920
the fact that they're smart, the fact that they're good at math, or that they've read a lot of books,

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:42.640
and those things seem to have no value in the society they're in

00:04:42.640 --> 00:04:46.880
The popular kid gets the adulation, the praise, friends, and relationships they want

00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:50.520
and so, they turn to games because games reward you for all those things

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:54.140
because games acknowledge to some of us the things society doesn't, and tells us:

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:55.720
"Yeah, you should be proud of that!"

00:04:55.720 --> 00:05:01.280
That is a powerful thing, and an easy place for us to get lost in if the rest of the world doesn't seem to value what's good in us

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:03.340
Just remember, that's all an illusion

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:05.300
WE'RE the ones who create worth,

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:07.020
WE'RE the ones who decide why we matter,

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:08.940
and WE'RE the ones that control our own lives

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:12.580
It may not always seem that way, and it may be much easier to see these things in a game,

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:16.080
to get what you need to that psychic void from characters on a screen,

00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:17.240
but you don't NEED that

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:18.800
Rather, USE it

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:20.060
USE it to make you stronger,

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:22.440
to remind you that you DO write your own story,

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:25.060
that if something doesn't succeed, if it falls out of your grasp,

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:26.340
come up with a new plan

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:28.120
You die in a game and you don't just give up,

00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:29.500
you try something different

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:33.200
Use that lesson in life because our hours in games aren't wasted time,

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:35.700
they're not just a way to burn daylight or escape from the world,

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:37.420
they're a way to teach us to conquer it

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:40.220
And remember, life will always welcome you back.

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:41.560
I'll see you next week.

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:45.040
