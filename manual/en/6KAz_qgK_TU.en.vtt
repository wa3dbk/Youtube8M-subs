00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:23.900
To the stars through hardships. 

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:32.030
Nobody is blessed before death takes them. 

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:34.810
Anticipation of the opponent's arguments. 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:42.720
The die is cast, death is certain, the time is uncertain. 

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:47.360
Know yourself. 

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:51.300
Divide and conquer, live today. 

00:00:51.550 --> 00:01:00.560
We will never wander with nature as our guide. 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:02:01.540
The Gods see all and are seen by none 

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:06.180
Ask, and you shall receive. 

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.050
Knock and the door will open for you. 

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:16.380
Perhaps one day we will look back on those things 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.480
And learn to cherish them. 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.370
Ask, and you shall receive. 

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:26.530
Knock and the door will open for you. 

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:32.330
The wind is never favorable for those  

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:35.560
Who do not know where they are going.

00:03:08.610 --> 00:03:12.560
Nobody is blessed before death takes them. 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:16.480
Anticipation of the opponent's arguments. 

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:24.530
The die is cast, death is certain, the time is uncertain. 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:28.180
Know yourself. 

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:33.010
Divide and conquer, live today. 

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:41.650
We will never wander with nature as our guide.
