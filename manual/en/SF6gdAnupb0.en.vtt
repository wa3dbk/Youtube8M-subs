Hi, this is Laura Turner and today we're going
to talk about how to pronounce silent letters

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:12.139
when reading words in English. This seems
as though it would be easy but sometimes you

00:00:12.139 --> 00:00:18.730
can find some things that are a little difficult
to pronounce. But if you remember which letters

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:24.320
are silent, usually in words you can pretty
much pronounce any word. So what we're going

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:30.369
to do today is I'm going to pronounce a few
words for you. Silent letter b, if you have

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:37.110
a word like crumb, for example, you will just
pronounce the word as though the b is not

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:44.690
even there. Also, with the word subtle, you
notice you actually skip the b and go to the

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:54.460
t, subtle. Silent letter c, like words like
muscle, so you say m u s l e, in effect, when

00:00:54.460 --> 00:01:03.390
it's actually spelled m u s c l e. Silent
letter d, everybody forgets this, Wednesday.

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:11.891
So Wednesday actually has a d, but you of
course pronounce it W e n e s d a y. Silent

00:01:11.891 --> 00:01:23.050
letter g, in words like gnaw, and sign. Silent
letter gh, in words like tough. That's the

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:27.570
one that's sort of a little different from
the others because you actually combine the

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:36.640
letters to make a different sound, a double
f. Silent letter h, in words like heir and

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:43.490
herb, although some people say herb. I think
I've said herb before, but it is actually

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:51.570
supposed to be a silent letter. And then words
like silent letter k, for words like knife,

00:01:51.570 --> 00:02:01.090
knee and know. And that's how you pronounce
some silent letters in English words.
