00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:10.870
Nothing says "the holidays" more than the
aroma of gingerbread wafting through the house.

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:13.160

cake.

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:21.420

1 c. dark molasses 2 large, room temperature

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:28.960
eggs 3 c. all-purpose flour 1 tbsp. ground
ginger 2 tsp. ground cinnamon 1 tsp. salt

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:38.660
1/4 tsp. ground cloves 1 tbsp. baking soda
1 c. water 2 8-oz. packages cream cheese 1/2

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:50.250

Equipment: Wax paper Electric mixer and 1/4

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.680
c. unsweetened cocoa (optional).

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:53.749
Step 1.

00:00:53.749 --> 00:01:00.670
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees Fahrenheit,
then lightly grease a 9x13 inch baking pan,

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:02.530
lining the bottom with wax paper.

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:04.070
Step 2.

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:06.970
Whisk together the oil, sugar, and molasses.

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:11.400
In a separate bowl, lightly beat the eggs
with a fork, then whisk them into the molasses

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.170
mixture until it's smooth.

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:14.350
Step 3.

00:01:14.350 --> 00:01:18.020
In a separate bowl, whisk together the flour
and spices.

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:21.400
Then add the wet mixture, whisking until everything
is completely combined.

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:25.610
For a chocolaty touch, add 1/4 cup unsweetened
cocoa.

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:27.030
Step 4.

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:32.160
Stir the baking soda into a cup of just-boiled
water and whisk it into the batter until just

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:33.160
combined.

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:37.820
Pour into the prepared pan and bake in the
center of the oven until a toothpick inserted

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:41.530
into the center comes out clean, about 45
minutes.

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:43.040
Let cool.

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:44.040
Step 5.

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:48.630
To make the frosting, beat the cream cheese
and butter until fluffy, gradually beating

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.010
in the powdered sugar.

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:52.190
Chill for at least 30 minutes.

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:53.190
Step 6.

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:56.780
Spread the frosting on the gingerbread and
garnish with candied ginger.

00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.750
Enjoy your Christmas cake!

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:04.630
