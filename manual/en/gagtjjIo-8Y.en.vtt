00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:06.160
[chimes] well that's not soup at all..

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:07.270
it's water

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:08.699
in a bowl

00:00:08.699 --> 00:00:12.739
but since it's in the church this water
means much more. We're talking about the

00:00:12.739 --> 00:00:19.739
baptismal font on this episode of Chuck Knows Church [fun intro music]

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.660
Now you may have noticed a bowl

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:40.230
on a stand near the front of your church stands about

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:43.840
yay high, comes in various sizes and styles
depending on your church or the

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:47.460
denomination, and despite what you big
brother my told him to get you in

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:48.860
trouble when you were a kid

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:53.360
it is not a place to wash your hands before
attending worship.

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.550
It's the baptismal font

00:00:56.550 --> 00:01:00.420
and, uh... this font is way cooler than helvetica or times new roman.

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:03.780
Now some baptismal fonts are even large
enough for your whole body

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.570
Now that's called full immersion,

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:08.430
and again despite what your brother
might have said

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.130
those are not for hot tubing.

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.950
Now, in the United Methodist Church most are
small like this one

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:17.619
for the sprinkling

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:19.670
of water onto

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:25.970
and adults.

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:29.370
Baptism initiates us into Christ's holy church. And in the

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:33.080
United Methodist Church it's one of two
sacraments the other being Holy

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:36.960
Communion. Now before you ask I said
sacraments not sacrament

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:39.140
this has nothing to do combating

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.070
bad breath.

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:46.090
Now a sacrament is God's offer of grace to
us and our vow of commitment in

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:47.729
response.

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:51.750
You see, we receive our identity from others from
the expectations and influences of

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:55.520
friends and family and from the labels
that society puts on us.

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:57.800
But to become a Christian

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.780
just to receive a new identity.

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.580
Now we no longer allow others to tell
us who we are

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:05.320
Christ now claims us.

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:10.180
Another way of saying it is we put on
Christ which works out nice 'cause he's

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:12.219
uh... a pretty good fit

00:02:12.219 --> 00:02:15.669
Now baptism celebrates becoming that new
person

00:02:15.669 --> 00:02:17.799
that's why the church's ritual begins
with

00:02:17.799 --> 00:02:21.989
putting off the old by renouncing sin
and the evil powers of the world

00:02:21.989 --> 00:02:23.849
pledging our loyalty

00:02:23.849 --> 00:02:24.889
to Christ.

00:02:24.889 --> 00:02:29.059
So the most important thing about us is
our true identity and we are now sons

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:30.469
and daughters of God.

00:02:30.469 --> 00:02:32.220
We are incorporated into God's

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:39.220
mighty acts of salvation in giving new
birth through water and the spirit.

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:43.779
Now that is the baptismal font

00:02:43.779 --> 00:02:47.269
You wanna learn more you can ask your pastor.

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:48.000
Tell 'em Chuck sent ya.
