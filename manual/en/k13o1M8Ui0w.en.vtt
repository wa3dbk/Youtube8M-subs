00:00:05.367 --> 00:00:06.933
Hello everyone!

00:00:07.033 --> 00:00:12.733
The hero of our story for today is the American tier VI fighter, the F4U-1.

00:00:19.667 --> 00:00:23.267
Its precursor in the Tech Tree is the Grumman F4F Wildcat.

00:00:23.367 --> 00:00:28.967
The only thing the F4U-1 inherited from the F4F is the HVAR rockets.

00:00:29.067 --> 00:00:31.467
It’s not because the F4F is so greedy,

00:00:31.567 --> 00:00:38.667
but because the branch of American fighters starting with the F4U-1 becomes totally different, or more “Corsair-ish”.

00:00:38.767 --> 00:00:43.200
The characteristics of the F4U-1 are much better compared to its precursor.

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:51.467
Durability, fire power, altitude performance, and speed — all these characteristics of the F4U-1 are better, even in its stock configuration.

00:00:51.567 --> 00:00:54.767
And they only get better on your way to top its configuration.

00:00:54.867 --> 00:00:57.933
However, there is no one perfect configuration.

00:00:58.033 --> 00:01:05.333
For its great set of characteristics, the F4U-1 pays for it with a greater average time to turn 360 degrees.

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:10.500
Now, let's compare the F4U-1 with the other tier VI fighters.

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:14.667
Durability is the most prominent characteristic of Corsair.

00:01:14.933 --> 00:01:20.967
It has a considerable amount of hit points, especially with the top airframe mounted.

00:01:21.667 --> 00:01:26.933
Only the German Focke-Wulf 190A-5 can boast the same amount of hit points.

00:01:27.633 --> 00:01:29.067
Speed is also great.

00:01:29.167 --> 00:01:37.967
Even in its cannon-equipped configuration, the Corsair is faster than most fighters, losing only to the P-51A and the Yak-1M.

00:01:38.367 --> 00:01:44.567
And the only aircraft that is able to break away from Corsair in its machine gun configuration is the Mustang.

00:01:44.667 --> 00:01:47.967
The Corsair’s armament options are also quite good.

00:01:48.067 --> 00:01:53.233
Autocannon provide average damage for its tier, and their firing distance is quite good.

00:01:53.333 --> 00:01:57.433
Machine guns should be used at close range and provide more dense fire.

00:01:57.533 --> 00:02:04.400
Whatever weapons configuration you choose, it won’t affect the tactics of flying the F4U-1 greatly.

00:02:04.967 --> 00:02:07.400
Manoeuvrability is not so great, though.

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:16.133
In its autocannon configuration, Corsair turns 360 degrees just a little bit faster than the P-51A and the Focke-Wulf A-5.

00:02:16.233 --> 00:02:21.400
This may not seem adequate enough, but manoeuvrability is not crucial for this aircraft.

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:27.033
Now, let’s take a look at the things that are important and test Corsair in combat.

00:02:29.733 --> 00:02:31.433
So, we’re at the top of the list.

00:02:31.533 --> 00:02:36.267
This is great because a Corsair at the top is like a cruiser among sail boats.

00:02:36.367 --> 00:02:40.200
At the start, you should climb to an altitude of about 2.5km.

00:02:40.633 --> 00:02:46.300
Gain speed and move towards the enemy forces together with a large group of allies.

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:49.933
Essentially, the Corsair is what you would call a “free hunter”.

00:02:50.033 --> 00:02:55.800
It can successfully intercept both high-altitude aircraft and “boom-and-zoom” low-flying targets.

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:58.467
The Corsair can even destroy ground targets.

00:02:58.567 --> 00:03:02.300
Just remember to maintain your airspeed and altitude.

00:03:03.433 --> 00:03:06.867
Hit and run tactics work best against light fighters.

00:03:06.967 --> 00:03:13.967
You can either apply this against single targets or take down enemy aircraft that are busily engaged in a dogfight.

00:03:14.067 --> 00:03:15.733
Don’t forget to watch your back.

00:03:15.833 --> 00:03:22.900
If there’s a bunch of low-altitude manoeuvrable enemy aircraft clinging to your tail, gain altitude and keep rolling.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.833
You can easily break away from slower enemy aircraft due to your high speed.

00:03:27.933 --> 00:03:31.133
Heavy fighters are even easier to counter.

00:03:31.233 --> 00:03:39.933
You have enough manoeuvrability to get behind an enemy heavy and your high speed won’t let them get away from the engagement area.

00:03:40.267 --> 00:03:45.900
However, don’t try head-on attacks against heavy fighters or ground attack aircraft.

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:50.300
You won’t be able to withstand their powerful autocannon.

00:03:50.733 --> 00:03:56.067
Speaking of attack aircraft, they’re almost completely helpless against the F4U-1.

00:03:56.167 --> 00:04:00.533
You can easily dodge their fire, or break away in case of any danger.

00:04:00.633 --> 00:04:06.100
So, if there are no other targets, engage attack aircraft with little worry.

00:04:08.633 --> 00:04:11.567
A few words about ground targets.

00:04:11.967 --> 00:04:18.700
If you decide to carry bombs or rockets, you should first try to sneak into the enemy base flying at high altitude,

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:22.700
release your weapons, then engage enemy aircraft.

00:04:23.767 --> 00:04:31.633
You can also use rockets to eliminate enemy attack aircraft and heavy fighters quickly, but it’s not an easy task.

00:04:32.933 --> 00:04:40.967
Usually, autocannon are enough to finish off already damaged ground targets and deprive the enemy of any advantage.

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:50.067
Sometimes, you won’t be so lucky, and you will find your Corsair at the bottom of the list.

00:04:50.167 --> 00:04:54.167
In this case, you shouldn’t try to play a role of free hunter.

00:04:54.267 --> 00:04:59.867
In this battle tier, enemy aircraft are more durable, and their weapons are more powerful.

00:04:59.967 --> 00:05:07.233
So, you should stay close to a large group of allied aircraft and attack those enemy aircraft that are already engaged in combat.

00:05:07.333 --> 00:05:10.867
In general, your tactics will remain essentially the same.

00:05:10.967 --> 00:05:12.667
Let’s summarise:

00:05:12.767 --> 00:05:16.567
The F4U-1 is definitely a great aircraft.

00:05:16.667 --> 00:05:22.800
It allows you to make a great contribution to victory in every battle, and you will enjoy flying it.

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:30.600
Great characteristics create flexible tactics, allowing the F4U-1 to control many difficult situations.

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:35.867
So, start your engines and good luck, Corsairs!
