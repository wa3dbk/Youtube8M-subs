00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:09.440
Hello, this is XboxAhoy and this is the twenty-first
episode of my Black Ops 2 Attachment Guide.

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:13.920
In this episode we're covering the Target
Finder.

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:18.430
Black Ops 2 marks this attachment's entry
to the series, although we've seen perks and

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:21.300
attachments with similar effect before.

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:25.849
The Thermal scope, as introduced in Modern
Warfare 2, was the first seen form of electronic

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:31.119
aiming assistance - and Modern Warfare 3's
Marksman perk, with its extended marking of

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:34.330
enemies, was also similar in effect.

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:38.949
In real-life, such technology is a little
beyond what we have today: infrared scopes

00:00:38.949 --> 00:00:42.780
probably the closest to such highlighting
of targets.

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.559
More advanced targeting electronics are likely
to be seen on larger-scale ordinance: missile

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:52.010
guidance systems are able to track a moving
target autonomously, using a vehicle's heat

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:55.440
signature or radar emission to stay locked
on.

00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:01.480
In-game, the target finder is available for
the Assault Rifles, SMGs and LMGs.

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:05.640
You may only equip a single optic on any given
weapon, but any other option remains open

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.490
when using the Target Finder.

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.240
The majority of the Target Finder's effects
are fairly obvious: your weapon's iron sights

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:17.740
will be replaced with the optic, and enemies
within your scope will be marked with a red

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:19.710
diamond while you are aiming.

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.460
The zoom level of this optic is the same as
the EOTech sight, or the LMG's innate default:

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:30.540
1.5x, a fairly balanced magnification ideal
for mid to long ranged combat.

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.480
You'll also benefit from a 90% reduction in
idle sway, which can help stay on target when

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:38.520
engaging longer ranged enemies.

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:43.260
The key downside to this optic is the massive
reduction to your peripheral vision: the scope

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:47.909
viewfinder occupies less than half of the
total screen area while the surround obscures

00:01:47.909 --> 00:01:49.530
your view.

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.620
This will leave you vulnerable to flanking
attacks, as you may simply not see an enemy

00:01:53.620 --> 00:01:55.870
approaching from the side.

00:01:55.870 --> 00:02:00.190
For this reason, it's best to make sure you're
firing from a safe location - with your back

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:02.950
covered either by teammates or equipment.

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:07.520
Beyond the loss in peripheral vision, you'll
also need to keep a keen eye out for enemies

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.590
with the cold blooded perk.

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:14.280
Such foes won't be highlighted for you - and
so can take you by surprise, if you don't

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:19.060
pay attention to unmarked targets.

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:23.190
The Target Finder is a particularly usable
optic which provides considerable long-range

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:27.730
assistance while having less explicit close-range
downsides.

00:02:27.730 --> 00:02:32.780
It's great for long-ranged automatic weapons:
anything with low-recoil and high ranged damage

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:34.410
will perform admirably.

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:40.080
LMGs are clearly the best fit, then - the
Mk48 and LSAT perhaps the two most powerful

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.640
options when equipped with this electronic
assistance.

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:48.730
The Assault Rifles can work, too - the longer
ranged automatic options, such as the M27

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:53.360
and SCAR-H are probably the best fit - but
none of the options here are bad with the

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:54.740
right playstyle.

00:02:54.740 --> 00:03:00.750
I'd avoid the optic on SMGs, as such weapons
tend to rely on mobility and awareness - and

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:06.000
the long-range benefits of the sight are lost
on weapons with such low damage and high recoil.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.349
The same applies to any aggressive build - if
you plan to be mobile, the loss in awareness

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:12.390
will dampen your potential.

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:16.689
Still, for those weapons that suit it the
Target Finder can almost feel like cheating

00:03:16.689 --> 00:03:21.930
- and while it is not without downside, the
addition of red diamonds marking your foe

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:24.330
feels like a luxury.

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:29.209
So if you want to suppress the enemy at a
furlong's reach, harness this attachment and

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:30.780
ride its assistance to victory...

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:39.770
...just make sure you don't become blinkered
to the alternatives.

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:42.090
Thanks for watching, this has been XboxAhoy.

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:46.629
Join me for the next attachment guide, when
I'll be covering Extended Clip.

00:03:46.629 --> 00:03:48.260
Until then, farewell.
