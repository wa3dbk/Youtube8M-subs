We have two guest commentators joining us today.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:08.000
- The first guest is Wataru Shimoto, an occult researcher. Hello. 
- Hi.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:16.000
- Next is Reiho Imai, representative of a human rights protection group, "Traveling of the Mind" 
- Hello.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Let's first talk about inattentive driving at Gunma Prefecture. 
There occured another accident in Maebashi city.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:30.000
From what I see, I think it's the tree that's causing the accidents...

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.500
Well, if you think of it, there's no way that a tree 
can grow into a shape like that.

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:41.500
It's basically the problem with soil. 
It's the soil that's affecting the tree.

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:47.500
And I cannot help but think that there's 
some organization behind it.

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:54.500
It's the U.S. Forces that's behind all this. 
I can't speak anymore than this, though.

00:01:54.500 --> 00:02:01.500
-The moment I utter more than this, I will be removed by them.
- I see. Mr. Imai?

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:12.500
Mr. Anchorman, could you please excuse me? It's embarrassing to say 
at this age, but that clip of the tree just made me feel...oh man.

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.500
OK. Moving on...

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:23.500
The next was about illegal medical treatment at a beauty salon.

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:31.100
The owner accidentally used a hair growth promoter instead 
of an inhibitor. Mr. Imai, what is your opinion on it?

00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:43.100
- Well, I'm also concerned with my own hair as you can see, so... 
- Are you putting weird stuff on your hair? Man, you're balding.

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:47.100
Excuse me but you have been commenting 
on my appearance throughout.

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:53.100
- Because it's weird as hell. There must be some organizations involved. 
- Oh, is it so?

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:58.100
- Well, it can't be explained otherwise. How does he have hair like that. 
- I'm just balding...

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:05.100
- Let's move on to the last topic about the chimpanzee on the loose. 
- That's just ridiculous.

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:14.100
- And that chimpanzee can use tools, apparently. 
- It's a conspiracy. He must have chips installed in his brain.

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:21.100
- Chips!? 
- Well, things like this cannot happen on this Earth.

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:31.100
- So there must be extraterrestrial organizations involved. 
- Oh my...!

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:43.100
- It's very likely that you have chips installed in you as well. 
- We appreciate your opinions. Now it's time for us to wrap up.

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:47.100
- Thank you for joining us today. 
- Thank you.

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:50.100
Episode 3. A Satirical Take at the Society!?

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:12.400
I don't know for sure but there are some weirdos out there.

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:17.100
Weirdos who leave plants in the studio, 
and strange babies... what is going on?!

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:21.100
Well, it's our job to report such news I guess.

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:25.700
Don't miss the next episode, "A Super Baby!?"
