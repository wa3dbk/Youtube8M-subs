00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:06.660
Hi! My name is Andy Strohl and on behalf of
Expert Village, in this clip we will be talking

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:16.100
about the Scrabble board itself. Donâ€™t forget
to check out my work at www.strohldigital.com.

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:24.460
Okay, here is the Scrabble board in all its
glory. This is the traditional Scrabble board

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:32.169
and is the folding variety. They actually
make a variety now that spins so that as play

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:40.520
moves to the left, you can also spin the board
so that all the words are always facing you.

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:46.500
The difficulty with this board is that sometimes
you will have to look at the word diagonally

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:52.830
or from the side or upside down. So keep that
in mind when playing. Now the actual board

00:00:52.830 --> 00:01:02.130
structure itself consists of the star in the
center of the board which is denotes exactly

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:09.580
where the play starts. As long as your first
word includes that star, it does not matter

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:15.610
where it is. The first word of course has
to be 4 letters long so this is where game

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:23.460
starts. As you can see diagonally from that
star, is a square that says double letter

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:33.009
score. Then diagonally down from that, triple
letter score and double word score. Now double

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:41.960
letter score is just that. The tile that lands
on this square gets double, so for example

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:48.909
an e was on that square and you use a 1 value,
it becomes 2 just for a letter. Same with

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:59.109
triple letter score. So letter was a 2 like
a g, it would become 6 points and this is

00:01:59.109 --> 00:02:06.179
a really good one, the double word score.
Again, just what it indicates the total score

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:15.590
is doubled when any letter of that word is
included on a double word score and finally

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:25.560
the mother of all placements on this board
is the triple word score. They are exactly

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:35.530
what they say. It is 3 times the amount of
the total word score if any of the tiles from

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:44.990
that word hit this box. Very important box;
needs to be played with great care. We will

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:50.210
discuss this a little bit later and also how
to avoid setting yourself up for your opponent

00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:51.780
to use one of these triple board scores.
