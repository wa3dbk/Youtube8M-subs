Good morning guys. It is day 2 and today we are going to 
 do a wonderful sailing trip out in the bay of Islands.

00:00:09.497 --> 00:00:16.324
Cruising though all these islands and you guys are going to get 
 an in-depth look at what it is to see up here.

00:00:28.653 --> 00:00:33.669
I love the colour of this water!

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:55.124
I can't believe I get to see wild bottlenose 
 dolphins, here in the Bay of Islands.

00:00:55.728 --> 00:01:04.877
There are so many of them too.. They come up to 
 the boat and they are playing with the rudder.

00:01:54.196 --> 00:01:58.960
okay, I'm going to go swim with some live dolphins, yea 
 of course they are live, they are wild though..

00:02:28.167 --> 00:02:35.460
Trying to get close to them. Keep an eye out. Ready?

00:02:49.181 --> 00:02:55.610
That was so amazing. Oh my gosh...that was crazy....

00:02:57.702 --> 00:03:11.660
Wow, my gosh we are on land...haha...so we just stopped at Moturoa island, one of 
 the 144 islands here at the Bay of Islands. That's a lot of islands!

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:21.830
Here for a quick look around,walk around stretch those legs, and have some lunch.

00:03:22.571 --> 00:03:25.540
There's our boat. Hi boat.

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:35.160
We are at the top of the island. Now 
 what? I guess, back to the boat. Yea.
