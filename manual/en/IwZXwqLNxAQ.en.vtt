It’s Saturday march 21st,  the second day of the Seoul Fashion Week. 

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:23.560
Wonder what kind of stage is waiting for us today.

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:30.800
Today, YGK+’s‘Visiting Seoul Fashion Week’ is about to meet the celebrity bffs Cha Seungwon and Song Jio.  

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:35.460
Hi I’m model Kim Pilsu. 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:40.220
It’s the second day of 2015 F/W Seoul Fashion Week and many celebrities have come. 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:49.380
It’s because today the first show of this fair, Song Jio’s show is about to start. 

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.180

00:00:53.460 --> 00:01:02.180
meticulously checking all the details.. he’s a real pro. 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:07.540
When you think of Song Jio show there is one person who comes to mind. That person is Cha Seungwon. 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:11.160
Cha and Song’s long friendship is well known. 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.220
Question- Anypiece of advice for the young models? 

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.700
salmons returning to their natal stream for reproduction, 

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:24.760
I hope we can return to this show every year. 

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:35.240
. It’s an honor for me to be here with all my younger colleagues. 

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:37.860
The final rehearsal is taking place. 

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:45.380
Seungwon’s charismatic performance blurs the boundary line between the rehearsal and the main stage. 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:57.860
The first show of 2015 F/W Seoul Fashion Week ends as a success.  

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:09.020
Today Saturday march 21st, is the second day of Seoul Fashion Week. 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:12.020

Today Munsoo’sMunsookwon show takes place. 

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:30.980
Munsoo who has more than 20,000 followers on SNS, wonder what his show is like

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:32.940
Question-What is your concept in this 2015 F/W Seoul Fashion Week?  

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:35.440
I was inspired by the saying ‘when you can’t sleep, count sheeps’.

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.000
The show’s concept was based on this idea. 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:40.240
Question-Are there any tips for the audience? 

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:42.260
umm..for starters.. many handsome models appear on the show. 

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:52.920
And the clothes are great so I expect you guys will have fun watching the show. 

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.800
Question-What are your expectations for this collection? 

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.040
Hopefully this collection will be an opportunity to promote brand awareness 

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.800
and my name value as a designer. 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:07.720
I wonder what Munsoo is thinking right now. 

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:13.085
Finally the show he has been putting much effort into has ended.

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:16.680
Munsoo’s expression is telling us that the show was successful. 

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:19.060
Question-How do you feel? 

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:26.080
I’m still dizzy.. I think I have to see the video to know for sure this has ended. 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:32.080
I think everything went well for now..

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:35.080
Question- A word to those who have been rooting for you?

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:37.360
Hope you guys look forward to our 2016 S/S collection!

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:41.880
Ahh I have to start working right away..not sure what to do.

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:46.580
But I’ll try to do my best! This is what I am best at. Keep rooting for us! Thank you. 

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:51.760
Another group that highlights the 2015 F/W Seoul Fashion Week. 

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:56.300
Those who love fashion..the fashion people. 

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:00.020
There are people who try to capture these fashion people’s moments. 

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:01.080
Who are these people? 

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:08.180
YGK+’s ‘Visiting Seoul Fashion Week’ now presents you the street photographers! 

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:15.180
In DDP, the venue of the 2015 F/W Seoul Fashion Week, 

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:19.580
many fashion people who love fashion gathers. 

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:27.920
These fashion people express their uniqueness through their fashion and their confidence which is part of their charm. 

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:34.140
There are those who follow these fashion people. 

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:36.440
The street photographers.

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:45.400
Question- When did you start working as a street photographer? 

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:47.420
street photographer- I started at the end of 2012  

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:48.980
Question- Do you have any standards for selecting subjects? 

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:52.100
Naturalness. Being able to take natural photos is the biggest charm. 

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:59.340
Spreading of the photos is also natural..that’s why I take street photos

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:01.440
Question-What is the attraction of taking street photos?

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:05.400
believe best photos are taken when the subjects look natural

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:12.060
but unique (regardless of what they are wearing) I try to capture those subjects.  

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:13.780
Question- what’s the difference between Korean street photos and foreign street photos?

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:18.580
Street pictures taken in Korea are more monotonous compared to those taken abroad 

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:23.860
because the background scenery doesn’t change much here. 

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:27.740
But it’s interesting to observe theincreasing number of fashion zealots in Korea,

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:33.340
street photographers, and fashion people.  

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:39.620
Thanks to street photographers who capture fashion people’s style and essence,

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:45.360
fashion people’s lives are highlighted.  

00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:52.120
