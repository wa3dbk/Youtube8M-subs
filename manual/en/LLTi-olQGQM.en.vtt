Hi my name is Jesse Gram her in Tampa, Florida
on behalf of Expert Village. This is how to

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:12.320
to replace a maintain your air filter in a
motorcycle. In this step we will be replacing

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:17.931
a gas tank. I have my gas tank propped up.
Some may have it completely unattached from

00:00:17.931 --> 00:00:35.370
the bike. I simply pull off one bungee cord.
Now I just have to slide the gas tank down,

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:41.070
make sure tat none of my hoses are crimped.
You want to inspect them to make sure they

00:00:41.070 --> 00:01:00.130
are fully tight. Now drop the gas tank down.
And replace all the screws.

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:16.180
Start with the top center, make sure that
the gas tank is lined up. Now you want to

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:44.220
make sure to replace the medal bushings on
the side. You want to repeat for the other

00:01:44.220 --> 00:02:08.030
side as well. There you have it.
