00:00:06.532 --> 00:00:09.615
(chill upbeat music)

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:15.610
- Florida is the kingdom
of fast motor boats.

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:16.850
This is where they were born,

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:19.280
where the first speed
records were established,

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:22.200
and when many championships
have taken place.

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.180
It's seem that the origins of all this,

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:26.140
lay in illegal trafficking

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:29.160
and fast boats were built
to outrun the police.

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.630
It's possible that the
skills and experience

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:33.680
to build really fast boats

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:35.760
could of derived from this.

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.010
At the time, they might of even been

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.521
the fastest boats in the world.

00:00:40.521 --> 00:00:44.021
(upbeat electronic music)

00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:47.760
Today we're in Ventura, Florida

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.010
to try out a boat that
was built by a shipyard

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.220
that is considered iconic in the world

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:53.850
of powerful motor boats.

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:56.330
I'm not only referring to
the power of the engines

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:58.840
but also the performance of the haul.

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.080
It is a boat that was
built to go very fast

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:03.490
and dominate the sea
even in rough conditions,

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:06.163
like all other models in
the Magnum Marine series.

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:15.750
Needless to say, this is
the kind of boat I prefer.

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.110
Of course, I'd like to own a large yacht,

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:20.710
a powerful fishermen
boat, a luxurious lobster

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:22.140
or a comfortable troller.

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:24.490
However, a motor boat this fast

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:26.953
in a place like this is irresistible.

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:39.480
In 1966, in these waters,
the Magnum brand was born.

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:42.190
This is where they developed,
where the won many races

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:45.390
and established new world
records that are still standing.

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.020
I remember a race that took place in 1998

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:49.850
from Venice to Monte Carlo,

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:54.220
which basically goes all the
way around Italy, 1002 miles.

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:56.730
And during the competition
in rough conditions,

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:59.170
a Magnum 60 was unbeatable.

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:02.050
This is what it means to
create a powerful motor boat.

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:04.080
A boat that is capable of navigating

00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.090
even in conditions that
are very difficult.

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:10.173
(chill upbeat music)

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.060
This is the Magnum 51 Bestia

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:17.820
and this particular model has been fitted

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:22.690
with two 10 cylinder MTU
engines of 1600 horsepower each,

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:26.203
with Arneson propulsion and
roller surface propellers.

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:32.780
The shipyards that have racing experience

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:34.050
know exactly what they need

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:37.170
to start to begin designing a racing boat.

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:38.850
The engine room.

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:42.310
It is very important to allow
a lot of fresh air inside.

00:02:42.310 --> 00:02:44.070
Not only to cool the engines,

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:46.560
but also to supply the combustion chamber

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.630
with plenty of oxygen.

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:50.260
This is what Magnum has done.

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.220
They built air vents into the floor deck

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:54.790
that directs a lot of
air into the engine room,

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:57.193
particularly when the
boat is going very fast.

00:03:03.280 --> 00:03:05.250
When you drive a boat as fast as this,

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:07.480
you always need to take
care of the passengers

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:08.690
that might not be used to the

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:10.800
oscillations of a nautical vessel,

00:03:10.800 --> 00:03:12.720
that not only moves left and right

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:15.200
and back and forth, much like a car does,

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.640
but also a vertical
acceleration and deceleration

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:21.973
due to continuous take offs
and landings on the waves.

00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:25.680
This is why you always need to insure

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:29.370
that the maximum comfort and
security for the passengers,

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:31.643
for example, with a sofa like this.

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:39.930
Magnum Marine has a lot of experience

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:41.900
building surface propulsion systems

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:44.020
and started using them almost immediately

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:45.940
after they've been invented.

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:48.080
However, to learn how to drive this boat,

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:51.510
you need to pay attention to
a few fundamental controls.

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:54.253
The flaps and of course,
the surface propulsion trim.

00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:59.400
During the starting procedure,

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:01.120
it is recommended to bring the flaps

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:03.130
to their lowest possible position

00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:04.710
and lift the surface propellers

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:07.460
so that they can ventilate
the engine sufficiently

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:09.360
without flooding them with too much air

00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:11.740
that would prevent them
from gaining speed.

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:14.823
(chill upbeat music)

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:26.660
Once the boat is planing,

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:28.730
the surface propulsion system is lowered

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:31.330
so that the propellers have
better contact in the water

00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:33.253
and perform a lot more efficiently.

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:37.470
At the same time, the flaps are raised

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:40.000
to avoid causing any drag.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.660
This is how we can efficiently gain speed,

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:46.530
46 miles an hour at 1800 revs per minute.

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:48.030
An excellent cruising speed

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:50.843
and it isn't very loud
for a boat this powerful.

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:55.720
85 dB is a reading that is considered

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:58.360
acoustically comfortable
on board a motor boat

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:00.260
and we have the same reading

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.150
with cruising at 46 miles an hour,

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:03.813
which is an excellent result.

00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:13.820
Another incredible characteristic
of this propulsion system

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:16.360
is the reactivity Magnum
has managed to deliver

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:18.130
when the boat is turning.

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:19.880
Just look at the lateral angle

00:05:20.770 --> 00:05:22.850
and it keeps it's heading very well.

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:24.850
This is thanks to the propulsion system,

00:05:24.850 --> 00:05:26.410
not just the deep haul,

00:05:26.410 --> 00:05:28.340
even though Magnum hauls have an angle

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:30.550
of 24 degrees to the transom,

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:32.053
which make them very unique.

00:05:34.590 --> 00:05:36.930
Now let's test its maximum speed.

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:38.593
The sea conditions are all right.

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:42.980
We can raise the surface
propulsion system very high

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:45.370
and bring them to a point
where they are practically

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:48.560
half emersed and half out of the water,

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:51.500
in order to impose the
minimum amount of drag

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:54.133
and provide the maximum amount of thrust.

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:59.790
This is a good reading,
62.8 miles an hour.

00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:02.940
We're at 2400 revs per minute.

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:04.857
The boat is handling very well.

00:06:04.857 --> 00:06:07.940
(chill upbeat music)

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:20.000
They are many boats that
can go as fast as this one

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.890
but very few that are this
wide, comfortable, and secure.

00:06:23.890 --> 00:06:27.200
Magnum Marine is not only an
icon in the motor boat world,

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:29.833
but also a product that is extraordinary.
