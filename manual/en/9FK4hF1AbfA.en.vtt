Hello everyone!

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:10.740
This is Joao from Kenhub, and welcome to another
tutorial where, this time, I'm going to be

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:16.960
talking about the gluteal muscles that we're
going to be looking at right now on your screen.

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:22.920
And these are muscles that you find on your
buttocks region, and on this tutorial, I will

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:28.169
help you learn and understand the anatomy
and functions of the gluteal muscles.

00:00:28.169 --> 00:00:33.140
Now, before we move forward, I want to just
describe a little bit of what you're seeing

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:34.920
here on your image.

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:40.829
We're looking at the posterior or dorsal view
of the bony pelvis right here, and you can

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.879
see the group of muscles that we're going
to be discussing on this tutorial, right about

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:46.879
here.

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:49.170
And these are the right gluteal muscles.

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.359
You would, of course, have the same here on
the left side.

00:00:54.359 --> 00:01:00.059
And you can see a little bit of the femur
here projected inferiorly on the image here.

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.640
Now, keep in mind that, now, I'm going to
be adding another set of muscles known as...

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:10.930
