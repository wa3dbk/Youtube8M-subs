Hello, everybody!

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
electric acoustic guitar

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.500
The body top of this guitar is made of spruce,

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
back and sides are made of Asian hardwood,

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:30.000
the neck is made of mahogany,
the fretboard is made of bombay blackwood

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.000
and the bridge is of bombay blackwood too.

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.000
This guitar has an active
preamp with 4-band equalizer,

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.000
handy tuner and battery indicator.

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:43.000
The guitar shipped with this
great black gig bag.

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.500
This guitar is perfect for live performances

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.000
because it doesn't have a sound hole,
so it won't make a feedback noise.

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:54.000
Also, this guitar has a narrow body.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.500
