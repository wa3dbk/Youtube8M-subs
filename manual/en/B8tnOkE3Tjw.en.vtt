Hey Expert Villagers, did you ever hear of
Sun Studios? I have been there, in Memphis.

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:12.440
It's very famous. That's where all of the
biggies started. Elvis, you know, all the

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:18.660
famous, famous Elvis period. Johnny Cash recorded
at Sun Records. Now, it's really cool if you

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:25.920
can find records that are recorded on the
Sun label because that means that they are

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:31.539
older because the Sun label doesn't exist
anymore. So that's an obvious one for you.

00:00:31.539 --> 00:00:36.640
Also, if you take a look at this album and
just see, you know, the visual. Some people

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:40.719
collect record albums just because they look
so great. I mean, look at this visual of Johnny

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:45.030
Cash as a young man. And of course, when they
made the movie, that gave a resurgence to

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:50.550
the value of these albums. But, this is a
Sun record album. That's the Sun logo which

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:57.800
is very, very cool. That has not changed over
time. This one is a product of Memphis Sun

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:05.059
and it's a thirty-three RPM micro-groove which
also shows that it is very old. This is one

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:09.250
in exceptional condition. I want you to see
that there aren't any scratches. Because with

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:13.560
record players, some of you may not even know
what a record player is, but for those of

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.300
us that do: record players basically had needles,
and if you were really careful to put your

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:22.140
needle on the groove, you were okay. It stayed
in the groove. It's kind of like bowling and

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.910
a gutter ball. You want to to keep it in the
gutter of these record grooves. So, when it

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:35.560
strays, scratch, it's not good. It sounds
scratchy. So this is an album that you would

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:40.450
look at and also take this record guide. Take
a look and you look at this Johnny Cash album

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:44.060
on Sun. Then you would look at the record
number and you would see what pressing it

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:48.350
is. Then you would be able to date the album
and then you would be able to determine how

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:53.770
much it is worth. This particular album is
worth (in the book) probably about one hundred

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:58.100
dollars. But, as I said, those book prices
are just a guide. You really couldn't get

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.010
that much for this album. You'd be lucky to
get about thirty-five or forty-five dollars

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:05.880
for this album. But it is a beautiful album
and it is in wonderful condition. It's an

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.530
album that a record collector would really
like to have and it's affordable. You still

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:12.730
may find these out there, so look. Records
are great finds!
