00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:07.259
cars dot com auto review I'm Joe Weisenfelder with cars dot com were

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:11.670
here with USA today and motor week for a
shootout test among seven subcompact

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:12.830
cars all priced

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:18.119
under sixteen thousand dollar competing
where the Chevrolet Sonic the Ford

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:18.930
Fiesta

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.189
the Honda Fit the Hyundai Accent the
Kia Rio

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.240
the Nissan Versa and the Toyota Yaris

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:31.810
let's take a look at the top three in
third place in the 2012 Hyundai Accent

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:32.820
GS hatchback

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:36.590
as we expect from Hyundai the accent is
packed with features including power

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:37.989
windows locks and mirrors

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:42.450
a USB port and a driver seat height
adjustment not one of which was a

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:43.850
foregone conclusion in this

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:47.030
that as we've come to expect from
Hyundai more recently

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:51.020
the interior's higher quality a few of
our editors took issue with clear

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:52.260
visibility however

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:55.629
perhaps a downside of the cars personal
hatchback body style

00:00:55.629 --> 00:00:59.100
behind the wheel the accent was
surprisingly happy with well be a

00:00:59.100 --> 00:00:59.980
transmission

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:03.129
upscale standard features played a part
here too in the former this

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:06.390
rear breakthroughs in thought was
evident in its strong linear breaking

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.760
characteristic of our top performers the
action is a well-rounded machine

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:16.210
in second place at the 2012 Kia Rio LX
sedan

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:20.650
he is showing as no surprise because the
corporate sibling a third-place Hyundai

00:01:20.650 --> 00:01:23.299
Accent and as such it shares many
components

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:26.630
as well as an emphasis on generous
standard equipment and the same or be

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:27.130
coverage

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:31.960
the longest been archived the reels many
extras included sliding sunvisors with

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:32.409
mir

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:36.360
power locks which is on both front doors
and the only steering wheel base audio

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.759
controls and the whole time though its
materials and textures are more

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:41.119
conservative than the actor

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:45.100
the real scavengers rate for myself but
for Quality Inn layup

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.530
the reels driving experience also
compared to the Hyundai's

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:51.829
with good marks for its acceleration and
criticism for its steering

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:55.710
the lawyers was likewise the problem the
real seen better in comparison

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.770
perhaps because it has the dan rather
than a hatchback the body style help the

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:01.299
real back in one regard

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:05.820
trying could match the utility of our
other top performer and finally the

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.160
winner of the subcompact car shoot up by
a comfortable margin

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:13.220
is the 2012 Honda them the first chapter
in this hatchback

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:17.020
story is one of ruinous especially cargo
capacity and versatility

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:21.020
the lift gate is a story to a large part
cargo area with rear seats that fold

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:23.640
down completely flat well can be raised

00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:27.030
to accommodate bulky items in the
backseat area leaving the cargo floor

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:28.560
behind them open for business

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.890
does the driving experience suffer
because of all the futility

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.970
absolutely not but that begs to be
driven hard from the first moment in our

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:39.319
base model is it had left the closing
occurs in the more expensive sport

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:39.980
version it

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:43.870
it was still one of the best handlers in
the shootout it rides Burnley overall

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:45.000
but not uncomfortably

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.569
and definitely better than this the
sport the drive train was also a crowd

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:52.560
pleaser with his no nonsense
transmission and a capable engine that

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.280
certainly audible like the others

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.290
but as a smoother left grating sound the
Fed has its downsides so

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:01.879
most of them a static by contemporary
standards the cabin materials

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:05.959
art up the not the upholstery is a
throwback to the Lord a visit from the

00:03:05.959 --> 00:03:07.870
technology is also showing its age

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:12.060
understandably so the fit was last
updated in 2009

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:16.050
that six competitors were introduced a
fully redesigned for the 2011 or 2012

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.989
model year

00:03:16.989 --> 00:03:21.940
and yet near the fit is at the top of
the pack the Honda Fit is a triumph for

00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:22.670
packaging

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:26.849
a small car the provide ample cabinet
space generous Carter room versatility

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:31.120
and the best rated visibility in the
shootout and fun to drive to

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:35.099
sounds like a winner up

00:03:35.099 --> 00:03:38.510

details got a car back up
