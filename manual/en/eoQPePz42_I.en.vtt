00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:18.220
43 points to 35 the Buxton Hitmen lead: a
good margin for them on the afternoon, and

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:23.570
now it would need 5-1s in each of the last
two heats if the Mildenhall Fen Tigers could

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:29.200
salvage some pride and a draw here this afternoon.
It’s a big ask, because once again Rob Branford

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:34.829
the in form number seven reserve for the Buxton
Hitmen comes out in this one, he’s off the

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:40.310
outside start position. Luke Priest and Joe
Jacobs for the Mildenhall Fen Tigers, they’ve

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:45.939
scored solidly, but no race wins between them,
and they would have to finish first and second

00:00:45.939 --> 00:00:49.939
to give the Mildenhall Fen Tigers a chance
of a draw on the afternoon.

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:52.460
So, as we look across the tapes then, off
the inside start position it is Joe Jacobs

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:57.710
off gate number one, next to him off gate
two it is Charles Wright, off gate three it

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.300
is Luke Priest for the Mildenhall Fen Tigers,
and off the outside it is Rob Branford.

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:05.300
Some movement at the start but it looked off
gate two as though Charles Wright moved at

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:08.770
the startline and the red lights have come
straight on, the referee not allowing that

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:14.030
to continue. We’ll look again at the start
for any movement. In fact Luke Priest was

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:16.780
moving off gate three as well by the looks
of it, so two riders moving at the startline

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:22.030
there, and the referee has to pull them back
because Wright gained a large margin by moving

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:27.030
at the start the way he did – it was looking
like he was on his way to bend one first.

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:37.890
Will he be so again in the restart? We’ll
find out in just a few moments’ time.

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.690
Four riders into line for this one, then,
heat number fourteen. Off the inside start

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:50.880
position Joe Jacobs, next to him Charles Wright.
The riders just being warned there about movement

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:55.450
at the startline, with Charles Wright and
Luke Priest both taking rolls at the start

00:01:55.450 --> 00:02:02.060
of that one. The tension really builds ahead
of heat 14, some movement at the start will

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.600
only add, with the restart adding to the tension,
so it wouldn’t be a surprise to see more

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.520
again in the restart of heat number fourteen.

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.090
Rob Branford off the outside start position
completes the line-up.

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:16.470
Who will take this heat number fourteen? It’s
a good start from the inside from Joe Jacobs,

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:20.069
but around the outside comes Rob Branford,
and Luke Priest wasn’t forceful enough coming

00:02:20.069 --> 00:02:24.700
out of bend two and that gives a line to Rob
Branford, although Luke Priest has now claimed

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.750
the position and locks back to the inside.

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:30.340
Coming out of bend four Joe Jacobs looks close,
and Charles Wright gets around the outside.

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:35.340
And now Priest has run too wide coming out
of bend two and Branford comes up the inside,

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:40.610
now Charles Wright dives through for an attack.
So, from going from a Mildenhall heat advantage,

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:46.459
the Buxton Hitmen have turned the tables:
coming out of bend four for the first time

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:49.830
Joe Jacobs got stuck behind his own teammate
Luke Priest who was locking back to the inside

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:54.959
to block Rob Branford, and through around
the outside came Charles Wright – through

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:57.959
into third place. And then on bends one and
two Luke Priest just ran a little too wide,

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:00.520
and Rob Branford seized the opportunity up
the inside.

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:03.000
And now Charles Wright gets very close. Around
bends three and four Charles Wright dives

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.770
for the grip and dives for the speed, and
he can’t find anything at present, looks

00:03:07.770 --> 00:03:10.370
for a little extra coming down to the line!
It gets very close.

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:17.220
Goodness me what a race that was in heat number
fourteen. You wouldn’t know that the aggregate

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:20.470
score is all that matters here this afternoon
and that the Buxton Hitmen have already done

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:27.720
the job, the Hitmen qualifying. And here we
are at heat 14, the gap is eight points, and

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:31.959
they’re still fighting as if it were heat
number one! A brilliant race there: Branford

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:38.959
gets through from the back to take the victory,
second place for Luke Priest, and back in

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:42.140
third Charles Wright really giving it his
all to the very finish line. I can confirm

00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:47.819
that Priest gets the second place there, but
Charles Wright got very close on the line

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:49.069
there.

00:03:49.069 --> 00:03:51.050
We’ll see it again: the opening lap this
is, with Luke Priest locking back to the inside,

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:55.280
blocking out the challenge of Rob Branford,
but that in turn slows down Joe Jacobs, and

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:59.540
Charles Wright gets around the outside and
through into third place. Out in front though,

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:04.480
Priest is still holding on at present. Branford
does manage to get through up the inside coming

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:09.129
out of bend number two for the second time,
with Priest leaving too much of a gap. And

00:04:09.129 --> 00:04:12.870
Wright is hooking it up around the outside
as Priest looks for the blue groove that has

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:17.859
developed around the inside, and Wright gets
a great deal of speed on bends three and four,

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:22.569
zips around the outside. And we may see just
how close it gets. Wright really trying very

00:04:22.569 --> 00:04:26.520
hard – at this point he looks dead and buried,
but Priest locking up on the inside trying

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:31.500
to hook up on that blue groove, and does block
the line there as Wright just squeezes through

00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:35.630
and tries to get there on the line, but Priest
just about holds on. What an excellent race.
