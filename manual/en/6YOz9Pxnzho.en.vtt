00:00:03.669 --> 00:00:08.890
When I was outside on my first space walk,
I was on the dark side of the world over the

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:15.010
Indian Ocean and I shut off all the lights
in my suit to let my eyes adjust.

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:21.210
And as I came south of Australia in the darkness,
we drove through the southern lights and they

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.410
were like pouring underneath my feet and you
could see all the colors of it and, I mean,

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:31.590
I had seen aurora from on the surface of the
earth, but to be amongst them, to actually

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:36.899
directly be part of that interaction between
the sun and the atmosphere and the magnetic

00:00:36.899 --> 00:00:42.530
field all right there visually like a prism
or a rainbow or something, that was a real

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:47.749
reality check of how it is all related and
how the energy of the sun and the protection

00:00:47.749 --> 00:00:52.550
of the atmosphere and the focus of the magnetic
field all work together.

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:54.609
It really showed me that this is a system.

00:00:54.609 --> 00:00:56.269
This is a planetary system.

00:00:56.269 --> 00:00:57.940
This goes on all the time.

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:01.670
Most of the time, though, we just don’t
see it, but this is going on constantly, all

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:04.750
the time, how all those things work together.

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:07.280
From orbit you get that type or perspective.

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:12.159
You see the fact that this is a complicated
system that is subject to a lot of influences,

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:15.240
that is going on all the time.

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.960
One of the influences that is affecting earth
itself, of course, is the beings that are

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:21.960
living on it.

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.350
Volcanoes erupting, but also the plant life
and the animal life.

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:32.520
And over the last 100 years, I mean, gosh,
our numbers have rocketed until seven billion

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.829
of us are ell simultaneously exhaling and
eating and turning on our lights in our house

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:40.200
and starting up the engines in our cars.

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.270
Obviously that has an effect on the planet
in amongst all those other things happening.

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.799
You can see some of those effects from space.

00:01:46.799 --> 00:01:48.460
You can see with your naked eye.

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:54.759
If you come across Mexico City or Beijing,
the pollution is visible from space.

00:01:54.759 --> 00:02:00.329
It is like a grey, ugly smear on the surface
of the world.

00:02:00.329 --> 00:02:03.149
That this man made local climate change.

00:02:03.149 --> 00:02:05.219
If you come across Asia...

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:08.830
On my very first flight there was a big inland
sea, the Aral Sea.

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:13.180
It was still a relatively healthy body of
water back in the early 90s.

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:20.319
But over the last 20 years, because of agricultural
policies and irrigation policies, the Aral

00:02:20.319 --> 00:02:24.849
Sea has gone from being the fourth biggest
sea on earth, to being virtually non-existent.

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:27.180
It is dried up.

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.459
And we did it on purpose as a species.

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:34.879
We made a conscious decision to allow the
fourth biggest sea in the world to turn into

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:37.409
a little stinking puddle.

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:43.439
What used to be a shore line is now empty
sand and the remains of the fertilizer that

00:02:43.439 --> 00:02:45.900
were drained into that sea for decades.

00:02:45.900 --> 00:02:50.010
We are obviously changing the climate at a
global level.

00:02:50.010 --> 00:02:54.650
The key is: Who is going to be the person
that is going to decide to change something?

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:59.430
We can’t wait for some other person to change
it.

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.909
They don’t have the imperative to do it,
especially if they are someone that we elected.

00:03:03.909 --> 00:03:08.159
If we elected, they are just our representative
and the real motivation comes to each of us

00:03:08.159 --> 00:03:09.579
individually.

00:03:09.579 --> 00:03:11.670
That is who has to make the change.

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:15.180
You can’t say they or him or her or it.

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:19.420
It is us or me or I that has to make the change.

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:22.959
And it is not going to be perfect and it is
going to have to get a little bit critical

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:27.110
before people are truly going to feel enough
pain or enough compunction to actually change

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:28.909
what they are doing.

00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:31.900
And things are going to get worse before they
get better.

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:35.930
But I am confident this isn’t the end of
the world.

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:40.720
This is just a problem that we are facing
that is going to change things, but we are

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.579
going to have to figure out a way to deal
with it.

00:03:43.579 --> 00:03:47.939
&gt;&gt; I am just...

00:03:47.939 --> 00:03:49.829
&gt;&gt; Got enough light?

00:03:49.829 --> 00:03:52.230
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I am wondering if the sun is setting
on us there.

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:53.439
&gt;&gt; We can turn...

00:03:53.439 --> 00:03:54.439
&gt;&gt; I...

00:03:54.439 --> 00:03:57.590
&gt;&gt; The sun is not only setting on us.
