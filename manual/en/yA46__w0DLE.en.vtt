Hi, Dr. Mark Burhenne here of AsktheDentist.com. 

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:15.933
So, here’s a burning question for you. 

00:00:15.933 --> 00:00:20.566
Should you be discussing oral sex with your 
dentist? 

00:00:20.566 --> 00:00:22.099
I know that’s a little bit of a shock 

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:24.733
and maybe a little uncomfortable for you to mention to your dentist, 

00:00:24.733 --> 00:00:27.399
but I would recommend that you have that 
conversation. 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:32.733
The reason is this. HPV, the human papillomavirus 
now supercedes

00:00:32.733 --> 00:00:35.899
 or is now the main cause for oral cancer. 

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:38.033
It used to be, back when I was in dental school

00:00:38.033 --> 00:00:41.399
we were training how to identify the high risk group

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:46.200
—pretty easy to do, the people that chew tobacco, the smokers and the heavy drinkers. 

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.000
But now, it’s the people that have had

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.433
—according to some researchers,

00:00:52.433 --> 00:00:56.499
it’s the people that have had oral sex  with more than 20 partners. 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.633
Again, this is a line drawn in the sand by 
researchers. 

00:00:59.633 --> 00:01:02.366
It’s something you have to figure out for yourself. 

00:01:02.366 --> 00:01:08.199
But talk to your dentist about the connection 
and how it can cause oral cancer. 

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.300
It’s a serious thing. 

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:12.333
And if it is not caught early, it can kill you.

00:01:13.766 --> 00:01:16.466
So, the dentist can do an oral cancer exam. 

00:01:16.466 --> 00:01:18.066
We’re trained to do it. 

00:01:18.066 --> 00:01:22.166
Unfortunately, I don’t think it is possible to get a complete oral cancer exam

00:01:22.166 --> 00:01:23.666
at the dental office. 

00:01:23.666 --> 00:01:29.732
I think the better exam, if you’re a patient that 
needs to have this done, 

00:01:29.733 --> 00:01:31.999
would be at the ENT, the ear, nose and throat. 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.933
They would basically get your nose or throat numb 

00:01:34.933 --> 00:01:38.066
and send a camera down there and take a really, really good look

00:01:38.066 --> 00:01:40.766
because that’s where a lot of this cancer is found

00:01:40.766 --> 00:01:42.966
—at the base of the tongue, the oropharynx, 

00:01:42.966 --> 00:01:48.932
I mean tissues and anatomical parts of the throat 
that can get cancer. 

00:01:48.933 --> 00:01:50.866
And I can’t see that as a dentist.

00:01:50.866 --> 00:01:52.599
So, I think it’s a false sense of security 

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.833
that you think your dentist is giving an oral cancer exam every six months

00:01:56.833 --> 00:01:57.899
and that you’re fine.

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:01.333
So, have this conversation with your dentist, find 
out more about it. 

00:02:01.333 --> 00:02:06.666
There is one other test which I am beginning to think needs to be routine. 

00:02:06.666 --> 00:02:09.366
And that is the test that you order out.

00:02:09.366 --> 00:02:10.732
Your dentist brings it to you. 

00:02:10.733 --> 00:02:16.766
You create some saliva in your mouth, swish into 
it, and spit into a test tube, 

00:02:16.766 --> 00:02:18.132
and it gets sent off. 

00:02:18.133 --> 00:02:21.133
And that is like a blood test essentially. 

00:02:21.133 --> 00:02:23.499
It’s looking for a marker for this cancer. 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.566
And I think that’s something you should consider. 

00:02:25.566 --> 00:02:27.932
So, if you think that you’ve had

00:02:27.933 --> 00:02:31.833
—and again, this is the line drawn in the sand by some Harvard researchers—

00:02:31.833 --> 00:02:37.833
if you think you’ve had oral sex with more than 20 partners, 

00:02:37.833 --> 00:02:40.433
 ask your dentist about this test and have it done. 

00:02:40.433 --> 00:02:41.666
And this will give you some peace of mind. 

00:02:41.666 --> 00:02:45.532
So, in conclusion, have a discussion about oral 
sex with your dentist. 

00:02:45.533 --> 00:02:46.699
It may save your life.
