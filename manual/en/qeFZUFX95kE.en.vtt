00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
So you're probably wondering...

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:04.160
Why is he sitting down?

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:06.620
I recently hurt my ankle playing in a pickup game in basketball

00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:12.720
You pick it up!

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:13.220
You!

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:14.560
No, but I really did hurt my ankle.

00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:16.980
Actually, I can probably do this standing up but I'm just being a little bit...

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:17.640
[GASP!]

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:18.620
He swore!

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:20.620
No, I was just talking about my dog...

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:23.580
Who is a boy.

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:25.580
Oh my god I swore!!

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:28.360
Hey guys!

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:31.980
So today I'm going to be talking that my get me a lot of angry letters from parents

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:35.620
Obviously not that kind of letters

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:38.220
That's... Better?

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.120
I'm gonna be talking about something that has been bothering me since I was a little kid.

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:41.640
And I don't know about you.

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:42.280
Maybe it's just me.

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:45.060
But I always thought censorship is so stupid

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:46.780
And I censor myself all the f***in' time.

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:49.580
But it's not because I think that cursing is bad or it's going to hurt someone.

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:52.660
It's because my parents and society tell me that it's a bad thing to say.

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:53.400
And don't get me wrong.

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.400
I'm not one to swear a lot in real life, anyways.

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:56.400
But, like, almost everyone else...

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:57.480
Sometimes, I can't help it.

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.060
Mother... Fff

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:04.060
Father that hurts!

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:06.780
H-Holy... SHHH

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.780
PIRIT! That was close!

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:11.080
[Door hits lamp]

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:12.780
[Lamp hits ground]

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.440
Son of a...

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:15.720
Bad luck!

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:16.540
Man!

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:22.760
What the f*** you looking at?

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:23.440
Think about it.

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:26.300
How is a word, which in reality is just a sound, hurting anyone?

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:27.660
If it's the meaning behind the word...

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:29.900
Then why is it socially acceptable to say the word hate...

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.820
When you can't say the word, F***?

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:34.180
See?! I hate that I can't even say that out of context!!

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:36.460
You know when you were little kid and you went home crying?

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:38.260
It's not because somebody said a "bad word."

00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:39.600
You cried because they said...

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.580
"I don't want to play with you anymore. You're ugly!"

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:44.980
What? That didn't happen to you guys?

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:47.300
And then when you go to your parents and tell them what happens, they tell you...

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:48.260
"Well, you know, son."

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:52.140
"Sticks and stones may break your bones, but words may never hurt you."

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.520
If our parents taught us this...

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.600
then why are we allowed as kids to play with sticks and stones...

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:56.660
but if we tell our dads...

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:57.920
"F*** you, dad!"

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.340
Then you know what happens next, right?

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.880
Dad grabs the sticks and stones and beats the sh*t out of you!

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:03.560
That didn't happened to you guys, either?

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.760
If I ever become a parent, I'm not gonna to censor much.

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:06.860
If my child questions me...

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.440
"Dad? Where do babies come from?"

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:10.180
"A vagina."

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:10.680
"Ohhh."

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:11.680
I'm gonna be honest!

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:12.660
Is he hurt from that?!

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.160
NOO!!!

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.280
If anything, he's now smarter than the kid that got lied to.

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.640
"Dad? Where do babies come from?"

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.480
"Well, son, when a man loves a woman, the stork delivers a baby to you."

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:22.320
HUUUUH!!

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.060
That means I'm adopted.

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.000
And I'm part stork.

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.160
Which means I can FLY!

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:31.500
Is that what you want?!

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:32.640
Censorship kills kids!!

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:33.460
HA! Just kidding.

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:33.960
But, seriously.

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:35.200
Censorship makes no sense!

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:36.780
And I'm not just talking about cursing and swearing.

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:37.760
ALL CENSORSHIP!

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.240
Like why is a movie rated R when it has sex and cursing in it

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.740
And...

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:42.960
In PG-13, where there's killing and explosions

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:46.320
And why is ok for women to take pictures in bathing suits but when it comes to underwear, it's inappropriate.

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:49.540
Why is ok for us to see man boobs but when it comes to women, we have to censor them?

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:50.160
What's the difference?

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.000
Is it just because one produces milk and the other one doesn't?

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.520
In that case, shouldn't we censor all the cows?!

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.320
They're basically, like, four-legged boobs

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.120
walking around eating all the f***ing grass!

00:02:57.680 --> 00:02:58.220
Sorry

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:59.420
That was just my tipping point

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:00.080
He he. Get it?

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:00.580
Tipping point?

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:01.100
Cows?

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:01.640
Cow Tipping?

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:03.580
Anyway...

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:06.780
I'm not asking for there to be changes because I don't mind living by these rules

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:09.040
But I was just curious to see if anyone else felt the same way

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:14.120
Because this is something that's been bothering me for a long time and it just feels good to get off my chest

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:15.380
I DON'T NEED A CENSOR!!

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:16.540
I DON'T HAVE BOOBS!!

00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:18.820
Oh...

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:20.820
BAAAAAA!!

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:21.624
TEEHEE!!
