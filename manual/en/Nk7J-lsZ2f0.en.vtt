00:00:01.050 --> 00:00:07.070
This handy device
filters out 99.9999%

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:09.040
of waterborne bacteria.

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:11.880
That means pretty much
any type of water source

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.630
is now safe to drink.

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:15.020
We'll see about that.

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:17.381
This is the LifeStraw Challenge.

00:00:17.381 --> 00:00:18.363
Let's go.

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.130
We're in the sewer.

00:00:24.130 --> 00:00:26.365
Let's get at it.

00:00:26.365 --> 00:00:28.345
Ho, sewer water.

00:00:28.345 --> 00:00:31.810
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:36.265 --> 00:00:37.255
Tastes good.

00:00:40.225 --> 00:00:41.710
The Mighty Mississippi.

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:54.330
Ah, Sunny Mississippi.

00:01:07.343 --> 00:01:09.275
It tastes like water.

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.230
OK, so this is about
the grossest thing

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:18.538
we could come up with that's
still relatively safe.

00:01:18.538 --> 00:01:20.770
[COUGHING]

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:23.868
Just touch your stomach.

00:01:23.868 --> 00:01:25.326
[COUGHING]

00:01:25.326 --> 00:01:28.660
I might need something longer
to stick down my throat.

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:30.560
[COUGHING]

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:31.060
[INAUDIBLE]

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:39.994
It's so thick, you can't get it.

00:01:39.994 --> 00:01:43.070
Ooh, that's water there.

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:44.194
It's pretty good.

00:01:44.194 --> 00:01:47.340
All right, one more sip.

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:50.850
Mm, LifeStraw is pretty good.

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.850
Well, that was
fairly disgusting.

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:54.530
But I'm feeling pretty good.

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:57.680
However, I didn't have to
drink all of that filth.

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:58.840
I chose to.

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.040
A lot of people across the
world don't have that luxury.

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.090
And that's why the
LifeStraw was created.

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.060
In fact, with every
purchase of a LifeStraw,

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:10.050
a year's worth of fresh
water is donated to a child

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.530
in a developing country.

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:14.685
