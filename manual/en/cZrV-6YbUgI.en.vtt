"I think passion is an important part of the
company and it's an integral piece of fabric

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.090
woven into our structure.

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:21.610
Congratulations -- 2012 Member Leadership
Award Winner for Passion -- Chris Sugai

00:00:21.610 --> 00:00:26.170
Chris Sugai is President of Niner Bikes.

00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:35.950
He is credited with inspiring and leading
an industry wide change to 29 inch wheels

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:37.900
for mountain bikes.

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:42.480
"I'm avid mountain bike rider and I'm always
experimenting with new equipment and always

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.120
like to tinker with my bikes.

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:51.190
I started riding this new type of bikes in
2004 called 29ers where the wheels are a little

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:52.190
larger.

00:00:52.190 --> 00:01:00.079
After my second or third ride, I had an "Ah-ha!"
moment of how much better the performance

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:03.950
of the bike was compared to the other bikes
that I had.

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:06.640
I knew this would be the path that I should
take.

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:07.640
"

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:12.040
"75% of all mountain bikes being sold in the
US market are 29ers so the change has been

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:13.040
dramatic.

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:17.049
Our first year of sales was $98,000.

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:22.149
We're closing up 2012 and were going to be
right around $14 million dollars in sales.

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:23.149
"

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:25.109
"Hiring key players is a cornerstone of Niner.

00:01:25.109 --> 00:01:30.710
We currently have 27 employees in the company
and I can say truthfully that every single

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:34.310
person is a passionate cyclist and is also
an "A" player.

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:35.310
"

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:42.069
"I think the one thing, when you're the CEO
and managing a company, is to be authentic

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:47.149
and showing the rest of the employees and
staff in the company that I ride and love

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:48.460
it just as much as they do.

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:52.219
They see it, they see me traveling and riding
different areas of the country.

00:01:52.219 --> 00:01:55.899
They see me geeking-out when a new part comes
out and getting really excited about small

00:01:55.899 --> 00:01:58.520
changes that are made within our designs.

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:03.249
They see that and feed of it that and know
that the person calling some of the shots

00:02:03.249 --> 00:02:05.659
has a very vested interest in what's going
on. "
