00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:08.029
Our goal at VHS

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:12.089
is to develop courses that really
inspire our students, that ignite a passion

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.730
for learning and that develop their
knowledge base and their critical

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:18.529
thinking skills but in really
meaningful ways

00:00:18.529 --> 00:00:22.140
so they can be productive, global
citizens

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.980
in a digital age.  It is important to us that
our VHS students

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:30.320
succeed in college and beyond in the
workplace

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:34.140
and so we focus on three main areas: first

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.149
we focus on high-quality courses, second

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:41.649
our teachers who are outstanding, and third

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:45.180
we focus on collaboration and bringing
collaborative learning

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.350
into our online courses.  VHS students
come from places all over the globe

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:54.300
I've had students in my courses from
China, from Australia,

00:00:54.300 --> 00:00:57.329
from Columbia, from the West Coast, the
Midwest,

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:01.469
and on the East Coast as well.  These
students get the experience

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.350
of having all of this cultural knowledge
at their fingertips

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:09.010
and that gives them a much better and
deeper learning experience.

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:12.960
What's great about co-synchronous
learning is that students can check in

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.270
anytime it's convenient for them during
the week

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.200
and they can still carry on this group
conversation or this group project.

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.409
What's great is even though the 
distance separates them

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:27.020
and time might separate their posts, they 
can always take a break from what they're doing

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:30.549
come back to it with a fresh set of eyes
and a fresh set of

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:35.119
ideas to contribute to the conversation.
In cases like this sometimes discussions

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:37.329
can go on for an entire semester

00:01:37.329 --> 00:01:42.270
building and developing from topic to
topic.  The collaborative online web tools

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:44.329
that we use in our VHS courses

00:01:44.329 --> 00:01:48.259
enable students to really get beyond the
surface level of the topics they're

00:01:48.259 --> 00:01:49.130
discussing

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.490
and interact with one another to deepen
that learning.

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:56.850
Our VHS teachers are selected by our
member schools

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.369
and they're quality teachers who are
certified in

00:02:00.369 --> 00:02:04.680
their subject areas.  We take a lot of
pride in our training; it's not just a

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.990
few hour training and then let them
facilitate

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:11.879
but it is a multi-week rigorous

00:02:11.879 --> 00:02:16.340
graduate-level methodologies course
where they're working with a cohort of

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:17.360
other teachers

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.640
and they're learning about how to
facilitate discussions online, how to

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:22.900
build community,

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.360
how to provide insightful and meaningful
feedback

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:31.459
to really enhance the learning for their
students.  We also have site coordinators

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:33.200
on the ground at the schools

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:37.709
who work with the teachers to support
the students to make sure kids aren't

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:41.650
falling through the cracks and giving
students the support that they need to

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:42.319
succeed.

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:45.480
I think parents and educators trust VHS

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:48.790
because we share with them a commitment
to quality.

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:51.769
We're fully accredited, our
standards-based courses are

00:02:51.769 --> 00:02:52.910
award-winning,

00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:56.760
we have a high rate of completion in our
courses,

00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:59.989
and the AP pass rate

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:05.489
exceeds the national average.  So our 1) high
commitment to having quality courses,

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:09.180
2) highly trained teachers, 3) collaborative, vibrant,

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:12.200
online courses -- I really think that's the
VHS difference.
