00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:04.190
I am wearing Marmot’s men’s PreCip jacket.

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:10.480
The PreCip jacket gives you a waterproof,
breathable protection, a nice feature set

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:15.150
at an unbelievably affordable price point.

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:22.380
The PreCip jacket features Marmot’s propriety
nanopro waterproof breathable construction.

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:26.630
So you do have a high level of waterproof
protection.

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:28.460
All the seams are taped as well.

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:33.860
So, again, bolsters your confidence as a wearer
of that waterproof protection.

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:36.710
It is also highly breathable.

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:46.300
And the lining on this jacket is not so clammy
or sticky as I have found with older jackets

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.429
or kind of entry level jackets.

00:00:48.429 --> 00:00:55.039
There is a really nice comfort level there
and, again, while maintaining that waterproof,

00:00:55.039 --> 00:00:56.989
breathable protection.

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:04.120
Marmot does feature its angel wing construction,
angel wing movement in the PreCip jacket.

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:09.050
What that means is as you move, you know,
whether it is with a back pack or just, you

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:13.780
know, out for a walk, the jacket doesn’t
ride up on you as you move.

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:22.350
And that is often overlooked, I think, but
a really, really nice feature of this jacket.

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.200
Relaxed fit on this jacket, you certainly
would expect to be wearing it over layers

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.600
and there is room to do so.

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:36.830
In terms of adjustability in the jacket, you
do have some Velcro adjustment points here

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:37.870
on the sleeve.

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:44.700
And you can kind of lock that down to keep
the sleeves from being any more extended than

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:46.740
you would like them to be.

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:52.180
There is a single draw cord, a single pull
cord here at the side of the hem.

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:54.740
If you prefer to have that jacket pulled in.

00:01:54.740 --> 00:02:00.720
The really nice, sizable protective hood on
the PreCip jacket, a little bit of shaping

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.210
to the brim.

00:02:02.210 --> 00:02:08.520
Points of adjustability at the back of the
hood also at the sides, basically alongside

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:09.979
the chin.

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:17.319
Dry clime interior, a chin guard, so where
the front of the jacket beneath the hood there

00:02:17.319 --> 00:02:23.219
is hitting your chin it is comfortable in
a way that a jacket isn’t without that feature

00:02:23.219 --> 00:02:24.219
set.

00:02:24.219 --> 00:02:25.730
It is also a stowable hood.

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:30.780
I have seen that done on some jackets and
done in a so, so manner.

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:35.859
It is nicely done on the PreCip jackets so
when that hood is stowed the jacket doesn’t

00:02:35.859 --> 00:02:41.599
look awkward and you aren’t aware of this
bulk built up around the neck.

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:43.280
Well done on the PreCip jacket.

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.090
So you have tot the waterproof, breathable
construction.

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:48.769
We talked about the hood as well.

00:02:48.769 --> 00:02:53.139
This also has pit zips, some venting options.

00:02:53.139 --> 00:02:58.510
And a jacket that is only 13.1 ounces and
available at such an affordable price, that

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:00.969
is also a stand out feature.

00:03:00.969 --> 00:03:04.930
So with the pit zips what I am getting at
here is, you know, you are wearing the jacket.

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:09.370
If heat should build up, you are getting warm,
you have got the ability to go ahead and open

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:16.279
these side pit zips, these zippered vents
underneath the arms and allow that warm air

00:03:16.279 --> 00:03:17.640
to escape.

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:21.609
There is also pockets here in the front and
pockets at the front of the jacket and they

00:03:21.609 --> 00:03:25.230
are mesh backed pockets.

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:27.510
So that also enhances air flow.

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:30.020
At times you may not even need to open the
pit zips.

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:34.379
Just open the pockets and you may get all
the air flow that you need.

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:39.569
Another thing to call out on this left hand
side of the pocket is this jacket actually

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:45.409
stuffs into that pocket for easy stow.

00:03:45.409 --> 00:03:49.840
Got the PreCip jacket stowed inside that left
pocket.

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:51.659
You see a nice compact size.

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:53.099
It sits pretty flat.

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:56.909
It fits nicely inside a pack.

00:03:56.909 --> 00:04:02.840
Keeps that waterproof, breathable protection
close at hand in case you need it.

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:08.629
Again, just a great option, 13.1 ounces, a
price that lets you save a few dollars and

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:10.689
put towards other gear.

00:04:10.689 --> 00:04:13.129
The Marmot men’s PreCip jacket.
