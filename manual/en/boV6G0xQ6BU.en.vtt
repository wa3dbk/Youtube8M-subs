picked him up and we're really impressed

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:08.679
with how

00:00:08.679 --> 00:00:11.689
clear the sound is how well they work

00:00:11.689 --> 00:00:13.469
and uh...

00:00:13.469 --> 00:00:15.099
the other important thing

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:19.080
apart from how they sound is how they
look and how sturdy they are

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:22.960
and uh... we're pretty impressed with
that the packaging

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:27.199
that they came in with uh... a big box
and there was very little

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:30.210
assembly basically we just switched out

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:31.649
uh... defeat

00:00:31.649 --> 00:00:32.840

it attach is uh...

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.620
discovered plates attach bite magnets

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:48.310
so you can see there's no

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:49.610
you don't have to

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:51.920

00:01:09.539 --> 00:01:14.230
go into account stabilizer and you can
just those two

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:16.820
level them

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:18.770
we felt we didn't have to do that

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:22.120
the other option

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:23.540
this is filthy

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:25.410

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:42.870
important

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:45.080

just ticket for you know oklahoma

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.150

in the building need

00:02:15.079 --> 00:02:16.489

00:02:16.489 --> 00:02:19.859
you can see it's connor

00:02:19.859 --> 00:02:22.409
subwoofer title

00:02:22.409 --> 00:02:23.989
pulled down their ideas

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:24.650
debates

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:27.349
sounds really good on these

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:30.079
uh... we test it out with some movies
and

00:02:30.079 --> 00:02:34.439
had a lot of fun cranking up uh... also
the type of camp that you use with these

00:02:34.439 --> 00:02:35.599
as governor

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:38.289
uh... create tremendous

00:02:38.289 --> 00:02:40.629
difference

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:42.529
the quality of the sample

00:02:42.529 --> 00:02:44.279
you're going to be able to get

00:02:44.279 --> 00:02:46.899
and so i'd recommend getting a really
good amp

00:02:46.899 --> 00:02:47.969
uh... for these

00:02:47.969 --> 00:02:49.009
the one thing

00:02:49.009 --> 00:02:50.989
um... appear

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:52.499
this is uh...

00:02:52.499 --> 00:02:55.659
fabric and then

00:02:55.659 --> 00:02:58.889
this little you you can feel that

00:02:58.889 --> 00:03:00.289
ventilation and lighting

00:03:00.289 --> 00:03:04.199
flynn a ralph whatever but this is this
will get dusty soldiers as well to keep

00:03:04.199 --> 00:03:05.419
that in mind

00:03:05.419 --> 00:03:08.249
that you'll need to know

00:03:08.249 --> 00:03:12.509
clean then it goes around the back as
well

00:03:12.509 --> 00:03:14.759
overall really impressed

00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:18.059
withheld these sound i've notified
trimmings on

00:03:18.059 --> 00:03:19.799
uh...

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:21.540
and this week or two camera

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:27.899
it's not consumed it with the time you
camera microphone that i have

00:03:27.899 --> 00:03:30.029
they've really do a good job

00:03:30.029 --> 00:03:32.669
the uh... the full range of sound

00:03:32.669 --> 00:03:33.889
and uh...

00:03:33.889 --> 00:03:36.859
as far as being sturdy on carpet

00:03:36.859 --> 00:03:39.389
so here and giving a little

00:03:39.389 --> 00:03:42.819
will push so if you've got really little
kids

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:45.449
you know you might want to be

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:48.950
be careful about this

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:49.989
but

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:50.969
uh...

00:03:50.969 --> 00:03:52.659
those pointy

00:03:52.659 --> 00:03:55.249
pointy feet

00:03:55.249 --> 00:03:56.760
topped the kinda keep it in there

00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:00.649
cricket that you can see him convicted

00:04:00.649 --> 00:04:05.179
rocking back and forth

00:04:05.179 --> 00:04:09.749
uh... so those of the the two things to
be aware of

00:04:09.749 --> 00:04:12.229
but the sound is is pretty good

00:04:12.229 --> 00:04:14.339
and excellent sound

00:04:14.339 --> 00:04:15.519
and we'd really like
