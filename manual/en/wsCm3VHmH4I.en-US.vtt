00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:28.600
It takes years to create a game.

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:34.340
It’s a long and arduous road.

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:43.420
It all starts with a tiny idea, but the combined efforts of the staff and their boundless creativity 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.920
turn it into a great story. 

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.740
A rough idea gets polished by the entire team

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:58.160
 until it shines brilliantly.

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.300
Game development is a series of straightforward activities.

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.660
It’s a daily continuation of trial and error.

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:23.260
Day in and day out, the staff struggles to overcome their hurdles.

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:29.200
And one by one, our games grow into something special.

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:35.620
Because we know that it’s this accumulation of tiny things

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.580
that combine to form a great experience.

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.000
How many games can a person make in one lifetime?

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:48.940
Probably not that many.

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.480
That’s why we always pour our all into every title we create.

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:00.400
We never compromise.

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:09.420
We picture our fans gripping their controllers in excitement.

00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:13.860
How can we surprise them?

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.460
 Can they overcome our challenges? 

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:21.340
Are we making sure the game is fun?

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.380
Games that move you, games that make you forget time.

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:31.000
That’s what we want the world to experience.

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:39.200
We love games and we know what makes them fun

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:43.160
more than anyone else.

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:51.940
The world needs games that are even better than the ones we grew up with.

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:04.100
And now it’s our turn to make them.

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:08.360
So, are you with us?
