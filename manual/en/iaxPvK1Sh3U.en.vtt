00:00:00.104 --> 00:00:02.785
Dear photography friend! Hi! I'’m Michael Zelbel.

00:00:02.785 --> 00:00:06.587
I’'m in Beijing and we are here in our apartment hotel.

00:00:06.587 --> 00:00:10.585
We will use this apartment to shoot some cool bodyscapes.

00:00:10.585 --> 00:00:14.384
For that, with me, I’'ve got my friend, Sasha and Linxi,

00:00:14.384 --> 00:00:19.352
and I will show you exactly how we’re going to shoot this cool bodyscapes

00:00:19.352 --> 00:00:22.352
with very, very little effort and very little equipment.

00:00:22.352 --> 00:00:24.958
So keep on watching.

00:00:27.017 --> 00:00:32.805
Here you see one reason why I really prefer this apartment hotels over a regular hotel:

00:00:33.101 --> 00:00:37.161
They come with this lovely little built in kitchen.

00:00:37.377 --> 00:00:40.649
Not that I am good on cooking, but I really like it.

00:00:40.649 --> 00:00:45.012
Look what we can find over here: kitchen paper.

00:00:45.012 --> 00:00:48.849
Simple, white, a little bit transparent kitchen paper.

00:00:48.849 --> 00:00:53.849
This can act as a cool diffuser for our flashlights, for our speed lights.

00:00:53.849 --> 00:00:58.048
So, if we find something to attach this kitchen paper,

00:00:58.048 --> 00:01:01.378
then we can simulate a strip light with it.

00:01:01.378 --> 00:01:04.766
This is what I’m going to do right now.

00:01:09.849 --> 00:01:17.253
I found this little TV rack, which will act as a horizontal strip light.

00:01:17.253 --> 00:01:21.897
I will use my kitchen paper as a diffuser.

00:01:21.897 --> 00:01:24.216
So again, it's powered by two speedlights.

00:01:24.216 --> 00:01:29.454
I will place one over here, one over there,

00:01:29.454 --> 00:01:40.150
and in front of it, I will now tape the kitchen paper.

00:01:40.728 --> 00:01:46.229
I hope this is going to work. I had no rehearsal.

00:01:50.781 --> 00:01:59.681
While you patiently watch me taping the kitchen paper to the TV rack,

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:01.779
I can probably answer the question:

00:02:01.779 --> 00:02:07.685
"Is there a reason for the speedlights to be gelled with orange gel in front of them?"

00:02:07.956 --> 00:02:10.949
Actually, no! There is no real reason.

00:02:11.284 --> 00:02:13.579
It's just because all day I am shooting over here

00:02:13.579 --> 00:02:17.854
in this mixed light Tungsten and flashlight environment,

00:02:17.854 --> 00:02:20.422
Sometimes I’m shooting mixed light.

00:02:20.422 --> 00:02:24.099
And sometimes, like right now, I'm shooting just flash light.

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:32.220
I know myself. I know I will forget to attach gels.

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.019
I will forget to change the whitebalance

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:37.508
from Tungsten to flashlight the on or the other time.

00:02:37.508 --> 00:02:42.100
So I stay with one setting: for the whole day the flashes are gelled.

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:45.344
For the whole day the whitebalance is set to Tungsten.

00:02:45.344 --> 00:02:50.754
That’s it. Nothing more.

00:02:50.754 --> 00:02:54.059
In this particular scene, I will set up the speed lights manually.

00:02:54.059 --> 00:02:59.182
I will start with 1/4 of the power for each of them.

00:02:59.182 --> 00:03:08.057
Again I will use the on camera flash to trigger the speedlights.

00:03:08.899 --> 00:03:17.100
I will probably leave the on camera flash on at 1/32nd of power,

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:21.824
just to fill in the really dark shadows. Nothing more.

00:03:21.824 --> 00:03:23.781
I'’ll do one more thing to this set up

00:03:23.781 --> 00:03:29.142
because I will shoot bodyscapes over here in front of this striplight.

00:03:29.142 --> 00:03:33.941
In bodyscapes you sometimes see the far-away background

00:03:33.941 --> 00:03:35.771
and I want that to be black.

00:03:35.771 --> 00:03:39.742
Another thing I want is: I want to have something for the models to lay on.

00:03:39.742 --> 00:03:47.342
So I will put this reflector-material, the black side of it,  right over here.

00:03:47.342 --> 00:03:52.544
Over there, inside, it will be very black anyway.

00:03:52.544 --> 00:03:55.755
But over here, some light might hit the ground.

00:03:55.755 --> 00:04:00.211
While the wooden floor is nice, I prefer it black, really black.

00:04:00.211 --> 00:04:06.062
This material will do the job.  It will care for making it really black.

00:04:06.853 --> 00:04:08.145
There you have it!

00:04:08.145 --> 00:04:12.086
Then let’'s give it a quick try with the camera.

00:04:21.444 --> 00:04:24.071
Wonderful. That’'s a good strip light.

00:04:24.071 --> 00:04:27.541
So we’re going to try it out.

00:04:51.495 --> 00:04:57.336
[..and the last one! Xiexie!]

00:04:57.336 --> 00:05:01.056
So, this was working just beautifully.

00:05:01.056 --> 00:05:04.175
I really like the photos that we made.

00:05:04.175 --> 00:05:11.096
Of course, I was a bit lucky to find such an ideal piece of furniture to act as a strip light.

00:05:11.096 --> 00:05:14.057
But, hey, what’'s life without luck.

00:05:14.057 --> 00:05:18.482
I hope you are lucky as well when you look around at what you can use.

00:05:18.482 --> 00:05:21.534
And I hope you can find it a little bit inspiring.

00:05:21.534 --> 00:05:25.732
If you find it inspiring, please give me feedback. I'm loving that.

00:05:25.732 --> 00:05:30.895
In any case, I wish you a lot of fun with your shoots and good light!

00:05:30.895 --> 00:05:32.577
See you soon.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000
