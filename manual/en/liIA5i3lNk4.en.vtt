Hi, Youtube. So sorry I haven't been uploading in he last couple of days

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:08.908
I made this big water marble tutorial, and then I found out that a lot of stuff was out of focus

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:15.240
So I really couldn't upload it, but I promise you I will redo that manicure and make a good video

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:19.979
I guess I still have a lot too learn about how to use my camera and how to film

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:26.879
but today, I want to show you how to use striping tape and I have this striping tape from eBay

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:34.049
Just search on striping tape nail art and you will find these and these are just a couple of dollars

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.329
So really cheap and you get ten different colors

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.270
[for] this [tutorial]. It doesn't matter which color you're going to use because you won't see the tape anyways

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:48.029
But I will also make other videos where you are going to see the tape but not for this tutorial

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:52.890
And I've used a Barry M yellow as my base color

00:00:53.199 --> 00:00:58.049
and I've used China Glaze Westside Warrior as the second color and

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:04.110
I've used these drip-dry drops from OPI, and it doesn't matter which brand you're choosing

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:08.939
But these work really well, this is optional you don't need this for this

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:11.439
manicure but

00:01:11.439 --> 00:01:14.759
You can't use a top coat because then you will smudge your design

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:20.699
So that's why I'm using these drops because they won't smudge and then you don't have to wait that long till your polish is dry

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:25.229
And of course we need our nail polish remover and our cleanup brush

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:27.900
So let me show you how easy this is.

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:32.729
Make sure that the base colors dry otherwise the polish will come up when we remove the tape

00:01:33.189 --> 00:01:38.219
Apply the tape on your nails, and I like it when all my nails look different, but apply them in the way you like it

00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:35.800
Make sure that the tape touches the nails on the sides because otherwise the polish will go underneath

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:40.610
if

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:48.460
You let the tape cross over another one remember the one that's on top. So those are these two these are the ones on top

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:55.600
Because later on when I'm going to remove the tape I want to remove these two first before removing those three

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:01.180
Now apply the second color and make sure that you don't see the base color anymore

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:29.359
When you're done remove the tape while the polish is still wet

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:34.820
Remember the top one first

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:48.500
and then you can remove the other ones

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:12.879
Use your cleanup brush to remove the excess polish and wait till the polish is completely dry before applying a top coat

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:30.209
If you want you can use drying drops to speed up the drying process

00:04:36.010 --> 00:04:40.469
So as you can see it's very easy, and I'm going to film a new tutorial this weekend

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:43.679
So stay tuned and if you have any questions, just let me know bye. Bye
