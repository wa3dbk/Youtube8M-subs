00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:06.970
tonight has become the victim ever own
success

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:11.980
demand for blue fin tuna in particular
has been sharply increasing in recent

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:12.959
times

00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:18.320
in part because of the popularity of
Japanese busy

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.250
the supply however is no longer able to
keep up

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:24.369
overfishing threatens to diminish if
even further

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:29.289
an agreement reached at a recent
international conference will regulate

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:32.119
the captive wild blue fin tuna and the
Pacific

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:35.559
those who sign on hold it isn't too late

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:40.579
well if anyone should be concerned about
this appliance the Japanese

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:44.530
they consume about seventy percent of
the world Pacific Blue Fin Tuna

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:48.500
a Japanese university has come up with a
way of taking pressure

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:51.790
of the fish it see by breeding blue fins
from

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:58.409
fertilized eggs raised on farms
customers have been flowing into this

00:00:58.409 --> 00:00:59.830
new restaurant ever since

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:04.000
open a month ago there all waiting in
line for a completely new

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.210
culinary experience the main part of the
menu here is blue fin tuna

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:13.880
but not just any blue fin tuna all farm
bred

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.409
well the taste doesn't taste any
different

00:01:17.409 --> 00:01:20.530
fresh had from the sea with

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:24.229
its eat and tastes good them

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:28.060
a total fatty tuna is comparable to that
too famous to Turkish market

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.969
the restaurant is run by Kinki
University

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:36.999
as a way of finding out if consumers
will take a liking to the farm raised

00:01:36.999 --> 00:01:37.389
fish

00:01:37.389 --> 00:01:44.389
the tuna on the menu was born n raised
at the school's experimental farm in

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:46.420
Wakayama Prefecture

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:50.850
since 1970

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:55.319
its fisheries lab has been working too
far race to now without using wild stock

00:01:55.319 --> 00:02:00.560
the top

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:07.560
official this size is about three months
old

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:11.600
cookie he got cut ahead the institution
he's been involved in the research

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:13.350
centers undergraduate day

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:18.930
methods to breed sea bream and
yellowtail had already been established

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.820
when he joined the project

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:26.100
tuna was more difficult the fish are
especially sensitive

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:29.600
a tuna would react to even subtle noises
or light

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:34.670
and had to its demise in the nets over
pan

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:38.239
ok other hand has Bella researchers
succeeded in avoiding bad outcome

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:42.680
by almost doubling the size of the pan
and changing the shape from cuba Lloyd

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:47.920
two cylindrical after 32 years

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.049
the team finally succeeded in farm
reading tuna from

00:02:51.049 --> 00:02:54.670
fertilized x2 full-grown fish in 2002

00:02:54.670 --> 00:03:00.019
the next goals were bringing down costs

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:03.209
and developing feet to create a better
consistency

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:10.209
tuna swim vigorously and typically
consume large amounts of fish such as

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:12.440
horse mackerel and mackerel

00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:19.440
but using fish for feed is costly

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:22.420
mixed feed offers an alternative

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:26.760
the researchers tried various
combinations are vitamins and fish meal

00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:32.780
they had a hard time getting to know to
accept that we have eating at first

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:36.629
to the car or so Google social

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:40.989
if something other than the taste of the
feed such as color or shape

00:03:40.989 --> 00:03:45.310
can weather tuners appetite we may be
able to come up with a solution

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:52.310
with the guy has a stigma a period of
three to five years usually is necessary

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:56.010
for tonight to become an adult that can
be shipped

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:00.280
tune on the farm are bred on the mic
speed until they reach the age of three

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:00.989
months

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:07.489
the researchers are investigating how to
extend the use of the mix beat bike

00:04:07.489 --> 00:04:10.560
trying alternative content so far

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:17.560
the long as they've been able to nurse a
fish with only this has been three years

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:21.889
another avenue for boosting production

00:04:21.889 --> 00:04:28.220
could be genetic analysis last year the
team identified a gene of the blue fin

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:33.380
tuna that can accelerate growth later
this year they plan to select individual

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:34.889
tuna that have the gene

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:41.650
and start reading them on the farm
University the mining

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:45.199
private firms to participate as a way of
expanding production

00:04:45.199 --> 00:04:51.889
the school itself is overseeing the
hatching of blue fin tuna eggs

00:04:51.889 --> 00:04:56.030
the larva grow into fry and are sold to
a wholesale breeder

00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:01.000
outside the school the breeder keep the
fry for about three months

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.169
when the younglings grow to about 30
centimetres

00:05:04.169 --> 00:05:08.340
they're sold to tune a farmer's when
they reach adulthood

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:15.340
the fish are ready to go to market the
company that deals with the younglings

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:18.560
has a facility in nagasaki P picture

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:23.130
high sulfur coulda is now in the fourth
year

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:26.889
raising fry he says the survival rate
has increased

00:05:26.889 --> 00:05:32.979
but it's still below fifty percent on a
machine gun on you

00:05:32.979 --> 00:05:37.639
here the fish have only two winning you
serve showing their condition

00:05:37.639 --> 00:05:41.380
vigorously eating billion dollar
silently

00:05:41.380 --> 00:05:44.610
dying and I'm it easier night

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:47.960
mother

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:51.310
I tell readers to watch the this
constant each

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:54.500
fish is sending a particular message
without exception

00:05:54.500 --> 00:06:01.500
we have to train people to read the
signals 7,000 at the University born to

00:06:03.199 --> 00:06:03.510
now

00:06:03.510 --> 00:06:10.060
are shipped to market annually within
two years the institution intends to

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:11.260
further develop as

00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:14.710
technology with support from the
government that should allow it to

00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:21.710
eventually increase the number farm
redfish to 100,000 per year

00:06:22.729 --> 00:06:26.460
to that end it set up a wholly owned
firm that promotes everything from

00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:27.160
research

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:32.410
all the way to the Salem Barbara tuna
Malaysia

00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:36.070
it what would you think about starting a
farm in Malaysia on

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:42.419
net overseas production is under
consideration to ensure a steady supply

00:06:42.419 --> 00:06:48.340
through the use of diverse locales or to
your sample

00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:53.750
hellish cable what if I hope to create
alliances with major businesses

00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:57.180
and expand the number of farms

00:06:57.180 --> 00:07:02.400
they are my whole our tuna farming will
not will spread across the globe then

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:05.979
indians tiny cottle eurozone with a guy
not the

00:07:05.979 --> 00:07:09.340
only from arms

00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:12.930
to kitchen if the university project can
succeed

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:16.590
it will earn the appreciation and diners
around the world

00:07:16.590 --> 00:07:21.289
and in their own way perhaps even that
banks have the tuna population

00:07:21.289 --> 00:07:24.789
at sea and
