00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:07.380
This is a review on the Marvel Legends 2 pack

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:11.450
of the Black Widow and the Winter Soldier

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:14.610
and this was a Toys R Us exclusive

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.490
on a fan poll contest there's two
different versions

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:22.450
and easy way to tell difference is the
Black Widow

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:26.250
on the other version is gray and

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.720
the costume here is black on this version

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.500
and the Winter Soldier it's hard to tell
but on the variant

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:38.300
the straps are a little darker in color
and he has the American star here

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:42.809
but on the other version he has the
soviet star which was a red star

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:46.489
but other than that it's a

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:50.920
great 2 pack I just like that this version a little better cuz its the black

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:54.040
costume and it's more current in her
look

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:57.519
and it also has two

00:00:57.519 --> 00:01:01.100
extra heads which they switched

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:05.560
and honestly I think the heads look
better this one

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:09.750
when he was the evil Winter Soldier
looks better than when he's Bucky

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.049
and even though it's not as accurate
with the short hair

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:17.200
for this costume I think the Black Widow
here looks better than this one

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:21.189
in terms of face sculpt I'll get into that in
a minute

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:25.189
just want show you the weapons first she has this

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:28.380
machine gun that they've used before
Hasbro

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.200
and she has a handgun here

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:36.780
which could either be the Winter Soldier or hers

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.210
but it looks better on her because

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:45.250
the Winter Soldier has this gun and
even though on the packaging is for the

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:46.020
Black Widow

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:49.780
it's actually a weapon he did use in the
comics so

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:53.399
that fits in holster here or if you wanted

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:56.659
you could put this weapon in the holster

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:00.289
and they both fit and he got this

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:03.710
grenade launcher machine gun weapon

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:09.729
that they've used before Hasbro but this
fist right here it's closed

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:14.500
so only his right hand can hold a weapon
if you look at the face sculpt here

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:18.650
you can see his eyes as the Winter Soldier and he has

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:23.230
short hair as Bucky here

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.930
nice detailing in terms if this area over here

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:30.690
and right hand is a glove here

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.710
this looks really nice his bionic arm has
a

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:39.710
cable attachment here and all this is
sculpted on its not painted on

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:42.970
some nice straps here over here

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:47.910
side holster here its reused parts from other figures but

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:52.450
it works I mean it looks like the Winter Soldier the boots are black

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:55.630
and when you switch the head

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:59.270
this is the evil version of the Winter
Soldier

00:02:59.270 --> 00:03:02.880
when he was a bad guy I actually think
the evil version

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:06.660
looks better when I have it on display it's
this version

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:10.220
looks like he's a badass like this

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:14.500
no more mister nice guy the Winter Soldier

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:17.540
and when you look at the Black Widow

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:20.630
yeah

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:25.290
she's unzipping and is in

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:28.910
great shape she has a yellow here

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:33.340
on gray variant it does not have the
belt and

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:36.430
is like yellow or gold as well the

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:41.200
wrist weapons as a

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.930
basic black bodysuit and they have reused this

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:48.670
a lot of these parts before Hasbro for other figures like the Shield

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:52.400
agent women and

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.840
to be honest when you take out this long

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:59.810
hair face sculpt which I'll show you in
a minute

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:02.810
and you put the

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:06.370
short hair version on her I think that

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:09.820
version with the short hair actually

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:13.780
is the better of the two so you got the
short hair version

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:17.239
and you got the long hair Winter Soldier version

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:21.380
and I think these two look better than
the other two versions

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:27.340
just my opinion and

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:30.730
another nice detail here can see the black
widow symbol here

00:04:30.730 --> 00:04:33.830
articulation wise nice up and down

00:04:33.830 --> 00:04:37.740
and side to side but if you have this hair

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:42.800
is little more restrained due to the sculpt of the long hair

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:46.350
the shoulders side to side

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:50.930
and up an down elbow one point articulation

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:54.710
but you can spin it around the hand

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:57.900
In N Out and you can spin it it's a
grip

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:01.570
but it does have a trigger finger same
thing here you can spin it

00:05:01.570 --> 00:05:05.140
in and out but has a trigger finger grip

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:08.790
upper body here side to side up and down

00:05:08.790 --> 00:05:12.160
hips side to side up

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:15.940
and down upper thigh cuts here

00:05:15.940 --> 00:05:19.170
has a double knee

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:23.530
nothing at the boot area here but
the feet can spin

00:05:23.530 --> 00:05:28.380
and you can go up and down so it's nice
to have that option

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:32.490
and the Winter Soldier here his articulation

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:38.620
side to side up and down shoulders ball jointed so they can go in and out

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:42.470
up and down upper biceps here

00:05:42.470 --> 00:05:46.990
articulated double elbow but want be careful cuz the cord  here

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:50.540
and the wrist can turn double elbow

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:54.590
and can spin the wrist here open grip an trigger finger

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:58.830
does have upper body articulation but this
vest gets in the way so you really can't

00:05:58.830 --> 00:05:59.680
turn it

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:03.380
too much and is no waist articulation

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:08.190
but the hips go side to side can go up
and down

00:06:08.190 --> 00:06:11.450
and you got the upper articulation point
there

00:06:11.450 --> 00:06:14.870
you do have double knees

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:19.340
nothing at the boot area but the feet do spin

00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:23.139
and can go up and down so you do have
that

00:06:23.139 --> 00:06:26.210
and the boots pretty nice overall

00:06:26.210 --> 00:06:30.100
this Hasbro 2 pack is a real winner
because

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:33.290
this black widow is the best version in this scale

00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:36.350
and the Winter Soldier is a new character in this scale

00:06:36.350 --> 00:06:41.130
so both figures are great and got extra
heads and got the weapons

00:06:41.130 --> 00:06:44.180
if you could get this at good price I'd
highly recommend

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:51.180
thanks for watching

00:06:54.139 --> 00:06:57.459
hey Natasha let's get outta here go on a
date

00:06:57.459 --> 00:06:58.179
and catch a movie
