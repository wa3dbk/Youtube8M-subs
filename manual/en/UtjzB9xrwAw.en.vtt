00:00:20.921 --> 00:00:25.416
Mature opinions, 
arrogant opinions,

00:00:26.457 --> 00:00:29.319
about our country.

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:33.903
Mornings and afternoons talking

00:00:34.305 --> 00:00:37.689
about our country.

00:00:39.046 --> 00:00:42.039
I would also like to

00:00:42.031 --> 00:00:46.791
have such securities.

00:00:48.567 --> 00:00:51.225
but how I can?

00:00:52.167 --> 00:00:56.559
My calculations don't seem to add up.

00:01:00.615 --> 00:01:02.799
They are lucky

00:01:03.297 --> 00:01:08.178
Those from anywhere!

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:17.151
They fly over all frontiers.

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:21.159
Nobody told me

00:01:21.999 --> 00:01:26.895
how difficult it is to be Basque

00:01:28.161 --> 00:01:30.663
that I should rather choose to be

00:01:31.743 --> 00:01:36.543
a citizen of the world.

00:01:37.887 --> 00:01:43.560
I'd like to sing sweet songs

00:01:47.265 --> 00:01:50.457
the sun 

00:01:50.991 --> 00:01:54.168
for that who is in the shade.

00:01:57.208 --> 00:02:00.729
Take care of what you love.

00:02:20.946 --> 00:02:23.415
They tell me so:

00:02:24.208 --> 00:02:29.031
What are you doing singing about love?

00:02:30.273 --> 00:02:32.913
Coexistence is risking

00:02:33.808 --> 00:02:37.938
and you keep singing small verses.

00:02:39.639 --> 00:02:46.449
I'd like to sing sweet songs.

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:51.873
the sun 

00:02:52.335 --> 00:02:56.712
for that who is in the shade.

00:02:58.623 --> 00:03:02.529
Take care of what you love.

00:03:04.833 --> 00:03:10.650
I'd like to sing sweet songs.

00:03:13.108 --> 00:03:16.876
the sun 

00:03:17.439 --> 00:03:20.631
for that who is in the shade.

00:03:23.463 --> 00:03:27.567
Take care of what you love.

00:03:28.752 --> 00:03:32.097
Take care of what you hate.

00:03:32.538 --> 00:03:37.287
Take care of what you love.
