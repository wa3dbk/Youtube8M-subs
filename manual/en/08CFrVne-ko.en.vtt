00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
NASA's Cassini spacecraft is doing some awesome stuff today.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Stay tuned to NASA's Twitter feed Space Cadets. This is going to be interesting.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
I'm Benjamin Higginbotham and this is your

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
Space Pod for November 30, 2010

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
About a month ago, on November 2, 2010, the Cassini space craft went into

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
'safe mode' because the on-board computer had a messed up bit.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Not a part, but an actual one and a zero.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
As a result the space craft was unable to process important instructions,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
hence 'safe mode'. This is the sixth time that has happened

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
since it's launch in 1997. 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
About a week ago on Nov. 24, 2010, 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Cassini was brought back to full operation and just in time.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
At 11:54 SET (Spacecraft Event Time) today,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
which is kind of like UTC

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
except offset for the fact that the spacecraft is

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
at, hmm, where is it? It's at Saturn.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Cassini will pass around 48km, or 30 miles,

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
from the surface of Enceladus, one of the moons of Saturn.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
During the closest part of the fly by

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Cassini will take gravity measurements to help

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.000
understand the moon's interior structure better. You can follow

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
all of this action on the official Cassini Twitter page at

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
twitter.com/cassinisaturn

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Other great stuff has come out of this craft as well.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.000
The Cassini spacecraft has detected a very

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
weak atmosphere, known as an exosphere,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
infused with oxygen and carbon dioxide around Saturn's icy moon, Rhea.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Now this is the first time a spacecraft

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
has directly captured molecules

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000
of an actual oxygen atmosphere, albeit a very thin one, 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000
of a world other than Earth.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000
This means that active, complex chemistry involving oxygen

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
may be quite common throughout the solar system - 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
even our universe. It could mean that life is even more common

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
than we think today. Now there's not enough data yet, but it's certainly

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
an interesting find and it's right in our backyard.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Now let's close this out a bit closer to home.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000
Saturn is awesome and all but Earth is just as awesome.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
We have a time lapse of some amazing Aurora Borealis.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Recorded over Norway, what better way to see this

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
amazing imagery than on your HDTV and thanks to Roku,

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
now you can.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000
Tune in this Friday at 0200 UTC

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.000
during our live show for your chance to win

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
a Roku HD player. Now for those of you in the

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000
US, that's Thursday night at 6pm PST, 9 EST.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.000
You can only win, if you watch LIVE.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Now let's end this Space Pod right.
