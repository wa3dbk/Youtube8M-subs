00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:23.949
You know how it works.

00:00:23.949 --> 00:00:25.199
You've seen movies.

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.700
The pretty girl always has it easy, right?

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:29.480
She gets everything she wants.

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:33.841
Even if she's done nothing to deserve it,
aside from having good genetics and an even

00:00:33.841 --> 00:00:34.841
better rack.

00:00:34.841 --> 00:00:37.420
The ladies of Mighty Switch Force! are not
that girl.

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:40.080
Now, don't get me wrong, these ladies are
pretty.

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:43.440
And every one of them has an exquisite pixelated
rack.

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:49.190
But they're more than just, sexy sprites...with
suggestive comments.

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:52.050
And 16-bit boob physics.

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:59.580
They're also...I lost my train of thought.

00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:06.950
Nonetheless, hot chicks, great platforming,
retro graphics.

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:11.330
That's, like...I'm not sure there's anything
else I want video games to have.

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:15.930
And it just so happens that Mighty Switch
Force! has all three of them, and in copious

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:16.930
amounts.

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:20.920
There were actually a couple different Mighty
games before it, but after it debuted on the

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.890
3DS in 2011, Mighty Switch Force! kinda became
its own thing.

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:30.560
It got an HD rerelease in 2012, for the Wii
U...and a year later, sequel city.

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:31.690
Mighty Switch Force!

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:32.690
2.

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:34.350
This time, you spray girls with hoses.

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.800
You freaking perv.

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:38.940
So you play as Patricia Wagon.

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:40.120
Get it, Patty Wagon?

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:44.900
Anyway, she's a sexy little cyborg who served
as a police officer in the original game.

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:46.730
This time, she's a fire lady.

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:50.000
So she has to rescue damsels in distress and
save some babies.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:56.159
So you could call it a fire-fighting simulator,
only it's also a great puzzle-platformer.

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:02.680
And the raddest f*cking fire-fighting simulator
ever.

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:14.930
This game is unbelievable.

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:16.170
So it works like this.

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:21.930
Each level—or incident, as they're called—has
five hot chicks to save, as well as an optional

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:24.819
baby...which are really tricky to get to.

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:28.230
So you platform your way through the level
to get to the girls.

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:29.569
Only it's not that simple.

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:34.830
See, there two sets of blocks scattered through
each stage, and Patty Wagon can switch them

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:36.790
between foreground and background.

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:42.819
So you can move them back and forth to, say...create
a staircase, or activate a cannon.

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:45.920
Or crush a bad guy through the screen.

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:50.069
This switching mechanic is the game's central
element, and it's amazing how many ways the

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:53.650
team at WayForward incorporates that into
the level design.

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:56.270
Like the original game, it just never gets
old.

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:59.890
Both because it's so much fun to switch on
the fly...and because the design is always

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:00.890
creative.

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:03.209
And of course, the sequel throws water into
the mix.

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:07.829
There are blocks that you can wash away, there
are tubes you can use to blast water above

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:08.829
you.

00:03:08.829 --> 00:03:11.970
So although the mechanics are similar to the
original, this one also has its a bit of its

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:12.970
own identity.

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:15.450
The water puzzles really set Mighty Switch
Force!

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:16.859
2 apart from its predecessor.

00:03:16.859 --> 00:03:19.380
You know what else I love about these games?

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:20.380
The pace.

00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:22.279
The levels never stick around too long.

00:03:22.279 --> 00:03:24.160
They never wear out their welcome.

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:28.419
Each of the game's 16 levels are just the
right length, and when it's all said done,

00:03:28.419 --> 00:03:30.510
you can finish the game in two or three hours.

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:34.769
Fortunately, it's also one of those games
you can replay over and over, because it emphasizes

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:35.930
speed runs.

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:39.739
Each level has a par time, which...I never
even came close to matching.

00:03:39.739 --> 00:03:48.700
But at least working toward it is a lot of
fun.

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:53.000
You know, the amazing thing about WayForward
is that...they don't just make great games.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.510
They make great games that are, like...little
time machines.

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:57.510
Mighty Switch Force!

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:59.610
2 is just an awesome game, period.

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:05.209
But it also, legitimately, feels like some
forgotten Super Nintendo classic.

00:04:05.209 --> 00:04:09.510
It totally has that 16-bit feel, and not just
because of how it looks.

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:10.810
It's how it's designed.

00:04:10.810 --> 00:04:15.189
It's how it plays.

00:04:15.189 --> 00:04:19.829
WayForward may or may not have a time machine,
is what I'm saying.

00:04:19.829 --> 00:04:20.829
Look, guys.

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:21.829
It's real simple.

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:26.160
If you have a Wii U, and you have, like...15
bucks to spare, you need to load up the eShop

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:27.160
and get both of them.

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:31.200
The original game, the Hyper Drive Edition,
and this tremendous sequel.

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:32.300
Mighty Switch Force!

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:39.050
2 is a truly great platformer, wearing the
disguise of a truly great puzzle game...starring

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:42.120
16-bit girls, with truly great racks.
