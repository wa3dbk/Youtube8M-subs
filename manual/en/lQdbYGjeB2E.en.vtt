00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:04.830
Hi, welcome back. Our world is full of
distractions.

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:11.559
We're on call 24 hours a day with our cell phones. Ugh it's Bill

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:15.150
Talk to my agent.

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:18.570
Studies show that the way we consume media today,

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:24.000
in a constant stream of small doses has
dramatically lowered our attention spans.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.539
There's an epidemic texting while
walking,

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.420
but the good news is

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:37.180
the very same gadgets that it wreaked
havoc on our

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:40.250
attention spans, if harnessed in the
right way,

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:43.680
can actually help improve our memory and focus.

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.809
With the right practice we can
rewire

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:52.350
our brains and improve their performance. Today we're
talking about gaming the brain

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.350
We've been told for years

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.789
that a crossword a day can help keep our
minds sharp.

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:08.140
But, researchers at UCSF have compelling
evidence to suggest that

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.460
video games can also boost mental acuity.

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:21.509
A team of researchers conducted an experiment in
which they asked a group of sixty to

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:22.960
eighty five year olds

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.979
to periodically play a video game

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:27.500
over the course of a few months.

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.060
We came up with this game

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:33.159
called NeuroRacer looking at his performance
on how well he stays in the middle

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:38.200
and how frequently he diverts into that
yellow or red region. It's kinda fun.

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:42.689
Over the course of the next month, the
researchers tracked the ability of the

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.610
participants to multitask

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:47.740
and the results for the older
participants were

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:51.610
very interesting. It was really impactful

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:55.799
for us to see such drastic
improvement in their

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:00.140
multitasking abilities on the game
itself. At the beginning of the test,

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:03.909
older participants scored significantly
lower in the game

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:08.300
when compared with their younger
counterparts. But after the month was

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.879
over

00:02:08.879 --> 00:02:12.349
their scores were basically even.

00:02:12.349 --> 00:02:16.280
And here's the interesting part, after
the test

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.010
the older participants performed better
in their focus

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:24.290
multitasking and short term memory
outside of the game.

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:28.709
I'll try to keep my brain active by playing on my Nintendo.

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:32.560
It's helped to keep my brain as active as
possible

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:35.910
0h my! Needless to say,

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:40.530
these findings are game changing. I'm feeling a
little lonely.

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:46.000
Let's fix that. Welcome experienced gamer
and multitasker Felicia Day.

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:47.000
Hi Felicia

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:48.940
Hi George. How are you?

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:53.569
I am extremely excited to be here. Well
you're a writer, producer

00:02:53.569 --> 00:02:58.099
entrepreneur, and an actor. How do you
think gaming has helped you

00:02:58.099 --> 00:03:02.090
or hurt your multitasking? I think actually

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:06.200
gaming is in a lot of instances
are very good

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:10.590
is very good for your brain out. My whole
career is kinda based on gaming

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:14.159
To me social media as a little bit more
taxing on the brain as far as

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:17.950
being able to concentrate on one thing.
Gaming takes all your focus

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:21.330
and I think you come out better for it
in the end. I can tell you about a recent

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:22.510
study that's been done

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:26.170
and that's shown that seniors playing
games

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:31.549
will improve their focus and attention
span. I believe that hundred percent because

00:03:31.549 --> 00:03:32.250
like I said

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:35.299
as opposed to the social

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:39.040
the social world and sort of the net I
think that gaming does focus you.

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:42.900
What do you think these technological
devices have done to your

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:47.370
attention span and focus. From a
creativity standpoint you know the fact

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:49.680
that everyone is always reflexively
going to their phone

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:52.689
and checking it means that you don't get
bored and I

00:03:52.689 --> 00:03:55.700
and basically your creativity is

00:03:55.799 --> 00:03:59.200
born of boredom so your brain starts to
connect things that they wouldn't

00:03:59.299 --> 00:04:00.209
connect normally.

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:03.400
So that's what I feel as someone who
creates things.

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:07.799
That the more I unplug and am
disciplined about that the more creative

00:04:07.799 --> 00:04:08.379
I am.

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:12.760
Well thank you very much for sharing
your energy and enthusiasm

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:16.400
and your experience with gaming.
Thank you for having me

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:20.109
My take is this, we're battling
distractions

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:24.500
constantly. We can choose to limit our
exposure to these distractions

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:29.430
and we can choose to use them to fight
back the initial results for cognitive

00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:30.700
therapy games

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:34.790
are promising and things can only improve
from there.

00:04:34.790 --> 00:04:38.600
So in addition to my texting, tweeting, and
facebooking

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:42.880
it looks like I'll be gaming as well so
why don't you join

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:46.660
me. Grab a controller, let's start pwning

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:51.770
these noobs?

00:04:51.770 --> 00:04:55.500
