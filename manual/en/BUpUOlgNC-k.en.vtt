Hey guys! Welcome to Play Along! My name is Palmer.

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:32.520
I was just gettin' my ukulele out. It's kinda
like a guitar, but it's a little bit different.

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:38.140
There's only four strings. And it's a lot
smaller. And there's a lot fewer frets. And

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:41.840
it has a completely different sound. 

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:45.800
We were, uh, just takin' a bus trip to GoodnessKnowsWhere.

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:52.630
That's a town that's 3 miles south. Uh, and
we're uh, gonna sing a song, I think. Yeah.

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:59.630
When do we not? To try to curb the boredom.
Of a road trip. To WhoKnowsWhere. GoodnessKnowsWhere!

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:06.420
To GoodnessKnowsWhere. WhoKnowsWhere is that
way. Ah! I'm so bad with directions. Good

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:12.180
