00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:05.070
Minecraft, the voxel sandbox game that gave
players true creative power.

00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:08.499
That took over the world and became the faith
of every 10 year old.

00:00:08.499 --> 00:00:12.030
And that has been covered to death in videos,
wikis and articles.

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.049
Surely, there is nothing more to say about
it.

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:16.590
But, somewhere.
Underground.

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.070
In the darkest shadows.
In the deepest mines.

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:28.070
Below the bedrock layer.
Lies Minecraft's greatest secret...

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:35.770
Another block-based game that looks just like
Minecraft and just like its other clones in

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:41.230
Total Miner and FortressCraft, except Infiniminer
is no clone.

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:46.930
Infiniminer predates Minecraft.
So, if Infiniminer is the original voxel sandbox

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:53.030
game does that make Minecraft the clone?
If it had the same concept, why did Minecraft

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:58.260
become the world's most popular game and
Infiniminer fade into obscurity?

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:03.260
If you want to find out stay tuned as we tell
you the story of Infiniminer: the original

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:04.000
Minecraft.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:19.900
To start, let's go back to the year 2009
And specifically to the 29th of April; a month

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:24.630
before Minecraft was released.
It was on this day that Infiniminer was first

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.380
released to the public by Zachtronic Industries;
the banner under which American developer

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:33.880
Zachary Barth makes games.
At the time, Barth had already made numerous

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:39.010
non-commercial games, which although not incredibly
popular, had developed a small yet dedicated

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:42.600
following to his creations.
But none of that compared to the buzz that

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:48.530
begun to gather around his newest game Infiniminer.
Even with the games many bugs and compatibility

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:52.400
issues, the potential of Infiniminer was immediately
obvious.

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:56.990
Also immediate was how it's terrific social
gameplay addicted players to the game.

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:01.119
For proof of the game's popularity, one
need only look at the comments on the original

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:04.979
Infiniminer page.
After the initial release, Barth continued

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:10.280
to patch the game through a series of updates.
But then something happened, something that

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:15.610
would be the downfall of Infiniminer.
The source code was leaked.

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:20.200
Barth forgot to obfuscate the game's code,
which allowed hackers to get a hold of it.

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.459
With the leaked code, other people could make
modifications to the game.

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:29.020
And that's what happened. Numerous modified
versions of Infiniminer were made; all of

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:34.030
which were incompatible with another.
This divided the community across different

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.950
servers; reducing the integral multiplayer
scene that Barth had primarily made the game

00:02:38.950 --> 00:02:42.080
to have.
Having lost control of his project, Barth

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:47.050
officially made Infiniminer an open source
game on May 16; leaving Infiniminer's future

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:51.580
and development in the hands of the community.
So after less than a month, Infiniminer was

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:54.810
cancelled; never to be finished.
But before we go

00:02:54.810 --> 00:03:00.019
on with Infiniminer, let's go back 3 days
to May 13, when Infiniminer's source code

00:03:00.019 --> 00:03:04.000
had already been leaked.
On this particular day, a video called 'cave

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.069
game tech test' was put up on YouTube.
This simple exhibition of a grass and stone

00:03:09.069 --> 00:03:13.330
block world is actually the public's first
ever look at what would become Minecraft.

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:18.950
This video is also significant because of
what Notch, under another pseudonym Nizzotch,

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:23.120
wrote in the description.
He described his 'cave game tech test'

00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:28.580
as a, quote, 'Infiniminer clone'.
This has become a highly contentious point

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:31.909
amongst gamers, but we're gonna leave it just
for a second.

00:03:31.909 --> 00:03:37.840
Carrying on, 3 days after the 'cave game
tech test', Notch posted another video entitled

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:41.319
'Minecraft Progress'
The video features a lot of dancing Steve's,

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:45.510
as well as the creation of a house and an
overall more developed game.

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:49.709
The day after Minecraft was released and well,
the rest is history.

00:03:49.709 --> 00:03:54.629
Anyhow, back to Notch's comment; is Minecraft
a clone of Infiniminer?

00:03:54.629 --> 00:03:59.840
In short, the answer is no.
What are you talking about? Notch even admitted

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:03.739
it was.
Well no, he didn't actually; he only admitted

00:04:03.739 --> 00:04:09.370
that cave game tech test was a clone, not
Minecraft. Cave game tech test was a raw prototype

00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:14.970
that became Minecraft.
OK, but Minecraft still looks a lot like Infiniminer,

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:20.109
surely Notch ripped off Barth?
Yes they do look similar, but they're fundamentally

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:27.089
different games. To put simply, when comparing
Infiniminer to Minecraft...

00:04:27.089 --> 00:04:34.059
Ok, maybe that was more confusing than helpful,

00:04:34.059 --> 00:04:38.400
but the assumption made is that Infiniminer's
superior to Minecraft because it's more

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:41.020
limited.
And when actually comparing the games, that

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:45.080
assertion stacks up, except for the superior
part.

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:49.300
Infiniminer is a team-based competitive game,
in which players can be one of four different

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:52.939
miner classes.
The objective of the game is to go underground

00:04:52.939 --> 00:04:57.039
to mine minerals and bring them back up to
the surface; the team that gets to the target

00:04:57.039 --> 00:05:00.819
first wins.
It also had an additional sandbox mode in

00:05:00.819 --> 00:05:04.569
allowed for construction, but was limited
in terms of materials.

00:05:04.569 --> 00:05:09.979
Swedish journalists Daniel Goldberg and Linus
Larsson claimed in their 2013 book 'Minecraft:

00:05:09.979 --> 00:05:14.099
The tale of Markus 'Notch' Persson and
the game that changed everything', that

00:05:14.099 --> 00:05:18.789
this sandbox mode was in fact the driving
force behind the game's popularity.

00:05:18.789 --> 00:05:21.110
Minecraft is obviously a different game to
Infiniminer.

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:26.550
For starters, it's not competitive or team-based;
it's both single and multiplayer, has prominent

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:31.479
survival and exploration aspects, crafting
and a greater focus on building.

00:05:31.479 --> 00:05:36.499
If you want you can list the different resources,
weapons, tools, biomes, traps, MOBs and blocks

00:05:36.499 --> 00:05:41.999
and how Minecraft is the game that basically
allows you to do whatever you want.

00:05:41.999 --> 00:05:47.129
Infiniminer doesn't do that. So although
Minecraft started out as an Infiniminer clone,

00:05:47.129 --> 00:05:52.399
it became something else; its own game.
But the mark Infiniminer left is undeniable,

00:05:52.399 --> 00:05:56.309
and not to be forgotten.
The block world, relative dimensions, mining

00:05:56.309 --> 00:06:01.039
theme, and randomly generated worlds of Infiniminer
are all apparent in Minecraft.

00:06:01.039 --> 00:06:05.960
In our opinion, Infiniminer is a forerunner
to Minecraft; an influence like Dwarf Fortress

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:11.189
and Dungeon Keeper both are, only more obvious.
The person who has the most right to be aggrieved

00:06:11.189 --> 00:06:16.689
by this, Zachary Barth, who 'felt nothing
but disgust in the pit of his stomach' after

00:06:16.689 --> 00:06:19.569
the hacking of Infiniminer, has only this
to say;

00:06:19.569 --> 00:06:24.589
"The act of borrowing ideas is integral
to the creative process. There are games that

00:06:24.589 --> 00:06:29.080
came before Infiniminer, and there are games
that will come after Minecraft. That's how

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:32.119
it works."
He's even referred to how Infiniminer was

00:06:32.119 --> 00:06:37.490
inspired by his earlier game Infinifrag, Team
Fortress 2 and the flash game Motherload.

00:06:37.490 --> 00:06:41.319
If you really want, you can trace borrowed
ideas back to the beginning of time. It's

00:06:41.319 --> 00:06:45.429
not going to do you any good.
If it wasn't for Notch and his Minecraft,

00:06:45.429 --> 00:06:48.879
the potential surfaced by Infiniminer would
never have been realised.

00:06:48.879 --> 00:06:53.709
And if it wasn't for Infiniminer, Minecraft
would never have existed or at least not as

00:06:53.709 --> 00:06:57.279
we know it.
And if Minecraft didn't exist, well, we

00:06:57.279 --> 00:07:02.179
wouldn't be here now, and Infiniminer would
have been lost forever, at least in some way

00:07:02.179 --> 00:07:06.429
it lives on. So let us try and take some solace
in that.

00:07:06.429 --> 00:07:11.199
But what do you guys think? How much of an
influence was Infiniminer on Minecraft? Let

00:07:11.199 --> 00:07:12.460
us know in the comments below.
