00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.450
Hi everybody, welcome to this
Line 6 Relay G90 demo.

00:00:05.451 --> 00:00:12.000
Thi sis the top of the Relay line, wireless
systems based on wifi technology,

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:15.000
it's rather revolutionary and
works quite well.

00:00:15.001 --> 00:00:22.001
The G90 has a transmission range of 100m
and can work on 12 different channels,

00:00:22.002 --> 00:00:26.400
which means that twelve G90 can work
simultaneously without interference,

00:00:26.401 --> 00:00:29.301
since the wifi signal is encrypted.

00:00:29.302 --> 00:00:35.000
You can clip the transmitter
on your strap.

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:43.500
Then we have the receiver, with
Channel Select and Cable Tone,

00:00:43.501 --> 00:00:53.000
to simulate the frequency loss  of a 3, 5 or
10 meters guitar cord (if you really miss it ;-)

00:00:54.600 --> 00:01:02.001
then a wheel and two switches to choose,
validate and exit the parameters edition mode.

00:01:02.002 --> 00:01:06.600
Removable antennas, that you can
plug on the front or on the back,

00:01:06.601 --> 00:01:17.000
And now, let's do a little walk
upstairs to see how it works.

00:01:20.001 --> 00:01:22.001
Follow me!

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:17.200
As you can see it works very well, we've
reached the street with zero sound issue,

00:02:17.201 --> 00:02:20.500
a very neat wireless system.

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:29.501
Back to the basement, so this is a
very efficient wireless system,

00:02:29.502 --> 00:02:37.702
and my only con is about this specific
cable, you're obliged to use,

00:02:37.703 --> 00:02:44.400
would have been cool to be able
to use a regular cable,

00:02:44.401 --> 00:02:50.401
 like with the G30 transmitter.
Time to say goodbye,

00:02:50.402 --> 00:02:53.700
and see you soon!

00:02:53.701 --> 00:02:54.840
