00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:15.340
Welcome to the installation video of the Aries front and rear fender flares on a 2015 Jeep Wrangler.

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:21.720
These fender flares are available in a raw aluminum or textured black finish.

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:27.860
During this installation, we will be using a lift; however the use of a lift is not required.

00:00:27.860 --> 00:00:31.680
These are the tools  needed to complete the installation.

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:46.140
Starting on the front fenders, remove the inner fender well using a 10mm socket to remove all hex head bolts.

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:09.120
Remove all push in retainers being careful
not to damage the plastic inner fender flair.

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:19.600
Once removed, set the inner fender aside.

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.240
Next, disconnect the side marker light.

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:38.640
Remove the plastic fender flare support by
removing the hex head bolts holding it in place.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.440
At this point, you should be able to pull the stock fender flare from the body of the Jeep.

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:54.400
Hold the inner fender flare in place and mark evenly along the body.

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:02.000
Cut to fit using a rotary tool or knife, and set aside.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:08.101
To insure the best fit, we recommended trimming a little at a time, making sure not to over cut.

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:13.440
Place the new Aries fender up against the body and align the mounting holes.

00:02:13.498 --> 00:02:17.738
Use the factory metal brace to help balancing the fender flare.

00:02:17.738 --> 00:02:21.916
Identify the matching holes from the Aries fender and the original holes.

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:28.880
Mark the locations where drilling is needed.  In our example, we did not need to do any additional drilling.

00:02:30.185 --> 00:02:37.185
Remove the flare and drill holes if needed, to fit the threaded metal inserts supplied with your Aries fenders.

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:42.480
Using a thread setter, thread a 6 millimeter metal insert onto the end.

00:02:42.585 --> 00:02:48.825
Insert this into the mounting locations, and crush the insert until it fully expands.

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:56.080
Repeat this process  for the rest of the mounting locations.

00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:08.160
Place the fender back into place, and attach using a 6 millimeter bolt, locking and flat washers.

00:03:13.488 --> 00:03:18.608
Reinstall the inner fender well using the stock hardware where applicable.

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:30.640
To ensure a tighter fit, additional fastening may be required with non-supplied zip ties.

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:37.360
Tighten down all hardware with a 10 millimeter socket.

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:44.160
Repeat this process on the passenger side.

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:12.160
Installation on the rear fender is very similar to the front

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:18.763
Start by removing all the push in retainers, once again being careful not to damage the plastic inner fender flare.

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:22.640
Once this is done, remove the stock fender flare.

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:33.680
Hold the Aries rear fender against the body, checking alignment with factory holes, and mark the mounting locations.

00:04:38.279 --> 00:04:43.319
In our example, one of our mounting points did not line up with a factory hole

00:04:43.319 --> 00:04:49.108
Using an 11-32 inch drill bit, drill a hole at the marked location for the new mounting point.

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:54.480
Check to make sure that the threaded metal insert will fit.

00:04:54.480 --> 00:05:01.520
Insert and attach the threaded inserts with the thread setter, as was previously done on the front fender.

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:06.800
Hold the plastic inner fender flare in place and mark for trimming.

00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:09.760
Cut carefully and check the fit.

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:12.720
Place the flare aside when finished.

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:19.316
Lift the Aries rear fender into place, and thread on the supplied 6 millimeter bolt, locking and flat washers.

00:05:21.213 --> 00:05:28.813
Reinstall the plastic inner fender flare, and attach with the factory fasteners where applicable.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.880
Additional attachment might be needed with non-supplied zip ties.

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:45.760
Tighten all hardware with a 10 millimeter socket.

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:50.800
Repeat this process on the other side.

00:06:11.137 --> 00:06:17.137
Remember to do periodic inspection to make sure that all the hardware is secure and tight.

00:06:17.137 --> 00:06:23.760
Congratulations on completing the installation of your brand new Aries 4 inch fender flares.
