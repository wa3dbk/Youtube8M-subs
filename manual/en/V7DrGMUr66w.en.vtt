00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:09.750
This is Hunting YouTube, which aims to show
the best hunting, shooting and fishing videos

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:11.450
that YouTube has to offer.

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:17.250
In Pigeon Shooting Decoying Turns into Crow
Calling over decoys uk 2013, VarminterUK gets

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.421
a touch of the sun and starts to make cawing
noises to attract crows. Does it work? Watch

00:00:22.421 --> 00:00:24.220
the film to find out.

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:30.000
Let�s go to Australia, where Mickott is
whistling in foxes close. He was hoping to

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.320
call in a wild dog so he let this one go.
Fox scalps are only worth $10 and dogs are

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:40.289
worth $100. In hind sight, he says, I should
have taken the fox as no dogs turned up.

00:00:40.289 --> 00:00:44.719
Moving to the US and, in this quick clip,
Craig Canty shows excellent fieldcraft and

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:49.050
bowhunting skills, shooting this animal right
in the head, a �hot spot� for foxes.

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.750
Not a perfect situation - he is trolling after
all - but salmon fishing on the Tay, Perthshire,

00:00:53.750 --> 00:01:00.170
Scotland 2013 by Robert White, shows the happy
event: a spring salmon being hooked, played

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.139
and returned on the Pitlochry beat at Stanley.

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:07.680
Moving to Florida and this really isn�t
perfect but it is compelling. Kayaker Jim

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:14.620
Van Pelt lands a 100lb+ Goliath Grouper by
hand line in South-West Florida while fishing

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:15.980
from a kayak.

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:20.690
Now we love Joe Rogan. He tweeted about one
of our films the other day and brought it

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:25.460
loads of views. Here he is with ace hunter
and TV game butcher Steven Rinella learning

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:30.470
how to gralloch a deer or, as the Americans
put it, gut a deer. It�s a straightforward,

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:35.230
useful film and, for some reason, YouTube
has age-restricted it. MeatEaterTV goes out

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:38.490
on The Sportsman Channel and is mustard on
meat handling.

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.420
Sent in by our viewer Norbert from Transylvania,
if you want to see how they do driven wild

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:49.630
boar in Romania, watch Boar Hunting 2011.
It is NineInchFly's wild boar hunting compilation

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:55.620
in 2011. Again, age restricted, even though
they are doing nothing unusual on this film.

00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:00.870
NH MH writes to me to say: "In Finland we
use hounds for rabbit hunting," and points

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:05.250
me to his Finnish hound in action, putting
up a hare. Wonderful sight but, I can�t

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.030
help thinking, hopeless cause.

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:10.310
You can click on any of these films to watch
them. If you have a YouTube film you would

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:15.739
like us to pop in to the weekly top eight,
send it in via YouTube, or email me the link
