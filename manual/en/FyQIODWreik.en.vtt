00:00:10.771 --> 00:00:16.920
I think driving at night is fun. The
roads are empty and you can speed up.

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.333
Officially, you have to stick to the speed limit.

00:00:21.225 --> 00:00:27.897
This gives us the opportunity to demonstrate
the Ford Mondeo's adaptive LED headlights.

00:00:28.685 --> 00:00:37.377
I hear you thinking we only joke about LEDs,
being characteristic for a facelift.

00:00:37.377 --> 00:00:45.616
However, LED technology in headlights is useful.
You can switch individual LEDs on and off.

00:00:45.616 --> 00:00:52.295
This creates a specific light beam which
suits the situation you find yourself in.

00:00:57.368 --> 00:01:01.944
In the headlights you used to have
city lights, low beams and high beams.

00:01:01.944 --> 00:01:06.031
Often you couldn't use the high beams because
of oncoming traffic. You had to switch them off.

00:01:06.031 --> 00:01:12.210
A lot of people forgot that and blind someone.
This doesn't have to happen in a modern car.

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:18.152
It has adaptive high beams. If there's
oncoming traffic, the light is dimmed.

00:01:18.152 --> 00:01:25.872
But, that's not the only thing. The Mondeo's
adaptive LED headlights recognize 7 situations.

00:01:25.872 --> 00:01:33.348
On urban roads you don't need a far-reaching
light beam, but you do on the highway.

00:01:33.348 --> 00:01:40.817
Over 68 mph the headlight is angled upwards,
so it lights your road further ahead.

00:01:40.817 --> 00:01:49.283
In the city I'm sometimes looking for a street,
number or parking spot (you too?).

00:01:49.283 --> 00:01:55.006
You want a wider light then. In corners
the light turns along with you.

00:01:55.006 --> 00:02:00.029
This doesn't seem much,
until you pay attention to it.

00:02:00.029 --> 00:02:04.777
Especially on camera you see
the lights follow the bend.

00:02:04.777 --> 00:02:11.425
These things help when you're
driving winding roads in the dark often.

00:02:16.077 --> 00:02:19.398
Now you have learned something
about modern light technology.

00:02:19.398 --> 00:02:28.179
If you think this test could be done better by
you and you want to drive a new Mondeo,

00:02:28.179 --> 00:02:34.400
register yourself. An URL will appear down
here. If you click it, you can register yourself.

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:41.228
Together, we will test the Mondeo. Unless you're
doing such a good job and you won't need me.

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:51.300
