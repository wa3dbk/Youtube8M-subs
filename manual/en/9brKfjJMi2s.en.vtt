00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:17.360
This is Mel Casas' "Humanscape 62," which is a painting that he executed in 1970.

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:22.360
This painting, which comes from a larger series of works called "Humanscapes,"

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:28.940
were actually inspired by Casas' experience seeing a drive-in movie screen

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:32.940
and seeing these huge images of people and things.

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:36.760
This painting is divided into three different sections:

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:43.080
the large screen image, which recalls old-fashioned televisions.

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:45.620
You see it's slightly bowed at each end.

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:52.880
Here he depicts a large plate of yummy brownies as they might appear in a television commercial.

00:00:53.320 --> 00:01:00.300
Many of the references that he includes in this painting refer to things that are, in one way or another,

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.020
associated with brown cultures.

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:12.520
Brown is a very complex word that started to be used in the late 60s and early 70s,

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:17.940
and that includes both Mexican-Americans and indigenous people from the Americas.

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:31.000
In this painting, what he's done is he's captured a series of sort of trivialized snippets drawn from American popular culture and the Southwest.

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:36.720
The painting was inspired by a stereotypical character, the Frito Bandito,

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:43.060
which was the mascot for Frito-Lay corn chips in the late 1960s.

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:46.060
This figure was highly offensive.

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:56.040
He spoke broken English and was based on the sort of image of the Mexican outlaw found in American film.

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:08.380
What Casas has done is to blend that reference to the Frito Bandito with other sort of trivialized references drawn from U.S. and Southwest cultures.

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:15.140
For example, on the left-hand side we see a Native American in profile.

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:22.700
On the right, we see a group of what could be either Native or Mexican-American women.

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:25.860
One wears a scarf over her head.

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:30.980
Others appear to wear rebozos, which is a kind of shawl worn by Mexican women.

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:36.880
In addition, we have other sort of trivialized references right in the foreground.

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:41.380
We have an image of a junior Girl Scout, or a Brownie.

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:52.420
He blends all of these references with allusions to actual objects drawn from Mesoamerican culture.

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:58.720
On the lower register of the painting, you see this double-headed jade pendant,

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:03.800
and it's an Aztec work of art that is made entirely of jade.

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:12.240
The Frito Bandito is riding another figure that is based on a jade statuette.

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:21.920
What Casas has done is that he's merged, or he's combined, these references with really deep references to indigenous culture

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:32.940
to really question the ways in which American popular culture has demeaned brown cultures be they Mexican-American or indigenous.

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:46.920
