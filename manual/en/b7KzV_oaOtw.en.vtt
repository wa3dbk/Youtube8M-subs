00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:28.949
Nowadays, something actually scary is very
hard to come across.

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:35.559
Movies have lost it almost completely, with
the occasional exception of such gems as Sinister,

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:40.239
and games' attempt at �horror� are pretty
much laughable.

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:46.530
And then, a simple little indie game called
Slender made its debut about two years ago.

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:49.410
There's barely anything to the game itself.

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.940
Your mission is simple, should you choose
to accept it (since for some reason you just

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.340
can't turn your ass around and jump over the
bloody fence): You go around a dark forest

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:02.930
at night finding eight pages stuck to various
things such as trees, rocks, or broken down

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:04.140
trucks.

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:05.420
Simple enough, right?

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:09.670
Except all the while, as you collect more
and more pages, you have a mysterious, tall

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:15.420
figure following you, coming closer and closer
with each passing moment.

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:21.060
I still have never been able to pinpoint what
exactly is so terrifying about this game,

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.700
but whatever it is, it works.

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:29.329
As you progress, the music becomes more known,
you start hearing static as Slender Man comes

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:36.040
closer to you, and the screen will occasionally
blink in and out if he's close enough.

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:55.759
The worst part of it is it's literally impossible
to find him; you just know he's there.

00:01:55.759 --> 00:02:00.250
Because of the nature of the game, its gameplay
is very simplistic; you run.

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:01.850
And run.

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:02.850
AND RUNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNNN.

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:04.600
Oh, and click to get the pages.

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:08.670
For what the game is, however, there's nothing
more that's even needed except the barebones

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.140
type of gameplay that you'll actually find.

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:16.610
Once again, this is horror through and through,
and survival horror at that; besides, shooting

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:20.230
Slender Man would be a futile effort since
he would probably just chew them up in his

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:24.400
spirit demon god mouth and spit them back
at you in the form of acid.

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.690
Really, the only thing that can fight Slender
Man is Chuck Norris.

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:30.470
And possibly Kyle Katarn.

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:36.620
If you enjoy horror or random games, give
Slender a try, because unless you're made

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:42.680
of steel I can guarantee that this'll get
a scare or two out of you, and maybe, just

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.450
maybe, even a yelp of terror.

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:51.480
So this is Jon from CGRUndertow wishing you
good Slender: The Arrival, and good Dead Space,

00:02:51.480 --> 00:03:00.709
or whatever makes you happy.
