00:00:02.590 --> 00:00:10.019
Dan Bell, blueberry geneticist: “I’m going
to do one, two, three, four, five.”

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.090
Narrator: “Dr. Dan Bell studies blueberry
genetics at the University of Maine.”

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:15.990
Jeffrey Stott, biology student: “We use
the tuning forks because they’re at about

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.780
the same frequency at which a bumblebee will
beat its wings when it goes near the flowers

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:28.689
so pollen will kind of shake out and then
land on the bee, and then the bee will take

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:29.689
it with it.”

00:00:29.689 --> 00:00:33.719
Narrator: “Without pollination, blueberries
would never turn into blueberries, and plants

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:40.670
could not produce viable seeds. Dan Bell hand-pollinates
blueberry flowers, one at a time, to get a

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:45.540
better understanding of their genetics. Pollination
is a way for plants to spread their genes

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:50.940
around and to increase their genetic diversity.
A plant might produce different numbers of

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.650
berries depending on the pollen it receives.”

00:00:53.650 --> 00:01:00.341
Bell: “In two cases, the lowest producer
in each of two fields did poorly in their

00:01:00.341 --> 00:01:05.000
own natural environment and were bumped up
significantly in yield by being pollinated

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.020
by any of the other three male siring environments
in that field.”

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:13.520
Narrator: “So receiving pollen from certain
individuals increased the number of berries

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:19.950
a plant produced. Dan also has confirmed that
some individuals produce a lot of berries

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.639
no matter what pollen they receive, even if
it’s pollen from themselves. He calls these

00:01:25.639 --> 00:01:26.639
‘good selfers.’”

00:01:26.639 --> 00:01:32.849
Bell: “What we found was that knowing the
self-fertility on the x-axis was a good predictor

00:01:32.849 --> 00:01:35.729
of the general outcross yield of that clone.”

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:40.200
Narrator: “Learning about how a plant fits
into the ecosystem can help growers determine

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:46.259
how best to manage their fields. For example,
although low-bush blueberries were never planted,

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:50.780
growers could use this knowledge to decide
how best to fill bare spots in their fields.”

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:56.780
Bell: “Now we can say with some degree of
experimental evidence, ‘If you do this,

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:01.630
you’ll double your chances of filling in
those bare areas with good yielders.’”

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:07.020
Narrator: “Dan also looks at how blueberry
plants, known as clones, are related to each

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:11.700
other. They say the apple doesn’t fall far
from the tree, but that might not be true

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:17.620
for low-bush blueberries. The roots of a blueberry
bush are like thick mats, difficult for a

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:23.049
seed to penetrate. So how do blueberries get
their seeds to new locations? And how far

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:24.269
are the seeds traveling?”

00:02:24.269 --> 00:02:34.450
Bell: “We found that out about 12.5 kilometers,
clones become less related, and that kind

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:41.230
of agrees with what we see as the distances
that birds, migratory robins and bears may

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:42.230
travel.”

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:48.080
Narrator: “This year, Dan is studying blueberries
within a field that bloom at different times.”

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:53.620
Bell: “All the plants in this field don’t
bloom at the same time; they stagger over

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:54.620
time.”

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:59.560
Narrator: “Are those that bloom earlier
better selfers? His reasoning is that the

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:04.069
early bloomers might have adapted to do well
by self-pollination, since not many others

00:03:04.069 --> 00:03:10.459
are flowering at that time. Earlies also may
be more effectively pollinated, since they

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:12.409
are the only food source available to bees.”

00:03:12.409 --> 00:03:18.080
Bell: “They’re flying all in and around
a single clone, affecting basically self-pollinations.

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:25.299
So it may be to that clone’s advantage to
be a good selfer in that situation, because

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:26.420
that’s all they’re getting.

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:30.800
Narrator: “Dan continues to study blueberry
genetics out of both the Univeristy of Maine

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:32.463
in Orono and the USDA in Maryland.”

00:03:32.463 --> 00:03:33.463
This study is being conducted by Dr. Daniel
J. Bell and Dr. Lisa J. Rowland for the USDA-ARS

00:03:33.463 --> 00:03:34.463
Genetic Improvement of Fruits and Vegetables
Laboratory and by Dr. Francis A. Drummond

00:03:34.463 --> 00:03:35.463
of the School of Biology and Ecology, University
of Maine.

00:03:35.463 --> 00:03:36.463
The assistance of three University of Maine
undergraduate students is greatly appreciated:
