Welcome to How To Cook That 
I am Ann Reardon and

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:07.940
today we are going to make chocolate feathers.  To do this firstly feel if your bench is cold, if it is you are going to need to 

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:11.700
put something on it first to make sure your chocolate doesn't set too quickly

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.990
I'm using a silpat but you can use a book or a wad of paper.

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:19.519
Anything that's gonna insulate it from the
coldness of the bench.

00:00:19.519 --> 00:00:21.869
Next take a sheet of non-stick paper

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.049
And you are going to need some white chocolate in a ziplock bag.

00:00:25.049 --> 00:00:29.739
Push your chocolate to one corner, twist the bag and cut off the top.

00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:33.480
and then pipe lines onto your non-stick baking paper.

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.580
Now you need to use either tempered chocolate of fake chocolate.  If you are not sure what I  

00:00:36.580 --> 00:00:41.430
mean by that then click on show more int eh description below this video

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.920
and click on chocolate tutorials and that will take you to the video playlist for chocolate.

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:49.890
There is one there on how to temper chocoalte and another on what chocoalte to use 

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.810
for chocolate decorations.

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:54.730
if you want your feathers bent over then make sure you pipe

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:57.170
your line bent.

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:01.860
place the other sheet of baking paper
over the top and using your thumb or

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:06.770
finger gently push it out into shape
Now it helps if you have a picture of the

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:11.700
feather that you want to make in front of
you so that you can make sure it's the right shape.

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.050
Peel off the top sheet of your baking paper and put that to one side.

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:18.680
If you want to make a pointy end feather use a knife to sharpen one 

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:19.840
end of it.

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:24.410
Then take a wooden skewer and draw chunks that you want to actually cut out of the feather

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:29.050
Then mess up the base of the feather where it si fluffy by pushing the skewer in and out.

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:33.030
Then very lightly scratch the surface of the feather

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.250
To get that textured look.

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:40.180
So again, draw the chunks that you want missing, fluff up the base and then scratch the

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:41.570
surface.

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:44.659
Take you bag of white chocolate and pipe a line down the feathers, keeping in mind

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:48.799
that on a feather that's often offset
slightly to one side.  Again that's where

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:53.049
having a photo of what you're wanting to make
will help you make it more realistic. If

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:57.430
you want to you can then add extra whisps of chocolate around the base section.

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:01.810
by now the top sheet that you peel off that chocolate is going to be set.

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:06.490
But you can still use it to make feathers.  Just turn your skewer over and use the blunt end 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:09.109
to scratch the texture into the surface.

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:11.669
and then pipe down the middle like you did
before

00:02:11.669 --> 00:02:15.770
if you want chunks out of them then you have to
use the pointy end to scratch away

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:17.269
some of the chocolate.

00:02:17.269 --> 00:02:19.839
Once they are set let them firm up in the fridge.

00:02:19.839 --> 00:02:24.540
To colour them you can either colour your chocolate before you start using oil based colors. 

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:28.809
You need to use oil based otherwise the water in the liquid colors will cause it to seize up.

00:02:28.809 --> 00:02:30.019
or

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:33.569
you can use powdered colours like I am going to show you here.

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:35.109
so you can use a mixture of colors 

00:02:35.109 --> 00:02:39.740
because often feathers are more than one colour.  If you want that shine to them then  

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:41.879
add some lustre dust

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:44.230
which you can buy at cake decorating stores.

00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:46.870
Then you can use them to garnish your cake or your dessert.

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:47.930
