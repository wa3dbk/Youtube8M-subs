00:00:00.117 --> 00:00:01.329
- What's up, everybody?

00:00:01.329 --> 00:00:02.961
Today we're making this,

00:00:02.961 --> 00:00:04.922
Spicy Vodka Gummy Bears.

00:00:04.922 --> 00:00:06.791
And you're not gonna be disappointed.

00:00:06.791 --> 00:00:09.022
So, to make this dish with Gummy Bears,

00:00:09.022 --> 00:00:10.367
we will need Gummy Bears,

00:00:10.367 --> 00:00:12.423
the Green Apple Vodka and Fireball.

00:00:12.423 --> 00:00:14.106
- [Tipsy Bartender] That's
what I'm talking about.

00:00:14.106 --> 00:00:16.741
So we get a bowl, pour in some Gummy Bears

00:00:16.741 --> 00:00:18.320
and then you add what?

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.187
- Then you get them into alcohol bath.

00:00:21.187 --> 00:00:22.984
with Green Apple Vodka and Fireball.

00:00:22.984 --> 00:00:24.241
- [Tipsy Bartender] Exactly.

00:00:24.241 --> 00:00:26.041
In here we'll mix, just
pour it over, okay?

00:00:26.041 --> 00:00:28.607
And then you seal it up and
you let it sit, how long?

00:00:28.607 --> 00:00:29.637
- [Inna] Overnight.

00:00:29.637 --> 00:00:31.042
- Exactly.

00:00:33.939 --> 00:00:35.274
And there you have it!

00:00:35.274 --> 00:00:36.537
- Dammit.

00:00:36.537 --> 00:00:39.031
- Spicy Vodka Gummy Bears.

00:00:40.939 --> 00:00:41.771
Go ahead.

00:00:41.771 --> 00:00:43.119
- Did you wash you hands when you put

00:00:43.119 --> 00:00:45.026
this bears in with all this stuff?

00:00:45.026 --> 00:00:46.551
- It in alcohol, it's clean now.

00:00:46.551 --> 00:00:48.218
- Okay.

00:00:48.218 --> 00:00:50.086
I want the red one.

00:00:50.086 --> 00:00:52.800
- I try not to play with
myself before I mix (mumbles).

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.297
(laughs)
- Good. (laughs)

00:00:57.665 --> 00:00:58.846
Mmm...

00:00:58.846 --> 00:01:00.323
- Can you taste the spice?

00:01:00.323 --> 00:01:03.167
- Mmm. It is really, really good.

00:01:03.167 --> 00:01:05.918
That's how the bears
should be sold actually.

00:01:05.918 --> 00:01:07.683
- Really? With that spicy flavor to it?

00:01:07.683 --> 00:01:10.098
- Mm hmm, with alcohol.

00:01:10.098 --> 00:01:10.972
- Yes.

00:01:10.972 --> 00:01:12.311
It's kinda an original creation,

00:01:12.311 --> 00:01:14.557
cause it's, like, man,
you do it with Vodka,

00:01:14.557 --> 00:01:16.008
but what if you could
get Fireball in there?

00:01:16.008 --> 00:01:17.680
Cause Fireball real hot, right now.

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:20.118
So that would be real
good to mix that one in.

00:01:20.118 --> 00:01:21.106
You like it?

00:01:21.106 --> 00:01:23.402
- Yeah, what are you gonna
do with the whole bowl?

00:01:23.402 --> 00:01:24.490
- You taking it home with you.

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:25.986
This look real good, oh my god.

00:01:25.986 --> 00:01:27.189
- Why are they bears?

00:01:27.189 --> 00:01:28.930
Why are they not like horses,

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:32.025
or squirrels, or dolphins?

00:01:32.025 --> 00:01:33.859
Why those bears?

00:01:34.383 --> 00:01:35.781
No, that's a legit question.
- That is a really

00:01:35.781 --> 00:01:37.271
profound question.

00:01:37.271 --> 00:01:39.255
Fucking question is
that? I don't know, okay?

00:01:39.255 --> 00:01:40.834
I don't know. Just eat the shit, okay?

00:01:40.834 --> 00:01:42.738
It's science, goddammit.

00:01:42.738 --> 00:01:44.152
Tipsy Bartender!

00:01:44.152 --> 00:01:46.294
- Tipsy Bartender. Wa-wooo!

00:01:46.294 --> 00:01:47.366
- [Tipsy Bartender] Why are they bears?

00:01:47.366 --> 00:01:48.946
Why are they bears?

00:01:48.946 --> 00:01:50.639
What are you like six years old?

00:01:50.639 --> 00:01:52.097
- [Tipsy Bartender]
Germany didn't come in here

00:01:52.097 --> 00:01:53.555
knowing how to do that.

00:01:53.555 --> 00:01:54.952
- Uh, yeah, Germany actually did

00:01:54.952 --> 00:01:56.559
come in here knowing how to do that, okay?

00:01:56.559 --> 00:02:00.146
This is not friggen rocket surgery.

00:02:00.146 --> 00:02:01.818
- [Tipsy Bartender] Rocket science, okay?

00:02:01.818 --> 00:02:03.479
See that? She still don't speak English.

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.248
What real German would ever?
