On behalf of ExpertVillage.com this is Tom
Flowers of Well Tempered Piano Tuning, showing

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:10.950
you how you might clean up your own tuning
on your own piano. A few basic things about

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:18.320
tuning theory, you need to be able to first
of all identify notes. For instance, all of

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:27.849
these notes are C's. Now they should sound
the same but each one will be higher as we

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:30.909
go up the keyboard and lower as we go down
the keyboard. Match tones is something you

00:00:30.909 --> 00:00:35.219
will need to develop. I'm going to play in
this case an F, and first I'm going to get

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:47.359
the irregularity out of that note. It happens
to be in one of these side strings so as I

00:00:47.359 --> 00:00:58.109
place a mute on the left string and play in
the middle against the right itâ€™s basically

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:07.120
fine but as I place a mute against the right
string, there is the ring toning sound. So

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:16.160
I locate the tuning pin corresponding to the
left string and it sounds flat, or too low,

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:25.260
so I'm going to pull the hammer towards me
until the sound goes slightly above the previous

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:45.830
pitch and I'll drop it down. Now that we have
equalized that, we can compare it to the next

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:53.910
step which has alot of problems. So I'm going
to isolate down to one string, and that left

00:01:53.910 --> 00:02:08.520
string is quite flat, then pull the hammer
towards me, now that I have the one string

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:26.370
in tune I can listen to the next string against
it. Until it equalizes and finally the last

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:39.400
string, and now we have all three of the trichord
that is the F chord, in tune.
