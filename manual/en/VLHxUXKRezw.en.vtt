00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:06.229
One of the highest valued features for an
AutoCAD user who has migrated to AutoCAD Architecture,

00:00:06.229 --> 00:00:11.410
has to be its ability to draw construction
details faster and easier.

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:17.140
With this amazing toolkit of 2D detail blocks,
known as the "Detail Component Manager",

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:23.540
creating details is less tedious, thanks to
the automated functionality that AutoCAD Architecture

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:26.280
provides
.

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:31.790
The Details Catalog is organized into very
familiar divisions for easy access to the

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:38.790
various categories of building materials.
Additionally, many of the most commonly used

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:46.780
detail components have been integrated into
tool palettes to make them even more readily

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:49.140
accessible.

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:56.120
Furthermore, making modifications is just
as easy. Using the Properties palette existing

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:01.670
detail components can even be replaced by
new ones on the fly - reducing the need

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:08.670
to erase and redraw.

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:21.970
For other components that are not on the tool
palettes, a keyword search can be done in

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:27.510
the vast database. Simply type in the name
of the component that you need, and AutoCAD

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:33.610
Architecture will do the rest.

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:39.240
But the flexibility doesn't stop there! Since
the detail components are basic AutoCAD entities

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.240
such as blocks and linework, you can take
advantage of additional editing functionality

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.880
known as AEC Modify Tools.

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:52.140
With them it is easy to merge, obscure, or
subtract line work to create detail components

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.890
of any shape imaginable.
