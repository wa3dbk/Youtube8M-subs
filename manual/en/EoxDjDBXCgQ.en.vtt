00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:22.160
Sure, there have been puzzle games in the
arcades, and sure, they’ve been on home

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:23.490
consoles, but let’s be honest.

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.519
The true test of any puzzle game is how well
it entertains you on the road.

00:00:27.519 --> 00:00:29.140
It’s been that way since Tetris.

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:32.760
The short-burst, pick-up-and-go action is
ideal for handhelds.

00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:36.780
(And, well, for making people on the bus wonder
what the hell you’re doing.)

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:42.289
So it was only natural that Puzzle Fighter,
full name Super Puzzle Fighter II Turbo (though

00:00:42.289 --> 00:00:46.650
there was no regular-speed, and there was
no Puzzle Fighter 1) would eventually be adapted

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:48.500
to the up-and-coming Game Boy Advance.

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:53.820
And while porting a PlayStation game to the
GBA seems kinda ridiculous in hindsight, the

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:56.190
one part that made it intact was the gameplay.

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:04.460
So at least they had their priorities in order.

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:07.540
For the maybe fifteen of you out there who
haven’t played Puzzle Fighter yet, four

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:11.900
colors of gems fall from the top of the screen
all Puyo Puyo style, though just collecting

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:15.670
a bunch of them together isn’t enough to
remove them from your side of the screen.

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:19.060
They’ll just weld themselves together into
more and more imposing configurations.

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:24.399
Instead, you need to connect a Crash Gem - those
spherical looking ones - to gems of the same

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:28.750
color, which make them shatter and make a
huge mess and make your super-chibi Street

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:32.200
Fighter or Darkstalkers avatar character in
the middle there actually do something.

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.850
Mind, there’s no health bar or anything,
you’re just flinging garbage blocks onto

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.490
your opponent’s side.

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:42.079
But unlike Puyo and somewhat like Puzzle League,
these impediments can not only be removed

00:01:42.079 --> 00:01:46.469
by creating a reaction near them, but will
eventually turn into real gems that can make

00:01:46.469 --> 00:01:50.640
for delayed-reaction combos, further punishing
your opponent for throwing that crap over

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:57.729
here in the first place.

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:01.610
Some aspects are rather weak in this Game
Boy Advance version - the graphics are grainy

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:05.200
to the point that the included artwork is
pretty much illegible, the sound effects are

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:10.179
repetitive and every color, sound test, and
other unlock involves having to take down

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:11.430
a vicious computer opponent.

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:16.069
But you’re on a train, or a long car ride,
and you’ve got nothing but time.

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:21.890
And you don’t care how weird you look, throttling
your GBA (or PSP, with the Capcom Puzzle World

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:23.620
collection).

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:27.819
And as vicious as that computer opponent is,
it’s still damned fun, snatching defeat

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:30.440
from the jaws of victory in this turnabout-laden
game.

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:35.970
That is, until your girlfriend reveals herself
to be a tenth-level Super Puzzle Fighter II

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:42.470
Turbo grand mast...erm... mistress, capable
of decimating the fiercest of opponents with

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:45.099
distressing ease.

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:55.180
You think you know someone...
