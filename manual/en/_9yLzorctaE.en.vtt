00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:07.460
Emily: If you use a power chair or a wheelchair,
you've got lots of different transportation

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:08.460
options.

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.920
Narrator: Riding a TCAT bus can be a great
way to get around.

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:19.060
All TCAT buses are equipped with a ramp or
a lift, and places to secure a wheelchair.

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:25.840
In fact, if you have a disability, and you
receive SSI, SSD or Disabled Veterans' Benefits,

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:28.239
you're eligible to pay half-fare.

00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:31.779
You might also choose to use Gadabout depending
on your trip.

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:36.969
Or you might combine services, riding the
bus for part of your trip and using Gadabout

00:00:36.969 --> 00:00:39.080
for another part.

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:44.140
This can really expand your travel possibilities.

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:50.920
Way2Go's Bus Basics video covers finding out
about bus routes, planning your trip, and

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:54.809
buying and using a swipe-able fare card or
Tcard.

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:59.789
In this video, we'll show you how easy it
is for wheelchair or power chair users to

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:01.829
board and ride the bus.

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.240
When the bus driver pulls up to your stop
and sees you, they'll lower the bus ramp or lift.

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.360
*repetitive beeps*

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.260
Move up the ramp onto the bus.

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:16.200
If the ramp looks too steep, or there are
other equipment issues, let the driver know

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.140
what you need.

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:17.640
Driver: Hey Emily!

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:18.520
Annalise: Hey!

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:19.260
What's up?

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:20.300
How are you doing?

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:25.180
Narrator: After boarding the bus, pay for your
ride with cash or Tcard either at the front

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:28.100
of the bus or directly to the driver.

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:33.340
If needed, the driver will ask other passengers
to shift seats.

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:38.840
The wheelchair spot is located at the front
of the bus, where the driver will secure the chair.

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:43.220
Be sure to let the driver know where you'll
be getting off.

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:47.380
You can then relax and enjoy your ride.

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:53.000
When the bus arrives at your stop, the driver
will release your chair.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.720
Wheel to the ramp and down and off the bus.

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:06.520
If there's no bus route that goes to your
destination, or it's not possible to get to

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:11.390
or from the bus stops you would need to use,
consider using Gadabout for all or part of

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:13.250
your trip.

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:18.530
Gadabout is a rides-by-reservation service
for people with disabilities and older adults

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:20.340
in Tompkins County.

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:27.570
You can find information on Gadabout and ADA
Paratransit services on TCAT's website, www.tcatbus.com,

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:30.970
under the ADA tab.

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:37.030
By combining riding the bus with using Gadabout,
you can go to places in Tompkins County beyond

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:40.620
the reach of a bus route.

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.120
Riding the bus in a wheelchair or power chair
is easy.

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:49.520
TCAT drivers are there to help make the bus work
for you, so you can get where you want to go.

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:52.700
Emily: TCAT and Gadabout get me where I
want to go.
