O.k. In this final clip of the series, we'll
be doing the detailing on the queen. And we'll

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:11.320
start by making sure all of her outer edges
are very clearly defined. Go over them with

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:19.660
a thicker marker. Just so everyone can clearly
see. Where she ends and make her pop off the

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:25.669
page, a little bit more. Which is ultimately
what you want for all your characters. Getting

00:00:25.669 --> 00:00:37.440
in there really, create an edge form. Don't
go too crazy. You don't want to ruin the detailing

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:43.679
you've done. But really, yeah, do what you
can. To make sure that people can clearly

00:00:43.679 --> 00:00:50.750
see the details that you've done. And call
attention to all the right areas. Yes indeed.

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:56.129
Now we'll break at our other, more fine detail
pen. And we'll go into, start to do a few

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:07.360
more details. And let's start with this collar.
This thing just amends more detailing. And

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:15.830
nearly does, just go as crazy as you want.
Make this thing as intricate and detailed

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:32.970
as your heart desires. Kind of, making the
jagged edge there. See, just add some texture

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:45.240
and flavor. Make the thing really kind of,
pop off the page. This is supposed to be one

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:51.910
hell of a collar. Now don't want to go too
crazy. So if you've gone and done that much

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:56.340
detail without a collar. That's why we make
this inner collar part, fairly simple. We

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:03.780
can start to get a little more details, when
we move a little bit further down. Maybe come

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:13.670
in here and give her some well pet placed
buttons. Little lacy frill, going down the

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:29.620
front of her dress, there. See, just do whatever
you can. Just spice up the drawing. Make it

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:53.870
interesting. Add frills and flare. Really
make it stand out, you know. Not bad at all.

00:02:53.870 --> 00:03:00.800
so you see, what I mean. So there, ladies
and gentlemen, is the queen. From head to

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:08.630
toe. Looking very regal and fancy. If I do
say, for myself. And like I said, feel free

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:16.490
to put in as much detail. As you like. Work
your way up and down. Sketch and yeah, just

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:23.800
be creative. you are the designer. Not just
the character. But the look of the character,

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:28.550
as well. And the looks says a lot about who
they end up being as a person. So there you

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:35.760
go. There is the queen and the king. So yeah,
that will wrap up the series. And hope you've

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:40.510
got both of them down, as well as you like.
Always you can always go back. And redo some

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:43.230
of the sections. If you feel the need. But
for the most part, you should be feeling pretty

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:48.040
good at this point. We've got both of them
down. And yeah, hopefully you're happy with

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:52.099
them. Thanks again, for tuning in. And I'll
see you next time.
