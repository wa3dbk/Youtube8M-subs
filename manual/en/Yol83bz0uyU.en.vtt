00:00:22.425 --> 00:00:23.958
So... here we are.

00:00:23.983 --> 00:00:26.240
In the Skoda Octavia.

00:00:27.975 --> 00:00:29.892
A while ago I was driving the Rapid.

00:00:29.933 --> 00:00:31.617
I wasn't that positive about that one.

00:00:31.667 --> 00:00:33.411
This drives&nbsp;really nice.

00:00:33.592 --> 00:00:37.567
Always those nice&nbsp;things in our videos, incredible.

00:00:37.992 --> 00:00:42.092
No, but&nbsp;I can't really say something wrong about the Octavia.

00:00:42.125 --> 00:00:43.767
Perhaps even nothing.

00:00:44.033 --> 00:00:46.350
The only&nbsp;criticism on this car that I have...

00:00:46.383 --> 00:00:49.542
...is that you could question how sexy this car is.

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.117
But, that's&nbsp;for you to decide.&nbsp;

00:00:52.283 --> 00:00:54.400
Some people will absolutely like it.

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:58.492
And I think its well done, it dried up nicely.

00:00:58.766 --> 00:01:01.492
Typically Skoda, but typically Octavia as well.

00:01:01.545 --> 00:01:03.408
You&nbsp;immediately recognise this car.&nbsp;

00:01:03.625 --> 00:01:08.592
The Octavia is the backbone Skoda has, because...

00:01:08.633 --> 00:01:12.433
...more than&nbsp;40% of the Skoda sales are&nbsp;Octavia cars.

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.142
So&nbsp;this is a very important car for Skoda, worldwide.

00:01:16.183 --> 00:01:18.058
And obviously for in the Netherlands as well.

00:01:32.283 --> 00:01:34.683
I'd almost say, this is number four because...

00:01:34.725 --> 00:01:38.425
...we first had the&nbsp;A3, the Golf, the Leon&nbsp;and now the Octavia.

00:01:38.458 --> 00:01:44.570
So VAG finished introducing all its new models in this segment.

00:01:45.417 --> 00:01:50.000
The Octavia uses a lot that the other three use as well.

00:01:50.042 --> 00:01:53.030
They're all simultaneously developed on the MQB-platform.

00:01:53.067 --> 00:01:57.060
The&nbsp;Octavia lost some weight, until&nbsp;220 pounds (100 kg).

00:01:57.092 --> 00:02:00.480
But it will obviously depend on the version you order.

00:02:01.725 --> 00:02:04.510
Furthermore, loads of recognisable&nbsp;stuff.

00:02:04.567 --> 00:02:09.780
Recognisable engines, the 1.2 TSI, 1.4&nbsp;TSI and&nbsp;1.8 TSI.

00:02:10.275 --> 00:02:12.130
The 1.8 has 180 bhp.&nbsp;

00:02:12.392 --> 00:02:17.220
That's obviously the version we&nbsp;chose 
to drive around a bit&nbsp;here in Portugal.

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:24.470
Strange&nbsp;is that we have three 1.6 TDI's and the more&nbsp;bhp they get, 
the more fuel efficient they become.

00:02:24.508 --> 00:02:28.660
And&nbsp;there is a Greentech or Greenline, 
I'm tangling them up at the moment.

00:02:28.692 --> 00:02:32.070
But that&nbsp;model is doing 0.32 lbs/mile (89 g/km) of CO2.

00:02:33.083 --> 00:02:35.390
And then I hear you thinking, that's a pity!&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:02:35.433 --> 00:02:38.990
Well yes it is exactly 1 gram/km too much 
for the 14% tax rate (The Netherlands).

00:02:39.375 --> 00:02:44.620
But Pon, the importer, 
will obviously negotiate with Skoda in the Czech Republic...

00:02:44.658 --> 00:02:47.140
...and try to lose that one single gram.

00:02:47.308 --> 00:02:51.730
This in order to have the beneficial 14% tax rate, 
at least until the 1st of January 2014.

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.230
But to&nbsp;come back to the 1.8 with 180 bhp that we're driving.

00:03:01.633 --> 00:03:05.210
Yes... well that is exactly what you'd like to have in a car.

00:03:05.357 --> 00:03:10.640
Enough space, Octavia, 
I can&nbsp;sit quite comfortably behind myself.

00:03:10.708 --> 00:03:12.330
I'm not even folded up very much.&nbsp;

00:03:12.383 --> 00:03:15.690
We have&nbsp;155 US Gallons (590L) of luggage compartment...

00:03:15.767 --> 00:03:18.730
...which is enough for the two of us, the cameraman and me.

00:03:18.975 --> 00:03:22.580
You shouldn't expect to much in terms of drivability... &nbsp;

00:03:22.608 --> 00:03:28.760
...everything is fine, not very sportive&nbsp;but okay.&nbsp;

00:03:29.433 --> 00:03:33.180
There is something that is a little 
more than okay and that's the&nbsp;interior...

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:38.300
...because what you&nbsp;expect of a Skoda, 
that some materials are not very well finished.

00:03:38.516 --> 00:03:41.320
Those materials are findable, 
provided that you search very well.

00:03:41.353 --> 00:03:45.030
Incredible nice&nbsp;navigation system,&nbsp;
which is obviously optional because...

00:03:45.721 --> 00:03:52.440
...normally you have&nbsp;some sort of Retina display 
with&nbsp;310x80 pixels that provides radio information.&nbsp;&nbsp;

00:03:52.708 --> 00:03:56.560
But&nbsp;when you pay some extra, 
you'll get this very nice navigation system.

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:01.110
The prices are&nbsp;not definitive yet and expected mid-March.&nbsp;

00:04:01.167 --> 00:04:06.360
Comparable to the&nbsp;previous Octavia, 
which is a reasonable starting position.

00:04:07.525 --> 00:04:09.420
That is not unimportant.

00:04:10.008 --> 00:04:14.840
What is&nbsp;even more important is that&nbsp;Skoda will 
remove that single gram from the 1.6 TDI because...&nbsp;

00:04:14.875 --> 00:04:17.120
...only then the 14% tax rate applies.

00:04:18.558 --> 00:04:21.780
I'd say when you don't pay any attention to money, it doesn't matter.

00:04:21.808 --> 00:04:25.260
But why are you shopping at Skoda, 
when you're not paying any attention to money?

00:04:25.408 --> 00:04:27.820
Because&nbsp;they're very strong on exactly that point.&nbsp;

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:35.560
So that one single gram&nbsp;has to be removed so we 
can nicely enjoy driving our 14%&nbsp;tax rate lease&nbsp;cars.

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:38.200
Please remember driving on the right side of the road.&nbsp;

00:04:54.585 --> 00:04:56.860
