00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:06.200
Dry Application of a Window Graphic

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:11.750
Windows are one of the most common surfaces
that we apply graphics to, but they are also

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:15.440
one of the most difficult because of their
high surface tension.

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:20.040
But even this application could be easier
with a few simple techniques.

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:23.850
First follow the steps outlined in the video
“Creating a Clean Zone”.

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:28.340
Now, let’s install a large printed graphic
that will be viewed only from the outside

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:29.910
of the glass.

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.890
Water is not necessary for this application
because the streaks left behind by the squeegee

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:35.570
won’t be seen.

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:39.730
This means you can use vinyl with a water
based or an air egress adhesive, but this

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:44.070
is still a difficult application because of
the high energy surface of the glass.

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:51.030
Even adhesive that are designed to be repositionable
can become permanent very quickly.

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.030
Begin by taping the graphic in place.

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.190
Long graphics tend to creep up or down so
be sure to make lots of registration marks

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:02.780
to help you stay on track.

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:07.390
The key to an easy dry window application
is adhesive management.

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:11.450
Only expose the minimum amount of adhesive
necessary so that you are in control of the

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:13.609
application at all times.

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:18.840
I do this by using a back-slitting tool called
“the bodyguard knife”.

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.359
This tool allows me to choose where I want
to start the application by cutting only the

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:25.379
liner.

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:55.509
Now that a manageable section of the graphic
is applied in the center, I can apply it in

00:01:55.509 --> 00:02:00.700
either direction, removing only as much liner
as I want, staying in complete control of

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:01.920
the application.

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:35.400
By controlling the amount of adhesive that
is exposed, you can make even the largest

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.760
window graphic an easy application.
