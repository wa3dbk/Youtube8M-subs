00:00:14.228 --> 00:00:20.968
- I've met three girls at once and decided to ask

00:00:20.968 --> 00:00:22.092
them a few questions. Girls, tell me what is your

00:00:22.092 --> 00:00:22.982
team and which games do you play?

00:00:22.982 --> 00:00:29.191
-We play DOTA 2, we are UltraViolet team (but it's

00:00:29.191 --> 00:00:32.655
temporarily). We decided to come and support the team.

00:00:32.655 --> 00:00:34.558
- How long have you been playing?

00:00:34.558 --> 00:00:38.317
- It is different for everybody. It can be from

00:00:38.317 --> 00:00:40.704
6 years to 1.5 year.

00:00:40.704 --> 00:00:42.173
- So, it’s just like a mix. And how are you

00:00:42.173 --> 00:00:43.621
getting on?

00:00:43.621 --> 00:00:46.400
- Well at present I think we are the best

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:47.275
female team.

00:00:47.275 --> 00:00:49.930
- Who have you already defeated?

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:54.402
- There was a tournament, let me think…. Summer

00:00:54.402 --> 00:00:58.041
Cup DOTA 2 Bikini and there was a

00:00:58.041 --> 00:00:59.862
condition for one girl…

00:00:59.862 --> 00:01:00.907
- For you to wear bikini=)

00:01:00.907 --> 00:01:05.026
- …for a team to have at least one girl. But we

00:01:05.026 --> 00:01:08.587
had 5 girls in one team. And we gained a victory,

00:01:08.587 --> 00:01:10.939
it was very interesting.

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:15.279
- How many hours do you train per day?

00:01:15.279 --> 00:01:20.489
- Well, it is different for everybody. We try to

00:01:20.489 --> 00:01:23.312
do it as much as possible; usually we do it

00:01:23.312 --> 00:01:24.467
in the evenings. Certainly, it’s summer now that’s

00:01:24.467 --> 00:01:25.638
why we do it less, much less.

00:01:25.638 --> 00:01:26.761
- Beaches, guys…

00:01:26.761 --> 00:01:27.853
- Oh, yes, that’s too.

00:01:27.853 --> 00:01:31.956
- Now we are having rest in Kiev and don’t play

00:01:31.956 --> 00:01:33.003
so often.

00:01:33.003 --> 00:01:34.936
- Yeah, everybody is cool here!

00:01:34.936 --> 00:01:37.183
- Girls, how do you manage to combine playing

00:01:37.183 --> 00:01:39.257
games with your private life?

00:01:39.257 --> 00:01:43.750
- Well, we don’t have private lives. But as for

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:47.338
Tania, she works, plays games and has a private

00:01:47.338 --> 00:01:50.507
life, friends and so on… As for Alena, her

00:01:50.507 --> 00:01:52.771
boyfriend also plays DOTA.

00:01:52.771 --> 00:01:57.606
- Oh, so you’re lucky playing together?!

00:01:57.606 --> 00:01:59.369
- No, we don’t play together as he thinks

00:01:59.369 --> 00:02:01.662
I’m low skilled as I’m a girl.

00:02:01.662 --> 00:02:04.001
- Boys underestimate girls.

00:02:04.001 --> 00:02:06.781
- “Go to the kitchen and cook me some borsch,

00:02:06.781 --> 00:02:07.920
” does it happen like that?

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.401
- Well, yes.

00:02:09.401 --> 00:02:13.956
- Girls, do you think female e-Sports have a future?

00:02:13.956 --> 00:02:17.106
- Certainly, but there is one question dealing

00:02:17.106 --> 00:02:20.414
with society, how it will take this. ‘Cause Doters

00:02:20.414 --> 00:02:23.397
have never appreciated the fact that girls can

00:02:23.397 --> 00:02:26.670
play, they think we’re bad players. Taking into

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:31.836
account the current development of male DOTA, I suppose, that maybe the female one will also

00:02:31.836 --> 00:02:32.863
have a progress.

00:02:32.863 --> 00:02:36.108
- Tell me please, how you return for guys’

00:02:36.108 --> 00:02:38.136
stinging remarks? For example, “Hey you, girl,

00:02:38.136 --> 00:02:39.451
get out from here!”

00:02:39.451 --> 00:02:42.085
- Usually we play up to them. But there were

00:02:42.085 --> 00:02:47.512
different reactions, like “Go to the garage!

00:02:47.512 --> 00:02:52.865
Go to chop firewood!” and so on… But if they

00:02:52.865 --> 00:02:55.707
do that too much we can lose our patience and tell them to get lost.

00:02:55.707 --> 00:03:00.259
- Mostly we try to keep silence. We have Lilya

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:02.259
(she is not with us right now, unfortunately)

00:03:02.259 --> 00:03:05.785
and she is very communicative girl who talks to

00:03:05.785 --> 00:03:09.560
boys, ask them to play cws and so on. We had

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:13.118
situations when guys said that they would have

00:03:13.118 --> 00:03:15.208
deleted DOTA if they had lost to a girl. And they had.

00:03:15.208 --> 00:03:16.327
- … and deleted DOTA.

00:03:16.327 --> 00:03:19.277
- Yeah. “Do you want me to do that? I’ll do that

00:03:19.277 --> 00:03:23.772
for you!”. Usually it starts with them telling

00:03:23.772 --> 00:03:27.313
us “oh, come on, you are guys…”. We win and they

00:03:27.313 --> 00:03:28.846
go to our profiles, see that we are girls and

00:03:28.846 --> 00:03:30.651
then it starts with another note: “Hey, and what is your name?”.

00:03:30.651 --> 00:03:32.508
- Girls, what did wrong in your life that you

00:03:32.508 --> 00:03:33.537
started to play DOTA, after all?

00:03:33.537 --> 00:03:36.922
- What went wrong, ha! Usually it’s because of

00:03:36.922 --> 00:03:38.738
boys… Yeah, my…

00:03:38.738 --> 00:03:40.809
- Boyfriend!

00:03:40.809 --> 00:03:43.165
- … made me to play DOTA. By the way I want to

00:03:43.165 --> 00:03:44.197
say hi to him!

00:03:44.197 --> 00:03:46.769
- By the way, why are you playing DOTA,

00:03:46.769 --> 00:03:47.611
not Counter-Strike?

00:03:47.611 --> 00:03:51.136
- Actually, I was never good at Counter-Strike.

00:03:51.136 --> 00:03:54.023
When my friends asked me to play, I connected

00:03:54.023 --> 00:03:56.893
to the server and everyone said “omg, there

00:03:56.893 --> 00:03:58.516
are 8 men who cannot even defend just a single

00:03:58.516 --> 00:04:01.327
girl! Julia, we’re not going to kill you”.

00:04:01.327 --> 00:04:03.461
I was like “OK!” and that was the very time I

00:04:03.461 --> 00:04:04.475
realized CS wasn’t my game.

00:04:04.475 --> 00:04:10.109
- Who teaches you? Do you have any examples to

00:04:10.109 --> 00:04:13.230
follow? Maybe, team Na`Vi?

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:21.637
- Of course, we are led by our “chief”… coordinator…

00:04:21.637 --> 00:04:26.022
and master LighTofHeaveN. Nevertheless, we are

00:04:26.022 --> 00:04:30.016
good friends with him and he really helps us.

00:04:30.016 --> 00:04:33.593
He takes us to play pubs with him, ask his

00:04:33.593 --> 00:04:36.849
high-skilled friends to play with us.

00:04:36.849 --> 00:04:41.186
Here we met the rest of Na`Vi themselves and

00:04:41.186 --> 00:04:44.618
learnt a lot from them. As for me, I talked

00:04:44.618 --> 00:04:47.067
to Dendi and he told me about different tactics,

00:04:47.067 --> 00:04:49.501
how BKB works and so on. It was really interesting,

00:04:49.501 --> 00:04:50.655
all the players are great.

00:04:50.655 --> 00:04:52.605
- Do you have more in-game friends or real

00:04:52.605 --> 00:04:54.229
life friends?

00:04:54.229 --> 00:04:57.150
- Actually it’s hard to say. I would say

00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:59.565
I have more real life friends. Yeah, real life friends.

00:04:59.565 --> 00:05:03.229
Of course, there are a lot of people you know

00:05:03.229 --> 00:05:07.799
from the internet but best friends are real life ones.

00:05:07.799 --> 00:05:10.561
- Girls, you are awesome, thanks a lot for the

00:05:10.561 --> 00:05:13.791
interview! As we can see, girls can play DOTA and

00:05:13.791 --> 00:05:15.740
at the same time to be really lively, gorgeous,

00:05:15.740 --> 00:05:21.232
intelligent with great breasts and long legs. Thanks a lot!

00:05:21.232 --> 00:05:23.276
- Go Na`Vi!

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
- Go Na`Vi!
