00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:22.810
Governor Haslam: Unfortunately we continue
to see signs of the recession. Most recently

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:26.829
in the announcement of the closing of the
Goodyear plant in Union City. That closure

00:00:26.829 --> 00:00:30.480
will cause hundreds of people to lose their
jobs, but we're committed to working with

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:36.250
regional leaders to bring economic vitality
back to Northwest Tennessee. Some regions

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:40.230
have experienced recent success in this area.
To learn more about what makes the volunteer

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.920
state attractive to businesses, we travelled
to Chattanooga. A big economic victory for

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:49.650
Tennessee is the Volkswagen plant that will
begin production this spring. More than 900

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:53.809
people have already been hired to work at
the Chattanooga facility. But their work force

00:00:53.809 --> 00:00:59.159
is expected to eventually grow to more than
2,000. Volkswagen Group of America has also

00:00:59.159 --> 00:01:03.950
promised to invest one billion dollars into
the state's economy in more than five million

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:08.700
dollars over five years to area schools and
universities. Volkswagen estimates that when

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.760
the plant is fully functional and all the
suppliers are in place, the jobs from this

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:18.590
multinational company will generate 12 billion
dollars in income growth and 1.4 billion dollars

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:25.010
in tax revenues. In June 2010 Alstom Chattanooga
expanded their facility to build steam and

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:31.070
gas turbines as well as large turbo generators.
Alstom took an old vacant building and renovated

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:35.640
it to make it energy efficient with the capacity
to build the largest turbines in the world.

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:41.570
The plant will not only help to generate green
energy, but will also fuel 350 high quality

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:46.680
jobs. Chattanooga's excellent roads, railroad
resources and waterways make it a logical

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:49.630
choice to transport Alstom's large and heavy
products.

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:52.890
Commissioner Hagerty: Well there's a spillover
effect from large cutting edge industries

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.180
like this that is going to affect the entire
region. What I can't wait to do is figure

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:02.120
out how that knock-on effect gets leveraged
in our region. And as the governor said, it's

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:07.130
going to be a lot about workforce training,
getting the right job skills to our populace,

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:10.470
and making sure that we have educational programs
that support all this.

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.090
Governor Haslam: To learn more from Chattanooga
success, and hear how the state can support

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:18.112
this cities momentum, we sat down with some
community leaders at the University of Tennessee

00:02:18.112 --> 00:02:23.240
at Chattanooga for a roundtable discussion
about jobs. Our goal is to eventually travel

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:28.140
to every region in the state to examine what
communities are facing and to help them on

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.120
how they can efficiently use their resources
to create the economic development needed

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:37.249
to bring high quality jobs to each region
of the state. On February the 14th I had the

00:02:37.249 --> 00:02:41.299
great pleasure to help make the announcement
that Mitsubishi Electric will build a 200

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:46.959
million dollar transformer manufacturing facility
in Memphis that will eventually bring 275

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:51.520
new jobs to West Tennessee. We also introduced
our legislative package last week. It was

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:56.780
a busy week, with our key emphasis on bringing
more high quality jobs to the state. We'll

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.500
continue to keep you updated on the direction
for your Tennessee government.
