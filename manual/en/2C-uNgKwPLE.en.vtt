00:00:15.869 --> 00:00:17.210
What's going on nation?

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:20.840
I'm going to demonstrate for you guys how to do a Bulgarian split squat.

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:24.600
The Bulgarian split squat is very similar to a normal split squat

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.229
as they involve the same joint movements and technique

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:32.449
but the Bulgarian allows you to go lower, which allows you to put more emphasis on your quads the

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.160
primary muscles that are going to be used in this exercise are your quads glutes and inner thighs.

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.640
So if you're looking to really pack on some muscle this exercise is really great for those areas.

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:43.610
Your hamstrings and calves

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:45.610
are gonna be targeting throughout this exercise as well

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:49.459
but they're going to be worked mainly as stabilizers throughout the movement.

00:00:49.829 --> 00:00:53.900
Also keep in mind this exercise requires a lot more balance,

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:55.759
which makes it a more challenging movement as well.

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:02.420
Begin the exercise standing with your front foot flat on the ground and your rear foot on a bench.

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:08.569
Your front leg is going to be the working leg during the exercise and your back leg will be utilized for balance.

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.940
You can choose to have your rear foot flat or on its toes.

00:01:15.959 --> 00:01:19.400
Once in position, lower yourself into a deep lunge while keeping

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.699
your chest up and making sure your knee does not pass your toes.

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:30.220
Return to the starting position by pushing through the heel of

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:33.139
your front foot while maintaining your balance with your rear foot.

00:01:34.319 --> 00:01:39.109
As you perform the exercise the majority of your weight should be shifted to your front leg.

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:45.200
You can choose to keep your arms by your sides or out in front of you

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.329
to help with balance throughout the movement.

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.489
With a closer foot stance you're going to activate more of your quads.

00:01:55.849 --> 00:01:59.809
If you step forward, you're going to activate more glutes throughout the exercise.

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:08.520
If this is your first time performing the exercise you can place

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.880
a pad on the ground to protect your knee from impact.

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.440
Be sure to switch legs once you complete your set

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:32.020
