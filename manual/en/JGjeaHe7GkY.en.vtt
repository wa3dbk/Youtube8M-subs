00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:04.280
Oh my gosh.

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:07.680
I know I just found a dead fish in it. It was gross.

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.680
These three things look spicy.

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:24.880
(Muffled scream)

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.140
It make me go like this (Imitates seizures)

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:36.820
It's a peculiar taste.

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.260
Is that coffee?

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:00.820
(Spits)

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:11.340
I think it's weird that kids drink coffee (sips) in Brazil.

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:13.380
I hate coffee

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.800
Are you serious?

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:19.800
Cow poop.

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:25.480
(Laughs)

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.080
(Excited noises)

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:31.800
No, I would not eat fish in the morning.

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.500
I know I wont like it. I hate salmon.

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.720
This bit is pretty soft, it could be my pillow

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:40.920
I actually would have this for breakfast.

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:46.440
Africa?

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.120
Finland?

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.400
What's Finland?

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.840
Oh!

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:56.760
Okay.

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:02.280
This doesn't look like a breakfast to me.

00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:04.300
I've never seen a black egg.

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.200
does it taste good?

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:10.940
So it kind of has like a portable toilet smell, and also (chuckles) a

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:12.460
rotten egg smell.

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:14.460
This is delicious.

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.020
I really eating a old egg?

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.340
Really good. It's really good.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.040
(Monkey noises)

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.580
It tastes like french fries. And french fries are good.

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:43.670
There's prawn?

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:45.670
Mmm, I don't really say um...

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:47.330
Geometry.

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:49.330
Airlines.

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:52.840
Take a-(mumbling).

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:55.740
If I eat a lot my mom usually calls me a pig.

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:57.580
Mom are you even listening?

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.680
Mm-hmm.

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:13.780
I don't think my friends would eat this for breakfast because their moms would say it would be too unhealthy

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:15.680
This is bright.

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.020
People have this for breakfast?

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:21.460
Wonder what would happen if I fold it in half?

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:27.080
That should be cut?

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:29.360
Okay cut. (Claps)

00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:32.380
(Subs by ArchimDaniel)

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.200
And boys have a penis.
