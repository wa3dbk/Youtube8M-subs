Well hi I'm Bob Schrupp physical therapist

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:18.330
I'm Brad Heineck, physical therapist as well. I was just looking at this book about cervical surgery

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:25.019
Rather interesting, it kind of relates to what we're going to talk about today, we're going to talk about Peyton Manning

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:30.929
What are you reading about? I'm reading about advanced surgical surgery. Oh, where did you get that one?

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:34.738
Well, that's not available to you because to you because you're just not up to my level yet

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:42.239
Peyton Manning apparently has had two surgeries again

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:47.819
We're not really privy to what went on, but they are talking about a cervical disc and a cervical bulge

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:56.699
And so what we would talk about, what we thought we'd show you today is what we speculate may have happened and then also

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:01.520
I'd like to just briefly touch upon how we often treat this

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:07.799
When it comes down to it, you know take the human body whether you're a football player

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:20.000
or a basketball player you're just an average joe like you and I we all have the same spine we got seven cervical vertebrae, 12 thoracic, and 7 lumbar...5 lumbar

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:28.400
Actually some people do that six, but the basics are there and what we're going to talk about is going to inform you

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.080
on really what's going on beneath the skin.

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:35.040
Okay, so this is a spine, this is

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.140
where your head would be, its kind of cut off here. This is your pelvis

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:44.540
These are the legs, the first seven bones that stack up here make your neck

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.540
Alright, and I'm again

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.729
I'm not sure exactly at what level he had trouble with but

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:55.919
It had to be one of the first seven because it did involve the cervical or the neck

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:03.420
Now in between each one of these bones or vertebrae are a disc and in a minute

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.570
We'll show you exactly what that looks like by using a larger model

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:12.060
But I don't know if you can pan in here at all and see any of this

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:16.900
Yeah, probably like this. Just bring it right in, right into here

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:24.240
The majority of neck injuries occur in the lower vertebrae which

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:31.050
Were one two three four five six seven so we're talking usually six to seven five six or seven are usually involved

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:33.479
We don't know that for sure they don't let that information out

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:38.640
But that's where it's probably at wouldn't you agree Bob?

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.869
So we're probably talking the lower neck, so on your body if you go back here and you feel

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:46.350
Oh that big bump there that most people have that is C7

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:51.269
Okay, so we're talking about that part of the neck if you can see that, okay the other thing

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:55.619
I want you to point out that I want you to see on this model here

00:02:55.620 --> 00:03:01.709
Is that these yellow things coming out here now these are cut off they actually

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:04.470
they extend all the way down into your arms

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:08.730
Those are the nerves and those are what can give you pain

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:12.299
And what happens is the discs can actually bulge

00:03:12.299 --> 00:03:14.339
Usually a bulge doesn't do it

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:19.470
But maybe a herniation will actually push on that nerve and send pain down into your arm

00:03:19.470 --> 00:03:22.169
Or you know into the upper quadrant here

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:25.920
So that's what we're going to show you when we use our model is how that can happen

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:29.940
Any other comments Brad? These look like little worms

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:36.920
But they're not they're actually nerves and that's really what they look like if you do look at a real cadaver

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:42.080
The only thing I wanted to ask is this is a pretty short person look at these legs

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:47.180
He'd make a good baseball hitter because you couldn't pitch to him

00:03:48.390 --> 00:03:52.520
Alright, why don't we cut right now, and then we'll bring in the model

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:57.140
Okay, we're going to continue on with looking at in detail

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:01.580
the injury that can happen to the cervical spine a very common one

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:08.600
Bob talked about it as being a bulging or a herniated disc.

00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:10.500
Can you throw something in?

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:15.229
Nice job. Thank you. All right. Let's zoom right in here, okay, Lindsey

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:21.469
Right in where the pen is, get as close as you can

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:27.350
Okay here we go we're going to look at

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:30.769
C6 and C7 right here cervical vertebrae

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:34.040
number 6 to number 7 they start from the top

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:38.029
and you come down now if you look right in here is the disc, okay?

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:41.209
Here's the nerve that Bob was talking about. Now the disc

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:49.219
herniates or shifts and gets tissue and presses against this nerve right here, great source of pain and again

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:50.540
it doesn't just hurt here

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:52.050
But the pain can radiate

00:04:52.050 --> 00:04:56.270
where the nerve goes so that can go into the scapular region by the shoulder blade down the shoulder

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:00.799
and I can't go all the way down into the hands and fingers which obviously for a

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:05.119
professional football player trying to throw the ball is going to cause some issues

00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:09.049
So what we need to do is get in there clear this area out

00:05:09.570 --> 00:05:15.140
in here so the nerve is freed up and it can move and you can have normal range of motion with the neck so

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:19.640
we can look right you can look left look down field for the long ball look for the short ball

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:24.049
And you have some success passing so that's what we're going to look at right there

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:35.580
Okay now let's look at those two vertebra sets C6 and C7 go ahead throw me. There we go. Here we got a couple models here.

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:42.560
Lindsey the model behind the camera, but she's not coming out today. Actually seriously we've got the vertebrae cup model

00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:47.989
Okay, coffee cup that people in the health field will use particularly

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:50.600
therapists and orthopedic surgeons

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:57.660
You got some coffee to drink, it works great for this demonstration here's C7 remember the disc I talked about a disc is

00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:00.040
Not rigid like a hockey puck

00:06:00.059 --> 00:06:06.299
There's some fluidity to it and it has some give so that you can rotate your neck up and down and round etc

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:12.000
So this works great for a model, okay, so here we got C6

00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:19.700
C7 now if you were to rotate your head to the right if you can see a little bit of give between each vertebrae

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:23.840
as it works up the chamber, it looks like you've got too much coffee

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:30.640
Okay, so they can rotate this way this way now when you bring your head down

00:06:31.380 --> 00:06:37.280
Look what happens it separates back here when you look up towards the sky whoops

00:06:38.019 --> 00:06:42.209
Give way here and back whoa and if that happens you got some serious problems

00:06:42.999 --> 00:06:44.999
Okay, all right

00:06:49.059 --> 00:06:54.419
All right here we go, so let's zoom in right in here Lindsey

00:06:55.419 --> 00:06:59.218
Right in here is where that nerve, we're going to use this pen as a nerve

00:07:00.099 --> 00:07:04.169
Came out of the spine then it goes down into the shoulder into the arm

00:07:04.839 --> 00:07:09.929
Now what can happen to a real dramatic jolt to the head or this can happen

00:07:10.659 --> 00:07:12.989
People like working on a computer and have poor posture

00:07:12.990 --> 00:07:15.539
but we're gonna talk about Peyton Manning's case he probably had a

00:07:15.759 --> 00:07:19.318
severe blow to the head as he had a number of concussions over the years is

00:07:20.319 --> 00:07:24.328
This can happen in the bulb that this can actually bulge out like that

00:07:24.329 --> 00:07:31.559
This is a really neat model this is the neatest thing that we really invented for instructing and educating patients on how discs herniate

00:07:31.689 --> 00:07:34.588
But you can see where if that happens

00:07:34.659 --> 00:07:39.419
It's going to interfere with that nerve creating a lot of pain a lot of problems

00:07:39.419 --> 00:07:42.028
And that's what they got to get in and with surgery

00:07:42.029 --> 00:07:46.558
They're gonna just actually cut that right off get things back in then it's going to take a number of weeks

00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:53.080
for scar tissue to heal over that and start to regain range of motion and become functional again

00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:59.560
How was that Bob? Good I think
