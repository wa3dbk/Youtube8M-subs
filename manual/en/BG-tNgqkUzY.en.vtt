00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:10.810
Hello I am Arthur DeBolt on behalf of Expert
Village. You will notice I have some golfing

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:16.710
equipment here in front of me, first one that
I have a couple of putters. You know that

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:24.120
putters are purely a personal choice. These
two have connection with the back of the putter

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:31.550
and this one is a center. Your choice is which
one that you wish to get used to; however,

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:38.380
what I would suggest is that you be fitted
specifically with these other clubs. So we

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:44.550
are going to take a look at… well, this
is one out of the 1950’s, which is a Bobby

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:54.480
Jones club, and this one is today’s modern
technology. If you will notice, there is not

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.790
a lot of difference between these two clubs,
even though they both are the same clubs;

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:02.979
this is a nine iron, this is a nine iron,
look at the difference in the length and in

00:01:02.979 --> 00:01:11.040
the size of the size of the grip. Well I prefer
the thinner grip, because the grip that they

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:19.440
use is to use in my fingers and let my hands
just kinda… flexible in. The next thing

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:28.560
is your woods. This particular one was made
in 50s also, along with this one. This is

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.230
a modern driver, which is a Bob Toskey driver,
and see the difference in the length; it has

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:39.680
got to be at least three inches. Just for
number #1 thing, any time that you are dealing

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:47.000
with equipment, always go to a professional
to get fitted specifically for your particular

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:55.880
swing. Wait until you have reached the point
where you can swing perfectly, and then go

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:06.170
and get fitted with clubs. The club is made
specifically to absorb moisture in your hands,

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:13.030
so that when you actually take a grip on the
club, your hand does not spin or twist, so

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:20.870
that you can bring the club back to square.
So always use a glove whenever possible, even

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:27.409
if your hands are dry…you will get a better
grip on it. As far as your shoes, your shoe

00:02:27.409 --> 00:02:30.980
should have some kind of a cleat, you can
wear tennis shoes, or just buy anything you

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:36.099
want, as long as there is some kind of a grip
on the bottom of it that causes you to be

00:02:36.099 --> 00:02:42.519
pretty stable and not have to slide around.
We have to own golf shoes. I guess if you

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:44.629
want to be in style, you’ll own golf shoes.
