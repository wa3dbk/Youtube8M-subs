Hi, Iím Tyler, and I'm going to show you
around to some of my favorite places here

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:20.580
at Parks Library. Right when you walk into
the library, there's a big open area filled

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:26.740
with computers, and the circulation desk,
and thereís a bunch of chairs for you know,

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:32.210
sitting in between classes or meeting your
group for a group project. It's a really

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:37.559
useful area in the library and it's right
when you walk in so itís really easy to find.

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:44.530
This is the circulation desk. Here you can
check out books with your ISU ID Card. That's

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:50.710
also where you will return your books when
you're done with them. You can reserve group

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:57.710
study rooms where you can check out these
rooms and work with your group in a more quiet,

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:05.440
secluded area to get more work done. If you
go to the circulation desk and there are no

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:10.010
rooms available, they will actually let you
know when a room will be available and you

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:14.030
can come back and then they'll let you use
it for your group then.

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:21.000
Here in the LCC, it's a really convenient
area to work on group projects if you don't

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.600
have time to get a study room or there
aren't any available. They have really wide

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:32.179
tables, as you can see, and you can easily
fit four or five group members at one of these

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:37.609
tables. I come in here and work on projects
all the time with my groups.

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:44.609
Another really cool thing that the LCC has
to offer are these KIC Scanners, and they're

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:51.729
really convenient and easy to use. I know
when I have to scan homework or something

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:56.780
out of a book, they're a lot more easier
than using a regular scanner because you just

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.979
place it open on the KIC scanner and it
takes a picture of it from above and then

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:05.490
you just turn the page instead of having to
take it out, turn the page, and then put it

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:11.009
back in. Uh, from the KIC Scanners you can
save it to a USB or you can email it to yourself

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:15.150
straight from the scanner itself, so that's
pretty cool.

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:21.040
Along this wall in the LCC you see our multi-media studio. I can't really tell you much about

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:26.319
them because I've never had to use them.
But some really useful things? The library

00:02:26.319 --> 00:02:30.819
is actually open until midnight, which is
later than some of the other buildings on

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:35.340
campus. And also, some of the buildings on
campus that have multi-media studios are

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:41.849
they're only for people who are in that major
for that particular studio. But here at the

00:02:41.849 --> 00:02:44.750
Library, anyone can use these studios.

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:51.750
Behind me is Bookends Cafe. Itís a really
nice place in the library to stop in, grab

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:56.409
a bite to eat, something to drink in between
classes. If you're stuck on campus during

00:02:56.409 --> 00:03:00.150
the day and you don't have enough time to
go back to your dorm or your apartment, you

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:07.150
can stop in. They have cookies and sandwiches
and coffee and Redbull if you have a 9 a.m.

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:13.129
class that you just can't quite stay awake
for, and it's a really nice place to just

00:03:13.129 --> 00:03:17.299
come in and take a load off and enjoy a nice
snack.

00:03:17.299 --> 00:03:23.180
In the basement of the library there's the
Media Center and, Iím going to be honest

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:27.720
with you, I've been here for four years and
I didn't even know this was down here. And

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:34.650
it's a real shame I didn't, because they
have tons of movies that you can check out

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:39.620
for free with your Iowa State ID Card. And
not just old movies that you've never heard

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:46.269
of...I'm talking brand new movies that just
came out. They have them here, and you can

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:49.209
check them out just like a book.

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:56.209
Welcome to the tiers, (sigh) the most interesting, amazing place at the library. Very historical.

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:02.640
If you look, it pretty much looks like it's
straight out of Ghost Busters, and it's a

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:09.040
little scary at times. But that also leads
to very little foot traffic coming through,

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:13.409
which means that it's going to be quieter,
and means that you're going to get more work

00:04:13.409 --> 00:04:20.409
done. Also, there are no windows in the tiers
so you don't know how long you've been in

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:23.810
here studying. It could be dark out, it could
be the middle of the day and you will have

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:29.050
no idea, but you will get your studying done.

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:36.050
One really convenient thing about the tiers
is that they have these rows and rows of individual

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:44.790
desks and they have a lamp, individual lamp,
and those lamps have computer outlet

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:51.850
plugs in them. And sometimes it's kind of
hard to find an outlet in the library to plug in,

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:58.850
but if you go to the tiers, there are
seven tiers in between the four floors of

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:05.850
Parks Library and each one has a row of individual
desks like this. So you are bound to be able

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:07.480
to find at least one open seat.
