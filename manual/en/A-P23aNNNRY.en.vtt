00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:07.200
Thank you for coming! We're here to watch new '#TRENUJzKRZYCHEM' episode together

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:10.200
and its main character will be the best football player in the world.

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:13.000
Is that me?

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.200
No, no, you used to be... but ok, say something

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:22.200
So at least I will tell you a short joke, anecdote:

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:28.200
 

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:32.200
 

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.800
Well... I also have a joke.

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:42.200
Why  Putin support club from... Dortmund!?

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:46.200
boRUSSIA. (bo means becouse in polish)

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:51.200
As you can see, Franck Ribery have a joke in sign language.

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:54.500
It's such a fun, so don't waste time. Let's start this episode!

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.500
I've got nothing to add. Play like Cristiano Ronaldo!

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:26.700
So hello you man, it's Krzysiek Golonka and in short: I travel the world thanks to my ball.

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:34.500
Fine, but I will play some music at the beginning.

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:36.200
Ok, come on!

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:47.400
As you know, Ronaldo is absolute perfectionist 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:52.500
He's thinking about everything he's doing.

00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:56.400
No matter if it's about football...

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:02.400
Or perfect voice for example.

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:09.500
Ok, sometimes he forget oneself for a moment.

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:21.400
But he can quickly turn into perfectionist again. 

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:32.400
Today in 20th episode I will make you, you and you such a perfectionist as Ronaldo is. So 3,  2, 1 let's go.

00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:42.400
Ronaldo likes to swing his legs fast, but as we mentioned – every move is considered.

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:51.400
Today we'll learn a mix containing 4 tricks but don't worry, we'll handle it.

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:01.500
At the beginning let's do a warm-up.

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:05.400
Personally I feel like I turn into Ronaldo when I jump like this.

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:12.400
We start as always, the ball is in front of us and we encircle it very quickly.

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:18.900
Bend over, jump from one leg to another and try to do a swing in front of the ball.

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:25.030
Then stand on your right leg and shift your bodyweight to this leg.

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:32.700
In the same time the second leg jump behind the ball and waits for us to move it to the right position.

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:39.500
So it's time for this leg. We send the ball to one direction by outside of the foot and run with the ball as fast as it's possible.

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:46.400
It's very important to do it with correct body balance and move our body to one side. Let's see.

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:53.400
Now our task is to stop the ball by 'Rabona Fake' and it looks like this:

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:58.900
We put the ball in front of us and train only the kick at the beginning.

00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:05.400
Zatrzymanie piłki musi odbyć się za jedną z nóg za pomocą właśnie takiego krzyżaka
Stopping the ball must be done behind one leg after crossover, just like this.

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:12.900
We jump in one side, try to kick the ball with straight flick and next we land on the same foot.

00:04:13.130 --> 00:04:17.500
So it's time for whole 'Rabona Fake' without the ball.

00:04:17.730 --> 00:04:22.900
You have to be like Chuck Norris, Bruce Lee... Bonus BGC.

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:30.900
When we learn it, we add the ball and do the 'Rabona Fake' very slowly.

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:38.900
Increase the tempo slowly and after the kick try to stand on your feet widely to keep the balance.

00:04:39:030 --&gt; 00:04:43,900
Who knows, maybe with this move you'll already mislead your opponent, but we go on with Ronaldo's mix.

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:50.900
To increase the level, try to stop the ball with our sole after 'Rabona Fake'.

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:56.900
Next we pull it in front of us in straight line that it rolls behind one leg.

00:04:57.130 --> 00:05:00.900
Of course the second leg must be put forward.

00:05:01.130 --> 00:05:07.900
It looks really cool if we put it like we're drunk but with a style, you know.

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:11.900
Len Goodman would rate it 10!

00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:15.500
Ok, 9 because of unextended feet.

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:20.500
To end the third stage, we have to stop the ball.

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:29.900
We pull it, do a fast step forward and push it by our toes or outside of the foot to the ground.

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:38.900
We add the ball and calmly, watch it from every angle

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:45.900
The last stage is a very similar trick to the one from Mario Goetze, but we start doing it a little different way.

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:52.900
We start by stopping the ball by our toes and with the inside of the foot we kick the ball to our second leg.

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:55.900
Now we'll remind the trick scheme.

00:05:56.130 --> 00:06:03.900
We kick the ball, put the leg on the ground quickly and kick it again by crossover.

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:07.900
That's all, Ronaldo is also a human.

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:12.900
He just learned every trick and combined it together.

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:17.500
I know it's one of the hardest mixes to learn, but you will handle it mans!

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:22.900
