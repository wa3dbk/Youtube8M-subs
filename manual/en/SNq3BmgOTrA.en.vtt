00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.180
Intro music.

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.360
Narrator: Lands, oceans, and
atmosphere...

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:12.530
THESE are the constantly
changing elements of the
Earth's system. 

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:16.700
While scientists know that
these elements are connected;

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:20.910
it is still unclear HOW a small
change in one element

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:25.100
could affect the others. The
solution?...

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:29.230
REMOTE SENSING...flying
extremely precise instruments in

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.350
space that orbit the Earth and
collect continuous global
measurements

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:37.470
over long periods of time.

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:41.580
For over a decade NASA's
Earth-observing satellites have

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:45.670
delivered critical climate
data. Scientists need this data

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.730
to understand how and why our
planet changes over time.

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:53.850
It also helps them make better
predictions of future climate
patterns. 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:57.940
Now, NASA is ready to launch a
new sensor

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.950
technology: The
Visible/Infrared Imager
Radiometer Suite

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:06.130
or VIIRS. This sensor will fly
on NASA's next generation 

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.300
Earth-monitoring satellite: The
NPOESS Preparatory Project or
NPP.

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.440
VIIRS is a continuation of 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.620
the MODIS instrument flown on
NASA's Aqua and Terra
satellites.

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.820
Justice: From my perspective
VIIRS is the most important
instrument on NPP because it
provides 

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.990
continuity to MODIS and MODIS
has become an extremely
important instrument form
global 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:31.150
monitoring. I think it's one of
the success stories of the NASA
program

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.240
and we are hoping that VIIRS
will be the same. 

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:39.320
Narrator: With multi-channel
imaging capabilities, VIIRS
will deliver 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:43.420
environmental data products
faster than its predecessors.

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:47.490
These products include visible
and infrared imaging of
hurricanes,

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:51.660
forest fires, volcanoes, sea
surface temperature,
ocean-color, 

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.690
and atmosphere aerosols. VIIRS
will continue

00:01:55.710 --> 00:01:59.710
adding to the decades of
existing data records, helping
scientists 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:03.850
unravel the mysteries of
climate change. Justice: The

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:08.040
VIIRS instrument is a
scientific measurement tool;
it's an

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:12.220
instrument that has calibrated
measurements of the land
surface and it converts those

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:16.400
into digital numbers that are
then down linked to a ground
station.

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:20.540
We would take those
observations and then we would
use those to 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.720
provide input to models we are
developing that 

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:28.910
simulate the processes of the
land and to try then to see

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:33.050
what happens if those
parameters change.

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:37.190
Narrator: Scientists use these
models to increase

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:41.300
their understanding of the
complex interaction between the
Earth system's elements

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:45.470
and then make improved global
climate predictions.

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:49.550
Chris Justice: "I think the
critical thing about the NPP
VIIRS 

00:02:49.570 --> 00:02:53.760
instrument is that we will get
long-term data records

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:57.840
and I think if you want to
monitor how the Earth's surface
is changing we need consistent

00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:01.900
data records and I think this
is why this is so important for
NASA science,

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.950
and it is also important for me
personally. I can understand
how we are

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:10.130
responding to climate change
and how climate change is
affecting the Earth's surface.

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:14.290
Ending music.

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:18.460
Beeping sound.

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.650
Beeping sound.

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:27.050
Quiet.
