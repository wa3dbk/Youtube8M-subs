Hey, there! This is Terry from HockeyMonkey.com.
Today we're going to be looking at an Easton

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:14.850
skate, it's the Stealth RS.
Easton has designed the Stealth RS skate to

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:20.160
be lightweight and responsive with enhancements
that provide more mobility and forward flexion.

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:25.090
They have a generous anatomical fit profile,
giving you a nice snug fit in the ankle and

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:30.300
heel area with a little extra room for the
front of your foot. The toe cap has been re-designed

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.090
to have a more anatomical low-profile look
and feel.

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:40.200
Easton uses a fused composite in the quarter
panels or sides of the skates comprised of

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:46.640
EPP, TPU and TPE. Basically, it's a combination
of thermoplastics and foams that work together

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:53.290
to optimize heat moldability and responsiveness.
They really provide a generous amount of lateral

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:59.040
support. The heel and ankle padding on the
inside is a generous anatomically shaped memory

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:05.239
foam underneath a nicely finished Bio-Dri
liner. This combination is very comfortable

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:10.009
and helps to minimize heel slippage. This
design plus the fact that these respond so

00:01:10.009 --> 00:01:14.759
well to heat molding is going to get you a
great form fit right out of the box and drastically

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:19.789
reduce break in time. The footbed is also
worth mentioning, because it features Giro's

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:27.069
SuperNatural™ fit system with adjustable
arch zones. The skates come with 3 different

00:01:27.069 --> 00:01:31.659
arch zone inserts.
You get great comfort from the pre-formed

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:38.049
felt and foam tongue, which also has an injected
lace bite protector. This tongue design still

00:01:38.049 --> 00:01:43.869
allows for a good amount of forward flex and
mobility. It has a lightweight Texalium™

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:49.189
outsole which also features the Dry Flow™
moisture drainage system. This type of outsole

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:53.789
provides a nice rigid, yet responsive, platform
for the boot to be mounted on which helps

00:01:53.789 --> 00:01:56.991
to reduce torque while you skate.
If you're looking for a performance skate

00:01:56.991 --> 00:02:00.740
that is responsive and offers a significant
amount of lateral support, check out the Stealth

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:06.729
RS skates at one of our super stores or at
HockeyMonkey.com. Thanks for watching. Later!
