&gt;&gt; MARISSA MAYER: Google Doodles are our way
of decorating or logo.

00:00:08.270 --> 00:00:12.549
It started as an out-of-office message, and
worked into holidays and special events.

00:00:12.549 --> 00:00:18.240
And now we've opened up Doodle 4 Google, really
allowing school children to participate.

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.410
&gt;&gt; I'm excited.

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:22.910
&gt;&gt; Wow!
It's all in Google colors.

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:23.910
[cheers]

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.339
&gt;&gt; You guys get the best seats in the entire
house.

00:00:29.339 --> 00:00:31.679
You get first row!

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:35.890
&gt;&gt; MAYER: Good morning.
I want to welcome all of you here, and thank

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:40.550
you for participating in Doodle 4 Google.
The theme for this year's contest was "What

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:44.269
I wish for the world."
All of the designs were amazingly inspired.

00:00:44.269 --> 00:00:49.030
You drew on your passions and thought about
art and the environment and music.

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:53.250
The other thing we're really excited about
this year is partnering with the Smithsonian

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:58.969
Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum to not
only have the winning doodle on the Google

00:00:58.969 --> 00:01:05.200
home page, but also to offer an exhibit of
all 40 regional finalists here at the museum.

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:09.729
&gt;&gt; DENNIS HWANG: They're wanting to participate;
so all the hands are shooting up to volunteer

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:13.509
to draw for the rest of the group.
Just seeing that was really refreshing.

00:01:13.509 --> 00:01:16.940
&gt;&gt; CAROLINE PAYSON: Kids were being challenged
to think about their vision for the world,

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:20.630
but then portray it through a design.
Our mission is to let people know how important

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:25.630
design is in their daily lives, and the idea
that anyone can think about changing the world

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:28.811
by thinking about a design problem and solving.
It's a perfect fit for us.

00:01:28.811 --> 00:01:34.731
&gt;&gt; MAYER: There were 28,000 doodles; six million
votes to help us narrow it to the four national

00:01:34.731 --> 00:01:38.280
finalists, and then ultimately narrow to our
winners.

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.799
Our national winner this year is Christin
Engelberth.

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:43.360
[applause]

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:50.909
Christin's doodle is titled "A new beginning,"
and really stresses the importance of discoveries

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:52.900
under the conveyed idea a new beginning for
the world.

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:56.500
&gt;&gt; LUCILLE TENAZAS: This competition that
Google is encouraging, I think, is a wonderful

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.180
opportunity for them.
It shows the beginnings of talent in young

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.180
people.

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:02.490
[music]

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:08.910
&gt;&gt; MICHEAL LOPEZ: The quality of artwork that's
coming out of these kids, that are even, like,

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:14.230
you know, five, six-years-old, is just amazing.
You know, their color, their composition,

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:17.999
their ideas and concept for the art is just
amazing.

00:02:17.999 --> 00:02:22.256
&gt;&gt; HWANG: These kids... some of them are already
accomplished artists and, you know, having

00:02:22.256 --> 00:02:28.610
their work shown in national museum like the
Smithsonian is, I think, a wonderful opportunity

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:34.490
for those kids.
