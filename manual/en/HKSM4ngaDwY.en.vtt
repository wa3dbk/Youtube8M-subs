00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:08.700
Your holiness, my next question is about your
stance on homosexuality and particularly as

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:18.140
there have been, what some people describe
as blessings, in some churches, of homosexual

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:22.390
unions or even marriage; and I'd be grateful
for your opinion about this.

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:34.910
You see, most often nowadays the trend is
in favor of genetic tendencies and they attribute

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:42.160
genetic tendencies to be responsible; Attribute
responsibility to genetic tendencies and say

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:46.790
they're helpless, they can't do anything.

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:55.070
This is absolutely wrong, 100% wrong; because
the concept of pleasure as related to sexuality

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:59.540
is borne out of re-productivity.

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:09.150
If you study the history of the development
of human pleasures and pains, you'll be amazed

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:18.679
that they're always connected with usability
of a thing or the contrary of it.

00:01:18.679 --> 00:01:28.330
Sex evolved through a very long process of
nature’s experimentation with these things;

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:36.770
unless the concept of pleasure was somehow
created, human or animal reproduction might

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:38.590
have stopped much, much earlier.

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:51.079
So it is wrong to say that genetically, this
is the message i.e. you must do something.

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:54.639
This is wrong because genetic changes can
take place, first with distortion in your

00:01:54.639 --> 00:02:03.540
mind and then like we have discussed earlier,
some changes can be proved to be existent.

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:10.400
Now, I turn to this question of genitive compulsions.

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:21.340
This is wrong, that only in sex of heterogeneous
sex or of homosexual sexuality, there are

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:22.820
any compulsions.

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:30.870
The fact is that the compulsions are borne
out of society and social behaviors; and such

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:38.290
compulsions are not at all confined to sexuality
at all.

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:47.830
There is an urge for lust, there is an urge
for appropriation of things; whereas for stealing,

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:54.070
for robbing, for killing, whom we don’t
like; are they not urges?

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:55.620
We should suppress them?

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.850
But, why do you attribute it to humanity?

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:02.450
They are urges, which have to be suppressed.

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:10.670
So that the social evolution takes place,
out of their suppression and a noble society

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:11.800
is born.

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:16.690
Let these urges go scot-free.

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:24.820
Are there any Scottish person sitting among
us, we do apologize to that.

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:26.840
We call it scot-free.

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:40.910
I am not referring to any Scottish attitude,
it's a human attitude; every person, if not

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:49.770
disciplined, will play havoc with the peace
of society, by giving vent to his emotions.

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:56.450
If I see a beautiful car, do I not desire
to have it?

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:58.391
Why do you prevent me for doing it?

00:03:58.391 --> 00:03:59.670
Will it not be suppression?

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:03.010
Will it not be psychological damage you do
to me?

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:04.210
Let it be.

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:08.560
If I want a beautiful bungalow, why shouldn't
I occupy it?

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:10.260
I want to.

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:16.769
So, human urges are miss-quoted in relation
to sex only.

00:04:16.769 --> 00:04:27.419
Human urges are spread over all the psychic
behavior of men; and to suppress it does not

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:35.510
mean in Freudian words, to destroy something
in man; to suppress it, only means disciplining

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:36.510
it.

00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:44.349
When you discipline it, better society is
born out of that discipline.

00:04:44.349 --> 00:04:47.530
That is what we need today.

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:58.580
Unfortunately, attention is not paid to these
things and we're stepping down into a decadence,

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:06.340
a form of decadence of society, from which
we will not be able to extricate ourselves,

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:08.879
if you do not take proper measures against
it.﻿
