00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:11.500
Alright, you're looking at the new Pinnacle PCTV HD Mini Stick,

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:15.180
that's a lot of letters and numbers and stuff.  It's pretty much they're Pinnacle

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:18.610
HD Stick, or whatever you'd call it, they're little TV tuner, except

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:21.350
it's the mini version, and it's really, really small.

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:25.400
Now check out that image, right now, I am almost, for lack

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:27.310
of a better word, underground, the fact that I'm even getting any reception

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.960
at all is beyond miraculous. So I've got to go ahead and say,

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.200
this is probably one of the cooler TV tuners that I've ever had, just because

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.650
this is the first one that's worked in this room. We're in concrete walls, it's a studio,

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:41.580
you can't any reception in here for anything without a huge antenna,

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:45.780
and this Pinnacle product actually worked, which is great.  So, check it out, you get

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:48.760
some great pictures on this. These things acutally do 1080i.

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:52.330
Now if you don't know where obviously switching to all digital,

00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:56.880
over the air, in the next, coming up this year.  When is it? Anyone remember?

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.870
[February] February 12th? 14th? Something like that.  Mid-February,

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:04.450
this 2009, we're going to all be switching, there's not going to be any more analog.

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.430
So no more rabbit ears, no more grid antennas on top of your house,

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:09.870
it's just going to be small antennas, and this is all you're really going to need,

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:13.830
this little tiny antenna is going to give you HD over the air.  Now this

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:17.880
Pinnacle mini stick does two types of reception.  It does the ATSC,

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:22.340
which is your over the air signal, using your antenna, it is HD; and the other one

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:27.550
it does is the ClearQAM, or Clear-Q-A-M, which is pretty much the unencrypted cable

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:30.890
that comes through your wall, without it going to a set top box.

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.970
It's the stuff that comes right from your wall, right into your TV, it's those basic channels.

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.690
Now also, what's really cool, included in this box, this little mini stick,

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.730
this is actually it right here, I'll show it to you in a second,

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.100
when I kill the television, but it's very small.  It comes with

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:48.500
its own antenna, and I'll tell you what, the other day I used this on a road trip,

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:52.150
it's miraculous.  Get this, this thing is magnetic, and you can actually stick this

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:55.680
on the roof of your car, and it will stay there going like 70, it's awesome.

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.440
And it also comes with this little cable, this is just a regular old USB cable.  It's still

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.360
wound up, I didn't let it go, but this pretty much if you're not

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:04.640
going not to be using this on a laptop, or you're going to just plug this directly in.

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.200
You can pretty much use this to  leave it behind your computer,

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:10.360
so this is not only for mobile users, this is for anybody that wants to get

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:15.300
over the air, or  Clear-Q-A-M signal into their computer.  I'll tell you what,

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:18.150
it doesn't end there, there's even more. Check this out, this is the remote control

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:22.430
that you get with it.  Fantastic. It lets you change channels, increase the volume,

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:28.410
lets you turn on the actual software, and get this, it even lets you record.

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:31.990
You see that little record button right there? Magical, that's because the software

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:36.250
that's included with this, from Pinnacle, actually lets you record, it lets you

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:39.880
use your laptop as a PVR, or a Personal Video Recorder.

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.850
So you can actually look at your TV guide, and all your listings,

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.380
pick a show that you want to see, make it record, and it will automatically

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.190
record it to your computer, it will even pull your computer out of sleep,

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.380
if it needs to, to record something. And as long as you have hard drive space,

00:02:54.710 --> 00:02:59.290
hey you can keep on going until you're blue in the gills with video, no problem.

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:03.150
It will just let you keep going and going and going which is awesome.  It also

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:06.730
lets you pause, rewind, and I tell you what, let's  see this, let's try this out.

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:10.490
I'm going to go ahead and pause this real quick. Hey, look at that.

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:15.580
And let's say I want to back up a little bit-- maybe I didn't have it set up--

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:20.230
oh, yeah I did, there it is.  Look at that, it's backing up.  I mean pausing like that,

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:24.150
it's awesome.  I mean, if you miss a play in a game, all your friends are freaking out,

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:26.150
and you didn't get to see it, you get to watch it here, it's like

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:28.460
being in front of a real TV, except you're either on your laptop

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:31.810
on the road, or you know, you could actually even use this as your real TV

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:34.500
if you wanted to.  Let's say you live in a dorm, and you don't want

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:37.660
to buy a television, you can use a device like this to watch the cable

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:40.880
coming in through wall, on your computer, and it's great,

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:44.110
and you can rewind, which is great; and if you rewound, then you can go

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:46.670
fast forward again too. If you recorded it on your DVR,

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:48.890
you can do everything you want. So, really cool product,

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:51.160
and check this out, they even give you a little pouch, to carry

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:54.880
everything in, and it's antenna is pretty large, but in actuality when

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:58.690
you bring it down to size, it's not that big, and it will even just

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:04.500
unscrew real quick and come apart for easy carrying, and you know what?

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:11.150
The most important part of this whole thing, is this tiny USB drive.  And check it out,

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:13.240
you know how USB drive sometimes get damaged, or you lose the cap,

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.820
well it's just like one of those really awesome flash drives that has no cap.

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:19.480
You just pop it right out, and this can pretty much be carried

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:22.910
with you anywhere, and besides that all you need is this little adapter

00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:25.370
to put it in there, and you can use it with whatever you want.

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:30.300
You can either use the antenna adapter, which is right there, or the Clear-Q-A-M one

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:34.530
for your cables, and you put a coax, you stick this in here, awesome.

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:38.600
So, again, let's do a quick recap of what's happening here.

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:44.570
You're getting Clear-Q-A-M signal, your getting ATSC over the air,

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:49.940
digital hi-def 1080i, ok? You're getting great software

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:53.750
that let's you record anything you want, you can rewind, you can pause, you can

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:57.940
fast forward, you can check your guide and do all that good stuff.  It also even comes

00:04:58.370 --> 00:05:00.940
with video editing software. So let's say you capture something

00:05:01.140 --> 00:05:05.540
and you want to make a little funny clip of it or, you know, do a synopsis of what you saw,

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:08.150
hey, you can do that, if you'd like. This is an awesome product, it even works
