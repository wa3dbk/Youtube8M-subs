00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:14.010
Hi.

00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:17.150
My name is Darrell, and I'm
going to show you how to make

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:23.320
an animation or a molecular
movie using UCSF Chimera.

00:00:23.320 --> 00:00:25.760
There are other packages that
can do this, but with the most

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:31.090
recent update of UCSF Chimera,
we have the best tools ever

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:35.240
built in to any molecular viewer
for making complicated

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:39.650
animated movies to explain just
what you want about your

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:41.140
molecule of choice.

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:44.080
Here we have a protein
loaded up.

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:48.330
And what we're going to do is
work through a series of

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:53.980
scenes, just like a Hollywood
production company might.

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:56.410
You have one scene that
goes to the next

00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:58.380
that goes to the next.

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:00.570
So the first thing we're going
to do is find our initial

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:04.629
scene, which looks something
like this.

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:07.660
And now we save this
scene with the

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:13.000
Tools, Utilities, Animation.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.030
So I have this Animation
panel.

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:21.070
And I set the scene the way
I want it in the 3D view.

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:24.470
And then in the animation,
save the scene.

00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:27.540
There I see a preview
of the scene.

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.220
And now I'm going to come
back to the 3D view

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:32.880
and alter the scene.

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:38.870
Let's say that I want to zoom in
on this particular residue,

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:41.900
right here, or this
actual substrate.

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:43.880
And we'll make this
scene number two.

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:49.640
So come back to the animation,
and now save that scene.

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:53.020
Now let's do a more
complicated scene.

00:01:53.020 --> 00:02:02.760
For example, what if we
now color by rainbow?

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:07.060
So now I'm going to apply a
rainbow, and we can see the

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:09.680
color from blue to red.

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:13.210
So let's set another scene.

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.750
OK.

00:02:13.750 --> 00:02:14.860
How's that for a scene?

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.160
Maybe something like that.

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.650
And I'll save that scene.

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:24.380
And then, finally, let's say
that I want to see a surface.

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:25.700
So I'll create a surface.

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.160
And there we go.

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:34.720
And now this surface--

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:41.820
we're going to color this
surface a different color.

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:48.850
Let's color the surface
to be just cyan.

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:52.210
There it is, our surface.

00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:54.630
In fact, actually, let's color
this surface, instead, by

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:56.420
hydrophobicity.

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:15.300
So Render by Attribute, and
we'll color the surface by the

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:17.780
residue hydrophobicity.

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:20.710
There we go.

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:21.960
Only the surface.

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.040
Here we go.

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:31.870
So hydrophobic is red,
hydrophilic is blue.

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:32.920
There's our surface.

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:39.430
And now, actually, from this
surface, I want to slice it.

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:47.850
So again, we'll Per Model
Clipping, Clip to Surface.

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:49.650
There it is.

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:52.010
Here's our surface to clip.

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:57.320
And zoom in on another scene.

00:03:57.320 --> 00:04:00.650
So there's our new surface.

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:04.635
And I'll save that scene back
here in the animation.

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:11.340
And then finally
zoom out again.

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:21.130
We'll turn off the Per Model
Clipping and instead make the

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:22.800
surface transparent.

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:28.120
This will be our final scene.

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:31.030
Note that this is probably not
the most attractive scene, but

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:34.450
it's a demonstration
of what's possible.

00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:40.170
And finally, save that
scene now, as well.
