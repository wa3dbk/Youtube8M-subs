00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.810
D-Link's enhanced wireless N day/night home
network camera. Or as I like to call it, the

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:06.310
DCS-942L,

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:09.160
is another product in an already great
product line up of my D-Link enabled

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:13.519
network cameras. The DCS-930L made
it easy for a monitor you home, pets, and

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:16.800
children when your way from home, from a
computer, or mobile device.

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.200
The DCS-932L brought you
amazing night vision capabilities,

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:24.710
and now the DCS-942L adds
enhanced motion detection controls,

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:28.310
and a Micro SD card slot for local
recording all while keeping the same

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:35.310
simple set up and no hassle configuration.
Let me show you how to get set up.

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:39.870
First, open up the box in inside you'll
find the product information and the

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:43.310
installation CD.

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:46.859
Followed by the main event, the DCS-942L
network camera,

00:00:46.859 --> 00:00:49.370
but more on that later.

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:52.160
a blue ethernet cable,

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.570
and the power adapter.

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:57.720
Now let's take a closer look at the
device. On the front mic,

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:59.050
IR LED's,

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:02.710
the camera lens, and a passive infrared
sensor for better motion detection.

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:06.000
On the back an ethernet port, a headphone
or speaker jack, power,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.380
and down below the WPS button, 	LED,

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:10.630
reset button, in the power LED.

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:14.930
Now grab the installation CD and head
over to your computer. Insert the CD and

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:18.170
the setup will automatically begin.
Follow the prompts for the installation

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:21.010
CD prepares a computer for setup.

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:25.320
If you're router supports WPS, or
Wi-Fi protected setup, like most D-Link

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.130
routers do, setup is going to be a
breeze because WPS makes it easy

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.090
for your devices to connect to your
wireless network without have to connect the

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:35.010
device to your network with an ethernet
cable or having to remember your

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:38.570
wireless password. But if your router doesn't
we'll cover that set up too in just a

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:39.710
moment.

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:47.310
For WPS plug in and connect the power to
your camera wherever you want it setup.

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:53.549
The cameras ready when you hear a click
and the blue LED flashes once.

00:01:53.549 --> 00:01:57.749
Then press and hold the WPS button
on the back for three seconds, or so,

00:01:57.749 --> 00:02:00.730
until the blue LED's begin to blink.

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:04.210
Now head over to your WPS enabled
router and press the WPS button on it

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:07.570
within sixty seconds and the DCS-942L

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:10.759
will automatically create the wireless
connection to your router. You'll see the

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:15.079
green LED on the back to the
camera when it's connected.

00:02:15.079 --> 00:02:17.409
Now head back to computer and complete
the setup.

00:02:17.409 --> 00:02:21.419
Select "Yes, my router has a WPS button"
and hit next.

00:02:21.419 --> 00:02:25.449
Follow along the prompt until your asked to
select the new camera, if you have more than one,

00:02:25.449 --> 00:02:28.419
and click on "Next" to continue.

00:02:28.419 --> 00:02:31.819
Create a new admin password for the device

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:35.680
and continue until you prompted for your
mydlink account information. But before

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:40.680
we move on here's how to setup the
DCS-942L without WPS.

00:02:42.919 --> 00:02:46.369
Now if your router doesn't support
WPS, start by connecting the included

00:02:46.369 --> 00:02:49.039
blue ethernet cable to the DCS-942L

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:52.949
and the other end into an available LAN port
on your router.

00:02:52.949 --> 00:02:54.699
Connect the power,

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:57.959
and then go back to set up on your
computer.

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:04.959
This time select "No, my router does not
have WPS" and click "Next".

00:03:05.349 --> 00:03:12.349
Follow the prompts and select your new
DCS-942L network camera when asked.

00:03:12.449 --> 00:03:19.449
Hit "Next" and create a new admin
password for device.

00:03:20.609 --> 00:03:21.969
Select wired,

00:03:21.969 --> 00:03:25.189
if you want to keep the camera always
plugged in directly to your router, or

00:03:25.189 --> 00:03:28.739
most likely select wireless to give you greater
flexibility as to where you put the

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:29.999
camera.

00:03:29.999 --> 00:03:33.549
And now set up a scan for available
wireless signals in your area,

00:03:33.549 --> 00:03:37.979
select yours and if your wireless is
secure, as it should be, into your wireless key

00:03:37.979 --> 00:03:40.619
below.

00:03:40.619 --> 00:03:43.219
And then when asked unplug the ethernet
cable

00:03:43.219 --> 00:03:50.109
and give the device a minute to restart
but will skip ahead.

00:03:50.109 --> 00:03:54.489
Now that your camera is connected by WPS
or the standard installation method,

00:03:54.489 --> 00:03:57.369
you need to enter mydlink account
information.

00:03:57.369 --> 00:03:59.420
If you a don't already have one, no problem.

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:01.590
With an e-mail address, password, and your
name,

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:06.029
you can quickly create one. But for now
we'll assume you have one.

00:04:06.029 --> 00:04:07.469
Enter your information,

00:04:07.469 --> 00:04:10.859
and in a moment your new DCS-942L
camera will be added to your

00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:12.089
mydlink account,

00:04:12.089 --> 00:04:15.289
along with any other mydlink enabled
cameras for you to keep an eye on your

00:04:15.289 --> 00:04:17.769
house, kids, or pets when away

00:04:17.769 --> 00:04:19.989
from your computer or mobile device.

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:23.469
Click "Finish" and setup will add a shortcut
onto your desktop

00:04:23.469 --> 00:04:27.830
to make it even easier to access
whenever or wherever.

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:31.030
As you can see the DCS-942L
is a great option for home

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:32.010
monitoring.

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:36.080
And now, being able to record on the Micro
SD card slot on the device allows for

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:40.570
greater flexibility and security by not
having to keep an constant eye on things because

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:43.670
it will all be recorded right on the Micro SD
card for later viewing. Thanks for watching.
