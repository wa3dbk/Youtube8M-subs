[music]

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:14.240
Hi I'm Laura Pazzaglia and today I'm going to show you how

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:17.480
to make the perfect risotto.  Before we can get started

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:20.590
Let's discuss the keys to making the perfect pressure cooker risotto

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:23.600
Since there's no evaporation in the pressure cooker

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.769
the ratios of the grain to liquid

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:30.670
the rice grain to the stock are really important

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:34.370
for arborio rice

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:37.930
the ratio is one cup rice

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:40.940
to two cups stock and you will always get

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:45.640
perfect risotto.  If you don't have a measuring cup

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:49.059
the ratio can be two anything to one anything.

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:54.219
so, one mug of rice and 2 mugs of stock

00:00:54.219 --> 00:00:57.820
one glass of rice, two glasses of stock.

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:00.870
As long as you stick to this ratio it will come out perfect.

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:04.049
I actually have a measuring cup, so that's what I'm going to use.

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.450
I'm a very messy cook,

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:10.530
so this is my trick to keep arborio rice

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:13.880
from going all over the kitchen.

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.799
I put the measuring cup in the bowl.

00:01:17.799 --> 00:01:21.140
I'm doing a double recipe, today.  So that's 2 cups Arborio rice

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:28.140
to four cups stock. OK.

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.750
The next step to perfect pressure cooker risotto is a pre-heated pressure cooker.

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.860
Now, I put that alot in my recipes online and I've gotten a lot of questions

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:41.000
"what do you mean, pre-heated pressure cooker?"

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.820
What it means is, turn on the flame

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:48.140
and heat the base until it's just..

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.790
almost too hot to touch. Today I'm making the risotto

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:56.390
in my pressure braiser - it's a low and wide pressure cooker but you can also

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:00.000
make it in a stock-pot type cooker. This recipe works equally well.

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:03.549
I'm making it in this one so its easier for you to see what I'm doing.

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:07.710
OK, our pressure cooker is pre-heated it's almost too hot for me

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:13.540
to touch so now I'm just going to add the olive oil

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:17.640
I'm adding a pat of butter as well

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:21.300
you want to get these melted

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.459
the next thing you want to add is onion.  Scrape things off the cutting board

00:02:24.459 --> 00:02:30.489
do it with the back part of the knife

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:35.810
[sizzling] if you hear this sound, that means your pressure cooker is pre-heated

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:40.830
You want to get the onions softened, that's another

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:44.680
key step.  Because if the onion goes in the pressure cooker raw

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:49.280
you put raw onion in you get raw onion out the flavor will be

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:54.220
completely preserved the crunchyness, everything after its under pressure.

00:02:54.220 --> 00:03:01.220
Once the onion is softened, what we do now is add the rice.

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:07.310
At first the rice is going to turn translucent slightly transparent from the wetness of the onions

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:14.310
and also the oil and the butter.  You want to get a good coating...

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:23.110
The edges of the rice are turning transparent

00:03:23.110 --> 00:03:27.450
and that's what we want a little transparency

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:31.250
in the rice grain

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:36.200
and... when its toasted it's not like toast.  When we toast the rice for risotto you'd imagine

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:40.299
brown toast.  That's not it at all. What's going to happen is

00:03:40.299 --> 00:03:44.480
the rice is going to turn white again its going to dry up and turn white again

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:48.159
so when it turns white again, its toasted. It's not going to turn brown

00:03:48.159 --> 00:03:52.600
And then we can continue with the recipe

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:56.860
the kernels have turned white and hopefully you can see this.

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:03.860
and that means we can continue with the recipe. The next step is

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:13.370
to add wine [sizzling]

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:17.680
You want to evaporate the wine completely.  You put in raw wine and start pressure cooking

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:21.150
start pressure cooking you get raw wine in the end.

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:24.190
So what you want to do is stir the rice

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:31.190
until all of the wine has completely evaporated.

00:04:40.039 --> 00:04:41.129
Now we add the stock. [pouring]

00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:45.700
Get all of those stray rice grains off the edge of the pressure cooker

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:52.780
and you put on the lid [click] Now that the lid is on you want to turn up the heat to maximum

00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:03.840
[music and light hissing sound of pressure cooker]

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:08.180
[music and light hissing sound of pressure cooker]

00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:12.610
[music and light hissing sound of pressure cooker]

00:05:12.610 --> 00:05:19.610
[music and light hissing sound of pressure cooker]

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:23.729
and once the cooker has come to pressure, we turn it down

00:05:23.729 --> 00:05:28.210
our seven minutes are up

00:05:28.210 --> 00:05:34.340
and now we're going to open our pressure cooker

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:41.340
turn off the heat [SSSHHHHHHHHHHHH] OK

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:48.639
always tilt the lid away from you when opening a pressure cooker

00:05:48.639 --> 00:05:51.919
there's a lot of steam still in here

00:05:51.919 --> 00:05:56.750
whoo!  It's going to look a little bit liquid and that's OK

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:59.949
we just need to stir it up.  We're going to add another small pat of butter.

00:05:59.949 --> 00:06:02.969
I put it on the spoon so I wouldn't forget.

00:06:02.969 --> 00:06:05.979
If you look at this... yea

00:06:05.979 --> 00:06:09.479
and uhm

00:06:09.479 --> 00:06:14.900
about a tablespoon of grated parmigiano reggiano, grana padana or

00:06:14.900 --> 00:06:19.349
pecorino romano whichever you prefer

00:06:19.349 --> 00:06:22.529
about a tablespoon of that

00:06:22.529 --> 00:06:25.889
mix it in

00:06:25.889 --> 00:06:30.210
[music]

00:06:30.210 --> 00:06:34.650
[music]

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:39.089
[music]

00:06:39.089 --> 00:06:45.409
you can see how creamy it is

00:06:45.409 --> 00:06:49.229
and the grains are not burst open

00:06:49.229 --> 00:06:53.409
 

00:06:53.409 --> 00:06:57.560
that's how know it's perfectly cooked. the grains are not burst open

00:06:57.560 --> 00:07:01.940
it's perfectly creamy, grains suspended

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:05.659
in the starch of the rice

00:07:05.659 --> 00:07:10.240
[music]

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:14.630
just a little more cheese - because it's that good

00:07:14.630 --> 00:07:18.089
[click] and here you go

00:07:18.089 --> 00:07:23.759
perfect pressure cooker risotto

00:07:23.759 --> 00:07:30.759
