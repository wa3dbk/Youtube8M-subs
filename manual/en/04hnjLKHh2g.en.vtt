00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:07.210
Now I'll show you how to use a pastry bag.
First you want to hold the pastry bag in your

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:15.790
hand like this, and with your thumb and your
finger, gather up the excess bag on the top.

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:21.990
The fullness of the bag is going to sit in
the palm of your hand like that. Now you can

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:29.880
twist the bag while pinching that top, pinching
the twist, with your thumb and your finger,

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:37.769
in your hand like that. And that causes a
pressure in the bag. You can feel that it

00:00:37.769 --> 00:00:43.019
gets full and tight, and you really want to
hold on tightly with your thumb and finger

00:00:43.019 --> 00:00:53.909
like that. Now you'll use your fingers - the
other four fingers - and your palm to squeeze

00:00:53.909 --> 00:01:00.629
the bag. And as it squeezes the frosting out,
you'll have to continue to turn and twist

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:06.650
the bag while holding on tightly with your
thumb and the edge of your hand right here.

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:16.190
You can see here how as I twist it I'm holding
tightly here, and when I squeeze, the frosting

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:23.500
will come out. And I'm squeezing with my fingers
and my palm. We're just going to use a star

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:31.210
tip and make little stars for our border.
And how you do that is you squeeze, holding

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:37.310
the tip just slightly above the cake. You're
not touching the cake, you're not pushing

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:43.130
the tip into the cake. You're holding it just
a tiny bit above, maybe an eighth of an inch

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:53.730
above the cake, and squeezing. And then before
you lift the tip away, you want to release

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:58.070
pressure. Now if you continue with pressure
while you're lifting, you're going to end

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:04.760
up with a big tip. Okay, let me show you that
again nice and close up. First I'm going to

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:12.659
clean off the tip there. Now you hold the
tip about an eighth of an inch over the surface.

00:02:12.659 --> 00:02:18.790
And you squeeze, until you get a little star.
And you release the pressure of your hand

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:26.681
and lift up at the same time. Now here's what
you don't do. I'm squeezing, squeezing, squeezing

00:02:26.681 --> 00:02:34.129
and then I'm lifting. And I end up with a
big tip here that we don't want. You want

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:41.349
to hold it, squeeze, release pressure, and
pull up. And then you get a nice star.
