00:00:07.617 --> 00:00:10.700
The Wind and the Sun

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:14.033
A Santali folktale

00:00:14.033 --> 00:00:17.033
One afternoon,

00:00:17.033 --> 00:00:20.617
the Wind and the Sun were having an argument

00:00:20.617 --> 00:00:26.533
about who was stronger.

00:00:26.533 --> 00:00:30.783
"I've uprooted huge trees

00:00:30.783 --> 00:00:39.783
and drowned millions of ships.

00:00:39.783 --> 00:00:43.450
You can't do either of those things,"

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:46.867
said the Wind proudly.

00:00:46.867 --> 00:00:48.700
The Sun smiled

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:52.117
and shrugged.

00:00:52.117 --> 00:00:53.533
"That doesn't mean

00:00:53.533 --> 00:01:03.700
you're more powerful," he said.

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:06.867
"I can cover you with clouds

00:01:06.867 --> 00:01:10.367
so that no one can see you!

00:01:10.367 --> 00:01:13.033
You can't do that to me,"

00:01:13.033 --> 00:01:17.200
said the Wind.

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:23.117
But the Sun just smiled warmly.

00:01:23.117 --> 00:01:25.617
"I still think

00:01:25.617 --> 00:01:28.950
I'm stronger than you,"

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:36.950
he said calmly.

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.367
The Wind began to grumble.

00:01:39.367 --> 00:01:41.950
He didn't like the idea

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:49.700
of the Sun being stronger than him.

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.283
"Why don't we have a test?"

00:01:52.283 --> 00:01:56.450
the Wind finally suggested.

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:01.200
He whipped around, looking for something

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:08.367
to show off his strength.

00:02:08.367 --> 00:02:10.950
"Shall we see who can knock down

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.950
the most number of houses?"

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:19.950
he asked. "Let's keep it simple.

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.200
See that man over there?"

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.450
asked the Sun.

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:26.450
The Wind looked down

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.700
and saw a man

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.117
walking down a road.

00:02:31.117 --> 00:02:35.867
He was whistling happily to himself

00:02:35.867 --> 00:02:42.450
and had a shawl thrown across his shoulders.

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.033
"Shall we see who can force him

00:02:45.033 --> 00:02:48.033
off the road first?"

00:02:48.033 --> 00:02:54.450
the Wind asked.

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.867
"No, that will only hurt him,”

00:02:57.867 --> 00:03:00.200
the Sun replied.

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:02.950
“Let's just see who can

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:07.950
take his shawl off.”

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:10.867
The Wind shrugged

00:03:10.867 --> 00:03:15.033
and whipped around the sky.

00:03:15.033 --> 00:03:17.950
He huffed and puffed

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:21.617
and made the leaves in the trees shiver.

00:03:21.617 --> 00:03:24.867
The man frowned at the sky

00:03:24.867 --> 00:03:26.950
and wrapped his shawl

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:30.367
tightly around himself.

00:03:30.367 --> 00:03:32.367
Thunderclouds

00:03:32.367 --> 00:03:34.617
appeared in the sky.

00:03:34.617 --> 00:03:38.450
Animals began running for shelter

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:46.533
and the Wind began to roar.

00:03:46.533 --> 00:03:49.033
The man wrapped his shawl

00:03:49.033 --> 00:03:51.617
even tighter.

00:03:51.617 --> 00:03:53.533
Soon

00:03:53.533 --> 00:03:56.783
the thunderclouds drifted away.

00:03:56.783 --> 00:03:59.700
The Wind had blown himself out.

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:02.950
"I give up. I can't do it,"

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:11.367
panted the Wind.

00:04:11.367 --> 00:04:14.617
He curled up on top of a cloud

00:04:14.617 --> 00:04:21.200
to catch his breath.

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:26.617
"Now it's my turn," said the Sun.

00:04:26.617 --> 00:04:29.450
He yawned lazily

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:33.033
and stretched his rays.

00:04:33.033 --> 00:04:36.283
He seemed to grow

00:04:36.283 --> 00:04:39.950
brighter and bigger in the sky.

00:04:39.950 --> 00:04:43.200
Soon it was as hot

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:46.533
as a summer day.

00:04:46.533 --> 00:04:50.367
The man looked up at the sky

00:04:50.367 --> 00:04:55.867
and wiped the sweat off his forehead.

00:04:55.867 --> 00:04:57.617
"What strange weather

00:04:57.617 --> 00:04:59.367
we're having today!"

00:04:59.367 --> 00:05:04.700
he said to himself.

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:07.783
Then he took his shawl off

00:05:07.783 --> 00:05:12.533
and tucked it under his arm.

00:05:12.533 --> 00:05:15.700
"Looks like you win,"

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:22.783
the Wind agreed cheerfully.

00:05:22.783 --> 00:05:25.117
He clapped his hands and made

00:05:25.117 --> 00:05:30.033
the leaves on the trees rustle.

00:05:30.033 --> 00:05:32.950
"You don't have to knock a man down

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:35.700
to take his shawl off,"

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:42.783
said the Sun with a teasing smile.

00:05:42.783 --> 00:05:45.867
They laughed together and watched

00:05:45.867 --> 00:05:48.450
the man walking down the road,

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:52.450
again whistling happily to himself.
