00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:15.280
So we already know full well just how good
a sports car the Toyota GT86 is.

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:22.280
We love it for all sorts of reasons. But there
is a but and it is this. The handling on this

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:30.279
car is so sweet and so is the steering and
so are the brakes, etc. But it's always been

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:37.279
calling out for just a little bit more poke.
Well, now it's got some. And this is it. The

00:00:39.839 --> 00:00:45.420
new GT86 Turbo by Fensport.
It costs, with everything on it, which is

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:51.629
a suspension kit to put it 25 millimetres
lower, it looks great on the road. 19 inch

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:57.449
wheels and tyres. Obviously the turbo kit
to give you 250, 260 horse power.

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:04.449
All up, that lot. It's also got a brake kit,
sorry. All up, that lot costs about Â£8,000.

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:13.410
The lovely thing is the torque. You've got
nearly a hundred pounds feet more torque than

00:01:17.130 --> 00:01:19.890
the standard GT86. Which means finally, when
you put your foot down, it really goes, properly.

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:26.890
This has unlocked the real magic in the GT86.
I love it.

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:34.000
But there is just one more GT86 to try today.
And that

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:40.130
one's got even more power and an awful lot
more performance. So I think it's time to

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:44.649
have a little go in that.

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:51.649
And this is pretty much the ultimate incarnation
of the GT86 Turbo at the moment. This is Fensport's

00:01:53.229 --> 00:02:00.229
full on racer. It's got slicks. It's got 335
horse power. It only weighs just over 1,100

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.069
kilogrammes.
It's got that proper competition car feel

00:02:07.069 --> 00:02:14.069
to its ride, to its interior. Everything about
this thing just says, "Go fast. Drive me fast."

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:20.300
So let's have a go.

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:27.300
It is very loud. It's quite fast in a straight
line as well. It just, you touch the brake

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:43.210
pedal, and bang, it stops. 
Lovely steering as well.

00:02:43.210 --> 00:02:50.210
They haven't changed the geometry, but it
just steers beautifully.

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:03.410
Can you hear that popping and banging? 
It's not the grip, it's not the steering, it's

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:07.990
not the gearbox, it's the performance. The
performance in this thing is

00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:10.100
outrageous.
But do you know what? Here's the thing. The

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:15.230
engine in this car and the turbo kit that's
fitted to it, is fundamentally the same as

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:20.140
the one that's in the black car. All they've
done is just, they've fitted a different turbo

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:23.830
actuator and they've just tweaked it here
and there.

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:27.069
So you
can have this engine in the road going black

00:03:27.069 --> 00:03:34.069
car. And I can't quite imagine how much fun
that would be on the road. Or how fast the

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:37.140
GT86 could be made to go on the road.

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:42.030
There is just one more thing we need to do
with our GT86 experiment, though. And that's

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:49.030
to see just how fast this one, the racer,
can go around this track compared with one

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:56.910
of, if not the fastest road cars that money
can buy at the moment. And that's the McLaren

00:03:58.230 --> 00:03:59.550
MP4-12C.

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:06.550
Can I stay with the GT86 and I'm in the McLaren.
I mean, what I've asked Adrian to do is go

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:18.880
kind of 90%. Just to see how hard I've got
to try.

00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:25.880
The McLaren is definitely quicker in a straight
line. Definitely. In the corners and on the

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:33.860
brakes he's just, he really does have me covered,
I'm afraid.

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:41.400
Oh, they're so closely matched. I mean, on
a stop watch, we were talking about kind of

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:54.870
3/10ths of a second. I mean, what does that
say about a tuned GT86, how good it is?

00:04:55.410 --> 00:05:02.410
But I'm only - look at this, it's crackers
just to stay with him. Oh my word. He's sideways

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:12.310
through every corner. Oh man. It's outrageous
fun.

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:31.050
I don't know what we learned from that. Other
than the fact that that GT86 is an outrageously

00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:43.130
fast, I mean, crackers fast. And it will
go very sideways.

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:48.830
I'm having to drive the McLaren's gull wing
doors off just to try and stay with him. I

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:55.830
think it proves that basically the GT86 in
all its forms, is just a fantastic piece of

00:05:58.410 --> 00:05:58.860
kit.

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:04.780
And the more you do to it, the more berserk
it is and the more fun it is. What a top day

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:10.340
out. What a fantastic car the GT86 is, and
the McLaren's not bad either, actually.
