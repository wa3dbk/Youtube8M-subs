00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:22.900
For this recipe you will need two bowls

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:27.380
In the first bowl add the water,the sugar and the cocoa powder

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.000
Give it a good stir so that they are well combined

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:38.400
Don't mind of any lumps

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:42.860
Now set it aside

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.120
And in the second bowl

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:51.900
add the vegetable whipped cream and make your hand mixer to make it soft and fluffy(I meant smooth!)

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.420
Now add the powder or icing sugar and use again your hand mixer

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:21.060
to mix them all together

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:34.880
At last add the sweet condensed milk

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:41.460
and use again your hand mixer

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.680
When everything is mixed

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:06.000
take your baking dish or baking pan

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.040
dip each biscuit in the cocoa mixture

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:17.780
and place them into your pan so you can fill it up

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.920
Divide the cream mixture in two halfs

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.900
Add the first one but be careful not to mix the cream with the cocoa from the biscuits

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.320
Continue with the rest of the biscuits

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:52.420
When you're done with the biscuits add the second half of the cream

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:04.680
Spread it very well so there are not any gaps(empty spaces)

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:18.660
As a last step spread the whole surface with chocolate flakes

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:23.980
Put it in the fridge for at least 3 hours,even better through the night

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:31.560
I hope you like it ,send me some pictures

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:32.480

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:36.220
Bye!
