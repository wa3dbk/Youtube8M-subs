00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:25.590
Overlooking the Arkansas River, there exists
a place that's home to a menagerie of plants

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.970
and animals.

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:32.640
It's a happy farm, filled with ducks, geese,
chickens and turkeys.

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:39.110
P. Allen Smith, the primary human resident,
loves his animals, and recently added a flock

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:42.590
of White Dorper sheep to the farm family.

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:46.400
They're an African breed that easily adapt
to life in the South.

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:55.200
This is Moss Mountain Farm.

00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:02.120
But while life on the farm is sunny, in the
vast wilderness surrounding the farm, evil

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:03.120
lurks.

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:09.170
Coyotes, foxes, bears and others lie in wait
for the perfect opportunity to make a meal

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:11.710
of one the farm family members.

00:01:11.710 --> 00:01:26.360
These predators have laid waste to countless
residents of Moss Mountain.

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:42.649
So to protect his animals from these varmints,
Allen has gone in search of protectors for

00:01:42.649 --> 00:02:01.440
his flock.

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:07.810
The Anatolian Shepherd breed, developed more
than 6000 years ago in what now is Turkey.

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:10.380
They were working dogs, but not herders.

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:15.210
Instead, they would spend their lives with
shepherds, protecting them and their flocks

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:21.140
from the wild animals in that rugged terrain.

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:57.220
Our heroines have been chosen: Smudge and
Squeak.

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:59.319
Their new digs are pretty sweet.

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:04.610
Plenty of food and water, and that comfy blanket
can't be beat.

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:09.439
So now, let's see how well these little gals
will do on their quest to protect their new

00:03:09.439 --> 00:03:10.730
family.

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:12.370
Will they succeed?

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:14.580
Will they keep evil at bay?

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:24.489
Or, will they just nap?

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:28.530
We find Smudge and Squeak on their first morning
at the farm.

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:33.810
This is prime bonding time, so for now they'll
stay in a smaller paddock with some of their

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:48.620
new family members.

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:59.670
There's work to be done and lessons to be
learned.

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:02.550
Smudge is curious about her new roommates.

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:08.159
Following close by as the rounds are made,
looking into every nook and cranny, she wants

00:04:08.159 --> 00:04:10.489
to know all about every animal she encounters.

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:18.310
But a nip on the nose from a protective mother
will teach her about boundaries.

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:23.560
Squeak has a different approach to the whole
ordeal: She's going to let Smudge mess with

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:25.120
all this recognizance.

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:32.750
Squeak is saving her energy for when it's
really needed.

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:38.270
After a long day on the job, it's bath time.

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:41.530
Alright, girls.

00:04:41.530 --> 00:04:46.850
This may be something you're not gonna like.

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:50.890
Although the water is warm, our girls are
hesitant to dive right in.

00:04:50.890 --> 00:05:00.570
But alas, Allen is much too big and easily
makes the decision for them.

00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:03.530
Smudge will brave this new experience first.

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:07.860
With Squeak looking on, she allows Allen to
clean her up.

00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:26.090
You're gonna be the cleanest Anatolian Shepherds
in the whole world.

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:28.260
Squeak is tentative as well.

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:33.690
But after a little assurance from Allen, she
goes forth as well, leaving Smudge to watch

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:36.510
over the towels.

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:43.670
You wanna shake?

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:46.050
Okay.

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:50.820
Just relax.

00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:55.590
Just relax.

00:05:55.590 --> 00:06:07.520
Okay, go find your sister.

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:10.200
These two have a lot of work ahead of them.

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:15.990
But for now, with baths over, it's time to
get in a little playtime before then, because

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:18.140
they'll need their rest for what's to come.
