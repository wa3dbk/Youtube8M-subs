00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Hi, there! This time I want to introduce you to my newest work

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.000
the 25-piece human, cat, goat and zombie eyeball set!

00:00:13.645 --> 00:00:15.645
ok... let's...

00:00:16.441 --> 00:00:20.441
let's start by explaining the first eye object...

00:00:20.441 --> 00:00:26.441
The low poly human eye is the base for the rest of the eyeballs

00:00:26.441 --> 00:00:32.441
it has around 300 triangles and procedural shaders, and I included it in the set

00:00:32.441 --> 00:00:38.441
Because, you know, with a subdivision modifier, it's almost like the rest

00:00:38.441 --> 00:00:44.441
and maybe you can use it as a base to make your own custom eye.

00:00:44.441 --> 00:00:51.441
Now, let's see the human eye... but the normal version, not the low poly one.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Human, cat and goat eyeballs have a shapekey to open the iris

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.539
I'm gonna show you the cat eye, now

00:01:05.593 --> 00:01:11.593
You can see, the cat iris works the same way...

00:01:11.593 --> 00:01:15.593
and now in Cycles Preview

00:01:16.072 --> 00:01:19.072
Let's go to the next layer...

00:01:19.684 --> 00:01:22.684
and check the goat eyeball...

00:01:22.684 --> 00:01:26.684
This one works the other way around

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.700
 the shape key closes the iris instead

00:01:37.746 --> 00:01:40.746
And finally, the zombie eye!

00:01:40.746 --> 00:01:45.746
We have six variations like the other eye types

00:01:45.746 --> 00:01:51.746
Blue eye, yellow eye, blue decayed, yellow decayed...

00:01:51.746 --> 00:01:58.246
Also there's undead orange with bloody sclera and black sclera

00:02:03.112 --> 00:02:09.112
Now, let's see how the textures and materials work

00:02:12.496 --> 00:02:18.496
I'm gonna open a new window here, and go into the node editor

00:02:18.885 --> 00:02:25.885
so, there's 4 materials per eye, and the 
materials are linked to the objects, not the data

00:02:25.885 --> 00:02:31.885
this way, you can have instanced copies of the same eyeball with different shaders

00:02:31.885 --> 00:02:37.885
I'm using the same texture for all irises, but using masks to modify their color

00:02:37.885 --> 00:02:43.885
Like this dark brown iris here. If I mute the color nodes, you can see the original texture

00:02:43.885 --> 00:02:47.885
Let's play a little and make a new color

00:02:50.358 --> 00:02:53.358
some Liz Taylor purple eye

00:02:54.799 --> 00:02:57.799
There you go

00:02:59.291 --> 00:03:03.291
Now I'm going to show you the RGB masks

00:03:03.291 --> 00:03:09.291
And the special node group to extract the different channels as masks

00:03:09.291 --> 00:03:15.291
As you can see, each color channel produces a different radial gradient

00:03:15.291 --> 00:03:21.291
You can use one, two or all of them to make color effects on the iris

00:03:26.575 --> 00:03:30.575
Ok, let's talk about the sclera materials

00:03:30.575 --> 00:03:34.575
This works in the same way the iris mask does

00:03:34.575 --> 00:03:40.575
I use my RGB mask node to separate and edit the 3 masks in the texture:

00:03:40.575 --> 00:03:46.575
one of the channels have the gradient, and the other 2 are vein layers

00:03:46.575 --> 00:03:54.375
One of the outer eye materials also uses this technique to add decay and blood for the zombie eye

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:02.500
I use the direct mix as an alpha mask, and the separated channels to add different color layers

00:04:03.302 --> 00:04:09.302
this kinda give a cloudy effect... like a blind person's eye

00:04:09.302 --> 00:04:15.302
So, you can play with the 3 channels, and give different levels of decay

00:04:27.026 --> 00:04:30.026
Ok, let's see the textures.

00:04:30.625 --> 00:04:35.625
 I need to open the UV editor...

00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:37.310
This is the diffuse map for the iris

00:04:39.113 --> 00:04:45.113
I'm working with a diffuse map and a normal map for all irises

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:54.500
I'm changing both diffuse and normal by just adjusting the map coordinates

00:04:54.500 --> 00:05:00.500
I just need to move the texture in the X or Y direction, and we will have another iris image

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:08.000
see? The cat texture won't work very good with the goat mesh, but the human and zombie will

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.500
You can play and have multiple variations

00:05:22.995 --> 00:05:26.995
This is the node group included in the package

00:05:26.995 --> 00:05:31.995
No big mistery, just a RGB channel separator

00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:44.680
There's a normal map for the iris, too

00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:49.680
 and this is the RGB mask texture

00:05:53.086 --> 00:05:56.086
Ok, well, that's all...

00:05:56.086 --> 00:06:01.086
This eyeball set will be soon available through Blender Market

00:06:01.086 --> 00:06:04.086
I will add the link later...

00:06:04.086 --> 00:06:08.086
Thakns for watching and don't forget to subscribe!
