00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:14.059
Petrichor is the smell of dust after rain.
It’s a combination of plant oils, bacteria

00:00:14.059 --> 00:00:19.540
and ozone. But this doesn’t tell the whole
story. Petrichor smells, well dusty. How does

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:21.510
the smell get from the ground to our noses?

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:26.520
A recent study from researchers at MIT suggests
an aerosol effect is a main cause of the smell

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:28.140
of dust after a light rain.

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.230
We all know it. On a summer day when the air
has been stale and hot for days and suddenly

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:36.270
a summer shower provides relief. When we venture
outside to greet the world anew, we’re met

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.739
with one of the most unique smells on the
planet. It’s a smell as old as time itself,

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:45.719
but it went without a name for a surprisingly
long time. Petrichor was coined by two scientists,

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:50.670
Isabel Joy Bear and R. G. Thomas of Australia's
Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:56.789
Organization, in 1964. The word uses Greek
terms, Petra-meaning stone, and ichor, the

00:00:56.789 --> 00:00:59.059
special substance that flows in the veins
of gods.

00:00:59.059 --> 00:01:03.930
But the mechanism behind Petrichor was a bit
of a mystery until MIT scientists captured

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:09.050
slow motion images of falling water drops.
The videos revealed that rain drops trap air

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:13.580
bubbles. When they hit the ground, the bubbles
capture small molecules from the soil. These

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:19.700
molecules bubble up and release aerosols,
not unlike the bubbles in a glass of champagne.

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:24.909
Capturing this common occurrence took a little
while. The scientists performed over 600 experiments

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:30.521
dropping water on 28 different surfaces. 12
artificial surfaces and 16 soil samples. To

00:01:30.521 --> 00:01:34.130
recreate the different types of rainfall,
light and heavy and everything in between,

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:38.570
they varied the height. The higher the drop,
the faster it fell. They found a Goldilocks

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:42.270
effect. The most aerosols were produced when
the porous surface wasn’t too wet or too

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:46.570
dry and when the rain wasn’t too fast or
too slow. If the rain falls too fast, there’s

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:50.780
not enough time for the bubbles to form. So
that’s how the smell gets in the air, but

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:52.330
what is the smell made up of?

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:56.880
Previous studies suggest that the smell comes
from oil given off by plants during dry periods

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:58.799
that falls on top clay and dirt.

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:02.590
Speaking of dirt, another part of petrichor
comes from bacteria from the genus ACT TIN

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:06.289
O MY SEAT TEES actinomycetes. The same bacteria
that are responsible for a recent break in

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:10.570
antibiotics. When these bacteria die, they
release an organic compound called Geosmin,

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:14.370
which comes from the greek “earth smell”.
This is the damp, musty, strong well, earthy

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:19.470
smell after a storm. Human noses are extremely
sensitive to the compound, we sniff it out

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:24.280
it just 5 parts per TRILLION. It’s a harmless
chemical, while we love it outside, it can

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.950
reduce the quality of drinking water and wine.

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:31.660
The smell of storms comes from ozone. A word
which also has it’s roots in greek for “smell”.

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:35.600
Ozone is an alternative form of oxygen. While
ground level Ozone is an icky, harmful smog,

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:39.210
atmospheric Ozone helps block some of the
sun’s most damaging rays. Storm-related

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:43.710
ozone is created when an electrical charge
splits atmospheric nitrogen and oxygen molecules

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:48.751
into separate atoms. A few chemical reactions
later, the oxygen reorganizes itself. Most

00:02:48.751 --> 00:02:53.880
atmospheric oxygen is made up of two atoms.
the typical O2. Yet during a storm, the reorganized

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:58.950
oxygen forms O3. The O3 is pushed down from
the atmosphere by downdrafts, allowing us

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:01.590
to sniff this stormy scent.

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:06.340
Scientist still haven’t found a way to bottle
Petrichor. They’ve tried. How many candles

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:12.810
and laundry detergents have names like “spring
rain”. Most artificial scents haven’t

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:17.590
come close because Petrichor is so complex
and some compounds exist only in small traces

00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:21.760
that can’t be detected by some machines.
I wish they’d hurry up though, I’m tired

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:22.760
of waiting.

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:28.090
