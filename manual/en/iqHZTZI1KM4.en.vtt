00:00:00.021 --> 00:00:00.520
Hi.

00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:02.163
I'm Emily from
Marketing, and today I'

00:00:02.163 --> 00:00:04.140
going to show you what's
in my grooming bag.

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.580
I have a 19-year-old Appendix
Quarter Horse gelding named JZ,

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.490
and I've had him
since he was six,

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:13.340
so we've been together
for a really long time.

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:15.750
And you'll notice
in my grooming bag

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.590
that I have a lot of stuff
that like scratches him,

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.004
because he tends to be like
the world's itchiest horse,

00:00:23.004 --> 00:00:24.670
so you'll see lots
of curries and things

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:27.000
like that in my bag today.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.340
Speaking of my bag, this is
the Rockin' SP Quilted Arena

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:34.490
Bag by Big D. I love this
bag, because first of all,

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:37.130
it's beautiful with
this quilting pattern.

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:39.900
It has a slight
sheen to the fabric.

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:43.070
It has complementary
piping and stitching,

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:45.140
but it's also really,
really functional.

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:49.577
So on the bottom, it's all
mesh, so that means dirt can

00:00:49.577 --> 00:00:51.630
fall right out, which is great.

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:53.370
And it has a ton of
pockets and space

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.691
inside, so it fits
everything I need.

00:00:56.691 --> 00:00:58.190
The handles are
really nice as well.

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:01.200
You can throw it over your
shoulder, carry it around,

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:03.480
makes everything
really convenient.

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.850
It also has this
great clip feature,

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.640
which means I can put
it on in the ringside

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:14.020
or in a grooming stall, and
just hang it up so I'm not

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:17.354
constantly bending over.

00:01:17.354 --> 00:01:19.520
So the first thing I have
here, it's a little dirty,

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:22.350
but just a monogram
towel, so I can wipe him

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.660
down, wipe my hands
off, that sort of thing

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:27.780
when I'm at the barn.

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.780
And then inside-- it also
has a really durable zipper.

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.146
I feel like this thing
is going to last forever.

00:01:40.545 --> 00:01:42.800
So I guess I'll go
through my brushes first.

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.730
I just have like a standard
medium brush, which

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:46.990
is kind of my everyday brush.

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:52.150
I have one of these
great Oster face brushes.

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:54.280
They're really soft,
so I use it to kind

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.770
of finish off his
coats, and then

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:59.623
on his face as well,
but really, really soft.

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:08.550
So the start of all
my curries-- this

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:09.940
is, I think it's called the

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.580
Jelly Curry, but I mostly
use this for bathing,

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.730
because it's a nice plastic.

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:16.250
It's been winter
here, so it hasn't

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.920
been used in awhile, which
is why it's so dirty.

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.960
But it's got kind of a really
bumpy side and then like a more

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:24.800
like fine bumpy side.

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.550
I mostly use this side,
and it's really nice

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:29.755
to them lathered and get
right down to the skin when

00:02:29.755 --> 00:02:30.630
you're giving a bath.

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:38.660
The scrub mitt-- this
is JZ's favorite.

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:41.290
Normally intended for
bathing, but he actually

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:43.740
loves to like scratch
his face on this,

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:47.630
so I just hold up my hand, and
he just goes to town and rubs

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:50.850
his had all over this
as soon as I get it out.

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:53.040
So this is great for that.

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.240
I also use it to curry
his body, especially

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:57.910
in the summer where his
hair's not very thick.

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:58.910
This does a nice job.

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.520
My best friend right
now-- the Shedding Blade.

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:07.590
Our horses are
finally shedding out,

00:03:07.590 --> 00:03:09.010
and I'm using this constantly.

00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:15.720
And then there's little curry.

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:17.550
This one is just a nice massage.

00:03:17.550 --> 00:03:21.660
It's really, really
flexible, so again, I just

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:23.520
use this to get out
all of his itchies.

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:31.070
And then I have a
traditional black curry.

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:34.180
Same story here.

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:37.030
I think that's it
for my curries.

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:39.420
Classic Oster Mane
and Tail Brush-- this

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.530
is one of my favorites.

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:44.370
I've been really particular
about his forelock lately,

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:46.890
because he got into
some burrs last fall.

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:49.990
I don't even know how, but
his hair was so tangled

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:52.550
that I had to like completely
cut off his forelock, which

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:53.270
was really sad.

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:55.740
He had a mohawk, so
I've been taking really

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:58.360
care to delicately brush
that, so it grows back.

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:01.980
It's looking much better
this spring, thank goodness.

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:06.490
Speaking of brushes, I also have
this little tiny Face Brush,

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:09.160
which is like the cutest
thing I've ever seen.

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:11.190
And it's literally so soft.

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:13.360
It's like softer than
some of my makeup brushes.

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:15.000
I love it.

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.810
I don't generally use this
on his face, actually.

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:21.170
I most often use it
to brush off my boots

00:04:21.170 --> 00:04:22.800
before I'm going
into the show ring,

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:26.996
because it does a really
nice job of taking dust off,

00:04:26.996 --> 00:04:29.370
and it's so soft that it
doesn't scratch my boots either.

00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:31.315
So nice little trick
with this brush.

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:38.400
Moving on into
topical products, I

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:42.390
have my favorite World
Champion Pepi Coat Conditioner.

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:45.530
This puts such a nice
shine onto the coat.

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:48.170
It just makes JZ gleam.

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:49.660
It's aerosol, which
is really nice.

00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:53.420
You don't get any big wet spots,
and it smells really good, too.

00:04:53.420 --> 00:04:56.400
So this is great before
you go into the show ring.

00:04:59.310 --> 00:05:02.346
Another one of my favorites
is the Banixx Wound Care.

00:05:02.346 --> 00:05:03.970
So this is just a
little sample bottle,

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:07.135
but I have a bigger bottle as
well, but just great to spray

00:05:07.135 --> 00:05:08.922
onto any wounds and infections.

00:05:08.922 --> 00:05:10.005
I always have this around.

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:16.370
So this is Absorbine
Botanicals, which

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:20.230
is a natural herbal
liniment, and this actually

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:22.160
is massage foam.

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:28.363
So it's really,
really easy to use.

00:05:28.363 --> 00:05:29.050
Oh, my god.

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:30.370
It smells so good.

00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:31.340
It's just nice.

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:35.320
I use it on JZ
after a hard ride,

00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:37.610
just to make sure
he feels his best.

00:05:37.610 --> 00:05:40.330
I put it down his
legs and stuff.

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:42.280
Really easy to
apply with the foam,

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:43.580
and it does a really great job.

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:44.610
I love this stuff.

00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:52.030
Also have a classic Bag Balm.

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:53.060
This is just a staple.

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:55.780
Any little cuts,
nicks, I just-- a skin

00:05:55.780 --> 00:05:58.110
irritation-- I just slather
some of this stuff on,

00:05:58.110 --> 00:05:58.970
and it's a classic.

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:06.610
Another balm is
the AG Silver Balm,

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:09.170
which is good for,
again, scratches,

00:06:09.170 --> 00:06:11.950
infection, irritation.

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:15.420
It's this like really
nice blue balm,

00:06:15.420 --> 00:06:18.090
and it stays in
place really well.

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:22.710
So this is great for
skin irritation, too.

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:27.130
So this is one of my newest
most favorite products.

00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:30.090
It's SmartPak's new fly
spray called OutSmart.

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:34.320
And while we don't have a lot
of flies in Massachusetts yet,

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:35.922
we do have ticks.

00:06:35.922 --> 00:06:37.880
So that's mostly what
I've been using this for,

00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:40.720
but I can't wait to try
it on flies and mosquitoes

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:42.910
in the summertime, too.

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:46.920
But this is nontoxic and
safe for horse and rider,

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:48.420
which is great.

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:52.400
I've never found anything
that's safe and also effective,

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:55.110
and this really combines
the two of those.

00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:59.540
So I spray it on JZ before
he goes out in turnout, just

00:06:59.540 --> 00:07:02.280
to help keep ticks away,
and then I'm looking forward

00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:05.545
to spraying it on
myself before we go out

00:07:05.545 --> 00:07:07.171
for rides this summer.

00:07:07.171 --> 00:07:07.670
OK.

00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:08.380
I'm still going.

00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:11.430
I feel like this is like
Mary Poppins's endless bag.

00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:13.980
Classic little hoof pick here.

00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:16.110
This one has a nice grip.

00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:17.840
Pretty standard,
but holds up well.

00:07:23.510 --> 00:07:25.150
Double-ended snaps.

00:07:25.150 --> 00:07:27.200
JZ is an escape artist.

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:29.110
He knows how to
opens stall doors.

00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:29.760
He gets out.

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:35.700
It's not good, so he does have
a hook closure on his stall now.

00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:38.100
But I just keep some
double-ended snaps around,

00:07:38.100 --> 00:07:40.390
as well, in case I need them
for something else, too.

00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:50.970
So lastly, some treats,
some Horse Nibbles.

00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:52.970
They smell amazing.

00:07:52.970 --> 00:07:54.100
Nice, crunchy treat.

00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:58.270
One of his favorites, but he
likes pretty much all treats.

00:07:58.270 --> 00:08:01.092
So when he's a good boy,
he gets a little reward.

00:08:01.092 --> 00:08:02.550
