00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:07.370
Today I'm going to show you how to do a rosemary
lemon chicken.

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:12.460
Chicken is a really versatile piece of meat
that you can impart all kinds of flavors into.

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:17.710
When you're thinking barbeque, you don't always
have to think the traditional tomato based

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:18.710
barbecue.

00:00:18.710 --> 00:00:24.460
You can also think of things like this, which
are going to give it a nice and really fresh

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:25.460
taste.

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:28.870
It's a real simple wet rub marinade that we're
going to make.

00:00:28.870 --> 00:00:44.210
I'm going to take a little but of extra virgin
olive oil, some lemon juice, garlic, chopped

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:49.030
fresh rosemary and some lemon zest.

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:55.531
We're going to take our finger, mix it up,
don't be afraid because we're going to be

00:00:55.531 --> 00:00:58.360
using our fingers here on the chicken.

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:07.180
So we move these over and we're going to bring
our chicken up here.

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:18.090
What I like to do is get the skin like this,
so you have a nice cavity, bring this marinade

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:22.290
up here and stuff it in there.

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.270
It's going to give it a real nice flavor.

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:30.290
It's going to really penetrate the meat when
you let this sit.

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:37.960
You can let this sit overnight, but I would
do it for at least 10 minutes to an hour.

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:44.180
But the longer you do it, up to overnight,
is definitely going to only make it that much

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:46.640
more intense in flavor.

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:52.740
Then what I like to do is take a little bit
more extra virgin olive oil and sprinkle it

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:59.270
over the top of these and work that into the
skin.

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:03.500
Then, we're going to take some of our all-purpose
all american spice rub.

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.720
You can use any over the counter spice rub,
you can use salt and pepper, or you can use

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:10.030
a spice rub that you make your own.

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:12.000
This is a pork barrel spice rub.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.480
I'm going to lightly coat the top.

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:24.040
You just want this to kind of meld with that
garlic, rosemary, that you've got in here,

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:25.040
and lemon juice.

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:35.330
Then I'm going to poor the remainder over
the top and set this in the refrigerator for

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:38.590
somewhere over 30 minutes to overnight.

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:42.620
The longer you let that set, the more it's
going to penetrate and give you a really great

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:45.860
rosemary, garlic, lemony flavor.

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:49.602
But if you're in a rush, give at least 10
minutes to 60 minutes.

00:02:49.602 --> 00:02:53.720
So, while you're letting that sit, go out
and get your grill started and you'll still

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:55.100
have a really nice meal.

00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:58.960
So, let's put these in the refrigerator, head
out to the grill and get that started, and

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:00.340
we'll get these on here shortly.
