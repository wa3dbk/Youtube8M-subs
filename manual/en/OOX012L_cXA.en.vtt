00:00:00.119 --> 00:00:01.035
Hello fans of fitness.

00:00:01.035 --> 00:00:01.940
It's me and Kameron.

00:00:01.940 --> 00:00:04.650
That's right, she's a P90 graduate.

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:07.480
Tell us a little bit though before
we begin about your P90 story.

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:09.750
I came into the
program, and I totally

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:10.990
did not know what to expect.

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:14.996
But after the 90 days, I was
completely amazed with my results.

00:00:14.996 --> 00:00:16.329
So how many pounds did you lose?

00:00:16.329 --> 00:00:17.121
31 pounds.

00:00:17.121 --> 00:00:17.820
31 pounds.

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:21.932
This is a 44-year-old
woman with a 20--

00:00:21.932 --> 00:00:23.134
22-year-old daughter.

00:00:23.134 --> 00:00:24.175
And another daughter too.

00:00:24.175 --> 00:00:25.045
16 as well.

00:00:25.045 --> 00:00:26.730
16.
Now both my daughters are athletes.

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:29.035
My 22-year-old is a track
athlete and my 16-year-old

00:00:29.035 --> 00:00:30.280
is a volleyball athlete.

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:33.721
So I kind of joined this
program to keep up with them.

00:00:33.721 --> 00:00:35.190
That's amazing.
Incredible results.

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:35.600
Thank you.

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.840
And now here it is, the test
group has finished a while a go.

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:38.820
Still living the dream.

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:41.800
And part of the dream is
learning how to cook properly.

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:44.540
This is a Chicken Parmesan recipe.

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:46.320
So here's what we do.

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.480
Get a glass pan.

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:54.680
Get your olive oil
spray for stickiness.

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:56.170
Fellas, no more excuses.

00:00:56.170 --> 00:00:59.510
You don't have to be eating bars and
ordering out the rest of your life.

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:01.300
Now, chicken breast-- easy.

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:02.540
Go anywhere.

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:03.351
Thaw it out.

00:01:03.351 --> 00:01:04.050
Boom.

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:04.769
In pan.

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:05.160
Wow.

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:06.820
We got through those
first two steps.

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:08.090
I'm exhausted.
I know.

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:09.565
A lot of bachelors at
home are freaking out.

00:01:09.565 --> 00:01:10.414
I'm sweating.

00:01:10.414 --> 00:01:11.113
But we're--

00:01:11.113 --> 00:01:12.230
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:17.410
Next, we're going to take our
BPA-free can of tomato sauce,

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:21.350
and now we're going to add a quarter
teaspoon of oregano and garlic.

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:22.236
Na-na-na-na-na.

00:01:22.236 --> 00:01:23.122
Na-na-na-na-na.

00:01:23.122 --> 00:01:23.821
[LAUGHTER]

00:01:23.821 --> 00:01:24.710
Na-na-na na-na-na-na.

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:26.940
Sha-da-da-da-da
da-da-da da-da-da-da.

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:28.930
Chi-chi-cha chi-chi-cha
chi-chi-na na-na.

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:31.550
Pour that right over the chicken.

00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:33.860
Right, we're going to
use cheese as a spice.

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:35.370
So we got a little mozzarella there.

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:36.953
Quarter cup right
there and we're just

00:01:36.953 --> 00:01:39.474
going to add a little
Parmesan on top of that.

00:01:39.474 --> 00:01:40.968
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na.

00:01:40.968 --> 00:01:42.761
Right over that.

00:01:42.761 --> 00:01:43.460
All right.

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:44.246
So there it is.

00:01:44.246 --> 00:01:47.120
Looks like two chefs actually hung
out and knew what they were doing.

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:50.020
So here we go, we're going
to pop it in to the oven.

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:52.600
Now it's preheated at 400 degrees.

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.760
Right there.

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:56.275
In you go.

00:01:56.275 --> 00:01:59.136
Because that little baby's going
to be in there 15 , 20 minutes.

00:01:59.136 --> 00:02:00.760
Now one little tip
too, boys and girls.

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:02.710
Not everybody's oven's the same.

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:05.820
So for some of you, 15, some 25.

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:08.631
Just make sure that the center
of the chicken is not pink.

00:02:08.631 --> 00:02:09.330
That's it.

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.000
It's got to be cooked all the
way through that pink chicken.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.695
It's not sushi, all
right, so not good.

00:02:13.695 --> 00:02:16.570
Tell us a little bit more about your
journey, and how you've started,

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:18.180
and the transformation
and all of it.

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.860
During the time that I had children,
I just give up and just let it go.

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:24.840
I was working, taking them to
school, doing things with them.

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:31.180
And we ate lots of pizza and burgers
and over time, I-- it showed up.

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:33.180
Chicken Parmesan, traditional
Chicken Parmesan--

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.812
like 1,000 calories,
500 grams of fat.

00:02:35.812 --> 00:02:38.520
Freaking nasty, super yummy, but
part of the problem-- what we're

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:42.690
trying to do here is to make
healthy food taste good.

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:43.741
We do it here.

00:02:43.741 --> 00:02:44.440
Hello.

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:45.282
[DING]

00:02:45.282 --> 00:02:46.970
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:49.190
So here is our blanched spinach.

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:49.950
Boiling water.

00:02:49.950 --> 00:02:51.670
Boil it, bubbles.

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:52.550
Stick it in.

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:53.770
One minute, pull it out.

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:54.570
Bang.

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:55.324
Ta-da.

00:02:55.324 --> 00:02:56.023
Just like that.

00:02:56.023 --> 00:02:58.629
So I'm going to go in there
right now and get that baby.

00:02:58.629 --> 00:02:59.328
Here we go.

00:02:59.328 --> 00:03:00.027
Oh boy.

00:03:00.027 --> 00:03:01.132
Wow.

00:03:01.132 --> 00:03:01.861
Oh.

00:03:01.861 --> 00:03:02.560
[SIZZLING]

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:04.464
I can do it.

00:03:04.464 --> 00:03:05.842
Right on top of that.

00:03:05.842 --> 00:03:06.800
You want to first dibs?

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:07.620
I sure do.

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:08.319
You--

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:09.620
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:10.620
How come I do that?

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:11.620
Why do I do that?

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:13.093
All right.

00:03:13.093 --> 00:03:14.500
Drum roll please.

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:21.760
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:22.728
Mm.

00:03:22.728 --> 00:03:23.696
Oh my god.

00:03:23.696 --> 00:03:24.664
Mm.

00:03:24.664 --> 00:03:25.632
It's awesome.

00:03:25.632 --> 00:03:27.084
Isn't that easy?

00:03:27.084 --> 00:03:28.060
Mhm.

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:32.470
So boys and girls, a lot of times
we use food as an excuse, right?

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:33.790
Nuh-uh.

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:35.640
They work together.

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:37.040
Exercise is fitness.

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:37.940
Food is health.

00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:40.405
Put them together with P90.

00:03:40.405 --> 00:03:41.521
It's your turn.

00:03:41.521 --> 00:03:42.220
Thanks Kam.

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:42.920
Thank you.

00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:44.030
Congratulations.
Thank you so much.

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:44.779
Continued success.

00:03:44.779 --> 00:03:45.890
Thank you so much Tom.

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:46.790
I'm having some more.

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:47.489
