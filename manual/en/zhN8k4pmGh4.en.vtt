00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:11.320
The viewing panel you can clean with a regular
aquarium algae sponge.

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:16.139
Don't use a sponge from your sink or from
CVS or something, because a lot of them have

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.869
anti-microbial agents, and that'll harm your
aquarium.

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:20.690
So use a regular aquarium sponge.

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:25.060
Find out if you have a glass or acrylic tank
and use the appropriate sponge for that.

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:26.910
So that takes care of the glass.

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.380
If you need to, use it to clean the overflow
pipes or the sides of the aquarium, or clean

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:32.380
some of the decorations.

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:35.500
You also want to control algae from growing
in the first place.

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.790
Algae thrives on sunlight and nutrients.

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:41.420
And when I say "sunlight," I mean aquarium
light, sunlight, any kind of lighting will

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:42.670
promote algae.

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:46.929
But if your nutrient levels are low -- your
nitrates and phosphates, mainly -- algae's

00:00:46.929 --> 00:00:48.409
not going to grow that well.

00:00:48.409 --> 00:00:53.110
So the main thing to controlling algae, which
will result in how you clean it, is to keep

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:55.739
your nutrient levels in check.

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.460
But algae's going to grow inevitably.

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:01.270
To clean it, you want to use the pad that
I told you on the front of the glass.

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:05.360
On the decorations, you can take them out,
soak them in hot water.

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.890
You can use light bleach, but you want to
be very, very careful, because bleach is caustic.

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:12.380
It'll discolor things if you use too much
of it.

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:16.300
And when you put the items back in the aquarium,
if there's any bleach residue, it'll shock

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:17.300
the system.

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.010
It'll kill bacteria, and you'll have an ammonia
and nitrite spike.

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:22.800
But bleach is a great tool to cleaning plants.

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:25.340
Only use it if you know what you are doing
and are very, very careful.

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:29.680
I don't want to hear people taking my advice,
going and bleaching their aquarium decorations

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:31.120
and parts, and losing their fish.

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:32.970
That would make me feel really bad.

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.960
So you want to clean using hot water mainly.

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:37.150
Use a good scrub brush.

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:40.390
Not a wire brush, because a wire brush is
going to just ruin and shred most aquarium

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:41.390
decorations.

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:47.741
And the glass itself will be kept clean just
by doing periodic weekly cleanings with the

00:01:47.741 --> 00:01:48.930
pads.

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.530
Fish will also help to clean algae.

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:55.050
Plecos, Otocinclus, algae eaters in freshwater
aquariums.

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:59.410
Also, snails will help to clean the glass
and decorations in an aquarium.

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:01.110
You don't want to use too many of them.

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:06.630
Snails, if allowed to just multiply, will
quickly completely overcrowd an aquarium to

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.170
plague proportions.

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:11.709
So just go with a couple of snails in the
aquarium and keep them in check.

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:14.420
And the fish, just a couple of small fish.

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:15.420
Plecos, algae eaters.

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:19.660
But remember that Plecos get really big, so
if you have a small tank, maybe go with Otocinclus

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:20.660
or algae eaters.

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:25.020
And if the water chemistry is kept in check,
the phosphates and nitrates are kept low,

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:29.590
the amount of algae that grows should be able
to be kept in check with regular weekly front

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:32.170
glass cleanings and the help of your algae-eating
fish.
