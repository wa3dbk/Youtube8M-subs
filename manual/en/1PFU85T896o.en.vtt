00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.620
Tadah, now this is the kitchen

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.800
Um Taehee!
Hi everyone

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:06.000
What are you doing here right now?

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.280
Because I am on a diet currently, I am trying to boil some eggs right now
woah, really?

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:13.500
Do we need to boil the water?

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.740
Yes, you must and the timer starts after the water is boiled 

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
You must wait patiently until the water is done boiling

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.400
We are waiting for the water to boil right now

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.740
The water isn't done boiling yet

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.760
Now while the water is boiling, we shall have some short dance time in the kitchen by Taehee

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Would you guys be okay about this?

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Ready go!

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:37.860
The person living on the bottom floor might come up because we're being too loud

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:46.680
Oh yeah that's right. We live on the highest floor of our apartment So we have to walk like this

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.360
Um what are you eating right now?

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Weren't you boiling eggs because you're on a diet?

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.460
It's a secret!

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.960
she ate chips!

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:05.880
This is all Taehee's

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.600
Those are not mine, this cereal is mine

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.440
She is in confusion and panic

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.440
What you guys have just seen should be erased from your minds

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:23.580
We must cover the brand name!

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:29.920
Where in the world did this come out of?

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.000
I shall eat all the chips after I succeed in my diet

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.920
I like that mind of thinking 
I shall throw these away now

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.400
Uh is the water almost done boiling now?

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:47.860
I have prepared five eggs

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.840
You must insert theses eggs into the boiling water

00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:57.080
I shall tell you all the magic time now

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.660
The magic time is.. Tadah it is 8 minutes!

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.620
Now let's start the timer with 8 minutes

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.240
And let's insert the eggs carefully one by one

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.400
Oh right I really love eggs

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.840
I like steam egg, rolled omelet, fried egg, boiled egg and yellow egg

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.740
Oh so that is why your nick name is 'egg Kim'

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.520
And also I carry eggs around within my body

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.940
It is there for you to eat whenever you're hungry

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.380
You have been hiding it
I always carry it around with me

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.480
Wow males would love it how you're in the kitchen with an apron on

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:47.780
Look at you acting all courteous

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
Now please cut the apple for us

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.000
Now I shall give my members the apples I have done cutting

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:58.740
Yay it's an apple

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:01.000
Thank you very much

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
She cuts apples for us every morning

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.660
Finally the timer is ringing

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.000
Yes the eggs!

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.000
Now the timer has rung. I will turn the fire off. It's important to turn the fire off as soon as the timer rings

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:24.780
You must also remember to put the eggs in cold water so that it is easier when you try to peel the egg skin later

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:41.000
Tadah!

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:44.400
I put eggs in cold water

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:51.100
Finally I have finished boiling all the eggs for A.KOR!
