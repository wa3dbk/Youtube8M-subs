00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.040
People go to museums for a number of reasons,

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:08.219
but whether it's a museum or it's a great
book,

00:00:08.219 --> 00:00:11.620
whether it's a television documentary, it
seems to me

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:15.929
you're telling stories.  Traditionally, the site has seen its mission as

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:16.599
telling the story

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:19.880
and it's needed after before they solves

00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:23.259
which corner from the park service as
well

00:00:23.259 --> 00:00:27.759
remarkable things in there and I want
emphasize those things will

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:31.219
will be on display again but what was
missing was

00:00:31.219 --> 00:00:34.809
in effect historical context how those
artifacts fit into

00:00:34.809 --> 00:00:38.160
a larger story both for the
assassination but then

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.850
to take up several steps back and say
what about the story before

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:47.679
your saturation to came to watch that
it's four years that are actually

00:00:47.679 --> 00:00:48.620
bracketed

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:52.190
by threats upon weakens like no
president ever confronted

00:00:52.190 --> 00:00:57.559
for challenges on arriving no president
have arrived in such means for

00:00:57.559 --> 00:01:01.519
when you walk into the museum will
actually entering through

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:05.150
are we creating real I it would affect

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:09.150
we came to washington and avoid would-be
assassins involved

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:14.240
that's how the story begins and great
stories are told

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.990
on multiple levels so you want to engage
people emotionally

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:22.340
as well as intellectually in my
experience it's very difficult

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.380
to make a document come to life I think
we found a way to do that

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:29.560
in what we call the bubble which again
puts you

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.830
inside the weekend presidency allows you
work over the president shoulder

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:37.240
at the documents that are literally
crossing his desk

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:41.040
it's that idea

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:46.910
that notion that weekend put your next
Abraham Lincoln that weekend

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:50.360
you ask you as you when you go to the
theater to suspend disbelief

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:54.470
for half hour an hour I and then move
over

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:58.240
this great American Life and this great
American tragedy

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:03.550
as they unfold together the rest to the
museum illustrates

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:07.380
but growth on Lincoln the man partition

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:11.940
the orator the public educator

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.269
and that of course we

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:19.700
we get in the last days of his life you
walk inside missus around morning how

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:20.430
should you meet

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.819
the conspirators and you see

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:28.810
gone with which movie transform American
history

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:33.219
in ways that Stover reverberate and then
you go up into the theater

00:02:33.219 --> 00:02:36.689
in the new

00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:41.950
towards their you will have come face to
face with the link can and you will have

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:42.909
lived all over

00:02:42.909 --> 00:02:46.459
the most important news and Lincoln's
life before you come to the end that

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:46.889
life

00:02:46.889 --> 00:02:50.310
which I don't think has a place in DC we

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:54.499
come today and immerse yourself in the
four years

00:02:54.499 --> 00:02:56.109
before April 14
