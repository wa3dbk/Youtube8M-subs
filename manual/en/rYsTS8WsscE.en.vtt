00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:08.500
the practice of kosher slaughter or shehcita
has been passed down in the jewish world

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:10.799
for hundreds of generations

00:00:10.799 --> 00:00:14.209
shechita requires that you
completely severe the trachea and

00:00:14.209 --> 00:00:18.380
esophagus of an animal which cause it to
bleed out and die quickly

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:21.949
for this you need specialized knife that's
 extremely sharp and free of any

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:23.849
nicks or roughness

00:00:23.849 --> 00:00:26.749
when i was twenty seven I shechted
first chicken

00:00:26.749 --> 00:00:29.069
i felt nothing

00:00:29.069 --> 00:00:31.270
i grew up in a kibbutz in northern
israel

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:35.079
and lived there until I was eight years old it was a
communal farming and manufacturing 

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:36.150
kibbutz

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:37.610
they had everything there

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:40.379
a board game factory a sock factory

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:43.329
we grew cotton corn watermelon

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:45.470
anything you can imagine we grew it

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:48.340
but my favorite were the milking cattle and meat
chickens

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:50.990
I've always been obsessed with different 
animals

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:55.130
blue whales snakes white tigers
squirrels

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:59.340
the only thing i loved as much as learning about animals was eating them

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:02.240
I didn't even eat a vegetable until i was
fourteen

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:04.830
but as i went through high school i
started to learn about the horrors of

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.610
factory farming

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:10.210
after becoming a vegetarian for several
years I learned that the egg and dairy

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:14.180
industry inflicted just as much if not
more suffering and animals as the meat business

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:19.210
i realized that in order to be ethical i
would have to become a vegan

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:23.350
but i wasn't ready for a step like that and my
carnal side won out

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:26.630
at twenty four i decided that i would
only eat the products of what i deem to

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:29.000
be ethically raised animals

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.460
knowing where everything i eat comes from

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:36.410
I also decided not to eat meat until I had
killed it myself

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:40.210
for the first time in twenty years i'm
living near farm again. At the jewish farm

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:42.390
co-op across the street from my house

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.159
we raise chickens goats and bees

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:47.220
for eggs and milk and honey

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:49.869
many of animals have been around for over two
years

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:53.610
it's more for me than simply giving
grain and alfalfa to the goats and

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.680
collecting the chickens eggs. I've spent
the past two years building a

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:58.710
relationship with our animals

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.880
I have grown to love each and every one of
them

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:05.930
after starting the farm co-op I truly
knew where my milk and eggs came from

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:07.690
but I still hadn't eaten meat in years

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:09.899
so i decided to learn shechita

00:02:09.899 --> 00:02:13.579
when i started shechting it surprised me
to realize that during slaughter i wasn't

00:02:13.579 --> 00:02:16.599
actually thinking much about the
individual animal

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:20.949
instead i was making sure to hold the chicken
correctly, to preform the kosher cut swiftly

00:02:20.949 --> 00:02:22.639
and decisively

00:02:22.639 --> 00:02:24.950
what started as my heart's pursuit

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:28.619
to engage in authentic relationship with
the animals i was eating

00:02:28.619 --> 00:02:33.199
was actually just the cold and exacting
science of kosher slaughter. i wanted it to be

00:02:33.199 --> 00:02:35.749
this lofty thing but it wasn't

00:02:35.749 --> 00:02:37.719
i was simply killing animals

00:02:37.719 --> 00:02:41.949
even now when i try hard to open my
heart to the animals I'm eating

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:43.759
there isn't much connection there

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:44.839
flip my wrist

00:02:44.839 --> 00:02:47.549
put the bird in the cone and it's gone in
seconds

00:02:47.549 --> 00:02:49.779
i'm alive and it's dead

00:02:49.779 --> 00:02:52.279
but at the end the day I feel the
death

00:02:52.279 --> 00:02:55.579
it's in my bones and coursing through my
veins

00:02:55.579 --> 00:02:59.510
after a day of shecting I often have dreams about that animals, the slaughter

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:01.379
the blood and knives

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:03.819
and feelings of guilt and sadness come
up

00:03:03.819 --> 00:03:06.239
i feel what i did

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:09.689
practicing shechita has changed how i
relate to death

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:13.559
I used to feel so much fear and
discomfort around the idea of dying

00:03:13.559 --> 00:03:16.409
fear of witnessing and experiencing it myself

00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:20.419
shechting has brought me face-to-face
with death

00:03:20.419 --> 00:03:23.760
i spent the year before i started
shechting taking care my mom when she was

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.209
dying of cancer

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:29.409
well it was one of the most painful and
heartbreaking experiences of my life

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:33.579
it was the same time one of the most
beautiful and intimate as well

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:35.070
in much the same way

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:39.730
killing animals is painful and sad but
 at the same time intimate and filled with love

00:03:40.909 --> 00:03:44.639
i now realize that much of my fear of
death was because all i could see was

00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:45.749
the darkness

00:03:45.749 --> 00:03:47.369
fear and pain

00:03:47.369 --> 00:03:51.719
but the experiences of losing my mom and
now of shechting have helped me see that while 

00:03:51.719 --> 00:03:53.379
death holds darkness

00:03:53.379 --> 00:03:54.849
pain and sadness

00:03:54.849 --> 00:03:59.179
it also holds intimacy and beauty and light

00:03:59.179 --> 00:04:01.650
when i was twenty eight I shechted a
chicken

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:01.900
i felt everything
