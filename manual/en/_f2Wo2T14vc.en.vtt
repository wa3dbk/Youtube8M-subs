00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.280
The East Arm is the least busy of the two
Brighton breakwaters, due to the long walk.

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:07.020
On busy and sunny weekends, you'll still be
fishing shoulder to shoulder down here but

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:12.449
outside of the peak times, this one fills
up less quickly than the West Arm.

00:00:12.449 --> 00:00:17.110
The deal on both arms is, just start fishing
and the wardens will come round to collect

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:18.130
your money.

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:22.370
Before you make your journey, check on the
Tackle Box website if the walls are open as

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:23.360
they do shut in high winds.

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:35.739
The lower walkway is anglers only - no ramblers
or dog walkers so great that the area is dedicated

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:39.760
to fishing and that you're casting out to
the open sea.

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.840
The first bend is always popular...bay numbers
in the 20s.

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:49.059
All the bays are numbered incidentally and
the rocks start from about bay 50, so do look

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:50.060
out for those.

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:55.960
There's room at the end for one or two anglers
when you get past the rocks.

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:08.090
Species-wise, you'll stand more chance of
catching variety here than most other places

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:10.200
in Sussex fishing from the shore.

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.120
And don't neglect the start of the arm, nearest
the beach.

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:15.160
Some nice bass have come from this very spot.

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:24.830
We mentioned the long walk earlier...you have
the choice of walking along the road, or if

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:29.590
you stopped off first at the Tackle Box next
to West Quay, it's quicker and more scenic

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:31.560
to use the boardwalk along the marina.

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:47.110
The West Arm known by some as the tourist
arm, fills up first, due to there being three

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:49.010
parking options within reach.

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:52.889
You can park for a while in Asda but best
bet is the multi-storey.

00:01:52.889 --> 00:01:57.099
Although notices state a 4 hour limit to the
free parking in the multi-storey, regulars

00:01:57.099 --> 00:02:01.790
say it's not enforced for users of the marina
facilities, such as fishing.

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:06.000
If using the multi-storey, park up on the
ground floor, go down the tunnel next to the

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:06.690
car wash.

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:10.720
And when you come up, don't go straight on
towards the beach as the cyclist is doing,

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:14.160
instead turn sharp left and walk up to the
breakwater.

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.649
The West Arm is the same configuration as
the East arm, an upper deck for moochers,

00:02:22.649 --> 00:02:24.560
and a lower deck for anglers.

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:35.119
Fishing is only to the outside sea and not
the inner harbour.

00:02:35.119 --> 00:02:40.860
What we do have here is float fishing only
bays at the end.

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:43.860
Thru there is an extension that's only open
at busiest times.

00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:00.560
There's buttresses all along both the West
and East arms, so fish are generally landed

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:01.660
at the bays.

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:13.990
The orange wire fasteners are also used to
rest the rods on.

00:03:27.869 --> 00:03:30.660
Fishing on the West Arm produces a wide variety
of species.

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:34.670
Again, check the Tackle Box website for what
exactly is being caught at the moment.
