Hi, I'm Reg Wilkins and today we're going
to be talking about training to become a photographer.

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:17.789
Becoming a professional photographer requires
a good eye, a creative mind, and a solid knowledge

00:00:17.789 --> 00:00:25.680
of the technology used in the field of photography.
For example, and understanding of light, and

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:31.320
composition. And being able to develop your
own film and do your own printing is enormously

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:40.530
helpful. In the growing field of digital photography,
it's also helpful to be computer savvy, and

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:48.660
have a good grasp of digital technology. To
become a professional photographer, it does

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:59.149
not necessarily require that you obtain a
special certificate or degree, but it is preferred.

00:00:59.149 --> 00:01:08.420
You can earn a degree in fine arts or photojournalism,
and so on. There are many photography schools

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:17.920
and classes that offer training. It is highly
recommended that you have some classroom experience,

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:26.510
and beyond that, that you work as an apprentice
or assistant to a professional photographer.

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:35.409
It is a much more competitive field out there
today. At photography schools you learn the

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:43.250
principles of photography, including theory,
composition and production. It's important

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:50.830
that you get along with people, and are able
to solve problems on the spot. The bottom

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:59.950
line is, having or developing a passion for
the craft that will drive you to be successful.
