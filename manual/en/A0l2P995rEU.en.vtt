00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:03.950
The Rename Objects tool helps you rename many objects at once.

00:00:04.158 --> 00:00:09.905
This tool can be handy, especially when you have objects 
with generic names that you initially forgot to name appropriately.

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:13.200
It is also particularly useful with mirrored objects. 

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:18.940
The right leg on this skeleton is composed of four limbs all named 
appropriately with the "Right" prefix.

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:25.620
This follows the Autodesk MotionBuilder naming convention; RightUpLeg, 
RightLeg, RightFoot and RightToeBase.

00:00:25.878 --> 00:00:29.373
When the entire leg is mirrored to the left side of the character,

00:00:30.818 --> 00:00:40.931
the left limbs are automatically named RightUpLeg01, RightLeg01, 
RightFoot01 and RightToeBase01.

00:00:41.771 --> 00:00:49.433
The new left leg limb names do not make much sense, adding the fact 
that they do not follow the MotionBuilder naming convention for proper 
interoperability.

00:00:49.871 --> 00:00:55.076
With the left leg selected, you can easily batch rename these limbs 
using the Rename Objects tool.

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:04.293
The default Base Name option is handy when you want to replace 
the entire object name. That is not the case here.

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:14.540
You need to edit the object's name specifically by changing the "Right" 
prefix and removing the numbered suffix.

00:01:14.875 --> 00:01:20.583
First, you need to get rid of the "Right" prefix, that's five letters 
to remove as the first five digits.

00:01:21.768 --> 00:01:25.055
Replace this prefix with another one called "Left".

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:35.948
Finally, remove the last two-digit numerical sequence that the mirror 
tool automatically added.

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:43.246
Click Rename. Notice how the limbs of the left leg 
have been renamed properly.

00:01:46.696 --> 00:01:50.611
This is a powerful tool to use when you need to rename 
a large number of objects.

00:01:53.073 --> 00:01:57.661
The leg only had four limbs. The right arm has 19.

00:01:59.618 --> 00:02:05.866
As you mirror the right arm and check the parts' names, 
you find yourself in the same situation as before.

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:20.820
With the Rename Objects tool dialog still open, 
and with the parameters still specified, 

00:02:20.971 --> 00:02:24.756
you can now click the Rename button to rename the left arm parts.

00:02:32.394 --> 00:02:38.056
Of course, the Rename Objects tool is not restricted to bone rigs 
or character setups. It can be used in any situation.

00:02:38.824 --> 00:02:42.459
Use the Quad menu to unhide the rest of the geometry in the scene.

00:02:48.079 --> 00:02:49.982
Take a look at these two couches. 

00:02:50.372 --> 00:02:55.522
One was modeled based on a box object and the other, by its very nature, 
started off as a cylinder.

00:02:57.374 --> 00:03:01.322
If you forget to rename these objects properly 
and start making duplicates, 

00:03:01.714 --> 00:03:05.212
you end up with a large number of objects labeled very generically.

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:22.950
These objects, which started off as different primitives, 
are all essentially couches.

00:03:23.157 --> 00:03:27.990
As you select them, you can choose a new base name such as Couch, 

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:32.480
since you do not want to retain any part of the old names.

00:03:35.852 --> 00:03:40.232
You also need to sequentially number them;
otherwise they will all have the same name.

00:03:40.607 --> 00:03:44.802
Set the base number to start with 1, and then click Rename.

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:48.800
All objects have now the same Couch base name.
