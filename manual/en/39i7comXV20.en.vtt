00:00:04.089 --> 00:00:06.149
How to Find Cheap (or Free!)

00:00:06.149 --> 00:00:07.940
Places to Crash on Vacation.

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:11.570
Why waste your vacation dollars on pricey
hotel rooms when there are cheaper – and

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:12.930
sometimes free – alternatives?

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:20.220
You will need Friends Friends of friends Hostels
Convents and monasteries Universities that

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:28.369
rent dorm rooms A sleeping bag Overnight bus
and train rides A pod hotel Free lodging websites

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:29.990
and a home to swap.

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:31.020
Step 1.

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:35.260
If you don't know anyone in the area you plan
to visit, send a mass email to friends and

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:39.850
loved ones asking if they do, and if that
person would let you crash on their couch.

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:43.000
Or spread the word yourself using social-networking
sites like Facebook.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.710
Take advantage of websites devoted to connecting
travelers with people willing to put them

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:52.350
up for free, like "couchsurfing.com":http://couchsurfing.com
or "globalfreeloaders.com":http://globalfreeloaders.com.

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.550
Just remember, if you take this route, exercise
caution.

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:56.810
Step 2.

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:01.559
If you'd rather not stay with a stranger,
or have one in your home, arrange an apartment

00:01:01.559 --> 00:01:04.690
or house swap so they're in your place while
you crash at theirs.

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:10.700
Of course, this is easier if you live in or
near a popular travel destination.

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:11.700
Step 3.

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.299
Book rooms in hostels.

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:17.219
Contrary to popular belief, most accept visitors
of all ages.

00:01:17.219 --> 00:01:18.310
Step 4.

00:01:18.310 --> 00:01:22.841
If you're visiting Europe, check with tourism
boards about inexpensive rooms to rent in

00:01:22.841 --> 00:01:23.869
convents and monasteries.

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:28.899
Italy boasts the most church-related accommodations.

00:01:28.899 --> 00:01:30.439
Step 5.

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:34.919
Check with local universities; many rent their
dorm rooms to travelers during the summer,

00:01:34.919 --> 00:01:38.450
no age limit involved.

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:39.669
Step 6.

00:01:39.669 --> 00:01:45.189
Plan your itinerary around overnight bus and
train trips to save the price of a hotel room.

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:46.189
Step 7.

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:47.779
Be a pod person.

00:01:47.779 --> 00:01:52.969
Many major cities now have so-called pod hotels
-- places that rent a teeny room for a tiny

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:53.969
price.

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:59.090
Did you know According to one survey, a complimentary
breakfast is the most important amenity to

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:02.920
travelers when picking a hotel, followed by
a swimming pool.
