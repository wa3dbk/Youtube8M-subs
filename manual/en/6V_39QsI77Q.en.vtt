Hi, this is Yolanda Vanveen, from vanveenbulbs.com,
and next, we're going to learn all about False

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:13.309
Spiraea, or Astilbe. It's a beautiful shade
plant, that does really well, almost anywhere

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:20.420
in the world, so this bed is full of funow.
It's a beautiful, dark reddish pink flower.

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:24.800
They've faded out now, so you can't see how
beautiful they really were, but they were

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:29.800
just this beautiful magenta color, and really
pretty foliage. They like the shade, so I'm

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.829
just planting them here, so that they can
divide, and I can dig them up and separate

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:40.940
them, and sell the plants, and they really
grow, so as they multiply, it's just a massive

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:45.920
set of roots, and they're so easy to grow,
because all you need, is basically a root,

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:51.059
to get them to grow, so this big clump, I
can separate probably into ten little clumps,

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.530
and they'll multiply very quickly, and then
I just sell the clumps, and people put them

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:59.161
in their yard, and they do really well, so
a lot of times when I separate them out too,

00:00:59.161 --> 00:01:03.539
I'll cut down the greens, so I have the plant,
or just the roots to sell, and then they'll

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:07.719
grow new roots too, almost year round, so
you can divide them out, and divide them out

00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:10.990
into little pieces, and they'll grow. It's
wonderful. It's a wonderful plant to share

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:15.600
with your friends, and they like shade. They
don't want to be in full hot sun, because

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:19.560
if it's too sunny, then the leaves will start
burning, and they won't do well. I found that

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:24.969
from experience, so I love this hot afternoon
shade, not the hot afternoon sun, and they'll

00:01:24.969 --> 00:01:31.770
do really well, and they also like a lot of
water, so False Spiraea, or Astilbe, they

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:35.659
really need a lot of moisture, because if
they get too dry, and these roots dry out

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:39.881
to nothing, you will lose them. They've got
to stay moist. These roots will not do well

00:01:39.881 --> 00:01:44.799
if they dry out, and you can cut them back
too, almost year round, and they'll grow new

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:49.509
growth, so even if I leave, and I'm not watering
very well, and they kind of break down, or

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:53.969
if I move them into a sunny spot, that's a
little more sun, and they get damaged. I just

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:58.229
cut the greenery off, and they grow new foliage,
so they're really a pretty plant. They're

00:01:58.229 --> 00:02:03.770
a native to America. They're from the Midwest,
and they grow really well in cold climates,

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:08.580
or warm climates, and they're a perfect shade
plant, because they don't need a lot of care,

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:13.860
so False Spiraea, or Astilbe, are one of my
favorite plants, and our big joke at the garden

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.810
shows, is Astilbe waiting for you.
