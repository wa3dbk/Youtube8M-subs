00:00:16.424 --> 00:00:20.484
Maciek... tell us, where you are;-)

00:00:20.484 --> 00:00:22.464
on the speedway in Koszalin.

00:00:22.464 --> 00:00:23.664
Have you gone so far to drive?

00:00:23.664 --> 00:00:24.344
Yeah!

00:00:24.344 --> 00:00:25.544
Are you crazy?

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:44.780
First, we wanted to visit a speedway with V6.

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:47.860
but at least we've got 4 cylinders

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:50.060
plus the electric engine...

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.260
I think it's little bit worse than V6...

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:58.500
We have to learn the curves and than get mad;-)

00:01:11.789 --> 00:01:14.129
I hope You would like it

00:01:14.238 --> 00:01:16.238
If you don't like it...

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:18.520
what a pity;-)

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:21.020
It's a Koszalin Speedway...

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:22.998
Lexus IS300H

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.580
First question

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:26.780
Is it possible to make Hybrid drifting?

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:31.380
Lexus seems to be higher quality made than Mercedes-Benz

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:36.580
Interior of Mercedes is much classic,

00:01:37.699 --> 00:01:39.699
Here is pure futurism...

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.820
We can move the speedometer mechanicly

00:01:45.035 --> 00:01:50.235
and we hear that sound... just listen;-)

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:57.400
For sure, it's mechanic move, it's the first car in which I've had seen such thing;-)

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:59.960
Car Audio by Mark Levinson!

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.660
In our test, it's got  8/10 points.

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.780
It's the best audio, we've listened to.

00:02:09.480 --> 00:02:13.100
It is Hi-End car audio kit. It sounds really, really super!

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.080
The biggest advantage of this car is Mark Levinson on board!

00:02:16.095 --> 00:02:18.335
Traction is off!

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.980
and we're trying to drift!

00:02:29.554 --> 00:02:31.554
Oh yeah

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:47.780
Grass!

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.060
because, I didn't turn back the steering wheel;-)

00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:57.740
As you see, you can drift, but it is really hard task.

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:02.500
The recipe is to use the technic from cars, which got low power,

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.140
just throwing a car;-)

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:10.200
and you will use the inertial force of your car,

00:03:10.544 --> 00:03:12.544
and you're drifting...

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:17.500
We just love driving;-)

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:21.580
So, drifting this car, as you see, it's hard, but possible,

00:03:22.287 --> 00:03:24.287
here is too less power,

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:32.300
and the electronic controls, that don't let us do much more!

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:46.340
and I admit, that is really comfortable driving, here on a speedway.

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:48.660
I cannot say same thing!!!

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:53.760
It's a kind of torture for me and for this car,

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:57.620
beacuse it's not a drifting car!

00:03:57.664 --> 00:04:00.064
It's not even RCF!

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:21.560
So, Lexus IS300H, certainly is not a car to drift,

00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:27.800
You can drive it really comfortable, especially in long trips, but also in the city streets.

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:31.400
We think, it's car for a woman.

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:36.520
Men in this car can find themselves a little bit lost.

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:38.940
This car isn't mannish.

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:40.260
It's like nice girl

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:41.922
very pretty,

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:44.180
really soft in touching,

00:04:44.450 --> 00:04:46.450
well driven,

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:52.820
pleasant, and sometimes even fast

00:04:55.900 --> 00:05:00.060
we've got no EDL at all

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:05.720
and it's a pitty, cause it could be very usefull here.

00:05:17.972 --> 00:05:19.972
and for the fisrt time;-)

00:05:19.980 --> 00:05:21.980
We did it!

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:23.522
We've turned aoriund!

00:05:24.195 --> 00:05:26.195
and nothing had happened.

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:30.180
Look, how it lost gears, Lexus didn't know what to do;-)

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:32.180
Yeah, but should it turn the rear gear?!

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:44.060
Oh, I've been lost for a minute in turning the steering wheel,

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:49.960
I think, I'm driving too confident.

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:57.520
I have to focus, what am I doing!

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:14.180
I did as I told, and now it works;-)

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:18.260
We think that grille is really big!

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:20.040
It's even huge!

00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:23.120
Grille looks like a big mouth, which wants to devour you;-)

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:31.260
This car looks pretty good, it's fierce, really...

00:06:31.260 --> 00:06:38.080
It's got mettle, If we talk about this car, we still thought about women;-)

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:41.160
So, we are missing something!

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:44.820
Maybe, finally it's not this;-)

00:06:44.820 --> 00:06:47.580
Lexus is really good in holding on the road,

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:50.880
It's beacuse of wider tyres in rear,

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:56.060
The wider wheel base also in rear,

00:06:57.140 --> 00:07:01.880
narrower in front, so it's like in a real sports car,

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:05.080
We've got here stiffer suspension in F-Sport version.

00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:09.260
Here is very sports position behind the steering wheel, we really feel like sitting in a sports car.

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:12.720
low, very sports sitting,

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:20.280
So woman will love the interior as much as exterior.

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:29.440
It's important for a woman to make the car looks good outside.

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:45.580
Thank for watching us! ;-)
