00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Hello Summoners, My name is Paul Bellezza and Iím an associate producer here at Riot Games.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
And I am happy to announce the next champion in League of Legends ñ WuKong, the Monkey King.

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:41.000
Monkey King is a melee DPS fighter who is super fun to play.

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.000
Letís start off by talking about his passive, Stone Skin. 

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:49.000
Stone Skin allows you to gain armor and magic resistance the more enemies are nearby you.

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.000
So itís really going to encourage you to fight.

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:52.900
Then, letís talk about his abilities.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.200
His Q is called Crushing Blow. 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:02.000
What Crushing Blow does is on your next hit, you are going to do extra damage and decrease the armor of the enemy champion you are fighting.

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.000
His second ability is Decoy. 

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:07.000
Monkey King leaves a copy of himself and goes invisible. 

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:11.000
This copy stays there and you are invisible for a little bit of time. So you can wonder off.
 
0:01:11.900,0:01:25.000
Then at the end of the short period of time, that copy of yourself spins around and does AOE damage, which is fantastic for setting up ganks, for sneaking and getting away - really leading into this mischievous type of play, that is emblematic of what the Monkey King character is about.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.000
His third ability is Nimbus Strike, which allows you to target an enemy champion and rush to their location and hit them really hard. 

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:34.000
However, it does more than that. 

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:41.000
If there are up to 2 enemy champions or minions nearby, you will make 2 copies of yourself that will hit those champions as well.

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:46.900
So long story short, you might be able to hit up to 3 people anytime with this strike. Itís fantastic.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.900
His ultimate ability is Cyclone. Monkey King starts spinning around in a whirling tornado of death, doing major damage.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.900
He continues to spin faster and faster, able to move around the map a lot quicker and damage any other enemies nearby. 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.900
Itís a great way to smack people around.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.900
WuKong is a very exciting champion to play.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.900
Heís very aggressive.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.900
You can jump into fights with him, as well as, get out of fights very easily.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.900
His abilities work very well together.

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.500
Summoners, thank you for tuning in and thank you for playing League of Legends.
