ALEX PACHIKOV: Hi.

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:09.880
I'm Alex Pachikov from Evernote,
and I'm the VP for

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:10.205
partnerships.

00:00:10.205 --> 00:00:11.090
HEMANT GARG: Hi.

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:11.810
I'm Hemant Garg.

00:00:11.810 --> 00:00:13.665
I'm Android tech lead
at Evernote.

00:00:13.665 --> 00:00:14.330
TY SMITH: Hi.

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:17.070
I'm Ty Smith, and I'm a senior
Android engineer at Evernote.

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:18.215
ALEX PACHIKOV: We launched
Evernote in

00:00:18.215 --> 00:00:19.560
the summer of 2008.

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.900
We basically figured that
nobody's quite happy with

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.070
their actual brains and they
really needed something to

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:25.900
help them remember everything
that they see.

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.470
So I wanted to build Evernote to
be a product, an app, and a

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:31.470
service that will help you
capture anything that's

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.350
important to you, anywhere
you are, and always

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:34.120
help you find it.

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:36.313
So whenever you wake up, the
first device you can reach

00:00:36.313 --> 00:00:38.430
with your hand, whether it's a
phone or a tablet, you should

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:39.730
be able to just get
to your important

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:41.630
information right away.

00:00:41.630 --> 00:00:43.960
We want you to use Evernote your
whole life, so we're not

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:45.870
in a rush to monetize
the application.

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.680
We want people to use it for
free for as long as they want.

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.830
And once you use it and once
you put a lot of stuff into

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:53.260
it, you will see some of the
power features that are our

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:54.730
premium features that
we charge for.

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:55.730
Let me give you an example.

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:58.800
Say you've been using Evernote
to store a bunch of documents.

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.010
One of the premium
features that we

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:01.470
have is document search.

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:04.802
Document search lets us index
all of the contents of all of

00:01:04.802 --> 00:01:06.850
the office documents you have
in Evernote and make them

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:07.380
searchable.

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:09.825
So when I go to search, I will
see a little pop up that says,

00:01:09.825 --> 00:01:11.730
did you know this is
a premium feature?

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:14.470
And I can buy it right there,
directly with an in-app

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:15.415
subscription.

00:01:15.415 --> 00:01:18.090
TY SMITH: Because Evernote is
a long-term product for our

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:20.570
users, we felt like the
subscription model made the

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:21.540
most sense.

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.940
And when the Billing APIs came
out for the different app

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:26.630
stores, we took advantage of
those as soon as we could.

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:30.590
At first we were only able to
take advantage of monthly

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:31.700
in-app billing.

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.860
Users would have to resubscribe
every month, and

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:37.930
this had a fairly high churn
rate we saw near 70%.

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:41.260
With the rise of subscription
models in the In-App Paying

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:44.810
APIs, we've seen that reduced
down to near 30% on Android,

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:45.940
which has been fantastic.

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:48.860
ALEX PACHIKOV: Today, Evernote
has about 50 million users.

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:52.110
About 70% of our users come from
mobile first, but most

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.930
people use Evernote on
multiple devices--

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:56.040
phones, tablets, PCs.

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.590
And we really see that Evernote
is most useful to

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:01.720
people when you use it across
different devices, because you

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:04.130
never know which device you're
going to have close to you.

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:06.770
When we saw the rise of tablets,
we really took it

00:02:06.770 --> 00:02:07.550
very seriously.

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:09.660
We knew that Evernote had a
huge opportunity to be an

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.680
important native
app on tablets.

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.840
And we built it early on as best
as we can, and we put as

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:17.470
much work into the UI of the
tablets as we did into the

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:19.200
phones and our PC versions.

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.900
And today we see ourselves as
one of the top productivity

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:25.620
apps on every tablet that there
is-- specifically on the

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.770
Nexus 7, which is our second
most popular device.

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:30.760
TY SMITH: We've seen a lot of
tablet growth recently.

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.210
So I wanted to walk you through
some of our best

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:35.120
practices that we've discovered
on tablet, and how

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:37.590
we gave the users a
great experience.

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.710
HEMANT GARG: We wanted to give
better user experience to our

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:43.060
tablet users, so we thought
tablet users have to be more

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:44.990
engaging and more power users.

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:47.690
So we gave them double panels,
and they can do more stuff at

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:48.620
the same time.

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:52.230
We gave them a quick and easy
way to access their notebooks,

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:53.200
their tags, places.

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:55.330
And at the same time, they can
see what's happening with

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:57.000
their account and
all their notes.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.010
TY SMITH: Our anticipation's
turned out to be correct.

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.060
The average session length for a
tablet user is almost double

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:04.590
that of the phone user.

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.510
We also anticipated that on
tablet with the larger screen

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:08.850
real estate that we'd
see a lot more

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:10.530
users creating content.

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:12.020
ALEX PACHIKOV: Android is
the fastest growing

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:13.010
platform for Evernote.

00:03:13.010 --> 00:03:14.580
So we're really excited about
what's coming up in the

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:16.520
future, and we're working
on lots of cool stuff.

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:17.290
Thank you for watching.

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:18.270
HEMANT GARG: Thank you.

00:03:18.270 --> 00:03:19.520
TY SMITH: Thank you.
