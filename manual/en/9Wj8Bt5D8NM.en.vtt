SHIR HEVER, ECONOMIST, ALTERNATIVE INFORMATION
CENTER: For over a year, a legal battle between

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:12.210
the IT giants Apple and Samsung has been widely
reported in business newspapers, but the significance

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:17.350
of these trials to the shape of the world's
economy has been mentioned only by a few.

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:22.250
The market for smart phones and tablet computers
has grown dramatically over recent years and

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:24.670
is now dominated by two companies.

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:29.370
Apple Inc. is the biggest corporation in the
field, followed by the South Korean headquartered

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:31.170
Samsung.

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:37.030
Apple sued Samsung first, claiming that Samsung
had copied Apple's design in its products.

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:40.970
Samsung retaliated with lawsuits of its own,
making similar claims.

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:44.420
The lawsuits were filed in courts in the U.S,
Britain, and Japan.

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:50.010
The struggle was compared by the participants
and by the business media to an actual battle.

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.660
The war metaphor is prevalent in newspaper
titles, but can be traced back to the late

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:00.640
Steve Jobs, former CEO of Apple, who threatened
to go "thermonuclear" against companies that

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:02.760
would copy Apple products.

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:09.560
Judge Lucy Koh said in a San Jose hearing
in August 2012 that it is "time for peace."

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.560
But this war is a mock war.

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.930
Neither Apple nor Samsung suffer any casualties.

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:19.140
The legal debates have very little effect
on the companies themselves.

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.270
The largest compensation that was awarded
in August 2012 by a U.S court against Samsung

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:26.600
was a sum of $1.1 billion.

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.280
A week later, Samsung won against a similar
lawsuit in Japan.

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:37.159
This March, Judge Koh reduced Samsung's compensation
due to Apple by about half a billion dollars,

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:42.689
which would amount to about 5 percent of Samsung's
net profit for 2011.

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:47.300
Both companies have tried to ban their competitor's
products in various countries.

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:52.689
Apple tried to ban Samsung products from the
U.S. Samsung tried to ban Apple products in

00:01:52.689 --> 00:01:53.689
Japan.

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:57.490
So far, the courts have refused to ban any
of the products.

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:01.340
But that is not to say that the court cases
amounted to nothing.

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:06.080
While building up the image as if Apple and
Samsung are slugging it out, the reality is

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.420
that the companies complement each other.

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:13.090
And the trials create dangerous precedents,
building layers upon layers of complexity

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:18.840
into patent law and effectively locking the
smaller companies out of the market.

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.750
Apple and Samsung are in fact doing business
with each other.

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:27.790
Apple, order to preserve its high profit margins,
chooses to employ only about 60,000 workers

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:29.470
worldwide.

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:34.520
In order to dominate the phone and tablet
markets, Apple sources its supply of components

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:40.900
through cheap producers--Apple-sourced components,
and especially flash drives, from Samsung.

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:45.569
The South Korean company is smaller than Apple,
although it employs over six times as many

00:02:45.569 --> 00:02:47.170
workers.

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:51.959
Apple now claims in court that Samsung learned
how to design and produce phones and tablets

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:54.540
by serving as a supplier for Apple.

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.959
But Apple doesn't need Samsung only for the
parts.

00:02:57.959 --> 00:03:03.519
In order to maintain its image as providing
a line of high-end products, it needs Samsung

00:03:03.519 --> 00:03:07.980
to provide cheaper products to compare its
own products against.

00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:12.270
Apple therefore dominates the market in developed
countries, and Samsung dominates the market

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:17.800
in developing countries, in which the average
household income is lower.

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:23.379
Samsung's EVP, Kim Hyun-suk, told The New
York Times in February that the company doesn't

00:03:23.379 --> 00:03:27.320
try to create markets, but is driven by markets.

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:31.300
Samsung therefore helps create the illusion
that the electronic gadgets are produced in

00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:33.410
a competitive market.

00:03:33.410 --> 00:03:37.349
Mainstream economics teaches that if a certain
product turns out to be profitable and in

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:42.190
high demand, small companies will try to gain
a foothold, will create competition and make

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:44.230
prices fall.

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:48.319
Samsung has built up the image of such an
"underdog" company, growing fast and taking

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:50.860
a bite out of Apple's hegemonic monopoly.

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:55.909
This image serves both companies, as it distracts
from the process in which both companies secure

00:03:55.909 --> 00:04:01.190
ownership of staggering amounts of patents,
while at the same time reinforcing their ability

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:03.420
to keep the market divided between them.

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:09.069
There are estimated to be a quarter million
different patents registered which are relevant

00:04:09.069 --> 00:04:11.360
to the production of smartphones.

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:16.200
Each patent can be grounds for the owning
company to sue any company or individual who

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:18.870
is producing a similar item.

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:23.699
Apple went so far as to include in its lawsuit
the claim that the rectangular shape with

00:04:23.699 --> 00:04:27.309
rounded corners is an Apple design feature.

00:04:27.309 --> 00:04:30.839
This claim, at least, was rejected by the
jury.

00:04:30.839 --> 00:04:35.900
Patent law is frequently understood as a mechanism
to safeguard the rewards for innovation.

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:40.449
But companies who employ batteries of lawyers
and spend hundreds of millions of dollars

00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:45.460
on patenting every possible aspect of their
products are not rewarding innovation but

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:46.590
doing the exact opposite.

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:49.710
They are putting up bulwarks against competition.

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:55.240
If a company would attempt to design a gadget
to compete with existing smartphones, it will

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:59.599
need to go over a quarter of a million patents
in order to make sure that it will not be

00:04:59.599 --> 00:05:02.149
sued for patent infringement.

00:05:02.149 --> 00:05:06.879
If it somehow overcomes this obstacle and
designs an entirely new product, it might

00:05:06.879 --> 00:05:12.539
not even be recognizable as a phone, and the
company will have to spend millions in advertisements

00:05:12.539 --> 00:05:15.979
to educate the public that their gadget can
indeed be useful.

00:05:15.979 --> 00:05:21.740
In the first week of March, a U.S. court has
rejected a demand by Samsung to open up a

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:25.099
new trial to ban Apple products in the U.K.

00:05:25.099 --> 00:05:30.009
Two days later, Judge Koh ruled that Apple
may continue to trial with further accusations

00:05:30.009 --> 00:05:32.649
it has against Samsung.

00:05:32.649 --> 00:05:38.439
Each additional trial, each additional ruling
serve as a warning message to potential competitors

00:05:38.439 --> 00:05:42.740
that they should be wary of entering into
this market unless they are prepared to pay

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:46.189
large amounts of money in legal battles.

00:05:46.189 --> 00:05:50.449
Although Samsung and Apple both spend many
millions of dollars in their lawsuits against

00:05:50.449 --> 00:05:54.499
each other, both companies remain extremely
profitable.

00:05:54.499 --> 00:05:59.229
The legal battles help them keep their control
over the smartphones and tablets market, and,

00:05:59.229 --> 00:06:04.320
in general, in shaping a world economy built
on a monopoly over patents and the threat

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:06.339
of lawsuits restricting innovation.

00:06:06.339 --> 00:06:10.529
This is Shir Hever for The Real News.
