Hi I'm Ryan Jenkinson and welcome to our short
video on hybrid drumming. So throughout the

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:31.570
course of this video we're hopefully going
to give you a bit of an idea about how to

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:35.430
make your existing acoustic drum kit into
a hybrid drum kit and hopefully answer a few

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:36.989
questions along the way.

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.600
[music]

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.769
The musical landscape has changed for us drummers,
because technology has pushed the boundaries

00:00:49.769 --> 00:00:53.550
of what's possible further and further. So
when it comes to taking your new record out

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.979
on the road, maybe the 4 or 5 drums you've
got infront of you aren't going to cut it. So why not

00:00:57.979 --> 00:01:02.350
add thousands more drums but without having
the hassle of having to set them up. With

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:07.850
a hybrid set up you can have thousands of
sounds. All here, you can have hand claps,

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:12.579
you can have clavets, handbells, you can even
have explosions and sounds effects. But they're

00:01:12.579 --> 00:01:15.140
all here ready, just at the hit of a stick.

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:24.750
[music]

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.990
So once you've got your hybrid set up, how
are we going to play the new electronic sounds?

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:33.590
Ok well there are many ways. The first of
all is by playing the onboard pads on either

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:38.500
the sample pad or the percussion pad. Just
by hitting these, whichever sounds you assign

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:44.520
to them will play out through your front house.
The second way is to add additional pads which

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.590
you can position around your kit. The first
one is kind of a mesh pad, so its already

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:54.110
a real kind of drum feel. And the second one
is a space saving bar pad. So again you can again

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:59.450
fit that into your existing set up and make
it comfy. Ok, the last way is to actually

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:04.350
trigger your acoustic drums, so you're not
going to be hitting anything extra. Everytime

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:09.099
you hit one of your acoustic drums like your
snare drum, it will also trigger a snare drum

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:14.360
sound or any other sound you want simultaneously
via your sample or percussion pad.

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.680
[music]

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:23.500
The reason I use a hybrid set up is because
we spent so long in the studio trawling over

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.159
getting the right kick drum and the right
snare drum sounds, that when it comes to taking

00:02:27.159 --> 00:02:32.010
it live, I'd kind of like to use those same
kick drum and snare drum sounds but blend

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:37.139
them with the sound of the acoustic kit. So
we get a really overdriven 909 big fat kick

00:02:37.139 --> 00:02:43.340
drum, blend it with the big fat kick drum
sound that comes out of a 22 by 20, and really

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:48.340
the drum sounds, every single night, bang
on, amazing. So I couldn't go back now.

00:02:48.529 --> 00:03:03.650
[music]

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:07.029
So when it comes to triggering your acoustic
drums, let me show you how easy it is. We've

00:03:07.029 --> 00:03:12.389
got the trigger on our snare drum, we've got
the trigger on our kick drum. So here's just

00:03:12.389 --> 00:03:24.049
the acoustic sounds. For the snare. So now
I'm going to turn the volume up on the sample

00:03:24.049 --> 00:03:33.809
pad so you'll also hear what I'm triggering.
Ok so this is the kick drum. So that's a sound

00:03:33.809 --> 00:03:38.529
you're not going to get out of an acoustic
drum, but simply by assigning that to the

00:03:38.529 --> 00:03:43.219
kick drum trigger, it will play every time
I hit it. Let's try that on the snare. Now

00:03:43.219 --> 00:03:47.599
I've gone slightly different with this and
I've set this trigger to trigger a crazy sort

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:58.989
of really messed up synthy sound hand clap.
Let's have a listen. It sounds crazy on its

00:03:58.989 --> 00:04:00.989
own, but in a beat...

00:04:00.989 --> 00:04:16.239
[music]

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:19.750
If you're looking to go hybrid, its not actually
as hard as you might think. Just take your

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:24.760
existing acoustic drum kit and then add an
electronic sound source. Now if you've got

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:29.800
an electronic kit, you could use your existing
module. If not, you could use a sample pad

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:34.580
or digital percussion pad and then you need
to find a way to trigger it. To trigger it

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:39.020
is just to play it. So you can play it by
using the onboard pads or by adding extra

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:45.650
things to hit around your kit like mesh pads
or bar pads or by using these guys on your

00:04:45.650 --> 00:04:47.350
acoustic drums to trigger the sound.

00:04:47.350 --> 00:05:05.350
