00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:01.310
What's up everybody?

00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:05.980
This is Andy with MyTechMethods, and this
is my video over how to jailbreak iOS 7 on

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:13.620
an iPhone, iPad, or iPod.

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:15.050
Ok the wait is finally over.

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:19.499
You can now jailbreak your iOS 7 device, and
it's just a few simple steps that you have

00:00:19.499 --> 00:00:22.199
to follow so I'm going to show you how to
do it right now.

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.439
The first step you want to do is just connect
your device (your iPhone, iPad, or iPod) up

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:31.420
to your computer, and when iTunes opens just
select "Back Up Now" right here.

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:33.480
And back up your device to your computer.

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.570
That's the first very first thing you want
to do before you do this because if anything

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:42.400
goes wrong you want to have a backup of your
device so you can restore your device if anything

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:43.800
goes wrong along the way.

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:44.940
So do that now.

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.350
Back up your device to iTunes.

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:47.640
It'll only take a few minutes.

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.920
Okay step number two: here's where you're
going to restore your iPhone, iPad, or iPod

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:56.030
to the latest iOS version that there is, and
currently right now when I'm doing this video

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:57.610
it's 7.0.4.

00:00:57.610 --> 00:01:02.770
And the reason we want to do this is because
if you updated your device over the air through

00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:07.600
your device, if you updated to the latest
version that way, it'll cause some problems

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:08.600
when you jailbreak.

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.960
So the first thing you want to do is restore
your device.

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:14.969
So while it's connected to iTunes just go
ahead and click this "Restore" button right

00:01:14.969 --> 00:01:16.219
here.

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:19.320
Okay it'll ask you to verify that this is
what you want to do.

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:23.360
As long as you just made that successful backup
then you can go ahead and click "Restore and

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:28.189
Update" and it'll restore to the latest version
of iOS so we can do the jailbreak.

00:01:28.189 --> 00:01:29.450
Click Next.

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:30.679
Click Agree.

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:33.950
The restore might take some time depending
on your internet speed, but if you have fairly

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:36.590
fast internet it'll take just a few minutes.

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:38.979
Now your iOS device will restore.

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:41.999
Okay so the restore is done, and now it's
going to ask me if I want to set it up as

00:01:41.999 --> 00:01:45.469
a new iPad or if I want to restore from a
backup so obviously we're going to restore

00:01:45.469 --> 00:01:48.030
from our most recent backup that we just did.

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.829
Then hit Continue.

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:53.759
Okay once the restore is done the next thing
you want to do is go on your device and disable

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.580
any passcode lock that you have on it if you
have one.

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:59.469
You can re-enable it once you're done with
the jailbreak.

00:01:59.469 --> 00:02:03.130
Okay once you disable your passcode lock next
thing you want to do is go on your computer

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:04.969
and go to the evasi0n website.

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:07.009
That's evasi0n.com with a zero.

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:09.500
The link will be in the video description
below.

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.810
Then once you're at the site you're going
to download the jailbreak app for whatever

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:13.900
operating system you're on.

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.080
I'm on a Mac so I'll click the Mac download
button.

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:20.290
Okay go ahead and click the download button
to download it to your computer.

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:24.790
Okay once it's finished downloading to your
computer you're going to open it up.

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:28.959
And then double click the application to run
it.

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:31.489
Okay now you'll see the evasion application
in the box.

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:37.280
It'll pop up, and it'll say welcome and make
sure that your iPad or iPhone or iPod whichever

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:39.380
you're jailbreaking is supported.

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.920
Just make sure it says that it's supported
right here on this window.

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.540
Alright now the next step is to jailbreak.

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.069
If you don't already have your device connected
to your computer go ahead and do that right

00:02:48.069 --> 00:02:49.069
now.

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:52.879
Let it sync to iTunes, and then once it's
connected go ahead and click the jailbreak

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:53.879
button.

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:57.930
The jailbreak process will begin, and it will
take a few minutes to complete this whole

00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:01.150
process, and I will be speeding it up for
the sake of this video.

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:04.650
During this whole jailbreak process your device
will reboot.

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:09.650
Okay now it says to continue please unlock
your device and tap the new evasion 7 icon.

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:13.200
Okay it'll come up and go right back down
and reboot again.

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:17.709
Okay the device will reboot one last time,
and evasi0n says that it's done.

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:21.280
So we're going to let the device reboot and
come back up now and we should be able to

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:22.860
go into Cydia.

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:27.159
Now after the final reboot you will see evasion
do some final tasks while the it completes

00:03:27.159 --> 00:03:28.409
the jailbreak.

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:34.120
Okay so now you can go into your device and
go to the last page and you should see Cydia

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:35.120
right there.

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.829
You can tap on it to open it up for the first
time.

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:39.489
It'll prepare the file system.

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:42.250
Okay once your device resprings it'll come
back up.

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:46.469
Go back into Cydia one last time then choose
User.

00:03:46.469 --> 00:03:52.090
Hit done, and if it asks you to do any upgrades
just go ahead and do the upgrades.

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:54.219
I'll hit complete upgrades.

00:03:54.219 --> 00:03:56.799
Hit confirm.

00:03:56.799 --> 00:04:00.019
Okay then hit close Cydia, and there you have
it.

00:04:00.019 --> 00:04:04.909
Your iOS 7 device is now jailbroken, and you
can go into Cydia and add all the tweaks and

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:06.150
apps that you want.

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:09.510
If you liked this video make sure you give
it a thumbs-up and subscribe to my channel.

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:14.849
I will be doing videos in the future about
some of my favorite tweaks and apps from Cydia.

00:04:14.849 --> 00:04:16.109
Thank you so much for watching.

00:04:16.109 --> 00:04:18.400
Keep having fun out there, and I'll talk to
you later.
