00:00:05.049 --> 00:00:11.059
Okay, you guys, this next one is called the
In-Twist and it is one of my favorites.

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:13.250
This is another one that you can take to the
club.

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:18.500
It doesn't matter if it's the book club, if
it's the club club; maybe you can do this

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:22.150
in your home, on the train, wherever you want,
okay?

00:00:22.150 --> 00:00:23.150
But it's fun.

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:24.150
It's really fun.

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.749
It's a great exercise for your waistline because
you're twisting, yes?

00:00:27.749 --> 00:00:33.120
Any type of twisting action is going to really
start to narrow down your waistline and work

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.510
your obliques, which are the muscles on the
side of your body, okay?

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:38.620
So you're going to bend your knees.

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:40.410
Your arms are right in front of you.

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:42.719
You're going to twist your right knee in.

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:47.809
In, pull your right arm back, and then come
back to center.

00:00:47.809 --> 00:00:49.719
That's the In-twist, okay?

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:53.100
So twist in and back.

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.160
You just alternate sides.

00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:01.940
In, back, in - so see this twisting action
of my shoulders against my knee?

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:07.060
That's the twist action that you want to get
so that you're working your waistline, okay?

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:12.510
So nice and slow again, bend your knee soft,
then core is engaged, arms right here, same

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.000
knee and arm.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.850
Right foot to start; right arm to start, okay?

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:18.510
Nice and slow.

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:22.900
In and down, in and down, in and down.

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:27.560
You want to lift the heel up with the knee
in.

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:32.470
In and down, in-twist, in, down, last one.

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:36.870
In, down, and in, down, okay?

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:41.170
So if you have it at that tempo, let's speed
it up, okay?

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:42.760
We're going to take it up.

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:43.760
Relax.

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:44.760
Have fun with it.

00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:46.030
Here we go.

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:49.430
We have been twistin', twistin', twistin',
twist, yeah?

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:53.810
So you can go really fast or you could take
a break.

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:55.560
One, two, hold.

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.300
One, two, hold.

00:01:57.300 --> 00:01:59.630
In-twist, in-twist, in hold.

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:01.380
One, two, hold.

00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:03.630
Okay, so you have options.

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.640
Keep going at that same speed.

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.390
No stopping.

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:10.599
Maybe you do three and hold, all right?

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:11.959
Let's try that one more time.

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:15.300
I want to do the three and the hold, okay?

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:16.300
That's my favorite.

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:17.300
Here we go.

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:18.300
Bend the knee.

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:19.300
Three and hold.

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.300
Three, two, one, hold.

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:27.500
Three, two, one, twist, twist, twist, twist,
twist, twist.

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:28.690
Last time each side.

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:33.170
Last one - one, two, three, okay?

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:34.920
You're going to feel that in your thighs.

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:37.280
You're going to feel that in your waistline.

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:40.160
All very good areas to work out, okay?

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.590
So the in twist, take it; have fun.
