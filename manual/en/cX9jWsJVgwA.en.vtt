Hi! My name is Kip Bradford and I am here
on behalf of Expert Village. In this clip

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:10.260
we are going to talk briefly about microphone
placement. We are going to cover using the

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:18.830
two most commonly used types of microphones
in the live environment but remember there

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:25.450
are lots and lots of choices and specifications
in experiment. Let's assume that this is a

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:31.740
typical microphone that we would use to mike
guitar cabinets and so forth, snare drums

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:39.929
and those types of things. Let's assume that
this speaker is actually a guitar cabinet.

00:00:39.929 --> 00:00:46.709
You see here is the speaker and you can kind
of see this in the video. As you move and

00:00:46.709 --> 00:00:52.359
set your microphone throughout the range of
the speaker, the width of the speaker and

00:00:52.359 --> 00:00:58.069
this is a 12 inch speaker, you will get different
tones as you set this here. The proper place

00:00:58.069 --> 00:01:02.379
to start with and it is all subjective and
you can make decisions as you listen to it

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:08.649
but normally on a guitar cabinet I will set
it about 3 or 4 inches from the grid or the

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:14.689
grill and just off the center access and you
will get a little bit warmer better tone.

00:01:14.689 --> 00:01:19.829
If you want a brighter tone, you can put it
straight in the middle. This is kind of the

00:01:19.829 --> 00:01:25.359
common place to put that for microphone placement.
Same with the snare. You would put it just

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:29.600
off center on the snare drum, off edge when
you don't want the guy hitting it and two,

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:35.040
2 to 3 inches from the top of the snare. Sometimes
you can put it underneath and pick up a snare.

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:43.909
Sometimes you will use 2 of these for the
snare and then with the vocal microphone,

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:49.900
what is really important is to maximize the
gain of your microphone and that means get

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:58.259
them closer. Any time I half the distance,
I gain 3 decibels or more input. So the proper

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:07.090
way to use a vocal microphone, a dynamic one
anyway, will be anywhere from 3 to 6 inches.

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:13.659
Now most seasonal vocalists will actually
use them much closer than that and put their

00:02:13.659 --> 00:02:18.250
mouth right on it which can pick up noise
and so forth, but closest is typically much

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:23.790
much better than far away. There is another
term that you will find used with certain

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:32.080
microphones and that is proximity effect and
proximity effect is often used by vocalists

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:38.120
especially bass singers but other vocalists
as well. Whereas the closer you get to certain

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:45.269
types of microphones or many types of microphones
the lower the frequency response. The frequency

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:52.069
response for the low notes is enhanced. So
you've seen bass singers eat the microphone

00:02:52.069 --> 00:02:57.140
on their lowest notes and they are taking
advantage of that proximity effect. There

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:02.441
are low proximity effect microphones which
as you come closer, the frequency response

00:03:02.441 --> 00:03:05.249
does change a little but not near as much.
