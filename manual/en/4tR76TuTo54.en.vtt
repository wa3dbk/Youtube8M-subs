00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:07.980
It's sort of a pride thing, you know? You're

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:12.809
not afraid to put your name on anything here.

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:14.879
Pride and perfection are

00:00:14.879 --> 00:00:17.660
pretty big words around here I would say and

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:18.739
the craftsmanship

00:00:18.739 --> 00:00:19.900
is just excellent.

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:26.900
It's a great team to be a part of.

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:29.209
It's gotta go above and beyond.

00:00:29.209 --> 00:00:31.660
It really does and

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:33.390
fortunately we have the people here to do it.

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.420
It's just phenomenal, I believe we have one of the best

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:39.970
fabrication teams in the world.

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:42.550
We're in this little bitty city 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:45.350
in Michigan and we've got

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:49.060
people from Europe wanting our product.

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:52.980
The fact that we have such a great
quality product with the Kalamazoo name

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:54.860
stamped on it, you know that's something great.

00:00:54.860 --> 00:01:01.860
It comes straight out of Kalamazoo.

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:05.399
There's not very many

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:10.670
grill makers--actually handcrafted grills--a lot of them are die pressed but we're all hand crafted.

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:15.280
That's what makes us special I think.

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:19.320
There's always going to be people out there that try to do it faster and cheaper.

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.040
You're not going to get the same product.

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:24.940
It isn't just machines putting it together. From start to finish,

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:30.350
with what we do, it's all hands-on. 

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:34.380
They are excellent welders. I mean I
couldn't ask for a better weld.

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:35.980
To become good at welding,

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:37.950
for me it takes a lot of passion.

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:41.680
I love what I do. I wouldn't change it for anything in the world.

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:44.800
Because when you're under that hood that's all you have to go by, is that sensitivity we have

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:46.600
in our eyes, in our hands, you know.

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:51.730
And just the feel for things.

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:53.120
Patience and the eye are

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:56.290
the key to the finish work.

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:58.260
Being able to blend metal to make

00:01:58.260 --> 00:01:59.089
a weld line

00:01:59.089 --> 00:02:01.650
completely disappear just amazes me.

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:03.690
That's a phenomenal job and it

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:05.450
takes a lot of talent. And you can

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:07.950
tell they've done it for years.

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.359
Detail is a real hard thing to learn.

00:02:10.359 --> 00:02:12.939
It's if you have it or you don't.

00:02:12.939 --> 00:02:15.549
It's like body lines on a car. Anybody that

00:02:15.549 --> 00:02:20.680
is a car enthusiast knows it's all about the lines and how crisp and clean they are.

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.559
Catch a glimpse of what our grills look like and you'll fall in love with them just as much as you do

00:02:24.559 --> 00:02:27.489
a fancy car.

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:29.629
Inside the door we all have our signature on it.

00:02:29.629 --> 00:02:32.950
It makes people take pride if they know their name's gonna be on it. They're gonna go that

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:35.499
extra mile to make sure it's just perfect.

00:02:35.499 --> 00:02:37.869
The biggest testament to any company out there is if

00:02:37.869 --> 00:02:44.869
they stand behind what they're building. I stand behind my craftsmanship.

00:02:45.689 --> 00:02:46.720
Everybody knows what a

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:47.870
Lamborghini is.

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:48.760
They know what it

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.190
looks like just by sight. And that's what we like our grill to look like.

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:56.979
Everyone would want one but you know, not everyone can afford one. Watching what

00:02:56.979 --> 00:02:58.269
I've made,

00:02:58.269 --> 00:03:01.689
being shipped all over the place, it's a fantastic feeling.

00:03:01.689 --> 00:03:06.359
I believe here at Kalamazoo Outdoor Gourmet, we build the best grills in the world.

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:08.789
It comes in as a sheet of stainless steel

00:03:08.789 --> 00:03:10.259
and we turn it into a work of art.
