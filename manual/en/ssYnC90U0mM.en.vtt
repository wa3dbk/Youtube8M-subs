00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.380 position:69%
Big Asteroid Flyby presented by Science@NASA

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:11.770
Here we go again.

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.410 position:94%
Another asteroid is paying a visit to the Earth-Moon system.

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:19.780 position:88%
Asteroids have been a hot topic since February 15, 2013,

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:22.500 position:69%
when one small asteroid exploded over Russia

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:26.030 position:58%
and another bigger one, 2012 DA14[1],

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:29.530 position:97%
made a record setting close approach to Earth on the same day.

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:33.370
This time the visitor is 1998 QE2,

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.570 position:86%
a potentially hazardous asteroid 2.7 km [2]in diameter.

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:40.590 position:77%
Astronomers are preparing to study the space rock

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:43.820 position:61%
as it harmlessly passes by on May 31st.

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:45.840
'This is a big asteroid

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:48.640 position:97%
that's going to be one of the best radar imaging targets of the year,'

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:52.100 position:84%
says Lance Benner of NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory.

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:53.410
'As my old friend,

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.840 position:64%
radar astronomer Steve Ostro used to say,

00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:58.660 position:78%
spaceship Earth is making a flyby of the asteroid,

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:01.150 position:88%
so we're going to exploit the capabilities of the radars

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:04.280
to understand as much as possible.'

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:06.400
At closest approach on May 31st,

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.760 position:86%
the asteroid will be 5.8 million kilometers from Earth,

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:11.980 position:58%
about 15 times farther than the Moon.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.590
'At that range,

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:15.780 position:58%
both the Goldstone and Arecibo radars

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:20.460 position:98%
should be able to make detailed images of 1998 QE2,' says Benner.

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:24.090 position:91%
'The radar maps should rival the images of other asteroids

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:26.750 position:72%
obtained by spacecraft during flyby missions.'

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:28.960
One thing that intrigues Benner

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:30.820
is the asteroid's dark complexion.

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.740 position:89%
According to measurements by the Spitzer Space Telescope,

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:38.740 position:92%
1998 QE2 reflects only 6% of the sunlight that falls on it,

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:40.570
which makes it blacker than coal.

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:46.070 position:98%
'Consequently, it could have a composition similar to that of 101955 Bennu,

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:49.310 position:78%
the target of NASA's OSIRIS-REx mission,' he says.

00:01:49.330 --> 00:01:52.110
Following launch in 2016,

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:56.080 position:98%
the OSIRIS-REx spacecraft will travel to near-Earth asteroid Bennu,

00:01:56.100 --> 00:01:57.490
study it from orbit,

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:01.420 position:98%
and ultimately bring back a sample for laboratory study on Earth.

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:05.330 position:97%
Near-Earth asteroid Bennu interests researchers for two reasons:

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:07.990
First, it is a carbon-rich asteroid

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:11.040 position:89%
that could harbor amino acids and other organic molecules

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:12.660
essential to primitive life.

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.850 position:98%
Second, it's the kind of asteroid that NASA ultimately might want to nudge.

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:19.200
Indeed, the OSIRIS-REx mission

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:23.780 position:97%
is considered to be a vital part of NASA's plans to find, study, capture

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:27.230 position:86%
and relocate an asteroid for exploration by astronauts.

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:31.590 position:84%
Perhaps 1998 QE2 will give researchers a sneak preview

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:33.830
of this fascinating space rock.

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:37.130 position:70%
Although the closest approach is on May 31st,

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:39.850
the best time to observe 1998 QE2

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:41.600 position:58%
will be during the first week of June

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.270 position:63%
when the asteroid enters northern skies.

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:45.540
At that time,

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.540 position:81%
the asteroid will turn its sunlit side toward Earth,

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:52.330 position:86%
making it an easy target for large backyard telescopes.

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:55.260 position:64%
At maximum brightness on June 3rd and 4th

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.790 position:89%
it is expected to be as bright as an 11th magnitude star.

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:01.960 position:72%
While amateur astronomers watch the space rock

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:05.020 position:83%
glide through the constellations Libra and Ophiuchus,

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.340 position:66%
NASA radars will be pinging the space rock

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:09.450 position:58%
with powerful bursts of radio energy,

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:13.800 position:97%
revealing an alien landscape that no one has ever seen before.

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:16.720 position:78%
