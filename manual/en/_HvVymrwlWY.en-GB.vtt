00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:02.110
Hi guys,

00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:05.561
Today we're making pumpkin rolls. They are
similiar to the gooey cinnamon buns that I've

00:00:05.561 --> 00:00:09.549
posted before but with the lovely autumn flavour
of pumpkin.

00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:14.169
This recipe is a bit healthier than the cinnamon
buns with the addition of pumpkin puree. But

00:00:14.169 --> 00:00:15.269
just a bit.

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:20.620
I always find baking a lot easier when I have
all the ingredients measured and set out beforehand.

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:24.320
Check out the description below for all the
ingredients and the amounts.

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:28.570
Start by mixing a cup of warm plant-milk such
as soy, with a couple tablespoons of sugar

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:31.990
and two teaspoons and a quarter of traditional
or instant yeast.

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:36.150
If you used traditional yeast, let it sit
for five to ten minutes to proof before continuing

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:37.480
to the next step.

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:42.850
Which is adding your cooked pumpkin puree.
I simply used canned stuff, but feel free

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:44.579
to cook your own from scratch.

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:49.520
Then mix that in thoroughly until there are
no lumps left.

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:55.470
Now we can add our flour, a cup at a time.
I like to add the flour, mix it in, then add

00:00:55.470 --> 00:01:00.950
some more and repeat. That way I can use as
little flour as possible to create the dough,

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:05.940
resulting in a lighter texture. The amount
of flour you'll need may vary slightly depending

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:10.420
on how dry the air is, and how wet the pumpkin
puree was.

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:14.760
You want the dough to be soft but only slightly
sticky so you can work with it. I used a total

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.659
of about 3 and a half cups of all-purpose
white flour.

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:22.180
If you decide to use whole wheat flour, you'll
end up using about a quarterless in volume

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:24.960
as the whole wheat will absorb more moisture.

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.770
Now, the dough is ready to be kneaded. I'm
dusting on more flour on the top so that it

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.490
doesn't stick to my hands too much. Just knead
it by folding an edge to the middle and pressing

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:35.790
down with the heel of your hand.

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.270
I actually took this off camera to knead on
a sturdy counter for a couple minutes.

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:45.330
Cover the dough to let it rise for 45 minutes
to an hour until doubled in size.

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:49.189
In the meantime, we can prepare the filling
for the pumpkin rolls. Simple combine some

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:51.750
pumpkin puree with brown sugar and cinnamon.

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:56.390
I actually forgot about the dough so it rose
a little more than we wanted, but it's totally

00:01:56.390 --> 00:01:57.420
fine.

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:00.610
Just dust it with flour so it doesn't stick
too much when you punch it down and gather

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:01.750
it up into a ball.

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:05.680
Now we can knead it just a little bit to get
it into a rough rectangle-ish shape and roll

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:07.990
it out.

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:13.250
Roll it to a half inch thickness or about
one an a quarter centimeter thick. Make it

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:20.430
longer on one side. Mine ended up to be about
20" long. It doesn't need to be exact.

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:24.000
Spread the pumpkin mixture in a thin layer
all over the top of the dough, leaving a strip

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.130
uncovered along the long side farthest from
you.

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:35.290
Now we roll it up. Start on the long side
closest to you and fold the edge in. Then

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:44.400
you can work up and down the roll to roll
it up evenly.

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:47.940
Let it sit on the seam while we make the goo
for these rolls that will make the bottoms

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:52.160
sticky. If you don't want your pumpkin rolls
to be sticky and keep the fat content low,

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:53.819
you can leave this step out.

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:57.850
Combine some brown sugar with brown rice syrup
and a tablespoon of vegan butter. I used Earth

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:02.680
Balance buttery spread as usual. Nuke it in
the microwave for about 20 seconds and stir

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:03.959
it up.

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:08.850
Cut the roll up into one and a half inch sections
which is just under 4 centimeters.

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:15.160
I used a sharp serated knife, using a back
and forth motion to prevent any unwanted squishing.

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.850
Once you have all your rolls cut up, pour
the syrup mixute into a pan prepared with

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:24.120
parchment paper. I'm using two 10 by 7 inch
pans, but feel free to use whatever you have.

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:28.550
Then, place the rolls into the pans, leaving
an inch or two between each one so they have

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:32.420
room to expand. Then cover them with a damp
cloth and let them rise for a half hour in

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:37.230
a warm lace or until they are all puffed up
like this.

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:42.371
Bake them in a preheated oven at 400 degrees
farenheit for fifteen to twenty minutes. They

00:03:42.371 --> 00:03:45.980
will be just a bit browned on the top but
not too much.

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:50.660
The bottoms will be slighly caramelized which
adds a nice chewy stickiness to the otherwise

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:52.200
soft and fluffy buns.

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:57.620
And that's it! Soft, pumpkin, cinnamon rolls
that are not too sweet. They freeze well too.

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:01.209
Just wrap them up before you do. To thaw,
just take them out to thaw at room temperature

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:06.620
for a couple hours or nuke them in the microwave
for 20 seconds at a time, just don't over

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:07.620
do it.

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:11.340
