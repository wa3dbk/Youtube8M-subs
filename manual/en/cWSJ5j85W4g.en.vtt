00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:05.490
Hi guys, we're still in Tokyo.

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.219
I'm standing in front of the Senso-ji temple,

00:00:08.219 --> 00:00:10.889
located in Asakusa district, a very well-known part of the city.

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:12.730
The place itself might seem a bit touristy,

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:15.080
but it's actually quite popular with locals

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:17.020
who come here to enjoy a nice walk.

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:19.700
There's a market right next to it

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:21.800
with street food, snacks,

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.430
souvenirs and other knick-knacks, some of them quite cool.

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:27.100
Behind me you can see one of the oldest

00:00:27.100 --> 00:00:29.500
and most well known Buddhist templest in Japan.

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:36.270
The market and Senso-ji temple are both extremely popular

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.480
among Japanese people as well, which creates the vibe

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.070
that's suprisingly authentic.

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.210
 

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:47.000
You can buy a lot of groovy snacks to munch on

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.800
this one is like a pastry in crunchy batter,

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:52.690
filled with green tea flavoured bean paste.

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:54.540
Good stuff.

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:55.970
This is not real cherry blossom though,

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:58.400
actual trees blossom a bit later in the year

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:02.000
Behind me you can see the entrance to the temple,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.300
we won't be messing around there.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.900
Traditionally, visitors put some money in a dedicated spot

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:12.000
and utter a wish they hope to come true.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.700
It's an old Japanese custom,

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:15.300
perhaps the main reason for visiting temples here.

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.500
Over there you can see a Buddhist temple

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.420
and literally across the road

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:28.740
there's a Shinto shrine.

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.610
You can recognize it by

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:33.500
the presence of the distinctive gates.

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.100
Those are the two main religions in Japan

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:38.100
and it seems to be the case with Japan in general,

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.100
or maybe with those two religions in general

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.000
that it's not strictly separated, you don't have to choose sides.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.800
The beliefs are very free-flowing

00:01:44.800 --> 00:01:46.900
and depending on the time of the year,

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:48.900
or the holidays observed

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:51.600
you go to one temple or the other

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.040
and it doesn't create any tension or discrimination.

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.040
Easy way to memorize te difference

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.420
between the two faiths

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:01.110
is to remember that Shinto is an animistic spirituality

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:03.390
where the supernatural is strongly tied to the nature.

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.300
You might be familiar with the Naruto anime series

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:07.600
or Princess Mononoke, a Studio Ghibli production

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.380
...or the Okami video game

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:11.230
well, these are all pop-culture phenomena

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:13.500
heavily inspired by Shinto.

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.400
Shinto is a spirituality indigenous to Japan

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.500
whereas Buddhism emerged elsewhere,

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.800
somewhere on the border of India and China

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.000
and is not a 'religion' in the strict, Western sense of the word

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.170
more of a philisophical system, really

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.319
or a way of living

00:02:31.319 --> 00:02:33.000
in which the goal is to achieve nirvana.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.200
The Japanese absorbed it and customized it their own way,

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.200
as one does.

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:41.230
And this is how Zen Buddhism influenced a great deal of

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.370
the most well-known Japanese traditions

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:46.300
such as the tea brewing ceremony

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:49.300
the Bushido samurai code, Ikebana

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:53.800
all those customs that we traditionally associate with Japanese culture.

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.800
Behind me you can see the Hanayashiki amusement park

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:04.300
a sort of a miniature theme park

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:06.300
one of the oldest ones in Japan actually

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:08.300
over 150 years old.

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:10.300
This one's interesting simply because it's so tiny.

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:13.700
There's a tiny carousel, miniature roller-coaster, all that sort of stuff.

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:15.100
Let's go check it out.

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:17.100
There's an enormous ferris wheel

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:19.100
gigantic roller-coaster

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:22.500
the splendor of it is very Polish-style, frankly

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:27.650
Interesting thing about Asakusa

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:29.600
is that prior the war it used to be

00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:34.000
one of the most popular entertainment districts of Tokyo

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.500
it enjoyed that fame until the war

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:40.000
during which it was bombarded, unfortunately

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
and it all changed after it's been rebuilt

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
the neighbourhood today is a bit run-down, you could say

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
After all this we're going to need a quick stop

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.269
...for a pint of Kirin.

00:03:58.269 --> 00:04:01.329
the full name is Kirin Ichiban, which literally means 'number one' beer

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:02.769
and there's the oyster

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:05.479
which has been served warm

00:04:05.479 --> 00:04:08.400
it's the first time I'm eating an oyster that's been warmed up

00:04:12.719 --> 00:04:14.000
Super

00:04:15.029 --> 00:04:17.000
Let's see if Yuen likes it.

00:04:39.059 --> 00:04:41.500
Here we have an entire shelf filled with maneki-neko

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:44.500
the cat figurines you put by the entrance

00:04:44.529 --> 00:04:46.739
quite common in restaurants

00:04:46.739 --> 00:04:48.169
as they supposedly bring luck

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:50.590
and prosperity

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:52.300
basically money.

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:57.500
This is the best thing about food-shopping in Asia.

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:59.500
You have no idea what you order, when you order it

00:05:02.699 --> 00:05:04.600
... and no idea what you're eating

00:05:05.949 --> 00:05:08.020
A place that serves ice cream burgers

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:10.000
alas, it's closed down.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.000
Here we have a hot-served bun

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.700
with curry sauce filling, very popular here.

00:05:31.249 --> 00:05:33.400
It's something you have to try when you're in Japan.

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:46.500
The cool thing about all the market stalls, shops, restaurants in Japan

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:49.900
is that nobody ever tells you they've got no change left.

00:05:49.969 --> 00:05:51.800
They always have change here!

00:05:52.879 --> 00:05:55.600
A pastry made of nut and bean paste

00:05:55.619 --> 00:05:58.200
wrapped in pancake dough.

00:06:00.279 --> 00:06:02.079
The problem I have with Japanese desserts

00:06:02.079 --> 00:06:05.189
is that the flavour is always very subtle

00:06:05.189 --> 00:06:08.400
and the only strong flavour you can taste

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:11.600
is the bitter-sweet flavour of the bean paste

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:13.600
which about every Japanese sweet is made of.

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:21.150
You can watch our upcoming videos

00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:23.160
from our trip to Tokyo

00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:25.100
we'll be staying here for over a month,

00:06:25.100 --> 00:06:27.500
and we only just got started.

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:29.500
So, yeah, watch us.

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:40.000
There's beatles

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000
sesame shrimps

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:46.720
Hi there, it's Krzysztof

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:48.700
I just finished editing the video

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:50.100
hope you enjoyed it

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:52.800
because I've stayed up all night sitting in front of the bloody computer.

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:56.300
As you could see at the very end I bought some beatles

00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:58.000
and other fun snacks

00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:02.210
if you want to see us tasting them, especially Yuen tasting them

00:07:02.210 --> 00:07:05.139
visit my facebook page, it's facebook.com/kgonciarz

00:07:05.139 --> 00:07:07.289
that's where we'll upload the video

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:10.500
the bug tasting video that is.

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:11.500
And it'll only be on facebook

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:13.500
so  - go watch it there.

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:14.500
Bye!
