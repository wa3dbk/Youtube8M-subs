00:00:14.389 --> 00:00:24.410
A 
lot of fans will tell you the glory years

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:26.449
of professional wrestling were the mid-nineties.

00:00:26.449 --> 00:00:31.230
While you could argue whether or not that’s
true in terms of quality…in terms of popularity,

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.560
there’s no question.

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:34.640
More people were watching wrestling then ever
before.

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.650
And everyone had taken a side in the now-legendary
Monday Night Wars.

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:40.620
It was a great time for wrestling.

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.339
And it was a great time for wrestling video
games.

00:00:43.339 --> 00:00:48.680
But before all the classics, like Revenge
and No Mercy…there was this.

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.260
Hey, even the best matches start slow.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:01:01.460
It’s WCW vs. the World.

00:01:01.460 --> 00:01:03.399
So let’s put this one into context.

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:08.030
WCW vs. the World was released in February
of 1997.

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:14.430
That’s about nine months before WCW vs.
nWO: World Tour hit the Nintendo 64.

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:17.200
And that was the one that really started it
all.

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.060
That was a great wrestling game.

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:22.840
From there, you had Revenge, which might be
the best of the era…as well as all the great

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:24.720
WWF games, too.

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:30.680
So…in a way, WCW vs. the World was THQ’s
first step toward that greatness.

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:38.180
That said, it was definitely a baby step.

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:39.770
So first things first.

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:41.930
The game claims to have more than 50 wrestlers.

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:47.040
And while that’s certainly technically true…only
about a dozen of them are actually from WCW.

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.829
And the rest are made-up.

00:01:48.829 --> 00:01:52.780
They’re actually fictional characters, based
on international wrestlers.

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:57.650
And personally, that has always struck me
as…more than a little deceptive.

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:02.810
To call this a WCW game, when WCW literally
makes up about a fourth of the roster.

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:08.299
Of course, to be fair…it is called WCW vs.
the World.

00:02:08.299 --> 00:02:13.890
So the fact that WCW is just one of the game’s
many organizations kind of makes sense.

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.620
And to be honest, it’s actually an awesome
idea.

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:20.110
To combine some of the world’s biggest wrestling
feds into one game.

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:25.160
But the thing is, that’s only an awesome
idea if you actually have the actual feds.

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:30.349
Without any licensing, WCW vs. the World takes
a wink-and-a-nod approach.

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:33.239
There’s this Empire Wrestling Federation,
right?

00:02:33.239 --> 00:02:35.530
It’s actually based on All Japan Pro Wrestling.

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:37.709
And the same goes for the wrestlers.

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:43.569
So, uh…this made-up Samoa guy is actually
based on the legendary Giant Baba, from All

00:02:43.569 --> 00:02:44.569
Japan.

00:02:44.569 --> 00:02:55.560
And it’s the same for the four other “fictional”
federations.

00:02:55.560 --> 00:03:09.910
But again, without the actual licensing, without
the names…it just feels pointless.

00:03:09.910 --> 00:03:12.340
So the awesome idea is really only that.

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:13.750
An awesome idea.

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:15.800
And unfortunately, the gameplay isn’t a
whole lot better.

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:20.430
Again, this was before the grappling system
that defined Revenge and the classic games

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:21.430
of this era.

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:25.049
So as a result, WCW vs. the World feels clunky.

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:27.970
Everything’s based on how long you hold
down buttons.

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:32.799
So just tapping a button does something different
than holding it longer, before you let go.

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:37.080
Frankly, that’s not a terribly accurate
or smooth way to play a wrestling game.

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:42.170
And you know, I always say this, but…polygons
age really badly.

00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:44.069
And this game’s really a perfect example.

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:45.189
It just looks terrible.

00:03:45.189 --> 00:03:49.030
And it’s not like you can say the same for
the previous generation’s wrestling games.

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:52.010
A lot of the 16-bit wrestling games still
look great.

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:55.730
Sprites are basically impervious to aging.

00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:58.110
These early polygons…not so much.

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:06.410
WCW vs. the World looks as old as it plays,
and it doesn’t sound much better.

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:13.800
Now, to the game’s credit…it does land
some of its punches.

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:17.690
Even if most of the wrestlers are just made
up, it does have a pretty massive roster.

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:18.849
Especially for 1997.

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:20.440
There’s a lot of options, too.

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:26.210
And the game does this really cool thing where…on
the menu, the wrestlers have these cartoony

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:27.510
profile pictures.

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:29.690
Almost like they’re comic book heroes, which
is awesome.

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:32.950
And it actually gives the game more of that
international flair, too.

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:38.630
It’s just a shame that…in game, you get
awful polygons instead of cartoony sprites.

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:42.750
Had the game carried that look over into the
gameplay, and made it 2D…that would’ve

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:43.750
been sweet.

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:46.169
Then again, it was 1997.

00:04:46.169 --> 00:04:49.659
We were…obsessed, with f*cking polygons.

00:04:49.659 --> 00:04:50.659
Brother.

00:04:50.659 --> 00:04:55.760
So I guess if you’re a big wrestling fan,
and either…you collect old wrestling games,

00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:00.270
or you really want to put that era’s classics
into a better context, this might be worth

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:01.409
a look.

00:05:01.409 --> 00:05:05.860
And you can also play that really sad game
of “how many of the wrestlers in this game

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:07.469
are dead,” as you’re playing it.

00:05:07.469 --> 00:05:09.760
So it’s like two games in one.

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:10.760
Benoit.

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:12.410
It’s WCW vs. the World.

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:35.840
Thanks to our tag-team partner ____ for sending
it in.
