00:00:06.879 --> 00:00:12.490
We've all seen the tabletop retro arcade machines
at a hipster-ish coffee shop, or maybe at

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:17.610
a family friendly restaurant, and honestly,
who hasn't been tempted to put in a few coins

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:20.630
to relive (or just try out) a few classics?

00:00:20.630 --> 00:00:24.719
Eventually the rose-tinted glasses aren't
enough and you realize why we've moved on

00:00:24.719 --> 00:00:29.519
- it's nice to pay a visit to the forefathers
of modern gaming, but you wouldn't want to

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:30.519
stay there.

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:34.750
Frogger: Hyper Arcade Edition attempts to
gussy-up the original classic and package

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:40.130
it for a modern audience, but unlike its console
releases the multiplayer aspect - the one

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:44.900
thing that managed to separate it from the
arcade original has been curbed with AI-only

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:45.900
opponents.

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:49.930
Aside from playing a smoothly scaled version
of the original gameplay, you can choose to

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:51.710
play in one of 5 different modes.

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:56.140
A sixth is on offer, but it's merely an amalgamation
of all the others.

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:00.720
These modes include a pixel-painting game
where any move outside the image results in

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:05.470
death; three 'versus' modes that include variations
on 'King of the Hill', 'Capture the Flag'

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:10.520
and an area control based mode; lastly, if
you fancy yourself a true hardcore Frogger

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:14.740
player, a 'twin' mode forces you to get two
frogs home at a time.

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:17.670
By now, some younger or newer gamers may be
lost.

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.649
Frogger, for those who aren't familiar, is
a game about survival and procreation - more

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:26.750
specifically, you need to cross a hazardous
highway, then brave the river rapids, only

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:30.320
to plant down in one of the available slots
at the top of the screen.

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:33.639
Fill them all up and you move on to a harder
stage.

00:01:33.639 --> 00:01:38.389
In a way the graphics have been revitalized
by using a voxel-like system where each pixel

00:01:38.389 --> 00:01:40.229
is in fact a 3D cube.

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:45.280
This makes for pretty explosions when anything
dies, but on smaller iOS devices it's honestly

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.159
hard to make out any real change from the
original.

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:52.270
Of course there are plenty of alternative
'themes' to choose from, including Castlevania,

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:58.209
Contra and DDR, but no matter the skin or
music loop you choose, it feels the same.

00:01:58.209 --> 00:02:02.350
As mentioned already, the inability to play
against friends means the AI supported stages

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.729
quickly wear out their welcome, leaving the
arcade original as the only real harbor for

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:08.450
lasting replay value.

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:12.800
Sadly for Frogger: Hyper Arcade Edition, we
already have plenty of remakes and 'clones'

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:17.230
on offer already, making this one for hardcore
fans who enjoy the pretty themes they can

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:25.080
choose from.
