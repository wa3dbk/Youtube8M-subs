JOE WILES: In this segment, we're going to
take a look at number 15 on our top 80 most

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:07.920
downloaded guitar tabs on the Internet. It's
"Black Dog" by Led Zeppelin. Let's take a

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:13.180
look. Now we're going to use a standard pentatonic
scale with a couple of extra notes. Go ahead

00:00:13.180 --> 00:00:17.250
and pay attention. We're going to start with
our ring finger on the 7th fret of the A string,

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:25.939
okay? Then with our index, middle and ring,
we're going to go on the D string, five, six,

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:39.870
seven. Bring our ring finger back to that
other note, okay? It sounds like this. Then

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:46.309
we take our index finger to the 5th fret of
the G string and give it a little bend, and

00:00:46.309 --> 00:00:58.879
then bring our ring finger to the 7th fret
of the D string. I'm going to play that section

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:09.890
of the riff very slowly. Pay attention, please.
Now, we're going to learn this in sections,

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:14.140
okay? This is the first bit. We're going to
play that slowly a few times in a row so you

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:46.150
can play along, okay? One more time. To speed,
that actual riff sounds like this. Now, that's

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:50.220
the first bit of that riff. We're going to
through it in three different segments and

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:54.100
explain that riff in three different segments
because it's a really cool rock and roll riff,

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:56.472
and we want to make sure we get it right,
okay? I'll see you in the next segment where

00:01:56.472 --> 00:01:59.170
we're going to explore segment 2 of "Black
Dog." See you there.
