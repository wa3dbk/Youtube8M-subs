Hi my name is Sarah Schieck, I'm a Swine Extension Educator

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:10.880
with the University of Minnesota Extension

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.070
In this video segment I'm gonna go over

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:16.780
some biosecurity tips when raising pigs

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:19.220
in hoop structures and other open areas

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:23.680
I'm currently standing at our hoop structure area

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:26.240
at the University of Minnesota's

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:29.220
West Central Research and Outreach Center.

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.580
As you can tell, even though it is an open environment

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:36.510
we can still implement biosecurity.

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.760
One of the ways that we can implement biosecurity

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:42.980
in this open area is by having a fence line

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:45.559
which is considered our line of separation

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:49.580
This fence separates the rest of the farm

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:52.640
from the hoop structure area.

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:58.559
When employees and visitors cross into the hoop structure area

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:01.770
it is important for them to have on clean footwear

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.159
and coveralls if they're going to be working with the pigs.

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:08.820
Now if we have visitors that are just here to tour the area

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:11.100
disposable booties are just fine.

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.560
When leaving the hoop area then it is important to clean off footwear

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.680
and remove the coveralls so they can be washed for the next use.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.900
If plastic booties are worn

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:27.310
they should be removed and then thrown
away in the trash out here

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.660
Let's talk about disinfecting or boots for later use

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:36.620
It's important first to remove all organic matter

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:40.860
which would include manure and any bedding.

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:44.540
Once all organic matter has been removed from the boot

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:46.880
now we can disinfect them

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:49.640
some disinfectant that have been

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:52.740
proven successful against PRRS,

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.520
 which stands for porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:01.120
and PED which stands for Porcine Epidemic Diarrhea virus

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:05.850
are Synergize, Virkon S, Tek-Trol,

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:08.540
1 Stroke Environ and Clorox

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:14.040
Whenever using disinfectants, it is always important to use them according to label directions.

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.200
Just like other swine facilities here at
the West Central Research and Outreach Center

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:25.420
our hoop structures also follow the All-in-All-out management practice.

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:30.260
In between groups all bedding is removed down to the clay pad

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.820
at the bottom the hoop barn structures.

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:37.340
Aglime is applied if needed to kill any pathogens

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:40.800
the hoops sit pig free for a while

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:46.880
until nursery pigs are ready to come into the grow-finish hoop area

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:49.200
and new bedding is applied at that time.

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:52.540
In addition to having a visitor policy

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:55.950
and following an All-in-All-out management practice

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:59.340
the control of wildlife, birds and other pests

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:03.120
is important, as they can be things

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:07.060
that can introduce disease into your swine herd.

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:10.780
Some of the ways that you can minimize the threat of pests

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:15.860
is to keep your feed covered, clean up any feed spills as they occur,

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:20.360
keep the area free of any weeds and debris, 

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:24.600
making the area less desirable for pests.

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.260
use rodent bait stations

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:32.040
When utilizing rodent bait stations it is important to keep them away

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:35.909
from any pigs and also to maintain them regularly

00:03:35.909 --> 00:03:41.580
and lastly it's important to dispose of any mortalities in a timely manner.

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:43.540
All of these are tips that you can apply to your

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:47.460
swine hoop structures and other open areas.

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:52.020
Remember biosecurity is your responsibility to decrease

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:55.370
the risk of disease entry into your swine herd

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:59.090
from animals, people, equipment and vehicles.

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:02.330
