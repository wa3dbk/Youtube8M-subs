Hi I'm Emily Hiza and I am the volunteer assistant at Oregon State Unversity

00:00:06.502 --> 00:00:11.285
and we are doing the basics of volleyball 
 here. And I have my two assistants

00:00:11.262 --> 00:00:22.872
Izzie is 10, and has been playing for a year and Mattie over here is 12, has been playing for 
 5 years. So, we’re going to be going over, how to teach younger kids the basics of volleyball.

00:00:24.567 --> 00:00:34.876
Okay, so the first skill were going to talk about is passing. And the first thing we’re going to go 
 over is body position and what we want our bodies to look and feel like before we start passing.

00:00:34.876 --> 00:00:46.486
So feet apart, a little wider than shoulder width apart. Okay, and I teach that if you were to bend your knees 
 a little bit and lean on your knees like this, it’s pretty comfortable, we can hang out there for a while.

00:00:46.486 --> 00:00:51.177
And now without moving our body we just 
 want to move our hands like this.

00:00:51.177 --> 00:00:59.048
And with the new rules being a little more lenient with 
 overhead passing, I teach, I call it “campfires” 

00:00:59.048 --> 00:01:00.465
so we are warming our hands by a campfire right here. 

00:01:00.465 --> 00:01:04.900
Halfway between passing the ball underhand and passing the ball overhand. 

00:01:05.178 --> 00:01:06.572
So my arm are hanging out here

00:01:06.386 --> 00:01:08.058
So stand back up. 

00:01:08.058 --> 00:01:11.448
So, if I say ready position for passing, we 
 do this now. There you go. 

00:01:11.448 --> 00:01:17.648
Our weight is one our toes a little more than our heels,  so we 
 can kind of wiggle our heels a little bit. There we go. 

00:01:17.648 --> 00:01:19.459
Good so you guys can stand up.

00:01:19.584 --> 00:01:27.841
So the most important thing in passing, it doesn't matter how good your platform is or how much 
 control you have with your hands. Its all about getting to the ball with your feet.

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:36.549
So the first progression that we are going to start with is Izzie is 
 going to be my shuffler and Mattie is going to be my roller

00:01:36.781 --> 00:01:44.300
So we are going to roll the ball on the ground and Izzie’s goal as 
 the shuffler is to get the ball to roll directly between her feet.

00:01:44.745 --> 00:01:48.550
And she wants her feet to be stopped when 
 that ball goes between her legs. 

00:01:48.553 --> 00:01:53.430
Okay. So Mattie if you want to go a little 
 bit back there. Izzie face Mattie, there we go.

00:01:53.244 --> 00:01:58.860
So Mattie is going to roll from side to side and Izzie is 
 going to shuffle to get that ball to go between her legs.

00:02:00.628 --> 00:02:02.300
Perfect!

00:02:05.782 --> 00:02:07.780
Yep!

00:02:11.866 --> 00:02:13.870
Good, so you guys want to switch? Mattie you want to 
 be the middle one? Here you go, ready, roller. 

00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:39.960
There we go, good! Yep!Stand up normal and ready position. And shuffle. There 
 you go. You need to work a little harder than this.

00:02:43.074 --> 00:02:44.470
There we go, good!

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:58.910
So the next progression after we get our feet to the ball is 
 that we always want to pass our ball in our mid line.

00:02:59.096 --> 00:03:09.360
So to emphasize that we have Izzie here wearing a larger shirt. And what she’s going to be 
 doing is mimicking passing in her mid line by catching that ball in that big shirt. 

00:03:09.962 --> 00:03:13.440
So, we still want to get into our ready 
 position. Ready position, there we go. 

00:03:13.445 --> 00:03:20.780
And then she’s going to
grab the side of her shirt and if we’re going to serve 
 over the net and the ball comes to her, she’s going to shuffle, 

00:03:21.108 --> 00:03:24.170
get to the ball and catch it right in your mid line.

00:03:27.958 --> 00:03:37.990
Ok, so the drill is going to be: Maddie is my tosser over there, she is going to be tossing the ball over the net to Izzie, 
 so izzie is working on. We just worked on our lovely shuffle. If Maddie tosses to where she has to shuffle to the ball 

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:39.990
She is going to use those shuffles.

00:03:41.217 --> 00:03:44.300
Her goal is to catch it in her mid 
 line, right here with that shirt. 

00:03:44.305 --> 00:03:51.320
What we want to try and avoid doing is parachuting up. So 
 we still want to keep our shoulders above our knees

00:03:51.526 --> 00:03:56.890
and we want to catch it with our feet 
 stopped and balanced wide, not balanced skinny. 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:04:02.370
So, a nice balanced position right in our mid line, 
 and catch with our shoulders above our knees.

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:06.390
Okay, here we go.

00:04:06.944 --> 00:04:09.960
Good, there we go. A little bit more shoulders above our knees.

00:04:13.957 --> 00:04:17.810
Good. Keep your feet balanced and wide. Let’s do one more

00:04:21.642 --> 00:04:30.880
So the next progression for this is, Mattie will take away this arm here 
 and going to be practicing getting our fake platform out there. 

00:04:30.884 --> 00:04:37.870
And so Izzie is over there tossing and she is going to toss the 
 ball over here. And using the shuffles that we just worked on, 

00:04:37.873 --> 00:04:45.070
if the ball is not right to us. We’re going to shuffling to get ourselves 
 in a position to get the ball to bounce right in between our legs.

00:04:46.256 --> 00:04:55.920
The goal is to get it bounce right between our feet so it doesn't hit our body. Sometimes it will bounce too 
 far in front and bounce up and hit us in the belly or sometimes it will hit you directly. 

00:04:55.915 --> 00:04:59.260
If it hits you directly that means your too close to the ball. 

00:04:59.259 --> 00:05:09.800
If it bounces too far in front and hits you in the stomach, after the bounce, it means you are too far away 
 from the ball. So our perfect goal is to get it to bounce between our legs without hitting our body. 

00:05:10.265 --> 00:05:18.760
We’re also going to emphasize getting our feet stopped and balanced still. So, sometimes 
 kids will lift their legs to try to get the ball to bounce.

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:27.030
So feet stopped and balanced still. And still hopefully in that 
 ready position with our shoulders above our knees. Okay. Alright.

00:05:30.234 --> 00:05:32.230
You got it.

00:05:37.525 --> 00:05:40.500
There’s a good one. Grab another ball.

00:05:40.934 --> 00:05:44.030
Stopped and balanced shoulders above our knees.

00:05:47.278 --> 00:05:49.280
There it is. One more Izzie.

00:05:54.011 --> 00:05:58.140
So the final step in this passing progression is adding the platform in.

00:05:58.145 --> 00:06:05.110
And some things that we want to be focusing on with partner passing 
 are: pass and hold, so what I mean
by that is, 

00:06:05.111 --> 00:06:16.160
I want them once the ball comes to them to really emphasize freezing after they pass and that is so that 
 coaches and players can evaluate what is going on with their body. If their feet are in the right position.

00:06:16.163 --> 00:06:25.260
If their shoulders are above their knees. If their 
 platform is too high or too low. 

00:06:20.093 --> 00:06:25.010
So, ideally our platform is right in the middle 
 of too low and too high.  

00:06:25.753 --> 00:06:28.540
So were going to pass and hold in this position.

00:06:29.894 --> 00:06:34.240
If Mattie here has to shuffle to her left, we 
 want her hips to always be facing the target.

00:06:34.239 --> 00:06:42.630
So when she shuffles to her left then passes and holds. Ideally we want her 
 to have her left foot a little bit more forward than her right.

00:06:38.756 --> 00:06:42.890
Ideally we want her left foot a little 
 bit more forward than her right foot.

00:06:42.889 --> 00:06:47.580
And so her hips are facing back towards Izzie. If she 
 were to change and put her right foot forward.

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:52.040
There we go. Her hips naturally kind of face away from the target. 

00:06:52.038 --> 00:06:58.310
So, I teach, and there are multiple ways to teach this, but I 
 teach left foot forward, when she’s passing from the left side.

00:06:58.307 --> 00:07:01.880
 If she were to shuffle over here, 
 and pass on the right side, 

00:07:02.348 --> 00:07:06.530
Then our right foot is a little bit forward so her 
 hips can naturally facing back to the Izzie. 

00:07:06.527 --> 00:07:11.150
So ideally we are taking every ball in our 
 mid line and not reaching outside. 

00:07:11.148 --> 00:07:15.610
It's easiest to pass straight on our mid 
 line with our hips facing our target.

00:07:17.975 --> 00:07:20.950
Okay. So let’s do a couple of practice passes.

00:07:20.947 --> 00:07:22.660
There you go. Pass and hold.

00:07:23.919 --> 00:07:28.540
Pass and hold. There were go. So, you want to 
 avoid any kind of big swinging motions. 

00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:31.980
You kind of want to think about pushing the 
 ball, more than swinging at the ball. 

00:07:31.976 --> 00:07:36.300
So that is what the whole drill emphasizes 
 is “No swing, just a push.” 

00:07:39.384 --> 00:07:42.170
Pass and hold. Good

00:07:42.333 --> 00:07:44.360
Pass and hold. Good
