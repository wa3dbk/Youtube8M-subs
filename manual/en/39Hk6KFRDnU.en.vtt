00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:07.730
Yay! I've been awake for 7 hours!

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:09.350
Yay!

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:10.100
Congrats!

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:12.550
Thank you! I can still go on...

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:15.370
Aimin is... awake!

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:16.800
Could you do that again?

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.970
Again?

00:00:19.562 --> 00:00:20.496
Aimin is...

00:00:20.496 --> 00:00:21.230
AWAKE!

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:23.210
Yay!!

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:27.250
Next up is the "midday dice."

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:29.430
First time rolling this one!

00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:30.430
Omamo Rhythm.

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:31.540
Power Stone.

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:32.430
Pressure Points.

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:33.720
Driver Alarm.

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:34.760
Omamo Rhythm.

00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:35.760
Power Stone.

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:36.670
Ostrich Pillow.

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:37.730
Sun Bathing.

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:39.580
Did you even try?

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:41.080
What do you mean?

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:42.110
What's wrong with it?

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:44.500
There's double of two of them!

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:45.450
Where? Where?

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:46.850
There's 2 Omamo Rhythms,

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:48.400
and 2 Power Stones.

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:55.480
One of the Omamo Rhythm induces sleep,

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:58.450
the other Omamo Rhythm gets rid of drowsiness.

00:00:58.450 --> 00:00:59.560
Is that so?!

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:01.330
The power stones are different ones too!

00:01:01.330 --> 00:01:02.505
Yes, they're different.
The power stones are different ones too!

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.250
I get it now. That's alright then.

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.690
Which one should I roll?

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:08.340
The midday dice kind of sucks...

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:10.610
My recommendation is the power stone.

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:11.510
The power stone?

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:12.640
Last time it came in handy!

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:13.899
Really?
Last time it came in handy!

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:16.380
I want to roll the power stone!

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:19.650
Seven.

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:20.850
Ostrich Pillow?!

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.890
Yay!! Ostrich pillow!

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:26.020
Omame, will you?

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:28.190
Here it is.

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:29.330
What is this?!

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:30.310
It's the ostrich pillow.

00:01:30.310 --> 00:01:33.880
Ostrich... Pillow... Ostrich pillow?

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.340
People are going to stare more with this on!

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:59.470
Do I just wear this on my head?

00:01:59.470 --> 00:02:01.290
Yes. That's right.
Do I just wear this on my head?

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:04.517
Huh? My mouth goes in the hole?

00:02:04.517 --> 00:02:05.317
Yep.
Huh? My mouth goes in the hole?

00:02:05.317 --> 00:02:06.230
Are you serious?!

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:07.130
That's perfect!

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:09.138
This is harder than the eye mask!

00:02:09.138 --> 00:02:09.572
Yup.
This is harder than the eye mask!

00:02:09.572 --> 00:02:09.580
Yup.

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.550
My goodness.

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:18.390
There are holes to put your hands in on the top.

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:23.630
The ostrich pillow has full affect when you lie down.

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:27.800
Now put your hands in the holes.

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.090
Yup. That's perfect!

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:31.170
What's perfect?!

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:32.470
Aren't you cozy in it?

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:35.040
Yes, I kind of get it...

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:36.330
Yeah, but...

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:39.830
I'm more self conscious when I put this on.

00:02:41.237 --> 00:02:42.330
I feel embarrassed.

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:45.320
Could you mimic an ostrich?

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:52.680
Ostriches makes sounds, don't they?

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:53.582
Huh...?
Ostriches makes sounds, don't they?

00:02:53.582 --> 00:02:53.590
Huh...?

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:57.110
QUACK!!

00:02:58.003 --> 00:02:59.320
Can I stop now...?

00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:00.990
Yes, thank you very much.

00:03:00.990 --> 00:03:02.270
This is tough work.

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:06.340
Will you be able to get married now?

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:09.240
I would like to get married in the future...

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:12.830
You'll be fine. You look so attractive right now.
