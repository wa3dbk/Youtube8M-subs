00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:16.020
The 2013 Lexus GS450h is powered by a hybrid
drive train with a 3.5-liter V6 engine and

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:20.840
permanent magnet electric motor that produces
a total of 338 horsepower (HP).

00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:25.080
The rear-wheel-drive (RWD) GS450h is fitted
with an Electronically-controlled Continuously

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.000
Variable Transmission (ECVT).

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.170
The official fuel economy estimates for the
2013 Lexus GS450h are 29 city / 34 highway

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:34.500
miles per gallon.

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.210
In our week-long test with a Meteor Blue Mica
review unit, we trumped the official mileage

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.820
estimates, scoring an average of 38.2 MPG
on the Interstate highway (test abbreviated

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:48.420
due to rain) and 32.3 MPG combined with temperatures
ranging from the sixties through the high

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.219
eighties.

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:54.680
Straight line acceleration is quite thrilling
for a sedan of this heft, with a 0-60 mile

00:00:54.680 --> 00:01:13.430
per hour (MPH) factory rating of 5.6 seconds.

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:18.759
The GS450h provides a wealth of visual feedback
for fuel-concious drivers, with an analog

00:01:18.759 --> 00:01:23.550
power/eco/charge gauge, a thermometer-style
Current MPG readout, and a Trip Information

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:29.450
Chart on the gigantic optional 12.3-inch LCD
display.

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.700
Ride and handling are top shelf, as one would
expect from a sporting luxury sedan with a

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:37.599
starting sticker price of just under $59,000.

00:01:37.599 --> 00:01:42.720
Paddle-shifters are standard for those that
prefer to click through simulated gearing.

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:48.390
The GS450h’s Drive Mode can be switched
between Normal, Eco, Sport S, Sport S+ and

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:50.170
EV modes.

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:54.830
The cabin is sumptuous, with a unique bamboo
and leather heated steering wheel that feels

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:56.920
like a fine piece of sculpture.

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.250
Who else would think to use bamboo for interior
trim?

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:05.590
Seating is exceptional with the standard driver
and passenger front bucket seats providing

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:09.530
10-way power adjustment, along with three-level
heating and ventilation through perforated

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:11.090
leather upholstery.

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:15.420
Our tester was equipped with the Luxury Option
package, with the multi-countour front buckets

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:21.390
offering 18-way power adjustment with four-way
lumbar, articulating backrest, extendable

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:26.450
lower cushions, and side bolster controls.

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:31.690
The standard twelve-speaker Lexus Premium
audio system with Enform includes iPod support,

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:35.440
Hands-free Bluetooth, streaming audio, and
automatic phonebook download.

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.700
The system is controlled via the center console.

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:45.130
While it’s gorgeous to behold, Enform’s
advanced app features were not compatible

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:46.560
with my old iPhone 3G.

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.660
Subsequently, we were not able to put them
to the test.

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:51.710
Moral of the story?

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:56.640
If you can afford a GS450h, you can afford
a new iPhone

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:01.720
The voice controlled navigation system includes
SiriusXM NavTraffic, NavWeather, Sports, Stocks

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.060
and Fuel Price information.

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:08.630
A 12-volt outlet is located in the center
console, along with auxiliary audio and USB

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:09.630
inputs.

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:14.650
A 120V outlet can be found at the back of
the center console.

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:23.780
The rear seats are quite accommodating, with
37.8 inches of headroom and 36.3 inches of

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:24.780
legroom.

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:26.090
Rear seat heating is optional.

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:30.770
The center armrest allows rear seat passengers
to take charge of the audio system, rear climate

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:34.540
control and sunshade.

00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:40.880
The trunk provides 13.2 cubic feet of cargo
area, along with a handy first aid kit.

00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:50.180
All-in-all, the Lexus GS450h luxury sedan
is a formidable competitor to the Mercedes-Benz

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:56.330
E350 Bluetec clean diesel sedan, with excellent
driving characteristics, and a superb level

00:03:56.330 --> 00:03:57.569
of comfort.

00:03:57.569 --> 00:04:01.180
Fuel economy is quite good for a vehicle of
this caliber.

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:05.120
Those willing to buy the ticket and take the
ride should have no qualms with ponying up

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:08.459
for premium fuel.
