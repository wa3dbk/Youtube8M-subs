00:00:00.749 --> 00:00:03.480
Let's knead a yeast dough today.

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:05.779
Bake a garlic rolls.

00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:08.180
They are also called Pampushki with garlic.

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:14.049
They are small, soft buns with garlic flavor and aroma.

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:19.419
To make the dough take 400 g of flour, 2 tbsp of vegetable oil, 250 ml of milk, 1 tbsp of sugar,

00:00:19.419 --> 00:00:26.980
0,5 tsp of salt, 1 tsp of dry yeast (or 30 g of compressed fresh yeast) and 1 egg.

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:30.869
For the stuffing take any greens (dill or parsley),

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.980
5-7 cloves of garlic and 30 g of butter.

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.890
Make the dough.

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:39.040
Take a large bowl.

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:44.960
Pour the milk here. You can use water.

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:54.700
Add vegetable oil and sugar.

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:01.770
Put on the fire and warm up to room temperature (25-30 C).

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:09.300
Stir to dissolve sugar.

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:14.210
Heat for about 1-1.5 minutes.

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:15.600
Check milk with a finger.

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:21.240
Milk is warm. If it is hot, it is better to leave it a little bit to cool.

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.900
The temperature should be about 30 C, like a room temperature.

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.100
Add yeast.

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.049
Mix a little.

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:35.080
Leave for 15-20 minutes.

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:39.500
Yeast is alive and rose a little.

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:45.000
Now add egg and sifted flour.

00:01:49.822 --> 00:01:55.800
Knead all together.

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:11.889
I forgot one more ingredient: it is necessary to add a pinch of salt.

00:02:11.889 --> 00:02:16.309
Add salt into the batter.

00:02:16.309 --> 00:02:23.000
Again, add the flour.

00:02:23.649 --> 00:02:29.119
We kneaded a soft and elastic dough that is slightly sticks to the hands.

00:02:29.119 --> 00:02:32.039
Form it in a ball.

00:02:32.039 --> 00:02:33.959
Put in a bowl.

00:02:33.959 --> 00:02:37.199
Cover with a lid.

00:02:37.199 --> 00:02:41.800
Cover with a towel and put in a warm place.

00:02:42.679 --> 00:02:45.299
It took 2 hours.

00:02:45.299 --> 00:02:49.249
Now we will form small rolls.

00:02:49.249 --> 00:02:54.699
Cover a baking sheet with parchment paper, or sprinkle with flour.

00:02:54.699 --> 00:02:58.599
Break away small pieces of dough.

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:03.569
The size of a small apple.

00:03:03.569 --> 00:03:06.409
Form a ball.

00:03:06.409 --> 00:03:11.900
Place on the baking sheet.

00:03:11.939 --> 00:03:19.900
Leave the rolls on baking sheet for 20 minutes.

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:29.639
I greased parchment paper with butter a little.

00:03:29.639 --> 00:03:32.159
Under each ball.

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:34.329
Now make the filling.

00:03:34.329 --> 00:03:42.829
Take garlic, dill.

00:03:42.829 --> 00:03:46.109
Butter.

00:03:46.109 --> 00:03:49.599
Melted.

00:03:49.599 --> 00:03:53.900
Stir and chop they together, mix with butter.

00:03:53.900 --> 00:04:03.800
I use mixer with multi-function blade.

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:11.459
Take a sharp knife.

00:04:11.459 --> 00:04:15.049
Make a longitudinal incision.

00:04:15.049 --> 00:04:19.419
Unfold.

00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:21.969
Place stuffing in center of each roll.

00:04:21.969 --> 00:04:29.000
About half of a teaspoon.

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:51.500
Grease top of the rolls with yolk.

00:04:59.509 --> 00:05:05.000
Bake rolls in a preheated 180 C oven.

00:05:05.659 --> 00:05:14.439
Bake about 20 minutes or until just golden brown. I checked - our garlic rolls are ready.

00:05:14.439 --> 00:05:18.320
Remove rolls from the oven and leave them a little bit to cool.

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:22.900
Such garlic rolls good served with first courses.

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:25.639
But best of all, they are combined with the borscht (a soup of Ukrainian origin).

00:05:25.639 --> 00:05:26.139
Cook with pleasure and enjoy!

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.000
