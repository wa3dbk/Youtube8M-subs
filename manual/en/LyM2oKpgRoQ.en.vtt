Take Action &amp; Improve Your Life - Importance
Of Taking Action - Stop Reading &amp; Start Doing

00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:02.440
Hi!

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:03.580
I'm Antonio Centeno, the founder of Real Men
Real Style.

00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:07.799
Today, I'm going to be talking with you about
the importance of taking action.

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:11.099
Okay, if you haven't already, please subscribe

you.

00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:16.500

And if you have something to add, you want
to get a message to me, I love seeing what

people write in the comments.

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:27.480
I only check out the most recent videos, so
if you're writing on this video and it's been

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.810
two years, it may be something I'd miss.

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.039
I get a lot of comments, but if you really
need to get a hold of me, feel free to contact

00:00:35.039 --> 00:00:38.190
me over at realmenrealstyle.com.

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:43.280
In addition, I've got hundreds of articles
over there, hundreds of videos, so do a quick

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.940
Google search and hopefully you'll be able
to find me providing a great answer to you.

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:52.109
Okay, so the importance of taking action.

00:00:52.109 --> 00:00:57.530
I can tell you a few years ago when I was
running my custom clothier and the idea of

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:04.290
Real Men Real Style was just something in
my head, it was hard to get started.

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:10.110
And I knew that getting on video, that showing
myself, that being a little bit vulnerable

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:14.600
because I'm not the best dressed guy, I don't
have a huge wardrobe, even though I'm a custom

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:20.010
clothier, it's kind of that saying, the cobbler's
kids are running around barefoot despite the

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:22.950
fact that he makes shoes, it's very similar.

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:29.240
I put all of my money back into my company
and it was something I -- even with a huge

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.380
discount, I'm very careful about even buying
my own clothing.

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:34.720
Things have changed quite a bit.

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:39.730
In the last couple of years, actually when
we started testing around Real Men Real Style,

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:43.680
I talked to Brett over at the Art of Manliness
about the idea and he said it'd be great.

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:48.300
He'd love to support me, so I started putting
information out there, testing it.

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:53.340
The next thing I know, we made a commitment
to do 100 videos in 100 days, and that turned

00:01:53.340 --> 00:02:00.820
into 200 videos in 200 days, and really that's
when the channel started to take off.

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:03.670
The blog itself started getting a lot more
views.

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:07.690
At the same time, I have to admit that it's
not like it just exploded.

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:12.231
I'm getting now a lot of people coming and
they're asking, "How can I repeat this?" or

00:02:12.231 --> 00:02:15.010
"How can I create a channel like this?"

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.121
The good thing is a lot of people are coming
in and wanting to advertise with us, work

00:02:18.121 --> 00:02:24.690
with us, partner with us, and that's all great,
but it happened because I took action.

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:33.420
I stopped reading and I stopped watching other
people do what I wanted to do and it's hard.

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:37.720
You've got to break away from the reading,
the studying, which is important.

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.360
Research is important, but up to a point.

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:41.770
You have to take action.

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:44.950
It's one of the reasons I started my style
system.

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:50.300
I knew that many men out there had been reading
forums for years.

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:55.110
They have read four or five books by Alan
Flusser or Bernhard Roetzel.

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:59.050
They've spent money on this, but what they
haven't done is they haven't put themselves

00:02:59.050 --> 00:03:05.370
in a step-by-step course that really makes
sure they execute on what they need to and

00:03:05.370 --> 00:03:09.860
learn exactly what they need to in the order
they need it, and it turns out that works

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:11.110
out really well.

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:15.380
So whatever you want to get done in life,
whether you want to build up a company, whether

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:20.630
you want to improve yourself, whether you
simply just want to ask that woman across

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:27.270
the way who you've been wanting to meet for
a year, just to go up and do it, introduce

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:33.230
yourself, say "hi", talk to her, or if it's
a company, stay up all night, pull an all-nighter

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:35.819
and get that company going.

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:40.600
Quit finding excuses and take action.

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:47.180
I have to admit, I don't like it whenever
trolls come in and they say something bad

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:48.360
about me.

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:53.270
I get emails occasionally back on my email
list and people just telling me not very nice

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:58.280
things, and I have to admit, I see that stuff
and it definitely brings you down.

00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:03.480
Even if it's like one out of a hundred, one
out of a thousand, we're human beings and

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:06.931
we feel, but you've got to realize -- these
are three things I've realized.

00:04:06.931 --> 00:04:13.100
I've realized I'm going to fail and anything
I've ever done in life, I have failed multiple

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:19.460
times trying to get to it whether it was in
the Marine Corps, whether it was sports growing

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:20.460
up.

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:24.449
I always had points in which I was failing
because if you're not failing, if you're not

00:04:24.449 --> 00:04:28.990
willing to fail, you're not willing to push
yourself to the utmost breaking point.

00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:33.250
So realize that if you really want to do something,
if you want to take action, there are going

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:34.780
to be points of failure.

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:40.980
You've also got to realize you're probably
going to be attacked and they're not attacking

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:42.030
you.

00:04:42.030 --> 00:04:44.100
It's a reflection of who they are.

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:49.780
They're tearing you down because they're either
a bit jealous or they are kind of kicking

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:53.220
themselves that they should be doing it and
they don't want to see you do it.

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:58.080
A lot of people believe that if they pull
you down that they are going to feel better

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:59.190
about themselves.

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:01.470
Really that's not the way it should be, gentlemen.

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:06.900
Try to be somebody who is a level up and is
reaching down to pull others up with you,

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:09.000
but realize you're going to be attacked.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.440
You've got to develop a little bit of tougher
skin when you take action.

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:15.690
Also, you're going to be lost at times.

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:17.770
You're not going to know where you're going.

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:18.770
You're going to be out there.

00:05:18.770 --> 00:05:20.000
You're going to feel very exposed.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.960
You're going to think everyone's looking at
you, that people are going to critique you

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:26.810
and point out that you are a fraud.

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:31.020
You're going to be lost, so those three things,
gentlemen, understand it's going to happen.

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:32.020
You're going to fail.

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:33.020
You're going to be attacked.

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:34.020
You're going to be lost.

00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:38.100
But if you can accept that and if you say
the worst that's going to happen is I'm going

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:44.410
to fail, I'm going to be left there, you're
going to find if you can put up with that

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:50.990
and if you start taking action, if you are
consistent, if you're steady, and if you seek

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:56.040
constant personal improvement, not being the
best, not comparing yourself against others,

00:05:56.040 --> 00:06:01.229
but looking to improve yourself a little bit
each day, if you can do that, you're going

00:06:01.229 --> 00:06:05.490
to start to see amazing things happen.

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:11.220
I felt really good this last trip I took to
Vegas and I was at New Media Expo, and I was

00:06:11.220 --> 00:06:14.940
meeting people outside my industry.

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:18.191
We'd meet, we'd exchange cards, and then actually
a little bit later in the conference, they'd

00:06:18.191 --> 00:06:19.740
come up to me and say, "Wow!

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:21.040
I just checked out your website.

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:22.570
I saw what you're doing.

00:06:22.570 --> 00:06:23.570
That's amazing!

00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:24.600
How did you do it?"

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:29.340
I'm just kind of laughing because that's a
whole lot of work.

00:06:29.340 --> 00:06:31.370
A lot of people think that it happens overnight.

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:34.259
Now, people are looking for that quick fix;
it's not.

00:06:34.259 --> 00:06:39.759
You've got to be able to take action and know
that you're going to run into failure, and

00:06:39.759 --> 00:06:42.310
be steady, consistent.

00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:46.560
We do this in college and we need to be continue
doing this throughout life, gentlemen.

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:51.220
We do this up through school and it's something
that I think a lot of us lose whenever we

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:54.620
get out because we're putting this unstructured
environment.

00:06:54.620 --> 00:06:55.660
Create structure for yourself.

00:06:55.660 --> 00:07:01.110
One of the things I did is hire a business
coach and she makes sure that I do stay on

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:06.490
path to the path where I'm headed, but once
you do it, gentlemen, amazing things happen.

00:07:06.490 --> 00:07:10.680
So I want to thank you all for being big supporters
of my channel.

00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:16.330
We just passed three million views and this
is going to go faster and it's going to grow

00:07:16.330 --> 00:07:17.330
bigger.

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:21.500
We're coming in on 40,000 subscribers, so
that’s pretty awesome.

00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:24.289
And I can tell you that my style system sold
out.

00:07:24.289 --> 00:07:26.800
I filled all 100 seats.

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:32.080
I was amazed, and the quality of the guys
in there, it just keeps getting better and

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:40.289
better, so thank you for helping me and for
making this channel and my business a go.

00:07:40.289 --> 00:07:45.400
What I would just like to offer to you is
a little bit maybe of inspiration that if

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:51.110
you take consistent action in the right direction,
yes, you're going to fall back occasionally,

00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:53.090
but you're going to take two steps forward
and fall back.

00:07:53.090 --> 00:07:57.669
And over time, you're going to see amazing
things happen.

00:07:57.669 --> 00:08:00.130
Okay guys, thank you for being a part of this.

00:08:00.130 --> 00:08:01.130
I'll see you in the next video.

00:08:01.130 --> 00:08:01.160
Bye-bye.
