Welcome to Draw Tip Tuesday!

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:13.790
We all love our art tools, don’t we? I always
carry an art journal and a sketch bag with

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:20.790
me, and the contents of the bag change very
often. This is what’s currently in it. 

00:00:20.930 --> 00:00:26.490
And since they are so important to me, these art
tools are totally worth drawing!

00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:32.890
I’ll pick… my rollerball pen, which is
water resistant, so I can add watercolors

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:39.100
to my drawing later. And because I am drawing with it, 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.500
you’ll see that I forget to draw the pen. Oh well.

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.360
Pick up your favorite sketch tools and draw
them too!

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:51.399
Draw all the items, dividing them on your
page. You can take as much time as you need,

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:56.460
perhaps you’d like to make an elaborate
drawing and draw realistically. Or you may

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.980
want to practice your hatching and cross hatching
- drawing a page like this gives you a great

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:08.980
exercise opportunity for that. I keep it fairly simple,
so I can fit it into my Draw Tip Tuesday minutes.

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:18.390
You can leave a bit of white, to add lettering,
if you like. Write what you want to say about

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:25.390
your page in your own hand writing, or experiment
with lettering, use alphabet stamps or templates.

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:31.940
Whatever fits your needs.
I am writing my text, and then adding some

00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:37.980
more thickness to my letters - again, because
of the limited time I have,

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:43.200
 I don’t go toomuch into detail and neatness.
Think about that when you keep an art journal:

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:49.890
You CAN draw every day, it’s just that some
days you will have more time than other days.

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:55.230
Be smart with your time. You can get a lot
done in just small pockets of time in your day!

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:57.540
 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:03.870
I am using the watercolors from my sketch
bag to quickly give my drawing some color.

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:10.870
I make sure to leave some whites for highlights,
and then my drawing is done.

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:21.560
Are you addicted to art tools, just like me?
Well, you better use them 

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:29.000
and make awesomeart. If you like this video, you may want to check out my website
