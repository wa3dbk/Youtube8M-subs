00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:04.270
Today we are going to review part number A90095
from SportRack.

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:06.360
This is their roof cargo carrier.

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:09.470
First off, you can get in the cargo box from
the passenger side of the vehicle.

00:00:09.470 --> 00:00:15.269
It has two locks to secure that side of the
lid, and it also has spring loaded hinges

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.760
to help you pop up the lid, sometimes it is
going to be a little high above your head

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:20.490
and you will need a little help pushing it
up.

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.840
It has foam weather stripping around the edge
perimeter of the lid itself and the bottom

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:27.720
so it keeps everything nice and dry on the
inside.

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:31.439
:28
It uses 4 u-bolts and plates combination to

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:52.010
secure this cargo box to your roof rack, rather
its the Thule rack, round 

00:00:52.010 --> 00:01:28.079
bar rack, or factory roof rack as we are going
to 

00:01:28.079 --> 00:01:42.149
use 
in 

00:01:42.149 --> 00:01:45.029
this review.

00:01:45.029 --> 00:02:15.650
It is also constructed of high-density polyethylene
construction, is UV resistant, durable, and

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:35.700
is made in the USA.

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:38.840
