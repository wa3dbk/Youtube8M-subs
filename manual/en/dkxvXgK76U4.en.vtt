00:00:00.669 --> 00:00:04.410
today i'm going to show you windows
seven god mode

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:09.750
now what this is, is basically taking all of
your control panel items and adding more

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:12.069
options in ah

00:00:12.069 --> 00:00:16.909
features to play around with in one
folder

00:00:16.909 --> 00:00:19.680
now if you don't want this

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.859
folder you can always delete it afterwards

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.529
um but it is a simple trick and it combines
all of your

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:31.869
options and settings into one folder if
you're a windows seven

00:00:31.869 --> 00:00:36.550
this does not work on windows vista or
windows xp

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:41.500
uh... and it may or may not work on
windows eight when it is released

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.710
ah sometime next year

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:48.040
so uh... what you're gonna do here is

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.910
click on this folder on the task bar

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:52.430
uhm...

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:57.030
and it says windows explorer

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.780
whatcha gonna do next is click local
disk c 'cause that's the hard drive

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:03.270
you're on now

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.189
uhm...

00:01:06.189 --> 00:01:09.860
and what you're going to do is
right click in a blank area

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:14.950
scroll down to folder to new and go to
folder

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:18.930
and what you're going to do is 
rename the new folder

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:20.830
this string

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:22.010
now

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:24.400
i'll put that in the video description

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:29.360
so you can see it their 'cause right now
would be very hard to

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:30.660
memorize and

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:33.780
do yourself

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:39.430
so it's pretty simple isn't it
you'll notice how it's no longer a folder icon

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:45.340
now you're going to want to open it

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:48.200
and you can see here

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:54.220
that there's a lot of shortcuts to
settings and explanations

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:56.630
as to what they are

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:01.869
uh... so you can tell this not for novice user
and i wasn't joking earlier

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:06.310
uh... there's a lot of action center

akamai netsession interface that

00:03:31.419 --> 00:03:33.039
was installed

for whatever reason

00:03:34.739 --> 00:03:37.099
uhm...

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:39.369
so yes these are shortcuts

00:03:39.369 --> 00:03:41.470
to uh... several

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:44.519
different uh...

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:49.239
sections out of your computer mainly
your control panel but there are few

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:50.909
extras in there

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:53.299
so this is not for people who

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:54.929
uh...

00:03:54.929 --> 00:04:00.129
do not know what they're doing with the
computer

00:04:00.129 --> 00:04:02.989
so there you go there is the folder

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:05.939
now if you want to get rid of it it's
not

00:04:05.939 --> 00:04:08.829
going to do anything wrong um...

00:04:08.829 --> 00:04:12.459
negative to your computer alls you do is right

00:04:12.459 --> 00:04:13.549

and you go yes

00:04:17.019 --> 00:04:18.459
