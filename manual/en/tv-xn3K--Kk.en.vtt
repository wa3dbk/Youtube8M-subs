00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:03.409
Speaker 1: First exercise.

00:00:03.409 --> 00:00:04.409
It's going to be a little funny.

00:00:04.409 --> 00:00:05.950
None of you guys have probably done this before.

00:00:05.950 --> 00:00:15.259
It's going to be a one-legged bound.

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:17.210
You're going to take this leg here.

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:19.770
This is the one we're going to use, so if
I'm jumping on my right foot I'm going to

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:20.770
get here.

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:32.610
You're going to circle your left hip so as
the knees drives up, rather than doing this,

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.930
feeling like a fool, we're going to become
more explosive.

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:37.520
You're going to use this leg to drive up and
it's going to help with your legs, going to

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:38.520
help with your vertical.

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:39.520
You're going to get here...

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:40.520
Speaker 2: There you go.

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:41.520
Good.

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:42.520
Get it up.

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:43.520
Use your arms.

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:44.520
Push up.

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:45.520
There you go.

00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:46.520
Good.

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:47.520
Good hop.

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:48.520
Speaker 1: Relax in.

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:49.520
In a full [inaudible 00:00:53] set take a
deep breath.

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:50.520
Got to have fresh legs here.

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:51.520
We're going to three sets on each side.

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:54.329
Remember, use your arms to get up as high
as you can.

00:00:54.329 --> 00:01:00.290
You got to use your body.

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:01.290
If I'm here...

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:02.290
Speaker 2: Shoulders...

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:03.290
Speaker 1: Three sets.

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:04.290
First one's about ten seconds.

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.290
Everything you got.

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:06.290
Speaker 2: Get it up!

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:07.290
Get it up!

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:08.290
Come on!

00:01:08.290 --> 00:01:09.290
Balance!

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:10.290
Come on George get it up!

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:11.290
Get your legs higher!

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:12.290
Come on.

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:13.290
Let's go.

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:14.290
Get it up!

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:15.290
Come on!

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:16.290
There you go.

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:17.290
Wow!

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:18.290
Speaker 1: Relax in.

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:19.290
Don't cut me short now.

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:20.290
Don't cut me short.

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:21.290
Those last two breathes you got to keep moving.

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:22.290
Deep breaths.

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:23.290
Deep breaths.

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:24.290
I need you to explode.

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:25.290
Make sure you're driving the knee up.

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:28.460
If this was you, not going to get a higher
vertical.

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:29.460
Get this knee up the same.

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:30.460
It's the same thing as a layup.

00:01:30.460 --> 00:01:34.409
When you shoot a layup, that knee drives you
up, right?

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:35.409
Get your leg up.

00:01:35.409 --> 00:01:36.409
Second set, ready.

00:01:36.409 --> 00:01:37.409
Speaker 2: Get it up!

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:38.409
Use your arms!

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:39.409
Show me your arms!

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:40.409
[Inaudible 00:01:55] Shoulder strength, legs,
hips, knees...

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:41.409
Speaker 1: Relax in!

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:42.409
Feel the rhythm in your body.

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:43.409
You guys get here.

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:44.409
See how my arms are circling?

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:45.409
Circle, circle, circle.

00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:47.409
Remember, every rep, you got to get off the
ground as fast as you can.

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:51.829
Stretch reflex is what it's called.

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:59.940
You got to get off, off the ground.

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:00.940
Don't take a long time.

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:01.940
Don't do this number.

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:02.940
Not going to get any higher.

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:03.940
Ready, last set on that leg.

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:04.940
[Inaudible 00:02:23]
Speaker 2: Come on!

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:08.989
If you want to be the best, you have to train
like the best!

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:11.250
You'll play like the best!

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.610
Get them up Logan!

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:14.610
Get them wide!

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:15.610
Come on Logan.

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:16.610
This is your year.

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:17.610
[Inaudible 00:02:36]
Speaker 1: Hands up high if you're giving

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:18.610
max effort.

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:19.610
Everybody's hands should be high.

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:20.610
Take pride in the way you work.

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.540
Take pride in how hard you train.

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:40.319
If you want to get better, you have to push
yourself.

00:02:40.319 --> 00:02:50.130
[Inaudible 00:02:52]
Speaker 1: You should feel funny.

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:59.849
This is an odd drill but guess what?

00:02:59.849 --> 00:03:00.849
It's going to make you feel more explosive.

00:03:00.849 --> 00:03:01.849
It's building your hips.

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:02.849
It's building your core.

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:04.980
It's building your jumping abilities.

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.900
Swing your arms.

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.819
High, high, high.

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:13.739
There you go.

00:03:13.739 --> 00:03:16.769
All right, this is going to be another good
piece.

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:17.769
We're going with the tuck jump.

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:18.769
This is great for your vertical.

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:19.769
This is great for your hips.

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:20.769
We're using the bands so when you jump you're
going to build your hips the whole time, one

00:03:20.769 --> 00:03:21.769
of your most important muscles when it comes
to vertical.

00:03:21.769 --> 00:03:22.769
Who knows what a tuck jump is?

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:23.769
Tuck jump looks like this.

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:24.769
Speaker 2: Jump!

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:25.769
Get your knees up!

00:03:25.769 --> 00:03:26.769
Get your hips working!

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:27.769
Speaker 1: One!

00:03:27.769 --> 00:03:28.769
Get up, get up, get up!

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:29.769
Two!

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:30.769
Relax in!

00:03:30.769 --> 00:03:31.769
Can you jump high without using your arms?

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:32.769
No.

00:03:32.769 --> 00:03:33.769
Get your arms out and around so when you go
up get these arms out and ready to go again.

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:34.769
Speaker 2: Quick!

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:35.769
Quick!

00:03:35.769 --> 00:03:36.769
Everything is quick!

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:40.630
Get those arms up!

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:41.739
Go!

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:46.150
Get those arms wide!

00:03:46.150 --> 00:03:48.350
Let's go!

00:03:48.350 --> 00:03:51.660
Get them up!

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:53.420
Get your base wide!

00:03:53.420 --> 00:03:54.560
Speaker 1: One hundred percent effort.

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:55.930
One hundred percent effort will make you jump
higher.

00:03:55.930 --> 00:03:56.930
Speaker 2: Knees straight!

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:57.930
Knees straight!

00:03:57.930 --> 00:03:58.930
Get them up, Logan!

00:03:58.930 --> 00:03:59.930
Come on!

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:00.930
Speaker 1: Three!

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:01.930
Two!

00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:02.930
One!

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:02.938
