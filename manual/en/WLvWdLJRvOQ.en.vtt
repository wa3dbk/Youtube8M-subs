Thank you, my name is Lucila Velez, with Lucila
Dance Productions. I'm going to demonstrate

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:12.570
a diamond step, and we're going to be doing
with the music of Akmar Garcia New Oasis.

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:18.780
The diamond step is a step that you can utilize
it in any of your dance moves, it's originally

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:26.039
mainly jazzy, it's a more jazzy step, and
it's a four count, we go front with your right,

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:31.380
side with your left, back with your right,
cross to your right with your left. So what

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:37.710
you do is a diamond figure with your foot
work; so you go front with your right, side

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:47.640
with your left, back with your right, left
cross with your left. Your body is in a little

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:55.000
play, in a small play, your arms are away
from your body, left in front, right, away;

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:02.070
so we go front one, out two, with your left,
back with your right, and cross with your

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:06.970
left; when you go across with your left, your
arms will be in the opposite direction, so

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:13.110
right up in front of your chest, and left
away from your body, so you go front play,

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:28.460
side, back, and front; and 1, and 2, and back,
and front; and front, side, back, front; 1,2,3,4;

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:36.420
and front with your right, again, side with
your left, back with your right, side with

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:52.810
