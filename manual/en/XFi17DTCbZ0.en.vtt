00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:03.066
The President:
Good afternoon, everyone.

00:00:03.066 --> 00:00:07.200
When I took office, our nation
was engaged in two wars,

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.633
and al Qaeda was entrenched
in their safe havens.

00:00:10.633 --> 00:00:12.300
Many of our alliances
were frayed,

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.166
and America's standing in
the world had suffered.

00:00:14.166 --> 00:00:19.066
Over the past four years,
we've begun a new era of

00:00:19.066 --> 00:00:20.900
American leadership.

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:25.100
We ended the war in Iraq, put
the al Qaeda core on the path to

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:29.467
defeat, and we're winding
down the war in Afghanistan.

00:00:29.467 --> 00:00:32.333
We've strengthened our
alliances, including in Asia;

00:00:32.333 --> 00:00:35.133
forged new coalitions to
meet global challenges;

00:00:35.133 --> 00:00:38.800
and stood up for human dignity,
from North Africa to the Middle

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.667
East to Burma.

00:00:40.667 --> 00:00:42.900
We still, of course,
face great challenges.

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:46.700
But today, I can say with pride
that the United States is safer,

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:50.533
stronger and more
respected in the world.

00:00:50.533 --> 00:00:53.867
In this work, I've been grateful
for an extraordinary national

00:00:53.867 --> 00:00:55.767
security team.

00:00:55.767 --> 00:00:59.433
Tom Donilon has been a part of
that, and I'm grateful to him.

00:00:59.433 --> 00:01:03.467
Of course, one of the most
important people in this whole

00:01:03.467 --> 00:01:07.934
transformation has been our
outstanding Secretary of State,

00:01:07.934 --> 00:01:11.233
my friend, Secretary
Hillary Clinton.

00:01:11.233 --> 00:01:14.000
Hillary wanted very
much to be here today,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.700
but she continues to recuperate.

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.934
I had a chance to talk
to her earlier today,

00:01:18.934 --> 00:01:24.367
and she is in good spirits and
could not be more excited about

00:01:24.367 --> 00:01:26.834
the announcement
that I'm making.

00:01:26.834 --> 00:01:29.867
Over the last four years,
Hillary has been everywhere --

00:01:29.867 --> 00:01:32.133
both in terms of her travels,
which have seen her represent

00:01:32.133 --> 00:01:35.266
America in more countries than
any previous Secretary of State,

00:01:35.266 --> 00:01:38.834
and through her tireless work to
restore our global leadership.

00:01:38.834 --> 00:01:41.500
And she's looking forward
to getting back to work,

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:44.033
and I am looking forward
to paying tribute to her

00:01:44.033 --> 00:01:47.767
extraordinary service
in the days to come.

00:01:47.767 --> 00:01:50.967
Today, though, I'm looking
ahead to my second term,

00:01:50.967 --> 00:01:53.934
and I am very proud to announce
my choice for America's next

00:01:53.934 --> 00:01:57.900
Secretary of State
-- John Kerry.

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:02.033
In a sense, John's entire life
has prepared him for this role.

00:02:02.033 --> 00:02:04.800
As the son of a Foreign
Service officer,

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:08.166
he has a deep respect for the
men and women of the State

00:02:08.166 --> 00:02:10.867
Department -- the role they play
in advancing our interests and

00:02:10.867 --> 00:02:15.000
values, the risks that they
undertake and the sacrifices

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.033
that they make along
with their families.

00:02:18.033 --> 00:02:20.533
Having served with
valor in Vietnam,

00:02:20.533 --> 00:02:24.300
he understands that we have a
responsibility to use American

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:28.633
power wisely, especially
our military power.

00:02:28.633 --> 00:02:30.433
And he knows, from
personal experience,

00:02:30.433 --> 00:02:33.066
that when we send our
troops into harm's way,

00:02:33.066 --> 00:02:37.033
we must give them the sound
strategy, a clear mission,

00:02:37.033 --> 00:02:40.867
and the resources that they
need to get the job done.

00:02:40.867 --> 00:02:44.000
In an extraordinarily
distinguished Senate career --

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.367
and as chairman of the Foreign
Relations Committee --

00:02:46.367 --> 00:02:49.633
John has played a central role
in every major foreign policy

00:02:49.633 --> 00:02:52.567
debate for nearly 30 years.

00:02:52.567 --> 00:02:55.233
As we turn the page
on a decade of war,

00:02:55.233 --> 00:02:58.033
he understands that we've got to
harness all elements of American

00:02:58.033 --> 00:03:01.266
power and ensure that
they're working together --

00:03:01.266 --> 00:03:05.667
diplomatic and development,
economic and political,

00:03:05.667 --> 00:03:09.033
military and intelligence -- as
well as the power of our values

00:03:09.033 --> 00:03:12.633
which inspire so many
people around the world.

00:03:12.633 --> 00:03:15.633
As John has said, we are an
exceptional nation "not because

00:03:15.633 --> 00:03:19.967
we say we are, but because
we do exceptional things."

00:03:19.967 --> 00:03:22.533
And I'd say that one of the more
exceptional things we've seen in

00:03:22.533 --> 00:03:25.600
recent decades was when
John helped lead the way,

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:28.233
along with folks like
John McCain and others,

00:03:28.233 --> 00:03:31.066
to restore our diplomatic
ties with Vietnam.

00:03:31.066 --> 00:03:34.533
And when he returned to the
country where he and so many

00:03:34.533 --> 00:03:38.834
others had fought so long ago,
it sent a powerful message of

00:03:38.834 --> 00:03:41.700
progress and of healing.

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:43.767
Over these many years, John
has earned the respect and

00:03:43.767 --> 00:03:47.100
confidence of leaders
around the world.

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:50.367
He is not going to need a
lot of on-the-job training.

00:03:50.367 --> 00:03:53.867
He has earned the respect and
trust of his Senate colleagues,

00:03:53.867 --> 00:03:55.967
Democrats and Republicans.

00:03:55.967 --> 00:03:59.400
I think it's fair to say that
few individuals know as many

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:03.700
presidents and prime ministers,
or grasp our foreign policies as

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:05.400
firmly as John Kerry.

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.433
And this makes him a perfect
choice to guide American

00:04:08.433 --> 00:04:09.734
diplomacy in the years ahead.

00:04:09.734 --> 00:04:14.467
On a personal level, John
has been a great friend.

00:04:14.467 --> 00:04:17.700
I've appreciated John's
partnership in helping to

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:20.767
advance so many of my
foreign policy priorities,

00:04:20.767 --> 00:04:23.867
including the ratification
of the New START Treaty.

00:04:23.867 --> 00:04:26.600
I've called on his talents and
diplomatic skills on several

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:31.800
occasions, on complex challenges
from Sudan and South Sudan to

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.200
the situation in Afghanistan.

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:36.266
And each time he
has been exemplary.

00:04:36.266 --> 00:04:41.400
Of course, I also have to say
thanks because John invited a

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:43.900
young Illinois state senator
to address the Democratic

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:45.767
Convention in Boston.

00:04:45.767 --> 00:04:51.433
I was proud to serve with him on
the Foreign Relations Committee

00:04:51.433 --> 00:04:53.567
under the tutelage
of Joe Biden --

00:04:53.567 --> 00:04:54.500
(laughter)

00:04:54.500 --> 00:04:58.600
-- and where we
all became friends.

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:03.400
But of course nothing brings
two people closer together than

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:04.700
weeks of debate prep.

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:06.667
(laughter)

00:05:06.667 --> 00:05:09.333
John, I'm looking forward to
working with you instead of

00:05:09.333 --> 00:05:10.166
debating you.

00:05:10.166 --> 00:05:11.500
(laughter)

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:14.033
Finally, I want to thank Teresa.

00:05:14.033 --> 00:05:16.834
As someone who came to this
country as an immigrant,

00:05:16.834 --> 00:05:19.800
she understands the shining
values that America represents

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:21.133
to the world.

00:05:21.133 --> 00:05:23.867
As a former interpreter
at the United Nations,

00:05:23.867 --> 00:05:26.867
she appreciates how our
interests can be advanced in

00:05:26.867 --> 00:05:28.734
partnership with others.

00:05:28.734 --> 00:05:32.066
Teresa, thank you so much for
being John's partner in this

00:05:32.066 --> 00:05:34.367
next endeavor.

00:05:34.367 --> 00:05:39.767
I have to say I think I speak
for John and Joe and myself --

00:05:39.767 --> 00:05:42.734
we just left Danny
Inouye's funeral,

00:05:42.734 --> 00:05:47.300
a man who exemplified the
very best of the U.S.

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:48.500
Senate tradition.

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:52.166
And so, I know that, John, it
won't be easy to leave the

00:05:52.166 --> 00:05:56.033
Senate that you love.

00:05:56.033 --> 00:05:58.533
And I think it's fair to say
that there are going to be some

00:05:58.533 --> 00:06:00.467
great challenges ahead.

00:06:00.467 --> 00:06:04.266
An uncertain world will
continue to test our nation.

00:06:04.266 --> 00:06:07.166
But even with all the
challenges that we face,

00:06:07.166 --> 00:06:11.066
I have never been more
confident, more optimistic,

00:06:11.066 --> 00:06:14.100
that if we act with
wisdom and with purpose,

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:17.033
and if we're guided
by our values,

00:06:17.033 --> 00:06:21.734
and we remind what binds
us together as Americans,

00:06:21.734 --> 00:06:26.767
the United States will continue
to lead in this world for

00:06:26.767 --> 00:06:28.300
our lifetimes.

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:30.500
So, John, I am very grateful
that you've agreed to take on

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:31.867
this new assignment.

00:06:31.867 --> 00:06:37.033
I'm confident that the Senate
will confirm you quickly.

00:06:37.033 --> 00:06:40.533
I guess you won't be able to
actually appear and preside at

00:06:40.533 --> 00:06:41.533
the same time --

00:06:41.533 --> 00:06:42.533
(laughter)

00:06:42.533 --> 00:06:44.467
-- so we'll have to
figure out how that works,

00:06:44.467 --> 00:06:46.567
but I know that you are
going to be an outstanding

00:06:46.567 --> 00:06:48.333
Secretary of State.

00:06:48.333 --> 00:06:49.567
Thank you so much.

00:06:49.567 --> 00:06:50.533
Congratulations.

00:06:50.533 --> 00:06:56.300
(applause)
