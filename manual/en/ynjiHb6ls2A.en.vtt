Hi, my name is Leslie Moselle. I'm from Tampa,
Florida and on behalf of Expert Village this

00:00:05.779 --> 00:00:11.700
is how to do laundry. First thing you want
to do when doing your laundry is to first

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.600
familiarized yourself with the settings of
your washer and dryer. All washers and dryers

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:23.570
has the same basic setting but some offer
you more options. With this washer you want

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:29.160
to begin by your water level. The water level
is the same thing as the size of your load.

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:35.379
So with this washer you have the choices;
mini, medium, large, and over size. This would

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:40.100
determine how much water is actually in the
washer when you are washing a load of laundry.

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:48.679
Of course if it is a small load you would
have it on mini and so forth. Your next settings

00:00:48.679 --> 00:00:56.559
are your water temperature as you can see
here there is hot, warm, warm-cold, and cold.

00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:00.920
Depending on the load of laundry you would
change your water settings, your temperature

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:07.469
settings accordingly. If you have whites you
would put it on hot. If you have colors you

00:01:07.469 --> 00:01:16.130
would have it on warm or cold depending on
delicates or just regular colors. Your next

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:22.600
settings on your washer are the type of loads.
As you can see here there is wrinkle free

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:29.270
fabrics, delicates, and regular. Regular loads
would be used for your towels, your rugs,

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:36.300
your whites, and some colors. Delicates would
be used for your delicate clothing like your

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:43.249
silks and your delicate fabrics and you have
your wrinkle free fabrics. You also want to

00:01:43.249 --> 00:01:47.700
check the settings of your dryer. As you can
see here there are a few options to choose

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:52.820
from when drying your clothings. These are
important to remember you have your time drying,

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:56.969
gives you up to an hour and this would help
you control how long you want your clothes

00:01:56.969 --> 00:02:01.799
inside the dryer. Depending on how wet they
are. You also have your auto dryer which is

00:02:01.799 --> 00:02:07.469
not timed and you have the choose between
high heat and low heat. As you can see here

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:13.830
it lets you know that high heat is good for
towels if you need a lot of energy to dry

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:18.780
this particular type of clothing. You also
have your low heat which is for your clothing

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:23.750
that may not be as dry or more delicate and
you don't want to apply a bunch of heat. You

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:28.140
also have to remember with some of these dryers
they also have the option of signaling when

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:33.560
your load is dry that way your laundry does
not sit in the dryer for a long periods of

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:33.830
time.
