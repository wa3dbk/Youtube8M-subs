00:00:01.510 --> 00:00:02.510
Hi.

00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:04.430
Iím Antonio Centeno, the founder of Real

and youíre going to see I link you to some

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:33.960
So letís go ahead and talk about this.

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.379
What goes into a manís wallet?

00:00:35.379 --> 00:00:40.550
This came about because I put up another article
talking about different types of wallets and

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:45.089
then I think there are a few people that emailed
me and they were questioning about ìOkay,

00:00:45.089 --> 00:00:49.460
well what do you carry on my wallet?î So
let me go ahead and break down my wallet and

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:55.129
this is probably what I carry about half of
the time and itís really ñ itís pretty

00:00:55.129 --> 00:00:56.129
simple.

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:08.440
I carry my identification so my Wisconsinís
driverís license, two credit cards.

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:17.010
I also carry Beans and Books; itís my favorite
coffee store and my Roundys rewards card.

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:18.010
Yup, thatís right.

00:01:18.010 --> 00:01:21.780
I get discounts when I go to the grocery store.

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.640
And I always carry about $100 cash.

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:29.770
I think even though we live in a society where
you can go without cash, cash is still king

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:33.890
in certain little areas and you just need
to have and always have a little bit of small

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:34.890
change.

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:35.890
Have a few ones.

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:38.380
Have some fives just in case you need to tip
somebody.

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:43.880
The last one and thatís something that kind
of surprised me that I donít think many people

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:48.380
ñ I mean, think about, I always carry an
emergency set of five business cards and I

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:53.770
keep them in this little black pouch to protect,
to keep them from getting rough edges but

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:57.340
I always just keep about five cards in there
and I go through and I replenish that whenever

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:02.229
it needs it but my whole reasoning is that
you never know and when I go to the networking

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:06.530
events, Iím always wearing a sports jacket
so actually I keep business cards in one of

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:11.269
my inside pockets so Iíve always go back
up business cards there but I find that so

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:14.459
many times youíre going to met somebody and
you never expect that this person could be

00:02:14.459 --> 00:02:19.650
someone that could really introduce you to
somebody or this could be a great potential

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:24.630
business partner or perhaps youíre interested
in following up with this person because youíre

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:25.950
physically attracted to them.

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.700
You want to have a business card.

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:33.400
You want to have some way to stay in touch
and so I canít stress that enough.

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:34.489
Always have a business card.

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:36.549
Well, you may be saying, ìI donít have my
own business.

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:40.769
Why do I need a business card?î Well, get
a calling card put together and Iíll link

00:02:40.769 --> 00:02:43.799
you down below to the Art of Manliness and
they talk about calling cards.

00:02:43.799 --> 00:02:48.930
I think itís a very classy way to introduce
yourself and to have something that you can

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:52.610
remind somebody of who you are and what you
stand for.

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:55.310
Itís something unique and itís about standing
out.

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:57.560
Okay, getting back to wallets.

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:02.400
Where do I carry the ñ other half of the
time, I use the money clip and money clips

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:05.279
are really nice because I donít have to have
anything on my back pocket.

00:03:05.279 --> 00:03:07.269
As you can see, this one is really small.

00:03:07.269 --> 00:03:12.590
Itís got my Texas Longhorns on it but that
right there, I use the other half.

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:14.169
I can put that in my front pocket.

00:03:14.169 --> 00:03:17.499
When I wear a suit, I never have a wallet
in my back pocket.

00:03:17.499 --> 00:03:22.109
I just think it looks bad and in fact, a lot
of my trousers, any of the ones I had made

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:26.239
in the last couple years, there are no back
pockets so it canít even attempt it.

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:30.900
I also like ñ I feel because as if pickpocket
concerns, I like to have hidden pockets so

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:35.569
actually in my trousers, Iíve got hidden
pockets as well that a pickpocket would be

00:03:35.569 --> 00:03:41.560
very ñ heíd have to be very intimate I guess
in trying to find those but the other 5% of

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.040
the time, Iíve got other specialty wallets.

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:48.159
This is a passport wallet that I use whenever
Iím traveling in a suit.

00:03:48.159 --> 00:03:52.489
If Iím not traveling in a suit and Iím traveling
with my family, Iíve got this bigger wallet

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:54.359
that I use.

00:03:54.359 --> 00:04:02.269
When it comes down to it, I always think less
is more so more than 99.9% of the time, I

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:05.749
do not need those big wallets.

00:04:05.749 --> 00:04:09.999
If youíve got a big wallet, youíre going
to fill that thing so always go for the smallest

00:04:09.999 --> 00:04:15.139
wallet because youíre going to find a lot
of times ñ a lot of guys carry things they

00:04:15.139 --> 00:04:17.190
do not need to be carrying.

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:20.350
Your social security card, you do not need
to be carrying that.

00:04:20.350 --> 00:04:26.070
How often are you applying for a job or do
you need ñ have a copy of it ñ donít even

00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:27.750
have a copy of it.

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:33.970
Scan it and have it on your iPhone and Iíve
got this on Dropbox and so I can always access

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:38.590
my stuff but do not carry your original social
security card number.

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:42.720
Do not carry expired credit cards or you donít
really need ñ why do you need more than two

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:43.870
credit cards?

00:04:43.870 --> 00:04:48.840
I mean if you got a JC Pennyís cards, if
youíve got a card, if youíve got a gas card,

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:52.930
all of these, you need to ask yourself, ìWell,
do I need to be carrying them in my wallet?

00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:58.250
Can I get that gas card?î and if you use
that gas card, ìCan I just put that in my

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:01.950
vehicle and keep it stored in my glove compartment.

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:06.820
So always look to keep a small wallet and
get rid of anything you donít need to be

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:13.350
carrying and guys, get rid of that condom
thatís been in your wallet for five years.

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:18.000
If you do happen to use it, itís not going
to be very safe because that thing probably

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.160
is all torn up and has holes in it.

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:23.220
All right guys, so thatís what I carry in
my wallet.

00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:25.130
