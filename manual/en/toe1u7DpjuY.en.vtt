Mr. Potter!
Mr. Potter. The boy who lived. What a curious

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:20.180
thing to be remembered for.
Bellatrix. What are you doing here?

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:25.680
Making sure everybody remembers you as the
boy who died. Avadakedavra!

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.000
Expelliarmus!

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.080
Hahaha. It appears that one of us is disarmed.

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:51.039
Your spells won't work on me, Bellatrix!
Really? You knocked the wand out of my hand?

00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:56.320
That's your big victory?
Yeah, let's see you cast spells now.

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:03.440
With just a wave of my wand I could kill anyone
I want. And your whole, big, grand plan is

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:04.680
to disarm me?

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.640
Expelliarmus!

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:25.380
Expelliarmus!

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.960
Expell-

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.480
Expelliarmus!
Expelliarmus?

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:04.720
Expelliarmus! Expelliarmus!

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:15.100
Should've thought of that sooner.

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:23.790
Expelliarmus!
Hey, thanks for watching another Hyperdrive

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.430
Pictures video, be sure to subscribe over
there. We've got more Harry Potter videos,

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:31.980

definitely do that subscribe action.

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.610
Don't forget to also like and comment and
share with your friends.

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:39.769
Right, and we've got our guest James who's
here from Videogame Hour Live, which is a

00:02:39.769 --> 00:02:42.819
show I used to work on, so you should definitely
check out that channel and check out James

00:02:42.819 --> 00:02:46.019
on that channel.
That's right, we stream every Tuesday night,

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:50.989
live. And we're gonna be playing all the newest
games, and sometimes we'll go back to the

00:02:50.989 --> 00:02:54.550
past with some classic games, so it's a lot
of fun. And we also upload to YouTube.

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:58.940
Right, there's a link to their YouTube somewhere
on this page and their stream stuff down in

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:00.889
