00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:03.629
Alright, hello and welcome to another another tutorial.

00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:10.629
This one will be about weapons

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:17.070
and shields.

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:21.250
Okay, so, what we're going to do, I assume you've already seen my other weapon tutorials.

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:24.830
So you're going to get out an Asgard Beam Weapon.

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:28.640
Well, actually, there's going to end up being two.

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:31.970
For now we'll just do this. The one thing we want is we want this Expression 2

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:33.170
that will be available in the description.

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:37.420
Pretty much you just place it on the back.

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:41.190
And here's how you wire it up

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:44.729
Fire goes to Fire, and then Entity goes to RealTarget

00:00:44.729 --> 00:00:47.889
and that's all you need to do on that side.

00:00:47.889 --> 00:00:51.289
Now this thing's Target goes to the target from inside of here

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:54.839
and then this thing's active

00:00:54.839 --> 00:00:58.199
also goes to the Target Finder's 1 (which is an output)

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:01.739
and this thing's Active also goes to the Target Finder's 1

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:04.739
Now it will not shoot at anything if it does not have a clear line of sight on it

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.060
So what you should do is you should do

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:13.500
Advanced Duplicator, right-click (to copy), light-click (to paste)

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.770
and now, you have two! Alright, so let's

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:24.310
So what's going to happen

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:28.590
...

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.850
I'm going to take this

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:35.810
and I'm going to weld it to the spaceship

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:42.039
like that.

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:45.109
Actually what I'm going to do is I'm going to

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:48.289
take this

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:52.030
put that there, move this.

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.600
What I'm going to do is move this out a couple notches

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:00.590
so if I needed to I can do maintenance
on the chip I always do that when I

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:01.439
build with this chip.

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:05.049
So now weld this to here

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:08.319
...

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:11.910
...

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.980
Sometimes the weld tool does that

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:21.980
lower

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:27.650
Alright move it down a couple notches and I'm just going to weld it to here, and weld this one to here.

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.740
And now the target finder will find targets

00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:34.990
It will only find NPCs though

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:38.860
which is kind of a good thing so if I put a

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:41.970
Antlion guard down here

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:45.890
...

00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:49.020
...

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:55.300
NPCs...disable AI. So now what these things will do

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:56.330
they will shoot the target which I'm going to do. I (originally) didn't give them energy purposfully

00:02:56.330 --> 00:03:00.090
shoot the target if they have energy

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:00.860
because that way

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:04.280
it won't accidentally destroy anything.

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:07.480
of

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:12.240
And there they got the Antlion Guard

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:16.830
And apparently themselves. Nope just kidding.

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:20.450
But if I put the Antlion Guard over here.

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:24.260
they both shoot, but only one will shoot at the target and the other one will not

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:28.660
should not...

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:31.920
Pretty much that's how that system works, it's pretty simple to get the weapons working.

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.320
And another thing is

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:38.500
Shields, very important

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:41.560
I prefer to use Shield Cores over the Shield  Generator's because

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:45.450
they offer a number of advantages mostly
that they

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:48.880
take less energy to use because
less energy is good

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:52.000
because the formula

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.400
formula involves using the area (actually, volume, if I recall correctly) of
the shield and

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:58.660
the area of a sphere is I mean it's not
greater

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:03.160
but how the shield generator works is, because you usually don't build spherical (or ellipsoid)

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:03.680
ships

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:06.959
so it's less efficient because there's
so much empty space

00:04:06.959 --> 00:04:10.750
this shield core however is much better

00:04:10.750 --> 00:04:13.940
for reasons I will be detail in a couple seconds once I can actually see

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:18.640
okay so with us out here stuff, so if I click
on this

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:22.640
and then if you can drag these and you'll notice it the shield get's longer

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:26.850
and wider, or taller rather

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:30.330
and wider

00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:34.150
now you can tell that the shield is bigger

00:04:34.150 --> 00:04:38.039
I mean that shield is more or less
fitted to the ship its not

00:04:38.039 --> 00:04:39.000
exact or anything

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.490
but it is closer which is kind of the
point

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:46.620
it's the point of this to just make it
as efficient as possible or

00:04:46.620 --> 00:04:50.080
as well as more efficient than using
a sphere because with a sphere you'd be

00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:54.520
many times larger than this any I put it on "Always Show Bubble" to make sure it's

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:58.270
covering the entire ship and it is

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:02.680
so now this is a lot more efficient than
would have been if it was

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:06.650
I don't know, something else like one of those spherical ones

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:10.039
because it would have been that wide and that tall

00:05:10.039 --> 00:05:14.080
and that long and I mean it doesn't need to be

00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:19.820
so good things now you want to put those
strength all the way up because even

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:21.240
though it'll take a lot more power

00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:24.979
it will need

00:05:24.979 --> 00:05:28.030
these shields are not very strong

00:05:28.030 --> 00:05:31.380
you want to be as strong as possible

00:05:31.380 --> 00:05:34.539
so that's actually it for this one, and your spaceship

00:05:34.539 --> 00:05:37.910
is pretty much complete

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:41.070
congratulations you finish your
spaceship, although there might be a couple

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:42.419
more things you want to do

00:05:42.419 --> 00:05:45.680
but for the most part you don't actually
need to do any of them so

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:47.030
just go have fun
