My name is Randy R.C.

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:05.100
Connor, choreographer to the stars.

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:10.879
I've worked with Britney Spears, P. Diddy
Combs, Prince, Mary J. Blige, Janet Jackson,

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:11.879
Jay-Z.

00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:16.150
We're gonna just break down some moves, that
you can use at the club, at the parties, at

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:21.840
home, in your bathroom -- just have fun guys,
so let's get started.

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.010
C'mon!

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:25.289
Okay guys, here we go.

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:28.490
Now, what we're about to do is the Spongebob
dance.

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:32.160
This is 1 of my niece's favorite cartoon characters.

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.890
And this dance is really cool, and it's a
lot of fun.

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.050
But keep in mind, it's a high-energy dance,
so always make sure that you're breathing

00:00:39.050 --> 00:00:41.360
through your nose, and out through your mouth,
okay?

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:43.510
So we're gonna start really simple, alright?

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:48.829
And the basic step goes like, basically, you
hop on the right, and you push, and you hop

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:49.989
again on your right.

00:00:49.989 --> 00:00:53.149
So you hop, push, hop, push, okay?

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:55.559
So you're hopping on your right, pushing.

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:57.820
You're hopping on your left, you're pushing.

00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:59.080
Hopping on your right, pushing.

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:01.950
Now, the arms, we're gonna coordinate the
arms, okay?

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:06.560
Just so we look clean, 'cause everything is
always about just looking clean.

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:08.079
Presentation, alright?

00:01:08.079 --> 00:01:13.549
So the arms is, we're going out position So
we're going here, push....here, push, here,

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:15.380
push, here, push here.

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:19.229
Push, here, push, here, push, here, push,
here.

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.649
Push, here, push, here, push...alright?

00:01:21.649 --> 00:01:23.960
So that's the basic step, alright?

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.799
Now, we're gonna try that with some music,
alright?

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:31.469
So here we go.

00:01:31.469 --> 00:01:34.770
Alright, ready guys?

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:35.770

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:36.779
Start slow...good.

00:01:36.779 --> 00:01:56.279
And arms.

00:01:56.279 --> 00:02:01.090
Now remember, you have to breathe, and it
takes a little practice, but it's okay...you'll

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:02.369
get it, alright?

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:06.719
Just make sure you keep practicing, 'cause,
uh, it takes a lot of energy.

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:09.489
So let's do it 1 more time, all together,
alright?

00:02:09.489 --> 00:02:10.489
Here we go.

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:16.960
We're gonna start slow, and we're gonna speed
it up.
