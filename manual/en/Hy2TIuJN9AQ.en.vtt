The Xbox One gets a release date and other
info, Pokemon X and Y lets you choose from

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.000
the original three starter pokemon, the ps4
will NOT support external hard drives for

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.260
game storage, and more!

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:18.230
Hey guys, Jess here with the Curse weekly
Roundup!

00:00:18.230 --> 00:00:27.660
Alright, so I want to first off apologize
for my voice - I just got back from PAX and

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:32.369
then from hosting our Madden 25 launch party,
so I've been doing a LOT of talking over the

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:36.160
past few days - but anyway let's get right
into the news.

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:40.370
So the Xbox One has gotten a release date:
November 22nd worldwide.

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:41.870
Just in time for Thanksgiving!

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:45.410
So instead of WATCHING football this thanksgiving
you can gather your family round the Xbox

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:47.320
One and PLAY it instead.

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:51.019
Personally I'm surprised they didn't try to
one-up the competition by releasing EARLIER

00:00:51.019 --> 00:00:55.799
than the PS4, but maybe they just won't be
ready by then - what do you guys think?

00:00:55.799 --> 00:00:57.430
Leave me your thoughts in teh comments!

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:02.100
And, as an added bonus, Microsoft also dropped
the info that the Xbox One will support up

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:03.480
to 8 controllers at once!

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.530
Finally, I can have more than three friends
over at a time to play console games.

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.350
You know, as long as they actually release
games that will allow up to 8 players, otherwise

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:13.320
this whole point is kind of moot.

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.300
Next up, in a surprising Pokemon announcement,
the next generation fo games, X and Y, will

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:21.361
let you choose from teh ORIGINAL three starter
Pokemon: that's right, as a throwback to the

00:01:21.361 --> 00:01:25.280
first generation, Professor Sycamore will
give you your choice of Bulbasaur, Charmander,

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:26.300
or Squirtle.

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:30.360
Then, you get your choice of CHespin, Fennekin,
or Froakie, the new three starters, from a

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:31.360
friend.

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:32.360
So yay, two starter Pokemon!

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.840
I guess this means you can have two different
starting types in your party instead of having

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:36.870
to choose just one.

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:40.740
Moving on, the PlayStation 4 will NOT support
external storage space.

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:44.240
This news came via Twitter when a fan posed
the question to Sony Computer Entertainment's

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.880
President of Worldwide Studios Shuhei Yoshida.

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:50.409
Fans tweeted at Mr. Yoshida to ask if they
would be able to use external hard drives

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:56.510
and flash drives for extra space, and to install
games without having to install them on the

00:01:56.510 --> 00:02:01.540
internal main memory, he replied with a simple
and direct "no," giving no further explanation.

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:03.479
Well, that wraps up the roundup!

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.520
Not a huge week for news due to last weekend's
PAX Prime, but I'm sure things will pick up

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.140
again next Friday.

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.670
