00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:07.460
Hello and welcome back to the Guardian talking
points, German football for you. We will be

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:13.090
looking back at some big fixtures, of course
an in-depth look at Bayern beating Dortmund

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:20.680
in what was a fantastic game and then a preview
of the hottest three games of the weekend.

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:27.730
There is no doubt anymore, Gladbach are the
real deal this season. They beat Hoffenheim

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:33.430
3-1. Lucian Favre, the Swiss manager got a
lovely happy birthday song from the crowd

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:39.780
and it is now 17 games unbeaten, a record
that hadn't been broken since 1970/71. They

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:49.160
are second with Wolfsburg on goal difference
and if they keep going like that we will maybe

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:52.380
see them as actual contenders for Bayern.

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:59.110
Hamburger against Leverkusen was a battle
dressed up as a football game. 50 fouls, 27

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:07.060
of which were by Hamburg again a new record
for the season. Rafael van der Vaart scored

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:12.720
the only goal of the game and only Hamburg's
fourth goal of the season to give them a vital

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:22.570
three points. Leverkusen's manager said it
was a witchhunt, pointing to the frosty reception

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:34.790
for Hakan Çalhanoğlu who had left Hamburg
to go to Leverkusen.

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:43.689
The result for Stuttgart was very different
this time. Wolfsburg beat them 4-0 in Stuttgart

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:49.450
to stay in contention with Bayern and administer
a very heavy defeat that has a lot of people

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:54.520
wondering if maybe Stuttgart will be the next
big name dragged into the relegation battle.

00:01:54.520 --> 00:02:01.450
Kevin de Bruyne had another fantastic game.
The Wolfsburg coach said there is no reason

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:07.100
why clubs should already raise the white flag.
He said Bayern can be beaten and he will try

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.220
very hard to make it happen.

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:23.930
A fantastic occasion - Bayern beating Dortmund
2-1 in what was easily one of the most exciting

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:31.830
games the Bundesliga has seen this season.
Dortmund made a great start with Marco Reus

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:42.620
scoring a header from a great counter-attacking
move but Bayern hit back through of course

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:47.670
Robert Lewandowski the former Borussia striker,
before Arjen Robben converted a penalty late

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:53.050
on to administer yet another defeat for Dortmund.
The visitors left Munich with their heads

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:57.890
held a little bit higher but again after a
great performance nothing really to show for

00:02:57.890 --> 00:03:04.769
it. Jurgen Kloop was very touchy afterwards
and he accused a TV interviewer of being insensitive

00:03:04.769 --> 00:03:08.959
when he asked about Marco Reus' future that
is still very much in doubt after the player

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:16.690
himself refused to commit to a future in black
and yellow saying he is not thinking about

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:28.490
these things at 
the moment.

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:33.870
Sunday sees the battle of the two Borussia's
with Dortmund in the relegation zone for the

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:39.260
first time since getting relegated all those
years ago against the high-flying Favre's

00:03:39.260 --> 00:03:46.569
side who are third and could be second if
they had scored one more goal against Hoffenheim

00:03:46.569 --> 00:03:52.810
last week. It couldn't be a more contrasting
season for these sides and Favre's counter-attacking

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:57.159
team is exactly the kind of team that Dortmund
do not like to play against. They will try

00:03:57.159 --> 00:04:05.939
to do to Dortmund what Dortmund tend to do
to other sides. Kloop needs to show that he

00:04:05.939 --> 00:04:10.680
can actually turn it around and actually get
results despite the better performances, they

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:15.799
have not been able to put points on the board.

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:20.070
Seventh against tenth is not exactly a mouth
watering fixture but if I tell you that Paderborn

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:26.710
are 7th and Augsburg are 10th you might appreciate
what an outstanding achievement this is for

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:32.370
both sides. Paderborn keep confounding expectations;
they beat Hertha and another win against Augsburg

00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:38.280
and they are in the Europa League spots in
what is turning into a fantastic first season

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:39.680
in the top flight.

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:52.340
Hamburg are away to Wolfsburg and they have
a chance to show the recent 1-0 win away at

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:55.870
Leverkusen wasn't just a flash in the pan.
But scoring may be an issue for them - they

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:59.770
have only scored four in the whole season
whereas Wolfsburg are the second best attacking

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:20.880
side in the Bundesliga with 20 goals. This
should be a nice northern derby.
