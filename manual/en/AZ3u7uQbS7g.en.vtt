00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:51.820
Toshiyuki: What, for 3 minutes,

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:53.420
Toshiyuki: They told us to 'Act like you're suffering'.

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:54.640

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:06.600
Toshiyuki: That was... I thought,

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.460
Toshiyuki: "What is this audition?!"

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.020

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:17.060
Natsuki: In my workplace, we place the recorder on the table in the office and the record the audition there.

00:01:17.060 --> 00:01:18.480

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:21.660
Natsuki: There are other people on their desks.

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:24.560
Natsuki: So I take the chance once they take a call or do their work,

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.280
Toshiyuki: I see, so you look for the time when it's quiet,

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.080
Natsuki: Yes, I look for the chance.

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.080
Natsuki: You know how it's around 3 minutes long?

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:30.240
Natsuki: For me...

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.240
Natsuki: About 3 phone calls came during the recording.

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:33.840
Toshiyuki: Uh!? Did you do it over?

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:34.340
Natsuki: Yes.

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:36.380
Toshiyuki: Wooow... Must've been hard...

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:37.560
Natsuki: "Ahhhhhhh!!!!! AHHH!!!"

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:39.020
(TURURURURURU)

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.240
Natsuki: "Sorry about that, let's try again ^^."

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:44.960
Natsuki: "Is that so.... "

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:45.920
Toshiyuki: For real...

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:47.160
Natsuki: Because of this,

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:49.400
Natsuki: It was no joke...

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.640
Toshiyuki: Yeah. Must've been difficult...

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:53.640
Natsuki: Maybe it was worth its difficulty.

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.640
Toshiyuki: But, hey because you did it over 3 times it was,

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:57.640
Natsuki: Like I felt value from it.

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:59.160
Toshiyuki: Yeah exactly! (laugh)

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:00.840
Toshiyuki: In your weak state.

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:02.780
Toshiyuki: Me too!

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:07.020
Toshiyuki: I recorded my audition tape at home.

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:10.020
Toshiyuki: This had to be some sort of nusiance to the neighbours.

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:15.240
Toshiyuki: I recorded it at a level which they would think something had happened to me at my home.

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:19.620
Toshiyuki: So once I finished and I played it back to check,

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:21.260
Toshiyuki: There was a cicada in the background.

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.080
Toshiyuki: "Uarghhh!!!!" and then in the back,

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.080
Toshiyuki: Mem~ Mem~~

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.500
Toshiyuki: I thought, "It's the cicada season..."
