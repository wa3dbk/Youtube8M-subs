00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:11.475
Come on, bud.

00:00:11.683 --> 00:00:14.683
There's a whole
other world of dragons out there.

00:00:18.429 --> 00:00:19.433
Unbelievable.

00:00:23.046 --> 00:00:24.225
What do you say?

00:00:24.433 --> 00:00:25.767
What should we name it?

00:00:26.942 --> 00:00:28.308
Itchy armpit it is.

00:00:29.433 --> 00:00:32.475
I bet you think you know a lot
about dragons.

00:00:32.683 --> 00:00:34.341
- Should I know you?
- No...

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.766
But a mother never forgets.

00:00:39.187 --> 00:00:41.225
Every dragon has its secrets.

00:00:41.475 --> 00:00:43.275
I'll show them all to you!

00:00:44.987 --> 00:00:46.687
Did you know about this?

00:00:47.516 --> 00:00:49.391
That's your mother?!

00:00:49.641 --> 00:00:52.341
Now you know where I get
my dramatic flair!

00:00:54.141 --> 00:00:55.153
He likes you.

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.933
Something is coming.
Something you've never faced before.

00:01:00.308 --> 00:01:03.433
- What's down there?
- I alone control the dragons!

00:01:04.558 --> 00:01:06.308
Drago Bludvist is a madman.

00:01:06.558 --> 00:01:10.391
I'll bloody his fist with my face
if he tries to take my dragon!

00:01:12.474 --> 00:01:14.392
Dad, there's something
you need to know.

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:15.850
Oh, boy.

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:17.725
I know what you're gonna say.

00:01:18.891 --> 00:01:21.975
You're as beautiful
as the day I lost you.

00:01:24.516 --> 00:01:26.600
We're a team now.
Now what do you want to do?

00:01:26.808 --> 00:01:28.850
Drago's coming for our dragons.

00:01:29.489 --> 00:01:31.275
We have to stop him.
Together.

00:01:32.641 --> 00:01:34.100
Don't worry, bud.

00:01:34.308 --> 00:01:36.234
I'm not gonna let
anything happen to you.

00:01:38.075 --> 00:01:39.891
You have the heart of a chief...

00:01:40.975 --> 00:01:42.308
That's my boy!

00:01:42.558 --> 00:01:44.558
... and the soul of a dragon.

00:01:46.516 --> 00:01:48.566
You know that doesn't wash out.

00:01:49.433 --> 00:01:51.183
Cut them down!

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.266
Dragon riders coming through!

00:01:56.558 --> 00:01:57.392
Heads up!

00:02:01.266 --> 00:02:02.766
We can't fly these things!

00:02:03.016 --> 00:02:04.391
They're babies!

00:02:04.641 --> 00:02:06.266
They don't listen to anyone.

00:02:07.296 --> 00:02:08.416
Take 'em down, babe!

00:02:09.725 --> 00:02:10.933
Come on, bud!

00:02:11.183 --> 00:02:12.558
Hold on!

00:02:14.933 --> 00:02:16.017
Distract the alpha!

00:02:16.225 --> 00:02:17.558
Have a nice flight!

00:02:25.994 --> 00:02:27.308
Yeah, baby!
