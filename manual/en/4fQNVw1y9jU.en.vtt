00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:04.640
Now that I've cut my corrugated paper into
two separate pieces, I want to attach the

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:14.000
magnifying glass to the end of each one. I
put glue around the outside of the magnifying

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:23.760
glass. I'm using rubber cement glue for this.
I'll put a nice thick coat around, because

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.980
the magnifying glass is going to be turned
using the handle, and that's going to be used

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:37.789
to focus the upside down telescope. I want
to put enough glue to make a nice solid seal

00:00:37.789 --> 00:00:47.260
around the magnifying glass; where it touches
the paper. It's going to be handled a lot,

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:54.460
and I just want to make sure that it holds
nice, so I put it onto the edge of the paper,

00:00:54.460 --> 00:01:03.749
and I start rolling it around the edge of
the magnifying glass. The good thing about

00:01:03.749 --> 00:01:09.280
rubber cement is that it dries pretty quickly,
so you should be able to create a nice seal.

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:14.530
We hold it in place. The paper is not going
to go around where the handle of the magnifying

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:21.270
glass is, so I'm going to have to make a little
snip around where the handle is, and then

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.530
close the rest of the corrugated paper. I'm
going to try to do that as close as possible

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:32.759
to the outside of the magnifying glass, so
I don't leave any spaces. I just cut that

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:37.820
strip which is going to be hanging on the
handle of the magnifying glass. Then afterwards,

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:41.490
I can go ahead and cut it, but now I should
be able to close the rest of the corrugated

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:47.930
paper, and make a seal. I put the glue back
onto the edge of the corrugated paper, and

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:52.840
then I'm going to close it; still holding
on to the edge of the magnifying class, so

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:59.320
I know that it's going to be creating a nice,
tight, and also a straight seal. I want the

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:06.451
corrugated paper to make an even sized tube
to make up the body of the telescope, so I

00:02:06.451 --> 00:02:12.820
just hold on to the edge of the magnifying
glass, and that will be my guide. Once it's

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:19.050
done, you'll have your first tube, with one
side of the magnifying glass on the end, and

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:24.230
we'll be ready to make our second tube. That
will actually go over the first one, and that

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:29.180
will have its own magnifying glass on its
end; therefore; we can move them back and

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:36.990
forth; one on top of the other, and we'll
be able to use it to focus on an image. Now

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:43.450
I've shown you how to attach the corrugated
paper to the magnifying glass, and create

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:48.260
the first tube that's going to make up the
body of our upside down telescope.
