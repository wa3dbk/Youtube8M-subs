Hello and welcome to this WebsiteToolTester tutorial!

00:00:07.523 --> 00:00:12.649
By the end of this video, we’ll have a hosting account ready and a WordPress website installed.

00:00:13.354 --> 00:00:17.274
I’ll guide you through every step - it’s all very easy as you’ll see.

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:23.958
We’ll use A Small Orange for our hosting as it offers you a convenient One-Click Install option for WordPress.

00:00:24.696 --> 00:00:26.773
This reduces the set up time enormously.

00:00:27.507 --> 00:00:30.603
Their support is very reliable and prices are reasonable, too.

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:36.881
If you are on our WordPress Beginner’s Tutorial, simply click the screenshot and you’ll land on this page.

00:00:37.678 --> 00:00:43.742
Now, if you are just starting out, I would recommend that you choose the Shared Hosting options

00:00:43.742 --> 00:00:50.328
as they are the cheapest and it’s always possible to upgrade later on, once you are receiving higher visitor numbers.

00:00:50.851 --> 00:00:54.641
Personally I find that I am getting the most value out of the “Small” plan,

00:00:55.391 --> 00:01:02.169
simply because it includes the domain name for the first year, and by paying yearly you also get two months hosting for free.

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:05.773
But of course, you can also pay monthly if you prefer.

00:01:06.364 --> 00:01:07.147
Let’s continue.

00:01:07.596 --> 00:01:10.003
Now we enter the domain name we want to register.

00:01:10.411 --> 00:01:16.955
If you’ve already got a domain name you can of course also point or transfer it to A Small Orange.

00:01:17.738 --> 00:01:21.632
I now select the yearly payment plan in order to get the free domain name.

00:01:22.293 --> 00:01:26.445
You most certainly do not need any of the add-on services, so just skip that.

00:01:27.221 --> 00:01:36.124
The total amount is $50 for our first year but you can further reduce that using our discount voucher, which will save you 15% on top.

00:01:43.013 --> 00:01:45.173
The last step is simply to complete the purchase.

00:01:47.797 --> 00:01:51.739
Once your order is completed, you will receive the login data via email.

00:01:52.508 --> 00:01:57.633
Login to your Customer Area and go to Your Services as you can see here.

00:01:58.383 --> 00:02:00.026
Click on the View Details button now.

00:02:00.715 --> 00:02:06.568
As a next step you need to click Login to cPanel - sounds technical I know, but don’t worry.

00:02:07.152 --> 00:02:08.439
It’s all very easy.

00:02:09.234 --> 00:02:13.824
Go to Software now and click the Softaculous Software Installer.

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:19.597
I know that sounds quite fancy too but I assure you that it’s easy and it’s very helpful.

00:02:20.131 --> 00:02:23.565
You can already see the big WordPress logo which we are here for.

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:24.909
Click Install.

00:02:25.557 --> 00:02:28.934
This will now bring up additional options, which are important.

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:35.333
Firstly, you should not name your main user “admin” as hackers usually go after this username.

00:02:35.799 --> 00:02:39.324
Give it an unusual name and select a very strong password.

00:02:41.167 --> 00:02:46.436
You should definitely add the Limit Login Attempts plugin as this will make a hacker’s life much harder.

00:02:47.084 --> 00:02:56.965
Doing it this way means a hacker won’t be able to just try all different kinds of password combinations for as long as they want to, and this means extra security for your site.

00:02:57.469 --> 00:03:01.689
Under advanced options I would also recommend that you set up the backup feature

00:03:02.143 --> 00:03:07.730
as it’s always good to be able to revert your site back to an earlier time if something should go wrong.

00:03:08.352 --> 00:03:11.519
Additionally you can also activate the automatic updates.

00:03:12.169 --> 00:03:16.689
This is a good idea unless you are going to use a huge variety of plugins.

00:03:17.252 --> 00:03:21.831
As a final step you can select one of the pre-defined themes and click Install.

00:03:28.002 --> 00:03:29.331
Congratulations!

00:03:29.767 --> 00:03:31.498
Your WordPress website is now ready.

00:03:32.171 --> 00:03:36.272
In the next video I will show you how to install a premium WordPress template.
