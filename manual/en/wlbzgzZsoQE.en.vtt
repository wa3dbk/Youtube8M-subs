00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:08.069
Nokia 2700 Classic.

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:10.600
Available now.

00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:16.450
Priced at just €65 or so before tax and
subsidy, the Nokia 2700 Classic is priced

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:21.070
as an entry-level phone, but the features
look like they belong in a much more expensive

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:22.330
handset.

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:28.520
With a design inspired by the Nokia 6300,
the Nokia 2700 Classic has a very similar

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:32.930
feature set to its well-known predecessor
- the screen isn't quite as good and the case

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:39.040
looks more plasticky, but otherwise the Nokia
2700 Classic offers everything that the 6300

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.410
does.. but it is a lot cheaper.

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:48.850
The 6300 currently sells SIM-free for about
€110 before tax, so the €65 price point

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:51.530
of the 2700 is impressive.

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:53.660
So what do you get for the money?

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:59.250
You might expect the answer is "not a lot",
but in fact the 2700's feature set is very

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.400
well rounded.

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:09.260
There's a 2" 240 x 320 pixel display, Bluetooth,
microSD expandable memory (2GB maximum), an

00:01:09.260 --> 00:01:14.049
FM radio, media player and a web browser and
email client.

00:01:14.049 --> 00:01:20.810
Usefully, the 2700 comes with a standard 3.5mm
audio socket, so it will most likely make

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:23.210
a decent MP3 player.

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:27.960
At this sort of price range there are some
compromises - video capture resolution is

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:35.040
just 176 x 144 pixels at 15 frames per second,
which isn't much use.

00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:40.070
There's no autofocus or flash on the camera
(although it does have low-light capabilities),

00:01:40.070 --> 00:01:43.819
and there's no memory card in the standard
sales package.

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:46.539
But for this sort of money, who cares?

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:52.799
Talktime is a useful 6 hours maximum with
up to 11 days standby time, and the 2700 Classic

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:55.399
weighs only 85 grams.

00:01:55.399 --> 00:02:00.249
It is a good looking device - low end Nokias
often are - but you might not like the flat

00:02:00.249 --> 00:02:02.299
keypad arrangement.

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:06.740
It certainly looks an awful lot more expensive
than it actually is, and that can only be

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:08.330
a good thing.

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:13.170
Nokia say that the 2700 Classic should be
available during Q2 2009.
