00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.380
One of the really good things about having
the garden is that we've had neighbours coming

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:38.180
around and viewing it and actually it has
been really good for us in a wider sense of

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:42.800
breaking down barriers between what people's
views of what homeless people are and what

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:44.800
they're about and how little they can do.

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:50.290
We've broken that down and people have seen
that actually the vast majority of people

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:53.760
living here, although they have their struggles
are just the same as the rest of us.

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:59.199
With staff here and residents here and the
local volunteers from Friends of the Earth

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:03.890
we dug over sections and we planted it. We
had a big community day here which was really

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:04.770
fun, lots of fun.

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:09.840
The meadows have really helped the local bees.
Last Summer I think we counted something like

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.820
twenty different varieties of bees and also
the local bee keeper is delighted because

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.930
he's had record yields of bees.

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:23.080
Around the corner we have four hives in the
church and the bees use our ground mainly

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:25.880
because they don't go far and they go

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.000
and pollinate everything for us and it comes up well.

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:34.159
It's quite a calming activity to be involved
in any sort of garden, any sort of green space

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:38.680
and I think that's nice that sometimes when
you lead quite a chaotic life to have that

00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:45.100
oasis of calm where you can come and feel
safe and relax and do a little bit of pottering

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:46.890
about, itâ€™s a really powerful thing.

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.380
I've been here for four years and it has made
my life a lot happier, a lot, lot happier.

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:56.439
There will be some people here who've probably
only ever lived in a high-rise so the opportunity

00:01:56.439 --> 00:02:02.329
to come and work in gardens like this doesn't
really present itself to them whereas here

00:02:02.329 --> 00:02:06.799
there is that opportunity, so yeah it will
have given people a better understanding of

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:11.870
nature and the benefits of it. We've got chickens
here as well and all sorts of things growing

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:17.060
and I think it's nice to see you can put something
in the ground, watch it grow and there'll

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:22.060
be a benefit to it whether it be growing flowers
for the bees or growing peas for the kitchen.

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:29.200
Get your seeds and plant your meadow, as a
process it takes a group and it takes persistence

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:33.090
to follow it up and to keep it. You can't
just sow and walk away and leave it you need

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:38.970
to tend to it but I say do it, it brings so
much joy to see the colour

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:40.890
and the wildlife  that follows it.
