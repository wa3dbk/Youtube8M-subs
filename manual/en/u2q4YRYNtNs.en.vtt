00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:11.440
The PS4 continues to pump out more exclusive
games from their own studios, indie developers,

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:13.600
and third party AAA developers.

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:16.500
The variety is unmatched.

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.680
Some of these games are still in early development,
only teaser or concept art has been released.

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:27.760
Let's take a look at the upcoming PS4 exclusives
you haven't heard of yet.

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:35.410
Deep Down
Deep Down can be summed up as a Dark Souls

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:36.410
killer.

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:41.060
It's a dungeon crawler that focuses on using
melee weapons such as swords and spears.

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:44.080
The game will have online features similar
to Dark Souls.

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:59.269
The battles will include fire breathing dragons
and huge rock creatures.

00:00:59.269 --> 00:01:03.040
The game begins in New York City in the year
2094.

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:07.979
By touching magical artificats, players are
teleported into the distant past to explore

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:16.040
dungeons, battle monsters, and find treasure.

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:20.370
Dungeons are randomly generated and the artificats
you touch correspond to an emotion including

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:36.860
anger, rage, hate, envy, lust, and wrath.

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.770
The environemnts look very dark and trecherous.

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:50.710
And we have also seen footage of split screen
multiplayer.

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:56.040
The game has been in development since 2013
and newer details are still being withheld.

But developers have stated that the game has
changed significantly since it's conception.

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:04.610
The engine is being built specifically for
the PS4 and development is led by Yaoshinori

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:08.080

series.

Hellblade
Hellblade is developed by Ninja Theory and

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.120

on the protagonist Senua as she embarks on

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:25.340
a very personal journey through a hellish
underworld.

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.230
The game is being branded as an independent
triple A game.

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:32.110
Which means it will be developed and published
independetly but with the quality and production

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:33.950
value of a triple A game.

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:38.400
This is because they want the game to be unique
and take risks unlike most triple A published

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:39.400
games.

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.730
The combat is described as brutal and uncompromising
as the developers has learned how to make

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:47.410
high impact action over the last few games.

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:51.160

Tearaway Unfolded is a port of the original

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:55.280

The touchpad will be used for specific game
related gestures and the light bar will be

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.040
used to illuminate dark areas.

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:11.650
The original Tearaway is a about a messsenger
on a mission to deliver a unique message to

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:12.650
the player.

mysterious island and a terrible curse.

The game has a strong emphasis on puzzle solving
using the help of a mysterious artifact that

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:43.160
is used to manipulate the environment and
time.

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:47.780

Persona 5, the latest title in the series,

00:03:54.030 --> 00:03:58.670

Show via a short animated trailer, but much

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:01.250
of the gameï¿½s content is shrouded in mystery
at this time.

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:05.989
Based on what we know, Persona 5 will continue
the series tradition of starring Japanese

00:04:05.989 --> 00:04:11.090
high school students and will feature the
concept of freedom as a major underlying theme.

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:14.500

gaps or dashing between cover.
