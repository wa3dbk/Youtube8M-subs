00:00:06.109 --> 00:00:10.879
Hi, I'm Alex with Noria Corporation, and we're
on a mission to make this world better through

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:17.740
lubrication excellence. Today, I will talk
about the importance of implementing a world-class

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:24.509
oil analysis program to support your reliability
strategies. In Noria, we use an expression

00:00:24.509 --> 00:00:30.610
that says, "The oil in your machines is talking
- are you hearing it?" The answer we normally

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:36.390
receive is, "Yes, we do have an oil analysis
program implemented in place, and it has been

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:43.390
working for years." That's wonderful! But
there is a second question: Are you hearing

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:50.730
all the valuable and all the useful information
that your oil wants to tell you? Probably

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:56.840
here the answer is not affirmative. We have
seen many programs implemented in the field

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:03.440
with the best desires, but limitations that
are not perceived in many cases by the proper

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:10.100
user. Let's talk about how to implement a
world-class oil analysis program. First, we

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:19.800
have to define the program goals and objectives.
Will we use it as a predictive strategy? Will

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:27.280
it be used only as a proactive strategy? Will
it be used or implemented to maximize the

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:32.890
oil drain intervals in machines? Or probably
it would be interesting to implement it to

00:01:32.890 --> 00:01:39.630
analyze the quality and verify the quality
of the incoming oil. Or even better, it can

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:46.510
be implemented with all those objectives,
which is the best practice. The second step

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:53.510
is implementing what was designed. That means
installing the right sampling ports, using

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:59.890
the right sampling technology and devices;
the right bottles. Taking the samples and

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:05.770
sending them immediately to the lab. Taking
the right corrective and proactive actions

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:13.770
resulting from the lab reports and using historical
information as a feedback for continuous improvement.

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:21.980
The result is a powerful program that will
support your reliability strategy. Well, if

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:28.640
you'd like us to help you implement a world-class
oil analysis program, please let us know!
