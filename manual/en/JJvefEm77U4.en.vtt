Hello, everyone!

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:09.350
This is Joao from Kenhub, and welcome to another
tutorial.

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:14.670
This time, I'm going to be talking about the
medial views of your right and left lungs.

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:20.010
Now, keep in mind that I did on the previous
tutorial that you can find here at Kenhub,

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:25.310
a tutorial where I just dedicated to the lateral
views of the lungs.

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:32.279
So if we're looking now at the anterior view
of the thorax, now exposing here the lungs,

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:37.610
your heart, what I did was I did a tutorial
where I covered all the structures that you

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:43.860
can see on the lateral views of your lungs,
but on this tutorial, I'm going to do or cover

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.800
the lungs from medial view.

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.920
So we're going to look at all the structures
that can be seen on the medial views of the

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:50.920
lungs.

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:56.950
Now, if you ask me why I decided to do this,
well, when you are in an anatomy lab or when

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:02.670
you're in an exam, usually, your professor
will show the lungs in different positions,

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.900
in different views, and you...

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:10.859
