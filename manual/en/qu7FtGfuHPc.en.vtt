Hi everyone~

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:06.970
I'm here to show you guys

00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:09.980
my new Demonia Stomp 08 platform shoes

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:14.070
I bought from alternative-footwear.co.uk

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:17.550
for Â£55

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.110
so since I'm here in UK it's free shipping

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:29.110
actually I already opened it but here it is I put it back in the box to show you guys

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:33.390
I'm quite disappointed it didn't

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:36.770
came with the Demonia shoe box

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:39.780
but

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:41.710
its okay

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:44.990
so right here it says

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:48.410
Stomp 08, size 3 UK

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:51.580
6 US

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:55.480
and the first thing you'll see inside is ofc the invoice

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:00.309
so you have the invoice...and then, it's all wrapped up in

00:01:00.309 --> 00:01:03.760
plastic but obviously I removed it already

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:08.690
so this is how they look in real life

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:12.110
they look really neat and cool

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:15.140
and of course

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:17.520
Im inlove with them

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.840
I've walked in them already for a few times

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.570
and

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:30.000
although I'm a size 6US I kinda find it 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.150
a teeny bit loose

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.100
Im not sure why, I really love this

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:42.940
detail, Demonia

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:46.490
If there is any flaws

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:48.240
I've noticed

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:51.810
it's the (....) there is an excess rubber

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:54.860
excess rubber

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.310
right there, but wow

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:02.020
I'm just being kinda nosy (i meant nit-picky lol)

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:06.159
actually it's great, I'm gonna attach some pictures here

00:02:06.159 --> 00:02:13.159
so I can show you guys how they look when they're worn

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:40.850
Overall I'm very satisfied

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:45.400
with the shoes, I'm very satisfied with the shop. The shop, they ship

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:50.040
fast and usually it says

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.360
they need 2 to 3 working days before you receive them but actually

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:57.560
the next working day I received them already

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:01.450
so yeah that's another plus

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:04.760
so if you're having doubts...

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:06.510
or you're not sure if you

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:08.260
want them, i say

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:09.660
go for it

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:12.400
because they're great shoes, they're very sturdy, you won't

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.280
trip easily

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.970
they're great addition to your shoe collection

00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:24.910
so yes, get them! And good luck with that

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:26.290
guys, that's it

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:30.330
