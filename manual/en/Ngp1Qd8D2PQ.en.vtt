00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:12.820
Throughout the years philosophers have asked,

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:15.460
what makes an action good?

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:21.840
Suppose you’re trying to save the world
from aliens who seek to enslave humanity,

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.110
but you accidentally blow up Earth?

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:27.110
Most unpleasant, indeed!

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:32.000
Or, what if you see an infant fall into a pond?
You jump in to save it

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.670
but a crocodile gets there first. Can your
action still be considered morally good?

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:43.500
Well, It depends on whom you ask. Immanuel
Kant would say that the moral worth of your

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.800
action is determined entirely by whether or
not you were motivated by duty,

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:53.149
whereas English philosopher John Stuart Mill
would say the moral worth of your action is

00:00:53.149 --> 00:00:58.809
determined by the amount of happiness it produces, and for the greatest number of people.

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:04.680
Kant defines duty as “the necessity to act
out of respect for the moral law.” So, if

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:10.149
it is your duty to attempt to save the drowning
child, but you fail, your action is still

00:01:10.149 --> 00:01:14.280
morally good. The consequences of that attempt
are morally irrelevant.

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.569
Of course, it’s natural to feel happiness
from doing your duty, but Kant thinks this

00:01:19.569 --> 00:01:25.250
doesn’t matter. Because for him, morality
isn’t a matter of what makes you happy, it’s

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:27.550
about rationality.

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:32.990
You see, to determine an action’s moral
worth, you must look to the will of the person

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:39.990
who, well, willed the action! Now, the good
that the good will wills is expressed by doing

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:46.080
our duty, which satisfies what Kant calls
the Categorical Imperative.

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:52.000
The Categorical Imperative is a self-given
law, a command that, Kant thinks, our reason

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:58.080
dictates to us. Consequently, when we act
from duty, we are willing the right thing

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:02.569
out of respect for ourselves as rational,
law-giving beings.

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:09.330
Mill, on the other hand, thinks that happiness,
not rationality, is fundamental to morality.

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:14.650
And by happiness Mill means pleasure,
and the absence of pain.

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:17.450
Indeed, Mill thinks that pleasure is the only

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:24.450
thing that’s inherently valuable. But, it
should be noted, not all pleasures are equal.

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:29.860
Provided that an action promotes happiness,
it is morally good. To the extent it does

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:33.010
not promote happiness, it is wrong.

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:39.820
But what if they’re both wrong? What if
morality is a delusion, just a sophisticated

00:02:39.820 --> 00:02:44.840
way of asserting one's preference? What if it’s
all relative?
