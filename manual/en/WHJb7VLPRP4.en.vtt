00:00:23.948 --> 00:00:26.126
Yes. 
- Yes.

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:31.353
Chairman sir has called you.

00:00:33.166 --> 00:00:37.397
You are going to be an A grade office, 
Mr. Abhiroop Banerjee.

00:00:37.477 --> 00:00:38.090
Thank you, sir.

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:39.589
That is wonderful news.

00:00:40.193 --> 00:00:41.881
Even I was in the line, right?

00:00:41.961 --> 00:00:43.848
But your rent for 6 months is left.

00:00:43.928 --> 00:00:45.405
Hey, it will be done. It will be done for sure.

00:00:46.565 --> 00:00:48.064
Happy birthday.
 - Happy birthday.

00:00:48.144 --> 00:00:50.368
Now I wanted to say that the rent..

00:00:50.448 --> 00:00:51.917
Hey, forget ranting about the rent!

00:00:51.997 --> 00:00:52.433
Rent! Rent!

00:00:52.513 --> 00:00:53.785
Come on. Come with me. 
 - No, no, leave it.

00:00:53.865 --> 00:00:55.317
No, no, 
I will talk for sure today.

00:00:55.632 --> 00:00:56.665
What did you tell him?

00:00:57.082 --> 00:00:57.974
What was the need?

00:01:05.254 --> 00:01:07.870
12 lakhs in 6 months! 
You are a bloody crook.

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.676
I think Abhi isn't too great with the computer.

00:01:11.756 --> 00:01:13.526
Hey, the one in yellow sari. 
 - She is superb.

00:01:13.606 --> 00:01:16.045
Get lost.. 
- Abhi! Do something.

00:01:25.602 --> 00:01:26.371
Sorry.

00:01:30.098 --> 00:01:31.763
How are you, my friend?

00:01:32.516 --> 00:01:33.133
Arjun!

00:01:37.605 --> 00:01:38.876
Remember something.

00:01:39.237 --> 00:01:41.746
Fear is just a state of mind.

00:01:42.631 --> 00:01:42.984
Come on.

00:01:45.533 --> 00:01:47.226
What are you so afraid of?
 Yes?

00:01:48.455 --> 00:01:49.392
What is the fear for?

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:53.199
Everything will be fine.

00:01:53.279 --> 00:01:55.396
Now go and get your rent.

00:01:58.438 --> 00:02:00.453
I will not go back by train
 from now on, Abhi.

00:02:00.533 --> 00:02:02.660
One has to do away with
 the problem of one's own house.

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:03.416
Take this, fool!

00:02:10.961 --> 00:02:11.415
Abhi.

00:02:26.218 --> 00:02:27.865
Hey, wow.

00:02:28.258 --> 00:02:30.998
It seems my Royal Bengal tiger was woken up.

00:02:31.078 --> 00:02:32.912
You are the real royal Bengal tiger.
