Hi I’m Josh Ellsworth with Stahls’ CAD-CUT®
Direct. Today I’m excited to show you a

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:16.570
great product from our Stahls’ TEK™ line
of printable heat transfer materials. This

00:00:16.570 --> 00:00:21.050
line of materials is engineered for decorating
performance apparel and other synthetic fabrics

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:26.260
with a heat press. The product, SuperTEK™
Sublistop™, addresses some of the biggest

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:31.100
problems decorators have had with these types
of fabrics. The first on this list is dye

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:37.370
migration. So dye migration is when the dyes
from a polyester based fabric, like I have

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:43.210
here, bleed through the face of a print. Basic
heat transfer materials that are out and screen

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:47.800
printing inks just have a basic white back
and they’re not made to inhibit dye migration

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:52.410
and they leave your polyester garments are
risk for bleeding through this print, even

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:56.430
after you send them out the door. And so,
there have been Sub Block technologies of

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.030
old that addressed this issue but the problem
is, they’ve relied on thickening up the

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:06.460
material or using a stiff, crunchy, metalized
layer for inhibiting or blocking migration

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:11.150
and this really compromised the performance
of the actual performance textile you intend

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:15.500
to decorate. It makes it crunchy, doesn’t
stretch, isn’t soft anymore. But with our

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:22.210
new SuperTEK™ Sublistop™, this all changes.
SuperTEK™ Sublistop™ features the world’s

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:27.100
first charcoal based adhesive, which is the
black adhesive on the back of this material.

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:32.740
Now we call this adhesive ONYX STiX2™ because
it not only inhibits dye migration but it

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:38.240
sticks to anything with the soft, pliable,
and stretch performance. All you need to do

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:43.840
is print and cut your graphic on any solvent
or eco-solvent printer, weed, mask, and heat

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:48.210
apply. So I want to show you some of the other
key things about this product in heat application.

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:55.630
So I’m going to load this 100% polyester
red shirt that we referenced earlier and this

00:01:55.630 --> 00:02:01.619
garment can easily bleed through the white
areas of my graphic and it can also easily

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:07.120
scorch under a high heat on the heat press
but like all the other Stahls’ TEK™ materials,

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:12.920
the SuperTEK™ Sublistop™ only takes 2
steps of 5 seconds each to heat apply as low

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:20.480
as 280°. This lessened heat and shortened
time cycles really help to keep the garment

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:25.760
unmarked. As you’ll see after we press it,
the finished result is going to be soft, stretchable

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:40.540
and white stays white. The first step of 5
seconds at 280°. Peel warm. Look at the bright

00:02:40.540 --> 00:03:06.900
white and then I’ll finish with a cover
sheet for an additional 5 seconds. We have

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:20.510
a result that’s soft, stretchable, and no
heat press mark on our garment. SuperTEK™

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:26.390
Sublistop™ is the perfect product to use
for any synthetic fabric so feel confident

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:32.159
using it on loose fit polyesters, stretch
polyesters, jackets, bags, and more. To purchase
