00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:08.639
So when you’re getting ready for your date,
your body may look good, you have your favorite

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:13.860
outfit on, but you also want your mind free
and clear so you feel open and relaxed, and

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:14.860
ready for the evening.

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:18.380
So this is a nice routine that you can do,
there’s 6 very simple moves, to keep your

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:22.590
body feeling open, strong and in balance,
and your mind free and clear so you can have

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.140
a lot of fun.

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:27.789
Let’s get started.

00:00:27.789 --> 00:00:31.420
We’ll begin in a pigeon pose.

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:36.800
So, bringing yourself up to the front of your
mat here, this is really nice to release tension

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.430
in the hips and also the mind too, so all
the places that get a little wound up before

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:44.260
a nice hot date.

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:47.820
And then gently take a big inhale, open up
your chest, big breath in here.

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.140
And as you exhale, we’ll soften all the
way over this fresh in.

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:53.530
And just take a few easy breaths here.

00:00:53.530 --> 00:00:56.559
Maybe have your forearms on the ground if
that feels good.

00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:00.510
If that feels nice, and if you’re open enough
to have the forehead on the back of your hands,

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:01.510
rest there.

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:02.510
That’s a good one.

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:04.350
But try not to force or push anything.

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:10.950
Taking a few very long, big inhales and even
longer, deeper exhales here.

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.900
And once you stay there for about 10 to 20
breaths, that’s a good amount here, gently

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:19.540
bring yourself all the way back up, and we’ll
swing this back leg all the way around for

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:25.240
a nice ankle to knee: also great to relieve
tension in the hips, calms down the mind too.

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.070
Let’s take a few easy breaths here.

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:31.580
And then as you exhale, if there’s room
again to walk it forward that may feel nice.

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:35.160
Some big, full, deep, inhales and long exhales.

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:39.409
And, then if you like, take a little walk
around to one side for a few breaths and see

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:40.460
what’s going on there.

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:44.820
And if you go around to one side, make sure
you go to the other side too.

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:49.320
So if you find any pockets of tension, see
if you can stay with that tension for a few

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:55.510
deep breaths, usually starts to dissolve if
you breathe deeply.

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:58.090
And again, when you’re ready, gently bring
yourself back from that one and just come

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:01.670
into stacking your knees on top each other
here and scooching your feet out to the sides.

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:04.540
This is another good one for the hips too.

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:07.381
And with this one, if you’re pretty good
here, this isn’t a big deal, perhaps you

00:02:07.381 --> 00:02:11.650
can open up the shoulders as well, sometimes
nice to open up the chest and back here.

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:14.440
So right arm coming up and left arm coming
down and around.

00:02:14.440 --> 00:02:18.620
And if there’s a little more space, slowly
bring it all the way forward, and take a few

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.370
breaths here.

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:26.340
And when you are ready, gently bring yourself
up from that one, and make sure you do that

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:27.349
whole thing on the other side.

00:02:27.349 --> 00:02:30.500
And we’ll do just a few more to open up
the chest and spine.

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:31.660
Also a lot of tension in there.

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:35.940
Help you feel nice and refreshed and open
and ready for your hot date.

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:40.080
So bringing yourself all the way into a nice
position here on your back, bring your feet

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:42.950
on the ground right next to your hips, and
just press down, lift up your hips, lift your

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:45.730
chest all the way up here to a nice full,
easy arc.

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:50.000
If there’s a little more room in there to
slowly wiggle your shoulders underneath each

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.819
other, go for that.

00:02:51.819 --> 00:02:54.330
And the most important thing is to breathe
deeply.

00:02:54.330 --> 00:03:00.930
And once you get a few breaths there, gently
release all the way down from that one.

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:02.790
So if that feels good, maybe just do that
again.

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:04.470
If you want to rest instead, that’s great.

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:09.000
If there’s a little more room in the back
to bring your hands on the ground right next

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.200
to your ears, pressing your palms nice and
firmly, slowly push and lift everything all

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.200
the way.

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:16.900
But if this is a little too much, you can
always soften out of it, tuck your chin and

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:17.900
come all the way down.

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:20.600
And if you’re comfortable, come into a wheel.

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:25.840
Really nice one to open up the whole spine,
make some more space in there, and help you

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:26.840
to breath a lot easier.

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:33.200
And once you had enough of that one, gently
bring yourself all the way back down.

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.540
Take a few breaths and release your back,
hugging your knees in.

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:39.330
Maybe rock a little side to side.

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:42.690
And when you’re ready, gently bring yourself
all the way back up.

00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:46.140
So there you have it, a very simple routine
that you can do before your date to keep your

00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:47.640
body and mind in balance.

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:51.260
I’m Tara Stiles, and I’ll see you next
time on the Yoga Solution.

00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:52.680
Thanks so much for watching, you guys.

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.489
I’m actually checking out the page right
now, seeing some of the comments.

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:58.390
We filmed a lot of your comments and questions
today.

00:03:58.390 --> 00:03:59.950
Thanks so much, keep them coming.

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:17.489
And I’ll see you soon.
