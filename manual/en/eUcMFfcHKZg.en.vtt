00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:11.470
Hello boys and girls, this is Aunt Frenita and I have a wonderful story for you, called "Bitter Water to Better Water"

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:21.440
Today's memory verse is from Revelation 7:17. It says, “He will lead them to springs of living water.”

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:26.280
The message for today's story is "We thank God for giving us water"

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:28.910
Have you ever been thirsty?

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:32.920
I mean, really, really, really thirsty?

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:39.140
Well, a long time ago, the children of Israel were so thirsty they thought they would die of thirst.

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:46.260
The Israelites rejoiced as the great pillar of cloud led them out of Egypt and away from their lives of slavery.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.090
They followed as it led them across the Red Sea and out into the wilderness. 

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:57.960
But after three days of walking in the desert, the Israelites had used up all the water they brought with them from Egypt.

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.960
The children were thirsty.

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:01.580
The grown-ups were thirsty.

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:03.580
The animals were thirsty.

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:08.930
Everyone in the whole camp of Israel was very, very thirsty.

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:12.410
The cloud led them toward a place called Marah.

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:17.630
Moses had been a shepherd in the wilderness for 40 years, and he knew the area well.

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:25.580
Moses knew there was water at Marah, but he also knew it tasted so bad that the people wouldn’t be able to drink it.

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:28.740
In fact, the word Marah meant “bitter.”

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:33.510
But the people didn’t know that. As soon as they saw the water, they grew excited.

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:37.330
“Water! Water! There’s water up ahead!”

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.190
Some of the people ran forward to the water,

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:42.190
but when they tasted it,

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:44.680
their happiness turned to disappointment.

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:50.350
Now the people felt even thirstier than they had before they saw the bitter water.

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:54.220
They began to grumble and complain to Moses.

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:57.490
Moses knew that God had not left His people.

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:00.330
He knew that God would take care of their needs.

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:03.040
So Moses prayed to God and asked for help,

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:05.350
and God told Moses what to do.

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:10.000
He told Moses to find a piece of wood and throw the wood into the water.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.850
Moses did as God said, and the water turned sweet.

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:17.420
Once again the people rushed forward to the water.

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.050
This time they were not disappointed.

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:24.650
They drank all they wanted of the cool sweet water.

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:29.720
Children, grown-ups, and animals drank all the water they wanted.

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.990
God had worked a miracle to care for their needs,

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:36.430
including their great need for water in the desert.

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:40.250
They thanked and praised God for caring for them.

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:45.140
God cares for our needs, just as He did for the Israelites, way back then.

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:50.020
He makes sure that we have water and food and a safe place to sleep.

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:54.070
He gives us families and friends and air to breathe.

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:59.630
We may not always get everything we want, but God makes sure we have what we need.

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:02.970
Let’s thank God for taking care of our needs.
