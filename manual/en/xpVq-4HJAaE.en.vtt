00:00:10.289 --> 00:00:13.859
Tell me about

00:00:13.859 --> 00:00:14.780
Turkish music

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:16.740
and the rest of the world.

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.449
How do Turkish recieve

00:00:19.449 --> 00:00:22.599
the music from the rest of the world

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:25.599
and how does Turkish music go in to the rest of the world.

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:28.319
Well actually

00:00:28.319 --> 00:00:30.169
the Turkish music

00:00:30.169 --> 00:00:35.400
there's a huge history and culture
underneath it. As you know Anatolia

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.790
is a mixture of different cultures and
it definitely reflects into the

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.770
music produced in Anatolia.

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:48.770
We have influences from all over the world. Including Middle East, Balkans, even Far East, from Greece

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:55.790
All these different influences combine and it makes up a very unique sound

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:57.110
which is actually very unique to Anatolia.

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:58.920
and uhm

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.430
and it's also very much open for improvisation, very much open to poetic lyrics.

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:05.960
And uhm

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.800
as i say there is a huge enormous
culture in Turkish music and it's also very much open to

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:11.850
modern

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.480
sounds too.

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:16.760
The Turkish musicians nowadays

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:18.700
they receive a lot of influence from

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.350
other types of Western music and I think it's because of the

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:28.710
festivals and other live performances and digital music industry that

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:32.330
music interaction between different musical forms is

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:39.330
more efficient nowadays.
