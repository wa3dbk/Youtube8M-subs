For different pageants, there are different
swimsuit styles. If it's a traditional pageant,

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:15.829
they often acquire a full piece swimsuit,
but if it's sort of a modern pageant, they

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:26.019
usually acquire bikinis. You should have a
variety of bikinis and swimsuits with you,

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:32.169
to pick the color and the style, that the
others don't have, if you can wear your own,

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:37.850
but often the pageant gives you a bikini,
so that you're all wearing the same. Like

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:46.180
any clothes, you should pick bikinis that
flatter your body,and that the color flatters

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:53.540
your complexion. If you're worried about your
body, you should pick a swimsuit that you

00:00:53.540 --> 00:01:01.050
feel comfortable in, that it's not too revealing.
If it's a pageant with bikinis, you can consider

00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:10.691
sarongs, different scarves, if that's allowed.
One good tip to make your body shine in a

00:01:10.691 --> 00:01:16.470
swimsuit, is to apply lotion on your legs,
and arms, and stomach, so that light reflects

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:22.670
it, and it shines. For paler girls, I recommend
fake tan. You can go into the solarium, or

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:27.490
apply fake tan creams, but you should be careful
with those, because they can be quite uneven,

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:34.640
if you don't have experience putting them
on. I recommend bold colors, or in any case,

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:42.100
something that the others are not wearing,
and something that looks good on your skin.

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:49.200
If you're quite busty, you can pretty much
get away with any of the bikini tops. You

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:55.500
can wear something without padding, and it
will still look good. If you're not that well

00:01:55.500 --> 00:02:04.540
endowed, you might want to go for a push up
bikini top, so you can add padding under it

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:13.829
even, and no one will notice that. Bikini
bottoms should match the top, obviously, but

00:02:13.829 --> 00:02:21.450
mainly just appropriate. I say always be appropriate.
I recommend bikini bottoms like this, because

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:28.550
they make your legs appear longer, as opposed
to bikini bottoms that come all the way down

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:39.200
to the thigh, because they kind of shorten
your leg, and you shouldn't wear g- strings.

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:46.969
Normally, it's frowned upon. Maybe it's not
forbidden, but it's usually frowned upon.

00:02:46.969 --> 00:02:52.319
If it's a modeling pageant, it might not be,
but I say, double check. It's better to be

00:02:52.319 --> 00:03:01.059
on the safe side, than to be a bit more brave.
It's not considered a good thing, and that's

00:03:01.059 --> 00:03:03.459
how you pick bikinis for pageant.
