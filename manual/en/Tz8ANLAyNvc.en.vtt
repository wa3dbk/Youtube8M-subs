My name is Bridget Beaz and I am Gina Habba.
On behalf of expertvillage.com in this clip

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:13.599
we will be talking about body treatment. If
you would like to know more about facials

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:23.260
and our other services please contact us at
Bridget 310-432-6671 or Gina at 818-633-2396.

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:32.120
We don’t want to ignore the body, it is
one part that people tend to neglect, our

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:36.390
arms and our hands are exposed to more UV
radiation probably than any other part of

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:43.571
our body. So it is important to use products
that will help to minimize your risks of skin

00:00:43.571 --> 00:00:49.890
damage and sun damage. So we have three products
that we use. We use a Dermalac which is an

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:55.560
alphahydroxy product that helps to soften
the outer layer and at the same time it facilitates

00:00:55.560 --> 00:01:01.469
the penetration of the vitamin A. So we have
two different body products that can be used

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:05.960
to treat the skin in the vitamin form and
Bridget will diagnose your skin and let you

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:13.920
know which one is applicable to your situation.
So my recommendation of course would be to

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:20.390
use those products like every day and every
night and more over after a shower because

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:24.799
we all know that in water there is a lot of
chlorine and we don’t want, you know chlorine

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:33.799
just will ruin your skin. So I would use of
course body cream with SPF-16 with also of

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:41.840
course vitamin A and at night I would apply
the alphahydroxy Dermalac lotion, which really

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:49.230
prepares your skin to get all the nutriments
from the vitamin A that you can also find

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:56.179
of course is essential which is a highly concentration
of vitamin A is going to restore your skin.
