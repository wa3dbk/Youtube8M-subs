00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:05.000
Teknavi 2015 presents:

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:08.220
Test driver, Markku Alén.

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:13.040
Navigator and journalist, Marko Terva-Aho.

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:16.560
And the Bugatti Veyron Grandsport Vitesse Roadster.

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:42.460
My dear friend, Markku.

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.940
We are about to delve into
such extremes I'm nervous already.

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:50.060
What does the master think?

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:52.340
I say we've got a rocket on our hands.

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:56.080
Four colorful years with car extrodinaire
Alén.

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.480
Over sixty vehicles.

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:05.540
Extraordinary scenery.

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:10.320
Facts.

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.160
A hundred more HP and all that
then it would be good.

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:14.500
Beside the facts.

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:18.820
- Cool! Really cool! Let's skate!
- What...?

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:27.840
Italy, Germany, Dubai, England, San Marino,
Switzerland, Poland, Abu Dhabi.

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:31.080
This is our ninth season.

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.800
We begin with the most powerful 
factory made convertible ever.

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:41.400
This is a 1200-HP, 8 litre motor
with 4 turbos.

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:46.180
That's a record for us.
We've had 2 and 3 but never 4.

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:52.180
Maybe we'll beat the Teknavi record of 316km/h.
- We're aiming for the Ivalo record?

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:54.240
Yes thats our target.

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:58.480
Everything is special about it.
Lets drive first, then talk.

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:03.100
I wish you a good day.
Thanks you too.

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.080
Molsheim, France.

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.700
A population of 10 000.

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:15.300
The towns pride and joy,
Bugatti's history started here over 100 years ago.

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:20.020
The main office and construction line
are still situated here.

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:25.700
Before we delve into the history,
here's a piece of Bugatti today.

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:31.600
Before our test drive,-
the winner of the 24h Le Mans -

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:35.340
Andy Wallace showed us
the Convertible Sport Veyron.

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:10.860
In production since 2005.
There are only 450 and no more in sight.

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:15.120
300 coupé models
and 150 convertibles.

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:15.460
The 10 year history of the Veyron
began with 16.4 model.

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:19.880
The name came from the 16 cylinders
and 4 turbos.

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:24.900
The 2010 Veyron Supersport
was one mean machine.

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:31.900
The Supersport broke the record
for coupé model cars.

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:37.380
Clocking in at 431.72km per hour.

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:43.060
The most recent of the 6 part Legend series
is the Vitesse.

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:47.120
This holds the record
for production line convertibles.

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:50.340
With 408.84km per hour.

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:53.620
All Veyrons are mechanically the same.

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:57.220
The same motor, gearbox and 4-wheel drive.

00:04:57.220 --> 00:04:59.520
The only improvements are the power.

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:06.400
Enjoy!

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:11.920
I'm going to see and admire the history 
of Bugatti.

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:17.500
The car extrodinaires hit the road,
and the journalist hits the books.

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:59.920
It's kind of like a Hornet taking off.
It feels the same.
