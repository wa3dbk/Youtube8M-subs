00:00:15.602 --> 00:00:18.402
"What are you doin'? I'll pick you up in 5' "

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.360
Oh no! 5 more minutes? What to wear?

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:34.439
How about the chillin kinda look

00:00:34.439 --> 00:00:38.059
No , that's not gonna work. It might look like 2 dudes hang out together

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:42.000
Ah,kinda posh isn't it?

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:46.340
but too much :(

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:51.360
Or maybe...

00:00:53.578 --> 00:00:55.498
This might work. Let's start

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:05.140
It's really dry in winter so i use moisterizer before make up

00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:12.000
I use Make up forever HD Foundation

00:01:12.824 --> 00:01:16.264
The foundation is light,smooth,and perfect cover

00:01:16.264 --> 00:01:19.315
it helps the make up to stay on all day hanging out

00:01:19.315 --> 00:01:23.955
If the foundation is too bright, you can mix it with lower tone foundation

00:01:28.818 --> 00:01:30.418
Next,use the concealer

00:01:30.418 --> 00:01:32.176
Many tones for you too choose

00:01:32.176 --> 00:01:34.634
cover your dark circles,canards and acnes

00:01:34.688 --> 00:01:40.368
You could use lighter tone concealer on dark circles for blemish cover and highlight

00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:53.340
To finish clear foundation, I choose Seatree art UV Cut Powder

00:01:53.340 --> 00:01:56.260
This is the light glow powder

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.020
After that,line simple eyebrows

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:05.720
Remember that eyebrows color must match hair color

00:02:17.025 --> 00:02:18.945
I use light glow peach orange

00:02:18.945 --> 00:02:22.585
Apply it carefully to create the shining effect to the eyelids

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.040
It's the trend this year

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.360
Next,use pink eyeshadow lightly apply to the canthus

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:34.400
and cover the top of eyelids

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:35.940
Blend two colors together

00:02:57.113 --> 00:03:01.353
Don't forget to highlight with glowing white on your waterline

00:03:09.326 --> 00:03:11.806
I really love the RIMMEL LONDON liner

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:14.780
It's waterproof, thin line

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:19.440
Apply a thin line on the canthus to keep the lovely look

00:03:32.099 --> 00:03:34.339
let's use the curler and mascara!

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:38.840
Choose the thin mascara

00:03:44.507 --> 00:03:46.427
We can't miss the highlights

00:03:46.427 --> 00:03:48.885
This time i use highlights with ligh glow pink

00:03:48.885 --> 00:03:50.915
Apply it on eyelids,nose brigde and forehead

00:04:10.753 --> 00:04:12.833
We can use eyeshadow as shading

00:04:12.833 --> 00:04:15.133
Lightly brush it on cheeks and canards

00:04:22.315 --> 00:04:23.595
Use lips concealer

00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:26.520
Then use #10 SEATREE ART LIPSTICK

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:27.181
which is bland baby pink

00:04:39.589 --> 00:04:41.989
Add a little blushing and we're done

00:04:50.148 --> 00:04:53.348
Fix your hair and ready to hangout with " the one"
