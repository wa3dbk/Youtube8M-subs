00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:05.610
In a past where I spoke of nothing but ideals

00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.740
Walls stood in my way at every turn

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:12.910
So I lived on, fumbling along!

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:29.160
The red sky stretches out my shadow;

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:33.400
It's still so unreliable and selfish -

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.940
I can't help but sigh.

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:40.510
Even if our strides are different and our breaths out of sync,

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:43.680
You always force your way straight through,

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:46.380
To be by my side.

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:51.790
When I stopped to look at what I'd missed, I was simply left behind!

00:00:52.090 --> 00:00:55.760
"Do you have your eyes on tomorrow?"

00:00:55.960 --> 00:01:07.170
I heard your voice, dispelling the darkness!

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:09.700
Even if I'm weak, I’m going to take a stand -

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.300
You gave me a reason to do so!

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:16.540
I understand now, that’s why I’m going.

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.980
It's still tough, and there’s pain in my chest,

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:22.620
But you gave me strength!

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:27.720
In order to keep this safe, I’m going!

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:42.670
Always losing, with nothing to protect anyway,

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:45.970
I lose my confidence and abandon this game,

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:48.640
Spilling out excuses...

00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:53.080
Then out of nowhere a voice pierces my ears -

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:56.350
In a fed up voice, you’re saying,

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:59.050
"Just force your way straight through!"

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:04.460
And when we touch, you came running into my heart with your shoes still on -

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:08.460
"You'll be the one to decide what happens tomorrow!"

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:19.770
Your voice, dispelling the darkness, was “crying”.

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:22.310
I'll simply wipe those tears away -

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.910
I've made up my own reason!

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:29.220
I understand now, that’s why I’m going.

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:32.620
I still get scared sometimes and trip up;

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:35.390
I'm actually shaking.

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:40.130
In order to take you back, I’m gonna fight!

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:41.730
"Stand up and face it."

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.200
"I'm not scared."

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:44.530
"You're here."

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:45.830
"I'm right here."

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:47.000
"Wait for me."

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:48.400
"No problem."

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:49.740
"I won't lose."

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:50.270
"I believe it."

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:53.510
So step on in and start moving forward -

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:58.210
Laugh until you're heard!

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:20.600
A screaming voice that just won't come out

00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:23.240
is trembling within my chest.

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:27.610
I get it now, that’s why I’m gonna fight.

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:31.010
I'm not alone now - my chest feels so hot;

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:33.710
You gave me this strength!

00:03:33.710 --> 00:03:39.250
In order to keep this safe, I’m gonna fight!

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:52.100
I'm smiling with you here again.
