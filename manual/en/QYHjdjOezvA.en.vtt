Hi welcome to to another video. In this video
I’m going to share with you three beach

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:11.950
safety tips.

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:17.949
#1 RipTide or I should say rip current
Every year 80% of water rescues are due to

00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:18.949
rip currents.

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:23.520
When does rip currents form? Rip currents
form under most tide and it can move slowly

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:30.080
but can increase the speeds become dangerous
to anything entering the surf and are most

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:31.830
dangerous during high surf

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:37.710
Where does rip currents form? It form at low
spots or breaks in sandbars, and also near

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:43.620
jetties and Rip currents can be very narrow
but extend in widths to hundreds of yards

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:44.730
or more. What happens?

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:49.920
currents comes towards the beach and then
pull back down to the ocean

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.750
if you keep swimming forward the current will
pull you further into the ocean

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:00.340
what do you need to do to get out of the rip
current? The only way to get out of rip current

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:07.369
is to swim sideways away from the rip current.
Swim to the right or to the left away from

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:08.530
the current

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:16.490
#2 Do not bury yourself or anyone in the sand
Why? well! Digging hole is fun at the beach

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:22.090
but you should be aware of sand caving in.
Sand can be heavier than what you think and

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:28.170
when you move in the sand the sand tightens
up on you and it prevent you from moving .There

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.380
has been quit a few incident around the country
on sand caving in

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:38.200
When the earth shakes from others walking
or running close by or when the sea water

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.640
washes up where you are buried

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:46.840
The sand tightens up the and you will get
stuck and might even cause death due to suffocation.

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:52.880
What do you need to do when this happen? And
when it happens DO NOT all jump in to dig

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:57.040
the sand out WHY? because it will cause more
sand to collapse. SOLUTION just have one person

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:04.130
digging it out and the other people moving
the sand back away from the person in the

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:11.840
hole and this will help save and prevent more
sand caving into the person in the hole.

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:16.590
#3 Have good protection from the sun protection
from the sun is essential

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:23.410
having an umbrella is not good enough no a
days because it breaks easily like such and

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:25.310
look what the wind does to this one

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:32.140
Using a cabana /a shelter to protect yourself
and is an up and coming trend at the beach

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:37.680
and I think it's a good idea then having to
deal with the umbrella where you have to drill

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:46.680
a hole and tighten up the umbrella and have
to worry about the umbrella blown away by

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:54.659
the wind. With the cabana everything is nailed
and pinned down to the sand and provide better

00:02:54.659 --> 00:02:55.709
protection then the umbrella.

00:02:55.709 --> 00:02:59.909
Thank you very much for watching this is what
I hope it helps you to give you some idea
