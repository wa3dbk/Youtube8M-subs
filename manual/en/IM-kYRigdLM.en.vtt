Hi, this is Simon from Cryptex

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:22.840
we are here at the legendary Horus Sound Studios in Hannover 

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:25.240
to record our second album, called 'Madeleine Effect'.

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:45.180
In the last ten months, a lot of radical stuff happened to CRYPTEX somehow

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:46.220
but

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:50.880
looking back, one can say that it also brought along positive effects 

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:54.080
because i feel like this album,

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:57.960
the way it developed, the way it sounds,

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.020
possibly could only come up like this.

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:19.900
So the album is basically completed right now

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:24.820
but the last few important steps are missing to finalise the whole thing.

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.140
There is the key part, the mixing,

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:29.840
the mastering

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:34.260
and the reproduction costs in general, everything that belongs to create a copy of an album

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:36.620
and for that, we are lacking the financial resources

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.440
and that's where you guys out there come into play.

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:00.300
This campaign ist not just about donating,

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:02.700
because you also get something out of it.

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:07.680
We sat down and created lots of really cool 'thank you'-packages.

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:12.000
You can get exklusive fan packages, of course the album itself

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:14.240
livingroom concerts, for example

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:18.880
or some really exklusive material, like my scottish kilt

00:02:26.979 --> 00:02:29.439
What I'd also like to mention is

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.400
that nobody out there will run any financial risk.

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:34.740
So when you decided on a 'thank you'-package, 

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:37.280
the money will be administrated by a third party bank account,

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:43.820
and if the campaign will fail, all the money will go back to you. 

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:48.460
The next two and a half months will surely be exciting and we're looking forward to it.

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.660
The new album is going to be awesome

00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:55.720
and we're totally looking forward to present it live on stage to you guys,

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:57.460
to unleash this beast off its chains,

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:00.200
and, what can i say...

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:02.242
...we are back.
