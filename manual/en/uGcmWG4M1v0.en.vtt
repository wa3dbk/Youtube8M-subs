00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:03.439
Hello my name is Bob Strosin from Golden Eagle
Log Homes.

00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:06.140
Today, I'd like to talk to you about fireplaces.

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:11.070
On your Golden Eagle Log Home your fireplace
is included in the package, we also include

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:17.400
the hearth stone and we include the wire mesh,
the vapor barrier and the mortar.

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:19.260
Everything is included in that package.

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:24.220
Let's go out and see how easy it is to put
this cultured stone on.

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:29.080
We're going to put cultured stone on this
corner display, this is a saddle notch corner

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:35.269
display and normally on a house, the rim board
would be covered with the stepped 1" x 12",

00:00:35.269 --> 00:00:39.479
in this case however, we're going to upgrade
this to a cultured stone.

00:00:39.479 --> 00:00:45.390
Now, one thing we have to do in the bottom
of the log here is cut a saw kerf to slip

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.909
in a flashing.

00:00:47.909 --> 00:00:54.499
Again, the felt paper in this case, will be
the vapor barrier, the metal lathe is included

00:00:54.499 --> 00:00:56.839
and also the mortar is included.

00:00:56.839 --> 00:01:03.909
Now the first step we have to do here is take
our mortar and put a scratch coat over this

00:01:03.909 --> 00:01:05.080
wire mesh.

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:11.911
Again, we're pushing it into that metal lathe,
this doesn't have to be done pretty, it's

00:01:11.911 --> 00:01:18.250
just a scratch coat.

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:21.340
And we'll continue with this until we get
this all covered.

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:26.940
Now, once we have the scratch coat on, some
guys like to take a little piece of the screen

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:32.400
and just lightly rough it up, that way when
we come to put our stone on, it's a little

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:36.430
easier to adhese the stone to the scratch
coat.

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:42.260
Okay, again, we have our scratch coat on its
dried, now we're going to put the stone on,

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:47.090
I've already put the corners on, and the corners
look like this, they come in all different

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:48.900
sizes and colors.

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:54.180
I've got the corners on, it's a good idea
to lay some stone out on the floor, they come

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.240
in all kinds of different shapes, sizes and
colors and you're going to have to be able

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:59.550
to match it up.

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:13.530
And we're going to start out putting a piece
on here.

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:17.930
You don't want to get too much on but you
need to get enough for it to stick, what we're

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:24.389
going to do is push it into place here and
wiggle it around a little bit , pushing that

00:02:24.389 --> 00:02:26.959
mortar, filling all of the voids.

00:02:26.959 --> 00:02:33.969
And you usually have to hold it for a few
seconds.

00:02:33.969 --> 00:02:39.279
And we got our first stone on and we are going
to take our next stone and same thing.

00:02:39.279 --> 00:02:46.049
If you have a little excess mortar on your
stone here, when you hold it out, just kind

00:02:46.049 --> 00:02:49.279
of wipe it off.

00:02:49.279 --> 00:02:53.370
Be careful so you don't get a lot of mortar
on the face of the stone because that will

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:58.409
satin it and it will always be there.Again,
you just have to kind of look at your stones,

00:02:58.409 --> 00:03:10.249
try to find the size and shape and color that's
going to fit in there the best.

00:03:10.249 --> 00:03:19.019
There, putting cultured stone on is just as
easy as that.

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:23.219
Now, we're going to let this set, we're going
to come back tomorrow and we're going to grout

00:03:23.219 --> 00:03:25.950
in between all the stone.

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:31.889
Now, we have our cultured stone on, we let
that sit and dry for a day and now we're going

00:03:31.889 --> 00:03:33.659
to grout all the joints.

00:03:33.659 --> 00:03:38.599
And for this particular job, what we're going
to use just a grout bag they do make a electric

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:42.720
grouting machine, if you have a lot of grouting
to do, they're well worth the money, but for

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:49.060
this small project here, we're just going
to use a small grouting bag and this works

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:54.739
in the same process as a pastry bag for decorating
cakes.

00:03:54.739 --> 00:04:02.879
And what we're going to do is just squeeze
on the bag and grout in our stone.

00:04:02.879 --> 00:04:04.669
There.

00:04:04.669 --> 00:04:09.739
Now, we're going to let that set and dry for
a while and then we're going to come back

00:04:09.739 --> 00:04:11.379
and strike it off.

00:04:11.379 --> 00:04:16.630
Okay, now that we have let this set up a little
bit and the mud is a little bit stiffer, I'm

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:23.350
just going to take a stick and I'm going to
along and even out and push in the mud that

00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:25.760
I just put on with the grout bag.

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:31.230
All I'm doing is just kind of evening it out
a little bit, making sure there's no gaps

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:33.570
or holes.

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:38.400
When you're striking the joints off you don't
have to worry about getting it perfectly smooth.

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.800
If it's a little bit rough, that's not a problem.

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:44.410
What you're going to do is let that set up
again for a little bit longer, let it dry

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:52.730
a little bit more and then just take a brush
and lightly go over and brush your joints,

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:58.330
taking particular care that if you have any
mortar on your stone, make sure you wipe that

00:04:58.330 --> 00:05:01.410
off so it doesn't stain it.

00:05:01.410 --> 00:05:07.161
There, we have the stone all brushed off and
it looks great that's how we cover a rim,

00:05:07.161 --> 00:05:13.070
now, remember on your Golden Eagle log home,
not only your fireplace comes with the package

00:05:13.070 --> 00:05:18.920
but also the stone, the hearthstone, the wire
mesh, the vapor barrier and the mortar, and

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:20.850
as you can see it's very easy to put on.
