00:00:02.557 --> 00:00:04.392
"Cool not fool."

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:09.153
Not the best text you can come up with,
but it does apply to this Audi A1.

00:00:09.203 --> 00:00:12.000
It is an Audi, but a very small one.

00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:15.644
Let's see what we think about it,
I really don't know.

00:00:22.215 --> 00:00:25.913
It's a tricky car,
so we're not going to do this as usual;

00:00:26.116 --> 00:00:29.741
we're going to look for 5 plusses
and 5 drawbacks.

00:00:29.905 --> 00:00:32.311
The first plus is very clear.

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:36.761
It's the first superbudget-mini-primium,
or something like that.

00:00:36.812 --> 00:00:39.371
And this is the key.

00:00:39.397 --> 00:00:42.271
Look, the 4 rings are on there.

00:00:42.511 --> 00:00:44.431
So if you throw it on the bar...

00:00:44.504 --> 00:00:52.073
...you'll certainly be surrounded
by lots of women.

00:00:52.164 --> 00:00:55.115
But there comes a time that
you want to drive it.

00:00:55.125 --> 00:00:57.564
Let's see if it's still that good then.

00:01:03.468 --> 00:01:09.917
A drawback is that it isn't very cheap...

00:01:10.286 --> 00:01:12.706
...if you buy it as you'd want it.

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:14.921
It starts at 17,500 grand.

00:01:15.205 --> 00:01:19.432
Of course that is much more expensive
than the Polo and the Fabia it's based on...

00:01:19.471 --> 00:01:22.920
...because it's their premium brother.

00:01:23.194 --> 00:01:28.189
But you'll have to drive the base version
with its windows down all the time...

00:01:28.498 --> 00:01:29.871
...because it doesn't have aircon.

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.476
And an aircon costs 1.525 euro.

00:01:33.742 --> 00:01:38.098
But the Pro Line package,
which includes aircon, costs only 1.500 euro...

00:01:38.112 --> 00:01:40.709
...and that also includes
leather things and other stuff.

00:01:40.756 --> 00:01:45.091
So that's some weird pricing from Audi.

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:48.400
And now we're talking about this car,
I've done some calculations...

00:01:48.494 --> 00:01:51.404
...and I think this one costs about 40 grand.

00:01:52.154 --> 00:01:53.404
Forty!

00:01:54.085 --> 00:01:55.685
And that is quite a drawback.

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:01.350
On the one hand this A1 is a real Audi...

00:02:01.392 --> 00:02:04.390
...but on the other you
can't expect such a small car...

00:02:04.405 --> 00:02:08.353
...to deliver the same comfort
as an A6 or an A8, it's just much smaller.

00:02:08.395 --> 00:02:14.993
It's much lighter so you'll have to use
a different setup for the suspension.

00:02:15.879 --> 00:02:18.744
If you compare it to other Audis,
it's quite wobbly.

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:20.800
And if you compare it to
other cars in its class...

00:02:20.915 --> 00:02:24.561
...it's a nice balance
between comfort and sportiness.

00:02:25.842 --> 00:02:29.034
It doesn't drive badly, so that's also a plus.

00:02:47.905 --> 00:02:50.862
Another plus it that you can park
a small car like this one everywhere...

00:02:50.956 --> 00:02:51.886
...here for example.

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:00.570
It does stick out a little.

00:03:01.475 --> 00:03:02.874
That's a drawback.

00:03:03.118 --> 00:03:06.677
Until the S1 comes,
this is the fastest, the 1.4 TSI.

00:03:06.714 --> 00:03:10.032
So let's try to make little burnout.

00:03:10.166 --> 00:03:14.427
It's nice and dusty here, so I'll close my window
and everything should be fine.

00:03:22.439 --> 00:03:23.877
That's a plus.

00:03:24.955 --> 00:03:30.440
This is my knee. I left my other knee outside
because it didn't fit anymore.

00:03:31.126 --> 00:03:34.954
It is a plus that it's pretty clean.

00:03:35.044 --> 00:03:36.409
Only green labels.

00:03:36.513 --> 00:03:38.718
And all versions fall within a low tax level.

00:03:39.164 --> 00:03:43.487
But it's only just a plus, because there is
no version that falls within the lowest tax level.

00:03:43.672 --> 00:03:48.690
There is no A1 1.2 TDI yet,
and we don't know if it ever will.

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:51.350
All we know is that there is none.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.282
Maybe this is a personal drawback...

00:03:56.298 --> 00:04:01.402
...but the looks don't drive me wild.

00:04:01.751 --> 00:04:04.800
Especially with the contrasting roof arches...

00:04:04.996 --> 00:04:07.913
...it's a weird round car.

00:04:08.324 --> 00:04:10.796
It's profile doesn't look nice.

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:13.807
The rear is quite meaty and big...

00:04:13.888 --> 00:04:15.360
...and the front is typical Audi.

00:04:15.367 --> 00:04:18.560
But it's front front quarter
and side are just ugly.

00:04:22.469 --> 00:04:25.674
Behind the wheel you really get the feeling
you're driving an Audi.

00:04:25.739 --> 00:04:31.500
The materials, the finish,
the way you control things. It's all right.

00:04:31.835 --> 00:04:35.069
The colors of this one are quite boring...

00:04:35.187 --> 00:04:37.871
...but there's also a Cappuccino-version.

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:40.600
And that just looks very nice.

00:04:42.525 --> 00:04:44.991
And this interior fits my food.

00:04:45.486 --> 00:04:47.366
That's a plus!

00:04:47.999 --> 00:04:54.444
We're really thinking about it,
but we really can't think of a fifth drawback.

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:57.166
There is none.

00:04:58.573 --> 00:05:03.345
That makes this car the ideal
birthday present for your girlfriend.

00:05:03.595 --> 00:05:05.599
She'll be very happy with it.

00:05:05.895 --> 00:05:09.289
Or if you're a
not very successful account manager...

00:05:09.385 --> 00:05:12.450
...you can exchange your basic A3
with plastic wheel covers...

00:05:12.457 --> 00:05:15.328
...for an A1 with alloy wheels.

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:19.294
And if you don't sweat very quickly
you can order the S-line package...

00:05:19.306 --> 00:05:20.500
...and leave the aircon.

00:05:20.904 --> 00:05:22.033
That saves you 1.500 euro.

00:05:42.754 --> 00:05:47.164
They say it can top 124 mph
so I have to try it.

00:05:47.689 --> 00:05:51.964
So if you never see me again, that's because
I'm still trying to make the top speed.
