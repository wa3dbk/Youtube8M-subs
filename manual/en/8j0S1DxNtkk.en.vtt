00:00:00.909 --> 00:00:06.279
South America is well known for it's Colourful
Carnivals and one of the great places to experience

00:00:06.279 --> 00:00:13.900
this is in Montevideo, the capital of Uruguay.

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:19.180
Carnival is widely celebrated throughout the
country but the big parties can be found in

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:20.180
Montevideo.

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:24.050
Carnival is celebrated during January and
February each year.

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:27.960
One of the main highlights during the Carnival
season is known as "llamadas".

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.320
This takes place in the streets of the Palermo
and Sur districts of Montevideo, and is usually

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:36.190
held in early February.

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:41.260
Participants come from all over the country
to enjoy the sights and sounds of CandombÃ©.

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:55.100
This is a drum-based rhythm and dance which
originated among the Afro-Uruguayan population.

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:59.769
Groups taking part are made up of drummers
and dancers, all dressed up in colourful clothes

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:00.769
and facepaint.

00:01:00.769 --> 00:01:05.540
The groups are judged in various categories
including drumming and dancing abilities.

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:10.320
The Carnival is loud and vibrant, with people
enjoying the festive party atmosphere.

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:16.020
The entertainment starts early evening going
on until late.

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:18.830
It is best to arrive early to get a good spot.

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:23.670
You can stand or pay for a ticket in one of
the seated areas that are spread along the

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:24.670
route.

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:32.450
Now, If you happened to be in Buenos Aires,
Argentina, during Carnival season, you can

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:37.530
easily cross over the Rio de la Plata to Montevideo
by Ferry.

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.220
We would recommend staying at least a few
days in Montevideo not only to enjoy Carnival

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:50.360
but also the beautiful city itself.
