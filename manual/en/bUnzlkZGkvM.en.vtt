Hi, this is Kevin Patton I have another study
tip for human anatomy and physiology. This

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:14.070
time it's regarding muscles and how muscle
names can be a shortcut to learning the muscles,

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:19.680
where they're at, and what they do. You probably
have been given a list by your instructor

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:25.840
as to what muscles you need to be able to
identify or maybe it's a list that's In your

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:30.140
lab manual. In any case, once you look at
all those muscle names, it looks like a lot

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:33.540
of gibberish, doesn't it? It look like it's
written a foreign language. Well, you know

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:40.540
what? It is. Even English versions of these
muscle names are derived from Latin. And that's

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:44.280
something that's very useful to know. You
might think it's a hindrance, but actually

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.550
it's a help. Let's take a look at this group
of muscles that are adductor muscles, that

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:54.530
is, they have the word adductor in their name.
And, as you can imagine, these are muscles

00:00:54.530 --> 00:01:00.730
that do adduction. That is, they adduct, in
this case the femur, by bending the hip joint

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:07.520
and bringing the the leg toward the midline,
or the median plane, of the body. Now the

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:13.250
first one we have shown there is in green
and is called adductor magnus. Adductor means

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:17.781
it's an adductor muscle, of course, and magnus
is the Latin word for great or large and you

00:01:17.781 --> 00:01:22.290
can see it's a very large muscle. We can't
really see the whole thing in this view because

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:26.670
there are a couple other muscles in the way.
As a matter of fact, those muscles are adductor

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.970
muscles as well. For example, the one highlighted
in yellow now is is adductor brevis and brevis

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:37.190
is a Latin word that means brief or short.
And, as you can see, it is very short compared

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:41.180
to adductor magnus, isn't it?. When we look
at the third one with adductor in its name,

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:46.360
and it's adductor longus and, well, as you
can imagine, longus means long. And so it's

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:51.320
longer than brevis and of course magnus is
really huge compared to all of them. So we

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:56.100
have three different abductor muscles all
very close to one another. And so how do you

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:01.180
tell them apart? Well, their names! One is
very big, one is short, and one is long. Now

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:05.741
one weird thing about Latin, you probably
already noticed, is the words seem to the

00:02:05.741 --> 00:02:10.590
words seem to be backwards in the phrase.
Let's take a closer look at that. In English,

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:17.620
when we have a phrase like red wagon, in Latin
it would be rendered as wagon red instead,

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.150
of course using Latin words, not English words.
But this is to show the word order. So there

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:27.939
is a different word order these two languages.
And so the modifier, which is the adjective,

00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:35.900
in this case red, is modifying a noun. Which
in this case is wagon. And so the modifier

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:41.150
comes after the term that it modifies in Latin,
which is backwards from English. Let's look

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:48.080
at another example. Big red wagon. In Latin,
that would be rendered as wagon red big. And

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:53.980
so the modifiers come after the terms being
modified. So let's apply that to one of these

00:02:53.980 --> 00:03:01.799
Latin names like, ooh, here's a long one:
extensor carpi radialis brevis. That sounds

00:03:01.799 --> 00:03:07.319
like a mouthful but it's really kind of a
whole phrase or sentence in Latin. An extensor,

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:14.879
of course, is going to extend a part, that
is, stretch it out. And carpi means of the

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:20.199
wrist. Remember carpal bones, or the wrist
bones. Radialis in this case means pertaining

00:03:20.199 --> 00:03:25.909
to, or near, or at the radius bone of the
forearm. And then brevis, we already know,

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:30.590
means short. So if we put that all together
and translate it into a good English word

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:36.760
order, it means the short wrist stretcher
at the radius. Which tells you an awful lot

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:44.409
about that muscle: where to find it and what
is does. Now there are some other names of

00:03:44.409 --> 00:03:50.349
muscles that are not whole phrases but describe
some aspect of the muscle. Like the gracilis

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:58.239
muscle shown here. We see it's a muscle that
is a long slender muscle. And that's what

00:03:58.239 --> 00:04:05.150
the term gracilis means is slender. So the
gracilis muscle is the slender muscle. Another

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:10.019
mnemonic device that you might be able to
use is graceful: it's a long slender graceful

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:16.470
muscle. Here's another one with kind of an
odd name but, when translated into Latin,

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:23.670
make a lot of sense. The buccinator or BUK-sin-ay-ter
muscle is a muscle of the cheek and it's called

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:28.530
the trumpeter muscle. And that's because when
you are blowing a trumpet, you really need

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:34.040
to use this muscle to compress the air in
your mouth and thus push it to and through

00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:41.400
the trumpet. Now where are you gonna learn
all this stuff? Maybe you haven't taken a

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:47.150
Latin class, probably haven't taken a Latin
class, or two or three. And so, you know,

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:54.481
how are you gonna figure this out? Well, I
suggest the Survival Guide for Anatomy and

00:04:54.481 --> 00:05:00.700
Physiology. And if you use this little link
here, you can type that into your browser

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:05.890
and get to a description of that book. And
not only do I explain how to do this but I

00:05:05.890 --> 00:05:12.870
give you some tables on how to do the translation.
And a free resource that you can download

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:19.770
yourself is a this list of muscle names that
you can download from my site at lionden.com

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:27.350
and so here's the URL for that. So type that
your browser and you can download a couple

00:05:27.350 --> 00:05:32.440
different versions of my muscle name list
that has the translation of the name of at

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:38.300
least some of the major muscles, not ever
muscle in the body. That, and other, study

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:44.150
tips are always available for you at my blog,
which is found at theAPstudent.org
