00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.009
Martin Luther King Jr. dreamed of a world
where people are judged by their character

00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:05.990
not by the color of their skin.

00:00:05.990 --> 00:00:08.260
And how wonderful would a color-blind world
be?

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:10.900
But what about people who are literally blind?

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:14.599
Do they still judge people based on their
race?

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:19.690
Hey everyone, Julia here for DNews.

00:00:19.690 --> 00:00:24.110
Osagie K. Obasogie, a law professor at the
University of California, Hastings, sought

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:28.410
to understand how a person who is blind would
understand the concept of race.

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.320
In groundbreaking research published in the
book Blinded By Sight, he conducted over

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:36.820
100 interviews with people of various ages
and backgrounds, all of whom have been blind

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:37.820
since birth.

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:42.379
Obasogie asked the subjects how they define
race, what their first memory of it was, how

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:46.050
their family would respond if they dated or
married outside of their race, among other

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.050
things.

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:48.520
And he found some surprising results.

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:52.649
“Blind people understand race just like
everyone else, they understand it visually.

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.149
So if you ask a blind person ‘What is race?’

00:00:54.149 --> 00:00:59.280
They’re more likely to refer to various
visual cues, such as skin color, facial features,

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:00.890
things of that nature.”

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:03.710
The fact that they use “visual” traits
seems like a surprise.

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:07.320
It’s widely known that blind people do have
a better sense of touch.

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:10.870
But according to a different study published
in the Journal of Neuroscience by researchers

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:12.120
at McMaster University,

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:16.120
it’s not because their brains rewire to
compensate for the lack of sight.

00:01:16.120 --> 00:01:19.670
Instead, they show that it’s simple practice
that enhances their sense of touch.

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:20.670
[1]

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.720
Some people do take into account other features,
like scent and touch, but only secondarily.

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:29.090
And even though you might assume blind individuals
use voice as a proxy for someone’s race,

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.310
Obasogie found that wasn’t the case.

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:34.840
Many of them were distrustful of using voice
because they’ve been wrong so many times

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:35.840
before.

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.000
Another interesting finding was

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.180
that blind people experience the same racial
prejudice as those with sight.

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:42.340
Many of the respondents pointed to

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:46.690
interactions in their childhood or adolescence
that shaped their views on race.

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:50.460
Those around them, like parents and friends
reinforced social boundaries.

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:54.180
Some had parents that refused to let them
play with people of a different race.

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:58.740
Obasogie also learned that some blind individuals
specifically seek out information about a

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:59.930
person’s race.

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:02.670
And this information makes a profound difference
to them.

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.250
Some respondents said it made interaction
easier, that way they wouldn’t say something

00:02:06.250 --> 00:02:09.369
stupid in front of someone of a difference
race.

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:12.600
Others used this information as a distinguisher
for dating purposes.

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:16.400
If they were attracted to someone but then
found out they were a different race, they

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.599
would change their behavior towards them.

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:23.030
his research suggests that race has less to
do with what we see, and more to do with what

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:24.030
we’re taught.

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:29.180
Society teaches us to mark the physical differences
as significant, and to make certain associations

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:30.359
from those differences.

00:02:30.359 --> 00:02:34.640
So yes, even the blind are socialized to see
race, just like we all are.

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:39.620
But by talking to blind people, Obasogie believes
we can get a true understanding of how strong

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.800
that socialization practice is.

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:46.250
A big thanks to the University of California’s

You can learn a whole lot more from Fig. 1
