00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:02.640
I'm Camille Luong.

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:04.640
I'm running for student body president.

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:10.900
I'm only 13 years old, but I'm a serious person.

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:16.000
So, I'm not running for office to talk about adding vending machines or to complain about cafeteria food.

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:19.020
I take on REAL issues.

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:22.400
Issues that affect your everyday well-being.

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:25.000
Issues that affect your FUTURE.

00:00:26.940 --> 00:00:32.700
The reason that I and X other students are even running for executive office at all this year

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:35.200
is because over the summer

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:38.700
I-- singlehandedly

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:41.400
approached our beloved administrators

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:43.000
and convinced them

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:46.000
to establish a REAL student government

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:50.500
with offices of president, vice president, and treasurer

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:54.500
If I can do that for you BEFORE you elect me,

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:57.800
imagine what I could do for you AFTER you put me into office.

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:10.400
[applause]

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:20.680
Every day,

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:22.680
hundreds of you

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.680
stress over getting to class on time

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:27.580
without running-- or being caught running.

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.860
It take FOUR AND A HALF MINUTES

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:33.540
to walk from one end of the school

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:36.280
to the other end of the school.

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:43.400
And that's assuming you start walking from outside your classroom when the bell rings.

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:47.000
Add 30 seconds fighting the crowd inside your classroom

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.000
to make it OUT THE DOOR-

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.260
and you're tardy.

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:53.860
(unless you run)

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.000
Add 30 seconds being stuck behind traffic

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
going downstairs-

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:01.180
and you're tardy.

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.720
(unless you run)

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.400
Add two minutes going to the restroom-

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:08.400
and you're tardy-

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:10.920
even IF you run!

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:20.900
[crowd buzzing]

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.720
Oh, wait...

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.700
but we're not ALLOWED to run..

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:31.700
They tell us to do something,

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.700
yet at the same time they make it impossible for us to do it.

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.100
It's like, your mom tells you to walk home in the rain,

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:39.500
but at the same time,

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.500
not get your shoes wet.

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.000
As YOUR class president, I will promise EACH AND EVERY ONE OF YOU [that]

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:48.480
I will NOT allow them to do this to you.

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:52.100
As YOUR class president, I will PLAN, STRATEGIZE, FIGHT

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:54.600
to add that crucial minute to the current bell time!

00:02:56.280 --> 00:03:09.200
[applause]

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:19.000
But the most important thing that I'd like to accomplish

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:23.000
is to establish a sense of community,

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.000
a sense of togetherness,

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:28.140
a sense of school pride.

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:31.140
And one way to do it

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:34.100
is to bring us all together at assemblies like this one here today.

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:40.100
Of course we have events like plays, musical performances, and basketball games...

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:43.900
but those events happen AFTER school,

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:46.900
and you have to PAY to attend.

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:52.900
As YOUR class president, I will make these events happen DURING school, rather than after--

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:55.880
in assemblies like this one.

00:03:56.440 --> 00:03:57.400
But most importantly,

00:03:57.820 --> 00:03:59.820
I will make them FREE!!

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:10.800
[instant applause]

00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:19.100
[crowd buzzing]

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:28.200
I'm gonna work with teachers and administrators

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:31.200
to put together school-wide assemblies for a variety of things.

00:04:32.100 --> 00:04:34.100
I'll work to arrange school-wide pep rallies

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:36.100
that we'll watch DURING the school day

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:39.260
in assemblies like this one,

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:41.900
where important announcements are made,

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:43.900
and where we can have FUN cheering for our teams.

00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:47.700
I'll work with chorus, band, and drama teachers

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:50.700
to arrange performances that we'll watch DURING the school day

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:53.780
in assemblies like this one,

00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:57.300
WITHOUT having to pay.

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:01.200
I'll work with coaches to arrange games that we'll watch DURING the school day

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:04.480
in assemblies like this one,

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:06.960
WITHOUT having to pay!

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:11.700
[crowd cheers]

00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:13.300
As your class president,

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:17.800
I will ensure that we have assemblies like this one at LEAST once a month,

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:21.400
so that we can maintain a sense of community.

00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:29.000
[crowd buzzing]

00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:33.400
But I can't do it alone guys.

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:35.400
I need you to vote for me,

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:38.800
to allow me the PRIVILEGE of doing it.

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:41.000
TOGETHER, WE,

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.200
the 2015 students of Meadowlawn Middle School

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:45.300
can go down in history,

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:48.600
as the class who effectively FOUGHT to increase bell time.

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:52.600
Yes, TOGETHER WE CAN.

00:05:52.940 --> 00:05:55.900
Together, WE can go down in history

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:59.100
as the class who built a sense of community.

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:03.400
Yes, together WE CAN!

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:06.020
VOTE CAMILLE LUONG.

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:09.120
TOGETHER WE WILL.

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:14.100
[CROWD CHEERING]
