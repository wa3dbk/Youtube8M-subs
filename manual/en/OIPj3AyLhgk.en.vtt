00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:01.220
My name is John Rogers.

00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:02.210
I am a screenwriter.

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:07.180
I currently run the TV
show Leverage on TNT.

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:09.110
Chris Downey, Dean Devlin,
and I created the show.

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:13.720
Well, there's this weird story
is Dean Devlin was talking

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:16.180
about doing a series with TNT at
the same time Chris Downey

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:18.640
and I were talking about,
where's that great Rockford

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:19.900
Files con and heist show?

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:21.620
We just don't have
those anymore.

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:24.060
And coincidentally, Dean and
I had lunch the next day.

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.800
And he said, TNT wants
me to do a show.

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:26.560
And I want to do a group.

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:29.290
And I said, well my buddy and
I were talking about this.

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:30.860
Dean and I were friends.

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:34.370
We pitched it and sold
it within two weeks.

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:36.910
I actually wanted to be
a mystery writer.

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:38.950
And I wanted to write sparkling
banter and dialogue.

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:42.570
So I became a stand-up to kind
of learn how jokes worked and

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:44.490
just get a better sense of it.

00:00:44.490 --> 00:00:46.130
I was doing my physics
degree at the time.

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:47.770
And it turned out I was
a much better stand-up

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:48.650
than I was a physicist.

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:51.570
So I wound up doing stand-up,
did a bunch of specials, got

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.280
my own sitcom for a
minute and a half.

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.260
But after the sitcom didn't go,
I was back auditioning.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:57.630
And the writers went
to the next job.

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:00.150
And I thought, that job, the
one where you fail and get

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:01.350
another job, I want that.

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.370
So I eventually wound up
circling back into writing and

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:05.390
became a television writer.

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:07.690
I don't just write television
and movies.

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:09.850
I've also written comic books
over the last 10 years.

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:11.690
I started by doing independent
work for BOOM!

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:14.330
Studios in their anthologies,
like Zombie Tales and Ninja

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:15.800
Tales and that sort of thing.

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.290
That eventually led to writing
Blue Beetle for two years for

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:19.830
DC on the old line.

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.120
And now I'm writing
the Dungeons and

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:22.930
Dragons comic for IDW.

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:24.830
So my geek cred is firmly
established.

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:27.560
It was a little daunting to do
the Dungeons and Dragons comic

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.060
book, because everyone is
so very attached to it.

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:33.210
And that's why I didn't
do one of the worlds.

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.340
I didn't do Forgotten Realms.

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:36.310
I didn't do any of
the other ones.

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:39.770
I took the core world that was
very undefined, so I wouldn't

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:42.220
be walking on anybody's
previous work.

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:44.300
And I wouldn't be walking
on any preconceptions.

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.960
Interestingly enough, we
actually did much better in

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.940
the comic press and got much
better reviews than amongst

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:52.300
the role playing press, because
role playing fans tend

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:55.490
to read very big, thick fantasy
books and aren't

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:57.560
necessarily into serialized
storytelling the way

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:58.280
the comic books are.

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.800
So it wound up being more I'm
writing a Dungeons and Dragons

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:02.910
comic for the comic fans.

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:06.760
It goes role playing game,
video game, table top, I

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:10.150
think, just because I like
the story elements.

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:12.850
If I can't get a role playing
game group on a regular basis,

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:13.630
I play video games.

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:16.730
And it splits between the
strategy games and the big

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:18.570
open world games.

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:22.040
But, to be honest, most of the
fun I have is dissecting games

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:23.120
almost more than playing them.

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:26.395
I love game design, because game
design boils down to how

00:02:26.395 --> 00:02:28.100
you tell stories through
mechanical means.

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:30.010
And screen writing is all about
how you tell stories

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:30.750
through mechanical means.

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:32.070
You're bound by act breaks.

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:33.040
You're bound by characters.

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:34.560
You're bound by genre.

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:35.690
You're bound by budget.

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:38.540
And so there's a lot of
crossover in game design, game

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:41.690
space, storytelling games,
and writing.

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:45.250
I think, really, I'd love to
do a modern fantasy show.

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:49.070
I think America, I think the
audience is receptive to magic

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:51.750
in a way that mainstream
publishers and broadcasters

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:52.580
don't understand.

00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:53.490
Harry Potter was huge.

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:54.820
Lord of the Rings was huge.

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:56.800
And we have no TV shows
reflecting that in any way,

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:57.320
shape, or form.

00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:59.100
And, to me, that's just money
left on the table and

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:00.620
storytelling space left
on the table.

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:02.710
Gaming is creativity.
