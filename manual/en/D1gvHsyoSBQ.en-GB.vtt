00:00:28.391 --> 00:00:32.438
The DDJ-SB is the latest two-channel controller in our Digital DJ range.  

00:00:32.638 --> 00:00:38.118
It joins the latest Serato DJ family of Pioneer controllers optimised for remix and pad performance.

00:00:38.318 --> 00:00:46.807
Itís even more compact than the recent DDJ-SR but still retains so many of the features introduced on our most popular four-channel DDJ-SX.

00:00:47.007 --> 00:00:53.694
You get two large aluminium jog wheels, 8 performance pads and independent high- and low-pass filters on each channel. 

00:00:53.894 --> 00:01:00.000
Completely USB powered, itís designed to work anywhere Plug and Play with Serato DJ and DJ Intro. 

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:09.103
A feature unique to the SB is our optional Filter Fade mode, which combines high-pass filtering with crossfader movements, making it easier to do more. 

00:01:09.303 --> 00:01:14.271
The DDJ-SB contains all the essential connections to get the most out of your set. 

00:01:14.471 --> 00:01:21.495
Plug a Mic in the jack input for an MC or vocalist and connect headphones using this big or small jack connection.  

00:01:21.695 --> 00:01:25.856
And easily connect speakers with the standard RCA outputs for the master channel.

00:01:26.056 --> 00:01:34.361
A lot of the action happens around the 8 rubber pads and the bottom four give you play, Cue, Sync and Shift to access extra features. 

00:01:34.561 --> 00:01:41.008
With Sync on, youíre free to get creative with the effects and performance pads, without having to worry about beat-matching.

00:01:41.208 --> 00:01:44.599
The pads above are used to control four performance modes. 

00:01:44.799 --> 00:02:00.833
Trigger hot cues, instantly access 1, 2, 4 and 8-beat loops and manually punch in loops on the fly with in, out, exit and a loop cutter at the end. 

00:02:01.033 --> 00:02:06.097
Finally, press sampler to access a bank of four sounds or loops that you can trigger with your fingers.

00:02:11.617 --> 00:02:17.370
And to warp your tracks further, the SB has two effects units per channel with six presets to choose from.

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:23.113
Choose and combine up to three effects at once and activate each one with these illuminated buttons. 

00:02:23.313 --> 00:02:30.961
The level and depth parameters for all three are controlled with just one tactile knob giving instant macro results in the mix.  

00:02:38.874 --> 00:02:43.330
You can also change the effect timing by holding down shift and turning the beats knob.

00:02:46.672 --> 00:02:52.818
A feature unique to the DDJ-SB is Filter Fade, which is a brand new way to mix tracks together using the crossfader. 

00:02:53.018 --> 00:03:12.052
With this switched on, instead of fading the volume of one channel down and the other up, it combines two high-pass filters to crossfade the bass in and out of each track. 

00:03:12.252 --> 00:03:18.835
This creates a seamless blend that would need two hands on the filters and another on the crossfader.

00:03:19.035 --> 00:03:29.899
All of these functions are standard in the free bundled Serato DJ Intro software, but to get even more out of the DDJ-SB you can upgrade to Serato DJ for $129.

00:03:30.099 --> 00:03:36.923
With the upgrade, youíll be able to access more pad features, using the shift button and youíll be able to record your performances within the software.

00:03:37.123 --> 00:03:53.236
You can access Hot Cues 5 to 8, Autoloop switches to a Roll effect, Manual Loop becomes Hot Loop and hit Shift and Sampler, to choose from four sample banks. 

00:03:53.436 --> 00:04:00.444
You also get an extra 6 iZotope FX, plus access to add-on packs from Serato. 

00:04:00.644 --> 00:04:05.580
Each effects unit can be switched into single mode, giving you more control over the effect parameters. 

00:04:06.123 --> 00:04:15.951
And if that wasnít enough you can activate slip mode to manipulate scratching, looping and hot cue triggering without changing the original playback position. 

00:04:18.158 --> 00:04:24.078
The DDJ-SB is a seriously feature-packed controller in one very compact package, but not so small that itís impractical. 

00:04:24.278 --> 00:04:29.565
You get all the features that really count for the very best price, making it one of the most exciting low-cost controllers. 

00:04:29.765 --> 00:04:36.804
Despite the low price, the DDJ-SB also gives you professional sound quality without compromising on durability for the most important components. 

00:04:37.004 --> 00:04:47.566
With its software adjustable fader curves and reverse, itís the perfect solution for beginners and equally skilled turntablists looking for a portable solution.
