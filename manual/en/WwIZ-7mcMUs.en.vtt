Hello Everyone. OK, check out this game.
I can't actually pronounce it so it's called
Ex-Zeus.

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:19.250
It's just almost unintelligible.

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:24.189
Anyway, other than having a slightly
unpronounceable name, it has some
quite interesting gameplay.

00:00:24.189 --> 00:00:30.009
Very very Japanese style as you might
expect

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:34.410
from having a slightly crazy name that I think
gets lost in translation somewhere.

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.280
The idea is giant robots. Giant robots with guns, enemy robots with guns,

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:40.660
you blow things up.

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:42.150
Use your gyroscope

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:44.730
to have to dodge around  and what have you,
and shoot

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.580
and so it's like 3D Bullet Storm Hell

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:50.240
which if anybody

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:52.110
likes Bullet Storm Hell games

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.860
you're going to absolutely love this.

00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:01.520
The graphics are really fast paced, 
quite fun

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:08.520
gameplay as well but quite challenging,
it's a difficult, difficult  game.

00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:14.740
You get power-ups as you go along, and
there are giant bosses

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.450
at the end which are going to require quite a 
bit of concentration and 

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.410
skill to actually beat.

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:24.780
Like any Bullet Storm Hell game, it's
quite tricky made even more difficult
I suppose

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.430
because it's in 3D so you're kind of having 
to think about

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:30.590
a whole lot more while you play

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:34.009
and talking becomes difficult.

00:01:34.009 --> 00:01:38.210
Where are those big bombs, I'll
use them again?

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:41.870
You've got missiles, guns, you name it, it's
all there, you've got to avoid the geometry or

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:44.420
it will kill you.

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:46.869
It's a real cracker of a title, I'll tell you.

00:01:46.869 --> 00:01:50.340
I think it's going to be one that people have
to spend quite a long time trying to master.

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:55.010
The graphics are just top notch and the frame
rate is really solid.

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:57.530
They've done a great job on this.

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:02.490
I'm not sure who the developers particularly are,
they must be Japanese, I'd assume.

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.649
Well done guys, this is a really really
cracking game.

00:02:06.649 --> 00:02:09.879
Full of action,

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:12.260
I think honestly, go grab it.

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:15.309
I can't pronounce it, you'll have to just
write it down

00:02:15.309 --> 00:02:16.749
It's ExZeus

00:02:16.749 --> 00:02:19.389
something like that

00:02:19.389 --> 00:02:20.959
but

00:02:20.959 --> 00:02:23.089
great bit of fun.

00:02:23.089 --> 00:02:24.589
Die, die die everyone!
