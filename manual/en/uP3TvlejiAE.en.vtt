00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:08.480
Hi, my name's Pam.

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:14.639
I'm here to tell you about Bank of America's
Health Savings Accounts, also known as HSAs.

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:20.199
If you have a High Deductible Health Plan,
an HSA lets you put away money for out-of-pocket

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:24.990
expenses like doctor visits, dental or vision
care, and prescriptions.

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.210
But an HSA is more than just a savings account.

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:35.260
It's a really super-charged way to save money
on health expenses and invest in your future.

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:40.760
HSAs are powerful because of their unique
tax advantages: the potential for tax-free

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:45.400
contributions, tax-free gains, and tax-free
withdrawals.

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:50.470
Together, these tax advantages help you keep
more of your hard-earned money.

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:52.230
Here's how:

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:58.030
Because contributions to HSAs can be made
pretax, every dollar you put into an HSA is

00:00:58.030 --> 00:00:59.890
a dollar saved.

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:06.360
For example, if you contribute $75 from your
weekly paycheck to an HSA for 12 months, in

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.220
just one year you'll put away three-thousand
nine hundred dollars for your family's health

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.720
expenses.

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:18.720
Without a Health Savings Account, this $3,900
would be taxed like regular income, and these

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:24.210
taxes could cost you $975 or more.

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:29.630
The next advantage of an HSA is that any gains
you have would be tax-free.

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:36.880
This benefit lets you keep 100% of any money
your HSA savings or investments earn.

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:41.320
So if your account sees even a modest rate
of return, the gains can really boost the

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:44.490
amount of money you have to cover health expenses.

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:46.880
Tax-free contributions.

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:48.890
Tax-free gains.

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:54.080
These two tax advantages turn an HSA into
a powerful savings tool.

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:57.869
And remember, those aren't the only tax breaks
you can get with a Health Savings Account

00:01:57.869 --> 00:01:59.590
from Bank of America.

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:05.049
HSAs from Bank of America can also benefit
you with tax-free withdrawals on qualifying

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:06.900
medical expenses.

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:11.039
So when it comes time to use the money in
your Health Savings Account to pay for a doctor's

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:17.420
visit, vision care, or prescriptions, you
won't pay taxes on the money you withdraw.

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:23.389
The benefits of a Health Savings Account through
Bank of America aren't just tax-related, either.

00:02:23.389 --> 00:02:28.269
There are no use-it or lose-it provisions
with HSAs, which means you keep all the money

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:30.900
left in your account at the end of the year.

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:37.010
And HSAs are portable, so they can go with
you wherever you go.

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:42.349
If you change health plans or retire, you
still have your HSA and you can keep using

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:44.209
it to save on health expenses.

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:45.599
Save it.

00:02:45.599 --> 00:02:46.999
Use it.

00:02:46.999 --> 00:02:47.999
Never lose it.

00:02:47.999 --> 00:02:53.890
A Health Savings Account gives you the power
and control to do all three.

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:59.099
And with Bank of America, you'll discover
simple ways to manage your HSA and do more

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:00.340
with your money.

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:06.370
Bank of America gives you a free HSA debit
card, a secure online portal and a handy mobile

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:11.849
app, so paying for your health expenses and
keeping track of your account are simple.

00:03:11.849 --> 00:03:16.079

grow, Bank of America gives you access to

00:03:16.079 --> 00:03:19.989
