How To Make Chai Tea The
Quick And Easy Way.

00:00:04.339 --> 00:00:06.220
But Still Delicious!

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:10.840
Hi, this is a quick and simple way of making
REAL chai tea.

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:12.900
You only need a few ingredients.

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:13.900
Like ginger.

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:15.200
And cinnamon.

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:19.490
Both have been proven medically beneficial
for high blood pressure and diabetes.

00:00:19.490 --> 00:00:21.490
So it's a drink thats good for you.

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:22.960
You can make it in a minute.

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:26.390
Or as short as how long the kettle of water
takes to boil.

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:29.279
And you use only real natural ingredients.

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:30.660
Here's how you do it.

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:33.360
First you take some organic ginger powder.

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.250
You just need to add about half a teaspoon
to the cup.

00:00:36.250 --> 00:00:40.620
Next comes cinnamon powder.

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:49.710
Again, about half a teaspoon.

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.730
Add a black tea tea bag to the cup.

00:00:52.730 --> 00:01:00.070
Then pour in boiling water.

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:07.060
Stir briefly, then remove the tea bag.

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:08.150
Add some milk.

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:11.370
Then stir in your favorite sweetener.

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:13.540
Here I'm adding organic molasses.

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:17.400
It's nutrient dense and goes really well in
chai tea.

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.050
Yummmy!

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:21.190
This tastes like REAL chai tea.

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:28.010
It's got the flavor, the depth and the kick
I expect of chai tea.

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:32.360
Both the ginger and cinnamon powder dissolve
very well, leaving only a few dregs at the

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:33.360
end.

00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:35.540
This recipe is stripped down to the basics.

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:39.270
You'll be hard pressed to tell the difference
between this cup of chai tea and those made

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.050
using
more tedious methods, such as long boiling

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:43.920
times and more spices.

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.110
Trust me.

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:47.260
So here are the ingredients again.

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:51.220
Fine organic ginger powder.

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:53.560
Finely ground cinnamon powder.

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:54.900
A tea bag.

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:55.900
Some milk.

00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:57.430
Your favorite sweetener.

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:59.580
And a jug to boil water.

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:02.830
You can get the ginger and cinnamon powder
at EyeHerb.

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:10.959
Just type in EyeHerb.com, or go to the link
below, and look for "starwest cinnamon powder"

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:13.310
and "simply organic ginger".

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.849
They both cost around five bucks.

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:20.120
I also get my organic molasses from EyeHerb,
for about five bucks as well.

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:25.620
So for around ten to fifteen bucks, you can
enjoy many cups of quick and easy REAL chai

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:26.680
tea.

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:31.670
And reap the benefits of healthy blood pressure
and blood sugar levels at the same time.

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:32.779
Thanks for watching.

00:02:32.779 --> 00:02:33.779
Enjoy!!

00:02:33.779 --> 00:02:34.250
Cheers.
