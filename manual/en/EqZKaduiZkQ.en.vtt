Vegan Apple Crisp Recipe by The Sweetest Vegan

00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:07.841
Hey my Sweet Vs, its The Sweetest Vegan here and today on the 
 show, we will be making my favoritest dessert of all time.

00:00:07.841 --> 00:00:13.714
Everytime I used to go to restaurants and order 
 this, it is a Vegan Apple Crisp

00:00:13.714 --> 00:00:17.985
And it is going to be so delicious so stay tuned for the recipe.

00:00:23.524 --> 00:00:31.138
So first we want to take our chopped apples and mix 
 them with lemon juice, flour, cinnamon, and raw sugar.

00:00:31.138 --> 00:00:35.991
Stir that together really well and divide between ramekins, or a large casserole dish.

00:00:38.805 --> 00:00:42.142
The next step is to make  the crisp. In a large bowl

00:00:42.142 --> 00:00:45.604
Add flour, rolled oats,

00:00:45.604 --> 00:00:52.253
almonds, raw sugar, cinnamon

00:00:52.253 --> 00:00:54.892
salt and vegan butter.

00:00:54.892 --> 00:00:59.760
Stir it all together.

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:05.432
Then crumble the butter in with your fingers.

00:01:13.213 --> 00:01:20.848
Our last step is to top off our apples with our crisp 
 and bake at 375 degrees F for about 40-45 minutes.
