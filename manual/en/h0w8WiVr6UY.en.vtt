00:00:00.539 --> 00:00:07.240
The other essential tool for bead making is
a kiln. And as mentioned in earlier segments,

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:13.340
the kiln performs two functions. It allows
the bead to cool off very gently, so as to

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:19.470
avoid thermal shock, which will cause cracking
in a bead. And it also importantly performs

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:25.649
the function of annealing the bead, annealing
is the process of making happy glass molecules.

00:00:25.649 --> 00:00:31.070
Where the glass molecules get to vibrate.
Annealing doesn't change the look of the bead,

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:36.590
it doesn't change the shape of the bead. But
it gets the temperature high enough in the

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:42.780
case of the Effetre, Italian glass we're using,
nine hundred and fifty degrees fahrenheit,

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:48.790
gets the glass hot enough so that the molecules
in the bead form, get to vibrate and kind

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:53.170
of move a little bit. So that they can work
out any stress that they might have. When

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:59.610
we make a bead we're introducing lots of focused
heat into one particular and our goal is to

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:05.530
have that not be so localized. But to have
the heat distributed evenly, and there are

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:11.170
homogenization processes we use in making
the breads. Where we do a nice kind of marshmallow

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:16.710
toasting of the bead after we have worked
on one dot area or one designing area. And

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.540
a lot of this will become clear as we go through
the sequences of the actual bead making steps.

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:28.430
But in any event the annealing kiln is a further
homogenizing influence on the glass, and helps

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:33.040
ensure that the glass bead that you make,
once it comes down to room temperature will

00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:39.600
not crack. There are special kilns made for
this and they are bead kilns. A ceramic kiln

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:45.360
can theoretically be used for making a glass
beads but you have to be super careful not

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:52.740
to introduce the metal rod that you make the
bead on into any of the electric elements

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:58.119
that are a part of the kiln. Because if you
do you stand the risk of electrocuting yourself.

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:03.920
So a bead kiln will typically have a top chamber
where the electrodes are direct and you never

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:10.060
would touch that with metal directly exposed.
But there's a underneath chamber which has

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:15.669
usually a mesh separation where you physically
cannot introduce this your metal mandrel,

00:02:15.669 --> 00:02:21.920
which is holding your bead to an electrode
by accident. And we'll get you another picture

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:26.629
of the bead kiln later on you can see the
door. But a bead kiln is a great tool, and

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:32.459
they cost any where from between four hundred
and six hundred degrees. Some of them have,

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:37.709
dollars excuse me, some of them have controllers
which automatically adjust the temperature

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:44.999
and others just simply use a variable speed,
sort of potentiometer dial, and you have to

00:02:44.999 --> 00:02:50.569
keep looking at the pyrometer, which tells
you what temperature you're at. On the kiln

00:02:50.569 --> 00:02:55.689
I'm using it's not fancy, we have no programmable
computer, it doesn't keep it at a certain

00:02:55.689 --> 00:03:01.159
temperature. I'm always having to look at
the pyrometer to make sure that I am maintaining

00:03:01.159 --> 00:03:05.249
the temperature I want. In this case right
now I've got my pyrometer and it's indicating,

00:03:05.249 --> 00:03:09.350
it's hard to see of course, but take my word
for it that's about nine hundred and fifty,

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:15.390
nine seventy-five fahrenheit. One thousand
is straight up on that middle slash. So that's

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:20.830
the pyrometer and this is my bead kiln, and
again these are available from any of the

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:26.249
glass supply houses. With respect to the kiln
function of annealing and keeping thermal

00:03:26.249 --> 00:03:32.189
shock away, the particular bead kiln I have
in this instance also serves a very valuable

00:03:32.189 --> 00:03:42.739
safety function. Because the bead when it
goes into the kiln it does not risk getting

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:48.299
into contact with electrodes that are located
above, because there's a separation between

00:03:48.299 --> 00:03:54.209
the upper chamber and the bottom chamber.
You'll notice there's a mesh screen so you

00:03:54.209 --> 00:04:00.120
would never put a steel mandrel into this
top area, because it can electrocute you.

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:07.010
By touching the mandrel to the electrodes
you can get a injuring or killing shock. So

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:12.590
a bead kiln is specifically designed to prevent
against this and has a separation screen between

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:16.439
the bead chamber and where the electrodes
are actually located.
