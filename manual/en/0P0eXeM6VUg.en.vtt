00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:06.330
Snagit’s flexible Outputs provide a variety
of ways to share your image and video captures

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:08.690
to fit your sharing needs.

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:09.690
You can:

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.619
• Instantly share captures to popular social
media sites like Twitter, Facebook, or YouTube

00:00:14.619 --> 00:00:18.020
• Quickly share captures as an email attachment

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:23.070
• Insert captures into a Microsoft Word
document or PowerPoint presentation

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:30.770
• Upload to screencast.com and paste a link
to the captures in an instant message, email,

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:31.770
etc.

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:34.930
The Outputs appear on the Share tab in Snagit
Editor.

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:40.090
To share an image or video capture, simply
click an output button.

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:44.020
Outputs that do not support the selected capture’s
file format are disabled.

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:49.570
Let’s take a look at one of the most useful
outputs in the Snagit arsenal – sending

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:52.050
your captures to PowerPoint.

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:59.340
To send your image to a new slide in a PowerPoint
presentation, click the PowerPoint button.

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.129
If you already have a PowerPoint presentation
open, the image appears on the slide you have

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:06.759
selected.

00:01:06.759 --> 00:01:13.280
For example, to put your image on slide 4,
select slide 4 in PowerPoint, then go to Snagit

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.889
and click the PowerPoint output.

00:01:16.889 --> 00:01:21.060
Or to see the options available to you, click
the dropdown under the PowerPoint button,

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:22.740
then click Options.

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:30.159
You’ll see all the different ways Snagit
can get your capture into PowerPoint.

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:33.240
Make your selections, and click OK.

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:39.640
Now, when you click the PowerPoint button,
Snagit will use these settings to put your

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.490
capture where you want it to be.

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.671
And, if you want to edit, annotate, or add
effects to your video captures… use the

00:01:46.671 --> 00:01:50.310
Camtasia Studio output.

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:54.399
If you have Camtasia Studio installed, this
will share your Snagit videos to the clip

00:01:54.399 --> 00:01:58.409
bin, where you can begin editing to your heart’s
content.

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:01.340
Outputs aren’t just important because they’re
a fast way to share.

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.820
They also help you avoid some of the problems
you can run into when an image or video capture

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:09.490
you want to send is just too big to be e-mailed.

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:12.909
The Screencast.com output is especially helpful
here..

00:02:12.909 --> 00:02:18.720
You can host your captures on Screencast.com
for free, and set privacy and security settings

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:24.390
that dictate who can view them
Snagit can share directly to Screencast.com,

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:29.140
and place the link on your clipboard for easy
pasting.

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:33.590
You can download more, like the Facebook and
Twitter outputs, by clicking the More Accessories

00:02:33.590 --> 00:02:37.349
button on the Share tab in the Snagit editor.

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:40.430
This video was just a taste of what you can
do with outputs.

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:43.329
Experiment to see what ones work best for
you.

00:02:43.329 --> 00:02:47.230

tried, or let us know what you’d like to
