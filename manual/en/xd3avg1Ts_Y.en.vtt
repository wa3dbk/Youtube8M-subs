Hi, my name is Lauren, and today, I'm here
to discuss, how to curl and style your hair,

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:07.800
with a curling iron. The first thing that
you're going to want to do, is plug in the

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:12.620
curling iron. The size of the diameter, curling
iron that you use, the smaller the diameter,

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:16.540
the smaller and tighter the curls, so you're
going to want to address which curling iron

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:22.640
to use, by what curl you desire. You're going
to then grab a thermal protectant spray. Section

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:28.789
your hair, you want to do smaller sections,
if you're doing a smaller diameter curling

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:33.570
iron. A good rule of thumb, is that your section
should be about the diameter of what your

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:40.440
curling iron is, so that way, you're not grabbing
too much hair. You're then going to spray

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:47.420
the hair, smooth it down with your hands.
The duck bill should go on top. You want to

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:53.829
make sure that you go with the duck bill,
when you rotate the hair, in order to prevent

00:00:53.829 --> 00:00:59.379
getting any frayed ends, or any fish hook
ends. You're going to want to hold it, just

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:03.410
kind of feel it. You can feel the heat of
the hair, and then you let go. You're going

00:01:03.410 --> 00:01:13.710
to do that on all of the sections, section
by section, throughout your head.

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:19.940
Again, I'm going to roll with the duck bill,
in order to not have my ends go against it,

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:30.380
like this. After you are finished curling
the entire hair, I like to spray it a little

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:34.500
bit more with some hairspray, just all over,
and have it set for a few minutes, before

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:41.100
I actually go, and bring them out. After I
have it set, I use a little bit more product,

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:46.610
usually a palmade, a paste, anything of that
nature. Emulsify it really well in your hands,

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:54.220
and then you're actually going to separate
those curls, and kind of re-form them, so

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:58.720
that way, you can actually style your hair,
and it doesn't look like you were just hit

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:02.880
with the curling iron, that you just curled
it, but you can actually separate them, and

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.110
create a style, and that is how you curl and
style your hair, with a curling iron.
