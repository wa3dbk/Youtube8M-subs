00:00:01.569 --> 00:00:05.890
several years ago I had an injury that
could have paralyzed me from the waist down

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:10.660
and for a while it did. When this issue
comes up people tend to say that it'd be

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:13.500
too hard to implement or impractical

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.320
or that it would be depressing. the people
who say that obviously haven't thought

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:19.720
about it very much

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:24.349
let's consider the emotional reasons why
we need to be as inclusive as possible

00:00:24.349 --> 00:00:26.759
for people with disabilities in The Sims

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:30.769
what I love about The Sims is that you
can make yourself as close to who you

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:32.020
are as possible

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:36.720
and yet still succeed at life without
any of the issues you would face in real

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:37.190
life

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:42.000
you don't have to make you seem White if
your ethnic, attractive is maybe you're

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.450
not so much, heterosexual if you're gay,

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.890
or even the most charismatic Sim on the
block if you're somewhat

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:52.480
reserved in real life. You can still do
well at your job,

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:55.750
you can still marry someone who is much more
attractive than you are

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:59.430
adoption is beautifully simple so you
can focus on your career if

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.920
you want a baby. These days when I make
myself in The Sims

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.939
I give myself the "Shy" and "Loner"
traits.

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:10.549
I put in all my flaws and quirks and I
just have to work a little bit harder to

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:11.479
thrive

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:15.840
it's a great feeling to see your Sim thrive
without racism, discrimination,

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:20.069
or any of the other things I've had to deal
with in life. if I'm flawed

00:01:20.069 --> 00:01:25.130
making my sim like me is not depressing.
what would be very pitiable and

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:28.409
depressing would be if someone made
themselves in The Sims but

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.939
changed their race to fight a racism that
doesn't exist

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:35.880
or made themselves as a male so they'd feel
better about dating women

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.100
the best thing about The Sims is when
you can be you

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.819
warts and all, and still get everything
you want out of the game.

00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:47.020
If I were disabled, I personally wouldn't
play The Sims.

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:50.200
You're telling me I have to be able to
Walk, or have

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:55.399
both arms in order to live a happy life
with my dream spouse in my dream house

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:59.819
I wanna be in wheelchair and still be
able to get Angelina Jolie or something

00:01:59.819 --> 00:02:00.999
from day one

00:02:00.999 --> 00:02:04.569
and let's face it, only really in The
Sims could that happen

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:08.700
let's talk about actually implementing
this into the game because this is very

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:09.930
possible

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:13.720
because the Sims is a fictional universe
it can take liberties and make things

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.150
comically easier for people who might

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:20.300
otherwise have been disadvantaged
there's no racism because from a design

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:21.150
standpoint

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:25.800
race is just facial features and coloring.
it'd be very difficult to have Sims

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:29.590
respond to other sims based on those and
well they shouldn't try

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:33.690
so gender and age are the only tangible
factors in The Sims 3

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:37.600
there is no discrimination for LGBT's
in the Sims

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:42.240
there's also no "T's" but I'm not really
waiting for that expansion pack to come

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.690
out

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:47.550
adoption is brilliantly done in The Sims
3 whereas it was as difficult as it was

00:02:47.550 --> 00:02:48.540
a real live

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.340
than people who are dependent on it
would be disadvantaged playing the game

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:56.380
the point is, The Sims tweaked an aspect
of real life to make it more accessible

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:57.390
and an

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:00.760
option for anyone who might need it. Does
it mirror

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:04.680
our world exactly? No, but the point is
they could do the same

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:08.300
thing for the disabled. maybe your Sim
has a prosthetic

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:13.430
arm or leg, more than one. The cheapest one
comes free as part of their incredible

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:15.670
health care in The Sims universe

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:19.160
and it's functional as an arm
looking like a prosthetic

00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:22.580
and more expensive ones can maybe do
cool features

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:26.710
you could be like a bionic man or
something. but what about wheelchairs

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:31.190
they would have to program every single
lot in every single expansion pack

00:03:31.190 --> 00:03:35.240
(which they can't do) to have every single
community lot

00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:39.190
and preferably home, be wheelchair
accessible? Well,

00:03:39.190 --> 00:03:44.840
what if rocket Jets bust out of your
wheelchair and propel you up and down stairs

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:48.190
that would be the unique kind of Sims
charm and flair

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:51.210
that they could apply to keep it light
hearted and funny

00:03:51.210 --> 00:03:55.300
it wouldn't be dark it wouldn't be
depressing, and if I were in a wheelchair

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:58.720
I would come to accept that as a nice
compromise

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:02.830
I get to be in a wheelchair, have
Angelina Jolie bumping up against me

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:06.340
rocket up some stairs which I can't
really do in real life but,

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:11.160
hey. Something about it doesn't feel
marketable as an expansion pack,

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:11.569
I'll admit.

00:04:11.569 --> 00:04:15.069
and I certainly wouldn't expect in the
base game because this would also have

00:04:15.069 --> 00:04:16.829
to include ways for people to

00:04:16.829 --> 00:04:21.049
become handicapped or disabled, and I
could fully understand people not

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:22.079
wanting that

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:25.150
but you have to give it perks make it
fun.

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:29.010
make it so that it doesn't take anything away
from your life, in you know

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:32.120
a way that that pays respect to the
people in real life

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:35.300
you know it doesn't just completely
pretend they have no problems

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:38.730
but also that doesn't pity them

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:43.540
It keeps it light in a Sims way. they
would release it as a stuff pack

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:47.010
that's how they would market it. they'd join
up with some affiliation for the

00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:47.920
disabled

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:51.300
half of all proceeds go to etc. blah
blah blog

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:55.920
put a little banner over the game.
Because I really do feel like there

00:04:55.920 --> 00:05:00.130
is an emotional need for this to be in
the game, and I've explained why.

00:05:00.130 --> 00:05:04.010
there are so many games I don't play
because I feel like I can't be ME in

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:05.010
that game.

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:08.680
I know it would mean the world to some of
these people if they could play

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:12.020
who they are in The Sims and have
all of their

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:15.590
wishes or dreams and aspirations
come true

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:19.600
just like everyone else. Like this video
share with your friends if you

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:22.370
think The Sims should step up and do
something like this.
