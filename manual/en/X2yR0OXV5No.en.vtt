Jason Rhian: Hi, I'm here live with the two guests who host Star Trek Live, Sovak and Commander Sean Christopher.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Sean: That's right.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Jason: Guys, tell us a little bit about what guests can expect to see when they come see this amazing setup you guys have here.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Sean: Well it's the first day of the Starfleet Academy, which is important.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.000
We have all our cadets ready to get ready on their adventure through the Starfleet program

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
but something happens, something that we wouldn't expect and it's a Romulan threat.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Then we're introduced to this gentleman. I call him Sovak.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:43.000
Sovak: And we meet Simian, who is a Romulan threatening to destroy the International Space Station

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.000
so he can obtain the core, one of the most intelligent and creative scientists of the 21st century.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000
Jason: Now, from what I understand, there are a lot of tie-ins showing how what we're doing currently in space

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.000
could benefit the future. So tell me a little bit about that.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Sovak: Absolutely, well we talk about NASA's research with 3G phones is it?

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Sean: Yes, 3G phones.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.000
... and how it is much like my modern tricorder and how it senses chemical and biological data much like a phone.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Sean: And there's work being done with that right now and it's interesting that you know,

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:39.000
these things that seem so impossible in the future are really being sparked now as we are learning about space and technology.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:48.000
These shows, this Star Trek, is really something that makes people think that that's possible and that's how we achieve these great breakthroughs.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000
Jason: So you see Star Trek as basically a point of inspiration that's guiding where we're going towards in the future?

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Sean: Exactly.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:17.000
Jason: And that part where we go back to the moon and on to Mars, this would help exploration efforts such as that?

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:22.000
Sovak: Indeed. In fact we use the Hubble space telescope to solve the problem that we deal with.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:29.000
Sean: Exactly. And there is actually work being done right now to get an outpost on the moon and to make that next trip to Mars.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000
So we're very excited about that and hopefully we'll get to be a part of it.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000
Do you think you'll hang around for that Sovak?

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
Sovak: That would be highly illogical.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.000
Sean: Of course.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.000
Jason: Well with that, we know Sovak's got to get back to the 23rd century I believe it was? Or was it the 24th?

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.000
Sovak: It is far in the future.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
Farther than you can imagine.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
Jason: I will accept that. I'm not good with math.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
And with that guys, we're going to make it a wrap for the day. Thank you for taking the time

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
and thank you very much for putting on Star Trek Live.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
Sean: Well, thank you for coming out.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000
