00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:41.769
heel hold foot inside edge of ball of
the right foot now we're going to show

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:48.519
you a simple summary of the tango basic
in closed position we have two walks

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:51.519
forward and tango close

00:02:52.060 --> 00:03:05.109
okay we'll do that again and to backward
walks and tango close so on this step

00:03:05.109 --> 00:03:08.440
straight basic we're just going to
comment on some of the fundamental for

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:12.459
the tango a slightly more staccato
action through the legs making sure your

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:15.579
posture is great and just checking out
the frame

00:03:15.579 --> 00:03:20.620
ok so let's look at the staccato action through the legs so moving

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:24.010
forward we're going to think of taking a
step and collecting the weight step and

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:27.400
collecting the weight step and
collecting the weight then going to the

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:31.959
side and closing the legs together so
it's not going to be the same smooth

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:35.709
rolling action that we did in some of
the other dances and that make sure

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:40.570
ladies when you're going back to get
that nice staccato action make sure that

00:03:40.570 --> 00:03:43.750
you keep your weight very much on the
balls of the feet

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:47.530
don't drop the shoulder weight back
because right when you're going to want

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:49.060
to collect your weight

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:53.319
will be falling so this would be bad as
you try and collect your falling onto

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:57.280
your foot and you can't get that lovely
staccato action which is a great points, so

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:00.099
guys make sure you initiate your
movement through your knees coming

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:03.250
forwards so then ladies keep the weight
balls of the feet

00:04:03.849 --> 00:04:09.160
soften through the joints send a leg
back and then snap it closed and then as

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:13.060
we go to the side that drawing almost
closed in third position right there

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:16.780
ok let's talk about the frame going in
this direction so I want to make sure

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:21.519
that I stay so I have the window so I
can see where I'm going

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:25.180
okay right so the window is from the
lady's head through to her hand on this

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:29.830
side we found an experience teaching
tengo that people really get into the

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:34.780
mood of tango and they kind of hunker
down make sure in the tango weight is

00:04:34.780 --> 00:04:41.020
down posture is up you want to feel very
kind of audience naughty kind of English

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:46.510
he should have this down you could do so
from here feel like you've got your nose

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:54.250
up and your legs down and head up head
up and keep that lovely posture all the

00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:55.180
way through

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:59.919
okay great so they're the fundamental
techniques of tango this is a great step

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:03.160
to work on it with let's demonstrate
that now for you to music
