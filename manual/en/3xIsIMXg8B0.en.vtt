00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.080
- Hey guys!

00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:06.080
- Been a minute since we've done a First Impressions
and when we saw this product we thought--

00:00:06.089 --> 00:00:07.520
- This is the perfect opportunity!

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:12.559
- We have to, we love Cover Girl Mascaras,
so, are we going to love this one?

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:19.070
- This is the new Cover Girl Full Lash Bloom
by Lash Blast Mascara and typically we always

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:20.280
like the Lash Blast Mascaras.

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:25.620
- Uh, time out, we LOVE the Lash Blast Mascaras.
The orange one is in my bag.

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:27.109
- Lash Blast Mascara is bae.

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:27.910
- For life.

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:32.359
- So, okay, let me just tell you some of the
claims of this mascara. It is, flake resistant,

00:00:32.359 --> 00:00:37.609
it is going to give you touch-ably soft, full
lashes.

00:00:37.609 --> 00:00:38.580
- Full, separated volume.

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:40.899
- Yeah, so you're going to get some volume
with separation.

00:00:40.899 --> 00:00:43.420
- And it's supposed to have beeswax in it.

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:46.139
- And the beeswax provides volume that stays
soft to the touch all day.

00:00:46.139 --> 00:00:47.979
- Hey, lashes feel pretty soft.

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:49.000
- We're going to show you guys the--

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:51.959
- Wait, you forgot the most important part
about this mascara.

00:00:51.959 --> 00:00:52.459
- Okay, what?

00:00:52.459 --> 00:00:53.739
- The most important part.

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:54.619
- It's pink!

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:55.489
- It's pink!

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:58.659
- The packaging is super cute. We found it
at CVS, right?

00:00:58.659 --> 00:01:02.729
- Yes, we got it at CVS and it was the first
I had seen it. I grabbed it and then it was

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:05.690
funny because we went to another CVS and it
was there, too. So it seems like it's really

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:08.630
rolling out, because last we hard it was only
at Bed, Bath, and Beyond.

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.820
- Right.

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.100
- So, if you go to your local CVS, it might
be there already. Before we get into our little

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:17.330
review and what we think, you guys should
give us a thumbs up if you enjoy First Impressions.

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:20.470
- And if you want to see more of them, because
I think it's a really great way to kind of

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:23.980
just let you guys know straight off the bat
when we try something, what our initial feeling

00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:27.380
is. And then if you see it pop up in some
of our other videos like Favorites, you'll

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:31.660
know, you know, did it stay that way? Do we
really, really, love it? What is it? I want

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:35.480
to know. Alright, now we're going to show
you guys me applying it without any eyeliner

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:39.930
and Stefanie already has liquid eyeliner
on so that way you kind of see like a comparison

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:42.850
because typically we don't go without wearing
eyeliner but I think...

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:46.470
- It can look totally different on either
eye so it's good to see both.

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.230
- Yeah, it gives you a better visual of what
the lashes look like without that eyeliner

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:51.410
behind it. 

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:58.520
It's funny how you can almost tell
like immediately if you like a mascara formulation

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:08.140
or not. And this one I feel like I do. Buh-BLAM!
There's a commercial or something... Mascara,

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:13.359
no mascara. Mascara, what does that sounds
like? Jessie! And I like that I can come back

00:02:13.359 --> 00:02:17.999
over to this eye and it hasn't like gotten
to where I can't like add more. So just from

00:02:17.999 --> 00:02:22.120
applying it I will say I really like that
I can keep going over it and working with

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:27.299
the lashes and it doesn't start clumping up
or getting like spidery-looking. I feel like

00:02:27.299 --> 00:02:33.219
it does have a very like full fanned out effect
and I don't even really miss that I don't

00:02:33.219 --> 00:02:37.739
have eyeliner on right now which I think is
cool because it was able to get to the very

00:02:37.739 --> 00:02:42.159
root and make it look dark and I really like
it.

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:48.420
- For comparison, I am wearing eyeliner so
we're going to apply this with eyeliner on

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:54.200
because that's how I would normally do my
makeup. Well right off, I feel like this is

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.670
the most wet Cover Girl Formula I've ever
used.

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:58.529
- [Tracy] I actually thought it was kind of
drier.

00:02:58.529 --> 00:02:58.749
- Really?

00:02:58.749 --> 00:03:00.730
- [Tracy] Not drier than normal, but...

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:05.540
- I'm not mad at it. I know it's not, it doesn't
say it's super lengthening, but I feel like

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:11.739
it's kind of giving my lashes a longer look.
It's definitely defining my lashes 'cause

00:03:11.739 --> 00:03:16.179
my lashes are like, defined. I really like
it! 

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:20.700
So thoughts on this mascara. I like it,

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:25.209
I really do, you know, I think so far, the
Lash Blast line has kind of like, held up

00:03:25.209 --> 00:03:29.339
its name, I guess. I mean, we've liked pretty
much every single one of them.

00:03:29.339 --> 00:03:33.889
- Yeah, if you were to compare it to either
Lash Blast Volume, 'cause I feel like it's

00:03:33.889 --> 00:03:37.289
either Lash Blast Volume or Clump Crusher.
I feel like it's kind of in between those.

00:03:37.289 --> 00:03:42.840
- Yeah, I think for me, Tracy said it felt
a little drier. I thought the formula felt

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:46.599
a little wet but the brush felt a little bit
pointy and sharp and--

00:03:46.599 --> 00:03:50.599
- Not drier than their other ones, but drier
like...

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:51.949
- Then most mascaras.

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:53.219
- Like they're known for.

00:03:53.219 --> 00:03:56.430
- Yeah, yeah, it's definitely not a super
wet one like I would say Maybelline is. I

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:58.609
feel like Maybelline tends to be more wet.

00:03:58.609 --> 00:04:01.849
- I feel like their mascaras make my lashes
want to fall.

00:04:01.849 --> 00:04:06.239
- Yeah, and these have a good happy medium
to where I feel like they can get that lift

00:04:06.239 --> 00:04:07.310
and get that volume...

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:08.140
- Really coated...

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:09.659
- Yeah, without weighing it down.

00:04:09.659 --> 00:04:10.029
- Yeah.

00:04:10.029 --> 00:04:14.169
- I really liked it, I liked the brush on
this one. I felt like it kept my lashes from

00:04:14.169 --> 00:04:18.140
getting clumped together. It really gave them
that defined, like, "I'm lashes, not just

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:21.700
one big "giant thing on my eyeball, "but individual
lashes."

00:04:21.700 --> 00:04:27.010
- If you had to pick between Orange Lash Blast,
Clump Crusher, and this one, which would be...

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:30.640
- I think I need a little bit of time with
this one because I think I definitely go towards

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:35.650
the orange tube over Clump Crusher 'cause
it's like OG and I feel like it kind of is

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:38.850
like a, it does everything, but you know I
think this one can hold its own in there.

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:41.389
I think it's better for defining.

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:46.150
- Right, and with the original Lash Blast,
I do feel like sometimes if I get too heavy

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:48.750
handed, it can start to want to group up.

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:49.210
- Yeah.

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:52.790
- And this has a little bit, like she said,
more of the defining so I think that would

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:56.410
help kind of prevent that. But with Clump
Crusher sometimes I don't get as much volume

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:56.830
as I want.

00:04:56.830 --> 00:05:00.970
- And who knows, I may go back and like combine
this with a Cover Girl mascara and it might

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:02.950
work well like that too. I do, I really enjoy
it.

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:06.680
- Yeah, I do too, I love it, it's going to
be my new like, go-to mascara. We're going

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:10.780
to post a photo on Instagram later in the
day, so if you're watching this today, we're

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:14.470
going to have a photo so you guys can kind
of get like our final thoughts. Did it flake,

00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:15.949
because it's supposed to be flake free.

00:05:15.949 --> 00:05:16.510
