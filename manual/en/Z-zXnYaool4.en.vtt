Hello, today on Wondermint Kids, I'm here with my friend, Flora, who is a great artist.

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:07.500
Hi!

00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:13.100
And we are making a cute and fun project made
out of recycled crayons.  We learned it from Martha Stewart!

00:00:18.419 --> 00:00:19.419
 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:31.200
All right, to get started you'll need a few
old crayons, a muffin pan, and a parent or guardian to help you.

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:33.700
 

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:41.730
Okay, if you really want to get started, take
a lot of crayons and start peeling the wrappers off.

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:47.350
 

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:59.100
Now you can break up your crayons into tiny
pieces. If it's too hard using your fingers...

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:04.100
...ask an adult and they will cut it up with
a knife.

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:21.320
Now you're going to take a few crayons and
put them in your muffin pan.

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:28.500
And you can make any design you want and use any colors you want.

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:38.180
 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.000
 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Now, ask an adult to heat the oven to 150
degrees and then put your muffin pan into the oven.

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:12.000
And voila! This is what they'll look like!

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.000

Wow! Wow, that's so cool! Looks like an eraser.
