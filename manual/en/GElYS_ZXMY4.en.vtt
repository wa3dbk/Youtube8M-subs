00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:12.440
First, we went to Benefit!

00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:15.522
It's been a while since I last came and a tint balm was newly released.

00:00:15.522 --> 00:00:19.860
But it was too faint for my liking.

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:23.193
The best of Benefit is the POREfessional primer for certain.

00:00:23.193 --> 00:00:25.485
It lasts very long so you could do well with one.

00:00:29.296 --> 00:00:30.816
This place is Kiehl's!

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:32.500
Ssin is a Kiehl's mania.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:37.083
It's got good value for money and above all I collect the bottles for its design. LOL

00:00:37.783 --> 00:00:41.863
I bought a Kiehl's Ultra facial toner for 21 dollars this day.

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:46.480
I wanted to buy the purple cream as well, but I already have many...

00:00:46.631 --> 00:00:49.591
Next up, is the most anticipated Nars store.

00:00:49.637 --> 00:00:51.877
Nars does seem really expensive.

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:57.000
I really want every single eye-shadows and blushers.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.733
I go shopping with a bare face at all times. 

00:00:59.733 --> 00:01:04.974
Trying concealers, foundations, lip products and everything else on a bare face is the best way for checking it out. 

00:01:04.974 --> 00:01:08.822
The super recommendable product I found from Nars is the concealer.

00:01:12.738 --> 00:01:15.938
I've never seen one feel so silky as this before.

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.100
Goodbye~ The Face Shop~ LOL

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:29.980
Next, is Givenchy which, in Korea, can only be found at a duty-free shop.

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:36.800
Well.. this square one with four different coloured powder is said to be most popular.

00:01:36.989 --> 00:01:38.669
But I couldn't afford it.

00:01:39.574 --> 00:01:41.974
Givenchy has a very unique mascara.

00:01:41.974 --> 00:01:43.254
It looks like a chestnut.

00:01:44.814 --> 00:01:48.414
It is unique, but it seems hard to use on oriental eyes.

00:01:48.618 --> 00:01:55.098
I wanted to buy something else as a souvenir if there were anything nice, but couldn't find any...

00:02:12.325 --> 00:02:13.925
Then we stopped by Dior!

00:02:13.925 --> 00:02:17.329
It's the one that's always included in the best department store bands.

00:02:17.329 --> 00:02:20.534
The eye-shadows have good quality and there's a variety of products.

00:02:20.534 --> 00:02:24.874
But according to Serim the Dior fluid tint series are hopeless. LOL

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:31.760
On the other hand Tori says the Dior eye-shadow textures are fantastic.

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:42.380
I prefer the Channel eye-shadow texture to the silvery Dior's, but the Channel store didn't allow pictures.

00:02:43.772 --> 00:02:48.732
Then Tori discovered purple and pink mascaras and decided to go broke. LOL

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:03.380
Wow, for such a conservative brand to make this kind of product!

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:09.520
Next, is my much favored Laura Mercier!

00:03:09.796 --> 00:03:13.556
I think they're good at making foundations and powders.

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:17.420
Their dark and deep eye-shadows are good as well.

00:03:17.420 --> 00:03:20.380
The Laura Mercier powder foundation pact, I even gave my mom one.

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:43.080
Serim picked it up over a 100 times hesitating, but couldn't buy it in the end. 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:04:00.960
I brought the matt brick coloured lipstick which appeared on the Gong Hyo-jin make-up tutorial.

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:04.944
Next up, was Yves Saint Laurent which was the most crowded place!

00:04:04.944 --> 00:04:06.340
Yves Saint Laurent equals lip tints.

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:14.100
I don't really like lip tints, but these three brought one each taking advantage of my departure.

00:04:14.583 --> 00:04:20.423
Yeon-ju and Se-lim both brought coral orange-like #12 which is nice for daily wearing.

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:50.400
This is Bobbi Brown!

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:54.400
I really like Bobbi Brown's long-wear foundation

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:57.473
I've used it all now so I'm thinking whether or not to buy it again.

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:33.560
Bobbi Brown has great base make-up and skin care products so I want to buy a cream, but it's way too expensive. I'd have to pay at least ï¿¦150,000.

00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:36.980
Other colour make-up products like eye-shadows are also nice.

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:39.940
But, I haven't had any yet.

00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:51.180
Next, it's Kanebo which I most look forward to from this trip!

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:52.640
It's Luna Sol.

00:05:52.640 --> 00:06:01.660
No matter how many eye-shadows I used, Luna Sol had the best colour and shimmer. The problem is that you can only find it at a duty-free.

00:06:01.776 --> 00:06:08.576
There are eye-shadows with famous names such as beige-beige, coral coral etc.I truly want them all~!

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:12.200
I truly want them all~!

00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:13.180
SSin-nim got two things!

00:06:13.374 --> 00:06:15.934
I brought a total of 5 eye-shadow kits.

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:18.180
I'll show you how they look later!

00:06:19.075 --> 00:06:22.035
The last place we went was the Anna Sui store.

00:06:22.035 --> 00:06:25.813
We mostly buy Anna Sui stuff for the package then the product itself. 

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:30.680
They just know the women's mind of wanting one on their dresser!

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:39.500
They had this new star-shaped lipstick which I would've brought if there was a favorable colour, but there weren't, so too bad.

00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:45.980
The perfume design was just my style, but I didn't like the fragrance...LOL 

00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:14.660
Yeon-ju's looking at the nail polishes as expected.
