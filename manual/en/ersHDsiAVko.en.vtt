00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:11.820
Estimation of saponification value of oils
and fats

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:19.180
Saponification is the hydrolysis of fats or
oils in the presence of a base like potassium

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:25.750
hydroxide to afford glycerol and the salt
of the corresponding fatty acid. The saponification

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:31.210
value represents the number of milligrams
of the base required to neutralize the fatty

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:37.480
acids resulting from the complete hydrolysis
of 1 gram fat. The saponification value gives

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:43.449
an indication of the nature of fatty acids
present in triacylglycerols. The longer the

00:00:43.449 --> 00:00:48.920
carbon chain of the fat hydrolysed, the lesser
the amount of acid liberated per gram and

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.250
hence lower its saponification value.
Principle:

00:00:53.250 --> 00:01:00.690
When fats and oils are refluxed in an alcoholic
solution of KOH, glycerol and the potassium

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:06.960
salt of the corresponding fatty acids are
liberated. The amount of KOH used up in this

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:13.210
saponification process is then estimated by
titrating the test sample as well as the control

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:17.530
against 0.5 NHCl.

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:22.560
Procedure:
Weigh 1g of fat in a tared beaker

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:29.540
Add 5ml of the fat solvent. Mix well and transfer
the contents into a conical flask.

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:34.730
Rinse the beaker with 5ml of fat solvent and
transfer this to the conical flask.

00:01:34.730 --> 00:01:40.900
Mix well so that the fat dissolves completely
in the solvent. Label it as “Test”.

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:48.020
Now add 25 ml of 0.5N alcoholic KOH to the
conical flask.

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:54.550
The blank is prepared by adding 10 ml of the
fat solvent and 25 ml of 0.5N alcoholic KOH

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:58.600
into a seperate conical flask. Label it as
“Blank”.

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:03.770
Reflux condensers are fitted on both the flasks
and are heated in a boiling water bath for

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:08.140
30 min.
The conical flasks are removed from the bath

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:12.870
and are allowed to cool.
Add 1-2 drops of phenolphthalein indicator

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:17.389
into both the flasks.
The contents of the flasks are then titrated

00:02:17.389 --> 00:02:23.650
against 0.5N HCl taken in a burette
The endpoint of the titration is indicated

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:28.269
by the decolorisation of the pink soution
in the conical flasks.

00:02:28.269 --> 00:02:33.659
The volume of KOH consumed by the fat is obtained
from the titre values [(Blank- Test) ml].

00:02:33.659 --> 00:02:37.170
The amount of KOH can be calculated using
the equation

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:42.060
Amount of KOH consumed = Normality of KOH
x Volume of KOH consumed in ml x equivalent

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.129
weight
The saponification value can be calculated

00:02:46.129 --> 00:02:51.599
as the number of milligrams of KOH consumed
divided by the amount of fat taken intially

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:51.620
(1g).
