00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:06.279
We talked a lot about the draft. Now we're
going to go over some more about point scoring

00:00:06.279 --> 00:00:14.300
systems. Different leagues have totally different
point systems. Like I said, the standard usually

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:18.150
for a quarterback, twenty five yards equals
a point. Some leagues actually will have fifty

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.990
yards for a point. Some leagues will have
quarterbacks throwing touchdowns are four

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:32.800
points. Also, for example, a quarterback who
rushes a lot, say a guy like McNabb before

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:40.390
he got injured. He would get a point for every
ten yards. Quarterbacks are a lot different

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:43.649
in a lot of different leagues. For example
if you have a quarterback that has fifty yards

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:50.040
for a point, you want to take less emphasis
on a quarterback because it's harder outside

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.760
of like Payton Manning, Tom Brady and those
types of players, there's only four or five.

00:00:53.760 --> 00:01:02.540
If it's a league where I was talking about
where it's six points for a touchdown, there

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:07.810
will be more emphasis on a quarterback as
opposed to other leagues; same with running

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:15.680
backs and wide receivers as well. Looking
for a guy that's well rounded, is kind of

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:23.529
important. Also, when you have for different
roster spots, also look at your bench as well,

00:01:23.529 --> 00:01:28.990
that kind of determines who you?re going to
have on your team. It's real important. A

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:35.969
lot of guys will kind of load up on a position.
For me, I like to have one tight end and one

00:01:35.969 --> 00:01:41.119
defense on my team. I'd rather have my roster
like here we have like seven bench players.

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:49.149
I'd rather have a backup quarterbacks, running
backs and wide receivers. Unless you have

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:55.609
like a really, really elite defense, a lot
of times you might drop and pick up another

00:01:55.609 --> 00:02:01.420
guy during the season. I wouldn't really waste
my time. The same with kickers as well, they

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:07.719
are not that important to hold onto a roster
spot. Make sure you don't get caught up with

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:19.680
backing up every position with defense, kickers
and those other players. Also make sure again,

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:27.590
the bye weeks are huge. You might have a lot
of players you have to dump. If you get into

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:35.260
that situation, sometimes, you could make
a trade with other players. I'll talk a little

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.110
more about trades in a second.
