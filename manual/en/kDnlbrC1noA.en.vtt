00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:30.689
the snow falls

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:33.280
the absolute to get something else

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:35.610
look at her

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:37.280
perhaps

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:38.670

not the best shape it's in

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:03.740
but some sketches here

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:05.290
couple of scratches there

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:08.250
the outbreak here

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.490
for bringing all of this up an internet

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:13.380
mister perot

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:14.420
probably was

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:17.300
drop the soap useful to the tape for well
but

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:22.690
to these people together just finding out

00:01:22.690 --> 00:01:25.550
the children here

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:28.320
morgan's all around here and there

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.340
of more care

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:32.409
of that history

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:34.180
