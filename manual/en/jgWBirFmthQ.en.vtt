Hello,

00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:04.710
I'm Dr. Neal Schultz

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:05.710
[pause]

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:08.999
And welcome to DermTV.

00:00:08.999 --> 00:00:13.030
After a long day in your shoes, it's not unusual
to be greeted by

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:16.950
an unpleasant odor when you take them off,

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:20.180
especially in the winter when you’re wearing
heavy socks and boots,

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:24.390
which both contribute to excess sweating by
your feet.

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.170
To help prevent these unattractive odors,
there are easy remedies,

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:31.700
some of which don’t even require a visit
to your doctor.

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:32.899
But to understand the remedies,

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:36.690
let’s first understand what causes foot
odor.

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:40.129
Foot odor, just like underarm odor, is the
result of bacteria

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:42.030
acting on chemicals in your sweat.

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:43.710
If you don’t sweat

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.659
or there isn’t much bacteria, then there
isn’t an odor.

00:00:46.659 --> 00:00:52.079
But if there’s a lot of sweat or bacteria,
it will really smell.

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:54.979
Bacteria thrives and multiplies in moist,
warm areas,

00:00:54.979 --> 00:00:58.260
so if your feet sweat, the bacteria will grow
and multiply,

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.539
and the odor will get worse.

00:01:00.539 --> 00:01:02.589
This is why anything that decreases

00:01:02.589 --> 00:01:07.210
either perspiration or the bacteria will significantly
reduce the odor.

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:10.320
For starters, to reduce the amount of sweat,

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:14.180
try using your regular underarm antiperspirant.

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:16.500
In the morning in the bath or shower, make
sure

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.720
you soap between your toes as well as the
entire bottom of your foot.

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:25.250
Then thoroughly dry your toes and feet and
use your antiperspirant

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:27.240
on your feet and between your toes.

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:28.830
If that doesn’t help

00:01:28.830 --> 00:01:34.380
you may want to try Certain Dri, a very potent
antiperspirant.

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.030
Since antiperspirants decrease the amount
of sweat

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:39.780
and deodorants reduce the amount of bacteria,

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.520
if you’re still having a problem, get one
labeled as both

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.050
antiperspirant and deodorant, like this Arrid
product,

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:50.300
to help reduce both perspiration and bacteria.

00:01:50.300 --> 00:01:53.670
Additionally, after applying the antiperspirant,
deodorant,

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.200
also apply some powder like Zeasorb

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.170
which further helps by absorbing moisture.

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.570
If you still haven't beaten back your foot
odor, then try applying

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:08.479
a topical acne fighting antibiotic lotion,
gel or solution

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:12.250
on the bottom of your feet and between the
toes.

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:15.440
It will better help eliminate the odor causing
bacteria.

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:18.940
And also… avoid ointment and cream products.

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:22.390
Unfortunately, oral antibiotics won’t work
here

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:26.620
because the bacteria are on your skin, not
in it.

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.840
Extreme cases may require a change of socks
during the day

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.890
and reapplication of the topical products,

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:36.680
but everyone can reduce if not actually eliminate
foot odors

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:48.879
with these simple measures.
