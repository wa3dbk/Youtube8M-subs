00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:11.290
Hey guys, Sean Nalewanyj here of BodyTransformationTruth.com,
and in this video I want to answer another

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:17.750
very common question that I receive, which
is from people who say that they want to start

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:23.280
working out and start putting on some muscle,
but they don’t want to get “too big”

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:27.820
or “too bulky” and would rather just aim
for a more athletic look.

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:32.880
Now the problem with this question really
is that it’s ultimately coming from a highly

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:39.600
skewed perception of just how quickly (or
rather, just how slowly) the average person’s

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.300
body actually gains new muscle.

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:47.200
Assuming that you possess average muscle building
genetics and that you're not “chemically

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:53.430
enhanced” in any way, building muscle is
actually going to be a very slow and gradual

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.000
process for you, just like it is for everyone
else.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.670
If you’re a male and are a complete beginner
(because keep in mind that the less experienced

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.890
you are, the faster you’ll be able to build
new muscle, and vice versa), then you can

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:14.080
probably expect to put on anywhere from about
one quarter to half a pound of actual lean

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:18.460
muscle per week and that's assuming that you’re
doing everything correctly.

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:24.820
And since women have much lower natural testosterone
levels than men do, they can expect to progress

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:29.550
at a rate about half of that or even slightly
slower.

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:35.479
So in other words, unless you choose to intentionally
not look at yourself in the mirror, not weigh

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:42.130
yourself and not go out in public for a very
lengthy period of time, then the likelihood

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:47.031
that you’ll suddenly wake up one day to
realize that you’ve “gone too far” and

00:01:47.031 --> 00:01:51.970
have accidentally gotten “too big”, the
probabiity of that is virtually zero.

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:57.630
Instead, you’ll always see your increases
in muscle size unfolding from a mile away

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.980
and you’ll be able to easily adjust and
tweak your approach accordingly as you move

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:04.020
forward.

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:09.709
So for that reason, even if you’re not ultimately
looking to build a huge amount of muscle over

00:02:09.709 --> 00:02:16.169
the long run, your best bet is still to structure
your program in a way that maximizes your

00:02:16.169 --> 00:02:18.209
current rate of growth.

00:02:18.209 --> 00:02:24.719
Unless you are completely and absolutely out
to lunch on this, there is no realistic scenario

00:02:24.719 --> 00:02:30.139
where you’ll mistakenly get “too big”
or “too bulky”, and intentionally taking

00:02:30.139 --> 00:02:35.650
actions to slow down your muscle building
progress right from the start, that's only

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:40.989
going to increase the chances that you’ll
ultimately end up failing altogether.

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:47.079
Whether the person emailing me for advice
is a female looking to put on 8 pounds of

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:52.449
muscle and get a “lean and toned” body
or a male who's looking to gain 40 pounds

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:57.700
of muscle and get as big and ripped as possible,
the basic bodybuilding approach that I would

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:01.969
give to either person would ultimately still
be the same.

00:03:01.969 --> 00:03:07.510
If a situation eventually arose where either
person reached a level of muscular development

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:12.900
that they were completely satisfied with,
they could then make adjustments to their

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:18.629
overall plan in order to prevent further muscle
growth and to make sure that they just maintain

00:03:18.629 --> 00:03:20.120
their current build.

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:25.790
And the simple way of doing that is to keep
everything in your program the same in terms

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:31.249
of training and nutrition, except that you're
going to want to lower your daily energy intake

00:03:31.249 --> 00:03:35.529
from a calorie surplus down to your calorie
maintenance level.

00:03:35.529 --> 00:03:39.799
So the bottom line on this is, whether you’re
a male or a female, and whether you’re aiming

00:03:39.799 --> 00:03:46.540
to gain 5 pounds of muscle or 50, there’s
no need at all to worry about “getting too

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:52.370
big” or intentionally structuring your program
in a way that moderates how quickly you put

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:54.379
on new muscle.

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:59.400
Even if an average male is training and eating
perfectly for his body type, he’s still

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:05.400
only going to put on around 2 pounds of actual
lean muscle per month as a beginner, with

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:09.299
the rate of growth steadily decreasing as
he becomes more experienced.

00:04:09.299 --> 00:04:15.219
And like I said before, women are going to
progress at a rate roughly half of that.

00:04:15.219 --> 00:04:20.820
And on top of this, also keep in mind that
there is no such thing as “lean muscle”

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:23.629
versus “bulky muscle” like some people
think.

00:04:23.629 --> 00:04:28.740
Muscle tissue is muscle tissue, and you’re
either gaining it, maintaining it or losing

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:29.789
it.

00:04:29.789 --> 00:04:34.379
Someone who you consider “too big” is
not that way because they somehow possess

00:04:34.379 --> 00:04:36.060
a different “type” of muscle.

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:41.130
Instead, they’re simply carrying a larger
amount of it, and the appearance of that muscle

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:47.289
may also be further “enhanced” because
that person has particularly low body fat

00:04:47.289 --> 00:04:48.289
levels.

00:04:48.289 --> 00:04:53.009
So, if you’re wanting to put on some muscle,
then just aim to maximize your current rate

00:04:53.009 --> 00:04:57.099
of growth regardless of how much you’re
specifically aiming to gain.

00:04:57.099 --> 00:05:00.740
