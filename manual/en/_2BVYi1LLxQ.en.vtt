What's up fish tank people? Fishtanktv.com
Dustin's Fish Tanks bringing it to you on

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:11.269
a Sunday absolutely beautiful beautiful day
outside. I'm in here this morning before 9

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:17.759
o clock getting water changes on 3 tanks.
Excited to show you Species Sunday on some

00:00:17.759 --> 00:00:23.989
Rainbow fish, check it out. Been a lot of
people asking me about Rainbow fish. My fish

00:00:23.989 --> 00:00:28.269
look good. The tank actually got about a 80%
water change. I still need to get in there

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:34.000
and when I really have the time with a slow
siphon and dig out all the dirty parts, it's

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
real gross. I got out like gobs and gobs and
gobs of Baby's Tears out of this tank and

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:43.940
plants constants. Yeah it's dirty, yeah it's
a mess. It still looks pretty hot considering

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:48.330
the lack of attention I give it. I should
do a video of this tank really really polished.

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:52.100
Anyways, this is after an 80% water change,
two screaming kids doesn't make it easy to

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.140
get in there and actually get all the stuff
out, but lets talk about some Rainbows folks.

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:02.079
Let me tell you this, Rainbows alright from
Australia/New Guinea region, fresh water lakes,

00:01:02.079 --> 00:01:06.340
habitats that sort of thing. I actually checked
out a YouTube video of some guy catching them

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:11.539
living in Australia, had a cool little trap,
very cool. I have been a big fan of Rainbows

00:01:11.539 --> 00:01:17.710
for a really long time as you all know, so
I want to show them here. Rainbow fish, most

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:23.869
fish love big water changes. These guys just
got a huge water change, they love it. Their

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:30.869
colors come out like KAPOW, in your face the
colors. Right there is a Parke Soni. It might

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.439
be there's another species with them I don't
know. I believe it's a Parke Soni. Anyway

00:01:34.439 --> 00:01:40.399
any gurus out there please correct me. These
are all Melatonai I believe is how you say

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:45.369
is Fredrickii. I can't pronounce anything.
There is the only native wild caught male

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:52.310
I have left, the rest all jumped out. Luckily
I got a lot of females and babies in there.

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.020
They haven't grown much because I haven't
done many water changes on it, and they are

00:01:55.020 --> 00:02:01.639
in a kind of small tank for the amount of
fish load in there. Now this one right here,

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:05.079
I'm wondering your opinions on. I actually
just bought it because it looks hot. I'm not

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:09.570
exactly sure what it is, it might be some
sort of hybrid. I'm not sure, it kind of looks

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:16.570
like a cross between Bosmani because it has
that real bright tail, but then it has those

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:22.760
lines here so I am curious as to hear what
you all think it is. I saw one that was labeled

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:27.770
a Prachoct, I don't think this is a Prachoct
though. I love your opinion on it and that

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:30.650
happens a lot by the way with Rainbow fish,
you'll see like cross breeding them and be

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:36.250
like oh its a new species. No its just a cross
breed. And that's unfortunate too actually

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:43.250
you want to get pure species and continue
the genes like that. Rainbow fish high veggie

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:49.640
diets, love huge water changes do not, do
not, do not in my humble opinion put Rainbow

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:55.240
fish in less than a 55 gallon tank, its mean.
They are big swimmers, they like current,

00:02:55.240 --> 00:03:02.240
they like lots of space to swim. This tank
is kind of over crowded there. Little bit

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:07.210
of pearling action going on over there. Pearling
is when CO2 is released ... I'm sorry Oxygen

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:13.930
is released from the plants, so these guys
are growing, loving it. Yeah tell me what

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:17.340
you know about Rainbows, tell me what you
want to know about Rainbows. I'm flying here

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:20.600
because my little daughter is about to go
to sleep. Playing in the sprinkler today folks,

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:25.270
had a lot of fun with that. Madagascar Lace,
a lot of people have been asking me on Aquatic

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:29.080
Jungles to get more Madagascar Lace. Let me
tell you folks, when I get more Lace in, I

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:33.630
will let you know. So we are having a good
time on that. Big water change on this tank.

00:03:33.630 --> 00:03:38.680
What else was I going to tell you about this
tank? I don't know, Rainbows let me know what

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:43.190
you want to know, put it in the comments I'll
holler at you about it. Having a lot of fun

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:47.810
loving how these fish look. This loach by
the way bigger than the one in the 220 because

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:53.319
he is dominating, dominating, dominating the
snails in here. I wanted to give a shout out

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:56.350
on some people who corrected me on a video.
Remember the video in the greenhouse with

00:03:56.350 --> 00:04:00.880
the 40 tall looking at the Baby's Tears whoever
corrected me on that being a female shrimp,

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:05.910
good for you thank you. I don't know everything.
I added some ugly males out there. I always

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:10.130
thought males were the better-looking shrimp
but I'm wrong. I haven't looked and verified

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:14.569
it but whatever. Got some more shrimp out
there, hoping to get some babies out there.

00:04:14.569 --> 00:04:20.780
Oh by the way I got some Red Tiger Lotus in,
you know how long these last. I absolutely

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:24.100
love getting the Lotus in. People have been
asking me about the Peru fish too, Ill tell

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:31.100
you real quick about them. Here are some of
the remaining Peru fish. I have the checkerboard

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:37.460
cichlid right here, one of the severums, and
the angels in the back. The 125 I haven't

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:42.000
been talking about, I've kind of been in mourning
2 months back the angelfish I had for 7 or

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:49.000
8 years died. So now out of respect to that
fish I might be bringing these fish up in

00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:54.260
the 125. I wasn't going to put any angelfish
in that tank while he was still alive. He's

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:58.590
no longer with us so that means your life
is about to get better big man. What's up

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:05.350
Peruvian Angel, how are you living? So the
Lotus love the 50% water change too, you can

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:11.310
see it right here, new leaves just bumping
out. A thing on trimming leave too, if any

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:14.780
leaves look ragged you're going to want to
pluck them out. That I would pluck. That I

00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:20.490
would pluck. Ragged get rid of that. Get rid
of that. That Severum just yawned look at

00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:26.520
that. I wish his friends didn't die, they
were out in the green house. Also Crinum Calimastratum

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:30.940
tons of them and Crinum Betans back here,
tons of them. These are plants that if I don't

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:35.290
sell, I don't care because I just think there
rad. So that's what I'm doing. Welcome new

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.419

00:05:43.419 --> 00:05:48.480
that. Have to do an intro video on Anabs.
Slacking folks. Slacking, slacking, slacking.

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:53.020
I was up in New York City this week had a
good old time. So I'm excited making a video

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:58.800
for you all. Shout outs to everyone that was
on the spreecast I did last night I was doing

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:02.680
a live video, I'm going to start doing those.
It's going to be a pro feature folks, pros

00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:06.990
is getting worked on. I was kind of testing
it out. Thanks to everyone for their patience

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:10.740
for working with me their. I finally got it
working people were hitting me up with questions

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:15.730
and I was able to answer them live, in the
flesh. Doing a little live video action, having

00:06:15.730 --> 00:06:20.540
some fun. Hope you are having a great day,
I know I am. Water changes always make me

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:24.490
feel better. Let me know what you know and
what you want to know about rainbow fish.
