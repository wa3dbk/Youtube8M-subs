00:00:00.166 --> 00:00:07.433
President Obama:
Well, I want to welcome President Santos here.

00:00:07.433 --> 00:00:09.333
This is the first time that
we've met face to face,

00:00:09.333 --> 00:00:14.100
although we had a wonderful
conversation on the phone.

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:17.200
He has already, I think, in the
short time that he's been in

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:20.834
office shown remarkable
leadership.

00:00:20.834 --> 00:00:25.000
Yesterday was a big day for the
people of Colombia and those who

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.400
are seeking peace in the region;
because of outstanding work by

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:37.900
Colombian security forces, they
were able to embark on a mission

00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:41.133
that resulted in the death of
the leader of FARC.

00:00:41.133 --> 00:00:45.300
The people of Colombia have been
plagued by this terrorist

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:51.934
insurgency for a very long time,
and as a consequence of the

00:00:51.934 --> 00:00:53.934
success of Colombian security
forces,

00:00:53.934 --> 00:00:58.300
I think we now have the chance
to see continued stability in

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:00.767
Colombia and in the region.

00:01:00.767 --> 00:01:03.667
And that will create the
prospects for peace and

00:01:03.667 --> 00:01:06.967
development under President
Santos's leadership.

00:01:06.967 --> 00:01:09.567
So I congratulate him.

00:01:09.567 --> 00:01:11.700
The friendship between our two
countries is extraordinarily

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.800
important to us.

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:19.300
We are working not just in
dealing with things like drug

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:22.900
interdiction, but we're also
interested in figuring out how

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:26.567
we can continually improve our
economic cooperation,

00:01:26.567 --> 00:01:30.333
our political cooperation, and
our people-to-people exchanges

00:01:30.333 --> 00:01:34.734
so that we continually deepen
these bilateral ties.

00:01:34.734 --> 00:01:40.667
I think that President Santos
also likes to boast about the

00:01:40.667 --> 00:01:45.734
fact that his Kansas Jayhawks
have won a number of

00:01:45.734 --> 00:01:48.667
championships in basketball.

00:01:48.667 --> 00:01:52.867
And I was a little disappointed
with them last year because I

00:01:52.867 --> 00:01:54.400
bet on them winning it all, and
they lost.

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:55.700
(laughter)

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:57.667
But he's already apologized to
me for that.

00:01:57.667 --> 00:01:59.967
So I want to welcome the
President.

00:01:59.967 --> 00:02:02.333
Again, congratulations on a
great start.

00:02:02.333 --> 00:02:06.200
We are confident that we will -- we'll be able to strengthen the

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.300
cooperation between our two nations.

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:10.767
President Santos:
Thank you.

00:02:10.767 --> 00:02:14.800
I want to thank President Obama
for his warm welcome and his

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:17.033
generous words.

00:02:17.033 --> 00:02:22.133
We value in Colombia very much
our very special relations with

00:02:22.133 --> 00:02:24.333
the United States.

00:02:24.333 --> 00:02:28.200
We're coming, ourselves, into a
new era.

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:33.633
Now that the security problem is
more or less solved,

00:02:33.633 --> 00:02:39.200
we can now turn to a more
progressive agenda.

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.734
Social development, the
prosperity of our people,

00:02:43.734 --> 00:02:46.233
climate change, the environment
--

00:02:46.233 --> 00:02:51.567
those are the type of issues
that we can now include in our agenda.

00:02:51.567 --> 00:02:56.600
And we want to enhance our
relation to a true partnership

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:03.934
where Colombia and the U.S. can work together in the region and

00:03:03.934 --> 00:03:08.500
outside the region for our mutual benefit.

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:15.633
I am proud of being a graduate
from the University of Kansas.

00:03:15.633 --> 00:03:20.967
As President Obama knows, we are
very good in basketball.

00:03:20.967 --> 00:03:25.333
But I told him when he called me
what the Republicans say about

00:03:25.333 --> 00:03:26.433
my education.

00:03:26.433 --> 00:03:29.467
I was -- afterwards I went to Harvard.

00:03:29.467 --> 00:03:33.200
And they say I was educated in
Kansas and corrupted in Harvard.

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:34.633
(laughter)

00:03:34.633 --> 00:03:39.934
I don't think that -- you also graduated from Harvard and I'm

00:03:39.934 --> 00:03:45.900
sure that only the Republicans think that -- not the Democrats.

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:47.266
(laughter)

00:03:47.266 --> 00:03:49.867
President Obama:
Well, actually, they all -- they think I was corrupted somewhere.

00:03:49.867 --> 00:03:51.967
(laughter)

00:03:51.967 --> 00:03:52.967
Welcome.

00:03:52.967 --> 00:03:54.367
Thank you so much.
