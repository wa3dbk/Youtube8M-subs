00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:07.790
I'm the kid that always looked overhead when
a plane passed by.

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:10.790
Something about aviation drew me in.

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:11.950
I love flying.

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:15.160
I love photographing flying.

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:19.860
Aviation photography is a passion of mine,
and it's amazing to be sitting in the back

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:26.470
of a photo ship with the doors removed, watching
the world pass by below.

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:32.300
I'm a pilot, and I'm a photographer, and being
able to combine the two with what I do is

00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:33.620
just amazing.

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:36.730
I'm asked a lot 'How did you take that photo?'

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:40.050
I love when people ask me that because it
means that the photo has touched them in some

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:44.500
way, and they stop and question how was this
photo made.

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:54.270
I'm Jessica Ambats, and I'm a photographer.

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.480
My goal is to capture the beauty of flight.

00:00:56.480 --> 00:00:59.890
What makes air-to-air photography different
is that you are up there with this flying

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:04.199
machine in its element, watching an awesome
pilot as your wingman.

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.310
I've got the best seat at my own personal
air show.

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:14.390
Today, we're shooting the L39 with the Citation,
and I have a vision of what photo I want to

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:15.390
get.

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.750
Up in the air, you need to translate that
vision into a reality.

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:21.930
You need to be thinking several steps ahead
at all times.

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:25.350
When you are in the back of an airplane, it's
an intense environment.

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.280
It's noisy, it's windy, it's cold.

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.409
You need to position the photo ship relative
to the background...

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:32.409
[Pilot speaking.

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:35.640
Jessica speaking to pilot]...positioning the
subject plane relative to each other...

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.140
[Jessica speaking.

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.670
Pilot speaking]... and trying to see it from
all perspectives.

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:42.740
[Jessica speaking.

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:44.799
Pilot speaking]

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:50.420
I feel so fortunate to work with the top pilots
in the world, and the pilots make all the

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:51.420
difference.

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:52.420
It's not just the photographer.

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:57.009
It's a team effort, and as a pilot myself,
it's just awe-inspiring to watch these guys

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:00.229
fly.

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:06.100
It's just an incredible sight, and through
my camera, I get to share that with the world.

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:10.700
I've found what I love to do, and I see myself
doing this forever.

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.120
I'm Jessica Ambats, and I'm an aviation photographer.
