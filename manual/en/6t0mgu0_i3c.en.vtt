00:00:18.533 --> 00:00:22.233
Hello... again.

00:00:22.233 --> 00:00:25.333
Despite my personal feelings on the matter

00:00:25.333 --> 00:00:28.366
it seems I will be forced

00:00:28.366 --> 00:00:30.833
to tell you about...

00:00:30.833 --> 00:00:31.766
them.

00:00:31.766 --> 00:00:36.233
Kit Brinney: Well, they definitely do 
not like people talkin' about 'em.

00:00:36.233 --> 00:00:39.500
I mean... you've seen 'em right?

00:00:40.633 --> 00:00:44.433
Malvolio Portius (OS): Chua, 
nasty little rodents they are.

00:00:44.433 --> 00:00:46.033
Of course you can't deny the buggers

00:00:46.033 --> 00:00:48.400
are brilliant at what they do.

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.500
If it can be built and it needs to hurt people

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.733
the Chua are the ones for the job.

00:00:52.733 --> 00:00:54.933
It's just unfortunate that the furry little fiends

00:00:54.933 --> 00:00:57.000
are certifiable psychopaths.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:57.900
(scream)

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.666
Kit Brinney: They call 
themselves the Mordesh.

00:01:01.666 --> 00:01:04.200
I call 'em weird and creepy,

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:07.033
infected with some kind of disease.

00:01:07.033 --> 00:01:10.066
That being said, they do know a lot about science

00:01:10.066 --> 00:01:11.800
and alchemy and the like.

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.566
Although from what I gather

00:01:13.566 --> 00:01:15.000
it's the forbidden kind.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.400
it's the forbidden kind.
(smash)

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.200
Listen, I probably said too much already.

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.200
I best be off before my mouth 
really gets me in trouble.

00:01:28.333 --> 00:01:31.966
Malvolio Portius: I suppose every 
great empire has a dark,

00:01:31.966 --> 00:01:34.733
cutely grotesque underbelly.

00:01:34.733 --> 00:01:38.300
Personally, I do my best to avoid the little demons.

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:42.700
I find life is much easier that way.

00:01:44.066 --> 00:01:45.833
Oh not again.

00:01:45.833 --> 00:01:46.600
(beep)

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:47.500
(explosion)

00:01:47.566 --> 00:01:52.566
(cackling laughter)

00:01:54.266 --> 00:01:56.633
(whispers): Shhhhhh...
