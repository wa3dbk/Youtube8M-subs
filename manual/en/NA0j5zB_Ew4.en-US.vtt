00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:04.690
Tara: We're here today with David Solomon
of Peachtree Audio and he's doing trainings

00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:08.910
at Crutchfield today. So we're just going
to talk to you a little bit and learn a little

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:15.610
bit more about Peachtree. So, we have here
the Peachtree musicBox and we just heard it

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:22.519
here. It's a very impressive, high-end system
that's perfect for a desk, for an office.

00:00:22.519 --> 00:00:29.259
David: Mostly people will take and hook their
computer up directly to the musicBox via a

00:00:29.259 --> 00:00:35.700
USB cable. And that would just give you the
zeros and ones, ones and zeros coming off

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:41.449
the computer right into our D-to-A converter.
So you no longer have to rely on the little

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:46.109
headphone jack that have on the output of
your computer, because they never really sounded

00:00:46.109 --> 00:00:52.539
very good anyway. That was an analog output.
In using the analog output, you would actually

00:00:52.539 --> 00:00:59.280
have to rely on the power supply of your computer,
which, and the soundcard of your computer,

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:04.869
which if you've ever really tried to do that
isn't very good. We actually only take the

00:01:04.869 --> 00:01:11.670
ones and zeros, run them through the musicBox.
We then use our D-to-A converter, our two

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:17.970
preamplifier and our high-current to drive
the Nearfield monitors that are on your desk.

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:20.340
Tara: And you were playing music from your
computer...?

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:21.500
David: Yes, I was.

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.729
Tara: And tell me, just remind me a little
bit about the files that you were playing.

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:31.150
David: We know that a lot of files on the
computers are very hard crunched, even down

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:42.439
to, like, 128 kbps, which would be ten times
lower than, say, a CD player, or lower quality.

00:01:42.439 --> 00:01:46.860
We knew a lot of people had this kind of information
on their systems, because when you download

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:53.700
music, a lot of times it is at 128 k. So we
wanted to be able to make sure that even at

00:01:53.700 --> 00:02:01.159
the highest compression rate, music still
sounded like music. So a lot of the stuff

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:07.990
that you were listening to was at 128. In
fact, this particular file that I've got,

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:14.490
or playlist that I've got on my computer,
everything is doubled. One song is at full

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:22.300
bit or lossless, and the next one right up
under it is down to 128 k. And we've got all

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:29.070
of these listings, so we just did a little
demo of that with a lot of your folks, and...

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:33.760
Tara: Yeah, and some of them couldn't tell
the difference, because you were asking us

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:38.830
to say which was the lossless file and which
was the 128 k file. And very few people could

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:42.843
tell the difference, which really says a lot
about the musicBox. Just that it was able

00:02:42.843 --> 00:02:46.050
to do a phenomenal job, even with a highly
compressed file.

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:49.010
