00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:09.500
Hi! So I guess you're wondering why we're at the 'Shakespeare's Globe' today!

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
...Again, you have a book, are we doing 'Reading'?

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:14.500
No, It's a writing lesson.

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:16.000
...You have a book.

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:17.100
'Writing'!

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:18.500
You're 'READING'!

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:22.250
Where's your pen? You don't even have a pen!

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.000
So I guess you're wondering why we're at 'Shakespeare's Globe',

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.500
Why I'm writing, with a PEN!

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Is it because we're doing a writing lesson, Aly?

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:35.800
Why do you have to be an arsehole?

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.500
Your lesson starts n...

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.500
So last lesson, we looked at words to replace "But"

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Such as:

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:56.000
All of them mean "But"

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.500
But some with a little difference

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
"Having said that" is like 'To think again...'

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.500
'On second thought'

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
AH! Who are you?

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.500
I'm Mathilda

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Why are you crying?

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:25.000
Ahhh that's sad.

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.500
You probably didn't have a good teacher like me or Tom!

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:30.750
So you want to say:

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
This situation,

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.500
should, but DIDN'T affect the other situation.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Yes.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.750
Ah, for this, you can use the word: "Despite"

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.250
"Despite"?

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:47.250
Yes :)

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:48.750
But we need to use "despite",

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.250
with the sentence that SHOULD have,

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.000
but DIDN'T affect the other situation.

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.750
The grammar needs to change with this word.

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:59.250
First, the "SUBJECT pronoun":

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.250
Change it, to an "OBJECT pronoun".

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:09.000
Next, the VERB:

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.000
The form doesn't matter, "Past", "Present", "Perfect", whatever!

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.800
You can reduce it to only the "Gerund",

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:19.000
(the "VERB + ING" form)

00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:21.750
The next sentence, nothing changes.

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:24.000
So it looks like this:

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.250
Yes! Well done!

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:33.000
Is that better, Mr. Aly?

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
Much better! See! Studying with me and Tom,

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:38.500
will help you learn English much better!

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:41.250
Aww, look at these two!

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:43.750
So in love!

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.250
Oh what's that face for?

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:52.500
Well don't worry, erm...

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.000
Ah! look at her face!

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.500
I'm think, for her, maybe it's not important

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:02.750
See! And I'm sure that she loves you!

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000
See! So, she wants to say 2 things:

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:09.250
1: I love you

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.000
and 2: You don't have any money.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
So, she can use "despite"

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:22.000
Remember the changes!

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.500
SUBJECT pronoun - OBJECT pronoun

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.750
VERB - 'Gerund' (ING) form

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:30.000
But this is a negative,

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:32.500
How do we make a 'negative gerund'?

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
With the word: "Not"

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:45.250
The 'despite' sentence can be first,

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:53.500
or second, but it must introduce the correct sentence.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.500
The sentence which which DOESN'T, but SHOULD affect the other.

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000
Oh, also, we can say: "In spite of"

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:05.000
It means exactly the same as 'despite'

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:07.750
and the grammar changes in the same way.

00:04:08.250 --> 00:04:10.250
So, OH! it's her friend...

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.500
She wants to tell her friend about this situation...

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:23.750
Try to remember how to change the sentence...

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:42.000
We can also use "nevertheless"

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:44.500
It has more or less the same feeling,

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.500
but the GRAMMAR DOESN'T CHANGE!

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:51.500
Here's another example of using "Nevertheless"

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:19.250
Follow us on Twitter

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:23.250
Or somebody will beat me.
