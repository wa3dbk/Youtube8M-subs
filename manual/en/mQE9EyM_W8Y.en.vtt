Dr. Peter Basser: Some children  get, you know, are in accidents: car accidents, bike accidents, accidents on

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:14.420
the playground,

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:17.980
that hurt the brain and we'd like to be able to detect

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:21.020
the damage that's done. And, you know,

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:24.419
to help them get better over time.

00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:29.860
So that they can return to school and their normal lives.

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:35.980
Brain imaging is, represents

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:40.410
or is a group of approaches [ways] that doctors and scientists use

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.520
to look inside the brain without having to open

00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:48.240
the brain up.  So it gives us a way

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:51.400
of looking inside the body

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.400
without requiring any surgery or blood.

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:03.900
Dr. Joelle Sarlls: A scanner is another word we use for an MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging) machine,

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:07.360
so sometimes we call it an MRI scanner. And I think that's

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:11.500
just because it produces an image. Peter: If you're going in to get an MRI [Magnetic Resonance Imaging],

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:15.070
there's nothing to be afraid of. You basically go into a

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:18.530
tube where there's a large magnetic field that's completely

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:22.420
safe.  And you might hear some clicking and clacking,

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:26.840
but what's happening is that the instruments are recording

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.880
the moving of water molecules

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:36.229
in your body. And that data is then taken to a computer and processed

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:41.780
and you can generate [create] an image of the brain or another organ in the body.

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:46.250
So these different colors that you see in the image represent

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:51.030
different pathways or you could think of them as roads that connect

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.729
different parts of the brain together.

00:01:52.729 --> 00:01:57.009
And this is one of the ways that we can see whether the brain is normal

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:01.490
or whether it's been changed in disease [when the patient is sick].
Joelle: Then here's some of the vertebrae [bones that make up your spine] and

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:06.560
the spinal cord, right here that turns into the brain stem [connects the brain to the spinal cord].

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.269
And this is the corpus callosum,

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:14.110
it's the super highway that connects the  two halves of the brain.

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:18.799
Here's the nose and the tongue.

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:22.000
