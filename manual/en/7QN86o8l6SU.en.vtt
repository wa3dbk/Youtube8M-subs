00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:11.240
 

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:12.960
this is the super hard part

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:14.810
is making something that's so soft like snow

00:00:14.810 --> 00:00:18.370
feel like it's going to impact the big

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:22.090
yet feel like it's got that impact
our main character delsin has basically the coolest powers

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:23.610
it's like going up to a genie and asking for more wishes

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:27.160
what happens is when he's near other
conduits he picks up their ability

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:30.980
the first part that he gets is the snow power
that means you can drain it

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:33.770
that means he can turn it he can project it

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:37.700
we you think about where there's smoking in a city you think of maybe chimneys

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:39.770
fires

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:43.580
you can get smoked from vehicles in this
game but you have to destroy them first

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:47.340
and of course those end up blowing up and
blowing up other things around them

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:51.340
and those things smoke now become smoke sources every designer loves a burning car

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:54.240
I don't know why but every effects
artist has to do this at some point

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:57.310
PlayStation 4 is really allowing us to do
some things that we can do

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:01.080
before and that means writing new tools a new
particle systems

00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:04.989
to accommodate that all of our particles
are self shadowing

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:09.010
taking environment light and you can see
that the particles are actually

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:12.260
affected by the environment shadows well
it just makes everything feel more

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:14.310
connected to the world it brings it all
together

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.350
honestly for me the effects are the
coolest part of the game

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:19.900
right now

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:22.960
in a fluid fashion the combo up melee
hits

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:26.060
to dashes and moving away evasion stuff

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:29.610
shooting to dash back and you can bash
through guys and grab them

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:32.950
and foot mover bam oh that's beautiful

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:37.439
it inspires that visceral reaction of
people when they see it

00:01:37.439 --> 00:01:41.090
focus tosses things in the air and they kind of like almost hover with the

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:44.799
program and then they blow up

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:48.479
it's like wind gusts

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:53.670
whirlwind of smoke to have me back

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.450
and then all that scraps
in the air Wow i'm gonna shoot this thing

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:57.939
right in front of me

00:01:57.939 --> 00:02:00.659
so in the middle combat and there's

00:02:00.659 --> 00:02:05.060
bullets flying at you grenades whatever
is coming at you you dodge left guard right

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.670
completely dematerialize and then
materialize somewhere else

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.019
you can also dashed into vents so made this

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:15.030
backwards he sort of swirls in and he sort of cranks it up

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:18.700
and he does a sort of corkscrew as he jumps

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.860
its um just one of those things that just gives you all this energy and you can sort of

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:26.430
jump into combat jump in action and feel so
I

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.239
powerful and quick and you almost
want to get to 100 and your waiting for that

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:33.160
moment to get to 100 so that you can
unleash these powers that they didn't

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.150
even know you had delsin basically

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.410
cutting up a storm of smoke and ash I
think that if you

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:42.489
tend to like you can push all the
ambiance down and it gets kind of quite almost

00:02:42.489 --> 00:02:43.840
like a detail

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.459
and it has like that phew explode

00:02:47.459 --> 00:02:50.769
we're really push it we have delsin go as
high as frikin possible

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:55.489
here he is in the air he sort of tucks 
by the time it gets to

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:58.970
to about here his reformed backward

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:02.450
then he kind of dive bombs and at

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:07.660
that point he's kind of 
dematerialize anything breakable it's going to destroy

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:11.000
yeah any car it's gonna toss tumble throw any person

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.410
yeah the maximum number
of things flying around in the air

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:20.000
we're trying to make you feel like you're
an unstoppable force

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.590
and it takes wave after wave of enemy to

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:27.819
give you challenge your characters is the
weapon not something that's really

00:03:27.819 --> 00:03:32.690
turned out to be a lot of fun

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:32.940
