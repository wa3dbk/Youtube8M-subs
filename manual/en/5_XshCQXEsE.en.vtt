00:00:18.235 --> 00:00:22.236
A sunny Sunday morning in May 2010,

00:00:22.236 --> 00:00:25.241
I was running in the forest near my home,

00:00:25.241 --> 00:00:28.659
the sunshine filtered through
the bright green spring leaves

00:00:28.659 --> 00:00:30.736
and dappled the ground.

00:00:30.736 --> 00:00:35.759
My mind was busy with my plans,
I felt happy and excited.

00:00:35.759 --> 00:00:40.778
I had finally decided to follow my dream
and had resigned my job

00:00:40.778 --> 00:00:43.246
to go freelance.

00:00:43.246 --> 00:00:45.066
I was passionate about my work

00:00:45.066 --> 00:00:49.258
but I wanted more time
for my other passions, including running.

00:00:49.258 --> 00:00:53.249
I had already run two marathons
and was training for Berlin marathon

00:00:53.249 --> 00:00:55.244
later that year.

00:00:55.244 --> 00:00:57.053
I love running.

00:00:57.053 --> 00:01:01.735
When I run I feel as though my body
is doing what it's meant to do.

00:01:01.735 --> 00:01:07.088
The physical, emotional and rational
melt seamlessly together.

00:01:07.088 --> 00:01:09.500
If I'm stressed, I feel better.

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.767
If I have a problem
or I'm looking for inspiration

00:01:12.767 --> 00:01:15.260
I find my solutions.

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:23.038
Running always gives me
energy and strength.

00:01:23.038 --> 00:01:27.249
The last day of that month
was to be the last day of my old life,

00:01:27.249 --> 00:01:31.040
and it was â€“
by some freakish coincidence

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:35.241
that day I was told I had cancer.

00:01:36.741 --> 00:01:40.243
I was in shock,
it didn't make any sense

00:01:40.243 --> 00:01:43.260
and the only relief I could find
was when I was running,

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:47.501
when for a few moments I felt calm
and control of my thoughts.

00:01:47.501 --> 00:01:51.270
I couldn't imagine how I would go
through the coming months without that,

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.220
and so I decided that no matter what 
I would keep on running.

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:00.767
Chemo was hell,
a bit like a bad hangover,

00:02:00.767 --> 00:02:04.514
one that goes on and on and on,
relentlessly.

00:02:04.514 --> 00:02:09.494
I would wake up every morning feeling 
so bad that I really wished I hadn't.

00:02:09.494 --> 00:02:11.765
Nausea, a bad taste,

00:02:11.765 --> 00:02:16.247
food was so disgusting
I really had to force myself to eat.

00:02:16.247 --> 00:02:21.240
Heartburn, constipation, 
infections, pain, fatigue,

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.756
forgetfulness, confusion,

00:02:23.756 --> 00:02:28.251
I would get lost going home
from the hospital despite my frequent visits,

00:02:28.251 --> 00:02:29.771
but I kept on running,

00:02:29.771 --> 00:02:34.749
I would force myself off the sofa
put on my kit and head out.

00:02:34.749 --> 00:02:39.013
The first steps were always awful,
everything hurt, I could hardly breathe

00:02:39.013 --> 00:02:43.995
but then the endorphins would kick in
and it felt like it always did, only better!

00:02:43.995 --> 00:02:46.773
My body could still do 
what it was meant to do,

00:02:46.773 --> 00:02:50.511
I was moving,
I felt alive!

00:02:50.511 --> 00:02:53.500
A few days before Christmas,
I finished treatment

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.500
and I got the news 
that I was in remission.

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.902
It should've been great, right?
And of course it was,

00:02:59.902 --> 00:03:03.255
but physically and emotionally
I was a wreck.

00:03:03.255 --> 00:03:05.766
But I knew the strength
that running gave me

00:03:05.766 --> 00:03:07.927
so I made the decision
that I was going to run

00:03:07.927 --> 00:03:10.088
Berlin marathon in a few months time.

00:03:10.088 --> 00:03:12.250
Total madness.

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:16.505
You bet I came to regret that decision 
a million times in the next months,

00:03:16.505 --> 00:03:19.505
but I started training seriously again.

00:03:19.505 --> 00:03:21.515
It was torture in the beginning

00:03:21.515 --> 00:03:24.744
but gradually I could run
longer and faster.

00:03:24.744 --> 00:03:29.232
And as my legs got stronger
running began to work its magic.

00:03:29.232 --> 00:03:31.744
I started to believe in myself again,

00:03:31.744 --> 00:03:37.024
to see myself as a strong capable person
and not as a cancer patient.

00:03:37.024 --> 00:03:39.761
Nine months after finishing treatment,

00:03:39.761 --> 00:03:43.748
I crossed the finishing line
of Berlin marathon.

00:03:43.748 --> 00:03:48.056
A year on and my life is back on track,
I'm living my dream,

00:03:48.056 --> 00:03:51.033
and I believe that
if I hadn't kept on running,

00:03:51.033 --> 00:03:53.263
while the cancel would still
have been cured

00:03:53.263 --> 00:03:56.887
I would never have
fully regained my strength.

00:03:56.887 --> 00:03:58.703
My message isn't about cancer

00:03:58.703 --> 00:04:01.239
and this is not specifically
about running either.

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:06.057
It doesn't matter how we move our bodies,
the important thing is that we do move them,

00:04:06.057 --> 00:04:07.859
not just for our physical fitness

00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:12.502
but to keep our minds and feelings
strong and healthy too.

00:04:12.502 --> 00:04:15.960
What I learned is that no matter 
what life throws at us,

00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:18.762
no matter how overwhelming it may seem,

00:04:18.762 --> 00:04:24.226
physical activity is absolutely indispensable
for our overall well-being.

00:04:24.226 --> 00:04:28.535
As Winston Churchill once said, 
"If you're going through hell, keep going."

00:04:28.535 --> 00:04:31.251
I did and so can you.
(Laughter)

00:04:31.251 --> 00:04:32.249
Thank you.

00:04:32.249 --> 00:04:38.249
(Applause)
