-[TipsyBartender] Action!

00:00:01.601 --> 00:00:02.719
- Today we are making a drink

00:00:02.719 --> 00:00:04.871
based on Disney's Sleeping Beauty.

00:00:04.966 --> 00:00:08.462
- And the drink is called
the Sleep Cycle, yay.

00:00:08.462 --> 00:00:09.499
- Woo.

00:00:09.499 --> 00:00:10.937
(laughing)

00:00:10.937 --> 00:00:13.408
-[TipsyBartender] Hpnotiq, pour.

00:00:13.491 --> 00:00:15.266
That's right Cecilia,
way to take the lead.

00:00:15.266 --> 00:00:17.772
I'll tell you when to
stop, keep going, stop.

00:00:18.172 --> 00:00:19.060
Okay.

00:00:20.094 --> 00:00:21.777
Jessica, pour.

00:00:22.028 --> 00:00:23.564
- Oh she's not pouring mine too?

00:00:23.564 --> 00:00:25.765
-[TipsyBartender] No way you lazy bastard.

00:00:29.672 --> 00:00:32.244
Shake it and keep it sexy, go ahead Jess.

00:00:34.269 --> 00:00:35.623
More please, more.

00:00:35.623 --> 00:00:38.022
There's two girls, okay, impress me.

00:00:42.455 --> 00:00:43.224
Pour!

00:00:47.743 --> 00:00:49.193
This is Kinky.

00:00:49.193 --> 00:00:50.941
Pour and I'll tell you when to stop.

00:00:51.028 --> 00:00:53.017
Would one of you all go first, jesus.

00:00:53.017 --> 00:00:53.974
Pour!

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:55.144
- Pour!

00:00:56.343 --> 00:00:58.095
-[TipsyBartender] Nice,
keep going, keep going.

00:00:58.964 --> 00:01:01.281
Yeah, let it fall down the
glass, okay, right there stop.

00:01:02.439 --> 00:01:03.381
Splash of Sprite.

00:01:05.009 --> 00:01:07.678
Vodka, that's a splash.

00:01:09.476 --> 00:01:11.297
Okay, Jessica.

00:01:12.438 --> 00:01:15.818
Why you're putting in vodka,
go ahead just a splash,

00:01:15.818 --> 00:01:17.346
cause this recipe doesn't
really call for it.

00:01:17.346 --> 00:01:18.558
A little bit more than that.

00:01:18.558 --> 00:01:21.091
Because I try to break up the
density on this to make sure

00:01:21.091 --> 00:01:23.010
this floats on top of that.

00:01:27.075 --> 00:01:28.645
Ok stop that's it.

00:01:29.251 --> 00:01:31.777
(laughing)

00:01:33.635 --> 00:01:35.146
- That didn't work at all.

00:01:46.082 --> 00:01:46.905
-[TipsyBartender] There we go.

00:01:46.905 --> 00:01:47.776
- Boom.

00:01:47.776 --> 00:01:52.776
- Ladies, this fascinating
drink was created by my boy,

00:01:53.048 --> 00:01:55.253
Cocktails By Cody, from up in Seattle.

00:01:55.253 --> 00:01:56.503
We've been talking and you know

00:01:56.503 --> 00:01:58.103
he came up with this little recipe here.

00:01:58.103 --> 00:01:59.339
It's real sexy.

00:01:59.498 --> 00:02:01.122
And there you have it,

00:02:01.641 --> 00:02:03.254
The Sleep Cycle.

00:02:03.254 --> 00:02:05.557
Okay, go ahead, take a sip.

00:02:05.557 --> 00:02:06.981
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

00:02:07.191 --> 00:02:09.323
- Don't break them glasses I only got two.

00:02:11.963 --> 00:02:13.134
- Yum

00:02:13.134 --> 00:02:13.840
- You like it?

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.040
- Yeah, it's good.

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.537
- Smooth, it's got girly
written all over it.

00:02:16.537 --> 00:02:17.487
It's good stuff.

00:02:17.487 --> 00:02:18.359
And it's pretty as hell.

00:02:18.359 --> 00:02:19.844
You serve this at a party and everyone,

00:02:19.844 --> 00:02:21.198
"Oh can we have one of those?"

00:02:21.198 --> 00:02:23.193
Okay, ladies and gentleman,
are you ready for this?

00:02:23.193 --> 00:02:25.344
The real story of Sleeping Beauty.

00:02:25.344 --> 00:02:26.560
Go ahead.

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:29.212
- Really like the--
- Go ahead.

00:02:29.212 --> 00:02:30.149
- Disney one or the--
- Break it out,

00:02:30.149 --> 00:02:32.200
go ahead, tell them what happened.

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.105
- Okay, so, the original
Sleeping Beauty story,

00:02:36.105 --> 00:02:37.667
when she's sleeping in the tower,

00:02:37.667 --> 00:02:42.532
a king comes by on a horse and
goes in and has sex with her

00:02:42.532 --> 00:02:45.187
while she's sleeping and she
gets pregnant with twins.

00:02:45.187 --> 00:02:49.102
And then she like wakes
up and has to marry him.

00:02:49.711 --> 00:02:51.976
- So my boy took this without permission?

00:02:52.114 --> 00:02:53.214
- Well done.

00:02:53.716 --> 00:02:56.027
- And Disney pulled a kiss from this.

00:02:56.027 --> 00:02:57.830
- Disney made it beautiful.

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:00.684
- The blue and the pink explain
the significance of that.

00:03:00.684 --> 00:03:03.356
- Okay, so the fairies
are fighting over which

00:03:03.356 --> 00:03:06.602
color dress she should
have and they're like,

00:03:06.602 --> 00:03:07.861
"Oh it should be blue, it should be pink."

00:03:07.861 --> 00:03:10.167
And so they're like making
her dress blue and pink

00:03:10.167 --> 00:03:11.432
while she's dancing with the prince.

00:03:11.432 --> 00:03:12.580
- I remember that.

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:14.601
- Was it beautiful, Jessica?

00:03:14.601 --> 00:03:16.475
- Yeah, it was beautiful.

00:03:16.475 --> 00:03:18.564
I personally like Gus Gus
cause he reminds me of myself.

00:03:18.564 --> 00:03:20.098
(laughing)

00:03:20.098 --> 00:03:21.657
He wears these really short t-shirts

00:03:21.657 --> 00:03:23.097
and his gut just hangs out.

00:03:23.097 --> 00:03:25.478
He's a really cute rat, I like him.

00:03:25.478 --> 00:03:28.244
- Tipsy Bartender, Tipsy Bartender, okay.

00:03:29.058 --> 00:03:31.464
- I would be like my
favorite is Cinderella.

00:03:31.464 --> 00:03:32.923
My favorite's Gus Gus.

00:03:32.923 --> 00:03:34.212
(laughing)

00:03:34.406 --> 00:03:36.308
- We have a lot of melting going on.

00:03:36.308 --> 00:03:38.410
Just because we've been
doing so much back and forth.

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:40.461
So, please audience excuse that.

00:03:40.678 --> 00:03:42.004
And there you have it!

00:03:42.199 --> 00:03:43.628
Siren's Song.

00:03:43.628 --> 00:03:46.003
♫ Under the sea,

00:03:46.003 --> 00:03:48.567
Life is so-- ♫
- ♫ Under the-- ♫ No!

00:03:48.567 --> 00:03:50.388
- You're sure that ain't the words?
