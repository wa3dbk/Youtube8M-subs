00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:06.500
Hi guys, this is Road to Brazil.

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:10.500
The show where we´ll meet the 32 teams that
will participate at the next World Cup.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.600
Today we´ll talk about Belgium

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:18.000
That small country in northern Europe who´s
flag we always mistake for the German one...

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:21.000
if we are looking at it sideways off course

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.500
Ok.
When we think about Belgium, probably the

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.900
first thing that comes to minds is...

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.400
The land where the smurfs are from.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.000
Ok,
maybe that's not the first thing we think about.

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:32.500
But it's true!

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:37.800
But when we think about Belgium we think of chocolates, waffles, and Brussels sprouts

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
But starting in 2014, we must think of Belgium,

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:44.000
as the possible surprise of the world cup.

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:49.000
Belgium arrives at Brazil having won their
qualifying group.

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:54.000
Not just that. Having won 8 out of 10 matches,
and drawing 2.

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:55.400
So, undefeated!

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.500
The captain of this team is Vincent Kompany.

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:04.900
The lost brother of Frankenstein is the captain
of our dear engineer at Manchester City.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.500
And despite being a defender, he has scored
19 goals in his career.

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.000
Attention Pepe Rojas, Claudio Bravo,

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.000
because the star of this team is probably
Eden Hazard.

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.020
What is so cool about Hazard?
Apart from putting up with Mourinho at Chelsea?

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:20.500
No biggie

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.300
He only has been compared to Lionel Messi
and Cristiano Ronaldo

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:30.600
He is 23 years old, quick, fast paced, dribbler...

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:31.700
He is like our Alexis!!!

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.800
And watch out with the goal scoring power.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.900
In 10 qualifying matches they scored 17 goals.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.900
And the 10 different players got on the scoring
sheet.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.200
So beware

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:46.800
Even Carucha Fernandez would score playing
for Belgium

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.800
And when would we meet?

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.800
If Chile is part of the group of Death...

00:01:52.900 --> 00:02:02.000
Belgium is in the group of Bored to death,
with Russia, Korea, and Algeria.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.900
And as Chile is in group B,

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.000
assuming we both make it through we could
meet as early as the semifinals.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.700
But before that we have to make it through
Spain, Netherlands...

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.100
Brazil or Mexico...

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.200
and possibly Italy or Uruguay.

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.200
So let's take it step by step.

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:23.000
We trust that Sampaoli will put all this info
in his mini computer.

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.400
And Chile will make it to the final!

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:27.700
Ok. That's it.

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:32.469
I´ll see you at another time, with another
team we´ll see at Brazil 2014
