00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:17.770
it's regarding a pennsylvania high school
teacher her name is natalie monroe

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:23.800
and she has recently i've gotten suspended
with pay because she had published a blot

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:27.419
on the internet where she at trashed her students

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:28.859
all right so

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:30.789
not a smart idea outright

00:00:30.789 --> 00:00:35.030
on and i thought maybe she said some things
that were critical of the students but nothing

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:35.719
too bad

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:38.390
and then you really read into what she posted

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:43.100
and she is by far that dumbest high school
teacher ever i don't know what she was thinking

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.330
so i'm gonna read you a couple of things that
she wrote

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:50.840
uh... wished for some of the students n she
specifies who the students are so she identifies

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:51.480
them

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.390
she uh... describes them as frightfully den

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:56.890
rat like

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:00.370
concerns your kid is going to open fire on
the school

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:03.140
seems so rider and she actually is

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.910
uh... she also says things like i'd hear the
trash company is hiring

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:11.610
you know so basically she's saying that as
soon as a smart enough to succeed in life

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.710
so back here she should

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.950
look for a job with the trash company

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:20.350
uh... i called out sick a couple of days just
to avoid your son

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:25.119
as she described another soon as rude belligerent
argumentative buck

00:01:25.119 --> 00:01:30.030
icicles on to say that a student is just as
bad as his sibling don't you know how to raise

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:35.680
kids and he says all of these terrible things
about specific students on a blog on a public

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:39.210
forum

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:43.090
no one got sometimes she was stupid enough
to do something like that because she has

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:47.370
no reason to be in the school system so get
her out

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:50.280
well there's a couple things here in

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.900
students ulcer over the top

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:57.409
bunny cataract missus of what i think is gonna
come may be opened fire on the school yet

00:01:57.409 --> 00:02:01.430
you can call them are at or korea doing things
like that in it

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:05.729
at at outing in basically bullying these kids
in a public forum

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.150
it's madness but

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:11.339
the point that i needed the most is way she
admitted this kid things

00:02:11.339 --> 00:02:13.040
her work

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:14.859
because she didn't want to deal with the kid

00:02:14.859 --> 00:02:19.459
i mean battle opens a fire that's so what
you pretended to tend to be sicker whatever

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:24.159
it is she's playing on the school which is
a teacher right of this is outside on the

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:29.259
disaster immediate dismissal eventually you're
gonna have a computer disaster your computer's
