00:00:01.576 --> 00:00:04.991
N: Aquaculture is a small but growing industry in Indiana.

00:00:04.991 --> 00:00:10.162
N: There are three types of aquaculture farms: fish and shell fish for food,

00:00:10.162 --> 00:00:16.910
ornamental fish for aquariums and recreational fish for stocking ponds and rivers.

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:21.296
N: Tippco Fish Incorporated raises fish for food.

00:00:21.296 --> 00:00:28.829
S: I raise Talipia for the food fish market. I produce about 125,000 pounds of fish a year.

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:36.714
S: Most of my fish go out live. They'll go to a market, usually in a china town in an Asian area.

00:00:36.714 --> 00:00:43.494
S: Talipia is a very easy fish to raise. It can handle a wide variety of water quality.

00:00:43.494 --> 00:00:53.827
S: It can stand to be in a very populated system, as long as you keep them warm they're pretty much happy and easy to grow.

00:00:53.827 --> 00:00:58.744
S: The biggest difficulty starting out were getting through the county permitting process.

00:00:58.744 --> 00:01:08.327
S: Aquaculture is a new thing. It's also a lot of permitting that we're exempt from being an aquaculture operation,

00:01:08.327 --> 00:01:16.942
but it did take a lot of working through the system to prove that we were exempt from those permits.

00:01:16.942 --> 00:01:22.894
S: On top of that, of course, getting financing was hard because it's a different industry

00:01:22.894 --> 00:01:29.919
so it is hard to justify your numbers and your production projections to the bank.

00:01:29.919 --> 00:01:34.796
N: Unlike Tippco Andry's Fish Farm produces fish for pond stocking.

00:01:34.796 --> 00:01:42.608
A: There's been a need and growing interest in recreational ponds for people to fish at home.

00:01:42.608 --> 00:01:49.249
A: We raise a little bit of everything for pond stocking, Blue Gill, Bass, Catfish, Red-ear.

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:54.664
A: We usually sell between $800,000- 1.2 million in Blue Gill and Hybred Blue Gill per year.

00:01:54.664 --> 00:01:57.348
A: That's our largest selling fish here on the farm.

00:01:57.348 --> 00:02:02.299
A: We have about 80 ponds. Approximately 80 acres of water.

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:08.893
A: The farms in the southern part of the United States may range anywhere from 1,000-2,000 acres of water,

00:02:08.893 --> 00:02:12.826
so we are just considered large here in the state of Indiana.

00:02:12.826 --> 00:02:15.368
A: There's quite a bit that goes into the raising of fish.

00:02:15.368 --> 00:02:19.977
A: We have to monitor our oxygen and PH levels fairly constant.

00:02:19.977 --> 00:02:25.351
A: We want to make sure that there's not a big fluctuation of either one of those.

00:02:25.351 --> 00:02:32.244
A: Aquaculture is difinitely a growing industry. Ten years ago there were very few farms in the state of Indiana.

00:02:32.244 --> 00:02:38.578
A: There may have been 10 farms. Now there's approximately 40 -50 farms raising fish in Indiana.

00:02:38.578 --> 99:59:59.999
