00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.629
hey internet so it's Christmas yeah /
other religious holiday / particularly

00:00:06.629 --> 00:00:09.660
non-religious atheists hoe down now
while the festive season may  remind

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.769
you of family and food and love and all
that crap it is actually one of the most

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:15.540
accident-prone times of the year

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:19.020
now I like to think that i'm not that
clumsy but to be honest any attempts

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.350
whatsoever of holding onto any dignity in
front of you guys probably died a long

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:25.710
time ago and to be honest I should just
stop trying to defend myself and

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:28.650
tweeting every time I do something
stupid but I found this article the

00:00:28.650 --> 00:00:32.219
other day talking about Christmas
disasters and whilst I admit I am prone to

00:00:32.219 --> 00:00:35.670
you know casually falling out chairs every now and then i am not this bad

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:36.210
right

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.750
listen to this did you know for example
that over a hundred people every year are

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.000
hospitalized from trying to move a
Christmas tree naked

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:49.500
10 people have to have toys surgically removed from their feet after accidentally stepping on them

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:50.460
ah!

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.379
and at least two people every year are
killed by trying to water a Christmas

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:57.540
tree with fairy lights on

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.500
now i'm guessing we're not all that
stupid but mainly to make myself feel

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.840
better i asked you guys if you've had
any Christmas accidents yourself and

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:07.880
this is what you said

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.800
Wow well I think we can conclude that
therefore christmas is freaking deadly

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.159
and it is gonna go down

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:20.700
whether you're ready or not but by far
one of the most common and real dangers

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:23.130
of the christmas season is choking on
food

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:27.540
don't laugh ok picture it there you are
Christmas Day with your Christmas Chums

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.080
gayly enjoying each other's company so
much that you get a bit too excited

00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:35.070
cheing a mouthful of food and bam you
start choking on something

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.680
now do you actually know what to do in
this situation because I mean you might

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.770
but i imagine that for most of us it
would probably go down like this

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:47.380
P: what what do we do?
PJ: Panic! Everyone panic!
*everyone panics*

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:50.660
and I'm sure that if we wanted to help
we probably wouldn't actually be that

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:51.210
useful

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:52.860
what do you think alternate reality dan

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.780
D: water he needs water

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:02.260
PJ: more water

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:08.940
D: i don't know, i tried

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:11.060
well that was a disaster what about you?

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:12.900
P: I know, why don't we try scaring him?

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:13.840
PJ: yes

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:21.840
P: oops

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:26.060
great ok I don't think I want to
know what his plan is

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:30.040
PJ: oh I know,  why don't we pretend to choke to make him feel better

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:42.140
Everyone: uh

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:44.819
so in other words most of us would 
probably totally useless in that

00:02:44.819 --> 00:02:48.299
situation and to be honest until last
week I had no idea what to do myself

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:50.969
so on the basis that this will actually
be new to quite a lot of you and as well

00:02:50.969 --> 00:02:54.030
as making me look a bit less clumsy this
could potentially actually save some

00:02:54.030 --> 00:02:54.840
lives

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.150
I looked it up and what you are
supposed to do in the event that someone

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.560
starts to choke is hit them, no really

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:04.880
Alternate Dan: stand back people
Real Dan: after bending them

00:03:04.889 --> 00:03:07.889
Real Dan: slightly forward you raise your hand
with your fingers held tightly together

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:14.639
Real Dan: yeah that's right no no no Dan a
bit higher than that

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:19.680
Real Dan: yes well that's not going to help is it
a bit harder

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:23.520
Real Dan: no no that's too hard

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:26.900
Real Dan: all right stop *bleep* about

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.180
ok all joking aside this is what you are actually

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:32.900
supposed to do in the event that someone
starts to choke you hit them firmly

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.200
between the shoulder blades

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:44.240
oh god, what is that

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:49.680
C: well OWL be damned

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:52.460
C: *laughs* Merry Christmas everybody

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:58.760
*talking and laughing*

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:13.380
Everyone: oh oh Chris! Chris! Chris! 
C: ahh!
*laughing* you silly lad

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:18.380
so there we go that is how to be awesome the closest
I've ever been to choking was once i was

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:21.620
trying to see how many dough balls I
could fit in my mouth at the same time

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:24.740
for some reason and I was leaning on my
hand when I slipped and crammed about

00:04:24.740 --> 00:04:29.270
five into my mouth at the same time when
I just so happen to sneeze and then that

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:30.260
dislodged them

00:04:30.260 --> 00:04:34.340
i know im so attractive aren't i, and whilst i'm here losing all respect for myself I

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:37.400
might as well tell you about the time
when i broke my dad's TV by bending over

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:41.270
to pick up a bauble and knocking it off
the TV stand with my butt

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:45.890
yeah that actually happened and went about
as well as you think it could have, oh and

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:48.950
then there's the time when I was eating
Christmas dinner and I got attacked by a

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:52.910
moth and in my attempt to swat it away i
knocked over a candle and set fire to

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:53.960
the tablecloth

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:57.800
I should be locked up  I am in danger
to society but as well as this video

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:01.340
hopefully helping some people I want us
guys to get together for the festive

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:01.910
