00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:06.300
My phone is so smart she chooses her own ring
tone.

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:09.050
The only problem is I have to pay for it.

00:00:09.050 --> 00:00:13.209
I wouldn't mind if she told me what it was,
but she doesn't.

00:00:13.209 --> 00:00:18.020
Only last week I was sitting on the train
when suddenly Girls Just Want to Have Fun

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:20.710
started playing inside my trouser pocket.

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:27.010
Of course I pretended it wasn't my phone,
but my left testicle knew otherwise.

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:35.500
But what the hell was I supposed to do, answer
the bloody thing or just start dancing?

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.810
And she gets jealous if I even look at another
phone.

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:46.610
Just the other night I picked up some girl's
iPhone by mistake and two minutes later my

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:48.680
phone died completely.

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:51.480
You can't tell me that's just a coincidence.

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:55.960
And later that day when I asked her to tell
me what the temperature was in Helsinki to

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:59.590
see if she still had the shits with me, she
just said..."

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:07.040
I'm sorry could you say that again.." as if
she didn't understand my Aussie accent and

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:13.360
And if I turn on silent because I'm having
a very important business meeting with my

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:19.830
ex girlfriend to discuss why sleeping with
her best friend is a crime against humanity

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:25.110
she feels like I'm ignoring her and I get
absolutely crap reception for the rest of

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:26.400
the day.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:29.560
What's that all about?

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:34.140
You see I don't talk on my smartphone I talk
to her.

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.650
It's that kind of relationship.

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:42.550
You'd probably call it serious if you were
a psychologist or telecommunications expert.

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:45.560
I prefer to think of it as close.

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:52.060
I mean if she had long sexy legs, looked hot
in a bikini and was able to suck a golf ball

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:58.980
through a garden hose I'd probably introduce
her to my mother.

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:03.790
But let me tell you right now, you can't tell
a smartphone what to do.

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:10.989
You can ask politely, but a smartphone does
what it wants, just like a woman.

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:16.781
So my advice is very simple; the next time
you are looking for a new smart phone ask

00:02:16.781 --> 00:02:22.780
yourself these three very simple questions;
are you looking for a serious relationship?

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:26.700
Do you promise to stop looking at other phones?

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:33.560
And most importantly, do you take this phone
to have and to hold, to love and to cherish

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.460
for the rest of your life?

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:44.459
After that, all you need to say is I do, I
do, I do.
