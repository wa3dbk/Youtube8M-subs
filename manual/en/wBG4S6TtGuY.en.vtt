Hello, my name is Luis Estrada and I'm a software
developer. In this clip, I'll show you how

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:15.349
to earn money on eHow. eHow is a website that
allows you to publish your own articles for

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:21.560
free on the web. All registered users can
upload articles. Those articles can be included

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:26.990
into the writer's compensation program. That
way you'll earn money from your writing. Earnings

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:32.029
are based on article performance. So, if you
write a great article that spreads across

00:00:32.029 --> 00:00:37.379
the internet like a virus, you could find
yourself making some extra dollars from eHow

00:00:37.379 --> 00:00:43.111
once a month. Payments are made through Paypal.
First you need to sign up for eHow's writers

00:00:43.111 --> 00:00:49.300
compensation program. It's fast and easy.
All you need is an active Paypal account and

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:54.040
an eHow profile. Once you have created an
account you can start writing your articles.

00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:59.320
I'll give you a few tips that will help you
maximize your profits. Carefully choose the

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:05.430
topic of your article. Try to target a mass
audience. Create articles that do not expire

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:11.940
quickly. For example, if you create an article
talking about the past Olympics games, chances

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:18.000
are that most people have lost interest about
it in just a few months. The ideal article

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.480
has from four-hundred to six-hundreds words.
If you're creating a how to article, make

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:28.090
sure you are separating the instructions in
easy to follow steps. You should include a

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:33.250
small introduction and a separate section
for tips and warnings. Have you heard of the

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:38.450
expression "a picture's worth a thousand words"?
Including images will make your articles more

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:45.140
interesting and your how to tutorials easier
to understand. Promote your articles. Send

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:50.710
links to the articles to your family and friends
and ask them to forward them to their contacts.

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:56.200
Add links to your articles in their blogs.
Personal websites, social networks, forums,

00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:03.350
etcetera. You are paid per each page viewed,
but the website keeps track of the IP addresses

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:09.170
that have accessed the page. Meaning that
if you or your friends constantly access the

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:14.390
article to increase the page views, all of
the visits from the same IP would still count

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:23.530
as one. I am Luis Estrada, and I've just showed
you how to make money with mere websites.
