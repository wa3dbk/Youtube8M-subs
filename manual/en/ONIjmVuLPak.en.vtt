00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:06.590
I often get asked, well, how long will Opportunity
last?

00:00:06.590 --> 00:00:08.090
And, you know, I can't say.

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:10.180
And, you know, I don't think anyone knows.

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:14.591
You know, 8 years ago we were scratching our
heads and said, well, maybe 6 months if we're

00:00:14.591 --> 00:00:15.591
really lucky.

00:00:15.591 --> 00:00:18.840
But here we're 8 years later and the rover
is still in very good health.

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:21.190
And now we're at Endeavour Crater.

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:24.410
We're seeing new geology, older geology.

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:27.960
It's a whole new window on the history of
Mars.

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:32.800
It's the earliest period of Mars in which
there was water -- sustained liquid water

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:33.800
-- on the surface.

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.030
It was in that era that life started on the
Earth.

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.380
So that's when we think Mars was the most
Earthlike.

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:44.020
And we've already seen evidence of that era
reflected in some of the minerals that we've

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:46.570
discovered at this new location.

00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:47.860
We've assessed them to be gypsum.

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:51.710
And that's significant because these are minerals
that form in water.

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:53.300
And they form in place.

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:59.020
Perhaps groundwater came up and filled cracks
and fractures in the geology that formed these

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:01.969
veins of light-toned material.

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:05.280
That's the great advantage that you have with
a rover that can travel and move.

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.560
It's not the same stuff.

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:12.039
It's new stuff every day.

00:01:12.039 --> 00:01:15.600
Right now Opportunity's going through her
5th Martian winter.

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.869
And this one's a little more challenging than
the previous winters, because dust continues

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:24.640
to accumulate on the solar arrays, which has
reduced the power levels we can produce.

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:31.549
We had to take the rover and drive it up onto
a ridge that gives us about a 15-degree tilt

00:01:31.549 --> 00:01:32.549
towards the north.

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.119
That's where the sun will be in the wintertime
because we're in the southern hemisphere.

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:43.189
It's kind of like adjusting your deck chair
to maximize your suntan.

00:01:43.189 --> 00:01:48.289
In a very unusual way, this roving vehicle,
when it's stationary, allows us to probe the

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:50.359
interior of Mars.

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:53.969
Its radio signal now becomes a proxy for the
rotational rate of Mars.

00:01:53.969 --> 00:01:58.200
And so we're going to measure the rotational
rate of Mars very precisely, which will give

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.849
us a handle on the physical interior of the
planet: its distribution of material inside,

00:02:03.849 --> 00:02:09.429
the size of the core, maybe the fluid state
of the core.

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:13.290
Right now, Opportunity is alone on the surface
of Mars.

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:18.889
We had to say goodbye to Spirit after over
6 years of successful operation of that rover.

00:02:18.889 --> 00:02:23.469
But soon Opportunity will have company, and
that'll be Curiosity, the next rover.

00:02:23.469 --> 00:02:28.930
Now, Curiosity will land a quarter of the
way around the planet from Opportunity, so

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:31.409
there's no chance of them meeting up.

00:02:31.409 --> 00:02:43.000
But it's nice that we are continuing the multivehicle
exploration of the surface.
