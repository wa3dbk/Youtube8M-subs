00:00:07.986 --> 00:00:10.740
Kia know very well how to build SUV's and compact cars.

00:00:11.308 --> 00:00:14.859
But the middle class wasn't their cup of tea.

00:00:15.332 --> 00:00:21.004
Just look at the Magentis. Few people in Europe liked that design.

00:00:21.004 --> 00:00:27.573
This new Optima though is specally designed to please Europeans. 

00:00:27.573 --> 00:00:32.092
That's why we even dare to compare it with the popular VW Passat. 

00:00:35.925 --> 00:00:45.159
Very popular. I used to be an account manager, and guess what car I drove...

00:00:45.159 --> 00:00:49.678
If I still was an account manager today, I'd probably be driving this car. 

00:00:50.071 --> 00:00:52.491
Like it or not, this is the benchmark. 

00:00:52.491 --> 00:00:56.101
A perfect car for the first time at your new girl's parents. 

00:00:56.163 --> 00:00:58.323
They'll like you. But she won't.

00:01:04.813 --> 00:01:12.498
The Optima looks great, from the outside and the inside. 

00:01:12.498 --> 00:01:20.538
The wooden panels and shiny rings around the clocks are a bit too much.

00:01:20.538 --> 00:01:29.938
It is loaded: lane departure warning, parking assistance, reverse camera, it all comes standard.

00:01:29.938 --> 00:01:33.385
Very good.

00:01:39.266 --> 00:01:45.980
The Passat is not as loaded, the finishing and materials are better though. 

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:53.292
It looks more quiet. And classy, with aluminium and that clock. 

00:01:53.426 --> 00:01:57.213
It reminds me a bit of a Phaeton. 

00:02:04.138 --> 00:02:10.349
But this is great, too. In the front and the trunk it is a bit smaller than the Passat. 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:18.269
But in the back, it gets close to the Superb. Loads of legspace thanks to a wheelbase of 2.8 meters.

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:22.165
Only the Ford Modeo has a longer wheelbase. 

00:02:22.165 --> 00:02:28.803
At the moment, there is only a 1.7-liter diesel engine. 

00:02:28.803 --> 00:02:33.580
Later this year, there will be a hybrid version. 

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:45.473
This engine has 136 HP. Not too much, but you get around just fine. 

00:02:59.242 --> 00:03:01.733
The suspension is comfortable, but not too soft. 

00:03:01.733 --> 00:03:09.381
Sometimes even a bit bumpy. Also because of the standard 18 inch wheels. 

00:03:09.381 --> 00:03:15.341
It is quite understeered, but it hardly hangs in the curves. 

00:03:17.094 --> 00:03:22.885
The steering is like most korean cars: not very sharp, especially in the center position. 

00:03:22.885 --> 00:03:30.335
But alltogether, this car feels more european than any middle sized Kia ever did. 

00:03:31.373 --> 00:03:36.374
Don't tell Maurice, but I really love the looks of his Optima. 

00:03:36.374 --> 00:03:44.301
But what a ridiculous name: Optima. 

00:03:44.301 --> 00:03:50.901
The Passat steers better than the Optima, with more feeling and resistance. 

00:03:50.901 --> 00:03:57.331
The suspension is in fine balance. Not sporty, mostly comfortable but not too much. 

00:03:57.331 --> 00:04:00.867
Just like the looks: a car for the mass. 

00:04:01.291 --> 00:04:06.058
The 140 HP TDI is not a racing engine, but it's good enough. 

00:04:21.922 --> 00:04:26.272
For the first time, Kia has a serious competitor in the middle class business. 

00:04:26.272 --> 00:04:30.409
Finally a car for us Europeans to like. 

00:04:30.409 --> 00:04:34.185
That goes for the looks and the drive. 

00:04:34.185 --> 00:04:39.434
And don't forget the equipment and space. 

00:04:39.434 --> 00:04:43.688
This Optima does not remind to the old Kia. 

00:04:43.688 --> 00:04:46.969
But it still can't beat the Passat. 

00:04:46.969 --> 00:04:51.466
The Passat has slightly better finishing and powertrain. 

00:04:51.466 --> 00:04:55.250
The steering is better, the suspension better balanced. 

00:04:55.250 --> 00:05:01.882
And VW offers a wide range of engines, unlike Kia so far. 

00:05:01.882 --> 00:05:15.026
True, but there will be a hybrid later. And the pricing of the Kia is very good.
