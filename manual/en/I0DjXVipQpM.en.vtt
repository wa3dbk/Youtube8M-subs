00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:04.920
What you cannot change, you have to accept.

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.080
And  how could we change that, Mama's fate?

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:10.600
We just cannot.

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.360
Bye, Ursula.

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:16.160
Sleep well, bye bye.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:20.720
Mama's got Multiple Sclerosis (MS),

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:22.880
as long as I can remember.

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:26.560
She hasn't been able to speak for many years.

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.960
How do other people cope with it?

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.480
Hoping to get to know more,

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:34.880
I start my journey.

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.320
Multiple Fates

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:42.160
About the struggle with one's own body.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Aha, first I have to start it.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.760
Otherwise nothing will work!

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:57.800
The more I did, the more I started limping.

00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:02.000
With my left hand, I can still move,

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.400
relatively fast…

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:07.160
If I do that with my right…

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.000
this is the maximum.

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.840
I mean, I am just 21 now and I would also

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.480
like to have a friend, and a bit of closeness and so on…

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.100
But I assume that this is something I'll never have.

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.200
But into a nursing home, to an unfamiliar place

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.720
lying in an unknown bed, determined by others…

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:29.880
I won't do that.

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:31.600
I have changed a lot:

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.300
I will not let myself rush.

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.900
That I don't feel any pain, absolutely nothing.

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.000
And then I think that's spooky, really. No pain.

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:44.080
And somehow, I also am a person that likes moving.

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:46.720
There should always be something going on.

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:52.120
I don't want to suffocate, or to be killed by flames,

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:54.300
I have always said.

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:58.300
And if not, at this moment, a plane crashes onto this house,

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:00.880
then I have achieved my goal.
