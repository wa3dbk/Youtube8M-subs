00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:06.400
What's up man? It's so good to see you.

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:10.010
Hey Buddy. &gt; I know I saw you this morning but it seems like it's been forever.

00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:12.449
We gotta celebrate. What do you want to do?

00:00:12.449 --> 00:00:19.449
Let's go throw this puppy around. Go outside and get some fresh air?  &gt;I'll put my stuff down alright? &gt;Alright.

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:56.270
Hey man, what are you doing? Are you cooking?  Do you need any help? I can help.

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:57.340
Nah, I'm good.  Actually, where's the basil?

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:04.340
Bottom drawer.

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:09.760
What is this?

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:12.830
I am so sorry.

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:15.480
I don't even deserve to be here.

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:22.480
I'll just go get paper towels and clean it up and leave.

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:35.660
What?

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:40.909
We're out of cereal.

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:42.920
You're friend's weird.  

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.280
Yeah, I don't think he likes you.

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:52.570
He doesn't really like anyone.

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:58.450
&lt;moaning&gt; What's up with you?

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:05.450
Jimmy! No!

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:12.400
Hey, don't worry.  

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.370
I got this.

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.860
That's a good boy!
