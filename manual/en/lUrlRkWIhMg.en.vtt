Hello everyone, it's Yoon Charmi

00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:07.120
Graduation season is coming up!

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:13.680
Today's makeup is sophisticated and yet lovely,
perfect for Graduation!

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:18.440
Then let's get started!

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.960
Start off with however you like to do your base makeup!

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:24.780
I'll first draw my brows

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:30.580
If you make it too low, you may seem miserable
and if you make it too high, you may seem too strong

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:35.760
so make it just slightly upwards than usual,
to look smart

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:41.100
Finish off by combing through the hairs

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:46.920
Next, I'll apply a bright shimmery shadow
on the brow bone

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.820
Starting from the center and outwards, I blended it nicely with a finger so that it doesn't leave any harsh edges

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:59.880
To show off that feminine look, I used a bit of coral

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.500
I think it'd also be gorgeous applied strongly

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.780
Blend it nicely

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:12.940
I'll apply a shimmery eyeshadow on the bottom
from the inner corners and naturally outwards

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:22.360
Now using a brown eyeliner, I'll line my eyes

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:26.220
I'll also tightline using this

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.080
We'll be smudging it so it's okay to be rough

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:34.540
I'll also apply it on the lower lash line
for a more defined look

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:40.180
I'll smudge out the eyeliner using a brown eyeshadow

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:49.320
This way my eyes look more voluminous
than just having the eyeliner alone

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:54.260
Same for the bottom, smudge it out

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:09.340
Next, I'll use a black eyeliner close to the lash line
to pretend as if my eyes are originally black and defined

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:14.760
I drew it thin to look sophisticated for the graduation

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:19.420
I'm really into smudging lately

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:29.420
Using a sturdy brush to smudge
can even make newbies draw well

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:34.640
so I think it's convenient,
definitely needed for important events like today

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.980
Now I'll tightly curl my lashes

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:50.880
For that natural, voluminous look, I'll apply it slightly above the roots in zigzag and straight motions

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:56.780
For tips on dolly lashes,
please watch my Tips on Mascara video

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.560
You'll be taking lots of pictures on your Graduation day

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:04.100
I'll contour enough to be pretty on pictures
and also natural seen in  real person

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:07.040
Also go over the face line

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:16.940
Now using a highlighter,
let's give dimension and highlight at the same time

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:25.940
Go over high areas like the chin, Cupid's Bow, nose bridge, forehead, and also on the cheekbones

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:30.460
I'll just give a slight flush on my cheeks
using a blush I hit pan with

00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:36.660
This lipstick looks gorgeous in real person

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:41.660
Starting from the center, I'll let it naturally blend out

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:46.580
And then go over the center once more
for more pigmentation, and it's finished!

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:54.080
Yoon Charmi's Graduation Makeup is complete!
