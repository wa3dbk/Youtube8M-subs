00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:06.069
Hi, I'm Steve Jones, and I am going to tell
you how a light bulb works. Well, first of

00:00:06.069 --> 00:00:14.300
all we have to see the construction of the
light bulb. In fact, the working part is what

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:22.280
we call a filament which is a thin piece of
metal, and this gets white hot. It glows very,

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:29.680
very hot, and of course, if it was in the
air it would actually burn away. So, we enclose

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:38.090
this in a bulb of glass which is sealed with
a screw thread on here to attach it to the

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:45.070
place it's being put, and we have two legs
here on which we hang the filament. These

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:53.390
are usually tungsten. The electricity comes
in at one connection here at the bottom in

00:00:53.390 --> 00:01:00.289
the middle, and it goes up through here through
the wire, and then down and comes out through

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:05.280
the screw thread at the side, or sometimes
we've got what's called a bayonet connection.

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.500
It depends on which country you're in. Either
a screw thread or a bayonet. A bayonet is

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:20.740
just flat. You push it in, and turn it, and
it jams. So, the glass bulb is evacuated;

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:26.110
that is, there is no air in here. If there
were air in here this, as soon as it got hot,

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:31.560
would burn away. You don't want that. What
you do is you put in a gas which won't allow

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:38.360
burning. You remove the oxygen in here, and
you put in argon gas, so this contains argon

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:45.270
and won't burn so this can become white-hot
and it will produce mainly light. Well, not

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:52.020
mainly light, actually, about ten percent
is light. Most of it is heat, and this glass

00:01:52.020 --> 00:02:00.820
bulb will get very hot. Normally, these bulbs
have a power of around sixty watts, so the

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:07.450
sixty watts is a an average. They, in fact,
go from something like twenty five watts up

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:14.040
to two hundred and fifty watts. A two hundred
and fifty watts lamp will actually use a current

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:26.150
of one ampere. A twenty five watt, of course,
will produce, will use a tenth of an amp.

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:31.849
So, there we have an electric light bulb and
how it works.
