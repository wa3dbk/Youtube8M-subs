00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:04.950
Neutral density grad filters, now what on earths that?

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.490
neutral density means there's no colour and it is a

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.000
dark filter, but the grad means it has a grodation, there's a transition half way through

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.010
the filter into a clear patch, Tom could i borrow one for a sec.

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:19.779
Sure. So i could show the good people, there tom's got one here.

00:00:19.779 --> 00:00:23.220
As you can see there's a dark area and then it fades through here

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.220
into a sorta clear area and what you do is you put the darker area

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:31.090
over the sky, or the area you wanna darken down, it need not necessarily be

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:33.410
for the sky, you could it for other things

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:37.610
but in this case it's the sky. Let me show you what i mean, let's just pop this,

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:40.820
see if we can get a moody sky with a mr maccy.

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:44.440
Let me see what happens, as i pull this down

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:51.410
here we go, you see that sneaking in, that's grey and darker sky coming down over Tom.

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:54.520
Now use carefully,

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:58.000
in the landscape this can make an
enormous difference unfortunately

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.469
the sun's just got in which is what always happens when you and I get together

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:03.609
to try and do anything isn't it.

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:06.750
But look Tom, let me hand this over to you because you're the master

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.030
you're gonna get a shot say of the windmill, so talk us through what you'd do.

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:14.100
Okay normally what I do is enhance the exposure, you can see

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.680
we've got this really bright sky, dark foreground

00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:20.170
so by putting this is the slot holder

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:23.430
and we'll just bring this down

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.350
over the sky just above the horizon line, Now if we had a bright sunny day

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.189
that mill would be lit up nicely and i would probably go to use a soft

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:37.150
gradation, which let me show you the
difference. So what you have is this

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:39.490
filter which i have just shown you on Jaynes camera and has got like a

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:43.159
hard line, the gradation is quite servere.

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:46.270
okay there we can see the difference
between the two

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:51.119
gradations, that's a big difference, yep. Now in this instance i'm gonna show you the

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:53.509
hard gradation because it's going to be more evident.

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:57.020
And why wouldn't you do it with a soft one in these

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:58.170
conditions? Okay in these conditions you know it's really

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.060
flat, er ligthing so we really want it to

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.520
accentuate those close clouds, and bring them out a little bit more,

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.520
so this wouldn't be quite so servere but in this condition

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.830
we're gonna get a bit of a black line on the blades of the windmill.

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:15.209
That's right, yeah. Okay which we wouldn't have with the softer grad but you've gotta do that

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:16.560
in more powerful lighting,

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:20.950
okay. So the trick with you using these is that you have to come down

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:25.120
just above your horizon line and depending on the aperture that you're using,

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.030
so if you're using a small aperture that transition is gonna be more evident.

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:32.620
Yeah because, it's witha smaller aperture, you've got a much much

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:36.140
deeper depth of field, it means whats closer to the lens is more in focus

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:39.319
so that transition effect will appear more severe so

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:42.970
like what I normally do is bring it down
just over the horizon line

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:47.819
and then back it of just gently a tad, okay? You can also check this in your depth of

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:48.530
field preview.

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:53.519
So i'm just gonna push that button and i can see

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:56.900
that that's just in the right spot. And now if i take a picture.

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:00.360
so is there anything special you need to do with exposure for this kind of thing?

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.000
exposures gonna be worked automatically
because you're using the matrix metering

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.120
in this, okay. It's gonna sit either you've dakened down the sky

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:11.879
and it's bringing the exposure values from your foreground, your sky and

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:15.200
averaging these all out.

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:17.769
so what you're saying is that if somebodys just begining with stuff they

00:03:17.769 --> 00:03:19.099
could easily be using

00:03:19.099 --> 00:03:23.260
an aperture priority or shutter
priority the camera will work it out you

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:25.930
don't have to know about the manual
settings to use one

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:29.629
that's right, yeah. Okay okay so you're taking the shot, okay so we've done the shot

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:33.590
now you can see we've got that really great moody sky, that has given a really moody sky

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:34.260
actually.

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.879
can you take one with the filter, just so we can show the folks the diffrence.

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:42.760
Yeah, now you can see in the photograph you can hardly see any of the clouds,

00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:47.080
the skies washed out yeah okay but by putting that back

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:48.230
it evens the contrast range

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:53.099
out in the scene. There we go

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:57.890
and because the camera is seeing a darker sky it's giving slightly more exposure which

00:03:57.890 --> 00:03:59.930
brings up the foreground at the same
time

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:03.180
and that's really all there is to a graduated filter isn't it?

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:06.930
It's not that difficult, yeah yeah. So if you wanna have a go with filters this is a

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:10.420
really great place to start because they're not complicated and that's really all

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:11.110
there is to it.

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:15.080
When you buy a lee grad filter you also get a, you get a holder

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:19.500
so that you can slide the filter up and down you dont have to hold it on the front you

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.130
can move that gridation about.

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:24.639
you just buy the adapter and according
to the lens that you're using

00:04:24.639 --> 00:04:28.590
so you screw that on and it just nicely clips on

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:32.630
easy. Isn't he smooth?

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:36.110
You're getting good at this Tom, so there you go

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:38.840
grad filters that's about all there is
to say about them, they're great, they make a

00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:39.400
difference

00:04:39.400 --> 00:04:41.600
if you wanna play filters it's a great
place to start in
