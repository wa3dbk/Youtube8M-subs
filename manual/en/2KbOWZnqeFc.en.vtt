What's up fish tank people? Fishtanktv.com, dustinsfishtanks bringing it to you early morning on a Sunday. The sun is just coming up over there. I am loving it! My wife was kind of up with the girl last night. She was not doing so well. We are about to have a cup of coffee. So excited! Had to show you folks what is going. First I want to say I feel bad for the Bengals fans and the Lions fans. Lions fans particularly, because your team was so bad for so long and you guys got to the playoffs, and you look great at first opening drive, and some of it. I like what see about what's going on with the Detroit Lions. Bengals, whatever... Mike Brown is going to screw up your organization I am sorry! But good job getting into the playoffs, because the Browns suck. They didn't get in. We are rooting for Denver today as well. Falcons, I don't really care about.
Got to tell you what is going on though.  Really sexy driftwood came in. This changes everything for the 220, for me folks. This is Manzanita driftwood. I am real jacked about. Obviously it does not sink. It is not doing me much good right now, but I have a ton of it. I am showing you guys that driftwood is a kind of one of those things that takes some time to really, to have work. I mean that one piece that I soaked, I had it for two years. Like this stuff, I am going to have to soak for a long time, but I am curious to see any feedback you guys have on getting this stuff to sink faster. Obviously I am going to try to boil the pieces that I like. I am kind of overwhelmed right now. I love the character of these pieces though. It's really cold, so I am not going to get my hands in the water anymore. I am curious as to anyone who has got a suggestion on how to connect these pieces. Because what I am trying to do is I am trying to get them as a big old branch, big old tree kind of deal. I am curious on some techniques on that, I think I might bore them out. I don't know, I mean just a lot of really cool pieces, I keep putting my hands in here. That piece is no joke, so this one really has my heart. What my plan is this: find a few of the select pieces get them and then boil them, and then see if they can even sink. If they are big pieces, you dip end-on-end and you go from there until they sink. Then put them in the 220 and kind of scape it out. I don't really have a full plan yet. I am kind of overwhelmed, because I have got so much of it. But that's really what I am doing, so pretty jacked about it. Got a ton of it. Lot of pieces, a lot of cool character to them! That's what I like! I like that they got all these like little knots and little you know. This does look cool in there. I don't know. If anyone has any advice, I am open to it. I am going to try and boil them, submerge and maybe with some rocks underneath here to get them sinking. Also when I put these in here I dug around and I did find a couple the goldfish, however I couldn't find the big eye Daddy from Cincinnati. I don't know if he is still in here or not. I didn't see him, the big bubble-eyed guy, but hope he is still around.
I just wanted to show you what is up with that. Species Sunday coming up a little later. I don't know what was going on aquaticjungles last night, but I appreciate all the business and we are working on some stuff out on fishtanktv. I am kind of pumped about that too! Life is good. Playing football is always fun and early morning videos are always fun! That's what I am doing. Got lots of driftwood. I am pumped. Give me your feedback on the best to kind of construct and aquascape, get it to sync. Welcome new subscribers! We are just going to keep on doing it! All these tanks are turned upside down for a reason. It was frozen last night, so if they had been upright with water in them they would have probably broken the seals, but since they were upside down the water is all drained, so they are all good. They could be upside all winter. A little tit bit for you all. That's what is up!
