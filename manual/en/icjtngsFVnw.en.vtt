00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Hello,
We are here to perform a demonstration

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.500
about the use of ultrasound
in the assistence of the bovine reproduction.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.000
We will use the Easi-Scan 
Which is in fact the most suitable equipment for the job.

00:00:14.211 --> 00:00:17.000
We will start by dress up conviniently
     

00:00:18.009 --> 00:00:22.711
in a way that the scanner becomes a good working tool
 not disturbing the technician movements

00:00:22.935 --> 00:00:24.015
Untill then.

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:30.242
It is important to have to arms free of wires or cables
in the approach to the animals. 

00:00:30.372 --> 00:00:36.372
For left hand technicians
the scanner should be place in the right side,

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:42.850
also because our free hand
should be free to acess the sanner commands. 

00:00:42.999 --> 00:00:46.562
This scanner is in fact
very easy to use. 

00:00:46.881 --> 00:00:52.881
To switch on the scanner
We should press firmly the on/off button and the image will show up. 

00:00:52.993 --> 00:00:58.593
This configuration comes with a binocular googles
with LED technology,

00:00:59.023 --> 00:01:04.863
which allows the technician to have
a clear and close image right in front. 

00:01:05.064 --> 00:01:09.000
This scanner also allows that the image is sent to a remote monitor 
thru Wireless conection, 

00:01:09.702 --> 00:01:12.702
were others can observe the same image
that the scanner operator is seing with the googles 

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:14.522
That is the procceding
we are about to take. 

00:01:14.922 --> 00:01:20.202
To approach the animals
we should place ourselves perpendicularly to the animal,

00:01:20.434 --> 00:01:26.194
introduce the arm 
and empty two or three times the excess of feaces, 

00:01:26.612 --> 00:01:29.012
in order to maximize the contact 
of the probe with the rectum walls.

00:01:29.172 --> 00:01:37.932
At this moment we should manipulate the cervix
in order to approach the uterine tract to the operator.

00:01:38.048 --> 00:01:40.408
The probe is now introduced.

00:01:40.942 --> 00:01:45.542
For me, It helps me to place the thumb beneath the cervix,

00:01:45.705 --> 00:01:53.065
which allows me to have an easy and fast
acess to scan the entire uterine tract.

00:01:54.965 --> 00:02:04.965
After the cow is manipulated and prepared the probe is introduced 
and the uterine tract is ready to be scanned . 

00:02:14.612 --> 00:02:19.000
The image that shows up
is an image with great definition.

00:02:19.612 --> 00:02:26.000
That black hole in the top of the image 
is our uterus with a dilated lumen.

00:02:27.112 --> 00:02:31.072
This cow has been inseminated 60 days ago 
and as it can be seen it is pregnant.

00:02:32.092 --> 00:02:40.092
Here, we can visualize the fetal cranium 
and the nasal structure.

00:02:40.334 --> 00:02:46.334
At this gestational period 
it is interesting to try to determine the sex of the embryo. 

00:02:59.882 --> 00:03:06.882
We start by identifying the insertion area
of the umbilical cord, just between the rear limbs,

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:14.360
and verify the two echogenic lines
that represent the genital tuberculum of the embryo. 

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:23.888
In this case, the tuberculum is imediatly caudal to the umbilical cord insertion which leads to the conclusion that it should be a male fetus. 

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:36.520
Focusing on the ovarian structures
we can observe a gestational corpus luteum.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.407
This corpus luteum averages 3 cm 
which represents a good size of the gestational CL.

00:03:43.407 --> 00:03:50.407
On the uterine wall 
it is possible to observe small placentomes,

00:03:51.907 --> 00:03:54.907
Which can be normally observed
 from the 6 weeks foward on the gestational period.  

00:04:28.567 --> 00:04:35.407
Looking now to this 70 days gestation,
we can already observe the movements of the limbs. 

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:42.000
In the toracic cavity, the heart beat 
is remarked to assure the fetal viability.

00:04:46.136 --> 00:04:52.000
Here we can notice the cranium 
remarking the orbital fossae and nasal structure.

00:04:58.488 --> 00:05:07.488
Examining with more detail the pelvic area
 we will try to determine the gender of the fetus.

00:05:26.488 --> 00:05:36.488
We can verify that in this case it is also a male fetus
since these hyperechogenic lines  

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:42.500
represent the embrionic penis,
imediatly caudal to the insertion of the umbilical cord

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:45.000
and between the posterior limbs of the fetus.

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:53.120
At last we are going to observe
a cow close to the oestrus. 

00:05:55.172 --> 00:05:58.172
In this transversal section, we can observe that
 the myometrium is enlarged and edematous, 

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:05.555
With an hyperechogenic line 
in internal surface of the uterine wall

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.000
related with the presence of mucous
and with the peri-oestrus period .

00:06:15.471 --> 00:06:21.000
Looking to the ovaries
we should search for the pre-ovulatory follicule, 

00:06:24.618 --> 00:06:29.000
The pre-ovulatory follicule is this round structure 
in the left up corner of the image.

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:39.500
This follicule averages
 1,5 cm width, typical of young females, in this case the heifers.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.423
We can always freeze and record the image,
transfer it to our laptop through USB connection,  

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:52.423
for in the end of the day 
take a look and analyse what we have observed.

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:58.000
I hope this demonstration has been more or less 
explicative. 

00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:00.500
See you soon!
