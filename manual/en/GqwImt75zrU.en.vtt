00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
Hello and welcome to the product design show.

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:04.519
I'm Vince Penman.

00:00:04.519 --> 00:00:06.160
And I'm Allison Toepperwein.

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:09.400
This week we're looking at machine tools
and how they work.

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:21.160
Machine tools make most of the things in our lives.

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:25.800
They shape metal or plastic by drilling, cutting,
bending or grinding.

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:30.600
In fact, our new machines were made
by our old machines, which were made

00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:32.000
by even older machines.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
But if that's the case, how did they make
the first machine?

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.520
No, that's not right.

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:39.320
No, still not right.

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.679
Ah, there, that makes sense.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.640
For the most part machine tools
in use today serve the same functions

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:48.200
as machines 100 years ago.

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:52.000
The biggest development
is that machines today are working faster

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.359
and making fewer errors,
that means greater productivity.

00:00:55.359 --> 00:01:01.039
Emco, for example, makes state of the art,
multifunctional tools that combine lathes

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.520
with milling machines.

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:05.680
With several shaping functions,
Emco's Hyperturn 665

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.400
is the company's most complex tool to date.

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:14.040
To minimize errors, the Hyperturn 665 comes
with a tool monitoring system that measures

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.920
the load on the various access drive motors.

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:22.560
Excessive load means a tool is worn or broken,
and low load indicates a tool is missing.

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.680
The crash prevention system installed
on the machine runs a virtual simulation

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:32.040
of the steps that the hyperturn will go
through in the next production run.

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:36.560
This simulation reduces the risk
of machine parts colliding with each other,

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.120
a problem experts call 'crashing'
since the term "Holy crap,

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:41.920
did you see that!" was taken.

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:48.560
Products like the Hyper are immensely complex,
some made up of more than 10,000 parts.

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:54.920
To ensure that the finished products won't have any
parts colliding when they get to manufacturing,

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.760
engineers at Emco use
the Creo Elements 3D modeling system.

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:02.840
Grinding machines grind tools
down to extremely precise measurements

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.680
and smooth the surface to achieve a polished finish.

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:10.960
Tools are typically placed in a grinding machine
after they've been cut and shaped by a lathe.

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:16.280
Jig grinders also do hard milling, grinding
down metals that are too hard to be cut by a lather.

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.960
Kellenberger has recently introduced a new jig grinder,
the Hauser 45.

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:25.400
What makes this particular jig grinder special
is the new wheel head.

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.520
A wheel head is the part
of the machine that rotates the grinding bit.

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:34.080
Vibration in the grinding process can lead
to a choppy finish or broken tools.

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:37.840
This new wheel head is very rigid so it really resists
vibration.

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:43.680
Engineers at buy design design machine tools that use
water jet technology to cut and shape materials.

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:49.120
Abrasive water jet cutting uses a precise mixture
of water and sand for optimal cutting power.

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.520
The machines shoot
an extremely high pressure stream

00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:58.080
of the water-sand mixture to cut through virtually any
material, from soft foam to hard metals.

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:01.840
Water jet cutting doesn't run
into problems commonly encountered

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:06.000
by traditional cutting machines, such
as thermal erosion of materials.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.199
And because the water mixture is kept cool, there
is no risk

00:03:09.159 --> 00:03:11.120
of the machine overheating and ruining the products.

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:16.560
The head of the cutting machine,
the part that shoots water and sand is equipped

00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:20.840
with a sensor to measure the distance
between the head and the material.

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:24.520
This distance is kept consistent
throughout the cutting process

00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:26.680
to avoid bumps and increase precision.

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:30.800
Note, if any of your engineering co-workers tell you

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:36.560
they've built their own super soaker that leverages water
jet technology, run.

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:37.400
Seriously, run.

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:44.840
You can try direct modeling yourself with a free
for lifetime version of the same software used

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:47.240
by engineers and designers at EMCO.

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:49.280
Creo elements direct from PTC.

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:50.560

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:54.400
That's it for the Product Design Show this week.
