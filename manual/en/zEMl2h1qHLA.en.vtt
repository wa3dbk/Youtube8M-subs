00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:07.229
let's talk about this

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:14.970
the

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.440
this was Budweiser's anti craft beer

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:20.720
brewed the hard way ad from Sunday's
Super Bowl

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:24.820
let's talk a little bit about first as a
glaring polka see from this advertising

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:25.690
is the

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:29.550
company I'm budweiser but also bought
some %uh the USA's largest craft

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:30.190
breweries

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:34.160
and most recently lesion who among
others producer P camp each

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:37.910
pumpkin amber well as offers

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:41.360
this ad is embarrassing more than
nothing but lies a share

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:46.130
fell 1.2 percent after the after shown
and this is how to respond saying is not

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:49.130
anti-crime of beer is just pro budweiser

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.310
from the beginning it's clear it's a
flaw snowy

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:57.200
Beauvoir sir you all look all the things
we can afford

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.670
fair enough I kinda pro in Budweiser's
to do this sort of thing

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:04.320
mall horse

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:08.000
messed up he got hitched a job with his
old glasses

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:13.520
comedy mustache in the swirling use nice
dark portrait studio class

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:17.720
because what every craft beer drinker
looks like the thing is disturbing about

00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:20.810
this scene is that Budweiser kinda
portraying him as the enemy

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:24.520
the other person the the person that
doesn't drink Budweiser

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:28.370
the person that they don't wanna have
associate with that brand

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:33.510
no beer drinkers look like this I don't
I was a kid I can't grow facial hair

00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:36.860
this is this is the result of four
months what the growing

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:40.820
on the pier by blog this at was expertly
broken-down

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:43.970
what repercussions is Apple may have for
the craft beer industry

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:47.980
for the scene in particular she says
that breweries have turnout defend that

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:48.970
fussy beer

00:02:48.970 --> 00:02:53.050

link to the recipe of those in the

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:56.459
description below its well worth a read

00:02:56.459 --> 00:03:00.430

0 tasting try as well get by on a
demographic that has always enjoyed

00:04:06.410 --> 00:04:09.630
tiny different beers in

00:04:09.630 --> 00:04:13.010
things that I developed my pups the
message here is

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:16.340
go off a bit if you actually think about
your beer you should just be some sort

00:04:16.340 --> 00:04:16.610
of

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:20.360
machine that exchanges cash from pace

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:24.140
0 yet as the Bakken beach and again a
couple but was well done yet is the

00:04:24.140 --> 00:04:25.710
exacting the bus was in a

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:29.700
America doesn't want you to be I think I
know enough people that

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:33.410
won't feel alienated by the thing this
at is talking about

00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:36.910
they happily order something like a
pumpkin peach allover

00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:40.250
physical awesome pace are wary now

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:44.890
of fun yeah probably yeah America yeah
prayers are truly a

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:49.390
didn't know them yeah the closing
statements in this added just

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:53.510
idiotic prime people not be approved the
hard way

00:04:53.510 --> 00:04:57.280
most are checked pressing a button and
waiting for

00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:01.340
budweiser to be pulled into bubbles and
it has a mohawk she's draw controls in

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:02.380
place in a bowl

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:05.970
that's the hard way this is the hard way

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:09.860
up but it was not as long as a hundred
fifty-year-old tree somewhere involved

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:10.210
in it

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:15.560
I'm pretty sure all the brewery's have a
harder time bring beer that Budweiser

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:16.350
does

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:22.120
cue this amazing tweet from Firestone
Walker bring the hard way since 1996

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:26.370

you can have it are I'm I just

00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:35.310
public property other commentators on
the side of her she said this brings up

00:05:35.310 --> 00:05:37.900
a ranger worries for the crop area and
just

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:40.960
brewing industry as a whole about
consistent quality

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:44.040
audience attitude towards the pier and

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:47.880
the fact that their bizarre beechwood
aged be able to enjoy the

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:50.940
ordering different beers or trying some

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:53.950
exotic beers this is just make them

00:05:53.950 --> 00:05:57.110
realize what's wrong with the stuff
they're not ordering for people to enjoy

00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:58.250
budweiser

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:02.330
is it does make them more proud to drink
it this doesn't damage any of the work

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:05.200
to bros before Monday thing i think im
aces stronger

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:08.080
we all know that there's no I'm right
and wrong with being a lot of people are

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:08.830
taking this

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:12.720
budweiser driver parsley and saying that
and robert died

00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:15.800
drip bowls a Budweiser or the other
rather

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:19.940
poured in there is

00:06:19.940 --> 00:06:24.900
that it back time do that yes I think
bob was a completely missed five because

00:06:24.900 --> 00:06:25.500
I for

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:29.180
Bassett damage the crop be a world the
overpass not

00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:32.990
school a lot of people talking of
passionate people talking about beer

00:06:32.990 --> 00:06:37.630
which is great lot to see it people have
piled to drink the beer if they do

00:06:37.630 --> 00:06:41.070
I just think you'll be better if they
start with the John horses I've been re-

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:44.250

since 2040

effect across the other fats
