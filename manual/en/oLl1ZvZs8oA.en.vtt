00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:08.139
Warhammer 40,000: Storm of Vengeance

00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:11.370
Hi everyone. So today I'm taking a look at Warhammer 40,000

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:15.129
Storm of Vengeance. A big thank you to
the developers for sending me out

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:18.580
a review sample to take a look at a few days ago. Now,

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:22.370
this is Warhammer 40k brought

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:27.240
into a kind of mobile experience, a pick-up  and play experience but

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.550
made available across PC, Android and IOS. Now,

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:35.019
we've had a look at this game on PC. It's been released today on PC and IOS with

00:00:35.019 --> 00:00:36.730
Android to follow at a later date.

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:40.539
Sorry don't actually have a release date for Android just yet but it's bound to be

00:00:40.539 --> 00:00:41.550
coming pretty soon Storm of Vengeance.

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.019
Now the whole idea here is actually pretty
simple

00:00:45.019 --> 00:00:48.230
but when you dig down into the game itself

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:51.829
there's a really complex strategy game
here. Now if you've ever played Plants

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:52.839
versus Zombies Warhammer 40,000

00:00:52.839 --> 00:00:56.969
you'll kind have a flavour for how this game
works. The idea is

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:00.280
there's a series of lanes, you will spawn your troops

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.040
into a particular lane, you can pick which
lanes you want to put them into. The enemy,

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.180
the computer in this case, or in multi-player games other players, will

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:10.490
decide where to spawn their units and ultimately they will clash with each

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:10.829
other Warhammer 40,000: Storm of Vengeance.

00:01:10.829 --> 00:01:14.149
The winner storms the lane, knocks out

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:17.369
the opponents' buildings and ultimately wins.

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:20.570
The victory conditions basically say that you've got to

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:24.789
knock out three of your opponents' buildings and then you win that mission.

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:28.030
Now there's over 100 missions altogether, 50 per side

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:31.100
plus a massive kind of multi-player aspect as well

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.740
which is cross platform which is going to be
really interesting. So effectively for

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:35.479
the multi-player you can play

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:39.579
across Steam, IoS or Android and everyone can play together.

00:01:39.579 --> 00:01:42.960
We're going to see a lot more of this from
mobile games that

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:46.789
also happen to have a PC component as well. It never really made much sense

00:01:46.789 --> 00:01:49.060
that we're all sitting in our own little islands.

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:53.429
Now ultimately, this is quite a deep strategy game. I was quite surprised Warhammer 40,000 I

00:01:53.429 --> 00:01:55.350
was expecting something that was just a little bit of a

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:59.560
kind of shameless cash-in really, you know. In the past we've not had

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:02.840
the best run of luck should we say with
Games Workshop's

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:07.350
licensing but here it's been really well executed and you can kind of tell

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:12.019
the developers really love the, you know,
world that they're working with here.

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:16.000
The modelling of all of the various different
unit types is absolutely fantastic

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.890
and I'll tell you, when all of those special characters come onto the battlefield you really kind of

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:20.440
get that Warhammer 40,000: Storm of Vengeance

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:24.690
ooh, that is just awesome, especially when, you know, space marine commander

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:29.220
slugging it out with an orc mech and it just looks absolutely awesome.

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:33.459
Now as you progress through the game and you kind of open things up, you can upgrade  all

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:33.879
of your

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:37.549
kind of special weapons and special powers
as well as being able to call in

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:41.000
kind of strike teams I suppose you could call them - special weapons

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.379
that you can bring onto a particular lane to help try and swing the battle in

00:02:44.379 --> 00:02:45.180
your favour.

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.909
It all works exceptionally well and ultimately I found that

00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:51.580
even though we're dealing with a mission that might last two or three

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:52.280
minutes Storm of Vengeance

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.280
that kind of I've got to play another one, I need to kind of

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:59.230
progress this story and open up more, it
really keeps you coming back to play.

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:02.599
And special mention has to been made really of the story that's being weaved here.

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:06.260
Because it's drawing very heavily on the kind of mythology that comes from

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:07.569
Warhammer 40,000.

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:11.209
But it's been really nicely done here. It's a shame there's no actual voice

00:03:11.209 --> 00:03:14.280
acting everything's delivered via kind of  on-screen text and you

00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:18.799
click next to see the next part of the story but
it's all really nicely done in the vein of

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:21.700
Games Workshop. You can tell they've worked quite closely with the guys at Games Workshop

00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:22.349
here Warhammer 40,000.

00:03:22.349 --> 00:03:25.790
Overall, this title is great fun.

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:29.599
Its pick-up and play nature means that if you're ever kind of stuck in a queue or something

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:30.879
you can quickly fire it up,

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:33.989
play a couple of games and you're not going to really feel like you, you know, are

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:37.769
losing time or getting bogged down particularly. It's working really nicely.

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:42.030
Overall graphics, animation, gameplay and
value for money here

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:47.430
is quite exceptional. A title that is costing around I think Â£7 on

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:50.920
PC and probably around the same again
on

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:55.019
mobile platforms, but ultimately there's a lot of content here for your money.

00:03:55.019 --> 00:03:58.569
I'm afraid I've not been able to confirm the exact price of the iPhone version of

00:03:58.569 --> 00:03:59.040
the game Warhammer 40,000: Storm of Vengeance.

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:02.540
Not been able to find any information about that  unfortunately but is up today and

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:04.590
hopefully it won't be costing too much.

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:07.860
Overall go and grab this title it's well worth playing

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:11.340
and if you love the Games Workshop
Warhammer 40k universe

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:14.599
it's been well realised here - not a shameless cash-in.

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:18.160
