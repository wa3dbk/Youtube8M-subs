Hi, I'm [? Miley Oye. ?]

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.300
I'm a member of Google's
Webmaster support team, here

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.660
to help you choose the
verification method in

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:15.240
Webmaster Tools that's
easiest for you.

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:18.180
All methods discussed in this
video can lead to the same

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:20.390
successful verification.

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:23.390
Once you've selected your method
of choice, please then

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:26.570
navigate to the resources
available to guide you through

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:29.250
the specific verification
process.

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.680
Verifying ownership of your
site in Webmaster Tools

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:36.610
provides you and Google a secure
channel for giving and

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:38.570
receiving information.

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:41.670
For example, Google can show
you more confidential

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.920
information, such as the search
queries that bring

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.280
visitors to your site.

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:50.660
And by verifying ownership,
you'll have privileges to do

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:54.020
things like adjust geotargeting
settings to

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:56.580
associate your site with
the audience of

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:58.620
a particular country.

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:02.020
Verification doesn't affect
your site's performance in

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:04.090
Google Search results.

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:08.850
By now, you've likely added your
site in Webmaster Tools.

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:11.630
Your site is where you tell your
friends or customers to

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.810
go to see your content, and
should match what is seen in

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:16.310
the browser.

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.030
All types of sites are eligible
for verifying

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.090
ownership with Google
Webmaster Tools.

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:26.560
A site can include a subdomain
or host name, like

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:32.290
mysite.example.com or it can be
the domain without a www,

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:35.730
like www.example.com.

00:01:35.730 --> 00:01:40.980
Or, the domain without the
www, like example.com.

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:47.860
Or a subdirectory, like
www.example.com/mysite.

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:53.760
Or www.example.com/
subdirectory/mysite, or some

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:55.690
combination.

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:59.690
There are some cases, such as
if you're using Blogger,

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:03.100
Google Sites, or a hoster or
provider who integrated with

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:06.540
Webmaster Tools, when your
site may be automatically

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:08.520
verified on your behalf.

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:11.880
You're all set and can start
exploring Webmaster Tools.

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.990
If not, let's figure out
the right method for

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:17.180
you to verify ownership.

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.900
Verifying ownership means
proving to Google that you, in

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:24.500
fact, own the site, and aren't,
say, a competitor,

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.910
trying to gain access to
valuable statistics and

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:28.160
information.

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.930
For more beginner-level site
owners, especially if you

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:37.680
haven't had a chance to try it
out before, verification can

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.220
be a little tricky.

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:42.610
The good news is that once
you're a verified owner, you

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:45.750
can easily delegate other owners
or managers of your

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:49.800
site without their having to go
through the same process.

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.680
There are several methods
to verify ownership.

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:54.400
There's a recommended method.

00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:56.200
That may be the easiest.

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.860
And then, there are also
more alternate methods.

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:03.690
For those who have several sites
to verify, such as a

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:08.124
multinational site that
has de.example.com,

00:03:08.124 --> 00:03:13.750
jp.example.com, and, say,
us.example.com, you can select

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:15.890
the option Domain
Name Provider.

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:20.240
If you don't see your provider
listed, select Other.

00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:23.610
For all other site owners, let's
look at this drop down

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:25.070
list as well.

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:27.520
Please check for
your provider.

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:30.970
Your domain provider or
registrar is commonly the

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:33.770
company from whom you purchased
your domain and

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:35.710
where your website is hosted.

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:38.780
If you see your provider,
using the customized

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:41.310
directions listed is
usually the easiest

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:43.310
way to verify ownership.

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:46.200
If you didn't see your provider,
or if that method

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:51.120
was unsuccessful for you, then
let's talk about the HTML file

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:52.290
upload method.

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:55.990
HTML file upload is a good
option for those who can

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:59.900
easily upload files to their
root directory, meaning the

00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:02.960
first or main directory
of their site.

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:07.950
For example, if my site is
www.example.com, I would

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:11.300
upload an HTML file to
my root directory at

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:14.790
www.example.com/--

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:16.750
and then my file here.

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:19.089
Or, if my site is
mysite.example.c

00:04:19.089 --> 00:04:25.230
om/subdirectory, then my root
directory would be at

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:26.480
mysite.example.c
om/subdirectory--

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:30.940
my file here.

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:34.830
If you're a site owner who can
upload files from either your

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:40.000
site administration tool or by
FTP or terminal or shell

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.700
access, an HTML file upload may
be a great option for you.

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:49.040
Another option for site
verification is adding

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:51.520
an HTML meta tag.

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:54.660
If you're familiar with writing
HTML code for your web

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:58.110
page, then this is
a great option.

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:02.120
Last, if your site already
uses Google Analytics and

00:05:02.120 --> 00:05:04.960
you're an administrator,
please see the Google

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:07.720
Analytics verification method.

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:10.680
Each of the methods we've
covered have their own article

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:12.860
to guide you through
the process.

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:15.590
Once your site is verified,
you'll see

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:18.220
success on your screen.

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:21.840
Now, when you log in to
Webmaster Tools, you'll notice

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:26.770
your site shows Manage Site
rather than Not Verified.

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:30.240
For newly verified sites,
you might not see a lot

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:31.870
of data just yet.

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:35.200
But if you come back within a
few days, you'll likely notice

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:38.300
more interesting data.

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:41.580
That covers all of our
verification methods.

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:44.450
We hope you were able to
determine the easiest method

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:46.460
for you to verify ownership.

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:47.710
Thanks for watching.
