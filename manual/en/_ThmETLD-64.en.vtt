00:00:00.125 --> 00:00:03.750
♪

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.333
MAYA: Has this
ever happened to you?

00:00:13.333 --> 00:00:15.042
It's happened to
me several times.

00:00:15.042 --> 00:00:16.708
Well don't panic,
there is still hope.

00:00:16.708 --> 00:00:19.375
But you might want to get your
phone out of the water first.

00:00:19.375 --> 00:00:22.833
♪

00:00:26.583 --> 00:00:29.292
Step 1: Turn your
phone off immediately.

00:00:29.292 --> 00:00:30.958
The water itself isn't damaging,

00:00:30.958 --> 00:00:33.125
unless of course
there is live electricity,

00:00:33.125 --> 00:00:35.750
in which case turn it off.

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:36.875
Step number 2:

00:00:36.875 --> 00:00:38.958
Do not reach for that hairdryer.

00:00:38.958 --> 00:00:40.875
The heat can
actually create more damage

00:00:40.875 --> 00:00:43.000
by melting sensitive microchips

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.625
and creating static electricity.

00:00:44.625 --> 00:00:45.542
Step number 3:

00:00:45.542 --> 00:00:46.833
Remove any casing,

00:00:46.833 --> 00:00:48.667
SIM cards, batteries,

00:00:48.667 --> 00:00:49.750
memory cards,

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:53.083
anything that will trap
water try to remove it.

00:00:53.083 --> 00:00:54.958
That can also include
opening your phone up,

00:00:54.958 --> 00:00:56.292
if you feel comfortable

00:00:56.292 --> 00:00:57.583
and have the tools to do so.

00:00:57.583 --> 00:00:59.708
Opening your phone will
allow for air circulation,

00:00:59.708 --> 00:01:01.583
which means no more water.

00:01:01.583 --> 00:01:03.000
Step number 4:

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.500
Get a container and
fill it up with rice.

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:06.625
If your phone is still closed

00:01:06.625 --> 00:01:09.000
I recommend putting
it upright on a tilt,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.333
so the water can drain out.

00:01:11.333 --> 00:01:15.750
If your phone is open
leave it on top of the rice.

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.417
Step number 5:

00:01:17.417 --> 00:01:19.500
Patience. Wait it out.

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.417
I recommends
leaving it for at least,

00:01:21.417 --> 00:01:23.667
at the very least 48 hours.

00:01:23.667 --> 00:01:26.042
I left my phone
alone for 3 days.

00:01:26.042 --> 00:01:29.208
The longer you leave it the more
you can get all the water out.

00:01:29.208 --> 00:01:31.250
Step 6: Test your phone out.

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:32.667
You can do this by turning it on

00:01:32.667 --> 00:01:35.833
or plugging it in
for some battery juice.

00:01:35.833 --> 00:01:37.250
If you're lucky like I am,

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:38.250
your phone will turn on

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.625
and if you're not boohoo,

00:01:39.625 --> 00:01:41.250
let your phone dry
a little bit more,

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.375
maybe you need a few more days,

00:01:42.375 --> 00:01:43.583
maybe you
weren't patient enough.

00:01:43.583 --> 00:01:46.292
Otherwise, that's unfortunate.

00:01:46.292 --> 00:01:47.667
I hope you guys like this video.

00:01:47.667 --> 00:01:48.708

00:01:48.708 --> 00:01:50.250

has ever happened to you.

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.583
Remember to do you, be
you, and stay true, boo.

00:01:57.583 --> 00:01:59.417
Be shameless.

00:01:59.417 --> 00:02:02.042
