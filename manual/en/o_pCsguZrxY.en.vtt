00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:11.750
If you've never considered drawing a style
of manga called Kawaii, you're in for a treat.

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:14.559
Kawaii is perhaps the happiest style in all
of manga.

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:18.770
It's also huge in Japan, it's been huge in
Japan for a long time but it's emerging now

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:22.140
in an explosive way in the United States.

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.340
Where do you see this stuff?

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.990
Well besides graphic novels, general manga,
it's huge in licensing.

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:31.649
You'll see it in toys, products, and apparel.

00:00:31.649 --> 00:00:32.780
It's everywhere.

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:34.989
Now I'm going to show you a couple of examples
of kawaii.

00:00:34.989 --> 00:00:38.059
I've done some mini monsters in kawaii.

00:00:38.059 --> 00:00:39.179
Here's one.

00:00:39.179 --> 00:00:43.720
Take a look at this, you'll see that, what's
interesting about kawaii is that often, they're

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:49.820
not always, but often they have thick ink
lines and it's a very flat graphic look.

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:52.089
It's not supposed to look like it has depth.

00:00:52.089 --> 00:00:55.480
When you simplify make sure that you add a
little style.

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:00.480
So when you simplify the hands, instead of
just adding a little bit of fingers here or

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.680
there, what I've done here is I've just made
a rounded chubby little arm.

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.800
That's how kawaii is done, it accentuates
the shapes.

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:11.310
Here's another example of kawaii, another
mini monster.

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:14.980
So you see, same thing, you know.

00:01:14.980 --> 00:01:20.840
Very flat looking, lots of obvious shapes,
and very simplified.

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.540
Kawaii has different types of characters,
not just these cute monsters.

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:30.250
It's got people, it's got the monsters, it's
got even inanimate personified characters

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:32.040
like food.

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:35.280
Funny and cute food, like cute cupcakes and
ice cream.

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:40.460
I mean, I know it sounds strange, but if you
see it you'll find it adorable.

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:45.660
The difficulty rating of this is easy but
with a caveat.

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:50.010
You see, the shapes are easy to draw, so the
characters are pretty simple.

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:56.370
But you've got to work at keeping it minimal,
simplified and yet making the personality

00:01:56.370 --> 00:01:58.210
come across to the reader.

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:00.070
So that's the key.

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:05.100
Simple expressions, but with big personalities.
