Hi, I'm Karen, for Expert Village. Then when
you have your design cut out, you want to

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:16.390
pinch forward the foggy bit and the outside
bit and the second layer, is going to go back,

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:22.919
so you just want to fold that all up, it sort
of looks strange but when it's in the card,

00:00:22.919 --> 00:00:30.609
it will all fit. That's your pop-up bit now
we're going to place it into the hand card

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:42.359
and you want to place the design, the fold
of the insert or pop-up insert, exactly along

00:00:42.359 --> 00:00:53.890
the folds of the hands. If you want, you can
bend the hands and bend the pop-up thing,

00:00:53.890 --> 00:01:04.129
to make sure that you're lined up, and then
we're going to fold back the tab, like that

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:12.240
and make a slice, here, where the tab is going
to go in. Slice it on that side and then go

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:19.590
to the other side and again, make a slice.
The tab is going to fit right in there and

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:24.350
you want it to be even with the edge of the
heart, so we flipped up the tab, to get it

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:33.660
out of the way, and then sliced, like that.
Now, we'll insert the tabs into the slots

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:48.080
that we just cut, on there and one there.
Now just pinch your folds again and we'll

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:54.770
test it out, before we glue it down. This
is what it should look like, with a little

00:01:54.770 --> 00:02:01.660
bit of a tab, sticking out on either end.
Now, we're just going to secure the tabs and

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:18.650
hide them so you just want to put a dab of
glue, under the tab, like that and I like

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:31.249
to just take the same color, that I used to
make the hands, and cut out a little heart,

00:02:31.249 --> 00:02:37.909
just cut out a small heart and maybe a little
bit more glue there and glue that, over the

00:02:37.909 --> 00:02:47.250
tab, so you don't see the tab and you don't
really notice that we've patched it up and

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:51.550
it has kind of a cute look to it, with the
heart. Let's do the same thing on the other

00:02:51.550 --> 00:03:01.040
side. A little bit of glue and then glue the
heart on and that's to cover up our tab, so

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:10.950
you don't see it, and there's your special
surprise present, a little foggy for you.

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:16.480
You can write a little note on it like "I
have a special surprise for you," so that

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:19.239
when they open it, there's a lot of love with
little frog.
