00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:01.680
I don’t have a lot this month honestly.

00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:07.061
I’ve been using the same things form the
past few months; so I did have a few, so I

00:00:07.061 --> 00:00:12.130
thought I would mention those because you
tell me all the time that you like my recommendations

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:16.309
for monthly favorites, so let’s get started
with he firs one!

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:20.550
I have been getting back into clip hair curling
irons…

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.270
I don’t know why!

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:26.750
I’ve been using a wand for the past 3 years
from nume.

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:29.020
You guys know I love nume!

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:35.739
They have incredible products, however I wanted
to find some clip hair curling irons and they

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:40.469
have a few, but I have so many nume wands
and I wanted to try a different brand out.

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:46.229
So, This is a T3 Twirl 360 curling iron.

00:00:46.229 --> 00:00:49.089
I love it first of all, for the packaging,
the color is gorgeous!

00:00:49.089 --> 00:00:54.219

Literally up your hair without having to hold
it and do this…

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:12.980
I thought It was really nice!

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:13.980

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.329
I’ll have all the information down below!

00:01:23.329 --> 00:01:26.270
This is the Kat Von D Shade and Light palette.

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:29.060
This is an eye contour palette.

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:30.090
This is what it looks like…

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:35.830
It is gorgeous!

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:39.609
It is so beautiful, I love how the shadows
are so blend-able.

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:42.520
It is powdery, but it is so easy to work with!

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.350
The colors are gorgeous!

00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:49.460
I thought this was a great start to my Kat
Von D Collection!

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:53.320
Next up, I bought this a long with the shade
light palette.

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.350
This is the Cover FX Custom cover drops.

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:00.090
I am in the color G50 which is the perfect
shade for me.

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.409
I went to the Sephora and I was playing around
with the different colors and it was between

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.100
this one and another one.

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:10.970
And I needed a yellow under tone…

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:16.920
I got this one because it looked more yellow,
it looked like it would set on my face properly.

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:22.590
It comes in these droppers and basically,
you can use this with any type of product!

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:27.010
You can use it with moisturizer and create
a light coverage bb cream.

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:31.740
You can use it on top of your primer, you
can use it along with the foundation — I

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:34.820
have it on alone today, and it is gorgeous!

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:35.910
I love it so much!

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:39.260
The consistency is very liquid-like which
is what I am a fan of!

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.780
I love foundations that are liquid like and
it just feels like it would blend out more

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:47.910
naturally and not look like a cake face.

00:02:47.910 --> 00:02:48.930
I recommend this!

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:51.230
This is legit what everyone is saying!

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:53.170
It is incredible!

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:54.510
That is the next thing.

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:58.850
So another product that is makeup related
is by Jordan makeup this is the complete cover

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:02.200
maximum coverage 2-in1 concealer and foundation.

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:06.040
And I don’t use this for a foundation obviously
cause it’s not my color I am a lot lighter

00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:07.040
than this…

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:09.560
But I use this for cream contour!

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:16.070
I will be doing my updated foundation /contour
routine… it’s not as extravagant as it

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:17.070
used to be…

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:18.790
Thank God!

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:23.420
But I’ve been using this to warm up the
parameter of my face with it and t blends

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:25.360
out like a dream!

00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:30.640
It come in this tube which is very sanitary
and I just use it on the back of my hand because

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:32.680
the back of my hand will warm it up!

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:37.790
I use my Real Techniques sponge and it is
perfect!

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:43.530
I like this, I recommend this and it’s not
that expensive! Jordan has incredible products!

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:47.220
So I recommend that you check them out!You
can also get this at walgreens!

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:49.850
This is my fave!

00:03:49.850 --> 00:03:52.990
Someone asked for a full review on this so
I will do a full review on this… but this

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:56.420
is my Sony Cyber Shot Camera!

00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:02.380
I won this from a NuMe Contest!I didn’t
buy it, but I did win it from a NuMe contest

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:05.720
and I didn’t even know I was going to get
something like this!

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:06.850
It is phenomenal!

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:13.320
The video on this is incredible!I did my last
vlog using this… and you guys were like…

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:14.520
is that an eyelash?

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:16.540
There is an eyelash on it!

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:23.710
It has great stabilization so if you are panning
or moving it’s not like shakiness everywhere!

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:27.150
I can’t want vlogs like that because I get
dizzy!

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:28.950
But this one is really, really nice!

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:35.260
The picture quality is gorgeous and I take
most of my makeup pictures using this camera

00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:36.260
now!

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:37.710
The flash is beautiful!

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:45.020
Its basically like a DSLR type of feel in
a compact look.

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:48.520
If you are looking for a camera I recommend
this one!

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:52.500
And again, If you guys want to see a review
on it, if you are looking for a vlogging camera

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:57.750
or just to have a camera for adventures and
stuff…

00:04:57.750 --> 00:04:59.910
I recommend this one!

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:00.980
