say hi g'day welcome to the simple
cooking channel today Aaron and I are

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:11.280
going to show you how to make two
ingredient ice cream it doesn't get any

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:14.219
easier than this
I didn't buying it from the shops and

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:36.200
this is cheaper so let's go get a mixing
bowl and add 600 mils of pouring cream

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:51.350
or pure cream like this now we just want
to beat this whip it until it's stiff

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:04.890
all right that's exactly how we want it
now just get a can of sweetened

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:11.820
condensed milk normally around the 400
gills find a grand mark just pour all

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:28.170
that in now you just need to fold all
this through it's as simple as that if

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.950
you wanted to have even more flavour
just add a teaspoon of vanilla hairy back

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:41.310
to the pouring cream or the pure cream
just before you with it now all you need

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:50.580
is airtight containers and just put the
mixture in now you really can't get much

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:57.570
easier than this you don't need a churn
and this is going to be really really

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:08.780
really yummy all you need to do is pop
on the lid this in a bigger container or

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:14.340
however many containers you need to put
it in pop this in the freezer I would

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.430
suggest putting it in overnight to get
the full effect but six to eight hours

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:26.010
is enough and then serve up and it is so
yummy there you go how yummy does the

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.640
head look ah

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:45.900
