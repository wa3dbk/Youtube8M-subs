00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:14.870
Do you give power away to the planets?

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:26.200
This is a question often being debated among
spiritual circles.

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:35.070
Unfortunately, most of the gurus tend to think
that, you should not give away your powers

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.070
to the

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:37.070
planets.

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:47.980
The bottom line is that, you are the person
who decides everything, not the planets.

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:58.390
This answer seems to be quite, agreeable to
your ego, and also by intellectual standards.

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:01.580
When somebody asked this question to me recently,

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:13.190
I said, it's not that you give power to the
planets; the planets give power to yourselves.

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:23.350
Not only the human beings, but including everything
that is living as well as non living.

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:33.580
Without the planets, nothing can manifest
life; even life is given by the planets.

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:43.869
So it is important for people to go deep and
analyze the concept,

00:01:43.869 --> 00:01:49.829
whether you give power to the planets or the
planets give power to you.

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:55.290
The planets are time metrics.

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:59.979
They meet out time.

00:01:59.979 --> 00:02:04.890
Without the planets, you cannot even conceptualize
time.

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.960
And astrology is about time.

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:11.780
There are up times and down time.

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:16.480
Is everyone in control one's up time or downtime?

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:17.480
NO!

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:18.620
So who is in control?

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:23.990
They are the planets.

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:31.420
So when the planets are running a favorable
time, then everything works.

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:38.670
And when you just move into a very bad time,
then nothing works.

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:48.300
This you can see in your own life and one
can even study and do research of up time

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:54.660
and down time in relation to somebody's life
and see if there is a correlation

00:02:54.660 --> 00:03:02.340
between the planets and happenings in your
life.

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:13.760
So that is a scientific approach; but simply
to say that you are really giving powers to

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:14.760
the

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:22.670
planets by believing in them is not an argument
that can be substantiated.

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:33.900
The planets have power to influence life,
to influence time

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:41.260
and that is the fundamental concept behind
astrology itself

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:45.330
and that is the reason why there are ups and
downs.

00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:51.769
So one may one to go and look at one's own
life

00:03:51.769 --> 00:03:59.209
and decides for oneself, whether or not you
give power to the planets

00:03:59.209 --> 00:04:03.220
or the planets rule your life.

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:04.970
In my own understanding,

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:11.250
I have done a lot of researches in my own
personal life and the lives of

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:13.780
thousands of people with whom I came into
contact.

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:21.810
Over the past quarter of a century, I have
seen that planets have influenced the

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:25.700
lives of the people, not the other way around.

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:34.600
It's not just by thinking that the planets
have no power, you can change your life.

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:40.271
You cannot, it's something like you are saying
to yourself that you are a billionaire or

00:04:40.271 --> 00:04:41.271
a millionaire

00:04:41.271 --> 00:04:45.910
and you can become a billionaire or a millionaire,
you cannot.

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:54.690
Just by saying that you cannot really influence
the planets; the planets will always influence

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:55.690
you.

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:58.000
They are part of natural law.

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:08.590
They are going to do their thing, regardless
you are saying that or not.

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:15.389
Having said that, it doesn't mean that you
are just victims in the hands of the planets;

00:05:15.389 --> 00:05:18.480
No, you are not a victim.

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:24.410
You can do remedies,

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:31.880
to address bad planets or to enhance the effects
of the good planets.

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:34.181
That's what AstroVed specializes in.

00:05:34.181 --> 00:05:42.340
This is the reason why I started AstroVed,
not just to tell people that you have very

00:05:42.340 --> 00:05:53.020
bad money, money karma or very bad health
or relationship karma.

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:59.530
You know that yourself, you don't want the
planets to say that.

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:03.370
But the planets are responsible of course.

00:06:03.370 --> 00:06:12.650
But then you can remedy the situation, I do
remedies all the time.

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:21.520
So do all the rishis, the rishis are very
conscious beings, they are conscious of even

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:23.759
a second.

00:06:23.759 --> 00:06:33.440
Ordinary human beings like us; as we don't
have the ability to see the changes that may

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:34.470
occur within

00:06:34.470 --> 00:06:36.600
a second.

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:43.039
But then the yogis have perfected their consciousness
that they could see very

00:06:43.039 --> 00:06:52.419
easily that this what is going to happen at
this particular second or even smaller divisions

00:06:52.419 --> 00:06:53.419
of a

00:06:53.419 --> 00:06:54.419
second.

00:06:54.419 --> 00:07:01.880
Because the time metrics in yoga, is very
very sophisticated and then they could go

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:02.990
into,

00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:10.710
very very smallest minuscule units of time
and understand it and relate it to planets.

00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:18.060
So that's the most important thing, even a
second or a division of a second,

00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:26.569
a hundredth division or a thousand division
of a second is also governed by planets.

00:07:26.569 --> 00:07:34.090
So you have to have a scientific approach
to the problem.

00:07:34.090 --> 00:07:38.040
And simple not accept that you are giving
power to the planets.
