Hi, my name is Leslie Moselle, and I'm from
Tampa Florida, and on behalf of Expert Village,

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:15.129
this is how to iron a dress shirt. Chapter
eight, sleeves. When you're ironing sleeves

00:00:15.129 --> 00:00:22.220
on a dress shirt the most important part to
remember is to keep the seams aligned. You

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:26.980
want to make sure that you're not getting
multiple, multiple pleats, or multiple creases

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:31.830
on your sleeves. You can usually tell where
the old one is and you want to make sure that

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.900
you stick with that same crease so that you're
not having multiple creases on the sleeve.

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:41.890
So the best way to do that is just the seam
that's on the under part of the shirt, just

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:46.920
use that as a guide, making sure that's flat,
and then you'll pretty much get the same crease

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:55.420
every time. Lay that flat on your ironing
board, and just make sure that all, the shirt

00:00:55.420 --> 00:01:04.540
is as flat as possible. You spray the starch
from the inside of the arm to the wrist. Make

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:11.250
sure to apply a lot of pressure. Make sure
you get all the way to the end of the seam,

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:22.110
underneath the arm tends to get very wrinkled
under there. Don't be afraid to get a good

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:30.380
crease on the top part of the arm, this is
a dress shirt, creases are okay. Men like

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:35.500
to have a nice creased shirt when they go
to work. And to get all the way to the cuff.

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:43.939
The one thing I always like to do is just
to flip it to the other side, spray another

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:56.090
layer of starch, and just repeat the process.
From one end to the other, trying to work

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:06.070
around the buttons and all the pleats. You
have a nice, finished product, and all you

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:10.019
have to do is just repeat the process on the
other side.
