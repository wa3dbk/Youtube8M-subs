00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:06.000
cars dot com auto maybe hi

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.800
i'm dave thomas for cars.com  com and this is the 2012 Chevy Tahoe

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:13.790
may be wondering wire spend the next
three minutes earlier online viewing

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:15.980
time with what is essentially a gas
hogging

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:19.170
SUV especially if gas prices on the rise
again

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.100
especially a cheaper more efficient
options out there is is the Tahoe

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.340
but more people bought in the last month
bit all the hybrids from Honda

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:31.440
twice as many but there's really only
one good reason to buy one of these

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:34.620
overcome parable crossover Picanto a
bigger boat

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.739
can also tell a bigger one of these or
even what are these

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:42.180
all keeping more than a couple these
happy in Kabul

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.980
along the way so how much trailer to top
hotel

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:49.300
say that three times fast well two wheel
drive they can tell

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:53.090
eighty five hundred pounds with coral
drive like the LTZ model we have here

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:56.140
a 200-pound now if you go to a crossover

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:59.450
like chevy's own traverse it can only
help 50 to 100 pounds

00:00:59.450 --> 00:01:03.250
the reason this contest so much more is
to the 5.3 liter v8

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:06.600
under the hood unfortunately that means
mileage

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:09.740
is in the Tahoe strong point gets fifty
miles around 30

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.560
21 highway and right around the suburbs
on earth who commits to work over the

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.490
past week the best mods i've seen

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:19.539
and optimal spring driving weather has
been about 30 miles per gallon

00:01:19.539 --> 00:01:23.850
you're gonna be able to digest a huge
gas bill a little bit better cuz it I

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.679
was relatively huge inside

00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:29.209
that's because there's a lot of extra
height here is a lot of crossover is on

00:01:29.209 --> 00:01:29.779
the market

00:01:29.779 --> 00:01:32.799
also because the front and second-row
seats are just right

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:37.179
ganic a lot of car shoppers I talk to
you they really want a passer from the

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:37.880
second row

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.639
to the third row saying get up and get
back there easily you will lose Cardero

00:01:42.639 --> 00:01:45.609
especially against the traverse which is
one of the largest in the crossover

00:01:45.609 --> 00:01:46.389
class

00:01:46.389 --> 00:01:51.229
with the topper third row in place
there's a 16-point 1962 cargo space

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:55.090
person that traverses 20 4.4 with the
Tahoe CA Sports

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:58.139
and their 60 point three more 68.8 cubic
feet

00:01:58.139 --> 00:02:01.929
take them out you have a hundred 8.9
cubic feet versus a hundred sixteen

00:02:01.929 --> 00:02:02.729
point for

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:06.259
and the traverse plus you never want to
take the Tahoe sees out

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:10.200
with a crossover like the divers the
third row folds easily into the floor

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.540
by auto industry standards a Tahoe is

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:17.020
agent have been redesigned in over six
years

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:21.030
Perth aging pretty well well the gauges
might look a little outdated

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:24.960
things like the navigation system or at
least on par with the competition

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:28.880
that does have options like the DVD
system in the back that's good because

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.600
if you're traveling for a couple hours
at the kids in the back

00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:35.820
poet a nice boat you might need a couple
days if you don't get that option

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:39.670
bring along a couple beers so that's it

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:43.530
are actually things to like about a
traditional SUV like the Tahoe

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:50.530
but if not where the towing crowd you
better look elsewhere
