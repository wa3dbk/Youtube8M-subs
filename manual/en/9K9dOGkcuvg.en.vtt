Hi, I'm Ben Krentz with ConEquip Parts.
We're here to show you how to correctly

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:11.099
check your final drive fluid.  We've got a
Komatsu PC200LC-6 that we're going to

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:17.550
be working on.  And what we want to do
first is we have to make sure that the

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:23.070
machine is level.  And if you come down to the final drive section here you would

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.260
be at 3 o'clock with your oil level and
then your drain plug would be down right

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:35.130
about 6 o'clock.  So, if that's in the correct
location, what we can do is you take a

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:45.090
hammer and you want to just tap on those pretty good.  What it will do is just kind

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.739
of loosen up a little bit of the threads
because they are under pressure.

00:00:48.739 --> 00:00:53.579
Also, you want to make sure that you
clean around these areas real good.  You

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.980
don't want any dirt or debris getting
put into the fluid.  So once we've got all

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:02.730
that cleaned off, which I have done
beforehand, we've got a half inch drive

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:14.310
ratchet.  Just put it in there and you got
to be careful a little bit because, like

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:17.970
I said before, these are under pressure.
So you just take them off a little bit

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.979
slow.  And if there's a lot of pressure
built up, you'll hear the pressure being

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:30.420
released out.  This one seems to be pretty
good.  What, there we go, we got some

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.689
pressure.

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:42.040
We want to release all that pressure.  We
don't want anybody to get injured while

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:45.850
they're doing this.  And what we're
looking for is we're just checking the

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:48.759
level on this one.  We want to make sure
that there's just going to be a little

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:53.380
bit of fluid running out.  If there's a
lot of fluid then it could be overfilled

00:01:53.380 --> 00:02:00.670
which is not a good thing either.
We released all the pressure here.  We've

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:06.340
got just a little bit of fluid coming
out.  So this machine is up to correct

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:12.000
levels so we don't have to worry about
final drive failure.

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:27.820
Just going to tighten this up.  And of
course, you would go to the other side

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:31.570
and check it.  Well, what Komatsu recommends is about

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:37.300
every two thousand hours to change the
fluid in your final drive.  It's a good

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:40.840
thing to check it probably about every
time you change the oil which would be

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:46.270
about 250 hours which is recommended. At ConEquip Parts we do sell a lot of

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:50.260
final drives because people fail to
check their fluid and that is the number

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:54.670
one reason why final drives fail.  So
that's why we wanted to do this video to

00:02:54.670 --> 00:03:00.520
show you how to correctly check and, as
you can tell, it's very simple to do.  But

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:04.360
if for some reason you guys do need a
final drive, we're here for you.  We have

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:09.490
used, rebuilt, and new aftermarket drives
available for you.  So give us a call.

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:15.040
888-983-7847 and we'll get set up

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:20.709
to you.  Thank you.  And as a side note
here, we want to add, if you do call in

00:03:20.709 --> 00:03:25.540
and you have a final drive need what
will appreciate is if you can take the

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:32.230
cover plate off of your machine, which
would be located on the inside here.  You

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:36.940
take the bolts off this whole cover
plate, will come off, and then you'll be

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:41.320
able to directly see into the travel
motor and the final drive.  And on the

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:45.070
back of the travel motor, the hydraulic
travel motor there will be a plate.  Probably

00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:49.930
about, you know, inch and a half by two
inches, three inches, somewhere in there.

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:55.270
But it'll have some numbers on it that
we will need ensuring accuracy of the

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:59.980
correct drive for your machine.  So make
sure when you call, give us the serial

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:03.730
number of your machine, the model number, and it's also very helpful to have the

00:04:03.730 --> 00:04:10.650
tag information off of the travel motor
right below this cover here.  Thank you.
