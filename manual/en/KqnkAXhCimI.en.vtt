00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:09.250
Hey everybody, 
what's going on?

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.490
It's Sam, and today I'm going to 
tell you all about this Samsumg.

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:16.670
This is the SC-MX20 
Flash camcorder.

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:18.950
And hey, if you're going 
on a trip this summer

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:22.450
or if you love to travel or you love to 
shoot videos of your friends and family

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:23.770
and load them 
up to YouTube,

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:26.880
this is definitely an affordable 
digital camera.

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:30.000
That is very cute! 
I love the design.

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:32.060
And it really fits in the 
palm of your hand.

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:33.730
I'm actually going 
to show you now.

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:35.300
Look at that!
I'm not lying.

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.310
OK, it really does fit in 
the palm of your hand.

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:41.170
Now, this is a fantastic camcorder.
It's very affordable.

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:46.500
It comes with a 34x optical zoom. 
A 1200x digital zoom.

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:48.490
You have a Schneider 
lens on here.

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:50.260
So, super high 
quality lens.

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:53.300
You have a 2.7 inch 
LCD screen.

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:56.170
I'm going to show you that 
right now. There you go.

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:01.550
Alright.  It also is completely optimized 
recording for YouTube, OK?

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:05.860
No problem at all.  You can easily 
shoot tons of videos on here.

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:07.510
And share them 
on YouTube.

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.640
It has image stabilization 
so if you tend to

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:13.570
shake your hands a lot 
when taking video.

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:15.210
Also face detection.

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:19.410
It comes with 32 GB 
of internal storage.

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.180
But it's also SD and 
SDHC compatible.

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:26.910
So if you need more storage, 
you can just get an SD card.

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:28.950
Now, the coolest thing 
about this thing,

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:30.390
no tapes!

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.060
OK?  You don't have 
to have any tapes

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:35.300
records directly to the internal 
storage or an SD card.

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.760
Now this also comes with 
a rechargeable battery.

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:42.510
And you're going to get about three 
hours of battery life on here.

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.670
So before you go out and 
take your next adventure

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:48.490
make sure that you 
charge this Samsung

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:51.160
so you can have plenty of juice 
to get you through your trip.

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:52.910
Alright, so let's start 
with the tour.

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:56.200
Again, here you have your 
2.7 inch LCD screen.

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:58.210
You have a record 
button right here.

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:01.790
You have your wide and tight and 
your menu controls over here.

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:04.140
And your menu 
button right here.

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.020
Alright let's 
turn her over.

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.440
Now, you have, the lens 
cover is open right now

00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:13.540
but to close it, you have 
your lens cover switch.

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:14.590
There it's closed.

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.570
And now it's open. 
Alrighty?

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:19.290
So moving over 
to the side.

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:22.450
OK, you have your 
display button,

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.300
your exposure 
and your Easy Q.

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.760
Which is another way 
of saying Auto.

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:28.440
It's going to turn on your 
image stabilization

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:31.700
and make sure that your settings 
are optimal for your shooting.

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:34.990
OK, moving along. 
We'll start up top.

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.750
You have another wide and tight 
feature right here for your zoom.

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.860
Your photo button. 
So as well as taking movies

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.420
you can also shoot 
photos on here as well.

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:47.890
You have your status indicators for 
your mode selection right here.

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.460
To switch back 
and forth.

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:52.620
And, opening up this door, 
you have your AV port,

00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:57.140
you have your USB 2.0 port and 
your DC in port right there.

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.650
And you have right 
here, this is record.

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:01.870
And your power 
right here.

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.980
Now, as I said, I really like 
the design for this thing.

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:07.670
Look at the way I hold it. 
It has a great grip.

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:11.380
It's so small. 
And it's lightweight too.

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:14.720
Stick it in your purse, take it 
with you everywhere you go.

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:16.370
OK, so let's get 
into the menu.

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:20.620
And I show you just how easy it 
is to navigate around this thing.

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:23.370
OK, so right now we 
are in movie mode.

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:26.400
And I'm going to hit 
menu right here.

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:29.750
And it brings up all your different 
customizable options.

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:31.410
Starting with scene.

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:33.810
And as you scroll through 
you'll see you have

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:36.560
Sports, Portrait, 
Beach, Snow.

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:38.650
These are typical scene 
modes that you see on

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:40.790
a lot of digital 
cameras.

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:43.060
OK, moving along. 
You can change your

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:46.590
resolution to Fine, 
Super Fine or Normal.

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:51.240
You can have your widescreen 
display, 16:9, on or off.

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:54.530
So if you're hooking up to an HDTV 
you can watch all your movies

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:55.610
on the big screen.

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:58.190
You can change your 
white balance options.

00:03:59.180 --> 00:04:00.200
Exposure.

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:02.890
You have your shutter, 
auto or manual.

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:04.700
Alright, if you want 
to shoot movies

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:07.040
30 frames per 
second or 15.

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:10.150
You also have your 
backlight, on or off.

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:12.380
Focus, and look!
Face detection!

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:15.690
Face detection is so cool how 
it focuses in on faces.

00:04:15.790 --> 00:04:19.400
It really makes sure that your 
pictures and your videos

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:21.720
come out clear.  
I like that feature.

00:04:22.190 --> 00:04:24.230
Alright, so moving along. 
You have anti-shake!

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:25.670
Alright, so if you are 
going somewhere

00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:28.540
where it's really hard to 
hold your hand steady,

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:31.580
you can definitely turn 
on anti-shake on.

00:04:31.750 --> 00:04:33.450
And make sure that your images 
don't come out blurry.

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:35.520
You have some cool 
digital effects on here.

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:37.320
Let me scroll down. 
Look at Negative.

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:39.590
Ha!
That's cool right?

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:40.900
Let me back up here.

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:42.930
OK, you guys 
get the point.

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:45.500
Alright, scrolling down, 
let's look at Art.

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:48.050
Ooh! 
That's fancy!

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:49.340
Look at our camera 
guy back there.

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:52.240
Very fancy stuff.
Emboss.

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:54.410
Alright, so, you have a couple 
here to choose from

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:55.710
if you're feeling 
creative.

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:58.740
You want to step out  
of the box a little bit.

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:01.590
Alright, moving along you 
have a fader, in and out.

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:04.750
And this great, you don't 
have to hook up to a PC

00:05:05.030 --> 00:05:06.600
and have some fancy 
editing software.

00:05:06.830 --> 00:05:08.640
You can just do this 
all on your Samsung.

00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:11.260
OK, Windcut.  If you're 
somewhere where it's noisy.

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:13.990
And you want to make sure that the 
mic doesn't pick up too much wind.

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:16.220
Your zoom, again. 
You have three options.

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:19.660
Optical zoom, which you have 
a 34x optical zoom on here.

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:21.590
Intelli-zoom 
which is 42x.

00:05:21.800 --> 00:05:24.440
And your digital zoom 
which is 1200x.

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:26.610
Alright you can 
set a time lapse.

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:28.650
Your grids for your 
composition.

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:31.030
Storage. 
And last, but not least,

00:05:31.260 --> 00:05:32.700
we're back to our 
scene modes.

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:34.890
OK, so that is 
in the menu.

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:37.920
Now let's go and 
check out photo.

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:40.120
In order to switch 
to photo mode.

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:43.070
Again, you just hit this 
mode button right here.

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:46.050
And now we are 
in photo mode.

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:48.420
OK. Now, and if 
you hit menu.

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:50.690
You'll see you have a lot 
of the same options.

00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:53.440
Which is nice 
to know.

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:55.270
Pretty much all the 
same options.

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:57.860
OK, so I'm not going to bore you 
and go into the menu here again.

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:01.800
Let's get out of the menu 
and let's go into playback.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.220
Again, by 
hitting mode.

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:07.030
OK, now we are 
in playback.

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:09.840
And this is how you can see all 
your videos, all your photos.

00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:11.940
Scroll through them. 
And if you hit menu

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:14.910
you can set up 
a slide show.

00:06:15.670 --> 00:06:18.310
You can delete files, 
protect them.

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:20.940
Pretty much the standard 
features that come

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:23.220
on a lot of digital cameras 
we see these days.

00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:25.370
So, again, this is 
the Samsung.

00:06:25.590 --> 00:06:29.200
This is the SC-MX20 
Flash camcorder.

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:32.130
No tapes required. 
Super lightweight.

00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:34.740
Love this blue color! 
This emerald blue color.

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:38.090
Or midnight blue. 
Whatever color it is.

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:39.830
It's pretty.  
I like it.

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:41.320
And it's super  
light weight.

00:06:41.580 --> 00:06:44.670
It definitely makes for 
a great gift too, OK?

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:46.630
If you feel like splurging 
on somebody.

00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:47.780
So check this 
one out.

00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:50.680
Again it's the 
Samsung SC-MX20.

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:52.760
I'm Sam and we'll 
see you next time.

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:58.100

Samsung SC-MX20 Flash camcorder
