00:00:05.589 --> 00:00:13.700
In the first section of this course, we will
look closely at each type of variation: Pre-analytical,

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:18.980
Analytical and Biological.

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:21.990
Variation in a test result is expected.

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:27.560
Because of factors before and during testing,
we can never know the “true value” of

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:30.410
an analyte.

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:36.000
Controlling variation is critical to ensuring
every result reported is as close to the true

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.760
value as possible.

00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:44.120
Too much variation can result in the reporting
of erroneous patient test results leading

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:52.450
to misdiagnosis, an incorrect prognosis, or
an inappropriate treatment plan for the patient.

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:59.010
Frequent reporting of erroneous results by
a laboratory will seriously diminish its credibility

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.430
and may result in liability.

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:07.799
We will begin with Pre-analytical Variation
and its causes.

00:01:07.799 --> 00:01:14.950
Pre-analytical Variation occurs prior to the
analysis of a sample.

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:23.130
Three main areas susceptible to Pre-analytical
Variation are: patient preparation, specimen

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:28.600
collection, specimen transportation.

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:34.459
When preparing a patient for specimen collection,
the instructions given to the patient need

00:01:34.459 --> 00:01:37.609
to be clear and consistent.

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:42.990
The patient should be able to demonstrate
an understanding of the instructions.

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:48.219
For example, numerous tests require a patient
to fast.

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:53.289
The patient will need to know what fasting
is and for how long they should fast before

00:01:53.289 --> 00:01:55.520
specimen collection.

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:59.359
Here are two additional examples:

00:01:59.359 --> 00:02:01.810
Aspirin can falsely elevate bleeding times.

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:07.770
A patient will need to know she must stop
taking aspirin for a period of days before

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.550
a bleeding time test is performed.

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:16.290
High levels of Vitamin C can cause a false
positive for glucose in the urine.

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:23.159
A patient taking excess amounts of Vitamin
C may need to stop taking it prior to a urinalysis

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:24.900
test.

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:31.330
Adherence to approved specimen collection
procedures is important to control Pre-analytical

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:33.879
Variation.

00:02:33.879 --> 00:02:41.069
During blood collection, the following errors
can adversely affect the integrity of a specimen:

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:47.959
Leaving a tourniquet on the arm, ankle or
hand too long can cause an elevation in some

00:02:47.959 --> 00:02:49.590
analytes.

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:56.440
The position of a patient, as a blood sample
is drawn, can also lead to variation.

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:02.349
For example, outpatients who tend to have
their blood collected while seated can have

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:09.640
values 5% higher for some tests when compared
to their in-patient counterparts who generally

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.879
lie down for blood collection.

00:03:12.879 --> 00:03:18.780
Using a collection tube containing the incorrect
anticoagulant for a test can cause error in

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:20.569
a result.

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:28.810
For example, a light gray top collection tube
contains sodium fluoride and potassium oxylate;

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:32.349
agents that preserve glucose.

00:03:32.349 --> 00:03:38.590
If a different anticoagulate is used a lower
level of glucose could be reported.

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:44.659
Hemolysis, the breakage of red blood cells,
can cause the increase of certain analytes

00:03:44.659 --> 00:03:49.620
due to leakage of red cell components into
the surrounding fluid.

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:56.989
It can also cause interference in tests using,
for example, a spectrophotometric method.

00:03:56.989 --> 00:04:03.540
Other factors that can affect the Pre-analytical
Variation of a result are issues with specimen

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:06.140
transport.

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:11.099
Cellular metabolism within a specimen continues
after collection.

00:04:11.099 --> 00:04:16.620
If there is either a significant delay in
delivery or, for some analytes, the sample

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:23.949
is transported at the wrong temperature, there
can be a significant impact on the result.

00:04:23.949 --> 00:04:28.721
Use of a good quality assurance program helps
to control Pre-analytical Variation.

00:04:28.721 --> 00:04:31.030
When controlled, this type of variation can
be negligible; contributing little to the

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:32.030
overall variation of a result.

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:33.030
Use of a good quality assurance program helps
to control Pre-analytical Variation.

00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:36.639
When controlled, this type of variation can
be negligible; contributing little to the

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:39.139
overall variation of a result.

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:45.550
Let’s review what we’ve learned about
Pre-analytical Variation.

00:04:45.550 --> 00:04:53.080
Pre-analytical Variation is any variation
that occurs prior to the analysis of a sample.

00:04:53.080 --> 00:05:00.550
Three main areas susceptible to Pre-analytical
Variation are: patient preparation, specimen

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:06.419
collection, specimen transportation.

00:05:06.419 --> 00:05:17.530
Pre-analytical Variation can be and should
be controlled.
