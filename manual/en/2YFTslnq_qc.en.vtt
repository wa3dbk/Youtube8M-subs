00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.900
The golden rule to turret diving. Something
I generally like to follow is the three second

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:20.020
rule. If I can't catch up to and kill someone
in three seconds then I'll stop and back

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:25.619
off. In these next few clips we see this rule
holding true in each situation. First off

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:31.320
we have wukong diving, he certainly has the
damage to finish my xin off but he can't

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:37.250
catch me within three seconds since his flash
is on cooldown, and so is his E. He makes the right decision

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:44.250
and backs off, avoiding a death to the turret.

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:53.120
Next up we have fiora who dives me, she certailny
has the damage to kill me, but she can't catch

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:58.180
me in less than three seconds. Instead of
backing off she chooses to chase, and eventually

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:00.000
meets her doom to the turret.

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:09.380
In another instance we have khazix here, instead of not being able to chase, he isn't able to kill sivir even when he catches up to her.

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:13.880
The faster you can determine whether you should chase or back off, the more time you'll have to do other stuff like farming.

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:24.700
Always keep an eye out for the amount of mana the enemy has.

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:28.000
The point of this tip is to show you how important mana is.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:35.000
If you don't have enough mana then you're basically completely reliant on auto attacks.

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:39.550
As you can see here nidalee isn't able to finish me off with a spear due to mana, nor is she able to heal herself to survive due to mana.

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:44.660
In this next clip Vi is basically useless since she has

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:49.580
no mana to use any of her hard CC to keep
me off of lulu. Don't be afraid to fight someone

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:56.580
when they're out of mana.
