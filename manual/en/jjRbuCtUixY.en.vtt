00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:05.830
If you're looking for a great book on parenting
tips on how to be a good father to a daughter,

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:10.769
here's one that could really be interestingâ€”whether
you're a new father and even if you are an

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:11.950
experienced one, as I was.

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:15.839
Hi, I'm James I. Bond, founder of The Father-Daughter
Project.

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:18.460
I'm also father of a son and three daughters.

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:24.039
And let me tell you, when it comes to parenting
tips for dads with daughters, few people understand

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:28.250
it better than dads who've gone through the
experience themselves.

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:33.000
Most people throw a bunch of parenting tips
at you without realizing that raising a daughter

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.680
is different from anything a man will ever
experience.

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:41.829
I know because, even though I ran a training
and behavior management company, I discovered

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:46.059
first hand how difficult being a dad to a
daughter could be.

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:51.540
And when I searched for help and advice, all
I got was a bunch of so-called experts.

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:56.600
Their help was nice, but I needed parenting
tips that were fast and simple, that dealt

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.379
with the real issues of being a father to
a daughter.

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:04.360
So, to learn about what parenting for the
father of a daughter was really like, I went

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.460
to the source, real fathers of daughters.

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:09.710
And what they told me was amazing.

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:14.729
Better than any parenting tips I'd gotten,
from experts and from some of the best selling

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:15.729
books.

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:20.670
In the end, more than 101 fathers of daughters
agreed to be interviewed.

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.299
Not just giving parenting tips, but telling
about their successes and screw ups.

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:31.520
More than 200 hours of recorded interviews
from real dads talking about their own experience

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:32.520
with parenting a daughter.

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:35.830
The good, the bad and everything in between.

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:40.670
They talked about every phase of raising a
daughter, from their first experience of her

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:45.909
birth, through the twos, the school years,
the teens, her getting a driver's license,

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:47.150
and up through adulthood.

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:50.549
All the stuff that only a dad would know.

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:55.149
And because I had so much difficulty finding
the kind of parenting tips most useful for

00:01:55.149 --> 00:02:00.320
dads of daughters, I've made excerpts of these
interviews available in a new book, called

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.030
THE SECRET LIFE OF FATHERS.

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:07.479
In it you get to learn all those little things,
not just simple parenting tips, but actual

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:10.450
details about being father to a daughter.

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:13.970
Some of the complicated things, and plenty
of the really fun ones.

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:17.640
The kinds of stuff only a real father of a
daughter would be able to tell you.

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:23.890
And the best part is, it's in bite-size pieces,
so it's really easy to read and scan.

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:29.020
When it comes to parenting tips, people are
telling us, this is like the first-ever real,

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:31.830
training manual for fathers of daughters.

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:37.140
If you're a father to at least one daughter,
regardless of her age, you owe it to yourself

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:38.610
to check this out.

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:43.480
THE SECRET LIFE OF FATHERS, one of the best
books on parenting tips you'll find, cause

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.560
it's from real dads!

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:51.450
