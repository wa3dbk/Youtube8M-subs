Hi there, YouTube! Jonny Paula here with you again. I just wanted to share with you an explanation, a kind of 
 a backstory to a video I simultaneously posted alongside this one: "Is it a Good Idea to Panini Press This?"

00:00:12.312 --> 00:00:18.312
It was a video that Jory Caron and his former roommate, Zachary Little, 
 produced about seven months ago, back in March of this year.

00:00:18.986 --> 00:00:24.986
Now, they did it without my consent or knowledge at all, which isn't 
 a bad thing, necessarily. I just had nothing to do with it.

00:00:24.191 --> 00:00:36.191
I guess one night, spur of the moment, they had the idea "Let's go to McDonald's, grab some food, and then, Panini Press it, 
and spoof Jory's other, more successful YouTube show," the one that I, of course, produce and edit and am heavily involved with.

00:00:37.137 --> 00:00:45.137
So, Zachary Little shot it, he did all the editing, and he put it up on his channel. And I 
favorited it and let you guys know about it, and a lot of you really seemed to like it.

00:00:45.712 --> 00:00:55.712
Unfortunately, about a month ago, Zachary Little's YouTube account was suspended, for reasons that none of us have yet 
 to figure out. He didn't really do anything wrong. Maybe he just pissed off the wrong person.

00:00:56.023 --> 00:00:58.023
But anyway, Zachary Little is back up on YouTube, with two new accounts. 

00:00:58.792 --> 00:01:11.792
The links are right here, and I definitely suggest that you check both of them out, especially if you're, one, a big fan of 
cleverly written political satire, or two, a fan of Jory Caron, because he shows up in a lot of Zac's older videos.

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:19.750
So, anyway, after his YouTube account tanked, he gave me the file, and I'm uploading it up 
 here to you guys, so you can enjoy it right next to the microwave videos.

00:01:19.746 --> 00:01:29.746
So, that's the explanation behind the Panini Press video, and if you wanna watch it, which, kind of the point of this video 
is to point it out to you, then click the box right here, and you can go check that out right now.

00:01:30.557 --> 00:01:36.557
Well, for those sticking around to listen to what I have to say for the rest of 
this video, I just wanted to give you a little update on the microwave show.

00:01:37.331 --> 00:01:43.331
Of course, we're in between seasons right now, and Jory and I are going back 
 to work, to film the fifth season, on October 17th and October 18th.

00:01:43.804 --> 00:01:55.800
So, if you have an item that you'd like to donate and mail into us, try and get it to us before then. And to those who 
 already have donated, I'd like to thank you again, because my doorstep is piling up with all of the crazy crap you guys have sent me!

00:01:55.315 --> 00:02:02.320
And lastly, I just wanted to quickly ask your opinion of what you think 
 about YouTube's new "audio preview" button they have after every comment you post.

00:02:02.623 --> 00:02:09.620
I'm not sure if you noticed this, but if you post a text comment down below,  you have the option now to hear an audio preview of what you just typed.

00:02:09.062 --> 00:02:20.060
What the [beep] is with THAT bull[beep]?! I have no idea why they would even wanna put this on the 
 website! Is this for blind people on YouTube?! What the [beep] are you doin' on YouTube if you're blind?!

00:02:21.141 --> 00:02:34.140
And secondly, the button is in the same spot as "post comment" USED to be, so I have made the mistake, probably 
a hundred times in a week- I type the comment, and I go "post comment"... Oh, wait! They moved the button!

00:02:34.924 --> 00:02:43.920
It's like re-training my habits of where to click now, and it's extremely annoying! 
And if you agree with me, please voice your opinion down below. 

00:02:42.929 --> 00:02:47.930
I'd love to hear what you have to say about it, because 
it's been pissing me off for, like, five days straight now!

00:02:47.501 --> 00:02:57.500
Anyway, if you stuck around this long, then make sure to check out the Panini Press video. The link is right 
here, at the center of my fingertip, and until next time, folks, I'll see you later! Have a good night!
