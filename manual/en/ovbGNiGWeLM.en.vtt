00:00:08.046 --> 00:00:10.136
&gt;&gt;Jill: Every week our
students go on some type

00:00:10.136 --> 00:00:12.736
of Learning Expedition to
somewhere in our community,

00:00:12.946 --> 00:00:14.906
whether students
are on Main Street

00:00:14.906 --> 00:00:17.336
and visiting a fire station
and a hair salon to learn

00:00:17.616 --> 00:00:19.466
about physical and
chemical changes;

00:00:19.466 --> 00:00:22.846
or whether they're studying the
habitats of rain forest animals

00:00:22.846 --> 00:00:25.126
at the zoo, the learning
that takes place

00:00:25.126 --> 00:00:27.976
in their classroom then comes to
life through these Expeditions.

00:00:28.276 --> 00:00:31.006
&gt;&gt;Rachel: We are partnered
with seven museums.

00:00:31.106 --> 00:00:35.066
We work with their educators
to help enrich our curriculum

00:00:35.066 --> 00:00:38.086
and to find connections
that are natural.

00:00:38.086 --> 00:00:39.636
&gt;&gt;Jennifer: We went
to the zoo for one

00:00:39.636 --> 00:00:40.926
of our Learning Expeditions.

00:00:40.986 --> 00:00:43.596
They offer a lot of
rain forest animals.

00:00:43.906 --> 00:00:47.026
And we were able to also
talk about map skills,

00:00:47.296 --> 00:00:49.506
as that's a standard
that we need to cover.

00:00:49.506 --> 00:00:53.016
They were trying to find
their animal on the map,

00:00:53.016 --> 00:00:55.466
understand what rain forest
they were coming from,

00:00:55.756 --> 00:00:59.426
why different rain forests have
different types of animals.

00:00:59.676 --> 00:01:01.676
&gt;&gt;Rachel: There's a big
difference between a field trip

00:01:01.676 --> 00:01:02.806
and a Learning Expedition.

00:01:02.806 --> 00:01:07.166
We rarely, if ever, go
through a whole entire museum.

00:01:07.576 --> 00:01:11.646
The point for the students
is to go to see the exhibit

00:01:11.646 --> 00:01:14.016
that is connected
with the curriculum

00:01:14.016 --> 00:01:14.856
that they're studying.

00:01:15.116 --> 00:01:17.026
&gt;&gt;Trey: We go, not
only to the museums.

00:01:17.176 --> 00:01:20.866
Some of others have been
just community partnerships.

00:01:21.216 --> 00:01:23.266
You know, we go to Conasauga
River, it's an opportunity

00:01:23.266 --> 00:01:24.966
to work with the
Forestry Service.

00:01:24.966 --> 00:01:26.766
And we go snorkeling
at the river there,

00:01:26.766 --> 00:01:28.936
we learn about the
diversity of the fishes.

00:01:29.016 --> 00:01:31.926
That's a Learning Expedition
that's kind of birthed

00:01:31.926 --> 00:01:36.186
out of just the culture of what
can we find in our community

00:01:36.536 --> 00:01:38.116
that connects to
what we're learning.

00:01:38.256 --> 00:01:40.006
&gt;&gt;Drew: When we go on
the Learning Expedition,

00:01:40.006 --> 00:01:42.346
we have people talk to
us about our module,

00:01:42.836 --> 00:01:46.576
and they were informed ahead
of time about our module,

00:01:46.576 --> 00:01:50.316
and then they can inform
us on what we need to know

00:01:50.316 --> 00:01:51.666
and what we haven't learned yet.

00:01:52.186 --> 00:01:54.916
&gt;&gt;Maty: I really like going
on the Learning Expeditions,

00:01:54.916 --> 00:01:57.746
and getting to interact
with the actual things.

00:01:57.746 --> 00:02:02.076
Like when we were on The
Trail of Tears, we got to walk

00:02:02.386 --> 00:02:03.846
and experience how it felt.

00:02:03.846 --> 00:02:08.186
When we got off the bus, we got
a card with our Cherokee name

00:02:08.186 --> 00:02:09.706
and where we lived in Tennessee.

00:02:10.076 --> 00:02:11.796
&gt;&gt;Jamie: They went and
talked with a historian

00:02:11.826 --> 00:02:14.446
about the passage and learned
about the Cherokee's history

00:02:14.446 --> 00:02:16.516
and the decisions that
were faced at that time.

00:02:16.796 --> 00:02:19.306
&gt;&gt;Historian: So this is a space
that can also tell us a lot

00:02:19.426 --> 00:02:21.156
about Chattanooga's
indigenous past.

00:02:21.956 --> 00:02:24.516
That tells us about
the Cherokee.

00:02:24.936 --> 00:02:26.946
&gt;&gt;Jamie: They actually went
up to the walking bridge.

00:02:27.226 --> 00:02:29.316
One was the land route,
one was the water route.

00:02:29.586 --> 00:02:31.096
When they finally got
back to the school,

00:02:31.156 --> 00:02:33.406
they opened up their envelopes,
and inside it there was a piece

00:02:33.406 --> 00:02:35.146
of paper that said
if they survived

00:02:35.146 --> 00:02:36.516
or if they perished
on the trail.

00:02:36.516 --> 00:02:38.726
&gt;&gt;Maty: We realized how
hard it must have been,

00:02:38.946 --> 00:02:44.026
and like really how hard
the Cherokee had it,

00:02:44.066 --> 00:02:46.656
and how terrible it was to
get forced off their lands.

00:02:46.746 --> 00:02:50.236
&gt;&gt;Trey: The opportunities
that we have to go outside

00:02:50.236 --> 00:02:53.536
of the classroom
are absolutely rich.

00:02:53.726 --> 00:02:58.186
Giving the students all the same
experience is where you begin

00:02:58.316 --> 00:02:59.676
to now have a discussion.

00:02:59.676 --> 00:03:01.646
&gt;&gt;Jill: If you think about a
student who's learning English

00:03:01.646 --> 00:03:03.836
as a second language,
or a student who's lived

00:03:03.836 --> 00:03:06.826
in a high poverty situation,
who may not have had lots

00:03:06.826 --> 00:03:08.816
of these kind of
life experiences.

00:03:09.146 --> 00:03:11.286
All of a sudden, they're
going to museums every week.

00:03:11.286 --> 00:03:13.976
So their vocabularies
expand, their understanding

00:03:13.976 --> 00:03:16.266
of the world expands in
a very significant way.

00:03:16.676 --> 00:03:19.636
Over time, what we
basically discovered is

00:03:19.716 --> 00:03:21.486
that the world is our classroom.

00:03:22.076 --> 00:03:24.496
And that if our students
see learning taking place

00:03:24.726 --> 00:03:27.266
everywhere, they become
life-long learners.
