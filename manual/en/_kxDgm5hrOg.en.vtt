00:00:00.990 --> 00:00:05.930
You're watching Visiting Yellowstone.

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:09.490
Here in Yellowstone, we realize that many people will be traveling with pets.

00:00:09.490 --> 00:00:12.810
There are a few things you need to consider if that is the case with your family.

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:16.390
Pets are allowed here, but there are strict guidelines you will need to follow.

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:22.680
Pets are allowed in public areas, parking lots and within 100 feet of any road.

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:27.680
They must be on a leash that is not longer than 6 feet in length at all times.

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:33.110
Visitors are not allowed to tie their pet to trees or other objects and leave them unattended.

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:36.460
Pet kennels cannot be left outside of vehicles.

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:41.440
If you do leave a pet in a vehicle, make sure you have proper ventilation.

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:47.390
If possible, park in a shady spot or plan that part of you visit for early in the day.

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:50.910
Although the climate in Yellowstone is cooler than most of the country,

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.340
vehicles heat-up fast here.

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.100
Pets are not allowed on any boardwalks or trails,

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:01.000
and pets are prohibited from all of Yellowstone's backcountry.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.100
We realize that at first glance these rules seem harsh,

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.250
but they're for your safety and the safety of your pet.

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:10.100
Animals seen harassing wildlife are subject to impoundment

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:13.200
and possibly being destroyed or the owner fined.

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:17.150
Yellowstone is the land of bears and wolves

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:20.150
and many other things that can prey on domestic animals.

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:23.300
Bears and wolves particularly don't like dogs.

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:29.110
While it is possible that your dog may outrun a bear, it is unlikely you could.

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:33.120
Bears have been known to follow domestic dogs back to their owners.

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:36.060
Wolves see domestic dogs as competition.

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.150
Thermal areas, which are located all across Yellowstone,

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:45.000
pose a huge threat to your animals. Much of the thermal water in the park

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.260
is at or nearly at the boiling point. Dogs have a difficult time

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:52.030
distinguishing between cool water and hot water.

00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:55.030
There have been many occasions where dogs have been injured

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:58.000
or killed by jumping into hot water here.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.060
There have even been instances where owners have lost their lives trying to save a pet.

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:06.080
Be aware that diseases can be spread from domestic animals to

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:10.000
Yellowstone's wild animals and vice-versa.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.210
Mange, Parvo and Distemper are found in wild animals and

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:18.110
can be transmitted to your pet. You must clean-up after your pet.

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:22.220
It is required that you carry proof of vaccinations from a veterinarian.

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:25.250
Park Rangers may ask to see those documents.

00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:29.070
If you can't leave an animal home, but you would like visit Yellowstone

00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:32.110
without the worry associated with having a pet in the park,

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:34.220
consider one of the local kennels.

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:37.150
You will find a list of places that will watch your beloved

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:40.000
animals on our website.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.180
These services are located in communities outside of the park so plan ahead.

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:47.290
If you are going to stay overnight in Yellowstone with your pet,

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:51.140
you have some options. Pets are allowed in campgrounds and

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:54.200
the same rules mentioned earlier apply while camping.

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.190
Be aware that food and water bowls cannot be left outside.

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:03.010
Checkout our website for more information on safe camping in bear country

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:04.220
before you visit.

00:03:04.220 --> 00:03:07.170
Pets are not allowed in hotel rooms in the park,

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:10.200
but dogs and cats are allowed in some cabins.

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:13.260
Check with Xanterra Parks and Resorts for more availability,

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.280
fees and regulations (www.travelyellowstone.com).

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:19.000
We realize that pets are part of the family and we want

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.220
you and your family to enjoy the world Yellowstone has to offer,

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:26.050
but we also want to protect your family and the park.

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:30.000
This is truly an amazing place and if you plan ahead and use caution

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.330
a trip to Yellowstone is something you won't forget.
