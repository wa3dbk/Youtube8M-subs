for another Kids vs. Food?

00:00:16.201 --> 00:00:16.850
- No.

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:20.132
- No. I barely ate breakfast.

00:00:20.132 --> 00:00:21.226
- I'm nervous.

00:00:21.226 --> 00:00:23.394
- Hopefully it's not gonna
be something disgusting.

00:00:23.394 --> 00:00:25.501
- Better not be rotten like last time.

00:00:25.501 --> 00:00:28.116
I eat any food but not rotten food.

00:00:28.116 --> 00:00:29.296
- (Finebros) Are you nervous?

00:00:29.296 --> 00:00:31.173
- No. Should I? Should I be?

00:00:32.346 --> 00:00:34.813
Oh great. Okay, see?
Now you're making me nervous.

00:00:34.813 --> 00:00:35.856
- (Finebros) Well, today...
- No.

00:00:35.856 --> 00:00:37.823
- (Finebros) ...you are eating this.

00:00:38.388 --> 00:00:39.559

- (cackles)

00:00:48.663 --> 00:00:50.934
- Are we reacting to a React cake?

00:00:50.934 --> 00:00:53.707
- It smells good. It looks like cake.
It smells like cake.

00:00:53.707 --> 00:00:56.345
I just know there's something
up with this cake.

00:00:56.345 --> 00:00:59.300
- Wait, wait. You're gonna
trick me like in the pizza thing.

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.833
You showed me a nice cheese pizza,

00:01:01.833 --> 00:01:03.401
and then you traded it for something else.

00:01:03.401 --> 00:01:06.661
This cake that you're gonna
make me eat is gonna be disgusting.

00:01:06.661 --> 00:01:11.163
- It's actually the best-looking cake
I've ever wanted to eat.

00:01:11.163 --> 00:01:14.886
- Honestly, I-- I'm speechless.

00:01:14.886 --> 00:01:16.043
It's not my birthday.

00:01:16.043 --> 00:01:17.744
- (Finebros) You are here today
because the React channel

00:01:17.744 --> 00:01:19.494
is celebrating its one-year anniversary.

00:01:19.494 --> 00:01:20.715
- Already? Wow.

00:01:20.715 --> 00:01:22.613
- One year. Wow,
it actually doesn't feel like

00:01:22.613 --> 00:01:23.631
it's been one year.

00:01:23.631 --> 00:01:25.020
- (Finebros) So what
better way to celebrate

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:27.000
than eating cake on Kids vs. Food?

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.360
- I so just want to dig my face into this.

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:30.904
- (Finebros) So put that on.

00:01:31.408 --> 00:01:32.827

Give me a headband!

00:01:46.578 --> 00:01:48.328
