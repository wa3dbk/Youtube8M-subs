Hi, I'm Eugenie.

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:13.720
There were some poeple who asked for simple Valentine's Day chocolate recipes.

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:18.740
So here goes a 5-ingredient trouffle chocolate recipe.

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.200
First, over bain-marie, add in 9 oz of dark chocolate and 2 tablespoons of unsalted butter. 

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:28.610
And melt stirring occasionally. 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:40.160
Out of heat add in 1/2 cup of hot whipping cream and stir until homogeneous. 

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.580
Then stir in 1 tablespoon of Cointreau or Grand Marnier.

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.480
Both are French orange cognac.

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.120
If you don't have any, vanilla extract will be okay, too.

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:07.440
Now let cool in the refrigerator at least 2 hours, or until chilled.

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:14.540
Out of fridge, make a ball with a teaspoonful of ganache. 

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:24.580
Then roll in unsweetened cocoa powder.

00:01:26.774 --> 00:01:28.774
This is the basic 5-ingredient chocolate truffle. 

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:32.520
And you can also roll the truffle in confectioners’ sugar. Or your choice of chopped nuts. 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.820
This is Valentine’s special, so I will use heart shaped confetti.

00:01:40.713 --> 00:01:42.713
Voila, French chocolate truffle.

00:01:43.495 --> 00:01:45.495
I love rich and luxurious chocolate truffle.

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.120
It was easy to make, wasn’t it?

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:55.480
It's delicious, too.

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:58.840
