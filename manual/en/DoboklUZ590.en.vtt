Here I am with Golden Eye Reloaded.

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:05.120
Or should I say should I just say
"Golden Eye Call of Duty".

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:08.160
It take place as a weird universe,
is like a remake of Golden Eye.

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.040
Set in modern day with Daniel Craig.

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:12.160
But also still Sean Bean.

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:14.360
"Here we go, we're gonna sneak up behind em!"

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:15.300
"Slit their throats!"

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:16.320
"and Put their skin on!"

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.320

Who's driving this car, Sean Bean?

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:27.500
Oh wait.

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:29.200
It i- I think-

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:30.500
I think is Sean Bean.

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.020
Why is he in a Taco Bell photoshoot?

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:33.160
Sean Bean: "Alright James you're on your own."

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.180
"I gotta go get a Chalupa, see you later!"

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:36.860

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:44.600
Dunk: What annual shooter franchise is this remind you of?

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:46.420
GoldenEye, right?

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:49.340
It does pay some respect to the N64 one in that.

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:52.900
All you had to do is pretty much aim in 
the general direction of the bad guys.

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:54.360
And they would just get shot.

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.080
Oh oh! Dunkey busted!

00:00:58.380 --> 00:00:59.340
Enemy: "Hand it over!"

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:00.820
Dunk: Uuuh, I'll hand you over!

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:03.380
He handed over the parachute, but watch this.

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:06.220
It ain't gonna be a parachute in there. 
It's gonna be a bomb!

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:07.620
Watch this. Here we go.

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:08.880

Watch out, Doofus!

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:25.820
This where the James Bond goes.

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:27.280
Get outta way, Dumba!

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:28.660

James Bond: "No"
oooooh

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:46.320
Or am I?

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:47.060
What?

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.620
If his head is made out of invincible, 
why he's so easily intimated?

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:52.500
Oh no! They got Sean Bean!

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:56.120
He's going to shoot him, if don't- 
If I don't get my gun over.

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:57.740
They're gonna shoot Sean Bean.

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:00.800
But, if you seen Sean Bean's movies,

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.960
you know that Sean Bean always dies.

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:05.120
So, if... Sean Bean doesn't die,

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:08.200
Then reality itself will collapse.

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.100
On everything, everybody will die.

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.820
So, Sean Bean has to die I think.

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:15.060
So don't- don't give him the gun!

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:17.400
no no no no no no no- oh, Crap!

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:18.720
NO!!!

00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:20.140
No! No, Sean Bean is gonna live!

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:21.380
NO!!!

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:22.440
Oh wait [ Sean Bean dies ]

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:23.700
Oh perfect!

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:25.660
Alright, I save the day.

00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:30.660
