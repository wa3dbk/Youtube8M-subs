00:00:11.867 --> 00:00:15.617
The Little Pianist

00:00:15.617 --> 00:00:26.117
By Brij Kothari

00:00:26.117 --> 00:00:27.867
There was once

00:00:27.867 --> 00:00:31.117
a little boy named Azul.

00:00:31.117 --> 00:00:34.367
He loved to play the piano

00:00:34.367 --> 00:00:35.700
and dreamed

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:41.867
of becoming a pianist some day.

00:00:41.867 --> 00:00:43.450
Every Sunday

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:46.783
Azul went to his piano class,

00:00:46.783 --> 00:00:50.117
and practiced every night at home,

00:00:50.117 --> 00:00:54.117
just before going to bed.

00:00:54.117 --> 00:00:55.117
Azul

00:00:55.117 --> 00:00:56.867
became good at it

00:00:56.867 --> 00:00:58.533
because he

00:00:58.533 --> 00:01:01.117
was so sincere.

00:01:01.117 --> 00:01:04.617
He would forget to brush his teeth

00:01:04.617 --> 00:01:07.117
but would never forget

00:01:07.117 --> 00:01:10.700
to practice playing the piano!

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.117
One day,

00:01:12.117 --> 00:01:15.533
Vicki, his piano teacher,

00:01:15.533 --> 00:01:17.117
told him,

00:01:17.117 --> 00:01:18.450
“Azul,

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.783
you will perform tomorrow

00:01:21.783 --> 00:01:25.283
in front of a large audience.

00:01:25.283 --> 00:01:27.283
You are getting to be

00:01:27.283 --> 00:01:29.700
quite the pianist!

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.367
Your fingers move

00:01:31.367 --> 00:01:33.450
like a squirrel

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.867
on the piano keys.

00:01:35.867 --> 00:01:40.533
But, there is something missing.”

00:01:40.533 --> 00:01:42.533
“What is it?”

00:01:42.533 --> 00:01:46.783
Azul just had to know.

00:01:46.783 --> 00:01:49.867
He really… really wanted to be

00:01:49.867 --> 00:01:53.283
not just a good pianist,

00:01:53.283 --> 00:01:57.117
but a great pianist.

00:01:57.117 --> 00:01:59.283
Vicki smiled.

00:01:59.283 --> 00:02:02.200
She whispered into Azul’s ear

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:06.867
a piano teacher’s secret.

00:02:06.867 --> 00:02:09.200
“Play with your heart,

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:13.617
not with your fingers.”

00:02:13.617 --> 00:02:15.450
As always,

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.783
Vicki pulled out her box of stickers.

00:02:18.783 --> 00:02:21.700
Azul held out his hand

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.200
and Vicki stuck on it,

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.117
a gorgeous sticker

00:02:26.117 --> 00:02:28.533
of a butterfly.

00:02:28.533 --> 00:02:30.033
“There,

00:02:30.033 --> 00:02:33.033
think of this butterfly

00:02:33.033 --> 00:02:36.367
when you want to play with your heart,”

00:02:36.367 --> 00:02:46.867
she said.

00:02:46.867 --> 00:02:48.533
That day,

00:02:48.533 --> 00:02:50.700
when all the children

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.950
played in the park,

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:58.283
Azul just stared at his butterfly.

00:02:58.283 --> 00:03:03.033
He wondered,

00:03:03.033 --> 00:03:06.450
“I can play with my fingers

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:10.283
because I can move them.

00:03:10.283 --> 00:03:14.700
I can touch the piano keys.

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.117
How can I play with my heart? I can’t even see my heart.”

00:03:18.117 --> 00:03:26.117
How can I play with my heart? I can’t even see my heart.”

00:03:26.117 --> 00:03:27.783
For the first time,

00:03:27.783 --> 00:03:30.450
in a long time

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:31.783
Azul went

00:03:31.783 --> 00:03:38.450
to bed without playing the piano.

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:41.700
The night before his performance,

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:44.117
he did not practice

00:03:44.117 --> 00:03:45.867
because he did not know

00:03:45.867 --> 00:03:59.533
how to play with his heart.

00:03:59.533 --> 00:04:01.867
When Azul woke up,

00:04:01.867 --> 00:04:04.783
he looked for the butterfly sticker.

00:04:04.783 --> 00:04:06.367
Oh no!

00:04:06.367 --> 00:04:09.783
The sticker was gone too!

00:04:09.783 --> 00:04:11.200
Now

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:14.033
Azul was nervous.

00:04:14.033 --> 00:04:17.117
Really nervous.

00:04:17.117 --> 00:04:20.200
He tried playing the piano,

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:25.533
but his fingers would just not move!

00:04:25.533 --> 00:04:27.033
However,

00:04:27.033 --> 00:04:29.367
that did not stop the clock

00:04:29.367 --> 00:04:32.617
from ticking.

00:04:32.617 --> 00:04:36.867
Soon it was performance time.

00:04:36.867 --> 00:04:39.700
The piano was in the middle

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:42.700
of a round stage,

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:48.033
surrounded by rows of people.

00:04:48.033 --> 00:04:52.950
Azul walked onto the stage,

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:57.200
sat on the piano bench

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:04.367
and closed his eyes for a second.

00:05:04.367 --> 00:05:07.867
Remembering Vicki’s words,

00:05:07.867 --> 00:05:11.533
he thought of the butterfly.

00:05:11.533 --> 00:05:14.700
In the quiet of the auditorium

00:05:14.700 --> 00:05:21.367
Azul heard the flutter of wings.

00:05:21.367 --> 00:05:25.950
A butterfly sat on his shoulder

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:30.617
and started to hum a tune.

00:05:30.617 --> 00:05:31.617
His fingers

00:05:31.617 --> 00:05:34.617
began to move by themselves.

00:05:34.617 --> 00:05:38.283
His heart began to play

00:05:38.283 --> 00:05:41.117
the butterfly’s song.
