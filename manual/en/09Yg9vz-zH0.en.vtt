00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:06.360
[THE VICE GUIDE TO TRAVEL]

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:15.760
Morning. It's the day after Christmas.

00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:17.760
We're in a van going to Llique.

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:21.160
This village is about 300 meters higher
than Santo Tomás.

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:24.400
You can tell you're in the Andes when you pass cliff sides

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:26.520
that look like they're out of Land of the Lost.

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:30.960
[LLIQUE, PERU]

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:33.280
The origins of Takanakuy are a little nebulous.

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.200
The festival's name derives from the reign of Tupak Anaru,

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.560
the last Incan king to resist the Spanish conquest.

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:42.960
But there's widespread debate as to when
the practice actually started

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:45.600
and whether it has more to do with indigenous rebellion

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:49.160
or with Spanish dueling traditions,
introduced under colonialism.

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:01.600
We're just getting to Llique.

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:04.200
Festivities here have been going on for a few days.

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.120
They've been dancing.
Everybody's been drinking.

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:07.920
It's a bit of a scene already.

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:11.520
Hey. What's up?

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:13.840
Hey, gringo!

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:17.600
It's like, nine in the morning.

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:20.080
There's like four or five beer bottles
at those guys' feet.

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:24.960
Everybody's dancing their way into the church.

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.760
Looks like a nice little church breakfast scene.

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:35.480
It's kinda weird.

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:37.720
Everybody's wearing what looks like double masks.

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.760
But I guess that says something to the fluidity of religious thought up here.

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:54.160
Up in Llique, the Huaylia music was still fucking going.

00:01:54.320 --> 00:02:00.400
Huaylia dates back to 1560 approximately.

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:05.840
It's related to the big ideological
resistance movement

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:07.760
known as Taky Unkuy.

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:22.960
Taky Unkuy is the ideological and
cultural response against the Spanish invasion.

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:27.320
That's what the huaylia is meant to express,

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:33.120
that we're here too. That we live
and make ourselves felt.

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:37.120
The dancing up here's a little less ornate than down below,

00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:38.600
a little less bird-like,

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.320
but that may be the result of them partying for three days.

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:46.400
Beats normal Sunday services.

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:50.960
People who dance and listen
to Huaylia get transformed.

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:53.400
They become another person.

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.040
And the next day you feel like new,

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.680
as if you'd just been born.

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.600
That was a pretty brief service.

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:03.040
Kinda like that.

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:04.520
Here they go now.

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:13.840
After a few more drinks

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.760
it was finally time to head to the town center and watch the fights.

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.040
This village has like, 300 people in it,

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:21.880
but on Takanakuy Day it grows to 3,000

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:23.680
because everybody comes in here,

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:26.200
because these are the guys
that are the best fighters in the region,

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:28.680
which is cool because we wanna see some great fights,

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:30.960
but not so hot for me
because I have to fight one of them.

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:46.480
It's like being in the Roman Colosseum,

00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:48.240
replete with dudes with whips.

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:51.800
It was pretty clear from the get go
that Llique's reputation is well-earned.

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:56.120
Even the kids' fights here were a million times more intense than the ones in Santo Tomás.

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:02.880
Someone was showing me how to wrap this,

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.560
until we got whipped by a guy

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:06.880
that was pretty rude.

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.120
So, this is the guy I'm fighting.

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:12.440
He owns a pet eagle, has two girlfriends
and rides a motorcycle.

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:14.800
He's also taller than me

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:16.480
and he has long hair.

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:18.440
[JOSÉ
FIGHTER/LLIQUE LOCAL]
I'm not looking forward to this fucking fight.

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:20.880
José was fighting a rival before me,

00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:23.400
which gave me the opportunity to see what I was up against

00:04:23.560 --> 00:04:26.960
and hopefully get a little handicap, courtesy of said rival.

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:38.760
I'm starting to...starting to freak out.

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:48.560
My bowels just clenched, man.

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.560
I haven't had any training for this

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:55.880
and I don't think my opponent has either,

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:58.000
but I'm pretty sure my opponent's life is training.

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:02.840
Ready?

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:04.280
OK. Let's do it.

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:40.960
Ah, fuck.

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:42.680
I got nailed.

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:46.880
Good fight.

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:54.320
I may not have won the fight

00:05:54.480 --> 00:05:55.880
or come anywhere close

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:58.520
or at any point look like I ever could have,

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:02.320
but all the townspeople seemed pretty psyched to watch a gringo fight and lose.

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:04.040
So, at least I gave them that.

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:13.520
Truthfully, as far as makeshift justice systems go,

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:15.600
Takanakuy's got a lot going for it,

00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:17.440
especially compared to our courts.

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:20.480
Their turnover rate for cases is extraordinarily quick,

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:23.680
the results are immediate and satisfying for the winners.

00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:25.280
If you've got a problem with them,

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:27.240
you can always go back in the ring for an appeal.

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:30.000
The rest of Peru may look down on Takanakuy

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:31.920
as a symptom of rural backwardness,

00:06:32.080 --> 00:06:34.040
but while they're sitting in a lawyer's office

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:35.640
filling out reams of paper work,

00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:39.280
the plaintiffs of Chumbivilcas already have their arms around the defendant's shoulder

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:41.520
and are drowning their problems in beer.

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:43.440
Not a bad way to spend a Christmas.

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:49.880
Still dancing.
