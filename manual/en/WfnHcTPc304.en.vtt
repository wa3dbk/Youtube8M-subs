00:00:00.629 --> 00:00:02.962
(odd music)

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.539
- Hey there, and welcome to Don't Be Dumb.

00:00:09.539 --> 00:00:10.789
I'm Josh Clark.

00:00:11.661 --> 00:00:13.744
Thank you for joining me.

00:00:15.459 --> 00:00:19.626
Have you ever been in an
airplane and wanted to die

00:00:21.344 --> 00:00:24.416
because all of a sudden
your ears started hurting

00:00:24.416 --> 00:00:25.999
really, really bad?

00:00:28.046 --> 00:00:30.432
Well, that wasn't a demon,

00:00:30.432 --> 00:00:32.849
that was due to air pressure.

00:00:33.764 --> 00:00:36.514
There probably aren't any demons.

00:00:38.854 --> 00:00:42.437
See, there is such a
thing as air pressure,

00:00:44.136 --> 00:00:48.593
which is the amount of
pressure created by the weight

00:00:48.593 --> 00:00:52.593
of the whole atmosphere
pressing down on itself,

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:56.532
and you, on the surface of the Earth,

00:00:57.824 --> 00:00:59.966
and at sea level,

00:00:59.966 --> 00:01:02.493
that air pressure amounts to

00:01:02.493 --> 00:01:05.326
about 14.7 pounds per square inch,

00:01:10.801 --> 00:01:14.679
but normally you don't ever
notice this air pressure

00:01:14.679 --> 00:01:17.729
because all of the air inside of you

00:01:17.729 --> 00:01:21.312
and outside of you is
at an equal pressure.

00:01:24.702 --> 00:01:27.695
When you go up in an airplane though,

00:01:27.695 --> 00:01:31.122
you're going higher in the atmosphere

00:01:31.122 --> 00:01:33.455
where the pressure is lower.

00:01:34.508 --> 00:01:38.175
For example, at 35,000
feet the air pressure

00:01:40.785 --> 00:01:43.868
is under four pounds per square inch,

00:01:45.541 --> 00:01:49.624
which is a big drop over
what it is at sea level,

00:01:52.939 --> 00:01:55.689
but plane cabins are pressurized,

00:01:57.131 --> 00:02:00.538
they don't get down to four PSI.

00:02:00.538 --> 00:02:04.371
Most plane cabins are
pressurized to about 11,

00:02:06.088 --> 00:02:09.930
but still, that's enough of a difference

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:13.597
in pounds per square
inch for you to notice.

00:02:16.621 --> 00:02:20.621
The reason you notice the
change in air pressure

00:02:22.202 --> 00:02:26.369
is because the air in your
inner ear is trapped in there,

00:02:28.927 --> 00:02:32.819
and it's pressurized
to what you're used to

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:35.430
on the Earth's surface.

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:39.597
Since the air pressure
outside and the plane is lower

00:02:41.426 --> 00:02:44.026
than what it is at the Earth's surface

00:02:44.026 --> 00:02:46.609
the air inside your ear expands

00:02:48.478 --> 00:02:51.515
and presses your eardrum outwards.

00:02:51.515 --> 00:02:53.098
Which hurts so bad.

00:02:57.245 --> 00:03:01.412
Luckily, you have some release
valves for your inner ear

00:03:02.667 --> 00:03:04.667
called Eustachian Tubes,

00:03:05.583 --> 00:03:09.750
and you can activate them by
opening and closing your jaw,

00:03:13.135 --> 00:03:14.385
or chewing gum.

00:03:15.674 --> 00:03:19.325
This allows air from
the inner ear to escape,

00:03:19.325 --> 00:03:23.554
and the air pressure to
equalize to what it is

00:03:23.554 --> 00:03:25.221
outside of your ear,

00:03:26.835 --> 00:03:30.252
which means that your eardrums can relax.

00:03:32.049 --> 00:03:35.071
So, the next time you're on a plane,

00:03:35.071 --> 00:03:39.066
and someone next to you
is crying and screaming,

00:03:39.066 --> 00:03:41.066
and clasping their ears,

00:03:42.281 --> 00:03:44.268
you set 'em straight,

00:03:44.268 --> 00:03:46.518
and tell 'em Josh sent you,

00:03:47.959 --> 00:03:49.007
but tell 'em loud,

00:03:49.007 --> 00:03:53.986
because they probably can't
hear very well right then.

00:03:53.986 --> 00:03:56.069
Thank you for joining me.

00:04:02.261 --> 00:04:04.849
Do you have a suggestion for an episode

00:04:04.849 --> 00:04:06.145
of Don't Be Dumb?

00:04:06.145 --> 00:04:09.121
Leave it in the comments below.

00:04:15.601 --> 00:04:16.684
I don't care.
