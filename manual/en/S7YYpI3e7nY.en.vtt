00:00:06.920 --> 00:00:10.961
It's not often that a game's title says just
about everything you could hope to want to

00:00:10.961 --> 00:00:13.630
convey about a game before even loading it
up.

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:17.810
Aside from the basic top-down racing gameplay
that should be familiar to just about every

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:23.800
gamer, Amiga owners might recognize the influences
from Nitro by Psygnosis - this is no mistake

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:28.430
as the developer behind that title, Jamie
Woodhouse, is also the grand designer for

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:30.150
Retro Racing.

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:34.120
Players are given nothing more than the ability
to veer left and right and an acceleration

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:35.120
button.

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.570
After choosing between one of three basic
vehicles (each with their own base statistics

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:42.540
for speed, acceleration and tires), you're
thrown on to a track and must fight for pole

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:43.540
position.

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:48.269
To add a spin on this extremely basic formula,
players can pick up randomly spawned (but

00:00:48.269 --> 00:00:52.500
not randomly placed) items that augment the
three basic stats of your car.

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.830
A 'nitro' can also spawn, giving you a boost
when you need it most (or occasionally when

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:58.489
you least expect it).

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:02.260
This introduces more complexity than you'd
first expect as your vehicle's handling, drifting

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:06.600
and response times change dramatically with
each lap, making it difficult to consistently

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.280
stay on track - mastery of a track often feels
like it requires a Zen approach of being in

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.409
perfect harmony with your car.

00:01:13.409 --> 00:01:17.740
Countering this is the somewhat aggressive
AI that can be frustrating to a fault.

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:21.140
On each of the twelve currently available
tracks, the vehicles will veer and knock your

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:23.720
car, preventing you from making a pass.

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:27.430
While this is somewhat realistic, it can be
tiring to find yourself facing a third place

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:32.800
position once again because you couldn't make
it out of the suicidal pack of drivers.

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:37.420
Even if you insist on grabbing first place
wins it won't take long to finish Retro Racing.

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:41.090
This makes the lack of any reward, either
in the form of unlocked vehicles, harder modes

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:43.450
or even an achievement disappointing.

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:46.630
Three cars can be purchased if you want a
leg-up, but they're not required to clock

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:51.189
the game unless you're a high-score junkie
- in which case they're practically mandatory.

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:55.850
Retro Racing is gorgeously smooth and luscious
looking game with simple and addictive gameplay

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:57.600
that's fun while it lasts.

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.229
It's clear the real emphasis is on beating
other players around the world, thanks to

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:05.770
a clever and clear leaderboard system and
for those who have a fierce competitive streak,

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:13.890
this is the game for you.
