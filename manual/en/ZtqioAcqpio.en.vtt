00:00:07.399 --> 00:00:18.090
Hello and welcome to PDFsupply.com
Today we're going to be testing a CMM321 and

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:27.759
I'm going to be using a CPU374 IC693CPU374
processor and power supply is our high capactiy

00:00:27.759 --> 00:00:32.140
IC693PWR330 power supply.

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:40.040
You can use any size rack, I happen to be
using an IC693CHS397 rack, five slot rack.

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:46.440
and this is the only components I have in
the rack so what I'm going to do is I'm going

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:52.970
to go into my Proficy Machine Edition and
I'm going to go to Slot #2 which is where

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:59.820
the CMM is located and I'm going to select
a CMM321 and then I'm going to go into the

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:03.430
settings and I'm going to set my IP address
and sub net mask.

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:08.830
So, when you're setting the IP address, just
set an IP address that's above anything that

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:13.780
could be working within your network so that
it doesn't conflict with anything else, or

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:21.100
so more importantly you don't get a returned
ping that you're actually end up testing something

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.490
else other than you intended CMM321.

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:32.620
So, now that I've selected that I'm going
to download and run that and once this is

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:40.240
done downloading I'll be able to turn on the
outputs and test the CMM and here we go.

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:48.070
So, we're in Run Mode and I have two ports
that I want to test to test the Ethernet so

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:56.040
the first one is this 10 Base T using the
Ethernet cable I have it plugged into a local

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:01.159
plug here on our network and what you want
to do is once you've plugged that in you wait

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:08.179
for this LAN LED to start blinking and once
that's blinking which it is now, so that's

00:02:08.179 --> 00:02:11.379
okay to test.

00:02:11.379 --> 00:02:15.220
If you don't wait for that to blink, you're
not going to get a response so now I've opened

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:22.739
my command prompt in my lap top here and the
function that I'm asking to do is ping and

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:29.779
then ask to ping the address that I have chosen.

00:02:29.779 --> 00:02:31.379
And hit enter.

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:36.180
And you can't see this but immediately I'm
getting a response, and you should.

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:42.200
If it's working properly, you should get an
immediate response that it'll say reply from

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:44.389
and then the address that you've selected.

00:02:44.389 --> 00:02:50.379
Now, I want to check the AAUI port so it's
the same information but it's going through

00:02:50.379 --> 00:02:57.129
a different type of port and to do that I'm
going to be using this AAUI cable which looks

00:02:57.129 --> 00:03:00.120
like what I'm showing you here.

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:16.010
So, plug the ethernet into the bottom portion
and the AAUI connection underneath the CMM.

00:03:16.010 --> 00:03:17.189
So that's latched on there.

00:03:17.189 --> 00:03:22.769
Again, wait for the LAN LED to start blinking.

00:03:22.769 --> 00:03:28.840
Now, for those of you who are not familiar
with command prompt, I can give it the same

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:34.390
command to hit the same address by just hitting
the up arrow key and then hitting enter.

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:41.739
And again, I have an immediate response so
I know that this is working properly.

00:03:41.739 --> 00:03:47.159
So, if you have a situation where either of
these two ports or both of these two ports

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:51.849
don't respond immediately or don't respond
at all then you definitely have a problem

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:56.719
with your CMM and this is something that we
can repair here at PDF Supply.

00:03:56.719 --> 00:04:02.089
We have an exchange program, we have new and
re-manufactured products so if that interests

00:04:02.089 --> 00:04:10.589
you please see at www.PDFsupply.com Thank
you.
