00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:04.800
Are you free tomorrow?

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.400
You gotta grow up.

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.560
If you want this book

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:23.120
buy me a drink

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:32.220
What are you thinking?

00:00:35.734 --> 00:00:38.114
Are you waiting for his call?

00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:40.940
Forget him.

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:43.620
And delete his photos.

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.100
Which would you drink?

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:52.120
Iced chocolate?

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:53.520
Americano?

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:55.920
I like this better.

00:00:57.380 --> 00:00:58.460
Cause coffee is too bitter.

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:02.580
But I'll give you iced choco today,

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:05.740
cause you don't feel good.

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:09.060
Sweets are the best therapy when you feel bad.

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.560
Borrow me this book.

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.208
'Justice'

00:01:23.700 --> 00:01:25.700
I'll read this. I'm serious.

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:26.720
Believe me!

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.140
Are you free tomorrow?

00:01:36.449 --> 00:01:38.229
I know a nice restaurant.

00:01:38.229 --> 00:01:39.780
Let's go there tomorrow.

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.040
Ah you already have a plan.

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:46.440
All right then,

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:49.040
maybe next time.

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.740
Ninth, still have feelings left for him.
