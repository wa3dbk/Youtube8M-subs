00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.967
[music]

00:00:06.385 --> 00:00:08.568
I’m OU President David Boren. 

00:00:08.568 --> 00:00:11.122
My wife Molly and I would like to invite you to take a 

00:00:11.122 --> 00:00:13.259
closer look at the University of Oklahoma.

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:16.417
I think you’ll be pleasantly surprised by what you find both 

00:00:16.417 --> 00:00:18.878
inside and outside the classroom.

00:00:19.458 --> 00:00:23.452
OU’s first president, David Ross Boyd, stepped off a train in 1892, 

00:00:23.824 --> 00:00:27.492
and what he saw, most people would describe as a barren prairie.

00:00:27.678 --> 00:00:28.979
Was he discouraged?

00:00:29.071 --> 00:00:29.814
Not a bit.

00:00:30.325 --> 00:00:33.530
He had a vision of the great university that he was going to build here. 

00:00:33.762 --> 00:00:36.409
And he exclaimed, “What possibilities!”

00:00:36.548 --> 00:00:40.310
Boyd’s enthusiasm still exists today, and OU’s beautiful campus 

00:00:40.449 --> 00:00:42.725
is covered with trees and gardens.

00:00:42.864 --> 00:00:46.115
Most consider it to be the Central Park of the Norman area.

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:50.596
What best describes the university is our special sense of community. 

00:00:50.968 --> 00:00:52.825
We’re truly a family.

00:00:53.359 --> 00:00:56.842
Many people know about OU athletics, but you may not know 

00:00:56.982 --> 00:00:59.582
about the excellence of OU’s academics. 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.298
OU ranks number 1 among public universities in the nation 

00:01:03.437 --> 00:01:06.873
in the number of national merit scholars enrolled per capita.

00:01:07.106 --> 00:01:08.685
And we’re a leader in the graduation

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:11.843
of Rhodes Scholars and Goldwater Scholars.

00:01:12.446 --> 00:01:15.697
We’re strongly committed to keeping our education truly affordable,

00:01:15.836 --> 00:01:18.344
and OU is ranked by The Princeton Review among

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.782
the top universities in the nation in terms of 

00:01:20.875 --> 00:01:23.244
cost to students and academic excellence.

00:01:23.987 --> 00:01:27.748
Our recent campaign for scholarships has raised over $130 million,

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:29.513
and that’s allowed us to double 

00:01:29.652 --> 00:01:31.788
the number of students we’re helping each year.

00:01:32.276 --> 00:01:34.041
My office is always open to students,

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:37.802
to ask questions or voice concerns, or just to visit. 

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.867
My greatest joy each week comes in the classroom,

00:01:40.967 --> 00:01:44.722
where I’ve taught an introductory political science course every semester.

00:01:45.372 --> 00:01:48.159
We have excellent freshman year programs and support staff. 

00:01:48.298 --> 00:01:52.803
And we do everything in our power to ensure that our students will succeed.

00:01:53.546 --> 00:01:55.264
Through our faculty-in-residence program,

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:58.097
faculty members and their families live in apartments

00:01:58.236 --> 00:01:59.861
in each of our residence halls. 

00:02:00.419 --> 00:02:03.066
Living together helps create lasting friendships 

00:02:03.182 --> 00:02:05.132
between faculty and students.

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:08.546
We also limit English Composition courses for freshmen 

00:02:08.685 --> 00:02:10.218
to just 19 students 

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:12.818
and our campus writing center helps students

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:16.580
with research papers and writing assignments for any class.

00:02:16.812 --> 00:02:19.413
Our new student services center in Wagner Hall 

00:02:19.459 --> 00:02:21.897
provides students with a variety of programs 

00:02:22.083 --> 00:02:24.776
to ensure that they will excel. 

00:02:25.334 --> 00:02:27.818
It’s an exciting time to be at the University of Oklahoma,

00:02:28.236 --> 00:02:30.930
and I invite you to become part of the OU family.

00:02:31.208 --> 00:02:33.020
Your legacy begins now.

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:36.530
