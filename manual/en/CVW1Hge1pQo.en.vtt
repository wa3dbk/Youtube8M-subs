00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:04.279
Hey guys Level WHO here. Today I will
do my best to show you how to shoot down aircraft with a tank.

00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:07.830
There are some tips I will cover in another video about angling and positioning

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.309
But what I wanted to do was

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.900
talk about how to use the tank's cross-hair
to line up your shots.

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:20.000
It is not perfect, but try to pay
attention to the horizontal bars of your crosshair

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:23.410
These will serve as a great reference
point to line up your shots

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:28.300
I prefer the SABOT shell, but let's
look at the reference point for helicopters while using AP shell.

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:36.300
When you are zoomed in, you want to use the tip of the outermost line as your horizontal
reference point when the helicopter is going full speed

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:40.030
The helicopter is a large target so you can make some mistakes.

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:43.579
You also need to adjust for the vertical
height but somewhere in the middle of

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:45.370
the bottom veritcal line will get you started

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:51.820
SABOT shell is much easier

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:54.890
The reference point I use is in
between the outer single line

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:58.920
and the two stacked lines. Again, you
have to adjust for height,

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.500
and it depends on the distance,
but a medium distance like this

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.659
would require you to aim just below the circle in the
center of the screen

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:08.760
I will be the first to tell you that
you don't

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.080
always find a helicopter flying across
your screen like this. This is obviously

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:13.010
just for practice.

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:16.810
But if you start to practice this, you will start to understand the helicopter's speed

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:20.900
Then you can adjust your aiming point
based on the speed. Here a couple real-world

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:21.770
examples

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:28.770
coming up after this clip

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:36.140
And these aren't anything special. I
regularly hit these shots using this

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:43.140
method.

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:47.049
In this next clip, I am actively judging my shot using the lines on the screen.

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:51.430
I haven't found anything that I can teach you, but
if I do, I will make a new video.

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:55.280
Again, using these lines is a great starting point.

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.330
You can use the other lines based on the
helicopter speed as you get more

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:05.330
comfortable.

00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:12.680
Shooting helicopters is good, but what about shooting jets? Jets are more difficult.

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.740
If the jet is flying at normal maximum
speed, and he is not using afterburner.

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:18.970
center the jet on your screen between

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:22.490
text that says "active
protection ready" and the edge of your screen.

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:23.270
See it marked on the screen.

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:27.030
You can also use the text that says 60HZ and the edge of your screen.

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.750
 

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:36.590
It is not perfect every time, but it's a great
reference point. I didn't have enough

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:39.480
time to record real-world examples of me shooting jets.

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.600
But the real-world examples that I did
record of me shooting helicopters

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:45.600
I recorded in about an hour.

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:48.600
Watch the rest of this video to see some of those shots.
