My name is Phil Hoelcher and I am representing
Expert Village.com this morning and we are

00:00:07.972 --> 00:00:12.879
going to be talking a little bit about the
sport of Schutzhund. We are going to try to

00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:19.180
show you a little bit about all three phases;
the tracking, obedience and protection and

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:25.099
give you an idea today a little bit of what
this sport is all about. The sport of Schutzhund

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:31.589
is over 100 years old or the concept of it
at least is. We have been working in this

00:00:31.589 --> 00:00:42.149
country since about 1970 and Schutzhund has
grown a large amount every year and become

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:48.530
a very popular sport in this country at this
time. The people in Schutzhund that are competing

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:55.370
on a world level and there is many competitions
all over the world that the people from the

00:00:55.370 --> 00:01:01.519
United States are now participating in, we
are doing quite well against the rest of the

00:01:01.519 --> 00:01:08.100
world competition. Remember the original thought
of Schutzhund was to test the dogs to see

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:13.850
how that they would work with man. When we
first conceived this sport or the sport was

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:22.550
first conceived, we are looking at was a way
to test the dogs for breeding. Anyone that

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:26.941
you ask about their dog will tell you that
he is the best dog in the world, so it is

00:01:26.941 --> 00:01:32.170
very hard if you had a female and you want
it to take it to a nice male everyone you

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:38.469
talk to said that they had the best dog there
was. Well they decided is to devise a test

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:45.140
to find out which was the best dog, so what
they would do is they design tracking to see

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:52.350
how well the dogs natural instincts to hunt
and to work on his own, that was the tracking

00:01:52.350 --> 00:01:59.579
phase. The obedience phase was to see how
well the dog would work with his handler or

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:06.200
with his owner, how well he would adapt to
the training that we were going to put on

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:12.010
him and the third test of protection is to
see whether or not the dog had the natural

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:19.080
courage and hardness that we would want to
see in a working dog. So the original thing

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:27.370
was a test for breeding. Now the sport is
huge; there is 39, 40 nations, 50 nations

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:32.980
around the world now that are either in the
sport or getting into the sport and just starting

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:38.909
it. You will see this in the major competitions
where there are people now coming from all

00:02:38.909 --> 00:02:45.800
over the world to watch this sport. If you
