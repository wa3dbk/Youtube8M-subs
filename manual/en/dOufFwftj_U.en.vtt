Welcome to Real Men Real Style's You Tube
Channel - Hello from founder Antonio Centeno

00:00:02.649 --> 00:00:03.649
Hi.

00:00:03.649 --> 00:00:04.800
I’m Antonio Centeno, the founder of Real
Men Real Style.

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:06.830
And welcome to my YouTube channel.

00:00:06.830 --> 00:00:11.900
Now you’re probably asking yourself, “Why
is it worth my time to go through here and

00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:13.710
watch all these videos?

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.070
What am I going to learn?”

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:22.210
The purpose for this YouTube channel is for
men throughout the world to be able to see

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:25.850
really that style is attainable by the regular
guy.

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:31.280
It really doesn’t matter if you’ve got
$10 in your pocket or you’ve got a thousand

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:32.450
dollars in your pocket.

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:37.550
I’m trying to provide tips in which men
can, whether they shop at Thrift stores or

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:42.589
whether they shop at Neiman Marcus, they’ll
be able to go in there and choose clothing

00:00:42.589 --> 00:00:48.239
that looks good on them, and dress and develop
their own personal style.

00:00:48.239 --> 00:00:53.379
I think – I look around and I see all of
these men who – they really just don’t

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:54.379
know how to dress.

00:00:54.379 --> 00:00:55.379
They need a lot of help.

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.670
And I know, for most of us guys, we don’t
want to go out and ask.

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:03.510
So I figure out in privacy of our own homes
we can simply watch this on YouTube, pick

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:08.280
up a lot of helpful tips and then you know,
go out there and start impressing, you know

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.250
the people that, you know, we need to, you
know, look better for a work.

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.400
In order to get the raise, in order to be
taken, you know, to be more credible.

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:20.810
Perhaps, go out and you know, be able to talk
with that special lady that you’ve been

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:23.350
wanting to talk with, you know, for years.

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:27.880
That’s why I’m looking to instill confidence
and to make you a better man.

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:32.010
It’s not so much about the clothing but
it’s having the confidence and the knowledge

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:36.100
to be able to express yourself through, you
know, through visuals.

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:37.100
Okay.

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:38.360
So quickly about me.

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:40.510
I founded the blog Real Men Real Style.

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:42.590
You can go to the link down over here below.

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.680
I’m also a custom clothier by trade.

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.650
So I own the company atailoredsuit.com.

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:52.040
I link to that occasionally, whenever I’ve
got an article that I want to share with you.

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:56.010
In addition, I’m a style writer, over at
the Art of Manliness.

00:01:56.010 --> 00:01:58.720
I link to that blog as well, great blog.

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.330
I highly advise you check it out.

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:03.640
And really, that’s what you’re going to
see.

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.820
I’m going to talk a lot about style.

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:10.411
And almost all of my videos, I’m going to
try to link to an article below so that you

00:02:10.411 --> 00:02:15.380
can go and not only, you know, if you want
to just scan through the text or if you want

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:19.642
to -- oftentimes I don’t say exactly what
I talk about in the article, I kind of take

00:02:19.642 --> 00:02:21.530
a little bit of a different approach on it.

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:23.730
So there’s a little bit of bonus material
there.

00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:25.730
And that’s really about it.

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:30.260

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.200
