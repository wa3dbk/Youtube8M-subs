00:00:12.307 --> 00:00:14.536
&gt;&gt; [male speaker] Mrs. Saunders?
&gt;&gt; [Mrs. Saunders] Yes?

00:00:15.674 --> 00:00:17.833
[male speaker]
Yes, what?

00:00:17.833 --> 00:00:20.291
&gt;&gt; [Mrs. Saunders] Yes, I am her.
&gt;&gt; [male speaker] Thank you.

00:00:20.291 --> 00:00:22.607
Say the whole thing, jeez.

00:00:22.607 --> 00:00:24.906
Well, the surgery was a success.

00:00:26.147 --> 00:00:28.721
We're lucky your husband got here
so quickly after the accident.

00:00:28.721 --> 00:00:33.063
We were able to stabilize him eventually,
but in order to save his life,

00:00:33.063 --> 00:00:35.914
I had to take his neck, okay?

00:00:35.914 --> 00:00:38.043
[Mrs. Saunders]
Okay? Okay?

00:00:38.043 --> 00:00:41.224
No, no, no, no—not okay.
I don't understand—he lost his neck?

00:00:41.224 --> 00:00:43.546
[male speaker]
Well, we didn't lose it.

00:00:43.546 --> 00:00:45.546
It's in the garbage.

00:00:45.546 --> 00:00:47.795
I'd show you, but it's probably got fries
on it by now.

00:00:47.795 --> 00:00:50.093
You know?

00:00:50.093 --> 00:00:53.460
[Mrs. Saunders]
I guess if this was some sort of last ditch effort

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:56.107
to save his life—
&gt;&gt; [male speaker] Yep. Yeah. Yeah.

00:00:56.107 --> 00:00:59.214
That's it. It was a last ditch thing
to save his life.

00:00:59.214 --> 00:01:03.997
What was had to do is we had to make
two very small, imperceptible incisions

00:01:03.997 --> 00:01:06.063
right here in the neck
so we could get in there

00:01:06.063 --> 00:01:09.105
with a power saw and just jam away
on that bad boy,

00:01:09.105 --> 00:01:11.752
then just dumped the sucker
in the trash.

00:01:11.752 --> 00:01:14.004
[Mrs. Saunders]
Oh, my God.

00:01:15.444 --> 00:01:17.552
&gt;&gt; [male speaker] Don't cry. .
&gt;&gt; [Mrs. Saunders] Okay, I'm going to—

00:01:17.552 --> 00:01:19.967
so when I see him,
he's not going to have a neck?

00:01:19.967 --> 00:01:21.987
[male speaker]
He'll be neckless. Completely neckless.

00:01:21.987 --> 00:01:25.888
You want to see the freak,
or what are we doing here?

00:01:25.888 --> 00:01:29.135
I shouldn't joke, I'm sorry.
Do you want to see your husband?

00:01:29.135 --> 00:01:31.135
[Mrs. Saunders]
Yeah, I'd like to see my husband.

00:01:31.135 --> 00:01:34.378
Danny!
&gt;&gt; [Danny] Hey, sweetie.

00:01:34.378 --> 00:01:36.672
&gt;&gt; [Mrs. Saunders] Are you okay?
&gt;&gt; [Danny] Sweetie.

00:01:36.672 --> 00:01:39.273
[male speaker]
He can walk, by the way. I didn't mess that up.

00:01:39.273 --> 00:01:42.570
[Danny]
Yeah, they said I should be wheeled out so I don't fall.

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:45.147
[male speaker]
It's a bit dramatic, isn't it?

00:01:45.147 --> 00:01:48.514
All right, let me tell you
about your new body here.

00:01:48.514 --> 00:01:51.346
It's going to take
some getting used to.

00:01:51.346 --> 00:01:54.346
First of all, we're lucky
that the shoulders aren't rejecting the head,

00:01:54.346 --> 00:01:59.798
so the head still has full access
to all this stuff right here—

00:01:59.798 --> 00:02:03.118
your chest, tummy, all the way down
to your big old hog,

00:02:03.118 --> 00:02:05.417
which works fine, by the way.

00:02:05.417 --> 00:02:08.528
Look at her, she's going,
"Thank you very much, Doccie."

00:02:08.528 --> 00:02:11.680
I'm going, "Don't thank me yet.
He can't munch your box anymore."

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.178
[Danny]
Oh, my God—okay, mostly I think

00:02:14.178 --> 00:02:16.916
we're just worried about—well,
I'm wondering if I can breathe—

00:02:16.916 --> 00:02:19.006
[male speaker]
Oh, you've got to tell the FBI

00:02:19.006 --> 00:02:22.187
about your new height
in case there's ever a manhunt for you.

00:02:22.187 --> 00:02:26.685
Snipers will be like, [pew] [whooshing sound]
I thought he was this tall.

00:02:26.685 --> 00:02:31.255
Other than that, my nurse, Kristi,
is going to give you some literature

00:02:31.255 --> 00:02:34.459
that should answer any other questions
you should have. Kristi!

00:02:34.459 --> 00:02:38.220
What are you doing back there?
I said you're not allowed back there.

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:40.643
&gt;&gt; [Kristi] I can go back there if I want to.
&gt;&gt; [male speaker] Fine.

00:02:40.643 --> 00:02:42.709
[Kristi]
Here you go—you're going to want to read this.

00:02:42.709 --> 00:02:45.519
[male speaker]
That's Kristi. I delivered her baby last year.

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:48.720
She almost didn't make it—
I had to rip her neck off to save her.

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.412
The baby, too.
&gt;&gt; [Kristi] But now she's a happy, healthy four-year-old.

00:02:52.412 --> 00:02:54.594
[male speaker]
Yep.

00:02:56.498 --> 00:02:58.890
[Mrs. Saunders]
Why do you have a picture of her in your waiting room?

00:03:01.514 --> 00:03:03.719
[male speaker]
It's covering up a safe.

00:03:06.691 --> 00:03:09.083
[Danny]
Well, I'm glad I'm alive, at least.

00:03:10.383 --> 00:03:12.519
[male speaker]
Random.

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:17.485
Yeah, you two lovebirds
got to get on out of here, okay?

00:03:17.485 --> 00:03:19.644
I'm up to my hog and balls
in paperwork.

00:03:19.644 --> 00:03:22.872
[Mrs. Saunders]
Do we come back for physical therapy?

00:03:22.872 --> 00:03:25.468
[male speaker]
Uh-uh. No, you don't ever come back here.

00:03:25.468 --> 00:03:30.135
You hear me? We're moving
at the end of the day today to a new space.

00:03:30.135 --> 00:03:34.477
Bigger. Big old dusty place.
It's got—hey.

00:03:34.477 --> 00:03:36.497
You just checked completely out.

00:03:38.981 --> 00:03:43.416
I say one thing about myself and it's just—
&gt;&gt; [Mrs. Saunders] Sorry, mister.

00:03:43.416 --> 00:03:45.645
[male speaker]
Ah, it's fine.

00:03:45.645 --> 00:03:47.804
Honestly, I'm starving, though.
You guys have got to go.

00:03:47.804 --> 00:03:50.289
I've got
another neck ripping off at five—

00:03:50.289 --> 00:03:54.208
or appendectomy, but I'm hoping
I'll have to rip his neck off.

00:03:56.205 --> 00:03:58.550
Some evenings.

00:04:02.007 --> 00:04:04.007
[Joanna]
