00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:12.160
I never wanted to be a missionary. That I was sure of.

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:15.759
So we're getting ready to get on the plane. We're headed to DRC to

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:18.420
cover some work.

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:20.859
And Africa? Never.

00:00:20.859 --> 00:00:25.830
We are crossing a bridge. We are in Congo, and

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.329
we're on a ten-hour

00:00:27.329 --> 00:00:30.339
ride, drive to a village.

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:34.249
Two different missions experiences, through
short term trips, I realized that the

00:00:34.249 --> 00:00:36.020
Lord had been

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:37.470
gently nudging me

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:39.550
to go overseas.

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:41.220
I always

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:45.860
was happy to be the one to send and
pray and give money for others to go, but

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:52.860
I never, ever thought that I would be a missionary.

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.420
I work in the public relations
department so we relate to government

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:04.360
officials to different ministries in Cameroon.

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:06.480
I do like the diversity in the work I do

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:08.560
because I get to relate to

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:09.410
not only

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:12.340
my ex-pat colleagues and other
missionaries,

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:18.080
Favian and I have worked together for almost
two years. This is us.

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:21.700
but also to nationals on a daily basis.
That's just a lot of fun.

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.980
I like seeing people

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.750
express their culture.

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:40.840
one of the things that we're doing here
in Cameroon is promoting multilingual 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:41.910
education.

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:43.910
The importance of

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:46.560
educating children in their mother tongue

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.439
and later transitioning them into the
national language.

00:01:50.439 --> 00:01:55.140
We're here working on a documentary
for multilingual education,

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.040
and so we're visiting some of the schools
and interviewing

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.300
teachers and the director.

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:03.330
Today is a special day for the mother tongue.

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:06.710
So it's nice to get out into the village. We're about seven hours away from the city.

00:02:10.949 --> 00:02:14.249
So we're just kind of like the torch
bearers on certain things.

00:02:14.249 --> 00:02:15.749
We just go out there and kind of

00:02:15.749 --> 00:02:19.470
talk. Once again, we've talked to you before
about this issue or that issue, or

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:21.180
this policy or that policy.

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:25.229
And so we just go out there and communicate
constantly.

00:02:25.229 --> 00:02:29.139
Just recently I had the opportunity to
travel with a team of people and

00:02:29.139 --> 00:02:32.679
interview a few of the folks whose lives
have been changed as a result of hearing

00:02:32.679 --> 00:02:35.829
God's Word in their heart language. There
was a young girl who had been

00:02:35.829 --> 00:02:38.579
a prostitute. There was another lady who's 

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:39.790
my age and

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:43.339
had been doing witchcraft for a number of
years,

00:02:43.339 --> 00:02:45.369
and that

00:02:45.369 --> 00:02:47.229
was just kind of like, wow.

00:02:47.229 --> 00:02:48.389
We're doing this

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:50.580
because it does change people's lives.

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:57.879
The main reasons that I didn't want to go
overseas or raise support is because 

00:02:57.879 --> 00:03:02.709
I was so used to being independent and
providing for myself, and

00:03:02.709 --> 00:03:04.029
serving

00:03:04.029 --> 00:03:06.029
overseas you really have to

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:08.520
commit to a journey of faith

00:03:08.529 --> 00:03:11.049
and to know that every day God

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:12.669
will provide

00:03:12.669 --> 00:03:14.639
for everything you need.

00:03:14.639 --> 00:03:16.289
And you

00:03:16.289 --> 00:03:21.839
watch God work in a different way and manifest himself as your God in a way that

00:03:21.839 --> 00:03:26.109
you've never had to before because you
never trusted him for that.

00:03:26.109 --> 00:03:32.169
Perhaps you're not gonna come to Africa to learn these things. Your experience will be through

00:03:32.169 --> 00:03:36.009
other situations that the Lord,
and challenges that the Lord brings to your life,

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:39.300
but for me, I'm learning this in Africa.
