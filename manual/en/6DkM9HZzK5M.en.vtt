00:01:41.841 --> 00:01:44.090
our tomato sauce on the baguette ok?

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:51.280
You're gonna spoon this and put it on the

00:01:51.280 --> 00:02:01.170
go yes so get your sauce on there i'll close
up right now smear it all round mate.

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:07.170
Good girl yes so she's doing it herself now
she knows what she is doing yep she doesn't

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:08.259
even need me doing anything.

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:16.659
Look at this she is in the zone now is that
fun are you gonna smile yeah good times so

00:02:16.659 --> 00:02:20.239
she's getting that all over there I won't
show everyone so we've got to do 2 more and

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:22.580
then she gets to top it.

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:24.180
Me, yeah you!

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.620
Alright folks because I didn't want it to
get too messy i've put the pizza breads on

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:33.120
a new board and given it a bit of a clean
up because the rest is clean steps so she's

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:45.200
just grabbing what's this shes just grabbing
the chicken and plonking it on the bread like

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.940
so there's no real strategy to where she's
putting it, random you may call it.

00:02:48.940 --> 00:02:56.741
Dont you dare, no put it back she was gonna
whack that in her mouth then what are you

00:02:56.741 --> 00:02:59.970
doing? you don't know do you no?

00:02:59.970 --> 00:03:00.970

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:19.890
What are you doing you look like you have
some sort of tomato nail varnish on.

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:29.599
Oi nice try mate put it back on the pizza
she can eat it and all that it's getting a

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:34.400
bit cold she will eat anything could have
put anchovies on it and she would have eaten

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:35.400
it.

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.329
Right Chloe next up do you know what you are
gonna put on next?

00:03:38.329 --> 00:03:40.310
Put pepper on!

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:46.709
All she's doing now is eating the chicken
off the pizzas right mate this is pepper can

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:55.310
you put some of that on there? put that on
the pizza no?

00:03:55.310 --> 00:04:01.409
ok she's not quite grasping the idea of making
the pizza she just wants to lick the sauce

00:04:01.409 --> 00:04:05.790
off and once the sauce is off she just wants
to eat the chicken come on mate i've just

00:04:05.790 --> 00:04:16.079

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:29.040
