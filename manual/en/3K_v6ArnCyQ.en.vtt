00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.840
We're about to shoot the FIRST scene of the day!

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:04.400
And it is with...

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:06.360
A bunch of nuts.

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:09.600
Literally.

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:11.760
Don't look at my nuts.

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:13.760
Hey Marley!

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:16.020
Maaaaaarrrleeeeyyy

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:17.680
Heeeeyy

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:53.800
Oh my god! What was... Was that a tooth?

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:58.940
It looked like a tooth!

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:01.140
It was under my tongue

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:03.740
Basically... We were supposed to film outside but we cant

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:05.660
So now we have to film all our nighttime shots

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:06.600
but its not night time yet...

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:07.740
SO...

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:10.060
We're.. gonna... eat some stuff.

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.080
Firstly we were gonna do the saltine challenge

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:14.040
But I don't think this enough for everyone.

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:15.300
Does anyone know what that is?

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:16.780
It says in 60 seconds that...

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:19.100
You try to eat 6 saltine crackers...

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:20.620
Without drinking anything.

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:22.500
6 saltine crackers

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:23.840
In 60 seconds

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:25.680
Without drinking any water.

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.180
I think I could do that.

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:29.580
60 seconds? Thats a long time!

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:32.800
Uhhh... So we have to set an alarm for, is it 1 minute?

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:34.360
Uh, 60 seconds, yeah 1 minute.

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:35.620
60 SECONDS!?

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.500
What should I put as the alarm?

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:38.480
We could set it as this...

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:40.620
*Loud beeping alarm*

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:42.880
This ones like...

00:01:42.960 --> 00:01:44.440
FINISH YOUR CRACKERS!

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:46.600
We should have something really nice, like...

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.560
*Soothing guitar* You guys did it, we all did it.

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:51.840
But what if we, don't... finish... it...

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.560
Then we'll switch it back to....

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:55.680
I like the happy one.

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:56.880
Alright, lets do the happy.

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:58.520
Alright ready? 1...

00:01:58.560 --> 00:01:59.580
I made a house

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:00.460
Ready?

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:05.160
1,2,3 GO!

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:15.340
Its so dry!

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.760
ITS IMPOSSIBLE!

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:25.940
10 SECONDS!

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:34.540
*Soothing guitar alarm*

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.720
I don't know what you guys are complaining about, I ate all of mine...

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:38.580
You did  ?!

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:41.380
Dude, I swallowed it all!

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:43.580
Look how many you did, Derrick!

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:45.580
They taste pretty damn good, what can I say.

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:46.240
We're here at...

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:50.340
ðŸŽµ Party cityyyyy ðŸŽµ

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:51.040
I like these yellow things

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:56.980
Usually its a slidey thing, and uh...

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:59.100
You're a little noisy there.

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:00.780
What are you, some kinda... duck?

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:03.880
And we are... back!

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:37.800
Oh, did you see that?

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:47.300
Your cheeks jiggle so much.

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:54.880
Yeah, Shaun definitely like to, shake his cheeks a lot.

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:57.280
Yeah, I do like to shake my cheeks...

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:58.760
And they do jiggle.

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:00.060
A lot.

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:07.440
So scary!

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:37.940
Hey, why you got anger issues, bro?

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:40.120
Well, I mean...

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:42.120
Im just so nice all the other times and...

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:44.420
It just builds up. And I try to hold it in.

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:10.880
You wanna say bye?

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:13.660
Aw, he's waving! He's waving!

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:15.220
Byyyee!
