00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.550
 

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:09.820
Jmac: If you own a '94 to
'98 Mustang and your odometer's

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:12.800
quit working, more than
likely, it's this set of gears

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:13.700
right here.

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:15.660
Luckily, we've got you
covered with a brand

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.690
new odometer gear
repair kit t that's

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:20.629
made right here in the USA and
features a lifetime warranty.

00:00:20.629 --> 00:00:22.420
Now we're going to show
you how to put this

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:25.440
in on this '97 Mustang GT.

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:28.720
First off, you want to grab you
a nut driver with a T20 Torx

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.660
Bit and remove the two screws
at the top of your instrument

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:32.470
cluster bezel.

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:53.010
 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:56.730
Then, you want to grab you a
small flat-blade screwdriver,

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:01.010
pull out on your headlight
knob, and in the little recess

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.769
or the cut out spot, you'll
see a little metal tab.

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.710
You'll want to engage
that screwdriver just

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:10.150
behind that metal tab and
apply light pressure to it

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:12.490
while pulling out on
the knob, and the knob

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:16.030
will pull off of the
headlight switch.

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:19.220
Now you can go ahead
and pop off your bezel.

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:21.780
Just pull out on it and it
will come away from the dash.

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:24.640
 

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:26.630
And then you have access
to the four screws

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:30.510
that hold on the instrument
cluster to the dash,

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:33.408
and those also take
a T20 Torx Bit.

00:01:33.408 --> 00:01:43.370
 

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:46.180
Be careful not to drop
these screws into the dash,

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:49.580
because then you may have to go
on a little hunting expedition

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:52.320
to find them.

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:53.940
Sometimes a little
pocket magnet will

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:55.430
help to fish them
out of the hole.

00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:35.040
 

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:39.040
Then, you can grab hold
of your instrument cluster

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.545
and slide it out of the dash.

00:02:40.545 --> 00:02:45.480
 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.390
And you've got an
electrical connector

00:02:47.390 --> 00:02:52.230
on each side, has one
single-release tab at the top.

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:55.510
You can pull that and
then rotate it around,

00:02:55.510 --> 00:02:58.770
and you can unplug the other
side single-release tab

00:02:58.770 --> 00:02:59.492
at the top.

00:02:59.492 --> 00:03:06.270
 

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:07.874
And now, we can go
over to the bench,

00:03:07.874 --> 00:03:09.790
and I'll show you how
to put that new odometer

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:12.519
gear set into your
instrument cluster.

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:14.310
Now that you've got
your instrument cluster

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:16.290
out and on a
workbench, you're going

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:20.210
to want to grab you either a
T15 Torx Bit or a 5 and 1/2

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:23.580
millimeter socket to remove
these small screws all

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:26.507
the way around your
instrument cluster's lens.

00:03:26.507 --> 00:03:28.340
Then you can go ahead
and pop all these out.

00:03:28.340 --> 00:04:01.950
 

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:04.850
Then you can pick up
on the cluster lens

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:07.480
and just set it out of the way.

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:12.450
Now you've got one more
T15 or 5 and 1/2 millimeter

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:17.510
screw right down here at the
bottom below the speedometer.

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:19.015
Get it out of the way.

00:04:19.015 --> 00:04:20.390
Then you're going
to want to grab

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:22.480
you a small
flat-blade screwdriver

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:30.470
and pry up on your oil
pressure and charge gauge.

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:33.980
And then come over to the
other side for your fuel level

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:35.900
and engine temp.

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:37.320
Just pry up slightly.

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:40.920
 

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:44.720
And then you can grab hold of
your speedometer and tachometer

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:48.070
and lift straight up.

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:50.960
Basically, what you're doing
is disengaging those pins

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:55.630
out of the back of the
instrument cluster housing.

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:58.210
Now you can flip
your speedometer,

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:03.990
tachometer assembly
over and actually twist,

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:06.650
and sometimes you may
have to grab a flat blade

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:08.075
screwdriver to help you out.

00:05:08.075 --> 00:05:11.330
 

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:13.600
Twist the little
motor there out.

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:19.530
And then there's your worm gear,
which this worm gear is broken.

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:23.310
And then on your drive
gear, or your driven gear

00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:26.330
here, the shaft on it is broken.

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:28.900
So that's why this
odometer wasn't working.

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:31.650
You can take your
flat-blade screwdriver

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:38.700
and pry out the old gear and
then pry out the remnants.

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:42.591
 

00:05:42.591 --> 00:05:44.590
And typically, there's a
little grease in there,

00:05:44.590 --> 00:05:48.130
so that'll help it stick
to your screwdriver.

00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:49.640
And if not, you
can just dump over

00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:55.680
the assembly to get
the remnants out.

00:05:55.680 --> 00:06:01.602
Now on this, we're going to take
a needle-nose pair of pliers

00:06:01.602 --> 00:06:06.120
and pry off-- well, that
just kind of broke apart.

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:09.830
Yours will probably do about
the same, maybe even worse.

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:15.010
And kind of wipe off
some of that junk.

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:18.910
All right, now you
take your new worm gear

00:06:18.910 --> 00:06:22.140
and engage it onto the
shaft of the motor.

00:06:22.140 --> 00:06:25.310
It's going to be a very tight
fit, so don't be surprised

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:27.290
if it takes a little
bit of effort.

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:31.384
Now I press it down
almost all the way,

00:06:31.384 --> 00:06:32.800
and then I get to
a point to where

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:36.970
I can stick my thumbnail on
the bottom side of that gear,

00:06:36.970 --> 00:06:41.190
and finish pressing down until
I feel a little bit of tension

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:43.540
against the base of that motor.

00:06:43.540 --> 00:06:46.030
That way, I've got a
little bit of air gap,

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:47.870
and that's a little
bit too much.

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:49.330
You basically just
want the width

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:56.570
of a fingernail air gap
between that worm gear

00:06:56.570 --> 00:06:58.580
and the base of the motor.

00:06:58.580 --> 00:07:02.460
Then you can grab
your driven gear

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:06.010
and just snap it into place.

00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:11.990
Make sure it is slid all
the way over to the right.

00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:15.330
Then you can take
your motor assembly

00:07:15.330 --> 00:07:16.830
and twist it back into place.

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:20.410
And now, you can go ahead,
slide everything back together

00:07:20.410 --> 00:07:23.100
into the housing, and then
reinstall your instrument

00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:26.410
cluster into your car and
enjoy your new working odometer

00:07:26.410 --> 00:07:28.040
and trip odometer.

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:30.180
