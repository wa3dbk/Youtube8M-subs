00:00:00.567 --> 00:00:06.367
The President:
Well, Michelle and I are just thrilled to be part of this

00:00:06.367 --> 00:00:08.300
spectacular evening.

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:14.266
To the performers who lent their
voices to this celebration, to

00:00:14.266 --> 00:00:18.500
the honored guests, to everyone
who helped make tonight

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.200
such a success, I want
to say thank you.

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:25.066
I also want to thank the staff
and supporters of Ford's Theatre

00:00:25.066 --> 00:00:27.967
for creating a place where
education and the arts can

00:00:27.967 --> 00:00:33.133
thrive, and where the legacy of
our nation's greatest President

00:00:33.133 --> 00:00:35.500
will be preserved
for generations.

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.133
And I especially want to thank
the members of one of our

00:00:39.133 --> 00:00:45.166
nation's most hallowed
fraternities -- the men who were

00:00:45.166 --> 00:00:47.266
recipients of the
Medal of Honor.

00:00:47.266 --> 00:00:49.133
Please give them another
round of applause.

00:00:49.133 --> 00:01:03.500
(applause)

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:07.800
To each of those men, I want
you to know your heroism is unquestioned.

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.300
Your stories are inspirational.

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:14.033
Your actions above and beyond
the call of duty have earned the

00:01:14.033 --> 00:01:16.066
admiration of a grateful nation.

00:01:16.066 --> 00:01:19.967
And we are incredibly honored
that you could join us here tonight.

00:01:19.967 --> 00:01:27.166
(applause)

00:01:27.166 --> 00:01:30.500
It's that kind of heroism that
has always defined what this

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.333
nation is all about.

00:01:32.333 --> 00:01:36.767
After all, it was exactly 234
years ago that a group of

00:01:36.767 --> 00:01:41.867
patriots -- farmers and
merchants, lawyers, physicians

00:01:41.867 --> 00:01:46.667
-- pledged their lives, their
fortunes, and their sacred honor

00:01:46.667 --> 00:01:50.867
to an improbable
experiment called America.

00:01:50.867 --> 00:01:55.066
They risked everything in the
name of a few simple ideas --

00:01:55.066 --> 00:02:02.033
freedom, equality and the right
to pursue our full measure of happiness.

00:02:02.033 --> 00:02:05.567
And even though the odds of
success were not great, even

00:02:05.567 --> 00:02:09.633
though they were opposed by
a powerful and far-reaching

00:02:09.633 --> 00:02:14.300
empire, these framers had the
courage to take the first steps

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.200
towards what would become the
greatest democracy that the

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.000
world has ever known.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.133
It was a spirit that would echo
through time and space: to an

00:02:23.133 --> 00:02:27.767
Illinois rail-splitter who vowed
that a government of the people,

00:02:27.767 --> 00:02:32.333
by the people, and for the
people shall not perish from the Earth.

00:02:32.333 --> 00:02:36.500
To a young preacher who believed
that, even if he didn't get

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.633
there with us, we would
reach the Promised Land.

00:02:40.633 --> 00:02:44.166
And across an ocean, to
generations of South Africans

00:02:44.166 --> 00:02:48.934
who rose up in search of the
same inalienable rights that had

00:02:48.934 --> 00:02:52.767
been put to paper in this
country so many years ago.

00:02:52.767 --> 00:02:56.300
As a lawyer fighting for the
rights of black South Africans

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:00.233
in the age of apartheid, Albie
Sachs was thrown in jail without

00:03:00.233 --> 00:03:05.033
charge, and was nearly killed
when a bomb took part of his arm

00:03:05.033 --> 00:03:08.700
and the sight of one eye.

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:12.734
Despite that fact, Albie knew
he was part of something bigger

00:03:12.734 --> 00:03:15.433
than himself, and after
returning from exile, he helped

00:03:15.433 --> 00:03:19.133
shape South Africa's
constitution, and held a spot on

00:03:19.133 --> 00:03:22.767
his nation's Constitutional
Court for 15 years.

00:03:22.767 --> 00:03:26.033
Then there's Archbishop
Desmond Tutu.

00:03:26.033 --> 00:03:30.467
As a crusader for freedom, a
spiritual leader, and chair of

00:03:30.467 --> 00:03:33.567
the Truth and Reconciliation
Commission, and a respected

00:03:33.567 --> 00:03:37.967
statesman, he has become a
symbol of kindness and hope far

00:03:37.967 --> 00:03:41.033
beyond the borders
of his native land.

00:03:41.033 --> 00:03:44.333
Through it all, he has been
guided by the belief that, in

00:03:44.333 --> 00:03:51.967
his words, "My humanity is bound
up in yours, and we can only be human together."

00:03:51.967 --> 00:03:55.667
There are few people more
deserving of the Lincoln Medal

00:03:55.667 --> 00:04:00.266
-- an honor bestowed on those
who exemplify the singular focus,

00:04:00.266 --> 00:04:05.066
dedication, and generosity of spirit of our 16th President.

00:04:05.066 --> 00:04:08.834
And as we celebrate Independence
Day, there are few better

00:04:08.834 --> 00:04:11.800
examples of how the spirit of
our Founding Founders did more

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:15.867
than just create a nation -- it
inspired people in every

00:04:15.867 --> 00:04:19.467
corner of the globe
yearning to be free.

00:04:19.467 --> 00:04:23.500
So I want to congratulate
tonight's honorees, and I thank

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:27.767
all of you for being part of
this extraordinary celebration.

00:04:27.767 --> 00:04:30.500
We thank all the talent
who performed here today.

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:33.967
We thank all the supporters
of the Ford's Theatre.

00:04:33.967 --> 00:04:37.333
God bless you, and God bless
the United States of America.

00:04:37.333 --> 00:04:42.266
(applause)
