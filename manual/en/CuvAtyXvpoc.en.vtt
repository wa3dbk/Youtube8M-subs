00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.090
[aircraft sound]

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.140
We are currently on our mission down to Pine Island Glacier in west Antarctica 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.190
and we will be flying about a 3 hour survey there over the glacier.

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.250
Pine Island Glacier losing ice very quickly

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:20.290
about 6 meters per year and today we will go back and re-fly

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:24.380
the same mission that we have flown two years earlier in 2009.

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:28.440
And we can compare the data that we collect today to our previous data

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:32.480
and also to the data of the ICESat satellite that has collected

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:36.530
surface elevation measurements there over many years. And this will tell us

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:40.620
how much ice is being lost in west Antarctica

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.700
and contributes to sea level rise.

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:48.760
Two weeks ago we had another mission over Pine Island Glacier 

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.780
and when looking out of the window of the aircraft we noticed

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:56.820
a fairly large crack in the ice shelf.

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:00.910
And I talked back to colleagues in the U.S. that downloaded satellite images 

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.960
and they reported that this crack has formed in sometime between 

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:08.980
end of September or early October.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.020
These things happen on a semi-regular basis in both the Arctic and the Antarctic,

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:17.140
but itâ€™s still a fairly large event. 

00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:21.150
So we wanted to make sure we captured as much of that process as we could.

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:25.170
So today was our first trip to be back in the area and what we do is we modified the existing flight plan

00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:29.280
to add another half hour to the flight in order to catch a flight along the

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:33.350
direction of the rift, in order to get mainly a lidar and photographic map of

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:37.410
the shape, depth of the rift, and the width of it -- see how it's developing over time.

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:41.440
At the moment the crack is about 80 meters wide.

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:45.490
If it continues to propagate, it's about an iceberg that ice the area of 800 square kilometers

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:49.520
that eventually will break off from the 

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:53.590
Pine Island Glacier.

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.720
Now if we're lucky, we may get another chance to come back to this area later, if weather and

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.890
timing permits, to do what we just did today to see how the rift has further developed as time goes on.

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:05.930
A lot of times when you're in science you

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:10.060
don't get a chance to catch the big stories as they happen because you're

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.130
not there at the right time, but this time we were.

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:18.160
These are discreet processes in time, they take place over a period of just a few weeks

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:25.930
and we just happened to be here at the right time to catch it.
