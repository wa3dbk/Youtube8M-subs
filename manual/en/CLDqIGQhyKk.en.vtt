00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:04.180
Today, I'm going to show you an easy way
to get the horseshoe mustache you want.

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:06.510
It's a mustache with
long, downward-facing bars

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:09.520
that form an upside U. You'll
basically need a tool that

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:12.760
does three things--
trim, shape, and edge.

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:13.980
I use this one.

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.620
It's the Styler from Gillette.

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:17.350
And it's really a three-in-one shaver.

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:18.990
Good for any mustache or beard.

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.160
It comes with three combs
of different lengths--

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:23.632
2 millimeter, 4 millimeter,
and 6 millimeter--

00:00:23.632 --> 00:00:25.840
so you can decide how long
you want your beard to be.

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:28.350
Remove the combs and
I have this trimmer.

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:31.819
For a closer shave and definition,
I use the blade attachment.

00:00:31.819 --> 00:00:34.110
If you flip over the razor,
you'll see the single blade

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.777
on the back, which you can use
at the end to finish the details.

00:00:36.777 --> 00:00:39.734
So basically, you have everything
you need to shave the beard you want.

00:00:39.734 --> 00:00:41.060
It's a great three-in-one tool.

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:42.430
Let's get started.

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:45.850
I've let my beard grow for a few days
until it's about half an inch long.

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:48.040
This gives me a good base to work from.

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:51.280
I first attach the comb to
trim all of my beard and neck.

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:53.630
This evens the length
of my beard throughout.

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:56.807
I remove the comb from my razor and
rinse any excess hair from the trimmer.

00:00:56.807 --> 00:00:59.640
Loose hairs in the trimmer can get
in the way of it cutting new hair

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:02.650
and cause uncomfortable tugging.

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:05.410
Once my trimmer is free of
hair, I use only the trimmer

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:07.660
to outline the shape of
my horseshoe mustache.

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:09.090
I do this in two steps.

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:10.200
First, I trim my neck.

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:14.390
Then I take extra care to go slowly
as I trim my cheeks and chin,

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:17.440
leaving my mustache in finger-width
strips and bars of hair

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:19.407
from the corners of my mouth to my jaw.

00:01:19.407 --> 00:01:21.240
After outlining the
look I want and checking

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:24.870
the symmetry of my horseshoe mustache
I still need to add definition.

00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:26.240
I do this in two ways.

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.490
One, closely shaving my
chin, cheeks, and neck.

00:01:29.490 --> 00:01:32.090
And two, tightening the lines
and edges of my mustache.

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:34.350
After I finished shaping my
mustache with my trimmer,

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:36.220
I shave the rest of my face clean.

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:39.250
Before I start with a close
shave I always prepare the skin.

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:42.110
First, I wash the area to be
shaved with a facial scrub.

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:45.640
It cleans away any oil, dirt, or dead
skin that can block the razor's path

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:47.410
and prevent a smooth glide.

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:49.440
Then I rinse the scrub off my face.

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:52.530
You can further hydrate your hair by
splashing your face with warm water,

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.750
or by soaking a towel with
warm water and holding it

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.770
against your skin for
up to three minutes.

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:58.520
Doing this really
reduces the force you'll

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.930
need to shave because it softens
your hair and makes it easier to cut.

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:05.789
Third, I coat the skin of my neck
and cheeks using a clear shave gel.

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:07.580
A white shaving foam
makes it harder to see

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:10.180
the lines and edges of your
mustache so it's a good idea

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:11.299
to use a clear shave gel.

00:02:11.299 --> 00:02:13.090
I also like to use
shave gels like this one

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:15.890
because they tend to have
more glide than shave foams.

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:17.340
Now I'm ready for a closer shave.

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:18.840
Let's attach the blade to the razor.

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.490
Now, let's start shaving.

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:22.240
Many guys prefer to
shave in the direction

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:24.450
that the hair grows,
meaning with the grain

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:27.460
and then following up with
strokes in the opposite direction.

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:30.180
However, since facial hair tends
to grow in different directions,

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:33.664
you'll almost always be shaving
both with and against the grain.

00:02:33.664 --> 00:02:36.330
A razor like this one will help
you get a comfortable shave even

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:37.085
against the grain.

00:02:37.085 --> 00:02:39.960
So as long as you're using light
strokes and reapplying shaving cream

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:41.850
before you go back over
with your razor, you

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:43.660
should shave in the direction
you're most comfortable with.

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:45.790
I save the sensitive
area on my neck for last

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:49.726
to allow the shave gel more
time to soften the hairs.

00:02:49.726 --> 00:02:51.600
Every few strokes I
rinse my blade with water

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.980
to keep it clear of
any gel or loose hairs

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:55.780
that way nothing blocks
the razor's path.

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:59.200
Before finishing with my razor,
I still have one final step--

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.300
tightening the outer edges
of my horseshoe mustache.

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:04.160
I find that the easiest
and most precise way

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.910
to do this is by using
a single-blade razor.

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:08.930
The Styler I use has one on the back.

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:11.470
So I simply turn my
razor over and finish

00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:14.560
defining the lines around the
top and sides of my stache.

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.610
To get clean edges, I turn my
blade parallel to the hairline

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:22.491
and use short, light strokes
to cut away from the mustache.

00:03:22.491 --> 00:03:24.740
All I have left to do is
rinse my face with cold water

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:27.470
and apply a moisturizing
aftershave lotion.

00:03:27.470 --> 00:03:30.934
The lotion rehydrates my skin
and leaves it soft and smooth.

00:03:30.934 --> 00:03:31.850
And there you have it.

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:34.430
A horseshoe mustache.

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:36.600
Just remember these easy steps.

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:37.720
Trim your beard.

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:39.060
Shape your mustache.

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:41.990
Prepare your skin.

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:43.500
Add definition by shaving.

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:44.780
Tighten the edges.

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:45.900
And moisturize your skin.

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:50.230
Thanks for watching.

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:53.910
