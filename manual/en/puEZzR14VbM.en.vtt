00:00:01.208 --> 00:00:03.667
Narrator: Can what cities
do locally really move

00:00:03.667 --> 00:00:06.792
the dial toward national
sustainability?

00:00:06.792 --> 00:00:09.417
Portland, Oregon,
shows what's possible.

00:00:11.417 --> 00:00:14.167
70% of all the oil consumed
in America

00:00:14.167 --> 00:00:17.042
is used for transportation.

00:00:17.042 --> 00:00:19.833
But congestion wastes
a huge amount,

00:00:19.833 --> 00:00:24.583
perhaps 16% of all the oil
imported from the Persian Gulf.

00:00:24.583 --> 00:00:26.417
Despite our best efforts,
we are still

00:00:26.417 --> 00:00:29.292
taking 10% of the world's
petroleum supply

00:00:29.292 --> 00:00:32.667
just to get back and forth
to work every day.

00:00:32.667 --> 00:00:34.250
Narrator:
Congressman Earl Blumenauer

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:37.375
represents Oregon's third
district, including Portland.

00:00:37.375 --> 00:00:40.500
He heads up the Congressional
bike caucus.

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:45.000
And his city started finding
solutions some 30 years back.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.333
You know, one of the things
we did was,

00:00:46.333 --> 00:00:48.750
we have an urban growth
boundary, and what that is,

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:51.250
is a ring around
the city of Portland

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:53.708
and its surrounding suburbs,
so that we cannot

00:00:53.708 --> 00:00:56.417
kind of sprawl out and we can't
become Los Angeles.

00:00:56.417 --> 00:00:58.833
Narrator:
Between 1950 and 1990,

00:00:58.833 --> 00:01:02.042
America's urban population
grew by 90%.

00:01:02.042 --> 00:01:06.583
But cities' land area
grew more than 250%.

00:01:06.583 --> 00:01:09.708
Remarkably, Portland bucked
that trend of urban sprawl.

00:01:09.708 --> 00:01:13.500
Key decisions made include
a move from investment

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.208
in freeways into transit
and also to integrate

00:01:18.208 --> 00:01:20.667
transit planning
with land use planning.

00:01:22.208 --> 00:01:24.208
Narrator: Along
with region-wide thinking,

00:01:24.208 --> 00:01:25.667
Portland now has
an infrastructure

00:01:25.667 --> 00:01:29.083
that emphasizes mass transit,
along with something

00:01:29.083 --> 00:01:31.833
this city pioneered
in the 19th century...

00:01:33.083 --> 00:01:34.458
bicycles.

00:01:36.208 --> 00:01:38.542
It may be easy to parody
Portland's love affair

00:01:38.542 --> 00:01:42.292
with all things green including
the cycling community.

00:01:42.292 --> 00:01:45.333
But putting bikes to work
has practical advantages

00:01:45.333 --> 00:01:46.917
if they can be made
into something used

00:01:46.917 --> 00:01:50.458
for more than pure recreation.

00:01:50.458 --> 00:01:53.833
That's the purpose of what's
called the Oregon Manifest,

00:01:53.833 --> 00:01:56.958
a design challenge to come up
with clever and practical ways

00:01:56.958 --> 00:02:00.583
to transport packages
as well as people.

00:02:00.583 --> 00:02:02.083
A decade ago
it was hard to find

00:02:02.083 --> 00:02:04.542
a bike that was not
a racing bike

00:02:04.542 --> 00:02:06.375
or a mountain bike
or a touring bike.

00:02:06.375 --> 00:02:08.958
Now any bike shop
that you walk into,

00:02:08.958 --> 00:02:12.375
in the city of Portland anyway,
you'll find city bikes,

00:02:12.375 --> 00:02:16.250
bikes that are really made
for commuting to and from work,

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.208
from riding to the park
to the grocery store.

00:02:20.208 --> 00:02:21.542
Narrator:
Half of U.S. car trips

00:02:21.542 --> 00:02:24.208
cover less than 10 miles,
and short trips

00:02:24.208 --> 00:02:26.042
where engines make
a cold start

00:02:26.042 --> 00:02:29.792
are the most gasoline
intensive and polluting.

00:02:29.792 --> 00:02:32.625
So if city bikes like these
became mass-produced

00:02:32.625 --> 00:02:35.750
and popular and if every one
of the nation's

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:38.042
more than
100,000,000 households

00:02:38.042 --> 00:02:40.917
substituted one 5-mile trip
each day,

00:02:40.917 --> 00:02:46.542
the nation would save
$36.5 billion on gasoline.

00:02:46.542 --> 00:02:49.083
Already one young entrepreneur
has put Portland's

00:02:49.083 --> 00:02:51.792
non-polluting pedal power
to work

00:02:51.792 --> 00:02:54.500
and made a business of it.

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:58.125
We use these large
tricycle trucks to deliver

00:02:58.125 --> 00:03:02.875
products into a two mile radius
of the urban core for Portland.

00:03:02.875 --> 00:03:05.208
We deliver everything
from bread and produce

00:03:05.208 --> 00:03:08.583
to office products to water
to cycle parts.

00:03:08.583 --> 00:03:11.083
Each trike can carry
about 800 pounds.

00:03:11.083 --> 00:03:12.708
They're all electric-assisted.

00:03:12.708 --> 00:03:16.542
So it's a hybrid human
and electric power.

00:03:16.542 --> 00:03:18.000
The less congestion we have,

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.292
our goods and services
move faster.

00:03:20.292 --> 00:03:21.958
We're an international
global city.

00:03:21.958 --> 00:03:24.208
We have to be scrappy,
so bicyclists

00:03:24.208 --> 00:03:26.292
are about reducing congestion.

00:03:26.292 --> 00:03:28.042
Over the past 2 1/2 years
we've helped

00:03:28.042 --> 00:03:32.583
displace over 25,000 truck
or van-based deliveries.

00:03:32.583 --> 00:03:35.167
And when you start to look
at the overall greenhouse gas

00:03:35.167 --> 00:03:39.417
reduction and avoidance,
day by day it's not very much,

00:03:39.417 --> 00:03:42.375
but cumulatively it really
starts to stack up.

00:03:42.375 --> 00:03:46.000
Narrator: Cycling may be an
outward and very visible sign

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.583
of a transition away from cars,
but the region's

00:03:48.583 --> 00:03:52.625
mass transit network also has
serious numbers.

00:03:52.625 --> 00:03:54.583
We have been electrifying

00:03:54.583 --> 00:03:57.000
our transportation
for 30 years here.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:02.708
And today there's literally
about 150,000 boardings per day.

00:04:02.708 --> 00:04:05.292
And that means that people who
otherwise might be traveling

00:04:05.292 --> 00:04:09.042
around in cars are traveling
around in electrons.

00:04:09.042 --> 00:04:12.083
As a result of how
we put the pieces together

00:04:12.083 --> 00:04:16.417
in Portland over the last
1/3 of a century, Portlanders

00:04:16.417 --> 00:04:21.625
voluntarily drive 20% less
than the national average.

00:04:21.625 --> 00:04:24.917
This translates
into a dollar savings

00:04:24.917 --> 00:04:26.875
for the typical household

00:04:26.875 --> 00:04:30.958
of more than $2,500 a year.

00:04:30.958 --> 00:04:34.000
And that's money that stays
in our community.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:39.542
It is not going to Houston or
Saudi Arabia, Japan or Germany.

00:04:39.542 --> 00:04:42.625
Narrator: Portland's leaders
talk about the trip not taken

00:04:42.625 --> 00:04:47.042
as something that saves money
and benefits the environment.

00:04:47.042 --> 00:04:49.833
Currently more than a quarter 
of Portland's workforce

00:04:49.833 --> 00:04:54.125
commutes by bike, carpool
or mass transit.

00:04:54.125 --> 00:04:56.542
But planners are working
on the next giant step

00:04:56.542 --> 00:05:00.250
in low carbon transportation,
electric vehicles.

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:03.625
I think we get to the point
where electric

00:05:03.625 --> 00:05:06.500
vehicles will be able to do,
you know, 98% of the personal

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:09.333
transportation needs,
and of course that's mainly

00:05:09.333 --> 00:05:11.000
in the cities and the suburbs.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.083
Narrator: An average
Portlander's daily commute

00:05:13.083 --> 00:05:15.333
of 20 miles
could easily be powered

00:05:15.333 --> 00:05:18.250
by a single battery charge.

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:22.125
So Electric Avenue is a test
site to get ground truth

00:05:22.125 --> 00:05:25.250
on how people might use
e-vehicles.

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:28.833
We think the next
10 to 30 years is going to be

00:05:28.833 --> 00:05:33.125
focusing on individual passenger
vehicles like the ones behind me

00:05:33.125 --> 00:05:36.167
and also on urban freight
and service vehicles,

00:05:36.167 --> 00:05:40.375
those parcel delivery trucks,
the post office.

00:05:40.375 --> 00:05:43.042
Narrator: Those vehicles also
make lots of short trips

00:05:43.042 --> 00:05:45.292
with starts and stops,
producing emissions

00:05:45.292 --> 00:05:48.083
and using up a lot of fuel.

00:05:48.083 --> 00:05:50.708
Nationally, companies
like Frito Lay are competing

00:05:50.708 --> 00:05:53.167
with others like
Federal Express to see

00:05:53.167 --> 00:05:57.500
who can deploy the most low
emission delivery vehicles.

00:05:57.500 --> 00:05:59.042
Tailpipe emissions
are the single

00:05:59.042 --> 00:06:03.917
greatest source of emissions
in our major cities.

00:06:03.917 --> 00:06:07.000
So I think probably every mayor,

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.167
everywhere, supports the idea

00:06:10.167 --> 00:06:12.208
of getting more vehicles
on their local roads

00:06:12.208 --> 00:06:14.792
that don't have tailpipes.

00:06:14.792 --> 00:06:16.625
Narrator: Portland's original
plans concentrated

00:06:16.625 --> 00:06:19.625
on land use
and transportation.

00:06:19.625 --> 00:06:23.250
The focus for the future
is the neighborhood.

00:06:23.250 --> 00:06:26.250
The goal is what's called
a 20 minute neighborhood

00:06:26.250 --> 00:06:28.125
with most everything
a family needs

00:06:28.125 --> 00:06:31.083
in easy walking
or biking distance,

00:06:31.083 --> 00:06:35.417
where kids can learn how to
ride safely to and from school.

00:06:35.417 --> 00:06:38.625
Earl: This effort of integrating
the pedestrian,

00:06:38.625 --> 00:06:44.250
streetcar, bike, along
with mixed use development,

00:06:44.250 --> 00:06:46.792
it is enriching
the experience of going

00:06:46.792 --> 00:06:50.458
to the store, going to visit
a neighbor

00:06:50.458 --> 00:06:55.750
and makes us a more sustainable,
cost-effective community.

00:06:55.750 --> 00:06:57.958
Narrator: Portland's
transportation innovations

00:06:57.958 --> 00:07:00.542
have direct economic benefits.

00:07:00.542 --> 00:07:02.500
By actually doing
the right things here,

00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:04.917
we've built this base
of great export.

00:07:04.917 --> 00:07:07.167
We've got solar firms,
wind firms.

00:07:07.167 --> 00:07:09.708
We have firms focused on energy
efficiency

00:07:09.708 --> 00:07:11.875
with hundreds and hundreds
of employees.

00:07:11.875 --> 00:07:14.792
And they're locating here
or they grew up here because

00:07:14.792 --> 00:07:18.958
we were trying to do something
and we built demand here.

00:07:18.958 --> 00:07:20.292
We're one
of the cheapest cities

00:07:20.292 --> 00:07:24.292
on the west coast, because we
offer options other than

00:07:24.292 --> 00:07:29.750
having to own a car to live
and work and have a good life.

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:31.458
I think just like anything
you're trying to do,

00:07:31.458 --> 00:07:34.417
whether it's a business
or a government or a city,

00:07:34.417 --> 00:07:36.625
good things don't happen
by accident.

00:07:36.625 --> 00:07:38.875
You need to have
some good plans.

00:07:38.875 --> 00:07:43.250
We can reduce that carbon
footprint while we provide

00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:48.500
economic opportunities
for our citizens and others.
