00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:37.260
Gweneviere Mann: I always have note card in my pocket that tells me

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.079
what the date is. And I have to write down
when I eat meals because sometimes I

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:45.069
might eat lunch three times because I
don't remember that I ate already.

00:00:45.069 --> 00:00:49.710
The doctors say the brain can continue
healing up to two years, but whatever is

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:51.019
not back by that point

00:00:51.019 --> 00:00:55.049
is not likely to ever come back. Yasir Salem: So you had
your surgery in November of

00:00:55.049 --> 00:00:59.589
2008 right? GM: Right, and so I'm gonna have to
live the rest of my life

00:00:59.589 --> 00:01:03.809
this way. And the thing that scares me
the most is, like, the thought that

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.220
I will wake up one day, and I'll be 80
years old and I won't remember the last

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:09.600
40 years of my life.

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.440
YS: Do you remember when you first came out of
surgery? GM: I know that I used to always

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.380
think that I was in San Francisco.

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:18.710
YS: What are those things called? Do you remember?
GM: Confabulations? YS: Yeah. GM: Yeah.

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:22.360
Do you remember another
confabulation that I used to have?

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:26.210
YS: You used to think that your coworker, Barbara,
was your mom.

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.500
GM: (Laughing) That's right. YS: Even though she's a completely different race

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:33.860
than you. GM: That's funny, yeah. YS: There was one
point where you

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:38.340
were confused 'cause you thought we had
broken up, and I would ask you, like, "Why

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:39.840
do you think you're staying in my place?" You're just like,

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.840
"Well we're just cool like that."

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:45.720
GM: (Laughing) Yeah, sorry
about that, after all you've been doing for me.

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:46.940
YS: Thankfully, you got over that.

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.620
GM: I'm thankful for that as well. YS: So, is
there any positive things that have come

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:51.170
out of

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:53.660
losing your memory that you can look back on?

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:56.320
GM: Well...I ran
the New York City Marathon with you my

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:57.090
boyfriend.

00:01:57.090 --> 00:02:00.409
And um, one of the things that I asked you was

00:02:00.409 --> 00:02:04.780
to help me -- as a trick -- to not let me look
at any of the

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:08.409
mile markers along the way. And if I
asked you how long we'd been running to always

00:02:08.409 --> 00:02:09.989
tell me 10 or 15 minutes (Laughing)

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:14.840
and it really worked like a charm!
And when we got to the end,

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:19.439
you and I running across the finish line,
and as if on cue I started crying my

00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:19.989
eyes out

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:24.999
cause I was so happy. You know, I have spent a
lot of days since my injury

00:02:24.999 --> 00:02:29.109
comparing myself to what I used to be
and, feeling sad about the things I've

00:02:29.109 --> 00:02:29.989
lost, but

00:02:29.989 --> 00:02:34.430
doing the marathon shows me that I
still have a lot left

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:35.410
in me.

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:36.920
