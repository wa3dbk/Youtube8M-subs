Hi. Today I will show you
how to make Christmas tree made from pine cones.

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:10.720
We need:

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:12.760
...thick A3 paper...

00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:14.600
...double-sided adhesive tape...

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.180
...pine cones...

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:18.440
...glue gun...

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:20.160
...scissors...

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.360
...fake snow or white spray...

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:29.160
...small ornaments...
(beads, ribbon bows etc)

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.060
...and glitter.

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:39.820
First, make a cone from the paper.

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:55.720
Glue it by using double-sided adhesive tape.

00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:04.960
Cut a lower part of cone.
It must stand up straight.

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:17.380
Glue pine cones to the cone starting from bottom.
Remember to cut off tails of pine cones.

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:23.080
Glue pine cones to entire cone.

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:30.520
Glue two pine cones to the tip.

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:34.440
Remove an excess of glue.

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.380
Paint the tree by using fake snow.

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:43.460
Gold spray is also very good option.

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:45.720
Time for decoration.

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:55.040
First, glue a string of beads.

00:01:55.040 --> 00:02:02.660
Next, add little ribbon bows.

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:09.440
Glue some beads.

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:15.060
Finally, decorate the pine cones by using glitter.

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:16.680
And it's done.

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:20.580
