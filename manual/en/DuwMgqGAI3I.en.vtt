00:00:16.832 --> 00:00:22.132
In the bleak midwinter

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:28.322
frosty wind made moan

00:00:28.317 --> 00:00:33.795
earth stood hard as iron

00:00:33.954 --> 00:00:39.317
water like a stone

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:44.952
snow had fallen snow on snow

00:00:45.076 --> 00:00:50.633
snow on snow

00:00:50.903 --> 00:01:07.300
In the bleak midwinter, long ago

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:13.351
Angels and archangels

00:01:13.351 --> 00:01:19.029
may have gathered there

00:01:19.029 --> 00:01:24.584
cherubim and seraphim 

00:01:24.584 --> 00:01:30.388
thronged the air

00:01:30.388 --> 00:01:36.035
but his mother only

00:01:36.035 --> 00:01:41.680
In her maiden bliss

00:01:41.678 --> 00:01:58.040
worshipped the beloved with a kiss

00:02:49.278 --> 00:02:55.040
Oh, what can I give him

00:02:55.039 --> 00:03:00.780
poor as I am

00:03:00.784 --> 00:03:06.400
If I were a shepherd

00:03:06.396 --> 00:03:12.080
I would bring a lamb

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:17.660
If I were a wise man

00:03:17.658 --> 00:03:23.060
I would do my part

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:28.920
yet, what can I give him

00:03:28.917 --> 00:03:39.560
give my heart
