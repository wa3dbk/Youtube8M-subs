00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:13.340
So, today we’re going to look at what it
takes to get a good stand of alfalfa or grass.

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:18.480
Some farmers always get good stands, and some
farmers have more problems getting good stands–so

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:22.910
what are the key characteristics that they
have to think about to get a good stand to

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:26.930
be able to end up with a good field like we
have behind me here.

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:31.949
The important things we have to think about
are first having a weed free stand to start

00:00:31.949 --> 00:00:39.410
in, then to have the field leveled, then to
have it packed so we have soil that is firm

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:43.840
and that your soil doesn’t sink in more
than a quarter of an inch, and then to place

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:46.690
the seed at the proper depth.

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:58.120
As long as we pay attention to those factors,
we will get a good stand most of the time.

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:04.110
The first important thing is to have the field
tilled well, as you see behind me here, we

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:09.650
want to have a weed free surface, and then
we also want to have it be reasonably firm

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:15.520
so that the sole of the shoe does not sink
in more than a quarter of an inch.

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:21.130
If the soil is too loose, then when we put
the seed in the soil the seed does not have

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:25.590
good contact with the soil and won’t take
up water, and we’ll get a poor stand.

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:33.549
So, packing the soil around the seed is crucial.

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:39.200
The second thing we want to pay attention
to then is appropriate seeding depth.

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:46.090
What we are looking at is that we want alfalfa
and grasses in that quarter to half inch range

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:47.759
in most of our soils.

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:52.450
We can go a little bit deeper in sands, but
generally we’re thinking a quarter to half

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:53.689
an inch.

00:01:53.689 --> 00:01:57.760
This means that we should see some seeds on
the surface after we’re done.

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:06.119
If we go back and look we should see approximately
4-5 seeds per square foot on the surface of

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:07.810
the soil after we’ve seeded.

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:35.780
If we do not see any seeds, then we have probably
put all of the seeds too deep.

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:50.030
So, here is a stand of alfalfa that was seeded
about three weeks ago, it was seeded at about

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:56.380
12 pounds per acre and as you can see there
is a plant along here coming up in this row

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:58.450
about every inch.

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:06.460
That is a more than adequate stand for alfalfa,
if we have about 40 plants per square foot,

00:03:06.460 --> 00:03:15.010
that’s a good stand, and then all of those
stands will fit down to about 30-35 plants

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:17.980
per square foot at the end of the seeding
year.

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:23.980
Here is a spot where the seeding rate is really
unnecessarily high.

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:27.530
This must have been about a 20 pound seeding
rate.

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:35.980
If you look, you can see that there are three
to four plants per row, this will give us

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:40.900
way more plants than that 30-40 that we need
for the end of the year.

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:46.210
So this stand comes up now, it looks very
good, but the fact is the plants are competing

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:52.100
against each other and the stands will gradually
thin down to 30-35 plants by the end of the

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:52.530
seeding year.
