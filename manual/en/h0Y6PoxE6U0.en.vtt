00:00:09.969 --> 00:00:11.699
I was a stay at home mom

00:00:11.699 --> 00:00:15.589
and I started baking cakes to have extra money.

00:00:15.589 --> 00:00:21.319
It started with an idea really from my mother
who said you make the cakes and I’ll help you sell them.

00:00:21.319 --> 00:00:24.429
We created a web site for Make My Cake
because there was a need

00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:30.859
for our global visitors to see what we we did, from baked goods to our decorated cakes,

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:33.880
our family history, why we exist,

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:36.080
and why they should visit our shop.

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:41.130
When I first told my mom I wanted to re-launch our website,
I said let me create something that 

00:00:41.130 --> 00:00:45.690
is a reflection of fifteen years of business
and she said go for it.

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:55.750
I always ask how did you hear about us especially 
when someone comes in the store and it sounds like they haven’t been here before. Well, how did you hear about us? The internet certainly brings in a lot of people.

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:00.610
A web site is an extension of
our business

00:01:00.610 --> 00:01:02.800
when it’s too busy for someone to answer the phone.

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.219
It’s our virtual salesperson

00:01:05.219 --> 00:01:08.480
and that is very key.

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:11.060
A picture can say so much.

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:14.330
I want my clients to be able to look at our website and

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:16.110
as soon as they see

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.810
a slice of German Chocolate Cake, their first thought and their continued thought throughout the day 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.389
is I can’t wait until I have a slice of German Chocolate Cake.

00:01:24.389 --> 00:01:28.979
My mother always said that it doesn’t matter what it tastes like if it doesn’t look right no one is going to eat it. 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:34.490
So that visual that people can see through the website I
think is what’s really important. 

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:44.490
So when we got into doing the next phase of doing our website, we got a food photographer who was able to capture that toasted 

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:47.800
pecan on our red velvet cupcake, see the chocolate curls on our sweet potato cheesecake.

00:01:47.800 --> 00:02:01.200
We took a lot of time to make sure it was user friendly, it had a clean look, a lot of products were representative of what we do on a day to day basis.

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:03.500
The woman on the box is supposed to be me.

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:05.570
but in reality it’s my grandmother.

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:11.450
You have people who come into the store and say “Listen, I want that lady to serve me.”

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:15.649
So, I love this logo. I like the idea that in 20-30 years from now

00:02:15.649 --> 00:02:19.779
this is still a family owned business. I think it’s a good thing.

00:02:19.779 --> 00:02:23.629
A small business owner that wants to create a website should just go for it. 

00:02:23.629 --> 00:02:26.289
It’s easy and free and you can set one up in just a few minutes. 

00:02:26.289 --> 00:02:30.749
Having a website is important because customers are looking online for local business information. 

00:02:31.269 --> 00:02:35.359
You can show them your business hours, where
you are located, the types of products and services

00:02:35.359 --> 00:02:38.769
you offer, and even offer promotions and discounts right from your website.
