00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:03.340
Hi, Guy Cochran, here to bring you another
session of the DVeStore Theater.

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:06.509
In this one, we're going to do a little tutorial
on how to use this

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:09.090
Sennheiser Wireless G2 Evolution series.

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.300
There have been some discussions
on the boards, how do you set the AF out?

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:16.340
How do you adjust these levels
I'm getting over modulation?

00:00:16.340 --> 00:00:19.140
We're going to take a look at the few of the
things that you could change to make your

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:21.089
sound even better.

00:00:21.089 --> 00:00:24.539
Now this first piece that we're looking at
is the receiver.

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.249
Now you can
tell that this one's the receiver because

00:00:26.249 --> 00:00:28.499
on the top it will say AF Out.

00:00:28.499 --> 00:00:31.919
Now if you open up the door inside, you will
see a couple of buttons.

00:00:31.919 --> 00:00:34.660
One
says on and off, we'll go ahead and hit the

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:35.660
on/off button.

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:37.750
The other one
that you see here is called set and then you

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:40.230
also have two up and down
arrows.

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:41.510
Now the first thing that we're going to do
is we're going to go

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:42.770
ahead and reset this unit.

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:44.260
So we're going to press set, we're going to
use

00:00:44.260 --> 00:00:46.610
the up and down arrows to scroll up to reset.

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:49.140
We'll say set again.

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:50.140
It says
no.

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:53.350
We are going to scroll up to OK, hit set again.

00:00:53.350 --> 00:01:00.650
So now we've just reset
the unit and it is back to its factory defaults.

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:04.589
Now when you first fire up this guy I want
you to have the transmitter off,

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:07.380
so keep the transmitter off if your transmitter
is on, go ahead and turn it

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:08.380
off right now.

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:11.140
The next thing we're going to do is we're
going to press set

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:14.240
and we're going to scroll down to scan.

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:20.350
We're going to scan for available
frequencies, so we'll go ahead and say set.

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:22.960
It'll say start and we'll press
set again.

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:24.900
It scans for open frequencies.

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.420
It found four channels free.

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:30.340
We'll go ahead and press set again and now
they're stored.

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.380
To get out of any menu, you can also just
press the on/off button.

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:37.759
That's
like escape, so the on/off button here will

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:38.939
jump you right back to the main
menu.

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:46.979
We're going to scroll over to AF Out which
is here.

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:51.280
We'll go ahead
and say set and right now it is way high,

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:54.549
as it's default it's way, way too
hot so we're going to go ahead and take it

00:01:54.549 --> 00:01:58.540
down and we'll first try it at
about negative 18.

00:01:58.540 --> 00:01:59.679
All video cameras are going to be a little
bit

00:01:59.679 --> 00:02:02.999
different, but we'll go ahead and set this
one for negative 18.

00:02:02.999 --> 00:02:03.999
It's
stored.

00:02:03.999 --> 00:02:06.990
We'll go ahead and press the on/off and we're
done setting up the

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:08.310
receiver.

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:12.060
Now we're going to move on to the transmitter.

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.930
So now we're looking at the
transmitter.

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:16.330
You can tell which one's the transmitter because
it says on

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:19.269
the back transmitter and it also has the handy
little clip.

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:21.540
Now, we'll go
ahead and turn this guy on because remember

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:22.730
we had it off.

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.880
You're actually
seeing the VU meters kick in right now.

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:27.319
Let's go ahead and reset this guy.

00:02:27.319 --> 00:02:32.569
We're going to say set, we're going to scroll
up to reset, we'll say set,

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:34.640
reset OK.

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.170
It resets itself.

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:40.569
So it defaults to 518.150 megahertz.

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:45.480
Now we're going to go ahead and adjust our
levels so we're going to scroll

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.390
down to sensitivity.

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:52.290
Now for most people between negative 10 and
negative

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:53.599
20 is going to be pretty good.

00:02:53.599 --> 00:02:58.860
What will happen is if you adjust this
sensitivity and you have it up too high, what

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:01.909
will happen is when somebody
starts getting really loud it will peak and

00:03:01.909 --> 00:03:04.030
you will clip and you will have
bad audio.

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:08.489
So what we want to do is we want to bring
this guy down while we

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:10.160
have it on somebody's chest.

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:17.440
So right now I want you to visualize having
the microphone placed about halfway down the

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:21.090
chest, right where the sternum
is, the breastplate.

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.340
Don't put it up on the collar.

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:26.409
We're going to adjust
this down to about negative 20 DB is good

00:03:26.409 --> 00:03:27.549
for people.

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:31.880
For most interviews,
negative 20 DB is going to be about right.

00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:35.109
Your mileage may vary,
depending on how loud the speaker actually

00:03:35.109 --> 00:03:37.409
gets.

00:03:37.409 --> 00:03:40.340
We'll go ahead and say
store and now our sensitivity is set and we

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:44.780
can press the on/off button and
we're back at 518.150.

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:51.420
We're actually looking like we're a little
bit low, check, check one, check

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:53.990
two.

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:58.270
For me we might actually want to go back into
sensitivity, say

00:03:58.270 --> 00:04:01.439
negative 20 and let's bring it up to negative
10 because you want to ride

00:04:01.439 --> 00:04:02.439
those levels.

00:04:02.439 --> 00:04:03.870
Let's go ahead and escape out of here.

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:06.219
You want to ride those
levels so that you're getting the numbers

00:04:06.219 --> 00:04:07.720
to be about halfway.

00:04:07.720 --> 00:04:13.200
So that's
looking pretty good right there.

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:16.120
Now the other thing that you might want to
do is tune.

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:19.690
Maybe, maybe
somebody is also on this frequency and you

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:20.950
want to retune.

00:04:20.950 --> 00:04:26.580
So what you can
do now is you can go to set, and let's go

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:30.770
ahead and go to bank.

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:34.990
Now you
have eight banks and one user definable bank.

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:39.270
Basically, what these are are
groups of channels, so you have eight groups

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:40.520
of channels.

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:45.610
So you can see
that if we go to bank one and we go over to

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:51.550
channel that we have one, two,
three, four channels for this bank.

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:54.460
So this is bank one and it has four
channels in it.

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:57.430
These are the four.

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:04.979
So let's say we wanted to go to 520.950, we'll
go ahead and say set and now

00:05:04.979 --> 00:05:07.720
it's stored and we can get out of here.

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:12.139
Five twenty-nine fifty, now we'll
jump back over to the receiver and we'll set

00:05:12.139 --> 00:05:13.319
it up.

00:05:13.319 --> 00:05:16.400
So what we're going to
do is we're going to jump onto bank one, so

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:22.280
we're going to hit set, jump
over to bank, we're going to go to bank one,

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:23.280
set.

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:29.970
Then we're going to go
over to channel one and it was 520.950, set,

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:33.860
and you see the little RF light
light up.

00:05:33.860 --> 00:05:40.240
Now on the receiver unit you might also want
to adjust your squelch.

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:42.180
The
squelch should always be at low unless you

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:44.569
are getting a ton of wireless
interference.

00:05:44.569 --> 00:05:47.280
Say, for example, you're at a trade show,
you might want to

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:51.889
bring this up to something a little bit more
like mid or high, but you're

00:05:51.889 --> 00:05:55.490
going to decrease your range.

00:05:55.490 --> 00:06:00.810
So we'll bring that back down on low.

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:06.310
Another interesting feature is pilot tone.

00:06:06.310 --> 00:06:08.970
With these units you always want
to leave the pilot tone on.

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:10.830
Basically, what the pilot tone does is it
looks

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:14.440
for the transmitter and if it doesn't hear
its pilot tone and it's this

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:17.770
super high frequency that not even dogs can
hear, if it doesn't hear that

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:28.379
pilot tone, what it will do is it will automatically
mute the unit.

00:06:28.379 --> 00:06:30.490
You can
also name each unit.

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:32.630
Maybe, you have different talent and you want
to name

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:33.630
each one.

00:06:33.630 --> 00:06:34.630
This one is called the EK100.

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:43.180
You can change this name to
whatever you want.

00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:46.080
So the last thing that we want to set is the
levels on our camera.

00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:48.500
So we're
going to first set the record level to manual.

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:52.819
Then what we want to do is
we want to take this guy down to about 30%.

00:06:52.819 --> 00:06:56.780
Now if you notice that the
levels are way too hot on your camera's VU

00:06:56.780 --> 00:07:02.570
meters, go into the AF Out on
your receiver and bring the levels down to

00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:04.090
something like negative 30.

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:05.909
So
right now I have it at negative 30, and this

00:07:05.909 --> 00:07:07.819
seems to be a good match.

00:07:07.819 --> 00:07:09.289
The
other trick that I like to do is I like to

00:07:09.289 --> 00:07:10.300
change the balance.

00:07:10.300 --> 00:07:14.840
I like to
bring the balance a little bit down so what

00:07:14.840 --> 00:07:18.520
you have is one side a little
bit lower than the other.

00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:20.331
So this way if somebody ever does clip, if
they

00:07:20.331 --> 00:07:24.979
go really high, you still have some level
to play with.

00:07:24.979 --> 00:07:28.550
Hi and thanks for tuning in to this tutorial
on the Sennheiser Evolution G2

00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:29.550
Wireless Series.

00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:31.520
If you haven't picked one of these up, there's
nothing out

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:34.759
on the market that is under a thousand dollars
that sounds as good or is as

00:07:34.759 --> 00:07:36.970
reliable as these new units.

00:07:36.970 --> 00:07:40.040
Here we have one mounted onto the Canon XL-1S
via the hot shoe.

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:42.580
You can see that it's highly portable, it's
very small

00:07:42.580 --> 00:07:43.820
compared to the camera.

00:07:43.820 --> 00:07:44.820
It's lightweight.

00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:47.840
I've been using one for the last
couple months and the unit is awesome.

00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:49.409
It hasn't failed me at all.

00:07:49.409 --> 00:07:50.409
It's
just working great.

00:07:50.409 --> 00:07:51.590
I even took it to NAB.

00:07:51.590 --> 00:07:55.389
All those interviews that you
hear from NAB are all using this wireless

00:07:55.389 --> 00:07:58.610
unit or the wireless handheld
with the ENG kit.

00:07:58.610 --> 00:08:01.860
So the standard kit contains just the transmitter
and the

00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:06.939
receiver, and then if you add the ENG kit
you get the plug-on transmitter

00:08:06.939 --> 00:08:08.210
as well.

00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:11.009
You can do so by clicking that little buy
now button down below,

00:08:11.009 --> 00:08:14.130
and hopefully you guys pick one up if you
don't already own one and you

00:08:14.130 --> 00:08:15.270
will enjoy it as much as I do.
