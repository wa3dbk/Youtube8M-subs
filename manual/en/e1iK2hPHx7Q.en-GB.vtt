00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:09.770
How we doing everybody Justin here, got another
race report for the weekend Friday night club

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:15.710
racing at Unser Underground. My little brother
was in town this week he flew in with his

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:24.470
Team Losi SCTE 2.0 so check out the race footage
of me and him going against my Tekno SCT410,

00:00:24.470 --> 00:00:32.460
see how it went and give ya some race commentary
as the race is going on. Alright here we go

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:38.100
start of the 4x4 shortcourse A main I had
the TQ spot my little brother was right behind

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:44.100
me in the 2nd spot. I'm the pink white and
black he's driving the yellow, black, purple,

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.440
and white. He gets around me after I make
a bobble right in that middle turn almost

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:57.829
like I always do. And he makes a bobble coming
down the hill before the cross over and I

00:00:57.829 --> 00:01:08.289
get back in front. We had a fun little battle
going on, making more mistakes myself. Gives

00:01:08.289 --> 00:01:13.780
me a little love tap and spins me around,
being the nice brother that he is he waits

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:28.130
up for me. And he slows down at the end of
the turn and I run into him and spin him out,

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:37.220
so switching places again, having some fun.
I somehow did a 360 on my wheels landed back

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:43.570
and then some in air contact. He ended up
on his lid I ended up on my wheels, I didn't

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:48.800
want to let the guy from 3rd place get in
front of both of us and start taking off,

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:55.479
so at that point I got back on it and got
a little more serious and kept on driving.

00:01:55.479 --> 00:02:01.080
We had almost about the same pace going from
the beginning part of the race and he tipped

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:11.230
on that center bump that used to get me in
the past which is always tricky if you hit

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.060
it wrong. Alright so gonna talk about the
truck upgrades and setup changes I made real

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:21.890
quick here, talk quickly about the upgrades.
I got the lightweight aluminum drive shaft

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:30.310
in there now as well as the lightweight differential
outdrives in the rear and the front as well.

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:36.620
Can't see kitty? Alright now we can see kitty
now we'll talk about truck setup changes.

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:43.890
If you remember from previous weeks I had
problems with rear end traction and problems

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:47.730
with going over bumps and jumps and things
like that. Truck was a little bit hard to

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:54.780
control it was bottoming out a lot so that
was causing me some problems. What I did to

00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:00.700
try to cure that, I changed the rear anti
squat from the steepest most angle on the

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:06.120
back of the truck to a more neutral angle,
I went to the center holes on the inner hinge

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:12.680
pin holders there. I also changed the rear
camber links, if you can see there, from the

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:19.970
number 2 slot on the shock tower to the number
3 slot, basically the lowest inner most hole

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:25.840
on the inner camber link. That's to kinda
get increased camber gain when the suspension

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:30.659
compresses to try to generate a little bit
more rear traction and it also raises the

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:37.140
rear roll center so the truck will roll a
little bit more. But those things combined

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:41.879
seemed to help pretty good with getting the
truck to hook up a little bit better in the

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:48.840
rear. During practice sessions I did run the
green bar codes in the rear initially to test

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:53.500
with those changes and it worked definitely
was better then I threw on a set of gold bar

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:59.159
codes tires which is what I have now a little
bit stiffer tires and carcuss overall, little

00:03:59.159 --> 00:04:04.739
stiffer side wall. Those tires combined with
the setup changes I made in the rear made

00:04:04.739 --> 00:04:09.170
it a lot better I had a lot more rear traction,
was able to keep it under control and wasn't

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:14.840
fish tailing around like I was the previous
week. Now for the suspension to try and get

00:04:14.840 --> 00:04:20.459
rid of the issues in the bumps and the jumps
I went and changed the droop both front and

00:04:20.459 --> 00:04:24.449
rear. I added some of the droop back to the
truck, I added another millimeter in the rear

00:04:24.449 --> 00:04:29.920
of the truck so I went from I believe 119
to 120 millimeters in the rear and then in

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:37.100
the front I added 2 millimeters back to the
front of the truck. So I went from 101 millimeters

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:42.260
previously to 103 millimeters for the front
droop. That actually made a huge difference

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:49.020
how the truck behaved over the bumps and the
jumps and wasn't bottoming out quite as much

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:53.280
and made it quite a bit easier to control
while retaining the stability in the high

00:04:53.280 --> 00:05:00.750
speed turns and corners. One other thing I
did was with the servo saver, you can't hardly

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:05.460
see that I'm not going to try and point it
out. Basically I took the servo saver down

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:11.560
and tightened it up to 6.2 millimeters I think
the manual has you do it 4 millimeters basically

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:16.620
4 millimeters of threads showing at the end
of the servo saver. So I cranked that down,

00:05:16.620 --> 00:05:21.500
tightened it up, tried to take out some of
the steering slop and that helped definitely

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:25.970
helped with some of the steering, keeping
the car turned and it was turning really really

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:31.470
good this week. So I think I'm finally getting
to the point of that sweet spot with the setup

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:36.199
on the truck, I'll try to get a setup sheet
filled out and post a link to that for you

00:05:36.199 --> 00:05:43.800
guys to reference and let's get back to the
racing and the commentary on the race itself.

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:48.120
Alright we're coming into the final minute
of the race here, I'm coming across the front

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:53.789
double double section in front of the driver
stand, maintained the first position through

00:05:53.789 --> 00:05:58.860
most of the race. I was just trying to put
down some fast laps and be consistent and

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:03.699
improve on my times from the previous week.
I did actually go a little quicker this week

00:06:03.699 --> 00:06:11.360
so the truck's running strong, my fast lap
was a 21.417 and my top fives were right there

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:16.069
on the 21 second range and almost got my top
tens in that 21 second range so good improvement.

00:06:16.069 --> 00:06:20.970
My little brother there in the right hand
corner pulled out the 2nd place running the

00:06:20.970 --> 00:06:26.940
SCTE 2.0 that truck drives smooth and fast
very easy to drive fast, I got some time to

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:32.210
drive it myself. But he was right there up
with me, only his first night on the track.

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:39.630
He ran a fast lap of 21.548 and his top fives
were in the 21.970 range as well, so good

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:44.120
showing for him it was fun to have him out
there. Closing down the race pulled out the

00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:49.720
win and it was a good night for the truck.
Alright so that does it for this week Tekno

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:55.910
SCT410 looking strong now, feeling better
about the setup, things are going pretty good.

00:06:55.910 --> 00:07:00.280
Like I mentioned in the buggy race report
if you haven't watched it we got some track

00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:06.610
changes coming up soon at Unser I believe
and we'll see what we need to do to get the

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:12.330
truck going quicker right off the bat on the
new layout, so stay tuned and as always, like,

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:17.099
share, subscribe down below we would appreciate
it and we'll catch ya next time, thanks!
