00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:05.000
The derby is always the derby, it's always hard and strongly felt

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.000
This derby is particular as it comes after the international break and the two sides both have lots of international players

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:20.000
We've now got a full squad and it will be a great match, not easy, but a great match

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Itâ€™s different for Inzaghi, because experiencing a derby as a coach is different to a player

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.000
It's his first derby as Milan coach and I hope this brings him luck 

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Definitely Shevchenko's goal in the  second leg of the Champions League

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
That goal has an important meaning to my career and my life

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Those were unforgettable years with Carlo Ancelotti

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000
I think it's hard to have a side as strong as that again

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
but let's hope for the best in the future

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
We won everything and as I say those were unforgettable years 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:16.000
The coach was brilliant in getting everyone involved and making everyone feel a part of the group

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.000
I have an excellent relationship with the coach

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Of course it's hard to have the same relationship that we had when we were both players

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
As he now has a different role in the dressing room. 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:40.000
I try to be professional and we don't joke around as much as before for example

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
He has a different role. I'm a player and he's a coach

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
I call him coach so of course something has changed

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:55.000
I started very young with the Italian national side and was part of the squad for the European Championships in 2000

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:03.000
I was however surrounded by brilliant goalkeepers such as Toldo, Buffon, Peruzzi

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:10.000
I was always third choice and after a certain stage I preferred not to say farewell exactly

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
But think more about Milan and stay here with the squad and train

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Third choice goalkeeper for the Italian national side is important, but only until a certain age

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:31.000
After which it's better to let other capable goalkeepers and youngers ones have their chance
