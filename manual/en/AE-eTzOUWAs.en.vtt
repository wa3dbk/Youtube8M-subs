00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:08.470
Nokia X2-02.

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:11.920
Expected Q4 2011.

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:17.360
The Nokia X2-02 is the third variation of
this particular handset, following on from

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:25.699
last year's original Nokia X2 and the unlovely
X2-05.

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:30.439
It might seem that these old products are
hanging around Nokia's line-up like a bad

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:36.050
smell, but the X2-02 is a rather interesting
device with some useful features compared

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:41.370
to the original X2, and with a price ticket
of just â‚¬60 then it looks like pretty decent

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:45.350
value overall.

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:50.920
This is a dual-SIM device, so it can support
two active SIM cards at the same time.

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:54.809
The second SIM card can be hot swapped via
a slot in the side.

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:02.150
There is also a built-in SIM manager that
can support up to five different SIMs.

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:08.750
The X2-02 is a dual-band GSM device that supports
GPRS and EDGE data, so it is hardly a speed

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:11.360
demon when it comes to connectivity.

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:19.880
On the front is a simple 2.2" 240 x 320 pixel
TFT display, on the back is a basic 2 megapixel

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.220
camera.

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:27.880
It gets more interesting when you see that
the X2-02 also has an MP3 player, Bluetooth

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:31.760
2.1, has a microSD slot and an FM radio.

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:36.569
One very unusual feature in a phone of this
price is an FM transmitter, so you can play

00:01:36.569 --> 00:01:41.880
music from the phone onto a stereo or car
audio system.. or even another phone with

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.560
an FM receiver.

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:50.080
Another slightly interesting feature is that
the FM antenna is integrated into the case,

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:53.590
so you don't need to plug in the headphones
to act as an aerial.

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:59.660
The speaker on the X2-02 is very loud (rated
at 106 phon) so it makes a useful standalone

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:04.240
radio or music player.

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:09.649
Although this is only a 2.5G device, it does
come with the new Nokia Browser which is designed

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:11.810
to optimise the web over slow links.

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:16.980
There is also support for social networking
and instant messaging, plus Nokia Life Tools

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.460
in certain markets.

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:24.560
The X2-02 runs the new facelifted version
of Series 40, and although it isn't a smartphone

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:30.250
you can still download Java applications to
run on it.

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:37.310
The relatively large 1020mAh battery gives
up to 9.7 hours talktime and 18.5 days standby

00:02:37.310 --> 00:02:38.330
time.

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:45.560
The X2-02 weighs 93 grams and measures 113
x 50 x 15mm.

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:51.720
Of note is that the standard sales package
includes a stereo wired headset but no microSD

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.270
card.

00:02:55.270 --> 00:03:00.590
The Nokia X2-02 should be available by the
end of the year in a wide variety of colours.
