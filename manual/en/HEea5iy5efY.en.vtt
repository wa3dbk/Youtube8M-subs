00:00:18.766 --> 00:00:21.466
We’re doing our homework
at Jenny's today.

00:00:21.466 --> 00:00:23.600
Come by at 3 o'clock, okay?

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:25.833
But 3 o’clock’s
my snack time!

00:00:25.833 --> 00:00:27.800
Boy Doug…
food’s all you talk about.

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:28.933
Don't worry, Doug.

00:00:28.933 --> 00:00:31.300
I’m baking a batch of
delicious cupcakes for us.

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:32.633
- Cupcakes?
- Uh huh.

00:00:32.633 --> 00:00:34.933
I’m not eating any
cupcakes you make.

00:00:34.933 --> 00:00:36.733
Fine.  You don’t have to.

00:00:36.733 --> 00:00:40.900
That means more
cupcakes for me. YUM!

00:00:40.900 --> 00:00:43.266
Doug, you didn’t
eat your snack!

00:00:43.266 --> 00:00:44.833
That’s OK!

00:00:44.833 --> 00:00:48.900
Maybe I can eat that snack
after I have Jenny’s cupcakes.

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:54.866
- Son… sonny, wait.
- Yes?

00:00:54.866 --> 00:00:57.733
- I need directions.
- Where to?

00:00:57.733 --> 00:00:59.966
Do you know how to
get to the hospital?

00:00:59.966 --> 00:01:01.633
The fastest way is…

00:01:01.633 --> 00:01:04.766
you turn up at the corner, then
you turn way down over there

00:01:04.766 --> 00:01:07.300
- then turn the other way
- I need details.

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.466
“Turn there, then there”
too confusing.

00:01:10.466 --> 00:01:12.633
Oh sorry.

00:01:12.633 --> 00:01:15.433
I'll just take you there.
Follow me.

00:01:15.433 --> 00:01:17.633
Oh... thank you.

00:01:17.633 --> 00:01:21.266
- Well, here it is.
- Thank you very much.

00:01:21.266 --> 00:01:25.100
- Okay, see you around.
- Bye bye.

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.600
I’m going to be late.
Better hurry.

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.533
Coco, come down!

00:01:33.533 --> 00:01:36.133
Coco, please come down.

00:01:36.133 --> 00:01:37.466
What's the matter, Mary?

00:01:37.466 --> 00:01:42.000
Doug… My cat Coco is up in that
tree and won’t come down.

00:01:44.133 --> 00:01:47.233
I’ll get Coco down for you.

00:01:53.133 --> 00:01:58.066
- Here she is, Mary.
- Coco, Are you okay?

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:01.400
Well… better get going now.

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:03.733
- Thank you, Doug.
- Sure!

00:02:03.733 --> 00:02:08.266
I better hurry or
I’ll miss those cup...

00:02:08.266 --> 00:02:11.100
I have to make this light.

00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:13.766
My turn.

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.966
You should never
run across like that!

00:02:18.966 --> 00:02:20.466
I'm really sorry.

00:02:20.466 --> 00:02:22.366
Do you think you
broke anything?

00:02:22.366 --> 00:02:25.600
No. I'm OK. I have to go!

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.566
Hey wait! Wait!
Come back!

00:02:27.566 --> 00:02:31.066
This is... serious.

00:02:31.066 --> 00:02:33.433
- He just ran away?
- Yeah.

00:02:33.433 --> 00:02:34.733
I told him to wait

00:02:34.733 --> 00:02:36.833
And I couldn’t follow him
down the alley.

00:02:36.833 --> 00:02:39.000
This boy could have
some kind of injury.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.766
He didn’t tell you
his name?

00:02:40.766 --> 00:02:43.366
No but...
he had brownish hair

00:02:43.366 --> 00:02:46.366
he had a few  freckles
on his face and...

00:02:46.366 --> 00:02:48.266
a white shirt
with blue stripes!

00:02:48.266 --> 00:02:52.133
Brown hair, freckles,
white shirt with stripes…

00:02:52.133 --> 00:02:55.366
- Doug!
- What took you so long?

00:02:55.366 --> 00:02:57.433
Did you stop for snack?

00:02:57.433 --> 00:02:59.833
- No... I was...
- Whatever.

00:02:59.833 --> 00:03:02.566
Let’s just get started
with our homework.

00:03:02.566 --> 00:03:05.566
- Right.
- Hey Doug! What happened?

00:03:05.566 --> 00:03:07.800
Your knee is bleeding, Doug!

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:11.400
Yeah, I kind of got...
hit by a car.

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.366
What!
What’re you doing here?

00:03:14.366 --> 00:03:16.400
Well I...

00:03:18.266 --> 00:03:20.566
- Poli?
- That's him. That’s the boy!

00:03:20.566 --> 00:03:24.033
- So… it was you!
- No no Poli...

00:03:24.033 --> 00:03:28.033
I know I made a mistake,
but please  don’t arrest me!

00:03:28.033 --> 00:03:31.366
Don't worry, Doug.
I’m not here to arrest you.

00:03:31.366 --> 00:03:35.000
I’m just worried about you.
Let’s make sure you’re okay.

00:03:39.466 --> 00:03:41.866
- Everything’s good.
- But Doug...

00:03:41.866 --> 00:03:43.766
Just because you’re
okay doesn’t mean

00:03:43.766 --> 00:03:46.300
you should ever run away
from an accident.

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:48.933
I guess I didn’t know
what to do.

00:03:48.933 --> 00:03:50.533
There are a few things
you should do

00:03:50.533 --> 00:03:52.000
if you get hit by a car.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.533
So will you listen as I
tell you what they are?

00:03:54.533 --> 00:03:55.866
Yes!

00:03:55.866 --> 00:03:58.833
If you ever get hit by a car,
try to stay calm.

00:03:58.833 --> 00:04:00.333
Don’t panic.

00:04:00.333 --> 00:04:02.366
A soon as you can,
let your parents know

00:04:02.366 --> 00:04:06.333
what’s happened and go to
the hospital with the driver.

00:04:06.333 --> 00:04:07.933
Get the phone number
of the driver

00:04:07.933 --> 00:04:09.500
and write down a description

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:12.600
and the license plate number
of the car.

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:16.033
And ask for help from anyone
who clearly saw the accident

00:04:16.033 --> 00:04:18.433
and who can describe
what happened.

00:04:18.433 --> 00:04:22.000
So kids… remember what I’ve
told you and stay safe.

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.866
- We’ll try, Poli...
- Hello there, young fellah!

00:04:26.866 --> 00:04:30.300
- Oh… nice to see you again.
- And you!

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:32.633
I just saw my friend
in the hospital...

00:04:32.633 --> 00:04:34.466
but if you hadn’t
guided me here,

00:04:34.466 --> 00:04:36.166
that wouldn’t have happened.

00:04:36.166 --> 00:04:38.333
That's good to hear.

00:04:40.733 --> 00:04:42.833
- Hi Doug.
- Hey Mary.

00:04:42.833 --> 00:04:46.366
Thanks for getting Coco
out of that tree for me.

00:04:46.366 --> 00:04:48.833
Well Dougie…
I guess you weren’t late

00:04:48.833 --> 00:04:50.233
because you were
snacking after all!

00:04:50.233 --> 00:04:51.833
You should’ve told us
you were busy

00:04:51.833 --> 00:04:54.033
helping everybody in town!

00:04:54.033 --> 00:04:56.733
Ahhh... no way.

00:04:59.566 --> 00:05:02.200
Sounds like it’s way past
your snacktime.

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:05.333
Let's go back to my house
and have the cupcakes I made.

00:05:05.333 --> 00:05:09.066
I can’t wait
to taste them, Jenny!

00:05:09.066 --> 00:05:13.366
- I may have some too.
- No, you won’t!
