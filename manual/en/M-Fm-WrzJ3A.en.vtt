00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.890
Hi! I’m Eddie Leal, and we’re going to
continue on with the fermentation process.

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:11.730
Once we add the yeast to the wort in the fermentation
tank, the yeast begins feeding off the sugars

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:17.780
creating the alcohol and CO2 content. Basically,
what this is is the primary fermentation.

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:25.061
This basically take between 4-7 days, depending
on the beer style that you’re brewing. What

00:00:25.061 --> 00:00:31.350
we did here is we pumped the water into our
fermentation tank. Basically, we’re pumping

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:36.910
the wort from our brew kettle into our fermenter,
and while we do that we cool the wort down.

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:42.370
Now, the wort is approximately about 200 degrees
when we’re bringing it from our brew kettle.

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:50.160
What we do is we bring it down; we cool it
down to our fermentation temperature. We mainly

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:56.879
make ales here so, so I ferment at 68 degrees.
So, basically when we cool that wort down,

00:00:56.879 --> 00:01:06.300
we cool it down to 68 degrees and we fill
our fermentation tank at 68 degrees. During

00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:12.340
that time period, we keep it at 68 degrees
here. This is the temperature control, and

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:21.399
this will keep it at that fermentation temperature.
After those 4-7 days, after the primary fermentation,

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:29.810
the beer will sit in this tank from 1-2 weeks,
depending on the beer; even longer if it’s

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:37.740
a lager. The stronger it is the more alcohol
is present, so it’ll take longer for it

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:44.289
sit in the tank. That time period, what’s
happening is the beer is aging inside the

00:01:44.289 --> 00:01:51.340
tank, where all the flavors are starting to
balance out, so it takes about anther 1-2

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:58.189
weeks after the primary fermentation for the
beer to balance out and age. If it was a lager,

00:01:58.189 --> 00:01:59.359
it even be longer.
