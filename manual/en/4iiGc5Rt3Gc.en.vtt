00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:13.340
Here's my LEGO® Cube. All it is a Rubik's
Cube with LEGO® 2x2 tiles super-glued on.

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:20.740
It's a lot of fun! I used a DIY Cube. I'm
not sure what type. But I lubed it and it

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:30.140
turns great! One thing I didn't notice, didn't
even think about when making a LEGO® Cube,

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:36.500
is you can see, If you're holding the cube
like this you can actually see that these

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:42.950
are white pieces over here because the LEGO®
piece sticks out a little bit.

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:53.350
Something I didn't think about. Anyway it's
a great cube, it turns well. It's a lot of

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.850
fun. A fun thing you can do is customize it
and I will do that for you guys right now.

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:01.850
I'm going to find my LEGOs®. I'll be back.

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:50.860
Here you

00:01:50.869 --> 00:01:57.280
can see I'm done customizing it. I raised
a couple sides. The yellow side is raised.

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:02.579
The blue side is raised. I put a little spinney
piece here on the yellow, and also here on

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:10.279
the blue. The red side has clear dots on it.
The orange side has the little grills. The

00:02:10.319 --> 00:02:13.640
grills are cool because it makes it a little
more challenging. you have to be sure the

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:19.989
center pieces is in line because it could
be twisted 90 degrees. Also here with the

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:24.439
arrows you have to make sure the arrow is
in line as well. It would be cool if you had

00:02:24.439 --> 00:02:29.090
a lot of arrows then you could make a Shepherds
Cube. Which would be fun. That's when there's

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:37.650
arrows on every side. Anyway. It's a lot of
fun to customize. I recommend building one

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:44.650
of these. It's very simple you just get the
LEGO's® and you glue them on the cube. Super-glue.

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:50.200
Very easy. And it's a lot of fun. So go ahead
and give it a try. Thanks for watching!
