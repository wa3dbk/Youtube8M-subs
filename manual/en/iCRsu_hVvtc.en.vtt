00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:02.630
Today I'm going to introduce to you

00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:05.060
ATEN Tap 

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:08.389
CS533

00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:10.659
The Tap is a control unit

00:00:10.659 --> 00:00:12.839
which allows us to access

00:00:12.839 --> 00:00:17.089
one computer and two bluetooth HID enabled devices

00:00:17.089 --> 00:00:21.380
from USB keyboard and mouse

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:24.460
So..Let's see the package of the the Tap

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:28.460
uh... ATEN has done the good thing, they
have really made a nice and 

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:31.470
flexible package for the Tap

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:32.570
On the front, you have 

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:34.510
a picture of the Tap

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:38.600
and on the side it has applications

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.930
and also different languages

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:42.920
at the back of the package

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:46.250
it gives you a brief  idea as to how to
connect your Tap

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:50.720
Let's see how the CS533 
actually work in action

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:54.680
As you can see now my focus is on this
iPad

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.160
as evident by the light which is showing 

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:58.410
on number "2".

00:00:58.410 --> 00:00:59.860
I opened

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:04.940
the notes on my iPad and 

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:11.940
I type something, like ATEN CS533

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:17.750
Tap device

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:23.200
I want to now focus and type on the Mac monitor.
So what do I do?

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.620
It's very simple, I just press Alt+F1

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:29.730
and the focus comes on this Mac monitor

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:34.720
and again on this Mac monitor I can type ATEN CS533 Tap

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:38.790
or whatever I want

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.840
another important feature of  the CS533 Tap is

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:48.180
that  it's allows  you to play music on
your device

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.240
even when you're typing something

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.680
For example, now my focus in on the notes
of

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:54.720
the iPad

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.090
and let's say i want to hear the music

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:57.980
on my

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:00.120
iPad devices

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:05.290
so what do i do? what do i do is I just press
F8

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:08.209
and the music starts playing.

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:13.189
so at one time I can type  and at the
same time I can listen to music

00:02:13.189 --> 00:02:20.189
also if I want to switch on to the next
song in my iPad, I just press F9

00:02:20.469 --> 00:02:26.849
or if I want to go to the previous song, then press F7.

00:02:26.849 --> 00:02:28.529
and at the same time I can type

00:02:28.529 --> 00:02:30.090
many things...

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:34.420
If I want to stop the music, it's very simple. I just 

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:38.089
press F8.

00:02:38.089 --> 00:02:41.299
Another important thing on the

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:45.529
iPad and CS533 Tap device is that I can also

00:02:45.529 --> 00:02:47.249
press F4

00:02:47.249 --> 00:02:49.479
to enter the slideshow mode

00:02:49.479 --> 00:02:52.829
so that you can see the pictures on your iPad

00:02:52.829 --> 00:02:56.829
that was brief introduction of  the CS533 Tap. My experience of

00:02:56.829 --> 00:02:58.749
buying this Tap

00:02:58.749 --> 00:03:02.829
is that it's quite cost effectived
device has being launched into the

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:03.440
market

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:06.629
uh... what the very good thing about this
product is that

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:07.420
no one else has

00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:09.900
this product and ATEN

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:16.900
has bring this product to the market, So I think you won't be able to find a similar device in the market

00:03:18.269 --> 00:03:19.419
Also, 

00:03:19.419 --> 00:03:20.379
another useful

00:03:20.379 --> 00:03:27.379
feature that i found useful duing my office use is that I could just place my iphone on the Tap and

00:03:29.389 --> 00:03:36.389
Let's say I want to type a SMS message, I can use keyboard to type SMS meessage on my iPhone

00:03:36.619 --> 00:03:39.519
thereby saving me

00:03:39.519 --> 00:03:41.169
trouble and difficulty to

00:03:41.169 --> 00:03:46.369
key-in the message on my iPhone

00:03:46.369 --> 00:03:50.439
another good thing is that as you can see that it is USB powered

00:03:50.439 --> 00:03:52.899
there's no software required

00:03:52.899 --> 00:03:56.129
it is just normal pairing with iPhone

00:03:56.129 --> 00:03:59.399
or your iPad.. bluetooth pairing

00:03:59.399 --> 00:04:03.989
and the most convenient feature that I
found useful with the CS533 Tap

00:04:04.919 --> 00:04:09.169
is that it allows you to quickly switch and
access to the computer

00:04:09.169 --> 00:04:11.659
and bluetooth devices

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:12.709
via a simple hotkey on your keyboard
