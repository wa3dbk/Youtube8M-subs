margarine for oiling

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.800
now we can start making our sweet

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:12.000
firstly we prepare the part which is with fruits,we remove the beats from the apricots

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.000
we will cook in two parts like this

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:28.800
we have cleaned the apricots ,now we put the water and the sugar in to the casserole

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:33.440
we will cook until it comes to the boiling point

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.600
the water has started to boiling

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:45.040
we add the apricots

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:51.440
we are cooking in attention not to lose the shapes of apricots

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.440
yes.our fruit are cooked

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:00.720
now we are taking the grains to the filter

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:05.040
we are waiting for it to be cool completely

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:12.000
we are waiting

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.400
while the apricots are being cold we are going on with...

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.480
oiling our cases

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:25.400
by using a lof of margarine...

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:30.280
we are oiling the cases which are strong opposite of the oven heat

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:36.120
yes.we put them in a tray ,let's go on

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.440
we burned the cooker and curtailed...

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:43.000
we put the frypan

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.120
now we put 1 tea cup granulated sugar onto the frypan...

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:50.160
which is burning curtailedly

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:54.720
by mixing sometimes,we cook without adding anything

00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:57.720
until it is caramelized

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:01.240
as you see it has been caremelizing

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:03.720
let's mix a little

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:07.440
we will continue until it becomes caramelized completely

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.280
caramel is ready , we can take from burn

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:19.840
now we seperate the caramel in to the oiled cases

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.360
now the turn of apricots

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:37.760
why didn't we put apricots raw?

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:42.000
because the raw apricot has sour taste if it is cooked in this condition

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.600
therefore we cooked them

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:51.040
we are continuing by putting some

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:58.760
for a short time we give up and start to cook custard

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:02.760
now.it is the turn of making custard

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:08.600
firstly we put the cold milk in to the saucepan

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:12.520
we add sugar on it...

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:16.200
flour...

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:19.200
wheat starch

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.160
and egg

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:29.600
we mix them well before putting on cooker

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:37.440
now we have put the custard on the burn

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:41.520
we are always mixing until it reaches the right consistency

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:51.960
the custard reached the right consistency

00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:58.160
finally we add vanilla...

00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:02.080
mix and turn off the cooker

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:10.240
now we can seperate the custard in to the cases

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:15.600
we put them less than full

00:05:21.880 --> 00:05:30.720
we will put water in to the tray at one side

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:35.200
and we will put the tray to the oven which is heated to 170 degrees

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:38.200
we eill cook the custard until it became yellow

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:42.120
we removed the sweet from oven

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:44.760
however some of their surfaces became red...

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:47.000
it is important to be red under them

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.000
now we put them in the fridge, wait for a night

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000
...we waited

00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.560
if you are in a hurry you can wait for 4 hours instead of 1 nigth

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:05.560
we waited for a nigth

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:10.280
we skin their sides by knife

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:12.800
we take a platter like this

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:16.560
we are reversing carefully

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:19.000
see if it falls or does not?

00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:22.960
yes.it fell beautifully

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:25.960
now we can service it

00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:30.440
in this section of "Mütevazý Lezzetler" kitchen...

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:33.440
we have shared a sweet recipe with apricot and caremel

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:37.160
we take the boiled fruit juice to a pitcher not to be waste

00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:39.760
if you try ý wish you remember us

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:42.120
