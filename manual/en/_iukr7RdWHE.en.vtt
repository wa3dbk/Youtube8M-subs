00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:17.660
Hi I'm Itamar and this is my wife Sarit, we're  both from Honey &amp; Co

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:20.900
A little middle eastern restaurant on Warren Street

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:26.200
and we're going to make a very very quick, very simple dish of prawns and orange and tomato sauce

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:30.660
So I'm just going to show you how to clean the prawns, if you don't know

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.080
You just need to hold them like this and get rid of the shell

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:40.400
and it just comes out like this, cut a little slit through the back

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:44.340
and remove the tract

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:49.660
and we're going to keep the heads on and we're going to keep the tail on

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:52.340
That's going to add loads of flavour to the sauce

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:56.280
So I'm just going to prep the sauce really quickly and its a really simple sauce so

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:01.440
The idea is you're using the heat in the pan, really simple ingredients and letting all the flavours come through

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:05.120
So I'm going to start with some orange and I'm going to use a whole orange

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.960
With the skin and everything just slice it into nice thin slices

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:13.840
and this is really going to give a really kind of fruity (Really fresh flavour yeah)

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:19.640
Its really fresh, its a tagine but its a really fresh tagine so forget about all of these kind of really long slow cook things

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.280
This is really really nice

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:27.560
So now the tomatoes. So this is a really such a fast dish but what you want to do is

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:33.620
get everything ready on the board so it all goes into the frying pan and you don't have to scramble around and look for things

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:38.880
So I'm taking a red chilly. If Itamar was making this for himself he'd probably use (Yeah I'd use double)

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.760
or the whole thing (Probably) but I just use a few slices

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:47.580
So I've put this pan on. Super hot, I want some smoke to happen because the heat is what's going to cook all of this

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:53.560
Two garlic cloves here. Smash them a bit with a knife so the skin just simply comes off

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:57.940
So I'm going to put a good glug of olive oil in the pan

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:04.880
and its going to smoke straight away and the first thing to go in is the orange slices

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:10.120
Don't be scared of the heat, you want it to caramelise; thats going to develop all of those flavours

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.460
Your tomatoes go in

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:15.820
Your chilly

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:19.960
Some of the thyme with the storks and everything

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:23.540
Can you give me some cardamon pods please (Yeah, smash them for you?) Yep

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.160
The cardamon, you just want to bash it around a little bit

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:31.000
and you want to see the seeds and thats going to release all the flavour

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.300
So I'm going to add just a bit of salt and pepper to season the sauce

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:38.320
If it looks a bit dry in the pan just add a couple of tablespoons of water

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:43.360
But if the tomatoes have a lot of liquid in them you may not need to (You may not need to yeah)

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:49.580
(Prawns) Prawns. So you just want to put the prawns in, all around the sauce

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:57.820
As soon as you start to see the edges of the prawns go pink we're going to just flip each one

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:03.240
It smells so nice so fruity. Tomatoes and oranges are such a good combination

00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:07.800
Even without the prawns (No you need the prawns in there)

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:14.060
Yeah but if you make like (its a lovely salad as well isn't it) a tomato and orange salad

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:17.360
or a tomato and orange soup I think its a wonderful combination

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:22.000
I would add a tiny bit of water to it (You want to add a bit more?) A little bit (Alright)

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:27.040
Just because the sauce is so nice you want a little bit more of it (You just want eat all the sauce) yeah

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.760
and this is really nice, you can have it with

00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:36.040
Couscous or rice or you can just have it with a bit of bread (Nice bread) to mop up the (Crusty loaf)

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:38.940
Yeah thats all you need really

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.920
Something to soak up all those juices

00:03:43.640 --> 00:03:49.200
So now I'm just going to add a few more thyme leaves, just for the top, just for fragrance and to make it look pretty

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.580
So just pull them off the stem

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:58.540
So that's it, prawn and orange tagine. Really quick, really delicious dinner

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.620
That's nice (its delicious the prawns are lovely)

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:11.720
Its wonderful
