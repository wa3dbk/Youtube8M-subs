00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:05.620
Now what i've got here is a picture i want to show you, how you're gonna get a 

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:07.500
little bit more out of the Nikon D

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:10.849
3100 an in camera processing ability.

00:00:10.849 --> 00:00:15.080
You can process a picture from within the camera using just the menu system.

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:19.300
and avoiding taking the pictures and putting them onto the computer and messing around using something like

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:20.500
photoshop

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:23.640
can all be done in here, so i'm gonna take a picture of this fairy bottle

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.480
and what i'll do is i'm gonna come at about half way up and actually get the reflection

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:34.880
in the draining board itself. That's it, that

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:41.880
has got the shot. So let me show you what we can do in the menu system.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.140
So what i'm gonna do next is mount the camera on the tripod and make it a bit easier for

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:46.829
you to see what i'm about to do next.

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:53.090
So with the camera now mounted on the tripod, I can show you some of the

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:56.850
in camera editing effects that the nikon d3100 has,

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.329
Now if i find a picture here of the fairy bottle shot that i just took,

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:04.000
what you can do by pressing the ok button, this brings up the options,

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.939
straight away you don't have to flick through the menu. There's lot's of options here, we've got

00:01:07.939 --> 00:01:11.659
d-lighting which is a way of the camera taking a little bit more control

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:14.619
over the shadows and highlighting and having a more contrast picture,

00:01:14.619 --> 00:01:17.689
does it automatically for you. You've got things like you can do cropping,

00:01:17.689 --> 00:01:19.740
monochrome effects, filter effects

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.470
probably understand more if shot a bit of black and white and had film but

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:26.759
you can use different colors to enhance
certain parts of the picture

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:29.759
colour balance is more picture. There's a whole list of things

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.840
fisheye, you can distort things, colour outline,

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.520
perspective control is for if you've shot a building with a wide angled lens

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:39.680
you'll notice that as it goes taller it gets thinner,

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:44.270
so you can actually cope, and actually adjust that there, so that's quite a clever feature,

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:45.399
to a miniature effect,

00:01:45.399 --> 00:01:49.290
you seen these pictures were it's taken a high vantage point looking down

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.770
and what happens is there's thin strip in the middle is in focus and the other just bleeds off in

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:53.759
softness.

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:57.860
That's an automatic function, erm. Before and after so you can see bits and pieces

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:58.189
there,

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:02.229
now what i'm. There's a couple of things i want to show you, this is the monochrome.

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:05.250
And going into clicking onto monochrome, you've got three options here,

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:08.289
and you'ver got black and white, sepia and cyanotype

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:12.360
now the one that i thought worked the best was the cynaotype, you click down here

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:16.300
and it gives us some options, now i can make it darker and lighter by just clicking up

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:16.800
and down

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.330
and should be able to see those effects there. But i quite like the standard, so i click

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:24.980
okay and it processes the picture, now the thing to remember is that picture

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.370
is a new image, it's what's called
non-destructive editing

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:32.069
so it leaves the picture that you took
in the first place and creates another

00:02:32.069 --> 00:02:33.150
one at the end.

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.580
now another affect some people might
find it cheesy but let me just find a

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:37.370
picture here

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:41.280
is erm, it works better on a spoons picture i've got

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.849
now click on OK again and go to the menu erm and i go

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:47.989
in to what's called cross screen which

00:02:47.989 --> 00:02:51.459
in actual fact is a representative or certainly from my point of view it's definitely

00:02:51.459 --> 00:02:53.200
representative of the affected itself,

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.390
but it puts little sparkles actually all over the highlights of the picture

00:02:57.390 --> 00:03:00.569
and you need an image that's got some decent highlights

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:04.120
for it to do, and all i've done is just put everything at complete maximum,

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.970
there's stars starting there, there's maximum angle

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:11.250
and all i do again is exactly the same as the other one, click on save

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:14.250
and it creates a whole new image, and

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:18.409
you should be able to count all these little star bursts, yeah it's cheesy

00:03:18.409 --> 00:03:21.060
but it's great fun, just to have a little play and find out what your

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:24.569
creative abilities the camera can give you

00:03:24.569 --> 00:03:28.810
now one other thing that's interesting is that nikons very very clever way to

00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:30.040
actually show you

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.110
the representation of the aperture, nhow if i put this into

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:36.269
aperture priority mode you can see here if i change the dial

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:39.989
the actual a representation of this top
control dial

00:03:39.989 --> 00:03:44.290
actually comes up on the back of the screen, and you can see i'm flicking round there.

00:03:44.290 --> 00:03:47.659
Now what i'm gonna do is show you how it represents aperture, you can see this

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:48.280
graphic

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:51.370
ear, now what i do is I change the aperture and go

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:56.580
and make the larger the number the smaller the aperture remember,

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:59.790
if I. I'm going down now and can you see
as

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:04.340
the number goes up the representation
this little graphic changes

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:09.040
and shows you that smaller and smaller hole If i go all the way to this particular

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:12.120
lens if that's too you can see the whole
is very very small

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:16.639
but it's a very very clever and visual way for nikoin to show you what is actually happening

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:18.139
to the mechanics of the camera,

00:04:18.139 --> 00:04:22.699
obviosuly in this case the aperture lens itself and helps you understand

00:04:22.699 --> 00:04:26.720
a little bit more about the camera and the effects

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:30.650
some the technicalities of it too, I've had a long time to play with this

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:34.310
on the 3100 mand i must admit i'm very impressed,

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:37.810
i've owned all sorts of cameras and i totally prefer this one,

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:43.350
the image quality the general use the
functionality the camera it's just

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:44.090
perfect

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:48.710
I mean very impressed that the fact that they 
really thought about

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:51.729
who's gonna buy this camera why and what they're gonna shoot

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:55.970
it's light, it's small, it's got enough features

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:59.110
for you to pick up straight away and take some really good pictures

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:03.039
and just quick the image quality, we had some stuff in the magazine a few months ago

00:05:03.039 --> 00:05:03.400
and

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:06.430
absolutely beautiful will be very
surprised how

00:05:06.430 --> 00:05:10.600
good quality the images it can actually get from the camera

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:13.910
So i'm very very impressed i'd even go as far to say

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:17.500
she's probably from a camera that probably costs

00:05:17.500 --> 00:05:19.479
around about 430

00:05:19.479 --> 00:05:24.229
to four hundred and forty pounds online, with the standard 18 to 55 mm lens.

00:05:24.229 --> 00:05:25.199
I think it's the best in it's class
