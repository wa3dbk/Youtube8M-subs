Thanks to recent studies showing the importance
of reducing our exposure to BPA, we are all

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:42.239
looking for ways to drink water without a
plastic bottle.

00:00:42.239 --> 00:00:48.550
Autism Mom Shannon Penrod shows off her new
lifefactory water bottle.

00:00:48.550 --> 00:01:06.720
Lifefactory has a line of stylish bottles,
all glass with a colorful silicone glove for

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.260
protection.

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:14.290
The best news is the entire bottle, including
the glove is dishwasher safe!

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:21.930
