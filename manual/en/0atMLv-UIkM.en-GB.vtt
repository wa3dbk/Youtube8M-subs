00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:07.130
Football has unified this country more than
anything else in the past 20 years.

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:16.890
We're tin pot football channel Sausages and
Caviar and the cats at the Guardian have asked

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:27.720
us to follow the career path of the Bosnian
diamond, Edin Dzeko.

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:40.050
Sarajevo was interesting for many reasons
because we're called Europe's Jerusalem. We

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:51.210
have mosques, churches, Catholic churches,
Orthodox churches, Jewish synagogues and you

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.150
have people who fill them up so, I mean, the
city is mixed.

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:57.490
During the civil war the city was completely
destroyed, I mean, two million bombs which

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:04.319
hit and exploded in Sarajevo have really destroyed
the city. Many people did die: 11,500 people

00:01:04.319 --> 00:01:11.319
died in Sarajevo, so it's a big number.

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:18.979
There's reminders of the war absolutely everywhere,
bullet holes in everything.

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:22.689
Football is the biggest thing here, especially
in recent years because the Bosnian national

00:01:22.689 --> 00:01:28.609
team has qualified for the World Cup in Brazil.
There is so much expectation, I know people

00:01:28.609 --> 00:01:33.270
are preparing to buy new HD TVs, you know,
this is a really big thing going on.

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:38.840
In the past 20 years, all the negative and
positive emotions have been sublimed in that

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:44.969
moment when we qualified and later, whatever
happens, doesn't matter.

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:51.969
been all cocky and tried to go on some shortcut
and now we're lost.

00:01:57.249 --> 00:02:01.639
Fuck off. We're bloody lost.

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:08.330
Tonight we're going to the Sarajevo derby,
a cup replay game between FK Sarajevo and

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.200
Zeljeznicar, the club where Dzeko started
his career.

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.020
Zeljeznicar football club is a working class
club, it comes from working class people.

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:17.390
So, the people who started it are railroad
men.

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:21.380
Just after then war, Dzeko's father took him
to Zeljeznicar to train with the youth team.

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:25.390
At the time the stadium was torn to pieces
by the war and the pitch had to be combed

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:26.640
for unexploded mines.

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.500
Dzeko struggled during his forty games for
the first team and acquired the unflattering

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:31.980
nickname of "kloc".

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:37.120
Kloc means somebody physically and mentally
incapable of doing what he has been given

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:44.120
the job of.

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:55.810
During the war, the Zeljeznicar youth team
had no where to practise because they were

00:02:55.810 --> 00:02:59.530
under fire from the constant shelling from
the hills surrounding them.

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:04.690
Bombs are hitting, snipers are shooting, so
you couldn't stay too much, kind of, outside

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:06.450
because there was a chance you could die.

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:10.280
But they used to practise under a bridge or
on a concrete pitch protected by a cluster

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:14.240
of buildings and, according to the coach,
Dzeko never missed a session.

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:17.300
We're just arriving at the Olympic stadium
for the game.

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:24.300
Still 0-0 after 53 minures, the are fans are
providing more interest than the players at

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:31.230
the minute.

00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:32.020
The last ten minutes.

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:32.440
Offisde. Offside.

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:39.440
FK Sarajevo are going through to the next
round of the cup. Zeljo fans are going mental,

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:44.000
smashing up the fences, they're going absolutely
ape shit.

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:51.000
We're just about to leave Sarajevo, it's quite
easily the nicest, most beautiful place we've

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:37.900
been so far on these trips.

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:42.760
The game was really interesting. It was a
little bit aggro at the end but we've had

00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:43.840
a lovely time.

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:47.270
Dzeko's next stop was Teplice in the Czech
Republic. We didn't have enough money to get

00:04:47.270 --> 00:04:51.670
there so we're in Wolfsburg.

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:54.770
Cut myself shaving.

00:04:54.770 --> 00:05:00.960
Dzeko signed for Wolfsburg in 2007. He formed
a magic triangle with Misimovic and Grafite,

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:03.070
propelling them to their first ever Bundesliga
title.

00:05:03.070 --> 00:05:05.220
We're a little worried that we're in the under
15s end. Maybe that's why the tickets were

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:05.290
so cheap.

00:05:05.290 --> 00:05:05.700
We're in the family zone, so it's rocking.

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:07.800
We're right next to the Frankfurt fans and
they're pretty good.

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:12.440
1-0 to Frankfurt.

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:19.440
Lovely, lovely England.

00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:31.620
We're back in Blighty for our next stop, Manchester
stitty. Stitty? Ha.

00:05:52.630 --> 00:05:57.000
I think there's a very big divide between
City and United, I think United fans are usually

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.800
full of confidence, maybe not so this season
and City fans are terrified that everything's

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:05.910
going to go wrong because history ahs kind
of taught us that if you think that City are

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:08.490
done, then there's always another surprise
in store for you.

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:12.880
At City I think Dzeko has been good and bad
at the same time. There's been a couple of

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:15.680
games where he's been absolutely anonymous,
his touch has been dreadful, it's bounced

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:18.290
off him, he's looked like he's not been able
to win a ball in the air and he's come away

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:25.290
with a goal or two goals and it's been crucial
to City winning 
the game.

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:44.639
I was sat in the stands against QPR. I was
actually cursing Edin Dzeko when he scored

00:06:44.639 --> 00:06:48.680
that equaliser because I thought: "the selfish
bastard has only done that to give us all

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:49.650
a bit of false hope."

00:06:49.650 --> 00:06:52.300
If there's a way to win the league, I don't
think that will ever be bettered. I think,

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:57.540
you know, City could win the league by 20,
30, 40 points, you know, it will never better

00:06:57.540 --> 00:07:04.130
that day against QPR, simply because you're
going from so low to so high in so short a

00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:06.320
time. The elation was huge.

00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:13.320
I think if any fanbase deserves a bit of time
in the sun, it's probably City's.
