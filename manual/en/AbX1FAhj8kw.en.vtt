00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.580
Did you know that there are four things

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:09.019
that it seems that God would not even
give to the Apostle Paul,

00:00:09.119 --> 00:00:11.903
except in answer to
other people's prayers?

00:00:12.003 --> 00:00:15.723
Hi, I'm David Daniels
from Chick Publications.

00:00:15.823 --> 00:00:18.192
The apostle Paul prayed all the time.

00:00:18.292 --> 00:00:24.284
That's what it says in Romans, Ephesians,
Colossians, Thessalonians and Timothy.

00:00:24.384 --> 00:00:30.741
In fact, in 1 Thessalonians 5:17,
Paul wrote 'Pray without ceasing.'

00:00:30.841 --> 00:00:33.504
And that's what he did.
He spent his life praying.

00:00:33.604 --> 00:00:40.117
He talked to God straight out.
He had visions and visitations,

00:00:40.368 --> 00:00:48.090
of Jesus, of angels. He even visited
the third heaven, himself.

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:50.903
He talked straight out to God.

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:57.817
So why did the apostle Paul need
anyone else to pray for him?

00:00:57.917 --> 00:01:02.715
It seems that God
may not grant certain things,

00:01:02.815 --> 00:01:08.911
except in answer to
other people's prayers for you.

00:01:09.011 --> 00:01:11.138
Want to see what they are?

00:01:11.238 --> 00:01:12.323
Here's what I found.

00:01:12.423 --> 00:01:14.350
I went through every single place
in the New Testament

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:17.837
where prayer is mentioned by Paul,
for himself.

00:01:17.937 --> 00:01:22.531
1. Deliverance from death or persecution

00:01:22.631 --> 00:01:30.585
Romans 15:30-32; 2 Corinthians 1:9-11;
2 Thessalonians 3:2.

00:01:32.582 --> 00:01:36.955
2. Deliverance from prison or jail

00:01:37.055 --> 00:01:44.549
Philippians 1:18-19; Hebrews 13:18-19;
Philemon 1:22.

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:50.091
3. That God would give him
opportunities to speak

00:01:50.191 --> 00:01:55.735
Colossians 4:3; 2 Thessalonians 3:1.

00:01:55.835 --> 00:02:03.337
4. That God would give Paul boldness,
to speak the gospel as he should

00:02:03.437 --> 00:02:08.048
Colossians 4:4; Ephesians 6:18-20.

00:02:08.148 --> 00:02:10.618
Get out your Bible and
look at that with me.

00:02:10.718 --> 00:02:12.569
Ephesians 6:18-20

00:02:12.669 --> 00:02:16.478
18 Praying always with all prayer
and supplication in the Spirit,

00:02:16.578 --> 00:02:19.973
and watching thereunto
with all perseverance

00:02:20.073 --> 00:02:22.393
and supplication for all saints;

00:02:22.493 --> 00:02:27.124
19 And for me, that utterance
may be given unto me,

00:02:27.224 --> 00:02:30.138
that I may open my mouth boldly,

00:02:30.238 --> 00:02:32.903
to make known the mystery of the gospel,

00:02:33.003 --> 00:02:35.485
20 For which I am
an ambassador in bonds:

00:02:35.585 --> 00:02:41.663
that therein I may speak boldly,
as I ought to speak.

00:02:41.763 --> 00:02:47.809
You mean Paul needed prayer from others,
to speak boldly? Paul?

00:02:47.909 --> 00:02:50.240
Yes. Exactly. That's what it says.

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:56.287
So if the apostle Paul needed prayer
from others for these four things,

00:02:56.387 --> 00:02:59.927
1. Deliverance from
death and persecution,

00:03:00.027 --> 00:03:01.890
2. Deliverance from jail,

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:06.167
3. Opportunities to speak, and
4. Boldness to speak the gospel,

00:03:06.267 --> 00:03:11.344
how much more should we be praying
for those four things for each other?

00:03:11.444 --> 00:03:16.638
For your pastor, for missionaries, for
Christian friends, for Chick Publications

00:03:16.738 --> 00:03:21.394
Even for me! Brothers and sisters,
pray for us.

00:03:21.494 --> 00:03:22.529
You know, it's amazing.

00:03:22.629 --> 00:03:28.900
Since the literal words of God
became important to me,

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.780
I started to notice the little things,
but important things,

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:34.218
like these.

00:03:34.318 --> 00:03:38.585
God bless you, and have a wonderful day.
