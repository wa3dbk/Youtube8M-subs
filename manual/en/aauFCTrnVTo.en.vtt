It's Christmas Eve

00:00:13.134 --> 00:00:15.134
and all the world is waiting

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:22.200

Star crossed lovers time divides

00:00:33.057 --> 00:00:40.000
Everybody waits on Christmas Eve

00:00:42.143 --> 00:00:44.643
Little children dance

00:00:45.395 --> 00:00:47.895

00:00:56.442 --> 00:00:59.442
So make a wish or say a prayer

00:01:01.216 --> 00:01:03.716
There's magic in the air

00:01:05.159 --> 00:01:07.659

00:01:09.208 --> 00:01:11.708

00:01:29.105 --> 00:01:32.105
Underneath the mistletoe

00:01:33.165 --> 00:01:36.165
