00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:03.930
Good morning on this
cold, wintry day.

00:00:03.930 --> 00:00:07.112
It's so rainy and cold outside.

00:00:07.112 --> 00:00:08.820
We are going to do a
hairdo this morning.

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:10.310
I know you're going to love it.

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:12.601
I know you're going to tell
everyone you know about it.

00:00:12.601 --> 00:00:13.830
It's so awesome.

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:14.890
Totally different.

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:17.430
Probably nothing you've
ever seen before.

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:18.770
It's really fun.

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:22.130
But a fan of mine sent
it to me from Moldova.

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:24.630
And I had a hard time even
finding Moldova on the map,

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:25.990
but now I know where it is.

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:28.940
It's kind of fun to know you
have fans all over the world

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:32.640
sending in hairdo ideas
and things for you to try.

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.360
So I'm starting on
damp hair this morning.

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:37.400
She's a kid and her
hair stays better

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:40.550
if it's damp-- stays
into the braid tighter.

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:42.240
If you're an adult
or if you want

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:44.920
to use this hairdo for prom
or homecoming, which I think

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:46.462
would be so fun,
then you're probably

00:00:46.462 --> 00:00:47.920
going to want to
do it on dry hair.

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:49.629
It gives it a little
more adult look.

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:51.670
So you're going to start
by just taking a section

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:53.641
right off the crown.

00:00:53.641 --> 00:00:55.390
Can you tip your head
back a little, babe?

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:00.930
Just take a section.

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.580
Try to make sure it's even.

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:03.830
Yeah.

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:07.530
Divide it into two pieces.

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:08.820
Tip back just a little again.

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:10.240
Thanks.

00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:13.130
And you're going to just
start by tying a knot.

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:17.120
We're calling this the
knotted braid-- pull it down--

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:21.841
because you're using a series
of knots to create a braid.

00:01:21.841 --> 00:01:22.340
OK.

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.310
So you have two pieces, not
three, like a normal braid--

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:26.954
just two-- left and right.

00:01:26.954 --> 00:01:28.370
We're going to go
to the left side

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:33.401
and pick up hair and add
it into that left piece.

00:01:33.401 --> 00:01:33.900
OK.

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:35.780
Now, this is the
only tricky part.

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:37.630
And once you master
this, this braid

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:39.640
will take you no time at all.

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:43.410
You're going to take this left
piece that you just added hair

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:46.110
into, and it's going
to go over the top.

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.120
So can you see how I'm
holding in one hand,

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:50.720
but now it's crossed
over the top?

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:53.120
When it's like this,
there's a hole.

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:54.530
Take your pinchers.

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:56.130
Put them up through the hole.

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.020
Now cross that hair and reach
for that underneath piece

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.120
and pull it through.

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:05.030
This looks trickier
than it really is.

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.200
You're going to tuck that
tight against the head.

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.199
And you've just created
your first little knot.

00:02:10.199 --> 00:02:10.780
OK?

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:12.510
I'll show you again.

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.610
Add hair into the
right side this time.

00:02:18.267 --> 00:02:20.350
Now remember, the piece
that you add the hair into

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:22.880
is always going to
go over the top.

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.370
So it's going to cross over.

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:28.040
But you kind of have to open
it back up a little bit just

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:29.370
to get your fingers in.

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:36.070
So fingers through, cross, and
pull for that bottom piece.

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:38.130
Pull it through.

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:39.250
OK?

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:42.945
And then just tighten it
down against the head.

00:02:42.945 --> 00:02:46.930
Now, if the hair
starts getting snarly,

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:49.440
you can comb it out a little.

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:49.940
OK.

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:50.439
Again.

00:02:50.439 --> 00:02:51.695
Adding into the left side.

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:00.060
It's going to go across the top.

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:02.740
But put your pinchers
through the hole,

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:05.870
cross them, reach for
that bottom piece of hair,

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:06.550
pull through.

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:13.260
OK.

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:13.956
Right side.

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:18.455
Add the hair in.

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:30.756
Pinchers through, cross them,
bottom piece, tug it through.

00:03:30.756 --> 00:03:33.365
You don't have to pull
hard to pull it through.

00:03:33.365 --> 00:03:35.940
The hair will slide through.

00:03:35.940 --> 00:03:38.460
Now you can see this
piece right here

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:40.622
is just coming straight through.

00:03:40.622 --> 00:03:42.080
So if I were to
hang onto this, you

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:44.140
can slide the hair
up and down on this.

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:46.210
This is where you
get the knot from,

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:48.705
crossing that hair over the top.

00:03:48.705 --> 00:03:49.205
OK.

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:52.630
Left side again.

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:05.310
Cross it over, fingers
through, pull it through.

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:14.830
Go to the other side.

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:17.010
Now I'm going kind
of slow, just so you

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:19.089
can see what my
fingers are doing

00:04:19.089 --> 00:04:20.820
as I'm going on the video.

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:23.810
But normally, this
is pretty quick.

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:36.740
Pull it, through, add
hair on the left side.

00:04:52.386 --> 00:04:54.467
Add hair on the right side.

00:04:54.467 --> 00:04:56.425
You're going to continue
this all the way down.

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:06.150
Now, you can see how this is a
little bit loose right there.

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:07.640
So if you just hang
onto this hair,

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:09.764
you can slide the braid
down tighter onto the head.

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:27.772
Left side-- fingers through,
flip it, pull it through.

00:05:27.772 --> 00:05:29.730
Can you tip your head
down just a little, babe?

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:32.680
That way this
time-- to the right.

00:05:38.924 --> 00:05:40.400
Pull it through.

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:42.440
I think it's tricky
only because it's

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:46.970
kind of different fingering than
your fingers aren't used to do.

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:52.400
So once you learn it, it's easy,
but it takes a little while.

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:54.050
OK.

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:57.210
This will be our last
piece on the left.

00:05:57.210 --> 00:05:58.200
Pull it through.

00:06:02.655 --> 00:06:05.842
And last piece on the right.

00:06:05.842 --> 00:06:08.810
Pull it through.

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:12.550
Now here, at this point,
you have several options.

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:15.370
You can flat iron
this last little piece

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:18.040
so that it's straight and
pretty if you are doing it more

00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:20.240
of an adult version.

00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:23.060
You can just rubber band
it and leave it down.

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:24.990
You can do whatever you want.

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:29.460
I am going to just
rubber band it.

00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:32.920
And then I'll just flip
this little end up,

00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:36.930
just for an added little
kid pizazz today for church.

00:06:40.430 --> 00:06:41.990
And there you have it.

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:45.060
And you just take
some hairspray,

00:06:45.060 --> 00:06:48.430
smooth the little fly-aways.

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:48.930
OK.

00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:50.080
Show them.

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:52.303
And there you go--
the knotted braid.
