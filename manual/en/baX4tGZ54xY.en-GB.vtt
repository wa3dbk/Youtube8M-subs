Hi again everyone this is Andy from wholesale-help.com.
In this video I want to talk to you about

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:29.160
a post that is recently appeared on the forum.
You are more than welcome to come down and

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:36.879
visit us on the forum by the way. The address
is wholesale that help.com/form. The URL is

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:41.790
in the description if you want to come down
and join in on the discussion. This post came

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:46.180
out recently and I thought it was quite interesting
so I thought that I would share it with you

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:53.040
and then make a few comments that I thought
were quite interesting. This post is by Bremain.

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:55.790
I hope I got that right...Bremain.

00:00:55.790 --> 00:01:03.020
Now he simply says “how do some make a ton
of money on eBay? I've always wondered how

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:07.670
some people make a decent living on eBay.”
I can understand if these people had a store

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:14.500
to begin with. They decided to sell on-line
as well to make extra money. Some people that

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:20.330
I've met said they do it all by themselves.
How exactly does one person make so much money

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:21.860
on eBay?

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:26.930
Well that is quite a generic question but
it got me thinking and as you can see down

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:32.490
here the reply is quite lengthy because it
just got me thinking about different ways

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:39.200
that you can make money on eBay. That is the
beauty of it. It is so diverse. You can make

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:47.050
money in so many different ways. So I just
want to share with you my answer to this post.

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:50.480
I think it is quite interesting. I hope it
will start to get you thinking about what

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:59.160
you can do on eBay. What the possibilities
are. I go to reply to Bremain. I say it is

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:03.880
kind of a tricky question really. It is like
asking the question how does anyone make money

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:09.640
doing anything? Everyone does it differently.
They have found success in different ways.

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:16.260
Sometimes by accident. Sometimes through careful
planning and careful execution. Some had just

00:02:16.260 --> 00:02:21.379
started on eBay as a hobby. Selling things
that are interested in as part of their own

00:02:21.379 --> 00:02:27.129
hobby like comic collecting or a custom car
builder.

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:32.950
So let me give you an example of a scenario
like the comic collector. The comment guy

00:02:32.950 --> 00:02:38.579
knows a lot about old collectible series of
Batman comics for example. He starts by selling

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:45.280
his duplicates and spares on eBay. He might
also mention to the form that he is a member

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:53.459
of the fact that he has comics for sale on
eBay. He posts a link over on the forum. Then

00:02:53.459 --> 00:02:58.560
the guy starts picking up comics on eBay and
realizes that he sees quite a few comments

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:03.900
here and there that he knows he can sell for
more than they are going for. Maybe he buys

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:13.760
a box full from someone garage sale and starts
to list them separately and grade them. Before

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:20.049
he knows he has so many auctions up that he
opens a eBay store. Before long he's got the

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:26.020
whole comic form visiting his shop on a regular
basis looking at what he has to offer. As

00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:31.390
well as the wider eBay community who are looking
for maybe certain types of comics to complete

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:35.180
their series collection.

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:44.609
Now as another example the car modifier. He
is always buying upgraded parts for his cars.

00:03:44.609 --> 00:03:49.989
Which means he has the original parts spare.
He decides to get some cash back by selling

00:03:49.989 --> 00:03:56.980
them on eBay. He's also a member of the specialist
forum for car modifiers. So he posed in the

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:03.579
classifieds section what he asked the offer.
He also keeps an eye on eBay. He soon notices

00:04:03.579 --> 00:04:07.919
hard to find parts that he does not really
need but he knows that they are a very good

00:04:07.919 --> 00:04:13.749
price for what they are and he could sell
it to someone in the forum for a lot more

00:04:13.749 --> 00:04:20.840
than they are listed because the as so hard
to get a hold of. Just like the comic collector

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:27.150
he soon realizes that he's specialist knowledge
of his hobby gives him an edge over the other

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:33.620
eBay buyers and sellers. He knows the added
value of certain items. Together with the

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:39.780
added exposure of the forum where he has an
audience of buyers looking for the exactly

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:44.870
type of item that he is selling means that
he can quit his boring job in the office to

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:50.780
spend his days buying more and more car parts
from breakers yards and other eBay sellers

00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:55.800
to then re list on his own car parts store
on eBay.

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:59.950
He gets a reputation on the forum as a good
guide to find parts that are hard to come

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:05.110
by. People ask him for things. He goes out
with a shopping list two of his contact at

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:10.600
the breakers yards and places like this. He
picks up all of the need with a nice profit

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:18.290
for himself. So these are just a few examples
of where your own interests and your own knowledge

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:28.410
can help you find a business that can make
a ton of money on eBay or online in general.

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:33.510
Make sure that you think about what your interests
are when you are thinking about starting a

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:38.950
business looking for something to sell on
eBay or just selling online in general.

00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:44.820
What do you know about? What is your specialist
knowledge? Everyone has something that they

00:05:44.820 --> 00:05:48.110
are interested in, something that they are
passionate about, something that they may

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:55.460
be used to spend a lot of time with. Everyone
has something you probably know more than

00:05:55.460 --> 00:06:01.380
85% of the population. If you have a real
passion and the real interest then you're

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:07.720
probably already an expert in that field.
So don't forget that sort of knowledge can

00:06:07.720 --> 00:06:15.250
be very valuable and very useful. When creating
a business online.

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:20.610
Personally I know about buying and selling
online because I love it. It is my passion.

00:06:20.610 --> 00:06:26.160
I've done it for a number of years. I've learned
by doing it. Researching it and living it

00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:34.341
and building it. Not by sitting in the classroom
being talked at for seven hours a day. If

00:06:34.341 --> 00:06:39.400
you have a passion for something it is much
quicker and easier to learn and more fun to

00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:46.770
work in that area. So if you're still deciding
what area to start in. Think about this carefully.

00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:51.390
You will spend some time developing your business
which certainly helps if you have an interest

00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:59.060
in this subject. Okay that is the forum post
that I wanted to share with you. Hopefully

00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:05.580
it has given you some ideas about what you
can do with your own eBay business is. I hope
