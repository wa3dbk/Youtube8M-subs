00:00:01.980 --> 00:00:03.180
School for me is scary.

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:10.740
Um, it's not fun. I dread going to school every morning and being in a classroom full of people

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:13.360
who do not share the same interests and values that I do.

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:18.280
It's scary because I don't know how people are going to perceive me when I dress a certain way or,

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:20.660
if I present myself a certain way to different people.

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:26.600
School is hard, but it will prevail.

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:27.820
I have faith in that.

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:37.220
We have had students throw food at us and just--we've had students who were on the football team

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:40.760
quit the football team because of bullying and harassment.

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:46.820
We've had, um, a problem with our Day of Silence because there was basically

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:52.320
some people who decided that it was right to deface our posters and yell at people

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:54.180
who were participating in the Day of Silence.

00:00:54.360 --> 00:01:01.900
I was involved in, uh, freshman orientation and I was actually one of the head ambassadors out of 150 students.

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:08.780
[Sniffles] I got my privileges revoked because some--parent of one of the kids that was in my group

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:16.100
called the school and complained that I was their leader and that I was not fit to be a student leader.

00:01:17.107 --> 00:01:18.467
So it's just really hard.

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.640
I got involved with GLSEN because I felt that the message they has is really positive.

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:27.540
And I want to help spread it around.

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.320
I started my Gay-Straight Alliance because I felt that students needed

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:33.960
to be aware that there were LGBT students

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:38.600
and to, um, to provide support for any LGBT student that might have needed it.

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:42.200
We've come a long way in regards to gay rights and equality

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:47.280
but I feel like there's still so much more that we can do, and I think our generation can accomplish a lot of that.

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:52.460
Someday, a kid like me, will not go unnoticed per se, 

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:59.360
but will be able to go through their school district and go through their lives without being nitpicked

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:00.620
or bullied.

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.500
There's no reason for you to ever be told that you can't do something.

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:10.120
And you just keep pushing, and pushing, and pushing until it happens because it has to happen and it will.

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.500
Thank you GLSEN supporters for helping GSAs all over the country.

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.720
Thank you GLSEN supporters for all the work you've done for LGBT youth.

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.440
Because of all your work, I am able to feel safe and happy.

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.240
Thank you for supporting GLSEN.

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:29.540
Thank you GLSEN supporters for giving me an opportunity to speak my mind and create a voice for myself and itself.

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:31.760
To create a better future.

00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:39.580
