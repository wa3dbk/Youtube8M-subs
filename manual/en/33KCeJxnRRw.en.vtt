00:00:14.405 --> 00:00:16.645
You will need an uppercase letter 

00:00:16.645 --> 00:00:18.154
and a number for your password.

00:00:18.154 --> 00:00:20.386
Don’t forget your enjin password, 

00:00:20.386 --> 00:00:23.171
farlands does not have access to it if you lose it.

00:00:23.713 --> 00:00:25.233

00:00:39.012 --> 00:00:41.311

00:00:41.311 --> 00:00:43.807
where you will see your account has been confirmed.

00:00:43.807 --> 00:00:46.037

You will now be asked to add your game character to your enjin account.

00:00:54.603 --> 00:00:56.741
The instructions will be explained in Step Three.

00:00:56.741 --> 00:00:59.278
If you did Step One, you can skip Step Two;

00:00:59.278 --> 00:01:01.394
Step Two is for people who already own an enjin account 

00:01:01.394 --> 00:01:03.536
who wish to register as a farlands member.

00:01:03.536 --> 00:01:05.233
Simply log in to your enjin account,

00:01:05.233 --> 00:01:07.395
click "Join Website" on the farlands homepage, 

00:01:07.395 --> 00:01:08.673
complete the captcha, 

00:01:08.673 --> 00:01:10.759
and click “Join the Website” again.

00:01:10.759 --> 00:01:12.414
Now that you have an enjin account 

00:01:12.414 --> 00:01:14.801
and are a registered member of farlands,

00:01:14.801 --> 00:01:16.693
open your client and launch minecraft.

00:01:16.738 --> 00:01:20.818
You will need to be in version 1.7.9 to verify your character.

00:01:20.818 --> 00:01:23.579
To be in version 1.7.9, 

00:01:23.579 --> 00:01:24.921
click “New Profile”,

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.933
choose "Release 1.7.9",

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.006
and name your profile 1.7.9.

00:01:31.761 --> 00:01:33.281
Click “Save Profile”.

00:01:33.703 --> 00:01:35.703
 

00:01:35.703 --> 00:01:37.633
Select the 1.7.9 profile

00:01:37.994 --> 00:01:39.034
and click play.

00:01:39.034 --> 00:01:40.118
 

00:01:40.118 --> 00:01:42.580
Go to multiplayer and click “Add Server”.

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.080
Enter the server address ‘mclogin.enjin.com’ 

00:01:47.476 --> 00:01:48.996
and then click “Done”.

00:01:50.204 --> 00:01:53.084
Now join the enjin authentication server.

00:01:53.084 --> 00:01:55.804
When you log in, you will be unable to move.

00:01:55.804 --> 00:01:57.753
The server will give your code twice 

00:01:57.753 --> 00:01:59.544
 before kicking you with your code again.

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:01.999
Each person’s code is different. 

00:02:02.357 --> 00:02:05.237
Do not try to use mine, it won’t work for you.

00:02:05.237 --> 00:02:08.462
Be sure to write your code down so you will remember it.

00:02:08.462 --> 00:02:12.020
Go back to farlands and enter your authentication code.

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:15.086
When you’re finished, click “Add Character”.

00:02:15.344 --> 00:02:17.584
Another way to add your character 

00:02:17.584 --> 00:02:19.633
is to go to your account profile and select

00:02:19.633 --> 00:02:22.366
the characters option on the bottom left of the screen.

00:02:22.366 --> 00:02:24.130
 

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:25.579
Click “Add Character”.

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:29.454
Select "Minecraft" as the game you are connecting your character to,

00:02:29.633 --> 00:02:31.393
then enter your code here.

00:02:31.441 --> 00:02:34.641
When you’re finished, click “Save Character”.

00:02:34.641 --> 00:02:36.053
 

00:02:36.053 --> 00:02:38.465
Your connected character will now show.

00:02:38.631 --> 00:02:41.431
Another place your character will appear 

00:02:41.431 --> 00:02:42.591
once it is connected

00:02:42.591 --> 00:02:45.377
will be the bottom right of your enjin profile screen.

00:02:45.377 --> 00:02:46.000
 

00:02:47.897 --> 00:02:49.337
Farlands is in 1.7.2.

00:02:49.337 --> 00:02:51.494
Be sure to restart your minecraft client

00:02:52.574 --> 00:02:54.734
and change your profile to 1.7.2 

00:02:54.933 --> 00:02:56.373
to play on the server.

00:02:56.373 --> 00:02:58.444
When you have registered and connected 

00:02:58.444 --> 00:03:00.010
your character on the farlands site

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.399
following steps One through Three,

00:03:02.399 --> 00:03:03.778
The game will auto rank you 

00:03:03.878 --> 00:03:05.638
blue member color in game.

00:03:05.638 --> 00:03:06.500
