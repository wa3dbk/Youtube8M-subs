00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.222
- We have a report of fuel theft
at the (name of) petrol station.

00:00:03.224 --> 00:00:04.924
- The suspect is heading towards Warsaw.

00:00:04.948 --> 00:00:07.148
- The theft was perpetrated
by the owner of a Porsche.

00:00:10.033 --> 00:00:10.672
Polish roads

00:00:10.696 --> 00:00:14.219
Today, the traffic department officers
had two Porsche cars on their radar.

00:00:14.243 --> 00:00:16.264
Officers Krzysztof Krzemiński and Ireneusz
Pietrzak from the traffic department in Łódź

00:00:20.439 --> 00:00:24.890
The first driver probably realised he had
been followed by an unmarked police car,

00:00:24.914 --> 00:00:29.314
which saved him from being fined for failing
to comply with the right-hand driving rule.

00:00:29.338 --> 00:00:31.838
- He’s being careful. We could have fined
him for the driving on the left lane...

00:00:31.862 --> 00:00:33.662
But then he quickly switched lanes,

00:00:33.686 --> 00:00:37.886
and avoided having to pay
PLN 100 and receiving 2 penalty points.

00:00:39.626 --> 00:00:43.210
But another Porsche driver will not go scot-free.

00:00:43.234 --> 00:00:46.734
the officer on duty informed all units 
that its driver is responsible for theft.

00:00:46.815 --> 00:00:50.158
- We have a report of a fuel theft
at the (name of) petrol station.

00:00:50.182 --> 00:00:51.882
- The thief is heading towards Warsaw.

00:00:51.906 --> 00:00:55.206
- The theft was perpetrated by
the owner of a black Porsche.

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.630
- Maybe you should drive to the toll
gates and reveal your identity.

00:01:00.454 --> 00:01:02.254
The incident seems a bit odd given that

00:01:02.278 --> 00:01:05.278
the estimated value of such a car
is around half a million zlotys.

00:01:05.302 --> 00:01:08.202
As a result, the owner should
be able to afford the petrol.

00:01:08.226 --> 00:01:09.926
- Adam, we’ll go to (name of the company)

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:11.150
as we are currently driving
along the A1 motorway.

00:01:11.174 --> 00:01:13.374
- Let other units, which are close
by, get there first.

00:01:13.398 --> 00:01:15.598
From time to time police
officers stop motorists who

00:01:15.622 --> 00:01:19.122
– instead of paying for the fuel –
drive away from the petrol station.

00:01:19.146 --> 00:01:22.946
- I have noticed the car. The driver
did not pull over. I’m in pursuit.

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:24.970
This 22-year old suspect was apprehended

00:01:24.994 --> 00:01:27.594
after a police chase that lasted
for a good part of an hour.

00:01:30.087 --> 00:01:31.718
But petrol theft perpetrated on the motorway

00:01:31.742 --> 00:01:33.742
is far from a perfect crime, to say the least.

00:01:33.766 --> 00:01:37.266
Three minutes after the vehicle
pulls out of the petrol station,

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:40.990
the toll gates staff is instructed to close the
gates not allowing the Porsche through.

00:01:41.014 --> 00:01:42.814
- The toll gates staff have
already been informed.

00:01:44.577 --> 00:01:47.838
When we arrive at the gates, the
driver is explaining to the other officers

00:01:47.862 --> 00:01:50.762
that his company was supposed
to make a bank transfer for the petrol.

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:51.810
But there is a problem.

00:01:51.834 --> 00:01:55.534
That petrol station does not
accept such payment methods.

00:01:55.914 --> 00:01:57.858
- I have contacted the petrol station manager.

00:01:57.882 --> 00:02:01.782
No such payment has been
transferred into their account.

00:02:01.806 --> 00:02:05.806
So please take the suspect back
there to sort things out.

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:08.830
Officers are taking the man
back to the petrol station,

00:02:08.854 --> 00:02:12.354
where he would have to pay
the PLN 380 for the petrol.

00:02:12.378 --> 00:02:17.278
Theft of items under PLN 400 does
not constitute a felony in Poland

00:02:17.402 --> 00:02:21.402
but a misdemeanour and
is punished with a fine.

00:02:21.426 --> 00:02:26.826
The officers decided to let the man off
the hook with only a 100-zloty fine.

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.450
The man has accepted it 
and the case has been closed.

00:02:34.864 --> 00:02:41.574
