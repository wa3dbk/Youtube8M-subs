00:00:01.789 --> 00:00:03.762
- [Voiceover] There are
two main types of stroke,

00:00:03.762 --> 00:00:06.490
ischemic stroke and hemorrhagic stroke.

00:00:06.490 --> 00:00:09.347
And in this video we'll
cover hemorrhagic strokes.

00:00:09.347 --> 00:00:10.867
Hemorrhagic strokes account for

00:00:10.867 --> 00:00:14.129
approximately 25% of all strokes.

00:00:14.129 --> 00:00:16.486
So let me just orient you to
what we're looking at here.

00:00:16.486 --> 00:00:19.644
Right now we're looking
at an underside view.

00:00:19.644 --> 00:00:22.708
An underside view of a brain.

00:00:22.708 --> 00:00:24.810
Because this view of the
brain allows us to see

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.167
the vessels that are
most commonly involved

00:00:27.167 --> 00:00:28.827
with hemorrhagic strokes.

00:00:28.827 --> 00:00:31.369
Vessels of the Circle of Willis here.

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:33.029
So what's a hemorrhagic stroke?

00:00:33.029 --> 00:00:35.003
Well, a hemorrhagic stroke is essentially

00:00:35.003 --> 00:00:37.778
when one of your blood
vessels in your brain

00:00:37.778 --> 00:00:42.671
springs a leak, and begins to
leak blood out of the vessel

00:00:42.671 --> 00:00:44.813
and in to the skull cavity.

00:00:44.813 --> 00:00:47.448
That's bad for two reasons.

00:00:47.448 --> 00:00:48.679
One, you're losing blood

00:00:48.679 --> 00:00:51.303
from within your cerebral circulation.

00:00:51.303 --> 00:00:52.788
And I'll show you on our friend here,

00:00:52.788 --> 00:00:55.680
if you start bleeding in to your cranium,

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:57.746
that blood leaking out of your vessels

00:00:57.746 --> 00:00:59.684
is gonna take up room, right?

00:00:59.684 --> 00:01:02.123
Your cranium is a closed space,

00:01:02.123 --> 00:01:04.166
so your blood has nowhere to go.

00:01:04.166 --> 00:01:07.405
So if you start bleeding in
to this closed cranium space,

00:01:07.405 --> 00:01:09.124
you're gonna increase pressure in there

00:01:09.124 --> 00:01:12.631
and you're gonna start to
actually compress your brain.

00:01:12.631 --> 00:01:14.406
Another thing to think about,

00:01:14.406 --> 00:01:16.461
all of that blood
leaking out of the vessel

00:01:16.461 --> 00:01:19.386
is blood obviously not
continuing through the vessel

00:01:19.386 --> 00:01:21.243
to downstream vessels

00:01:21.243 --> 00:01:24.006
that serve downstream parts of the brain.

00:01:24.006 --> 00:01:26.282
So you'll start to have
brain tissue die off

00:01:26.282 --> 00:01:27.966
in that distribution.

00:01:27.966 --> 00:01:29.800
And it gets even worse.

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.681
You see all this blood leaking out

00:01:31.681 --> 00:01:34.397
on to this underside surface of the brain?

00:01:34.397 --> 00:01:35.767
It turns out that blood contacting

00:01:35.767 --> 00:01:39.447
the outside of blood vessels
irritates those blood vessels.

00:01:39.447 --> 00:01:42.164
So when these vessels feel all this blood,

00:01:42.164 --> 00:01:45.417
they start to get irritated
and start to clamp down a bit.

00:01:45.417 --> 00:01:47.458
Let me show you what I mean here.

00:01:47.458 --> 00:01:50.163
Here's your blood vessel
as it normally looks.

00:01:50.163 --> 00:01:51.962
It's at a nice, wide diameter,

00:01:51.962 --> 00:01:54.400
and it's letting lots
of blood cells through.

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:56.164
But if blood is sitting around here

00:01:56.164 --> 00:01:58.382
on the outside of other blood vessels,

00:01:58.382 --> 00:02:01.621
it eventually starts to break
down in to it's components.

00:02:01.621 --> 00:02:04.276
And we'll call those
blood breakdown products.

00:02:04.276 --> 00:02:07.298
These products start to irritate
this normal blood vessel.

00:02:07.298 --> 00:02:10.236
So what do normal blood
vessels do in response?

00:02:10.236 --> 00:02:12.801
They undergo what's called vasospasm.

00:02:12.801 --> 00:02:14.844
They sort of close up a little.

00:02:14.844 --> 00:02:16.342
So you can probably immediately appreciate

00:02:16.342 --> 00:02:19.059
that not as much blood is
gonna get through this artery

00:02:19.059 --> 00:02:20.742
after it's become irritated

00:02:20.742 --> 00:02:23.679
and has spasmed and clamped down a bit.

00:02:23.679 --> 00:02:25.385
So let's say that all
of these blood vessels

00:02:25.385 --> 00:02:27.023
clamped down in response to

00:02:27.023 --> 00:02:29.321
irritation by blood breakdown products,

00:02:29.321 --> 00:02:31.376
and so they don't deliver enough blood

00:02:31.376 --> 00:02:33.361
to the brain tissue in their area.

00:02:33.361 --> 00:02:36.740
Then our patient would have
developed a secondary stroke.

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:39.398
So you really have to
be careful of vasospasms

00:02:39.398 --> 00:02:41.061
causing secondary strokes

00:02:41.061 --> 00:02:44.042
after an initial hemorrhagic stroke.

00:02:44.042 --> 00:02:45.334
So those are three ways in which

00:02:45.334 --> 00:02:47.503
hemorrhagic strokes are really bad,

00:02:47.503 --> 00:02:49.255
but what causes a hemorrhagic stroke?

00:02:49.255 --> 00:02:51.600
Let's look at two of
the most common causes.

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:55.002
What might cause a cerebral
blood vessel to just rupture?

00:02:55.002 --> 00:02:57.974
Well usually they have to have
an underlying weakness first,

00:02:57.974 --> 00:02:59.297
such as an aneurysm,

00:02:59.297 --> 00:03:02.199
an out-pouching of the blood vessel walls.

00:03:02.199 --> 00:03:04.034
So what happens in an aneurysm is that

00:03:04.034 --> 00:03:05.833
an area of the Circle of Willis,

00:03:05.833 --> 00:03:07.400
the vessels in the Circle of Willis,

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:10.697
actually balloon out like that.

00:03:10.697 --> 00:03:13.240
And they happen at a few places
more commonly than others.

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:14.738
They happen here, where I've drawn it,

00:03:14.738 --> 00:03:17.465
at the posterior communicating artery.

00:03:17.465 --> 00:03:21.836
They happen out here, in
the middle cerebral artery.

00:03:21.851 --> 00:03:25.198
They happen in the anterior
communicating artery.

00:03:25.198 --> 00:03:27.555
And they can happen here,
sort of near the junction

00:03:27.555 --> 00:03:32.000
of the internal carotid,
and the MCA, and the ACA.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.800
They could happen in other places as well,

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:35.635
but these are some of
the more common places

00:03:35.635 --> 00:03:37.874
that aneurysms can pop up.

00:03:37.874 --> 00:03:39.361
So I said that these aneurysms

00:03:39.361 --> 00:03:42.577
are weakened out-pouchings
of the artery wall,

00:03:42.577 --> 00:03:45.311
and they can be caused by
long-standing hypertension

00:03:45.311 --> 00:03:48.439
putting lots of stress
on these artery walls,

00:03:48.439 --> 00:03:50.958
or they can happen if you have a problem

00:03:50.958 --> 00:03:54.205
with your arterial walls
just for some genetic reason.

00:03:54.205 --> 00:03:58.192
So these aneurysms can
spontaneously rupture,

00:03:58.192 --> 00:04:00.559
or rupture if you get hit in the head,

00:04:00.559 --> 00:04:03.137
or if you get tackled,
or checked in hockey,

00:04:03.137 --> 00:04:04.217
or something like that.

00:04:04.217 --> 00:04:07.671
If you sustain some major
trauma, they can also rupture.

00:04:07.671 --> 00:04:09.910
So if one of them ruptures,

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:12.429
then all of a sudden
you'll start to leak blood

00:04:12.429 --> 00:04:14.636
out of your cerebral circulation.

00:04:14.636 --> 00:04:18.559
So that's one of the major
causes of hemorrhagic strokes,

00:04:18.559 --> 00:04:20.475
a ruptured aneurysm.

00:04:20.475 --> 00:04:21.041
And by the way,

00:04:21.041 --> 00:04:23.876
these are colloquially
called berry aneurysms

00:04:23.876 --> 00:04:25.439
because they look like little berries

00:04:25.439 --> 00:04:28.717
that have sort of developed
off of your arteries.

00:04:28.717 --> 00:04:31.689
The second major cause
of hemorrhagic stroke

00:04:31.689 --> 00:04:33.048
that we'll talk about is a

00:04:33.048 --> 00:04:37.395
arteriovenous malformation, or an AVM.

00:04:37.395 --> 00:04:39.816
So I'll just draw this for you down below.

00:04:39.816 --> 00:04:42.231
In the sort of normal
setup of our circulation,

00:04:42.231 --> 00:04:43.986
we have big arteries

00:04:43.986 --> 00:04:47.848
that then give off smaller arterials,

00:04:47.848 --> 00:04:51.098
they sort of divide in
to smaller arterials,

00:04:51.098 --> 00:04:55.101
that then go on and divide
in to smaller arterials,

00:04:55.101 --> 00:04:57.401
until you reach the
level of the capillary,

00:04:57.401 --> 00:04:58.716
which is super small.

00:04:58.716 --> 00:05:00.566
And also the level where gas exchange

00:05:00.566 --> 00:05:04.233
between your blood and your
body tissues takes place.

00:05:04.233 --> 00:05:06.927
On the flip side, on the other side,

00:05:06.927 --> 00:05:09.256
we have the other half of the capillary,

00:05:09.256 --> 00:05:12.785
which drains blood from the
first half of the capillary.

00:05:12.785 --> 00:05:17.082
And then you have a little
venule, which is a small vein.

00:05:17.082 --> 00:05:18.706
And then you have a vein.

00:05:18.706 --> 00:05:19.785
A proper vein.

00:05:19.785 --> 00:05:22.618
And that might empty in to
a really, really big vein,

00:05:22.618 --> 00:05:26.821
let's say the inferior vena
cava, or something like that.

00:05:26.821 --> 00:05:27.936
A really big vein.

00:05:27.936 --> 00:05:28.946
Okay?

00:05:28.946 --> 00:05:31.049
So the important thing
to keep in mind here

00:05:31.049 --> 00:05:33.415
is that blood in the arterial system

00:05:33.415 --> 00:05:36.270
is at really high pressure.

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:38.023
And I'll use P for pressure.

00:05:38.023 --> 00:05:39.184
High pressure.

00:05:39.184 --> 00:05:43.376
And as blood progresses
through the arterial system

00:05:43.376 --> 00:05:46.881
to get to the capillary,
it decreases in pressure.

00:05:46.881 --> 00:05:48.056
Okay?

00:05:48.056 --> 00:05:51.515
So when it's in the capillary
it's at really low pressure,

00:05:51.515 --> 00:05:55.775
and essentially the same
pressure as the venule side.

00:05:55.775 --> 00:05:56.959
And the reason for this is because

00:05:56.959 --> 00:05:59.641
our capillaries are
really thin and delicate.

00:05:59.641 --> 00:06:02.043
And if we hit them with
some high pressure blood,

00:06:02.043 --> 00:06:04.122
they would just rupture and explode

00:06:04.122 --> 00:06:06.200
and release blood everywhere.

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:09.300
And actually, it turns out that
that's sort of what happens

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:11.796
with an arteriovenous malformation.

00:06:11.796 --> 00:06:14.558
This whole system here isn't formed

00:06:14.558 --> 00:06:16.462
the way that I've drawn it

00:06:16.462 --> 00:06:18.239
in an arteriovenous malformation.

00:06:18.239 --> 00:06:21.681
What actually happens
is at the arterial end

00:06:21.681 --> 00:06:24.079
is that this whole capillary system,

00:06:24.079 --> 00:06:27.678
this whole capillary segment is bypassed.

00:06:27.678 --> 00:06:29.278
And you get arterials that are actually

00:06:29.278 --> 00:06:31.579
just directly connected to the small veins

00:06:31.579 --> 00:06:32.682
on the other side.

00:06:32.682 --> 00:06:34.876
So you just end up getting blood,

00:06:34.876 --> 00:06:36.860
at still really high pressures,

00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:38.765
going straight in to the veins.

00:06:38.765 --> 00:06:41.157
So that's really not good for the veins

00:06:41.157 --> 00:06:42.700
because they've sort of evolved

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:44.825
to deal with lower pressures.

00:06:44.825 --> 00:06:46.660
And now, without that
dampening-down effect

00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:49.606
of the capillaries, that
step down of pressure

00:06:49.606 --> 00:06:51.640
that's sort of afforded
by the capillaries,

00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:53.683
you get this high pressure blood

00:06:53.683 --> 00:06:56.852
going straight from arterial
system in to venous system.

00:06:56.852 --> 00:07:01.818
And this high pressure puts
this arteriovenous malformation

00:07:01.832 --> 00:07:06.338
at a high, high risk for rupturing.

00:07:06.338 --> 00:07:08.578
So you can imagine if that
happened in your brain,

00:07:08.578 --> 00:07:10.738
you'd end up with a hemorhhagic stroke.

00:07:10.738 --> 00:07:13.784
So, while AVMs can occur
really anywhere in your body,

00:07:13.784 --> 00:07:16.123
they often appear within the brain

00:07:16.123 --> 00:07:18.377
or within the central nervous system.

00:07:18.377 --> 00:07:19.456
And why do they happen?

00:07:19.456 --> 00:07:20.443
Well, they're congenital.

00:07:20.443 --> 00:07:23.438
It's due to sort of a defect
of blood vessel formation

00:07:23.438 --> 00:07:25.040
in development.

00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:26.723
So those are a couple of the major causes

00:07:26.723 --> 00:07:28.214
of hemorrhagic stroke.
