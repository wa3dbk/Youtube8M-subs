00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:12.720
You may not be familiar with the term fertigation,
but fertigation simply is an alternative way

00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:16.250
to fertilize your plants and lawn through
your irrigation system.

00:00:16.250 --> 00:00:21.680
A typically fertilizer injector system like
the EZ-FLO main line units have a tank where

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:26.989
concentrated fertilizer, commonly in liquid
form, is dissolved in water, then distributed

00:00:26.989 --> 00:00:30.079
in small doses with each watering cycle.

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:34.400
There's plenty of scientific research that
supports the advantages of fertigation as

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.950
compared with traditional fertilizing techniques.

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:42.090
Fertilizer absorption rates are greatly increased
when fertilizer is delivered in liquid form,

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.050
leading to healthier plants.

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:49.160
Environmental concerns regarding runoff are
virtually eliminated, and it's also safer,

00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:54.339
since fertilizer is delivered in micro doses,
eliminating exposure to harmful chemicals

00:00:54.339 --> 00:00:57.750
as you work in your greenhouse, nursery, or
garden.

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:03.140
The EZ-FLO systems that are available at Ewing
are very simple to install and maintain, as

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:04.559
you will see.

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.729
There are various sizes of the EZ-FLO main
line system to choose from.

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.620
Depending on your needs, the capacities range
from one and a half gallons up to the 25 gallon

00:01:13.620 --> 00:01:15.440
high capacity model.

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:19.210
Keep in mind that the larger the tank the
less often you will have to refill it.

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:23.160
The main components of the system include
the EZ-FLO tanks with a cap that allows you

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:28.070
to adjust the feed rate, shutoff valves that
you'll use during refills, and a ball valve

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:30.870
coupling that will be spliced into the main
line.

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:35.210
The ball valve coupling has two ports on it,
one for filling the tank with water and the

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:39.210
other for injecting the dissolved fertilizer
into the irrigation system.

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:44.060
Be sure to select the correct size ball valve
coupling to fit your main line.

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.680
The EZ-FLO tank can be mounted above ground
or in a valve box.

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:52.400
The important thing to keep in mind is that
the ball valve coupling must always be installed

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:55.360
at or below the level of the EZ-FLO tank.

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:00.990
It is also important to have an approved backflow
prevention device installed between the EZ-FLO

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.910
system and your water source to prevent contamination
of the water supply.

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:09.209
The first step to installing your EZ-FLO system
is to expose the main line.

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:14.019
Make sure to turn off the water supply, then
cut a section out for the ball valve coupling.

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:17.469
To make the job easier we suggest using a
slip fix on one end.

00:02:17.469 --> 00:02:23.069
Some EZ-FLO models include the slip fix option
pre-assembled for added convenience.

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:27.400
After the ball valve coupling is in place,
attach the included tubing to the barbed fitting

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.959
on each side of the valve's handle.

00:02:29.959 --> 00:02:34.900
Each length of tubing is five feet long so
you can locate your EZ-FLO tank in a convenient

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.469
place adjacent to your main line.

00:02:37.469 --> 00:02:42.370
The black tubing, for incoming water, connects
to the blue barb and the clear tubing should

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.510
be connected to the green barb.

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:48.909
Be sure to use the high pressure tubing clamps
which are included to secure the tubing to

00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:50.530
the barbs.

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:54.170
Run the other end of the tubing to where the
tank will be located and make sure the tubing

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:56.799
shutoff valves are in the closed position.

00:02:56.799 --> 00:02:59.999
The water supply can now be turned back on.

00:02:59.999 --> 00:03:05.310
At this point, screw on the blue and green
caps to the appropriate port on the EZ-FLO

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:06.310
tank cap.

00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:09.609
Then disconnect the shutoff valves from the
tubing.

00:03:09.609 --> 00:03:13.829
This is done by pressing what washer against
the shutoff valve while pulling the tubing

00:03:13.829 --> 00:03:15.150
out.

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:21.459
Next, remove the tank cap and fill the tank
with a EZ-FLO-recommended liquid or water-soluble

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:22.459
fertilizer.

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:28.060
Top it off with water so that there is no
air left in the tank, then replace the cap.

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:31.870
To purge any air that might still be trapped
in the tank you'll need to reconnect the black

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:34.019
tubing to the shutoff valve.

00:03:34.019 --> 00:03:35.999
Don't forget the washer.

00:03:35.999 --> 00:03:39.969
Then open the shutoff valve slightly until
you see a steady stream flowing from the clear

00:03:39.969 --> 00:03:42.230
tubing on the opposite side of the cap.

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:46.749
Close the white tubing shutoff valve and connect
the other side.

00:03:46.749 --> 00:03:51.109
Next, open both shutoff valves and check the
system for leaks.

00:03:51.109 --> 00:03:54.319
Once you've done this you're ready to dial
in the feed rate.

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:58.519
The most common setting is slow, but your
feed rate may vary depending on the type of

00:03:58.519 --> 00:04:02.269
fertilizer you used as well as site requirements.

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:04.480
Now your installation is complete.

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:08.799
Just water normally and the EZ-FLO system
will take care of the rest.

00:04:08.799 --> 00:04:13.060
