00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:02.060
Where is he?

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:04.320
Where's the major?

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:06.680
A few inches from your face

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:12.340
I've been such a fool Vasilli

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:16.140
Man will always be man

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:19.120
There is no new man

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:23.620
We tried so hard to create a society that was equal.

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:26.560
Where there'd be nothing to envy, your neighbor.

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:30.120
But there's always something to envy.

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:33.460
The smile,

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:35.460
the friendship,

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:39.760
something you don't have to appropriate

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.800
In this world, even a Soviet one.

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.260
There will always be rich and poor

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.860
Rich in gifts

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.280
Poor in gifts

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.160
Rich in love

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.480
Poor in love

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:10.060
Daniel isn't coming back

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:14.220
She's dead Vasilli

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.760
She was cut down by shrapnel

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:27.760
It was quick

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:29.760
I don't think she even saw it coming

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.320
She was on her way back to you

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:36.280
As soon as she had seen Mrs. Felie after the boats,

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:39.180
She was coming back for you

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.420
She was right

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.420
You're a good man Vasilli

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:49.320
I want to help you Vasilli

00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:52.160
Let me do one last thing

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:54.600
Something useful for a change

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.100
Let me show you where the Major is

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.100
No, no, don't do that

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.100
DON'T DO THAT!

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:40.580
