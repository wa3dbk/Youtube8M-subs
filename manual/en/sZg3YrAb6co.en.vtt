00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.620
one, two, three, four!

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:03.880
Rev up your engines!

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:15.140
It's time for the Scotty Kilmer Channel

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:21.340
today I'm going show you how to fix a
misfiring engine by swapping parts, now

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:25.420
this Camry has a check engine light on, and when we plug in a scan tool, we just

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:30.369
hook the tool into the scan tool port,
and then we read what it says, in this

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:35.890
case it says P0304, cylinder number four
misfire, so we know cylinder number four

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:40.270
is misfiring, but whole bunch of things
can do that, could be a bad spark plug,

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:46.539
bad ignition coil, leaky intake manifold
gasket, head gaskets it's starting to

00:00:46.539 --> 00:00:51.010
leak, fuel injection problem, all kinds of
things can cause it, but here's the

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:56.010
fastest quickest the easiest way to
check it, will just take the cover off,

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:02.410
pull it off, and we'll swap ignition
coils, we'll take off the number four

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:09.540
ignition coil, you just take the bolt off,
pull it off, and unclip the connector,

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.500
then we'll swap it with the number one
coil, and we got a little helper, Lucy's

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:21.189
going to help us fix it today, then we
remove the number one coil, and plug the

00:01:21.189 --> 00:01:25.380
number four coil in the number one, and
the number one plug in the number four,

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:29.829
since they're now in different positions,
if it shows a misfire on cylinder number

00:01:29.829 --> 00:01:35.110
one, you know that was the bad coil, because
we switched it for number four, so since

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:39.009
we put the number four coil on the
number one, and the number one coil on a

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:42.939
number four cylinder, if the misfire
changes and goes to number one, we'll

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:47.320
know we got a bad ignition coil, then you
take a car for a good ride, and if the

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:50.829
check engine light comes on like this
one did, you plug the scanner in and see

00:01:50.829 --> 00:01:55.390
what it says, and in this case it says
P0301, so we know the ignition coils

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.469
bad, that's what's causing the misfire,
so all we have to do is buy a new

00:01:59.469 --> 00:02:03.549
ignition coil assembly, and put it on the
number one where we had switched the bad

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:08.680
coil to, and it'll fix all our problems,
just pop it in the hole and snap it in,

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:15.400
and put the little 10 millimeter bolt
back in place, then put the cover back on

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:20.380
and tighten that on, and there we go,
no more misfiring,

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:25.450
so the next time your car starts
misfiring, why not swap coils around to

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:30.580
see if that is what's causing it, because
sometimes just swapping a couple parts

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:35.890
around, is the easiest way to diagnose a
problem in your car, and remember if you

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:40.060
have any car questions, just visit the
Scotty Kilmer channel and I'll answer

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:46.939
them as soon as I'm done recycling
myself
