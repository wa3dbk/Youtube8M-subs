Hey guys, it's Dunkey and 
I have a stranger video than normal for you guys today.

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.740
A just couple of hours ago here I got an e-mail

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:10.560
Now usually just Bill insert passage

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:14.240
But the title is kinda intriguing 
Please help me, league ghosts...

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:16.260
please help me dink

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:19.160
Now right away y'know I connected the dots

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:21.400
It's just type three different items to me.

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.560
With no relevance anything 
Abyssal Scepter a tampon

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:27.500
Deathfire Grasp and then Haunting Guise on the bottom.

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.020
He also attached a zoomed in of Abyssal Scepter

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:32.220
And I just look at for awhile

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:35.780
But I notice with some leniency there is aah... lettering at the center

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:37.100
It reads' DFG'

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:39.900
I figured he just photoshop that on there

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:42.720
But I downloaded it though images from the official website.

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:44.600
And the lettering is on there.

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.320
And, you y'know Haunting Guise that leads you to this..

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:50.740
And then top left you see 'SW'

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:52.160
And that's where he left it.

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:57.860
And I confi-, configured out with sight ward but I can't find any lettering on this one.

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:01.480
But later I took a zoomed in screenshot of that..

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:04.440
And I brought it in to a photoshop

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.060
And I zoomed in on it with the
ah, the magnifying tool.

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.640
And I do notice a little something here in the middle.

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:15.000
And thats, thats kinda creepy ha

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:18.200
Let's ah- Let's see if I can bring this a little better

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:20.380
What the fuck?!

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:39.120
[creepy music playing]

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:41.500
And I never playing league ever again

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:42.520
Oh, hey look at this!

00:01:43.540 --> 00:01:45.100
Girl: Play league with me!

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:46.020
Dunkey: Okay

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:55.300
[Dunkey Singing]

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:56.320
Wait a minute!

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:57.200
Wait a minute!

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:58.400

00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:59.720

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:01.540

00:02:01.540 --> 00:02:44.820
[creepy music playing]

00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:48.420
Just a couple minutes ago I actually 
got a call from ah, Bill

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:49.800
and I'm talking Clinton here.

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:55.320
He said ah, he said in a really kinda sinister voice said "you know to much".

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:57.980
And I said- I said Bill

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:06.180

Alright so where was I

By Dr. Seuss

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:39.520
Not even late can stop me-

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:43.500
[Gunshots]

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:53.520
uhm some ha- some guys broke into my house and starting shooting at me so I just jump out the window

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:55.240
Y'know I jump out the window and I-

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:59.020
I run down the ah, down- down the ally to the McDonald cause they have WiFi here.

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:01.640
And it's pretty ingenious move by me.

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.100
Cause now I can finish this match

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:06.680

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:25.740

Good thing I had my bulletproof vest on ha!
Oh, we lost, come on!

00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:42.560
There's only two shootings and I came back and relative amount of time.

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:45.980
I don't see why we lost this

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:48.480
It's a- it's a disappointment, it's a disappoint-

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:49.160
What is that?

00:04:50.240 --> 00:04:51.860
