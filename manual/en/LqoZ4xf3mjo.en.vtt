In this final clip, I'm going to show you
how to store your gum paste flowers. You've

00:00:04.379 --> 00:00:11.080
taken the time to hand-craft these special
flowers, take the time to store them properly

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:19.510
in a plastic container like this and wrapping
them with bubble wrap or even paper towels

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:25.830
and they'll store and transport very well
in here. They'll keep for months and if not

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:33.730
longer, if they're stored in a sealed plastic
container in a dry, cool place. You know,

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:41.350
cakes that are made that need to be in the
refrigerator will, actually moisture will

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:49.179
ruin and wilt your gum paste flowers. So,
if you need to store a cake in the refrigerator,

00:00:49.179 --> 00:00:55.749
it's best to box it and wrap it tightly in
plastic. And, even better, it's actually wise

00:00:55.749 --> 00:01:01.800
to transport the flowers separately to the
place or event you're going and place the

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:09.360
gum paste flowers on there. So, what I usually
do is I just sometime, if I have smaller leaves,

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:17.190
I wrap them separately and the same thing
for these little, fragile, filler flowers

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:27.580
that are more delicate. And I just tuck them
into the corners and using extra bubble wrap,

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:40.680
I put the bubbles down on top and just place
my roses so they're not on top of each other.

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:50.570
I cradle them with more bubble wrap. And if
you're doing a large cake, like a wedding

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:56.530
cake, this is definitely the way to go. It's
safe for traveling in the car and it'll keep

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:01.979
and that's how you should store your gum paste
flowers.
