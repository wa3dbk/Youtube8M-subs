00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:30.519
The Mazda MX-5 Miata is equipped with a naturally
aspirated 2.0-liter inline four-cylinder engine

00:00:30.519 --> 00:00:35.400
that produces 167 horsepower and 140 foot
pounds of torque (with the manual transmission).

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:39.300
All models can be equipped with either a manual
or automatic transmission, for those with

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:40.960
that inclination.

00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:44.760
The engine is detuned to 158 HP with the automatic.

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.460
The base MX-5 Sport gets by with a five-speed
manual, while all other models are fitted

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:59.739
with six-speed transmissions.

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:06.040
The official fuel economy estimates for the
2013 MX-5 are 21 city / 28 highway miles per

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:09.229
gallon (MPG) for either the six-speed manual
or automatic.

00:01:09.229 --> 00:01:12.180
Never mind what they say about more speeds
equalling better gas mileage.

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:15.600
The base five-speed manual is rated at 22/28.

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:20.430
We rolled up roughly 300 miles on our six-speed
manual-equipped True Red Club Edition with

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.030
the Power Retractable Hard Top and breezed
past the official mileage estimates, with

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:32.500
an average of 34.9 MPG on the Interstate highway
and 27.8 MPG combined with temperatures ranging

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.030
from the forties through the sixties.

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:55.329
The MX-5 delivered a 0-60 MPH time of approximately
7.5 seconds, with a bit of wheelspin.

00:01:55.329 --> 00:01:59.790
Needless to say, Miata owners don’t buy
the their cars for straight line acceleration.

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:04.049
They buy them to tear up the twisty bits,
and tear them up, it does.

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:07.950
The Club manual’s handling is enhanced with
Bilstein Shocks, a Limited Slip Differential,

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:11.910
a Shock Tower Brace, and a Sport Tuned Suspension.

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:19.070
While quite not a match for the factory unit
in the discontinued Honda S2000, the Miata’s

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:34.120
short-throw shifter is rather splendid.

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:43.410
The 
Miata Club’s exterior is enhanced with a

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:46.940
front air dam, rear diffuser, and blacked
out trim.

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:51.690
Along with our tester’s True Red, the Club’s
color choices include Crystal White Pearl,

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:54.870
Brilliant Black and Liquid Silver.

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:59.940
The Trip Computer is limited to Average MPGs
and ambient temperature.

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:02.780
The Miata can be quite fuel-efficient when
you’re not hooning about.

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:06.570
A ScanGauge would be a welcome addition for
the fuel concious.

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:08.130
The cabin is purely functional.

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:12.590
If you’re looking for niceties like leather
upholstery and heated front bucket seats,

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:14.780
you’ll want to order the Grand Touring model.

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:19.781
If you’re looking for an over abundance
of cup holders and glitzy infotainment, look

00:03:19.781 --> 00:03:22.220
elsewhere.

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:25.860
The Club model includes a basic six-speaker
audio system.

00:03:25.860 --> 00:03:30.079
The Grand Touring kicks it up with seven-speaker
Bose system.

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:33.699
Factory Handsfree Bluetooth is only available
in the Grand Touring model, as part of the

00:03:33.699 --> 00:03:34.950
Premium package.

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:40.560
You’ll find a solitary twelve-volt outlet
located at the base of the dash, alongside

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.070
the auxiliary audio input port.

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:47.290
There’s just 5.3 cubic feet of storage in
the trunk.

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:49.200
You’ll just have to live with it.

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:50.430
Find something else to take antiquing.

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:52.290
Or just go for a drive.

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:53.780
With someone you enjoy being with.

00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:54.960
(Or your dog.

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:58.650
It’s your choice!)

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:02.769
The power retractable hard top is a welcome
addition, delivering a snug-feeling cabin

00:04:02.769 --> 00:04:05.269
when the weather turns cold or the skies open
up.

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:10.650
The top operation is relatively speedy, simple,
and secure: one button up, one button down,

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:12.200
and one latch.

00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:17.329
Rumor has it that the Honda S2000 may return
to provide the Miata with some tough competition,

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:21.940
all the while Mazda preps the next version
of the MX-5 with a 2,200 pound target weight

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:25.630
and a potential collaboration with Alfa Romeo.

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:32.350
But for 2013 the Miata stands alone, as the
last standing truly affordable rear wheel

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:37.080
drive two-seat roadster in America ... proving
that you can still burn rubber with the top

00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:40.870
down, without burning gasoline or your wallet.

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:42.729
The Club Edition takes it up a notch.

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:45.000
It isn’t for latte sippers or cell phone
yappers.

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.270
It’s for drivers.

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:50.070
This isn’t the car you buy to show off or
for creature comforts.

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:52.939
It’s the car you buy to drive.

00:04:52.939 --> 00:04:55.569
Through the corners.

00:04:55.569 --> 00:04:56.569
Fast.

00:04:56.569 --> 00:05:01.189
Take a look at the entry prices of other ragtop
roadsters ... the Nissan Z is forty one thousand

00:05:01.189 --> 00:05:02.189
and change.

00:05:02.189 --> 00:05:04.669
The Porsche Boxster is forty nine and a half.

00:05:04.669 --> 00:05:08.439
The Mercedes-Benz SLK250 is a hair under forty
three.

00:05:08.439 --> 00:05:13.520
The Mustang V6 convertible is closest at just
over twenty seven.

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:16.889
The Camaro V6 convertible is over thirty thousand.

00:05:16.889 --> 00:05:20.919
The base Miata starts at under twenty four.

00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:25.240
And it delivers driving characteristics like
nothing else sold today.

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:28.240
Some folks still don’t quite get the Miata.

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:31.039
Those are the folks who are most likely to
have not driven it.

00:05:31.039 --> 00:05:33.669
At speed.

00:05:33.669 --> 00:05:38.650
