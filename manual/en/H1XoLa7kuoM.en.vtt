JACOB SOBOROFF: Hey, it's Jacob.

00:00:01.613 --> 00:00:04.315
Today we got MJ's new video, the
sharp-dressed men of the Congo,

00:00:04.315 --> 00:00:06.370
and Hero Cat to the rescue!

When did you get in?

00:00:13.522 --> 00:00:15.480
JACOB SOBOROFF: Guys, it
is so hard to believe,

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.837
but this is our 100th episode.

00:00:17.837 --> 00:00:19.670
We have been here every
day for four months,

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:21.850
bringing you the absolute
best stuff to watch.

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:23.850
We want to say thank you
so much to all of you

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:25.329
guys who keep coming back.

00:00:25.329 --> 00:00:27.370
Now, it's been five years
since Michael Jackson's

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:28.828
untimely death,
but the King of Pop

00:00:28.828 --> 00:00:31.050
has a brand new album of
never before heard music.

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.299
This music video
was just released

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:34.010
to coincide with the
album dropping this week,

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:35.980
and it's already got
almost 2 million views.

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:39.580
It features Justin Timberlake
in a kind of duet with Michael.

[MUSIC - MICHAEL
JACKSON/JUSTIN TIMBERLAKE,

"LOVE NEVER FELT SO GOOD"]

00:00:55.697 --> 00:00:58.280
Each of the eight tracks on the
album, which is called XSCAPE,

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.246
were actually recorded
between 1983 and 1999,

00:01:01.246 --> 00:01:02.870
and they were paired
up with a producer

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:04.290
to sort of
contemporize the music.

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:07.080
I love the homages to
MJ's iconic videos.

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:10.877
It's so incredible how
timeless his music is.

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.084
My name's Joe Bereta.

00:01:13.084 --> 00:01:15.680
I am visiting from the
source-fed offices, where

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:17.200
I'm the head writer and co-host.

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.950
Fair warning-- what
I'm about to show you

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.120
is slightly disturbing,
but mostly awesome.

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:25.480
So spoiler alert, you're
about to see the coolest thing

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:27.049

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:27.715

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:30.980
posted yesterday.

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:33.930
What you're seeing here is a
kid innocently riding his bike

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.820
in the driveway when, all of
a sudden, out of the blue,

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:37.980
a dog attacks him.

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:40.396
And you think you're about to
watch the worst thing you've

00:01:40.396 --> 00:01:42.440
ever seen in your
life until boom!

00:01:46.304 --> 00:01:47.970
Thankfully, the little
kid is all right.

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.845
He's just walking away
with a couple stitches

00:01:49.845 --> 00:01:51.337
and an everlasting love of cats.

00:01:51.337 --> 00:01:53.420

out something that we do,

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.609

JACOB SOBOROFF: I used to think
it was totally acceptable to do

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:05.480
my grocery runs in short
shorts and knee-high socks,

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:06.855
but after watching
this video, it

00:02:06.855 --> 00:02:08.600
sounds like I might need
to up my fashion game.

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.141
This short doc gives
a firsthand look

00:02:10.141 --> 00:02:13.332
at the Sapeurs of the
Democratic Republic of Congo.

00:02:13.332 --> 00:02:14.790
There are group of
blue-collar guys

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.690

cut of a good suit.

extraordinary men-- the

JACOB SOBOROFF: This is
actually part of an ongoing ad

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:38.450
campaign for
Guinness, which just

00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:42.132

doing extraordinary things.

But she also has
her own web series,

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.330
and it turns out she's
something of a gaming savant.

gaming, I have to tell you.

She's certifiably
terrible at gaming,

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:10.876
but she's made an
entire show out of it.

Lest you think all she
does is fail at Civ IV,

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:15.142
she also offers choice
words on life, love,

00:03:15.142 --> 00:03:16.100

favorite recipes of all time--

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:21.486

cereal-- Cinnamon Toast Crunch.

The bowl I like to use for
my Cinnamon Toast Crunch

00:03:24.340 --> 00:03:26.000

a blender versus an iPhone

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:42.600
was released, and I forever
wanted to blend everything.

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:44.820
It features destructive

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:48.120
of Blendtec, Tom Dixon, who has
been blending things for years

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.990

turn anything into a smoothie.
