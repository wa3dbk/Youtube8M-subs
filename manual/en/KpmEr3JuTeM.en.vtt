00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:29.070
You know the coolest thing about the Wii?

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:30.070
It had an identity.

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:35.100
Like, you could pick any major game for the
PS3 or Xbox 360…and if you didn’t know,

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:38.040
it’d be hard to tell which system it was
for.

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.040
You know?

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.620
They had similar power, similar games…similar
identities.

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:43.070
That wasn’t the case with the Wii.

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:46.480
You could always point out a Wii game, because
the Wii had its own identity.

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:48.780
It was actually kind of a throwback in that
way.

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.269
The Super Nintendo had an identity, the Genesis
had an identity…

00:00:52.269 --> 00:00:53.370
And so did the Wii.

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.280
So I rarely felt like I was missing out on
something as a Wii owner.

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:59.800
Until its late-life software droughts, I had
lots of cool stuff to play.

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:05.970
But even so, there were still a couple games
that made me covet my neighbor’s console.

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.470
Forgive me, Mario, I’m only human.

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:09.240
And one of those games was Mirror’s Edge.

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.570
The Wii didn’t get Mirror’s Edge.

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.300
It got Free Running, for the PlayStation 2.

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:15.200
Look, I said the Wii had an identity.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:25.150
Didn’t say it was always a good one.

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:28.420
So this is one of the many Wii games were
a publisher just said, “Look, we could make

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:33.020
an awesome Wii game…but that would take
ideas and resources, so let’s just take

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.200
an old PS2 game and add waggle, who cares?

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.340
It’s not like the Wii is the best-selling
console.”

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:39.780
“Oh, it is?”

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:40.780
“Huh.

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:46.600
Well, it’s not like…look, we’re the
gaming industry, alright?

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.310
Inexplicable decisions…that’s kind of
what we do.

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:55.140
Just get to work on that waggle, there’s
a box of PS2 games in the back.”

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.490
And thus, Free Running was born.

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:02.500
This is a crappy PS2 game from 2007, that
someone somewhere apparently actually thought

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.930
someone wanted to see again on the Wii.

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:08.160
Yeah, they were wrong, no one wanted to see
this game on the Wii.

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.439
And yet here it is, it exists.

00:02:11.439 --> 00:02:19.260
Despite being one of the worst games on the
platform…Free Running actually exists.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.340
So this is Free Running.

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.310
So named because once you play it, there will
be liquid running freely down your leg.

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.349
Also because it’s about parkour, or whatever.

00:02:28.349 --> 00:02:33.269
So you pick your character, from a cast of
compelling characters that span every sex

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:34.799
and ethnicity equally.

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:36.579
Boy, how thrilling.

00:02:36.579 --> 00:02:39.590
I can’t wait to see Skeet run.

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:44.810
So you go and pick one of these personality
bombs, you name your profile appropriately

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:46.980
and then it’s off to the streets.

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.519
Wait, sorry—it’s off to the gym.

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:50.800
For a five-hour f*cking tutorial.

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.230
And hey, don’t even think about skipping
it.

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:53.230
Skeet.

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:54.390
Because you can’t, it’s mandatory.

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:55.390
Just like death.

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:59.730
All you can hope is that you do it with grace.

00:02:59.730 --> 00:03:01.599
Free Running is a parkour game.

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:03.040
At least, it’s supposed to be.

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:05.700
To me, it’s more of a jump off buildings
game.

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:10.549
I guess Skeet’s just depressed about being
named Skeet, and she has always hated her

00:03:10.549 --> 00:03:11.549
parents for it.

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:13.989
Don’t worry, if you don’t like my story,
you can make up your own.

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:15.400
Not like the game has one.

00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:17.670
Doesn’t have much in the way of control,
either.

00:03:17.670 --> 00:03:22.950
Know how, in Mirror’s Edge, it felt like
you were fast and fluid, and free, and running?

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:25.459
Yeah, Free Running feels like you’re drunk
on a roof.

00:03:25.459 --> 00:03:27.849
It’s like Workaholics: The Video Game.

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:31.919
Only with that game, having these awful, drunk
people controls would make sense.

00:03:31.919 --> 00:03:36.909
In this game, they just make…anger, they
make you very angry.

00:03:36.909 --> 00:03:38.989
But you know the best thing about this game?

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:44.389
I mean, it looks and sounds like sh*t, it
plays awful…but they actually took the time

00:03:44.389 --> 00:03:46.519
to make the floors in the gym reflective.

00:03:46.519 --> 00:03:51.409
And look, the windows have light rays coming
through.

00:03:51.409 --> 00:03:55.290
That’s the most gaming industry thing ever.

00:03:55.290 --> 00:04:04.459
“Hey, this game’s nearly unplayable, but
look at those reflective textures.”

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:14.879
Playing this game now, in 2015…it made me
angry all over again, about how some publishers

00:04:14.879 --> 00:04:15.879
treated the Wii.

00:04:15.879 --> 00:04:19.750
Here you had this amazing platform, with a
cool controller that could make your games

00:04:19.750 --> 00:04:22.710
more precise than ever…and what do we do
with it?

00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:23.710
F*cking Free Running.

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:28.629
A couple years later, it’s even more unbelievable.

00:04:28.629 --> 00:04:34.370
This is a game, and a philosophy, that should’ve
been killed before it ever left the ground.

00:04:34.370 --> 00:04:38.960
Fortunately, survival is highly unlikely,
with that one.

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:43.910
And it will be for you, too…if you waste
your time with Free Running, for the Nintendo

00:04:43.910 --> 00:04:45.820
Wii.

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:50.680
Look, just stay out of this.

00:04:50.680 --> 00:05:05.160
Just let Skeet do what she has to do.
