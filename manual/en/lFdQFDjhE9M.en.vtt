00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:06.240
Anyone recognize this thing? Let me know in
the comments how many of you created one of these

00:00:06.249 --> 00:00:10.309
construction paper chains as a kid to count
down to Christmas. 

00:00:10.309 --> 00:00:12.940
And how many of you still make them today?

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:16.700
Well in Germany, the kids also count down to
Christmas, 

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:20.300
but it’s a lot tastier over here, I can tell you that.

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:37.160
Hey everyone! I’m Dana and you’re watching
Wanted an Adventure Living Abroad.

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:42.000
Christmas is celebrated in many parts of the
world, but the way people celebrate and the

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
traditions they have differ from place to
place.

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:49.920
In some cases this means completely different
traditions existing, while other times it

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.760
could be that a part of a tradition exists
in multiple places around the world, 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:01:00.140
but it's more popular or it manifests itself differently from one place to another.

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:05.320
I remember as a kid those weeks leading up
to Christmas were so exciting and charged

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:10.360
with energy. We’d make these chains in school
and then I'd bring it home and tape it up

00:01:10.369 --> 00:01:14.949
to my wall in my room. And every morning I
would wake up and rush to the chain, and rip

00:01:14.949 --> 00:01:18.689
off another one, bringing me that much closer
to Christmas.

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:23.669
In Germany kids also have something to help them
count down to the big day, and I’ve got to

00:01:23.669 --> 00:01:29.169
say, it beats my paper chain any day. Although,
I do have fond memories of it.

00:01:29.169 --> 00:01:34.600
Here in Germany it's the Advent Calendar.
There are 24 little doors -- one for each

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:39.400
day of December leading up to Christmas -- and
behind every door is a chocolate.

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:44.480
This was just one of many I could have picked
out at the store. At the front of most grocery

00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:48.880
stores there’s a section of these things
from the big chocolate companies. Then there's

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:53.780
often another section inside of the store
and yet another one at the checkout lines.

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:58.900
So kids have 3 chances to convince their parents
to buy them an Advent calendar.

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:04.469
Growing up I, personally, don't remember ever
seeing one of these calendars at the stores

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:06.689
in America or at a friend’s house. 

00:02:06.689 --> 00:02:10.220
And believe me, I would remember a chocolate-filled calendar.

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:15.140
No, the first time that I found out about
their existence was here in Europe. But I

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:19.760
have talked to an American friend, who told
me that she had one as a kid, but still, they’re

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:25.280
certainly not as popular in America as they
are here in Germany where every kid has at

00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:27.960
least one and sometimes more than that.

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:33.300
You can also buy these calendars from toy
brands, such as Lego. And then a little Lego

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:36.150
piece comes behind every door instead of a
chocolate.

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:39.930
Another popular countdown to Christmas tradition
here in Germany

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.610
is the Adventskranz, or Advent wreath.

00:02:42.610 --> 00:02:47.060
This tradition was started by the Lutherans,
but now it’s something that other Christian

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:52.389
denominations observe as well, but in America
it’s generally reserved to church, while

00:02:52.389 --> 00:02:56.960
here in Germany it's a standard part of at-home Christmas decorations.

00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:01.300
The tradition of the Advent wreath was born here
in Germany, so I guess it makes sense that

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:06.260
it would still be really popular here. You can
buy pre-made wreaths at the store, or you

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:11.239
can also make your own, which is what we did
this past weekend to show you one technique

00:03:11.239 --> 00:03:12.870
of how it’s done over here.

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:17.130
Calling it a wreath is a bit deceiving because
nowadays in Germany

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:20.860
 they can either be wreath-shaped or straight like this one.

00:03:20.860 --> 00:03:25.980
To make the Adventskranz, cut up and arrange
some pine branches, then decorate them with

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:31.940
some shiny ornaments a few earthy pieces like
cinnamon sticks and pine cones, and then some

00:03:31.940 --> 00:03:35.060
glittery tinsel here and there.

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:38.200
Place the candles on top, and it’s ready
to go!

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:44.099
Starting on the first Advent Sunday, which
this year is November 30, people light a new

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:46.739
candle every Sunday until Christmas.

00:03:46.740 --> 00:03:49.580
And that’s how the Germans count down to
Christmas!

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:56.340
So my question for you is, what are your countdown
traditions, and if you have one of these Advent

00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:00.020
calendars, weren’t you ever tempted to skip
a few days ahead

00:04:00.020 --> 00:04:01.900
and eat more chocolate than you should?

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:04.060

Claus.
