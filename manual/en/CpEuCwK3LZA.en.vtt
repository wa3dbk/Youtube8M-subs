00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:04.460
How Resident Evil Should Have Ended

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:19.120
(Growling)

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:26.580
Wesker...

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.900
You were behind all of this.

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:31.100
You're just like all the other things here.

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:32.560
A slave to Umbrella.

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:33.960
Smart girl.

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.580
I've always been with Umbrella.

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:36.540
You son-of-a..

00:00:36.540 --> 00:00:38.620
The things you mentioned are nothing.

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:40.000
Behold!

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:42.320
The ultimate life form!

00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:46.160
What the?

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.340
Sir, I- I don't know how to put this but...

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:52.460
we couldn't finalize the t-virus project.

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:53.940
Dang it, Phillips!

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.660
Why the heck not?

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:57.660
I'm in the middle of a
monologue here

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:02.370
We're simply over budget sir. These are
tough times and quite frankly

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.850
we've had to tighten the lab coat.

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.480
I mean between the plant monster and the giant snake...

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:12.360
and the sharks... I mean did we really need the zombie sharks?

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.920
Great whites aren't cheap!

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:15.580
Okay Wesker, enough.

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:17.960
Guys, please just give me a second.

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:24.120
(sigh) Okay, what about independent financing?

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:26.300
Hollywood loves zombies!

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:27.310
Right, they do.

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:30.080
And some hot-shot director
named Anderson is interested in

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:32.200
acquiring the rights to your life story.

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.140
Paul Thomas Anderson? I love his work!

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.960
No, a Paul W.S. Anderson.

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:39.600
Mortal Kombat??

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.700
NOOOO!!!!!!!!!

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:50.729
Jill, use it!!

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:53.540
Use it!!!

00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.460
Use iiittttttttt!!!!

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:00.260
(boom)

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:18.100
This is your last chance.

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:21.200
I think we've saved the world enough for one day.

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:23.680
Chris

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:24.520
I've always felt..

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:25.800
Shhhhhh..

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.220
I know...

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.620
(growling)

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:06.580
I'm just a lonely zombie.

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:11.340
i'm just a lonely zombie....

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:14.420
in this hallway

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:19.710
Wishing I could eat some brains

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:22.880
some brains...

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:28.670
I'm just a lonely zombie...

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:32.530
I'm just a lonely zombie...

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:40.260
Won't somebody tell me, where are the brains?

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:41.560
Brains.

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:44.480
I really need to eat some brains...

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:48.480
(gun shots)
