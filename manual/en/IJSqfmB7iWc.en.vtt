00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:16.480
The month of December is definitely the time for parties.  

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:19.480
There's office parties, Christmas parties, Kwanzaa parties, Hanukah parties, New Year's Eve parties

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:25.500
It's a great time to catch up with friends and share laughs with coworkers 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.000
but it's also the time when people are faced with a question,   

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.000
How many drinks can I have before it impairs my driving?

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Everyone seems to make up their own internal limit.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.000
I have friends that say two drinks are okay, 

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:38.600
or if they have food with alcohol it's okay, 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:41.700
or if they wait one hour before driving it's okay.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.000
The truth is...we don't know what the truth is. 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.000
So we've asked Dr. Bruce Campana to tell us.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Well, there is a hard and fast rule and we'll get to that in a minute.

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:53.500
But let's be clear first of all.  

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:55.500
There is no set amount of alcohol that's safe for everybody.

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:58.500
What it takes to make you impaired can vary from person to person and day to day. 

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:02.500
For example, how much you drink, how fast you drink it, how big you are,

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:06.200
whether you're male or female, whether you're tired, 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:08.500
whether you're taking medication.  

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:10.500
All of that makes a difference.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.000
And it's true, eating at the same time can influence how impaired you are 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.000
but you can still have a full stomach and be very impaired.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.000
So what does it take to get sober?

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:20.500
Well, there are a lot of myths out there.  

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Drinking coffee, having a cold shower, getting fresh air.  

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:25.000
All of that will make you awake, jittery, wet and cold 

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:28.000
but you'll still be impaired.  

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.000
It takes 4-6 hours to go from being moderately impaired to being sober 

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:33.000
and there's no getting around it.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:35.000
So what's that hard and fast rule? 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:37.000
It's this; if you're going to drive, don't drink at all 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:40.000
because you can't tell when you're impaired.  

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.000
And you never know how your body will react on that particular day.

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:46.500
So there you have it.  The fact is drinking and driving starts with your first drink 

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.000
because even the slightest amount of alcohol will change your driving ability.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Calling a cab, taking transit, designating a sober driver, 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:58.000
staying overnight, or calling your sober friend are your best options.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:02.000
