00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.200
CONGRATS!				YOU'VE WON SEK 1 MILLION

00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:15.120
Do you have any idea how expensive
schools are? Crazy expensive.

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:21.640
Just one year in school
costs about SEK 100,000.

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.960
It adds up to SEK 1 million
during your time in school-

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:30.160
-and you get it for free,
just like that. You're welcome.

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:33.640
Have you ever gotten anything
worth SEK 1 million?

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:38.960
No, you haven't. Me neither.
But actually I have - school.

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.120
There are families in this world
where seven of the children will starve-

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:47.560
-so the eighth one
can get an education.

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:51.280
There are kids
who take turns going to school-

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.400
-since they
can only afford one pair of shoes.

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:58.440
But you get this, for free.
SEK 1 million, you're welcome.

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.600
Do you get it?

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:03.880
Adults pay for your education.

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:09.320
Adults paid for my education
and adults pay for your education.

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:13.880
Once you start working,
you'll be paying for my child.

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:21.160
You shouldn't waste SEK 1 million
by being like "When are we done?"

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.040
You can't zone out in class-

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:29.040
-or stare at a book and be like:
"I don't get it. I'm out of here."

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.600
You should cherish
such a precious gift.

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:35.840
What do you
want to get out of your SEK 1 million?
