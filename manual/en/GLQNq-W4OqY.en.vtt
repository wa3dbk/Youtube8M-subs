Hello I'm Natalie and today's video is a back school life hacks

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:25.869
Video and I thought that it would be perfect because back-to-school season is around the corner unfortunately

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:27.550
And if you're wondering why I'm wearing a Sun Hat

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:33.279
It's because I'm trying to hold on to the little bits and pieces of summer that I have left therefore

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:35.170
I will reflect that in my outfits also

00:00:35.170 --> 00:00:36.160
I'm having a bad hair day

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:36.469
so

00:00:36.469 --> 00:00:42.309
like I said back-to-school season is around the corner so I decided to show you a few life hacks that have actually assisted me and

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:48.399
Just like getting out the door having breakfast ready, or just like finding my makeup and my hair pins and all this stuff

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:52.059
So I really hope this will help you not to mention this video is also or not to mention

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:56.049
Let's mention this video is also a collab with Karina Garcia

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:59.409
Karina does a lot of DIY decor

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:05.529
Videos and just a lot of fun DIY videos so if you are interested in that make sure you check out her video she's gonna

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:07.599
be doing a DIY school supplies video

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.110
which should be really fun her links will be down below in the description box and

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:12.850
also, if you do enjoy this video

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:14.890
and if you find yourself relating to anything at all

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:19.929
Make sure you give this video a thumbs up so that I know and also do this video a thumbs up just if you want

00:01:19.929 --> 00:01:25.089
More back to school videos that way, I will know if you would like them, and I guess that's it bye wait

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:29.859
I'll see you in the outro if someone who loves your sleep and is a heavy sleeper kind of like this

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:36.470
So if you find yourself in this situation

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:40.929
Of being late to class what you do is you put your cell phone into a jar and what this does is

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.569
Amplify the sound so that you hear it, and you're no longer late

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:48.699
Unfortunately this will interrupt a few pizza dreams, but hey at least you won't be late to class

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:55.630
This next life hack is for those of you who never know what to wear and your room kind of ends up looking like a tornado and

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:58.449
Buy it but not to worry and fear not I've got you covered

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:02.890
There's an app called Netrobe, which basically helps you categorise your clothes

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:05.619
And you can just take pictures of all the clothing that you've ever

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:11.919
Loved and felt really comfortable in and this is awesome because sometimes we forget what clothes we even have in our closets

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.899
But having it at the touch of our fingers and just scrolling through it in the morning will literally give you a lot of

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:19.179
Inspiration and just get you out the door

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:27.480
Are you easily distracted by noise kind of like this?

00:02:43.439 --> 00:02:46.669
Then have no fear Natalie's tips are here

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:52.970
Okay, basically you go on and you look up white noise on YouTube or anything like that essentially it's just silence

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:54.110
It's the bombest thing there is

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:58.939
and I used to have a neighbor that used to have a dog that would bark constantly and I could never focus on

00:02:58.939 --> 00:03:02.358
My studies, but ever since I learned this tip and incorporate it into my regime

00:03:02.359 --> 00:03:08.569
It's really helped me like just clear my head do my homework and get A's well, maybe not but you know what I mean

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:15.490
This next life hack is for all you social media addicts and don't mind

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:17.080
We all kind of are in this time and age

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:21.550
So it's kind of like when you're doing your homework and your computer just calls your name, and it's like Tumblr Pinterest

00:03:21.550 --> 00:03:24.039
Oh come on like get on here, and then you're like okay fine

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:29.170
I'll come back in a little bit and then something like this kind of happens one eternity later

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:33.309
Oh, my goodness Pinterest is so awesome and colorful

00:03:33.310 --> 00:03:36.070
But wait a second don't have I'm just doing a later

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:38.560
Obviously don't wanna get to this point so what you're gonna

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:43.330
Do is download an app called self control, which is just gonna not allow you to go on those sites

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:47.529
you basically block them off so therefore you can just do your work and get a

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:49.640
Yeah, yeah

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:53.890
Natalie what if I have bad breath oh darn I forgot my pencil again

00:04:05.270 --> 00:04:08.619
So bad what am I gonna do? Well I do have a few options I

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:15.729
Didn't want to give you guys the basics obviously using Listerine is you know I'm gonna help you out, but hey

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:17.730
that's not really appropriate and

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:19.870
the same thing goes for brushing your

00:04:20.540 --> 00:04:22.360
Okay, wait maybe none of those will work

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:27.910
But I do have this one where you just take a lip balm that has a really fruity scent and then it's just gonna kind

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:35.049
Of mask the bed scent so now you can ask that boy for the pencil and he's gonna be all charming and there you go

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:43.929
How many times have you lost your bobby pins in your life

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:47.469
I mean we have those days where we do our hair really quickly our hair is crazy

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:49.390
And we just need to find some bobby pins

00:04:49.390 --> 00:04:55.870
And we're searching all over the house under tables in our library on the floor in our cabinet

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:59.260
But I do have a simple solution to find all your bobby pins in

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:05.680
so for this quick DIY all you're gonna need is a metal strip you're gonna place it under your desk or wherever you desire and then

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:08.439
There you go all your bobby pins will be securely in one place

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:11.050
No need to tackle around to try to find them anymore

00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:17.770
We all have that problem of having way too much of something that we really don't need I know I do with makeup so instead

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:19.770
Of tackling through all your makeup in the morning

00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:22.210
Why not have a little purse filled with?

00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:28.329
Essential things that you need and trust me this will give you so much more time to focus on other things in the morning no

00:05:28.330 --> 00:05:32.469
Time for breakfast no problem, this recipe is really easy it's super delicious

00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:37.150
And it's also really healthy and quick to make in the morning or in the night before so what you're gonna

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:44.139
Do is you're gonna put some coconut milk into maybe two tablespoons of chia seeds, and chia seeds are super nutritious

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:46.030
They're really filling then we're gonna

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:50.709
Do is you're gonna put that in the refrigerator for maybe an hour or you could leave it the night before and you?

00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:58.389
Next morning you could add absolutely anything you want. I like to add bananas. I also enjoy adding peaches coconut flakes

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:02.020
blueberries and do anything else on top I

00:06:02.870 --> 00:06:04.420
Really like to add a little cherry on top

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:08.140
I think it looks so pretty and also if you don't have time to eat it at home

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:13.119
Then you can also just take a school and its really simple to eat and its really refreshing as well

00:06:13.460 --> 00:06:16.989
