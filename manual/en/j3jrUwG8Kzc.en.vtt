Hi, my name is Kevin, and on behalf of Expert
Village, I'm going to talk to you about flush

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:08.630
trim routing. What flush trim routing does
is it takes two boards, and it makes them

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:14.960
in the same plane by having a bit, and we've
got a top bearing, and a bottom bearing bit,

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:22.330
but what happens is, the piece that you're
keeping, the bearing rides along that piece

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:29.001
of wood and then the cutter head here makes
the other piece of wood in the same plane

00:00:29.001 --> 00:00:33.649
as that. So it shaves away whatever is proud
of this piece of wood that the bearing is

00:00:33.649 --> 00:00:38.629
running on, and cuts it away. And what you
have a top and a bottom bearing for, is really

00:00:38.629 --> 00:00:43.120
just depends on, is it the top piece of wood
or the bottom piece of wood that needs to

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:47.920
be cut. With our piece here, we want to cut
the bottom piece here, which you can see is

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:53.629
proud of this piece, so we want to rout that
away. So generally, you want to use a top

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:57.859
bearing bit, and then the bearing is running
along the top piece here, and it's going to

00:00:57.859 --> 00:01:03.210
shave away all the material below that we
want gone. Sometimes it's just as simple as

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.579
flipping the piece around and then using the
bottom bearing bit, but sometimes, like on

00:01:07.579 --> 00:01:11.229
big tables, where it's really hard to flip
over the piece, you're really going to have

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:14.390
to, you're really going to need these two
different bits so that you can adjust the

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.620
bit a lot easier than it would take to get,
sometimes as many as four people to flip a

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:23.369
really big heavy table top over to do a profile
or a flush trim as we're going to do right

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:28.359
here. And so since we need a top bearing bit,
what we're going to do, the way you set that

00:01:28.359 --> 00:01:34.240
up, is you take this, and with this router
the base spins, and what you want to do is

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:38.729
you want to get it to where the cutter head
is out, along with the bearing, and you want

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:44.770
to put it on here and you want to get down,
and you want to make sure that your cutter

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:50.189
head is cutting deep enough, and we've got
it cutting just deep enough. You want as little

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:54.950
hanging out as possible, just enough to do
the job. That way all the weight and everything

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:59.650
is centered up here. So just enough to get
the job done, and once it's there, which it

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:05.850
is, we're going to flip this down so that
it's locked in place, and now we'll start

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:27.280
the router and we'll make the cut.

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:32.330
Okay, we made the cut and we've got both pieces
exactly on the same plane, we routed this

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:37.350
bottom piece flush to this top one here which
is why it's called flush trimming. And, to

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:42.530
the touch, you can't even tell where the two
pieces are meeting, because it's been cut

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:49.170
so well. When you're doing the cutting, always
make sure you've got hearing, eye, and respiratory

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.030
protection. And also when you're routing these
pieces make sure you're clamping down really

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:57.280
tight and really solid because you don't want
the piece moving around on you and coming

00:02:57.280 --> 00:03:00.920
loose and messing up your cut. So make sure
you're fastened down really, really tight.
