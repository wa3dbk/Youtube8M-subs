Welcome to the Mommy and Gracie Show, it's
Mommy's Doll Corner time! So I went shopping

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:13.020
on the Barbie Collector site, when I was not
feeling well, because as we pointed out in

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:18.060
other videos, that's what I do - I go shopping,
they really shouldn't let me have my iPad.

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:25.539
So I'm taking white tissue off of something
that I got. I ordered two really cool things

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:32.309
that are not gonna come until July, but I
ordered this and it came right away, and it

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:44.030
is the Barbie Look City Shine - the new dolls
are out, and I flipped out over her. Bask

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:53.510
in the glory of this amazingness. Amazing
amazing amazing. This is, let's see what it

00:00:53.510 --> 00:01:00.579
says on the back. So it says, she lives life
joyously and always fashionably. She models

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:05.059
the perfect look and that unstoppable attitude
wherever she goes. Stylishly Stunning Barbie

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:09.299
doll's closet contains quintessential ensembles
for every event. No matter how bright the

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:13.680
party, our brilliant Barbie out-shines the
crowd. City Shine Barbie doll wears a bright

00:01:13.689 --> 00:01:19.119
red metallic sleeveless blouse with black
slim pants. She is definitely in the Barbie

00:01:19.119 --> 00:01:24.630
Look collection, and I just loved it because
she's got a bob. She's got a short little

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:33.800
bob haircut, I mean c'mon. So let me get her...
ah, gosh, I kinda don't wanna take her out

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:40.020
of the box, but - cause she's packaged so
nicely. My other Barbie Look dolls are all

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:46.840
still in their boxes. I kinda feel like I'm
gonna keep her in there guys, I sorry, I sorry,

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:50.130
but I will try to be able to get you close
up looks here.

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:57.850
C'mon, c'mon earring. Alright, that earring
is stuck there. So I will try to get you close-ups

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:08.610
without glare. So ooh... alright. C'mon camera,
there you go. I love her hair. It's different,

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:14.550
you know it's longer to the one side than
mine is, and in the picture though - in the

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:21.610
picture it was like totally rockin'. Totally
totally totally rockin', The execution on

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:25.620
the doll though is pretty good, I have to
say. Realistically speaking, they did a pretty

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:30.660
good job. Looking at those earrings, they
are fierce, is the only word I could come

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:37.950
up with. I love her eyes. Look at those eyes,
man. Look at that smokey eye. And of course

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:43.050
she has eyelashes, but she has something stuck
in one eyelash I think. That is gonna make

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:49.930
me crazy. And I loved this red tunic top,
like it's got the asymmetrical hem, and then

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:57.870
she's just got the black skinny pants and
this ocol bag that goes with her - with her

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:04.010
earrings. Of course the plastic band holding her
in is really messin' up the whole look for

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:12.400
me. She does come with a stand, but like I
said, right now all my City Style and City Shine Barbies

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:17.060
are still in their boxes, and I don't kinda
wanna undo that, especially with all the construction

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:23.680
going on. Not until I can display them somewhere where they're not gonna get super dusty all the time. And

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:29.780
she's got sort of plain black shoes going
on. These are the other City Shine Barbies

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:37.880
that they've just released, I really really really
love this one right here, and this one right

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:43.850
here. I'm just very worried about what the
execution of that hair is going to be like,

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:50.380
so I have to go check out some other videos,
see if like Jason Robert Keefe maybe got one,

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:56.020
cause I know he collects a lot of the some
Barbies that I do, and see if he got that

00:03:56.020 --> 00:04:01.700
one, and yeah, see if the hair worked out.
But I think they did a great job on this hair,

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:08.020
I really really do, and I really really like
her. I'm so happy - oops, hello, hello camera.

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:12.930
I am so happy with her, I really am. I love
her, and I think she will look - this one

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:18.000
is gonna look better out of the box because
this band is just messing up her - the whole

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:24.780
look is getting ruined by the plastic band
around her waist. But I look at her cuff bracelet

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:32.780
and everything, ahh! Love, love, love, love,
love Barbie. The Barbie look, you know, Barbie

00:04:32.780 --> 00:04:36.700
Collector Black Label, The Look, whatever
you want to call them dolls, I totally love

00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:41.100
them. SO thank you so much for watching and
hope you enjoy Mommy's Doll Corner, I have
