00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:36.660
Last year, I won my second world title and
it was a pretty amazing year.

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.000
I won 4 grand slam events.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:50.600
This year, at the beginning of the women's
tour was at Hawaii, Pipeline.

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:55.339
I won there, it was my second time that I
won.

00:00:55.339 --> 00:00:58.910
It's a place that everybody wants to win.

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:04.989
It was such a good vibrations and good feelings,
I was with my friends.

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:12.600
After Hawaii I travelled with Riptide magazine
to the experiment trip to Indonesia.

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.720
It was pretty fun because I was with the best
bodyboarders in the world.

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:22.020
We had so many problems in the trip but it
still was fun and was a good experience travelling

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:23.869
with the guys.

00:01:23.869 --> 00:01:30.360
I was in Australia for 2-3 Months and I got
so many good waves.

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:36.020
I saw so many Kangaroos.

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:43.319
The second stop was in Antofagasta.

00:01:43.319 --> 00:01:47.500
I was in 7th place and it was my worst result.

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:56.670
I think I was pretty tired travelling, I was
travelling for about 5 years without coming

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.100
home.

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:05.320
I won the the Sintra portugal Pro, and this
is my trophy.

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:13.770
And now I am in the lead of the ranks.

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:15.810
Anything can happen.

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:21.610
The next episode I will talk in Rio, and I
want to know what you want to see in Rio that

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:22.610
