Hi! My name is Dan and I’m here with Expert
Village. Today I’m going to talk about different

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:13.009
surfaces to build your fire on. You can use
a fire pan; in this case, it’s a small cookie

00:00:13.009 --> 00:00:25.570
tray, and build your fire right out of the
tray. This is a good technique if you want

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:30.460
to minimize your impact wall building a fire,
as it doesn’t scar the ground and at the

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:37.399
end of your fire, when it’s completely out,
you can scatter the ashes. Another thing you

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:43.469
can do is dig a small fire pit. It's handy
to have a trowel to do this, or you can use

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:49.749
the heel of your boot or your hands. You want
to find ground with as little organic material

00:00:49.749 --> 00:01:01.579
in it as possible, as the organic material
will burn. While digging your fire pit,

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:06.820
you want to place all the inorganic soil in
a pile, so you can save it for later when

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:19.750
you’re going to have to cover up the remain
of your fire.

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:34.229
Be careful to remove all the roots and organic
material and put them away from your file.

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:43.990
Fire pits are typically round and often times
you can dig a little rut into the side of

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:48.970
one, which will help increase airflow in the
beginning stages of your fire and keep your

00:01:48.970 --> 00:02:02.049
coals running hotter once your fire is actually
going. If you’re in an area that has a premade

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:07.130
fire ring, that’s always the best choice
to use, as it had always been impacted and

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:13.570
therefore you’ll be able to minimize your
impact. If you’re going to build a pit fire,

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:18.790
it’s nice to line with stones. You want
to be careful not to use stones that have

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:25.060
come out of a river or have been submerged,
as when you heat them up, they have a tendency

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.260
to pop or explode, and they can send many
sharp fragments in many directions.
