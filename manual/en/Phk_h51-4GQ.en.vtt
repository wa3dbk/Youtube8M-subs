00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.501
Hi, we’re on Netbooknews.it
 and this is the Kobo Mini video-review.

00:00:10.793 --> 00:00:14.397
This is one of the new eReaders
 sold in the Mondadori Libraries,

00:00:14.397 --> 00:00:19.139
 it’s the cheapest of this series, only 79 Euros

00:00:19.139 --> 00:00:24.706
 and by now it’s the smallest eReader available in Italy.

00:00:24.706 --> 00:00:29.154
Its screen has a diagonal of just 5 inch, so it’s really portable.

00:00:29.154 --> 00:00:32.723
The weight is low too, about 130 grams,

00:00:32.723 --> 00:00:39.949
 its size is similar to a wallet or half a book.

00:00:39.949 --> 00:00:43.797
It’s small and compact, 
but it allows to save more than 1000 books,

00:00:43.797 --> 00:00:49.503
 which can be downloaded directly from PC 
using the micro-USB port on the bottom.

00:00:49.503 --> 00:00:54.467
No page-turning buttons, 
the whole is done through the touch interface.

00:00:54.467 --> 00:01:01.072
The screen is E-Ink, but not the Pearl type used in the latest eReaders,

00:01:01.072 --> 00:01:04.648
 that’s just because there isn’t a E-Ink Pearl of this size yet.

00:01:04.648 --> 00:01:09.263
The screen is Vizplex, a little older technology.

00:01:09.263 --> 00:01:14.362
But as it turned out, it’s up to the situation.

00:01:14.362 --> 00:01:20.060
Kobo Mini is a cheap device, 
but construction quality and design are great.

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.164
No crackling, it’s solid, well-balanced and stable.

00:01:24.164 --> 00:01:29.933
The rear plate, silver this time, can be changed with other colors.

00:01:29.933 --> 00:01:33.004
There’s a total black version too.

00:01:33.004 --> 00:01:37.830
The graphics interface and features 
are the same of others Kobo eRaders,

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:39.623
and I have to say that despite dimensions,

00:01:39.623 --> 00:01:42.842
 the interaction with all the options is good.

00:01:42.842 --> 00:01:49.603
Books can be bought also from the on-line shop, 
using the built-in WI-FI.

00:01:49.603 --> 00:01:55.420
Kobo got us used to customize the graphics interface 
and reading experience.

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:01.155
Kobo mini has all these options in typical menus.

00:02:01.155 --> 00:02:05.900
In this model, as never before, 
the chance to customize is essential,

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:09.681
 to change font’s type and size, margins, spacing and so on.

00:02:09.681 --> 00:02:14.746
Most of all, on Kobo Mini justification and margins become really important,

00:02:14.746 --> 00:02:21.248
which if set to the minimum give the display
 a sort of full-screen aspect,

00:02:21.248 --> 00:02:24.886
to make up, at least partly, for the screen’s size.

00:02:24.886 --> 00:02:30.451
I have to say that I’m pleasantly surprised
 by the comfort of this little display

00:02:30.451 --> 00:02:35.020
and I have to strike a blow for the Vizplex panel,

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:41.676
 ‘cause in this model is good and you won’t miss the E-Ink Pearl.

00:02:41.676 --> 00:02:44.397
But things are different with pdf,

00:02:44.397 --> 00:02:51.669
actually it isn’t comfortable to read this kind of documents
on this small screen

00:02:51.669 --> 00:02:56.498
For example, if we open a typical document formatted for A4,

00:02:56.498 --> 00:03:02.128
 we need to use the zoom to have a better view

00:03:02.128 --> 00:03:07.598
and then move into the document every time…

00:03:07.598 --> 00:03:10.011
… so it isn’t the best from this point of view…

00:03:10.011 --> 00:03:11.738
The same is for comics.

00:03:11.738 --> 00:03:19.515
Kobo Mini supports cbz and cbr, 
but the same of pdf goes for these formats:

00:03:19.515 --> 00:03:27.513
uncomfortable zoom and scroll, needed to read on this small screen.

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:34.476
Let me say that comics and pdf aren’t really made for this eReader,

00:03:34.476 --> 00:03:40.652
 but still we have all the typical features of Kobo Readers:

00:03:40.652 --> 00:03:46.377
 built-in dictionary, the chance to add notes, highlight,

00:03:46.377 --> 00:03:52.349
 share contents on social networks using the built-in Facebook contact.

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:56.403
And there are other exclusive features, only on Kobo devices,

00:03:56.403 --> 00:04:00.127
 like Reading Life which gives statics on our reading

00:04:00.127 --> 00:04:05.158
and awards when you achieve certain goals,
 it’s a real nice thing;

00:04:05.158 --> 00:04:10.187
 there are also the Extras, 
where we have the browser

00:04:10.187 --> 00:04:17.102
and the chance to hand-write notes using the small panel.

00:04:17.102 --> 00:04:20.529
Kobo Mini is, from the first moment, easy to use,

00:04:20.529 --> 00:04:23.784
 you’ll immediately love the small format

00:04:23.784 --> 00:04:28.466
 and , at least in my case, prefer it to other bigger eReaders

00:04:28.466 --> 00:04:30.190
during the everyday life.

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:34.237
I’d suggest you to buy it if you usually read outdoor,

00:04:34.237 --> 00:04:39.994
 sitting on tram or train, while going to work… 
...for short reading sessions.

00:04:39.994 --> 00:04:42.899
On the other hand, if you’re looking for your first eReader

00:04:42.899 --> 00:04:48.682
and you don’t know exactly what kind of formats you’re going to read…

00:04:48.682 --> 00:04:51.999
… well, maybe you should still go with a typical 6-inch,

00:04:51.999 --> 00:04:56.693
keeping under 100 Euros there are two great products:

00:04:56.693 --> 00:05:01.246
 Kobo Touch and Kindle 4.1

00:05:01.246 --> 00:05:03.855
Ok, that’s all.
 For details on Kobo Mini,

 for more technical considerations I couldn’t do in this video,
