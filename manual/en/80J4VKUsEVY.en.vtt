00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:09.800
Was Roto designed to be an 
iPhone game from the get go?

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.900
The idea for Roto was with 
me for a very long time,

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:18.370
but I never found the 
right media to release it.

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:21.940
So only when the iPhone 
came around, I thought,

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.750
that's perfect for the iPhone.

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:28.020
And then I decided to design the
details and develop the game. 

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:30.900
Because I think it needs 
the haptical touch of 

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:32.380
turning these wheels.

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:35.210
And you don't want 
to do that on a PC, 

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.400
but you want to do 
that on the iPhone. 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:40.740
And I think it's the 
ideal outlet for it, 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.650
and that's why it's 
on the iPhone now. 

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:45.850
I mean, Roto is 
not a board game. 

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:47.890
At least I wouldn't 
implement it like this. 

00:00:48.090 --> 00:00:49.940
It needs an electronic platform. 

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:52.670
And it is a very light 
and addictive game

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:55.420
and therefore it needs 
a light platform. 

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:56.990
The iPhone is ideal, yes. 

00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.500
Do you play your own games?

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:01.960
Well, of course I play 
my own games, but, 

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:04.520
probably different to 
other people because 

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:09.160
when we develop games it 
needs a lot of play tests.

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.700
Once the game is being 
published then for me 

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:14.040
it's kind of an old game because 

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:15.900
I've developed it 
a few years ago. 

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:18.310
So usually, when the game 
comes out and is available

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:19.750
for other players 
who then play it, 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.680
I will be on to the next 
games for the future. 

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:25.970
I'm playing everyday, 
but I'm mostly playing, 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:27.370
of course, the new designs,

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:30.200
and the games I'm finetuning 
and bringing to release.

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.000
What do you look for 
in a game? 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:36.610
If I play a social game 
with other people, 

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:39.910
then I would expect that 
the game is really a platform,

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:44.140
so that I can have a very 
stimulating and exciting time 

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:45.110
with the other players.

00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:47.720
That means, I want an 
easy access to the game, 

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:49.380
the game maybe 
not too long, 

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:52.720
and the game being simple 
enough so that I can 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.140
actually play a good 
part in the game 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:56.900
and not have to 
administer the game. 

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:01.090
If I look at electronic 
games, particularly 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:04.570
solitaire playing games, 
like our Roto, 

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:06.980
then of course I look 
much more for

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:10.280
a very exciting and 
challenging game play. 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.020
To do better every 
time and to 

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:16.550
have just something 
that stimulates me. 

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:19.850
Manipulating and going on and 
trying to do better every time.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000
What are the things that make
a game like Roto addictive?

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:29.830
Yeah, I think in Roto, we have 
a very simple game play.

00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:32.610
But nevertheless, it is 
something that you can 

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.100
play on many levels 
of experience. 

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:37.030
So you can play quite simple 
and straight forward.

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:39.720
Or, when you play it 
more often, you will see 

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:42.930
how you play it better and 
what you actually can do 

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:44.600
to get many more points. 

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:46.970
Roto is a game which,

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.360
literally, only takes a 
minute every level. 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.750
So it's very, very easy to play 
in all situations on the iPhone.

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:55.790
You advance from one 
level to the next level. 

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:58.720
But it's not so that the 
initial levels are too easy. 

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:03.550
Because you carry forward your goodies, 
your points and your bonuses.

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:07.770
And you know as life, 
or play, gets harder later, 

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:10.890
you have to acquire enough 
bonus points and good points,

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:12.930
which you then can 
use in the later levels. 

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:15.900
And again, that's something, 
if a novice plays it,

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:20.130
he or she will advance 
through three or four levels

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:21.880
and will be happy 
about the points score. 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:25.280
But as you get more 
experience, you see that 

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:28.570
you have to gather lots of 
points already on the first level, 

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:31.550
second level, where you can 
easily get lots of points.

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:34.800
And then, when it gets tougher, 
you use these points up. 

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:37.070
And then you can play 
five, six, eight, ten levels

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:38.890
depending on your experience. 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:40.470
So you grow with the game. 

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:43.160
But the real addiction is that, 

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:45.620
"Oh, I just want to 
play it one more time. 

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:47.200
Because I know 
I can do better!" 

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:48.540
"I just needed two 
more bonus points 

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:50.360
and I could have got 
to the next level." 

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:54.100
Are you increasingly designing
games with computers in mind?

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:55.650
Yes it is. 

00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:58.530
I am fascinated by the 
opportunities we have 

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:01.780
these days, with very 
powerful, and... 

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:05.170
actually, mass market 
media, electronically, 

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:07.080
which can reach 
a lot of people. 

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:09.770
And of course, which 
have their own challenges 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:11.630
in designing the 
right games for it. 

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:14.830
So yes, I am concentrating, 
more actually, 

00:04:14.980 --> 00:04:16.780
on electronic designs. 

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:21.820
And at the moment,
with the evolution of the iPhone, 

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:26.070
I am very, very excited about the
possibilities on the iPhone.

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:29.500
Can you tell us about the play modes?

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:33.360
The Puzzle mode is 
essentially restricted by 

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:37.260
only having all 
the colors once. 

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:40.090
Once you have used them 
in a segment, in a sector,

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:42.140
then they are not 
replenished. 

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:46.170
You turn the different 
wheels and you 

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:48.170
use the colors once and 
then they disappear. 

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:51.800
And just have to make the best
use of all these available colors.

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:54.300
Which is the seven 
wheels times six. 

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:57.550
So this is something, kind 
of a minimalistic approach.

00:04:57.800 --> 00:05:01.690
And I like it because you always 
have to use all your resources.

00:05:01.840 --> 00:05:03.600
This is, however, something
that you can take  

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:04.940
plenty of time over it. 

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:06.700
And just think out 
the best moves. 

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:10.610
Our second mode which 
is the Action mode. 

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:13.860
Here you have exactly 
one minute to 

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:16.830
play a level of the game. 

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:19.980
And I find that very 
challenging because 

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:21.980
it is really about speed. 

00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:26.680
The colors in the segments 
are no longer restricted.

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:29.790
That means when you, 
essentially, empty a wheel

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:31.880
by using all six of its colors,

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:34.470
it is actually replenished by 
another set of random colors.

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:35.780
So you want to be fast. 

00:05:35.970 --> 00:05:38.610
And you want to make your 
points to get to many levels.

00:05:39.540 --> 00:05:40.830
And then there's 
a third mode, 

00:05:41.030 --> 00:05:43.070
which is our Arcade mode. 

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:48.510
Which is a completely different 
approach again, to the game. 

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:50.920
Because here the restriction 
is the number of rotations

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:52.310
you can do with 
the wheels. 

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:54.680
And each level 
adds a new color. 

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:58.340
So you start very easily 
with only three, four colors.

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:00.390
And then you go to 
five colors, six colors.

00:06:00.490 --> 00:06:02.660
And of course, the 
more colors you have 

00:06:02.900 --> 00:06:04.980
the more difficult it is 
to make the matches ,

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:07.310
that biangles and triangles, 
how we call them.

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:09.630
Here it is essentially to 
build for the future.

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:11.540
So it's not just 
looking at one level. 

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:14.510
You have to make many 
points as long as it's easy. 

00:06:14.700 --> 00:06:17.340
And then you 
use these points 

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:19.240
you have collected 
earlier in later levels, 

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:20.300
when it gets hard.

00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:23.500
Do you think Roto will appeal
to your traditional audience?

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:24.600
I think yes. 

00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:28.260
Roto is a very simple game. 
Very short rules. 

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:32.670
But it has a lot of the attractive
elements of a board game.

00:06:33.090 --> 00:06:33.920
You take it turn by turn. 

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:36.240
And you try to optimize 
your resources. 

00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:39.770
You try to deal with the restrictions 
as if you had a board game.

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:42.740
But, of course, everything is 
done electronically for you 

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:46.510
so you can completely concentrate 
on your strategy.

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:48.920
So I think it will appeal, 
on the one side, 

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:50.820
to the board gamers 
who know me. 

00:06:51.020 --> 00:06:52.360
And on the other 
side, of course, 

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:55.700
we have a fantastic and 
typical iPhone game here, 

00:06:55.890 --> 00:06:58.990
so it should actually 
be very well received  

00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:01.320
by the iPhone, the 
electronic people as well. 

00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:03.360
So I have great expectations 
for the game. 

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:05.100
Thank you for your time
Dr Knizia.

00:07:05.510 --> 00:07:07.310
Well, thank you very much!
