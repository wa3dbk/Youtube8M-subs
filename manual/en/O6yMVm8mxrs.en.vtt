00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:08.850
Today in Illustrator, I will be showing you
how to create a complicated looking, but easy

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:10.960
to execute, fractured text effect.

00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:14.020
So the first thing to do is create a grid
of rectangles.

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:17.500
Grab your rectangle tool, and begin dragging
out vertical rectangles.

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:20.860
Hold alt and drag to copy a rectangle.

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:25.399
If you want each rectangle spaced the same,
feel free to use your align panel or press

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.320
command or control D to repeat your last action.

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:34.060
Feel free to add in skinny rectangles and
fat rectangles to vary up the final result.

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:39.980
Once you have this completed, select all of
the rectangles, right click, and go to "Make Compound Path."

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:44.620
After that, go up to "Edit," "Copy," and then
"Edit" "Paste in Place."

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:50.380
Then grab the corner and rotate this group
90 degrees so that you have a lattice of rectangles.

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:54.500
After that, we will need to add a gradient
to these compound paths.

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.300
Select one of your paths and click to add
a gradient.

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:58.920
And then pick two gradient colors.

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:04.460
Lastly, make one of the colors about 40% opacity.

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:09.040
Once you are happy with the result, select
the other compound path and either create

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.280
a separate gradient or drag the same one onto
it.

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:17.920
Now you can align these two sets of compound
paths to create an interesting overlap of opacities.

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:21.840
Once you have something you like, go ahead
and grab your text tool.

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:24.780
Then type out some text and scale it up.

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.080
Next go up to "Type" and then down to "Create
Outlines."

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.800
After that, select everything that you have
on the stage.

00:01:33.620 --> 00:01:36.440
Then right click and go to "Make Clipping
Mask."

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:43.080
After that, select the clipped letter and
then go to "Object" and down to "Flatten Transparencies"

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:44.080
and click "Ok."

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.700
This will take all of the transparent chunks
of our grid and turn them permanently into

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.040
the color chunks you see.

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.340
After that, right click on your group and
go to "Ungroup."

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:56.680
Then right click again and go to "Release
Clipping Mask."

00:01:56.689 --> 00:02:01.090
Now you can select each section of colors
and drag them around, thus giving you a fragmented

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:02.080
text effect.

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:06.320
Feel free to use different colors, different
shapes, and sizes of grids, and different

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.260
opacity gradients to drastically vary your
results.

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:11.040
So there you have it.

00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:15.380
Now you have created a complicated looking
fractured text effect in only a few minutes.

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:21.459
