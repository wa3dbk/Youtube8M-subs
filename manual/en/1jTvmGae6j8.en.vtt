00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:06.111
My name is Michelle Dittrich and I am a make-up
artist.

00:00:06.111 --> 00:00:11.230
I have done make-up on a lot of celebrities,
Pam Anderson, Kanye West, Binny Travis, Cynthia

00:00:11.230 --> 00:00:12.509
Nixon.

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:18.520
There is a big misconception that I could
never do that look on the runway and you absolutely

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:19.520
can.

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:27.960
Everybody can and you will place your best
actor view and I can show you how to do that.

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:34.670
We just finished a perfect classic wedding
look that is great for photos.

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:42.090
So now we are going to actually turn it into
a celebrity Taylor Swift..Taylor Swift red

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.629
carpet ready look which also means she is
photographed all the time.

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:52.040
Excited but we are going to change a few elements
of the wedding look to turn it into her look.

00:00:52.040 --> 00:01:01.769
So she is known for her cat eyes, that well
defined lip, that fresh young pretty but super

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:05.860
polished multimillionaire super star look.

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:12.409
So for the Taylor Swift look we are going
to define her lips first which is what I am

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:13.600
going to show you right now.

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:19.100
She just wiped off her wedding photo lip which
was glossy.

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:30.340
Now we are going to give her a lip stain with
a liner and a little bit of a finish lipstick

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:36.049
just for moisture's sake so it does not look
dry coz stains can look dry but they stay

00:01:36.049 --> 00:01:37.260
on amazingly.

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:43.140
So I am going to go around her lip line with
a little bit of concealer.

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:50.120
A cream stick concealer is great to carry
with you for touch ups and we used a creamy

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:51.979
concealer earlier.

00:01:51.979 --> 00:01:56.920
Its kind of what ever you have is okay but
a concealer non the less.

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:03.310
So just to avoid any redness I am applying
it with a concealer brush but we just want

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:10.410
to make it sure that we get that really defined,
specific Taylor Swift look.

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:13.890
I am going to start with a stain.

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:21.330
It just kind of looks like a marker, but it
colors your lips, gives u that pretty, like

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:28.950
u just ate a Popsicle in summer kind of look
and it will stay on for so long, its awesome.

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:33.050
I am sticking in with a few shades of her
lips.

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:38.420
Start in the center of your lip and work your
way out.

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.110
Once again we are going to keep it modern.

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:42.860
Like to start with a little bit of a bow.

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:48.960
I think we have all seen Taylor Swifts well
defined, popped, bow lip.

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:54.390
We'l do this so go ahead and take it over
the whole entire lip.

00:02:54.390 --> 00:03:00.670
Even down to the lip line so you get to pay
a little more attention coz its a stain so

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:07.340
here we have just the stainer which is really
pretty but in order to get give it a really

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:16.370
really defined red carpet ready finish we
are gonna go in with a lip liner in a similar

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:17.920
tone.

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:25.840
So I am going to use a lip pencil to further
define her lips in order to give that red

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.310
carpet ready polish.

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:37.100
So its kind of a pinky red, the lip stain
color but its gonna give more definition.

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:44.260
So start in the middle of the lip and with
the darker colors, if you saw the previous

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:49.350
tutorials of the wedding make up photos, I
said you can over draw a bottom of your lip

00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:53.400
if you wanna give a little bit of a pout but
that is with a neutral color lip liner.

00:03:53.400 --> 00:04:02.430
If you are using a more distinct color , you
wanna just stick to your lip shade and be

00:04:02.430 --> 00:04:05.720
really nice and fine about it.

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:10.990
So I like to do the middle and then kind of
turn the pencil on the side and then turn

00:04:10.990 --> 00:04:12.440
the pencil on its other side.

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:13.790
That will help with feathering.

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:15.900
OK, so that's just the bottom.

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:24.400
Then we are going to just fill the outer 2/3rds
so leave the center just stain.

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:33.590
Ok and I am going from ..and at the end of
the look we'll take a little bit of powder

00:04:33.590 --> 00:04:39.060
translucent again, the same with which we
matte her face before around the edge to just

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:43.620
make sure that its super clean.

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:50.110
Now I am going to add for a little blend ability
as well as moisture.

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:57.350
A similar tone again of lipstick will but
the reason why is coz you are going to get

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:58.640
a really long wear.

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:07.540
You are going to get a very defined lip but
also we wanna keep it looking fresh and youthful

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:11.390
so I am just gonna take a lip brush again.

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:16.810
Starting with center, keep it all the way
to the end coz now we have the stain and the

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:17.810
lip liner on.

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:20.090
You can take the color all the way.

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:27.400
And now I am going to use just to set the
lip the translucent powder.

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:32.980
Not is it only gonna mattify the lip but it
is also going to hold it in place coz what

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:40.300
we are in for here with the red carpet Taylor
Swift look,is we dont have to have your make

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:43.750
up artist running after you, retouching you
the whole time.

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:45.810
So start on the outside of the lip.

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:49.270
Just translucent powder and a fairly flat
brush.

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:53.710
it could even be flatter than this one and
you don't wanna get too much translucent powder.

00:05:53.710 --> 00:06:01.040
And then, this is really gonna give you the
say, gently,very gently just pat it up the

00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:08.320
whole lip and if you do one side then switch
sides for the second side of the lip.

00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:13.300
So if you do one side , after you need to
switch to the other side coz it will have

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:14.960
a little bit of lipstick on it.

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:19.400
That's it and it will stay on like all night
long.

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:22.680
So that's the kip part of Taylor Swift look.

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:30.820
Its moisturizing, long wearing but really
well defined and that pretty bow and it will

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:32.220
stay on all night so they are perfect.
