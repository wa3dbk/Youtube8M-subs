00:00:01.390 --> 00:00:08.390
You know, from a modern perspective, there’s
not much to this game. I mean, it’s only

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.529
got three levels. And if you’re good, you
can beat the first one in a matter of seconds.

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:27.169
In fact, it only takes a couple minutes to
finish the game. It takes longer to eat a

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:31.699
banana than to beat Donkey Kong. To see the
ending, and save the girl, and conquer the

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:31.960
villain…

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:36.699
But that’s the thing. There’s an ending.
And you save a girl, and conquer a villain.

00:00:36.699 --> 00:00:41.010
This is a game that helped redefine its industry,
for a lot of reasons. It may only take a few

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:48.010
minutes to beat Donkey Kong, but…even after
a few decades…you never forget Donkey Kong.

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.699
So it was 1981, and video games were mostly
defined by the arcades. They were things you

00:00:53.699 --> 00:00:59.010
threw quarters into, to try to beat your friend’s
score. Fast forward 30 years, and video games

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.109
are a little different. Now, they’re defined
by the living room. And it’s not so much

00:01:02.109 --> 00:01:06.880
about high scores anymore. Now, it’s about
the story. It’s about vanquishing evil,

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:08.140
being a hero.

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.250
Video games have actually evolved…toward
movies. And as weird as it may seem, given

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:17.840
its basic graphics and lack of dialogue…this
is that one radical push that started that

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:18.250
evolution.

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:25.250
It was a carpenter, and his girlfriend, and
a monkey.

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:30.540
Donkey Kong was originally released in arcades
in 1981. At which point, it promptly took

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:35.200
over the world, and put a Japanese company
called Nintendo at the forefront of the growing

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:40.469
games industry. And five years later, Nintendo
would bring the game that started it all…to

00:01:40.469 --> 00:01:45.149
their fancy, groundbreaking new “home video
game machine.” There had been home consoles

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:49.799
before, but…nothing like the NES. Just as
there had been video games before.

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:51.149
But nothing like Donkey Kong.

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:56.700
And speaking of video games and movies, Donkey
Kong is kind of a playful reimagining of the

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:02.159
Hollywood classic, King Kong. The lovely Lady
is kidnapped by a massive gorilla, Donkey

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:07.619
Kong. And her boyfriend, the carpenter known
simply as Jumpman, has to save her. With Jumpman

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:10.910
on his heels, Donkey Kong does what monkeys
do. He climbs.

00:02:10.910 --> 00:02:15.640
He scales this towering construction site,
throwing barrels at the carpenter, and ascending

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:20.430
the steel higher and higher…until there’s
nowhere left to run. We get one final showdown

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:25.420
between the hero and the villain before the
game does what few before it ever did. It

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:26.010
ends.

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.730
Not with a game over, or a high score…but
with a reunion.

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:35.459
With a conclusion, to a classically structured
story.

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:42.459
Of course, you just play it again after that,
but the point is…Donkey Kong took an approach

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:53.209
no game ever had. It was actually structured
like a movie, as much as a video game. There

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:59.580
was a distinct beginning, middle and end…with
music that actually changes as the story progresses.

00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:02.830
By level two, Jumpman is closer, and he begins
to find her belongings.

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:07.750
Like a trail of bread crumbs. Or purses, and
parasols.

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:12.319
Donkey Kong was the first game in which…the
story was the driving element of its design.

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:17.159
Everything else came afterward, and was put
together to tell that story, and drive the

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:17.290
plot.

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:21.750
But you know, Donkey Kong also broke ground
for its gameplay. It was a 2D platformer at

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:26.439
the dawn of the age of 2D platformers. This
game set the course for the future of game

00:03:26.439 --> 00:03:32.159
design, both in terms of its emphasis on story…and
in terms of its gameplay. All the masterpieces

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:37.629
that came after Donkey Kong—from Mario to
Mega Man—were using gameplay that started

00:03:37.629 --> 00:03:42.689
here. The idea of running and jumping. The
idea of power-ups, with benefits and drawbacks.

00:03:42.689 --> 00:03:46.590
I mean, these are ideas that would soon define
video games.

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:48.569
And to some extent, still do.

00:03:48.569 --> 00:03:53.230
Obviously, this is Donkey Kong as it appears
on the Wii U. It’s available in the eShop.

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:57.439
And I’m not gonna tell you this is a must-have
download, or anything. Chances are, you’ve

00:03:57.439 --> 00:04:01.670
bought this game for several different platforms.
There’s no real plus to having it on Wii

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:06.790
U, except maybe the ability to play on the
GamePad. But, if for some reason, you’ve

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:10.140
never played it…don’t even hesitate. I
mean, for all the things that are amazing

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:14.540
about Donkey Kong, perhaps the
most amazing…is how well it still plays.

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:16.630
How relevant it still feels.

00:04:16.630 --> 00:04:18.170
Despite being such a big part of the past.

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:22.770
I mean, the 1980s would become a golden age
for video games. And it was built by a lot

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:27.290
of the greatest games ever made. But beneath
what those classics built? Beneath that golden

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:27.710
age?

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:34.710
There’s a frame. And it’s made of red,
steel girders.
