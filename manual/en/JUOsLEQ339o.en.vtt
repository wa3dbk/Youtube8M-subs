Jared Polin, FroKnowsPhoto.Com and this is
a quick tips for how to protect your camera

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:15.790
in the rain.

00:00:15.790 --> 00:00:20.050
We're not saying that you should always go
shoot in the rain, but you have to be prepared

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:25.180
or you should be prepared for inclement weather,
that means, if it's going to rain or its dusty

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:30.180
or its storming or its whatever ring out,
any kind of precipitation you want to protect

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:33.150
yourself and you don't have to spend $200
to do this.

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:37.280
You could to get the professional version
of protecting your camera, but when you've

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:38.280
got.

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.640
Let's see $3,000 to when you have $5000 worth
of gear, you may want to keep something in

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.640
your bag to protect your camera and you could
do something like this.

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:48.030
This is a think-tank hydrophobia.

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.730
There's a company called Aqua Tech that also
makes protection gear for the rain, you see

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:56.610
guys on sidelines of football games, at sporting
events they use them simply, you put this

00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:00.850
on your camera you can look through the back
of it, its going to protect it in down pouring

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:01.850
rain.

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:05.110
Now, it's not to prevent protect the front
element, because you still need to shoot through

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:07.060
it, but this is a $200 option.

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:08.390
This may not be for you.

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:12.250
So, what can you use if you want to do something
less expensive?

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:14.320
Well this isn't just a plastic bag.

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:19.229
This is act - what you say photic optech,
this is made by Optech, this is called the

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:21.120
rain sleeve by Optech.

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:22.920
Allen's camera carries these.

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.270
They come in a two of them at a time.

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:28.369
I think they are like 6, 7, 8 bucks, but its
plastic.

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:30.730
You throw it in your bag just in case you
need it.

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:32.860
I'll just show you how it works pretty simply.

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:36.670
You slide your camera in here.

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:38.979
Don't suffocate, don't let kit suffocate in
this.

00:01:38.979 --> 00:01:42.649
Actually they can't, because you can't really
cut it off, but anyway it has a drawstring

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:43.649
on the end.

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.610
You'd tighten this around your lens - boom!

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:51.220
And then you put whatever, I'm not gonna do,
its like one hand.

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:58.159
Alright, one hand tighten it like that, then
back here you have the eyepiece, you take

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:01.240
your eye piece off the camera and then attach
it using this plastic.

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:05.829
See a plastic eyepiece then you can have both
hands in it, one at the bottom, one here,

00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:10.380
it's not the easiest thing in the world, but
if you are stuck in the rain and you need

00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:16.569
to protect your camera from inclement weather,
this is an awesome option to have.

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:21.590
It's inexpensive for 5, 6 under 10 bucks you
get two of these, you can reuse them, but

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:23.490
even if you didn't reuse them, you just use
it.

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:27.459
When you protect your camera and you got the
shot that you wanted, you may - you know this

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:28.459
is a good thing.

00:02:28.459 --> 00:02:31.660
So, think about having one of these in your
bag at all time, whether it's an expensive

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:35.260
one or 5, 6 dollar version, that's up to you.

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.730
That's a quick tip: how to protect your camera
in the rain.

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:43.379
