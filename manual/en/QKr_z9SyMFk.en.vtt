00:00:01.210 --> 00:00:05.450
two new bills were introduced to the
california legislature yesterday and

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:10.289
what they are trying to do is limit the
amount of compensation at executives get

00:00:10.289 --> 00:00:15.469
within the university systems at you
seize and c_s_ years okay i think this

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:19.860
is an important bill out what they want
to do is basically make sure that when

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:25.210
these schools are facing budget cuts and
when d schools aren't financial turmoil

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:29.589
presidents won't have the ability to get
massive came races they're getting paid

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:33.629
so much as it is but now we're seeing
more and more university presidents

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:37.329
within the california school system and
getting more and more raises for

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:42.339
instance um... that san diego state
university president the new one is

00:00:42.339 --> 00:00:47.289
expected to get the one thousand out one
hundred thousand dollar pate increase a

00:00:47.289 --> 00:00:51.430
compared to his predecessor so it you
know that is something that students are

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:56.180
protesting right now especially when the
csc assistant increase tuition by twelve

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:00.199
percent this year and that's on top of
the ten percent increase the base on

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:03.500
situation last year

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:08.520
fluid thing is this is removed this is a
new talk about these uh... good them out

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:11.750
of his presence is not good for the
schools

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:14.030
inventor of the washington

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:16.460
maybe we can only hope is that there's a
great

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.530
and they're watching our clip so i'm
calling them horrible people for taking

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:23.520

just their bills and so there are a big

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.660
stuff within the system forget their
worth

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:31.110
that'll work out there listening to
chance the within their serving dollies

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.390
of it as we said before the show

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:37.720
all of these of isn't easy and all these
periods isn't ridiculous one of the

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:41.130
returns and there was a million dollars
or four years so that they are looking

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.920
for this long companies in the talented
people they need to keep their

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.730
and the same time they're raising

00:01:46.730 --> 00:01:49.810
by the reason for some students and
they're cutting out the things that

00:01:49.810 --> 00:01:53.680
they're doing distance i mean this is
the beginning of the edna indiatimes com

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:59.620

california arnold schwarzenegger wasn't
buying it he vetoed it okay

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.440

governor and hopefully he does not veto

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:14.000
this

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.319
so i do have hope i do have a prank but
just going back to what you said about

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:22.930
the two million dollar bonus over for a
pack over a four-year period just to

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:25.389
retain the president

00:02:25.389 --> 00:02:29.169
that's a two hundred fifty thousand
dollar bonus per year and that's on top

00:02:29.169 --> 00:02:32.619
of their already pilgrim regis salaries

00:02:32.619 --> 00:02:37.409
okay that u_c_ san diego president makes
nine hundred thirty five thousand

00:02:37.409 --> 00:02:41.199
dollars eighty-year and that's on top of
the house he gets that's on top of the

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:46.069
salary or or the paid he gets for a car
that's on top of of benefits health

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:50.050
benefits all of that any anything you
can imagine is already provided to him

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:53.440
and on top of that he gets mad at thirty
five thousand dollars a year

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.639
almost a million dollars a year

00:02:55.639 --> 00:02:57.469
please please

00:02:57.469 --> 00:03:00.619
if that's what it takes to retain
someone that person should not be

00:03:00.619 --> 00:03:03.649
representing your support of terrorism
came there and then who's going to walk

00:03:03.649 --> 00:03:06.910
in and you could imagine that about love
and dollars and uh...

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:09.850
walked in and get paid two hundred
thousand two hundred thousand dollars

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:13.050
too much money too little money like you
can handle two hundred thousand dollars

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:14.059
a year

00:03:14.059 --> 00:03:17.599
don't get me wrong i don't think in
ministration get pay cuts you know

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:20.799
because of the fact that wall street is
fucking us over right that's not what

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:25.979
i'm saying but was crazy meet is that
right now it when you're seeing tuition

00:03:25.979 --> 00:03:30.739
increased for students you should be
easy to that leadership role in st yeah

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:32.790
i don't need that increase in my salary

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:35.410
i'm i'm okay with the nine hundred
thirty five thousand dollars worth of

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:37.839
those without the water

00:03:37.839 --> 00:03:41.179
and he's got no i don't know i don't
know is that the students or or things

00:03:41.179 --> 00:03:44.789
that matter the school to determined
with some of it

00:03:44.789 --> 00:03:48.999
i don't think it had been given away to
someone but ivy magnificent sensible of

00:03:48.999 --> 00:03:50.100
the matter though

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:51.299
but i don't know

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:52.979
it's not going to

00:03:52.979 --> 00:03:54.059
dinner for them

00:03:54.059 --> 00:03:57.189
inconsolably won't care about therefore
no they don't give a shit about the

00:03:57.189 --> 00:04:00.700
students i think that's very clear
especially when it comes to budget cuts

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:02.509
but it's still the principle of the
matter

00:04:02.509 --> 00:04:05.419
to have your university president get
paid nearly a million dollars a year

00:04:05.419 --> 00:04:07.800
while students are paying blue are in

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:11.820
huge student loans that's it's just it
doesn't speak well of the university or

00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:13.590
the prisoners representing your
university
