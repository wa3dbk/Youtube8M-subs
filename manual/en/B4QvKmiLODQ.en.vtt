00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:23.630
This is much different than any other Karate studio I have ever been too before.

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:26.850
I been to a few where it's military, very fromal

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:28.749
And its not very family like

00:00:28.749 --> 00:00:33.170
This one here, you learn but you learn in a fun and make relationships with people.

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:34.540
The thing that I love

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:38.750
The most about Standale Karate, is what Standale brings to the Martial Arts compared to

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:40.489
most general Karate schools

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:44.040
Where you're doing specific things repeatedly over and over.

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.010
This is a little bit different Karate School where it's actually different forms, different styles

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.590
Compared to a regular school

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.770
I love Standale Karate because of the diversity.

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:58.360
the grappling, the sparring, the weapons we do in self-defense

00:00:58.360 --> 00:00:59.379
everything the Bow

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:01.770
The can, the size, nunchucks

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.319
uh... stix, we almost do them all here at Standale Karate

00:01:05.319 --> 00:01:08.130
I'm Rick, i've been coming to Standale Karate

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:13.300
for a little over eight years, great bunch of people

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:15.990
Even though, I'm fifty eight-years-old, I can

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:17.820
participated and if

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.380
there's something i can't do, no one is beating me with a club to make me do it.

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:23.860
What i love about Standale Karate

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:30.730
Is that they treat you like A family and they're really nice to you. When people think of Karate classed they usually think of really really strict teachers

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:36.200
and a really strict policy but i'ts more here it's more

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:40.400
like a fun place. I've learned so much Umm It's helped me

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:44.630
physically, emotionally, spiritually and i gained a lot of friends and

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:49.680
now call them my family. Well Master Rick is a special individual in the fact that

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:51.510
There are not many people

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:53.600
That have is level of expertise

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.409
In a community like allendale

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:58.260
You're talking someone who's been in the Hall of Fame

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.960
coming on thirty eight years i believe in martial arts and

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:05.180
all the different things that he brings
to the table are there's not very many

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:08.369
people that can do that. He's just understanding

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.099
realizes that

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:14.169
Theres not everything that the kids do that i can do so we

00:02:14.169 --> 00:02:15.680
make accommodations

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.540
Every time I come to class I believe that I

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:19.579
learn something new by teaching

00:02:19.579 --> 00:02:22.059
And or learning from Master Rick

00:02:22.059 --> 00:02:23.969
We have a very high level of

00:02:23.969 --> 00:02:26.869
martial artist's that have been in the program for a long period of time.

00:02:26.869 --> 00:02:28.239
So, I believe

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:31.519
within the community, It's the best

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:36.749
Master Rick said, Um Who know's their first form? And my sons hand shot up so fast

00:02:36.749 --> 00:02:41.009
and i was like hoof , I can't believe it. And he did it and he nailed it and he did really.

00:02:41.009 --> 00:02:45.409
really well and since then thats carried on into his school and into his life

00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:49.219
and other factors where he is now a little bit more courageous in trying

00:02:49.219 --> 00:02:52.959
things first it was really nice that we could try it and

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:55.669
just see if it was something that was going to be
interested in. Once he tried it

00:02:55.669 --> 00:02:56.889
You know

00:02:56.889 --> 00:02:58.239
no question

00:02:58.239 --> 00:02:58.950
It was where we wanted to be.
