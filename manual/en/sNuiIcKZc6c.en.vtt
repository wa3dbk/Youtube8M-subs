00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:06.580
What is the name of your yacht?

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:08.120
Vision.

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:10.760
What type of yacht is she and what does she
have to offer?

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:15.640
Okay it's a lagoon 57, 31 feet wide.

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:18.700
It's a beautiful brand new boat.

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:23.220
How long have you been on the yacht?

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:28.119
Not long we joined in July, the end of July
three months ago and so far we've been refitting

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:30.500
all of the boats and we've done it for Charter.

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.230
And now it looks like a brand new boat.

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:40.600
We offer different activities, we offer kayak,
water sports, we have wake boarding, tubing,

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.500
paddle boards, water skis.

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.970
We offer diving, scuba diving certifications.

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:53.510
We have a 90 horsepower dinghy that we can
pull up to a family all together.

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:59.420
We have all of the options where we have TVs,
DVD player, internet, Wi-Fi, everything.

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:01.640
Why did you join this yacht?

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:08.280
Good question, well the boats is a beautiful
boat sailing wise and that's what we love.

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:13.370
We love to sail and the other thing is that
the owner loves to dive.

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:16.899
We have a compressor on board we have all
the gear on board for diving.

00:01:16.899 --> 00:01:22.290
And to the Lou being a diving instructor and
I being a sailer lover, it was the perfect

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:23.290
combination.

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:28.560
We have a beautiful Jennica on board, and
you can get really fast with that sail.

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.820
What's your yachting background?

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:35.930
I started 12 years old doing regattas back
in Italy on small boats.

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:41.329
It was a category 420, and since then I've
never left the boats I always work on boats,

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:42.740
work around boats, sailing.

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:47.840
I even work on power boats for a little while,
and we've been working on Super yachts the

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.430
biggest super yachts in the world for the
first season.

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:53.930
And so far always on boats.

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:56.060
And your culinary background?

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:01.759
I've learned to cook for people for the last
few years, there's not a professional one

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:08.979
but my dad used to run a restaurant, my mom
used to run a frozen food business.

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:12.410
So it's been around the family than anything.

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:16.240
And what did you do before yachts?

00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:20.920
I was in the army, airborne the parachute
troops.

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:25.510
And then unfortunately I had an accident parachuting
and I broke my knee.

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:30.720
So I was unable to do active service, so I
followed my love for the ocean.

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:34.970
Well I used to work as a diving instructor
in Mexico, tour guide, Eco tours.

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:40.510
We used to do date Trips, take people swimming
with the whale sharks, did teach people how

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:41.510
to dive.

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:46.720
Date tours around coral reefs and all that.

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.390
what does the name of your yard mean?

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:56.260
Vision, the story which Fiona told me basically
comes from basically when you want to buy

00:02:56.260 --> 00:03:01.350
a boat you have the Vision, the vision of
them sailing around the Caribbean.

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:04.560
And people sharing their love for the ocean
with them.

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:10.390
So they just decided to call it vision.

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:12.600
What makes you different from all other yachts?

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:14.730
Us, we are the best.

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:16.120
(Laughter)

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:21.440
Tell us. Do you want to add to that?

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:23.160
No, you know it's good.

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:24.840
Okay.

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.800
Tell us your most memorable Charter.

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:31.530
Good question except we've had very good experience.

00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:32.910
There are so many good ones.

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:36.520
I would probably say the wedding Charter.

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:43.900
Cuz we had this perfect group of friends that
came together on board, they weren't planning

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:45.840
to have a wedding on board.

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:50.870
But we get along all together so well during
the week that I just tell them why don't you

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:51.880
get married again.

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:56.520
And we find that we were in the Granada and
we found this tiny little piece of sand coming

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:58.230
out of the ocean with nothing on it.

00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:01.690
With just like a Palapa and that was it, like
movie scenery.

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:08.430
So we basically organized the altar and everything
the proper wedding, put it on the dinghy drive

00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:11.210
to the setting, getting on the island.

00:04:11.210 --> 00:04:16.430
I did the wedding for them, getting married,
come back on board with a nice wedding cake

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:18.280
waiting for us.

00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:20.040
That was really fun.

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:21.479
Yeah it was a really good week.

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:23.420
And we're still very good friends with them.

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:26.940
Nice, why should your guests sorry,

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:30.500
why should
our guests pick your yacht to charter?

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:36.630
I would say our knowledge for the ocean, cuz
we've been working a long time and I'm

00:04:36.630 --> 00:04:39.620
a good tour guide too, certified Eco tour
guide.

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:44.949
She is been a diving instructor for a long
time so we actually have big knowledge of

00:04:44.949 --> 00:04:46.219
nature, of flora and fauna and the ocean.

00:04:46.219 --> 00:04:51.699
We love what we do as well so we do enjoy
a lot of company of other people, we love

00:04:51.699 --> 00:04:54.520
teaching people what everything that we do.

00:04:54.520 --> 00:05:00.780
Just diving, sailing so we enjoy the company
and having people so we hope to give them

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:05.340
the best. And I let everybody drive the boat.

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:06.860
Cool.
