00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.990
Today we are going to take a look at this
malfunctioning Sears dishwasher.

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:08.660
It goes through most of the wash cycle, but
never quite completes it, shuts off, blinks

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:12.530
the green clean light and leaves the dishes…
not so clean.

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:17.550
In this model, the blinking clean light indicates
that the water is not getting hot enough.

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.410
We ran this unit through a built in diagnostic
routine, but that did not give us any additional

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:23.410
information.

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:27.820
However, we know that, if the water is hot
enough going into the dishwasher, the only

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:34.030
two things that can cause this type of a problem
are: 1) a failed controller board, or 2) a

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:37.892
burnt out heating element, with the heating
element being the more likely of the two culprits.

00:00:37.892 --> 00:00:43.679
To investigate further, we have to unplug
the dishwasher from the power supply and shut

00:00:43.679 --> 00:00:45.059
off the water.

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.870
In order to be able to physically get to the
heating element, we are going to have to pull

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.699
the dishwasher out from under the counter.

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:56.049
Before we start moving things around, let’s
put a soft mat in front of our dishwasher

00:00:56.049 --> 00:00:59.920
– we want to protect it and the floor from
damage.

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:04.670
Dishwashers are commonly secured to the counter
using two screws and we need to remove them

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:08.490
and the kick plate on the bottom of the dishwasher,
before we will be able to move it.

00:01:08.490 --> 00:01:13.039
Most likely, you will also not be able to
get to the heating element, unless you first

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:15.439
disconnect the water, power and sewer.

00:01:15.439 --> 00:01:20.439
The space is usually very tight, so in order
to disconnect the water supply line, you will

00:01:20.439 --> 00:01:23.079
probably have to use something like this basin
wrench.

00:01:23.079 --> 00:01:28.079
Use a pair of pliers (Tongue-and-Groove or
Slip-Joint type will work well) to squeeze

00:01:28.079 --> 00:01:33.049
and move out of the way the clip that secures
your dishwasher’s connection to the sewer

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:36.130
line; leave the clip on for later reattachment.

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:41.280
To prevent damage to your floors, as you disconnect
the water and sewer connections, keep handy

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.909
an absorbent rag and a shallow dish to catch
that extra water left in the lines.

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:50.619
Now that we have disconnected all the wires
and hoses and with the dishwasher sitting

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:55.159
on its front door, we can easily pull the
wires from the heating element.

00:01:55.159 --> 00:02:00.520
Let’s make sure that it really is bad, by
checking continuity with a digital multi-meter

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:02.420
set on the Ohms scale.

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:07.310
We first make sure that the meter itself is
working, by shorting the leads and reading

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:08.950
a zero on the display.

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:13.940
Now, we put the leads across the disconnected
heating element and verify that it is indeed

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.849
burnt out – here the display is indicative
of an open circuit.

00:02:17.849 --> 00:02:22.680
Let’s undo the plastic hex nuts, which secure
the heating element in its place.

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:27.239
With dishwasher back on its feet, we gently
pop the heating element out and pull it out

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:28.239
the rest of the way.

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:32.780
Since we knew with rather high probability
that the old heating element was bad, we had

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:36.330
pre-ordered a compatible replacement one online,
in advance.

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.299
It’s a good thing we did.

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:43.379
Our local hardware store does not carry it
and we didn’t have to go hunting it down

00:02:43.379 --> 00:02:46.510
all over town at specialized appliance repair
shops.

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:51.340
If we were lucky enough to find this heating
element stocked locally, it would have cost

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:52.880
us double what we paid online.

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:57.780
Worse yet, if we could not find the heating
element in town, we would have had to put

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:03.780
the dishwasher back together again and start
all over, once we had the new part in our

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:04.780
hands.

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:09.500
We must make sure that the new element has
rubber washers already installed around the

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:10.500
connectors.

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.250
They should have been at least provided – it
is not the best idea to reuse the old ones

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.140
– they may leak.

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:20.540
Check the replacement heating element’s
continuity using the same digital multi-meter.

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:25.019
Let’s gently work the heating element into
place, making sure that we do not to bend

00:03:25.019 --> 00:03:27.090
the clips which will hold it there.

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:32.969
Now, again place the dishwasher on its door
and secure the element in place by hand tightening

00:03:32.969 --> 00:03:37.230
the new plastic hex nuts – they too should
have been supplied with your new element.

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:42.099
Tighten another half a turn or so with an
adjustable wrench – don’t overdo it.

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:45.209
Connect power supply wires back to the new
heating element.

00:03:45.209 --> 00:03:50.379
The power cord is connected back up to the
metal box that encloses the electrical connections.

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:54.859
If the original wire nuts are still in good
shape, you can reuse them to make the hot

00:03:54.859 --> 00:03:57.950
(black wire) and common (white wire) connections.

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:03.830
If the old wire nuts look burned or are brittle,
make sure to get properly sized new ones.

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:05.000
Same goes for your power cord.

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.780
Do not forget to also reconnect the green
ground wire to the chassis with its attached

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:14.010
screw, before closing up that box and securing
it with its own screw.

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:19.460
Next, reconnect to the sewer line, once again
using a pair of appropriate pliers to get

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:21.070
the clip back in place.

00:04:21.070 --> 00:04:26.800
Use a basin wrench, now flipped in the opposite
direction, to reconnect the water supply hose.

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:32.390
Slide the dishwasher back in place, plug it
back in and turn the water back on.

00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:36.450
Before we finish reinstalling the dishwasher
completely, let’s check to make sure that

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:38.360
it works as it should…

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:43.650
The dishwashing cycle completed with a steady
green light and when we open the dishwasher

00:04:43.650 --> 00:04:48.930
door, we see steam coming out – all good
signs… and the dishes are finally coming

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:52.290
out clean again – the ultimate sign of success!

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:57.590
We can now reattach our dishwasher to the
counter with the two screws, put the noise

00:04:57.590 --> 00:05:02.760
insulating gasket back in the kick plate cover
and secure it to the dishwasher with the two

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:04.431
screws using a socket wrench.

00:05:04.431 --> 00:05:04.450
And we are done.
