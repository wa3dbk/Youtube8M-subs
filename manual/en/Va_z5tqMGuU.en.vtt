00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:08.800
One herd had only a single baby,
their last hope for the future.

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:17.590
And they called him...
Littlefoot.

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:34.539
Here l am.

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:57.899
Don't be frightened.

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:21.250
Come out.

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:35.450
All that remained of his herd was his mother,
grandmother and his grandfather.

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:40.200
He knew them by sight,
by scent and by their love.

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:45.240
He knew they would
be together always.

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:52.240
Now, you be careful,
my Littlefoot.

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:06.960
Beautiful Littlefoot.
