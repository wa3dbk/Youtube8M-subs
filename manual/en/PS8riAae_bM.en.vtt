Hi Paul from Deutsche Auto Parts, today we
are going to be going over Carbon build up

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:10.330
on Direct Injection Engines and this is on
the intake values themselves. We are going

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:16.420
to be including information about how it happens
and things that can be done to prevent it.

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:23.060
[Intro: Deutsche Auto parts [DOY-chuh] 00:00:17-
00:00:22]

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:29.420
The problem related to direct injection carbon
build up is a fairly new issue. This is a

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:34.649
new issue mostly because direct injection
is becoming much more prevalent and widely

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:41.649
used across all models, all vehicles. Specifically
the reason why it happens is because on a

00:00:41.749 --> 00:00:47.999
port injection engine the fuel injectors in
the intake manifold. So as the intake air

00:00:47.999 --> 00:00:54.649
comes in the fuel injector sprays on the back
of the intake valve. That will then help clean

00:00:54.649 --> 00:01:00.449
off any carbon build up coming back onto that
valve and then allow it to be burned in the

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:06.220
combustion chamber. On the direct injection
the fuel chamber is inside the cylinder which

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:11.900
means the fuel is sprayed inside the cylinder
and combusts there so as the intake air comes

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:17.390
in the air flows directly over the back of
the intake valve and there is nothing in there

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:21.130
cleaning it off.
The reason why the carbon build up happens

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:26.140
on the valve and the reason why you do get
carbon coming in if you dont clean the

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:32.990
valves is because of the PCV system. So the
PCV systems function is to take the blow

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:39.580
that comes passed the piston during the combustion
process and vent it out of the crank case.

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:45.710
Things that are in this would be things like
fuel vapors, oil vapors and any other things

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:52.520
that would be unburned during the process
of combustion. That gets routed from a crank

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:59.520
case up the engine and then out and then rerouted
into the intake manifold for emission purposes.

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:05.160
As that comes into the intake manifold it
will then leave those deposits along the way

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:10.409
mostly on the valves because it is the most
restrictive point of the intake track.

00:02:10.409 --> 00:02:14.980
So here we are going to show some examples
of carbon build up on valves.

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:21.980
Our first example is of a 2.0T SSI VW engine
with 33,000 miles on it. This car as you can

00:02:23.219 --> 00:02:30.209
see has some mild build up starting but its
not terribly bad. It isnt going to cause

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:36.269
any issue at all. All you are going to do
is have a little bit of a restriction in your

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:40.989
air flow which can potentially affect fuel
mileage. This one isnt bad so its going

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:47.400
to be a very small way.
Our next example is of the same 2.0T SI Engine

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:53.129
on a different vehicle with 75,000 miles on
it. Now, as you can see this is pretty significant

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:59.359
amount of buildup on this, its very visible
and its pretty bad. Now, once it gets to

00:02:59.359 --> 00:03:05.700
this point when you have significant build
up like this it has to be manually cleaned

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:11.629
so what has to happen during that process
is the manifold has to be removed and the

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:14.769
valves must be cleared by hand or by some
other mechanism.

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:21.719
All right, so what can we do with the carbon
problem? As Ive mentioned before that car

00:03:21.719 --> 00:03:27.239
that has 75,000 miles on it, it has to be
manually cleaned. The options you have in

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:32.139
that situation are only to remove the intake
manifold. Now how you clean it is going to

00:03:32.139 --> 00:03:37.109
very. A lot of times what they will do is
they will take a chemical soak it on the valve

00:03:37.109 --> 00:03:44.109
and then cleaning it with picks and scrappers
and things like that. Also another popular

00:03:44.439 --> 00:03:49.150
solution is soda blasting. This is a great
solution it will get it very clean, but also

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:55.559
soda blasting makes a mess. Also another similar
solution to soda blasting is walnut blasting.

00:03:55.559 --> 00:04:01.620
So they take walnut shells, crushed walnut
shells, and they use it as a media to get

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:06.719
rid of all the carbon in there. Again it will
make a pretty big mess and you have to have

00:04:06.719 --> 00:04:11.260
special tools for both of those processes.
If you allow the carbon build up to get bad

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:15.599
enough that you are having issues related
to it, like, lets say you have 60,000 miles

00:04:15.599 --> 00:04:18.650
on it and there has been nothing done with
the vehicle you are probably getting to the

00:04:18.650 --> 00:04:20.590
point where you are going to need to clean
the carbon off.

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:26.000
Now, the other option is okay how can we
prevent this? Carbon build up can be prevented

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:31.860
in a few different ways. The most common one
and the most popular used in the automotive

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:37.160
world and the affluent market is going to
be catch can. So what a catch can does is

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:44.160
it takes your PCV system and reroutes your
PCV air flow to where it goes through a condensing

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:50.090
car before it goes into the engine. And, what
that does is as it goes through that condensing

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:56.319
can it will then condense those gases, all
the heavy stuff will sink to the bottom so

00:04:56.319 --> 00:05:02.940
it will be full of like oil type sludge, water,
fuel vapors, and a bunch of other nasty stuff.

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:06.509
And here we will show you an example of what
it looks like when you are dumping out a catch

00:05:06.509 --> 00:05:13.509
can.
[Dumping Catch Can 00:05:14  00:05:18]

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:22.360
So there are other options associated with
that is there are a lot of people who try

00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:27.539
to run some chemicals for example sea foam
and things like that. We dont have any

00:05:27.539 --> 00:05:33.830
claims that we know for certain that that
works. That is something that could potentially

00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:39.870
prevent it and also again just a disclaimer
a catch can will not solve your problem. It

00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:43.030
doesnt mean you will never have carbon
build up. What that means is that it will

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:47.060
help slow down the process and so you will
catch a lot more of those contaminants before

00:05:47.060 --> 00:05:52.009
they get into your engine and get re-burned.
Some stuff is still going to get in there

00:05:52.009 --> 00:05:57.500
and you are still going to end up with carbon
it might last you another 10, 20, 30,000 miles.

00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:03.840
Other options associated with that stuff is
manufactures are starting to test with additional

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:08.819
fuel injectors. Some of them like Toyota are
starting to put injectors in every single

00:06:08.819 --> 00:06:13.860
cylinder. So on a 4 cylinder engine you might
have 8 fuel injectors; 4 in the cylinder,

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:20.189
4 in the intake track. Some people are testing
with throttle by injectors. This way again

00:06:20.189 --> 00:06:25.599
we are getting fuel one those valves keeping
them clean. In the end at this point there

00:06:25.599 --> 00:06:30.379
is no perfect solution for this problem and
all you are trying to do is prevent it as

00:06:30.379 --> 00:06:36.270
much as you possibly can.
