Hi. My name is Jonathon Wilson on behalf of
Expert Village. com. We're learning how to

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:08.929
play an advanced funk groove on the piano.
The last time, we learned a pretty challenging

00:00:08.929 --> 00:00:15.209
right hand lick for solos and we had to actually
reach up with our left hand to get some help.

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:19.400
This time, we'll make things a little bit
easier. Again, we're going to borrow a chapter

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:25.150
from blues piano and use something called
a rolling blues chord. You hear this a million

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:30.130
times. It's something where the blues player
will play a chord in his right hand and then

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:36.650
roll down the notes of that chord kind of
loosely on the way into another solo pattern

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:41.540
that happens next. It works great; it's a
really classic blues sound that happens to

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:46.480
also work very well in a funk context as you'll
hear here. The way I like to do it, I've got

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:52.020
one particular example where when you go up
to that F-7 chord in our groove, you'll roll

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:56.200
an F-9 in your right hand and then do this
little kind of a chord pattern that I've got

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:05.450
written out. Now let's do this really slowly
with the metronome so you can hear what I'm

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:26.300
talking about. Okay? Nothing to it. This is
a lot easier than the last one. But very useful.

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:30.880
In general, this kind of a rolling chord is
something you should work out. Almost any

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:39.270
chord you can play, you can also roll down.
It adds a little bit of a lilt or for lack

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.391
of a better word, you know, it just sort of
breaks things up and it adds this sort of,

00:01:42.391 --> 00:01:46.640
"hmmm, that was kind of cool." That people
will kind of just go, "oh, what was that?"

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:51.360
And you can throw those in almost anywhere.
It's a good pattern to learn. To keep in mind,

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:57.560
you want your rolling to be very subtle and
relaxed. You shouldn't hear the notes of the

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:02.670
roll itself, as much as just this sort of
a rolling that happens. And again, a lot of

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.260
that can be done with the way you kind of
work your hand. Everything should be very

00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:10.889
relaxed. You don't want stiff fingers when
you play those chords. It's not a finger move

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:16.709
at all. You play the chord and then just sort
of, sort of flick your fingers back through

00:02:16.709 --> 00:02:21.720
those same chords again. Okay? So let's hear
that same pattern that we just heard up to

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:48.719
speed with the bass and the drum. Okay, pretty
cool, I like that one. It's a good one to

00:02:48.719 --> 00:02:53.200
throw in. The main reason I wanted to show
it to you is so that you could go off and

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:57.510
learn some other variations on this. Almost
any chord that you can play, you can roll

00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:01.939
and then turn into this kind of a classic
blues lick. It works blues, it works in funk,

00:03:01.939 --> 00:03:06.439
it works in rock. Anywhere you need this kind
of a flashy little lick, it's a good one to

00:03:06.439 --> 00:03:06.689
throw in.
