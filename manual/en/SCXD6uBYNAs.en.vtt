00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:07.750
Huh? A tune that I made!?

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:10.780
To think that you would make worthless preparations to come up with such a blatant lie, how do you even find it interesting?

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:13.380
■ It's true! ■
To think that you would make worthless preparations to come up with such a blatant lie, how do you even find it interesting?

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:19.220
It's not about whether it's interesting or not! I'm just speaking the truth!

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:21.300
There's no persuasive power.

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:23.820
Believe in me.

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.020
...Then, you're saying this is what I made?

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:29.730
Sigh... she's finally willing to believe me?

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.970
How is that possible!

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:36.970
The voice in the song is yours, right? How do you explain that?

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:42.950
Although that's the case, isn't the computer able to edit synthetic voices together or something?

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:45.250
Isn't this what swindlers and kidnappers often use?

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:48.960
■ I'm not a criminal! ■
Isn't this what swindlers and kidnappers often use?

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:49.370
Isn't this what swindlers and kidnappers often use?

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:54.870
Are you for real? How could I possess such skills?

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.780
But, aren't otakus experts in that field?

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:04.320
There are also many types of otakus. What, are you saying I'm an otaku now!?

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:10.570
Woah~ Now you're saying you're not one? That's too late.

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:12.770
If I'm really an otaku, that's not doing justice to the real otakus all over the country!

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:19.650
Besides, I don't have my own computer. How am I supposed to create these sounds?

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.600
How am I supposed to know about that?

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:27.570
Are you hinting that I'm really the one who made this?

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:29.080
I'm going to despise you if that's the case?

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:32.880
■ What did you say!? ■
I'm going to despise you if that's the case?

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:33.250
I'm going to despise you if that's the case?

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:36.870
Your comments are making me ignore you...

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:40.570
Huh, what? Have I said anything strange?

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:47.670
Stop abandoning yourself to despair. I'm telling you, I'm really not lying. It's okay if I take an oath.

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:50.730
Then, you could go die if you were to lie to me.

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:55.550
...It doesn't matter if you can recover your memories that way.

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:57.020
Wh-!?

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.700
Y-You could say whatever when you're just talking big...

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.930
Anyway, I'm don't remember ever making that tune!

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:05.580
■ Hurry up and remember it! ■
Anyway, I'm don't remember ever making that tune!

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:14.130
It's about time that you remember it! You should be able to remember it! You really like that tune!

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:17.570
You too, it's about time you stop it?

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:21.720
No matter how much I deny it, you're just persistently hanging on to it.

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.220
If that's the case, it's like I'm being brainwashed!

00:02:24.220 --> 00:02:28.010
■ Eh!? ■
If that's the case, it's like I'm being brainwashed!

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.350
If that's the case, it's like I'm being brainwashed!

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:34.490
Y-You actually mentioned brainwash...
