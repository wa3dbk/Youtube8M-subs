00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:24.480
when the developers of Castlevania came
up with their classic horror flick inspired game

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.810
they couldn't possibly
have imagined that it would be the

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:31.529
beginning of one of the most successful
video game series lasting for almost three decades

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:36.530
with over 30 titles spanning five generations of consoles

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:42.750
Let's journey back to 1691 to the
Transylvanian countryside of Romania

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:49.230
after his 100-year slumber Dracula has
once again risen from his grave helped

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.659
by forces of darkness monsters from
ancient legends and tales of old

00:00:54.659 --> 00:01:00.330
Simon Belmont of the legendary vampire hunter clan readies his trusted whip the vampire killer

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:06.110
determined to put the
Prince of Darkness to sleep once more

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:11.970
the first entry in the series was
released in 1986 in Japan under the name Akumajo Dracula

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:18.150
which translates to Demon Castle Dracula

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:23.789
year later it was brought over to the west under the title Castlevania

00:01:23.789 --> 00:01:28.979
it's darker theme made it stand out among other games in the early
NES library

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:32.789
as Simon you have to whip your way through the castles six sections each divided into three levels

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:37.159
which are haunted by some of the most
fearsome ghouls you've ever encountered

00:01:37.159 --> 00:01:42.509
apart from his trusted whip Simon can
pick up sub weapons such as daggers holy water and crosses

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:46.409
the only things missing and garlic and wooden stakes

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:51.359
which ultimately made their way into the
sequel. Unlike most games hearts which

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:56.490
usually refill life serve as ammunition
for your sub weapons. Like a lot of games

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:01.170
from that era Castlevania packs a real
challenge leaving you with very little margin for errors

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.880
and the somewhat stiff
jump arc certainly didn't help

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:09.509
for some reason the controls were copied in many following installments and became part of the formula

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:13.950
Kinuyo Yamashita composed
the number of tracks for the first Castlevania

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.390
and this was actually her
first project after joining Konami in 86

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:25.751
in the 3 years she worked at Konami Yamashita contributed to the memorable scores of many MSX classics.

00:02:25.751 --> 00:02:28.770
Castlevania soon became a massive success

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:33.330
only one month after the release
of Akumajo Dracula  the game was

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:37.020
released on the MSX under the title
Vampire Killer

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:41.790
the developers turned one of the MSX is
weak points scrolling into one of the game's strengths

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:46.380
the flip screen style forced the designers to think outside the box

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:51.510
and add new gameplay elements to
compensate as a result the game is more slow-paced

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:56.370
but has a much deeper
gameplay style status you have to find a

00:02:56.370 --> 00:03:00.930
skeleton key in each stage in order to
progress to the next. There are also many

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:06.720
new items to collect such as shields
invisibility rings maps and so on

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:11.190
some are locked away in treasure chests while others are sold by merchants for hearts

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:15.720
some areas were also greatly expanded and the larger color palette gave the graphics a decent boost

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:21.000
one of the more notorious aspects of the game is the lack of continues and extra lives

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.440
although honestly I just adds to the suspense

00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:29.760
an interesting point is that
vampire killer was the first entry in

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:35.120
the series to reach the west before they
even settled on the name Castlevania

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:39.840
back in the day it wasn't unusual to
take a completely different approach at a sequel

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:44.160
like Castlevania 2 Simon's
Quest for the NES

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:47.820
the game has an open-world where players can take their own paths through the game

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:52.260
after defeating Dracula Simon was put under a curse and the only way to lift it

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:58.770
is to gather all the five body parts and burn them inside the castle ruins

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:04.140
he can buy items or weapons and villages or talk to towns folk although their cryptic and

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:09.300
misleading advice can't always be
trusted. As night falls in Transylvania

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:14.940
villagers take shelter in their homes as
evil fiends roam the darkness

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:18.209
the day and night gameplay mechanic was certainly interesting at the time

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:22.890
and it was meant to invoke a sense of fear and helplessness

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:27.000
Simon's quest got mixed reception on one hand the departure from the traditionally straightforward linear action

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:31.650
was a nice change of pace but the
puzzles were too cryptic at times

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:37.800
leaving many players clueless and irate.
The game's biggest legacy was perhaps

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:42.240
the audio track Bloody Tears which was
used in countless sequels and

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:48.260
is considered the most recognizable tune
from the series after Vampire Killer

00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:53.760
after this last adventurous sidestep the
designers went back to the proven side-scrolling action

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:58.560
by the time Castlevania 3 was released programmers had already mastered the NES

00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:02.420
and were able to push it to its limits

00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:06.870
the game cartridge holds four times as much memory as the original

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:11.090
resulting in more detailed and varied background art as well as a larger number of stages

00:05:11.090 --> 00:05:15.570
Castlevania 3 actually takes place two
centuries before Simon's adventures

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:21.390
starring Trevor Belmont and introducing
Alucard the son of Dracula

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:25.740
he's one of three supporting characters that Trevor encounters on his quest

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:30.120
and one of their spirits can join Trevor and become a playable character

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:33.690
the game's biggest improvements were the branching stages which allowed the player to take

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:38.370
different paths the Dracula's tower and
if you looked closely you'll discover

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:43.700
elements and themes that would later
appear in super Castlevania 4

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:48.780
Castlevania adventure the first outing
on the Gameboy was a decent installment

00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:53.880
although it left much to be desired the
game lacks sub weapons and

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:57.120
Christopher Belmont feels somewhat sluggish especially since jumping between

00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:02.729
platforms requires absolute precision.
The direct sequel taking place only four

00:06:02.729 --> 00:06:06.050
years after the last GameBoy adventure
with much improvement to be found

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:11.460
Castlevania 2 belmonts revenge brought
back sub weapons and the action flows

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:15.780
much faster this time around making it a
worthy Castlevania entry for the handheld

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:22.440
the 8-bit Castlevania games
laid a solid foundation of the 16-bit generation

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:27.539
the characteristic controls
tense difficulty level and legendary soundtrack

00:06:27.539 --> 00:06:33.320
were already well established
elements in the series
