00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:15.870
As a 

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.519
video game, Anodyne is a top-down, 2d action,
adventure platformer.

00:00:20.519 --> 00:00:26.050
As a literal definition, anodyne means: soothing
to the mind or feelings; or anything that

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:28.029
relieves stress or pain.

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:32.650
So all around, Anodyne, the game, is a nod
to video games and the medium’s ability

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:37.030
to act as a mechanism to relieve stress or
escape reality.

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:41.260
It does this for the player by creating a
familiar feel through gameplay complemented

00:00:41.260 --> 00:00:51.500
with enchanting music and an intriguing story,
but it also becomes an integral part of that

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:52.500
story.

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:53.500
So, let’s start there.

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:58.199
The protagonist of Anodyne is a hoodie-wearing,
broom-wielding character named Young.

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.289
This white-haired, near-sighted chap’s adventure
begins fairly standard, with a quest to find

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:07.360
powerful cards that unlock barriers and an
ever-elusive primary objective to find something

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:09.150
mysterious – the Briar.

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.159
But not before long, the story reveals strange
sections with subtle hints that the narrative

00:01:13.159 --> 00:01:18.610
is not supposed to be a fantasy realm as in
a traditional video game world; but rather

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:21.320
some type of conduit to Young’s psyche.

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.850
This becomes clearer as the stages break away
from a traditional Hyrule motif and start

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:29.840
to enter suburbia or a strange corner of cyber
space.

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.450
The environments might also be draped in metaphor
as a winter wasteland is populated with extremely

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:39.049
depressed snowmen or etchings on rocks that
have nothing to do with the game but seem

00:01:39.049 --> 00:01:43.530
to be connected to Young’s existence in
the real world; suggesting that video games

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:46.430
are Young’s escape – his anodyne.

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:51.420
Overall the 7 hour journey through the narrative
starts off very intriguing, meanders in the

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.950
middle and then falls flat at the end though,
but, whenever the story platitudes pile up,

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:00.710
the aesthetic and music more-than make up
for it.

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:06.850
The game looks good and sounds even better.

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:11.840
Anodyne will easily tug on any nostalgic heartstrings
you may have for the 16-bit generation.

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:15.610
And rightfully so, Anodyne is literally and
figuratively a link to the past.

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.970
It’s not afraid to show where its inspirations
came from.

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:23.670
Better yet, it’s proud to show links to
its influential past as it takes many queues

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:26.220
from the finest 16-bit era adventures.

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:30.750
Like many games of that time, Anodyne has
a nice balance of combat and puzzle solving.

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.370
Young can add different attachments to his
broom for slightly altered combat effects

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.790
and he can also use his broom in a variety
of ways to solve puzzles.

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:45.200
Like, using dust as a raft or to fill bellows
to propel himself forward across railings;

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.540
among many other things that I’m not going
to spoil here.

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:53.849
Anodyne also has a strong emphasis on platforming,
with jumping sections that become more thought-provoking

00:02:53.849 --> 00:02:57.519
and challenging as you battle through the
different dungeons, which is fairly unique

00:02:57.519 --> 00:02:59.209
for top-down genres.

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:04.480
But take Anodyne’s uniqueness with a grain
of salt, this is a very derivative game…

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.780
but that’s exactly what it’s trying to
do.

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:13.291
Anodyne is bizarre and strange while also
feeling extremely familiar and comfortable.

00:03:13.291 --> 00:03:18.470
Anodyne is as advertised by its namesake;
it’s an intriguing way to escape reality…

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:29.960
a reality you might just find hard to come
back from.
