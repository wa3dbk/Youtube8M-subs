00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.140
Do you know someone who's always wanted to try

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:05.080
hunting, but never got the chance?

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:07.640
The Department of Game and Inland Fisheries'

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:09.640
new Apprentice Hunting License could be

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:11.860
just the thing to get them started!

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:14.360
Virginians interested in learning how

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:16.000
to hunt, and Virginia hunters eager

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:18.740
to share their sport with friends and family,

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:22.370
now have a way that makes it easier to go afield!

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.500
The new Apprentice Hunting License

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:27.950
allows people of all ages to "test drive" hunting,

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:29.740
without the time and expense

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:32.790
normally involved in getting started as a hunter.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.520
And it allows more experienced hunters the opportunity

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:37.370
to share their knowledge of hunting

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:39.520
and keep our hunting heritage alive.

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:42.790
With an Apprentice License, it's possible to hunt

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:46.000
for up to two years before the Virginia Hunter Education course

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:47.540
must be completed.

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:49.710
The license is open to all ages, so

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.300
anyone can try hunting, as long as they are directly supervised

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:54.780
by a licensed hunter.

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.300
This mentor must be over 18 years old, and must

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:02.500
stay within arm's reach, while maintaining visual and verbal contact

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:03.560
with the apprentice.

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.940
Since the apprentice will not have met the requirement for Hunter Education,

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:10.580
the mentor must be able to assume control

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:14.250
of the firearm from the apprentice hunter, if necessary.

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:15.950
(gunshot)

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:17.040
The Apprentice Hunting License

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.470
is only available to individuals who have never

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:20.870
had a hunting license.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.870
By the end of the two year trial period,

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:26.400
the apprentice must have completed

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:28.630
the Virginia Hunter Education course

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:32.690
and possess a valid hunting license in order to continue to hunt.

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:35.290
To get your Apprentice Hunting License, call:

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:44.830
Take the time to help an apprentice hunter get started

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:46.240
in the great outdoors!

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.930
And keep our hunting heritage going strong!
