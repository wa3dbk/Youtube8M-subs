00:00:00.799 --> 00:00:04.060
“Here’s some of the stories trending This
Week at NASA!”

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:07.460
&nbsp;
The SpaceX Dragon cargo capsule was recently

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:12.290
detached from the International Space Station
for its return to Earth, just over a month

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:18.320
after delivering about 5,000 pounds of supplies
and experiments to the ISS. Dragon safely

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:24.029
returned to Earth with more than 3,200 pounds
of NASA cargo and science samples – completing

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:28.070
the company’s fourth resupply mission to
the station.

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:30.989
&nbsp;
A Destination Station forum on October 27

00:00:30.989 --> 00:00:36.310
at the U.S. Space &amp; Rocket Center, near Marshall
Space Flight Center featured a series of live,

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:40.800
interactive panel discussions about some of
the cutting-edge technologies being tested

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:46.559
on the space station. Research performed on
the ISS provides benefits to life on Earth,

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:52.470
and prepares NASA to send humans farther into
the solar system than ever before.

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:54.559
&nbsp;
NASA Administrator Charlie Bolden visited

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:59.760
Marshall during the week of October 27. While
there, he toured Marshall’s Payload Operations

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.879
Integration Center, which oversees science
experiments on the station.

00:01:03.879 --> 00:01:08.320
“Station, this is Payload Ops Center, Charlie
Bolden for a voice check, how do you read?”

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:13.400
The administrator put in a long distance call
to NASA’s Butch Wilmore and Reid Wiseman,

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:18.250
to discuss recent activities on the orbiting
laboratory, and the crew’s busy schedule.

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:23.430
Bolden also attended the 7th annual Wernher
Von Braun Memorial Symposium with other NASA

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:28.710
leaders and&nbsp;commented on the work conducted
on the space station in support of our journey

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:35.460
to Mars, and the progress in developing technologies
and systems needed to get us there.

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.970
&nbsp;
Orbital Sciences’ is conducting an investigation

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:43.420
into what went wrong shortly after liftoff
of its Antares rocket on October 28 at NASA’s

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:48.790
Wallops Flight Facility in Virginia. Antares
was carrying the Cygnus cargo craft to orbit

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:54.580
for its resupply flight to the space station.
No injuries were reported and the crew onboard

00:01:54.580 --> 00:02:00.700
the ISS is fine; there are enough supplies
to sustain the crew well into next year. Despite

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:06.470
the accident, NASA remains committed to expanding
the capability of launching cargo and crew

00:02:06.470 --> 00:02:11.039
from American shores to the International
Space Station.

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.810
&nbsp;
After a three-month stay at the station, the

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:19.690
Russian Progress 56 cargo ship left on October
27, loaded with trash and unwanted items.

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:24.590
That made room for the Progress 57, which
launched from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:31.950
on October 29 -- docking later the same day
with almost three tons of food and materials.

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.351
&nbsp;
NASA astronaut Terry Virts participated in

00:02:34.351 --> 00:02:40.450
final qualification training October 30 and
31, in Star City, Russia with his Expedition

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:46.900
42/43 crewmates, Anton Shkaplerov of the Russian
Federal Space Agency and European Space Agency

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:52.090
astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti. They are
the next crew headed to the ISS – launch

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:56.750
is scheduled for November 23, eastern time.
&nbsp;

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:01.290
Testing of a 35-inch-long Space Launch System
booster separation model in Langley Research

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:06.970
Center’s Unitary Plan Wind Tunnel, is helping
NASA engineers better understand the aerodynamic

00:03:06.970 --> 00:03:12.431
forces the real SLS rocket will encounter
as it flies through the atmosphere. The wind

00:03:12.431 --> 00:03:18.530
tunnel produces air speeds over 2,400 mph.
The SLS will be the world’s most powerful

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:25.500
rocket, capable of launching astronauts aboard
the Orion spacecraft to deep space destinations.

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.220
&nbsp;
A naturally occurring trick on Jupiter produced

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:33.650
a celestial treat of an image – befitting
Halloween. The photo taken by the Hubble Space

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:39.470
Telescope appears to show Jupiter staring
back at Hubble like a one-eyed giant Cyclops.

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:44.730
However, the dark spot inside the planet’s
Great Red Spot storm isn’t a pupil – but

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:50.740
a shadow that was cast by Jupiter’s moon,
Ganymede as it orbited the planet.

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:52.819
&nbsp;
And that’s what’s up this week @NASA …

00:03:52.819 --> 00:03:54.760
