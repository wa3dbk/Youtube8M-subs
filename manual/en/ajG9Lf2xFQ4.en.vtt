00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:03.620
Welcome to a lesson on place value and whole numbers.

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:07.320
The goals of this video are to define
counting numbers and whole numbers,

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:11.800
determine place value of whole numbers, and then write whole numbers in expanded

00:00:11.809 --> 00:00:12.420
form.

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.800
In mathematics there are different types,

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:21.100
or sets of numbers. The counting numbers, sometimes called natural numbers,

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:25.300
are the set of numbers as we see here. And you can see why they're often called the

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:26.220
counting numbers.

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:29.900
One, two, three, four, five, and so on,

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:34.600
would be the numbers we use to count items. Now whole numbers

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:39.720
are the set of counting numbers, and zero. So whole numbers are the numbers

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:42.720
in the set as we see here, and again the only difference is

00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:46.200
whole numbers include zero while counting numbers

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:50.320
don't. Since our number system is base ten,

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.620
as we consider a larger and larger
counting our whole numbers,

00:00:53.629 --> 00:00:57.929
we have to introduce place value to
distinguish between different quantities.

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.120
For example, if we were counting these items, or each square was one,

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.020
we'd have a total of five, or five in the
ones place value.

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:09.920
Which gives us the number five. However, if we wanted to count the total number of

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.939
items here, we'd actually start to group them

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:15.899
in tens, so we'd have a total of

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:19.700
three groups of ten. So we'd have a three

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:24.330
in the tens column to represent the thirty, and then a two in the ones column to represent

00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:27.520
the remaining two items, to represent the number thirty-two,

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:30.820
a three in the tens column, and a two in the ones column.

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:34.140
Now if we wanted to count the number of items we see here,

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.840
once we've counted ten groups of ten, that would represent

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:42.120
one hundred items. So here we see ten groups of ten,

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:47.420
or one hundred items, and then we have five groups of ten, or fifty.

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:52.200
So we have a five in the tens column, and then we have three left in the ones column,

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:57.920
to represent one hundred fifty-three. Now let's take a look at a more comprehensive place value chart.

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:02.400
So as we work our way from left to right using place value, we have the ones,

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:05.500
tens, hundreds, thousands,

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:08.949
ten thousands, hundred thousands, millions,

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:14.200
ten millions, hundred millions, and so on. One more thing when running large numbers,

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:17.629
we separate the millions and the
thousands with a comma,

00:02:17.629 --> 00:02:21.720
and the thousands and hundreds with a comma to help keep the digits organized.

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:25.550
Notice how in the place value chart, I did include the decimal to the far right.

00:02:25.550 --> 00:02:28.940
Because we're not going to have any digits to the right of the decimal for whole

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:29.550
numbers,

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:33.120
we normally do not include the decimal point. But the reason I wanted to include

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.640
it is,

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:37.940
the word and, is used to represent the
decimal point. So we shouldn't use

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:41.730
and when we say a whole numbers. So this would be eight million,

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:46.120
three hundred, two thousand, seven hundred ninety-five.

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:50.120
Sometimes you'll hear people say and, like seven hundred and ninety-five,

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:54.629
but technically that would not be
correct. So if we wanted to practice

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:56.400
identifying place values,

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:00.159
this three would be in the hundred
thousands place value.

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:11.720
The two would be in the one thousands, or thousands place value.

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:15.880
And the nine would be in the tens place value.

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:19.220
Let's take a look at one more example of this.

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:23.600
Let's go ahead and put the commas in to separate our place values.

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:27.020
Starting from the right, we put a comma between every three digits

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:30.819
here, and here. So this would be

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:34.219
eight hundred forty-five million, three hundred six

00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:37.500
thousand, nine hundred seventeen.

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.800
So this four would be in the ten millions

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:47.840
place value. The five would be in the

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:54.950
one millions or millions place value. And the seven

00:03:54.950 --> 00:04:00.620
would be in the ones place value. Now sometimes you'll be asked to write

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:02.220
numbers in expanded form.

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:06.820
And writing a number in expanded form is a way to emphasize the place value of

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:07.440
each digit.

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:14.120
What I mean by that is, this five
represents five hundred.

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:18.300
This eight represents eight tens, or eighty.

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:22.000
And this three represents three ones or three.

00:04:22.009 --> 00:04:26.910
This is called expanded form of five hundred eighty-three.

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:31.139
So for twelve thousand, eight hundred ninety-three, this one, represents

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:34.419
one ten thousand or ten thousand. Plus

00:04:34.419 --> 00:04:38.710
two one thousands, or two thousand.

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:43.010
Plus eight would be eight hundred.

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:46.100
Plus this nine represents ninety,

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:50.020
and the three represents three. For this eight,

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:54.630
we have the thousands, millions, and
billions. So this would be

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:59.700
eight billion. Plus, now because there's a zero in the hundred millions

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:03.949
place value, we do not need to include
that. So we'll have plus

00:05:03.949 --> 00:05:07.509
ninety million,

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:12.300
plus one million,

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:17.419
plus this would be one hundred thousand.

00:05:17.419 --> 00:05:21.419
And the next non-digit is this three, which represents thirty,

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:26.520
and then plus two. Okay, the last thing we'll do is take a look at how we write

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:30.230
whole numbers in English. We write our whole number in the same way that we say

00:05:30.230 --> 00:05:32.430
them, using correct place value.

00:05:32.449 --> 00:05:36.709
We separate the number in words by commas, the same way we do

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:40.300
when we write the number.

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:43.610
So for example here, we have three thousand,

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:47.100
comma, five hundred eighty-one.

00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:52.949
Here we have ten thousand, twenty-five. Notice the comma between the ten thousand and the twenty-five.

00:05:52.949 --> 00:05:57.350
And then here, we have twelve million,
comma, eighty-one thousand,

00:05:57.350 --> 00:06:00.620
comma, nine hundred seventy-two.

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:07.620
Let's go and try a couple of our own. So we have one hundred fifty thousand,

00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:22.820
comma, one hundred twelve. Remember we should not include the word and, because the word and represents

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:27.940
a decimal point.

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:31.300
In our last example, here we have the
thousands,

00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:36.130
millions, and billions. So we have fifteen

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:43.130
billion, eighty-five million,

00:06:54.240 --> 00:07:01.740
two hundred five thousand,

00:07:05.330 --> 00:07:12.330
comma, one hundred twenty-three.

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:27.460
And we're going to go ahead and stop here for this video. I hope you found this helpful.
