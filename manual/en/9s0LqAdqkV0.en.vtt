00:00:03.278 --> 00:00:05.276
To get at the idea of a rhetorical analysis,

00:00:05.276 --> 00:00:07.938
first I want to talk about some ideas about what rhetoric is,

00:00:07.938 --> 00:00:11.279
and then I want to talk about how to actually make a rhetorical analysis.

00:00:11.279 --> 00:00:15.527
So let's start by talking about what rhetoric is, that big word in "rhetorical analysis."

00:00:15.527 --> 00:00:19.276
The way I want to talk about it is as "the art of effective communication."

00:00:19.276 --> 00:00:21.686
And you might say, "Well, what does that even mean, effective communication?"

00:00:21.686 --> 00:00:26.605
Well, I think understanding that stands on the shoulders of understanding the choices communicators make

00:00:26.605 --> 00:00:29.773
and the effects those choices have on different audiences.

00:00:29.773 --> 00:00:32.139
So let's look at a few examples of choices and effects.

00:00:32.139 --> 00:00:35.693
So for example, I go to a fancy restaurant, and the waiter for some reason

00:00:35.693 --> 00:00:38.354
decides to wear a t-shirt with an offensive slogan on it.

00:00:38.354 --> 00:00:43.690
And I say, "Whoa whoa whoa! Why did you make that &lt;i&gt;choice&lt;/i&gt;? Didn't you know the &lt;i&gt;effect&lt;/i&gt; that that would have on the restaurant?

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:47.027
On my enjoyment of my meal? Etc.?" So I get up to go to the bathroom,

00:00:47.027 --> 00:00:50.401
and the bathroom is painted in this bubblegum pink paint.

00:00:50.401 --> 00:00:53.737
And maybe you really love bubblegum pink paint, but you know for me, I think,

00:00:53.737 --> 00:00:56.776
"This is kind of a classy restaurant! I want it to seem fancier than that!"

00:00:56.776 --> 00:01:00.942
The &lt;i&gt;choice&lt;/i&gt; they made of paint color had the &lt;i&gt;effect&lt;/i&gt; that they didn't want.

00:01:00.942 --> 00:01:04.606
While we're talking about undesired effects, well say I go to the hardware store,

00:01:04.606 --> 00:01:10.023
and they play this music that every five minutes repeats itself in this horrible jingle.

00:01:10.023 --> 00:01:14.143
And they might think, "Hey, that's gonna let people know about our store! It's gonna be really cool advertising!"

00:01:14.143 --> 00:01:16.942
And I think, "You know what, you might have &lt;i&gt;thought&lt;/i&gt; the effect would be positive,

00:01:16.942 --> 00:01:19.540
but for me, the effect was negative."

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:22.805
So let's turn to other kinds of genres. Say someone is giving a speech,

00:01:22.805 --> 00:01:27.023
and you think about all the choices that go into that speech: about how she can choose

00:01:27.023 --> 00:01:32.939
how to say something, and also what to say. How she's going to present herself standing there,

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.070
and also how she's going to present her ideas.

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.353
All of those choices, every single one, is going to have a different effect on different members of the audience.

00:01:39.353 --> 00:01:41.807
Of course, we can turn to writing--any sort of writing!

00:01:41.807 --> 00:01:48.664
Writing in the newspaper, online, in college essays, etc. And writing is so full of choices--

00:01:48.664 --> 00:01:53.206
how what I say, how I organize it, what kind of voice I use, every one of those single choices

00:01:53.206 --> 00:01:58.435
will have a different sort of effect, helping me be effective in the way I want to be. Right?

00:01:58.435 --> 00:02:04.694
So all of these different kinds of situations--remember this?--it all goes back to different kinds of &lt;i&gt;effective&lt;/i&gt; communication.

00:02:04.694 --> 00:02:08.470
The effectiveness of a piece of writing, a piece of communication,

00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:13.795
no matter whether it's a sound, paint color, shirt, clothing, speech, writing--all of that can be judged

00:02:13.795 --> 00:02:22.078
and really, this study is the study of rhetoric: the study of how effective someone's choices were in a different situation.

00:02:22.078 --> 00:02:27.022
Okay. So if that's the &lt;i&gt;ideas&lt;/i&gt; behind what we mean by rhetoric, behind rhetorical analysis,

00:02:27.022 --> 00:02:32.136
let's talk about how to actually &lt;i&gt;write&lt;/i&gt; a rhetorical analysis--say, if your professor assigns one to you.

00:02:32.136 --> 00:02:35.401
Now I'm going to assume that you're &lt;i&gt;writing&lt;/i&gt; your rhetorical analysis, as an essay,

00:02:35.401 --> 00:02:41.023
but of course that's not necessary. You could analyze one of these texts through making a video, through making audio.

00:02:41.023 --> 00:02:44.876
All sorts of ways you could analyze something, right? But let's assume right now it's an essay.

00:02:44.876 --> 00:02:50.869
What I would do, is I would start by explaining the text's rhetorical situation.

00:02:50.869 --> 00:02:53.808
Now there's some big words there. You might say, "Well, wait a minute, what do you mean by &lt;i&gt;text&lt;/i&gt;?"

00:02:53.808 --> 00:02:57.938
Well, you remember all those situations we're talking about: the music, the paint, the writing, the speech.

00:02:57.938 --> 00:03:02.207
I'm going to call all of those "texts" that could be analyzed for rhetorical situation.

00:03:02.207 --> 00:03:06.775
Obviously if you're writing this for a class, your professor might say that you have to analyze a certain kind of text.

00:03:06.775 --> 00:03:08.602
Obviously, that makes sense.

00:03:08.602 --> 00:03:13.138
So if I were talking about the &lt;i&gt;rhetorical situation&lt;/i&gt; of any of those texts, we're talking about,

00:03:13.138 --> 00:03:18.674
"What is the overall context of when that communication was delivered?"

00:03:18.674 --> 00:03:22.942
So for instance, if we're talking about the speech, and we think about how that speech was delivered in a &lt;i&gt;context&lt;/i&gt;,

00:03:22.942 --> 00:03:28.278
with a certain kind of &lt;i&gt;audience&lt;/i&gt;, with a certain &lt;i&gt;purpose&lt;/i&gt; in mind that the person giving the speech had.

00:03:28.278 --> 00:03:34.025
And even, the speech was given in a certain of &lt;i&gt;genre&lt;/i&gt;, right? Maybe it's a "Hey, get everyone riled up!" speech,

00:03:34.025 --> 00:03:38.274
or maybe it's a political speech, "I'm running for this office."

00:03:38.274 --> 00:03:46.686
All of those questions, all of those parts of the context change the nature of how we're going to judge the effectiveness of this speech, right?

00:03:46.686 --> 00:03:50.670
Think about the offensive slogan on the shirt in the restaurant. In that fancy restaurant,

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:55.003
it was SO inappropriate to wear that t-shirt. But if that t-shirt were in a rock concert,

00:03:55.003 --> 00:04:01.470
it might seem, in that context, a little less out of place. (Still not really great, but a little more in place.)

00:04:01.470 --> 00:04:08.017
So what we're seeing is that the effectiveness of communication depends in part on the situation in which it's delivered.

00:04:08.017 --> 00:04:10.874
So if I were writing an analysis, I would want to say something about that!

00:04:10.874 --> 00:04:17.942
"Hey, this is where this was, this is where I found it, this is where it was designed to be read or experienced or whatever."

00:04:17.942 --> 00:04:22.936
After that I can get into--no surprise--some of the choices made by the text's composers.

00:04:22.936 --> 00:04:26.112
So again, if we're talking about the speech, think of all the choices she had.

00:04:26.112 --> 00:04:32.024
She could think to herself, "You know, how do I want my voice to sound? Loud? Quiet? Angry? Forceful? Kind?" Whatever.

00:04:32.024 --> 00:04:37.807
She also can organize her speech however she wants to. She can also decide, "Am I going to persuade people using logic?

00:04:37.807 --> 00:04:41.272
Persuade them using emotion?" All of these choices--there are so many of them, right?

00:04:41.272 --> 00:04:48.027
My rhetorical analysis is going to get into every single one of those that I think is worthwhile,

00:04:48.027 --> 00:04:52.606
especially the ones that I think are interesting to &lt;i&gt;my&lt;/i&gt; audience, as someone who is writing a rhetorical analysis.

00:04:52.606 --> 00:04:56.537
Maybe I want to especially talk about choices that someone might not have noticed!

00:04:56.537 --> 00:05:00.079
Then, of course, very logically, I want to discuss "What are the effects of those choices?"

00:05:00.079 --> 00:05:02.806
Especially the effects they might have on an audience.

00:05:02.806 --> 00:05:06.869
So when she makes the choice to make her voice sound a certain way, I might think,

00:05:06.869 --> 00:05:11.609
"You know what? That decision on an audience might have a really positive effect!"

00:05:11.609 --> 00:05:14.334
And I think, "Well you know, she also made that decision about how to organize things,

00:05:14.334 --> 00:05:19.938
and that might have had more of a negative effect on the sort of people in the audience."

00:05:19.938 --> 00:05:24.067
And when she made another choice about how much to use logic, how much to use emotions,

00:05:24.067 --> 00:05:28.803
that might have worked really well for some people--but remember that people aren't completely predictable.

00:05:28.803 --> 00:05:34.804
So some people might have had more of a negative emotion or might have been so bored that they didn't pay attention at all.

00:05:34.804 --> 00:05:38.805
This is the nature of rhetoric! This is the nature of rhetorical communication!

00:05:38.805 --> 00:05:43.780
People make choices all the time that sometimes work for some audiences more than others.

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:48.399
So obviously, number 2 and 3 won't necessarily happen in the same order.

00:05:48.399 --> 00:05:52.869
You might talk about choices and then talk about some of the effects of those choices and you might go back and talk about some more choices--

00:05:52.869 --> 00:05:56.111
it really depends on how you want to organize your essay.

00:05:56.111 --> 00:06:01.743
The main thing here is that &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; are the one (with the creepy hands) who is in control of the essay.

00:06:01.743 --> 00:06:07.869
You're the one saying, "This is how &lt;i&gt;I&lt;/i&gt; judge the effectiveness of this rhetorical communication."

00:06:07.869 --> 00:06:11.535
Whether it's paint, or clothing, or writing, or a speech, or whatever.

00:06:11.535 --> 00:06:16.858
You're stepping in and saying, "I've found the most interesting things that I want you to know about, and I want to share them."

00:06:16.926 --> 00:06:22.438
And &lt;i&gt;that&lt;/i&gt; is how you write a rhetorical analysis

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000
