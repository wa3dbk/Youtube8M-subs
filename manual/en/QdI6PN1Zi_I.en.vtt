00:00:03.820 --> 00:00:05.800
Kyousuke-shi...

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:09.000
I won't allow such a flimsy "goodbye".

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.020
But there's nothing else to say.

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:16.140
Even if you don't have any, I have!

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:21.220
That earnest part is what's so good about you.

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:27.050
You're good-natured, nosy, and able to confront anyone directly.

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:32.190
If only I could be as brave and press on...

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:35.150
You can! If it's you!

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:38.540
Impo...ssible.

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:43.270
...My feet have already stopped, and I can no longer move.

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:45.300
■ You have to move! ■
...My feet have already stopped, and I can no longer move.

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:49.120
If you can't move, you have to force yourself to move!

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:53.800
Brace yourself and push forward, move on, no matter what.

00:00:53.800 --> 00:01:00.600
Hahaha, if I did that, I might break down.

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:06.750
If we stop here, sooner or later the ending would be the same, right?

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:07.220
......

00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.980
■ I don't know! ■
......

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:12.200
......

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:17.600
...You can't think of anything to say, huh. I get it.

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:20.700
I don't know what to tell you as well.

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:26.100
Hoho? There are also times where you are at a loss for words?

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.150
Isn't that obvious?

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:32.870
Rather, I think that you are the one who's better with words.

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:37.370
I'm better? ...That can't be!

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:41.620
No no no, you're great with words.

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:46.520
You explained otaku stuff to me, a guy who didn't understand anything about it, in a easy-to-understand way...

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:53.070
And you can resolve the conflicts between Kirino and Kuroneko when they start arguing right upon seeing each other, right?

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:57.220
Kyousuke-shi! You're praising me too much...!

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:02.530
Not just that. You helped us out countless times.

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:04.880
Not really...

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:10.830
Yes you did. We were helped by you.

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:14.820
...However, things have already been decided.

00:02:14.820 --> 00:02:19.020
No matter how I look at it, seems like my otaku route has come to an end.

00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:22.780
■ Do it again! ■
No matter how I look at it, seems like my otaku route has come to an end.

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:24.030
No matter how I look at it, seems like my otaku route has come to an end.

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:30.080
For the sake of my parents, the other party, the anime, games and manga I love, and...

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:35.600
My valuable friends. I can't cause them any more trouble.

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:41.280
I said don't drive yourself into a corner!

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:52.650
...I'm grateful for your concern.

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:58.810
However, what you've said is too heavy for me...

00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:00.950
I can't give up after coming so far...!

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:02.610
■ Urgent Evasion ■
I can't give up after coming so far...!

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:02.850
I can't give up after coming so far...!

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:06.860
Somehow or other, I have to get Saori to listen...

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:11.860
If you say that what I've said is too heavy, then I'll share half of the burden with you.

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:18.810
That's why... that's why, please... Can you listen to everything I have to say?

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:21.010
...Kyousuke-shi...

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:24.530
Why are you doing so much for my sake...

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:28.380
