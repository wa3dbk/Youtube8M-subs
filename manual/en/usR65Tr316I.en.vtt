Hi, this is Laura Turner and today I'm going
to talk with you about how to teach children

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:09.920
to write a book. Children are probably not
going to be able to figure out exactly what

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:14.580
they want to write about without a little
bit of a push from you unless of course they're

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:20.570
just born that way and they say I'm writing
a book and this is what it's about. But if

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:24.030
you really want to teach them how and especially
if you're a teacher and you're looking at

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:28.350
this video and you're saying how am I going
to teach creative writing to kids? You're

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:31.630
probably going to want to give them some guidelines
as to what subject matter they're going to

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:36.411
be covering so that you can get sort of a
tailored result out of your teaching. So let's

00:00:36.411 --> 00:00:42.980
say give the child an assignment, say write
a book about Christmas, OK? The Christmas

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:48.750
story and then allow the child to actually
illustrate the book because that's going to

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.450
be something that's going to help them to
use their story telling techniques that they've

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:58.740
been using since they were small whenever
they would draw picture of their family which

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:05.079
is scribbles. And so you're going to say here's
a specific topic and I also want you to illustrate

00:01:05.079 --> 00:01:10.880
it. And then also give them specific parameters
like page limits, say I want you to write

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:17.889
a five page story about Christmas and illustrate
it. And then really just sit back and see

00:01:17.889 --> 00:01:22.490
what they come up with. If they come up with
something that's longer and sprawling, they

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:25.159
come up with something that is very, very
detailed, they come up with something that

00:01:25.159 --> 00:01:29.130
is very simple, its going to tell you something
about each child and how they perceive the

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:36.889
world and how they tell stories and how they
relate stories to other people. Also read

00:01:36.889 --> 00:01:42.329
to children of course to give them an idea
of how books are structured. Generally I think

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:46.630
children will have the idea of the beginning,
middle and end to a story and that's going

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:53.219
to be pretty well ingrained into them if they've
ever watched movies or a TV or have read books.

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:58.849
But really look at books in that different
kind of way and say what, who's the main character

00:01:58.849 --> 00:02:04.989
in this book, right? And who's the antagonist
or the villain in this book. What does the

00:02:04.989 --> 00:02:11.640
main character want? Where's the beginning,
middle and end? Sort of give them basic structure,

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:17.480
its going to help make it into more of a real
book rather than just an assignment book,

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:18.690
OK? So have fun with it.
