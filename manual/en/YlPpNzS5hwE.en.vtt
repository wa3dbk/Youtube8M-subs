00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:09.740 position:97%
Let’s step through the Test Lab Guide for setting up the base configuration.

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:14.710 position:98%
The Base Configuration test lab guide, or TLG, creates a standard infrastructure upon which other

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:18.640
TLGs build.

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.930 position:97%
The Base Configuration uses computers running Windows Server 2008 R2 and

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:24.540
Windows 7.

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:28.090 position:97%
Note that there is a separate base configuration TLG for computers running

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:31.650
Windows Server 2012 and Windows 8.

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.350 position:98%
The Remote Access virtual private network (VPN) TLG stack is an example of a set of

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:39.640 position:97%
TLGs and test lab extensions that build upon the base configuration.

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:44.730 position:98%
This stack configures and then demonstrates remote access VPN connectivity features

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:50.980 position:98%
in Windows Server 2008 R2 and Windows 7 in the base configuration test lab.

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:53.700 position:64%
The Internet Protocol version 6, or IPv6,

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:58.620 position:97%
stack is another example. This stack uses the IPv4-only base configuration

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:03.580 position:97%
test lab environment and steps you through IPv6 functionality on an intranet and

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:08.930 position:98%
a simulated Internet. Now let’s build out the Base Configuration.

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:11.910 position:88%
The base configuration test lab consists of two subnets:

00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:18.610 position:98%
one named Corpnet and one named Internet. You start with the Corpnet subnet and add the computer named DC1.

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:21.100 position:95%
You then configure it as an Active Directory Domain Services,

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.500 position:81%
or AD DS, domain controller for the corp.contoso.com

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:28.720
domain, a DNS server,

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:33.950 position:98%
a DHCP server, an enterprise root certification authority, or CA,

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:38.020 position:98%
with additional certificate infrastructure settings, and then add

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:41.800
an account named User1.

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:46.040 position:84%
In Step 2, you add the computer named APP1 and join it

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:50.820 position:97%
to the corp.contoso.com domain. You then install the Web Server (IIS) server role,

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.670 position:83%
configure APP1 to host a certificate revocation list,

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:59.250 position:98%
or CRL, distribution point, and then configure it as a file server.

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:02.310 position:97%
In Step 3, you add the computer named CLIENT1 and join it to the

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.190 position:88%
corp.contoso.com domain. You then verify that a computer

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:13.060 position:97%
certificate was installed and test access to the Web and file share resources on APP1.

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:17.870 position:98%
In the next section, you configure the Internet subnet. This is optional as some TLG stacks

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:21.100 position:97%
do not require it, but it is recommended because a different TLG stack might

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:27.220 position:98%
require it or you might need it to experiment with your own Internet-based scenarios.

00:02:27.220 --> 00:02:30.370 position:94%
In step 1, you add a computer named EDGE1 and join it to the

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:33.910 position:67%
corp.contoso.com domain. Note that EDGE1 is

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:38.090 position:97%
not configured to perform any routing between the two subnets or any remote access VPN

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:44.320 position:97%
or proxying services. These capabilities are left to other TLGs.

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:46.940 position:70%
In step 2, you add a computer named INET1 and

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:51.470 position:67%
configure it as a Web Server, a DNS server,

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:54.320 position:80%
a DHCP server, and with additional settings so that

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:59.350 position:89%
CLIENT1 detects the Internet subnet as the real Internet.

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:03.810 position:97%
Now you have both subnets and the CLIENT1 computer can move between them, simulating

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:08.600 position:97%
a roaming laptop or notebook computer. Snapshot these computers so that you can always

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:13.600 position:97%
return to this initial configuration. Now you are ready to build additional TLGs that rely

00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:17.720 position:94%
on this base configuration or experiment on your own. Enjoy.

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.290
