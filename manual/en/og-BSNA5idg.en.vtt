Hi and welcome to another series of Hair with
Hollie.

00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:06.140
So today we're going to be showing you how
to do this faux hawk.

00:00:06.140 --> 00:00:08.260
It's really cool and quite rock chick.

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:17.110
[unclear] with it lately so it's a really
good thing for a night out and so easy to

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:19.170
do too.

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:23.230
[music]
Okay, so to start off with we're going to

00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:26.910
just put a few curls in the bottom half of
the hair because the ends of the hair are

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.449
going to end up up here, so you want it quite
textualised, quite messy.

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.340
So this is good to do if you have quite straight
hair.

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:39.590
So, I'm just going to brush it out, keeping
it nice and loose, and just using your tongs,

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:45.690
or ghd or a curling wand, whatever you like,
just curl random sections of the hair, kind

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:48.240
of, about half way down the length.

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:50.829
You don't have to curl them all in one direction.

00:00:50.829 --> 00:00:54.320
It's, kind of, better if you have a bit of
randomness about it.

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:55.870
There you go.

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:57.100
Just so you get a little ringlet.

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.680
I'm just going to do this in kind of random
sections over the head, and then I'm going

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:03.610
to brush them out when they've cooled so you
get a nice kind of textualised look.

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:07.789
So, once you've let the curls cool for a bit
we're just going to break them up gently,

00:01:07.789 --> 00:01:12.459
so I'm using my fingers and just a tail comb
here, just to kind of break up the curl, so

00:01:12.459 --> 00:01:14.939
it doesn't look too much like a ringlet.

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.710
So, just working your way through all the
hair you've curled so you've got a nice kind

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:22.560
of wavy textured look, and don't worry if
it kind of falls out because you can curl

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.180
it again once it gets on the top of the head.

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:29.450
Now, for this look, we're going to start with
quite a deep side parting, so kind of using

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.810
maybe the arch of your brow as a guide.

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:41.429
So we're just going to part the hair.

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:46.829
Just over, and then we're going to section
off the hair for the French pleat.

00:01:46.829 --> 00:01:51.189
So, since we've got a lot of hair here and
the model has quite long hair, we're going

00:01:51.189 --> 00:01:55.049
to put the French pleat up quite high so we
get rid of a lot of the weight of the hair.

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:59.200
But if you have maybe thinner hair or shorter
hair, it's a good idea to kind of do the pleat

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.490
low enough so you still have some extra hair
you can pull up onto the top to put the volume

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:04.490
in the faux hawk.

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:09.880
So for this one we're going to split it just
about here, so quite high, not just the crown

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:11.850
but just kind of over the ears.

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:14.180
Just around about there.

00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:15.340
Yes, good.

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:22.960
I'm just going to put a quick knot in there.

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:35.640
For the faux hawk we're going to try and keep
the sides quite slicked back, so, you know,

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:38.730
maybe if you have any fly aways you might
want to push them back in or if your hair

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.300
is quite curly at the sides just give a quick
run with the straighteners

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:43.360
So, for this we're going to make it quite
textured.

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:47.080
So I'm just going to back comb through the
length of the hair.

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:50.970
It just gives it a bit of volume and makes
it a lot easier to deal with as well.

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:55.060
Just working from the roots, all the way down
the length of the hair.

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:59.120
So as you can see, we're getting a good bit
of texture already.

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:05.860
It kind of helps to keep the hair nearly as
one piece, which is great when you're rolling

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:06.860
it.

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:11.660
Now, I'm just going to give this a quick spritz
with some hairspray and then we're going to

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:12.660
pin it.

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:15.040
So for the faux hawk, at the back, it's basically
just a French twist.

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:19.190
So you can make this as messy or as neat as
you like so, you know, it can be quite textured

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:23.460
so don't worry if there's any fly aways at
the back, but do try and keep the sides quite

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:24.460
slicked back.

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:35.120
So, what we're going to do is, take all the
hair together, fold it over and then just

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.710
twist it into shape.

00:03:37.710 --> 00:03:45.390
Try and get all the little baby bits in there
as well.

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:48.280
Just roll it over, kind of like a croissant.

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.180
There you go.

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:51.654
So you have a nice little pleat

00:03:51.654 --> 00:03:54.680
Now, I'm going to pop some clips in.

00:03:54.680 --> 00:04:01.250
So it's a good idea to use clips that are
the same shade as your hair, or else close

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:02.370
enough.

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:07.110
Just kind of slap them in between the pleat
and the hair, just like so, working all the

00:04:07.110 --> 00:04:10.080
way to the top of the pleat.

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:17.329
So I'm just going to give this a quick spritz
of hairspray, and then we're going to join

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:18.359
it with the top piece here.

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:21.819
So now we're going to attack the top section
of the hair.

00:04:21.819 --> 00:04:26.680
So, depending on what kind of style you want,
if you want it quite sleek, you know, it would

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:30.470
be easy enough to just continue the French
pleat all the way up the head, but we're going

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:34.229
to go for something a bit catwalk, kind of
messy and quite cool.

00:04:34.229 --> 00:04:40.689
So, just with this section of the hair, again,
we're going to section it off one more time,

00:04:40.689 --> 00:04:46.710
literally just in half, and we're going to
bring this piece in to meet with our French

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:47.850
pleat.

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:57.560
So, to do this, I'm just going to back comb
through the lengths again.

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:09.210
Give it a quick spray and then just guide
it in to your roll.

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:11.710
There you go.

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:18.550
Just like so, and pin in place as you go.

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:26.029
So you're always working towards the front
of the head.

00:05:26.029 --> 00:05:32.340
Now, I'm just going to finish that sausage
shape just there, and just pin it all in place.

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:37.460
So this is going to kind of be the structure
for the rest of the messiness

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:38.699
Again, another quick spritz of hairspray.

00:05:38.699 --> 00:05:49.849
So, taking this front section here, we're
just going to add a bit of volume, just to

00:05:49.849 --> 00:05:59.189
the hairline, and then literally all you do
is find a shape that works for you.

00:05:59.189 --> 00:06:08.220
We're going to go with quite a dramatic wave
effect here, and pin in place.

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:14.653
Then with any hair that you find left over,
just simply roll it up into quite a tidy little

00:06:14.653 --> 00:06:15.653
shape, and pin it in.

00:06:15.653 --> 00:06:19.880
So when you're happy with your look we're
just going to go over the whole thing with

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:28.030
a good bit of hairspray just to make sure
it stays in place.

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:29.030
All done.

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:31.340
So there you have it, a faux hawk in minutes.

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:34.970
So guys, if you want to see me doing a back
to school hairstyle next week, give this video

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:37.289
a thumbs up and tell us what you want to see.

00:06:37.289 --> 00:06:38.289
I'll see you soon, bye
