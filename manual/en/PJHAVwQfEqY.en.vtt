I’m Joe Marshall with expertvillage.com,
and today we’re going to discuss flourishes.

00:00:06.759 --> 00:00:12.070
Okay, this is a move that’s known as springing
the cards from hand to hand. It’s difficult

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:17.520
to do slow. Obviously, because it works on
gravity in delivering cards from a pressure,

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:25.090
but it basically looks like this in fast speed.
Slowed down, what you’re actually doing

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:30.140
is you’re holding cards with these two fingers
on top, your thumb on the bottom, and there’s

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:35.370
different variations for this. Sometimes people
use all three and just do this. Some people

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:41.440
use all four. Using four can actually make
the cards more choppy. You kind of want it

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:47.981
to make it look as much as a ribbon as you
possibly can as you deliver the cards. Like

00:00:47.981 --> 00:00:52.750
I was saying, fingers on top, thumb on the
bottom. The bottom hand is really the most

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:57.469
important thing here. To practice spring in
the cards, you can just spring cards on the

00:00:57.469 --> 00:01:01.090
table to practice that, to get that motion
down. The only thing you’re going to be

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:05.399
doing as you spring is pulling the hand back
so it makes it look like a larger ribbon than

00:01:05.399 --> 00:01:10.020
it really is. The most important thing is
the hand below that’s caching the cards.

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:13.740
If you’re beginning the spring cards and
your hands like that, they’re going to spring

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:19.179
and just fall right out of your hands. Your
first finger, middle finger, and thumb kind

00:01:19.179 --> 00:01:24.999
of create this type of net that the cards
will spring into. Your ring finger and pinkie

00:01:24.999 --> 00:01:28.909
are just extra support so you have this type
of thing happening where the cards just cascade

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:33.490
into your hand and they fall there; it’s
known as a mitt. Without that mitt, you’re

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:39.939
going to run into some problems, so just practice
springing cards into the mitt and they stop.

00:01:39.939 --> 00:01:44.459
They should be hitting the first finger and
parts of the hand are bouncing around so that

00:01:44.459 --> 00:01:49.530
they all stay together. Full speed, it should
look something like that. Some people pull

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:55.609
back like this. They do one of those things.
It’s not necessary. Some people use from

00:01:55.609 --> 00:02:00.810
the thumb. I would suggest the proper technique
first before you’re springing from the back

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.999
of the thumb. You’ll have more control that
way, but this is the proper technique to learn

00:02:05.999 --> 00:02:11.130
and to use and just make sure the bottom hand
that catches everything is the key for that.

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:12.970
That’s called springing the cards from hand
to hand.
