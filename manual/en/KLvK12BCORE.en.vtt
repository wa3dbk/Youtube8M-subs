00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:03.530
Today we're working on a 2003 Hyundai Santa
Fe.

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:07.840
We're going to install Tow Ready T1 Connector,
product number 118473.

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:13.339
First, we're going to access the rear cargo
area of the vehicle.

00:00:13.339 --> 00:00:18.130
I'm going to go ahead and push the rear seats
forward and then we're going to remove the

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:23.760
cargo cover and then we're going to remove
the rear cargo trays on both sides and the

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:24.880
center.

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:30.020
Next, we'll go ahead and remove the cargo
hooks from the rear frame.

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:33.340
There's the cargo hook on the passenger's
side, I'll go ahead and repeat the same process

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:36.879
on the driver's side.

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:40.699
Now we've got the cargo hooks removed, we're
going to remove the three fasteners that are

00:00:40.699 --> 00:00:51.219
holding in the threshold.

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:55.800
Taking my interior trim tool I'm going to
go ahead and get under that threshold now

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.149
and pop it free.

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:02.570
With the threshold out of the way, we now
need to remove the interior carpeting.

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:08.090
To do that, we've got four plastic push fasteners
on each side, two more cargo hooks in the

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:24.930
back, one on each side, and then three child
safety restrains across the front.

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:30.549
Now we need to remove the cargo door latch,
take a small pocket size screw driver, go

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:35.619
inside the latch pull back on the hold down
hook and I'll go ahead and pry up on the latch

00:01:35.619 --> 00:02:49.230
on the front side and then I'll repeat the
same process for 

00:02:49.230 --> 00:05:07.310
the back side.
