00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.430
what is up ladies and gentlemen it is the MLGexpert and today I have a quick

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:11.250
tutorial on how to scan your document onto Microsoft Word 2010 most people thought

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:17.279
it got removed from the previous
edition but all you guys were wrong so haha (CRINGE)

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:23.580
and first you're going to open up
Microsoft Word obviously you're going to

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:33.420
click the file options and then
customize ribbon then you're going to go

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:39.600
over here to keyboard shortcuts and
click customize and go all the way down

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:54.390
over here to all commands click that go
down to insert and now you have to find

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:02.730
insert imager scan and click that and
you're going to make a short cut key

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:08.369
I already have one it's Ctrl+S it's pretty good because it's the ctrl then S (Lolz more cringe)

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:10.229
You can do whatever you want

00:01:10.229 --> 00:01:15.479
So you can do whatever, Ctrl+t or r or whatever

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:24.810
but i'm gonna keep it as Ctrl+S so then you're gonna click assign

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:32.670
and once you're back here where you
started you're going to press ctrl s and then

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:39.240
this should come up and you're gonna if you want to
insert it regularly and it doesn't

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:42.840
matter to you,  you can just do this, click insert.

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:48.630
what you want to cause of inheritance
you will have to quit this and will come

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:54.180
up right now so if you wanna make a
document feeder or a flatbed you can get

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.780
because them you can customize how small
you want to make it where you want to

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:07.560
put stuff like that no other way back to
this you're gonna so if you're you click

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.330
on custom settings if you're using if
you're doing this but

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.280
if you if you want guests on a regular
picture you can do this quick color

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.960
picture which is what I'm not going to
do when could custom settings since I

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:23.950

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:34.810

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:39.220
if you don't want to see it quick skin

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:43.780
it might take a few seconds if it
doesn't work at the beginning

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.780

wrong
