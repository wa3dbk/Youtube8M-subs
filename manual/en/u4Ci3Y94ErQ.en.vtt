00:00:00.849 --> 00:00:09.840
So now moving on to reverse silk reeling.
Reverse silk reeling is much similar to forward

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:20.920
silk reeling except it's done in reverse.
The basic idea is the same. We're going to

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:29.580
be making a circle with the arm. In this case
the as one comes over the top, one is leading

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:43.379
with the pinkie and then underneath the energy
goes into the thumb.

00:00:43.379 --> 00:01:08.799
Exhale on the underside inhale while coming
over the circle.

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:38.750
Again the eyes follow the hand.

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:57.499
And throughout this exercise we're maintaining
the figure eight motion in the feet. And as

00:01:57.499 --> 00:02:04.859
mentioned this paradoxically is creating passageways
within your body to allow, to eventually allow

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:07.539
rapid release of power or fa-gien.
