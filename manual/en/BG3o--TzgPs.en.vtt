00:00:12.040 --> 00:00:14.860
Yo! What's going on YouTube individuals and Dragon Ball Z enthusiasts out there?!

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:20.170
This is your boy RBG AKA RandomBlackGamer, hitting you guys up with another DBZ video.

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.820
Before I kick the video off I would like to apologize for tje lack of DBZ content on my channel.

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:29.120
For the past couple months I wasn't
really feeling up to making any more Dragon Ball Z videos.

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:33.240
I felt that with all the awesome DBZ
uploaders out there covering the same topics...

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:38.589
I could focus on other things but due to
the big reception I've gotten from my Dragon Ball Xenoverse videos...

00:00:38.860 --> 00:00:43.880
viewers have been asking for more. This
feedback has motivated me to push out more videos  on a consistant basis.

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.890
and what better way to kick this video
off than with another Dragon Ball Super topic.

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:52.210
Today's topic is going to revolve around
Kid Buu's reincarnation an alter ego, Uub.

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:57.230
He appeared at the very end of the
Dragon Ball manga and in the final episode of the anime.

00:00:57.489 --> 00:01:02.289
He's also considered Goku's pupil and
final opponent, both as Kid Buu and himself.

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:07.960
Ever since we've had the recently released films Battle of Gods and Fukkatsu no F, which have been solidified as canon...

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:10.650
fans have been asking what will be the
fate of Uub?

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:17.620
Considering the fact that Akira Toriyama has been going out of his
way to fill in the 10 year gap between the Buu saga and final Martial Arts Tournament...

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:20.680
and completely eradicating Dragon Ball GT out of existence.

00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:24.229
It's kinda hard to think what's in store
for the time line.

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:27.340
With the sudden introduction of Super Saiyan Gods and this expanded universe of Gods in genereal.

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:31.960
Toriyama has to figure
out a way to balance these things out with the rest of the story...

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:35.300
or go above and
beyond to explain the story of DBZ in it's entirety.

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:40.320
I myself am a big fan of Uub and am patiently waiting to see what he can do in terms of his abilities.

00:01:40.539 --> 00:01:43.939
considering the fact that he lacked the knowledge of any ki
based techniques.

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:49.520
Granted, we got a glimpse of what he
could be like in GT, but as we always say GT never really
happened.

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.580
It's also a bomber that we rarely see him in any DBZ video game titles.

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:57.270
since he was barely in the series and
doesn't have any actual techniques to go by.

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:01.619
but I still have some good ideas on how
he can be utilized in Dragon Ball Super.

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:06.520
so we all know that Akira Toriyama has taken a lot of time to capitalize on certain errors and...

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.860
focus more attention on what
goes on in the Z Fighter's personal lives.

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.000
You see glimpses of what they're up to,
like Go kucontinuing his training with king Kai...

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.680
or Krillin working as a police officer.

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:21.520
So maybe we can get a glimpse of what's
going on in Uub's life while not having him interact with the main Z warrior cast.

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:28.410
This could be done as a miniseries
or filler since we're getting a manga to coincide with the anime of Dragon Ball Super.

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:32.500
It would also be interesting if Go mentions that he can sense a familiar power level...

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:35.640
since it's been well over 5
years since kid buu's passing.

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:39.160
Having filler moments such as these can
add longevity to the series...

00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.620
and although they might not be canon to the main story,

00:02:41.620 --> 00:02:44.910
they can still prove to be memorable like
the other World Tournament.

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:48.190
Getting to see Uub's parents and
baring witness to his upbringing...

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:50.930
would also add more complexity and depth
to his character.

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:55.760
learned that he came from a poor village
in that he in at the World Martial Arts

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.420
Tournament to win prize money to help
out financially

00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:02.140
we also get the small claims that his
shy but aggressive personality

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:06.100
but that summer did me he elaborates on
is noticeable ability to fight

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:08.960
but you sort of get the feeling that he
doesn't know what real

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:12.670
years it would be awesome to see who
question his existence since he can

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:13.910
really do things that are

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:17.980
humanly possible we have to keep in mind
that he's never been around lawyers to

00:03:17.980 --> 00:03:18.880
let it go crew

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:22.500
speaking the Gokhale since he is for all
intents and purposes

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:26.600
its creator maybe somewhere in love soul
it's telling him that he needs to get

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:28.260
stronger in meet this individual

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.270
I'm a firm believer in the by an
intervention and st.

00:03:31.270 --> 00:03:34.710
local did was to fight CID login in
another lifetime

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:38.080
so in a way who had to have an even
bigger reason for enrolling in the

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:40.050
tournament than just winning prize money

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:44.050
another idea that the air tools multi is
a Toriyama hints that there's a

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:48.410
possibility that he can inherit cables
evil ways in certain situations

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:51.950
it was showcased in the last episode a
dragon ball z there when angered

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:55.070
boobs on refined with devastating power
could shine through

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:59.330
cable prove that his immense power could
destroy an entire galaxy let alone a

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.910
plan

00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:03.000
and he was also the evil wizard the
body's creation

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:06.810
it could be possible that the video
bobbi still have a quite a city Galaxy

00:04:06.810 --> 00:04:08.050
hussein's lose power

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:11.870
in 10 are controlling you this if you
work in bullion fans have learned that

00:04:11.870 --> 00:04:13.850
the DC Universe is that their swim

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:17.210
and we never know what Colin said in a
story on the stand up a lot of his head

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:20.790
we've seen the later in Chadderton
appears and we soon learn that they have

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:23.510
been acquainted with freezy years before
ok we've met him

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:28.350
lest idea that I had this data all the
new events are over and done in the time

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:28.810
gap

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:32.720
toy on the console to modify some depart
here or twenty years ago in the final

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:33.100
arc

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:36.880
he shown time and time again that he has
no problems due to new ideas into the

00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:39.380
old story and rainbows ease connective
tissue

00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:42.550
since no question see the newfound
ability to become a god

00:04:42.550 --> 00:04:46.450
and went under we says to delete maybe
he has a lot more to offer who

00:04:46.450 --> 00:04:50.570
this time around embattled kurds Brewers
mention that there are 12 universe that

00:04:50.570 --> 00:04:52.220
all consistent their own gods

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:55.950
so maybe the train poop similar to her
he was trained by Wiese

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:59.630
listener forget that there are films
that on diets were still pose a threat

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:01.260
to the girls who like free city

00:05:01.260 --> 00:05:03.100
Cupertino F

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:07.260
that's pretty much did as I stated
earlier these are just my ideas for what

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.890
or Yom Cincy can do with the character
whom

00:05:09.890 --> 00:05:14.310
this kurta deserves better treatment and
the man's character development with you

00:05:14.310 --> 00:05:14.980
guys :d

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:18.780
do you think blue to be featured in
Great Mall super you think that he

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:20.110
should be fully fleshed-out

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:23.690
done just as compared to his poor
mistreatment in Dragon Ball GT

00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:26.910
