00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Astronomers using the new Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA)

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
have imaged a region around a young star 

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.000
where dust particles can grow by clumping together.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
This is the first time that such a dust trap has been clearly observed.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
It solves a long-standing mystery about how dust particles in discs grow

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.000
to larger sizes so that they can eventually form comets,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
planets and other rocky bodies.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:43.000
This is the ESOcast! Cutting-edge science and life behind the scenes

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.000
at ESO, the European Southern Observatory.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Astronomers now know that there are plenty of planets around other stars.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
But many mysteries remain about how planets, 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
comets and asteroids are formed. 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
New observations from the powerful ALMA telescope are now helping to 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
answer one of the biggest questions: how do the tiny grains of dust 

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
in the surroundings of a young star grow — first to become rubble,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000
and then even boulders well over a metre in size?

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Computer models suggest that dust grains grow by

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.000
colliding and sticking together. However, when the bigger grains collide again

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000
at high speed they are often smashed to pieces and sent back to square one.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Even if they do not break up, the models show that the larger grains

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
would be slowed down because of friction between the dust and gas, 

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
eventually falling onto the star without a chance to grow any further.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Somehow, the tiny rocks need a safe haven where they can continue 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
to grow until they are big enough to survive on their own. 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:08.000
Such a dust trap had been proposed, but never observed, until now.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.000
Astronomers used ALMA to study a proto-planetary disc 

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000
in a system called Oph-IRS 48. 

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000
This system is circled by a ring of gas with a central hole that was 

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.000
probably created by an unseen planet or a companion star.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.000
Earlier observations using ESO’s Very Large Telescope showed that

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:39.000
the smaller dust particles also formed a ring. But the new ALMA view 

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:45.000
revealed that the larger dust particles were doing something quite different!

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000
Instead of the expected ring structure, a very clear 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000
cashew-nut shaped feature was revealed.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000
This is a dust trap, a region where bigger dust grains are trapped 

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000
and can grow much larger by colliding and sticking together.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.000
The observations also suggest that a kind of a comet factory has been found,

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000
because the particles in this dust trap can grow

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000
up to the size of comets, a few kilometres across. 

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
However, at this distance from the star, 

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.000
the dust is not likely to form full-sized planets. 

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000
Soon, with ALMA’s unprecedented sensitivity and image sharpness, 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:33.000
it will be possible to observe dust traps much closer to their parent star. 

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000
Such dust traps really would be the cradles

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000
where new planets are born.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000
The Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), an international astronomy facility, is a partnership of Europe, North America and East Asia in cooperation with the Republic of Chile.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000
ESO, the European Southern Observatory, is the pre-eminent intergovernmental science and technology organisation in astronomy designing, constructing and operating the world’s most advanced ground-based telescopes.
