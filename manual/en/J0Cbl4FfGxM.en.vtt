hey guys amv4fun here and as of now
we have reached 20,000 subscribers

00:00:24.849 --> 00:00:28.779
I am very grateful to you guys but
actually wanted to prepare

00:00:28.779 --> 00:00:32.900
and Amy4fun subscribers special-special

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:36.010
AMV which is not happening because

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:40.370
you guys have been going crazy over my
channel and I did totally not expect

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:40.970
to hit that

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:44.850
goal so fast, so instead you gonna get
this thing here which is

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.100
also kinda nice, I guess... 

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.820
I actually have to thank you guys for something else as well

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:54.260
cause after I mention in my Q&amp;A video

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:57.890
that Umika was my
favorite

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:01.640
editor you guys headed over to her
channel like crazy

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.710
and that actually resulted in YouTube

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.750
believing that our channels are somewhat
connected or similar

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:13.830
which made me the top recommended
channel in the recommended channels

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.540
section which made me very very happy
thank you guys!

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:22.140
in other news  YouTube finally recognized
us

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.140
as a channel of worth by giving us our
own URL

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:30.140
which is instead of the shit URL we
had up until now,

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.100
this sweet ass URL ...amv4fun!

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:37.929
right? thats super sweet... soooo in order to get the hype train

00:01:37.929 --> 00:01:41.799
going I'm gonna tell you what I am
currently working on

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:45.030
for there are a couple projects that might

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.079
interest you, for example yesterday I
watched the two newest episode of parasite

00:01:50.079 --> 00:01:53.780
and it was amazing! right after I finished

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.429
I started with my parasite AMV which is
going to be

00:01:57.429 --> 00:02:01.679
a similar style as my Tokyo ghoul one, I
hope you guys will like it

00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:05.020
the second project I'm working on is my
tutorial series

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:08.259
in which I'm going to show you all the
steps I take

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:11.790
from picking a song up until I upload my
video to Youtube

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:16.299
so... that will be a bigger project
spanning over multiple videos

00:02:16.299 --> 00:02:20.569
I'm super excited I hope you guys
appreciate it! I am currently also

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:22.610
working on it season recap

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:26.629
AMV which will show you all that best
shows best

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:30.040
scenes from that past season so you guys
don't miss

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:34.200
any great shows anymore and I'm working
on this project together with TopAnimeWeekly

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.680
so you know it will be super
awesome

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:41.879
I am also working on several MEPs / Collabs

00:02:41.879 --> 00:02:44.970
which I am NOT going to tell you
anything about

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:48.980
because where is the fun if you already
knew all my projects, right?

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:53.260
right! so that was it for me I hope you
guys weren't

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:57.150
that disappointed because I didn't
manage to make an

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:01.420
AMV the this time but this wasn't that
bad, right? it was fun

00:03:01.420 --> 00:03:03.420
fun...

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:05.420
