00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:11.280
This SKF training film is about self-aligning ball bearings

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:19.440
The self-aligning ball bearing consists of two rows of balls

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:21.560
secured and separated on the inner ring

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:26.160
by the cage and a sphered outer ring raceway

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:37.320
There are two types in self aligning ball bearings those are a parallel bore

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.520
and those with a tapered bore

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:43.430
This film concentrates on the tapered bore type because they are mounted

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:45.309
and dismounted in a particular way

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:49.320
The parallel bore types are mounted and dismounted with the same procedures

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:52.920
as used for deep groove ball bearings with a parallel bore

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:55.560
They are commonly used in applications like

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:58.240
 mixing, blending and stirring machinery

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:02.340
Also in intermediate shaft positions and fan applications where

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:06.980
the ability for self-alignment is important and the loads are relatively light

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:12.940
For the mounting the self-aligning ball bearing with tapered bore

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:16.220
SKF supplies a lock nut spanner kit that ensures

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:18.840
the correct bearing adjustment is achieved

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.580
Make sure that the work area is kept as clean as possible

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.759
Use some light oil on the mating bearing surfaces

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:30.679
Do not remove the bearing from its package untill everything is ready for mounting it

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.500
In this case the self-aligning ball bearing is mounted on an adapter sleeve

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:44.270
Put the bearing on the sleeve in its appropriate position

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:48.560
Screw on the lock nut but without the lock washer

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:57.240
Hand tighten the lock nut by using the lock nut spanner

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.060
until bearing and sleeve grip the shaft

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:04.600
Then mark the shaft at the start of the orange adjustment range

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.320
Using the handle turn the lock nut spanner up to the end

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:10.020
of the adjustment range

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.820
The correct bearing fit will have been achieved

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.460
Remove the lock not and place the lock washer

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.320
By securing the nut back on the sleeve

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.050
and by bending one of the lock washer tabs

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:37.700
into a matching slot in the nut

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:40.360
The correct mounting procedure for self aligning

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:44.360
ball bearingswith tapered bore is completed

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.780
To dismount the self aligning ball bearing

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:53.450
start by unbending the tab of the lock washer

00:02:53.450 --> 00:02:56.390
 and back off the lock nut with a turn

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.100
Place a suitable steel segment behind the bearing

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:07.660
and with some sharp hammer blows

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:10.140
the bearing will be driven off the tapered sleeve

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:12.800
releasing it from the shaft

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:23.760
The self-aligning ball bearing is supplied with a predetermined

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.780
amount of radial internal clearance

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.880
when driving the bearing up the tapered seating

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:31.200
take care not to drive it too far

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:33.420
so removing all the internal clearance

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:35.640
as this will impair the performance of the bearing

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:37.940
and dramatically reduce its life
