00:00:09.326 --> 00:00:11.833
I guess as any skier you are always looking for powder 

00:00:11.833 --> 00:00:15.183
and Chatter Creek here is renowned for some of the best powder in the world.

00:00:15.183 --> 00:00:18.603
I kind of had it in my mind, of big pillows, lots of snow.

00:00:18.782 --> 00:00:19.702
World class terrain,

00:00:19.702 --> 00:00:23.386
some of the best terrain that I've ever been around and sledded in.

00:00:23.588 --> 00:00:27.165
But it's the end of March and it feels like the end of May right now.

00:00:27.353 --> 00:00:30.082
We've been super lucky with the amount of sunshine we've been getting 

00:00:30.424 --> 00:00:34.328
but it's kind of made the snow pack not really sendable. 

00:00:34.328 --> 00:00:35.691
So we went to plan B.

00:00:36.042 --> 00:00:37.795
This is spring break 2013...

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:40.670
... I think it's about to get ridiculous.

00:00:56.506 --> 00:00:58.303
Shirts going to come off here pretty soon, 

00:00:58.505 --> 00:01:00.596
and were gonna do crowd pleasers off a wind lip. 

00:01:01.636 --> 00:01:02.508
Crown pleasers are back flips...

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:04.615
for the non spring breakers

00:01:08.605 --> 00:01:10.179
Yeah Duey, sender buddy!!

00:01:33.081 --> 00:01:34.908
So with Josh Dueck being out here, 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.161
he's in a sit ski and he's absolutely shredding on it

00:01:39.161 --> 00:01:41.524
and he kind of wanted to show us what its like.

00:01:42.048 --> 00:01:45.555
It's nice to see anybody learn from the beginning again 

00:01:45.555 --> 00:01:47.363
because it reminds me of the essence

00:01:47.583 --> 00:01:49.492
and the beauty of the sport of sit skiing.

00:02:01.293 --> 00:02:05.347
I don't need two skis any more, all I need is one and a chair.

00:02:11.588 --> 00:02:13.799
Hey Cody, turn down the suck.

00:02:22.892 --> 00:02:24.130
I give Josh a lot of credit 

00:02:24.328 --> 00:02:27.792
because that was probably one of the hardest things I have ever done.

00:02:28.714 --> 00:02:32.332
It's pretty inspiring what he is able to do with that sit ski.

00:02:58.482 --> 00:03:02.121
But on trips like this in the mountains, conditions aren't always ideal, 

00:03:02.121 --> 00:03:03.804
but you poke your head around long enough 

00:03:03.804 --> 00:03:06.007
and look around, you're always bound to find something good.

00:03:19.373 --> 00:03:20.229
Way to get it buddy.

00:03:21.006 --> 00:03:22.594
Yeah Leah, send it girl!

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:42.572
Ah, the crew recommends you get down as quick as possible

00:03:42.572 --> 00:03:44.555
ah, we'd all like to have a beer.

00:03:44.736 --> 00:03:45.528
Copy that.

00:04:01.864 --> 00:04:05.806
Human catapult to rail gap, on a sit ski.

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:18.158
That just happened.
