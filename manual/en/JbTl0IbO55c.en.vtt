00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:08.050
Putting bits in is the other thing, though,
you'll want to know.

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:14.160
And, if I were going to put in one of these
router bits, this how you do it.

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.780
I'm basically feeding it into the collet.

00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:23.090
You'll feel it bottom out and what you'll
want to do is just tighten it up slightly

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:24.090
at that point.

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.510
But then, pull it out slightly.

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:30.950
You don't want it making contact with the
bottom of the base there.

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:32.710
And then, tightening these up.

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:34.190
This is pretty typical of most routers.

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:38.350
Use two wrenches because there's two nuts
here that turn against each other.

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:44.590
So, what we're going to do is just get the
wrenches on.

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:46.880
Tighten the bit.

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:48.210
This you want to do pretty firmly.

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.640
You can do most of it by hand and then use
the wrenches.

00:00:52.640 --> 00:00:57.540
Get a bit tightened.

00:00:57.540 --> 00:00:58.770
Okay.

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.610
Now, depending on whether you're using a plunge
or stationary router, the next step involves

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:05.199
adjusting the heights.

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:06.930
And that's different on each of these.

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:08.900
This is the more complicated machine.

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:13.450
And, the way that you would set the height
on this machine is that you can use this little

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:15.790
turret system over here.

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:24.920
This is a way to gradually take material at
successive depths of the wood.

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:30.150
One of the limitations of routers, as opposed
to using a table saw dado blade, is that you

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.450
can't take out the full amount, probably,
that you want at once with a router bit.

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:35.450
So, for example.

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:42.110
With a three quarter inch bit, if I need to
go a half inch into the wood, I'm not going

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:43.729
to do that all in one pass.

00:01:43.729 --> 00:01:48.439
Usually, the rule of thumb for router bits
is you only want to take half of their width

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:50.380
and depth at any one time.

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:54.119
So, for a three quarter inch bit that means
my upper limit is going to be three eights

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:55.600
of depth in one pass.

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.189
I only want to go a quarter inch at a time.

00:01:58.189 --> 00:01:59.189
How do you do that?

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:02.340
That's what this turret system is for.

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:10.259
It lets you plunge down to an initial height
when you hit the top turret.

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.150
And then you can rotate over to the other
one for your next pass.

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:14.910
Plunge down a little more.

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:18.260
And these are graduated at different heights.

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:19.260
And you can customize it.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.320
But the ones I have it set at, you know, these
are offset by quarter inches.

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:25.660
And then it goes down an eighth and another
quarter.

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:30.530
So, depending on how deep you're going into
your wood you just keep going down in successive

00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:31.970
rotations of this turret.

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:35.750
So, the only work to do at the beginning is
setting the initial height.

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:43.060
And that basically involves loosening that
bar so it can move freely.

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:45.880
I'll plunge down until I hit the wood.

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:46.880
That's my zero.

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:48.370
Because I'm at the level of the wood.

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:51.690
So, what I want to do is just set my zeros,
be on.

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:55.300
I'll be on the top turret for that one.

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:56.340
That's going to be my zero.

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.880
So, I'll let that sit there.

00:02:58.880 --> 00:02:59.880
Lock the bar.

00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:01.710
Pop back up.

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:08.090
Now I know if I go from there to turret number
two, when I make this plunge I'm going to

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:11.400
be going down a quarter inch from the top
of this wood.

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:12.880
And only a quarter inch.

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:15.750
So, that's the goal of the plunge router turret
mechanism.

00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:19.890
It just controls the depth of how much can
go in each pass.

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:22.379
Now, actually operating this is very simple.

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:24.010
There's a power switch up here.

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:25.400
Now all these routers are slightly different.

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:28.380
But this model has the power switch in the
top.

00:03:28.380 --> 00:03:31.720
It has a lever which enables the plunge to
happen.

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:33.500
But you can see it's spring loaded.

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:38.410
So, while this lever is out it will just spring
back up if I don't let go.

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:41.780
If I let go of the lever down here, it stays.

00:03:41.780 --> 00:03:46.940
So, the typical way of operating this is turning
it on.

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:49.269
And you always have the face shield toward
you.

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:51.820
Turn it on.

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:52.840
Plunge down to your cut.

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:56.330
Let go of the lever so it stays down there.

00:03:56.330 --> 00:04:00.080
Make your cut and then plunge back up.

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:07.260
Now, the fixed router is even simpler because
we don't have to do any plunging.

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:11.630
[So,] the same principles apply in regard
to putting in the bits.

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:13.640
You get it in there.

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:15.030
You feel it bottom out.

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:17.579
And you want to pull it up slightly from there.

00:04:17.579 --> 00:04:19.039
Not very much.

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:22.270
You want as much as that shaft to be in there
as possible to reduce vibration.

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:26.009
But, you just don't want it bottomed out.

00:04:26.009 --> 00:04:27.069
Okay.

00:04:27.069 --> 00:04:30.249
Tighten that up.

00:04:30.249 --> 00:04:35.580
Now, with a station router situation, we don't
have the option of plunging.

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:38.110
We have to just set this at a height.

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:43.270
And in this case, if I'm trying to do what
this routers doing I'm going to have to set

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:47.029
the exposed amount of this bit to be a quarter
inch.

00:04:47.029 --> 00:04:49.560
Because that's the maximum I want to go in
a pass, right?

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:51.729
So, I'll set this to be a quarter inch.

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:53.979
It's very hard to set these just by eye.

00:04:53.979 --> 00:04:56.089
With a ruler or some other.

00:04:56.089 --> 00:04:57.659
There's a lot of other jigs you can use.

00:04:57.659 --> 00:05:01.189
But always, always test on a scrap piece before
you go to your final piece.

00:05:01.189 --> 00:05:02.189
Alright.

00:05:02.189 --> 00:05:03.189
So, let's see.

00:05:03.189 --> 00:05:04.189
I think I have it about right.

00:05:04.189 --> 00:05:05.499
A quarter inch.

00:05:05.499 --> 00:05:07.139
And now I can do my routing .

00:05:07.139 --> 00:05:12.479
So, if I wanted to make a slot starting from
the end of the piece of wood and going in,

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:13.849
I'm all set.

00:05:13.849 --> 00:05:20.220
I do my slots, then I have to go back in order
to go deeper.

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:22.830
Expose more of this and do another pass.

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:27.909
So, the only other thing to be concerned about
with routers is, you need to understand the

00:05:27.909 --> 00:05:29.550
rotation of the bit.

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:33.509
This determines which direction you're going
to push or pull the router.

00:05:33.509 --> 00:05:38.330
And it has a big impact on the performance
of the router and the quality of your cut.

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:43.659
Basically, what's happening here is, in the
router we've got a bit spinning clockwise,

00:05:43.659 --> 00:05:45.569
as you're looking down on it.

00:05:45.569 --> 00:05:50.879
So, what this means, in terms of cutting wood,
is that when wood is making contact with this

00:05:50.879 --> 00:05:55.789
router bit as it's spinning, I bring the wood
in or if I bring the router bit into the wood,

00:05:55.789 --> 00:05:59.559
rather, because we're using hand held.

00:05:59.559 --> 00:06:04.280
I'm going want to have some push back from
the wood onto the router bit.

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:11.740
So, if I'm spinning this way and I come into
the wood from the left, the wood is actually

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:12.740
going to push back.

00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:16.319
Because, as you can see, these cutting edges,
the silver part here, the cutting edge are

00:06:16.319 --> 00:06:17.930
actually digging out the wood.

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:21.389
And the wood is going to push back on the
bit.

00:06:21.389 --> 00:06:28.059
Now, the opposite, if you're coming from the
opposite direction, which is this way, what's

00:06:28.059 --> 00:06:31.729
happening is I'm pushing the router this way.

00:06:31.729 --> 00:06:35.919
And the bit is actually pulling the wood into
the cut.

00:06:35.919 --> 00:06:40.039
So, it's grabbing the wood and pushing it
in the same way that I'm going.

00:06:40.039 --> 00:06:43.330
It creates a very unstable kind of cut.

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:45.469
It can catch the wood in weird ways.

00:06:45.469 --> 00:06:49.860
And so, when you're doing this kind of cut
in the wrong direction, sometimes you catch

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:51.780
wood, depending on the orientation of the
wood.

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:55.930
But, you generally want to be coming from
the other direction.

00:06:55.930 --> 00:06:58.139
So, you always think of it this way.

00:06:58.139 --> 00:07:03.509
You're going to always wanting to be going
from left to right on the wood.

00:07:03.509 --> 00:07:08.649
So, the router bit orientation and the way
its spinning are important with routers.

00:07:08.649 --> 00:07:10.330
And we'll see that on the router table as
well.
