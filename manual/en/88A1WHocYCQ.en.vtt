"One and seven," Gianni Rodari.

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.860
I met a boy who was seven children.

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:18.520
He lived in Rome, called Paolo and his father was railroad man.

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:21.740
But he also lived in Paris, and was called Jean

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:25.020
and his father worked in an automobile factory.

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:29.840
But also lived in Berlin, and there was called Kurt

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:33.340
and his father was a professor of cello.

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:38.780
But he lived in Moscow, was named Yuri, as Gagarin the astronaut,

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:42.600
and his father was a bricklayer and studied mathematics.

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.670
But also lived in New York, called Jimmy and his father owned a gas station.

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:56.900
How many have I said? Five. Missing two.

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:04.120
One was called Chu, lived in Shanghai and his father was a fisherman;

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:09.140
the last was called Paul, lived in Buenos Aires

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:12.960
and his father was a house painter.

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.720
Paolo, Jean, Kurt, Yuri, Jimmy Chu and Paul

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.720
were seven, but they were the same child and was eight,

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:32.520
could read and write and rode bike without putting hands on the handlebars.

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:38.570
Paolo was dark, Jean was blond and Kurt Brown,

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:41.620
but they were the same child.

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:47.860
Yuri had white skin and Chu yellow skin,

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:53.000
but they were the same child. Paul went to the movies in Spanish,

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:57.920
and Jimmy in English, but they were the same child

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:00.340
and laughed in the same language.

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:05.240
Now the seven are older and can no longer make war,

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:10.320
because the seven are one man.

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:15.520
