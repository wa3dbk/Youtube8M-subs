Hi, my name's Rachel Youens, and I'm a freelance
fashion writer, and the owner of austinstylewatch.com

00:00:06.610 --> 00:00:10.940
street fashion site, and today we're going
to talk about how to dress if you're going

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:15.190
to a rave. Now, if you've never been to a
rave before you might want to get online first

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:19.390
and do a little research, look at a couple
photos and kind of know what you're in for,

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:24.939
but think of it a little bit as like a big
costume party. But even within that costume

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:29.960
party, there's still kind of a certain dress
code that you want to wear that best goes

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:36.620
with your environment. First of all, bright
colors, bright day-glo, UV sensitive. There's

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.229
usually a lot of black lights at raves, so
things that are going to be sensitive under

00:00:40.229 --> 00:00:48.889
a black light. White clothing, really day-glo
bright clothing is good to wear; pinks, oranges,

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:56.539
yellows. Think of all the colors that are
in highlighters. So another thing; layering.

00:00:56.539 --> 00:01:00.780
You're going to be doing a lot of dancing.
It may be cold outside when you come in. You

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:05.930
may be sweating, go back outside; be cold,
so you're going to want to layer a lot. A

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:13.040
lot of girls choose to wear like halter or
bra tops with something sheer over top of

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:21.509
it, sort of like a fishnet. And the layering
also produces a neat U effect under UV light,

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:27.299
where the orange is going to be glowing a
little bit brighter than the pink. The next

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:31.280
thing you're want to wanna' do is not carry
a purse. You're going to want to have some

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:37.200
kind of bag that isn't your big old lugging
around kind of purse, so things a lot of people

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:43.560
carry are like fanny packs or waist packs,
or a lot of people also carry backpacks. If

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.180
you have like a fun, kind of crazy, kid-like
backpack; maybe it's like a stuffed animal,

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:55.229
it's good kind of one to carry. As far as
makeup goes, this is the place to go all out.

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:01.899
This is the place to bring out your fake eyelashes,
your glittery makeup. So, what we have here

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:07.560
is kind of a bright pink costume makeup. And
you can get stuff like this at your local

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:13.950
costume shop. It's different from the makeup
you're going to get at like a convenience

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:18.140
store or grocery store or something like that
in that it's really bright and it's made to

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:22.970
stick. It's like stage makeup. So, going to
a costume shop for that kind of thing is a

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:27.580
good place to go. And the last thing you're
going to need are comfortable shoes. This

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:31.140
is not the type of party you wear high heels
to. You're going to be dancing. There's going

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.489
to be lots of people dancing around you that
might step on your feet, so you're going to

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:40.010
want to wear some sort of bright, colorful
tennis shoe. So, this has been how to draw,

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:41.120
dress for your first rave.
