00:00:00.039 --> 00:00:01.054
-What's happenin' guys?

00:00:01.054 --> 00:00:03.081
Oh, not a lot has happened this week,

00:00:03.081 --> 00:00:06.081
I mean, other than this motherf--king cat who's possessed by Satan.

00:00:06.081 --> 00:00:08.060
[cat meowing demonically]

00:00:18.064 --> 00:00:20.089
Behind me Satan, behind me.

00:00:20.089 --> 00:00:24.060
Actually that's not a bible, it's a copy of The Walking Dead.

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:26.087
But I'm actually not playing when I say that cat is possessed.

00:00:26.087 --> 00:00:27.067
I mean, look at him.

00:00:27.067 --> 00:00:29.020
His fur's all puffeh,

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:30.031
his eyes are all red.

00:00:30.031 --> 00:00:32.096
And he's speaking in some kind of Ewok language.

00:00:32.096 --> 00:00:35.057
-[meowing demonically]

00:00:35.057 --> 00:00:38.040
-Now, this video did get 140,000 views in two days,

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:41.028
and Hayley Williams promoted it on her Tumblr account.

00:00:41.028 --> 00:00:43.068
Yeah, you know, Hayley Williams, that hot chick,

00:00:43.068 --> 00:00:45.014
that singer from Paramour.

00:00:45.014 --> 00:00:46.076
[wolf whistle]

00:00:46.076 --> 00:00:49.020
Honesty, I don't know why the cat is so mad.

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.077
If I had to guess, I'd say somebody was f--king with it.

00:00:51.077 --> 00:00:54.098
Either way, that cat needs to calm down.

00:00:54.098 --> 00:00:57.092
Go smoke a fat bowl of catnip there, Heathcliff.

00:00:57.092 --> 00:01:00.003
By the way, because I'm just a nice guy,

00:01:00.003 --> 00:01:04.008
I took the liberty of translating what the cat was saying and putting it in subtitles.

00:01:11.003 --> 00:01:13.056
Now, come on, I'm paraphrasing of course.

00:01:13.056 --> 00:01:15.054
Now dating sucks.

00:01:15.054 --> 00:01:16.041
We all know that.

00:01:16.041 --> 00:01:18.099
And video dating services have been around forever,

00:01:18.099 --> 00:01:21.031
including the Dating on Demand service.

00:01:21.031 --> 00:01:24.055
Now, with this service, you can choose among the lucky individuals here

00:01:24.055 --> 00:01:27.057
and then proceed to date them or hump them or stab them

00:01:27.057 --> 00:01:29.001
or whatever it is you do on your dates.

00:01:29.001 --> 00:01:32.000
Now, in one of the interviews, this chick here, Audrey...

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.011
now, don't get me wrong, Audrey's cool,

00:01:34.011 --> 00:01:36.023
she just gives a little bit too much information.

00:01:36.023 --> 00:01:42.011
-The craziest thing I've ever done was have the FedEx man come into my workplace

00:01:42.011 --> 00:01:43.031
and I did him.

00:01:43.031 --> 00:01:45.019
-I'm sorry, you did what?

00:01:45.019 --> 00:01:50.070
-The craziest thing I've ever down was have the FedEx man come into my workplace

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:52.024
and I did him.

00:01:52.024 --> 00:01:55.038
-I'm sorry, again, I could've sworn you said you did the FedEx guy.

00:01:55.038 --> 00:01:58.042
So you're saying that the FedEx guy shows up to your house with a delivery

00:01:58.042 --> 00:02:01.070
and you sign for that delivery using his d--k

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:03.076
and now you're talking about it in your dating video?

00:02:03.076 --> 00:02:06.017
Oh, Audrey, baby, what else you got?

00:02:06.017 --> 00:02:08.031
-My guilty pleasure is...

00:02:08.031 --> 00:02:11.013
cheating, but then it's all good.

00:02:12.095 --> 00:02:15.036
-All right, your guilty pleasure is cheating.

00:02:15.036 --> 00:02:17.092
Why on Earth are you still single?

00:02:17.092 --> 00:02:20.038
Did you cheat on that FedEx guy with the UPS man?

00:02:20.038 --> 00:02:21.032
Is that was happened?

00:02:21.032 --> 00:02:25.021
No, look, there are tons of these Dating on Demand videos on YouTube

00:02:25.021 --> 00:02:26.084
and a lot of them have gone viral before.

00:02:26.084 --> 00:02:30.028
Now it looks like this one was shot directly from someone's television

00:02:30.028 --> 00:02:31.091
using a crappy quality camera,

00:02:31.091 --> 00:02:32.092
and now, other than that,

00:02:32.092 --> 00:02:37.063
let me just say that the troll comments on Audrey's video are just too much to handle.

00:02:37.063 --> 00:02:40.039
"Maybe I'll date her after she shaves her mustache."

00:02:40.039 --> 00:02:43.011
"That FedEx guy sure delivered his package."

00:02:43.011 --> 00:02:45.064
And, "Is it wrong that this video game me a boner?"

00:02:45.064 --> 00:02:49.092
Now most of these videos are unfortunately hilarious.

00:02:49.092 --> 00:02:53.008
And I unfortunately because, you know, they're just trying to get a date.

00:02:53.008 --> 00:02:56.038
But then, of course, they go off like Audrey and f--k the FedEx guy.

00:02:56.038 --> 00:02:59.066
Now the big video this week was actually really big.

00:02:59.066 --> 00:03:02.060
It actually got 2.5 million views in two days

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:04.050
and it'll probably get more by the time you see this.

00:03:04.050 --> 00:03:07.048
Now there's this half-time slam dunk show here.

00:03:07.048 --> 00:03:10.042
Now pay attention to this skinny white kid here.

00:03:10.042 --> 00:03:13.031
[crowd cheering]

00:03:13.031 --> 00:03:16.025
[crowd groans]

00:03:16.025 --> 00:03:18.006
Holy s--t, no way that was real.

00:03:18.006 --> 00:03:19.049
I mean it looked cool, but

00:03:19.049 --> 00:03:22.052
how could he purposely pull off that without breaking his neck?

00:03:22.052 --> 00:03:23.056
[crack!]

00:03:23.056 --> 00:03:26.010
Now I'm not a scientist, but I do know sometimes

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:27.077
gravity can f--k people up.

00:03:27.077 --> 00:03:29.068
But also, this video might be fake.

00:03:29.068 --> 00:03:33.015
I mean, it might really be part of some Phoenix Suns halftime show.

00:03:33.015 --> 00:03:37.005
But I have to point out that that kid did kind of bust his head on the back of that rim.

00:03:37.005 --> 00:03:39.074
[tires squeal, crash!]

00:03:39.074 --> 00:03:41.058
Which doesn't seem worth faking a stunt like this

00:03:41.058 --> 00:03:42.077
and I can't help but wonder,

00:03:42.077 --> 00:03:45.072
how many point do you get in basketball for slam dunking yourself?

00:03:45.072 --> 00:03:48.009
It kind of reminds me of that old rap album cover

00:03:48.009 --> 00:03:50.053
where that pimp is slam dunkin' his ho.

00:03:50.053 --> 00:03:54.024
I mean, slam dunkin' a ho has got to be worth at least 8 or 9 points.

00:03:54.024 --> 00:03:56.085
Now another thing I noticed in the video was the crowd's reaction

00:03:56.085 --> 00:03:58.000
or lack thereof.

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.080
Like this kid could've seriously injured

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:01.047
and they're all just sittin' there like,

00:04:01.047 --> 00:04:03.037
"Meh, slam duck was cool.

00:04:03.037 --> 00:04:06.059
But did you see the homeless guy with the golden voice?"

00:04:06.059 --> 00:04:10.030
No, but I saw the homeless girl who f--ked the FedEx guy, does that count?

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:11.032
-I did him.

00:04:11.032 --> 00:04:14.082
-I'm kidding, calm down; she's not homeless.

00:04:14.082 --> 00:04:15.097
She's just horny.

00:04:15.097 --> 00:04:18.044
No, but the crowd didn't seem to react to that,

00:04:18.044 --> 00:04:19.095
which makes me think it might be fake.

00:04:19.095 --> 00:04:22.019
Except for the black guys in the audience,

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:24.016
'cause you know they were all laughing like,

00:04:24.016 --> 00:04:26.030
"Look at these crazy white kids trying to dunk."

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:29.089
But you know who does go off and f--k the FedEx guy?

00:04:29.089 --> 00:04:30.096
-I did him.

00:04:30.096 --> 00:04:33.047
-The comment question of the day, which comes from a user named, bam!,

00:04:33.047 --> 00:04:34.049
and she said...

00:04:34.049 --> 00:04:35.080
-Hey, Ray.

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:37.005
My comment question of the day:

00:04:37.005 --> 00:04:38.080
PlayStation, Xbox?

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:40.000
-So, pretty simple:

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.004
PlayStation or Xbox?
