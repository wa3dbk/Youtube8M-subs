00:00:06.499 --> 00:00:10.230
LG KS660 and GD910 Preview.

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:16.670
Probably the last two mobile phone announcements
from a mainstream manufacturer in 2008, the

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:23.380
LG KS660 and GD910 are two very different
devices due for release next year.

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:24.960
LG KS660.

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:34.230
LG's first dual-SIM phone, the LG KS660 comes
with a large 3" 400 x 240 pixel touchscreen

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:37.010
and a 5 megapixel camera.

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:42.670
LG are only the second major manufacturer
to launch a dual-SIM device such as this,

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:48.780
and the closest competitor to the KS660 is
going to be the Samsung D980 DuoS which has

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.809
a smaller screen.

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:57.780
One obvious major drawback we can see with
the KS660 is that it is a GSM-only device.

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:03.450
Neither LG nor Samsung have been able to create
a dual-SIM handset that does 3G, and this

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:08.609
is a shame because a phone like the KS660
would lend itself to high-speed downloads

00:01:08.609 --> 00:01:11.060
and uploads quite well.

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:16.619
As with the Samsung DuoS range, the KS660
seems to be aimed at Russia and surrounding

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:23.770
countries as LG say that the handwriting recognition
supports English, Ukrainian, Russian, Kazakh,

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:26.840
Lithuanian and Estonian languages.

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:32.670
There's no word on exact specifications, pricing
or availability at present.

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.750
LG GD910.

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:40.229
Taking a completely different approach is
the LG GD910 wristwatch phone due to be shown

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:41.840
next month.

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:49.159
This tiny device has a 1.4" touchscreen display,
an MP3 player, Bluetooth, speakerphone and

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:54.340
HSDPA support so that it can enjoy 3.5G downloads.

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:59.869
Video calling is supported through a camera
on the front, and the GD910 also has speech

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:05.340
dialling and a text-to-speech function to
read back text on the tiny display.

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:10.200
LG haven't given full details of the phone,
but it will be interesting to see just how

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.390
much it weighs and what the battery life is
like when full details are known in a few

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:14.840
weeks time.
