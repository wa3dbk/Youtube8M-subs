00:00:00.689 --> 00:00:06.150
Hello people now we are going to see how to
create space invaders with our game maker 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:08.099
first lets put some

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:15.099
devils out there

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:23.980
I'm changing the background to red color

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:36.410
now i'm going to add one more sprite

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:43.410
to be the boundary

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.460
I added wall sprites

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.560
these walls are going to be boundaries

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:54.850
Let me add the remaining tank

00:00:54.850 --> 00:01:01.020
and bullet sprites

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:05.580
we need uh... events and actions for
devils to move and tank to

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:06.880
shoot

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:08.720
so i'm going to add

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:15.720
timer event move action to the devil

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:23.010
upon clicking the add rule we need to
fill out the form inorder to add the action

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.480
we can also use this slider to fill
out the angle

00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:29.790
now we are going to add

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:33.590
collision even between devil and wall

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:35.490
you might have seen that

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.960
even list has been dynamically updated

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.900
we can also add

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:45.960
more than one action at the same time

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:52.960
appropriate action forms will pop up

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:10.029
so i'm selecting devil here

00:02:10.029 --> 00:02:17.029
now we have added enough actions for the
devils to move

00:02:18.399 --> 00:02:20.189
we can hit re-build to

00:02:20.189 --> 00:02:22.299
go back to same position

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:29.299
now I'm adding shoot action to the tank

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:35.609
i'm adding move event

00:02:35.609 --> 00:02:42.609
key event to the tank

00:02:45.659 --> 00:02:49.400
now that I have added move action
to the devil

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.649
and shoot action to the tank

00:02:52.649 --> 00:02:54.099
and disappear event

00:02:54.099 --> 00:02:55.599
for the devils

00:02:55.599 --> 00:02:56.459
so now I can 

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:58.699
move the tank

00:03:01.519 --> 00:03:03.329
as well as

00:03:03.329 --> 00:03:10.329
shoot the devils

00:03:13.949 --> 00:03:16.479
I need sheild

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:23.439
to protect the tank so we are going to
add sheilds now

00:03:23.439 --> 00:03:27.159
now the sheilds are in place

00:03:27.159 --> 00:03:30.829
now i'm going to add contract event
to the sheilds

00:03:30.829 --> 00:03:37.829
upon collision with the bullets

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:44.029
now I have added game overcondition 
for the...

00:03:44.029 --> 00:03:47.049
collision event, between tank - devil

00:03:47.049 --> 00:03:49.499
so, when the devil hits

00:03:49.499 --> 00:03:50.499
the tank

00:03:50.499 --> 00:03:57.499
we will loose the game

00:04:17.719 --> 00:04:24.719
the devil is approaching the tank

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:30.210
we successfully lost the game!
