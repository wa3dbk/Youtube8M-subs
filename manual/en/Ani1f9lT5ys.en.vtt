Hello, I’m Dr. Neal Schultz

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:03.640
[pause]

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:09.210
and welcome to DermTV.

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.860
Unwanted hair is a reality for everybody,
whether men or women. Today, I’d

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:19.150
like to discuss the removal of unwanted hair
for women, and I’ll discuss

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:24.550
temporary hair removal and in another video
discuss permanent hair removal.

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:28.239
There are two levels at which you can do temporary
hair removal. The first

00:00:28.239 --> 00:00:31.269
is removing the hair just at the surface of
the skin and the other is

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:34.960
removing it all the way from the bottom from
the root. Let’s talk about the

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:41.359
surface removal first. Obviously the easiest,
fastest and least expensive

00:00:41.359 --> 00:00:45.100
is just shaving. Shaving your legs in the
shower is a regular routine for

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:50.170
many women and it’s no big deal. If you
have unwanted facial hair, women

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:54.530
are appropriately and understandably somewhat
emotionally reluctant to

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:59.129
shave their faces and so that may not be a
suitable form for that hair

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:02.690
removal. The other way of removing it at the
surface is with chemical

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:07.110
depilatories which are chemicals which usually
have alkali and sulfur in

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:12.180
them that actually dissolves the hair. You
see hair is made of keratin and

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:17.560
these substances actually dissolve keratin,
the problem is there’s keratin

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:22.280
in the surface of your skin so if you use
it too strong, too much or too

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:26.600
long you can actually dissolve off some of
your skin and get an irritation

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.850
or a burn. So, usually there are instructions
about testing it and making

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.399
sure that you don’t use it in sensitive
areas and you don’t use it too

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:37.610
long. Regardless which of these techniques
you use, you’re going to have to

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:42.119
repeat the maintenance everyday or every other
day depending on the rate of

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:46.920
growth of your hair. Other techniques involve
removing the hair from the

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:51.969
root and whether that’s plucking, waxing
or threading, they all run the

00:01:51.969 --> 00:01:55.759
risk of increased incidence of ingrown hairs
and there are a lot of

00:01:55.759 --> 00:01:59.950
episodes on DermTV where I discuss why waxing
causes ingrown hairs and how

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:03.831
to treat ingrown hairs and so on. But on the
other hand, because you’re

00:02:03.831 --> 00:02:07.259
removing the hair from the root, maintenance
is much less infrequent

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:11.360
because it takes the hair much longer to grow
back. Of those three

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.220
techniques waxing is pretty fast because it
removes a lot of hair at one

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:20.490
time, as opposed to plucking or threading
which removes individual hairs,

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:24.071
plucking is inexpensive you can do it by yourself
but of course it’s time

00:02:24.071 --> 00:02:28.460
consuming and threading is usually done by
professionals and despite the

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:31.970
fact that they are removing one hair at a
time, I must tell you the way

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:35.410
I’ve seen professional threaders remove
hair, they remove it remarkably

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:40.330
quickly. So, all of these forms of hair removal
have advantages,

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:44.270
disadvantages but they all have in common
the fact that they’re temporary,

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:48.000
they require some maintenance and in another
episode we’ll talk about laser

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.091
hair removal and electrolysis which are permanent
forms of hair removal.
