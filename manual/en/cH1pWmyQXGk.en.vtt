00:00:01.467 --> 00:00:09.567
(music)

00:00:09.567 --> 00:00:11.667
(wind)

00:00:11.667 --> 00:00:13.066
&gt;&gt; WHAT WILL TEXAS LOOK LIKE

00:00:13.066 --> 00:00:16.066
100 YEARS IN THE FUTURE?

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:18.967
WHAT ARE WE DOING NOW

00:00:18.967 --> 00:00:19.900
THAT WILL HAVE THE GREATEST

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:22.900
SIGNIFICANCE THEN?

00:00:24.367 --> 00:00:25.667
WHERE WILL OUR MOST BASIC

00:00:25.667 --> 00:00:27.367
RESOURCES COME FROM?

00:00:27.367 --> 00:00:28.333
FOOD?

00:00:28.333 --> 00:00:29.133
WATER?

00:00:29.133 --> 00:00:32.033
ENERGY?

00:00:32.033 --> 00:00:33.800
ONE THING WE KNOW IS THAT THE

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.433
CLIMATE WILL BE DIFFERENT.

00:00:37.433 --> 00:00:39.200
WE ALSO KNOW THE SEA LEVEL

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:42.166
WILL BE HIGHER.

00:00:42.166 --> 00:00:43.467
WE KNOW IT BECAUSE IT IS

00:00:43.467 --> 00:00:45.166
HAPPENING RIGHT NOW,

00:00:45.166 --> 00:00:48.633
RIGHT HERE IN TEXAS.

00:00:48.633 --> 00:00:50.000
YOU JUST HAVE TO LOOK VERY

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.367
CLOSELY AND BE VERY,

00:00:52.367 --> 00:00:55.367
VERY PATIENT.

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:01.467
&gt;&gt; BASED ON TIDE GAUGES THAT

00:01:01.467 --> 00:01:04.300
WE'VE HAD SINCE THE EARLY

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:06.600
1900'S IN SOME CASES,

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.166
WE'RE SEEING ABOUT ONE TO

00:01:08.166 --> 00:01:11.166
TWO FEET IN 100 YEARS.

00:01:12.734 --> 00:01:15.567
THAT TRANSLATES INTO ABOUT TWO

00:01:15.567 --> 00:01:17.700
AND A HALF MILLIMETERS PER YEAR

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.467
TO ABOUT SIX AND A HALF

00:01:19.467 --> 00:01:22.100
MILLIMETERS PER YEAR.

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:23.734
SO IT'S A SUBSTANTIAL RATE, A

00:01:23.734 --> 00:01:26.867
BIT HIGHER THAN THE GLOBAL RATE.

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:29.800
&gt;&gt; DEPENDING WHERE YOU ARE IN

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:31.967
TEXAS, THE SEA LEVEL IS RISING

00:01:31.967 --> 00:01:33.867
AT DIFFERENT RATES.

00:01:33.867 --> 00:01:35.500
&gt;&gt; THERE'S HIGHER RATES ON THE

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.800
UPPER TEXAS COAST,

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:40.567
RATES DECREASE SOMEWHAT DOWN

00:01:40.567 --> 00:01:44.400
INTO THE CORPUS CHRISTI AREA

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:46.133
AND DECREASE EVEN FURTHER

00:01:46.133 --> 00:01:47.734
DOWN IN THE PADRE ISLAND

00:01:47.734 --> 00:01:51.033
NATIONAL SEASHORE,

00:01:51.033 --> 00:01:52.433
AND INCREASE A LITTLE BIT

00:01:52.433 --> 00:01:53.800
DOWN NEAR THE RIO GRANDE

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.800
DELTA AREA.

00:01:59.133 --> 00:02:00.734
&gt;&gt; IN MARCH OF 2010, THE HARTE

00:02:00.734 --> 00:02:02.533
RESEARCH INSTITUTE FOR GULF OF

00:02:02.533 --> 00:02:04.600
MEXICO STUDIES AND TEXAS A &amp; M

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:06.367
UNIVERSITY IN CORPUS CHRISTI,

00:02:06.367 --> 00:02:07.633
HOSTED AN INTERNATIONAL

00:02:07.633 --> 00:02:09.467
CONFERENCE ON SEA LEVEL RISE

00:02:09.467 --> 00:02:11.533
IN THE GULF OF MEXICO.

00:02:11.533 --> 00:02:13.300
&gt;&gt; THIS IS A ONE WAY STREET.

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:15.533
SEA LEVEL DOESN'T JUST SUDDENLY

00:02:15.533 --> 00:02:18.333
GO DOWN AGAIN, IT WILL CONTINUE

00:02:18.333 --> 00:02:20.033
THAT UPWARD TREND AND CONTINUE

00:02:20.033 --> 00:02:22.066
RISING FOR THE FORESEEABLE

00:02:22.066 --> 00:02:23.633
FUTURE.

00:02:23.633 --> 00:02:27.233
(music)

00:02:27.233 --> 00:02:29.367
THE QUESTION IS JUST HOW MUCH

00:02:29.367 --> 00:02:32.033
IS SEA LEVEL GOING TO RISE?

00:02:33.333 --> 00:02:35.967
(splash)

00:02:35.967 --> 00:02:38.133
ANTARCTICA AND GREENLAND HOLD

00:02:38.133 --> 00:02:40.433
A CENTRAL POSITION IN THE SEA

00:02:40.433 --> 00:02:42.934
LEVEL RISE DEBATE BECAUSE THE

00:02:42.934 --> 00:02:44.767
ICE SHEETS HOLD A GREAT

00:02:44.767 --> 00:02:47.233
DEAL OF ICE THAT COULD MELT

00:02:47.233 --> 00:02:48.500
AND BECOME PART OF THE OCEANS

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:51.500
AND WOULD RAISE THE OCEANS.

00:02:52.467 --> 00:02:53.367
AND THIS IS THE BIGGEST

00:02:53.367 --> 00:02:54.700
UNCERTAINTY THAT WE HAVE

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.834
ABOUT SEA LEVEL RISE.

00:02:57.834 --> 00:02:59.100
THERE ARE OTHER CONTRIBUTIONS

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:00.900
TO FUTURE SEA LEVEL RISE WHICH

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:02.900
ARE THE THERMAL EXPANSION OF THE

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:06.000
OCEANS AND THE CONTRIBUTION FROM

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.367
MOUNTAIN GLACIERS AROUND THE

00:03:07.367 --> 00:03:09.467
WORLD, BUT THOSE THINGS ARE

00:03:09.467 --> 00:03:12.300
RELATIVELY PREDICTABLE COMPARED

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.033
TO THE UNCERTAINTY THAT WE HAVE

00:03:14.033 --> 00:03:16.200
OVER ANTARCTICA AND GREENLAND,

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:19.200
THE BIG ICE SHEETS.

00:03:24.934 --> 00:03:26.333
&gt;&gt; ANTARCTICA AND GREENLAND

00:03:26.333 --> 00:03:28.734
ARE A LONG WAY FROM TEXAS.

00:03:28.734 --> 00:03:32.000
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:32.900
&gt;&gt; SUMMERS ARE JUST AS HOT

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:34.066
AS THEY'VE ALWAYS BEEN.

00:03:34.066 --> 00:03:35.533
WHAT WE ARE SEEING IS CHANGES

00:03:35.533 --> 00:03:37.734
IN WINTER TEMPERATURES.

00:03:37.734 --> 00:03:38.734
OUR WINTERS HAVE BEEN GETTING

00:03:38.734 --> 00:03:42.767
WARMER SINCE ABOUT 1991.

00:03:42.767 --> 00:03:44.233
ALMOST SIX TO SEVEN DEGREES

00:03:44.233 --> 00:03:47.033
WARMER IN THE WINTER...

00:03:47.033 --> 00:03:50.033
THAT'S PRETTY SIGNIFICANT.

00:03:50.667 --> 00:03:51.633
&gt;&gt; THESE TEMPERATURE READINGS

00:03:51.633 --> 00:03:53.700
COME FROM THE ROUTINE SAMPLING

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.066
THAT TEXAS PARKS AND WILDLIFE

00:03:55.066 --> 00:03:58.066
HAS DONE SINCE 1974.

00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:00.900
&gt;&gt; WITH OUR NET SAMPLES THEY

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:03.367
GATHER NUMBER OF SPECIES CAUGHT.

00:04:03.367 --> 00:04:04.000
&gt;&gt; GET A FIN CLIP ALSO

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:04.967
ON THAT ONE.

00:04:04.967 --> 00:04:06.166
&gt;&gt; THE SIZE OF THE SPECIES.

00:04:06.166 --> 00:04:07.800
&gt;&gt; IT'S OVER A METER LONG.

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:08.934
&gt;&gt; AND THEY COLLECT

00:04:08.934 --> 00:04:10.500
ENVIRONMENTAL MEASUREMENTS

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:11.900
ALONG WITH THE SAMPLES.

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:13.900
&gt;&gt; TEMPERATURE'S 27.8

00:04:17.166 --> 00:04:18.033
&gt;&gt; IT'S ONE OF THE MOST

00:04:18.033 --> 00:04:19.033
COMPREHENSIVE MONITOR

00:04:19.033 --> 00:04:22.333
PROGRAMS IN THE WORLD.

00:04:22.333 --> 00:04:24.033
&gt;&gt; WITH CLIMATE CHANGE THERE ARE

00:04:24.033 --> 00:04:27.266
WINNERS AND LOSERS.

00:04:27.266 --> 00:04:28.400
&gt;&gt; FLOUNDER HAVE DECLINED.

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:31.133
THEY'RE WINTER SPAWNERS.

00:04:31.133 --> 00:04:33.000
THEY SEEM TO REQUIRE COLD

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.166
WINTERS TO PRODUCE MORE

00:04:34.166 --> 00:04:36.033
JUVENILES.

00:04:36.033 --> 00:04:37.166
THE WARMER THE WINTER THE FEWER

00:04:37.166 --> 00:04:40.567
FLOUNDER JUVENILES WE SEE.

00:04:40.567 --> 00:04:41.400
(splash)

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:43.767
&gt;&gt; THERE HE GOES.

00:04:43.767 --> 00:04:45.867
&gt;&gt; OTHER SPECIES ARE INCREASING.

00:04:45.867 --> 00:04:46.500
&gt;&gt; WE'RE SEEING MORE

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:48.000
TROPICAL SPECIES.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.934
IN PARTICULAR, GRAY SNAPPER,

00:04:49.934 --> 00:04:51.266
THEY'LL DIE BELOW ABOUT 50

00:04:51.266 --> 00:04:53.967
DEGREES WATER TEMPERATURE

00:04:53.967 --> 00:04:56.233
AND SINCE ABOUT '91 WE'VE HAD

00:04:56.233 --> 00:04:57.400
ALMOST NO WINTERS GET THAT

00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:59.033
COLD AND THEIR POPULATION

00:04:59.033 --> 00:05:02.333
HAS INCREASED EXPONENTIALLY.

00:05:02.333 --> 00:05:03.633
&gt;&gt; WE ARE ALSO SEEING CHANGES

00:05:03.633 --> 00:05:04.834
WITH THE MIGRATION OF

00:05:04.834 --> 00:05:06.767
PLANTS SPECIES.

00:05:06.767 --> 00:05:08.133
&gt;&gt; BLACK MANGROVE, ROCKPORT USED

00:05:08.133 --> 00:05:09.934
TO BE THEIR NORTHERN LIMIT

00:05:09.934 --> 00:05:11.300
BUT SINCE THESE WARMER WINTERS,

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:12.767
THEY HAVE MOVED NORTHWARD ALONG

00:05:12.767 --> 00:05:13.700
THE COAST, THEY'RE AS FAR

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:16.000
UP AS PALACIOS NOW.

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.834
THERE'S A RED MANGROVE WHICH IS

00:05:17.834 --> 00:05:19.500
CHARACTERISTIC OF THE CARIBBEAN

00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:21.000
AND WE'RE STARTING TO SEE SOME

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.700
AREAS BECOME POPULATED WITH

00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:25.433
RED MANGROVES.

00:05:25.433 --> 00:05:26.400
&gt;&gt; WHAT WILL CLIMATE CHANGE

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:27.867
AND SEA LEVEL RISE MEAN

00:05:27.867 --> 00:05:30.066
FOR TEXAS IN THE FUTURE?

00:05:30.066 --> 00:05:31.734
SCIENTISTS PREDICT THAT IN 100

00:05:31.734 --> 00:05:33.467
YEARS THE SEA LEVEL COULD

00:05:33.467 --> 00:05:35.433
RISE THREE FEET.

00:05:35.433 --> 00:05:36.700
THAT WOULD SIGNIFICANTLY

00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:38.934
ALTER OUR COASTLINE.

00:05:38.934 --> 00:05:40.767
&gt;&gt; THE CURRENT SEA LEVEL RISE

00:05:40.767 --> 00:05:42.367
IS NOT A SITUATION THAT HUMANS

00:05:42.367 --> 00:05:44.567
HAVE FACED IN MODERN TIMES.

00:05:44.567 --> 00:05:45.834
THAT IS SINCE WE'VE STARTED

00:05:45.834 --> 00:05:47.867
TO CREATE, BUILT ENVIRONMENTS,

00:05:47.867 --> 00:05:50.266
CITIES AND BULKHEADS AND THINGS

00:05:50.266 --> 00:05:51.700
ALONG THE COAST SEA LEVEL

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:53.100
HAS NEVER BEEN RISING

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:54.567
IN THAT PERIOD.

00:05:54.567 --> 00:05:56.133
SEA LEVEL IS GOING TO RISE

00:05:56.133 --> 00:05:57.266
BETWEEN A METER AND TWO IN

00:05:57.266 --> 00:05:58.700
THE NEXT 100 YEARS.

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:00.567
WE ACTUALLY CAN'T CHANGE THAT

00:06:00.567 --> 00:06:01.700
AT THIS POINT.

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:02.934
SO WHAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO

00:06:02.934 --> 00:06:04.166
DO IS ADAPT TO IT AND THERE

00:06:04.166 --> 00:06:05.667
ARE TWO WAYS TO DO IT.

00:06:05.667 --> 00:06:07.467
ONE IS TO TRY TO DEFEND,

00:06:07.467 --> 00:06:08.767
THE WAY THE NETHERLANDS HAS

00:06:08.767 --> 00:06:09.967
HISTORICALLY OVER THE LAST

00:06:09.967 --> 00:06:13.300
THOUSAND YEARS OR YOU CAN

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:15.967
MOVE, AND RETREAT FROM IT.

00:06:15.967 --> 00:06:17.500
AND I HAVE TO SAY WE'RE NOT

00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:19.166
GOING TO DEFEND MOST PLACES

00:06:19.166 --> 00:06:20.367
ON THE COAST BECAUSE IT'S

00:06:20.367 --> 00:06:21.867
SIMPLY GOING TO BE TOO HARD

00:06:21.867 --> 00:06:23.600
AND TOO EXPENSIVE.

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:25.667
SO WE WILL DEFEND SOME PLACES,

00:06:25.667 --> 00:06:27.100
BUT WE WILL IN FACT RETREAT

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:28.567
FROM MOST PLACES AT THE COAST

00:06:28.567 --> 00:06:30.967
OVER THE NEXT CENTURY.

00:06:30.967 --> 00:06:39.800
(music)

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:41.233
HISTORICALLY SEA LEVEL HAS GONE

00:06:41.233 --> 00:06:43.567
UP AND DOWN OVER GEOLOGIC TIME

00:06:43.567 --> 00:06:45.667
BEFORE PEOPLE BUILT CITIES

00:06:45.667 --> 00:06:47.200
AND BRIDGES AND THINGS,

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:48.700
NATURAL ENVIRONMENT JUST MOVED,

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:53.266
BUT NOW WE'RE IN THE WAY.

00:06:53.266 --> 00:06:54.533
IF WE'RE GOING TO HAVE NATURAL

00:06:54.533 --> 00:06:56.200
ENVIRONMENTS LIKE FRINGE SWAMPS

00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:58.700
AND MARSHES AND LOWER FORESTS,

00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:00.467
WHERE ARE THEY GOING TO MOVE TO?

00:07:00.467 --> 00:07:01.133
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE

00:07:01.133 --> 00:07:02.667
TO PLAN THAT.

00:07:02.667 --> 00:07:03.567
AND THE THIRD BIG QUESTION IS

00:07:03.567 --> 00:07:04.567
WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO WITH THE

00:07:04.567 --> 00:07:07.567
STUFF WE LEAVE BEHIND?

00:07:10.233 --> 00:07:11.867
&gt;&gt; I UNDERSTAND IT'S DIFFICULT

00:07:11.867 --> 00:07:14.667
FOR PEOPLE TO PUT A LOT OF FAITH

00:07:14.667 --> 00:07:17.200
OR, TRUST IN THINGS THAT THEY

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:19.233
CAN'T PUT THEIR FINGER ON.

00:07:19.233 --> 00:07:22.033
&gt;&gt; TEMPERATURE IS 27.1...

00:07:22.033 --> 00:07:23.200
&gt;&gt; AND SO THAT'S WHY I OFTEN

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:24.934
FALL BACK TO THE ACTUAL

00:07:24.934 --> 00:07:28.033
MEASUREMENTS, DON'T EMPHASIZE

00:07:28.033 --> 00:07:30.133
THE COMPUTER MODELING OR THE

00:07:30.133 --> 00:07:32.500
PROJECTIONS OR THE THEORY,

00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:34.667
JUST LOOK AT THE FACTS THAT WE

00:07:34.667 --> 00:07:36.133
HAVE ACTUALLY OBSERVED TO

00:07:36.133 --> 00:07:37.867
HAVE OCCURRED OVER THE LAST

00:07:37.867 --> 00:07:41.433
100 YEARS AND IT'S OBVIOUS

00:07:41.433 --> 00:07:43.033
THAT WE NEED TO DO THINGS

00:07:43.033 --> 00:07:44.767
DIFFERENTLY DURING THE NEXT 100

00:07:44.767 --> 00:07:47.433
YEARS AND THAT TAKES PLANNING.
