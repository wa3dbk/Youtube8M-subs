Hi, I'm Kelli Ronci for Pottery Barn Kids.

00:00:12.859 --> 00:00:19.859
What could be more adorable than a baby's first birthday, 
inspired by Eric Carle's delightful children's book,

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:26.379
The Very Hungry Caterpillar? And what more appropriate 
party favor to create than these charming fruit bibs,

00:00:26.379 --> 00:00:30.379
inspired by the caterpillar-eaten fruit depicted in the book.

00:00:30.379 --> 00:00:34.100
They're super easy to make and require no sewing skills. 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:40.379
To make one, you'll need about a half yard of white fabric, 
a half yard of polka dot fabric, 

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:47.379
fabric scissors, pinking shears, an iron, some iron-on adhesive, 
iron-on fastener tap,

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:50.379
and this great iron-on vinyl coating.

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:54.379
To prepare, adjust your iron to a high setting, make sure the steam is off. 

00:00:54.379 --> 00:01:01.379
Start off with a piece of polka dot fabric, and a piece 
of iron-on adhesive, both measuring 11 by 14 inches.

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:07.379
Fuse the adhesive to the back of the fabric according to 
the manufacturer's instructions.

00:01:07.379 --> 00:01:11.379
Download and print the bib template at potterybarnkids.com.  

00:01:11.379 --> 00:01:18.379
Trace the outline onto the paper backing of the adhesive. 
Following the template, trace the border onto the paper backing,

00:01:18.379 --> 00:01:24.379
and then cut out the center. Try to keep this piece intact, 
and set aside.

00:01:24.379 --> 00:01:29.379
You'll need it later to create the fruit applique. Now, 
peel the backing away from the border.

00:01:29.379 --> 00:01:37.379
Lay the border on the white fabric, the adhesive side facing down, 
and then place the center piece inside to line things up.

00:01:37.379 --> 00:01:44.379
Remove the center piece, and fuse the border to the white fabric. 
Don't cut yet.  

00:01:44.379 --> 00:01:50.379
Next, trace the outline of your chosen fruit shape onto the 
paper backing side of the center piece.

00:01:50.379 --> 00:01:54.379
Cut out the fruit shape and peel away the paper backing.

00:01:54.379 --> 00:01:58.379
Center it inside the border and fuse it to the white fabric.

00:01:58.379 --> 00:02:02.379
Again, don't cut. There's still one more important step.

00:02:02.379 --> 00:02:08.379
Now lower your iron setting to medium, and trace the bib 
template onto the paper backing side of 

00:02:08.379 --> 00:02:12.379
the iron-on vinyl coating. Cut around the outside of the pattern,

00:02:12.379 --> 00:02:19.379
allowing about a half inch of extra room. For now, you want to hold 
off on cutting out the neck.

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:23.379
Now peel the paper backing away and center the vinyl piece over the bib.

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:27.379
Place the paper backing back over the vinyl, shiny side down,

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:34.379
and press and hold the iron for eight seconds. 
Repeat all over and then remove the paper.

00:02:34.379 --> 00:02:39.379
Turn the fabric over and press the back side for four seconds, all over.

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:45.379
Now cut through all fused layers. Use pinking shears around the 
outer edge for a more finished look,

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:49.379
but cut the neck hole out with regular fabric scissors.

00:02:49.379 --> 00:02:54.379
Finally, cut a one-inch piece of iron on velcro tape, 
rounding the edges,

00:02:54.379 --> 00:02:57.379
and fuse to the ends of the neck tabs.

00:02:57.379 --> 00:03:01.379
Use a pice of the paper backing as a buffer 
between the iron and the vinyl.

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:06.379
And there you have a great party favor bib that's sure to 
come in handy when the birthday cake arrives.

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:12.379
I hope your own little hungry caterpillar enjoys 
a magical first birthday.
