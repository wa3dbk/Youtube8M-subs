Joel Hickerson, grindog.com and today we are
going to learn how to draw exotic flowers.

00:00:06.459 --> 00:00:11.210
First thing we'll try is an orchid. It is
a little simpler than most. You have five

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:23.490
petals usually on these and they kind of have
their own shape. The thing about them is they

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:41.449
also have a stamen that comes out and kind
of steps out on its own, come back and delineate

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:50.030
each different petal. Remember there is five
of them and kind of have a crease in the center

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:59.780
and there are a million ways to simplify these
things and this is a little more detailed

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:11.680
than we probably need. These petals may have
leaves that come out to the side like that,

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:18.090
darken them up a little bit to distinguish
them from the flower and then another one

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:30.140
might be some little exotics and you can get
those by doing little starbursts and let's

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:43.710
find little stars there and you can bring
the petals down in the same location or their

00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:52.460
stems, excuse me, go on down here to the same
point and then you get that look. Then the

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:59.050
last one we will probably try is The Bird
of Paradise which has a stem that kind of

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:12.140
comes in from the side and it has a colored
part that actually comes up the middle and

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:26.560
actually comes a little farther and these
on the sides are actually leaves whereas these

00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:44.570
are the colored ones. Now look at what we
get from there. That's how you draw exotic

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:45.140
flowers.
