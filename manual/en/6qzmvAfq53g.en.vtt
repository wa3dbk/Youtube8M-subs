00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:13.053
There's one thing you should know about me.

00:00:14.011 --> 00:00:17.599
I specialize in a very specific type of security.

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:20.409
Subconcious security.

00:00:22.059 --> 00:00:23.234
You're talking about dreams?

00:00:31.042 --> 00:00:34.152
Mr. Cobb has a job offer
he would like to discuss with you.

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:35.747
You've got a work placement?

00:00:41.324 --> 00:00:42.198
Not exactly.

00:00:43.371 --> 00:00:45.132
We create the world of the dream.

00:00:48.392 --> 00:00:50.106
We bring the subject into that dream...

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:52.781
and they fill it with their secrets.

00:00:54.515 --> 00:00:55.765
Then you break in and steal it?

00:00:56.523 --> 00:00:59.078
Well, it's not strictly speaking illegal.

00:01:02.904 --> 00:01:04.211
It's called Inception.

00:01:08.341 --> 00:01:09.025
I'm ready.

00:01:15.493 --> 00:01:17.150
I think I found a way home.

00:01:18.515 --> 00:01:21.930
And this last job, that's how I get there.

00:01:25.782 --> 00:01:28.208
Dreams feel real while we're in them.

00:01:29.002 --> 00:01:32.593
It's only when we wake up that we
realize something was actually strange.

00:01:37.222 --> 00:01:39.504
This was your responsibility,
we are not prepared for this!

00:01:49.188 --> 00:01:50.310
The dream is collapsing.

00:01:55.168 --> 00:01:56.056
I have it under control.

00:02:07.605 --> 00:02:08.840
I'll hate to see out of control.

00:02:13.985 --> 00:02:16.206
You mustn't be afraid to dream a little bigger darling.
