00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:08.500
Hey guys Mike here and welcome to another
episode of Dragon Ball Plot Holes and Inconsistencies

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:12.651
a show where we talk about the plot holes
and inconsistencies in the Dragon Ball Z anime

00:00:12.651 --> 00:00:13.651
and manga.

00:00:13.651 --> 00:00:18.100
The inconsistency we're going to talk about
in this episode has to do with characters

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:20.570
when they die getting to keep their bodies.

00:00:20.570 --> 00:00:25.040
When Goku dies for the first time in the beginning
of Dragon Ball Z he meets with King Yemma

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:26.460
along side Kami.

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.849
At this point Goku is told that great heroes
who have spent their lives fighting for good

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:35.280
and who have fought to save their planets
are allowed to keep their bodies in the afterlife.

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.240
As we also see all others who go to the afterlife
come there as spirits.

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:43.290
They exist in an incorporeal form and they
cannot keep their bodies.

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:46.160
This is meant to apply either for heaven or
hell.

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:50.480
This was meant to make Goku seem special and
in fact we're even told that this was actually

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.020
a special case.

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:55.920
Now although Toriyama did go out of his way
to establish this rule in the manga there's

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.840
many cases during the series in which this
is contradicted.

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:04.360
So exactly how is this contradicted and where
does this inconsistency appear?

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:07.140
Well let's take a more detailed look at this
and find out.

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:11.690
Now as we know with Goku's death he was allowed
to go and train with King Kai on his planet

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:15.780
so that in one year he would be able to be
resurrected with the Dragon Balls and help

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.810
to fight off the Saiyan invasion.

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:21.720
Later as we found out after many of Goku's
friends died at the hands of the Saiyans and

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:26.920
Goku is on his way to Namek he is contacted
by King Kai to tell him that his friends have

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.039
made it to King Kai's planet and are now training
with him.

00:01:30.039 --> 00:01:33.569
This would all make sense because of that
fact that the Z Fighters were all students

00:01:33.569 --> 00:01:38.750
of Kami the God of the Earth and gave their
lives trying to save the planet from the evil

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:39.750
Saiyans.

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:44.439
However at this point an inconsistency is
created in how the rules work in the afterlife.

00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:48.479
The reason for this is because of the fact
that one of their members was not a Z Fighter

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:52.810
and was not training under Kami, nor did he
accomplish good deeds throughout the course

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:53.920
of his life.

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.310
This character training with King Kai would
be none other than Piccolo.

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:02.049
Now although we can contend that Piccolo did
sacrifice his life trying to save Gohan and

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:06.119
trying to save the Earth from the Saiyans,
up until this point in time Piccolo was not

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:10.709
a good guy by any stretch of the imagination
and the entire reason he was actually training

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:13.640
Gohan was for his own selfish purposes.

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.790
As Piccolo made sure to reiterate his plans
for world domination were still very much

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:18.790
in effect.

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:23.500
Piccolo in Dragon Ball was also responsible
for a number of terrible acts which he committed,

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:27.600
one of which was actually enslaving Kami the
God of the Earth, and up until the fight with

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:31.941
Raditz Piccolo was consumed with the idea
of surpassing and killing Goku so that he

00:02:31.941 --> 00:02:33.120
could take over the world.

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:37.850
And in fact he actually did do this when he
killed Raditz and he took much pleasure in

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:38.880
killing Goku.

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:43.080
And also if we actually take into account
the fact that Piccolo was a reincarnation

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:47.620
of King Piccolo and when he fought Goku in
the tournament he claimed to still be King

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:52.370
Piccolo, then it's very possible to also apply
the fact that King Piccolo was a genocidal

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:57.120
maniac that destroyed most of human civilization
and killed millions of people throughout the

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.630
course of his life.

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:02.790
So despite how Piccolo died it's kind of an
inconsistency that he was ever allowed to

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:06.320
keep his body or train with King Kai in the
first place.

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:10.240
But actually this isn't the first inconsistency
about a villain keeping their body in the

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:11.240
series.

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:15.760
As a matter of fact just after King Yemma
spoke to Goku, Goku asked him if his brother

00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:17.450
Raditz had stopped by.

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:21.740
King Yemma confirmed that he had come to the
check in station and King Yemma actually had

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:24.700
to subdue him in order to sentence him to
hell.

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:28.230
The inconsistencies in the series actually
get larger from here.

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:31.840
This is especially true if we take into account
the anime.

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.460
Another big example of the villains being
allowed to keep their bodies after they die

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:39.010
in the anime takes place during the fight
with Frieza.

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:43.100
At this point in the anime when the Z Fighters
are training with King Kai, King Kai enlists

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:45.850
a little but of help to help them along their
training.

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:50.400
The Z Fighters actually find that the recently
killed Ginyu Force has found themself on King

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:51.510
Kai's planet.

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:56.090
The Z Fighters quickly dispose of the Ginyu
Force, showing their great results under King

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:57.090
Kai's training.

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:01.150
Once they're defeated the Ginyu Force is kicked
off of King Kai's planet and sent down to

00:04:01.150 --> 00:04:02.370
hell, bodies and all.

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:06.440
However this doesn't mesh with the series
in that people who die who are evil are not

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:08.450
supposed to keep their bodies afterwards.

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:13.560
When we flash forward to the Cell Saga there's
yet again another inconsistency that pops

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:14.560
up.

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:18.940
After Goku bravely sacrifices himself to save
the Earth and kills King Kai and destroys

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:24.430
his world in the process, King Kai and Goku
appear on Snake Way as spirits, after Goku

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:28.870
takes notice he tells King Kai that Cell isn't
with them and wonders if that's weird.

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:33.180
King Kai then tells Goku that if Cell is not
with them he must still be alive.

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:37.110
As he says just like them Cell should've gone
to Snake Way when he died.

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:41.909
Of course this is another inconsistency considering
the fact that when Cell dies, even if he went

00:04:41.909 --> 00:04:45.449
to that same location he should no longer
have his body.

00:04:45.449 --> 00:04:50.060
Also after this the anime takes this to much
greater extents during the Other World Tournament

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:51.250
filler arc.

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:55.289
Instead of going to heaven, Goku arrives on
Grand Kai's planet to train.

00:04:55.289 --> 00:04:59.330
Once he gets there he finds out that Cell's
recent arrival to hell has started stirring

00:04:59.330 --> 00:05:03.599
up things and he and the other villains are
now trying to take over and cause a coup.

00:05:03.599 --> 00:05:08.150
Goku and Pikkon actually go down to Hell and
fight with Cell, Frieza, his father, and the

00:05:08.150 --> 00:05:09.150
Ginyu Force.

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:13.539
And they defeat them pretty easily, especially
with Pikkon taking out the heavy hitters.

00:05:13.539 --> 00:05:17.779
But even after they're defeated these villains
keep their bodies and thus this just becomes

00:05:17.779 --> 00:05:21.449
another inconsistency that the anime contributes
to.

00:05:21.449 --> 00:05:24.979
Later on in the Buu arc this only seems to
get worse as well.

00:05:24.979 --> 00:05:29.180
The first big example of this would have to
be when Goku returns from the Earth and appears

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:30.730
before King Yemma.

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:35.070
Goku asks King Yemma if Gohan has come through
there yet since Goku still believes Gohan

00:05:35.070 --> 00:05:36.070
to be dead.

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:40.280
King Yemma responds that he hasn't yet but
then goes on to start talking about Dabura.

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:44.010
He talks about how he realized that Dabura
was a really strong guy and came through there

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:45.199
causing trouble.

00:05:45.199 --> 00:05:49.560
King Yemma knowing that he was the king of
the Demon World sent Dabura to Heaven instead

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:52.560
of Hell because he said that Dabura would
have loved Hell.

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:56.710
Now although it's only shown happening in
the anime this still implies that Dabura had

00:05:56.710 --> 00:06:00.860
his body when he came through there, and if
he went to heaven it's likely that he got

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:01.860
to keep it.

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:05.919
This is actually only one of the strange decisions
that King Yemma makes in this saga.

00:06:05.919 --> 00:06:10.210
Later on after the death of Vegeta we actually
find out that King Yemma preserved his body

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:15.380
as a backup plan to have someone to go after
Buu to prevent him from destroying the universe.

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:20.189
So although when Vegeta sacrifices his life
in a failed effort to try and defeat Buu and

00:06:20.189 --> 00:06:24.819
Piccolo specifically tells him that he'll
go to hell, lose his body, and have his soul

00:06:24.819 --> 00:06:30.400
purified, King Yemma actually saves Vegeta's
body which Vegeta ends up getting back, and

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:31.569
revived later on.

00:06:31.569 --> 00:06:36.409
And of course the final and most glaring inconsistency
in the series would definitely have to be

00:06:36.409 --> 00:06:39.309
during the fight between Goku and Kid Buu.

00:06:39.309 --> 00:06:43.410
As during this fight we see all of the villains
that Goku and his defeated over the course

00:06:43.410 --> 00:06:48.789
of Dragon Ball Z all watching him fight Kid
Buu from hell, and even the most recently

00:06:48.789 --> 00:06:53.830
killed Babidi shows up to help cheer on Goku
and hope that he defeats Buu for killing him.

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:58.330
Although many people and likely Toei saw this
as a good way to sum up the series by letting

00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:02.809
them all watch Goku's final fight with the
final antagonist, this also really helped

00:07:02.809 --> 00:07:06.610
to sum up and epitomize this inconsistency
in a nutshell.

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:11.580
Overall I can't exactly think of any particular
reason why this rule changed so often throughput

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:16.659
the series, aside from general inconsistency
in how Toriyama himself writes.

00:07:16.659 --> 00:07:20.309
Just as many other rules change throughout
the series, this is no different, and it's

00:07:20.309 --> 00:07:24.180
likely that it continued to change over and
over as the plot dictated.

00:07:24.180 --> 00:07:30.110
Well my name is Mike and this has been another
episode of Dragon Ball Plot Holes and Inconsistencies.
