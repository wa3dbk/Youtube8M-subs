00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:06.210
We are asked what is 10 to
the fifth power equivalent to.

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:11.190
Well, 10 to the fifth power is
the same thing as taking a 1

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.860
and multiplying it
by 10 five times.

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:15.180
So let's do that.

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:19.600
So that's three, four, and five.

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:22.420
So it's 1 times 10 times 10
times 10 times 10 times 10.

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:25.360
Notice one, two,
three, four, five.

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:26.730
And what's this going to be?

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:28.670
Well, 1 times 10 is 10.

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:31.081
10 times 10 is 100.

00:00:31.081 --> 00:00:33.800
100 times 10 is 1,000.

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.070
1,000 times 10 is 10,000.

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:39.450
10,000 times 10 is 100,000.

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:45.060
So this is going to be 100,000.

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:48.370
Now, you might have noticed,
every time we multiply it

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:51.630
by 10, we're adding
another 0 to the product.

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:54.930
So if we're multiplying
by 10 five times,

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.920
we're going to add five
0's to the product.

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:07.760
So this is literally going to
be 1 followed by five 0's, one,

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:09.360
two, three, four, five.

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:12.900
So 10 to the fifth is the
same thing as 100,000.

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:16.300
Let's do another one that
is on a similar topic.

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:20.460
How many 0's does the product
67 times 10 to the fifth have?

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:22.850
Well, there's a bunch of
ways of thinking about that.

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:29.430
67 times 10 to the fifth
is the exact same thing,

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:33.805
this is equivalent to-- you
could view this as 67 times.

00:01:33.805 --> 00:01:36.130
And we could use
the same exact logic

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:37.900
that we just saw in
the previous problem.

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:45.620
So 67 times 1 times 10 times
10 times 10 times 10 times 10.

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:47.680
And we already figured
out exactly what this is.

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:51.050
If you have 1 multiplied
by 10 five times,

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:54.720
this right over here is going
to be 1 followed by five 0's.

00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:57.710
One, two, three, four, five.

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:00.309
Or it's going to be 100,000.

00:02:00.309 --> 00:02:02.100
So there's a couple
ways to think about it.

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:04.391
If you're looking at just
this product right over here,

00:02:04.391 --> 00:02:07.126
you could say, well, 67 times
1 is just going to be 67.

00:02:07.126 --> 00:02:08.750
And then every time
you multiply by 10,

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:10.000
you're going to add another 0.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.860
So you could say, well,
this is just going to be 67.

00:02:12.860 --> 00:02:15.800
And we're going to be
multiplying by 10 five times,

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:17.440
so we're going to
add five 0's here.

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:20.440
One, two, three, four, five.

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:24.487
And so this would
come to 6,700,000.

00:02:24.487 --> 00:02:26.070
Another way you could
think about it--

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:28.830
this is the same thing
as 67 times 100,000,

00:02:28.830 --> 00:02:32.660
so it's going to be 67, and
then we have five 0's here.

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.300
So once again, one,
two, three, four, five.

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:37.840
You get the exact same value.

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.670
Let's do another one.

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:44.400
How many 0's does the
quotient 5,700,000 divided

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:48.020
by 10 to the third power have?

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:50.550
Well, 10 to the third
power we already know.

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:53.130
10 to the third power-- that's
the same thing as 1 times

00:02:53.130 --> 00:03:00.140
10 times 10 times 10, which
is the same thing as 1,000.

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:02.894
And so if we're dividing by
that, that's the same thing.

00:03:02.894 --> 00:03:05.310
So another way of writing this
expression right over here.

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:12.740
So 5,700,000 divided
by 10 to the third

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:16.720
is the same thing as--
I could write this way.

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:24.421
5,700,000 divided by
10 times 10 times 10.

00:03:24.421 --> 00:03:26.420
We could put a 1 out here,
but this won't really

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:32.925
change the value, which is
equivalent to 5,700,000 divided

00:03:32.925 --> 00:03:35.634
by 1,000.

00:03:35.634 --> 00:03:37.050
And either way you
think about it,

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:40.350
every time you divide by 10,
you're going to eliminate one

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:41.850
of these 0's.

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:44.130
So if you divide
by 10 three times--

00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:46.897
so if you divide by 10 once,
you're going to eliminate a 0.

00:03:46.897 --> 00:03:49.230
Divide by 10 again, you're
going to eliminate another 0.

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:51.780
Divide by 10 again, you're
going to eliminate another 0.

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:55.350
You're going to be
left with 5,700.

00:03:55.350 --> 00:03:57.210
Another way of thinking
about it is, well,

00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:00.440
if I'm dividing by something
that has three 0's, I'm going

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:01.530
to eliminate three 0's.

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:08.122
So if I eliminate three
0's, I am left with 5,700.

00:04:08.122 --> 00:04:09.580
Now, just to be
clear, I could only

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:11.170
do this because this was 1,000.

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:13.090
If this was like
3,000 or something,

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:16.680
I could think of this
as 3 times 1,000.

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:19.860
And then I could only cancel
out the 1,000 with these 0's.

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:22.600
But the 3 I would then
have to divide separately.

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:25.570
But only because I'm straight
up dividing by 1,000.

00:04:25.570 --> 00:04:27.890
I'm dividing by a power of 10.

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:29.500
I have three 0's here.

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:32.120
I can cancel it out
with three 0's there.

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:33.980
Let's do another one.

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:35.890
So it asks you to do a few.

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:37.470
And these are the
type of questions

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:39.350
that you might see
in the exercise.

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:42.780
When 72.1 is multiplied
by 10 to the third,

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:46.410
the decimal point moves
blank places to the blank.

00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:49.280
And in the exercise, you
might see a dropdown here.

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:52.480
So remember, if you're
multiplying by--

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:54.837
and this is essentially
10 to the third,

00:04:54.837 --> 00:04:56.420
so you're multiplying
by 1,000, you're

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:57.830
going to get a larger number.

00:04:57.830 --> 00:05:00.550
You're not going to
get a smaller number.

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:02.770
And so every time
you multiply by 10,

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:05.070
your decimal point is
going to move to the right

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:06.490
because you're getting larger.

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:08.340
So we're going to move
the decimal point.

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:12.877
So 72.1, if we
multiplied it by 10 once,

00:05:12.877 --> 00:05:14.835
then we would move the
decimal point over once.

00:05:14.835 --> 00:05:17.820
And we'd get 721,
which makes sense.

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:20.170
72 times 10 is 720.

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:22.810
72.1 times 10 should be 721.

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:25.094
But if we want to multiply
it by 10 three times,

00:05:25.094 --> 00:05:27.010
we're going to move the
decimal place over not

00:05:27.010 --> 00:05:30.222
just once, but twice,
and three times.

00:05:30.222 --> 00:05:31.180
And you say wait, wait.

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:31.870
How could I move it over?

00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:32.745
There's nothing here.

00:05:32.745 --> 00:05:33.997
Well, you throw a 0 in there.

00:05:33.997 --> 00:05:35.580
And so you're going
to get, it's going

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:39.757
to be equal to-- so it's
going to be equal to 72,100.

00:05:39.757 --> 00:05:41.090
Now, they're not asking us that.

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:42.850
They're just asking
how we would do it.

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:45.860
And we saw the decimal
point moves three places

00:05:45.860 --> 00:05:47.220
to the right.

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:48.720
And the big key
here is you're going

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:51.600
to get a larger number when
you multiply by 10 three times,

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:54.090
or multiply by 1,000.

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:54.995
Let's do this one.

00:05:54.995 --> 00:05:57.470
When 56 is divided
by 10 to the third,

00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:00.860
the decimal point moves
blank places to the blank.

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:02.590
Well, dividing by
10 to the third

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:05.659
is the same thing as
dividing by 10 three times.

00:06:05.659 --> 00:06:07.200
And every time you
divide by 10, it's

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:08.574
going to become
a smaller number.

00:06:08.574 --> 00:06:11.520
So 56, and you might say,
where is the decimal point?

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:13.940
Well, there's implicitly a
decimal point right over there.

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:16.520
You divide by 10 once, you're
going to get a smaller number.

00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:18.610
56 is going to become
5 and something,

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:21.310
so it's going to
become literally 5.6.

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:24.820
Divide by 10 again, it's
going to become 0.56.

00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:26.630
Divide by 10 again,
you're like, wait.

00:06:26.630 --> 00:06:29.762
If I keep moving the decimal
place again to the left,

00:06:29.762 --> 00:06:31.220
what am I moving
it to the left of?

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:33.300
Well, you could throw
a 0 right over here.

00:06:33.300 --> 00:06:38.890
And so if you move the decimal
point three places to the left,

00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:41.990
you are left with 0.056.

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:45.030
And you might want to put a
0 out here just for clarity.

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:50.140
But what we did here is we moved
the decimal point three places

00:06:50.140 --> 00:06:52.750
to the left in this situation.

00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:55.360
We got a smaller value.
