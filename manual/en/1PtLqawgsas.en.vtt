00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.620
hello internet I'm Dan and as inspired
by amazingphil today i am going to give

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.830
you a tour of my brain

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.389
I bought this weird x-ray thing off ebay
not quite sure how it works i'll just line

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:13.620
myself up with

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.060
okay here we are

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:23.130
Wow human brains are gross anyway let's
look around what have we got here

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:27.510
ah my social skills receptor

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.710
yeah as you can see the cord connecting
this to motor neurons and speech center

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:33.930
is somewhat damaged

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.980
it's always been like this here's the
daydream department this section is

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.800
responsible for all the background
thoughts that end up drifting to the

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.300
front of my consciousness

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.059
I also think this may be where the
missing synapses from the social

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:48.809
skills receptor ended up which would
explain my little talking to myself

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:52.440
problem here we have the area that used
to control my healthy reactions to

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.699
shocking and disturbing images but as
you can see it's more or less completely

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:57.899
shriveled and dead

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:01.260
I believe that coincided around the time
I started going on the internet over

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.550
here

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.939
oh its my aesthetic  pretty cool

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.760
yup spent a while completing that and
what's this are the distraction center

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.360
this contains all of the things I
convinced myself are more important than

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:21.000
my responsibilities like eating and
checking emails and unnecessarily long

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.650
toilet breaks of my phone

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:25.830
sometimes however even these things
aren't powerful enough to control me and

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:28.409
the signals end up going all the way up
to here

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:33.210
the escapism hatch a land of fantasy
filled with fictional universes to get

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:36.230
lost in and live through vicariously

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:39.260
oh I wish I could spend my whole life up
here

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:43.100
I'm doing it again i'm
doing it again yeah if I ever end up

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:46.040
there it's too late the day is just a
complete write-off

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:51.080
what about oh the envy lobe yeah I tend
not to go in here that often due to the

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.800
giant green monster that lives there he's
kind of a dick to be honest not very

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:55.730
helpful

00:01:55.730 --> 00:02:00.290
trying to get evicted this here is the
constant rhythm generator I literally

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:04.730
always have a song in my head and if I'm
not badly singing or whistling it i'll be

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:06.320
tapping it on a table

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.380
people literally used to sit away from
me in school because they find my

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:13.730
tapping so annoying now this is my
center for logic and rationality of the

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:17.930
core of my brain that regulates my
belief in impartiality and fair discussion

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:22.250
or as my parents like to call it being
an annoying smart ass

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:26.030
and here we have oh the opinion cortex

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:29.000
yeah when I see something that makes me
want to voice an opinion instead of

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.290
expressing it

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:34.730
they just build up here I've been
harboring a lot of anger towards some of

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:38.150
the ignorance in the world so it's a
pretty bad shape after being repressed

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:39.230
for so long

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.080
the other week it was shaking pretty
badly like it was going to explode so

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:47.360
I'm letting bits out slowly and this is
the corridor fear

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.080
yep the usual suspects in this thing
this one isn't really an issue until the

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:54.230
sun goes down at which point it usually
opens it makes me freak out

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:58.459
great and here is the cave of regrets

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:02.270
I kind of bleak monument to all the
things I wish I were and did you know

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:07.040
general unfulfilled dreams and new years
resolutions from four years ago I try

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:07.940
not to think about it

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:14.360
ok what else we got what else we got a
oh all that that is the existential

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:15.800
crisis pit

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:20.120
there it is a gaping black abyss that
swallows me into a spiral of despair

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.840
questioning whether anything has any
meaning or if our lives are relevant at

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:24.840
all

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:28.290
look at it look at that darkness

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:33.870
whoa yeah we should be careful around
this thing trust me if you fall into

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:36.450
that you ain't coming out for a while

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:41.250
it's been growing somewhat alarmingly
over the last few years but I'm working

00:03:41.250 --> 00:03:46.410
on it and I guess that is my brain

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:51.360
yeah what goes on in my head all the
time

00:03:52.349 --> 00:03:56.010
well that was fun why did I want to do
that again

00:03:56.010 --> 00:04:01.349
oh yeah and one last thing it's there
sexy end screen zone

00:04:01.349 --> 00:04:04.980

00:04:04.980 --> 00:04:08.430
subscribe to Dan's channel to see more
of his videos that you can click here

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:13.049
also why not check out his new gaming
channel or merch shop with amazingphil

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:16.799
which I bet you haven't heard of before
because it's not like Dan talks about

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:22.019
it all the time, so its a bit annoying to be
honest isn't it like we get it Dan

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:24.630
you're excited about them but that
doesn't mean that you need to talk about

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:28.050
it literally all the time ok that's
enough of that

00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:32.669
i wonder what the return policy is on this
x-ray thing
