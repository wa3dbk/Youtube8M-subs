00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:09.040
Francesco: A lot of guys... well actually,
body shaving. People use scissors, old blades,

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:14.620
and that meant blood, cuts, pain. When you
have to perform a task, you need the right

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:15.620
tools for that.

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:21.750
Dario: Our task was to reach out to as many
guys as possible to let them know that Gillette

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:25.380
had developed a new razor specifically for
the body.

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.770
Francesco: Guys don't necessarily naturally
talk to each other about body shaving, but

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:34.160
when you actually engage them about the discussion,
they have a lot to say, especially those who

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:35.160
do it.

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:39.040
Dario: So we thought that a medium like YouTube
could help us trigger that discussion. We

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:44.440
knew we had to talk to 18 to 35 year old males,
and you can get a pretty amazing reach very

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:50.469
quickly. You can target all devices. You can
have a pretty low cost-per-view and really

00:00:50.469 --> 00:00:58.030
high engagement rate.

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:09.150
Francesco: We all like to talk about impressions
and engagement and likes and all this kind

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:14.719
of stuff. The reality is, we're measured based
on how much of our products sell. We got half

00:01:14.719 --> 00:01:21.340
a million clicks to buy now. This is amazing.
The body razor was the number one razor sold

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.990
on Amazon in the first three months of this
launch.

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:29.320
A year after the launch, today, the body razor
is the number two sold razor on Amazon.

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:34.340
Dario: We did host the Gillette body video
on the global Gillette channel. That way we

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:38.730
were able to track and measure all the metrics
at the same time.

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:44.759
Francesco: You can actually pull the levers
and adjust it a lot faster than if you had

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:47.119
to spread the resources across different countries.

00:01:47.119 --> 00:01:51.380
Dario: One of the great things that we did
was real-time optimization. Breaking down

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:55.700
the age group and optimizing against the best
performing ones.

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:00.820
Francesco: P &amp; G has always been at the edge
of how to engage consumers with this content.

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:05.640
We're moving away from "Let's use digital
as a gap filler," and actually start with

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.990
digital first. Most importantly, with mobile
first.

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:14.800
Gillette body is one launch, we expect to
do a ton of other launches in the future and

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:23.660
we expect the digital space to play a bigger
role.
