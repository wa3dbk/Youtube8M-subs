00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.780
The objective of this adventure was to summit Island Peak in the Everest Region of Nepal.

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:26.400
The jump off point at Lukla Village

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:10.640
But before I could climb, some schooling was necessary.

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:33.380
This may look really difficult, but in reality, it’s really difficult.

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:54.740
It’s 7 pm. We’re at Island Peak base camp.

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:57.960
We start the following morning at 1 am.

00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:59.200
As did many others.

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:13.660
We’re about 5,900m here

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:20.560
And have to go another 300m up snow and ice to the summit.

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.580
The number of climbers dropped in time,

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:31.340
But it was still quite crowded

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.920
Things really stacked up just below the summit.

00:02:50.940 --> 00:02:54.220
The summit only counts if you make it back safely.

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:55.400
So back we went.
