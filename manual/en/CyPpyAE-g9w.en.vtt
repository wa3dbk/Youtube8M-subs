00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:04.190
Feantugeiha here bringing you record Nasus stacks.

00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:09.730
These are the runes and masteries that I take.

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:13.680
I farm up for the first 40 minutes or so
then move to farm in front of the enemy nexus

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:19.700
while Thresh does the same. I've picked twisted tree line because it spawns 26 minions per minute.

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:23.789
Theoretically with 40% cooldown reduction Nasus can use siphoning strike

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:26.970
25 times a minute. But because of the attack animation

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:30.369
it's more like 20. This means he has to kill six minions

00:00:30.369 --> 00:00:33.559
a minutes with basic attacks which is why I've taken this crazy build.

00:00:33.559 --> 00:00:40.559
Six hours in and the minions are starting to do quite a bit of damage.

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:43.880
After seven hours it's getting harder to
kill the extra 6 minions a minute.

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:46.930
Just over eight hours

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:50.770
and I've broken the previous record for a
standard game mode of 30,000

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:57.770
all that is left to do is chase down the URF record of 34,600

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:02.320
Nine hours and my luck runs out.

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:09.320
Approaching 34,000 I lag and die in a
matter of seconds.

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:12.030
Whilst all this is taking place

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:15.320
Thresh looks on wondering what's so
difficult about killing a few minions.

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:20.640
All is not lost though

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:26.510
as Thresh recalls allowing me to farm a bit longer. We quickly realise Runnan's is

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:29.810
a pretty dangerous item.

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:34.200
My attempt at revenge highlights who is top dog between these two;

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:39.590
over 34,000 stacks reduced to just
fifteen hundred damage by his ridiculous armor.

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:43.030
Sadly  at nine hours 10 minutes

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:46.880
the server crashed kicking both of us
from the game. The URF record will have to

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:47.850
wait for another day.

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:51.070
My final stack count 34,296

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:56.880
The minions then have a base race with purple team just winning.

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.930
After a nine-hour game and the score at an impressive

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:02.950
one to nothing, it seems only fitting that Thresh wins.

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:06.890
Check out the description below for the
final stats of the game.

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:12.090
