00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.330
Hi I'm Tricia an organic gardener I grow
organically,

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:08.380
for a healthy and safe food supply. For
a clean and sustainable environment.

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:14.559
For an enjoyable and rewarding
experience.

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:16.029
Avocados are delicious

00:00:16.029 --> 00:00:19.689
and nutritious subtropical or tropical
fruit

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:23.630
but if you live in a warm weather or
mild winter climate

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:28.029
you can grow your own avocados. Choose
the right location for your avocado tree

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:31.950
you need full sun, south or southwesterly
exposure,

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:36.440
little wind and well-drained soil, and
make sure you plant at least

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:40.640
eight to ten feet away from any structure.
Prior to planting

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:44.710
its recommend that you do a soil test
and if you only do one test make it a pH

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:45.340
test

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:49.590
because avocados don't do well in any pH
that's higher than seven.

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.070
Check out our how-to video on How to Do
a Soil Test.

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.560
You can lower the pH with a soil sulfur like this one from

00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:59.920
E.B. Stone and do it before you plant
the tree because

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.290
lowering the pH is going to be difficult
after the tree is planted.

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:06.930
Avocado trees grow to be 25 to 30 feet
tall

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.460
if left unpruned. It's relatively easy
for the home gardener

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.060
to keep the tree smaller. A smaller trees
especially important

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.990
if you may have to protect the tree from
frost occasionally throughout the year.

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:23.020
For a complete guide to frost protection
check out our How to Protect Plants from

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:24.219
Frost video.

00:01:24.219 --> 00:01:28.369
Avocados produce what we call perfect
flowers.

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:33.399
They're both male and female but on
different days and at different times.

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:37.469
Avocados are divided into a and b-type
flowers.

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:40.549
A-type flowers are female in the morning

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:44.819
the first day and male in the afternoon
of the second day.

00:01:44.819 --> 00:01:48.219
B-type flowers are male in the morning

00:01:48.219 --> 00:01:52.259
of the first day and female in the
afternoon of the second day.

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:57.619
Some self pollination occurs but you'll get
the most fruit by planting one

00:01:57.619 --> 00:02:01.039
of each flower type. Today I'm gonna be
planting

00:02:01.039 --> 00:02:05.929
a Mexicola and a Zutano and they
need to be planted about 20 to 30 feet

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:06.499
apart.

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:11.360
Dig your hole the same depth as the root
ball and about the same width as the pot

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:14.610
Avocados have a very sensitive root
system

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:18.250
to avoid disturbing the roots carefully
cut away the container

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.130
and then ease the plant into the hole do
not drop it in the hole

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:26.780
back fill the hole carefully and water
your newly planted avocado.

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:31.150
Small trees might need five to twenty
gallons a couple times a week

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:34.970
and larger trees may be able to go
a week or longer between watering.

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:38.600
Don't allow them to stand in water
longer than a few hours.

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.890
Allow the soil to dry a little bit
between waterings.

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:45.410
To test the dryness of the soil just do
the squeeze test.

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:48.480
Take a handful of soil and squeeze it, if
it stays together

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:53.590
don't water. Avocados are shallow rooted
so they really benefit from mulch,

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:57.480
the best mulch is the trees own leaves
when they fall

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:00.550
but until the tree gets big enough to do
that

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:05.190
I'm gonna put a little bit of weed mat
around the base of the tree to act as a

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:05.780
mulch.

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:10.240
Grafted avocados like this tree will
fruit after two years.

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:15.210
Avocados grown from seed take eight to
ten years to bear fruit. It's important

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:16.130
to protect

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:19.560
the truck from sun burn. Sun burn will
damage the trunk

00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:22.760
and then will expose the tree to pests
and diseases.

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:26.910
A white tree guard like this is perfect for
newly planted trees

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:32.060
since it also protects from rodent damage,
alternatively you can paint the trunks

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:33.400
with a 50/50 mix

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:37.960
of white interior latex paint and water. To
maintain your tree size

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:42.330
pitching back the growing tips is a
better way to maintain size than heavy

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:42.950
pruning.

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:47.860
Fertilization is key for avocado trees.
Fertilize monthly with a citrus, fruit

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:49.560
tree, or avocado fertilizer

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:53.990
like this one from E.B. Stone and
trees that are fertilized are much more

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:55.040
cold hardy

00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:00.600
than they're non-fertilized counterparts.
Avocados don't ripen on the trees and

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:03.200
it can be hard to know when to harvest

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:06.360
you have to know the variety of avocado
tree that you have

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:10.790
and know when it ripens. Pick a couple of the fruit and let them ripen

00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:16.449
at 70 to 65 degrees fahrenheit if they
soften in two weeks you're fruit is ripe

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:20.030
if the fruit doesn't ripen pick
some more and try again.

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:24.300
This Clip-N- Pic pole picker is a
great tool to harvest avocados that are

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:27.199
on a big tree like this one.

00:04:27.199 --> 00:04:31.460
It has razor blades to cut the fruit
from the tree and a mesh bag to keep it

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:33.300
from getting bruised.

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:37.969
Avocados hold well on the tree so they
can be picked over a period of time

00:04:37.969 --> 00:04:41.580
So grow an avocado tree and grow organic
for life!

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:48.580
 

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:50.470
