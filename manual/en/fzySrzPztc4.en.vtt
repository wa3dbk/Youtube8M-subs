00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.130
Hi everyone.

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:13.639
So today we're taking a look at
Microsoft's game

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:16.690
DVR footage. So the way this works is at 
any time

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:20.490
you can say 'Xbox record that' and the Xbox One

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.150
will grab the last 30 seconds of game
play and it will make that available to you.

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:30.670
Now likewise developers can build their
games around game DVR so that

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:34.610
when particular moments happen like you
level up in Battlefield

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:37.760
you basically start a recording of

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.780
the last 30 seconds, meaning you capture
whatever it is that caused you to level up.

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:42.110
 

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:46.520
It's quite a cool feature but that's
really where the coolness kind of ends with

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:47.379
this technology.

00:00:47.379 --> 00:00:51.040
Unfortunately the resulting video footage
is only 720p

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:55.360
and the quality is not particularly
great. It's obviously been designed for

00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:59.260
very low file sizes, very small file sizes.

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:02.350
The resulting files can be exported to
SkyDrive

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:06.420
Microsoft's Dropbox style service but
unfortunately

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.359
nowhere else. If you want to upload your
footage to YouTube, or share with your

00:01:10.359 --> 00:01:11.819
friends on Facebook for instance, or

00:01:11.819 --> 00:01:15.270
Google+, you're going to have to download
the footage from SkyDrive

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.749
then upload it somewhere else and
unfortunately in our tests we found that

00:01:19.749 --> 00:01:24.209
SkyDrive footage was around 70meg,
yet it took around five minutes to

00:01:24.209 --> 00:01:24.999
download

00:01:24.999 --> 00:01:29.380
to our Windows 8.1 PC which is just
unacceptable for

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:32.749
a cloud storage locker which is effectively what SkyDrive is.

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:36.539
We would certainly expect Microsoft to be
providing a lot more bandwidth

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:40.479
for their flagship storage system. Overall

00:01:40.479 --> 00:01:43.689
it's a great idea but is badly let down by

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:47.459
only recording the last 30 seconds. You
can set it to start recording five

00:01:47.459 --> 00:01:48.909
minutes of footage while you play

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:52.489
but five minutes is not an awful lot of
footage when you actually think about it

00:01:52.489 --> 00:01:53.520
certainly not in

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:58.649
a 45-minute long game of Battlefield. It would
have been much better if Microsoft had

00:01:58.649 --> 00:01:59.049
launched with

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:02.539
twitch.tv support putting them on parity
with the PlayStation 4

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:06.840
and a lot of these issues simply would have
disappeared overnight. Instead Microsoft being

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:07.559
Microsoft

00:02:07.559 --> 00:02:11.280
had to shoehorn in their SkyDrive functionality

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:15.069
and unfortunately it is to the detriment of 
the overall experience of recording

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:20.409
and sharing your gameplay moments.

00:02:20.409 --> 00:02:24.370
 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:26.200
