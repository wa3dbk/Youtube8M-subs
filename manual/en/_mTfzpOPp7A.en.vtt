00:00:08.646 --> 00:00:12.636
&gt;&gt;Student: Well, in one of our
classes, we had a test that me

00:00:12.636 --> 00:00:15.506
and Jason took, and then
when we got it back,

00:00:15.926 --> 00:00:18.846
our grades were different although
our answers were pretty much alike.

00:00:19.616 --> 00:00:22.056
&gt;&gt;Narrator: These freshmen
at Moanalua High School

00:00:22.056 --> 00:00:24.176
in Honolulu are taping a documentary

00:00:24.176 --> 00:00:26.046
about their teachers'
grading policies.

00:00:26.496 --> 00:00:27.226
&gt;&gt;Student: Well, I was pretty mad,

00:00:27.506 --> 00:00:31.036
because mine was marked
down lower and--

00:00:31.126 --> 00:00:33.466
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The project is
part of a unique program

00:00:33.466 --> 00:00:37.876
that combines the study of English,
social studies and multimedia.

00:00:38.026 --> 00:00:42.016
&gt;&gt;Lynne: They were applying
understandings that had come from

00:00:42.046 --> 00:00:44.336
"To Kill a Mockingbird,"
that had come from civics,

00:00:44.466 --> 00:00:49.496
and the strong emotional reaction to
"Of Mice and Men," trying to think

00:00:49.496 --> 00:00:53.656
about in their own world
instances of justice and injustice.

00:00:53.946 --> 00:00:58.896
And the whole goal of this is to seek
truth through the video journalism,

00:00:59.246 --> 00:01:00.296
and then achieve justice.

00:01:01.086 --> 00:01:04.466
&gt;&gt;Student: What is your experience
like working with the ESL students?

00:01:04.766 --> 00:01:06.636
&gt;&gt;Woman: I was once an ESL student,

00:01:06.876 --> 00:01:10.026
so I know exactly what my students
are going through right now.

00:01:10.476 --> 00:01:13.276
&gt;&gt;Student: The reason my group
chose to do this project was

00:01:13.406 --> 00:01:15.916
because this subject
really hits close to home.

00:01:16.156 --> 00:01:19.746
Everybody in Hawaii has
an immigrant background.

00:01:20.736 --> 00:01:24.496
We all came from somewhere
else, but unfortunately,

00:01:25.646 --> 00:01:29.046
even if we all are
immigrants in a sense,

00:01:29.226 --> 00:01:31.336
we still discriminate against others.

00:01:31.336 --> 00:01:32.626
&gt;&gt;Dan: Same thing,
you guys, same thing.

00:01:32.626 --> 00:01:36.306
Good, good energy, just keep
the energy up, don't let it dip.

00:01:36.306 --> 00:01:39.436
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The concept of
integrating language, social science

00:01:39.436 --> 00:01:41.976
and media studies grew
out of an experiment--

00:01:42.276 --> 00:01:44.276
[shouting]

00:01:44.536 --> 00:01:46.926
&gt;&gt;Narrator: By drama
teacher Dan Hale.

00:01:47.136 --> 00:01:49.246
&gt;&gt;Dan: Okay, good, good, good.

00:01:49.246 --> 00:01:53.316
&gt;&gt;I had students that basically,
you know, were unmotivated,

00:01:53.316 --> 00:01:56.766
sat on their hands, and all a
sudden, I assign this video project,

00:01:57.266 --> 00:02:00.476
and all of a sudden, I have a
different student in my class.

00:02:00.696 --> 00:02:03.046
You know, they're motivated,
they're spending hours

00:02:03.046 --> 00:02:06.686
after that asking me provoking
questions and I'm going,

00:02:07.016 --> 00:02:09.056
"Wait a minute, you know,
there's something to this."

00:02:09.766 --> 00:02:12.216
And so that's when things
started falling in place.

00:02:12.216 --> 00:02:13.996
We started saying,
"Well, how can we kind

00:02:13.996 --> 00:02:17.046
of duplicate this on a larger scale?"

00:02:17.476 --> 00:02:19.746
&gt;&gt;Student: You'll fill and
I'll do the narrative at home.

00:02:21.306 --> 00:02:23.436
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Today, fifty-five
students are involved

00:02:23.436 --> 00:02:25.676
in Moanalua's media, communications

00:02:25.676 --> 00:02:28.166
and technology integrated
studies program.

00:02:28.766 --> 00:02:30.946
&gt;&gt;It just works really well,
because it forces the students

00:02:31.046 --> 00:02:33.426
to take the material,
take their resources,

00:02:33.616 --> 00:02:38.446
take the data that they learn, and
transform it into another medium,

00:02:38.446 --> 00:02:40.766
in the case of video
production or in the case of say,

00:02:40.816 --> 00:02:42.946
putting an oral history
onto a website.

00:02:43.136 --> 00:02:46.146
They really make it in a way,
they construct new knowledge.

00:02:46.226 --> 00:02:48.066
They make it their own
when they have to do that.

00:02:48.406 --> 00:02:51.056
&gt;&gt;Bao: In our social studies,
we did our oral history project,

00:02:51.696 --> 00:02:54.286
and we researched about
our ancestors,

00:02:54.556 --> 00:02:59.066
who are the first immigrants
that came to Hawaii,

00:02:59.626 --> 00:03:00.586
and which was my grandma.

00:03:00.716 --> 00:03:02.816
And we had to study about
their American dreams,

00:03:02.906 --> 00:03:06.086
their country of origin and
like how they got through it.

00:03:06.286 --> 00:03:10.846
With all three classes, it gives us a
variety of learning styles and we get

00:03:10.966 --> 00:03:13.866
to experience each of the
different classes through media.

00:03:14.996 --> 00:03:16.546
&gt;&gt;Narrator: In his first
year in the program,

00:03:16.766 --> 00:03:20.776
Bao Lei has already produced an award
winning state history project video,

00:03:21.226 --> 00:03:24.116
two shorts for a cable show for
the department of education,

00:03:24.116 --> 00:03:32.796
and a video self portrait,
illustrating the concept of metaphor.

00:03:32.856 --> 00:03:36.136
&gt;&gt;Bao: Most people say that
Bao is a wild and crazy kid.

00:03:36.506 --> 00:03:40.526
&gt;&gt;I was related to a jack
in the box because of

00:03:40.526 --> 00:03:45.126
like how I'm usually upbeat
and like to have fun and stuff.

00:03:45.466 --> 00:03:48.616
&gt;&gt;Bao is the one who's always
everywhere, and that's why he's

00:03:48.616 --> 00:03:49.806
like the jack in the box.

00:03:50.096 --> 00:03:52.136
&gt;&gt;Gina: So you use [Japanese]
and [Japanese] is someone

00:03:52.486 --> 00:03:54.896
above you, is giving to you, okay?

00:03:55.286 --> 00:03:59.056
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Japanese teacher, Gina
Nakahara, sees the new technology

00:03:59.056 --> 00:04:02.226
in her classroom as an
asset and a challenge.

00:04:02.226 --> 00:04:04.306
&gt;&gt;Gina: I'm very comfortable
with teaching the grammar

00:04:04.306 --> 00:04:06.846
and the vocabulary,
introducing the dialog

00:04:06.846 --> 00:04:07.976
and having my students practice it.

00:04:08.516 --> 00:04:11.736
&gt;&gt;[speaking Japanese]

00:04:12.236 --> 00:04:14.326
&gt;&gt;Gina: I can do that with
my eyes closed already.

00:04:14.376 --> 00:04:15.876
It's become very routine for me.

00:04:16.246 --> 00:04:17.966
But to incorporate the technology

00:04:17.966 --> 00:04:22.146
and to bring Japan a little
closer has been challenging,

00:04:22.146 --> 00:04:24.546
but I think in the long
run for the students,

00:04:24.736 --> 00:04:29.566
it would be that much more
meaningful and exciting for them.

00:04:29.926 --> 00:04:33.556
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Nakahara's students have
held online discussions about topics

00:04:33.556 --> 00:04:34.936
like the Hiroshima bombing

00:04:35.156 --> 00:04:36.976
and communicated directly
with students in Japan.

00:04:37.516 --> 00:04:41.646
&gt;&gt;Student: [speaking Japanese]

00:04:42.146 --> 00:04:45.506
What it means is, I'm Chen and
this is my senior year high school,

00:04:45.896 --> 00:04:48.436
and I'm a bit short, but I
have a cheerful personality

00:04:48.526 --> 00:04:49.636
and I wear glasses.

00:04:49.636 --> 00:04:50.106
Nice to meet you.

00:04:51.216 --> 00:04:53.286
&gt;&gt;Gina: There's a greater world
out there that we're looking at.

00:04:53.866 --> 00:04:56.566
Other issues that do affect
them, like nuclear weapons

00:04:56.566 --> 00:05:00.706
and the understanding that culture
and language is not a barrier.

00:05:00.816 --> 00:05:05.066
It's something that they can
learn and overcome and share.

00:05:05.906 --> 00:05:08.156
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Whether they're building
sites for the world wide web,

00:05:08.346 --> 00:05:12.526
producing documentaries and cable
television shows, or staging plays,

00:05:12.966 --> 00:05:17.786
students seem to put more into their
work when there's an audience for it.

00:05:17.786 --> 00:05:23.776
&gt;&gt;Who are you?

00:05:24.296 --> 00:05:26.146
&gt;&gt;Man: We show our
work to the school.

00:05:26.146 --> 00:05:30.306
We show it on public access,
so that it's not just a matter

00:05:30.306 --> 00:05:33.756
of doing a bunch of papers and then
getting a grade back and walking on.

00:05:33.976 --> 00:05:36.596
&gt;&gt;Oh no, what am I to do now?

00:05:37.336 --> 00:05:39.986
&gt;&gt;Man: They're actually doing
something that's bringing together a

00:05:39.986 --> 00:05:44.006
lot of different things and
they do take pride in it.

00:05:44.006 --> 00:05:45.606
&gt;&gt;What a curious feeling.

00:05:46.376 --> 00:05:52.736
