00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:07.340
We took the original concept from the pioneers
who lived in Appalachian Mountains. They lived

00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:11.640
on subsistence farms, that had buildings around
the main house that supported the main farmhouse.

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:16.059
Those buildings are things like smoke houses,
barns, things like that. We took the idea

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:20.340
and made it into our Outbuilding Modules,
and those outbuildings create energy which

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:21.449
now power the main home.

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:26.949
The concept has been integrated into every
aspect of the design of this home. You can

00:00:26.949 --> 00:00:31.690
see this within the massing of the house.
It's essentially a compound of buildings.

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:36.990
It can also be seen in all the materials that
we've used, as well as the detailing of the

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:42.310
home, and the overall experience I think reinforces
this notion of homesteading. The team tried

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:46.559
to use a lot of conventional systems within
the house.

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:53.190
We used a lot of very affordable, very vernacular
materials such as steel, wood siding -- things

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:54.839
that everyone uses on every farm.

00:00:54.839 --> 00:00:58.809
While there are some things that are very
unique to the area, and unique to the house

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:03.280
that are built-in, there's a lot of things
that can be found off-the-shelf, and are readily

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.610
available, and that helps us to make a more
affordable home.

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:10.120
We really wanted to integrate our technology
into the architectureů

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:12.490
ůand that's happened in every aspect of the
building.

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:16.740
We really wanted to make sure that, especially
with our solar panels, that they were actually

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.410
integrated into the architecture, and not
just attached to a roof.

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:23.150
We have the Great Porch, which is covered
with a bifacial canopy.

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:27.420
It's something that you experience from underneath,
but it also produces energy. A solar thermal

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:30.230
skylight is located right over our coreů

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:34.810
ůso that all our hot water is created right
above where we need it, which is our bathroom,

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:39.480
and our kitchen. We actually let light through
that skylight, so that we have natural light

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:43.700
coming into our bathroom and hallways leading
up to our bathroom. Another really interesting

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:48.590
one is the Trombe wall. Which is often, Trombe
walls of the past, were kind of a very solid

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.950
wall that you wouldn't really necessarily
want in your living room. We created one using

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:55.300
phase change materials that actually let's
light inů

00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:00.120
ůand you get a view through it, and it will
help to modulate the temperatures of the home.

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:04.580
We wanted to make something for the average
homeowner, and average contractor to be able

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:05.580
to build.

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:09.160
Part of that is because it goes back to the
same concept of homesteading. They would've

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:12.650
built things out of what they had available,
out of technologies that they already knew.

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:16.320
So, one of the ways we dealt with that was
doing staggered stud framing, which is a really

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:20.349
great way to increase your R-value, but it's
also a way that anybody can build a home.

00:02:20.349 --> 00:02:26.520
To close the thermal envelope, we used ridged
insulation on the exterior to give us a nice,

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.060
tight thermal envelope.

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:32.690
We really wanted to have at least a two-bedroom
house. We felt that a one-bedroom is not realistic

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:35.630
for the way Americans live, that's more like
an apartment, not a house.

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:39.730
This house can transform in a lot of different
ways. The main place that this happens is

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:42.120
in the flexible living/dining/kitchen area.

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:46.590
We have a projection screen that covers the
kitchen, and creates an amazing home theater.

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:52.410
We also have a really exciting bay window,
which helps to make that space feel more open

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:53.490
and link it to our garden.

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:58.320
The students did a great job pushing people
outside; there's a lot of outdoor living space

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:01.940
that can be used to extend the small interior
spaces.

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:06.780
We also have a private porch off of our bedrooms,
which is for more intimate kind of reading,

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:08.100
quiet activities.

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:14.040
The Solar Homestead embodies its concept from
start to finish. You can see it through the

00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.390
overall forms; you can see it through the
materials.

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:21.569
We are probably the only ones that have pushed
our concept all the way 'till the end of modernized

00:03:21.569 --> 00:03:22.569
homesteading.

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:27.340
I think carrying that concept, that important
concept, of independence, ingenuity -- that's

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:29.422
what makes us standout from all the rest.
