00:00:05.109 --> 00:00:08.790
The power module is the controller for the
high draw items like the electric fuel pump,

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:10.590
the cooling fans, and the O2 sensor.

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.432
Now this can be mounted anywhere on the car,
if you have a restored muscle car and you

00:00:14.432 --> 00:00:17.869
want to hide your EFI system you can, this
can go all the way inside of the car like

00:00:17.869 --> 00:00:21.130
in the glove compartment with extensions that
are available from MSD.

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:25.090
It does not cause any kind of radio frequency,
so it won't interrupt your radio, but in our

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:27.070
case we're going to go under the hood.

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:31.230
Now here you have a couple of options, the
inner fender is a classic place to put this,

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:35.390
but in our case, we're going to mount it to
the fire wall.

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:40.320
Fixing the unit to the fire wall is as simple
as using self taping screws.

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.820
Ok now the power module's fastened to the
fire wall we can think about the wiring harness.

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:48.900
Now the kit comes with a wiring harness with
a very long series of pig tails on it, and

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:52.510
what these do is they run things like the
electric fuel pump, the cooling fans, and

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:57.120
the O2 sensor, it starts by plugging it in.

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:00.410
Next up we're going to be running these wires
in such a way that they don't make any contact

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:03.400
with any hot spots or moving parts.

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:07.930
When the stage is set and our Chevelle is
almost ready to jump into the 21st century,

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:11.510
yes the carburetor is coming off and the fuel
injector is going on, but let's have a quick

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:14.830
look at the MSD Atomic EFI throttle body.

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:18.461
The thing that's beautiful about this is it's
modular design, it's very very sanitary to

00:01:18.461 --> 00:01:22.720
look at, there's not a lot of external components
like the map sensor, the TPS sensor, they're

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:27.400
all built in as are the fuel injectors which
are feeding each of the venturi from the corners.

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:32.540
Again it's self contained, sanitary and really
easy to look at, beyond that it requires less

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:37.420
wiring, has a single fuel line, it has a cross
over fuel rail, roller bearings for the throttle

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.710
blade shafts, and an integrated fuel pressure
sensor.

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:51.500
Well now it's time to take that carburetor
off.

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:55.850
The MSD throttle cable bracket is universal,
it will accept all Ford, GM, and Chrysler

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:00.380
kick downs, throttle cables, and throttle
rods, but what you want to do is the parts

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:04.720
that were on our carburetor that we worked
with before, we're transferring onto the throttle

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:07.360
body so they could work once again here.

00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:11.170
Again, very simple, swap the parts from the
carburetor on to the fuel injection unit and

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.640
you'll be good to go.

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:17.590
Like all EFI systems, we have to have information
for the computer on engine temperature, and

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:21.530
the best place to get that is the engine coolant
temperatures, so we have a sending unit that

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:25.820
we're threading into the cylinder head right
here, we're going to wire it up and we want

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:28.040
to make sure that the wire doesn't get any
contact with anything hot that could melt

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:29.040
it.

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:32.760
With the throttle body bolted to the engine,
now we can attach the wires to the system,

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.730
those connections include the battery positive,
battery negative, switch 12 volt, and also

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:41.650
a trigger from the distributor to the fuel
injection unit to tell the injectors when

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:45.060
to run, that's a simple wire on our MSD ready
to run distributor.

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:49.660
Under the car we have to connect the electric
fuel pump, the O2 sensor, and that totals

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:53.750
8 wires, but remember, there are some optional
connections which include, the ability to

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:59.010
run two cooling fans, and finally if we choose
to we can also trigger a kick up for the AC

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:03.700
in the event that the AC turns on we can actually
compensate the idle speed for that, so basically

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:09.380
it's an AC kick up sensor, so again, 8 wires
to get it running, it couldn't be simpler.

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:12.959
Connecting the gas tank to the fuel injection
unit is really easy, now the MSD throttle

00:03:12.959 --> 00:03:17.150
body does come with an AN fitting, it's a
-6, but in our case because we are going to

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:21.090
use the rubber, we're going to use the included
bobbed fitting, we're just going to plug our

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:22.340
rubber line right under that.

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:30.100
Going to be sure that we use an EFI specific
clamp on this.
