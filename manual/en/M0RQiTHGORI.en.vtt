00:00:09.859 --> 00:00:14.029
Well today is November 4, 2012.

00:00:14.029 --> 00:00:17.240
We're looking at a pile of Lego

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:22.880
that matter of fact,
can cover almost a whole bed here.

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:24.760
I'm in my supposedly new Lego room.

00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:29.939
I just what to show you guys
how big this mound of Lego is.

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:35.230
And I got all kinds of pieces here.
Most of this has already been sorted through.

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:38.830
Oh like plate and bricks and stuff.

00:00:38.830 --> 00:00:42.830
This is just basic stuff.
I haven't went through it all yet.

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:46.220
So that's the massive pile of Lego.

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:49.020
I think there's like 100 and some odd pounds of it.

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.750
Not sure. I don't know.
There's millions of pieces.

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:56.100
Coming over here,

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.100
I started doing some dividing here.

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.500
I've been doing this for awhile.
I'm slowly doing it.

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:04.910
You can see that I have some wall elements here.

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:06.850
Let's see.

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:09.280
Spigots.

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:10.830
Some greenery and stuff.

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:15.720
I will tutorial on this later.

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.140
Well not a tutorial but a walk through.

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:20.950
You can see I haven't labeled anything yet

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:23.850
You can see a bunch of these windows here.

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:31.270
There's those 30-degree sloped bricks
you guys all love so much.

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:35.340
Printed bricks.
Anything that's got a printed label on it

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.410
I stick it in here so they don't get all scuffed up.

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:40.200
Here's my mini-figs.

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:42.080
They're kind of in a disarray,

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:46.140
but I keep them all in here.

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:49.429
I don't see anything spectacular in here.

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:53.720
I just keep them separate from the rest of the Lego.

00:01:54.520 --> 00:02:00.970
So ..., mini-figs are not my main favorite category.

00:02:00.970 --> 00:02:03.770
I'm starting to go through everything now.
I'm going through all the Technic stuff

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:07.120
So anything that's Technic I'm going to throw in here.

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:12.629
I have lots of cogs, gears, pulleys, wheels, bushings.

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:14.429
Anything you can think of I have it in here.

00:02:14.429 --> 00:02:17.070
I'm starting to divide it all out.

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:20.889
And that's basically how I'm doing that.

00:02:20.889 --> 00:02:22.299
I'm going to get a few more of these.

00:02:22.299 --> 00:02:25.939
Maybe two more Stack-On type tings.

00:02:25.939 --> 00:02:31.189
So I can line this closet in here with this.

00:02:31.189 --> 00:02:36.729
And here is some weapons and tools and such.

00:02:36.729 --> 00:02:41.279
And you can see I have weapons, drills, shovels, brooms.

00:02:41.279 --> 00:02:44.900
There's a hairbrush I think from one of the Belville sets.

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.349
So I got a lot here going on.

00:02:48.349 --> 00:02:50.659
Here's some other stuff.

00:02:50.659 --> 00:02:52.539
I call it my little mini grocery store.

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:54.439
You got glasses, bones,

00:02:54.439 --> 00:02:56.919
there's a seashell down there.

00:02:56.919 --> 00:03:01.259
More wineglasses.
There's the turkey there with eight legs.

00:03:01.259 --> 00:03:04.709
Bread and hotdogs.

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:06.229
There's some cherries.

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:09.830
Apples and fruits and morocco's and all that stuff.

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:14.469
There's some kind of mug
that you would win of one of the Racer sets.

00:03:14.469 --> 00:03:19.209
There's cauldron with pots and pans
and two gold plates.

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:23.209
So that's my grocery store there.

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:28.189
And there's some grey tiles.

00:03:28.189 --> 00:03:30.749
I keep all the grey tiles ...
light and dark grey in here.

00:03:30.749 --> 00:03:33.799
because I use those for mosaics and stuff
but I keep them in there separate.

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:37.419
And here's the colored ones.

00:03:37.419 --> 00:03:38.960
So that's a lot of tiles.

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:43.329
I filled two little plastic coffee cans.

00:03:43.329 --> 00:03:46.849
Let's take a look at this big chest of drawers here.

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:48.749
I keep some of my plates in here.

00:03:48.749 --> 00:03:51.829
I shouldn't be storing them like this
but that's the only place.

00:03:51.829 --> 00:03:56.079
Also I have some plates over here
but I need to wash those because

00:03:56.079 --> 00:03:59.019
you can pretty much see they got dust on them.

00:03:59.019 --> 00:04:00.189
I just dug them out of the closet.

00:04:00.189 --> 00:04:05.249
So they're going to go in here when I clean them.

00:04:05.249 --> 00:04:08.489
There's not a lot here to go on,

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:11.999
and I'm trying to find that other one I just had.

00:04:11.999 --> 00:04:18.940
Oh yes, I even have this from the Scorpion Pyramid.
No stickers.

00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:21.249
So this is a good ...

00:04:21.249 --> 00:04:26.899
if I had two of these,
I could make a really large castle.

00:04:26.899 --> 00:04:28.780
This one here's just got odds-and-ends.

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:31.610
It's just got weird brackets and boats and stuff.

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:37.389
Not much going on in there.
Now the bottom one is roof tiles.

00:04:37.389 --> 00:04:40.130
Yes it's full of roof tiles.

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:41.520
As a matter of fact that's only about ....

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:46.209
I'm still missing some roof tiles
because I'm still going through my big pile.

00:04:46.209 --> 00:04:52.369
All kinds of colors.
These are not inverted. These are regular sloped tiles.

00:04:52.369 --> 00:04:56.940
20-degrees, 30-degrees, and 45s.

00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:58.470
And some of these really steep slope ones.

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:01.989
I'm not sure of the angles of those.

00:05:02.289 --> 00:05:06.289
I got enough to roof a couple of houses.
Maybe roof a small real actual shed

00:05:06.289 --> 00:05:08.139
that you could actually put your lawnmower in. [Laughs]

00:05:08.439 --> 00:05:10.160
You never know.

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:12.099
A whole bunch of grey base plates.

00:05:12.099 --> 00:05:15.750
I got tons of these.
You can never not have too many of those.

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:17.959
Now here is that suburban home.

00:05:17.959 --> 00:05:21.449
I haven't really worked on it
because I've been busy with work and stuff.

00:05:21.449 --> 00:05:25.839
But I went and ordered all these tiles around it,

00:05:25.839 --> 00:05:29.619
and you'll see those.
You probably saw that video already.

00:05:29.619 --> 00:05:32.000
So I have some blacks,

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.900
blues,

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:35.430
pink, and purple,

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:39.010
and more blues and lime green and all that stuff.

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:40.679
So that's pretty much the tiles there.

00:05:40.679 --> 00:05:42.999
I just kind of got all that done.

00:05:42.999 --> 00:05:54.389
So this room will be used for Lego stuff pretty much.

00:05:54.389 --> 00:06:00.360
The big mound of Lego again.

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:04.930
I just love diving in there playing with this stuff
when I have extra time

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:12.759
which I lack having here.

00:06:12.759 --> 00:06:14.699
So this is my collection

00:06:14.699 --> 00:06:18.860
as of November 4, 2012.

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:20.659
It's not much to look at.

00:06:20.659 --> 00:06:24.659
I'm still in the processes of removing some of this stuff,

00:06:24.659 --> 00:06:27.429
and making this an actual Lego room.

00:06:27.429 --> 00:06:33.029
In fact I have to zoom out all the way
just to get the Lego to fit in here.

00:06:33.029 --> 00:06:37.729
So I hope you guys enjoy my little,

00:06:37.729 --> 00:06:41.979
I don't know what you would call a review of my Lego collection.

00:06:41.979 --> 00:06:44.219
This thing is going to probably be expanding by the end of the year.

00:06:44.219 --> 00:06:47.049
So I'll probably have to do one again
maybe next March or something.

00:06:48.249 --> 00:06:53.049
So thank you for watching!
