00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Ki Tavo literally means 'When you come.'

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
It's a story of a relationship with God –

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.000
about the Jewish people

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.000
coming into that relationship

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and what it really looks like

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.000
to 'come' to the Land,

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
a place we can build that relationship.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
The parsha begins with Moses telling

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.000
the Israelites to offer a portion

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.000
of the first fruits of the trees

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.000
that they pick each year to God

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
once they are settled in the Land.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
They are told to each make a basket,

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.000
bring it to the Temple, give it to the priest

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
who holds it up, and declare:

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.000
"We went down to Egypt

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.000
and they afflicted us,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:38.000
and we cried to God,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
who brought us out of Egypt, to this place,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
and now we bring the first fruits."

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Each of the Israelites is supposed to bring a tenth

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.000
of their food to the Temple,

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:47.000
each of them saying to God,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
'We have done our part, and brought this,

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.000
now you look down and bless us and the land.'

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
We give to God. God gives to us. 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
It's about being mutual.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Then Moses tells the Israelites two things

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.000
to do as they enter the land:

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
First, set up huge stones,

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
and write the whole Torah on them.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
These stones are set up right after the

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Israelites cross the Jordan

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.000
into the Land.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
And, afterward, they are coated with plaster.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
It's like embedding the Land itself with Torah.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.000
Then the Israelites stand

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.000
on top of two mountains:

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
Grizim, the mountain of blessing,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
and Eival, the mountain of curses.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Six tribes stand on each mountain

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.000
with the Levites standing

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.000
in the middle and saying,

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Cursed be the one who makes an idol

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.000
and the people all say,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Amen!

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.000
Cursed be the one

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.000
who denigrates his father or mother!

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Amen!

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.000
Cursed be the one 

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.000
who does not uphold the Torah!

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Amen!

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.000
And more.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000
And then the blessings are given.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
If the Israelites listen to God:

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.000
Blessed are you in the city and in the field.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
The fruit of your womb,

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.000
the fruit of your soil,

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.000
the fruit of your livestock

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
will be blessed.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.000
Blessed is your basket.

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:48.000
God will give blessing in your barns,

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.000
and everything else that you do.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:51.000
All your enemies will fear you.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.000
All of this will happen

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
only if the Israelites will do God's word,

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000
if they will hold their part of the commitment.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
And if the Israelites don't listen: 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.000
You will be cursed in the city,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
cursed in the field.

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Cursed is your basket,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:05.000
Your enemies will chase you

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.000
in all directions.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.000
For most of us,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000
talking about cursing and blessing,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000
punishment and reward, is strange, foreign,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
and often a turn-off.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.000
It is like some judge or policeman

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.000
standing over us telling us what to do,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
and it makes us feel far away

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000
and disconnected from the Torah.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.000
But maybe we could look

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.000
at it a little differently?

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000
More like a marriage.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:25.000
Two sides coming together

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000
to express their commitment for each other–

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.000
what they will give,

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
and what they expect to receive–

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
in good times, and in not-so-good times.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.000
Traditional parts

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
of a Jewish wedding ceremony

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000
are the ketuba (or the official contract),

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.000
and the giving of the ring,

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:41.000
symbols that express

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.000
the husband and wife's

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.000
commitment to each other when times

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
are good and happy, and, if they're not,

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
what they are still responsible

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.000
to provide for each other.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.000
You could think of it as the husband and wife

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.000
blessing each other:

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
I bless you in the city and in the field,

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
I bless your basket, I'll bring the first fruits–

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.000
And if you don't hold your side,

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.000
that city, that field, that basket –

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
that's where you'll see what's missing.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
The Torah calls these blessings and curses

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.000
a covenant between

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.000
the Israelites and God.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
In other words, an agreement

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.000
between two sides about how they want

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.000
to express their love for each other.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
This is the ideal, intimate relationship

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000
for people to have with God, with the Torah,

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000
with each other, and with the Land.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000
It's like when we plant

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.000
something in the ground,

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000
plant it in good soil, water it right:

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
then the fruit will be good and sweet.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
If we don't, the fruit 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.000
doesn't show us its love.

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000
Finally the Torah tells us what this good soil,

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
this fertile ground is.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.000
Joy.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.000
If we don't make our commitments with joy,

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
live our committed life joyously,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000
the marriage is going to be rocky.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
But when we find a way to truly commit,

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000
to make a connection to God, with joy,

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.000
then we have the possibility

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000
of an eternal relationship.
