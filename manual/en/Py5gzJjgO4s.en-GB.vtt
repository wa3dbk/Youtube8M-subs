00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:14.460
Hi kids! Do you like violence?
Want me to grab a spare bear suit and stuff

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.920
you inside it?
Got an appetite, grab a couple slices

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.470
Mom and Dad lied when they told you I was
lifeless

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.187
What's this? Someone in the main office?
Hanging out after hours? How obnoxious

00:00:21.187 --> 00:00:22.187
Watching us on his monitor, preposterous
Time to wake the others, now we'll show him

00:00:22.187 --> 00:00:23.430
who the boss is
Call me Freddy, I'm the teddy with a temper

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:29.050
When I see a face like yours, I remember
Make it through the night and I'll bet they'll

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:30.050
give you tenure
Then you can be part of Freddy's family forever

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:40.970
Most of us got a major upgrade
So I hope you don't hate staying up late

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:42.930
If you're scared, give your resume an update
Cause unless you quit, you'll still be making

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:43.930
minimum wage

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:48.530
When I come to life, you got no place to hide
Keep an eye on the time and a light by your

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:54.210
side
You can try, if you'd like to survive five

00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:58.180
more nights
Stick around, don't be shy

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:02.160
We're your friends, we'll show you why

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:09.930
Beware Mangle, he'll leave your brains scrambled
You could say he's got a couple wires tangled

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.670
He likes surprising you from a higher angle
Keep an eye above ya, cause it's where he

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.570
likes to dangle
We got a brand new Freddy, Chica, Bonnie

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.190
You can bring balloons, boy, time to throw
the party

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:27.720
Put your mask on, cause now the fun is starting
Don't keep on long, it ain't fooling Foxy

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:28.880
Check the vents that we'll be crawling out
the bottom of

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.050
If you got doors, now you oughtta lock 'em
up

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:33.000
Whoops, I forgot, you don't even got 'em
Keep the music playing or we're gonna have

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.650
a problem
But don't relax once you have us distracted

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:42.100
We move around as sporadic as mechanical crackheads
We think on our own, no strings attached

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:43.100
If you don't believe that, ask the Marionette

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:44.930
Did you listen to the vision you saw?
As the clock keeps ticking, we'll be giving

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:48.650
you more
Do you remember the orignal four?

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:56.890
(Take a look at us now, cause our condition
is poor)

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:23.520
We were left to decay
In this dark, troubled place

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:26.430
Too late to run away
(Just don't run out of double As)

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:27.430
When I come to life, you got no place to hide
Keep an eye on the time and a light by your

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:28.430
side
You can try, if you'd like to survive five

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:29.430
more nights
Stick around, don't be shy

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:30.430
Just don't listen to the phone guy

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:31.430
Hello? Hello?
Wow, you made it this far

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:32.430
Honestly, didn't think you'd really ever get
far

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:33.430
Ha-ha, don't worry, you got nothing to fear
This is just the beginning of a thrilling

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:34.710
career
Now, the animatronics are known to bug out

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:40.010
Isn't that enough reason to get the f#%k out?!
Listen up, guy, this gig ain't for me

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:42.720
But we're having such fun and we'd hate you
to leave

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.330
You might mistake us for hostile monstrosities
But accidents will happen when you got a lot

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:47.330
of teeth
If you got a birthday, let us make it bright

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:48.330
It's so exciting when a party stops by for
a bite

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:49.330
We wait all night for the day to begin
With a special surprise that we save for the

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:50.330
end
If you don't already know how we like to make

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:51.330
friends
Then we'll show you now and you're gonna fit

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:52.330
right in

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:55.560
When I come to life, you got no place to hide
Keep an eye on the time and a light by your

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:56.560
side
You can try, if you'd like to survive five

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:57.560
more nights
Stick around, don't be shy

00:02:57.560 --> 00:02:59.410
We're your friends, we'll show you why
Join us and die

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:01.140
Join us and die
Join us and die
