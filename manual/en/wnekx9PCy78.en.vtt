00:00:00.459 --> 00:00:03.480
Hello! My name is Sai! And oh oh oh!

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:07.529
I know that we really have not been and you have to ask

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:13.559
where our blue background. But the important thing is that we are with you!

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:21.900
But seriously, at the moment we're in Kazan,

00:00:21.909 --> 00:00:26.099
where we arrived, taking advantage of their winter vacation

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.460
In addition, many of you, I think, knows that Japan

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:32.500
is now the snow, blizzards and so we have come to Russia.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:34.580
Where are all well.

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.079
Perhaps some of you are surprised by a vacation in March,

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:42.299
but Japan's winter vacation lasts from late February to early April.

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:45.249
But basically, let's order.

00:00:45.249 --> 00:00:49.569
Today we will talk about education in Japan.
More precisely, about high schools.

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:54.880
And especially for this, we visited one of the Japanese high school Kawagoe - "Minami".

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.480
In Japan, the school made by the American way.

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:04.040
That is, the senior, middle and junior school is located in a completely different buildings. Independently from each other.

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:10.480
Therefore, Japanese students do not have to for 12 years to watch the faces of his classmates and teachers.

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:13.320
High schools in Japan, often have to be paid.

00:01:13.329 --> 00:01:16.240
And regardless of whether it is public or private.

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:19.480
Besides, it is not necessary, and most often, in order to do it,

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:21.780
it is necessary to take a rather complex examinations.

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.700
Surely, many of you have read or watched anime manga about high school.

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.580
Therefore, in the view of many, high school students look like this.

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:35.719
I do not want to disappoint you all, but they appear only in the sick imagination of artists.

00:01:35.719 --> 00:01:39.729
In fact, the Japanese students look ... usually.

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:44.969
Immediately warn the male half of our viewers, if you meet a beautiful blonde

00:01:44.969 --> 00:01:48.229
igh school student, painted with such lashes here,

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:51.989
feel free to be added to the average age of a high school so five more years.

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:57.049
The fact is that in Japanese schools, it does not matter, whether public or private,

00:01:57.049 --> 00:02:01.700
is forbidden to dye your hair, apply makeup, use perfume.

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.480
And both boys and girls.

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:08.440
And this beauty - is not nothing but a middle-aged women who want to look like a schoolgirl.

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:13.800
And as so exciting of all, short skirts, then yes, that is what it is.

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.760
Although all the rules of the school, the skirt much longer, just

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.900
a schoolgirl manage their tuck.

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:23.530
Well, judge for yourself. Then they can not be painted.

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:29.270
But schools provide not only a personal, nominal form, but tracksuits and sometimes even bags.

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.140
And here are some interesting things that we personally

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:36.050
have noticed when visiting high school Kawagoe "Minami".

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:39.290
1. Building schools is quite simple.

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:45.450
That is, if the standard public schools Russia is not uncommon such a thing as interactive whiteboards,

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:49.470
monitors, computers and TVs in every office, in Japan there is no such.

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:55.980
That is, all of these stories about the total automation in this country are not of such a nature as we all think.

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:59.980
And recently, so in general, it was decided to build more schools from the tree.

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:01.280
A kind of "Noah's Ark".

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:06.660
Most often these are small rooms, with an opening on the old style, in the side doors,

00:03:06.660 --> 00:03:10.520
as well as a single party No sharing with the neighbor pervert.

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:13.440
In the office, on the back wall, and there are special hangers

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:16.820
where students can hang your clothes and a change of shoes.

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:23.260
But this is all easily compensated huge gyms and beautiful gardens outside the school.

00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:27.500
But even in school, you will find vending machines with drinks and coffee.

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:30.100
2. Lack of normal heating.

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:34.040
In Japan, except for Hokkaido - it is generally a very big problem.

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:37.540
Therefore, students often have to bring to bear extra blankets,

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:43.020
hey warmed the classroom. And all the girls are forbidden to wear pants!

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.920
Even in the winter!

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:49.370
Therefore, if we compare the fair, the Japanese students is much more adapted to cold than the Russian.

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:54.340
3. An incredible level of self-employment and students!

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:58.340
If the Russian schools the concept of "elder" and "student council" - the ones

00:03:58.340 --> 00:04:04.500
who wipe the board and carry logs, in Japan it is a very important position.

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:07.390
The level of self-management in schools is so high

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:10.430
that when the school decides to organize another festival,

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:14.260
the teacher just take a lot of money, give it to the disciples,

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:19.440
and those already decide how many beads buy and how much to hire external personnel.

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:24.680
In addition, in Japanese schools have a huge number of different clubs and electives!

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:28.280
So when evening classes end, students do not run home

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:31.240
and stay in school, in most of these clubs.

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:32.530
Crazy!

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:37.820
4. In public schools, dominated by the female half.

00:04:37.820 --> 00:04:44.360
And so prevalent that in some of them there are separate classes where only one girl.

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:49.520
5. And another fact. In Japanese schools, there is no standard for us the concept of "discharge".

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:55.520
No fairy tales, no romance, no beautiful dresses, and household appliances as a gift to the director.

00:04:55.520 --> 00:05:01.680
But in Japanese schools is not uncommon trip the class not only in the places in Japan, but also abroad.

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:07.540
If everything summarize, the high school - it is quite difficult, and at the same time, full of time in the life of the Japanese.

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:12.260
Although it is not, and some Russian facilities, but there are strict Japanese regulations.

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:19.660
