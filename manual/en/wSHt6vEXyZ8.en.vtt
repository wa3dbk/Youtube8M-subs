00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:17.350
Alstar was founded in 1969, in operation for
44 years now, currently our head office is

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:23.271
in Hinton Alberta, with satellite offices
in Calgary, Fox Creek, Dawson Creek B.C. and

00:00:23.271 --> 00:00:26.439
soon to be Peace River Alberta.

00:00:26.439 --> 00:00:31.410
Alstar provides complete oilfield construction,
from pipelines, small facilities, to large

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:32.410
scale plants.

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:36.820
I think our biggest advantage over our competition
is our ability to pre- fabricate structural

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:37.820
steel and pipe.

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:42.420
We have fabrication facilities in several
strategic locations in Alberta.

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:46.640
By pre-fabing in the controlled shop environment,
we're able to maintain a high level of efficiency,

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:47.780
safety, and quality.

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:53.379
In a quick efficient manner we can send out
a finished product that's ready to bolt up,

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:55.219
put into service.

00:00:55.219 --> 00:01:02.309
You know, I think one thing that's really
been key to our growth is that us, our leadership

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:08.900
group, consisting of five guys, we're blue
collar workers, and we've been in the trenches

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:09.900
ourselves.

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.930
And I think that really helps in our relationship
with our employees, they understand that we

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:16.500
have been there.

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:20.970
And I think on a whole that really helps develop
the company, we know what it takes to get

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:21.970
the job done.

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:26.950
Its our intent to train and mentor workers
so that when they go to a situation they're

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:30.060
able to identify the hazards and deal with
them.

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:36.260
And so that we have buy in, we write our policies
and procedures internally, to keep it as practical

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:37.260
as possible.

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:43.820
That's enabled us to just recently achieve
3 million man hours without a lost time accident.

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:49.140
One of the key things that really have attracted
me to the company are the four core values,safety

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.790
is always number one, integrity, family oriented,
and ensuring that wherever you are, weather

00:01:54.790 --> 00:02:00.350
you're on the shop floor, or working behind
a desk in the office, you're always putting

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:01.509
out quality work.

00:02:01.509 --> 00:02:05.119
Alstar looks to grow in the future, and the
future looks bright.

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:08.479
Currently we have about four hundred members
on our team, and those four hundred members

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:12.780
have been very successful in helping us come
this far, but we need more people to join

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.983
the team to allow us to grow, and to be a
driving force in the energy business in Western

00:02:14.983 --> 00:02:14.989
Canada.
