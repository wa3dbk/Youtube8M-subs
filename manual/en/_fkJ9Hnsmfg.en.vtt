00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:06.720
How to Become an Expert at Cat Training.

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.950
Train your cat to do something unusual and
show your friends that your pet can do more

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:12.980
than just eat and sleep.

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:21.510
You will need Veterinarian Cat treats Cat
food Bell or clicker Praise Double-sided tape

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:29.080
Aluminum foil Patience 10-15 minutes a day
(optional) Disinfectant (optional) and spray

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:30.390
repellent (optional).

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:31.529
Step 1.

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:35.780
Schedule an examination for your cat with
your veterinarian before you begin training.

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:40.640
You want to make sure they don't have any
health problems that may be aggravated by

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:41.640
training.

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:42.640
Step 2.

00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:45.250
Make sure you have your cat's undivided attention.

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:49.000
Eliminate distractions, such as music and
television sounds.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.510
Cats are naturally curious, so you may need
to show them a treat.

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:56.820
Hold it in your fingertips and let them smell
it, but don't give it to them.

00:00:56.820 --> 00:00:57.930
Step 3.

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:00.210
Teach your cat one trick at a time.

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.450
If you try to combine tricks or start new
trick before the first is mastered, you're

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:06.280
likely to confuse them.

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:11.300
Spend 10 to 15 minutes a day on a single trick
until they've mastered it.

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:12.300
Step 4.

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:15.660
Give the cat a reward each time they perform
the desired behavior.

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:20.270
You can use their favorite food, treats, or
pet them as a reward.

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:24.980
After they get the hang of the behavior, give
the reward less often.

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:26.380
Step 5.

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:31.140
Ring a bell or click a clicker when the cat
performs the trick or behavior that you are

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.550
teaching, and praise the cat for good behavior.

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:37.860
Eventually, they will associate the sound
and praise with the action and won't need

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:39.420
rewards.

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:40.569
Step 6.

00:01:40.569 --> 00:01:43.360
Discourage undesirable behavior with deterrents.

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:48.830
If your cat scratches furniture, apply double-sided
tape to where they scratch to deter them.

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:53.220
If they go to the bathroom outside of their
litter box, lay sheets of aluminum foil where

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:54.340
they go.

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:56.830
Cats are averse to those textures.

00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:02.180
Thoroughly clean the area where the cat went
with disinfectant and spray a repellent, available

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:03.970
at pet supply stores.

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:05.200
Step 7.

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:07.430
Appreciate the time you share with your cat.

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:11.960
The training process takes patience, but you
may find that it's a bonding experience, too.

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:18.880
Did you know As of 2005, approximately 30
percent of American households had cats.
