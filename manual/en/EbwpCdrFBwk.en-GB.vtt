Hello and welcome to

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:09.660
this Camera Jungle

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:12.530
review video of the Nikon AF 80-200mm

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:17.250
f/2.8D lens. This is a stellar lens
for an advanced amateur,

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.619
semi-pro or professional photographer. It's
one of those lenses that has a bit of a

00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:22.610
cult following

00:00:22.610 --> 00:00:26.450
as many pros prefer it to the 70-200mm
which replaced it.

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:30.950
Let's have a look at the specifications;
it has a constant f/2.8 aperture

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:34.750
so it's great for freezing subject
motion in low light. The extra-low

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:38.630
dispersion glass controls the chromatic
aberrations that cause purple fringing.

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:42.170
the autofocus override is great for
portrait shoots where you want to place

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:45.620
the slither of focus on the subject's eye
without re-composing.

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:49.390
The all-metal housing makes it a robust
tool the professionals have used on

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:51.539
challenging assignments across the world.

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:55.010
On a DX body the range is equivalent to

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:58.260
120-300mm, perfect for sports,
wildlife

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.649
and fashion photography. This lens has
been a favourite of professional

00:01:01.649 --> 00:01:03.160
photographers for decades

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:07.000
and it's still going strong. If you shoot
moving subjects then Vibration Reduction

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.230
won't help you much

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:11.480
and with this lens you don't have to pay for
something you don't need.

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:15.720
The solid build quality and excellent optics are usually only available in much more expensive

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:16.520
lenses.

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.700
It would be a great choice for the
emerging wedding photographer as the

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:21.440
wide f/2.8 aperture

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:24.880
is crucial for stopping motion during
dimly lit ceremonies.

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:30.340
It's a fantastic portrait lens that gets
creamy smooth blurred background Bokeh

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:34.490
for stunning bridal shots. Sports
photographers don't always need VR

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.140
as they rely on shutter speed to stop
fast-moving action so they appreciate

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:39.920
the chance to pocket the extra cash.

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.620
if you're looking for the best value for
money telephoto zoom available on the

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:44.260
market

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:48.650
