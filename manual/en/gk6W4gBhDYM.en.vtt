What is Rugby Sevens?

00:00:06.753 --> 00:00:10.546
Rugby Sevens is an exciting sport. The games are only 14 minutes long with seven-minute halves.

00:00:11.172 --> 00:00:20.421
It’s quick. It’s very fast. For spectators who don’t necessarily know rugby, I think rugby sevens is the perfect sport. It’s almost like a sprint for 14 minutes.

00:00:21.051 --> 00:00:28.164
It’s a bit like taking the essentials of the game and putting it out there for the crowd to see; that’s kind of what sevens really does.

00:00:28.378 --> 00:00:31.998
Tell us about your Pan Am experience Guadalajara in 2011.

00:00:34.429 --> 00:00:37.303
It’s such an awesome feeling. Not many people actually get to represent their country and we’re really a tight-knit group.

00:00:37.389 --> 00:00:40.082
That’s something we hold over other teams. Other teams don’t quite have that.

00:00:40.283 --> 00:00:42.556
Nathan Hirayama
Team Canada, rugby sevens and Canada’s senior men’s rugby team

00:00:42.931 --> 00:00:46.059
There is a big comradery between the teams and it was something really special and exciting.

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:53.276
Being a part of the whole experience—seeing the opening and closing ceremonies—was an awesome time. Obviously doing really well [in Guadalajara] was great for us.

00:00:53.514 --> 00:00:58.985
I don’t remember us playing that great in that final, but I guess that’s how sevens goes. You get a couple of breaks your way.

00:00:59.271 --> 00:01:01.186

Team Canada, rugby sevens and Canada’s senior men’s rugby team

00:01:01.434 --> 00:01:04.861
The day before we watched the women’s soccer team win the gold medal. It was such a great feeling to see that and we all wanted to do that.

00:01:05.077 --> 00:01:12.283
Winning was awesome. The very first rugby gold medal going to Canada was amazing. It was a little bit of history, that’s for sure.

00:01:12.613 --> 00:01:17.153
Standing on the podium and getting the gold medal was the best moment in my sporting career.

00:01:17.423 --> 00:01:19.392
How exciting is it going to be to defend the gold medal on home turf in 2015?

00:01:19.569 --> 00:01:22.224
If you could pick a place to defend the championship, at home would have to be the place to be.

00:01:22.435 --> 00:01:28.916
You have full support from everyone. They’re making noise distracting the other team and it amps us up; it’s great to have.

00:01:29.122 --> 00:01:34.264
With the game growing so quickly and being in the Olympic Games, there’s going to be a bit of a spotlight on it.

00:01:34.452 --> 00:01:41.332
Being defending champions from Guadalajara, I think if we come back here and do it again at home, it would be just amazing.

00:01:41.594 --> 00:01:49.804
That’s a year out from the Olympic Games and we’ve been coming up leaps and bounds. We’re playing some really good rugby so winning it would be a major milestone.

00:01:50.656 --> 00:01:53.013
How important are the TORONTO 2015 Games to Canada’s rugby sevens team?

00:01:53.234 --> 00:01:56.884
The Pan Am Games is something that we’re really gearing up towards.

00:01:57.099 --> 00:02:03.713
It being in Toronto and also probably a qualifier for the Olympic Games, it’s something that we’re focused on even though it’s a couple of years ahead.

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:06.819
We’ll be able to have family, friends and everyone there supporting.

00:02:06.977 --> 00:02:11.308
Obviously we know the crowd’s going to be awesome. It’s almost like having an eight player on the field.

00:02:11.616 --> 00:02:15.328
It’s going to be great. It’s going to be a great atmosphere for a great event on home soil.

00:02:15.529 --> 00:02:23.032
Playing in front of home fans gives us an opportunity to really support the sport and help it grow.

00:02:23.271 --> 00:02:26.057
It’s definitely a massive tournament for us and for Canada.

00:02:26.191 --> 00:02:27.234
It’s going to be a great experience.
