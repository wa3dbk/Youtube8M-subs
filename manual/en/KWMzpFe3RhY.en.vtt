00:01:23.582 --> 00:01:28.190
So Peter, looking at the car this was the Rallye du Maroc for you?

00:01:28.214 --> 00:01:36.369
Yes it is a good learning moment. 
That's also where we used this rally for, learning for Dakar.

00:01:37.574 --> 00:01:42.690
I'm not sure if I go to Dakar, but we learned a lot here.

00:01:42.948 --> 00:01:46.140
But this last stage was less succesfull.

00:01:46.754 --> 00:01:51.300
We rolled the car. Not a very big problem, it could be repaired.

00:01:51.534 --> 00:01:57.806
But looking at the damage under the bonnet it takes a lot of time to repair it.

00:01:58.386 --> 00:02:03.278
With Dakar we should repaire this, but now 
we have only two stages left we decided to quit.

00:02:03.862 --> 00:02:08.120
The car is now in a reasonable condition.

00:02:09.324 --> 00:02:14.781
We will try to go to Dakar, not quite sure, but we'll see!

00:02:24.142 --> 00:02:28.023
Peter, great day here in Zagora, how was your day?

00:02:28.468 --> 00:02:33.437
After a day of rest ready to start again, the car was completely fixed.

00:02:33.649 --> 00:02:38.804
It took a lot of work but is in quite new condition now.

00:02:39.058 --> 00:02:47.163
This morning we started really good, of course you
have to get into the rithm again after a big crash.

00:02:47.585 --> 00:02:54.547
So started good, but after 50 kilometres the left rear bearing broke.

00:02:55.473 --> 00:03:01.865
I think it is due to the crash.
 But because of that we drove 150 kilometres without good working brakes.

00:03:02.797 --> 00:03:06.386
That was really scary at some moments.

00:03:06.727 --> 00:03:08.913
Despite that we are here at the bivouac.

00:03:10.419 --> 00:03:13.846
Had a lot of dunes today, about 60 kilometres I think.

00:03:15.463 --> 00:03:19.441
I didn't have any experience but I really felt good about it.

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:25.107
We were only stuck for one time and that was our own fault.

00:03:25.577 --> 00:03:29.441
Because we didn't have enough speed to go up.

00:03:29.846 --> 00:03:37.727
Looking back we are really glad and looking forward to start tomorrow!
