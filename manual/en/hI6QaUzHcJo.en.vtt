All right, we're going to start off, by making
the marinade for our chicken, so we're going

00:00:07.959 --> 00:00:14.060
to grab two cloves of garlic. Then, we're
going to look on either end, for the little

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:20.980
brown parts, and once we find them, go ahead
and cut them off, and discard them, because

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:38.050
they're about the size, of what we want our
garlic to be.

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:49.304
All right, we're going to mince these down,
and then we're going to add them right here,

00:00:49.304 --> 00:01:14.000
into our bowl. We're going to measure a half
a tablespoon of curry powder,

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:28.350
and of cumin. We're going to cut a lime in
half, and we're going to squeeze the juice,

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:46.390
right over, and then we're going to add the
same, about a half tablespoon of honey. Then,

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:52.659
we're going to stir this all up together,
until it makes sort of a paste.
