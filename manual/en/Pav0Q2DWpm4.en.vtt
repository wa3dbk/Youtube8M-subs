Where can I come into a very large amount of money
in a very short period of time?

» MIA: Legally and without having to pay it back.
» BRUNO: Legally and without having to pay it back,

00:01:43.537 --> 00:01:47.107

As if finding a job is all that easy right now,
’cause it isn’t,

00:02:03.056 --> 00:02:06.026
and that’s also another story and kind of a rant

00:02:06.093 --> 00:02:09.930
about how hard it was finding straight jobs here,
especially ’cause we’re artists,

00:02:09.997 --> 00:02:14.101
and nobody wants to hire us
because we went to art school, and therefore,

00:02:14.168 --> 00:02:19.773
if we get a job at Toys Я Us or Bed and Bath,
we’re just gonna go work for Disney

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.677
within a couple weeks, ’cause, you know,
Disney gives out so many jobs.

00:02:23.744 --> 00:02:26.713

I don’t want to insult the Bed and Bath clientele

» Most of the people who shop at Bed and Bath

probably aren’t looking for some young guy
covered in tattoos, piercings, weird facial hair,
