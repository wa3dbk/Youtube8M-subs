00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.500
Hi! Today I will talk about this beautiful tree,

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.520
that is being poorly used in Brazil.

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:30.040
This tree is a Weeping fig, or Ficus benjamina, which is its scientific name.

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:37.700
It's a beautiful tree, which has this wonderful, huge canopy!

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:41.700
It can grow up to 15m high (50 feet).

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:47.740
I believe you see in the beginning of the video, my size compared to its size. 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:52.520
Many people love to plant it on the sidewalk,

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:56.180
love having potted and they have to take care!

00:00:56.190 --> 00:01:02.370
Look at these roots here, this is the normal feature of the plant.

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.930
It has aerial roots,

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:09.890
So it is no use to plant it deeper because
roots will rise.

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.220
Now imagine, this plant, has in its DNA, in its seed

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.640
it came programmed to be a giant tree!

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:21.640
So it is kind of impossible to control, right? 

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:26.620
As much as it is widely used in topiary and those things, all pruned.

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.980
I think it is ok to prune a plant 

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:33.260
to control a bit its growth,

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.480
a badly formed branch,

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:37.300
or that is growing in a wrong place,

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:39.740
I think it is worth it,

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:46.140
but when you deform
completelly its shape, I am particularly, 

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.560
sorry for the plant, I think it must be very sad 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.880
to what happened to it.

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:55.120
Well, let's get back here to our today's darling, the Ficus.

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:59.270
How to Identify a Ficus? First the leaflet.

00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:04.810
it is an oval and pointed leaf.

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:07.240
It has also some red little fruits.

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:12.340
But here in Brazil these fruits have no seed, 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:15.440
Because this is not a Brazilian native tree,  

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.000
is a tree native to Asia.

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:24.480
China, India, Thailand, well, several countries around Asia.

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:31.480
And is a tree that here in Brazil people love to have it, put it in a pot,

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:34.230
have indoors and so on. 

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:38.060
For a while, while it is still young it stands to stay potted,  

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:43.260
but after a while, it almost asks to leave, do you know number 2? (this is a reference to a Brazilian movie called Tropa de Elite)

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:47.870
Ask to leave number 2! It is almost like that! It asks to leave, it starts

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:52.650
to get ugly and then it has to be transplanted to a place where it will have space to grow.

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:59.069
So it has to be a huge square, a farm or a park, 

00:02:59.069 --> 00:03:05.400
and then it will be very happy! But please! Do not plant it in the sidewalk of your home!

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.700
I beg you, do not plant it in the sidewalk, for Christ's sake!

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:12.460
Because after a while you will have a problem,

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:13.920
I am not cursing you...

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:17.040
Not at all! That is not my intention at all!

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:22.860
My intention is only to help and guide you, because the roots as you have seen there,

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:25.360
are super vigorous! 

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:30.100
These roots, they go searching, if they find a pipe 

00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:32.720
they keep on going through the pipe.

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.300
My brother bought a house with a Ficus in front.

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:39.340
It is a narrow sidewalk.

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:43.620
He had an infiltration problem, a clogged pipe.

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:48.220
I think it was about twenty yards to fifty feet inside.

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:52.980
He found the root of the Ficus. It goes searching, it goes inside,

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:55.900
it finds a hole and keep going.

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:59.010
There is another story that my mother also tells, that she was doing a garden

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:03.910
an apartment, it was a planter on the structure of the apartment, and a Ficus was planted there,

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:10.910
it was the 8th floor. The root of this Ficus went all the way down to the ground, it clogged all

00:04:10.930 --> 00:04:15.130
the flower boxes of that building! Imagine the damage!

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:25.860
So, guys, please, beware of this plant!

00:04:27.089 --> 00:04:32.809
