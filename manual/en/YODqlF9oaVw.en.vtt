00:00:01.867 --> 00:00:09.300
(♪♪♪)

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:12.333
Hi, my name is
Ladd Forsline

00:00:12.333 --> 00:00:13.433
I'm with Colorfin,

00:00:13.433 --> 00:00:15.067
the co-inventor
and co-manufacturers

00:00:15.067 --> 00:00:18.533
of PanPastels,
and Sofft Tools.

00:00:18.533 --> 00:00:20.067
Today we're going to show you
a few techniques

00:00:20.067 --> 00:00:24.833
with Sofft Tools that you can do
with pastel pencils,

00:00:24.833 --> 00:00:27.767
pastels, acrylics,
and watercolours.

00:00:27.767 --> 00:00:30.500
Sofft Tools are
a unique product.

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.900
We've made these
especially for PanPastels,

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:35.467
but we found that they work
great with water based mediums.

00:00:35.467 --> 00:00:38.267
One of the advantages of
the Sofft Tools is that

00:00:38.267 --> 00:00:42.000
they're made out of
a very dense, small pore foam,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.400
and what that does is it
lets you pick up the material

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:45.367
on the surface

00:00:45.367 --> 00:00:48.900
and not soak up so fast
into the sponge.

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:52.533
I'm going to just take
a couple of quick brief strokes

00:00:52.533 --> 00:00:55.167
of acrylic
straight out of the tube,

00:00:55.167 --> 00:00:56.867
and I'm just going to
put these down

00:00:56.867 --> 00:00:59.000
on some canvas pad.

00:01:05.967 --> 00:01:07.233
One of the things
that you can see

00:01:07.233 --> 00:01:09.033
is the material is
going on very thin,

00:01:09.033 --> 00:01:13.000
and with very little marks
or brush strokes.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.400
When you need to change
colours with this tool

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.733
you can wash it off
in a pot of water.

00:01:17.733 --> 00:01:20.567
It's going to take a little bit
of time to get the colour out

00:01:20.567 --> 00:01:21.500
so I'd recommend

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.333
just using
the opposite edge of it,

00:01:23.333 --> 00:01:24.467
or another tool.

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.233
You can see one of
the advantages is really

00:01:33.233 --> 00:01:35.733
there's no brush strokes,
and you're using all the paint,

00:01:35.733 --> 00:01:37.967
you can get very thin layers
of acrylic paint

00:01:37.967 --> 00:01:39.700
without mixing
a medium in with it.

00:01:49.733 --> 00:01:52.633
We've also got another range
of tools which are the knives.

00:01:52.633 --> 00:01:55.133
The knives have these
little corresponding covers,

00:01:55.133 --> 00:01:58.333
and the covers are
numbered one to four,

00:01:58.333 --> 00:01:59.633
the knives are
numbered one to four,

00:01:59.633 --> 00:02:02.867
so the four tip
fits the four knife.

00:02:02.867 --> 00:02:07.667
These are great for doing
some smaller detailed work.

00:02:07.667 --> 00:02:10.933
You can go back in and do
a little bit of impasto work

00:02:10.933 --> 00:02:11.800
if you need to.

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:12.833
What's nice about it is

00:02:12.833 --> 00:02:15.067
it works like an
absorbent palette knife,

00:02:15.067 --> 00:02:18.467
so instead of just having that
hard edged steel palette knife

00:02:18.467 --> 00:02:20.433
you've actually got
a nice soft little cushion

00:02:20.433 --> 00:02:21.933
that you can work with.

00:02:29.367 --> 00:02:31.633
The next thing I'm going to
show you is how you can

00:02:31.633 --> 00:02:35.300
use some watercolours
with the Sofft Tools.

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:38.767
This is just a sheet of
watercolour paper.

00:02:38.767 --> 00:02:41.267
I'm going to wet down the top
portion of the paper

00:02:41.267 --> 00:02:42.633
with a brush

00:02:42.633 --> 00:02:45.567
so I can show you what it's like
with wet on wet technique,

00:02:45.567 --> 00:02:47.033
and the bottom part
I'll leave dry

00:02:47.033 --> 00:02:49.433
so you can see
how the tools work.

00:02:56.367 --> 00:02:58.467
This is just a Sponge Bar
that we call these.

00:02:58.467 --> 00:03:00.233
These are in
four different shapes.

00:03:00.233 --> 00:03:01.333
There's a point,
there's a round,

00:03:01.333 --> 00:03:02.933
there's a flat,
and there's a filbert,

00:03:02.933 --> 00:03:04.533
very similar to brush shapes.

00:03:04.533 --> 00:03:07.433
It's the same shapes that the
knives are corresponding to.

00:03:07.433 --> 00:03:08.633
I'm going to just
dip this in water.

00:03:08.633 --> 00:03:10.233
You'll notice that
when you dip it in water,

00:03:10.233 --> 00:03:12.200
the water doesn't
absorb to the sponge,

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:13.933
it's called hydrophobic,

00:03:13.933 --> 00:03:16.900
and it basically
repels water slightly.

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:24.000
I'm going to go to the wet
on wet surface here.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.533
And you can see you get
some similar marks to a brush,

00:03:27.533 --> 00:03:30.000
however there's no
brush strokes at all,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.200
and what's really
nice about this is

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.967
by angling the tool slightly,

00:03:33.967 --> 00:03:36.433
you can actually go in
and almost erase

00:03:36.433 --> 00:03:37.767
or push some of the paint

00:03:37.767 --> 00:03:43.333
to create some defined
definitions and highlights.

00:03:43.333 --> 00:03:45.133
Next thing I'm going to do is
go in with a different colour

00:03:45.133 --> 00:03:48.500
on a dry surface,

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:50.133
so you can see
how that works.

00:03:59.967 --> 00:04:03.633
You get a little bit more
opaque mark making.

00:04:03.633 --> 00:04:05.967
The watercolour can be
controlled a bit more

00:04:05.967 --> 00:04:08.933
like tube watercolour
straight off the pan.

00:04:13.633 --> 00:04:15.400
And then again just by adding
a little bit of water to it

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:19.767
you can loosen up the surface,
move the material around.

00:04:19.767 --> 00:04:22.033
The edge of the tool
works great like a squeegee.

00:04:22.033 --> 00:04:24.633
It almost cuts the material
off of the surface.

00:04:24.633 --> 00:04:26.800
The other tools,
the other PanPastel

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:30.100
and Sofft Tools you can
use the edges of those

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:32.133
and do some experimenting
for gestural marks

00:04:32.133 --> 00:04:33.733
by rolling the tools
left to right.

00:04:33.733 --> 00:04:37.767
It really works sort of
like an absorbent finger,

00:04:37.767 --> 00:04:40.233
and with charcoal pencil,

00:04:40.233 --> 00:04:43.367
this is just a standard
charcoal pencil.

00:04:43.367 --> 00:04:45.333
One of the things that's great
with the tools

00:04:45.333 --> 00:04:50.000
is you can use it for softening
and blending the lines.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.833
I'm going to just take
a Number One knife here,

00:04:52.833 --> 00:04:55.200
again with the foam
cover on top,

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:58.867
and I'm going to roll it over
and just use the edge of it,

00:04:58.867 --> 00:05:04.067
and you can really get in
and do some nice detailed work

00:05:04.067 --> 00:05:07.733
with the charcoal.

00:05:07.733 --> 00:05:10.733
Again also if you want to
block in a larger area

00:05:10.733 --> 00:05:15.733
you can lay down
a larger area of charcoal

00:05:15.733 --> 00:05:18.533
and then use
the Sofft Knives

00:05:18.533 --> 00:05:23.733
for smoothing
and blending those.

00:05:23.733 --> 00:05:25.933
The foam's really nice because
it's a little bit forgiving,

00:05:25.933 --> 00:05:28.333
so it's not a hard
surface to work with,

00:05:28.333 --> 00:05:29.233
you have a little bit
of bounce

00:05:29.233 --> 00:05:30.867
and a little bit of forgiveness

00:05:30.867 --> 00:05:32.867
when you're working
with the material.

00:05:32.867 --> 00:05:35.633
That's it for the demonstration
on the Sofft Tools,

00:05:35.633 --> 00:05:36.800
I hope you
enjoyed them,

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:39.000
please try them with PanPastel
and some other mediums.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.400
Thanks very much.

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:46.500
