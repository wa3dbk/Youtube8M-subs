Hey soccer fans, this is Matt from SoccerPro.com.

00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:10.530
Today I'm here with a brand new line of
Warrior soccer cleats called the Skreamer

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:15.059
and they're something sharp and something new from a brand new soccer company.

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.840
Now first up we've got their kangaroo
leather classic style soccer boot. Now

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:23.660
this is called they're Warrior Skreamer K-Lite firm ground and as we go around

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:27.840
the outside there you can see it's a
sharp looking classically styled boot.

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.849
Particularly love the warrior logo on
the side there.

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:35.580
It's a little raised up, nice bright red against the black looks really good.

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:39.380
Now, you'll notice that the upper on these shoes is kangaroo leather. Now this is the best

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:42.959
leather you can get on a pair of soccer shoes in terms of fit and ball touch

00:00:42.959 --> 00:00:47.069
and its really just something smart and something special they've done. You don't see a lot

00:00:47.069 --> 00:00:49.949
of kangaroo leather boots out there anymore and I'm really glad to see that

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:51.670
on these shoes.

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:55.020
Now I tried these on, ran around in them a
little bit and they're very very

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.850
comfortable. The main reason being

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:01.780
the really nice beautiful insole that Warrior put
in these shoes

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:06.220
and the thorax frame that runs around them. It works sorta like and adidas

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:08.990
sprint frame in the sense it gives the boot shape, helps it

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:13.469
hold its shape and also helps it fit to your foot along with those nice sturdy lace holes right

00:01:13.469 --> 00:01:14.740
there on the top.

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.380
I didn't have any heel slippage. It's a truly
comfortable shoe and no complaints

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:19.450
there.

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:23.540
As we move on down to the bottom you can
see a really unique cleat pattern that features

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:28.600
sort of a claw design that I really enjoyed. The four back cleats on the heel keep it

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:33.710
stable and the patterning of the shoe's cleats on the fore foot allows your to kind of

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:37.510
cut or run quickly in any direction which is something that's really lacking in

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:40.660
some other shoes in the market with rounded cleats these days.

00:01:40.660 --> 00:01:45.910
Other than that, these really are a great pair of shoes. The insole itself is just incredibly

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:46.850
comfortable

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:50.399
and if you're looking at the bottom
there, you'll notice that its carbon fiber and its

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:53.409
also got the same Pebax renu

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:56.979
that Nike are using right now on their GS line of soccer shoes so its really

00:01:56.979 --> 00:02:00.530
something special and something pretty advanced.

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:07.320
Now, the next part of this line from Warrior
is the Warrior Skreamer S-Lite FG. Now

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.240
this is their synthetic shoe. The synthetic is pretty similar to what you'll

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:13.189
get on an F50 adizero.

00:02:13.189 --> 00:02:18.820
It's nice, supple, soft and I really like those patterned scales on the forefoot.

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:21.260
They're designed to give you a little bit better touch, a little bit better

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:26.109
contact and direction on the ball and they look sharp against that lighter blue.

00:02:26.109 --> 00:02:30.479
Also, the orange laces and the logos look great. It features the same sort of

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:31.609
comfort

00:02:31.609 --> 00:02:35.900
thorax frame and style that you'll get in the kangaroo leather version so you're not going to have to worry about

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:36.919
that.

00:02:36.919 --> 00:02:40.579
And the synthetic should loosen up after
one or two practices.

00:02:40.579 --> 00:02:44.289
Again, you've got the same cleat pattern on the bottom, the same carbon fiber and Pebax

00:02:44.289 --> 00:02:45.749
renu material

00:02:45.749 --> 00:02:49.439
and generally just a pretty comfortable
synthetic version of the kangaroo leather

00:02:49.439 --> 00:02:50.680
shoe.

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:51.570
Other than that,

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:54.310
they're a great pair of  boots. I definitely recommend you checking out this new
