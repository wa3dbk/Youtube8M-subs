Hi! I’m Angela Sage Larsen. On behalf of
expertvillage.com, today, we’re going to

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:14.690
talk about publishing your own children’s
story. Please visit my website at petalwinkthefairy.com.

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:19.410
Now that you have your story written, it’s
time for the editing. You’ll find yourself

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:26.230
editing, editing, reediting, and editing more.
As much as I loved my first version, this

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:34.490
is what happened when I edited my story. The
black is the original, the red are the edits.

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:38.610
So, you’re going to have to be willing to
put aside what your preconceived notions are,

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:43.440
and constantly go back to what is my main
message in the story. What am I trying to

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:50.180
say? Every word should support the main point
of your story. Now, these red edits were from

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:55.489
a friend of mine, who is actually an editor,
and he was ruthless but it’s exactly what

00:00:55.489 --> 00:01:00.670
I needed because it helped me to clarify what
the point of my story was. I didn’t necessarily

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:05.790
use all of these edits, but it helped me to
think through exactly where I wanted the story

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:11.950
to go and exactly what supported the story
and what didn’t. In editing, you’re going

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:16.890
to want to be able to put it away for a while,
stick your story in the top drawer, and not

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:21.890
think about it and not look at it for a few
days, then come back to it totally fresh and

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:27.700
be as objective as you can. Remember your
ideal reader, who is the story for and what

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:31.690
are they going to think of it when they are
reading the story. In fact, if you can’t

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:37.020
find your ideal reader, I mentioned that my
reader was myself as a six-year-old, so I

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.810
could not go back in time and read my story.
I did have some neighbor girls that were very

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:46.810
helpful. When I showed them the story, they
would say, “Well, where did Petalwink’s

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:51.250
magic wand to come from?” There are different
things in the story that I just assumed to

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:56.729
readers knew about, but the little girls,
for whom the story was written, didn’t understand

00:01:56.729 --> 00:02:02.290
certain things. That was great for the editing
process. I was able to add and delete only

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:04.200
what was useful towards the story.
