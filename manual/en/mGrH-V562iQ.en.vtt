00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:02.035
- [Ximena] Hi, we're Rainy Day Dreamers

00:00:02.035 --> 00:00:02.943
- [Parris] and we found out

00:00:02.943 --> 00:00:06.869
what $30 of play sand will
buy you, how about $5?

00:00:06.869 --> 00:00:09.206
The Royal Play Sand, we check it out.

00:00:09.206 --> 00:00:12.396
♫ Rainy Day Dreamers ♫

00:00:12.873 --> 00:00:16.055
♫ Rainy Day Dreamers ♫

00:00:16.055 --> 00:00:21.055
We picked this box of sand
up over at Five Below for $5,

00:00:21.345 --> 00:00:22.602
or maybe a little below.

00:00:22.602 --> 00:00:24.570
It says Royal on the name,

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.047
but this is definitely not
the most expensive or fanciest

00:00:27.047 --> 00:00:28.873
of these play sands.

00:00:28.873 --> 00:00:29.846
We really like these,

00:00:29.846 --> 00:00:32.505
they actually do have differences

00:00:32.505 --> 00:00:35.172
even though they do run
through your fingers like flour

00:00:35.172 --> 00:00:37.536
and you can make some things with them.

00:00:37.536 --> 00:00:39.738
Some are definitely better than others.

00:00:39.738 --> 00:00:41.875
If you're looking for this
and can't find it locally,

00:00:41.875 --> 00:00:43.540
we'll put a link to it
down below this video.

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:45.036
You like these play sands, don't you?

00:00:45.036 --> 00:00:45.599
- [Ximena] Yeah.

00:00:45.599 --> 00:00:46.551
- [Parris] They've been a lot of fun.

00:00:46.551 --> 00:00:49.587
We have our favorite so far,
which in an upcoming video

00:00:49.587 --> 00:00:51.206
we'll review them all together,

00:00:51.206 --> 00:00:55.441
but today is day for the Royal Play Sand.

00:00:56.195 --> 00:01:00.026
Now, it comes with extra sand in the box

00:01:00.026 --> 00:01:02.334
that's not inside the package.

00:01:02.334 --> 00:01:03.784
- [Ximena] It starts out
tough at the beginning.

00:01:03.784 --> 00:01:05.149
- [Parris] You have to
let it breathe, right?

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:06.861
According to the
instructions, the other one.

00:01:06.861 --> 00:01:09.665
So don't judge the sand until
it's had a chance to breathe.

00:01:09.665 --> 00:01:11.590
Well, Ximena has opened up the bag

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:13.262
to let the rest of the sand out,

00:01:13.262 --> 00:01:16.003
and we have a glass container here.

00:01:16.003 --> 00:01:18.472
Go ahead and pour it in, and let's see.

00:01:21.086 --> 00:01:24.472
Oh yeah, it's doing the stuff
like the bread dough, right?

00:01:24.472 --> 00:01:26.221
Just kinda coming apart.

00:01:30.698 --> 00:01:33.818
Crunchier on the outside,
it kinda has a crust on it.

00:01:33.818 --> 00:01:34.475
You feel that?

00:01:34.475 --> 00:01:34.895
- [Ximena] Yeah.

00:01:35.603 --> 00:01:37.281
- [Parris] Yeah, but I think
that's just a temporary thing

00:01:37.281 --> 00:01:39.554
from, I don't know, moisture or something.

00:01:39.554 --> 00:01:40.890
No, it seems pretty good.

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.799
It's turning into normal sand.

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:45.570
The thing that bothers me,

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:47.259
other than my desk is now covered

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:49.295
in tiny grains of this sand,

00:01:49.295 --> 00:01:51.480
is that this seems to do that.

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:53.345
The other sand, remember, they
would stay stuck together.

00:01:53.345 --> 00:01:56.451
You didn't have that little
pieces of sand coming off issue,

00:01:56.451 --> 00:01:58.142
and this one I can feel it on my hands,

00:01:58.142 --> 00:01:59.457
little grains of sand.

00:01:59.457 --> 00:02:00.445
The way they make this is

00:02:00.445 --> 00:02:02.282
they take this little pieces of plastic,

00:02:02.282 --> 00:02:04.558
polymer, tiny little pieces of this,

00:02:04.558 --> 00:02:06.668
and they mix it with regular sand,

00:02:06.668 --> 00:02:08.440
which is basically just rocks

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:09.786
broken down to a particular size,

00:02:09.786 --> 00:02:12.300
and somehow that combination of the two

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.954
different size pieces allows it to behave

00:02:15.954 --> 00:02:18.790
in this interesting way.

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:20.602
But even within that, you would think

00:02:20.602 --> 00:02:21.778
all these sands would be the same.

00:02:21.778 --> 00:02:23.536
There's a lot of differences.

00:02:23.536 --> 00:02:25.331
Okay, time for the smell
test, are you ready?

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:28.034
Pretty good.

00:02:28.034 --> 00:02:28.364
- [Ximena] Yeah.

00:02:28.364 --> 00:02:30.434
- [Parris] Yeah, so I remember
one of these we opened

00:02:30.434 --> 00:02:33.111
and the whole room smelled
bad for like two days.

00:02:33.111 --> 00:02:34.971
I don't remember which one that was.

00:02:34.971 --> 00:02:36.646
We'll put a link, by the way,

00:02:36.646 --> 00:02:38.097
down below this video, to the playlist

00:02:38.097 --> 00:02:40.152
where we tried out all
these different sands.

00:02:40.152 --> 00:02:44.870
Okay, let's see how well
this oozes and pours.

00:02:53.429 --> 00:02:54.390
What do you think?

00:02:55.424 --> 00:02:56.459
You're having trouble getting it

00:02:56.459 --> 00:02:58.290
to run through the fingers, huh?

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:00.495
Hmm, this sand feels,

00:03:00.495 --> 00:03:02.576
I don't know another word
for it, I would say drier.

00:03:02.576 --> 00:03:04.194
Do you think it feels that way?

00:03:04.194 --> 00:03:05.411
- [Ximena] Yeah.
- [Parris] It feels drier

00:03:05.411 --> 00:03:07.332
and it feels like the little...

00:03:07.332 --> 00:03:09.783
That's why those little
individual sand grains

00:03:09.783 --> 00:03:11.692
keep coming off sticking to my fingers

00:03:11.692 --> 00:03:15.382
and I guess came loose in the
box and are now on the desk.

00:03:15.382 --> 00:03:17.608
Now let's see, once we've made a shape

00:03:17.608 --> 00:03:18.900
or an object with the sand,

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.101
how long it holds together
before it oozes out.

00:03:22.101 --> 00:03:25.167
Now this is pretty good, this
is really holding the shape.

00:03:25.167 --> 00:03:26.747
A lot of the other sands

00:03:26.747 --> 00:03:29.444
would already have been
pouring out of my hand by now.

00:03:29.444 --> 00:03:32.368
So that's one strength of this sand,

00:03:32.368 --> 00:03:34.559
is if you're looking to
make some shapes with it,

00:03:34.559 --> 00:03:36.765
it looks like it will
hold together for a while

00:03:36.765 --> 00:03:38.307
Oh, there it goes.

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:42.794
I guess I'm hungry 'cause I
haven't eaten this morning,

00:03:42.794 --> 00:03:44.134
but I appear to have made a Twinkie.

00:03:44.134 --> 00:03:45.873
(laughs)

00:03:45.873 --> 00:03:47.541
I was going for skyscraper.

00:03:47.541 --> 00:03:49.650
I wanted Ximena to stand it up on end

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:51.131
and see how long it stays together,

00:03:51.131 --> 00:03:52.432
and she's made something
that will get took.

00:03:52.432 --> 00:03:54.242
Put mine up on end and we'll see.

00:03:54.242 --> 00:03:55.963
Oh, it's just gonna fall over.

00:03:55.963 --> 00:03:58.792
That's still pretty good that
it's maintaining its shape.

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:01.880
See, now this is much
better than the other sands

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:03.530
for making obejcts, don't you think?

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:04.343
- [Ximena] Yeah.

00:04:04.343 --> 00:04:04.839
- [Parris] The others ones

00:04:04.839 --> 00:04:06.273
would never stay together like that.

00:04:06.995 --> 00:04:08.259
(laughs)

00:04:08.259 --> 00:04:09.728
Even if it is unbalanced.

00:04:09.728 --> 00:04:10.657
Well, that's me too.

00:04:10.657 --> 00:04:11.938
- [Ximena] Unbalanced Twinkie.

00:04:11.938 --> 00:04:12.589
- [Parris] Yes.

00:04:12.589 --> 00:04:13.636
Were you gonna stand yours up?

00:04:13.636 --> 00:04:14.724
- [Ximena] Oh yeah.

00:04:14.724 --> 00:04:16.091
I think I made a refrigerator.

00:04:16.091 --> 00:04:18.178
- [Parris] A refrigerator, okay.

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:20.757
Hey, that's good, and it stands there.

00:04:21.788 --> 00:04:23.458
And you know what you could
keep in that refrigerator?

00:04:24.442 --> 00:04:25.173
Some Twinkies.

00:04:25.173 --> 00:04:26.806
(laughs)

00:04:26.806 --> 00:04:29.999
This is really good for making
objects, don't you think?

00:04:29.999 --> 00:04:31.503
Much better than the other.

00:04:31.503 --> 00:04:34.901
Alright, Ximena, go ahead,
crush it back into a blob.

00:04:34.901 --> 00:04:37.061
Amorphous blob.

00:04:38.553 --> 00:04:41.043
No, thank you, not the sand in the hair.

00:04:41.043 --> 00:04:42.599
Even with what little hair there is

00:04:42.599 --> 00:04:44.207
it'll be in there all day long.

00:04:44.207 --> 00:04:46.445
I think this may be the least expensive

00:04:46.445 --> 00:04:48.038
of these play sands we've tried.

00:04:48.038 --> 00:04:51.445
For $5 it's 14 ounces,
just under a pound of sand.

00:04:51.445 --> 00:04:52.616
What's your impression of it?

00:04:52.616 --> 00:04:56.068
- [Ximena] It's actually one
of the better sands we've done.

00:04:56.068 --> 00:04:57.139
- [Parris] Okay.

00:04:57.139 --> 00:04:59.909
In some ways I would agree
that that's true, yes.

00:04:59.909 --> 00:05:02.609
- [Ximena] Instead of,
like, the Squishy Sand.

00:05:02.609 --> 00:05:04.553
- [Parris] Yeah, the
Squishy Sand, that's the one

00:05:04.553 --> 00:05:06.711
we remembered, I think,
that had the strong smell.

00:05:06.711 --> 00:05:09.208
- [Ximena] And it got stuck to the thing,

00:05:09.208 --> 00:05:10.837
I mean you couldn't even brush it away.

00:05:10.837 --> 00:05:12.402
- [Parris] Hmm.
- [Ximena] It got everywhere.

00:05:12.402 --> 00:05:12.843
- [Parris] Right.

00:05:12.843 --> 00:05:16.844
This is a good one,
especially if you like molding

00:05:16.844 --> 00:05:18.931
and making things, it'll
keep the shape for a while.

00:05:18.931 --> 00:05:20.326
Some of them the stuff, I mean,

00:05:20.326 --> 00:05:22.370
you can't even make a
square and before you finish

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:24.342
it starts falling apart, so.

00:05:24.342 --> 00:05:26.556
But some people like that,
some people like the sand

00:05:26.556 --> 00:05:27.175
that you hold it

00:05:27.175 --> 00:05:29.425
and it immediately starts to
ooze through your fingers.

00:05:29.425 --> 00:05:32.675
This one doesn't do the oozing very fast.

00:05:32.675 --> 00:05:35.504
One of its strongest
points has to be its price.

00:05:35.504 --> 00:05:38.669
For just $5 you can try
out this kind of sand,

00:05:38.669 --> 00:05:41.008
see if you like it, if the
kids don't take care of it,

00:05:41.008 --> 00:05:42.959
put it away, well you're
not out a lot of money.

00:05:42.959 --> 00:05:45.650
The Brookstone sand, for nearly $30,

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:48.206
you'd be a little bit
upset if they lose that one

00:05:48.206 --> 00:05:49.178
or it ends up in the trash.

00:05:49.178 --> 00:05:51.284
And Ximena was just telling
me she had a thought

00:05:51.284 --> 00:05:53.340
about kids who really want
to buy this themselves.

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:53.883
What was that?

00:05:53.883 --> 00:05:58.295
- [Ximena] Yeah, this is
actually really good sand,

00:05:58.295 --> 00:06:01.336
and if your parents won't buy
it for you, it's cheap enough

00:06:01.336 --> 00:06:02.800
that you can probably buy it for yourself.

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:03.975
- [Parris] Those mean old parents,

00:06:03.975 --> 00:06:05.186
they won't buy you some sand.

00:06:05.186 --> 00:06:07.434
You can buy your own sand, so.

00:06:07.434 --> 00:06:09.693
Now the thing with this sand,
both for adults and for kids,

00:06:09.693 --> 00:06:13.613
it has the quality of relaxing you.

00:06:13.613 --> 00:06:14.639
Adults buy it,

00:06:14.639 --> 00:06:17.392
that's why they buy the
fancy Brookstone sand.

00:06:17.392 --> 00:06:18.427
You have it in your office

00:06:18.427 --> 00:06:19.926
and if you're having a bad day,

00:06:19.926 --> 00:06:21.714
just playing with this,
you'll notice Ximena

00:06:21.714 --> 00:06:23.801
just does not stop playing with the sand,

00:06:23.801 --> 00:06:26.040
'cause there's something
about it that's just relaxing.

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:27.226
I always do that when I go to the beach,

00:06:27.226 --> 00:06:30.375
I just can't stop playing
with the sand, and it's nice.

00:06:30.375 --> 00:06:33.597
Now kids, of course,
need some relaxation too.

00:06:33.597 --> 00:06:35.764
So it provides that, but the sand

00:06:35.764 --> 00:06:38.016
is also similar in some ways to the putty,

00:06:38.016 --> 00:06:40.852
like the Crazy Arron's
Thinking Putty that we like.

00:06:40.852 --> 00:06:43.131
They actually use this in school with kids

00:06:43.131 --> 00:06:45.168
who have trouble focusing on reading

00:06:45.168 --> 00:06:47.532
or other things in class, having,

00:06:47.532 --> 00:06:50.699
thank you, this will help
me doing the video here,

00:06:50.699 --> 00:06:55.034
that it helps you to keep
your focus on one thing

00:06:55.034 --> 00:06:57.969
by giving part of your
mind something else to do.

00:06:57.969 --> 00:06:59.470
So for kids who have some of those issues,

00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:00.984
it's certainly worth giving this a try.

00:07:00.984 --> 00:07:04.763
The downside of this sand
is now it is everywhere.

00:07:04.763 --> 00:07:06.318
There are grains of
sand all over the desk,

00:07:06.318 --> 00:07:08.111
probably on my clothes, and--

00:07:08.111 --> 00:07:10.521
- [Ximena] I had just like
one or two grains on me.

00:07:10.521 --> 00:07:13.444
- [Parris] Okay, well it sticks
to me for whatever reason.

00:07:13.444 --> 00:07:15.650
And the other sands, we found,

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:17.022
it tends to stick to itself

00:07:17.022 --> 00:07:18.781
and it doesn't come off everywhere else,

00:07:18.781 --> 00:07:21.113
so if that sort of a cleanup issue

00:07:21.113 --> 00:07:22.712
is something you're concerned about,

00:07:22.712 --> 00:07:24.220
you might want to try
one of the other sands.

00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:26.555
Ximena and I both like
the Royal Play Sand.

00:07:26.555 --> 00:07:27.901
It's a really good deal for the price.

00:07:27.901 --> 00:07:31.953
We will be back soon
with a followup review

00:07:31.953 --> 00:07:34.773
of all the sands that we have tried out,

00:07:34.773 --> 00:07:37.835
and we'll tell you their
good points and weaker points

00:07:37.835 --> 00:07:39.235
and which are our personal favorites.

00:07:39.235 --> 00:07:40.643
