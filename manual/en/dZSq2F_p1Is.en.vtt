How to Make a Wallet from a Computer Keyboard.

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:10.720
Don't throw away that old keyboard!

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:13.500
You can make a sweet wallet with the circuit
sheets inside!

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.900
Inspired by an Instructables.com project:
http://www.instructables.com/id/Wallet-made-from-a-computer-keyboard/

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:25.720
You will need A desktop computer keyboard,
preferably a PC A screwdriver A ruler or tape

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:37.660
measure Scissors An Allen wrench and a razor
blade.

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:38.660
Step 1.

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:45.390
Flip the keyboard over, and unscrew the screws
holding it together.

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:48.790
Remove the top of the keyboard from the bottom.

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:54.790
PC keyboards work best, since you can open
most of them with a Phillips-head screwdriver.

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:59.270
Macs generally require a tiny Allen wrench
that can be hard to find.

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:00.520
Step 2.

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.160
Unscrew the circuit board, and remove it.

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:04.699
Peel off the sheet of rubber key springs.

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:11.430
If the rubber key springs are attached individually
to the circuit sheets, remove each one carefully

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.890
with a razor blade.

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.140
Step 3.

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.070
Carefully remove the circuit sheets, and gently
pull them apart.

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:22.420
You'll usually find two circuit sheets, and
they may be glued together at a few small

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:23.479
points.

00:01:23.479 --> 00:01:25.619
Step 4.

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:31.240
Using a pen, ruler, and scissors, measure,
mark and cut out four pieces of the circuit

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.859
sheets that are 3-by-4 inches each.

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:39.060
Make sure that no circuit sheet holes run
along the edge of any rectangles.

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.849
Then, cut out two more pieces, this time making
them 3-by-3 inches each.

00:01:44.849 --> 00:01:46.259
Step 5.

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:50.939
Cut a 6-inch piece of tape and lay it out
vertically, sticky side up.

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:52.049
Step 6.

00:01:52.049 --> 00:01:56.369
Place the 3-inch edge of one of the larger
circuit sheets horizontally onto the tape,

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:58.310
4 inches from the top of the tape.

00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:03.109
Then place the edge of a second 3-by-4-inch
circuit sheet onto the tape next to the first,

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:06.149
leaving a one-eighth inch gap between the
two sheets.

00:02:06.149 --> 00:02:07.149
Step 7.

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:10.600
The sides of the circuit sheet that you want
on the outside of the wallet should be the

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.760
sides stuck against the tape.

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:21.020
Fold the two ends of the tape toward each
other and press down.

00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:22.020
Step 8.

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:26.569
Repeat with another piece of tape and the
other two 3-by-4-inch circuit sheets.

00:02:26.569 --> 00:02:32.519
You have now assembled the two pieces of the
wallet that will hold bills.

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:33.519
Step 9.

00:02:33.519 --> 00:02:37.670
Stack these pieces on top of each other, with
the insides of the wallet facing each other.

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:39.770
Cut two 3-inch pieces of tape.

00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:43.980
Place a piece of tape along the edge of each
3-inch end and fold it over.

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.280
Trim off any excess.

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.099
You've now sealed shut the wallet's flaps.

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:54.540
If the adhesive side of the tape is exposed
through holes in the circuit sheets, cut pieces

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:59.390
of tape the same size, and stick them to the
exposed tape inside the wallet.

00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:00.670
Step 10.

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:04.680
Seal the bottom by folding the wallet, and
sticking a 9-inch piece of tape along the

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:05.739
bottom edge.

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:07.749
Make sure the tape does not stick to itself.

00:03:07.749 --> 00:03:11.560
Open the wallet, and fold the piece of tape
up to seal the bottom.

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:18.829
Trim off any excess tape at the ends.

00:03:18.829 --> 00:03:20.040
Step 11.

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:24.290
Place the 3-by-3 inch circuit sheets on the
inside the wallet, flush with the bottom left

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:28.580
and right corners, and tape them in place
along the outside edges with a 4-inch piece

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:29.580
of tape.

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:35.620
Fold the tape over to seal, and trim the excess.

00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:36.709
Step 12.

00:03:36.709 --> 00:03:40.390
Add four pieces of tape for the top and bottom
edges of the card slots.

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:46.330
Only the inside edges should remain open.

00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:47.640
Step 13.

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:51.639
Cut the top two pieces of tape at an angle
to keep the corners from becoming bulky.

00:03:51.639 --> 00:03:56.189
Then, fold the tape over into the cash slot
of the wallet.

00:03:56.189 --> 00:04:00.159
On the bottom, cut both pieces of tape at
an angle to keep the edge of the tape away

00:04:00.159 --> 00:04:03.239
from the wallet corner, where it will be prone
to peeling.

00:04:03.239 --> 00:04:07.319
Fold the rest of the tape over to finish securing
the card slots.

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:08.549
Step 14.

00:04:08.549 --> 00:04:11.629
Add your items to the wallet, and you're done!

00:04:11.629 --> 00:04:17.560
Did you know The history of the keyboard dates
back to the first typewriter, which New York-based

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:23.280
Remington Co. mass-marketed in 1877 to compensate
for the drop in gun sales after the Civil

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:27.500
War.
