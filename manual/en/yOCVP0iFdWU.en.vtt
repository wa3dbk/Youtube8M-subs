Female Speaker: West Wing
Week says zot, zot, zot.

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:04.533
Narrator: Welcome to
the West Wing Week,

00:00:04.533 --> 00:00:05.767
your guide to everything
that's happening

00:00:05.767 --> 00:00:08.367
at 1600 Pennsylvania
Avenue and beyond --

00:00:08.367 --> 00:00:10.667
The President: Zot, zot, zot.

00:00:14.433 --> 00:00:15.300
(applause)

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:19.200

Narrator: President Obama
started this West Wing Week

00:00:23.633 --> 00:00:26.333
in South Lawn, where he
discussed how the United States

00:00:26.333 --> 00:00:29.467
would support Iraq's
efforts to fight extremists

00:00:29.467 --> 00:00:31.567
who are threatening to
overrun their country.

00:00:31.567 --> 00:00:33.533
That said, the president
was also clear about what

00:00:33.533 --> 00:00:34.533
we would not do.

00:00:34.533 --> 00:00:38.667
The President: The United States
is not simply going to involve

00:00:38.667 --> 00:00:41.200
itself in a military action in
the absence of a political plan

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:44.533
by the Iraqis that gives us some
assurance that they're

00:00:44.533 --> 00:00:45.667
prepared to work together.

00:00:45.667 --> 00:00:47.400
Narrator: The president
then boarded Marine One,

00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.300
to mark the first leg of a
three-day trip out west.

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.734
First up was the Standing
Rock Indian Reservation

00:00:52.734 --> 00:00:54.700
in North Dakota, where the President channeled

00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:56.934
the words of Standing Rock's most famous resident,

00:00:56.934 --> 00:00:59.967
Chief Sitting Bull, to urge all Americans to work together

00:00:59.967 --> 00:01:03.000
for the benefit of future
generations of Native Americans.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.266
The President: So let's
put our minds together,

00:01:05.266 --> 00:01:08.567
to build more economic
opportunity in Indian country.

00:01:08.567 --> 00:01:11.433
Let's put our minds together
to improve our schools,

00:01:11.433 --> 00:01:15.367
because our children deserve a
world-class education, too --

00:01:15.367 --> 00:01:16.633
(applause)

00:01:16.633 --> 00:01:18.900
The President: That prepares them for college and careers.

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.100
Narrator: On Saturday, the
president made his way

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:24.667
to the city and the home of the Angels,
to give the commencing address

00:01:24.667 --> 00:01:27.200
for the University of
California, Irvine.

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.900
There, he urged the anteater
class of 2014 to continue

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.367
working on one of the biggest
threats in the world,

00:01:33.367 --> 00:01:35.967
climate change, and to refuse
to be daunted by the work

00:01:35.967 --> 00:01:36.667
that that may entail.

00:01:36.667 --> 00:01:37.700
The President:
Hope is the belief,

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.700
against all evidence
to the contrary,

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:42.266
that there are better days
ahead, and that together,

00:01:42.266 --> 00:01:45.166
we can build up a middle class,
and reshape our immigration

00:01:45.166 --> 00:01:48.400
system, and shield our children
from gun violence and shelter

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:52.300
future generations from the
ravages of climate change.

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:57.467
Hope is the fact that today,
the single largest age group

00:01:57.467 --> 00:02:02.367
in America is 22 year-olds who
are all just itching to reshape

00:02:02.367 --> 00:02:04.734
this country and reshape the
world, and I cannot wait

00:02:04.734 --> 00:02:06.233
to see what you do tomorrow.

00:02:06.233 --> 00:02:06.934

The President: Corporal William
Kyle Carpenter should not

00:04:26.867 --> 00:04:29.500
be alive today, but the fact
that he is gives us reason

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:34.066
to trust that there is,
indeed, a bigger plan.

00:04:34.066 --> 00:04:35.066
God bless, you Kyle.
