00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.480
We are testing Australia-wide.

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:06.640
Anyone doing safety-sensitive
aviation activities

00:00:06.640 --> 00:00:09.000
includes anything
from pilots to cabin crew,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.320
also looking at
maintenance engineers,

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:14.120
also ground baggage handlers,

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:16.400
so anyone that really has
a safety sort of aspect

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.120
to the aviation industry

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:20.480
and anyone who works airside.

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:23.840
MAN: Important thing with alcohol
is it's a part of society,

00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:25.640
and the thing
with alcohol, therefore,

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:27.520
is to use it in a safe manner.

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:29.440
And alcohol can be
impairing to safety,

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:31.400
both because
it's still in your system,

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:35.600
so your blood alcohol is above 0.

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.800
For driving, as we know,
the limit is .05.

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.040
For aviation,
it's essentially 0, or .02,

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:44.360
which allows for
cough medicines and other things

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:47.960
that may just nudge it above 0,
but .02 is essentially 0.

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.160
The other part of it
is to make sure

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.920
that there are no other
adverse effects of alcohol, so...

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.800
Even when alcohol's
out of your system,

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.680
you can still be
significantly impaired

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.360
from the effects of hangover
the following day.

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.200
So if somebody has had
a big night on alcohol,

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.680
then they probably
are not going to be fit to operate

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.680
in safety-sensitive duties
the following day,

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.360
regardless of whether their
blood alcohol level has approached 0.

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:13.880
The other thing that happens
is people underestimate

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:18.160
the amount of time it takes for
alcohol to be out of their system.

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:21.600
Essentially, alcohol is eliminated
from the body at a constant rate.

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.400
And so therefore, depending on
how late the person drank

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.400
and how much they drank, it could be
well into the following day,

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.800
even as far as the next evening,

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.080
before the alcohol
is out of their system.

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.920
Many prescription medicines
and even over-the-counter medicines

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:38.120
can be impairing to performance.

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:40.080
People may not be aware of them.

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:44.520
For example, two of the more commonly
used medicines that are impairing

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.520
and that are commonly tested for
in drug and alcohol programs,

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:49.120
number one, is codeine.

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:51.360
So codeine's
in the opiate family,

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.480
the same family
as heroin and morphine.

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:56.160
As most people would be aware,

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:59.280
it can either be
in strong painkilling medications,

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.040
things like Panadeine Forte.

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.080
If you need
strong painkillers,

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:06.400
number one, the condition for which
you're taking your medicine for

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:09.520
is probably means
that you're not fit to work anyway,

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:12.720
and then secondly, the codeine, the
strong codeine, in those medicines

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.000
are also likely to be impairing,
leading to people being sleepy,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.040
and that's why
a lot of the packages talk about

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.360
not doing safety-type events
like climbing ladders,

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:25.560
driving and operating machinery
or driving heavy vehicles.

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.680
So codeine in strong painkillers,

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:29.680
you're probably
not fit to be at work,

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.520
and you need to make sure you have
that discussion with your supervisor.

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:35.440
Then there are the mild painkillers
that contain codeine,

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:38.840
the Plus-type medications -
Nurofen Plus, Aspalgins -

00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:41.560
and they've got a smaller amount
of codeine in them,

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:46.160
generally somewhere
between 6mg to 9mg.

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.680
Most of the evidence suggests
that those types of painkillers

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:53.640
are really no more efficacious
than basic paracetamol.

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:58.760
So if you have got mild pain,
you're better off taking paracetamol

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:00.640
and avoiding
the codeine-containing medications,

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:03.800
number one, because they can
still be impairing,

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:06.760
and number two, because they can lead
to a positive drug test

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:10.200
on your organisational program
or the CASA testing program.

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.640
So the advice is to avoid

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:13.360
codeine-containing medications
altogether.

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:17.520
The second group of medications
that are potentially impairing

00:03:17.520 --> 00:03:20.760
and that also are tested for
in drug and alcohol programs

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.760
are the benzodiazepines.

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:26.400
They're also sleeping medications
such as temazepam, Rohypnol,

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.520
diazepam, valium -
those types of medications.

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:31.560
Again, they can lead
to significant impairments,

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.680
sleepiness, mistakes,
lack of concentration

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.440
and, of course, are not compatible
with a safety-sensitive role

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:41.080
if they're still in the system.

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:44.880
So, with those medications, you need
to take advice from your doctor

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:47.520
in relation to how long
after taking the medication

00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:51.400
you can then work in
a safety-sensitive aviation activity.
