I am Kelsey Mays for cars dot com

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:16.139
BMW Performance fans have been waiting
for m3 ever since the 6th generation 3

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:18.770
Series Sedan hit dealerships in early
2012

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:22.330
well here we are at the 2014 North
American International Auto Show in

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:22.960
Detroit

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:26.650
with the redesigned m3 alongside new m4

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:30.760
that's related to the 4-series which is
the new successor to the 3-series coupe

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:33.859
let's check it out so at the important
stuff

00:00:33.859 --> 00:00:37.519
nor v8 in the m3 and m4 there's now a
turbo inline

00:00:37.519 --> 00:00:44.519
6 but it makes 425 horsepower 5570 300
rpm in 406 pound-feet of torque

00:00:44.589 --> 00:00:47.659
at just 18 50 rpm that compares

00:00:47.659 --> 00:00:52.719
to the b8 which made 414 horsepower and
a sky-high 8300 rpm

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:56.629
and only 295 pound-feet of torque at
3900 rpm

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:01.549
what's more the cars about 175 pounds
lighter than compare bill m3 coupe BMW

00:01:01.549 --> 00:01:02.219
says

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:06.049
and that car was already kinda flyway in
its class about 100 to 300 pounds

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:06.590
lighter

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:10.630
in the Audi rs5 in the outgoing mercedes
c 63 AMG

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:15.920
as we expect the M cars have imposing
designs here a lot of Hawking bodywork

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:17.469
the kinda wraps around the end up he
says

00:01:17.469 --> 00:01:21.210
there's frontal air curtains that help
redirect airflow around the side of the

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:21.640
car

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.729
unfortunately those don't come with
frontal the nation blinds

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:27.840
but there is a lot love weight reduction
material your

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.960
carbon fiber reinforced plastic the
automaker says that the same material

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:35.240
used in large part at the I ate supercar

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:38.659
you come along the back here there's
quad exhaust pipes in the back

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:42.030
that should be familiar to anybody whose
seen the m3 before

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.380
there's a rear spoil your that
integrated into the coop

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:48.460
eat sedan the m3 sedan actually has its
own kinda

00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:53.149
unique spoil your to increase downforce
transmissions include a seven-speed

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:56.039
dual-clutch automatic or a good
old-fashioned 6-speed manual

00:01:56.039 --> 00:01:58.100
transmission which we like to see remain

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.979
in performance cars any performance car
maker always references

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:05.399
laps taken at Germany's famous
Nurburgring circuit in terms of product

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:05.939
development

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:09.150
BMW says the m3 imports but thousands of
laps

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:12.950
on that circuit so take that auto
industry 0-60

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:17.500
is about or second BMW says for the m3
and m4 that significantly quicker

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:21.380
than the outgoing m3 and it's about a
half-second quicker than the outgoing

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:24.780
mercedes c 63 AMG and Audi RS 5

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.790
pretty significant when you're talking
only about four seconds

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:32.280
fuel consumption as well about 25
percent better than it used to be BMW

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.660
says

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:35.490
that's a good thing because the last
entry was such a gas guzzler that you

00:02:35.490 --> 00:02:36.160
had to pay

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.970
a gas guzzler tax for here's hoping that
the new one will avoid that the three

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:42.780
series and forces coming available

00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:46.160
m-sport packages which include things
like a different steering wheel

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.730
Morsi bolstering the actual m3 and the
m4

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:53.630
get even more seat bolstering user very
very sporty seats they hold you in very

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:54.310
tightly

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:57.850
others also things like stitching here
along the lower part to the dashboard

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:02.740
new m3 and m4 go on sale sometime this
summer they will face stiff competition

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:06.490
Mercedes just redesigned the c-class
there certainly be an AMG version that

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:07.060
will follow

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:10.100
Lexus just debuted new RC F and

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:14.300
there's a cat-like ATSB in the rumor
mill last m3 was one of those ballots

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:15.520
sports cars you could get

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:19.100
so the new one has big shoes to fill
that being said the current

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:22.770
3 Series Sedan is already one cars that
comes forty-six thousand dollars sport

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:23.820
sedan challenge so

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:29.550
we think that's a pretty good pedigree
to start from the
