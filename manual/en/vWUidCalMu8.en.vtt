00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:18.560
I'm Borre Akkersdijk

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:24.100
I graduated at the Design Academy and 
the first thing you'd say is that i'm a designer,

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:29.000
because i work with materials. I do 
work with several materials, not only fabrics.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.200
That's why i wouldn't call myself a fashion designer.

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:37.500
I don't purchase fabrics and i'm not good
at drawing patterns, from which i create clothes.

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.500
I want to do the whole research. 
So i stand beside the machine with yarns.

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:48.000
I see myself more as a researcher.

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.800
From the resulting materials, we 
create things. In that sense i'm a designer.

00:00:54.900 --> 00:01:04.300
It's hard to say what i'm most proud of, but The 
First Cycle was the first time that everything became clear.

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:11.500
Without aiming at it, this made the 
circle literally complete for the first time.

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:23.900
I draw the inspiration from daily life, but i think that a lot of inspiration comes from the machines and when we are working with them.

00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:32.200
People think that innovation means creating something 
entirely new, but for me it means really looking at things.

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:37.600
And i know WANT and i know that there are a lot of gadgets around,

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:44.600
and i think that without being really technical and able 
to create new things, you could use things in different ways.

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:52.400
So i think you should surprise yourself. You
don't need to be a genius to do new and fun things.

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:58.100
I think that it's mostly trying everything in 
every possible way and then new things just arise.

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:08.300
I think that the machines at ByBorre 
are very important and a part of the team.

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:12.800
When we are working with the
machine the machine litteraly works with us.

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.100
Cause we don't know exactly what 
will happen when we insert different color and types of yarn.

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:20.200
When something goes wrong we learn from that.

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:28.600
So i think that the machine is a part of the team 
and works together with us rather than doing things for us.

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:47.100
Where i'm sitting on now is the basis of 
the first clothing pieces i've made and

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:49.700
the first technique we've developed with the circular knitting machine.

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:52.500
This will all be scarfs.

00:02:52.940 --> 00:03:00.000
You can see the patterns, which we've set
today in the circular knitting machine.

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:03.100
That's the pattern of the scarfs.

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:12.500
We loaded that pattern into the machine after
which we chose the colors for the front and back.

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.400
Here you see the different parts.

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:22.900
Knitted and also knitted parts that are attached to the 
back. When we cut this open we can see the colors on the inside.

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:25.200
Look.

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:30.500
Now we see the fluorescent side.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.200
This side is fluor and yellow.

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:45.800
Today we switched the colors to see how we
can create gradients and how to use optical mixing,

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:59.300
which is mixing standard color red, yellow and blue yarn in 
different assemblies after which they optically seem different.

00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:05.400
You can see it here, you can see a lot more and 
different colors in the scarf then you saw on the cone.

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:14.160
Now i'm gonna cut a scarf and 
finish it off which will be for you guys, right?
