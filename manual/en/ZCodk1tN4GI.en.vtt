00:00:05.012 --> 00:00:12.039
Electrostatics need special rooms, they need tall ceilings and need to be so far away from the walls.

00:00:12.039 --> 00:00:16.034
Actually you don't need big, tall ceilings or a big room.

00:00:16.034 --> 00:00:22.072
Because of controlled dispersion, we're capable of sounding great in any size room, even smaller rooms.

00:00:22.072 --> 00:00:25.014
Electrostatic speakers need expensive tube amps,

00:00:25.014 --> 00:00:28.039
and I can't just use my normal receiver.

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:29.043
No, not true.

00:00:29.043 --> 00:00:33.040
With some of our older product, it was more power hungry than the products we currently make.

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:36.019
However, the majority of people that use our product

00:00:36.019 --> 00:00:39.028
actually use a receiver instead of a large amplifier.

00:00:39.028 --> 00:00:43.040
It's certainly an option if that's what you like, but definitely not required.

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:49.034
I don't want electrostatics, they wear out and sound bad after just a few years!

00:00:49.077 --> 00:00:53.033
Like any high-end product you purchase, you do want to take proper care of them.

00:00:53.033 --> 00:00:55.000
That means don't smoke around them

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.023
don't let them get dusty, don't leave them in a dirty environment.

00:00:58.023 --> 00:01:03.008
You want to take care of them like you would any fine piece of furniture or art you invest in.

00:01:03.008 --> 00:01:08.027
As far as longevity goes, the stat panel will have a long life expectancy

00:01:08.027 --> 00:01:13.098
and should last as long, if not longer, than any traditional dome or cone based system.

00:01:13.098 --> 00:01:21.020
My friend the audiophile says the panels are fragile and break easily.

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:23.066
Electrostatic speakers are NOT fragile.

00:01:23.066 --> 00:01:28.058
As you can see they can take a lot more abuse than a conventional dome driver or dynamic driver.

00:01:28.058 --> 00:01:30.058
As far overpowering, they are almost indestructible.

00:01:30.058 --> 00:01:33.032
You'll lose many other things long before an electrostatic speaker.

00:01:33.032 --> 00:01:35.038
So fragile, they are not.

00:01:35.038 --> 00:01:39.030
I hear they need to be plugged in to the wall.

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.092
Electrostatic speakers DO require some voltage.

00:01:41.092 --> 00:01:44.042
It's very low level voltage that charges the panels.

00:01:44.042 --> 00:01:46.088
You won't notice it on your electric bill whatsoever.

00:01:46.088 --> 00:01:50.006
We do have many speakers that have amplified subwoofers in them.

00:01:50.006 --> 00:01:52.044
Those, like you would expect with a subwoofer or a receiver,

00:01:52.044 --> 00:01:55.006
do have to take some power from the wall.

00:01:55.006 --> 00:01:57.048
So yes, you do have to plug in our products.

00:01:58.049 --> 00:02:03.083
A friend told me they are dangerous, and can shock children and pets.

00:02:03.083 --> 00:02:06.054
I heard a story once, our previous owner actually

00:02:06.054 --> 00:02:09.062
turned the speakers up and put his tongue on the panel...

00:02:09.062 --> 00:02:11.075
...and he lived.

00:02:11.075 --> 00:02:12.091
[laughter]

00:02:12.091 --> 00:02:16.079
The insulation coating on there prevents any electricity from getting out

00:02:16.079 --> 00:02:21.059
and hurting the listener, and it actually doesn't matter how big an amp you put on it.

00:02:21.059 --> 00:02:27.047
We actually limit the voltage so that you can never get in a situation where you can hurt yourself.

00:02:27.047 --> 00:02:31.099
They are very beamy, you can only be in one spot, I don't want to buy these.

00:02:31.099 --> 00:02:36.065
That misconception started back many years ago when they made electrostats flat.

00:02:36.065 --> 00:02:39.061
And the flat electrostats did beam sound.

00:02:39.061 --> 00:02:41.015
You would have a window this big,

00:02:41.015 --> 00:02:43.040
and if you moved your head out, you couldn't hear the highs.

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:49.015
MartinLogan curves our electrotats, giving you a very, very wide area to listen to.

00:02:49.015 --> 00:02:54.025
Electrostatics: They have no bass, you can't feel the bass!!

00:02:54.025 --> 00:02:57.083
Early electrostatic models in the 40's and 50's did lack bass.

00:02:57.083 --> 00:03:01.046
Since we've been building electrostats we actually build a hybrid design.

00:03:01.046 --> 00:03:04.092
That means we take advantage of what the electrostat does really well

00:03:04.092 --> 00:03:08.035
in the upper bass, the mid range, and the treble,

00:03:08.035 --> 00:03:12.027
and we use a traditional dynamic woofer for the low end.

00:03:12.027 --> 00:03:14.028
That allows us to have the best of both worlds.

00:03:14.028 --> 00:03:20.018
We can have deep extended bass but still have the magic that electrostats are so well known for.

00:03:20.018 --> 00:03:23.053
They are just for listening to music, they're not for home theater.

00:03:23.053 --> 00:03:26.003
[slurrrrrrrrrp]

00:03:26.003 --> 00:03:27.087
Well I found that one to be always wrong.

00:03:27.087 --> 00:03:31.000
I don't care if it's a gun shot or a violin, fidelity is fidelity.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.041
With a MartinLogan you have a very large panel area so things like explosions and pianos

00:03:35.041 --> 00:03:41.055
are life size, unlike a small 5 or 6-inch midrange in most conventional speakers.

00:03:41.055 --> 00:03:47.034
I like to ROCK! Electrostatics are good only for classical and jazz.

00:03:47.034 --> 00:03:50.092
Well anybody that says that has never heard a MartinLogan speaker,

00:03:50.092 --> 00:03:53.046
because they rock!
