00:00:02.064 --> 00:00:05.619
This is a large undertaking, as you are aware, 

00:00:05.716 --> 00:00:08.411
and particularly the work that you're going to be doing 

00:00:08.411 --> 00:00:12.199
in each of the agencies and departments helping the President-elect

00:00:12.199 --> 00:00:15.621
, the Vice President-elect, and ultimately the Cabinet members 

00:00:15.621 --> 00:00:19.349
really understand what are the opportunities of their agency

00:00:19.468 --> 00:00:21.525
what are some of the challenges, 

00:00:21.525 --> 00:00:24.216
what will they want to do sort of first, second, and third.

00:00:24.216 --> 00:00:26.096
In the context of the Transition

00:00:26.096 --> 00:00:30.642
there's a lot of work to think through in the next 60-some days. 

00:00:30.642 --> 00:00:32.444
In the area of climate change, 

00:00:32.444 --> 00:00:37.224
this isn’t something that the U.S. is necessarily engaged in aggressively. 

00:00:37.224 --> 00:00:39.340
But for the President-elect

00:00:39.523 --> 00:00:42.998
he sees this as a true opportunity for us to create new jobs

00:00:43.233 --> 00:00:46.233
at the same time we're increasing our security 

00:00:46.479 --> 00:00:52.349
and stabilizing the economy by really focusing on a clean energy future. 

00:00:52.663 --> 00:00:54.648
And obviously these two issues go hand in hand 

00:00:54.648 --> 00:00:56.790
-- energy policy and climate policy.

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.369
I was the Energy, Environment, and (Agricultural) Policy director 

00:01:00.369 --> 00:01:03.556
for the Obama campaign and during that time 

00:01:03.556 --> 00:01:06.194
I think the exciting thing from my perspective 

00:01:06.194 --> 00:01:09.590
is that energy policy and climate policy were so front and center, 

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:12.542
so we had an opportunity to really help voters 

00:01:12.542 --> 00:01:17.453
understand what change Barack Obama wanted to bring to the White House. 

00:01:17.453 --> 00:01:20.327
Aggressively investing in renewable energy;

00:01:20.327 --> 00:01:23.722
making sure that energy efficiency 

00:01:23.722 --> 00:01:26.361
-- what we do with our appliances and what we do with our buildings 

00:01:26.361 --> 00:01:29.469
-- really can make a big difference in terms our carbon footprint

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:32.192
and how we rethink our energy policy.

00:01:32.852 --> 00:01:35.007
One of the great things about this transition, 

00:01:35.007 --> 00:01:37.332
and one of the things that’s sort of different from prior transitions, 

00:01:37.332 --> 00:01:40.441
 is this recognition that you do have to work across lines 

00:01:40.441 --> 00:01:43.915
and you don’t have to just sit in the traditional government stovepipes;

00:01:43.915 --> 00:01:47.220
that some of the best ideas will be the ones that can move back and forth.

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:51.020
And whether its issues like energy or climate change 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:53.894
there’s going to need to be, ultimately,

00:01:53.894 --> 00:01:55.174
once we're in office

00:01:55.174 --> 00:01:58.988
a huge amount of coordination between particularly these agencies. 

00:01:58.988 --> 00:02:00.738
So I think this is a very good start.

00:02:01.365 --> 00:02:03.873
I am lucky enough to be working with 

00:02:03.873 --> 00:02:05.832
a former administrator of the EPA 

00:02:05.832 --> 00:02:09.496
who's heading up our Energy Policy Transition Team. 

00:02:09.496 --> 00:02:12.258
Her record under the Clinton Administration, 

00:02:12.258 --> 00:02:14.217
in terms of fighting for clean air and clean water, 

00:02:14.217 --> 00:02:15.739
is very much on target where I think

00:02:15.739 --> 00:02:19.416
President-elect Obama is going to want to take the country. 

00:02:19.416 --> 00:02:20.539
So we’re very lucky 

00:02:20.539 --> 00:02:23.386
have such an aggressive leader in this area. 

00:02:23.386 --> 00:02:25.502
I think a big part of this as well

00:02:25.502 --> 00:02:27.252
is hearing from America about 

00:02:27.252 --> 00:02:29.290
their thoughts and ideals are

00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:33.025
which is why we have a really exciting website 

00:02:33.025 --> 00:02:36.025
at Change.gov where you can go log on 

00:02:35.899 --> 00:02:38.407
and share your thoughts and ideas about policies. 

00:02:38.407 --> 00:02:40.784
It’s an exciting time for folks 

00:02:40.784 --> 00:02:43.840
that are thinking through the same policies I am.

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.628
I think a whole lot of folks are really excited 

00:02:47.628 --> 00:02:49.038
about a new administration 

00:02:49.038 --> 00:02:51.050
and a new chapter in American history.
