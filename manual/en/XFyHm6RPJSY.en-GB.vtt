00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.930
Authorities in London are considering a crackdown on
noisy 'supercars'

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.310
in and around the exclusive district of Knightsbridge.

00:00:12.670 --> 00:00:16.059
Every summer, wealthy car owners from the
Middle East descend

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:19.600
on affluent parts of the city with their prized
motors.

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:24.710
But residents here say they're being driven
to distraction by the revving engines and

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:25.690
late night racing.

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:37.520
"The noise they create is an enormous problem.
It's not so bad during the day

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:41.040
although I do know that some of the elderly
residents find it very difficult

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:46.450
but the real problem for us is at night when
they race up and down Sloane Street,

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:52.480
amongst other places, revving their cars at
high speed and making really horrific noise

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:53.920
and it's quite impossible to sleep"

00:00:54.020 --> 00:01:00.000
Now the local council is considering amending
the law to ban revving engines, racing and

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:00.949
sudden acceleration.

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:07.460
"These are very wealthy people, particularly
from the Gulf States but possibly also from

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:09.130
the UK and beyond,

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:16.090
who drive these sports cars, these very very
upmarket models which have the facility

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:21.180
to switch into sports mode which means they
can make an incredible amount of noise,

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.220
even when they are stationery, just by revving
the engine and

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:31.640
we know that people are racing the cars, driving
in convoy, very often there's loud music attached.

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:36.579
And generally it's creating an enormous disturbance
in the highly populated

00:01:36.579 --> 00:01:38.879
and highly residential streets."

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:44.060
But some drivers feel the criticisms levelled
against them are unfair.

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:46.490
"We come from a lot of different countries,

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:50.530
plus there are local people here who have
supercars as well.

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:55.670
Whenever you're in a country that's not yours
you gotta respect the rules in the end,

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:00.009
so drive carefully, respect the people who
live here, don't try to rev a lot or make

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:00.590
a lot of sound.

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.110
In the end, you don't want to be in their
place.

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:07.990
So its not always Arabs who do this, a lot
of Europeans do this as well."

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:14.040
Any penalties that are introduced for noisey
drivers will likely be too late to stop this

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:16.590
summer's supercar assault.

00:02:16.590 --> 00:02:21.720
The proposed changes are under consultation
and will remain so until the autumn.
