00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:08.710
Hi, my name’s Neil Haydock and I’m here
with Rodda’s with a very simple scone recipe

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:10.670
for the perfect Cornish clotted cream tea.

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:13.640
We’re going to start with 500 grams of flour.

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:22.830
To that we’re going to add 100 grams of
salted butter, 100 grams of caster sugar,

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.930
and 15 grams of baking powder.

00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:30.450
We’re going to rub that together to form
a crumb.

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:36.650
This is going to take a minute or two, but
you just want a fine crumb so all that butter

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:40.729
is incorporated into the flour, and the sugar
and the baking powder is all evenly mixed

00:00:40.729 --> 00:00:42.799
through the mix.

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:46.909
So just using your fingertips you’ll feel
when all the butter is incorporated and everything,

00:00:46.909 --> 00:00:54.190
and we’ve got that nice fine crumb and we’re
ready to add the milk.

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:58.010
Use the one hand to steady the bowl, and the
other hand to work the mix together.

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:03.130
We’re looking for a nice dough where it’s
coming away from the bowl and your hands,

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:05.750
and then it’s ready to roll.

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:08.400
Take a little bit more flour, just pop on
your board.

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.370
Place the dough on it.

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:12.890
A little bit of flour on top and a little
bit onto your rolling pin.

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:16.040
And we’re looking to take it down to probably
about an inch thick.

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.890
Ok, that’s perfect and good to go.

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:21.630
So we’re going to bring in our baking sheet.

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:29.200
This should give us about, sort of, 12 scones.

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:40.250
Ok, I’m just going to remove the excess
dough.

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:44.300
So the scones are ready for the oven now,
and what we’re going to do is just give

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:50.000
them a little bit of a glaze with a little
bit of egg wash.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.360
Egg wash is going to give you a nice sort
of deep colour when they come out of the oven.

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.690
You can just use milk.

00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:57.380
So our scones are ready for the oven.

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:08.840
So we’ve pre-heated it to 200 degrees, and
they’re going to go in for about 15 minutes.

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.739
So here we are, 15 minutes later, perfect
scone.

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:14.090
All we have to do now is put them together.

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:19.000
We’re just going to break open the scones,
and in traditional Cornish way it has to be

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.080
jam first.

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.120
A decent little amount of jam.

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:29.480
And what we’re going to do is pop on the
clotted cream, and show off that really lovely

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:30.480
golden crust.

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.010
Couldn’t be easier, the perfect Cornish
clotted cream tea.
