00:00:06.275 --> 00:00:07.836
Excuse me, everyone â€“

00:00:07.836 --> 00:00:10.396
can I ask you to listen to
me for a minute please?

00:00:10.726 --> 00:00:15.250
I have a little girl. She was
very abused for her entire life.

00:00:15.518 --> 00:00:17.153
She was terrified.

00:00:17.153 --> 00:00:20.748
She has a very determined look
in her eyes wherever she goes,

00:00:21.254 --> 00:00:23.950
and she was hurt and
abused her entire life,

00:00:24.237 --> 00:00:28.376
because of this establishment and
because of establishments like it.

00:00:29.046 --> 00:00:31.752
She was locked away. She was hidden.

00:00:32.543 --> 00:00:34.479
She had nobody there for her.

00:00:34.927 --> 00:00:38.752
She was crying. She was
scared every single moment.

00:00:40.154 --> 00:00:43.957
And because her usefulness had run out,
she was going to be killed.

00:00:44.492 --> 00:00:46.306
Someone was going to murder her.

00:00:46.306 --> 00:00:51.563
And I can see you smiling, and I can see
you laughing, but to her this is not funny.

00:00:52.204 --> 00:00:54.526
I went in there with other humans

00:00:54.526 --> 00:00:56.196
and I took her out of there.

00:00:56.196 --> 00:00:58.798
And if I hadn't, she wouldn't
be with me right now.

00:00:59.198 --> 00:01:02.564
She would be gone,
just like all of her sisters.

00:01:03.101 --> 00:01:05.680
Just like everybody who we left behind.

00:01:06.685 --> 00:01:08.535
And I'm here to tell you today

00:01:09.502 --> 00:01:13.229
that all of those other girls,
that everyone who we left behind,

00:01:13.489 --> 00:01:17.734
they just wanted to live too,
and they deserve their lives.

00:01:18.312 --> 00:01:21.940
And right now their eggs and
their milk and their bodies

00:01:21.940 --> 00:01:26.929
are on plates inside this restaurant,
and that is so unfair to them.

00:01:28.199 --> 00:01:30.647
My little girl's name is Snow,

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:34.931
and every time you see someone
eating somebody else's eggs,

00:01:35.169 --> 00:01:38.981
or somebody else's body,
you are going to remember her name.

00:01:39.633 --> 00:01:41.349
Her name is Snow.

00:01:41.935 --> 00:01:45.528
She's a beautiful little girl
and she just wants to live.

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:49.804
This isn't food, it's violence.

00:01:56.417 --> 00:02:00.031
(all together)
It's not food, it's violence.

00:02:00.763 --> 00:02:05.350
Please think of her name every time
you see somebody's body on a plate.

00:02:05.542 --> 00:02:11.202
Her name is Snow, and she
just wants to live. Thank you.

00:02:11.202 --> 00:02:14.000
