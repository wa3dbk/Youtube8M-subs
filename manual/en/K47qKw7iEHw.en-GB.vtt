00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:43.288

To prepare mathri we will knead the dough.

00:01:13.348 --> 00:01:19.722
In a bowl take dough and semolina.

00:01:21.597 --> 00:01:40.444

00:01:43.241 --> 00:01:45.175
Mix all the ingredients.

00:01:47.793 --> 00:01:50.308
Knead the dough by slightly adding water in small quantities.

00:01:50.778 --> 00:01:54.996
The dough must be slightly harder than the dough for pooris.

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:03.347
While preparing dough we used oil, we can also use clarified butter.

00:02:04.442 --> 00:02:15.683
Dough is ready and it took less than 1/4 cup of water to prepare it.

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:20.965
Cover the dough and keep aside for 15-20 mins.

00:02:21.386 --> 00:02:25.400
The dough will be set by then and we will prepare mathri.

00:02:30.606 --> 00:02:39.533
After 15 mins the dough is ready. Now slightly press the dough to make it soft.

00:02:40.275 --> 00:02:49.125
If the dough becomes too hard then you can add water and knead it again.

00:02:50.781 --> 00:02:59.657
Dough is ready, now make small balls of dough and keep aside.

00:03:13.297 --> 00:03:19.476
You can make 15-16 balls from the dough.

00:03:19.981 --> 00:03:25.330
Heat oil in a pan and meanwhile roll the dough.

00:03:25.681 --> 00:03:38.760
Roll the dough thickly with a diameter of 2 inches.

00:03:39.947 --> 00:03:47.124
Make holes 4-5 times in the mathri using fork on both the sides.

00:03:58.039 --> 00:04:03.073
Check the oil whether it's hot or not by putting a small piece of dough.

00:04:03.428 --> 00:04:09.304
The oil is ready, do not overheat the oil.

00:04:09.663 --> 00:04:16.855
The oil must be medium hot and cook the mathri in low-medium flame.

00:04:17.277 --> 00:04:42.282
Fry the mathri in oil and when they turn brown from one side, flip it.

00:04:43.611 --> 00:04:48.837
Fry the mathri until golden brown.

00:04:55.056 --> 00:05:08.772
Transfer them on a plate. Fry all the mathri likewise.

00:05:14.921 --> 00:05:20.980
Salty wheat mathri is finally ready.

00:05:21.769 --> 00:05:29.794

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:31.945
Relish it whenever you feel like and use them within 2 months.

00:05:32.203 --> 00:05:36.110
