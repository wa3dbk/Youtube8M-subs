00:00:01.539 --> 00:00:04.200
Green wooden houses,

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:07.250
windmills,

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:08.989
tourists,

00:00:08.989 --> 00:00:11.649
more windmills.

00:00:11.649 --> 00:00:18.649
Zaandam has everything you would
think a town in "Holland" should have.

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:23.789
But of course there's more to this town,

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:30.609
than old wooden houses.

00:00:30.609 --> 00:00:33.320
This is a modern city in 
the Netherlands.

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:36.450
Proud of its past,

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:43.050
but with a modern part too.

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.730
Most of the cycling infa 
is up to date,

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:48.000
well-designed and smooth.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.710
Like this wide two-way cycle path,

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:53.940
with priority in a new neighborhood.

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.080
But it cannot all be perfect.

00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:01.970
Some streets should have been designed
better.

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:06.460
Some experts went on a "cycle safari"
invited by the local branch of the

00:01:06.460 --> 00:01:08.729
Cyclists' Union.

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:12.140
To see where things were slightly
substandard,

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:14.760
or where they were even dangerous.

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.670
Like this good cycle path that ends just
before a narrow bridge.

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:22.560
Throwing cyclists back into traffic.

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:23.590
It is a good thing,

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:26.530
Dutch drivers are usually cyclists too,

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:28.780
and they give enough space.

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:32.070
But if you see the number of cyclists 
at this bridge,

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.760
compared to the amount of motorized
traffic,

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:38.910
you would think the city would have come up
with a better solution to handle traffic

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:45.910
on this narrow bridge.

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:01.670
Elsewhere in town,

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.690
crossings were designed according to the
latest Dutch standards.

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:09.179
But we arrived at a very odd situation
too.

00:02:09.179 --> 00:02:13.349
A strange, central, left turning lane for
cyclists.

00:02:13.349 --> 00:02:17.619
Just outside a cycle street where
cyclists have priority.

00:02:17.619 --> 00:02:21.799
Had the end of the cycle street been
pushed forward 10 meters. The left turn

00:02:21.799 --> 00:02:26.159
could have been handled in the cycle
street, in a far better way.

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:31.260
Cycle parking in front of a railway
station was again well-designed.

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:34.509
So was this multilevel railroad crossing.

00:02:34.509 --> 00:02:37.249
Way finding cannot be a problem either.

00:02:37.249 --> 00:02:44.249
And cycle paths between the residential
areas are perfect.

00:02:45.189 --> 00:02:48.840
No wonder cycling is flourishing.

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.009
The 'Fietsenpakhuis' is an indoor
bicycle parking facility 

00:02:52.009 --> 00:02:59.709
that makes parking in the town center very easy.

00:03:00.869 --> 00:03:04.759
The name means 'bicycle warehouse'
because the building was designed so it

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:10.319
resembles a traditional warehouse of the
region.

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:17.319
700 bicycles can be easily
parked in a light and open building.

00:03:19.719 --> 00:03:26.629
Many people have found their way to this
modern cycling parking.

00:03:26.629 --> 00:03:30.430
It also has rest-rooms, lockers,

00:03:30.430 --> 00:03:37.430
and you can have your bike repaired.

00:03:46.739 --> 00:03:51.059
All in all cycling in Zaandam is healthy, 
but from a Dutch perspective

00:03:51.059 --> 00:03:53.939
some things could and should be better.

00:03:53.939 --> 00:03:56.389
Even in the Netherlands, 
there is always room for improvement.
