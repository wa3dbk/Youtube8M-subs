00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:06.500
I walked inside the main memory of the UNIVAC I and I

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:09.600
had no idea that you could take that room full

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:13.280
of equipment and squeeze it down to where

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:17.060
we are talking now about embedding microprocessors

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:18.160
in our bodies.

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.320
I got hooked on the notion of using computer

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.580
graphics for human-computer interaction when

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.080
I was a graduate student and saw this fantastic

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:34.400
film called "Sketchpad" which showed a person

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:37.860
interacting with a computer using graphics,

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.160
which was utterly novel at the time.

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:46.080
It was less a decision than just falling in love, and

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:50.160
saying man, that looks like fun! And I want to do that!

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.300
Rather than a calculated decision of "this

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.580
is going to be a big thing some day. "We had no idea,

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:02.100
studying computer science, how endemic computing

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.540
would become in the modern world.

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:09.820
In the '60s, there weren't any computer graphics

00:01:09.820 --> 00:01:13.260
systems to a first approximation. I was amazingly

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.580
fortunate that in my second year here at Brown, we

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:20.280
managed to get an equipment grant from IBM and got

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:25.080
one of the very earliest commercial display consoles.

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:29.580
We've had the longest running computer graphics

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:34.140
laboratory in the known universe, and I was fortunate

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:36.680
again to be in the right place, at the right time to

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:41.440
be able to help found a Computer Science department.

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:45.000
I, in fact, came to Brown with the notion that

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:48.870
that's what I wanted to do. I worked with colleagues like

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:52.700
John Savage from Engineering to build up our

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:57.760
initially small department, 7 people, and we are now

00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:01.280
close to 30 and still have some growth potential.

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:05.900
I characterize what I do as experimental research

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:07.100
and systems building.

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:11.320
I like to build systems, particularly ones that are useful

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:14.260
to ordinary folks.

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.920
In a sense that makes it a little easier, because I can

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.099
have a pretty good idea of the kind of target

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:24.599
system I would like to create with my students.

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:29.320
I had great fun having integrated teams of a

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:32.680
couple of PhD students, some Master's students, and

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.640
some undergraduates. I have to say, most of the time, 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:40.440
still, the largest proportion by far of my workforce, 

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:43.900
if you can call it that, are the undergraduates.

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:47.080
I was a big fan of the Open Curriculum.

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.940
The Open Curriculum has lasted because it works

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:54.640
for Brown in terms of attracting a bright, ambitious,

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:58.260
independent, free-thinking student body.

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.200
People enjoy teaching a kind of student who has some

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:04.800
streak of "I want to do it my way," which I

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:06.300
always had myself.

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:12.660
I have been able to forge relationships with the forefront

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:17.340
companies in our field and have been able to place

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:22.580
former students in positions where they quickly

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:26.920
rose to leadership positions and, of course, it's a

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:29.920
standard thing, once you have a few hot shots

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:33.340
go to a company, they come back and recruit.

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.060
Pixar is a very interesting case in point, where some of

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:41.280
their very earliest workforce were people who had

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:45.040
studied with me. I'm very proud of the leadership

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:50.280
role that some of those people have performed in Pixar

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:53.720
and some of them are still there as very seasoned

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:57.260
veterans at this point. One of my most fun moments

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:01.140
is when Steve Jobs flew me out at his expense to see

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:05.720
the premiere of "Toy Story I," and I got a signed

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:09.940
book on the making of it with Steve's inscription:

00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:11.760
"You made it so."
