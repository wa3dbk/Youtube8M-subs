00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:06.020
Hey, what up guys.

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:10.400
We're here to discuss the option and grip
tape.

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:17.680
Grip tape is used for gripping your shoes
or feet to skate board.

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:23.120
Along time ago, they didn't use grip tape
and they were bare foot on boards.

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:27.050
Boards weren't made out of fiberglass, different
materials.

00:00:27.050 --> 00:00:34.480
I'd say in the 70s, they started running the
grip more often and it was commonly used on

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.510
just about every single skateboard from here
on out.

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:45.190
It basically looks just like sandpaper that
you would use for sanding wood, but now we

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:49.559
are using for the opposite, we are using it
to grip ourselves to a piece of wood.

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:57.250
There is different grains of grips, sometimes
its a thicker grain and sometimes a medium

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:00.530
grain or even super-low.

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:08.460
People will buy grip accordingly to what their
preference is.

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:15.500
Standard grip is pretty medium grade, there
also are glue on grip options, which you'll

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:20.520
find commonly done by the manufacturer and
not by the customer.

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.590
Most commonly is the black-colored grip tape.

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.270
There are other options.

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:35.049
You can get colored grips in just about every
color you can imagine.

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:41.770
They do different graphics on grips, you can
get different stencils cut out of grips, everything

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:48.299
you can possibly imagine is out there when
it comes to grip, its almost like your own

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:53.419
personal art as far the top of the board goes.

00:01:53.419 --> 00:01:59.829
One thing you must keep in mind, though, is
that more grip on the board is better for

00:01:59.829 --> 00:02:06.409
your skating, so if you plan on cutting it
up into different pieces, make sure where

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:12.480
your feet are on the board is completely covered
with a grip surface.

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:14.220
There's also different widths.

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:18.880
The standard size of most skateboards is within
8-inches.

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:22.110
Some boards run all the way to a 10-inch wide.

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:26.490
So, there's different widths companies make
for the grip.

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:30.470
You can also buy it in different, by the foot.

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:38.200
A sheet of grip is standard to about 32-inches
by 9-inches wide for your, most of your street

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:40.420
set ups.

00:02:40.420 --> 00:02:46.320
They've even come out with clear grip tape,
so you can actually see the graphic or some

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:50.800
of the logos that are printed on the top sheet
of the board through the grip.

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:59.070
One thing I will have to say is with the clear
grip, you must keep it clean or else it doesn't

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:00.590
work as clear.

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:04.950
It will get dirty and you will not be able
to see through it.

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:10.050
So, best option, my personal preference is
the straight black.
