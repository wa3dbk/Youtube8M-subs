The general perception is that the improvements to the EG-TL team are attributed to me, but as of right now, our performance is still not at a satisfactory level.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:16.000
To be honest, there really isn’t a lot that I’ve done for the team. When I joined the team, I thought a lot about solidifying the basics.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:32.000
And basically what that means is that I wanted to make sure the players had an intense practice environment and I also wanted to make sure the players could focus properly.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Another thing I worked on, was to make sure that the team developed coach-player relationships and player-player relationships. Honestly, I have a lot more things I want to get done with the team but the time was so short that I just haven’t been able to do much.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:47.000
First off, the most important thing is that there has to be belief between the coaching staff and the players.The players should trust and see that their coaches are serious about the game and are working hard for them.   

00:02:48.000 --> 00:03:00.000
The players need to acknowledge that the coaching staff is really jumping through hoops just for the players’ sake. However, just believing is not everything.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:29.000
Which is why secondly, there has to be distinct synchronization within the team. It can’t just be words. Individually, and together... Err...

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.000
I honestly don’t think that I can explain this. It’s just a know-how that I’ve developed from years of coaching. It’s just this way that I know that exists. (laughs)

00:03:54.000 --> 00:04:13.000
When I was in middle school, eSports didn’t even exist. But I really enjoyed playing games. And then I always thought about the possibility of an actual paying career in gaming for the future.

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:37.000
And then eight years later, when I was 21 years old, in 1997, eSports started developing in Korea. And then that’s when I thought about how I wanted to possibly pursue a special career in the world of eSports.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:17.000
Currently, we run a very solid lineup with five players, and then there’s that one player who doesn’t show any weaknesses in any matchup. And that player is Liquid`HerO. I think HerO is the strongest player.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:44.000
We actually do have a specialized player like that. And that player is Oz. Oz is a very strategic player. He is especially gifted on two player maps. 

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:57.000
If we notify him that we’re going to need his special talents on a two player map, he comes up with some really excellent ideas. So I try to utilize Oz quite frequently.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:27.000
I stated this during the MLG on-stage interview, but because I did play professionally in the past, I had some desires left unfulfilled.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:41.000
So I wanted to know what it felt like to be a player again, and then also have that feeling reflect over to how I could become a better coach, so I decided to participate in this MLG because it was such a good chance.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:50.000
Also, MLG has a really comfortable environment, so I felt like I was going to have fun if I decided to participate. 

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:58.000
Uhhh.... Err.... Ssssss..... Yeah....

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:11.000
There’s just a lot that I want to say! I just think that I have too much that I want to talk about... Not enough time... (laughs)
