00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:07.560
Saturation of color really means how intense
the color is. Is it sort of the most red it

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:14.049
can be. And often, the way to change the intensity,
because you don't always want the red to be

00:00:14.049 --> 00:00:20.360
the most red it can be, the best way kind
of to change that is actually to put in some

00:00:20.360 --> 00:00:25.580
of the complementary color, which is why we
did the color wheel. I did one for you, and

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:29.480
then we're going to work a little bit with
yellow and purple. But what I have here is

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:35.489
my red out of a tube, and my green out of
a tube. That's the most intense color I can

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:41.429
get. And then, what I've done is try to come
to a neutral point where it's neither red

00:00:41.429 --> 00:00:47.140
nor green, but an even mixture of the two,
and then I go back in each direction, and

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:51.940
you can see that that really does modulate
the color. So we're going to try this with

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:58.079
yellow and purple, or violet, which are opposite
each other on the color wheel. But the kicker

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:04.500
about this is that violet is so dark. You
can see it's much darker than the green, and

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:11.450
yellow is so much lighter. Here's our yellow
up here. It's a lovely, lovely, bright yellow,

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:18.810
and it's just as light as it can be. So obviously,
if you put these half and half, if you do

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:23.530
half yellow, and half purple on your pallet,
you're not going to have anything that looks

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:28.780
like, you know, that looks like yellow, so
I'm going to show you something else. You

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:34.579
can get in the tube, or in the bottle, other
colors, and one of the most common ones is

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:42.670
yellow ocher, sometimes it's called yellow
oxide, and that is a yellow. And I'll put

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:49.750
some here; I'll mix it with the yellow I have,
and you can see it's a duller yellow. It's

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:55.600
more like a mustard yellow perhaps, but it's
a duller yellow; it's not as bright. So it's

00:01:55.600 --> 00:02:00.950
still yellow, we still know it's yellow, but
it's just not as bright as that yellow is,

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:06.350
so it's less intense, it's more neutral. And
we can go one further, because they've even

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:13.820
got this one that's sort of further than that.
It might be called sometimes raw sienna. And

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:14.970
it can go further yet.
