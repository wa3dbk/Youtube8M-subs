Sue Lawson here at NAB with
Jeromy Young or a I like to think of him

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:05.100
Mister Atomos

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:09.100
You can swap between
flavors of ProRes by holding that down for

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:09.900
a couple seconds

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:16.309
 

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:20.300
This came from the drone market 
and the action cam market request as well as

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:24.100
smaller DSLRs that already have a
monitor, but they want ProRes recording

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:27.539
and they want it to be easy to mount and
be the light and portable

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:31.900
this weighs 3.5 ounces. So it's really
reallylight. That's a working unit.

00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:35.200
It records to Cfast. That's Cfast 1.0, so

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.980
we don't need the super super fast 
Cfast 2.0 which is really expensive

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:44.200
This is 1.0 where you can get like 128
gig for around three hundred dollars

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:48.079
so nice and affordable media recording.
So you pop that in

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:52.400
and then we do automatic trigger over
an HDMI from the smaller cameras

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:54.440
so to record and a playback deck

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.180
all in the same time. It was been a
challenge putting all the display

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:59.980
functions and control functions

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:03.010
on a small device with LEDs, but we
think we've done a pretty good job.

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:03.600
This is your

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:06.900
audio level meters, these are your
battery indicators, this is the time left on

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:07.600
the disc

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:11.600
and you can swap between ProRes flavors
by holding that down for a

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:12.420
couple seconds

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.800
it shows when you have a
lock signal and we also do

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:19.250
2:2 and 3:2 pull down on this so that you
can go back to 24p

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:23.170
for those film guys. So this is $295

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:26.800
includes a battery and the unit in in
the box. There's a lot of mounting options.

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:27.290
we've got a

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:30.800
a cheese grater plate which
we call a cheese stick.

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:34.270
that sits on top that lets you
mounted like traditionally

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:37.990
we've had these rubber straps that we
got the idea from the bike lights.

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:41.369
Well we all ride to work.

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:45.600
We saw that nice rubber bound that can strapped
to the side of a tripod

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:49.180
and just mount it anywhere. 
Now when is this shipping?

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:52.300
This is shipping... we're already in
production for this so this

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:54.390
should be out in the stores by mid-May.

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:58.300
You know the thing I love about all your
products, not just the reliability of

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:00.020
them in the capacity of them

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.980
but they're so easy to work with. I don't
need a lot of training, nobody

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:07.440
a lot of training with these they're
like, okay I think I can figure that out.

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:10.930
Record. Play. 
It's perfect.

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:13.720
Mark Twain said I'm sorry I write you a
long letter I didn't have time to write

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:14.370
a short one

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.470
This is a short letter, we spent a
lotta time making sure our

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:22.110
products are easy to use and fit
into the workflow creative professionals.

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:25.540
We're a toolmaker actually. We make tools
for creating guys

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:28.770
to improve the quality, reduce their time

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:31.200
and make sure they can deliver a better
product to the customs.

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.200
And they work.

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.720
They work. You guys work.
It's Atomos.

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.400
What more do you need to know? It is
absolutely fabulous being here with you

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:40.150
again

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:44.100
at NAB. thanks Jeremy I appreciate it.
