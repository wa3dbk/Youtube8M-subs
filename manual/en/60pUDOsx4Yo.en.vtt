00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:18.140
so we have two types of cables here this
is one and now but we're going to make

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:26.180
this very simple table this one here
just a twist I am using this yarn this

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:32.059
is a trick I found so like that that I
know that it's every eight rows that I

00:00:32.059 --> 00:00:37.760
want to do it I passed it through where
I twisted it and then I know that I have

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:44.780
one two three four five six seven eight
rows that means this is the row where

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:51.720
I'm going to be twisting

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:56.230
we've knit two
stitches I purl them before I do my

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:06.640
cable so now I will twist I can do any
use any gadget there's some some cable

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:12.350
needles there are all kinds of cable
needles so just use anything that I have

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.850
at hand

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:23.270
I just take one two three four
this is an eight stitch cable so I'm

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:27.680
taking four only
I am leaving them in the front of my

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:33.140
work you can leave them in the back if
you want as long as you do it the same

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:37.060
way always so I will knit the next four
one two three and four

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:50.210
now I will take

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:59.210
the four that I left in front put them
on my left hand and I will knit from

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:10.680
that one two three four

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:13.939
notice that I
did not twist them I put them in through

00:02:13.939 --> 00:02:19.670
this side I'm taking them out through
this side and there is my twist

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:30.220
that's my cable very neat I am
going to remember to take my yarn and

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.720
pass it through so that I remember that
that is where I did my twisting

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:48.230
that one right there so like that I'm going to
remember and I will purl the next two

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:50.560
stitches

00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:01.709
and continue with my regular stitch

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:12.350
so remember that that's where we did or
twist and this is the way back this is

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:20.270
the wrong side and I will knit the two
that I purled on the other side this

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:26.000
is a knit 
and this is the cable itself this is

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:38.600
where I twisted them so I will have one
two three four they do appear a little

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:45.170
bit tight because you twisted them so
the stitches are a little bit tight so I

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:56.480
have my eight stitches there and I have
my two knit stitches these were all

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:06.650
purls, all  purl stitches and these are my
two knit that are that appear like purl

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:14.510
on the other side and that's the way it
looks and now I know that this is my

00:04:14.510 --> 00:04:21.830
first and my second row so that I know
that I post every eight rows and that's

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:25.930
the way it looks but this is very nice
