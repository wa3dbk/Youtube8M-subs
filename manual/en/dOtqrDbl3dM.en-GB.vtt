Today I'm doing a really simple style that

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:24.680
looks really effective: looped plaits!
Brush out your hair and separate into two

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:32.900
even sections.
Starting just above your ear plait holding

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:45.440
it a little away from your head so it sits
out.

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:56.149
Roll the end of the plait up and under the
start.

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:04.280
Pin it in place.
Take the end of the plait and push it into

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:26.150
the start so the loose end is completely hidden.
Add more pins if you need.

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:30.500
Repeat on the other side, start with the plait.
Some versions of this style use a hairband

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:35.630
at the top but I prefer pins because it makes
the loops a lot rounder.

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:47.070
Don't forget to hide the ends of the plait
and pin it very securely.

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:58.830
This is what it looks like from the back.
Add some embellishments like a headband or

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:04.820
flowers.
All done!

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:10.080
This style is good for a casual look or even
a classic Lolita style if that's what you're

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.450
going for.
