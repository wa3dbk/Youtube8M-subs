00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:04.700
When you go out and get a tripod, go and check some out and see what works for you

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:07.200
because there are many many many of them on the market.

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.290
The key with the tripod is stability

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:14.160
it's got to hold your camera nice and
still and stable because if your camera

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.700
moves during exposure

00:00:15.759 --> 00:00:20.770
chances are you're gonna get a very wobbly picture, now I like 

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:24.789
heavy tripods, the heavier it is the better as far as i'm concerned, this one is made 

00:00:24.789 --> 00:00:25.510
of aluminium 

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:29.609
and actually it's probably half the weight of the one that I carry around

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:33.030
even the lighter weight of my two. The reason I like heavy 

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.000
is because it keeps it well planted on the ground. You don't want your tripod to 

00:00:37.059 --> 00:00:39.040
wobble look if I stick back down there

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:43.480
put my hand on the top and wobble, look there's next to no movement in that 

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:46.760
however

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.809
if you're not big and muscly like I am you may find it to be a bit of a pain

00:00:50.809 --> 00:00:55.100
carrying a heavy tripod, now if you're a rough trouser wearing bloke who is a bit beefy

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:58.300
don't be a wimp carry the tripod because it will make the difference.

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.870
however if you can't do that because
you're the smaller build and you want to 

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:04.700
do some serious climbing and you've got lot's of lenses in your backpack

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:08.510
you could go for a Carbon Fiber Tripod
like this one.

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:12.170
this is beautifully made and it's about
half the weight of that one 

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:15.960
you could strap that on your rucksack and you'd hardly know it was there. 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.060
Price tag of this is about 280 quid 

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:23.810
don't take a sharp intake of breath, because it really isn't a bad price 

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:28.140
if you divide that over twenty years of use per day that's a fractional tiny tiny 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.380
cost for getting some amazing pictures.

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:33.600
if you do go for a carbon fiber I mean

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:38.340
you could spend a bit more money and go
for a real top end professional one

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:38.579
like this 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:42.340
Gitso right here, it's beautifully made and it really will last you a life time.

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:47.500
and it's even a bit lighter than the
Manfrotto there. With the light weight 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:48.200
tripods

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.380
little tip for you, hang your camera bag around the neck of It and let it dangle 

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:55.100
because the weight of spare lenses and extra bodies 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:59.800
will add stability if you've just
climbed out to some interesting location

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.229
and you're on heather or perhaps your in a room of a house with a thick 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:03.939
carpet

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:07.240
the tripod might be steady but it can
still wobble

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:11.510
because what's underneath is a bit soft
adding weight by hanging your camera bag 

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:13.569
around it will help stabilize it

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:17.239
another little tape you can do is to use
a cable release on your camera

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:20.480
all the self-timer if you polled the
shutter

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:24.510
when it's on wobbly sorta ground you
probably a blurred picture because you've  moved 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:26.459
the camera as you've fired the shutter 

00:02:26.459 --> 00:02:30.000
another bit of support I wanna 

00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:33.450
talk to you about briefly, is a monopod

00:02:33.450 --> 00:02:38.390
sorry guys, me squeazing through again, 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:42.470
here we go, again there are lot's to choose from erm let's have a look at this one 

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:46.019
as with everything I like the beefy
version now this is

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:49.870
really really lightweight and you can of
course strap that 

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:53.510
onto your backpack and just leave it
there because you might be out photographing 

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:55.470
and not have a tripod with you

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:58.610
if your tripod is in the boot of the car and you've got nothing 

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:02.400
a monopod can certainly help you out 

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:07.400
for me monopods have one big disadvantage, personally I'd rather carry the 

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:08.800
tripod up the side of a hill

00:03:08.860 --> 00:03:12.750
than use a monopod because if I've got my shots set up like this

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:17.500
and the Sun Goes in I might have to wait
20 minutes for it to come back out again

00:03:17.519 --> 00:03:21.659
I can't lock my shot off and leave it
because as soon as I walk away from the 

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:22.129
monopod

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:26.879
it's going to fall over isn't it, to me that's a bit pointless I'm afraid.

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:30.000
now the

00:03:30.019 --> 00:03:33.110
other part of the whole tripod, camera stability thing

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:37.290
is the head, tripods come in two parts. You've got the legs 

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:41.500
and you've also got the head now here's one over here, 

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:44.680
it's worth taking a bit of a look at 

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:48.159
the tripod heads you gonna spend about
the same amount of money on the head as

00:03:48.159 --> 00:03:48.989
you probably will 

00:03:48.989 --> 00:03:52.400
on the tripod itself you first thing to
look for

00:03:52.409 --> 00:03:57.030
is a quick release plate this one has
when you press that damn put a little

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:01.640
things forward and this little plate comes off now you can screw that 

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:04.900
into the bottom of your camera so it's permanently fixed there 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:09.140
which is really really useful because
you're out taking a shot this what I do

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:09.510
anyway

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:12.840
I'm often looking through the camera
lining up and taking a picture of you, i'm 

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:13.700
like this

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:18.009
and then I'll move my tripod in underneath the camera 

00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:21.380
and it's really easy just to put that on there 

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:24.780
and click the camera in place job done

00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:27.970
you don't wanna be fiddling around with
some screws and stuff when you're trying

00:04:27.970 --> 00:04:28.389
to get

00:04:28.389 --> 00:04:33.460
shot now one man's passion is another
man's poison

00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:36.850
I'm not gonna diss this tripod head because it's a beautifully made incredibly 

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:40.360
brilliant piece of kit but I don't like
it the reason

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:44.220
is, it's a pan and tilt. You have to undo this to turn it that way and 

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:47.430
you have to undo that to tilt it in another direction and like that 

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:50.889
in another direction but just because I don't like it 

00:04:50.889 --> 00:04:54.310
doesn't mean to say it's no good there
are many people I know who love using 

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:56.410
a pan and tilt head. 

00:04:56.410 --> 00:05:01.220
My preffered option is actually back round the other side, come and have a look.

00:05:01.220 --> 00:05:04.370
Sorry guy's I keep getting in your way, I do apolgise.

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:08.500
right these are all called ball heads

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:12.400
because as you can see here there is a
ball was part of the

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:15.440
the tripod head the reason I like them
is they're quick, 

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:20.220
you just release the ball you can put
the camera any position you like

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:23.770
and then lock it as you can see there's

00:05:23.770 --> 00:05:27.220
a little spirit level bubble here this
is really really useful for

00:05:27.220 --> 00:05:30.930
making sure your cameras level very
often if you looking at the scene you're

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:34.940
not quite sure what the horizons doing because if you've got hills going on 

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:38.310
and you try to line out you're not sure
that sometimes the fun it's not right

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:41.490
you can argue with the spirit level

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:45.889
now you can mix and match legs and heads just because you have a Manfrotto 

00:05:45.889 --> 00:05:49.009
tripod doesn't mean to say you have to
use a Manfrotto head

00:05:49.009 --> 00:05:53.470
I put these two together earlier because
these I i really like these

00:05:53.470 --> 00:05:58.729
this is a shotto tripod it's made of aluminium and it's very very sturdy 

00:05:58.729 --> 00:06:03.940
I like it but I mixed it with what is my
absolute favorite tripod head

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:07.360
this is even more favorite than the one that I use it's i'm tight so 

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:10.360
when the 1 I've got actually wears out I
will buy a new one this is called a

00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:12.530
pistol grip tripod.

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:16.919
As you can see from the top here there's a pistol grip,

00:06:16.919 --> 00:06:20.979
I just squeeze it line my camera up in
any direction I want

00:06:20.979 --> 00:06:25.800
anywhere let go and is locked in place
how quick and simples that?

00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:29.000
people say tripods slow you down, I say tripods slow you down 

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:33.009
but it doesn't have to slow you down in the composition, it's the thought process

00:06:33.009 --> 00:06:33.370
and

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:36.639
getting the shot right this also has

00:06:36.639 --> 00:06:41.210
a little quick release on the top here, so you can very quickly and easily 

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:46.069
take your tripod, take your camera on and off the tripod.

00:06:46.069 --> 00:06:50.069
so just to recap on lease if he's going
for tripod

00:06:50.069 --> 00:06:53.740
don't buy cheap make sure it's good and
steady

00:06:53.740 --> 00:06:58.000
this is an investment expect to spend at
least 200 pounds on a good

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.819
tripod you might be to find something
cheaper second-hand

00:07:01.819 --> 00:07:05.180
go to a shop and try these things out because you have to find the thing that works

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:05.870
for you

00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:10.199
but above all don't buy a wobbly tripod, if you're only thinking of spending 30

00:07:10.199 --> 00:07:10.729
quid

00:07:10.729 --> 00:07:14.449
forget it because it'll be completely useless and wobble around.

00:07:14.449 --> 00:07:18.650
it'll just be hopeless if you don't
believe it I have to say about this

00:07:18.650 --> 00:07:25.650
check out these guys.

00:07:27.569 --> 00:07:31.380
On a windy day like this a cheap tripod is going to wobble in the wind and

00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:35.330
create blurry pictures, so don't waste your money and invest in a good sturdy

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:36.030
tripod.

00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:39.200
One of the

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:42.880
most important things about buying a tripod and using a tripod 

00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:47.500
is to actually slow you down to really
make you consider your composition 

00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:50.940
to help you frame your pictures so you can get your horizon 

00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:54.550
straight and to get the important things in the frame, 

00:07:54.550 --> 00:07:57.900
the things you actually leave out as
important as the things you leave in.

00:07:57.900 --> 00:08:01.900
now it's important not buy cheap E as
the thing will just wobble around in the 

00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:02.400
wind

00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:06.570
and you'll knock it and it'll come out in your pictures so a decent tripod, strong legs 

00:08:06.570 --> 00:08:09.830
get yourself something like a ball and socket head they're easy to use 

00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:10.360
and you're on your way.
