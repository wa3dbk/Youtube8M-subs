Hi everyone! I’m Ryoya.

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:18.700
This is the 3rd video of Super Food month and I’ll show you how to make sweet using chia seeds.

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:26.120
Chia seed is kind of a new food getting popular this 4, 5 years.

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:31.460
And this is a seed of chia. Literally. Lol

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:45.440
There is lots of omega-3 which is essential fatty acid in it, so it may good for people who eat bad oils everyday.

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:59.040
There is a couple of ways to eat this, and as one of a way to eat this, chia seed form a gel around them like tapioca when they are soaked.

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:03.200
I’ll show you how to make dessert using that method.

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.940
I’m using dates as a sweetener.

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:21.640
This is called “Almond milk”
You can use soy milk or any other kind of milk instead.

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:59.560
let’s taste this.

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:08.420
Interesting.

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:18.520
I used almond milk this time so it was a little bit pain in the neck, But if you make this with soy milk, all you have to do is just blend. 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:29.780
I used dates but when using liquid sweetener, you won’t need blender. Just blend by hand and wait.

00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:39.880
It’s very easy and has lots of omega-3 so good for your body as well.

00:03:40.214 --> 00:03:42.214
Try this out if you like.

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:44.680
See you on next Monday!
