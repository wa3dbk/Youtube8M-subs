Hi Bev this is David Burns up here at
handy Toyota we spoke last night

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:09.429
briefly there in regards to this 2014
Sequoia so what I wanted to do just

00:00:09.429 --> 00:00:10.320
like we mentioned

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:13.900
was give you this YouTube video to Kind of go over the features and hopefully

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:14.460
give you

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:17.510
a different perspective of the vehicle I
mean luckily 

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:21.260
we do have the sun shining so you're
able to see a little bit of the fleck here

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:25.699
in the gray paint I like the gay its a nice light color not quite a white obviously

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:29.470
is it a little tone features wise the vehicle 

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:33.399
no problem seeing as you know nice fog
lights all that consist and you 

00:00:33.399 --> 00:00:34.380
carry-over

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:39.149
from a limited tundra the same kind of
rim style that you'll see on the

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:39.840
vehicle

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.079
now it is equipped with the running
board see you don't have any issue hopping

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:44.070
up there

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.140
and you also have your roof racks already installed

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:51.160
so you have all kinds of options there
that are already on the vehicle and I

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:53.590
know one of the things you are really
interested in

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:57.690
this vehicle had was going to be the
second row

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.180
of the captain's chair so as we kinda
come back you'll notice obviously this

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:04.470
is the grey leather interior light grey

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.760
and this is the really hard to find
captains chairs so

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.189
I'll swing around so you can continue to
have that perspective

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:16.130
and open the door up on the other side
just to kind of  give you you know a little bit of 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:17.070
the motions that

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:21.159
go on here with the adjustments and stuff you can kind of get different

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:24.159
adjustments with the armrests and find
yourself comfortable

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:28.070
there's also you know child safety here
with the latch system

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:32.530
on every seat so if you do have young
people or anything you need to have the

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:34.479
car seats for you have that option

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:37.590
so you do still have this backing now

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:41.450
what'll happen when you fold all these
seats down you can actually

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:46.240
bridge all the gaps that are created
with these mats here so you get a very

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:47.350
nice fold

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:51.790
flat feature in the vehicle to be able
to create maximum utility if you're

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:53.140
picking something up at a

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:57.380
you know large department store or something just
kinda wanted to give you that

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.170
perspective here of the seats

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:02.719
obviously as you know its hard to find
in this edition

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:06.869
and and just for you know giggles here
we'll go over some with the rear

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:10.450
comforts you have all kinds of different adjustments
there for a different size cups that are

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:11.209
really nice

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:14.810
you also have a couple different
adjustments for temperature control

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:16.690
control and comfort in the

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:20.970
rear section here so very nice to have
including the vents on top

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:27.970
now we're at the back of the vehicle
here and one also mentions I love the

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.390
feature you have the ability

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:35.459
from obviously the front from the driver
see to have this whole rear window just

00:02:35.459 --> 00:02:38.849
come down automatically which is a
really neat feature I think

00:02:38.849 --> 00:02:42.319
now you have a back-up camera on the
vehicle which is mounted right

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:43.349
underneath here

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:47.810
so you are able to see anything if your towing
 anything here see you have the

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:49.810
hitch as well as the plugins there

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:53.160
for that now I'm going to pop

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:57.440
open the trunk and show you that third
row seating right now

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:00.540
you do have a one-touch trunk release

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:04.989
you just have to have the vehicle fully
unlocked and  that will

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:08.080
open up automatically for you which is a
really nice feature

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:11.790
now the vehicles up really high and

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:15.720
you'll see you have all your all-weather
mats which are coming with the vehicle 

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:20.470
now I like the idea of just being able
to push a button basically

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:24.010
and you're able to fold down the seats
so you may already be aware that this is

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:25.590
what happens with these but

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:29.970
the headrests included everything is
automatic and it literally just falls

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:31.769
down flat the push of a button

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:36.090
and I have to say I mean obviously it's
the most accommodating third row in the

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:36.840
industry

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:41.340
being that it would fit a full size
adult very comfortably  not only with cup

00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:44.430
holders and additional storage a i mean
the seats are just

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:47.909
as comfortable as they possibly could be
so

00:03:47.909 --> 00:03:52.310
a ton of room here so what I'm utility
you have tie-downs all kinds of stuff

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:54.230
there to be able to use a few are

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:57.430
getting something at the store like we
talked about I mean

00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:01.549
I don't think I need to tell you how rugged
the vehicle as I just wanted to go ahead

00:04:01.549 --> 00:04:03.010
and give you the YouTube video

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:07.340
see if you like the gray on gray look
well as you know the captains charis are

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:09.140
really hard to find there in the second row

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:12.830
these are just wonderful vehicles and we
can have this cleaned up and delivered

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:14.260
to you if that's what you'd like

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:19.169
