00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.809
so this is the instructions for the

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:18.450
#10 open-end it's such a cool

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:19.470
invitation

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.330
it's perfect for those of you who have

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.580
lots of information and it also doesn't

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.250
use xyron machine so maybe that's a

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:29.099
little easier to and so here's my box

00:00:29.099 --> 00:00:34.050
I've got in the mail magnificent they do

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.660
such a lovely job and sending this stuff

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.050
out I'm always so impressed and you open

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.559
it up and here's all the stuff and and

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.490
you'll get a instruction

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:49.830
list and it will have your whole list of

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:51.180
what's in here but let me go through it

00:00:51.180 --> 00:00:51.990
with you

00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:54.900
so here is the decorative top layer

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:59.070
which is this and it's cut-to-size

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.260
remember that you don't have to cut

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:02.280
these at all

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.650
this is the back layer that is back

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.350
here and wraps all the way around to the

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:12.840
front and so that's these this is the

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:16.470
ribbon that goes here

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:17.880
although there are alternative

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.920
fastenings and I'll show you them on

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.840
this one but this invitation comes with

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:25.920
ribbon and then this is the all that

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.799
#10 open-end envelopes I could

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:30.090
count them to make sure

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.400
fifty-fifty excellence and this is the

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:35.340
paper which we're going to use to do the

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.950
invitation so now I can get rid of the

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:45.450
box and get to work

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.159
so now we're going to talk about the hard

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:50.409
part which is the computer part for

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:52.990
those of you who are younger than me it

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.240
won't be so hard but for me it's really

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.369
hard and I always have to rope in a

00:01:57.369 --> 00:01:59.590
friend to help me but these invitations

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:03.100
we've already formatted for god sakes

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:05.619
use scrap paper do all sorts of

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:07.599
trials I want you to be particular where

00:02:07.599 --> 00:02:10.090
of how the proportions are kinda strange

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:13.390
the top is very large and that's because

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:16.269
it's underneath here so you always have

00:02:16.269 --> 00:02:18.940
to think in terms of the body of the

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:23.620
invitation is down here rather than a

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:25.120
normal invitation where you can see the

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.640
whole thing so leave a great deal of

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.760
space up in the top after you format one

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.040
just put in place and you can check to

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:34.510
see whether or not it's a good one

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:37.299
so here they are and now we're going to

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:40.480
do some cutting because you never can

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:41.769
get away from the cutting part when

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:42.790
you're doing your own digital

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:48.080
invitations

00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:52.100
so here is the invitation again you

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:54.800
always want to get rid of the black line

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:59.000
and if you're if it's been printed

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.890
square you can just shove it up here in

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:03.320
that helps but that some printers aren't

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:05.090
perfectly square so it's always wise

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:06.230
just to look and make sure that that

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:11.780
black line shows and there you are

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:17.630
and as you see this part is tedious

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:20.300
but not hard

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:25.370
don't drink and cut my famous

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:28.850
words of advice you want to keep all

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:31.610
ten of your fingers notice I'm putting

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:33.230
my fingers on this to stabilize the

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:34.970
invitation you don't want it to slip

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:38.209
while you're cutting and now I've made

00:03:38.209 --> 00:03:44.960
the last part and we're ready to go

00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:48.800
so we've cut both layers now you notice

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:50.360
that they are different in different

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:53.030
lengths so it it has sort of a booklet

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:56.300
feel the most important thing now is

00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:00.380
to jog together so that and they all

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:03.170
come down to the very end you can fold

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:04.220
this over to make sure that everything

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:09.170
looks perfect and then you take a a pen

00:04:09.170 --> 00:04:14.960
and just put a little dot where the

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:18.080
whole punch should go then you can get rid

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:21.620
of your backing for a moment and take

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:25.730
out your hole punch and now we're going

00:04:25.730 --> 00:04:28.880
to punch those little suckers

00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:39.530
there's one there's one don't you love

00:04:39.530 --> 00:04:47.030
it and then there's the other one you

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:50.540
don't have to be exactly perfect and it

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:52.250
doesn't show it's completely covered

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:59.169
as you're about to see so here they are

00:04:59.169 --> 00:05:04.689
they're fairly close as I said now

00:05:04.689 --> 00:05:06.879
that I've tracked it's perfect and now

00:05:06.879 --> 00:05:08.349
i'm going to first do the ribbon one

00:05:08.349 --> 00:05:10.659
that's the solution for this invitation

00:05:10.659 --> 00:05:14.439
so with the instructions call for 8 inches

00:05:14.439 --> 00:05:17.139
so I'm going to mark out my eight inches

00:05:17.139 --> 00:05:23.710
and cut it and I like a little tapered

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:27.129
end and we're not tape with the other

00:05:27.129 --> 00:05:29.469
end just because by the time I've got

00:05:29.469 --> 00:05:31.180
the whole thing center I'm going to

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:33.819
probably have to cut we cut both ends so

00:05:33.819 --> 00:05:35.680
now the trick is to feed it

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:37.569
this is that the challenge on this

00:05:37.569 --> 00:05:39.249
invitation is to get it through these

00:05:39.249 --> 00:05:43.419
little holes so I always take it off

00:05:43.419 --> 00:05:46.330
like that and do it one at a time

00:05:46.330 --> 00:05:52.330
putting my invitation layers through and

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:55.449
then my top layer and then you start to

00:05:55.449 --> 00:05:56.889
work on the other side of the trick with

00:05:56.889 --> 00:06:00.729
that is to not lose these so that's done

00:06:00.729 --> 00:06:07.240
now I'm going to do this side as you can

00:06:07.240 --> 00:06:08.349
see this is probably the most

00:06:08.349 --> 00:06:15.129
time-consuming part of this invitation

00:06:15.129 --> 00:06:17.830
I don't know if you can see this very

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:21.669
well but it's you just go like that and

00:06:21.669 --> 00:06:23.529
then you have to kind of reach under

00:06:23.529 --> 00:06:27.580
here and attach it to the other other

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:28.839
three pieces

00:06:28.839 --> 00:06:31.869
okay so there we are

00:06:31.869 --> 00:06:35.469
and now it's complete this part and

00:06:35.469 --> 00:06:37.300
we're going to quickly slide it through

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:39.639
the front piece and we're ready to tie

00:06:39.639 --> 00:06:45.789
our little knot and there is enough

00:06:45.789 --> 00:06:49.659
ribbon in this kit for you to make a bow

00:06:49.659 --> 00:06:53.379
if you want and I'm that kind

00:06:53.379 --> 00:06:58.479
of girl I love knots so now comes a

00:06:58.479 --> 00:07:01.419
little knot if that helps if you have

00:07:01.419 --> 00:07:02.589
small fingers

00:07:02.589 --> 00:07:05.169
this is an issue to bring up with your

00:07:05.169 --> 00:07:06.819
parents

00:07:06.819 --> 00:07:11.949
here's my little knot and as you see my

00:07:11.949 --> 00:07:18.400
ends are all cooky and I just trim them

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:20.110
ok

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:27.490
and from the other one and it's all done

00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:29.560
isn't that the cutest thing and you see

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:32.680
the front one is all is all who is marrying who

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:36.970
and the back is where they are going to be married

00:07:36.970 --> 00:07:38.380
the back is where they're going to be

00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:46.330
married and it's a great invitation i

00:07:46.330 --> 00:07:51.210
think that was a dog barking

00:07:51.210 --> 00:07:54.270
it's a great invitation

00:07:54.270 --> 00:08:02.330
perfect timing
