00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:12.260
This week we�re starting a new series that
I�m calling Fancy Stitch Combos.

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:16.000
And in this series we�ll be taking the most
basic elements, like simple increases and

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.699
decreases and some other techniques, and combining
them together to make really different looking

00:00:20.699 --> 00:00:22.170
and pretty fabrics.

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:26.140
In this series, I of course want to show you
how to work the technique, but I also want

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:29.970
to show you what the fabric looks like, the
fabric you�re creating, looks like from

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.780
the back as well as the front, to help you
decide if you want to use this stitch in different

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:35.829
projects.

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:39.550
And I�ll let you know if the fabric�s
going to lie flat, or if it�s going to curl

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:41.150
up when it�s done.

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:44.500
Because you certainly don�t want to make
a scarf, or a dishcloth or something, out

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.910
of a stitch that�s going to curl up when
it�s finished.

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:48.480
You want it to be flat.

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.110
And this week we�re starting out with the
Purse Stitch.

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:54.860
And when you hear the name Purse Stitch, you
might be thinking, okay, that�s a stitch

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:56.840
that�s not going to have any give to it.

00:00:56.840 --> 00:01:01.640
It�s going to be a tight stitch with no
give, you can make a purse out of it and load

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.629
it up with heavy things and it will hold fast.

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:05.629
That�s not the case.

00:01:05.629 --> 00:01:08.450
It�s a totally stretchy stitch. I don�t
know why it�s called the Purse Stitch.

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:10.159
But it�s a very cool stitch!

00:01:10.159 --> 00:01:16.060
Let�s go ahead and take a look.

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:18.550
Here it is in a very bulky example.

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:22.240
This is knit with bulky yarn and size 10.5
US needles.

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:27.659
And it�s such a cool stitch! I love it when
a stitch lies flat, and it�s identical on

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:29.330
both sides.

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:34.900
So this would be appropriate for scarves,
dishcloths, placemats � anything that you

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:38.250
need to not curl, and lie flat.

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:39.800
And this is in a very bulky yarn.

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:44.920
You see that we have this horizontal stripe
running through it, and these little knots.

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:49.630
And after I knit this, I was pretty excited
to see it in different gauges.

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:54.410
And here it is in worsted weight yarn and
size 7 needles, I believe.

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:57.200
And I�ll show you a little trick I did here.

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:04.270
I tied a knot to tell me the size of the needles
I used. All I have to do is feel.

00:02:04.270 --> 00:02:07.850
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:08.850
Yes.

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:11.470
I used a size 7 needle on this swatch.

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.730
And in this example it is a little bit lacier.

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:19.840
The needle and yarn size is just different
enough where you can see the wholes in the

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:21.130
work a little bit better.

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:24.560
And, of course, again same on both sides.

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:28.370
And after I made this I thought, I want to
see this in a small gauge, with a little bit

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:29.950
of a shinier yarn.

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.120
And look how pretty this is!

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:37.230
And this one is knit with a one, two, three
size needle in DK weight yarn.

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:40.459
I really like the look of this.

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:41.830
Okay.

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:44.670
And I love it that it�s so simple!

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:49.300
The instructions for this stitch will be in
the video description below, as well as on

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:50.300
my website.

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:55.930
We�re going to start off with a regular
long-tail cast-on.

00:02:55.930 --> 00:03:00.569
And if you need a review of the long-tail
cast-on, I�ll give you a link right here.

00:03:00.569 --> 00:03:06.590
Regular, normal cast on. You want to cast
on an even number of stitches.

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:10.550
The first stitch is a selvedge edge, which
is going to be knit one.

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:14.599
The next stitch is a yarn over. And all you�re
going to do is pull the yarn forward between

00:03:14.599 --> 00:03:21.260
the two needles and work the next stitch,
which is slip-slip-knit, SSK.

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:25.720
And to work that stitch, you put your needle
in as if to knit, slip that stitch over without

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:31.500
working it, put your needle in the next stitch
as if to knit, slip that stitch over without

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:32.730
working it.

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:37.180
Then take the tip of your left needle, and
put it into the front of those two stitches.

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:41.709
Okay. We�re now in position to knit these
two stitches through the back loop.

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:47.080
And we have this yarn over. It�s going to
give us a loop on the needle here as we work

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:48.910
this next stitch.

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:52.459
Okay, that�s the whole stitch combination!

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:54.660
It�s yarn over, SSK.

00:03:54.660 --> 00:04:03.510
So I pull the yarn forward between the two
needles, SSK.

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:04.700
And that�s it.

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:11.180
If you need a review, a slower review, of
SSK, I�ll give you a link right here.

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:13.300
Yarn between the two needles.

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:22.140
Slip, slip, knit them through the back loop.

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:34.600
And you continue this all the way across your
work, until you have one stitch left, that�s

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:37.640
the other selvedge edge, you�re just going
to knit that stitch.

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:42.590
Then you turn the work, and do the same thing.

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:48.490
The first and last stitches are just knit,
then it�s yarn over, SSK the rest of the

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:50.330
way.

00:04:50.330 --> 00:05:00.500
Knit the first one, yarn over, SSK.

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:03.470
This stitch ends up going pretty quickly.

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:15.980
Meaning that it�s quick to work, and it
builds fabric pretty quickly.

00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:20.410
When you finish with this, getting it however
big you want it, you will just do a normal

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:24.790
bind off, nothing fancy.

00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:36.020
Whoops, I�m splitting the yarn here. Which
is good, because it reminds me of a couple

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:44.270
of other things I want to tell you!

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:48.000
If you�re a really tight knitter, you�re
going to benefit from super slick needles

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.520
to work this stitch.

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:56.300
After the first row, the SSK in the second
and all subsequent rows, involve using the

00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:58.620
yarn over in the SSK stitch.

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:02.010
You�re going to have a difficult time getting
your needle in there unless you�re using

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:05.840
sharp, metal needles if you�re a tight knitter.

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:09.140
Even someone who�s not a tight knitter might
benefit from those needles.

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:14.880
Also, this fabric � I showed you how it
looks in a few different yarn/needle combinations.

00:06:14.880 --> 00:06:19.740
But this takes on a much lacier look, the
bigger the needle, the finer the yarn.

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:20.889
Just something to keep in mind.

00:06:20.889 --> 00:06:25.520
Good luck.

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:34.259
[whooshing sounds]

00:06:34.259 --> 00:06:38.629
