00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:02.580
Well good morning from Paris.

00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.140
It is about eleven in the morning which means
it is time for either a second breakfast or

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:08.570
a first lunch.

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:13.320
So we've stopped off at a little Patisserie
and we picked up a little treat that we're

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:14.780
going to be sampling.

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:18.110
So here is my little bag.

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:23.900
First let me show you, they gave us cute cutlery,
wrapped in pink string.

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:25.220
Aw.

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:29.010
And today we're going to have be having something
called Croque-monsieur.

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:36.010
I'm going to show you what that looks like
in a second.

00:00:36.010 --> 00:00:44.300
As you can see over here the croque monsieur
looks a lot like a grilled cheese sandwich.

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:48.730
So it is just two slices of bread, ham and
cheese in the middle.

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:54.170
You can also have Bechamel sauce and then
there is more cheese over top and that has

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:57.680
been grilled and melted and it looks ooey
an gooey.

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:02.649
So I'm going to let Sam take the first bite
because I'm always eating the food first.

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:04.170
You sure are.

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:05.719
Here you go.

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:07.319
Alright, time to dig in.

00:01:07.319 --> 00:01:18.930
Wow, is that ever good.

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:24.549
Basically my best way of explaining this is
if you've ever had a grilled cheese before

00:01:24.549 --> 00:01:26.149
this is like a premier grilled cheese.

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:28.999
It has an extra layer of cheese on top.

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:34.669
Plus you get the ham in the middle and I just
love how I think they put a lot of maybe butter

00:01:34.669 --> 00:01:36.209
on the bread or on the toast.

00:01:36.209 --> 00:01:41.869
And it just gives it that greasiness that
makes it so tasty.

00:01:41.869 --> 00:01:43.270
And you're up next.

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:44.270
I sure am.

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:45.270
Mmm.

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:46.270
Oh yeah.

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:52.210
That is really good.

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:57.599
It makes such a nice snack.

00:01:57.599 --> 00:02:02.079
I mean you could have it as a meal but it
is also light enough to have as a snack in

00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:06.270
between meals too.

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:12.950
I don't really know what kind of cheese this
is but it is really really tasty.

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.829
If you know what kind of cheese they use in
these sandwiches let us know so I can pick

00:02:16.829 --> 00:02:17.951
some up in the grocery store.

00:02:17.951 --> 00:02:23.069
That is a lot of cheese.

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:24.900
Check it out.

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.819
An alternative sandwich to try, instead of
the croque-monsieur is the Croque-Madame.

00:02:29.819 --> 00:02:34.920
And that one is also a grilled cheese sandwich
but what they do is they put a fried egg right

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.609
on top of your sandwich.

00:02:36.609 --> 00:02:38.659
So it is a little more filling.

00:02:38.659 --> 00:02:43.280
Um, but yeah I think that is the kind of sandwich
that you probably want to order at a restaurant

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:44.610
when you're sitting down.

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:50.400
Otherwise it could get a little messy.

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:51.959
So these are about 3 to 4 Euros.

00:02:51.959 --> 00:02:56.099
You can pick them up in any French bakery,
a Patisserie, and the one tip that I want

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:58.319
to give you is ask them to warm it up.

00:02:58.319 --> 00:02:59.739
It tastes so much better that way.
