00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:14.960
The products we produce are
actually distributed worldwide. We have

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:19.900
product going into Hong Kong, Korea, Japan,

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:24.779
Saudi Arabia, and it's amazing that

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:28.789
these products can ship all the way from
Utah to these places

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:32.230
without refrigeration. Hi, my name's
Kelly Luthi, I'm the

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:35.860
general manager over the aseptic
division for Gossners Foods.

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:39.879
And aseptic is kinda a big word, but what
it really means is that we were able to

00:00:39.879 --> 00:00:44.040
manufacture milk and package it so that it
doesn't need refrigeration until it's

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:44.480
open.

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:47.910
Most parts of the world use that

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:52.590
as a normal consumer product. 
But in the U.S. because of our

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.800
refrigerated distribution systems,

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.449
most milk that we drink is
consumed out of a gallon jug.

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:02.329
What I really like about this job is the
the fact that

00:01:02.329 --> 00:01:06.251
we're one of only a handful of plants 
in the United States that do this.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:09.600
So we're on the forefront of technology.

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:13.510
It's fascinating to be able to

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:17.170
look at how shelf stable milk can

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:20.229
affect the lives of people who don't
have refrigeration.

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:25.479
People who through natural
disasters such as hurricanes or

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:26.280
earthquakes

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.060
actually have access to milk where
otherwise, they wouldn't.

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.159
Some of the skills you need to be
able to manage

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:36.710
any food plant: number one I think you
have to believe in the product, you have

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:37.250
like it.

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:41.619
You have to believe that it's a 
product that other people will like.

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:45.930
You also have to be organized, you have
to be able to communicate.

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.930
There's all sorts of employee
issues you need to be able to

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:53.420
communicate with those 
employees and let them know

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.799
the things that are acceptable or not
acceptable.

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:00.060
I love living here in Cache Valley.

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:03.200
When I'm not here working, you'll find me

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:07.450
typically on the golf course or
following whatever Aggie sport is going

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:07.950
on at the time.
