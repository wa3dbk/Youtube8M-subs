00:00:10.367 --> 00:00:13.000
JULIE:
Hi there, I'm Julie Davis
for Blick Art Materials.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.200
In the 1800s, many pioneer
and Civil War era homes

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:18.800
were decorated
with something called

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.833
a penny carpet,
or a penny rug,

00:00:20.833 --> 00:00:24.000
made from stitched together
pieces of recycled fabric.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.933
One story says
they were called penny carpets

00:00:26.933 --> 00:00:29.300
because the designer
traced around a penny

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:30.767
to make a perfect circle,

00:00:30.767 --> 00:00:34.200
and some say they were stitched
with a penny in each patch,

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.933
to make it lay flat.

00:00:35.933 --> 00:00:38.867
Let's make a modern day
penny carpet today,

00:00:38.867 --> 00:00:41.033
based on the pioneer's ideas,

00:00:41.033 --> 00:00:42.833
but we're going to
alter it just enough

00:00:42.833 --> 00:00:44.700
to make it
a piece of fabric art.

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:47.567
We'll incorporate
print making, painting,

00:00:47.567 --> 00:00:50.433
markers, and of course, sewing.

00:00:50.433 --> 00:00:52.933
The first thing we need
is a piece of fabric.

00:00:52.933 --> 00:00:57.567
I have an 8x10 piece
of unbleached muslin here.

00:00:57.567 --> 00:01:00.100
It's very versatile,
inexpensive,

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:01.400
and easy to work with.

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.500
It has this lovely neutral tone.

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:05.467
I've ironed this one
just to make sure that

00:01:05.467 --> 00:01:07.500
the wrinkles are out.

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.600
We need also to
have something available

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.000
to make a print,

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:12.100
and if you visit our website,

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:14.600
we'll tell you how to
make a printing plate

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:18.233
from acrylic gel medium,
like this piece you see here.

00:01:18.233 --> 00:01:20.133
it acts like a stamp.

00:01:20.133 --> 00:01:22.733
Paint it up, and press it down.

00:01:22.733 --> 00:01:25.000
But for our demo purposes today,

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.767
we're going to simplify
just a little bit,

00:01:26.767 --> 00:01:30.867
and use a material
called print foam.

00:01:30.867 --> 00:01:33.933
True to its name,
it's foam for printing.

00:01:33.933 --> 00:01:35.567
It's coated to receive

00:01:35.567 --> 00:01:37.667
and release colour
very smoothly.

00:01:37.667 --> 00:01:39.067
Speaking of colour,

00:01:39.067 --> 00:01:41.600
we're going to be
using something called

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.967
Jacquard Textile Colours,

00:01:43.967 --> 00:01:46.667
developed to be
very permanent on fabric.

00:01:46.667 --> 00:01:50.967
I've cut my print foam
into a free form shape,

00:01:50.967 --> 00:01:52.267
as you see here.

00:01:52.267 --> 00:01:53.967
Any shape that
you'd like it to be.

00:01:53.967 --> 00:01:56.800
First, I'm going to texturise it

00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:00.433
with some
wooden modelling tools.

00:02:00.433 --> 00:02:02.133
I want to create some lines

00:02:02.133 --> 00:02:07.833
and some patterns by
embossing it as you see here.

00:02:07.833 --> 00:02:14.633
I can use a thinner tool
to make some thinner lines,

00:02:14.633 --> 00:02:16.767
perhaps some cross hatching,

00:02:16.767 --> 00:02:26.367
and a bit of a thicker tool
to make stippling textures,

00:02:26.367 --> 00:02:31.733
or large areas of embossing.

00:02:31.733 --> 00:02:33.867
Once I get it
to where I'd like it,

00:02:33.867 --> 00:02:36.367
now it's time
to apply the paint.

00:02:36.367 --> 00:02:41.600
A foam brush
works really well

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:43.267
for applying the paint.

00:02:43.267 --> 00:02:46.300
We'll just brush it
right onto the print foam here.

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:52.667
it doesn't try very quickly,
so you don't need to rush it,

00:02:52.667 --> 00:02:57.067
but you can't drag it on
too much, either.

00:02:57.067 --> 00:03:04.733
Let's just apply a few colours,
apply it rather thickly,

00:03:04.733 --> 00:03:07.033
and the next thing
I'm going to do

00:03:07.033 --> 00:03:09.500
is use something called
a colour shaper.

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.367
These have a
rubber tip at the end,

00:03:12.367 --> 00:03:14.767
and they are
developed for precisely

00:03:14.767 --> 00:03:20.033
what I'm doing right here:
removing some areas of colour.

00:03:20.033 --> 00:03:23.167
They come in a set
with some different shapes,

00:03:23.167 --> 00:03:26.667
so you can get
different results.

00:03:26.667 --> 00:03:28.200
Okay.

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:30.433
Once I get this
to where I'd like it,

00:03:30.433 --> 00:03:32.200
I'm going to try
and make a print,

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:34.800
so I'll move my piece of
muslin back up here.

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:37.400
I'm going to
turn it over gently,

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:38.900
and lay it in a corner,

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:42.200
then I'm going to
press down firmly.

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:44.100
With my hands.

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:47.000
Just firm, even pressure.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.567
Like so.

00:03:49.567 --> 00:03:53.633
Now, let's left it
and look what we have.

00:03:53.633 --> 00:03:55.333
That's a pretty nice print.

00:03:55.333 --> 00:03:59.200
I could go back now
and ink this up,

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:03.000
apply some more colour again,
do another print on top of that,

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.700
just get a little more
contrast into it if I'd like,

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:09.967
but for now I'm going to
set this aside to dry.

00:04:09.967 --> 00:04:12.867
And I'm going to
bring out a piece here

00:04:12.867 --> 00:04:17.900
that's already dry
and has been cut down to shape.

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:19.900
Now this looks
pretty good as it is,

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:21.667
but I'd kind of like to
go back in there

00:04:21.667 --> 00:04:23.933
and define some more
of the shapes,

00:04:23.933 --> 00:04:26.800
so I'm going to use
a fabric marker.

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:29.633
These are FabricMate
Super Fine Markers.

00:04:29.633 --> 00:04:31.800
As you can see
they have a brush tip

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:34.300
so I can get
some very fine lines,

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:37.067
I can also turn it
over on its side

00:04:37.067 --> 00:04:42.067
and get some
very broad lines as well.

00:04:42.067 --> 00:04:43.267
Alright.

00:04:43.267 --> 00:04:46.167
So once I've touched that up
just to where I want it,

00:04:46.167 --> 00:04:49.400
that's one complete print.

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:51.167
I can make as many of these
as I wanted to

00:04:51.167 --> 00:04:52.533
to make a penny carpet,

00:04:52.533 --> 00:04:54.900
but I'm going to limit it
to just a few,

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:56.933
because there's a lot more
work to be done.

00:04:56.933 --> 00:05:01.867
Next, I lay my fabric design
onto a piece of felt.

00:05:01.867 --> 00:05:06.533
Then I'm going to
take one of these markers

00:05:06.533 --> 00:05:10.067
and I'm going to trace a line
a quarter of an inch

00:05:10.067 --> 00:05:14.267
to perhaps half an inch away
from the edge of the muslin,

00:05:14.267 --> 00:05:16.033
and then I'm
going to cut it out,

00:05:16.033 --> 00:05:21.067
as I've done with
this piece right here.

00:05:21.067 --> 00:05:22.900
The next step will be to take

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:26.100
a contrasting piece
of fabric or felt,

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:28.567
and make one more layer
the same way.

00:05:28.567 --> 00:05:30.467
So here's what we have:

00:05:30.467 --> 00:05:34.400
Three layers equals one cell
for the penny carpet.

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:37.433
And the next step is sewing,

00:05:37.433 --> 00:05:40.767
so get out the needle,
and embroidery floss.

00:05:40.767 --> 00:05:43.933
I have loaded this needle

00:05:43.933 --> 00:05:46.900
with about three strands
of embroidery floss.

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:50.233
And I like to choose
a contrasting colour,

00:05:50.233 --> 00:05:52.000
so I have a bright orange.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.400
A simple stitch
from the back side

00:05:55.400 --> 00:06:04.700
to the front, and back again,
secures the muslin to the felt.

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:08.367
Repeat that
from the first layer of felt

00:06:08.367 --> 00:06:10.833
to the second layer of felt,

00:06:10.833 --> 00:06:14.067
and that secures
all three pieces together.

00:06:14.067 --> 00:06:17.533
You'll keep going
all the way around this cell.

00:06:17.533 --> 00:06:20.033
Don't worry if it's not perfect.

00:06:20.033 --> 00:06:22.100
It doesn't need to be,

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:24.600
and you can also use other
embroidery stitches too

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:26.933
to mix it up and make it fun.

00:06:26.933 --> 00:06:29.100
Here's some finished cells.

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:32.100
I'm going to just lay them down
the way that I'd like

00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:36.333
my carpet to stitch together.

00:06:36.333 --> 00:06:39.333
And then you'll come back with
the embroidery floss and stitch

00:06:39.333 --> 00:06:40.867
just along the edges,

00:06:40.867 --> 00:06:42.667
just to get them
to stay together.

00:06:42.667 --> 00:06:45.467
Now a carpet like this
can be finished,

00:06:45.467 --> 00:06:47.133
but if you want to
display it on the wall,

00:06:47.133 --> 00:06:48.700
you just mount it to a piece of

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:50.833
colourful foam board
or cardboard,

00:06:50.833 --> 00:06:53.967
or even heavy felt
for strength.

00:06:53.967 --> 00:06:55.833
There's a number of
options you can consider.

00:06:55.833 --> 00:06:57.800
Instead of using the print foam,

00:06:57.800 --> 00:07:00.767
you could stamp,
or block print the muslin,

00:07:00.767 --> 00:07:02.400
or simply paint directly on it.

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:04.667
You can embellish
your penny carpet

00:07:04.667 --> 00:07:07.367
by adding buttons, beads,
and other materials,

00:07:07.367 --> 00:07:08.967
and if you're
working with young children

00:07:08.967 --> 00:07:10.767
who may not be able
to handle the needle,

00:07:10.767 --> 00:07:13.300
the pieces can
simply be glued together,

00:07:13.300 --> 00:07:16.067
and in the tradition of
a true penny carpet,

00:07:16.067 --> 00:07:18.733
you can also
recycle fabric scraps,

00:07:18.733 --> 00:07:21.867
as in this example
using recycled denim.

00:07:21.867 --> 00:07:26.167
DickBlick.com is the place
to find all of these materials

00:07:26.167 --> 00:07:27.500
and thousands more.

00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:29.667
There's a printable copy
of this lesson plan

00:07:29.667 --> 00:07:31.533
and a list of
teaching standards

00:07:31.533 --> 00:07:33.933
so you can see how
this project is developed

00:07:33.933 --> 00:07:35.733
for visual arts education.

00:07:35.733 --> 00:07:37.967
Thanks so much
for joining us today.

00:07:37.967 --> 00:07:40.500
I hope you enjoy making
your own penny carpet.
