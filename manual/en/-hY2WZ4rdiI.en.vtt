00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:20.230
New Vulcan S for 2015

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:24.340
It's a whole new cruiser for Vulcan

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:29.330
it has the 650 Ninja twin cylinder
engine 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:32.810
down tuned so that you have higher mid

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:36.100
range torque. Easier on a

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:40.950
learner rider perhaps. It's very low,
we have a 28"

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:44.230
seat height, initial height.

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:48.280
This machine has been designed for
adjustability

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:52.780
so we can actually have a very short
rider

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:57.309
have a specific seat, footpeg position,

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:02.729
and handlebar to adjust perfectly to
that person. We can then adjust

00:01:02.729 --> 00:01:07.590
for a medium 6' guy, we can adjust for
an even taller guy.

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.890
We have three different seats;

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.300
short, medium, and long. We have 3

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:19.130
position foot pegs within three and a
half inches of adjustment front to back

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:20.720
and

00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:27.490
adjustable levers, some people are very
short fingers. We can bring the levers back 

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:32.030
so the adjustment on this machine for each
individual rider

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:37.470
so we had 3 specific adjustments; short, medium, and long

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:42.790
but we can mix and match any component for an
individual

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:46.150
some short people may want the

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:49.980
longer handle bars, some short people may want a shorter handle bar

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:53.500
so we have all these myriad of
adjustments to actually

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:59.760
tailor this bike to an individual, rather
than that guy going off  and being a little

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:02.160
upset with where the pegs are

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:07.590
 of if the seat is not quite forward enough
for me near the tank. We can actually now

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:11.160
now individually tailor it, and

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.170
it has the 650 twin cylinder engine. Very
good performance

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:18.260
for a cruiser, sits low,

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:21.590
long, very stable and

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:24.900
we're very excited about this machine and

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:29.269
very competitively priced. We have

00:02:29.269 --> 00:02:36.269
a $7,399 base price and a myriad of accessories. We can

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:43.299
actually have a passenger seat added, a back rest, detachable bags, 

00:02:43.299 --> 00:02:44.010
and a windshield.

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:47.750
Easily detachable. So it's a very
versatile

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:52.150
cruiser and so we're very excited about the
individuality

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:59.150
for each person to be tailored to the
Vulcan S
