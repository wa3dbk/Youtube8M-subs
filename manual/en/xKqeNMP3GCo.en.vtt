00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
GxP HoN Song (also JPF diss)

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:12.000
I wake up every day at 2PM

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
and any chance i get i am on that game

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
playin hon with my friends

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
wastin' our youth sippin goon and pwning noobs

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:20.066
thats all we do

00:00:20.066 --> 00:00:22.066
and if you happen to be on, on a sunday night

00:00:22.066 --> 00:00:25.033
than you better be ready for a team fight

00:00:25.033 --> 00:00:26.066
because it's inhouse time

00:00:26.066 --> 00:00:29.033
and GxP knows ElviiK's head is on the line

00:00:29.033 --> 00:00:30.000
(as usual)

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.066
we got si picking pebbles

00:00:32.066 --> 00:00:34.066
heading mid with a bottle

00:00:34.066 --> 00:00:36.066
and who knows what alphasibene

00:00:36.066 --> 00:00:38.000
is gonna pick this time

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.000
but we all know he's gonna cry

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.066
like every other time

00:00:40.066 --> 00:00:43.000
at Eshr or Scroob, being noobs

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.000
bottom lane's already fed 0-2

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.033
and we're only 40 seconds in

00:00:48.033 --> 00:00:51.066
this game's gonna end with someone rage 
quitting

00:01:10.033 --> 00:01:12.033
We know JPF is full of scrubs..

00:01:12.033 --> 00:01:15.033
like ChuppaChup who spends his monday nights 
testing bugs

00:01:15.033 --> 00:01:17.000
for S2 like a loser

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.033
and his maliken game is sub-par

00:01:19.033 --> 00:01:23.033
and don't think we'll forget all those nights that 
you cried on the microphone

00:01:23.033 --> 00:01:25.066
(and your bed time is 9 or so)

00:01:25.066 --> 00:01:29.000
i think you and ElviiK should head back to 
runescape

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
where you can play at your own pace

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.000
where you don't have to face 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.066
the GxP warriors

00:01:34.066 --> 00:01:35.033
In the forests

00:01:35.033 --> 00:01:36.000
of caldavar

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.033
or home for the last three years....

00:01:39.033 --> 00:01:40.033
and many more to come.

00:02:00.033 --> 00:02:04.033
Phury 2012 (best tempest in game)
and oph
