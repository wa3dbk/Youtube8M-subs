&gt;&gt; Marc Gagnon: My name
is Marc Gagnon and I work

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:32.930
as a mechanical engineer
for Tesla Motors in Fremont.

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:35.740
We make electric
cars, the nicest,

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:39.630
coolest electric
cars in the world.

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:42.440
It's a, you know, a zero
emission [inaudible]

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.940
but it's also like
high performance car.

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:50.930
It's really a nice product that
we're bringing to the world.

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:53.970
It makes it really
exciting to work at Tesla.

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:58.390
I'm in charge of the structure
of the two doors on the car,

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:03.690
the Model S and the future Model
X. So all the sheet metal parts

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:09.060
and the extrusions, that's what
I'm in charge of right now.

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.490
I work at the factory
on the design floor

00:01:12.490 --> 00:01:14.070
but we're real close
to manufacturing

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.170
so any time there's a
problem on the line, you know,

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:21.510
they call us, we go
and see what's going on

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:24.890
and then we propose an
engineering modification

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:26.450
or design solution

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:29.620
to [inaudible] problems
that happen.

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:33.670
I'm especially learning how
to deal with multiple projects

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:37.600
at the same time or
multiple tasks, you know,

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.490
when you're an engineer,
you're a problem solver

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:43.860
and when you design a new
product, there are a lot

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.450
of little problems to be fixed

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.300
so that's what we
do on a daily basis.

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:50.590
You know, Tesla has
an office in Palo Alto

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:53.570
and the manufacturing plant
is in Fremont so, you know,

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:57.330
San Jose's right in between the
two and it made a lot of sense

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:00.100
to come to San Jose State
and it was the right choice

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:01.860
and it was a great experience.

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.240
I think it's part of, you know,
Silicon Valley people coming

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:07.200
from all over the
world to work here.

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:09.790
And, you know, people that
come here are, you know,

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:13.970
are very motivated about being
here and they want to work hard

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:16.480
to make it happen and it's
just a great, you know,

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:21.510
work environment to learn
and to challenge yourself.
