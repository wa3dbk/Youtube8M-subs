00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:10.110
Ladies and gentleman,
I am holding in my hand

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:13.650
the LG HB620T cell phone.
And let me tell you,

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:17.990
this sucka is packing heat.
It's got lots of features. Lots of 'em.

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:19.730
And I'm gonna tell you
all about it.

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:22.360
First of all, we have 
a 2.0 megapixel camera.

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:25.330
This is great, great to have.
And when you open up the phone

00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:28.530
you'll see that there's
also an internal camera, right here.

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:30.800
Now, this is great for
video conferencing.

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:32.370
Now, my phone doesn't have 
video conferencing.

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:35.510
But, this one does,
which is pretty cool.

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.640
Now, this phone has Mobile TV.
And these three  buttons, right here,

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:41.010
control the Mobile TV.
Now, before I go any further

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.680
I want to tell you that the 
Mobile TV only works in Europe.

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:47.750
It's on their standard network,
which is actually, you know, 

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:49.580
well, what can you do?
What can you do about that?

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.850
But, go to Europe. Hey!
Are you planning a vacation?

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:56.090
I hear they have really 
great deals on flights these days.

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:00.490
So, check it out. Alright,
moving right along you'll see,

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:04.100
once we power up the phone,
that this okay button,

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:06.430
this is how you get 
to the main navigation page.

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.700
And all these buttons,
they're Hot Keys.

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:11.810
They're flat, they're easy to press.

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.670
And, if you're multi-tasking,
have a lot going on,

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:17.090
it's easy to punch out
somebody's number.

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:20.380
Alright, our phone is still loading,
so, here we go.

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:22.950
Ooh, oh, it makes pretty noises,
as well.

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:26.620
So, we're gonna go into the menu
page, and I'm gonna show you

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:29.160
everything this phone 
has to offer.

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.760
So, it has Mobile TV, right here,
like I was telling you about.

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:35.460
You scroll down and you go into
your multimedia icon.

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:36.930
And you have everything.
You have your camera.

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:38.660
You have your video camera,
your music,

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.770
your video play list,
and your voice recorder.

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.400
Pretty neat stuff.
Then you can also have...

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:45.470
You can download games.

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:47.680
You can download games.
You can download apps.

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:49.610
You can surf the web.
You have your calendar.

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:52.840
You can text message.
You can set up your E-mail on here.

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.720
And it comes equipped
 with Bluetooth 2.0.

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:00.520
So, that means it's faster,
and it's better than ever before.

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:04.030
The numbers are pretty large.
So, let's say you're multi-tasking.

00:02:04.220 --> 00:02:07.020
Let's say you're talking to mom,
but you're cooking,

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:09.860
or you're doing laundry,
or you're going for a jog, 

00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:11.930
whatever you're doing,
the numbers are pretty large

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.770
so you'll be able to punch out 
somebody's phone number pretty easily.

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:20.440
Alright, so, turn it over to the side
and you have your volume controls,

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:26.410
and on the other side you have your  
Shutterfly button for your camera.

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:31.680
And you also have your power and 
your headset button,

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:33.760
which is great.
Now, this is a flip phone.

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:36.450
Okay, you know what that means?
Let me tell you what that means.

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:39.460
It's a flip phone, so that means
no more butt dialing.

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.260
No butt dialing. 
Whoo-hoo!

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.360
And no purse dialing.
What more could you ask for?

00:02:45.770 --> 00:02:50.140
Remember, if you're in Europe,
and you want to watch Mobile TV,

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:53.210
look at this. Wait, wait.
Wait for it.

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:57.410
Yup, we have connection baby, yes.
This antenna will work for you.

00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:01.140
And this antenna also will help you get
radio on the phone, which is pretty neat.

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.460
And, don't forget that this is an
unlocked phone.

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:05.950
So, you need to get 
a SIM card.

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:08.490
SIM card goes
in the back by the battery.

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.660
So you just open up
 the battery, like so.

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:15.630
Take off the cover.
Gotta take out the battery,

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:18.330
and you'll see here
 is the slot for the SIM card.

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:20.460
This  you can get
from your service provider.

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:23.870
And up above, you'll see this is where
the microSD chip goes.

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:25.730
And this will give you
extra storage.

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:28.380
So, let's just put everything
back together.

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:30.710
I think we're all done here.
So, here you go.

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:35.250
You got it. It's the LG HB620T Phone.
See ya lata.

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:40.220

 the LG HB620T Cell Phone,

00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:42.190
