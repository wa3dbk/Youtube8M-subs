00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:07.160
In this clip I will show you the slender version
of the five-pointed star. This is again a

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:16.430
design by Nick Robinson, and it can be found
in his book, "The Encyclopedia of Origami."

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:25.539
So starting with the same base as our five-pointed
star, we are going to narrow it, making it

00:00:25.539 --> 00:00:39.729
slender by folding this edge into the center.
Fold that edge into the center,

00:00:39.729 --> 00:00:47.440
and same thing with this. Oh, I'm sorry, forgot
one step. This raw edge up here we are going

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:58.390
to fold down, so that it meets this crease
right here. Fold it down, and then we are

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:14.040
going to narrow it by folding this edge into
the center. And you will notice on top there

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:22.530
that you have this extra little flap. Just
fold it over along this edge, and then tuck

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:30.880
it underneath in between the two layers. And
then proceed with the same steps that we had

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:38.010
in the for the regular five-pointed star.
Turn the unit to the other side, fold it along

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:57.190
the existing crease, and then fold it horizontally
like that, so that this edge ideally, this

00:01:57.190 --> 00:02:08.110
edge, ideally would meet up with this edge.
And there is, here is, oh, and then valley

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:09.669
fold it down the middle.
