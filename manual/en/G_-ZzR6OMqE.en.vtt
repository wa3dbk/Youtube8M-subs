00:00:00.789 --> 00:00:05.100
Since 1970, Adidas has been designing the
balls for the FIFA

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:06.180
World Cup.

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.980
Our question: what does mathematics say about
these designs?

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:15.049
First, we need to understand the five Platonic
solids:

00:00:15.049 --> 00:00:23.140
the tetrahedron, the cube, the octahedron,
the dodecahedron, and the icosahedron.

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:26.040
Each of these solids have
congruent faces.

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:30.230
For example, the cube has six
square faces and each corner is met by three

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:33.990
edges,
while the icosohedron has 20 triangular faces

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:36.330
and each corner
connects 5 edges.

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:39.010
The structure of the World Cup balls are each
based

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:41.180
on one of these Platonic solids.

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:46.020
The Telstar, introduced in 1970, is the classical
design with its 12

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:49.370
black pentagons and 20 white hexagons.

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:53.110
It's not a Platonic
solid, but it's one step away.

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:54.230
Start with an icosohedron.

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:58.350
Pick a corner, divide its connecting edges
into thirds, mark a

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.330
pentagon, then cut off the corner.

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:04.659
Doing this to each of the 12 corners creates
12 new pentagonal faces.

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:07.500
Pumping it up produces the Telstar.

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.180
Now look at the next 8 World Cup balls --- the
Telstar Durlast,

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:16.250
the Tango, the Tango Espana, the Azteca,
the Etrusco Unico, the Questra, the Tricolore,

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:19.700
and
the Fevernova.

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:23.590
Although they have different printed patterns,
the physical panels with

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:29.120
20 hexagons and 12 pentagons is the same as
the 1970 Telstar.

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:33.220
This all changed with the 2006 Teamgeist in
Germany.

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:37.210
It has 6
dumbell-shaped panels and 8 propeller shapes.

00:01:37.210 --> 00:01:40.950
Unlike the Telstar's panels which are stitched
together, the

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:43.030
Teamgeist's panels are thermally bonded.

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:46.570
This ball received criticism because of its
erratic flight.

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:50.140
How is the Teamgeist made from a Platonic
solid?

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:51.420
Start with a cube.

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:57.170
Like before, pick a corner, divide the connecting
edges into thirds, then slice off the corners.

00:01:57.170 --> 00:02:00.070
Doing this to each corner produces the truncated
cube

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:02.790
with 6 octogons and 8 triangles.

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.790
To get the Teamgeist, identify each octogon
with

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:10.659
a dumbell-shaped panel and each triangle with
a propeller shape.

00:02:10.659 --> 00:02:14.269
Reshaping the panels and inflating it produces
the Teamgeist.

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:18.150
And don't be fooled by a fake Teamgeist which
prints the Teamgeist

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:20.799
pattern onto a Telstar design.

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:25.749
In 2010, the South African World Cup introduced
the Jabulani.

00:02:25.749 --> 00:02:31.349
While a casual look suggests that there are
many panels, there are really only 8: 4 round

00:02:31.349 --> 00:02:33.730
panels
and 4 propellers.

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:38.279
This ball was also criticized for
"beach ball"-like flight, possibly due to

00:02:38.279 --> 00:02:39.659
its shallow seams.

00:02:39.659 --> 00:02:44.290
For its design, start with the tetrahedron
and truncate the four corners

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:49.529
to produce four triangular faces and four
hexagonal faces.

00:02:49.529 --> 00:02:52.019
Identifying the triangles with the ovals and
the

00:02:52.019 --> 00:02:57.569
hexagons with the propellers, then reshaping
produces the Jabulani.

00:02:57.569 --> 00:03:02.349
This brings us to the 2014 Brazuca debuted
in Brazil.

00:03:02.349 --> 00:03:07.549
Named by the fans, this ball has only six
panels, the fewest yet.

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:10.959
These six propellers correspond to the faces
of a cube.

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:13.659
The
propellers don't overlap just like the faces

00:03:13.659 --> 00:03:15.319
of the cube don't overlap.

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:18.769
You can also see this connection from the
seams; three seams

00:03:18.769 --> 00:03:23.299
meet at a corner just like three edges meet
at each corner of a cube.

00:03:23.299 --> 00:03:27.620
Reshaping the squares into the propellers
produces the Brazuca.

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:30.599
So with all of these different balls, which
one is YOUR favorite?
