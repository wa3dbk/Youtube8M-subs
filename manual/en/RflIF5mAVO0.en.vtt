'em 23rd 2009 we have

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.599
Kaylee base okay so Kaylee would you

cross your arms over your chest come on
doctor Matt

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:34.180

through yeah what isn't okay

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.969
is to see the internal rotation there

00:01:00.969 --> 00:01:04.860
on for left side which is interesting
hurry

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.820
so watch the center here right and

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.310
first watchin homes watch convergence
again

00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:17.340
yeah okay right there

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.490
alright and now why just watch this some

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:25.450
I and towards the right allowed sorry
started

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:28.729
decrease how short film that I'll tell
you didn't know mahany

00:01:28.729 --> 00:01:32.100
there's little there is a lot less
there's a lot less okay

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.570
like it now I keep film now aren't you
sconce years ahead straight again

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.640
and then look at this time miss on

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.790
missile ha

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:46.610
shaved ice is at least 50 percent
improvement travel no

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:50.909
its it's like on kill myself but I
didn't do the the ps3 because

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:54.060
it's like 100 percent driven I

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:57.470
so second time post sokaya training for
the right cell

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:04.470
cerebellum soon she's simple she lookin
right here in the center

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.950
okay in from here here here

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:15.550
well now since we test the current
services post

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:19.050
neurological stimulation above the right
circle on

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:22.110
go ahead and put your eyes open start
marching place

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:25.720
keep it that high

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:32.720
now Justin and close your eyes I'll

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:37.150
barely internally rotating and wish you
the same thing again with

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:42.970
the shoe lift-off now she goes longer it
starts to the vehicle

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:47.769
into okay quality go ahead

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:52.140
detailed eyes overs

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:55.730
eyes open for Scrabble Tahoe every
there's a long

00:02:55.730 --> 00:03:00.300
X slows old

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:03.480
alright

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:08.810
and go head back to start months to it

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:13.300
and eyes closed

00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:17.310
Hill yeah I remove the hell

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:20.959
there is a must but old

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:24.590
awesome create very nice when

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:28.440
come on in narrative contest in with the
lift the shoes of you could see

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:32.090
the difference in the shoot lifts I is
there

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:35.410
alright so go ahead again

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:41.129
cross arms eyes open start marching
place alright

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:47.290
and eyes closed so now we can see the
deviation

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:51.950
well in the internal internal year not
not much into recession this is

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:55.519
20 at like 75 percent ninety percent
better

00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:58.920
really that she's ever done awesome in

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:02.040
okay so now

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.440
when you look at the prime Kaylee we've
got different parts of it

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:09.049
we have fun parts that sit down here in
the back

00:04:09.049 --> 00:04:13.440
and it's clear cerebellum hey remember
when I had your arm up like this I said

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:14.769
resist as I push down

00:04:14.769 --> 00:04:18.639
all thats the cerebellar response from
you resist

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:22.270
whole is in the signals tells your body
to make this muscle strong

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:26.800
and now on top of that there's this
little tense and the fire

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:29.960
and there's two has and csi: you have
one side

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:33.880
brainchild inside office in this culture

00:04:33.880 --> 00:04:37.930
cerebral cortex and that's the part that
we were testing I said hold your arm up

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:41.410
and bike down and push up into my hand
and

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:44.479
nothing there now relax your job push up
by hand

00:04:44.479 --> 00:04:48.550
are and it's nice and strong there
that's because

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:51.650
red compression is affecting frontal

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:55.150
cerebral cortex you're happy lack of
initiation modern-looking

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:59.190
when you bite down that's that criminal
dental compression or no value

00:04:59.190 --> 00:05:04.190
the eye care that's like so we were just
stimulating was

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:08.590
the right partners your cerebellum pass
the reactionary force

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:11.780
did that by Stanley rising Turner

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:14.189
and that helps you else yeah

00:05:14.189 --> 00:05:17.860
when you walk now don't do not exercise
all the time

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:21.449
sentencing chains okay and then we'll
figure out how often

00:05:21.449 --> 00:05:22.800
if necessary do that
