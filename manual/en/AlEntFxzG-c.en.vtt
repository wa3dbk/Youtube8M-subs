00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:19.480
Welcome to Emedco TV's instructional
video on how to properly install a

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:24.300
Traffic and Parking Sign to a U-Channel
Sign Post.  Our Emedco Safety Specialists...

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.629
Joe and Michelle will take you
step by step through the process.

00:00:27.629 --> 00:00:32.009
Here's what you'll need to properly 
install your Sign to a U-Channel Post.

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.720
A Traffic or Parking Sign...

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:35.510
nuts, bolts and washers...

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:36.790
a pair of wrenches...

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:43.010
we used a socket and box
wrench for this installation.

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:45.980
Mounting your Sign on the correct 
side of the post is very important.

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:50.530
You will want to mount your Sign on the 
open end of the "U" in the U-Channel Post.

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:53.200
If you mount the Sign on 
the bottom of the "U"

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:56.810
it will allow the Sign to 
bend if pressure is applied.

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:59.870
You don't want this!

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:02.299
if you mount your Sign 
properly as you see here...

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:06.020
the post supports the Sign. This will
prevent it from bending and warping.

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:10.630
This is very important if you want
your Sign to last a long time.

00:01:10.630 --> 00:01:15.370
Watch Joe as he shows you the right 
and wrong side of the U-Channel post.

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:22.370
Not there!... Yes, there!

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:31.770
Now you're ready to install your
Traffic or Parking Sign to your post.

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.770
Have your assistant hold the sign
in place while you put the bolt

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.140
through one of your washers first...

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.180
then the sign, then the post. Slip on your
other washer, and screw on the nut.

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:45.180
then the sign, then the post. Slip on your
other washer, and screw on the nut.

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:55.550
You'll need to do this for both 
the top and bottom of the Sign.

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:04.000
Now that the Sign is attached, it's time to
tighten the nuts and bolts with your wrenches.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.240
Now that the Sign is attached, it's time to
tighten the nuts and bolts with your wrenches.

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:09.170
The wrench will hold the nut in place, while
the socket wrench will screw in the bolt.

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:10.369
The wrench will hold the nut in place, while
the socket wrench will screw in the bolt.

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:14.889
You'll need to do this for the 
top and bottom of the Sign.

00:02:14.889 --> 00:02:17.309
Once the hardware is completely tight,

00:02:17.309 --> 00:02:20.179
you're all done installing your Sign.

00:02:20.179 --> 00:02:24.829
