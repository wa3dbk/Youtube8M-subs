Hi, this is Laura Turner, and today I'm going
to talk to you about how to analyze archetypes

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:12.800
in films. Almost every film has basically
the same archetype, archetypes in them. And

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:17.010
what I'm going to talk to you about today,
is actually from Joseph Campbell's book, "The

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.750
Hero With A Thousand Faces", and the journey
of the hero that he talks about therein. First

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:27.301
of all, of course, we have a hero in our film.
And, I'm going to use "Lord of the Rings"

00:00:27.301 --> 00:00:32.660
as my example today. So, the hero of, "The
Lord of the Rings", is obviously, Frodo. Frodo

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:40.160
goes on a journey, if you want to tie in another
movie, we have, "Star Wars". Luke is the hero.

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.500
Usually the hero is reluctant to go on this
journey, especially if we're talking about

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:48.441
adventure films and journey films, like "Star
Wars" and "Lord of the Rings". So, the hero

00:00:48.441 --> 00:00:54.690
decides that he wants to refuse to go on this
journey. Frodo, decides, you know, I can't

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.110
take, I can't take the ring. And, and, he
decides that he "wan", that he does not want

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:03.600
to go on the journey. The second archetype
that I'm going to talk about is the herald,

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:09.601
or the person who actually calls the hero
to go on his journey or adventure. And, in

00:01:09.601 --> 00:01:17.780
this case, the herald would be Gandolf. You
have to take the ring to mortal, and throw

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:23.159
it in the fire. And, Frodo says, you know,
of course, I can't do this. The mentor gives

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:27.869
the supernatural aid to the hero. In this
case, with "Lord of the Rings", it's the same

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:34.049
person, it's also Gandolf. The only character
that can not be another archetype in a film,

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:41.759
is the hero. The hero is himself, other characters
can double. So, Gandolf gives the supernatural

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:49.100
aide, or the supernatural thing, the ring,
to Frodo. This sort of sets him on his journey.

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:54.290
Along the way, the hero always has helpers.
In, "Lord of the Rings", there are more helpers

00:01:54.290 --> 00:02:02.020
than you can possibly count for Frodo. Sam,
Mary Pippen, Aragorne, Gimley, Legaless, you

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:06.899
know, you can just name so many. And, if you
think about "Star Wars", as Luke Skywalker,

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:15.239
he has Hans Solo, and Chewie, and all these
other people that come to help him. Next,

00:02:15.239 --> 00:02:19.939
the hero along his journey and towards the
end of a journey, usually will meet a goddess

00:02:19.939 --> 00:02:26.469
figure, another, the next archetype, who is
usually terrible, but timeless. So, in the

00:02:26.469 --> 00:02:31.920
case of "Lord of the Rings", this goddess
would be Gladreill. And, if, you think about

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:38.771
the goddess in "Star Wars", it would probably
be Princess Leah. She is terrible to the hero

00:02:38.771 --> 00:02:44.019
because he was once in love with her, in a
way, and she is his sister. So, you can get

00:02:44.019 --> 00:02:49.811
all sorts of mixing up with that stuff. And,
finally, at the end of his journey, the hero

00:02:49.811 --> 00:02:55.809
will meet with the father, who's our final
archetype. Who is like the hero, but is destructive,

00:02:55.809 --> 00:03:02.269
and punishing. So, in the case of "The Lord
of The Rings", the father ends out to be Gulem,

00:03:02.269 --> 00:03:08.919
who is very much like Frodo, in his lust for
the ring. So, that's just my little introduction

00:03:08.919 --> 00:03:10.839
on how to analyze archetypes in film.
