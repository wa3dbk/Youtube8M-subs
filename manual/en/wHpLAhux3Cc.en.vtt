Extra lenses for your phone. Magnetic light
switches and dumbbells that vibrate. I'm Cali

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:18.100
Lewis. Welcome to GeekBeat.TV number 220.
This episode of GeekBeat.TV is brought to

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:25.980
you by JackThreads. These days you can take
good quality photos almost any time, anywhere,

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.939
with almost any device. And all equip aims
to make it even easier to get better quality

00:00:30.939 --> 00:00:32.439
photos with your iPhone four.

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:37.860
For seventy bucks you get three lenses, a
wide angle, a fish-eye and a macro. They slip

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.110
over the edge of the phone, then you choose
which lens you want. GeekBeat blogger Talyna

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:47.520
Morisson spent time with it and said she became
obsessed with taking photos with the lenses.

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:52.420
The down sides, you have to take your case
off to use it, there is no flash and she felt

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:55.470
like it needed a sturdier case but all that
can be overcome.

00:00:55.470 --> 00:01:00.620
You can see her full review at GeekBeat.TV/olloclip.
I think this is a pretty cool way to spice

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:05.860
up your photos. You know those vibration belts
people use to use to lose weight, or so they

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:11.070
promised? That idea seems to be coming back
into popularity. For example, now we have

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.650
the Body Vibe. They're dumbbells that vibrate
to cause your muscles to contract and release

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:20.110
at a quick speed, which they say burns more
energy faster and increases the intensity

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:21.110
of your workout.

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:25.360
It vibrates when you grab the handle and stops
when you're no longer using it. The charge

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:29.670
will last up to 2 1/2 hours and will take
up to 50 minutes to recharge. You can get

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:34.450
them in 3 pounds, 6, or 10 pounds, starting
at over a thousand bucks. Huh!

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:39.090
Are you like me and don't particularly love
the whole shopping process? I don't blame

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:43.530
you. That's why Jack Threads exists. It's
a members only online shopping club that does

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.390
the dirty work for you and saves you a boatload
of cash. Jack Threads gives you the hottest

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:51.690
brands at up to 80% off of what you could
give them for in the store.

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:55.770
It's private and members only, but I've got
your back. Go to jackthreads.com/geekbeat

00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:05.761
and get right in. It's free. Simple gadgets
are sometimes the best. For those of you who

00:02:05.761 --> 00:02:09.149
walk around the house in circles every morning
looking for your keys, you could get one of

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:14.499
those hooks for by the door, or you could
turn the light switch by the door into this.

00:02:14.499 --> 00:02:18.879
The magnetic light switch cover is exactly
that. Replace the cover of the light switch

00:02:18.879 --> 00:02:23.680
and allow your keys to hang magically in that
spot. I'm not sure what weight it'll hold,

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.802
but if the picture is any indication, it'll
hold quite a bit. It's $24.95. John P and

00:02:25.802 --> 00:02:26.802
I showed you the iTwin recently. You guys
said you were interested in the concept, so

00:02:26.802 --> 00:02:27.802
Geek Beat blogger Nathan Gilchrest took it
for a spin.

00:02:27.802 --> 00:02:28.802
The concept is simple: two ends of a cable.
No cable. It look like a USB stick, but both

00:02:28.802 --> 00:02:29.802
ends are twins. They're exactly the same.
Stick one in your computer at home and take

00:02:29.802 --> 00:02:30.802
the other with you. Then you'll be able to
access any of your files from afar securely

00:02:30.802 --> 00:02:31.802
and without hassle. Let's say you have a large
file or you don't think to put the right files

00:02:31.802 --> 00:02:32.802
on Dropbox before you leave.

00:02:32.802 --> 00:02:33.802
You don't have to think or plan ahead. You'll
just have access regardless. Again, it's secure

00:02:33.802 --> 00:02:34.802
using 256 bit AES encryption. Right now it's
Windows only, but we expect a Mac version

00:02:34.802 --> 00:02:35.802
soon and we'll have an update for you then.

week, I really appreciate it.

Google Plus. Circle me, search Cali Lewis.

00:02:38.802 --> 00:02:39.802
If you need an invite, people have been offering
them in the comments. Bye for now.

00:02:39.802 --> 00:02:40.802
Friction belts people use, to use used, or
used to use? Use to. Bests. Sometimes it's

00:02:40.802 --> 00:02:41.802
for the bests. Bestest ever!

00:02:41.802 --> 00:02:41.805
Oh my God!
