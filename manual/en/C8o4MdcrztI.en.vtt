00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:03.510
My dishwasher is making a grinding noise.

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.779
What could be the cause, and more importantly,
what is the solution?

00:00:07.779 --> 00:00:10.840
Detergent can cake over the strainer inside
of the pump.

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:13.679
I don’t think that is the cause.

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:15.540
Clean out the drain.

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.340
There could be pieces of broken glass or plastic
in there that grind when the water is flowing

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:21.530
down the drain.

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:24.230
What else could cause the noise?

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:26.060
There might be debris inside the chopper.

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:28.300
Or the pump could be wearing out.

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:32.460
I’ll put that on the list of parts it is
reasonable to replace.

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.719
Could metal shavings from a worn out pump
make that noise?

00:00:35.719 --> 00:00:39.969
Absolutely, especially if shavings rub against
other components.

00:00:39.969 --> 00:00:42.149
The fan blade might be the problem.

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:47.089
A loose fan blade will make weird noise, but
rarely grinding.

00:00:47.089 --> 00:00:52.909
Though a heater fan, water inlet valve or
other components may wear out and start making

00:00:52.909 --> 00:00:53.909
noise.

00:00:53.909 --> 00:00:55.999
All of those repairs are costly.

00:00:55.999 --> 00:01:00.629
Compared to a dishwasher overflowing and flooding
the house or wearing out to the point that

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:04.340
it acts like shrapnel in the washer, it isn’t
that much money.

00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:06.970
How could the grinding cause it to overflow?

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:11.800
When the pump no longer grinds and seizes,
it might not be able to pump water out of

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.070
the washer.

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:17.320
When the valve breaks, it may not be able
to stop the flow of water in.

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.360
Attack of the dishwasher!

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:23.430
The grinding noise in the back room was only
a hint of the horrors that awaited them!

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.160
At least you have warning.

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:30.420
But the unit should be turned off while I
wait for a repairman to come by.

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:33.650
And with little kids, I go through a load
of dishes a day.

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:38.950
I wonder if you have small toys like beads
or Hot Wheel wheels in the dishwasher drain.

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:41.490
How could that happens?

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:47.070
How do bow ties, dried pasta, bangles and
beads end up in your dryer’s lint catch?

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.830
How did your kids get small lego toys stuck
in their ears?

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:54.500
OK, OK, with little kids piece parts end up
everywhere.

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:59.220
At least you know the weird noise isn’t
a bunch of unsecure bottles and sippy cups

00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:01.080
rattling around in the dishwasher.

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:06.020
But it could easily be a suction nozzle or
plastic piece from one stuck in a drain or

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:08.810
trapped against a motor, dying a very noisy
death.
