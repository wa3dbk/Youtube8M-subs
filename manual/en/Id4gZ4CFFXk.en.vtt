We were barely making ends meet because
we weren't sure how to manage our
finances - we had no clue, really.
0:00:14.000,0:00:07.000
Hilary &amp; Dennis. A young couple just
like every young couple who love to
spend money.
0:00:21.000,0:00:10.000
Rebecca knew that we were very
impulsive.  Both Dennis and I tend to be
a bit spendy. Dennis and I absolutely
love living here.
0:00:31.000,0:00:08.000
It's just so up our alley.  We can go to
probably a hundred and fifty different
restaurants, shopping, it's all right
there.

Coaching them was actually very
interesting. It was breaking those
habits of - I have to spend everything I
make
0:00:50.000,0:00:07.000
and also help them understand that
they're going to run into some
obstacles. For the first couple of
months it was very conflict oriented.
0:00:57.000,0:00:08.000
Every meeting was just "Arrrrrgh!" As
time wore on, a few months into it I
could really see, Oh my god we're
putting away a lot of money away here.
0:01:07.000,0:00:07.000
We absolutely fell in love with it.  We
thought there's no possible way we could
afford it.

She looked at our entire financial
picture and she'd meet with us, you
know, after work and on the weekends.
She figured out a way to make it work
for
0:01:21.000,0:00:10.000
us. This was a personalized approach
that I had never had anyone take with
me. When we used to go into our other
bank we had a personal banker there
0:01:31.000,0:00:08.000
but kinda got the feeling we were very
low priority on his radar. And that all
changed when we started working with
Rebecca. Rebecca's advice has
0:01:39.000,0:00:08.000
been hands down invaluable to us. Yeah,
we owe her pretty much everything. She
figured out a way to make it work for us
and we were able to
0:01:47.000,0:00:03.000
get the house of our dreams.
0:01:51.000,0:00:05.000
Knowing you help people change their
lives, that is a great feeling.
