I stand here today as hopeful as ever, 

00:01:23.894 --> 00:01:26.894
that the United States of American will endure,

00:01:28.004 --> 00:01:31.004
that it will prevail, that the dream of our founders will live on in our time. 

00:01:32.544 --> 00:01:35.544
I want to thank

00:01:36.618 --> 00:01:39.618
all the speakers and performers today,

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:43.380
 for reminding us, through songs and through words,

00:01:43.795 --> 00:01:46.795
just what it is that we love about America.

00:01:47.319 --> 00:01:50.319
Thank you America. God bless you

00:03:19.181 --> 00:03:22.181
You guys did a great job. Great job.
