00:00:01.389 --> 00:00:07.210
• From employees hired to steal dead bodies
to people hired to farm digital currency for

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:12.500
almost no income themselves we count 15 of
some of the most horrible occupations ever

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:16.150
seen throughout history
15 - Vomit Collector,

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:21.609
• A slave to the Roman Empire who was forced
to hang around dining room tables waiting

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:26.529
for vomit to hit the floor so he can crawl
around on all fours and clean it up

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:31.579
• It was actually a common occupation since
the emperor and his guests would voluntarily

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:37.079
vomit to make room for more food
• In fact, Julius Caesar avoided an assassination

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.690
attempt by feigning interest in visiting the
toilet, only to return to his room to blow

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:46.039
chunks - which, of course, would need to be
cleaned up by a certain slave

00:00:46.039 --> 00:00:50.411
14 - Fuller,
• A job in which sheep are sheared, their

00:00:50.411 --> 00:00:55.249
wool carded, spun and then woven - basically,
cleanse and thicken woollen cloth

00:00:55.249 --> 00:01:01.160
• This wasn't so bad except they needed
alkaline to cleanse the wool and it was expensive,

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:08.350
so they turned to stale urine instead - gallons
of urine taken from farms and private houses,

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:15.200
only for the poor wool cleaner to trod through
urine for over 7 hours a day, up to their

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:20.409
knees in stale human urine
• Not something you'd want to print on your

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:23.719
resume
13 - Sin-Eater,

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:28.549
• Pretty much a terrible job no matter which
way you spin it, the sin-eater was a 19th

00:01:28.549 --> 00:01:34.479
century outcast who nobody cared about, essentially
a homeless person paid to absorb the sins

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:37.630
of other people
• They did this by waiting for a person

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:45.039
to die, pass food over the corpse, then have
the sin-eater eat the food and thereby absorb

00:01:45.039 --> 00:01:49.869
the sins - in return they were given scraps
of money

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:56.479
• The sin-eaters give up any chance of a
decent afterlife, are shunned by society and

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:02.150
usually starving to death anyway - but hey,
first world problems, am I right?

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:06.840
12 - Gold Farmer,
• A Chinese job started around 2007 in the

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:11.370
massively multiplayer online role playing
game World of Warcraft, in which your job

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:16.360
is to amass virtual currency called gold
• The gold is sold to other players in exchange

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:22.010
for real money, but to farm the gold is basically
slave labour - work in 12 hour shifts for

00:02:22.010 --> 00:02:26.069
the world's most measly pay: 30 cents per
hour

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:31.650
• That's $3.60 per day, so you've already
paid off your monthly Warcraft subscription

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.710
in 5 days
• What a deal

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:38.260
11 - Knocker-Up,
• This one has nothing to do with impregnating

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.760
people, which is a shame because then the
occupation would actually mean something

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:48.100
• Instead, the knocker-up goes around tapping
on your window with some bamboo in order to

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:52.620
wake you up in time for work
• In fact, he won't STOP tapping until you

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:57.720
tell him to go away, but only if you give
him a little bit of money - so, you're employing

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.269
someone to bother you
• But at least he isn't trying to sell you

00:03:01.269 --> 00:03:03.549
something
10 - Spit Boy,

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:08.450
• The lowest ranking-member of kitchen staff,
a teenage hired to stand there and turn a

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:12.969
metal spit that roasts meat for hours
• And it wasn't as easy as you might think

00:03:12.969 --> 00:03:17.790
- the meat was packed on so extensively that
you could barely turn the thing, the handle

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:23.629
made of iron, heat in your face all day long
• Just imagine if someone hired you to stand

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:29.470
next to a bonfire and lift weights for 8 hours
a day - try and keep your eyeballs from melting

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:32.489
into your beard
9 - Leech Collector,

00:03:32.489 --> 00:03:37.550
• A job that continued until the late 19th
century, to collect leeches so they can latch

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:42.079
onto a medical patient and withdraw small
amounts of blood for therapeutic reasons

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:47.250
• Leech-gatherers were forced to wade through
dense leech-filled areas and allow them to

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:52.260
latch onto their legs and suck, losing tremendous
amounts of blood for measly pay

00:03:52.260 --> 00:03:55.700
• It never occurred to them that they should
maybe use a net

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:00.430
8 - Body Snatcher,
• A man employed to dig up fresh graves

00:04:00.430 --> 00:04:05.060
and sell off the bodies, without leaving any
trace that the body was now gone so as not

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:09.689
to alert the grieving family
• The bodies were used in the rapidly-advancing

00:04:09.689 --> 00:04:14.829
19th century field of medicine with medical
students who desperately needed fresh bodies,

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:19.460
but with only executed criminals allowed,
they turned to this black market trade

00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:23.840
• And then we all discovered cremation and
the industry took a downward turn

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:28.590
7 - Subway Pusher,
• A Japanese line of employment created

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:34.540
purely to manage the peak hour public transport
traffic, when trains are filled beyond 200%

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:39.260
of their maximum capacity
• The pushers job is to cram people in so

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:44.260
the doors will actually close, otherwise the
train can't leave and you get massive delays

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:49.870
• Pushers are generally made up of part-time
students, train staff or desperate bulked-up

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:52.860
part-time workers who like pushing people
around

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:58.130
6 - Dog Whipper,
• A lovely title for a church employee in

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:01.480
charge of keeping dogs from interrupting the
weekly service

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:07.440
• In the 16th through 19th centuries, church-goers
would bring along their pets but it was the

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:12.880
job of the dog whipper, armed with whip and
wooden tongs, to eject animals if they became

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:16.020
disruptive
• It was a valid occupation with payment

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:20.730
records still around in old parish account
books from churches all over England

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:25.530
5 - Snake Milker,
• This is a job still around today, to get

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:30.670
your venomous snake to squirt its venom into
a cup to create an antivenin used to treat

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:34.350
snake bites
• In fact, one legendary snake milker named

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:41.480
Bill Haast survived over 172 venomous snake
bites during the whole of his 100 year career

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:46.240
• This is mostly due to the fact he was
a snake milker, so antivenin was abundant

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:50.770
and the snake responsible very close by
4 - Plague Burier,

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:55.240
• The Black Death which swept through Europe,
leaving piles and piles of bodies rotting

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:58.630
in people's houses
• If you've watched some Monty Python, you'll

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:03.260
know about the old quote "Bring our yer dead",
but that really is what happened - someone

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:07.250
was hired to go around with a cart collecting
bodies to head off and bury them

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:13.770
• And the employees were then riddled with
disease from the decomposing corpse, so not

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:18.170
long after they got sick and had to be dumped
on another cart moved by some other unlucky

00:06:18.170 --> 00:06:21.130
fool
3 - Groom of the Stool,

00:06:21.130 --> 00:06:26.810
• A fancy way to describe someone hired
by royalty to stand in the toilet with them

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:29.620
and then wipe their grotty ass-crack and clean
it

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:34.420
• But they weren't slaves, oh no - more
often than not you'll find the sons of noblemen

00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:38.590
or personal assistants to the King very high
up on social standing

00:06:38.590 --> 00:06:43.850
• To be selected to clean the gunk off a
royal anus was quite the honour, and it's

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:48.410
a shame we're today forced to do it ourselves
like savage cave-men

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:52.570
2 - Tosher,
• A person who used to scavenge in the sewers

00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:57.520
of London, stripping valuable copper from
the hulls of ships and stealing tradable treasures

00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:00.980
flushed down sewers
• This occupation made you smell like garbage

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:06.730
24/7, so you might imagine they weren't very
popular when encountered

00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:12.400
1 - French Beggar
• This is barely an occupation, more of

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:15.480
a desperate act for homeless people to get
by day-to-day

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:21.941
• It was pre-revolution France and beggar
competition was intense, so the idea came

00:07:21.941 --> 00:07:24.850
up to invoke as much sympathy from donators
as possible

00:07:24.850 --> 00:07:29.690
• The worst of which involved something
called denatsate, in which the mouth is cut

00:07:29.690 --> 00:07:35.850
open ear-to-ear in a joker's grin - gums and
nose removed, a disfigured face pleading with

00:07:35.850 --> 00:07:39.520
you for coins
• Puts things into perspective next time

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:50.660
you complain about 
your 9/5 job
