WWE Payback 2015 Full Show alright guys told me on well kid to you

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:08.519
eight new video and today your I breed
you my WWE Payback 2015 Full Show

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.540
pay-back 2015 prediction yes WWE Payback 2015 Full Show

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.379
dot is writes a lot of people lie to
call me the voice of the people

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:21.180
and when I say the last I mean I'm gonna
bring you the noble Lord predictions

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.480
for the payback pay-per-view this so day
this is the place you want to be

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:29.779
for the payback predictions because the
day I'm going to predict WWE Payback 2015 Full Show

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:34.020
every single match on the card for the
bay payback pay-per-view

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.940
a this is how it's going down so for the
first much

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:41.829
we have to WWE World Heavyweight
Championship

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:47.399
several leads Roman reigns D numbers
against run the alt in a fatal 4-way

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:51.530
and if rollins does not retain KN will
be fired

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:54.960
WWE Payback 2015 Full Show in my opinion I see rollins winning

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.420
this match she's the only healed in this
match he feels like he's the older dog

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:03.960
surely the guy the house the walkout was
the champion must be the order docs act

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.090
Rollins was not expecting it puts

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.560
he's only just won the title I don't see
why do we do we putting the title on

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:13.860
or 10 Dino Bros Allroad the reins at
this point

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.460
Roman reigns in denial Bros already and
run be altered we being that we've done

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:21.659
not so the obvious conclusion to this
much should be

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:26.270
cephlon's to walk out as the champion
usually in this fatal 4-way matches

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:30.680
your dog always wins so saffron and
should be walking out a payback

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:34.259
outs still the WWE Champion and not

00:01:34.259 --> 00:01:38.590
is best for business the next not

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:42.710
is why but against Bray Wyatt the winner
of this match will be

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:47.250
bright why it's Brian why was the one
that tax write back so it would look a

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:48.110
bit daft

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:52.119
if ride bike was gonna be Bray why it
just like da brainwash the one that

00:01:52.119 --> 00:01:53.460
started the whole feud

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:57.430
he's the one that's controlling frames
he's the one that's gonna win this match

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:59.320
WWE Payback 2015 Full Show you get dry back in if you think about
it

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:03.930
WWE Payback 2015 Full Show if they want to make this pay-per-view
last until at least Elimination Chamber

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:07.600
the brain wise got to be the one that
witness wins this match

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:12.319
usually the baby face does not win the
first match because if Riva quintere

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:15.920
then why would bring why phase right
back again if the heel Wednesday

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:19.150
then there's an opportunity for right
about to face Bray why again

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:23.329
im still look for that victory over
bright white if Ryback went to the first

00:02:23.329 --> 00:02:23.790
much

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:27.760
the baby faces always got already got
the victory over the hill

00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:31.870
if he wins here that is always an
opportunity to carry the feud on

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:36.329
to at least Elimination Chamber are just
a lot about the brady white started on

00:02:36.329 --> 00:02:38.859
white bakkie attack drive back in the
WWE Payback 2015 Full Show first place

00:02:38.859 --> 00:02:43.090
the brain wise got to win this match or
is going to look very very weak

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:47.419
now the next much is John senior against
through seven an I quit match

00:02:47.419 --> 00:02:51.150
I have no idea why this much is
happening again we've already seen it

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:56.120
three times already so why we sing it
again Johnson is already ru serve twice

00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:56.989
in a row

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:00.129
so why does research Russa pop phone
number really much

00:03:00.129 --> 00:03:03.290
so John Siena has got to win this much

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:07.419
he's already beat him twice in a row if
Russa went WWE Payback 2015 Full Show here again we've gotta have

00:03:07.419 --> 00:03:12.090
another rematch between John scenery Sep
that's never happening and John C no

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:15.139
is never saying I quit in the middle of
the rain

00:03:15.139 --> 00:03:18.259
John Siena house to retain hair I

00:03:18.259 --> 00:03:21.439
could put my house on it and I don't
even own one

00:03:21.439 --> 00:03:24.759
the door eat our team championship match
between the new day

00:03:24.759 --> 00:03:29.099
versace's sorrow and Tyson Kidd the new
day a winning this match

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:32.370
by two falls out all free the new day

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:36.680
have to win here they've only just BN
says are in WWE Payback 2015 Full Show Tyson Kidd for the tag team

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:37.419
titles

00:03:37.419 --> 00:03:42.840
why would they dropped them again the
new day at absolutely amazing as heels

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:47.370
they are fantastic they are going places
in the tag team division they are not

00:03:47.370 --> 00:03:48.220
losing here

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:51.220
so my prediction is the new day

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:55.639
now the next March is both ziglar again
Shamis dole saying I got the win in the

00:03:55.639 --> 00:03:56.479
first much

00:03:56.479 --> 00:04:00.250
went on for WWE Payback 2015 Full Show Shamis was gonna win so I
think shame I should get the win this

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:01.040
match because

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:04.540
if you can get the win in the first
large then why they gonna made of legal

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:08.180
win again I feel like Shaima should win
this match she deftly should win this

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:08.709
much

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:11.829
he's lost much in single was his return
pave you match

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:15.769
and Jayma should probably have one that
much and the party did with their

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:19.159
he certainly got a win at the paid-up
pave the army shame is the one that

00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:20.060
tactical a

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:23.340
he's only just returned he's still
looking for WWE Payback 2015 Full Show that big win

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:25.440
shameless should Wayne against

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:28.540
eager in this match the next match is
bad news part

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:31.820
against level all came by heart again
snabel

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:35.560
now Adrian level should win this not
she's just got from NXT

00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:40.290
he's no way driving too bad news part I
mean bad news bright got beat by Nabil

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:43.620
only the WWE Payback 2015 Full Show pay-per-view before extreme
role so why

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:46.870
what they decide to give bar the win
this time again snabel

00:04:46.870 --> 00:04:51.260
that doesn't make any sense devil has
been picking owades against anybody

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:55.330
at Step John Siena novel house the win
here he's only just come up

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:58.950
he's looking as hot as ever not in the
right term

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:02.890
but he's looking great at the moment and
Neville has to win against King Bart

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:06.610
and they should put him over very very
well against the king at the ring

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:08.190
whenever 2015

00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:13.670
the next not is Tehmina and Mayumi
against Nikki Bella and Brie Bella

00:05:13.670 --> 00:05:18.470
easy answer this is my only I'm to Mina
if it was a title much I would have said

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:20.930
Nikki ballot because some retarded
reason

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:24.680
do you want to keep the tag the diva's
championship on the key Bala

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:28.390
both the father is in a diva's match ID
was twenty map

00:05:28.390 --> 00:05:31.850
title much sorry they gonna give the
Winton I only in WWE Payback 2015 Full Show two Mina

00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:35.540
whenever city was championship much they
always give the winter Nicky Butler

00:05:35.540 --> 00:05:39.490
but the problem is not they should give
the Winton I am into me now because

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:43.100
apart from that they never seem to give
anybody else in the diva's division it's

00:05:43.100 --> 00:05:44.040
at Nikki Bella

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:48.100
the win but the fuck is no championship
match they should give the winter nyomi

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:48.910
in two Mina

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:52.930
not support Miami in two Mina over and
hopefully bring some new stars

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:56.080
to challenge Nikki Palace championship
if needed a wind shear

00:05:56.080 --> 00:05:59.270
he's pretty much knocking off the two
best teams they have in the division

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:00.010
right now

00:06:00.010 --> 00:06:03.200
Miami answer me not need to win this
match oh there's pretty much no

00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:04.140
competitor

00:06:04.140 --> 00:06:08.710
for the diva's title at this point know
me numb enough that's pretty good name

00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:13.360
nyomi to Mina to win this match on the
new tag team if Curtis actual a match oh

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:14.160
man dow

00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:17.270
this the WWE Payback 2015 Full Show Ascension mucho mondiale

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:20.360
and Curtis Act will have to win this
match there are fresh

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:23.980
brand new tag team they've only just
teamed up why they gonna lose their

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:25.250
first pay-per-view match

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:28.669
that makes no sense and the Ascension
ultimately

00:06:28.669 --> 00:06:32.640
the best job is the do we do we have
right now so they're gonna pull over

00:06:32.640 --> 00:06:36.030
