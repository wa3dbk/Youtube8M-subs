00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.670
Tom&gt;&gt; It's a barn! It was actually used as a dairy barn

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:20.140
and stored hay. It was built in 1908

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:22.660
so it just turned a hundred a few
years ago. 

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:27.419
Basically, if you can climb up a
ladder then you're capable

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:32.419
of trying out rock climbing. We make a conscientious effort to

00:00:32.419 --> 00:00:35.780
put routes and problems... and 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:39.010
set up our wall so that they
are accessible lots of different people.

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:41.170
We welcome beginners. We encourage beginners to
come out.

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:44.430
And that's one of the things we pride
ourselves on: is the experience of the

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.539
beginner to come in and actually join -

00:00:46.539 --> 00:00:48.819
and further develop that community of rock
climbers. 

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.940
Ben&gt;&gt; The learning curve for rock-climbing is very steep. You come in at
the beginning

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.850
feeling like you have no idea what
you're doing. But very quickly you discover

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:02.089
how to move yourself efficiently on the
wall. How to relax. How to calm down

00:01:02.089 --> 00:01:06.440
and then within two or three climbing
sessions

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:09.880
you'll be making your way up the wall nicely -
completing routes. 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:15.200
Jake&gt;&gt; I've done more the easier routes. There are still some routes that I wouldn't
be able to do right now,

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.689
but maybe a little bit after a couple
more classes I'll be able to

00:01:18.689 --> 00:01:22.209
rock'em out... no pun intended.

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:26.040
Emily&gt;&gt; There's a lot of girls that come and climb. And
there are a lot of really, really, really,

00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.860
good girls who come and climb.

00:01:28.869 --> 00:01:32.049
And they are like... 5 ft tall or shorter... they're nothing compared to,
like,

00:01:32.049 --> 00:01:36.170
the six ft. tall guy that climbs here... but it's not

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:40.100
all about just muscle. It's very strategic.
It's a lot of planning and thinking

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:41.820
about how you are going to do things.

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.140
And you use your whole body.  You use all your muscles -

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:47.479
your legs, your arms... and you come up with
different ways...

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:50.820
I think if you're shorter or you don't have
as much muscle you get more creative

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.520
with the way you climb

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:53.780
because you

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:56.620
try new things to reach different holds.

00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:00.280
It's more... I think its more fun!

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:05.280
Tom&gt;&gt; I think ours is pretty unique given the the number of people that
we attract

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:10.309
and the kind of atmosphere that we
have cultivated. 

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:12.940
Climbers from on-campus, from off-campus and...

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:16.500
we've actually had students come here to
RIT just because of our rock climbing gym!
