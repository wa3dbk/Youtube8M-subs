00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:22.980
Check out this short tutorial on how to create
a video slideshow using Final Cut Pro X.

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.800
One method of importing still images into
Final Cut PRo X is to import them directly

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:28.800
from iPhoto.

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.509
If you're following along, go ahead and import
some pictures into iPhoto.

00:00:30.509 --> 00:00:35.519
Then go back to the Final Cut Pro X application.

00:00:35.519 --> 00:00:41.100
Navigate to the Final Cut Pro toolbar and
click on the Photo Browser button.

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:45.140
This will bring forward the Photo Browser
window which will give you access to all your

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:46.720
images within iPhoto.

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:54.309
Go ahead and elect a group of photos and drag
them to the timeline window.

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:59.550
A dialogue box may appear saying the video
properties are not recognized.

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.330
Go ahead and choose the video properties that
you’d like to use and press the okay button.

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:09.060
Now, if you’re not happy with the default
duration of your still images, it’s easy

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.759
to change the duration of all your clips at
the same time.

00:01:12.759 --> 00:01:17.630
Verify that all your clips are still selected
within the timeline window and then press

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:20.560
Control D.

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.890
Then enter the new duration within the timecode
dashboard display area.

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:29.549
This will automatically adjust the duration
of all your clips within the timeline.

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:35.030
Okay, if you are working with any of the HD
widescreen video properties, your standard

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:39.110
digital photos won’t fill the screen area.

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:44.260
To fix this, click on the transform effect
icon in the bottom left corner of the viewer

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:46.189
window.

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:53.229
Then drag one of the blue handles in the corner
of the image to scale it so it fits the screen.

00:01:53.229 --> 00:01:58.369
Now all the clips have been properly been
formatted for a 16 x 9 screen size.

00:01:58.369 --> 00:02:03.329
Now, you may also need to adjust the areas
of the picture that are displayed within the

00:02:03.329 --> 00:02:05.799
widescreen area.

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:10.479
Go ahead and place the playhead indicator
above a clip within the timeline and then

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:13.930
adjust the image within the viewer window.

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:18.720
You can also add a transition to all of your
clips at the same time.

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.880
To do this, click on the transitions button.

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:50.980
Within the transitions browser window, double
click on the transition that you would like

00:02:50.980 --> 00:03:00.870
to use between all your clips.

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:06.620
Okay, it’s that easy!
