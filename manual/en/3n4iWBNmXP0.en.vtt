Hello Undertoads.

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:21.730
This holiday season is a great time for giving.

00:00:21.730 --> 00:00:26.590
And well I didn't get a real puppy for Christmas
but I was able to get something close.

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:30.940
For the longest time some of my favorite breeds
of dogs have ranged from corgis all the way

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:32.610
to huskies.

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:38.110
Well Nintendogs and Cats for the 3ds was more
than what I expected for a virtual pet and

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:43.410
I am aware Derek already reviewed this but
his was the golden retriever version this

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.620
one that I got, the toy poodle and friends
has a whole new variety of breeds in it including

00:00:48.620 --> 00:01:02.670
my favorite the corgi.

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.229
Not to get all tough on breeds but I'd like
to rename this game though, Nintendogs and

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.760
Cats the one with the least amount of whimpy
dogs in it.

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.830
Don't let the Toy Poodle name deceive you
into thinking this has only tiny purse sized

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:16.830
pups.

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:21.620
In this bad boy of a 3DS game we have not
only boxers and labs, but you also have the

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:24.300
tough and adorable bull terrior.

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:33.600
This game has some of the best breeds, I promise.

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.250
The gameplay is just the same as it's fellow
titles including the DS originals.

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:41.460
You have the full on ability to take care
of an awesome pet once you pick them out.

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:48.300
I picked out my tricolor corgi to begin with
but a very careful note, pay attention to

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:53.240
their gender before you pick them out if you
have a name you wanted for them.

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.380
I didn't realize I was getting a female corgi
and at that point her name could no longer

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.390
be Ein like I originally had wanted for a
boy.

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:06.230
When I say this game was more than what I
expected, I literally mean it surprised me.

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:12.220
I started playing the game thinking, oh this
is going to be lame, I'm too old for this.

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:17.610
Maybe it's because I'm a girl or just because
I'm an animal lover, or both, but seeing those

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:22.730
puppies in the pens when you pick one had
me saying out loud things in a baby voice

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:24.970
like I was talking to an infant.

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:28.790
I instantly knew then that this was as close
as I am going to get to a real dog for now

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:33.719
anyways and you also have the luxury of getting
cats too if you would like.

00:02:33.719 --> 00:02:38.579
You can feed them, give them water, play with
them, bath them, and even brush their fur

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:40.340
when they need groomed.

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:45.020
It's something sure to make somebody smile
with the enhancements of this being 3D.

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:50.349
I find myself using the 3d more often in this
game then other 3DS games though because it

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:54.670
doesn't strain my eyes as bad because you're
simply looking straight on most of the time

00:02:54.670 --> 00:03:05.129
at your pet, not fighting koopas or saving
princesses.

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:08.819
You're stuck with your first pet in the game
for awhile though because your money depletes

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:11.099
after your first pet purchase.

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:15.469
The only way to earn money back is to either
walk your dog a lot and sell the things it

00:03:15.469 --> 00:03:20.060
finds on the path or to enter it in competitions
after you train it to do tricks or to catch

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:21.920
a frisbee better.

00:03:21.920 --> 00:03:29.760
Even if you place third in a competition you
still get paid for it though, which is nice.

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.799
The stores in the game consist of ones that
have supplies for your pets general needs

00:03:33.799 --> 00:03:35.880
for their diet and amusement.

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:39.359
There is also a pawn store which is where
you can actually sell the items you find on

00:03:39.359 --> 00:03:42.799
your walks or items you aren't using.

00:03:42.799 --> 00:03:46.970
It adds up over time and once you get enough
that's when you can finally purchase a second

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:47.970
pet.

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:52.180
I've only had this since Christmas so I'm
still earning my way back up while still spoiling

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:54.660
my corgi to her hearts content.

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:59.889
I'm very interested in getting one of the
cute siamese kittens they have after.

00:03:59.889 --> 00:04:05.269
Now cats I actually have in real life so technically
I don't need a virtual one but come on, just

00:04:05.269 --> 00:04:16.620
look at them, how could you resist, and best
of all they don't shed.
