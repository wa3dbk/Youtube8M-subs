00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:05.410
Now we are going to prepare the pattern. I
like to do things differently. I never buy

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:10.019
patterns, I like to make my own, and that
way I can make them exactly how I want, and

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:15.719
I can adjust them as needed, and that way
they fit the way I like them to. So first

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:21.000
off, I want to think about what I want it
to look like. So we want it to be, basically,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.310
this shape. You're going to have your top
shape, and then it's going to come out straight

00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:31.349
at the bottom like that, and straight across
at the bottom. You will have a strap that

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:36.480
will go in here, a strap that will go in here,
and you'll have two larger straps on the sides

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:41.960
that will tie around the back. Now knowing
that, this is the shape we want to do, I'm

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:50.290
going to go ahead and fold over my paper,
and you can use a newspaper or whatever you

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:56.379
want, be careful not to get your material
all dirty, but it doesn't have to be a clean

00:00:56.379 --> 00:01:02.250
piece. And then I'm going to draw half of
what I need, because that way each side will

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:07.810
match. And this paper's not actually as long
as what I want to go, but that won't matter.

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:27.320
I'm just going to go straight down like that,
and then cut this out. If I

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:31.920
decide that's going out too far there, I can
just change it while I'm cutting it. You want

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:42.530
to make sure both sides are the same. And
then there's my pattern. And then for the

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:47.430
straps, are actually just straight strips,
so I'm going to just rip those from material.

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.840
I don't really need a pattern for them, if
I do make a pattern a lot of times I get odd

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:56.860
sizes. It seems to be more uniform if I just
rip them. I do like to mark on my pattern

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:02.060
where I want to put my straps so I don't forget.
There's big ones up there and little ones

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.940
up here. And that is how you make your pattern!
