00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:57.960
&gt;&gt;A 23 lakh rupee Mercedes Hatchback.

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:03.190
That's right, this is one of Mercedes Benz's
cheapest cars in India, but true to form this

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:05.860
baby Merc has enough to brag about.

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:10.990
That three pointer star on this fancy diamond-mesh
grille is worth the price tag.

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:17.280
And the bi-xenon headlamps with built-in daytime
running lamps signal your arrival in style.

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:23.540
The A180 is a fairly long and sleek car, with
some design cues taken from its sportier siblings.

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:28.060
When you look at it from the rear, the sloping
roofline and tiny rear window again give it

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:32.979
a hint of sportiness, although it could get
mistaken easily for some other cheaper German

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:34.240
hatchbacks.

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:39.630
The large 17-inch alloys look purposeful.

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:44.330
This car is powered by a 1.6 litre turbo-charged
petrol engine that puts out a modest 122 bhp

00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:50.750
of power and 200 Newton metres of torque,
through a seven-speed automatic transmission

00:01:50.750 --> 00:02:19.760
driving the front wheels and operated by a
steering mounted stalk 

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:24.200
and paddle shifters.

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:30.040
Still don't expect sports car like performance
even in Sports mode.

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:34.290
Shifting to manual mode and using the paddle
shifters makes the fun of driving slightly

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:39.220
better, but the car is best left in Economy
mode and allowed to do its job the way it

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:40.620
was meant to.

00:02:40.620 --> 00:03:30.200
The car's electronic power steering does allow
for some sporty driving too.

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:35.799
The interiors are pretty dark, but the panoramic
sun-roof helps to add an airy feel.

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:38.310
The front seats get fixed head restraints.

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:43.859
In terms of safety this car has Seven airbags,
ABS and traction control.

00:03:43.859 --> 00:03:50.579
Convenience features include a rear view parking
camera, with front and rear sensors, GPS navigation,

00:03:50.579 --> 00:04:19.479
voice commands for the Command infotainment
system and Bluetooth telephony.

00:04:19.479 --> 00:04:28.449
The boot is fairly large at 341 litres, which
is more than most hatchbacks offer.

00:04:28.449 --> 00:04:36.310
But the space saver spare wheel ironically
hogs up a fair bit of space in the boot!

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:39.320
The Mercedes A180 is truly a driver's car.

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:45.790
It will appeal to a buyer who wants a prestigious
badge on a convenient, luxurious hatchback.

00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:50.040
It's the car that will rope in a fair number
of self-driven young buyers who love the good

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:50.760
things in life!
