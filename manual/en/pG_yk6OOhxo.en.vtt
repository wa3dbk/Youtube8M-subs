00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:07.529
Well this morning I find myself

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:10.809
here in Bhutan, needing, desperately,

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:15.389
some bottled water because I'm dying of thirst. So
I stopped off at a small little grocery store here,

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.750
and I discovered something quite amazing.
Some hanging fresh,

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:24.780
Beef Jerky. Yes I'm about to make a very tasteful portrait!

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:28.460
Hi, I'm Bryan Peterson
and you are watching AdoramaTV.

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:34.240
AdoramaTV presents; You Keep Shooting with Bryan Peterson.

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.820
Now when I speak about tasteful, I'm going to
ask my model

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:43.600
to actually appear to be sampling this
very fresh

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:47.720
Beef Jerky. But let's set it all up, and see
exactly how it's going to unfold.

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:52.490
Time a day here is 11:30. I would normally
never recommend shooting

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:56.820
at 11:30 for portraits without benefit of some fill flash.

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.030
So that's why I have my onboard, built-in

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:06.110
flash on the D800E, all set up and ready
to go. So pretty simple, go ahead and step back.

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:13.780
Hi this is Bryan Peterson inviting you to check out Adorama's latest contest.

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:17.740
This could be your chance to win some great prizes.

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:23.180
First of all I'm setting my ambient exposure for the light behind him. Which is f8 at a 250s,

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:26.810
and if you wouldn't mind, go ahead and pre tent you're going to take a bite.

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:30.650
So here we go, and action! Take a look at that.

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:35.240
Benefit of the Flash. That is a very tasteful portrait.

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.280
All the way here from Bhutan.
Next time you're thinking about shooting

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:42.780
portraits at midday, what's really the lesson
here folks, is to make sure

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.679
and use a little bit of fill flash, if you don't have
the benefit of things like reflectors or diffusers.

00:01:47.679 --> 00:01:50.789
The simplest approach here of course, is the use of the flash.

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:54.920
But again, manual exposure on the camera, set the ambient, 4,

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:58.330
the ambient light, and when you use your flash,

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:02.330
in this case I set it to -1, so it doesn't overpower

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:07.370
the subject itself. At -1 just fills in nicely a little bit of sunlight.

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:09.119
Hey, until next time,

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:13.779
this is Bryan Peterson from beautiful Bhutan, sending you another idea on how to shoot

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.810
another tasteful portrait. Until next time,

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:23.810
