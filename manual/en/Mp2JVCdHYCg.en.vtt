Hi, I'm Bob Schmidt with HomeRemodelWorkshop

00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:07.339
when you are doing any project you kind of look
forward to something different than usual

00:00:07.339 --> 00:00:09.049
in this basement project 

00:00:09.049 --> 00:00:10.690
we have this cabinet here.  Let's get to work.

00:00:10.690 --> 00:00:16.139
The neat thing that this cabinet does is
it allows access to a storage area

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:23.139
that is back behind it without the use of a door

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.130
let me show you how we did that.  Now to
make this cabinet move, all we did was use

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:33.360
a simple pocket door track

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:38.180
and the pocket door wheels and hardware
associated with it.  Now what I did was 

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:40.600
take a factory built cabinet

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:43.640
I added a plywood gusset to the side

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.190
uh... making sure that I screwed it at all
the possible points that I possibly

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:50.080
could, to make this as strong as possible

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:51.920
then above the top here

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:54.030
I anchored in two by fours

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.560
that went across

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:58.710
to (a) anchor our guide wheels to the track and (b) anchor 

00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:05.239
this little guide wheel along the back side so that when you push the cabinet in 

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:07.900
the back wheels didn't come up off the track

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:10.320
one of the major issues we had

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.140
was that this is a concrete basement floor

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:14.740
it's not perfectly level

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.630
as a matter of fact it actually runs
uphill from where the carpet covers the

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:23.440
bottom, and it runs uphill toward the outside walls, in both directions

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:26.780
now what I did was when I put the tracks in

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:31.570
I actually built my frame so that it went up about an 1/8 of an inch per foot

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:35.540
to allow the base of this cabinet to have enough clearance to get back

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:37.840
without being obstructed by hitting
the floor

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.789
I used a few of the simple bullet type
catches

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:43.610
where the wheels roll over the outside and
snap it

00:01:43.610 --> 00:01:47.640
to temporarily hold the thing
closed until you get the permanent latches on

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:53.000
now I placed the slide latches in a discreet area, so that as the front cabinet doors

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.490
are open it's kind of difficult to see
them unless you are looking straight up

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:59.330
and basically here they are

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:02.800
they're anchored up underneath the bottom
so that you can't see it because of this

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:04.430
little lip here

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:07.450
our customer also wanted a key lock on it

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.849
to keep his kids out during certain seasons of the year.  Now I'm going to 

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:16.310
take a few random shots of this track
that I've built, and the hardware and how

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.579
the wheels work and stuff like that

00:02:18.579 --> 00:02:22.809
in case I didn't answer some of your
questions, or show it close enough 

00:02:22.809 --> 00:02:23.599
we anchored our framing

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:24.609
to the uh...

00:02:24.609 --> 00:02:28.150
front of the trim here along with the track hardware

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.989
just to make sure that we had a nice secure tight fit

00:02:30.989 --> 00:02:36.199
we built a couple of simple tracks and gusset plates to go ahead and run our

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:41.090
pocket door hardware track to.  As you can see we just added some simple two-by-fours

00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:43.509
in between the plywood gussets

00:02:43.509 --> 00:02:47.539
which is what we anchored the
pocket door track wheels to

00:02:47.539 --> 00:02:52.599
and the guide wheel to keep the back wheel from lifting up.  Now, everything I used to do this

00:02:52.599 --> 00:02:53.719
project

00:02:53.719 --> 00:02:56.169
was purchased from my local box store

00:02:56.169 --> 00:03:01.180
I didn't have to go buy any specialty
hardware or anything like that at all

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:05.469
now these tracks for these pocket door tracks are actually designed and 

00:03:05.469 --> 00:03:08.659
engineered to hold a hundred and fifty pounds
each

00:03:08.659 --> 00:03:13.339
so we're up to about three hundred pounds of capacity, with the cabinet included

00:03:13.339 --> 00:03:16.759
the cabinets may be between eighty and a hundred pounds

00:03:16.759 --> 00:03:19.019
so you could overload this cabinet 

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:23.069
I mean if you want to stack your gold bullion somewhere, stack it somewhere else

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:25.040
in the hidden room

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:28.859
other than that I'm Bob Schmidt with HomeRemodelWorkshop... thanks for

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:29.599
watching and I'm out.
