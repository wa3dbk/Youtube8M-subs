00:00:07.779 --> 00:00:08.779
Whats up guys?

00:00:08.779 --> 00:00:11.240
I wanted to show you real quick
something

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:14.139
Some complaints that people are having
with the

00:00:14.139 --> 00:00:15.449
Nutribullet.

00:00:15.449 --> 00:00:18.119
And
somethings I tend to

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:19.689
actually
overlook

00:00:19.689 --> 00:00:21.510
and ignore
actually.

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:22.579
Now
if you look

00:00:22.579 --> 00:00:25.989
inside
the nutribullet

00:00:25.989 --> 00:00:27.550
it stains
its like

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:29.119
the stuff drips out
and

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:32.110
I'm usually on the go
so I dont always clean it

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:34.580
right away.

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:35.821
Sometimes I'm not really
thinking about it.

00:00:35.821 --> 00:00:39.000
I make my drink
and I'm gone.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.600
So
about once a week

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:41.600
or whatever
I

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:42.600
go back and I
clean it when

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:43.710
I realize
alright damn

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:45.200
this thing is getting
dirty.

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:47.059
Now
What happens is

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:48.640
if you haven't seen
the other video

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:51.620
that I have done
what happens is

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:54.350
These cups have a max line
capacity.

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:55.879
See?

00:00:55.879 --> 00:00:58.129
What
I

00:00:58.129 --> 00:00:59.129
and a lot of
other people

00:00:59.129 --> 00:01:00.129
tend to do
is

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:02.140
fill it past
this max line.

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:03.140
Now
what happens

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:04.640
when you
do that.

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.010
All the liquid is gonna
push out

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:07.659
and it starts
to push

00:01:07.659 --> 00:01:09.330
though
this little

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:10.330
thing.

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:11.420
Now
as it gets old

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:13.180
as the blade
gets old

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:14.180
I dont know
if you can see it

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:15.180
sorry.

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.560
I dont know
if you can se it

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:17.570
but
you start to get

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:20.040
the separation
between the blade

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.079
and the
the middle of it.

00:01:23.079 --> 00:01:24.790
That causes
when you put too much

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:26.360
liquid
that pressure makes

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:27.500
it push though
it leaks

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:28.500
though the bottom.

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.729
You can see
the rust on my finger.

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:33.170
It starts to rust.

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:34.630
Some people complain
that it leaks

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:37.140
around the
sealing right here.

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:38.710
But
its actually

00:01:38.710 --> 00:01:40.460
its coming from
this way.

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:41.600
And if you see the blades
there is some

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:42.821
discoloration
on it.

00:01:42.821 --> 00:01:43.900
Its not rust
actually

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:47.420
its just like
I think if I scrubbed it

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:48.420
it would come off.

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.110
A lot of times
I have a habit of

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:53.560
just rinsing it off
and

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:54.820
I guess
the little

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:57.329
stuff just gets
stuck on it.

00:01:57.329 --> 00:01:59.439
Like I said
it does

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:03.310
rust under here
and

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:04.420
the little things
start to

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:05.420
come out.

00:02:05.420 --> 00:02:08.360
You have to push them
back in.

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:09.360
Nutribullet
does tend

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.540
to get loud
sometimes also

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:12.760
and a lot of
people are having

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:13.870
issues with it.

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.000
People ask me
about this.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.959
These are actually
minor things to me.

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:21.180
One person just
told me that

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:22.569
they bought
the nutribullet

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:24.040
recently and it
leaked.

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.230
It burnt out the motor.

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:27.230
And
you know

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:28.810
people are having
issues with it.

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:29.930
Other than this
leak issue

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:32.120
witch is basically
like I said

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.230
because this thing gets
loose and you

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:35.310
overfill it.

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:37.790
I dont have any problems
with this thing

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:39.250
and
these things

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:40.250
I can
overlook.

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:42.120
I wipe it out
witch I'm about to do

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:45.230
I'm going to
take a paper towel

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:46.230
wet it slightly
and just

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:47.250
wipe it out.

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:48.730
And its not going to
have any problems.

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:49.730
I haven't had
any problem

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:51.800
with the motor.

00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:55.130
So
these are things

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:57.220
to look for
if you are purchasing

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:58.393
the nutribullet
or of you

00:02:58.393 --> 00:03:00.670
are thinking about purchasing
ther are some issues.

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:02.860
I have heard that
the company has

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:04.810
made the newer
versions better.

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:06.980
So it doesnt
have these issues.

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:09.510
The blade is reenforced
around the bearing

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.599
part
and

00:03:11.599 --> 00:03:12.650
just little
minor things.

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:14.959
For me these
are not really

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:16.900
big issues
compared to

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.360
what the nutribullet
does for me.

00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:21.680
So
you know

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:23.470
I'm just
bringing this to

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:24.799
peoples attention.

00:03:24.799 --> 00:03:26.470
There are
certain

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:28.530
risk factors
with using a

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:29.819
nutribullet
it does have its

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:30.950
little drawbacks
but those

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:32.500
are the only ones
and

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:34.590
if
for me

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:36.579
this is not a reason
not to purchase

00:03:36.579 --> 00:03:38.720
this
product.

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:42.269
So dont let that
be an excuse

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:43.380
not to purchase
the product

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:47.269
because
the bad things...

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:48.650
the positives
greatly outweigh

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:50.550
the negatives
with this.

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:52.170
So
I just hope this

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:54.520
helps anybody
who has

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:56.370
a nutribullet
who is thinking baout

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:57.370
getting a
nutribullet

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:00.510
You have to take
the good

00:04:00.510 --> 00:04:01.510
with the bad
I guess but

00:04:01.510 --> 00:04:03.989
its not that serious
at least not for me.

00:04:03.989 --> 00:04:04.989
So
any questions

00:04:04.989 --> 00:04:07.390
