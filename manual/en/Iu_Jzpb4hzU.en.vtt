00:00:00.893 --> 00:00:05.393
Today we are at the beautiful "Paseo Santa LucÃ­a"

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:12.500
 I'll teach you an exercise a little bit more difficult

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:14.500
We will enter to the basket whit the rope turning above our heads

00:00:14.263 --> 00:00:17.263
I recommend you to use a cap or a hat

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:29.359
Ok, to start the excercise you have to have a roll in the rope

00:00:31.166 --> 00:00:36.166
I will show you the exercise in slow motion

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:34.929
And now I'll teach you the "alfilerillos"

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:40.640
You'll start with the railings

00:01:42.051 --> 00:01:46.180
and then you start to rise up your legs

00:02:01.697 --> 00:02:08.040
It's really important to practice the railings, in 
 that way you will do the alfilerillos.

00:02:28.315 --> 00:02:38.060
I'll see you next and remember to practice everything

00:02:37.392 --> 00:02:42.960
I hope that you continue watching every week our videos
