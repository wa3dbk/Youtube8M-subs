00:00:00.729 --> 00:00:06.680
Okay, so I'm going to teach you a really cool
clawing trick. It's a trick start and for

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:10.559
this I've switched over to some bean bags
and I'm going to break the trick down for

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:17.039
you a little bit in pieces. Let's use two
different colored bean bags for this. Okay,

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:22.410
the trick is basically going to look like
this, (example) where you're going to claw

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:29.550
two balls out of the air and then keep juggling.
Now the first step is to claw the two balls,

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.119
so you're going to have a third ball here.
But what's going to happen is you're going

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:35.780
to throw then up and you're going to claw
the two balls down and there's going to be

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:40.620
one left. So its going to go - one, two, like
that. You're going to throw them up in the

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:45.170
air - one, two. I usually do it with a little
bit of a snap like that, because it gives

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:51.949
it a little more pop and you claw like that
 - so pop and claw. Now, the way you set this

00:00:51.949 --> 00:00:59.170
up is you put a ball here and the balls are
going to go up in the air, kind of in a triangle

00:00:59.170 --> 00:01:05.570
kind of pattern like that. You definitely
want them to fly up on the air with one ball

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:14.290
on top and two balls underneath. So it's going
to be (snap) like that. (Snap) One ball definitely

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:19.390
protrudes higher than the others. So what's
going to happen is - you claw those two and

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:23.000
you catch the remaining one. You're going
to claw the bottom two, in this case the two

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.540
red ones, and then the red and black one we're
just going to catch into the pattern. So it's

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:33.351
up, claw, claw and catch. It's a fast trick;
it takes a little bit of work. (Snap) But

00:01:33.351 --> 00:01:40.520
if you work on it and you focus on it, it's
up, down, down, and like that. And you claw

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:46.670
the right hand first and pull it down because
that gives you enough time to aah, basically

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:50.041
one of these is going to hit the floor when
I do the trick, but you'll see. (Snap) You're

00:01:50.041 --> 00:01:53.890
clawing the right hand first and that gives
you enough time to grab that red and black

00:01:53.890 --> 00:02:05.570
one. So with just the right hand you're doing
that, okay? Kind of a hard trick to do, slow-motion,

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:10.990
but that's how it goes. It's up, down and
then catch the top one in that triangle and

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:17.111
that's how to do the clawing trick start into
a juggling pattern. One more time, this is

00:02:17.111 --> 00:02:24.189
what it's going to look like; (juggling) and
that's how you do the claw trick start.
