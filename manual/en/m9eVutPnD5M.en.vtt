00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:22.640
Max also gives you the opportunity to give
a surface the appearance as if it's giving

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:23.939
off light.

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:28.359
What if we for this example take the upper
sample slot here and change it to pure red.

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:33.360
So we'll simply grab the saturation, go to
the far right, and add a little more of the

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.219
red color, there we're.

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.210
Now for my example I think what I'll do is,
go ahead and take this sample ball and just

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:42.729
drag and drop it a copy
to the next slot, and then one more time.

00:00:42.729 --> 00:00:46.790
So when we're done, we should have three red
balls all riding along at the top of the Editor.

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:51.660
Select the second ball, when I talked about
controlling the amount of light that it appears

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.530
to be giving off,
as if it's glowing, we're talking about this

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:56.259
Self Illumination setting.

00:00:56.259 --> 00:01:00.110
Be aware that the object with Self Illumination
doesn't actually give off light,

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:01.920
only gives the impression that it does.

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:03.290
Now watch how this works.

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:06.900
If we take our Self Illumination up to maybe
a value of 50,

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:09.850
look what happens to the sample ball, it indeed
brightens up.

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:13.810
So you might add a little Self Illumination
to maybe create a bright light for a car or

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:15.490
maybe a light for a lamp bulb.

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:19.759
Now if we take the one to the far right and
crank the Self Illumination up to a 100,

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:22.040
I want you to know some couple of things.

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:26.740
A, it does indeed become brighter, but look
at the lack of depth and dimension that you

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.159
are getting
with using such a high Self Illumination.

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:34.500
You see, adding the Self Illumination, what
it does is, it reduces the amount of the Ambient

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:35.500
color.

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.130
In other words, it takes out the areas of
the surface that aren't lit, and in doing

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:42.630
so, you reduce the contrast,
and as a direct result, you lose a little

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:43.630
of your dimension.

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:44.660
So be careful.

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:48.170
Self Illumination can be used when you want
to add a little bit of a brightness to a surface,

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.220
but when you go for throughout, you'll suffer
the consequences of flattening things out.

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:55.280
So that's pretty much what goes in the building
a solid color material.

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.510
Now next up, we probably have to learn something
about getting that puppy into the scene.

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:01.720
We'll take a look at how you do all that in
the next video.

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:10.439
Let's go check 
it out.
