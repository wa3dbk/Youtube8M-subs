Hello my name is Ashe.

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:11.200
Saturday was Spike's Video Game Awards, renamed
this year to VGX.

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:15.250
The event being much smaller, opting out of
the normal stage award show for a smaller,

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:21.330
more quaint dwelling hosted by Geoff Keighley
and, interestingly enough, Joel McHale of

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:22.330
the Soup.

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:26.720
I could make many jokes on my surprise as
Joel McHale as the show's host, but that'd

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:32.410
be as dreary as the same shade of his jokes
on "gamers being basement dwelling misanthropes"

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:34.640
that coursed throughout the entire night.

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.620
Disregarding that, one thing I did enjoy was
the involvement of game developers in this

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:41.670
award show, illustrating that the industry
still got it.

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.460
Let's go one by one, talking about my personal
highlights.

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.850
I'd talk about it all, but personally I don't
want to get striked by Viacom.

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.530
So, here we go.

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:55.110
Telltale made the biggest mark at VGX, announcing
two new episodic games, both Tales of the

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.680
Borderlands as well as Game of Thrones.

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.880
This pins the number of games and content
at Telltale to be released now across four

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:07.110
different games - including the Walking Dead
Season Two as well as The Wolf Among Us.

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:12.090
Many hail Telltale as the studio to watch,
what with Walking Dead coming out as an amazing

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:13.090
success last year.

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:17.450
Even I hailed it as an awesome opportunity
on stream during the Legion of Geeks VGX cast

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:18.950
on Saturday.

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:24.209
BUT...one thing that has me strongly curious
is the talent at Telltale Games and who will

00:01:24.209 --> 00:01:25.219
take the reins.

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:31.909
A few months ago, two of the leading writers
for Telltale, both Jake Rodkin and Sean Vanaman,

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:35.959
left Telltale in order to found a new studio
Campo Santo.

00:01:35.959 --> 00:01:40.939
Both writers were heavily engaged in the past
games, including the chapters for Walking

00:01:40.939 --> 00:01:41.939
Dead.

00:01:41.939 --> 00:01:46.520
Whether this affects the talent pool for Telltale,
who is known for their award-winning narrative

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:48.780
driven titles, remains to be seen.

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:54.109
Telltale Games will be releasing Season 2
of the Walking Dead this month on the 17th.

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:56.709
I guess we can start there.

00:01:56.709 --> 00:01:59.560
In other news, do you know who Hello Games
are?

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:05.959
Apparently, a group of four ridiculously talented
designers who mystified new viewers with their

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:10.460
game No Man's Sky, a massive sci-fi exploration
sim.

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:11.880
What can you do?

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.470
Why, you can walk around a world.

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:15.830
Hop in a spaceship.

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:19.310
Fly throughout space...then descend into a
new planet.

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:20.390
Without loading.

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:26.700
Joe Danger, developer at Hello Games revealed
the trailer at VGX - sadly, no release date

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.530
or platform information has been released
yet.

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.520
But I don't care - take my money.

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:35.310
Take my money, now.

00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:39.590
Speaking of take my money, I literally jump
around for the new Witcher 3 trailer that

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:42.950
came out at the end of VGX.

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.000
It's gorgeous, only expected from CD Projekt
Red.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.320
Geralt returns in the multi-region open world
game.

00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:54.100
Dear god it's pretty and the expansiveness
of the cities look fantastic.

00:02:54.100 --> 00:03:01.350
I suggest you look in the description below
for the trailer, as well as all trailers for

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:03.540
the games I mentioned previously.

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:04.900
Is there anything else?

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:06.900
I guess South Park is still a thing.

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:11.510
Not only is it a thing but the trailer is
hilarious - a tutorial on how to send your

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:13.830
farts as a spell against the enemy.

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:18.560
It was quite perfect, and after the lead-up
after the latest episodes of Black Friday

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:23.500
involving the Xbox and PS4 console war, it
was magnificently crafty.

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:29.740
Lastly, a quick "have my babies" to MEGA64
who during their video segment, effectively

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:34.020
grilled the video game industry in less than
2 minutes, saying everything the industry

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:37.660
has wanted to say out loud, but instead, did
it on television.

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:38.660
You guys are awesome.

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:43.590
Links are in the description, like and favorite
if you did.

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:48.160
If you're considering watching the VGX and
haven't done so, what are you doing don't

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:53.819
do it just look at the trailers cause the
award show was kind of a drag.

00:03:53.819 --> 00:03:55.500
Take care everyone - I'll see you next time.
