00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:19.700
A copedent very simply is just what the setup
is of the pedals and knee levers and what

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:23.360
is the role that each of those does.

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:30.260
This guitar is set up in a very common, typical
setup, and in this case, my copedent involves

00:00:30.260 --> 00:00:37.430
three pedals, which is very, very common for
this type of guitar, and five knee levers.

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:44.610
So in this case, the copedent, we have the
A, E, and C pedals, which is a very common

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:48.180
setup for the modern iteration.

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:55.750
The A pedal raises the B strings a whole step.

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:02.700
The B pedal will raise the G Sharp strings
a half step.

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:07.970
Now, when you're playing an E chord, if both
of those things happen at the same time, which

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:15.030
is a lot in pedal steel playing, you're going
to get suddenly an A chord.

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:24.200
The third pedal raises the E string and the
B string a whole step.

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:37.150
You can use it alone, but it's most commonly
used with the B pedal to make a minor chord.

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:41.890
If you're on the G fret and you use the B
and C pedals, you get an A Minor chord.

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:45.710
You also hear it a lot in this kind of lick.

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:51.759
Okay, so that's it for the pedals.

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:54.369
Now, the knee levers do a bunch of different
stuff.

00:01:54.369 --> 00:02:02.170
A very common setup is the left knee lever
going left will raise your E's a half step.

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:08.039
Likewise, the left knee going right is going
to lower the E's a half step.

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:10.340
The right knee going left is a tricky one.

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.599
It does many things.

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:20.120
It lowers the sixth string a whole step, and
on my guitar, it raises the first string a

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.370
whole step and the second string a half step.

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:29.489
You've got this kind of unusual thing where
that goes up and that goes down.

00:02:29.489 --> 00:02:33.150
Luckily, for obvious reasons, you don't use
these very often together.

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:39.069
There are cases of adding another knee lever
further in to separate those functions so

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:43.599
that you can have more flexibility in terms
of what you're doing.

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:50.230
Finally, the very last lever, the right going
right, will lower your second string a half

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:52.159
step.

00:02:52.159 --> 00:02:58.469
And then you feel that it's joining the ninth
string in the unison, and then, as a special

00:02:58.469 --> 00:03:05.480
bonus, they will both go down yet another
half step.

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:12.230
You get your seventh by lowering the half
step here.

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:16.730
That's an E seventh chord, and if you lower
it just a little more, that's going to be

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:18.420
your sixth.

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:24.040
Likewise, this lower D string gets lowered
to C Sharp also.

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:28.790
That's basically it for the copendent, a very
common, universal copendent for an E ninth

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:30.369
chromatic pedal steel guitar.
