00:00:00.775 --> 00:00:02.606
- We've been keeping secrets!

00:00:02.606 --> 00:00:04.214
- And secrets don't make friends.

00:00:04.214 --> 00:00:05.665
So, we have to tell you guys!

00:00:06.343 --> 00:00:07.418
- Get excited!

00:00:07.418 --> 00:00:09.371
(pop music)

00:00:11.468 --> 00:00:12.945
- Hey guys!

00:00:12.945 --> 00:00:14.159
- Oh my gosh.

00:00:14.159 --> 00:00:17.097
- So, something we need to tell you

00:00:17.097 --> 00:00:19.825
- It's not what you think it is.

00:00:19.825 --> 00:00:21.113
What do they think it is?

00:00:21.113 --> 00:00:21.682
- We're not pregnant!

00:00:21.682 --> 00:00:22.691
- We're not pregnant!

00:00:22.691 --> 00:00:22.984
- Sorry!

00:00:22.984 --> 00:00:26.112
If you guys have been
following us, everywhere,

00:00:26.112 --> 00:00:28.226
and I mean everywhere,
we've been dropping hints.

00:00:28.226 --> 00:00:29.587
- On Instagram

00:00:29.587 --> 00:00:31.822
- Hints, hints, hints

00:00:31.822 --> 00:00:33.711
- On our second channel TeeAndEss,

00:00:33.711 --> 00:00:35.417
which we've been doing some vlogs

00:00:35.417 --> 00:00:37.526
where you've seen sneak
peaks of this place.

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:42.116
We have moved, kind of.

00:00:43.299 --> 00:00:44.665
- A little bit of move-a-ture.

00:00:44.702 --> 00:00:47.206
- Move-a-ture? I like that.

00:00:47.752 --> 00:00:49.760
- So we still live where we live,

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:51.662
we still live in our houses.

00:00:51.662 --> 00:00:54.662
We have a new addition, to our family.

00:00:54.662 --> 00:00:57.657
- Oh my gosh, that's what
this video is, New Addition.

00:00:57.683 --> 00:01:00.990
- New addition, to our family,
and that is a city loft.

00:01:01.014 --> 00:01:03.107
- Yay! We are so excited.

00:01:03.107 --> 00:01:06.379
We feel like we have waited so long

00:01:06.379 --> 00:01:08.654
to kind of take a big
step with our channel.

00:01:08.654 --> 00:01:11.173
We went full-time three years ago,

00:01:11.173 --> 00:01:15.846
and it's kind of cramped with
the two of us in our houses,

00:01:15.846 --> 00:01:17.113
in our little filming rooms.

00:01:17.113 --> 00:01:18.414
You guys saw it, we sit on

00:01:18.414 --> 00:01:20.965
tiny little baby-stools on the ground.

00:01:20.965 --> 00:01:22.549
- We wreck the room all the time

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:24.723
because we have so much stuff,
like products that we buy,

00:01:24.723 --> 00:01:26.571
and we can't get rid of it,

00:01:26.571 --> 00:01:30.764
we can't give it away fast
enough to not junk everything up.

00:01:30.764 --> 00:01:33.608
So, we were like office,
should we get an office?

00:01:33.608 --> 00:01:36.080
We thought, our job's not conventional

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:38.213
and that would be kind of boring
to be in this stuffy office

00:01:38.213 --> 00:01:41.199
when we could do kind of
the best of both worlds

00:01:41.199 --> 00:01:42.804
and have all of it.

00:01:42.804 --> 00:01:44.450
- Yes, so what we've done is

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.415
we've gotten kind of a
loft-style apartment,

00:01:47.415 --> 00:01:49.002
and we've gotten it together.

00:01:49.002 --> 00:01:53.349
It's a space that we are
going to use to work from,

00:01:53.349 --> 00:01:56.255
to do really fun videos for you guys.

00:01:56.255 --> 00:01:59.241
We have another channel that
we've kind of used in the past,

00:01:59.241 --> 00:02:01.069
but it's gotten a brand-new makeover.

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:02.532
- We made it over, just
like we're going to

00:02:02.532 --> 00:02:04.591
make over this entire loft.

00:02:04.591 --> 00:02:05.818
- We are!

00:02:05.818 --> 00:02:10.114
- It is officially called CheapToChic.

00:02:10.114 --> 00:02:13.710
It's kind of a branch and
extension on what we already do,

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:16.025
because you guys know we
love affordable everything.

00:02:16.025 --> 00:02:16.697
- Affordability!

00:02:16.697 --> 00:02:20.170
- This channel is a lot
of fashion and beauty

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:23.746
and that kind of realm,
like personal stuff.

00:02:23.746 --> 00:02:25.961
This channel is going to be more of

00:02:25.961 --> 00:02:30.319
DIY and room stuff.

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:34.090
- Room decor, apartment tour, loft tour;

00:02:34.090 --> 00:02:36.794
just kind of a space
where we can show you guys

00:02:36.794 --> 00:02:40.354
how we would affordably
decorate and furnish.

00:02:40.354 --> 00:02:42.320
You guys could get great ideas.

00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:44.168
If you are moving into an apartment

00:02:44.168 --> 00:02:45.530
or it could even be a house

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:47.338
because it's got two
rooms that are going to be

00:02:47.338 --> 00:02:49.146
bedrooms that we are going to use.

00:02:49.146 --> 00:02:50.955
It's also a space where
we can have people come

00:02:50.955 --> 00:02:53.624
and stay with us when
they're in from out of town.

00:02:53.624 --> 00:02:55.200
- It's kind of like a guest loft

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.745
for our friends and
family slash work space,

00:02:56.745 --> 00:02:59.112
so it's kind of a little bit of both.

00:02:59.112 --> 00:03:02.281
It's fun, it's an extension
of our houses we already have,

00:03:02.281 --> 00:03:03.784
which are kind of tiny by the way,

00:03:03.784 --> 00:03:06.060
so instead of getting a bigger house,

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:07.787
we just got another one.

00:03:07.787 --> 00:03:09.900
- So here's what we want you guys to do.

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.399
We are going to have kind of a before

00:03:12.399 --> 00:03:14.837
of our apartment loft tour of this space

00:03:14.837 --> 00:03:17.498
over on youtube.com/CheapToChic

00:03:17.498 --> 00:03:19.769
- (Stefanie) You can either
do CheapToChic or EleventhGTV.

00:03:19.774 --> 00:03:22.293
We renamed it from
EleventhGTV to CheapToChic,

00:03:22.293 --> 00:03:24.305
but both names redirect so if you forget

00:03:24.305 --> 00:03:26.600
and use that one, it still
gets you to the same place.

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:29.201
- Also, on a little sidenote,
you noticed the echo.

00:03:29.201 --> 00:03:31.111
It's because it's pretty bare.

00:03:31.111 --> 00:03:32.350
- There's no furniture!

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:36.292
Yes, we did strategically
place items to make it not look

00:03:36.292 --> 00:03:38.303
empty because we're
trying to hold out before

00:03:38.303 --> 00:03:40.436
we completely decorate the place

00:03:40.436 --> 00:03:41.862
so we can do content for it.

00:03:41.862 --> 00:03:44.236
- And take you guys along
with us as we're going out

00:03:44.236 --> 00:03:46.364
and getting pieces to put
in here to show you guys

00:03:46.369 --> 00:03:48.014
how you can do it.

00:03:48.014 --> 00:03:49.477
We have been finding some amazing things,

00:03:49.477 --> 00:03:50.695
we cannot wait to show you guys.

00:03:50.695 --> 00:03:52.708
- We haven't even gotten
into any kind of DIY yet.

00:03:52.708 --> 00:03:54.699
Those are even more fun.

00:03:54.699 --> 00:03:57.417
- Lots of projects, lots
of fun stuff, so make sure

00:03:57.417 --> 00:03:59.866

out that apartment tour.

00:03:59.866 --> 00:04:02.202
We'd also love to hear you guys tell us

00:04:02.202 --> 00:04:04.152
the kinds of things you'd
like to see over here.

00:04:04.152 --> 00:04:06.875
Video ideas, whatever
it is that you're like,

00:04:06.875 --> 00:04:08.520
gosh, I really need that in my life,

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:10.207
tell us and we'll try to do it.

00:04:10.207 --> 00:04:11.532
- Alright guys, we're getting excited!

00:04:11.532 --> 00:04:12.706
The apartment tour is already there,

00:04:12.706 --> 00:04:14.513
