00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.180
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:05.180
Some would say the excitement
is gone from travel,

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:07.470
as if additional
fees, flight delays,

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.710
and security hassles
weren't enough.

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:12.060
There's a blandness
to everything.

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:13.950
We check into a
hotel in Chicago that

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:16.020
looks the same as
the one in Miami,

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:21.160
same room, same decor, same
cup of coffee, same menu even.

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:24.030
It's any town, anywhere.

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:25.980
Sure, we may get a random
glimpse of the city

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.341
through our cab window, but can
we really say we've been there?

00:00:30.341 --> 00:00:35.640
It used to be travel was
exhilarating, memorable, even

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:36.990
mysterious.

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:41.160
Where is he off to, we'd
say, or she's so worldly.

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.270
We used words like journey,
expedition, or adventure

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:48.480
to describe our travels to the
ever-attentive ears of friends,

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.360
family, and coworkers
upon our return.

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.640
Even if our trips
centered around business.

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.010
We knew we had been
somewhere exciting.

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.270
We'd seen something, tasted
something, heard something new.

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:04.810
Travel enhanced our character
and made us more interesting.

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:07.770
What if there was a place
that could bring that back?

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.240
A place that made
us wish we could

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.890
stay longer, that put us in
touch with the city around us.

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:18.490
Welcome to Omni, luxury hotels
as unique as the many gateway

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:21.610
cities and leisure
destinations they inhabit, all

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:23.920
sharing a common set of values.

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.130
Travel should be memorable,
hospitality genuine,

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:32.940
experiences authentic, and
every moment an opportunity

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:34.780
because at Omni,
we know people are

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:36.520
the heart and soul of service.

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:39.310
People who can at any moment
bring the little things

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:43.780
to life, so that when you leave,
there's a great story to tell--

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:46.270
a story about new
friends and brisket tacos

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:52.570
in Fort Worth, tales of a sunset
over 16 at Tucson National.

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:54.620
Or how you've never
tasted anything,

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:58.440
like the melt-in-your-mouth
beignets of the Big Easy.

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:00.830
It's the romance of
hopping off a cable car

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:03.290
and into your room along
California Street in San

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:06.860
Francisco, and the ultimate
history lesson for your group

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:09.789
from the Omni Parker
House in Boston.

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:13.840
With each city a story, and
every story is so unique,

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.770
you'll have others wishing
they had been there too.

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:20.820
We call it travel [? ending. ?]
It's what we inspire.

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:22.770
It's everything we are.

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:27.730
It's how it used to be
and still is at Omni.
