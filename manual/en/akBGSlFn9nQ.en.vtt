00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:04.290
MCubed is a revolutionary way to fund
research. It's part of the university of

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.880
Michigan's Third Century initiative.
Here's how it works. Researchers from all

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.660
over the U of M campus will be given
tokens worth twenty thousand dollars

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.989
that they can use if they collaborate with
two other researchers.

00:00:15.989 --> 00:00:20.009
The tokens are worth nothing until
combined to form a cube.

00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:23.599
When three faculty agree to collaborate
in a project they take their tokens and

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:25.579
combine them to form a cube.

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:29.849
They immediately have sixty thousand dollars
for their research project.

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:33.800
That money can be used to hire a graduate
assistant and the graduate assistant can

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.540
work with the faculty on the project to
produce results.

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:39.910
Here's how it will work on the web.

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:43.240
Researchers will need to log into the
MCubed website using their kerberos

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:44.930
password. 

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:48.260
On the site you'll find a project you
want to join. Click on any one of the

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.210
projects in the gallery to learn more
information.

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:54.890
Some projects may have one collaborator
signed up

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:59.760
others may already have two and some
projects will already be fully cubed.

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.240
If you are interested in a project
but not sure if you want to join yet, you

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:05.730
save it in a folder.

00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:09.090
And you can search for projects in
different categories.

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.850
You can also create a project proposing
one or more ideas.

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:16.840
For each proposed project you should give
it a name and write a brief description.

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.250
Then submit the project.

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:22.720
Each project will appear on the site for
others to find.

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:26.210
If you already have a project and are
looking for a collaborator, click on

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.360
locate collaborators and find a
researcher who will bring the kind of

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.960
background you need for your project.

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:35.190
You can use smart folders to save
profiles and you can search for

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:37.950
collaborators in a variety of ways.

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:42.200
Each researcher will have a profile page
with information about their background

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.909
as well as any projects they have
proposed.

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:49.369
And if you have questions there's a page
that explains the program and has a list

00:01:49.369 --> 00:01:52.950
of frequently asked questions.

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.870
MCubed will make Michigan a leader in
developing new innovative ways to fund

00:01:56.870 --> 00:01:57.120
research.
