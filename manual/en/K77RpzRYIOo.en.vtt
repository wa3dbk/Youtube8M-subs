00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:23.120
We're waiting.... The sun's rising, but it's pouring out.

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:28.300
We're in France, and Tiddo will take the wheel. I'm going to sleep.

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:45.760
Peter, if you see this: enjoy your holiday.

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:49.900
I'm still in the Netherlands. I'm doing something fun tofay though, I'm visiting the Ster Foundation.

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:56.900
We're on our way to a clubhouse for Ster. Ster is a foundation for kids that feel insecure or alone,

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:08.000
...and they asked me to come by and cheer them up a little.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:13.700
That's what I'm doing today. Also, I'm going to pee. But don't film that. That's illegal.

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:19.120
I can't believe this.

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:21.600
Say it to the camera. Can you believe this?

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.880
I CAN believe it. But now, when I have a close look...

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:31.360
We had to drive for so, so long. Hated that. But now we're here...

00:01:32.065 --> 00:01:34.065
Time to enjoy ourselves.

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:48.760
We've arrived... In what seems to be the South of freaking France. Also known as Veze.

00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:53.820
It's so peaceful. I understand why they would put a camp here, it's really really peaceful.

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.320
I'm excited.

00:01:56.320 --> 00:02:02.800
I'm a little excited. It's a little scary... But in the end, they're still people, you know?

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:08.040
I really feel like eating though, but I don't know who to sit next to...

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:10.260
I think it'll be wise to sit next to each other, man...

00:02:19.132 --> 00:02:21.132
I love this.

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.120
Hey, everyone!

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:36.660
What's up everyone? It's sunday, we planned to go out tonight but we didn't do a whole lot of research... At all.

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.660
We're literally the only ones at this party.

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.940
This is the worst thing I've ever experienced in my life.

00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:53.580
We're grilling some meat...

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.620
We're going out later...

00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:08.300
Let's make some dance- uh, moves. Let's make some moves.

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:13.640
She is one of your, well, not one of your, probably just your biggest fan.

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:14.780
What's your name?

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:15.280
Amber.

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:16.280
Amber? Come here.

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:22.760
Hey, high five! You did it!

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:25.080
Mert's off partying, I'm going to play some soccer.

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:29.080
That's what's different between us two. He has to work, while I get invited to play.

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:42.100
I finally feel like I'm good at this.

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:48.420
We met 4 cute Spanish girls today... And we wanted to throw a poolparty with barbecue for them today.

00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:52.960
I'm going to pick them up in a few minutes, and then we're going to throw a sick party for these latina ladies.

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:08.960
The girls don't want to dance with us, so... I don't think our plan is working.

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:13.320
Our plan might not work, but we still have each other. Right, Peter?

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:15.160
Plus, we dance a LOT better than those girls.

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:17.720
Look at those hips. Look at those ridiculously smooth hips.

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:32.080
Everyone wants to sleep, but the girls won't stop dancing. They're Spanish after all.

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:36.280
I'm about to throw a watermelon...

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:37.179
...That one...

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:39.880
Into the water.

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:50.720
Peter, no. PETER, NO!

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:52.200
Do it, Peter. DO IT.

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:54.460
Peter, noooo!

00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:01.500
Enjoy, guys.

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:03.500
Anyone want a piece of watermelon?

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:08.460
I'm at the train station right now. We just left the camp.

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:16.520
As you guys saw... It was crazy. It was awesome to see how much these kids admired what Mert and I do...

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:21.500
Lots of fun. I have a train to catch, and Peter: enjoy your holiday. See ya.

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:24.480
Look at me, I'm Kelvin!

00:05:29.940 --> 00:05:31.120
No.
