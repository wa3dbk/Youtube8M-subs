00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:08.950
FEMALE SPEAKER: I'm sitting here
with Kwanza Jones to talk

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:11.030
about her new video,
"Time to Go."

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:11.640
KWANZA JONES: That's it.

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:12.650
FEMALE SPEAKER: Can you
tell us a little

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:13.570
bit about the concept?

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:17.040
KWANZA JONES: Oh, yeah. "Time
to Go," it's supposed to be

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:20.170
this futuristic, out of
this world fantasy.

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:21.230
FEMALE SPEAKER: Your
fantasy is amazing.

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:23.360
The costumes are incredible
in the video.

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:23.826
KWANZA JONES: Thank you.

00:00:23.826 --> 00:00:25.690
So you wouldn't see somebody
walking down

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:26.300
the street that way?

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:27.840
FEMALE SPEAKER: No,
not usually.

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.110
Unless Lady Gaga goes out every
day, I've never seen

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:30.890
something like it.

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:31.160
KWANZA JONES: OK.

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.320
FEMALE SPEAKER: Where do you
find your inspiration?

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.620
KWANZA JONES: Oh,
travel, life.

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:37.280
I mean, I travel a lot.

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.820
And that's really where I get
a lot of inspiration from.

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:45.070
What I like to do with any
choreographers I work with--

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:46.030
they're creatives
as well, too.

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:47.140
They're artists as well, too.

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:51.140
So it's this merging of my
vision with their vision, and

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:52.950
trying to have this one--

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:54.800
just make it something special
and something unique.

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:58.850
And so with Marko, I knew he
would bring in a lot of very

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:00.640
intricate and detailed
sorts of moves.

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:02.850
FEMALE SPEAKER: The dancing
has amazing--

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:03.575
it's so different.

00:01:03.575 --> 00:01:06.100
It's so crazy, so all
over the place.

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:07.780
But it's really fun
at the same time.

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:08.180
KWANZA JONES: Right.

00:01:08.180 --> 00:01:09.110
And that's what it's
supposed to be.

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:11.210
FEMALE SPEAKER: So I wanted to
ask you, what can we look

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:11.790
forward to?

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:13.100
What do you have coming up?

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:15.740
KWANZA JONES: So what's coming
up on the Supercharged album

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:20.070
is actually the single and the
song "Supercharged." So we've

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:23.400
got a video that's coming, we
have tours that are coming up,

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:26.150
and just a lot of
great things.

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:28.360
"Supercharged," we're going
brand new with everything.

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.730
New choreographer, new dancers,
so auditions are

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:31.435
being held.

00:01:31.435 --> 00:01:33.345
FEMALE SPEAKER: Now, what do
you look for out of your

00:01:33.345 --> 00:01:35.580
dancers in these auditions?

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:39.080
KWANZA JONES: It's a merger
between what my interests are

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.960
and the vision and goal is for
the choreographers, what the

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:43.590
director's is as well too.

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:46.270
So of course ability and
technical mobility and skill

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:47.380
is important.

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:52.150
But moreso than even that, it's
like supercharged-- it's

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:52.660
like an energy.

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:57.110
It's this intangible thing that
you cannot even put a

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:59.140
word on, but when you
see it, you know it.

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:00.350
And it's that feeling.

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:04.370
And so that is even more
important than how great you

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:06.030
can do a plie.

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:07.740
FEMALE SPEAKER: Kwanza, thank
you so much again for coming

00:02:07.740 --> 00:02:08.539
to meet with us.

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:11.650
And make sure to check out
her video, "Time to Go."
