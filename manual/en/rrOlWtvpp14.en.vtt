00:00:00.429 --> 00:00:05.289
Getting rid of fat, part 17. My free belly
fat book talks about the importance of leptin

00:00:05.289 --> 00:00:12.940
and the easiest way to make this master fat
hormone work better for fat loss. Hi, this

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:18.480
is Dr. Dennis Clark again, research scientist,
talking to you in my next phase, my next segment,

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.220
on belly fat science based on the research
I’ve done in the medical literature about

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.560
how to get rid of belly fat. Today I want
to talk about the importance of making your

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:34.090
hormone, leptin, work for you. As I mentioned
in one of my other videos, leptin is called

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:40.070
the master fat hormone. When leptin is working
for you the right way, there is no way you

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:47.100
can gain excess fat or maintain that fat belly.
Here’s the most important key for getting

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:53.360
your leptin metabolism working for you to
metabolize fat the best possible way. What

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:58.829
you want to do is get leptin to mobilize fat,
or create a signal for mobilizing fat, in

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:04.110
between meals for the longest stretch of spacing
between meals that you have on a regular basis,

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:09.409
and that is between dinner one evening and
breakfast the next day. The way hormones work

00:01:09.409 --> 00:01:15.549
after a meal and the way they cycle, you’ll
actually get to a point nine to ten hours

00:01:15.549 --> 00:01:21.790
after you eat, until you get all the food
gone and all the metabolism in the right place

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:26.350
between meals except for one thing. At that
point, nine to ten hours after you eat is

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:31.560
when fat metabolism goes into high gear. If
you’re in the habit of eating a late night

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.920
snack or eating after dinner, or not waiting
at least twelve hours between dinner and breakfast

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:41.720
the next day, then you are not getting the
benefits of enhancing the leptin hormone that’s

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:49.189
supposed to work for you in metabolizing fat
the way it should. Yes, it’s pretty simple

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:53.170
to maximize the effects of your leptin by
just changing your eating pattern, taking

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:58.560
advantage of the natural balance and cycling
of your master fat hormone. You can find out

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:04.450
more about how to do this, and what you do
to counteract that in your lifestyle by reading

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:10.049
