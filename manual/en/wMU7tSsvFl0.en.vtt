00:00:17.849 --> 00:00:19.849
Now I am on my way to Senopati

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:24.020
I am going to change hair at my friend's salon

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.440
So, please keep following me !

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.480
That one is Arasseo, owned by @michimomo

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:47.780
And that one is Ryoji Sakate, my friend's

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:24.960
So we are taking off my hair extension now

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:30.400
I used to have short hair, but since I love long hair, I decided to put on hair extension

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:40.580
But we're going to remove it because Ryoji said it is not good for hair extension to be colored many times

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:46.200
Usually in Japan, they dont really color the hair extension. And everytime they have to color, they're gonna replace it

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.780
So for now, I will have short hair at the moment

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:50.760
I will just believe Japanese stylist lol

00:02:38.088 --> 00:02:40.088
Finished taking it off~

00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:57.720
After that, we moved to bleaching progress

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:04.960
The bleaching process is quite painful if you have sensitive scalp

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:09.020
I am crying most of the time too

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:24.980
To achieve ash, we need to remove the orange brassiness from bleaching. Hence we put purple

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:31.140
However the purple shouldn't be too strong otherwise it will be too bold. Just enough for a tint of color

00:03:38.700 --> 00:03:42.180
We're waiting for 20 minutes this time

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:16.800
Usually depending on my hair condition, I might or might not trim the ends

00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:24.620
Because it will help shaping the hair and get rid of the dead dry ends

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:47.960
This is how it looks like after my salon visit

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:56.500
And this is how it looks like after 2 times washing

00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:01.440
You can see that the purple is getting less and it shows grey-ashy tone more

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:10.860
Everytime you want to achieve ash tone, you need to know that orange from asian hair is against purple. Therefore, I use purple to neutralize the bleaching result

00:05:15.385 --> 00:05:20.605
