00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.230
Indore is a typical medium-sized Indian city with a 
population of 2 million. 

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:20.150
It's located in the center of the country in a state 
called Madhya Pradesh.  

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.120
EMBARQ came to Indore in 2007. 

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:30.000
At the city level we basically became official partners 
with AICTSL, which also runs the city bus service.

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:43.000
Before EMBARQ, things were not systematic, we lacked expertise, 
we were only experimenting and trying to improve.

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.000
So over time we helped them formerly set up a city bus 
service in Indore.

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:53.100
From the very inception of the company when we started buses, 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:57.230
once EMBARQ came into the picture, they have given us the 
technical guidance,

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:03.000
they have given us the exposure of how things are being 
done in different parts of the world.

00:01:03.230 --> 00:01:09.000
They had all these different types of technology in place, 
which were generating different kinds of data, 

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:12.000
but they didn't know how to create information out of it.

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:16.230
So one of the things that we helped them do was set up a 
performance monitoring system 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
by which they could measure the operations

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:25.000
and see if it was matching up to the quality that was 
required of the citizens of Indore.

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:30.230
Over three months of working with them there was a 30 
to 35 percent improvement 

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
just by making information out of the data that was coming. 

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:44.000
EMBARQ has helped us reformulate our rules, our routes, 
and the way public transportation is behaving in the city. 

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:48.150
They have made us see it in a different light.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.000
What makes Indore special, is that they're running the 
bus systems on a Public Private Partnership model. 

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:01.080
It's a model that's worked for Indore, and it's a model 
that could work for other Indian cities 

00:02:01.230 --> 00:02:05.000
who have no public transport systems to begin with.

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:11.150
In this model, the public agency is in charge of the infrastructure, 
while the private agency is in charge of operations. 

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:14.050
The private agency keeps all of the money that it collects, 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:22.000
and in return for running these operations, it gives the 
public agency a fixed amount every month.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000
I like to travel by bus. It's comfortable. Whenever I 
need to travel I go by bus.

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:31.000
We realized that the city buses in terms of numbers weren't enough

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:35.000
for the kinds of demands that the city was seeing. 

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:45.000
Basically AICTSL started with 37 buses and now has 
increased to 104 buses. 

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:51.000
Now with the JNnURM project, new buses are coming in and 
we will get 125 new buses. 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
We helped them procure the buses. 

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:59.080
We wrote the specifications, we put down contracts, we 
wrote requests for proposals.

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:04.150
As a result of which Indore has seen a 100 percent 
increase in its fleet.

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:13.000
As AICTSL provided the city with good transport, the government 
of India has sanctioned a Bus Rapid Transit project for Indore. 

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:26.000
This money will be used to build BRT stations, to set up an auto fare 
collection system, control room, transit / priority signals etc.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:34.000
After this is put into service, we will have approximately 
reduced travel time of the passengers by 20 minutes. 

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:38.000
Then we can attract more people towards public transportation.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:45.000
In a few year's time, the agency will be in charge 
of a much larger fleet.

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:50.000
It will also be in charge of operating and managing the BRT. 

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:57.000
I see AICTSL as one of the most important agencies for the 
city of Indore.
