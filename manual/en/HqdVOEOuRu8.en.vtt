Hi Malik the magic guy for expertvillage.com.
Now I want to show you a basic cut called

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:08.760
the swing cut. This doesn't look like much,
but there is actually other cuts that are

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.470
based on this that are going to be really
important as you learn more card magic later

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:17.619
on. So what you are going to do is take the
deck in a overhand grip like this. You are

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:22.079
going to have your three fingers. First, middle,
and ring finger here, your thumb here on the

00:00:22.079 --> 00:00:26.519
back of the deck. Now you are going to use
your first finger and you are going to break

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:33.050
off some cards like this and just swing them
to the side. Now I'm going to grab them right

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:38.250
here in this part of my hand, between my thumb
and the base of my first finger just like

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:44.430
this, and then I'm going to put this one top.
So the swing cut looks like this. Now you

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:53.730
can do this with multiple packets. Really
this just requires practice. But it is a nice

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:58.680
elegant looking to cut cards in your hands.
This is a genuine cut, so it will change the

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:06.010
order of the cards, but the swing cut looks
really cool. And the real key to this is really

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:11.479
not to hold the deck too hard; you don't want
to be pinching things too hard. And again

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:16.340
just practice and hold it by the ends, and
you want to break this up and swing it. You

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:21.149
don't have to swing it far, just about a Â¾
of a inch or a inch and you can grab that

00:01:21.149 --> 00:01:28.340
just like that. With multiple packets, that
can actually be a cool looking way to cut

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:34.810
some cards just like this. I should point
out that is you are using a key card on the

00:01:34.810 --> 00:01:40.119
bottom of the deck, multiple swing cuts can
be a way to have that card replaced. So if

00:01:40.119 --> 00:01:45.319
that is a selected card, if you do a few swing
cuts and they say stop, we put that back and

00:01:45.319 --> 00:01:50.499
you can drop this right on top, and that is
another way to place a key card... but that

00:01:50.499 --> 00:01:53.240
is how you do the swing cut.
