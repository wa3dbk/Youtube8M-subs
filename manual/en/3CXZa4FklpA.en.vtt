&gt;&gt; Wade: Hi, I'm Wade Wingler with the INDATA
Project at Easter Seals Crossroads in Indiana.

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:27.210
Today, we're going to spend a little time
in our lab with our intern Anne Carpenter

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.469
who's talking about assistive technology that
has been in the past done by devices but now

00:00:32.469 --> 00:00:36.620
there are apps to do the same or similar things
and so you might find some conveniences or

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:37.620
differences in cost.

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.239
So let's go into the lab here and spend a
little time with Anne.

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:43.920
&gt;&gt;Anne: Hi, today I'd like to show you some
assistive technology that we have in our loan

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:49.769
library and then talk about how in today's
world of the iPad, that all of these devices

00:00:49.769 --> 00:00:51.339
that I'm going to show you have an application.

00:00:51.339 --> 00:00:54.030
So, let's start with the Franklin Bill Reader.

00:00:54.030 --> 00:01:01.769
It's really easy, all you do is hold this
button down and hold the bill and it'll read

00:01:01.769 --> 00:01:02.769
it for you.

00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:05.030
Like I said, this is our Franklin Bill Reader.

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:09.420
The next piece I'd like to show you is the
Garmin, which I'm sure you're all very familiar

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:14.860
with, but what's nice about this is that you
can start with your current location and you

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:19.932
can find the nearest hospitals, police stations
and gas stations.

00:01:19.932 --> 00:01:23.780
This is great for visually impaired individuals
as well because it shows a walking path as

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.260
well as a driving path, so you have multiple
options.

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:33.210
The last device I want to show you is called
the Colorino Identifier, it's for color identifying

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:34.550
for people who are blind.

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:42.060
All you do is press this red button and hold
it up to something, and it got it right, I'm

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.330
wearing a black dress.

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:48.290
So now, I'd like to show you how all these
devices have an application.

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:52.220
OK, so I showed you the Franklin bill reader,
but now I want to show you an app that I have

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:54.000
on an iPad called the MoneyReader.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:59.090
So, you just open MoneyReader and what's nice
about the iPad too is that you have a little

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:03.120
2x zoom here, so for the visually impaired
this will really help you see.

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:10.399
All you do is hold the bill up to the camera,
"ten dollars," and it will name the bill for

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:11.399
you.

00:02:11.399 --> 00:02:13.780
OK, so I showed you the Garmin you can mount
in your car, but now I'd like to show you

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:18.160
the MapQuest app, which is right here, and
basically it has all the same wonderful options

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.620
that your Garmin has, such as maps and directions
and "my places" and settings but it'st just

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.819
available on your iPad and a little bit more
accessible.

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:30.480
Now, let's move on to our last application,
called the Color ID.

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:38.310
This is easy, it's already going without me,
all you do is hold it up against a color and

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:39.910
it will tell you what it's called.

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:45.640
The nice feature about this is you can check
it multiple times by clicking this, so if

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:55.130
you're not sure, and there you go.

00:02:55.130 --> 00:03:00.420
OK, so the advantage of having an iPad today
in the world of assistive technology is that

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:04.400
instead of having a bag full of assistive
technology following you where you go, you

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:08.900
have all of your applications on one iPad,
and it can be more cost effective in the long

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:14.170
run after purchasing your iPad the applications
are either free or for example our LookTel

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:18.960
application was only $9.99 in comparison to
our Franklin Bill Reader which is $300.

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:23.790
So, in case you have any questions or want
more information about applications be sure

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:28.459
to check out our website at www.eastersealstech.com.

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:33.930
&gt;&gt;Wade: So in the past, there was a device
to do that, but now there's an app for that.

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:37.650
That's your tech tip for this week, I'm Wade
Wingler with the INDATA Project in Indiana.
