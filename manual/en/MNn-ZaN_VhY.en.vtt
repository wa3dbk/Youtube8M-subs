00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:12.780
Okay, so this is Banawi behind me.

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:22.620
We're waiting for a bus like right over there. I'm with my travel companion Alina, and we're about to eat this. That is a...

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:26.460
Sapinit

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:31.200
Which is a wild raspberry. It's a little special shout out to

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:37.078
Victor because he wrote to me and said I should look for these while I was traveling around this area, and

00:00:37.239 --> 00:00:39.299
I found them! I found them while trekking.

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:45.809
They are known as the Philippine Raspberry, and

00:00:46.629 --> 00:00:51.149
I don't know what they taste like but they grow wild and they're just

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:58.619
starting to be cultivated and sold like in markets, but they are mostly just something you find.

00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:06.420
But special to the Philippines, so it's a very unique thing to try. It looks a little bit more like a...

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:13.120
Like a strawberry, or like a strawberry tree fruit, less of like a raspberry, but

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.720
I think they're supposed to taste like raspberries. I'll try one.

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:21.280
Alina you try one.

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:33.200
Yeah, it tastes more like a raspberry than a strawberry. Little bit like Raspberry.They're unremarkable though.

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:36.540
Not strong in taste. Not really.

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.280
It's got crunchy little seeds in it.

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:46.880
After you eat it, you have the same taste in your mouth that you have when you eat raspberries.

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:55.420
When you first put it in your mouth it's a... It's kind of like a little sour, but the aftertaste is more like raspberry.

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:58.509
It's subtle though. Not a lot of flavor.

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:07.119
Yeah, just kind of like water, maybe a little leafy. Little herbal tasting.

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:17.650
Yeah, they might get darker. I don't know, but they fell off the tree really easily, so I think they're ready.

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.400
I tested a few of them and some of them weren't quite there.

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:31.260
This one has a lot more flavor and it tastes very much like raspberry.

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:38.540
If you've ever had a wine berry they taste very similar to wine berry. Which is kind of like a raspberry,

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.610
or like a blackberry that grows in the wild.

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:46.159
Yeah, they're pretty good though. Like if you're like traveling and you see these.

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:49.459
If I would find them at the market I would definitely go for it.

00:02:49.709 --> 00:02:54.889
Yeah, if you're like walking around in a hike in the Philippines and you see them, definitely pick them because they're free.

00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:00.180
In the market I would buy them because you know berries are kind of hard to find here so,

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.360
I haven't had a berry in a while.

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:15.780
Yeah, these ones were pretty good, so if you see them, check them out, but... Not much else to say about it. Thanks!

00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:18.220
Bye!
