00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.460
Hello, my name is Jorday Rivera, and I am
an expert in salsa.

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:08.000
I own two dance studios in Queens, New York.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.910
We're going to be learning a progression of
salsa moves so we can actually go out, practice,

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:17.000
take it to the clubs, take it to a party,
and you can show off all the great moves you

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.310
learned.

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:28.599
This is the chord with a front double cross,
styled, with music.

00:00:28.599 --> 00:01:02.789
Now, the breakdown to the styled version of
the chord with a cross over, goes like this.

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:09.490
We're going to go basic and basic dip, and
you're going to drop.

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:11.180
Up the body ladies, and out.

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:12.180
Up the body, and up.

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:18.880
We're going to go to our basic, one, two,
three, five, six, seven.

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:21.900
One, three, five, six, seven.

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.920
Two, three, five, six, seven.

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.070
Basic two, three, five and drop.

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:31.730
One, three, five, sharp step.

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:34.670
One, three, sharp style.

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:37.689
One, two, three, and drop.

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:42.990
One, three, sharp and two, three, style, straight
up.

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.939
One, two, three and work, work, work.

00:01:46.939 --> 00:01:50.880
And outstep, work, work, style, straight up.

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.090
Basic two, three, hold, six, seven.

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:56.380
And that's how you style a chord for the front
double cross.

00:01:56.380 --> 00:01:56.649
New York style.
