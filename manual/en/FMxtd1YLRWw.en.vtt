00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:09.620
Print the PDF template

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:15.360
Cut to the approximate size the pieces

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:20.100
You don't have to be clean in this operation

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:26.400
Glue the pieces with stick glue, or with spray repositionable adhesive glue

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:32.420
Arrange the pieces on the cardboard

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:40.580
Cut to the approximate size the pieces

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:49.200
Use a blunt object, like a screwdriver, to mark the folds drawn on the pieces

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:58.880
Cut the pieces with scissors or craft knife

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:06.480
Fold the cardboard along the dotted lines

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:13.900
If you used a repositionable spry adhesive, detach the print paper from the cardboard before starting gluing

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:20.200
Glue the flaps with stick glue or vinylic glue

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:28.860
Start gluing only one flap at a time, and stick it on the corresponding edge, checking the numbers on the template

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:36.120
Wait a few seconds to let the glue dry before working on near edges

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:46.100
You can use a stick or a toothpick to work on small parts

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:51.740
To make the building process easier, close the points and the small parts before

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:58.000
Usa the table to have a flat surface to work on

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:04.560
Glue the most complex parts as last

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:10.500
Put your hand inside to glue easily the inner flaps

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:17.260
You can use a tool to apply a pressure from outside or inside if spaces are too small for your fingers

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:24.680
Remember that the printed side of the paper is supposed to be inside the model

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:31.480
This way you can print the template directly on the cardboard if you have a proper printer

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:41.700
Keep gluing all the parts until you finish the whole model

00:02:43.100 --> 00:02:46.580
Hang the model to the wall using a nail

00:02:48.735 --> 00:02:53.075
