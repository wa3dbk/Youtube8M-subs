00:00:00.269 --> 00:00:05.850
So, the next move I'm going to move into now
is the corkscrew. If anybody at home knows

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:10.360
about the corkscrew you no that's moving into
the wine bottle, so kids at home I don't really

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:14.540
think you should know about this right now,
so this is strictly for the adults right now.

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:19.210
So, what we are going move into like I said
is going to be, just like I said, having you

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:22.630
use it to move down into a wine bottle or
anything like that. You know, and then you?re

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:28.690
going to pop it out. So, what you want to
do is start getting the body set. Now, what

00:00:28.690 --> 00:00:33.590
you?re going to start with first is your right
over left, whatever side you actually want

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:38.210
to start on is ok as long as you get the right
space in between. Like I was saying you can

00:00:38.210 --> 00:00:42.620
bring your arm through and if you can touch
your shoulder you have enough space to allow

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:47.070
your body to turn. If you have your leg up
here where it's closer more to your left foot

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.710
and your going into a stretch it probably
9 times out of 10 it won't spin you as good

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:57.920
as you want to be spinning. Make sure, again,
you have that spacing. We're going to start

00:00:57.920 --> 00:01:01.510
with arms swinging again like I said cause
you always want to have your arms swinging

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:06.130
back and forth when ever you?re dancing. What
you?re going to do now is your going to start

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:10.970
spinning down into corkscrew into that wine
bottle now. What you want start doing is now

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:17.679
is it rise your wine bottle as you go down.
It gets kind of tricky right here so don't

00:01:17.679 --> 00:01:22.830
get discourage when you get to this part.
The left leg is going to fall down and naturally

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.779
the right leg is going to come up as you can
see this is what you should try in look like

00:01:26.779 --> 00:01:31.639
right now. Your left leg should be under you
and your right knee should be up and it should

00:01:31.639 --> 00:01:35.700
be sticking up, your right knee cap. Some
of your right now your going to probably be

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.810
sitting at home your probably like this in
a Indian position, your probably sitting back

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.380
more like this and it probably didn't work
out for you. So, again you want to make sure

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.689
your up on the tip of your toes and remember,
I said and I haven't forgotten I haven't told

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:52.420
you anything differently that you need to
be on the tip of your toes whenever you?re

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.349
dancing. So, for most people this is how you?re
going to end up. When you?re an expert or

00:01:56.349 --> 00:02:00.459
anything like that for today right now if
you?re a beginner don't worry about it so

00:02:00.459 --> 00:02:04.909
much. Just try to go through the techniques
and back around, just like we did with the

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:10.410
knee drop and your back to where you?re standing
again. So, one more time. I'm going to try

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:22.390
in show your from the front. Again, right
over left spinning down, at part make sure

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:30.160
you?re always spinning down whenever you?re
spinning. Left knee comes down, to your right

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.840
knee being up. This should be your posture
and your back should be straight. Spin back

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:41.060
out and back around back to where you were
standing again. There you go there is your

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:42.590
corkscrew as you go down right there.
