Hi! and welcome to Pintura Facil Para Ti.com (easy painting for you)

00:00:00.068 --> 00:00:05.067
Stay with us and paint with me this beautiful Christmas tree

00:00:16.068 --> 00:00:23.067
Before starting, I want to give a huge kiss and a hug to all the people 

00:00:23.068 --> 00:00:30.067

So let’s start painting the christmas tree and what I’m going to use is a paper mache tree

00:01:00.068 --> 00:01:09.067
it’s a kind of paper maché bag, that is sold in crafts shops 

00:01:09.068 --> 00:01:15.067
you can choose any shape of these papier mache bags to make your gifts

00:01:15.068 --> 00:01:20.067
or to perform this technique

00:01:20.068 --> 00:01:22.067
You’ll only need

00:01:25.068 --> 00:01:32.067
a nº 6 or 12 flat brush, a liner

00:01:32.068 --> 00:01:36.067
acrylic painting in forest green, fire red and gold

00:01:36.068 --> 00:01:38.067
a little bit of floating gel or medium

00:01:38.068 --> 00:01:44.067
and... the tree

00:01:48.068 --> 00:01:57.067
so we’re going to start by painting with green smoothly

00:01:57.068 --> 00:02:10.067
We’re going to apply 2 or 3 layers until it covers very well the paper mache

00:02:12.068 --> 00:02:21.067
Remember to paint inside and the little tree bottom

00:02:21.068 --> 00:02:28.067
try to paint every part with green, because it is like a little “box” that you can see inside

00:02:28.068 --> 00:02:34.067
so the people can use it later to save there one things

00:02:34.068 --> 00:02:42.067
so I recommend to it all around

00:02:44.068 --> 00:02:48.067
next step will be to paint some tiny red daisies

00:02:48.068 --> 00:02:51.067
using the firered and a liner

00:02:51.068 --> 00:02:56.067
I have chosen to paint 5 petal flores 

00:02:56.068 --> 00:03:08.067
but you can paint them whatever you want that looks cute

00:03:08.068 --> 00:03:20.067
Fill all the tree surface with these tiny red daisies

00:03:20.068 --> 00:03:23.067
and you’ll see what a nice effect it gets

00:03:25.068 --> 00:03:35.067
maybe you’ll need to apply another red layer to every flower

00:03:35.068 --> 00:03:45.067
let them dry firstly

00:03:46.068 --> 00:03:56.067
when I paint this kind of project, I liked to paint until to the edges

00:03:56.068 --> 00:04:03.067
it seems to continue...

00:04:04.068 --> 00:04:20.067
so you can also paint until the edges to create this effect, painting half flowers on the edges

00:04:20.068 --> 00:04:27.067
Next step is very easy... as all the project

00:04:27.068 --> 00:04:40.067
we’ll use the brush wooden stick to paint little gold dots to create the center of each flower

00:04:41.068 --> 00:04:52.067
So, to each daisy we’ll paint a little gold dot on the center and you’ll see how nice it looks

00:04:53.068 --> 00:05:06.067
Once everything is dry, we’ll apply a gold glaze to turn it more Christmas and special

00:05:06.068 --> 00:05:20.067
so mix 4 to 5 medium drops with a drop of gold acrylic painting

00:05:20.068 --> 00:05:33.067
just a little bit of paint to create a this glaze to apply a layer 

00:05:33.068 --> 00:05:37.067
on the tree using a thick brush and covering all the flowers 

00:05:37.068 --> 00:05:52.067
and you’ll see a really nice shine appear

00:05:52.068 --> 00:06:00.067
Notice that I only painted the flowers front and back

00:06:00.068 --> 00:06:08.067
so the sides only have green paint

00:06:00.068 --> 00:06:14.067
but I’ll apply the gold glaze front and back, 

00:06:14.068 --> 00:06:29.067
but also on the sides, to create an effect of a gold ribbon around

00:06:31.068 --> 00:06:37.067
As a last step let it well dry and apply 2 or 3 layers of 

00:06:37.068 --> 00:06:46.067
varnish to well protect the little tree and use it many times

00:06:46.068 --> 00:06:53.067
or to decorate your home this christmas

00:06:54.068 --> 00:06:58.067
I hope you enjoy painting with me this little tree
