- Come on, let's go, I don't
want to miss the previews.

00:00:03.625 --> 00:00:05.223
- Have you seen my phone?

00:00:05.799 --> 00:00:07.160
- What? No.

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:10.510
- Well, I can't leave without
my phone, will you call it?

Weird Things Couples Do
When They Lose Their Phone

00:00:18.541 --> 00:00:20.708
- It just went to voice mail.

00:00:24.975 --> 00:00:27.849
Aw, come on!

00:00:28.073 --> 00:00:31.465
- Okay, I woke up, my phone
was charging, I grabbed it.

00:00:31.465 --> 00:00:32.609
- [Man] Checked Facebook.

00:00:32.609 --> 00:00:34.439
- Yeah, it helps me wake up.

00:00:34.439 --> 00:00:35.459
- [Man] And then what?

00:00:35.459 --> 00:00:36.684
- So I peed,

00:00:36.684 --> 00:00:38.906
and then while I was taking
a shower and getting ready,

00:00:38.906 --> 00:00:40.705
I was listening to a podcast on my phone.

00:00:40.705 --> 00:00:43.016
I remember because I
remember fast-forwarding

00:00:43.016 --> 00:00:45.074
through the first 15 minutes.

00:00:45.074 --> 00:00:46.170
- And then what?

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.800
- So I came into the
kitchen, I fed the fish.

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.290
I cleaned up the coffee.

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:52.380
I took a picture of Emmett
eating his breakfast.

00:00:53.272 --> 00:00:54.652
I didn't put it in the refrigerator.

00:00:54.652 --> 00:00:56.380
- Well, that's where it was last time.

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:58.305
- One time I do that and now you think

00:00:58.305 --> 00:01:00.096
I just leave my phone in the
refrigerator all the time?

00:01:00.096 --> 00:01:01.593
- Well, then I don't know where it is.

00:01:01.593 --> 00:01:02.776
- Well was it in the fridge?

00:01:02.776 --> 00:01:03.606
- No.

00:01:03.606 --> 00:01:06.140
- So I sat here and I texted my mom.

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:07.115
- Then what?

00:01:07.115 --> 00:01:09.100
- That's the last thing I remember.

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:11.650
- Well, then it must be
here somewhere, so...

00:01:13.172 --> 00:01:14.101
Did you find it?

00:01:14.101 --> 00:01:15.364
- No.

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:16.885
Did you find it?

00:01:17.486 --> 00:01:18.852
- Ah, there it is.

00:01:19.835 --> 00:01:20.961
My harmonica.

00:01:21.499 --> 00:01:22.502
- Great.

00:01:22.502 --> 00:01:24.040
- I thought I lost this.

00:01:25.685 --> 00:01:27.110
Did you find it?

00:01:27.571 --> 00:01:28.609
- No.

00:01:32.872 --> 00:01:34.162
Hey,

00:01:34.777 --> 00:01:35.654
focus.

00:01:35.654 --> 00:01:37.300
- We could just get you another phone.

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:38.393
- I can't get another phone.

00:01:38.393 --> 00:01:39.757
My whole life was on that phone.

00:01:39.757 --> 00:01:40.692
- Oh please.

00:01:40.692 --> 00:01:42.306
- Those pictures were on that phone.

00:01:42.306 --> 00:01:43.763
- What pictures?

00:01:43.763 --> 00:01:45.667
- Those pictures.

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:47.770
- Did you find it?

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:49.682
- No. Did you find it?

00:01:49.727 --> 00:01:50.919
- Nope.

00:01:51.212 --> 00:01:53.040
- Then where is it?

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.341
- Well, did you at least back it up?

00:01:54.341 --> 00:01:56.413
- I don't even know how to do that.

00:01:56.413 --> 00:01:57.650
- What do you mean?

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:58.643
You back up your phone.

00:01:58.643 --> 00:02:01.030
- Okay, walk me through
these specific steps

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:03.040
on how to back up your phone.

00:02:03.132 --> 00:02:04.500
- Okay, well you...

00:02:05.746 --> 00:02:06.827
Cloud.

00:02:06.827 --> 00:02:08.614
- You can't just say cloud!

00:02:08.614 --> 00:02:10.395
- We could just use my phone.

00:02:10.673 --> 00:02:12.436
- You only have a 4S.

00:02:13.498 --> 00:02:15.380
It's a little embarrassing.

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:16.997
- What does that mean?

00:02:16.997 --> 00:02:18.152
- I don't understand!

00:02:18.152 --> 00:02:21.050
My phone can't just
disappear into thin air!

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:22.393
- Well I don't know where it is, okay?

00:02:22.393 --> 00:02:23.353
We looked everywhere twice.

00:02:23.353 --> 00:02:25.020
- Are you sure you don't have it?

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:26.202
You're not just messing with me?

00:02:26.202 --> 00:02:27.674
- Why would I have your phone?

00:02:27.674 --> 00:02:31.110
I have my phone and my wallet.

00:02:35.171 --> 00:02:37.385
- I'm going to kill you.

00:02:37.775 --> 00:02:39.434
- Okay, there's an explanation for this.

00:02:39.434 --> 00:02:40.836
- Yeah, the explanation is

00:02:40.836 --> 00:02:43.811
I am going to murder you right now.

00:02:43.811 --> 00:02:45.741
- Oh, where is my phone?

00:02:46.619 --> 00:02:48.632
Oh, where can it be?

00:02:49.416 --> 00:02:51.399
I should take better care

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:54.508
of my expensive things.

00:02:58.089 --> 00:02:59.673
I lost my phone.

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.704
Oh, where could it be?

00:03:04.904 --> 00:03:06.971
Did you flush my...
