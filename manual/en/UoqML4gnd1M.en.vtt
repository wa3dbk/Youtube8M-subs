00:00:21.451 --> 00:00:24.003
Ten years ago I received
this phone call from Shell

00:00:24.003 --> 00:00:27.153
following up on an earlier
application I had with them

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:30.652
and an invitation to come to Holland
for a job interview.

00:00:30.863 --> 00:00:34.544
I went to this interview, and
I was very much impressed

00:00:34.588 --> 00:00:35.672
by what I had seen.

00:00:35.672 --> 00:00:39.513
At that moment I really knew that I
wanted to work for Shell.

00:00:39.830 --> 00:00:44.312
I'm Sadat Kolonic, and I'm the
senior exploration geochemist

00:00:44.312 --> 00:00:46.983
here with the Shell Petroleum
Development Company of Nigeria.

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:50.071
I started in the Netherlands,
I moved later on to Jordan

00:00:50.071 --> 00:00:51.617
and now I'm in Nigeria.

00:00:52.444 --> 00:00:55.547
I'm here with
the exploration capability team,

00:00:55.547 --> 00:00:57.805
and I act as the petroleum
systems analyst lead,

00:00:57.805 --> 00:01:00.822
overseeing a diverse portfolio
of exploration projects.

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:03.786
It never becomes boring,
it's never routine,

00:01:03.786 --> 00:01:06.899
and the interaction one has with
different technical disciplines

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:10.261
on a daily basis
is just unprecedented.

00:01:10.722 --> 00:01:14.087
Shell has been a leader in
exploration for more than 100 years,

00:01:14.087 --> 00:01:17.018
exploring the most frontier parts
of this planet,

00:01:17.018 --> 00:01:21.412
and it's very exciting to work
on these kinds of projects.

00:01:21.818 --> 00:01:25.421
When you work for exploration
you are always involved in

00:01:25.421 --> 00:01:27.114
really new groundbreaking projects.

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:31.661
Drilling, for example, here in the
central swamp is quite challenging.

00:01:31.661 --> 00:01:34.452
The thing about Nigeria in particular
is that we have

00:01:34.452 --> 00:01:36.699
a very diverse
operational environment here.

00:01:36.699 --> 00:01:38.943
You can work on a rig site,
like here,

00:01:38.943 --> 00:01:40.985
and be in the middle of the swamp,

00:01:40.985 --> 00:01:44.071
or you can work in the shallow
offshore or the deep offshore.

00:01:44.139 --> 00:01:48.421
You can also work on different
gas plants, which are land based,

00:01:48.421 --> 00:01:51.708
or on one of our oil terminals,
which are on the shoreline.

00:01:51.708 --> 00:01:55.670
What I like very much about Nigeria,
as well, is simply the weather.

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:57.346
It's always nice and warm here,

00:01:57.346 --> 00:02:00.258
better than being on a rig
on the North Sea!

00:02:01.761 --> 00:02:03.514
There's plenty to do
over the weekends.

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:05.620
Basically, you spend time
with your family,

00:02:05.627 --> 00:02:10.596
go for a walk, or you would go for
a bicycle run on the perimeter road,

00:02:10.596 --> 00:02:13.685
or you would go for a full session
with the kids.

00:02:14.182 --> 00:02:18.354
So plenty of activities on the camp;
mainly related to sports,

00:02:18.354 --> 00:02:22.587
but also other social events that
we have in the week.

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:28.812
The life at the residential area
in Port Harcourt is restricted

00:02:28.812 --> 00:02:33.007
and confined,
but it's a fantastic experience,

00:02:33.087 --> 00:02:35.554
and the experience you gain
is very valuable.

00:02:36.864 --> 00:02:39.579
The Shell school at the residential
area here in Port Harcourt

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:41.079
is really exceptional.

00:02:41.986 --> 00:02:43.843
My name is Dave,
I'm the head teacher

00:02:43.843 --> 00:02:47.443
at Rumukoroshe International
School here in Port Harcourt.

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:53.551
We have currently 71 students on roll
from 14 different nationalities.

00:02:53.995 --> 00:02:57.473
The classes are very small,
offering optimal student care.

00:02:57.564 --> 00:03:00.377
My three kids at the school
are very happy,

00:03:00.377 --> 00:03:02.055
and I'm also very happy
with the school.

00:03:04.007 --> 00:03:06.841
I very much enjoy working for
such a large group

00:03:06.841 --> 00:03:08.584
and in a multicultural environment.

00:03:09.124 --> 00:03:13.606
Our diversity really accommodates
different thoughts in problem solving

00:03:13.606 --> 00:03:17.718
and very often
these different thoughts result

00:03:17.718 --> 00:03:19.509
in unprecedented ideas.

00:03:19.536 --> 00:03:23.391
You learn something new every day
and you also have the possibility

00:03:23.391 --> 00:03:26.687
every day to give something back
to these people you work with.

00:03:27.286 --> 00:03:32.077
Every day we live and work with
basic, but lifesaving, rules.

00:03:32.176 --> 00:03:35.560
It's our Goal Zero;
'do no harm and no leaks'.

00:03:36.144 --> 00:03:39.945
HSSE is an integral part of
our business performance.

00:03:40.386 --> 00:03:44.994
Jeopardising HSSE means jeopardising
and gambling with people's lives.

00:03:45.552 --> 00:03:49.173
We don't gamble with people's lives
in Shell. Never.

00:03:51.018 --> 00:03:55.060
As they like to say in Nigeria,
"Wazobia" - "Come over here".

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:57.405
This is a unique opportunity
for you to witness

00:03:57.431 --> 00:04:00.461
one of the most exciting
petroleum systems in the world.

00:04:00.616 --> 00:04:04.292
For anybody working in exploration
and in Upstream in general,

00:04:04.292 --> 00:04:08.306
this is the best place to develop
and grow in your career.
