00:00:10.409 --> 00:00:12.345
TODAY WE'RE GOING TO
MAKE SOME PIZZA DOUGH.

00:00:12.445 --> 00:00:15.614
I'M GOING START WITH JUST
A SMALL BOWL HERE FOR THE BIGA,

00:00:15.714 --> 00:00:23.757
ADD THE WATER, BREAD FLOUR,
AND JUST A PINCH OF YEAST.

00:00:23.857 --> 00:00:25.424
AND WHEN I SAY A PINCH OF
YEAST, BASICALLY JUST TAKE

00:00:25.524 --> 00:00:30.463
A KNIFE -- JUST ABOUT THE KNIFE
TIP, AND SPRINKLE THAT IN.

00:00:30.563 --> 00:00:31.998
SO WITH THAT I'M JUST
GOING TO START WORKING IT

00:00:32.098 --> 00:00:34.801
IN WHILE IT'S IN THE BOWL. AND
I'M AT THE POINT NOW WHERE

00:00:34.901 --> 00:00:37.570
I HAVE A DOUGH. IT'S IMPORTANT
TO GET ALL THE FLOUR REHYDRATED

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:40.473
IN THIS PROCESS. I STILL HAVE
SOME DRY PARTICLES HERE.

00:00:40.573 --> 00:00:45.611
SO I'M REALLY GOING TO WORK THIS
PREFERMENT ON THE TABLE.

00:00:45.711 --> 00:00:47.881
NICE, SMOOTH DOUGH NOW.

00:00:49.949 --> 00:00:52.085
I TAKE A PLASTIC
CONTAINER, SPRAY IT.

00:00:55.621 --> 00:00:58.491
I'M JUST GOING TO ROUND
OUT THAT DOUGH, PLACE IT

00:00:58.591 --> 00:01:02.628
INTO THE CONTAINER, COAT
THE TOP WITH OIL AND

00:01:02.728 --> 00:01:04.430
THEN FLIP IT OVER.

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.199
CAP THAT OFF.

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:08.801
AND YOU'RE GOING TO SET IT IN A
FAIRLY COOL PLACE IN YOUR HOUSE.

00:01:08.902 --> 00:01:10.903
AND WE'RE GOING TO LET
THAT GO FOR 24 HOURS.

00:01:11.003 --> 00:01:13.439
SO NOW WE COME TO THE
ACTUAL DOUGH MIXING STAGE.

00:01:13.539 --> 00:01:18.978
I'M GOING TO START BY
ADDING THE WATER TO THE BIGA.

00:01:19.078 --> 00:01:20.880
AND SO THIS IS OUR FLAVOR
PROFILE FOR THIS DOUGH AND

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:23.749
IT'S REALLY GOING TO ADD
-- MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN

00:01:23.849 --> 00:01:25.551
THE FINAL PRODUCT.

00:01:25.651 --> 00:01:31.891
NEXT THING I'M GOING DO IS ADD
YEAST, BREAD FLOUR, AND SALT.

00:01:31.991 --> 00:01:33.492
WE'RE GOING TO PLACE THIS
ON THE MIXER AND MIX IT ON

00:01:33.592 --> 00:01:35.161
SPEED ONE FOR TEN MINUTES.

00:01:37.063 --> 00:01:39.165
OKAY. SO OUR DOUGH HAS
RESTED FOR 15 MINUTES.

00:01:39.265 --> 00:01:41.067
IT'S TIME TO
PORTION IT OUT NOW.

00:01:41.167 --> 00:01:43.102
I'M JUST GOING TO TAKE
THAT DOUGH AND BEGIN TO

00:01:43.202 --> 00:01:44.037
PULL IT TOWARDS ME.

00:01:46.372 --> 00:01:47.974
THAT'S GOING TO START TO
ROUND IT OUT, THEN I'M

00:01:48.074 --> 00:01:52.878
GOING TO CUT MY HANDS OVER THE
DOUGH AND JUST GIVE IT A TWIST.

00:01:52.979 --> 00:01:55.948
PLACE THIS INTO THE PAN
THAT I JUST SPRAYED.

00:01:56.749 --> 00:01:58.985
JUST LIKE WITH THE BIGA,
I'M GOING TO FLIP THIS OVER

00:01:59.085 --> 00:02:02.355
THE TOPSIDE FIRST AND
THEN BACK OVER. AND THAT'S GOING

00:02:02.455 --> 00:02:05.491
TO AGAIN PREVENT THIS DOUGH
FROM DRYING OUT.

00:02:05.591 --> 00:02:08.427
SO I'LL COVER THIS VERY
TIGHTLY WITH SARAN WRAP.

00:02:08.527 --> 00:02:10.830
THAT WILL GO INTO
YOUR REFRIGERATOR FOR

00:02:10.930 --> 00:02:12.865
APPROXIMATELY 24 HOURS.

00:02:12.965 --> 00:02:15.701
SO HERE IS OUR DOUGH THAT
HAS FERMENTED OVERNIGHT.

00:02:15.801 --> 00:02:18.371
AT HOME YOU WANT TO GET
YOUR OVEN AS HOT AS YOU CAN.

00:02:18.471 --> 00:02:20.373
IF YOU HAVE A BAKING STONE
AT HOME, A CERAMIC BAKING

00:02:20.473 --> 00:02:22.809
STONE, THAT IS IDEAL FOR
THIS, BECAUSE THAT WILL

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:24.610
GIVE YOU THE NICE CRUST.

00:02:24.711 --> 00:02:26.212
YOU'RE GOING TO START
BY DUSTING THE BENCH.

00:02:26.312 --> 00:02:28.681
PLACING THE DOUGH.

00:02:28.781 --> 00:02:32.152
COATING BOTH SIDES.

00:02:35.788 --> 00:02:37.857
AND START ROLLING IT OUT.

00:02:37.957 --> 00:02:40.993
AND I CAN JUST BEGIN TO START
STRETCHING IT WITH MY HANDS.

00:02:41.093 --> 00:02:43.162
SO MY HAND IS IN ALMOST
LIKE A CLAW SHAPE.

00:02:43.262 --> 00:02:45.231
I'M PUTTING THAT
UNDERNEATH THE PIZZA DOUGH.

00:02:45.331 --> 00:02:47.499
I'M MORE CONCENTRATED ON
THE OUTSIDE EDGE OF THE

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:51.203
DOUGH TO GET AN EVEN THICKNESS.

00:02:51.303 --> 00:02:54.040
SO YOU WANT TO BE CAREFUL
NOT TO TEAR HOLES IN THE CENTER.

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:55.642
PEOPLE HAVE A TENDENCY TO
WANT TO STRETCH FROM THE CENTER

00:02:55.742 --> 00:02:58.110
AND OUT. REMEMBER, IT'S THE
OUTSIDE EDGE IS WHERE

00:02:58.210 --> 00:02:59.779
YOU'RE GOING TO BE WORKING FROM.

00:02:59.879 --> 00:03:01.847
NOW, IT'S TIME TO GET
READY TO LOAD THESE IN THE OVEN.

00:03:01.947 --> 00:03:03.782
YOU'RE GOING TO DRESS THAT
BOARD AND PUT A LITTLE BIT

00:03:03.882 --> 00:03:06.452
OF CORN MEAL.

00:03:10.356 --> 00:03:14.861
LAY THAT PIZZA ON AND WE'LL
DO A TRADITIONAL PEPPERONI.

00:03:14.961 --> 00:03:16.662
EVERYBODY'S A FAN FAVORITE.

00:03:16.762 --> 00:03:18.097
AND WE'LL ALSO DO
SOMETHING A LITTLE OUT OF

00:03:18.198 --> 00:03:23.469
THE ORDINARY WITH SOME
PESTO AND FETA CHEESE.

00:03:34.881 --> 00:03:37.416
MAKE SURE THAT CHEESE GOES
PRETTY CLOSE TO THE EDGE.

00:03:37.516 --> 00:03:39.819
OUR OVEN IS NICE AND HOT,
AND I'M GOING TO GO AHEAD

00:03:39.919 --> 00:03:42.956
AND LOAD THIS ONTO THE STONE.

00:03:46.926 --> 00:03:48.660
THAT'S GOING TO TAKE
ANYWHERE FROM 7 TO 10

00:03:48.761 --> 00:03:50.796
MINUTES DEPENDING ON THE
TEMPERATURE OF YOUR OVEN

00:03:50.896 --> 00:03:52.632
TO BAKE, BUT WE WANT TO
MAKE SURE THAT WE GET A

00:03:52.732 --> 00:03:55.034
NICE CRISPY CRUST, A NICE
DARK COLOR TO THE CHEESE

00:03:55.134 --> 00:03:58.037
AND YOU'LL HAVE THAT
-- A GOOD END PRODUCT.

00:03:58.137 --> 00:04:01.073
HERE'S A SLIGHTLY
DIFFERENT VERSION FOR A

00:04:01.173 --> 00:04:05.978
TOPPING ON A PIZZA PLACE,
PLACE THE PIZZA SHELL ON.

00:04:06.078 --> 00:04:08.114
AND HERE I HAVE
SOME BASIL PESTO.

00:04:08.214 --> 00:04:09.949
YOU CAN EITHER
MAKE THIS YOURSELF.

00:04:10.049 --> 00:04:12.051
YOU CAN FIND A RECIPE
ONLINE OR YOU CAN DO LIKE

00:04:12.151 --> 00:04:15.554
I DO AND JUST BUY IT.

00:04:15.654 --> 00:04:22.995
YOU CAN PUT SOME PRESSURE
PLUM TOMATO ON THE EDGES.

00:04:23.095 --> 00:04:25.331
SO THIS IS A GOOD
VEGETARIAN ALTERNATIVE.

00:04:25.431 --> 00:04:30.970
YOU ADD SOME FETA CHEESE.

00:04:33.272 --> 00:04:34.974
AND WE'RE READY TO
GO INTO THE OVEN.

00:04:35.074 --> 00:04:38.377
YOU CAN NOTICE THAT WE HAVE A
NICE BUBBLY CRUST ON THE EDGES.

00:04:38.477 --> 00:04:41.980
IT'S THIN AND CRISPY AND
EVEN ON THE BOTTOM DUE TO

00:04:42.081 --> 00:04:44.550
THAT HOT HEAT OF CERAMIC STONE.

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:47.820
YOU HAVE A NICE
CRISPY PIZZA DOUGH.

00:04:47.920 --> 00:04:51.356
AND HERE WE HAVE OUR BASIL,
PESTO, FETA AND TOMATO PIZZA.

00:04:51.457 --> 00:04:53.860
CHEF'S MENU IS BROUGHT
TO YOU BY THE CULINARY

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:56.762
STUDIES PROGRAM AT ESTRELLA
MOUNTAIN COMMUNITY COLLEGE.
