00:00:28.955 --> 00:00:31.856
I admit,
I've been waiting for this for months.

00:00:32.159 --> 00:00:34.363
The new BMW 7 series.

00:00:35.390 --> 00:00:38.828
We're driving the biggest, longest,
widest and highest...

00:00:38.944 --> 00:00:40.550
...the 750Li.

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:42.776
The L means it's 5.9 inch...

00:00:43.025 --> 00:00:45.626
...that's about this much for most men...

00:00:45.845 --> 00:00:48.597
...longer, and 0.4 inch higher.

00:00:48.913 --> 00:00:51.323
So it's very spacious in the back.

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:56.307
The 50 in 750Li means...

00:00:56.596 --> 00:01:02.197
...it's got a V8.
Not a 5-liter one, but a 4.4 liter twin-turbo.

00:01:02.513 --> 00:01:06.010
407 hp, 600 Nm torque...

00:01:06.108 --> 00:01:08.689
...so it's powerful enough.

00:01:09.085 --> 00:01:11.599
This is another car that
only has turbo-engines.

00:01:11.708 --> 00:01:13.156
This one has two...

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:17.744
...there's also a 740i with
a 3-liter twin-turbo with 326 hp...

00:01:17.747 --> 00:01:21.710
...and there's a 730d,
a diesel with a turbo.

00:01:21.886 --> 00:01:22.683
Nice.

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:30.521
It's a big and heavy car of course...

00:01:30.624 --> 00:01:36.338
...but it's a BMW so you can
drive it sporty up until some point...

00:01:36.438 --> 00:01:38.203
...if you choose the right settings.

00:01:38.271 --> 00:01:41.758
Then it corners quite nicely.

00:01:42.511 --> 00:01:44.905
155 mph, 0-60 in 5.2 seconds.

00:01:45.034 --> 00:01:47.864
Effortless is the right word.

00:01:48.004 --> 00:01:50.553
This engine doesn't sound very inspiring...

00:01:50.665 --> 00:01:53.717
...but this is a 7 series, a luxury car.

00:01:53.821 --> 00:01:56.399
It's meant for the MP to sit back in.

00:01:56.475 --> 00:01:58.070
So it needs to be quiet.

00:02:00.881 --> 00:02:03.032
If you're fed up with cruising...

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:08.591
...you can tweak the car
using Dynamic Drive Control...

00:02:08.598 --> 00:02:11.539
...there's a comfort,
a normal, a sport...

00:02:11.746 --> 00:02:13.184
...and a sport+ setting.

00:02:13.467 --> 00:02:16.353
In the sport+ setting it even
switches the ESP off a bit.

00:02:16.517 --> 00:02:19.450
BMW's got that right...

00:02:19.507 --> 00:02:24.631
...in comfort it floats,
almost like an American...

00:02:24.723 --> 00:02:27.673
...and in sport it's firm and hard.

00:02:29.952 --> 00:02:31.342
It's BMW's top of the range model...

00:02:31.439 --> 00:02:32.952
...so it's packed with gadgets.

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:35.715
Also things even Ladas have nowadays...

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:39.541
...like Keyless Go and
rain and light sensors.

00:02:39.642 --> 00:02:42.357
Props for the light sensor, it's very quick.

00:02:42.466 --> 00:02:44.468
There's more fun stuff.

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:46.195
A new iDrive system.

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:48.559
The previous 7 series had just one button...

00:02:48.591 --> 00:02:53.710
...you could turn, pull, push sideways
and do everything with.

00:02:53.791 --> 00:02:56.517
Nowadays there are some
conventional buttons...

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:01.751
...like a tel button for the phone
and a nav button for the satnav.

00:03:01.762 --> 00:03:04.030
And there's an enormous screen...

00:03:04.176 --> 00:03:07.166
...1280x480 for the nerds among you.

00:03:07.209 --> 00:03:10.399
That's bigger than
the ones we write our blogs on...

00:03:10.491 --> 00:03:11.951
...so that's quite something.

00:03:14.601 --> 00:03:16.992
It also has Side View.

00:03:17.007 --> 00:03:23.022
That means you get two camera's,
one left and one right, in the front bumper.

00:03:23.045 --> 00:03:25.342
That comes in handy when
driving out of a narrow street.

00:03:25.422 --> 00:03:29.432
It costs just 570 euro
so why wouldn't you get it?

00:03:29.514 --> 00:03:32.117
You can also do a fun game with it.

00:03:32.625 --> 00:03:33.470
Fiat Panda!

00:03:35.852 --> 00:03:39.947
A Range Rover or a Land Rover?
-A Range Rover.

00:03:40.154 --> 00:03:44.935
Of course you shouldn't
look through the windows or mirrors.

00:03:46.138 --> 00:03:50.474
Audi TT! But is it an old or a new one?
I didn't see it.

00:03:51.465 --> 00:03:52.776
An Opel Corsa. 

00:03:54.659 --> 00:03:57.902
That's autobloggers favorite car,
I don't know why.

00:04:00.305 --> 00:04:03.436
As if that wasn't enough,
there's also a head-up display...

00:04:03.501 --> 00:04:05.701
...which shows you your current speed
and the maximum speed.

00:04:05.911 --> 00:04:09.906
Cos just like the Opel Insignia
this car can read road signs.

00:04:10.186 --> 00:04:11.322
Great.

00:04:11.991 --> 00:04:16.041
Another interesting option is
the ceramic details for some interior elements...

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:18.358
...like the buttons and the gear knob.

00:04:18.363 --> 00:04:21.397
It's ceramic, so it's baked material...

00:04:21.512 --> 00:04:24.338
...and it just looks like shiny plastic.

00:04:24.659 --> 00:04:29.984
And it's just a 745 euro premium,
so just take it, who cares?

00:04:34.306 --> 00:04:39.129
Before you all get your checkbook out
I'll say something about the price.

00:04:39.292 --> 00:04:41.714
The basic model is the 730d, a diesel...

00:04:41.792 --> 00:04:43.982
...it's 98.150 euro.

00:04:44.229 --> 00:04:47.990
There's also a 740i,
it's just a bit more expensive...

00:04:47.992 --> 00:04:50.747
...101 grand and a bit.

00:04:51.027 --> 00:04:53.676
And this 750 is 120 grand...

00:04:53.744 --> 00:04:56.545
...and if you want the longer one
it'll cost you a couple a grand more.

00:04:57.284 --> 00:04:58.762
All the gadgets I mentioned...

00:04:58.896 --> 00:05:04.155
...and more are on this list.
It's an A5 with options on both sides.

00:05:04.228 --> 00:05:08.516
All together they cost about
the same as a BMW 135i coupe.

00:05:08.953 --> 00:05:15.536
So the grand total on this press-demo is
a whopping 178.839 euro.

00:05:15.834 --> 00:05:19.416
That money will buy you
lots of other nice things...

00:05:19.515 --> 00:05:24.563
...like a BMW M3 which is more hardcore.

00:05:24.663 --> 00:05:29.376
But you can't sit in the rear that nicely,
so let's try that first.

00:05:33.285 --> 00:05:35.395
Hang on, I'll call you back in a moment.

00:05:36.792 --> 00:05:40.329
What are you doing?
I'm done.

00:05:40.421 --> 00:05:45.384
I'm just chilling out, calling a friend
and just sitting comfortably.

00:05:45.391 --> 00:05:49.434
Are you filming again?
You said you'd stop, Ruben.

00:05:49.474 --> 00:05:52.147
I just don't like it.
-You have to end the review.

00:05:52.193 --> 00:05:55.026
I'm just relaxing here, you can drive it home.

00:05:55.114 --> 00:05:57.744
I always have to do the hard work.

00:05:57.912 --> 00:06:00.974
That's not cool, really not cool.

00:06:04.063 --> 00:06:04.999
I'm going to sleep.
