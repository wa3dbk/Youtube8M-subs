00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:06.080
let's get right into it i have so many
stuff for so many different clips and

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.010
things to tell you about number one mitt
romney has gap again it's almost daily

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:13.800
at this point and we've got a couple of
different things to play for you know

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.450
first before we actually get into the
gaff

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:20.390
here's just a little bit of an
introduction this is joe scarborough

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:22.170
reacting

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:26.220
in horrified fashion to mit romney
trying to get the crowd to chant romney

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.810
ryan before he gaff

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:32.870
and this it will probably give you the
chills i urge you to sit down is really

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:33.910
really

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:38.820
uh... eight it's it's sad and its it
does not go take a look at this

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.760
but never meet anything because it's
very strict and i know

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:45.860
president obama had to dictate the
morning today's new york times is

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:49.540
reporting that he needs to make money
for the republican candidate in running

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:56.540
mainland depending keep are you hearing
at on

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:59.870
haha

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:06.780
but

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:13.780
probably ride promenade that

00:02:14.939 --> 00:02:16.109
well

00:02:16.109 --> 00:02:17.330
sweet jesus

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:19.650
clipper and

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:24.480
and session alright so that off to a bad
start you know your dad you're getting

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.540
up to a potential gaffe situation

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:30.109
when things just don't go well from day
one

00:02:30.109 --> 00:02:32.900
so then what is the gap today the gap is
this

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:36.719
that romney has been saying for months
that president obama has raised taxes

00:02:36.719 --> 00:02:38.189
and crime

00:02:38.189 --> 00:02:39.900
and as evidence of that

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:43.540
let me just play this quote for you
which of course is what mitt romney has

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:47.010
been saying for a really long time the
president's and saying i'm gonna raise

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:48.909
taxes in the middle class

00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:51.889
that's that's patently simply false

00:02:51.889 --> 00:02:53.729
by the way the president

00:02:53.729 --> 00:02:57.399
has now raise taxes on middle class has
so determined by the supreme court

00:02:57.399 --> 00:03:01.790
bright there you go okay so for a long
time he's been talking about this

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:04.649
and now what does he go out there and
say he says

00:03:04.649 --> 00:03:09.769
all bombing now is proposing to raise
taxes which he's never done before he

00:03:09.769 --> 00:03:11.099
hasn't done

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:13.209
during his first term which is it

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:14.809
he has raised taxes

00:03:14.809 --> 00:03:17.729
we have to raise taxes now if you're
watching this keep an eye on paul

00:03:17.729 --> 00:03:19.549
running in the background

00:03:19.549 --> 00:03:23.339
i've analyzed this video with an
electron microscope at the fourteen

00:03:23.339 --> 00:03:27.889
point two second mark paul ryan seems to
kind of uh... shake

00:03:27.889 --> 00:03:31.149
and look over to the side and say
something now uh... we don't know for

00:03:31.149 --> 00:03:34.199
sure if he was stunned at what mitt
romney was saying

00:03:34.199 --> 00:03:36.509
that it's a lot of it's a big
coincidence if it was completely

00:03:36.509 --> 00:03:40.359
unrelated maybe he was saying yeah
that's right romney's right on this

00:03:40.359 --> 00:03:43.789
watch paul ryan at the fourteen point
two second mark and listen to never

00:03:43.789 --> 00:03:47.269
uh... mit romney again contradict
himself directly saying obama hasn't

00:03:47.269 --> 00:03:48.629
raised taxes yet

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:53.139
but he's going to if you get reelected
take a look

00:03:53.139 --> 00:03:57.279
ears idea please don't want new idea

00:03:57.279 --> 00:04:01.319
that this is one thing he did not do it
is forced first four years he's

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:04.379
said he's going to do it the next four
years which is to raise taxes

00:04:04.379 --> 00:04:05.390
that is our anybody

00:04:05.390 --> 00:04:09.669
thinks that raising taxes will help grow
the economy

00:04:09.669 --> 00:04:11.339
uh... yes plan

00:04:11.339 --> 00:04:15.629
is to continue what he has done before
the status quo has not worked we cannot

00:04:15.629 --> 00:04:16.729
afford

00:04:16.729 --> 00:04:20.729
four more years of rock above award
bacteria got so mitt romney has been

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:23.680
saying for months that obon has raised
taxes

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:27.580
and then he comes out and says president
obama has not raise taxes yet but he's

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:28.610
going to

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:31.490
he is going to raise taxes and then of
course the campaign and to come out and

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:35.630
clarify saying president obama has
raised taxes on millions of middle class

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:37.629
americans during his first term

00:04:37.629 --> 00:04:38.750
governor romney

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:42.750
was clearly communicating about an
additional tax increase president of

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:44.939
bombing is proposing

00:04:44.939 --> 00:04:49.029
if everything you say has to be
clarified by the campaign you're doing

00:04:49.029 --> 00:04:51.650
something wrong are you

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:55.229
uh... the are acura lasting the campaign
did right

00:04:55.229 --> 00:04:56.330
sobrang even

00:04:56.330 --> 00:04:58.830
those says obama did raise taxes

00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:02.240
then he didn't raise and but really what
he meant was that he did and he's going

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:05.519
to raise an even more of that makes
sense that's on that make sense

00:05:05.519 --> 00:05:09.549
yeah and just this whole thing about
uh... the campaign having to explain

00:05:09.549 --> 00:05:12.879
their own candidates comments should be
the other way around the city that the

00:05:12.879 --> 00:05:16.059
the best person to explain the
campaign's position is the candidate

00:05:16.059 --> 00:05:20.620
himself it seems like to me the arising
capable of presenting the position is

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:25.060
that more i doing damage control the
hero his comments

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:25.789
unbelievable here
