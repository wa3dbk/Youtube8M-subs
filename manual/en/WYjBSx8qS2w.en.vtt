Vegan Vegetarian McDonalds McRib Sandwich Recipe

00:00:01.811 --> 00:00:05.944
Hey my Sweet V's, it's The Sweetest Vegan here. Today on 
 the show we will be veganizing McDonalds Mc Rib.

00:00:05.944 --> 00:00:10.495
Now this thing is a cult classic. People love it, but 
 I never really liked it because I had enough 

00:00:10.495 --> 00:00:19.040
riblet sandwiches at school to know that it was a processed pork 
 patty. And I would rather have a pulled pork sandwich 

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:27.167
which is like wholesome meat over a riblet sandwich. Either way people love 
 it, so we are going to veganize it today. Here we go

00:00:27.167 --> 00:00:32.717

00:00:32.717 --> 00:00:37.804
Now I have heard your cries, and I know that 
 everyone can not find these specialty faux meat 

00:00:32.717 --> 00:00:37.804
Now I have heard your cries, and I know that 
 everyone can not find these specialty faux meat 

00:00:37.804 --> 00:00:44.280
products at their local grocery stores or internationally, but this 
 was so perfect. I could not resist buying it.

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:51.966
It is the Gardein Southern BBQ riblet that was just perfect to 
 make the McDonalds McRib. It is just like a faux 

00:00:51.966 --> 00:01:01.928
vegetable pork patty. Just like McDonalds faux pork faux 
 patty. It is just as crazy looking.

00:01:01.928 --> 00:01:07.361
So, we are going to use that today. I'm going to use the 
 boiled directions since a lot of people also have a problem 

00:01:07.361 --> 00:01:13.375
with me using the microwave. And I can get that, because 
 this is a cooking show and we should cook somethings.

00:01:13.375 --> 00:01:18.065
We are going to place the packaged riblet packet in to boiling 
 water. It is kind of like the fancy sous vide

00:01:18.065 --> 00:01:27.075
that people are doing these days. But we are just going to boil it for 
 about 7 minutes and it should be all saucy and hot and 

00:01:27.075 --> 00:01:34.087
cooked through once the 7 minutes are up. Let it stand 
 for a minute before opening the package and place it

00:01:27.075 --> 00:01:34.087
cooked through once the 7 minutes are up. Let it stand 
 for a minute before opening the package and place it

00:01:34.087 --> 00:01:42.590
on to a hoagie roll. I found this bun in the bakery section of my 
 local grocery store. And I cut the ends off to make it look 

00:01:42.586 --> 00:01:49.160
more hoagie roll-ish. You can do the same thing. Now the time I made 
 it in the microwave, the sauce kind of dried up so 

00:01:49.157 --> 00:01:55.780
it is better that we boiled it anyway. But if your sauce did kind 
 of dry up, you can add extra barbecue sauce at this point.

00:01:55.775 --> 00:02:03.520
But I didn't need any because it was enough in the 
 packet. Add on plenty of onions, plenty of pickles, 

00:02:03.523 --> 00:02:08.760
and place your top on it. It took me less than ten minutes to 
 make this, less than a round trip to my local McDonalds 

00:02:08.755 --> 00:02:17.000
and we are about to taste it. So get excited, here we go. This 
 southern BBQ riblet sandwich is so good that is makes me 

00:02:16.998 --> 00:02:23.910
feel kind of guilty. Because it taste like pork and it king of taste 
 like ribs. Kind of like the McRib does. I guess that is the

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:33.670
point of it. It was nice and porky and chewy and soft. And 
 it didn't give off like a wheat gluten or tofu texture.

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:39.270
Like that mushy chew. It was kind of texturized and it 
 taste kind of like pork. With the barbecue sauce, 

00:02:39.266 --> 00:02:47.600
slathered on top, it was a little misleading to the tongue. 
 I would give this to people who liked the McRIb

00:02:47.602 --> 00:02:53.850
I would tell them to try this. The only critique I have 
 about the Gardein patty is that they could have made it

00:02:53.848 --> 00:02:59.610
a little bit wider. Come on. It s skinny. You can see it 
 is kind of skimpy. They could have made it twice 

00:02:59.606 --> 00:03:06.800
as wide. Three came in the package. I would have taken 
 two or even one if it was the correct proportion.

00:03:06.805 --> 00:03:13.380
Or maybe I am just an American and my portion size is 
 a little skewed. But overall it was a good experience. 

00:03:13.376 --> 00:03:20.850
If you are a vegan or vegetarian and you miss the McRib or 
 you miss pork or ribs or BBQ, this is for you.

00:03:20.853 --> 00:03:29.480
