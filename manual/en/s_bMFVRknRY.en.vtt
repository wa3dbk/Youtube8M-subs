00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.160
Hello there. A question that comes up on the Creator’s Corner forum occasionally is:

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:22.600
“I want to make a video, but I don’t know what to make a video about — can someone give me some ideas?”

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:29.560
That’s not an easy question to answer. But I’ll try and give you some general advice.

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:39.640
The first thing is to be yourself. You can’t be anyone else: you are who you are.

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:49.320
That means you shouldn’t try to be a very popular YouTuber just because you think doing what he does makes you popular.

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:52.800
Hey, it’s Fred...er...ick...!

00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:57.800
I mean, I’m not Fred, and if I tried to do Fred, I would suck at it.

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.080
There are people who say Fred sucks. But that’s a matter of opinion.

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:08.920
A good tip if you’re wondering how to give of yourself is to ponder the question:

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:19.080
What exactly do you want to tell the world? What is the one thing you want other people to know?

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:24.760
It could be, for example, that you live in an especially beautiful area of the world.

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:36.200
Although you might not be aware of this: What seems mundane and boring to you might be fascinating to somebody else.

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:43.680
Maybe your message to mankind is that having a balanced diet is very important.

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.200
Maybe I should stop eating deep-fried Mars bars.

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:52.880
Or it could be something as simple as: Why take life so seriously?

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.480
Have a bit of fun! Let your hair down! I mean, why not?

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:05.120
When it comes down to it, what are you personally really, really, really interested in?

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:08.280
That’s a start. There’s more to it than that.

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:20.560
Inspiration is everywhere. Everywhere you look, something has the potential to inspire you.

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:28.040
First thing is, get a life if you haven’t already got one, go out and do stuff. Then come back and tell us about it.

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:32.800
Keep your eyes and ears open at all times.

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.640
Maybe you’ve found an incredibly weird news story.

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:46.560
Oh my God, there’s a story here about a man who got his you-know-what stuck in a stainless steel pipe,

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:49.720
and the fire brigade had to cut him free.

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.640
Maybe you’ve overheard a conversation.

00:02:53.680 --> 00:03:01.520
I must say, Mr Giles, sir, that the potatoes we bought directly from your farm were very tasty:

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.680
much better than the supermarket variety.

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:06.480
All right, you enjoyed them, did you?

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:10.320
Oh yes. But there’s just one small thing.

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:12.440
Oh ar? And what’s that, then?

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:20.640
Well, they were rather muddy, and my wife had to wash them before we could actually cook them.

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:24.520
Or maybe you’ve read something that makes you really, really angry.

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:28.360
What? The government is going to spend my income tax on THAT?!

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:33.280
And if all else fails, there’s always other people’s YouTube videos.

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:40.360
No sir, you are completely mistaken. If I may correct you on one— Hang on...

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:45.480
Why am I writing a text comment? I could make a video response.

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:52.400
And never ever stop asking yourself questions, even if they seem really, really stupid.

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:56.840
Why do people think the world is going to end in 2012?

00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:59.360
What’s the point of Twitter?

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:03.640
Why isn’t World of Warcraft an Olympic discipline?

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:09.120
It might be a good idea to take a notebook wherever you go, and write down ideas as they occur to you.

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:16.080
Finally, you should always experiment.

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:23.440
It might take you a while to discover what you’re most comfortable with and what you can do best.

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:26.440
What kind of style, what kind of themes.

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:29.880
You can’t be good at everything, and different people are good at different things,

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:38.960
whether it’s satire, or tutorials, or investigative journalism, or art, music, whatever.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:47.360
But sometimes it might just take a little while to work out what kind of videos you’re really good at making.

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:51.800
Also, your first videos will automatically suck.

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:57.240
They will suck. My first videos sucked. I look at them now, and I cringe.

00:04:57.280 --> 00:04:59.640
But you shouldn’t let that worry you.

00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:07.440
It’s possible that the reason your video sucks is because you’re not good at that particular type of video,

00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:15.000
or it might be that you do have the talent to do what you’re doing, but you lack the technical know-how,

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:18.960
editing skills, experience, that kind of thing.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.760
But each sucky video is a learning experience.

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:29.880
You should watch it time and time again, until blood is seeping out of your ears,

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:36.520
and ask yourself: “Why does it suck, and how can I stop it sucking in future?”

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:46.080
One final point: Don’t rely on family and close friends to give you honest feedback.

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:50.920
They are your family and friends: it is their job to lie to you

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:58.080
and tell you that your videos are absolutely fantastic, when in fact probably they might suck.

00:05:58.120 --> 00:06:02.000
It’s difficult to get honest and constructive feedback,

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:08.520
but one way might be to set up a social network — maybe get a MySpace or Facebook page.

00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:14.520
Get a network of people who are not necessarily your very best friends,

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:20.320
but people whose judgements you can trust, and get their opinions.

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:28.000
But also, just watch your own video, and try to find as many mistakes in it as possible.

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:35.720
But don’t stop making videos. Even if you think the subject is really, really lame — make it anyway.

00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:39.760
So that’s it. Just remember these three points when looking for inspiration:

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:50.920
I almost forgot:

00:06:50.960 --> 00:07:00.480
a good way to get helpful feedback is to go to the YouTube Creator’s Corner and use the forum there.

00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:05.680
That’s also a good way to get more viewers and more subscribers.
