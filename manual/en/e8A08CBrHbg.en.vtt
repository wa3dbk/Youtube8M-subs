The Irish Glass Bottle Company, Ringsend

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:09.970
Not so long ago, at the beginning of the 1990s,
milk in glass bottles was still being brought

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:15.059
to your hall door by the milk man in some
parts of Dublin. These bottles were made by

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:20.720
the Irish Glass Bottle Company on South Bank
Road in Ringsend.

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:25.490
Bottles have been made in Ringsend for over
200 years. The first bottle company was set

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:32.270
up on Charlotte Quay in 1787. They sold most
of the bottles in France.

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:38.080
But a city which had many breweries, whiskey
distilleries and soft drinks factories also

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:42.680
needed lots of bottles so there were many
different bottle factories in Ringsend over

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:49.511
the years. Glass manufacturers needed lots
of sand, of which Ringsend had plenty. They

00:00:49.511 --> 00:00:56.160
also needed lots of coal to melt the sand
so it was handy to be near the port. Unfortunately,

00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:01.309
as a result, Ringsend became very polluted
from all that smoke!

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:06.979
The Irish Glass Bottle Company started in
Ringsend in 1871, making black bottles for

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:13.479
porter with sand from Dublin Bay and lime
and clay from Clontarf. These was mixed with

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:19.819
salt rock and soda and melted in a huge tank
furnace.

00:01:19.819 --> 00:01:25.479
Making bottles was very hard work. People
called blowers shaped the liquid red-hot glass

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:30.079
that came out of the furnace into bottles.
It was a bit like blowing bubbles with chewing

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:35.749
gum. Then the bottles were left to cool for
two nights and two days.

00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:43.939
In 1880 the Irish Glass Bottle Company made
600 gross of bottles every week; a gross is

00:01:43.939 --> 00:01:53.130
an old measurement of 144, so they made 86,400
bottles per week!

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:58.600
Bottles were used and re-used many times,
which was a good way to recycle. Milk bottles

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:04.479
made fifty trips, and beer bottles made thirty!
Children could get money from a grocery shop

00:02:04.479 --> 00:02:10.030
for returning empty lemonade bottles. It was
a great way of getting a bit of pocket money

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:16.469
and one could buy a wafer which was an ice
cream slice between wafers.

00:02:16.469 --> 00:02:21.670
The Irish Glass Bottle Company got bigger,
moved factory twice, made bottles in different

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:26.980
colours and shapes and in the 1980s was one
of the most modern factories in Europe. It

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:32.620
employed a great number of people. However,
in 2002 it closed its doors forever and this

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:35.540
marked the end of glass bottle making in Ringsend.
