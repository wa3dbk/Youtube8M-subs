00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:03.889
If we are to understand Ecumenical Sunday

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:06.950
I guess we should start with the word
ecumenical... or

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:08.130
ecumenism.

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:10.670
It comes from the Greek word, "oikoumenÄ“" 

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:13.780
meaning whole inhabited world, right.

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:17.949
Keeping in mind in greek this
historically refers to the Roman Empire.

00:00:17.949 --> 00:00:21.599
So it relates to both the whole inhabited earth

00:00:21.599 --> 00:00:25.579
and Christian unity, despite

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:29.149
different denominations or being
separated by different theologies,

00:00:29.149 --> 00:00:32.850
to come together as one single

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.680
Christian church. And so Christians
around the world

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.899
celebrate that idea on Ecumenical Sunday.

00:00:39.899 --> 00:00:44.219
Wait, it sounds like we're doing an episode of...,

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.600
wait for it, with for it-- oh, you already...

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.420
you got it, you already said it didn't you?Right, yep, we are talking about Ecumenical Sunday

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:56.600
on this episode of Chuck Knows Church. 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:00.860
[Intro music begins]

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:14.700
Ecumenical or ecumenism,

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:18.400
it does not refer to non-denominational Christianity

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:23.350
or interfaith dialogue or intergalactic parliamentary negotiations.

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:27.620
The first to speak more to unity among
different religions around the world, the

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:28.890
third of course speaks to

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:35.000
greater peace in the galaxy, right? Religious unity or common spirituality,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.910
peace in space, these are not ecumenism.

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:42.540
Specifically in Christianity the
term ecumenical

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.910
originally refers to things like the
ecumenical council

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:51.510
meaning "the larger church." It was not
used historically for example to reunite

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:54.470
Christian denominations that had a
broken off on their own.

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:57.750
Now, one school of thought saw the ecumenical movement

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.869
growing out of the Roman Catholic Church
in their attempt to

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:04.540
reconcile with Christians who had
different theological point of view.

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:08.290
Some think the 1910 world missionary
conference

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:12.970
was the starting point. And then in 1948 there was the first meeting of

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:14.640
 the World Council of Churches,

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:19.470
unifying the church globally was most
important on the agenda.

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.630
And when this started to happen they
understand their differences.

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:25.489
How about that?

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:30.639
Christians can actually come together, a
unified body for change in the world.

00:02:30.639 --> 00:02:38.539
Ooo and maybe someday even the Galaxy.  We are agents have peace and hope

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:42.099
after all, right? The ecumenical movement

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:45.489
not only forced to nominations to form councils, ugh,

00:02:45.489 --> 00:02:50.659
more committees, right?  But now today
internationally even, the World Council of Churches

00:02:50.659 --> 00:02:54.459
shares that legacy of the one ecumenical
movement

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:57.039
and the responsibility to keep it alive.

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:02.180
So, at least once a year Christians are
reminded of how Jesus wanted his disciples

00:03:02.189 --> 00:03:03.780
to be one.

00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:08.660
Like he said in John chapter 17 "So that
the world may believe." 

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:13.380
We unite as one Christian body

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:17.220
not just locally, but with congregations all around the world

00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:22.380
for special ecuminical services to
celebrate our unity in Christ. 

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:26.260
If you'd like to learn more be sure to ask your pastor. 

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:28.180
Tell them Chuck sent you.

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:30.620
You knew I was going to say that, didn't you?

00:03:30.620 --> 00:03:32.780
But you're already saying it your head
