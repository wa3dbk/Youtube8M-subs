Hi, everyone.

00:00:01.959 --> 00:00:07.880
In this video, I'll be showing you how to
create this fancy, twisted bun updo.

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:13.080
It's really classy, and it works great for
people who have thin or layered hair, as we

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.910
will be using a Velcro roller for the base
of the bun.

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:22.070
One important thing to note is that the diameter
of the Velcro roller has to be wider than

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:26.240
the thickest point of your hair when it's
pulled into a ponytail.

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:33.290
Before I even begin, I'm going to add a little
extra volume and natural looking bounce by

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:38.940
spraying my hair right at the roots with the
Dove Oxygen Moisture Root Lift Spray.

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:45.110
Now, to begin, I'm going to pull all of my
hair up into a high ponytail and secure it

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:46.320
with an elastic.

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.770
I'm then going to pull the entire ponytail
all the way through my Velcro roller, and

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:55.620
sit the roller right at the base of the ponytail.

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:01.310
This hairstyle works best with very smooth
and sleek hair, so I'll be applying a dime-sized

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:06.000
amount of the Dove Pure Care Dry Oil onto
my hair.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.170
This absorbs really quickly into my hair and
leaves it looking super shiny and healthy.

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:16.750
Taking one to two-inch sections at a time,
you want to twist and wrap them around the

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:19.570
outside of the Velcro roller.

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:24.729
This is where this technique really stands
out because the Velcro roller serves to create

00:01:24.729 --> 00:01:35.360
the illusion of having thicker hair while
also helping to lock down any loose ends.

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:46.290
Build this up layer by layer until you're
happy with the shape of the bun that you've

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:47.290
created.

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:52.540
Use a couple of bobby pins just for extra
security, and to lock down any flyaways or

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:54.780
any loose ends.

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:59.750
Once you're happy with the look, simply spray
the entire hairstyle with the Nexxus Maximum

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:02.690
Super Hold Styling and Finishing Mist.

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:07.880
This will help hold the bun in place and prevent
any annoying flyaways without flaking, dulling,

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.849
or causing a build up.

00:02:09.849 --> 00:02:11.750
Here again is the final look.

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:16.270
I hope you enjoy this video, and I'd love
to see your pictures if you do try it out.

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:17.700
Thank you so much for watching.

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:19.280
I'll see you my next video.

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:19.920
Bye, guys.
