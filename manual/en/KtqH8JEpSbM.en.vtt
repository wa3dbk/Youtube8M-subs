00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:08.700
Got a nice assortment of the summer games.

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:11.560
This is classic, this- this one's classic. This thing.

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:14.060
And there's the thing where the guy lands on the number one.

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:16.100
The fucking head-stand competition.

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:17.240
Pants-off, dance-off.

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.920
This dude has a giant fucking shlong with a big fat head on the end of it.

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:22.420
Mark Nutt~!

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:26.200
Some fucking weight lifting, doing some fucking poops. (Gavin in background) Mark Nutt~!

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:27.000
I just did that.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:27.500
Jerk.

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:28.120
Jerk!

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:29.920
JERK. JERK! JERK IT!

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.200
Aw fuck. I didn't jerk hard enough.

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:35.500
Can he hold it like th- Why can't he fucking hold the weight end. Asshole.

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:37.360
'Kay. Oh no no no no no. No.

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.580
Catch the fucking- goddamnit.

00:00:39.580 --> 00:00:40.500
Oh, did he get it?

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.800
Ooohh fuck. No! NO!

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.100
Aw come on! I can move the guy too?!

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:46.740
Can I pick him up? Just put him over here.

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:48.960
Get out of your pink spandex suit, shithead.

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:51.500
What if I just do this, just like- Ohh shit!

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.660
Whoa dude... can that happen?

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:58.460
When you pick up the weight, slam it against the fucking ceiling to straighten it out. That's how the pros do it.

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:59.780
Look at his biceps!

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:04.100
Look at that. That- this guy can fucking lift. This guy can definitely lift.

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:07.540
Racewalking. This is different from racing, and walking.

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:09.660
He's got a gun! HE'S GOT A GUN!

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:10.980
Oh Jesus Christ.

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:13.240
Is there anything else? I just pull the guy?

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:15.180
Ooh shit.

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:18.580
That'll happen. That'll happen on a fucking hill.

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:21.140
Are you serious!?

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:22.780
Are you fucking serious!?

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:23.940
God damnit.

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:25.520
There we go.

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.880
Now he's moving. Now- how did I get it right the first fucking time?

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:31.940
How did I get him ALL the way across the fucking thing the first time?

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:34.600
And now I can't move this fucking shmuck off the starting line.

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:35.840
Fuck! Fuck.

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:39.080
Fuck. Stop. Stop. There we go, it started.

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:41.420
Oh my god. Oh my god! No.

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.500
Don't. I'm gonna bump into him! He's gonna fucking SHOOT YOU!

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:47.420
Oh shit! Ooh, I knocked him over. Oh my god.

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:48.880
Oh my god, get the fuck out of there.

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:51.680
Cheese it! God- ahh he's pointing it right at me!

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:53.720
Dude, these arrows are fucking BIG.

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:58.080
Do you think, like, this tiny guy would be shooting an arrow that's like twelve times the size of his fucking body?

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:01.480
I wonder if you can just like put it in the board, like just- no- ah-

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:02.960
Fucking I guess that answers that question.

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:04.240
This is how Mark Nutt does it.

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:06.000
This is how he's such a fucking amazing shot.

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.720
Just walks up to the board and fucking sticks the arrow into it.

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.020
Do some rowing. Let's fucking get out there and row.

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:13.100
Oh fucking shit no.

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:14.120
Alright. Lost that guy.

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:15.940
What in the fuck is he wearing?

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.380
What is this? What is this on your head? And why is there a basketball in the water?

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:22.760
Okay, so I have to go backwards just to keep him on the stupid fucking rowboat.

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:24.380
He hit the fucking rocks.

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:27.320
HE'S STILL GOING! What're you doing!?

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:30.760
Oh my god! He fucking Free Willy'd that barge.

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.780
There was a little kid standing on top of it as he fucking flew over his head!

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:35.780
This is it, this is how all the pros do it.

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.560
On their backs with their legs up in the air just fucking rowing.

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:43.780
Why can't I- can I just fly the boat? Hang on, can I just like pick the whole fucking thing up and fly it to the end.

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.680
Oh it's not gonna fucking end well for this guy.

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.080
Dude, I'm a fucking master rower, check it out!

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.860
Why wouldn't you just do this, just fucking flying through the air on their hover rowboat.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.620
Look at that. Look at those flips. Oh wait.

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:56.340
That's going to be bad. Ooh...

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:57.060
Shit.

00:02:57.060 --> 00:02:57.940
I broke my spine.

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:03.080
I like how the made all the judges different colors to show that, you know, this is the real Olympics and this is the real deal.

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:06.720
We have the purple judge, the white judge, the yellow judge, the pink one...

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:09.240
And then of course like the fucking green one. Can't forget that guy.

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:11.040
Oh I can still hold the dude in air.

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.780
Oh there we go, now he's diving.

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:15.620
Pretty sure you're not suppose to land feet first fuck-face.

00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:18.440
Spin around. Spin the fuck around! Idiot!

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:19.360
He's just flying.

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:22.500
And then that counts?! That counted.

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:26.680
You would think it would be easy to just fucking fall in... it's not.

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:29.640
He keeps trying to do fucking front flips for style.

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:31.500
Ayy there we go. No? WHAT!

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.320
Ohh my god. Textbook!

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:34.900
How did that not count!?

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:38.560
HOW IS THAT A ONE!?

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:41.880
ARE YOU KIDDING ME!? THAT WAS FUCKING PERFECT!
