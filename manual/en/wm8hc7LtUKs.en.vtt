00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:54.600
Very good day, gamers! I'm here today to talk about a game based on 
one of Disney's greatest stories...

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
This is the story of Aladdin

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:03.600
The young thief that lives some magic adventures
alongside his monkey Abu, his genie and the princess Jasmine

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.000
This game was released in 1993 created by Capcom, YEAH!

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:15.000
The great company that created some of the greatest series 
of games of all time and that really knows how to make games...

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:17.600
Unlike others...

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Anyway, as expected this game had a great reception,
and a lot of kids loved it as much as the movie itself

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.600
So, without any delays, let's start with the details!

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.750
Well, since this is my first episode, i gotta include each 
possible aspect to check and, about the story, there's no much to say...

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.100
I can only tell that the story is marvelous, obviously
with magic travels, Magic Battles!

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.000
EVERYTHING IS MAGICAL IN THIS GAME!!!

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.300
I wouldn't be surprised that Aladdin means Magic in some other language

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.500
Everything starts with Jaffar taking some dude that nobody cares about
to the Cave of Wonders

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:53.300
There the Cave says that It'll only accept the right chosen and... well...

00:01:53.600 --> 00:02:00.000
It eats him, then Jaffar decides to look for the right chosen 
and for some reason he thinks that Aladdin is the one

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:08.600
"Hey, who'd be better that some regular thief with a spider monkey
that jumps around beating up guards and trowing apples at everything 
in his way, pretty sure the cave will accept!"

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:16.700
Anyway, when the game starts Aladdin goes around town, well... going as he
pleases, taking gems that people leaves all over the place, floating and...

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.800
well, jumping on people's head, nothing out of this world!

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:24.150
In the end he rescues Jasmine of some stalker (or something) 
and together escape to Aladdin's house

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.660
Oh yeah, thing are going cool dude!

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:33.000
But then Aladdin is captured and taken to the deepest dungeon of the prison,
but then Jaffar comes and magically disguised as some old man

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:39.000
and tells him that he'll freed him if he brings a "treasure" from some place,
Aladdin accepts (the challenge) and is taken to the Cave of Wonders!

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.660
And magically the cave accepts him... 
Hmmm who'd tell...

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:47.800
Maybe thiefs that throw apples at people ARE worthy of recieve treasures

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:54.800
At the end of a long trip Aladdin finds a magic carpet that doesn't speak
but understand people... Ok?

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:01.850
And the Lamp, after escaping from the death 'cause of the Cave's crumble
he delivers the lamp to Jaffar but he locks them inside the Cave

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:08.800
With the lamp that Abu stole from him, Aladdin rubs it and BAM!
the genie shows up and takes Aladdin into the lamp...

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:14.350
And they fly to Agrabah but Abu fells into some old Piramid
and Aladdin goes to rescue him

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:19.660
When they finally leave, Aladdin comes back to Agrabah turned into a prince
and fly with Jasmine on the magic carpet

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:25.000
But in the end is captured by Jaffar and Iago steals the magic Lamp,
Jaffar sends Aladdin to the corners of the world

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.500
But he's rescued by Abu and his magic carpet and comes back
to Agrabah to save everybody

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.000
And after a fierce battle Jaffar turns into a genie and
is locked inside his lamp, everything comes back to normal

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:37.400
the genie is freed and everyone lives happily ever after...

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.200
Until Jaffar is freed once again but that's another movie...

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.500
To sumarize, a great story...

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:45.660
Magical Story!

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:55.400
The game consists in 7 levels, 6 levels divided in 2 or 3 stages,
1 final level, and a bonus level

00:03:55.850 --> 00:04:00.500
The levels in this game are very colorful and very detailed
in the road and the background

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:09.000
In some levels you can take different roads to get to the end, but that's 
preference of the player and this inspires to play the same level over and over

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:13.660
Capcom did a great job recreating these beatiful images 
in a 16-bit cartridge

00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:18.400
There're also levels that weren't from the original story such as
the old piramid where Abu falls

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:23.400
And well, they expanded the level from inside the lamp,
and wow, I really love that level!

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:31.000
The bonus level where Aladdin and Jasmine fly on the carpet
is amazing, some people think is beautiful, but I think is funny

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:34.550
You may gently ask "WHY THE F*CK!?"
Well...

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:40.000
If you pay attention the objective of the level is not just fly around,
is to collect as much gems as you can, I mean...

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:46.500
Jasmine is all like: "Oh, Prince Ali, what a wonderful view"
While Aladdin is all like: "Shut up, b*tch! you don't let me concentrate!"

00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:50.100
Aladdin only uses one weapon, as I said, the apples

00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:55.000
When you fell on a Jar it can give you up to 3 apples 
where each one equals ten

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:56.600
One equals Ten?
OK!

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:58.630
And where does he keep so many, who knows?

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:03.610
You can also get bread that restores a heart,
and some roasted chicken that restores all of your health

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.700
But who the f*ck puts a roasted chicken inside a jar, uh?

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:15.420
Oh, and the music, what can I say, the music is awesome
and is good for each level, and it puts you in the situation like a typhoon of...

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:16.400
Candy!

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:26.300
and the sound efects are... good, but that's not saying much, most of the time 
the same S.E. are used for different situations wich ruins the situation a little

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:30.000
now the typhoon has run out of candy and
all there's left is the scratch on the bottom

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:39.100
A problem that this game has is that it's very limited with the bosses
if we count them, there's the first level boss... eh... hmmm... gehhh...

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:40.680
No, Abu doesn't count

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:46.100
And the two forms of Jaffar, there, 3... 3 Bosses in total, that's it!

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:49.400
Wich is kinda sad considering that it was made by CAPCOM!

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.400
I mean, c'mon, this company is made for sidescrollers with a lot of bosses

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:57.000
Oh well, this is a movie based game, so I don't blame them...

00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:02.100
There's also the password option that consits on 4 boxes with the faces
of the characters of the story

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:07.800
When you match all 4, it'll take to the level you want to go...
and if you miss, you go back to the main menu...

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:16.400
Oh, BTW, you know that every good game has a good title screen,
well, every great game has TWO title screens, YAY!

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:20.300
Well... is not as good as the other one, but is still entertaining!

00:06:20.830 --> 00:06:27.500
During the game you'll find some red gems that, in most of the cases,
are harder to get, like this one...

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.860
In total there're 70 of them, and depending on how many you find
will be the ending you get

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:40.000
If you find from 0 to 49, you'll the simple ending with Aladdin and Jasmine
flying on the magic carpet (Like in the movie!)

00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:45.500
And if you get from 50 to 70 you get, let's say, the better ending
with images from the past levels

00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:51.000
and when you get all 70 gems, Capcom recognizes you as a
"Super Player"!

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.000
Yeah... what? WHAT!? ARE YOU KIDDING ME!?

00:06:56.500 --> 00:07:03.000
You'll also find some treasure chest that give you extra lives, heart containers
food and golden bugs

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:13.100
When you get this ones, they'll give you the chance, at the end of the level
in Break Time to get a price, may be extra lives, or extra credits, 
refill your hearts

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:18.100
or an extra heart, but this one is difficult to get, so it's better for
you to go for the extra lives

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:20.700
And... let's see what've we got...

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:29.600
Uh, Wow! ummm, well that was a lucky hit
I don't think it'll ever happen again

00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:38.400
Anyway, now that we talk about the gems, when you get 100
you receive an extra heart, or an extra live when you have all the hearts

00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:43.400
Man, this game is really generous about that,
unlike other games...

00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:55.000
