00:00:07.019 --> 00:00:09.930
Hello Kickstarter, this is Don Geyer,
creative producer here at

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:11.700
ThreeGates studios

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.849
Our current project, Legends of Aethereus was

00:00:13.849 --> 00:00:16.189
made with one goal in mind;

00:00:16.189 --> 00:00:17.170
to create awesome gameplay

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:21.210
for the hardcore PC-gamer.

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:21.210
So we identified

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:25.379
four key areas that we wanted to focus on to
create a rich and meaningful gaming

00:00:25.379 --> 00:00:28.319
experience:

00:00:28.319 --> 00:00:31.460
character variation and freedom
is something we wanted to emphasize

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:34.900
so we built intricate character
attributes and skill systems that allow

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:39.190
for a variety of character strategies

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.190
The Legends of Aethereus

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:41.680
combat system is physics based

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:44.850
and player controlled.

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:48.600
Weapon and gear customization are a key
to allowing players the freedom to develop

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.499
their own gaming strategies.

00:00:50.499 --> 00:00:53.660
So we developed an expansive crafting and
material system

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:58.540
focused on the players designing their
own weapons and gear

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:02.800
With a variety of traps, hindrances, and
other objects that can be manipulated

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:09.770
you can always use the environment to your
advantage to out-fox your enemies.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.770
Legends of Aethereus is a

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:12.070
high-action, low fantasy RPG

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:13.820
with four player co-op

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:18.520
and a variety of pvp game types.

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:20.880
There are three character classes to choose from

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.190
inventor,

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:25.830
astrographer, and officer.

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.510
The character creator allows you to
create your own unique player characters

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:36.510
with a variety of physical and visual
options.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.070
You enter the game as a newly-recruited agent

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:43.440
in the Nexus City-state guard.

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:46.630
The Nexus city-state is your base of
operations and

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:50.130
each player will be able to customize their
own city using banner makers, visual

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:54.380
options, as well as creating personalized
statues using

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.040
the statue maker game feature.

00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:00.620
The extensive crafting system allows you
to design customized gear with a variety

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:03.650
of components and materials.

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:09.729
This allows for virtually unlimited amount of
strategic options to be explored.

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:13.950
Quests and expeditions can be acquired
from a variety of npc characters within

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:17.180
the Nexus.

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:20.989
Alana, Captain of the City Guard is your
mentoring contact for the main quest

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:24.749
line. The plot line revolves around
seeking out seven ancient relics of

00:02:24.749 --> 00:02:31.489
great power and maintaining political
control over the Nexus.

00:02:31.489 --> 00:02:33.240
As well as embarking on quests

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:40.240
you will also be engaging in a variety
of game types in the city Arena.

00:02:39.379 --> 00:02:40.379
These include

00:02:40.379 --> 00:02:41.479
PVP, Co-op and

00:02:41.479 --> 00:02:43.899
single-player gametypes such as

00:02:43.899 --> 00:02:46.159
King of the hill, deathmatch and last stand

00:02:46.159 --> 00:02:50.480
just to name a few.

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:53.679
One of the features that makes Legends of Aethereus
different from other games

00:02:53.679 --> 00:02:56.669
is our physics-based combat system.

00:02:56.669 --> 00:03:00.599
Combat is based on player control not
auto-targeting; you will aim

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:03.189
your own crossbow, swing your own sword
and

00:03:03.189 --> 00:03:07.519
throw your own bombs. During melee combat you will
control the action - it's not 

00:03:07.519 --> 00:03:11.169
just mouse smashing and auto aim.

00:03:11.169 --> 00:03:14.379
You will control where you swing with
your weapon and if you score hit it will

00:03:14.379 --> 00:03:17.549
be determined by if you actually hit
something. Not only that,

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:20.929
the weapon weight and momentum will
determine the force and define the amount

00:03:20.929 --> 00:03:24.659
of knockback and damage of a hit.

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:25.510
This demonstration

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:28.630
shows how the arc of the melee attack
works, and shows when a hit will be

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:30.179
registered

00:03:30.179 --> 00:03:34.039
all the systems in Legends of Aethereus
assume the players not only capable but

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:41.039
also wants to control the action.

00:03:43.689 --> 00:03:48.119
ThreeGates studios is a group of industry
veterans of a wide background.

00:03:48.119 --> 00:03:55.119
We are located on the Swedish island of
Gotland in the world heritage city of Visby.

00:03:55.229 --> 00:04:00.029
Our studios is within the medieval city
walls located in an old tavern that

00:04:00.029 --> 00:04:01.769
was built in the thirteenth century.

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:04.709
we thought this would be an
inspirational location to make an action

00:04:04.709 --> 00:04:06.479
RPG-game.

00:04:06.479 --> 00:04:10.019
We started the Legends of Aethereus
project because we felt that the core PC

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:15.649
gamer has been forgotten. We wanted to
make a game focused on these core gamers.

00:04:15.649 --> 00:04:19.840
Over twenty people have dedicated more than
a year of their lives to this project

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:22.650
We've been working through the long cold
Swedish winner

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:25.179
but finally spring has come.

00:04:25.179 --> 00:04:26.909
We recently held a closed beta

00:04:26.909 --> 00:04:32.270
and are in the process of putting the
final polish on this game

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:35.540
so if you're a core gamer out there that is
looking for a rich gaming experience

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:38.979
full of interesting strategic options

00:04:38.979 --> 00:04:41.319
and individual customization possibilities

00:04:41.319 --> 00:04:44.969
Legends of Aetherus might be for you!

00:04:44.969 --> 00:04:51.969
Thank you for your time,
We really appreciate your support

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:01.139
Hey! You can come out now.

00:05:01.139 --> 00:05:08.139
The camera's gone.
