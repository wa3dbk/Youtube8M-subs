00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:09.040
Okay, good day

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:10.570
How's it going?

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:17.100
I'm Bobby crispy from Toronto Canada and this guitar lesson is about how to play day tripper by the beatles

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:21.720
the Song Can be Broken down into five main riffs

00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:26.130
I'll play each riff [then] I'll show how it's played

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:32.520
So riff number one is the opener and it's played like this

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:48.720
So you start on the top string open and again?

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.179
Third fret top string

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:58.960
slide to the fourth fret

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:03.860
into the 5th string 2nd fret

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:11.369
fourth string second fret still barred with the first finger

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:15.870
fourth string open

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:20.670
fifth string second fret

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.470
fourth string fourth fret

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.740
here

00:01:28.399 --> 00:01:30.399
actually

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.700
fifth string second fret

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:36.680
fourth string open

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:44.400
fourth string second fret once again first page slowly

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.280
rift number two is

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:00.249
Exactly the same as roof number one

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:08.529
But it's played one string down. So you just move to everything one string down so start on the fifth string and

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:11.170
Just play like this

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:23.700
So just exactly as the top riff first riff, so I'll play again slowly

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:44.849
[rift] number three is the [Chorus] and split like this

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:06.799
Okay, first chord is an F7 chord. The same as an f-Sharp

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:15.919
Lift your [pinkie] to [get] the seventh, and it's just all downstrokes on the [eighth] like that

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:22.789
1 2 [1] 2 2 1 g try to get it at the back like that

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:31.279
They try to play the top three strings, so it's f sharp

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:37.670
7

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:40.450
They're Musa

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:46.899
[to] an a chord same strumming pattern that's at the fifth, right?

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:54.628
Go down one fret g sharp major

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:09.090
Then it's C sharp which is at the fourth fret position like that haidee

00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:14.019
Fourth string 6 fret

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:22.089
Just [afterward] string 6 fret and the second string 6 fret like that

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:28.269
Or like that whatever is more comfortable for you

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:35.759
That's a struggle pattern one

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:41.030
Wants you one?

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:48.380
Then two frets down to the second fret same position

00:04:49.979 --> 00:04:51.979
That's same pattern as well

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:55.890
one

00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:57.890
one

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:00.170
wants you

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.029
Okay, that's the chorus

00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:09.510
riff number four

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:12.709
