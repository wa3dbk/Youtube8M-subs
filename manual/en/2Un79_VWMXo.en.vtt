Hi I'm Jessica Smith and I work for Blands
Nursery in West Jordan Utah, and today we're

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:10.390
talking all about bulbs. Now we're going to
discuss how to grow and care for giant Elephant

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:18.280
Ears. Now these tropical guys don't grow here
as a perennial, but you can actually grow

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:24.380
them here as an annual in a shady location,
and then just lift the bulb like you would

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:32.040
your dahlias or your cannas each fall. Now
the giant Elephant Ear gets it's name from

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:39.100
the leaf itself. This leaf grows and looks
just like a huge elephant ear, they can get

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:45.920
six-ten feet in diameter. They grow usually
down around like Florida in your tropical

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:52.079
areas, and even in some countries they actually
eat the root. Make sure you don't touch the

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:56.579
leaves or the stalks to your lips or anything,
they are actually poisonous, and can burn

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:02.420
your lips and cause your tongue and your lips
to actually swell. Now the giant Elephant

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:09.600
Ear is going to add interest and accent to
a shady location. Some of the leaves aren't

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:16.529
always green, they actually can be in reds
or blacks. But it is grown for the leaf itself.

00:01:16.529 --> 00:01:24.859
In a warm climate, down around the south and
that, actually they can be quite invasive

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:30.349
and can overtake an area. But here where we're
cold it won't make it through our freezing

00:01:30.349 --> 00:01:35.009
grounds in the winter time, so you do need
to lift the bulb. Basically you're going to

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:39.929
lift it just like you would any other type
of a bulb, wait until the tops frost down

00:01:39.929 --> 00:01:45.549
a little bit. After that first light frost
you call it a killing frost, but you want

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:54.039
to lift that bulb before the ground actually
freezes. Just go ahead and store it like a

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:58.829
dahlia tuber and that, let the soil kind of
dry off for a day or two, remove the soil,

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:04.631
any dry roots lightly. And then just put it
in some peat moss or vermiculite for the winter

00:02:04.631 --> 00:02:09.840
months. Store it in a box or a perforated
plastic bag, make sure there's some air flow,

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:15.110
check it periodically throughout the winter.
If it feels a little bit dry, if your peat

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:19.569
moss in that feels a little dry, just go ahead
and mist it with a spray bottle. And then

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:23.840
just check for any type of rotting or shriveled
bulbs, discard them at that point so they

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:28.219
can't spread to the others. And then just
go ahead and plant them back down in the ground

00:02:28.219 --> 00:02:33.319
with a nice organic matter. They like it a
little bit acidic, so maybe find a compost

00:02:33.319 --> 00:02:37.849
that's a little on the acidic side that you'd
use for like hydrangeas or rhododendrons.

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:42.950
And use that one, and make sure that they
have a well drained soil, they can take a

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:47.530
moist soil. So if you've got an area in your
yard, where it's shady, but the moisture it's

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:51.239
kind of the soil doesn't tend to dry out.
This would be a good option for you for an

00:02:51.239 --> 00:02:55.739
annual plant, and make sure you give it plenty
of nitrogen. They like that high nitrogen

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:56.109
level.
