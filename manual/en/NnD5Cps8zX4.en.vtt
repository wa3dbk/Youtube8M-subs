00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:02.320
WIL WHEATON: Hello, internet.

00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:06.600
Let's address the elephant
in the room.

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.510
I just got out of bed and have
not really had a chance to put

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:13.340
myself together.

00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:17.380
But I wanted you to know that
there is a gag reel this week

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:21.780
for "Dragon Age RPG,"
and it is hilarious.

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:25.343
We shot close to six hours of
gameplay footage and had to

00:00:25.343 --> 00:00:27.270
edit it down to about
an hour total,

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:28.680
split over two episodes.

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.170
And most of what you're going
to see in this is just how

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:37.170
much fun we were having in
scenes that just had to be cut

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.510
out for time.

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.140
Finally before I leave, I want
to show you something.

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:49.460
This is my daily "Star Trek,"
"Doctor Who" crossover.

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:51.710
Until next time, play
more games.

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:58.040
For the rest of my childhood--

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:59.280
[MUMBLE]

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:03.290
I'm having a stroke.

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:08.200
I've asked my friends Chris
Hardwick, Kevin Sussman, some

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:11.620
other friends, and Joey
Jojo Junior Shabbadoo.

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:13.350
No, I got it, I just--

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:14.420
I had a fart in my mouth.

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:16.230
To play [BLEEP]

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:16.770
balls.

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.220
I'm the champion of [BLEEP]

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:19.310
balls.

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:20.510
Congratulations, where's
my [BLEEP]

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:21.685
balls trophy?

00:01:21.685 --> 00:01:23.235
Get card board me
and the [BLEEP]

00:01:23.235 --> 00:01:23.730
balls trophy.

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:26.770
I want that right now.

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:28.240
Mama's got a sparkle.

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:36.590
We're playing "Dragon
Age." That sucked.

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:38.810
No, no, it sucked, and
not in the good way.

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:41.220
Sorry, I kinda crushed
my nuts-- my nuts, my

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.132
balls, my man bits.

00:01:44.132 --> 00:01:46.410
-That dick and ball game?

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:47.870
WIL WHEATON: Turns out I'm
playing dick and balls.

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:51.910
This is an example of a classic
pen and [MUMBLE]

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:56.830
that lets players explore the
world of Ferelden from--

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:57.520
I touched it.

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:57.950
I touched it.

00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:59.010
We can cut to it.

00:01:59.010 --> 00:01:59.740
I touched it.

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:00.130
But that's--

00:02:00.130 --> 00:02:00.740
I can, we can.

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:04.660
This is a classic pen
and paper [BLEEP]

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:09.430
that lets players explore
and hold off the blight.

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:10.360
That's not right.

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:14.100
We are gray wardens, exploring
the world, exploring the

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:17.970
world, exploring the
world. "Tabletop."

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:22.280
We get to do something really
cool, called a stunt.

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:26.590
The stunt points we
get are [BLEEP]

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:28.850
your mom.

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:29.900
So deal with it.

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:31.860
If we roll doubles--

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:32.850
really, Wil?

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:33.330
Really?

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:36.070
That lets players explore
the land of--

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:37.760
I rolled doubles everybody.

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:39.340
What the [BLEEP]?

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:41.520
CHRIS HARDWICK: Fonzor
does not panic.

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:42.860
He's cool.

00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:44.200
WIL WHEATON: Cut to Fonzie.

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.182
[SCREAMS]

00:02:46.182 --> 00:02:47.542
CHRIS HARDWICK: Jesus Christ,
what the [BLEEP]

00:02:47.542 --> 00:02:47.994
is happening?

00:02:47.994 --> 00:02:48.898
I didn't [BLEEP]

00:02:48.898 --> 00:02:50.580
know it was going belch
out of the Earth.

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:51.300
WIL WHEATON: I thought
Darkspawn was

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:52.620
just a cover name.

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:54.285
I didn't know that's what
it actually was.

00:02:54.285 --> 00:02:56.050
CHRIS HARDWICK: I thought
it was just a--

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:57.475
WIL WHEATON: A guy
with a mask.

00:02:57.475 --> 00:02:57.950
CHRIS HARDWICK: A sadistic
motorcycle gang.

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:59.380
I didn't know that it was--

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:00.360
WIL WHEATON: Actual demons.

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:01.190
CHRIS HARDWICK: Jesus Christ.

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:03.190
What did I just get
myself into?

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:05.390
WIL WHEATON: This is bad,
man, this really bad.

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:06.080
CHRIS PRAMAS: Very good.

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.590
WIL WHEATON: So Gorick unrolls
his pack, and he brushes out

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:11.020
his beard--

00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:12.380
99 strokes on his beard.

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:14.010
CHRIS PRAMAS: I was going
to ask how many times.

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.390
WIL WHEATON: Yep, 99 strokes
on his beard.

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:18.510
CHRIS PRAMAS: If you were
getting a hint of something

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:21.284
else that you have never
smelled before.

00:03:24.092 --> 00:03:24.560
CHRIS HARDWICK: [BLEEP]

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:26.432
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:26.432 --> 00:03:29.890
SAM WITWER: Can your
nose smell victory?

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:31.500
And also, what does
it smell like?

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:32.985
And does it smell like napalm?

00:03:32.985 --> 00:03:34.810
WIL WHEATON: Oh, so since we're
in "Dragon Age," we are

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:36.533
all covered in blood
now, right.

00:03:36.533 --> 00:03:37.990
CHRIS PRAMAS: Oh,
are you kidding?

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:39.860
WIL WHEATON: Yeah, I mean,
just soaked through,

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:40.500
everywhere.

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:41.655
KEVIN SUSSMAN: It smells.

00:03:41.655 --> 00:03:42.360
It reeks.

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:46.900
SAM WITWER: He's like, guys,
you have no idea how this

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:47.920
smells, just saying.

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:50.375
WIL WHEATON: Are there any
copies of "Playdwarf" at the

00:03:50.375 --> 00:03:51.035
general store?

00:03:51.035 --> 00:03:52.230
I'm just sort, what
I'm doing is--

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:54.541
CHRIS HARDWICK: The centerfold
is just a regular-sized page.

00:03:54.541 --> 00:03:56.850
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:02.070
CHRIS PRAMAS: Yes, there's a
special "Bearded Dwarf Women--

00:04:02.070 --> 00:04:03.140
Myth or Reality?"

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:04.600
WIL WHEATON: OK, so when they're
not looking, I just

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:06.940
sort of put them in my bag, and
I'm all, this will serve

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:09.130
Gorick well when Gorick
makes camp.

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:10.780
CHRIS HARDWICK: Look at
thine lower beard.

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:11.660
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:13.720
WIL WHEATON: A rogue comet
passes between the

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:14.940
Earth and the Moon.

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:16.720
CHRIS PRAMAS: All right,
I miss you.

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:20.380
WIL WHEATON: [SCREAMING]

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:21.823
CHRIS HARDWICK: [SQUAWKING]

00:04:21.823 --> 00:04:23.270
WIL WHEATON: Lords of light.

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:25.280
Somebody fly me in just
some tiny little

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:26.910
piece of food thing.

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:29.891
I forgot to eat when
we did OTFs.

00:04:29.891 --> 00:04:30.785
CHRIS HARDWICK: [LAUGH]

00:04:30.785 --> 00:04:33.070
CHRIS PRAMAS: That is literally
what you asked for.

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:33.490
KEVIN SUSSMAN: There you go.

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:36.090
WIL WHEATON: Just think
about that.

00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:37.950
Think about it long and
hard, internet.
