WALK THROUGH A WEDDING
with Justin &amp; Mary

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:10.260
The Hora

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:14.830
Hey, we're Justin &amp; Mary and today we're gonna be
talking to you about how we photograph the hora.

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:18.060
Now, with the hora, Justin and I are
actually both shooting.

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:22.460
And the great news is with our B1 setup off in
the corner we are able to shoot at the same time

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:23.960
but from different angles.

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.060
If you think about it, there are actually two sets of
90 degrees, and two sets of 120 degrees at any time.

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.260
So if we go light source to subject,
drawing those two imaginary strings,

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:34.460
and subject to photographer,

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.960
there is actually a 90 degree straight off
to the left and straight off to the right.

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:39.960
And the same is true for our 120.

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:45.160
So we can be shooting from opposite sides
of the action getting great shots 

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:48.000
and both of us, still at the same time,
having really fantastic light.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:51.460
One of the keys when you're setting up the
Umbrella for this shot is that you want to make sure

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:53.060
that the light is high enough in the room.

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:56.260
That when the bride and groom are up in
the chair they are not being underlit.

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.660
And using the Umbrella in this situation
gives us a wide enough throw

00:00:59.660 --> 00:01:04.060
that we can cover action on both sides of the room
and it gives us enough light top to bottom.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:09.960
I really love that first moment when the bride sits down,
and all of a sudden the four groomsmen grab that chair,

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.060
and that first second, as she is lifting off the ground.

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:15.460
You never know whether there is gonna be
excitement or panic.

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:19.160
I think it's like 60% fun and about 40% fear.

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:22.760
If there's not that fear element,
there's no emotion to the image.

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:24.160
We have definitely seen the whole spectrum,

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:26.760
people that get really into it,
and they're swinging the napkin,

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:29.360
and then people who are just like...
literally be like "Why did I go on that chair".

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:30.360
"Let me down!"

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.360
and just like, "No, stop that! Let me down."
"Yeah, sure."
