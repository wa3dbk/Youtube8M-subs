00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:04.750
Hi, I'm Michael Lamendola with expertvillage.com
and today we're going to shoot some pool.

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:10.360
Alright, finally I won the lag around here
so I get to break. So, just like in eight

00:00:10.360 --> 00:00:15.130
ball or nine ball, if I make a ball on the
break, I keep moving. Let's just see what

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:28.699
happens.
Alright, I made the eight ball. That's one

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:37.590
of Jeff's. So, I keep shooting, trying to
make all of my opponent's balls. Now, if I

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:44.760
make all of six through ten, Jeff is eliminated
and his turn gets skipped. But, let's say

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.310
that I'm shooting all these balls and the
only shot that I have is one of mine, one

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:54.980
through five. That's why they call it Cutthroat.
Because if I can make one of my balls to continue

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:59.800
shooting everyone else's, then I'm going to
do so in order to keep shooting. Because I'm

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:08.929
not eliminated until all of my balls are sunk.
So, right now I'm looking and I see that I

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:27.139
can make the eleven ball. And then what do
I have next? I've got the seven ball. See,

00:01:27.139 --> 00:01:30.020
it's really easy in this game because you've
got so many choices. It's not like you're

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:35.630
limited by only six or seven balls. Now, in
this case, I'm looking and all I can see,

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:41.009
the easiest shot that I have is the four ball,
and that's one of mine. But, if I make it,

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:49.100
I keep shooting. So, even though that was
one of mine, my turn continues and I keep

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:53.679
going until I miss. Once I miss, then it's
the next player's turn - six through ten - that

00:01:53.679 --> 00:01:59.039
would be Jeff. And as long as the player,
whose next turn it is, has balls on the table

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:04.920
in his group, he gets to keep playing. You
win Cutthroat when you've sunk all of your

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:10.820
opponents' balls and only your balls remain.
Now, one stipulation. Let's say that the only

00:02:10.820 --> 00:02:17.440
balls left on the table were one of mine and
two of my opponent's, and the only shot that

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:24.560
I had was mine. If I can make my ball and
successfully make my opponent's other two

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:29.620
balls and not miss, then I win. But, if I
make my ball and leave myself with no balls

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:38.660
on the table, and then miss one of their shots,
I lose. Okay, I got a little excited and while

00:02:38.660 --> 00:02:43.470
trying to make one of Louis's balls I scratched.
Well, that's good news for my two opponents

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:49.370
in Cutthroat because, when you scratch, each
of your opponents gets one ball pulled. So,

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:55.550
in this case, the eight for Jeff, the fifteen
for Louis. Find the spot where the one ball

00:02:55.550 --> 00:03:01.630
went, or the front ball on your rack. Eight
ball, fifteen ball, doesn't matter what order.

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:07.440
And then the next person in line gets to shoot.
Now, let's say, for example, that Jeff didn't

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:12.920
have any balls on the table. Well, now he's
back in the game. So, even if you're taken

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:15.980
out, you're not eliminated because if your
opponent scratches while the game is still

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:19.280
going, then your ball gets pulled out and
you get to keep playing.
