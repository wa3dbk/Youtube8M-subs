00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:04.720
These are instructions for the Strutmasters
front strut conversion installation for the

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:06.979
Mercedes S430.

00:00:06.979 --> 00:00:12.639
These instructions will fit year models 1999
through 2006.

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:18.119
Remember that safety is always a primary concern,
always secure your vehicle on jacks before

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:21.070
you remove the front wheel.

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:25.460
Remove the front and rear set screws from
the bottom of the original strut, this procedure

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:30.410
uses a 5 millimeter Allen wrench.

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:35.300
The control arm should always move freely
from the strut once the set screws have been

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:40.559
removed.

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:45.430
Return to the top of the car and pinch in
the two tabs to remove the strut sensor.

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:55.050
Channel lock pliers may be useful if you're
unable to pinch the tabs with your hand.

00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:14.720
Remove the three nut that hold the strut using
a 13 millimeter socket 

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:23.610
and then remove the retainer plate.

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:27.990
A pry bar will be needed to pull the control
arm down enough to remove the factory strut

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:37.390
from the vehicle.

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:50.720
Now prepare to install the new Strutmasters
strut assembly.

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:56.530
Affirm that all the nuts and washers that
are required are present for the top 3 studs.

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:04.840
Also affirm that both set screws at the bottom
of the strut are present.

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:24.270
Now install the new Strutmasters strut into
position.

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:29.800
Once the three studs are aligned, push through
and install the upper nuts loosely.

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:43.090
This procedure will probably require two people.�
Use a crowbar to pry the control arm downward

00:02:43.090 --> 00:02:53.770
in order to guide the strut over the lower
mounting stud.�Ensure that the lower ball

00:02:53.770 --> 00:03:04.930
joint is completely seated on the lower ball
joint pin.

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:15.830
Use Allen wrench to tighten the set screws
completely tight onto the ball joint pin.

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:27.570
Always remember to tighten both set screws.

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:48.880
After you've tightened both set screws, move
to the top to tighten the three upper studs.

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:54.430
Use a zip tie to tie the factory strut controller,
which will no longer be used to an existing

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:59.430
wire harness.

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:10.820
Neatly trim the zip ties and always be careful
not to cut the existing factory wires.

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:36.270
Place front wheel back onto the front hub,
install and tighten all your lug nuts.�Always

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:41.100
check your owner's manual or call your local
Mercedes dealer for further information.
