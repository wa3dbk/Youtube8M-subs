Hi, it's Paris from Rainy Day Dreamers, and if you're watching this video today, September 9th,

00:00:04.932 --> 00:00:09.513
2014, the very first day of our new channel, you've probably just subscribed.  Thank you and

00:00:09.513 --> 00:00:11.124
welcome.

00:00:17.337 --> 00:00:22.173
Today is Turning Japanese Tuesday, the very first episode, and it isn't a day where we're going

00:00:22.173 --> 00:00:27.149
to be doing Japanese candy kits or something like that.  Rather, I lived in Japan for six years

00:00:27.149 --> 00:00:32.249
teaching English.  I went there on the advice of a friend.  When I got there I spoke no Japanese,

00:00:32.249 --> 00:00:37.749
which made for lots of extra adventures the first year or so.  Fortunately, I was able to get work

00:00:37.749 --> 00:00:43.130
right away.  In those days, anyone who was a native English speaker was in big demand.  I

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:47.067
started out teaching at an English conversation school.  That meant in the afternoon I taught

00:00:47.067 --> 00:00:52.095
housewives.  Later around dinnertime it was the school students, and then in the evening it was

00:00:52.095 --> 00:00:56.561
the businessmen.  Now, there may have been one or two businesswomen; but really it was the

00:00:56.561 --> 00:01:03.956
businessmen in Japan then.  A few years back it was very clear, men's roles and women's roles in

00:01:03.956 --> 00:01:09.397
society.  I know there was the occasional independent free spirit who would back the trends.

00:01:09.397 --> 00:01:14.105
The saying in Japan is "the nail that sticks up gets hammered down," and mostly that's what I

00:01:14.105 --> 00:01:15.045
saw.

00:01:15.045 --> 00:01:18.700
Over time I found I really liked teaching the school students because they were mostly in the

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:23.847
class because they wanted to be, so they had motivation.  They wanted to go travel abroad and

00:01:23.847 --> 00:01:29.585
have adventures.  The housewives, I'm not -- I never was entirely sure.  Some of them, their

00:01:29.585 --> 00:01:33.088
husbands were going to be posted abroad, maybe in the U.S., and so they were learning English

00:01:33.088 --> 00:01:36.652
so they could help with all of the stuff they have to do for the family when they moved here,

00:01:36.652 --> 00:01:41.565
usually for assignments of about three years; but for most of the housewives, I think it was a

00:01:41.565 --> 00:01:46.981
cultural enrichment thing, at least in those days because you could in the afternoon go to improve

00:01:46.981 --> 00:01:53.714
yourself, take classes in flower arranging or doing tea ceremony or learning conversational

00:01:53.714 --> 00:02:00.019
English.  So, it was students for me.  I'm not complaining.  And the businessmen or "salaryman,"

00:02:00.019 --> 00:02:05.004
which is salary man, who came in the evenings, they wanted to learn usually because they were

00:02:05.004 --> 00:02:09.473
being sent abroad, sometimes against their will, but in those days in the late Eighties for the most

00:02:09.473 --> 00:02:14.785
part, Japan was really expanding; and so they were setting up factories everywhere, they needed

00:02:14.785 --> 00:02:18.763
people who could speak English to go and run them.  So, they were motivated for the work; but

00:02:18.763 --> 00:02:24.439
oh my gosh, were they tired.  These people often start early because you're supposed to be at

00:02:24.439 --> 00:02:30.590
your desk before your boss gets in.  So, they would often be at work 7:00, 7:30; and you don't

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:35.870
leave until your boss leaves.  So, they would often be there until 8:00 o'clock at night, come to a

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:40.598
late-night English class that finished at 9:30 or 10:00 o'clock; and some of the most common

00:02:40.598 --> 00:02:47.152
requests in those late-evening businessman classes was "Let's have class out tonight."  By "out"

00:02:47.152 --> 00:02:51.286
they wanted to go to a restaurant-bar kind of place.  Somewhere where they could have a beer,

00:02:51.286 --> 00:02:54.412
sit around, and chat in English.

00:02:54.412 --> 00:02:59.223
So, there's lots of stories to tell about that; but my favorite group of students were the actual

00:02:59.223 --> 00:03:04.280
students:  junior high school, high school, college students who were in English conversation

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:08.845
class because they wanted to go abroad, have those adventures, have the different opportunities

00:03:08.845 --> 00:03:13.452
of going to study abroad and so forth.  So, they were really motivated; and for the most part

00:03:13.452 --> 00:03:20.297
their brains were still moldable enough that they could get English.  So, after that I was able to

00:03:20.297 --> 00:03:25.437
arrange work as an English conversation teacher at some high schools and junior high schools and

00:03:25.437 --> 00:03:26.894
fill my schedule that way.

00:03:26.894 --> 00:03:30.665
Now, the school system in Japan is quite a bit different in a lot of ways from the school system in

00:03:30.665 --> 00:03:36.298
the U.S.; but one main difference is you only have to go to school until you're 13 years old.  So,

00:03:36.298 --> 00:03:41.154
you would think well, nobody goes to school after they turn 14.  That's not true.  They have like

00:03:41.154 --> 00:03:46.349
a 97 percent high school graduation rate, even though you're not required to go to high school,

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:50.534
whereas here in the U.S. you're required to go to school until you're 18 or graduate high school;

00:03:50.534 --> 00:03:55.417
and yet only 70 percent of the kids here finish high school.  Also, once you get to high school

00:03:55.417 --> 00:04:00.833
and at some junior high schools, it's not a neighborhood school system.  It's not because you live

00:04:00.833 --> 00:04:04.741
within two miles of the school this will be your school.  If you want to go to that high school,

00:04:04.741 --> 00:04:10.480
you have to pass a test to get into it; and graduating from a good high school is how you get into

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:15.412
a good university.  Graduating from a good university is how you get into a good company, get a

00:04:15.412 --> 00:04:21.629
good job.  Basically, your life is determined right about 13, 14 years old, if not younger because

00:04:21.629 --> 00:04:27.367
you should have already been going to the juku, which is the afterschool school, the two or three

00:04:27.367 --> 00:04:32.480
hours you put in after regular school so you really learn your stuff.

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:35.987
Fortunately my junior high and high school students that I had in the English conversation school

00:04:35.987 --> 00:04:40.844
were still relatively awake when I taught them because it was only 5:00 or 6:00 o'clock.  When

00:04:40.844 --> 00:04:45.679
they finished with English conversation, they would go to the juku to just study and memorize

00:04:45.679 --> 00:04:51.696
math, science, history; and they would do that for two or three hours.  So, they would be at

00:04:51.696 --> 00:04:57.888
school at 7:30 in the morning, get home, 9:30 at night.  But I found if you actually gave the kids

00:04:57.888 --> 00:05:03.616
a little bit of space so they could show their own originality and creativity, they loved it; and

00:05:03.616 --> 00:05:07.283
they did amazing things.  I ran the English Club at a couple of different schools.  We did

00:05:07.283 --> 00:05:12.975
Halloween parties with kids dressing up.  We did little Thanksgiving things, Easter, any -- well,

00:05:12.975 --> 00:05:18.733
since my culture is U.S. culture, is basically the holidays and festivities of the U.S. that I tried to

00:05:18.733 --> 00:05:23.379
introduce to them; but I saw and experienced lots of other stuff in Japan, as well.

00:05:23.379 --> 00:05:28.661
I climbed Mount Fuji four times.  Now, they have a saying in Japan that "He who summits

00:05:28.661 --> 00:05:36.052
Mount Fuji once has elevated his soul.  He who climbs Mount Fuji twice is a fool."  That would

00:05:36.052 --> 00:05:41.793
be me.  It costs a fortune to have a car in Japan, so I had a motorcycle.  You don't have to pay

00:05:41.793 --> 00:05:47.201
for a parking space with that.  So, I traveled all over Japan by motorcycle.  After my six years

00:05:47.201 --> 00:05:53.042
teaching in Japan, a Japanese friend and I actually embarked on a trip around the world where

00:05:53.042 --> 00:05:58.250
we crossed 27 countries and four continents in an old Jeep; but the other things I took with me

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:05.575
leaving Japan were lots, and lots, and lots of photos, various souvenir and memorabilia things

00:06:05.575 --> 00:06:11.391
from my various years there.  I even have my certificate that says I can speak Japanese.  So,

00:06:11.391 --> 00:06:17.315
throughout the coming weeks, every Tuesday on this channel, I will be recounting my adventures

00:06:17.315 --> 00:06:21.979
and experiences in Japan.  All the good things that happened; and there were bad things, as well,

00:06:21.979 --> 00:06:28.054
especially with dealing with discrimination.  Japan is a very insular society, and no way that I

00:06:28.054 --> 00:06:33.399
look like them.  So, if you're interested in hearing these stories, then be sure and subscribe to
