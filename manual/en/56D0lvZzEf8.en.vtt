Hi, I’m David Daniels,
author of Look What’s Missing.

00:00:02.833 --> 00:00:06.899
Did you know there are 3 words missing
from 35 popular Bibles,

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:11.175
that make Jesus Christ into a sinner
—or worse?

00:00:11.176 --> 00:00:15.683
My book lists 250 examples, but this one
will make you sit up and take notice.

00:00:15.684 --> 00:00:19.100
It's about Jesus.

00:00:19.101 --> 00:00:24.369
Is it a sin to be angry?
35 popular Bibles say it is.

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:27.407
They have taken out three
of Jesus’ own words,

00:00:27.408 --> 00:00:32.544
and turned Him, God the Son, into a sinner.

00:00:32.545 --> 00:00:37.833
Look for yourself in Matthew 5:22.
Here it is in The Green Bible.

00:00:37.834 --> 00:00:42.120
No kidding. Verses on the environment
are in green.

00:00:42.121 --> 00:00:43.685
"But I say to you

00:00:43.686 --> 00:00:48.864
that if you are angry with a brother
or sister, you will be liable to judgment."

00:00:48.865 --> 00:00:54.000
So if I’m angry with someone,
I’m liable to judgment?

00:00:54.001 --> 00:00:56.211
That's what it says.

00:00:56.212 --> 00:01:00.036
Okay, let’s say this
and 34 other popular Bibles ARE right.

00:01:00.037 --> 00:01:04.639
It IS a sin to be angry that we’ll have to
give an account for in the Day of Judgment.

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:09.702
What about Jesus? He was very angry. TWICE!

00:01:09.703 --> 00:01:11.727
The first time, in John 2,

00:01:11.728 --> 00:01:17.446
He made a whip out of cords, chased out
the money changers, the sheep and the oxen,

00:01:17.447 --> 00:01:22.900
poured out the money and overthrew the
tables! That sounds like anger to me.

00:01:22.901 --> 00:01:27.016
The 2nd time,
listed in Matthew 21 and Mark 11,

00:01:27.017 --> 00:01:31.191
He also threw out the buyers,

00:01:31.192 --> 00:01:36.786
knocked over their seats, and wouldn’t let
anybody bring a vessel through the temple!

00:01:36.787 --> 00:01:40.160
Let's face it. Jesus was angry. Twice.

00:01:40.161 --> 00:01:46.027
And according to 35 popular Bibles,
Jesus was a sinner.

00:01:46.028 --> 00:01:49.000
But was Jesus sinning? Of course not.

00:01:49.001 --> 00:01:53.719
Let’s look at Matthew 5:22 in a real Bible:

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:57.192
"But I say unto you,
That whosoever is angry with his brother

00:01:57.193 --> 00:02:01.486
WITHOUT A CAUSE
shall be in danger of the judgment…"

00:02:01.487 --> 00:02:06.556
Oh! So it’s only a sin
if you’re angry without a cause!

00:02:06.557 --> 00:02:11.865
Jesus had the perfect cause: His Father’s
house was being made a house of merchandise!

00:02:11.866 --> 00:02:15.000
And furthermore, it fulfilled prophecy!

00:02:15.001 --> 00:02:18.500
Read John 2:17 for yourself.

00:02:18.501 --> 00:02:24.344
2 Corinthians 5:21 makes the doctrine clear.
It says Jesus knew no sin.

00:02:24.345 --> 00:02:29.562
But 35 popular Bibles say
Jesus sinned–twice!

00:02:29.563 --> 00:02:34.000
If you have one of those Bibles,
seriously: get a new one.
