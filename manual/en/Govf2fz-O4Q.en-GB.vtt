This is Fieldsports Channel News.

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:15.870
12-year-olds can hit targets at 1,000 yards.
In this video, smart rifle manufacturer TrackingPoint

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:22.210
shows a 12-year-old middle school student
from Texas hitting targets at 250, 500, 750

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:27.900
and 1000 yards with a TrackingPoint .338 Lapua
Magnum long range hunting rifle. The rifle

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.750
uses microelectronics, wireless technology
and an integral ballistics calculator for

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:39.890
targeting, tracking, networking, and fire
control. Batteries not included.

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:44.719
Nominations for the Countryside Alliance Awards,
also known as the Rural Oscars, closes on

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:50.559
Friday 1st November 2013. The annual celebration
of rural businesses, produce and communities

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:55.129
offers prizes in four categories and gives
a boost to rural communities. If you know

00:00:55.129 --> 00:01:02.820
of a worthy and inspiring rural business,
please nominate them now at CountrysideAllianceAwards.org.uk.

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.970
The Scandinavian press is full of stories
as the annual elk hunt gets under way, probably

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:09.360
best not to read about it on the loo.

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:13.940
This video of elk in urban areas has been
widely reported. In another story, a Norwegian

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:18.550
shooter is guilty of not checking his backstop.
He aimed at an elk, missed it, and instead

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:23.520
shot a man on a toilet in a wooden cabin.
The man's injuries are not life threatening

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:29.250
and his wife says she forgives the hunter.
And a pastor and a newly licenced hunter gave

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:35.360
the "elk hunt sermon" in a Swedish church
appeared wearing some unusual headwear.

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:41.610
Dallas Safari Club is to auction a black rhino
hunting permit on behalf of the Namibian Government

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:42.610
of.

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:47.560
The hunt will generate around US$1 million
for rhino conservation efforts. When asked

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:53.000
by outraged antis if the club would consider
a photo safari instead, a spokesman answered:

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.420
"Well, that's great, but people don't pay
for that."

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:01.090
Now when it comes to outraging antis and shooters
alike, you can't beat the birdhunters of the

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:03.470
island of Malta.

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:08.350
BirdLife Malta took this film of them shooting
a booted eagle. This is the 12th eagle shot

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:12.840
on Malta this year, according to BirdLife
International, which is supported by Zeiss

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:18.470
sports optics. Zeiss has donated a scopes
worth more than Â£7,000 to help the organisation

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:23.860
document illegal bird shooting during the
migration season.

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:28.390
And finally, a man filming his fishing show
in Mexico thought he was home and dry - but

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:31.670
he didn't reckon on Pancho the local sealion.

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:36.760
Chef Yvan Mucharrz had been taken on the fishing
trip by Mike 'The Griz' Ritz during filming

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:41.750
of a segment for his cable TV show Chef On
The Water. But it's Pancho who gets to eat

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:43.660
the mahi-mahi

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:49.400
