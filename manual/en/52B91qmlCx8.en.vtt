cars dot com auto reviews

00:00:06.279 --> 00:00:08.280
I am Kelsey Mays for cars dot com

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.910
with me is the 2010 GMC Terrain this is a
new vehicle for GMC

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:16.619
we covered it earlier this year at the
New York Auto Show if you saw that video

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:19.850
you'll know that it's basically a twin
to the redesign Chevy

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:24.480
equinoxes which I've now been reminded
is pronounced equinoxes not Equinox

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.589
by my colleagues and readers sorry I'm
really working on this whole

00:00:27.589 --> 00:00:31.179
and fastest thing no matter how you
pronounce the trains

00:00:31.179 --> 00:00:35.550
Chevy twin though I really think you're
gonna find a better choice than this GMC

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:39.059
and either way you're probably gonna
find the force on her

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:44.309
a better option than the v6 model I'll
explain why now General Motors says the

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:47.899
equinoxes and terrain share very few
body panels I actually

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:50.940
a think they should I shared markers the
equinoxes

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.309
pretty good lookin SUV the trains got
these blocky fenders it's got really

00:00:55.309 --> 00:00:56.250
busy front

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:00.170
tale it seems kinda indecisive least
I'll let you didn't really

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:04.839
have a cohesive theme to it better
things going on

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:08.939
inside i funny rooms spread out seater
reasonably comfortable

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.939
it's the driving aspects and have a
concern we've driven both the force on

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:13.790
on the six

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:17.170
to Knox train obviously chemically
identical

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:21.180
RV six test car uses hydraulic power
steering not the electric cars for a

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.280
four cylinder has

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.280
differences that it's a little bit
harder to turn it takes a little more

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.670
effort to turn the wheel at low speeds
especially

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:31.630
in the force under I'm also noticing
that the accelerator pedal has

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:35.100
a little bit more of a gradual take up
to it and there's a bit of accelerator

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.939
lag that kinda manifests itself as
you're pulling into traffic

00:01:37.939 --> 00:01:41.049
on you hit the gas have moving up in
speed

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:44.100
sometimes doesn't seem like the
drivetrain really is showing up for the

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:44.560
game

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.210
same thing with the six-speed automatic
transmission not a big fan of this one

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:48.899
in particular

00:01:48.899 --> 00:01:52.259
little bit laggy takes a little bit
longer sorta kickdown

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.840
the force owner actually seen better
tuned in general it just seems more

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:56.780
responsive

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.740
a and there's adequate power there it's
not like you know you really want a more

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:02.079
powerful v6 doesn't feel

00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:06.490
all that much more powerful in the AM
how to set up pretty good there's a

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:07.950
decent amount a room back here

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:12.120
and multiple scuff plates here you can
easily throw in a few golf bags not

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:12.730
worry about

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:16.349
stepping up your bumpers any the pay it
back here I'm you will want to think

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:16.750
about

00:02:16.750 --> 00:02:21.050
gas mileage 36 does take a significant
hit in mileage versus the force under

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:22.660
special if you just sticking with

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:27.090
front-wheel-drive 36 does told more than
twice as much as a force on earth so

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:30.810
there is some reason to get that yet but
I think a lot about using a stick with

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:31.580
the force owner

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:34.660
and I think a lot of other buyers are
gonna go the equinoxes instead of this

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:41.660
honestly I can't fault you for doing
either one
