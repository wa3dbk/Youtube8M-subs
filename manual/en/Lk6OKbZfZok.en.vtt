00:00:00.361 --> 00:00:06.500
microKORG stand

00:00:06.501 --> 00:00:13.130
I bought a big thing

00:00:13.131 --> 00:00:19.970
Not a tripod… ah kind of a tripod. very big

00:00:22.701 --> 00:00:32.000
It doesn't have a pan head. It's not convenience.

00:00:32.001 --> 00:00:37.500
Is its hight… Had missing…

00:00:37.501 --> 00:00:45.600
about 140cm? 130cm?

00:00:45.601 --> 00:00:50.500
Well.. What is this?

00:00:54.031 --> 00:00:59.470
a stand of a microKORG series

00:00:59.471 --> 00:01:01.770
can't see my face.

00:01:16.331 --> 00:01:29.140
Why did I buy it for? I want to put the MacBook Air on it.

00:01:29.141 --> 00:01:36.000
I want to play something like the Kraftwerk.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:41.271
Tonight, June 6, Lunar eclipse

00:01:41.271 --> 00:01:51.440
I want to do the Hungout On Air for that eclipse with using this stand.

00:01:51.441 --> 00:02:06.270
But I forgot to have HDMI cable for a video camera. So this stand became a picnic table.

00:02:06.271 --> 00:02:08.940
By the way…

00:02:08.941 --> 00:02:17.700
I really want a carrying bag for this.

00:02:17.701 --> 00:02:25.930
stand of the microKORG "ST-MICRO"
