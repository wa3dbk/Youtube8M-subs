On behalf of expertvillage.com I'm Tom Flowers
of Well Tempered Piano Tuning. I'm here to

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:11.170
talk to you about piano tuning and maintenance.
Now we're actually going to pull the action.

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:17.530
The keys and all the action parts are sitting
on what's called a key frame. It's also screwed

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:23.510
into the key bed which I didn't notice before.
So I'll need to grab a screwdriver and we'll

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:33.030
pull that out. This is all kept together in
a way so that the size and geometry of what's

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:37.410
happening down here for the player matches
what's happening and hits the right string.

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:49.040
If that gets out even a little bit, that can
be a real problem. You get the effects. So

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:55.270
as I pull this out, keep in mind there's about
seventy-seven parts per key and we have eighty-eight

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:59.600
keys. So you can do the math and see that
there's a lot of parts sitting here. There's

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:05.951
also a lot of things in here that aren't supposed
to be in here. Now, as I pull it out, there

00:01:05.951 --> 00:01:08.939
are a number of things not traditionally.
In piano school I didn't learn anything about

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.509
how many straws or spoons need to be in a
piano. I think the approximate number though

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:15.729
is zero and oh, here's some pens and we're
going to take this out as carefully as we

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:34.909
can and here we go. Now, as we get closer,
because you see the keys extend into the back

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:40.759
under the action parts and we'll talk about
those in a moment. This is called a key stop.

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:47.359
It's the only job in life is to keep the keys
from wedging out and becoming stuck when this

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:54.429
piano is turned on its spine side for moving
which is how pianos are moved. So while it's

00:01:54.429 --> 00:01:58.829
in the piano, it doesn't really do anything.
It's very important before a piano move. I

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:07.909
get lots of calls to straighten out keys because
that wasn't in place. So as we pull it out,

00:02:07.909 --> 00:02:12.830
we have to make sure that the hammers aren't
catching under what we call the stretcher.

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:31.330
And okay, we have a few stubborn ones and
here we go. So there is the complete action.

00:02:31.330 --> 00:02:35.820
Eighty-eight hammers on flanges and shanks
with what's called a whippet underneath. All

00:02:35.820 --> 00:02:42.090
of this adds up to being able to play a string,
hit a string and being able to hit it again.
