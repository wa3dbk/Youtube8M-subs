What's going on nation? Today

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:23.080
I'm going to demonstrate for you guys how to do a sumo deadlift also known as a wide stance

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.360
Deadlift now when compared to a traditional

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:30.249
Deadlift you still are going to be targeting your glutes quads and lower back

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:34.060
But this exercise is going to put a bit more emphasis on your hamstrings

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:36.939
And you're also going to be working on your hip strength as well

00:00:37.489 --> 00:00:41.919
Another benefit of the sumo deadlift is going to put less stress on your lower back

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:44.949
And if you're looking to really maximize your lift

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:50.799
The bar has less of a distance to travel because of how wide your legs are while performing the exercise

00:00:50.899 --> 00:00:53.739
So you should be able to lift a little bit more weight as well

00:00:54.289 --> 00:00:57.698
Begin the exercise by approaching the bar with a wide stance

00:00:58.219 --> 00:01:03.038
Your toes should be close to the collars of the barbell and pointing away from your body you

00:01:03.379 --> 00:01:07.299
can use an overhand grip or a switch grip when performing the exercise

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:13.959
Just make sure that your hands are directly under your shoulders if you grab the barbell with your hands too close to your torso

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.309
your stomach is going to push your elbows forward as you perform the lift as

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:25.479
you lower your body and grab the barbell be sure to keep your chest up and push your knees out

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:32.559
It is also very important to remember to keep your core tight throughout the entire lift by taking a breath to create that

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:34.840
internal belt before each rep

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:41.679
try your best to keep your shoulders neutral and as low as possible to make the distance the bar has to travel as short as

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:45.729
possible, this will help you maximize the amount of weight you can lift as you

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:51.939
Begin to lift the bar to your knees lean back and drive through your hips as you push through your heels

00:01:53.869 --> 00:01:59.019
Once you reach the top lower the bar back down to the ground at a controlled manner and repeat

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:03.489
Remember nation the deadlift is not a lower back exercise

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:08.020
you want to make sure you are only lifting the bar by pushing through your hips if

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:14.619
You suffer from bar drag on your shins you can tape them before the lift to ensure you don't tear up your skin

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:21.910
