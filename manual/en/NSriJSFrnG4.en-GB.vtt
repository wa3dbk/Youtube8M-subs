00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:09.410
This is Fieldsports Channel News.

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:13.580
With wildlife and shooting issues hitting
the headlines in the UK, the Fieldsports Channel

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:17.619
team have been out making the case for countrysports
in the media.

00:00:17.619 --> 00:00:22.190
Roy Lupton has been on BBC radio explaining
that walkers are not being shot at when shot

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:27.960
drops near them, despite one women's fears
someone will be killed. Roy was also allowed

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:31.410
to air his views on walkers actually sticking
to footpaths in the first place.

00:00:31.410 --> 00:00:37.250
From a wildlife perspective as well with these
people popping up, appearing where they shouldn't

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:42.149
be with dogs not under control it is causing
a lot of problems to wildlife.

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:46.659
Even Charlie has been in on the act, talking
to BBC News about the badger cull.

00:00:46.659 --> 00:00:51.159
Protestors did everything right by the media
and there was all that nonsense about hearing

00:00:51.159 --> 00:00:55.789
badgers screaming in the middle of the night,
what? But they did it right. That sort of

00:00:55.789 --> 00:01:00.289
thing made the press and whenever the press
or broadcast ask the national Farmers Union

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:03.899
for a comment they say would you like to meet
a farmer who has lost his herd to TB which

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.670
is all very worthy but it doesn't tell the
story.

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:11.930
Roy and Charlie doing their bit there, or
better known in the press, marksmen.

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:16.970
Now frozen yogurt is currently quite trendy,
but we didn't know that word had spread to

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:22.030
wildlife. A deer pushed through the swinging
door of a 'Peachwave' shop in New Jersey,

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:28.040
USA, last month and had an exciting romp,
doing $5,000 in damage to the shop as it freaked

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:33.230
out because its hooves could not get any traction
on the shiny floor. The owner's son set the

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:38.250
CCTV footage to you guessed it "Benny Hill"
and posted it on YouTube.

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:44.370
A horse race in June featuring Shires galloping
at Lingfield Park Racecourse has won a national

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:49.152
award. The Showerking Flying Feathers Maiden
Stakes was the first Shire horse race to be

00:01:49.152 --> 00:01:53.350
staged in Britain on a racecourse and was
held to raise money for the Countryside Alliance

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:59.230
Foundation. The 400m race won its award at
the annual Racecourse Association Awards.

00:01:59.230 --> 00:02:04.000
All the horses were provided by Hurst Green
Shires, and the race was won by Joey, who

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.860
was ridden to victory by Mark Grant.

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:13.300
Anyone caught out by gun licensing laws can
take heart from a police raid at a farm in

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:19.920
Queensland, Australia. The farmer and his
two sons had more than 300 guns and 4.2 tons

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:25.870
of ammunition. The men were licensed to have
just 71 weapons. Most of the stockpile was

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:32.410
illegal, said Detective Superintendent Jon
Wacker of the Queensland Police.

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:37.770
Now Americans are bumping into so many large
animals, they are changing their hunting laws.

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:42.290
Faced with an outbreak of lyme disease and
rising deer-related car accidents, a North

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:45.730
Carolina city has authorised bow hunting within
the city limits, as has a city in Illinois,

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:46.730
provided that it occurs in green spaces such
as golf courses, parks and cemeteries. Even

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:47.730
in the heart of Silicon Valley, California,
authorities have voted to allow hunting wild

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:51.500
pigs. The problem is so acute, it has made
the front cover of Time magazine.

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:57.040
New Zealand seafishers face an unusual problem
This angler is happily reeling in an Australian

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:02.031
salmon when gannets go for it. Fast thinking
and fast playing saves the day and the sea

00:03:02.031 --> 00:03:05.120
bird goes away fishless.

00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:09.630
And finally, it had to happen. A group of
American hunters have posted their response

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:17.400
to the YouTube hit 'What Does the Fox Say?'

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:22.930
What does the buck say?' is filmed on more
of a budget than the original.

00:03:22.930 --> 00:03:28.500
You are now up to date with Fieldsports Channel
News. Stalking the stories. Fishing for facts.
