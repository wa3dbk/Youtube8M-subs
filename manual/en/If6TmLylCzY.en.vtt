Music intro

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:08.219
Hi food team.

00:00:08.219 --> 00:00:11.150
my question for you today is how do you make boring brown rice,

00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:13.369
this stuff, this is the basmati variety,

00:00:13.369 --> 00:00:18.509
more interesting because we know it takes a very long time to cook and it can be very bland.

00:00:18.509 --> 00:00:21.630
So apart from just simple seasoning, any advice or tips on how to

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.189
jazz it up a little bit?

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:25.750
Brown rice has got a gorgeous nutty flavour ,

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:30.619
not a lot of people like to use brown rice but it's actually got more nutrients than white rice

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:36.270
and district making it more interesting
is making him a broad range of societies and the trick to making it more interesting is make it the hero rather than just the side dish.

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.740
In the recipes here that i've done. I've made
it the main thing.

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:45.870
I really love to make brown rice salad
dressed in oil, vinegar, feta, rocket

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:49.600
all those beautiful flavours combined make a lovely dinner with your brown rice

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.050
Cook the rice, follow packet instructions

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:58.090
but also, cook it in stock rather than just water that sort of gives you a good base flavour for your rice.

00:00:58.090 --> 00:00:59.520
I'm going to add

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:06.520
some red wine vinegar, oil, flat leaf parsley

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.310
roughly chop it.

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:13.340
And some mint as well. Pick the leaves rather than just chopping because the stalks are really

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.050
tough anyways.

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:19.180
Chop this all together.

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:22.550
That's all going to go in this bowl of rice,

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:26.950
so then I've got here some toasted pumpkin, sesame and pine nuts

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:27.970
Really yummy.

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:29.939
Add those in too.

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:33.570
Red chilli

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.230
this can all be tossed together.

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:39.430
It already looks more interesting

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:43.820
Bit of salt and pepper

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:49.660
and then rocket, a generous handful.

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:52.780
Here I've got some from squashed which I've roasted

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:54.870
It's cooled down a bit

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:58.540
I'm just going to try a little bit,

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:01.090
bit more oil.

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:03.420
and a little bit more salt

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:06.080
although remember that you're still going to be adding your feta so you've got another

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:07.320
flavour to come.

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:10.649
So I'm just going to plate this up now.

00:02:10.649 --> 00:02:12.049
on top of that

00:02:12.049 --> 00:02:14.729
some of the squash

00:02:14.729 --> 00:02:16.449
add a few more seeds.

00:02:16.449 --> 00:02:19.359
Bit more rocket

00:02:19.359 --> 00:02:20.659
feta.

00:02:20.659 --> 00:02:23.049
You don't need too much

00:02:23.049 --> 00:02:30.049
finish it with some extra chilli, mint

00:02:30.819 --> 00:02:32.109
oil

00:02:32.109 --> 00:02:34.079
a few more nuts

00:02:34.079 --> 00:02:40.290
and there you have it something a bit more interesting to do with your brown rice. Enjoy!

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.079
Another great idea for brown rice, this is

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:47.339
egg fried brown rice

00:02:47.339 --> 00:02:50.400
Get a pan on, so it's on sort of a low heat

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.699
put your rice to one side

00:02:54.699 --> 00:03:01.699
three eggs

00:03:02.309 --> 00:03:07.019
you want to scramble it so just move you spoon around a bit,

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:09.969
Once it's scrambled, you can stir the rice into it

00:03:09.969 --> 00:03:12.400
You can see that the egg's cooking

00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:16.569
So it's probably a good stage to stir the rice through because there's only a bit left to cook.

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:20.509
It won't be too much

00:03:20.509 --> 00:03:22.379
Season it with a bit of pepper

00:03:22.379 --> 00:03:26.849
little bit of soy, keep it simple

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:28.879
Spring onions, fresh red chilli

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:30.479
keep them raw

00:03:30.479 --> 00:03:32.679
you want to get that real kick

00:03:32.679 --> 00:03:39.010
Chop these up, I'm going to stir through half of this and put a bit more on top.

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:43.319
Taste.

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:47.629
Bit more soy.

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:52.029
We're going to plate up now

00:03:52.029 --> 00:03:56.439
Bit more spring onion, bit more chilli,

00:03:56.439 --> 00:04:01.179
this taste something that will insisting
the boring brown rice aside it seems

00:04:01.179 --> 00:04:08.179
that i'll be happy

00:04:18.019 --> 00:04:20.669
