00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:05.960
Cruise in on a Batman Tumbler that you control
with your cell phone and if you fallout, grab

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:10.370
yourself one of these glow-in-the-dark Nuka
Colas. Because I’m Jake and this is episode

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:17.390
#30 of Game LÜT.

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:21.750
Take a bite out of some Legend of Zelda Gacha
which are chocolate balls that have a Zelda

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.070
figurine in the middle. Clean your hands off
with Pokéball soap so you don’t get any

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.230
chocolate smeared onto your Dragon Ball Z
kicks. If going super saiyan took it out of

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:37.170
you, recharge with an external battery and
SD card reader that looks like a Famicom controller.

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:41.649
Feeling better? Good, so put down that Game
Boy Mug onto one of these beautiful Skyrim

00:00:41.649 --> 00:00:47.600
Guard Shield coasters so you can 3D Print
Mario Kart RC turtle shells…

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:53.110
For this next bit we’re going to need a
lot of light so turn on a Street Fighter Ryu

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:58.530
Figure, awesome Batman Cowl Replica lamp,
and then burn some Video Game Candles that

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:04.489
fill the room with scents of White Mage, Hyrulian
Forest or Quantum Tunnel. Now that we have

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:09.159
enough illumination, turn everything off so
we can see that glow-in-the-dark Minecraft

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:13.729
shirt. Gah, what is that glowing bright aura
coming from? Oh, it’s just a completely

00:01:13.729 --> 00:01:17.849
gold plated Xbox One Controller. Always trying
to be the center of attention.

00:01:17.849 --> 00:01:23.439
You’re probably hungry so have A Taco…Titan
Tshirt or for something more substantial try

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:29.329
the Fry Scores Video Game Cookbook with recipes
like Skyrim’s Apple Cabbage Stew or Yeto’s

00:01:29.329 --> 00:01:34.649
Soup from Twilight Princess and write down
how delicious it was in a Leather Bound Legend

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:40.319
of Zelda Triforce journal but if animal hide
isn’t your thing there’s a Chewbacca Fur

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:44.689
Journal. Rip out a page to write a letter
and seal it with a Dragon Age Grey Warden

00:01:44.689 --> 00:01:50.149
ring to create a wax seal. Then brush up on
the latest Oscar Nominated films with these

00:01:50.149 --> 00:02:05.099
awesome video game parody posters….

00:02:05.099 --> 00:02:10.000
Now grab your Limited Edition Mass Effect
Full Scale Geth Pulse Rifle, get into Samus

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.599
Power Armor made entirely out of paper and
start playing Metroid games on a custom NES

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:21.549
arcade. There is even one for the Atari 2600.
For a truly portable console, pocket this

00:02:21.549 --> 00:02:27.480
Pi-Tendo - a tiny NES and SNES emulator built
from a raspberry pi.

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:33.430
Then build yourself up with Mega-Man tshirts
from Insert Coin. And keep building by constructing

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:40.079
a Metal Gear Solid Rex while wearing Metal
Gear Solid clothes from Musterbrand.

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:44.790
Now you might want to put on that Thor Dress
and grab your Super Hero chess pieces as you

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:48.659
select your hero with these great prints by
The Beast is Back...

00:02:48.659 --> 00:03:02.530
Keep yourself warm this winter with a Portal
Engineer Winter Jacket and a Vsauce beanie

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:07.280
that you can get for 50% using code VSAUCE.

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:14.709
Also, my friends and awesome YouTubers Toy
Pizza created a limited edition Vsauce3 action

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:21.900
figure that you can get from their Kickstarter.
You can even get it with a tiny fedora...all

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:28.590
of my dreams are coming true and, as always,
thanks for watching.
