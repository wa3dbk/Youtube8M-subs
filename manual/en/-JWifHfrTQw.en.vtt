00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:03.700
Hi everyone.

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:04.700
I'm Rincey and this is Rincey Reads.

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:08.340
Today I'm going to be doing a review on THE
LIGHT BETWEEN OCEANS by M.L.

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:09.340
Stedman.

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:11.929
This story takes place in 1920s Australia.

00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:16.830
You are following Tom who is a lighthouse
keeper on this island, I believe off the coast

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.390
of Australia.

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.390
And he ends up getting married to this woman
named Isabelle and he brings his wife out

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:23.390
to the island.

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:26.900
And they basically just live their lives almost
completely in isolation.

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:29.690
They live there for almost the entire year.

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:32.520
He has to serve for, I think, like a 3 year
term.

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:35.820
So he basically is there for an entire year,
they get like a month off when they go back

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:36.820
to the mainland.

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:38.240
And they'll go visit Isabelle's parents.

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:40.150
But they're basically by themselves for the
majority of the time.

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:44.980
So you're following this couple and they're
trying to have kids, but the wife keeps having

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:45.980
miscarriages.

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:52.110
And then finally, right when the wife has,
I believe, either her second or third miscarriage,

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:57.980
like a couple days later Tom goes out to check
on things on the island and he finds a boat

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:00.120
that's been washed up on shore.

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:04.199
And he finds a man who is dead, as well as
a baby that's still alive.

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.150
So Tom's job, being a lighthouse keeper, is
to like keep track of everything that happens

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:12.070
on the island and to like report anything
weird or different or any changes that happen.

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:16.560
And so technically he's supposed to report
this finding and like do something about it.

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:20.430
But he brings the baby home and his wife Isabelle
ends up getting really attached to the baby

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:23.439
and somehow convinces Tom to just not report
it.

00:01:23.439 --> 00:01:27.360
So they end up taking in the child and raising
it up as if it was their own child.

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.649
And then, obviously, they end up living on
the island and consequences occur.

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:35.729
[laughs] I won't get into it any more than
that because the rest would probably be considered

00:01:35.729 --> 00:01:36.729
spoilers.

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:38.709
But there are obviously consequences to their
actions.

00:01:38.709 --> 00:01:40.429
This was a really interesting book to read.

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:42.069
I will definitely give it that.

00:01:42.069 --> 00:01:46.979
Like at the very beginning, I think it covers
an interesting period of time and an interesting

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:47.979
place.

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:50.479
Like, at least personally, I don't read a
lot about the 1920s in Australia.

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:54.829
So it was really nice to have that sort of
story being told.

00:01:54.829 --> 00:01:59.509
There is a lot of information given in the
book about that place and about what was happening

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:00.630
in history.

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.560
So you do learn a little bit about Australian
history by reading this book, which I personally

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:06.560
really like.

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:10.599
This is a little bit of a slower novel, so
if you don't like stories that are more like

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:13.340
slow burns, then this is probably not the
book for you.

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:14.860
But, again, I don't mind that.

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.650
I actually really liked it and liked how descriptive
it was.

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:22.579
I think it was well written and I think the
story and the situations that are brought

00:02:22.579 --> 00:02:25.189
up in this book are really engaging.

00:02:25.189 --> 00:02:28.329
But I do have to say that I wasn't completely
in love with this book.

00:02:28.329 --> 00:02:30.730
I had a lot of problems with it, especially
the ending.

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:34.939
If you saw my August wrap up, you saw me like
mention this book really quickly and I said

00:02:34.939 --> 00:02:36.840
that the book felt really "schmoopy".

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:41.400
[laughs] And it's still a word I stand by
even though it's not really a word.

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:45.469
But the problems that I had with this book
were mainly the ones I had with like the last

00:02:45.469 --> 00:02:46.469
third or so.

00:02:46.469 --> 00:02:48.170
I'm not really happy with the way it ended.

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:51.360
It felt like the author made everything just
a little bit too nice.

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:55.319
And I don't want to say too much more than
that because I feel like I'm going to end

00:02:55.319 --> 00:02:57.939
up ruining this book for people and I don't
want to do that.

00:02:57.939 --> 00:03:00.769
So I'm just going to say I found the ending
disappointing.

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:03.650
If you've read the book, you can discuss it
down below, just make sure, you know, mark

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:06.610
it spoilers or whatever because I'd love to
talk about this book with people.

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:09.880
But I just really did not like anything about
the way this book ended.

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:14.370
There's like a big turning point in the story
and you know what it is if you've read it.

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:17.609
As soon as that turning point happened, I
could feel myself getting more and more just

00:03:17.609 --> 00:03:21.069
like disheartened with the book and falling
out of love with the book.

00:03:21.069 --> 00:03:24.140
So by the time the book was over I was just
so like meh about it.

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:27.840
I do think this book is good for book clubs
though because I feel like this is a book

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.280
that has a lot of things that you could potentially
talk about.

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:35.870
There's a lot of, like, morally gray areas
or ways that you can see like multiple sides

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:39.469
of the story so I think this would be a good
book club book because I feel like it would

00:03:39.469 --> 00:03:41.310
bring about a really good discussion.

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:44.739
Like I don't think this is a book that everyone
would love and I don't think it's a book that

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:45.739
everyone would hate.

00:03:45.739 --> 00:03:50.380
I feel like you're going to find throughout
the spectrum because a lot of the stuff that

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:55.209
happens, like, it could have gone multiple
ways and I can see people's feelings falling

00:03:55.209 --> 00:03:56.209
across the board.

00:03:56.209 --> 00:03:59.510
So in the end I gave this book a 3 out of
5 stars and I feel like I can't really recommend

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:04.069
this people unless I really know you really
well because I feel like this is a book that

00:04:04.069 --> 00:04:06.870
you just kind of have to try for yourself
and see if you enjoy it.

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:10.879
If the premise sounds interesting to you,
I would say just give it a try, there's no

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:11.879
harm.

00:04:11.879 --> 00:04:14.609
But I can't necessarily say, like, everyone's
going to love this book or this is a book

00:04:14.609 --> 00:04:15.620
to definitely pick up.

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:18.820
So yeah, those are my quick thoughts on THE
LIGHT BETWEEN OCEANS by M.L.

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:19.820
Stedman.

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:21.360
If you've read this book, again, feel free
to leave your comments down below.

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:23.270
I'd love to talk about this with people who've
read it.

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:26.450
I know there were a couple people who said
that they really loved it, like they commented

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:29.060
while they saw that I was reading it, stuff
like that.

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:31.520
So definitely leave comments down below, I
want to talk about this book with people.

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:33.090
So yeah, that's all I have for now and thanks
for watching.
