00:00:00.569 --> 00:00:02.980
Hello good day, good day!

00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:06.890
Is that your old car Toon?

00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:10.179
Yes, it may be destroyed
-Destroyed? But it's still very beautiful

00:00:10.179 --> 00:00:13.039
Now he can still drive off on it's own.

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:20.039
The exhaust is broken, that's good.

00:00:22.679 --> 00:00:29.679
Can you hear that?

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:53.040
 

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:53.929
 

00:00:53.929 --> 00:00:55.110
 

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:57.980
I understand why it needs to go.

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:01.530
but that we're not going to look at that.

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:07.010
I'm going to try.

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:14.010
Be careful it's not yours.

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:38.370
There was a banana peel.

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:40.680
-fast exhaust I heard that.
Tuned, race exhaust

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.030
 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:43.490
A little dent

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:44.710
That's not so bad.

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:47.750
It won't be the last one.

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:52.330
 

00:01:52.330 --> 00:01:54.220
well it's pretty full.

00:01:54.220 --> 00:01:57.220
2.3, 5 cilinder
- can't crash hard, I saw that.

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:58.200
distribution belt here.

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:04.990
Not much crush-able in front.

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:06.780
I want to try that too.

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:13.780
Looks good on you Thijs, an Audi

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:27.569
Ohh, 5 cylinders.

00:02:28.959 --> 00:02:32.249
 

00:02:32.249 --> 00:02:35.659
Did you see him on the bike?

00:02:35.659 --> 00:02:42.659
Yes, I had to be careful not to run over him.

00:02:45.999 --> 00:02:48.459
He doesn't need a ramp.

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:52.539
Shall I drive forwards? 
-Then he will get over the car.

00:02:52.539 --> 00:02:57.739
 

00:02:57.739 --> 00:02:58.969
 

00:02:58.969 --> 00:03:00.230
Do you do that at home too?

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:01.709
 

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:08.709
 

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:16.489
 

00:03:17.619 --> 00:03:21.139
 

00:03:21.139 --> 00:03:23.439
Do you see that?

00:03:23.439 --> 00:03:25.119
Damn it.

00:03:25.119 --> 00:03:29.259
First customize the inside.

00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:31.349
They bring us a new car and we destroy it  immediately.

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:33.279
 

00:03:33.279 --> 00:03:36.129
Small modifications, that's different from braking it.

00:03:36.129 --> 00:03:38.359
What are all those stickers from Toon?

00:03:38.359 --> 00:03:41.359
Dagan is a company in spain

00:03:41.359 --> 00:03:46.359
They have a lot of cross parts, parts of quads, dirt bikes and stuff like that.

00:03:46.359 --> 00:03:47.549
 

00:03:47.549 --> 00:03:49.349
 

00:03:49.349 --> 00:03:54.399
That company also organizes a lot of freestyle events.

00:03:54.399 --> 00:03:57.549
Also fun to watch those videos. And we want to do that in The Neterlands too.

00:03:57.549 --> 00:04:01.189
So you want to come give a demonstration with dirt bikes?

00:04:01.189 --> 00:04:02.969
If that's possible then yes.

00:04:02.969 --> 00:04:04.429
 

00:04:04.429 --> 00:04:06.339
In the link under this video

00:04:06.339 --> 00:04:08.209
you can see more about Dagan.

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:11.709
Under here in the description.

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:12.590
Nice!

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:17.069
And now? What are we going to do next?

00:04:17.069 --> 00:04:18.820
I think you are going to destroy it.

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:20.830
But i'm always careful with cars, you know that.
