Hey, Robbie Gann, here with Shimano American
Corporation.

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:05.490
I want to talk to you about the brand new
Curado-I.

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:11.390
A couple new key features that we introduced
in this generation, what we wanted to do with

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:13.090
the new reel is give you more, right?

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:17.100
You need to have more options, more performance,
more technology.

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.369
We've done that in three unique ways.

00:00:19.369 --> 00:00:21.470
The first one is our X-ship technology.

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:24.580
X-ship is a bearing supported pinion gear
on both sides.

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:29.980
So, you have . . . you basically have your
pinion gear and you know, from your normal

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:33.899
super free, you have one bearing on one side
supporting that pinion gear.

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.940
By putting another bearing on the other side
now becomes stable.

00:00:36.940 --> 00:00:41.250
So, what that does is when you're turning
the handle, burning a big crank bait or catching

00:00:41.250 --> 00:00:43.320
a lot of fish through an Alabama Rig or whatever.

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.280
That gear is going to be tight in there, so
it's going to give you a longer lasting gear,

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:49.220
more torque and more power.

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:53.179
The next cool feature is our braking technology
which is SVS Infinity.

00:00:53.179 --> 00:00:57.170
You know, we've came out with a variable break
system years ago and it's probably the best

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:59.920
braking system that we've ever done.

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.940
What we wanted to do is make it so where you
can adjust it on the fly.

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:09.750
So, it has here on the side, this little dial
and what this does is it adjusts a cone on

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.770
the inside of the spool here which will make
the reel adjustable.

00:01:14.770 --> 00:01:20.880
So, here's your centrifugal brakes and then
on this side there's this little ring here

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:27.680
and when you adjust it, that ring goes in
and out putting more or less pressure on the

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:28.680
brakes.

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.530
So now, as you're you know, you're burning
the bank or whatever, the conditions change

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:34.630
whatnot, you can adjust this.

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:36.880
So, very cool, SVS Infinity.

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.900
The third cool technology is our S 3-D spool.

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:44.080
It's basically a new construction, how we
manufacture the spool.

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:47.620
What we wanted to do is make it have perfect
balance.

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:49.560
You kind of refer this to a tire on your car.

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.950
When your tire on your car is in balanc, it's
going to last a very long time.

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:56.820
So, we want to have a perfectly balanced spool.

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.040
Vibration equals not good gearing technology,
so we want to eliminate all vibration and

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:02.290
that's S 3-D spool.

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:06.040
So, perfect balanced spool just creates longevity,
great performance.

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:12.030
So, on top of that you get cross carbon drag,
aluminum frame, super free 5 plus 1 bearings,

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.840
comes in right and left hand, 7-2, 6-3, and
a 5.5 gear ratio.

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.390
That's the new Curado-I by Shimano.
