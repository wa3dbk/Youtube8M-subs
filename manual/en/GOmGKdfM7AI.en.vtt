00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:08.629
This video is about knowing when to change
your filter. And that question comes up a

00:00:08.629 --> 00:00:13.750
lot at the WaterFilters.NET hotline. How do
I know when to change my filter? It's the

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:18.900
64,000 dollar question and unfortunately it
doesn't have a super easy answer, but I'm

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:24.450
going try and simplify it for you. You see,
filter life is determined by two variables.

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:30.940
One is how much contaminate is in your water?
This filter is going last a lot longer in

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:36.620
a water supply that has very low sediment
compared to, let's say, a well water that

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:42.730
was just drilled recently that's gushing up
loads of sand and crud. That guy is going

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:47.780
be changing his filter much more frequently
than someone with a low sediment situation.

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:52.000
So the amount of contaminate in the water
is one variable. The other variable is, how

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.110
much water are you actually using? How many
people live in the home? How many restrooms

00:00:57.110 --> 00:01:02.820
are there? How much water is actually going
through this filter cartridge on a daily,

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:08.749
weekly, monthly basis? And that varies from
situation to situation. So, to take the guesswork

00:01:08.749 --> 00:01:16.960
out of it, install liquid filled pressure
gauges before and after each of your filter

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:22.439
housings. This will give you, a before will
give you a baseline number. This is X number

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:28.159
of pressure. Let's say that this inlet side
reads 60. That's a nice inlet pressure. And

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:33.369
going through a sediment cartridge, something
like this, a pleated, non-cellulose polyester

00:01:33.369 --> 00:01:39.120
cartridge, you might see a pressure loss of
2 PSI with a brand new cartridge. That number

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:44.469
will increase. And so you started out at 60,
over here you're 58. Then you come back three

00:01:44.469 --> 00:01:50.481
weeks later and it reads 57. You come back
a month later and it reads 50. And you come

00:01:50.481 --> 00:01:54.060
back a couple more weeks maybe, I mean, who
knows? Its the, you know, we don't know how

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:59.451
long it's going be. But eventually, your pressure
loss will be about 15 to 20 PSI. So it was

00:01:59.451 --> 00:02:04.090
60 over here, you're reading 40 over here,
time to change your cartridge, because at

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:09.070
40 PSI over here, you're probably going get
in the shower some night and go 'Whoa, where

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:14.049
is my water pressure?". That's your clue.
But you can read it on the gauges and know

00:02:14.049 --> 00:02:19.189
ahead of time so that you don't end up in
that situation. These are a must have for

00:02:19.189 --> 00:02:24.209
all filter systems. And, the way these are
installed, there's a male, quarter inch male

00:02:24.209 --> 00:02:27.810
thread here. There's going be a plumbing fitting.
You're going buy that at your local hardware

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:33.349
store. And this is going screw into that before
and after your filter housing. That's the

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:36.700
scientific way to know when you need to change
your cartridges.
