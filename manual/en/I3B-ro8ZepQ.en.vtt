00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:08.260
Hi everybody!

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:10.900
Today, we are going to make

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:13.960
Tofu Pickles dubujangajji

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.600
Have you ever heard about dubujangajji?

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:20.700
Yes. We can make pickles with tofu

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.620
Some of my Canadian, American friends requested

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:28.640
Hey, Maangchi more tofu recipes, more tofu recipes

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.920
They love tofu

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:32.460
It is going to be a good side dish

00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:36.920
and you can keep this in the refrigerator, maybe around two weeks

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:38.820
Ok, let's start

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:50.080
I'm going to use today is 2 packages of tofu

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:52.320
Each package is 40 ounce

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:54.440
So 400g about

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.340
¾ cup soy sauce

00:00:57.980 --> 00:00:59.480
1½ cup water

00:01:01.060 --> 00:01:02.533
⅓ cup vinegar

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:05.140
Apple vinegar I'm using

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:08.880
dried shiitake mushroom

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:17.680
Royal Gala (apple) I'm using to give the sweetness

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:31.580
We are going to boil this

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:38.020
Slice thinly

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.560
Tofu and onion pickle together is really crispy and more tasty

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:48.620
You see, it's really boiling now so I'm going to turn down

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:50.100
over low heat

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:52.140
Let's open this tofu

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:58.800
and pour out the water

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:04.460
I like to rince once

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:09.240
on the paper towel, put it here

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:17.180
So first, cut this in half

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:18.860
see

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:20.920
this guy also

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:24.260
and this

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:25.760
⅓

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:27.120
like this

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:38.600
This one is like ¼

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:54.340
So 24 pieces, 24 pieces, so 48 pieces of tofu

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:57.380
We are going to pan-fry these tofu pieces

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:06.300
So, pan is heated

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:09.680
and add some cooking oil

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:36.000
So turn it over, so every side is golden brown

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:01.400
With a spatula and one little spoon, and then just turn it over, turn it over

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:01.960
and fun!

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:09.460
So when it's cooked

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:12.880
transfer here

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:19.340
so one package of tofu is done

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:21.520
this tofus I'm going to pan-fry

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:31.460
same method

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:39.420
*sizzles*

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:42.420
*sizzles dramatically*

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:50.060
So this brine is done. Actually, really sizzling, low low heat, 30 minutes i boiled it

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:53.760
so now, ready, I'm going to turn off the heat!

00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:03.000
Same way, cook this, all sides is golden brown

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:07.620
A little bit crispy, but inside it should be soft

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:17.620
While this is cooking, I'm going to put this tofu into this glass container.

00:05:32.380 --> 00:05:34.540
Ok, I'm going to turn off the heat

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:36.420
done!

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:49.800
Do you remember this sliced onion?

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:58.300
So brine is still warm, pour this into this

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:03.540
so mushroom is very tasty

00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:07.500
it looks like a button, right?

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:32.000
This more sauce, brine here

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:35.400
leftover

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:43.540
So, this in container, let it cool down and then close the lid and keep this in the refigerator

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:46.080
Today I'm going to taste this one

00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:53.520
And when you serve this, always with rice or noodle, bland rice because the little salty side dish

00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:56.300
looks like a little bit spongy, like elastic

00:06:56.940 --> 00:06:58.720
look at that, inside

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:00.700
This brine is very tasty

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:01.800
mmh

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:07.920
So I'm going to add a little piece of onion

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:13.760
mmh

00:07:16.740 --> 00:07:17.860
really delicious

00:07:17.860 --> 00:07:20.220
shiitake mushroom, tastes like meat

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:23.700
perfect vegetarian side dish

00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:24.760
mmmh!

00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:27.160
really good

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.180
If I love it, you will love it too

00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:35.380
Today we made dubujangajji, tofu pickles.

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:36.760
Enjoy my recipe

00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:40.000
See you next time. Bye! :)
