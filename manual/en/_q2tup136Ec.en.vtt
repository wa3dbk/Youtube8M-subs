00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:12.380
Hey guys, it’s Ro!

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:14.500
Welcome to another Nerdy Nummies.

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:18.810
Today we are gonna be making a science themed
cake, we’re gonna be making a

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:22.770
Beaker Cake. I got a lot of requests to do
something like this, so I’m really

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:28.369
excited! It’s gonna get a little weird,
so let’s get weird with it!

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:30.230
Let’s get started!

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:37.190
The things you will need, will be: Kabob sticks,
a bunch of Rice Krispies treats, you

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:42.230
can bake your own from scratch, or I’ve
bought these ones pre-made from Kellogs.

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:46.790
A little bowl, this is a glass bowl because
you can put it in the oven, it’s

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:52.900
bake-able. And this is 1 quart or, uh, 950 milliliters,
so this is the size,

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:57.960
it’s pretty small. About dat big! A-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:02.670
And then you’re gonna need 3 eggs, I’m
using a box cake, you can use a pound cake

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:05.990
or whatever cake you’d like, but I really
like this cake because it holds shape

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:10.640
very well. A cup of water and 1/2 a sh-tick
of butter.

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:12.619
Let’s put it all together.

00:01:12.619 --> 00:01:16.749
I’m gonna be using my kitchenmaid to mix
all of these things up, but if you don’t

00:01:16.749 --> 00:01:21.770
have a stand mixer, you can just use an electric
hand mixer or a whisk.

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:24.090
You’ll just have to mix it around a lot!

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:29.359
Alright, so the 1st thing I’m gonna do is pour
the cake mix, from the box cake,

00:01:29.359 --> 00:01:36.359
into the bowl. And then I’m gonna add my
1/2 a stick of butter, and you’re gonna

00:01:36.399 --> 00:01:40.039
add 1 cup of water… Bewp!

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:42.900
And our eggs.

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:48.500
A-boom! Now you’re gonna mix it all up until
it’s well combined.

00:01:48.509 --> 00:01:50.959
Is it locked? Yeah, locked an loaded!

00:01:50.959 --> 00:01:53.459
OH! Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.139
Mix it on a low speed and then a high speed!

00:01:58.139 --> 00:02:03.459
Now we’re gonna take our little bowl, and
I’m gonna take the leftover butter, and

00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:07.520
I’m just gonna smooth it around, all around
the bowl to grease the bowl,

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.330
so that this cake will pop out really easy.

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:15.069
Now you’re gonna pour about 1/2 of your
batter into the bowl, it doesn’t have to

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:18.480
be exact, it will rise a lot when it’s baking.

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.220
And we’re gonna bake 2 cakes, we’re gonna
bake 2 of these, so save

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:23.970
the other 1/2 of your batter.

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:29.040
Da-dew! There you have it, and now you’re
gonna heat your oven to 330, and we are

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.090
gonna slow bake it, the reason I do this is
because it’s a very dense cake,

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:37.230
so you don’t want it to burn. So you just
set it to 330, and then you bake it for

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:42.340
about 28 minutes. But just keep your eye on
it, and you can use a toothpick to poke

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:45.909
it in and out of the cake, to see if its ready.

00:02:45.909 --> 00:02:49.610
Once both of your cakes are done baking, you’re
gonna remove them from the oven

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:54.790
and allow them plenty of time to cool, because
if you do this while they’re still warm

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:56.180
they’re gonna fall apart.

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:59.450
And now we are gonna shape them to look like
a science beaker.

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:04.280
Look at these, they just… They, they baked…
Perfectly!

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:06.140
A-dig-uh-dig-uh-dig-uh-dig-ug-dig-uh!

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:10.140
So what I’ve got are 2 cardboard cake rounds
and I’ve just stacked them

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:15.540
to be the height that I’ll need, and I used
a cake leveler set on the lowest setting.

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:20.219
And then I’m just gonna walk it through
the cake so that my cake will by lying flat.

00:03:20.219 --> 00:03:22.890
And now we’re gonna do the same thing to
the other cake.

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:28.460
Now that we have our 2 cake halves all leveled,
we are just gonna stack them.

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:34.280
So I’m gonna put down the 1st one,
and then I’m gonna take my must-patula,

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:39.590
and spread a little bit of buttercream frosting
in between, and then I’m gonna

00:03:39.590 --> 00:03:42.180
stick on the top of the cake.

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:42.780
Boom!

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:47.180
Bottom of the beaker all done, now it’s
time to make the top.

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:52.450
Now we are gonna make the neck of our beaker,
you’re gonna need 5 of these Rice

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:57.999
Krispies Treats, and what we’re gonna do
is open all of them up and sculpt our neck.

00:03:57.999 --> 00:04:04.439
Now I’m gonna stack them, I’m gonna stack
them 2 and 2, and then stick these together.

00:04:04.439 --> 00:04:08.040
Rice Krispies are really, really sticky, and
I saw this on Cake Boss, where they

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:11.999
mold things out of Rice Krispies, and it is
totally possible.

00:04:11.999 --> 00:04:15.379
So what you’re gonna do is press them together,
to get them to stick.

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:20.239
And you’re just gonna keep doing this, working
it with your hands, until these little

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:21.880
Rice Krispies look like a tube.

00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:26.840
Boom! It’s done, OK I’m just gonna stick
this right here, and now I’m gonna take the

00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:32.580
5th Rice Krispie and I’m gonna roll it really,
really thin, to make the beaker lip.

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:35.820
Wee-wee-wee-wee-wee-wee-wee-wee-wee-wee-wee!

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:40.900
You’re just gonna wrap this around the top,
oh this is so funny!

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:44.980
This molds really, really well, I’m really
impressed!

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:48.570
Now we are gonna stabilize our beaker using
a kabob stick.

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:52.150
So I’ve just taken 1 of the sticks, and
I’m gonna put it in here first.

00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:56.250
I’m gonna use the pointy end, and we’re
gonna put it up…

00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:59.000
To the neck.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.750
Now it is time to frost!

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:06.070
I took a lot of Vanilla buttercream frosting,
I put it into a plastic bag,

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:10.450
and I’m just gonna take a little scissors,
snip the tip, and now we are gonna

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:14.660
frost this entire beaker cake. I put it on
a cake tray so that I could spin it around

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:16.780
making it a little bit more easy.

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:19.590
This is a really easy cake, I would say that
it’s easy mode.

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:24.000
We’re not doing any fondant, and you’re
just gonna take your must-patula, and

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.380
spread the white frosting on as evenly as
you can.

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:30.780
But if it’s not perfect, who cares! It’s
Science!

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:34.280
Well actually science is pretty... Accurate…

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:38.360
A really good tip for the frosting is once
you’ve got it laid over your whole cake

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:43.590
I put it in the freezer for 10 minutes to
chill. And then I ran the spatula all the

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:47.510
way around it again. And it got really smooth,
look at that!

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:50.120
Schmooooooth!

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:54.500
Now we’re gonna take the blue buttercream
frosting, I’ve dyed it blue with a few

00:05:54.500 --> 00:06:00.700
drops of sky blue food coloring dye. I put
it in a plastic bag with a number 5 tip

00:06:00.700 --> 00:06:03.380
at the end, and we’re going to decorate
our beaker!

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:11.310
Now I’m just gonna take this extra white
frosting I put it in a plastic baggie with

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:16.220
a number 2 tip, and I’m just going to decorate
the side of the beaker with the

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:20.000
milliliter measurements, starting with 50
and ending with 200.

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:22.740
Ta-da!

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:27.880
Here is our science beaker cake, it is so
cute, thanks you guys for suggesting it.

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:32.470
I have never made with Rice Krispies, molded
a cake before, this was my first

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:35.070
time and it was really easy! I loved it!

00:06:35.070 --> 00:06:39.560
