00:00:10.088 --> 00:00:15.940
Doctored Locks brand tape hair extensions are made 
 with a super strong, high quality adhesive

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:17.969
and amazing quality hair.

00:00:18.417 --> 00:00:19.971
Let's take a look at how they're installed.

00:00:20.263 --> 00:00:22.218
First thing, we're going to part the hair.

00:00:26.392 --> 00:00:28.818
So this is where our tape hair will be positioned.

00:00:32.927 --> 00:00:35.743
Next, we're going to pick up a small

00:00:36.358 --> 00:00:38.711
piece of the natural hair.

00:00:39.333 --> 00:00:43.486
This is the hair that the tape hair is going to be situated on.

00:00:43.832 --> 00:00:46.385
So it's a very thin parting.

00:00:51.523 --> 00:00:53.578
Next, we're going to take our tape hair,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.722
peel away the tape backing.

00:01:01.917 --> 00:01:06.437
I'm going to hold this hair up and I'm 
 going to position my tape hair underneath it.

00:01:07.308 --> 00:01:08.332
Kind of press it up

00:01:08.667 --> 00:01:09.902
and then down.

00:01:11.155 --> 00:01:14.926
And the reason I'm doing that is I'm just getting 
 it as close to the scalp as possible.

00:01:16.667 --> 00:01:20.432
And then I'm going to lay it down so 
 that it's going in the right direction.

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:25.447
The next thing is to take my second piece of tape hair,

00:01:25.917 --> 00:01:27.335
remove the backing on it,

00:01:28.583 --> 00:01:31.570
and then I'm going to place that right on top of the other one.

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:38.665
I'm going to press them together

00:01:39.002 --> 00:01:40.160
and it's as simple as that.

00:01:40.415 --> 00:01:41.980
Now our tape hair is installed.

00:01:42.333 --> 00:01:45.810
This completes your first piece of tape hair extensions,

00:01:46.099 --> 00:01:49.580
continue working until you've completed your entire installation.
