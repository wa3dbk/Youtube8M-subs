00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:08.469
Hello everyone! Today we make the sponge cake. Someone will tell

00:00:08.469 --> 00:00:15.320
the video was already did a lot of years ago. But I did not know

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:17.220
I could non put the jingle, because of copyright

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.800
I did not know

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:24.919
and in some countries the video was blocked, or removed sound, so many complaints about

00:00:24.919 --> 00:00:29.109
I don't see, don't hear, I don't hear the sound or music is too loud

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:30.869
I don't hear what you say

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:34.680
so I thought directly to do it again the sponge cake

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:37.920
and I make the video of sponge cake

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.890
the dose for this sponge cake, is for a rectangular baking pan

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:46.070
in the infobox, I put the steps to make the sponge cake

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:52.270
in 24-26-28 cm round pans, then if you need to know the doses

00:00:52.270 --> 00:00:56.080
your baking pans in particular, just ask  and you will find in the infobox

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:57.150
directions

00:00:57.150 --> 00:01:01.100
and now we're going to mess. now I'll only because my little girl

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.890
she can't say hello, becouse she's voicelles

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:06.900
can you make them hear your voice?

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:12.080
here is the maximum voice that can come out of her little mouth

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.820
so I will be alone to make the video

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:17.320
see you later

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:20.200
and here we are to mess for make the sponge cake

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:22.220
for this recipe

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:24.080
or better, for this baking pan

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:31.300
which is 24X34 cm, it takes 11 eggs, 330 grams of flour, 330 grams of sugar

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:37.120
we start putting the planet as usual, eggs

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:46.940
pinch of salt

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:50.040
before adding sugar

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:57.049
we break the yolks

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.600
Now, that the yolks are broken, eggs

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.160
put the sugar

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:11.459
and let mount until

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:16.069
write the compound, then I'll show you how is

00:02:16.069 --> 00:02:17.819
see you later

00:02:17.819 --> 00:02:20.619
as you can see and well mounted

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:27.620
we did mount a lot

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:36.820
we remove this

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:42.120
this is what I intend for write

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.140
practically

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.120
 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.379
what falls must not

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:55.239
collapse

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:57.440
now

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.440
this thanks to the planetary movement

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:08.169
what does incorporate

00:03:08.169 --> 00:03:10.719
air to eggs

00:03:10.719 --> 00:03:13.529
and must not add

00:03:13.529 --> 00:03:15.839
and must not add baking powder

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:20.260
meanwhile we turn on the oven at 170/180Â°C

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:25.619
saw that the eggs are many, we must be careful

00:03:25.619 --> 00:03:28.239
That the flour is well blended

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:30.109
we start adding flour

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:33.280
always a little at a time

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:50.360
with a more delicate possible movement from the bottom upwards

00:03:54.999 --> 00:03:58.879
going down also in low

00:03:58.879 --> 00:04:03.059
because being much flour tends to go down

00:04:03.059 --> 00:04:05.549
and you can't take it

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:08.619
and stir well, otherwise you find the flour

00:04:08.620 --> 00:04:09.860
asunder

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:26.440
we add always

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:29.380
little by little the flour

00:04:31.660 --> 00:04:35.340
always from the top downwards movement

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:40.520
So that the eggs are not disassemble

00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:45.819
will you not do so, because it disassemble the eggs and then is not good

00:04:45.819 --> 00:04:47.449
for those ask me

00:04:47.449 --> 00:04:49.650
Can I do it with the Mixer hand?

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:53.029
yes, of course

00:04:53.029 --> 00:04:58.279
but put in mind that you must mixing at least 20 minutes

00:04:58.279 --> 00:05:01.249
or even more, dependent on the amount of eggs

00:05:01.249 --> 00:05:02.760
to mount

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:10.200
always with the planetary movement so that when you go with the whisk

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:13.660
always going to shoot well to mount the eggs

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:18.460
when you think you are well mixed, pours

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:27.760
I try to go all the way

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:29.520
there are parts of flour

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:35.280
you stop with that finger ;)

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:49.240
and now

00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:51.240
pour

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:55.460
in the pan

00:05:55.460 --> 00:06:00.199
I remind you this is a pan 24 to 34 cm

00:06:00.199 --> 00:06:01.830
stay stillllll

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:03.439
oh God

00:06:03.439 --> 00:06:08.129
bake at 180 degrees for the cooking time, because each different oven

00:06:08.129 --> 00:06:11.860
then we check with a toothpick that comes out clean

00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:13.040
see you later

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:19.920
here we are, we pulled out the sponge cake that is already cooked, it has detached itself from the walls

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:23.300
we did the test with a toothpick to see if it be cooked

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:25.160
and now Silvia will show you

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:26.260
as you turn

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:28.140
and it pulls out

00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:29.860
a pan without hinges

00:06:31.540 --> 00:06:33.200
and voicelles

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:37.800
ok

00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:46.680
and here is the sponge cake

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:48.770
pulled out of

00:06:48.770 --> 00:06:49.640
from the pan

00:06:49.659 --> 00:06:52.849
And now we have to turn it over the grid

00:06:52.849 --> 00:06:57.279
and this is the grill of the oven, which we cleaned and cooled, beacuse otherwise,

00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:58.340
it would warm

00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:01.820
cooled, and now we put the sponge cake to cool

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:06.068
do

00:07:06.068 --> 00:07:11.300
now

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:15.100
so we keep it to cool for half a day, at least

00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:17.020
see you later

00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:18.860
