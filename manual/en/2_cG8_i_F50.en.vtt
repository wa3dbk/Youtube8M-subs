Hi I'm David Kaynor for expertvillage.com.
I'm in the midst of a discussion of changing

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:14.820
the strings on a violin, and I would like
to direct some attention to the very important

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:25.700
process of checking and maintaining the proper
bridge orientation. And then I'm going to

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:33.250
actually show how I change a bridge. That
was a significant, pulled it significantly

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:40.771
forward toward the end of fingerboard. The
sort of standard user-friendly way to do this

00:00:40.771 --> 00:00:47.570
is to put the fiddle between the knees. It
is reasonably secure as long as you got any

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:59.950
kind of abductor muscles in your legs, and
then what I tend to do is put my thumbs on

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:05.210
the side of the bridge closest to me, and
then I put my second fingers opposite my thumbs,

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:10.900
and I put my first fingers roughly opposite
my thumbs; and see how my first fingers are

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:19.799
between the E and the A and between the G
and the D. Now I have a relatively controllable

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:29.030
grip on the bridge. Now what I will do is
very, very slowly ease the bridge back a little

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:38.360
bit. How much? I can't tell unless I, once
again, eyeball the bridge. In my opinion,

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:45.460
that is still leaning a little bit forward.
So I'm going to repeat the process, and I'm

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:50.409
going to probably do this two more times,
and I know that it could be boring to watch

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:58.909
me to do this, but maybe one more time. The
idea being that these movements are best done

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:05.810
in modest amounts, rather then just trying
to pull the bridge back all at once, which

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:13.510
could break it. I'm going to call that good.
So we can say that the A string, with a little

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:41.659
bit of stretching, is going to be hopefully...
I'm tuning the A to the E cause that is a

00:02:41.659 --> 00:02:48.310
old string and it is not stretching anymore.
These strings are new and they are continuing

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:57.389
to stretch. But the A string is now installed
at least, and I can adjust its pitch a little

00:02:57.389 --> 00:02:57.780
bit later.
