00:00:00.885 --> 00:00:03.885
( upbeat pop music)

00:00:14.936 --> 00:00:17.519
(wind blowing)

00:00:27.651 --> 00:00:31.568
- This is me, demonstrating
my first solo dive.

00:00:37.163 --> 00:00:39.996
(Ginger laughing)

00:00:45.953 --> 00:00:47.143
(people chattering)

00:00:47.143 --> 00:00:49.597
Fun, we're just getting ready to register,

00:00:49.597 --> 00:00:52.607
and I guess get our jumpsuits.

00:00:52.607 --> 00:00:53.535
Are you nervous yet?

00:00:53.535 --> 00:00:54.485
- No.

00:00:54.485 --> 00:00:55.791
- I'm not either.

00:00:55.791 --> 00:00:56.717
I'm just excited.
- I'm kinda sitting here

00:00:56.717 --> 00:00:58.228
thinking if they're
packing their own pack,

00:00:58.228 --> 00:01:00.292
their life's hanging on those lines too,

00:01:00.292 --> 00:01:01.648
so they're probably doing a good job.

00:01:01.648 --> 00:01:03.234
- [Woman] Yeah, that's
what I'm thinking too.

00:01:03.234 --> 00:01:04.891
- You gonna wear a jumpsuit?

00:01:04.891 --> 00:01:06.328
- [ Woman] You have to.
- I hear they let you fly in

00:01:06.328 --> 00:01:07.685
whatever you have on.

00:01:07.685 --> 00:01:08.518
(background noise drowns out speaker)

00:01:08.518 --> 00:01:09.439
- [Woman] Really?

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:11.314
- [Woman] Danger.

00:01:11.314 --> 00:01:13.243
How do you feel about that?

00:01:13.243 --> 00:01:14.221
- Like alive.

00:01:14.221 --> 00:01:15.196
(woman laughs)

00:01:15.196 --> 00:01:16.854
I pretty much feel alive.

00:01:16.854 --> 00:01:18.217
- [Woman] For now, right?

00:01:18.217 --> 00:01:21.615
- Actually, yeah (laughs).

00:01:21.615 --> 00:01:22.448
Yeah.

00:01:22.448 --> 00:01:24.377
- I can be a organ donor
- [Man] Nice

00:01:24.377 --> 00:01:25.886
with my eyeball corneas.

00:01:25.886 --> 00:01:27.198
- [Man] Oh yeah, if that's
about all you got (laughs).

00:01:27.198 --> 00:01:28.031
- Flossing your brain.

00:01:28.031 --> 00:01:29.848
Flossing your brain (laughs).
- Flossing your brain.

00:01:29.848 --> 00:01:30.770
No, that's what they said.

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:31.620
Flossing your brain.

00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:32.755
Flossing your brain.

00:01:32.755 --> 00:01:34.147
- Hold your hands out like

00:01:34.147 --> 00:01:34.980
you're flossing your brain.
- Elbows up,

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:35.813
flossing your brain.

00:01:35.813 --> 00:01:37.081

00:02:08.364 --> 00:02:10.489
(plane engine roaring)

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:12.992
- [Man] (background noise
drowning out speaker)

00:02:12.992 --> 00:02:14.150
We didn't die!

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:14.983
Woohoo!

00:02:16.925 --> 00:02:17.830

feet halfway, how ya feelin'?

00:02:24.804 --> 00:02:26.528

00:02:26.528 --> 00:02:27.361
(everyone laughs)

00:02:27.361 --> 00:02:28.965
- [Man] You're having a hard
time forming a sentence.

00:02:28.965 --> 00:02:30.359
Are you sure you're okay?

00:02:30.359 --> 00:02:31.524
