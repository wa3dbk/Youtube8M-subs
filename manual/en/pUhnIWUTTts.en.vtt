Hey, it's Sean McCabe with seanwes tv. I'm
going to give you the best advice you'll ever

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:13.639
hear. The problem is, it's not the kind of
feel-good advice that you want to retweet

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:18.680
or frame on your wall. Or is it? It's the
kind of advice that people need to hear, but

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:25.460
it's no easy thing to do. And that is: show
up every day for two years. 

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:27.260
That's the golden answer right there.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:33.780
It will make you money, it will build an audience,
it will solve most of your problems, it will establish

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:38.690
you as an authority in your industry, it will
develop the tenacity needed to survive in

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:43.810
this world, and it will teach you that those
who are successful aren't successful because

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:48.440
of some condensed version of their story they
gave on a podcast interview, but because they

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:53.880
made a commitment to show up every single
day—even when it was hard, even when it

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:59.800
sucked, and even when they thought nothing would
ever come of it. But no one will ever hear this

00:00:59.809 --> 00:01:05.589
advice. That's because, "Show up every day
for two years," isn't microwaveable. 

00:01:05.589 --> 00:01:10.969
It's the only advice you ever need. Every other
bit of advice is just a different packaging

00:01:10.969 --> 00:01:13.249
that's more easily stomached.

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:18.320
Do you want to get ahead of people? Do you
want to get ahead of everyone else out there?

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:22.859
That's all you need. That's the only advice
you need. If you can take that to heart—if

00:01:22.859 --> 00:01:27.539
you can internalize that—you will win.

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.380
I did some lettering last night and I'm going
to get screen prints made of this design.

00:01:31.389 --> 00:01:35.020
I'm going to get prints just for me. I'm going
to get prints of it just so I can put this

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:39.820
up on my wall as a reminder to myself: that's
why I'm going to win.

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:43.640
I want to hear from you. Let me know in the
comments—leave a comment—I want to know

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:50.219
if you think you have what it takes to show
up consistently no matter what—no matter

00:01:50.219 --> 00:01:54.099
how hard it gets. Let me know if you want
one of these prints.
