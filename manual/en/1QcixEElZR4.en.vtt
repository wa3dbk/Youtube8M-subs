00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:05.330
Hey there vegies, welcome to my review of The Secret World by Funcom so the secret world is an mmo-

00:00:05.330 --> 00:00:06.120
RPG

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:11.380
set in modern times and released July
2012 originally was based around

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:12.340
subscription model

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:15.420
akin to the world of warcraft however this
quickly dropped

00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:18.980
and the game now use the buy to play model
with an optional subscription new

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:20.880
content is released as mini expansions

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.949
called issues, which you can buy from the ingame cash shop the difficulty level of the secret world

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.269
is higher than most mainstream mmorpgs

00:00:28.269 --> 00:00:32.160
it doesn't really cater to the casual crowd
well not as much as others

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:38.730
And that can put off people who are new to the genre the game is set in various places around the

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:39.129
world

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:43.600
there are three main playable factions
and other non playable ones scattered around for

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:44.230
missions and

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:47.739
storyline content the three main factions
are the illuminati

00:00:47.739 --> 00:00:53.030
the templars and the Dragons choosing one of these factions decides which side

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:53.670
you can fight on

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.750
when you PVP and which cabals you can join which is the in
game name for guilds

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.320
you are however able to group up and chat
with whoever you like

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.630
the secret world has a fairly decent character creation system

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:09.790
there is only one race available as everyone is human. Armour is based on

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:13.500
trinkets which you cant see when you equip them, the way you look is purely

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:14.200
cosmetic

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.380
and it's completely up to you get
clothing from missions

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:21.070
from achievements and the in game shops and
also from the real-life

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:26.320
cash shops. When running through the main hubs, its not common to see two people who look alike

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:27.229
customization and 

00:01:27.229 --> 00:01:30.400
some of it looks really good and some of it, well you can make a really

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:33.509
hideous looking character or you can make a really nice looking character.

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:37.200
for classes the game has its own unique take

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.630
rather than forcing you into stereotypical roles
such the tank healer or DPS

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:44.409
which it does have by the way you're free to fill out your skills as you see fit, there are separate

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:46.191
points for which abilities you can use

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.680
and seperate points for which gear your can equip

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:53.740
eventually its possible for your character to max out both trees and have access to every ability ingame.

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.570
as with other MMORPGS the secret world has a guild system

00:01:57.570 --> 00:02:01.179
affectionately they are called cabals they
allow people from the same faction to

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:02.899
to join up and work towards similar goals

00:02:02.899 --> 00:02:06.429
there are also some multifaction cabals using custom chat channels and voice

00:02:06.429 --> 00:02:07.149
communication

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:11.600
to allow multiple factions to join in on the fun. During my time playing the secret world

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.720
ive met quite a few different people for the
most part I've always been willing to

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.940
answer even the most basic questions and
give advice and builds and mission

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:18.580
information

00:02:18.580 --> 00:02:22.540
although I don't know for sure it seems
the more mature

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.930
nature of the game has led to a more mature player base don't get me wrong though

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:27.630
there are still trolls and the usual bad eggs in there. 

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:31.260
Most of the main quests and sidequests can be completed as a group

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:35.920
and you feel for the most part grouping is encoraged. There are however some moments in game

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.400
where it forces you into a single player scenario

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:41.820
they dont tent to take too long however, but it can be a bit of a drag

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:45.950
as it splits your hardworking group into individuals for just one mission

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:47.319
graphicly the game is very good looking

00:02:47.319 --> 00:02:50.609
and pretty well while it might not be the most realistic of games

00:02:50.609 --> 00:02:53.840
it has great art and sound design, there are moments where you can just gawp at the

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:57.849
landscape looking at the vistas that it gives you and getting with the theme

00:02:57.849 --> 00:03:01.489
there are plenty of places which just creep you the hell out. Abandoned theme park anyone?

00:03:01.489 --> 00:03:06.230
putting all the praise aside the secret world  does suffer from a number frequent

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:07.090
graphical glitches

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:10.129
no matter what kind of machine I played it on. Dont get me wrong

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:14.480
none of these are game breaking, but they do ruin the immersion somewhat. A few examples would be

00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:14.870
be

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:18.659
when you unholster your gun it remains at your side

00:03:18.659 --> 00:03:21.680
meaning your either shooting finger bullets or the more common you end up with 2 guns

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:25.639
wearing certain combinations of clothes causes skin textures not to show

00:03:25.639 --> 00:03:28.859
turning you into a sort of futuristic rayman

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:31.949
wearing some combinations of dresses causes your character to seem to be wearing no

00:03:31.949 --> 00:03:32.459
underwear

00:03:32.459 --> 00:03:37.689
Dont ask me how I tested that, im not proud. In Short it looks good

00:03:37.689 --> 00:03:41.129
but it does have some graphical glitches
none of them are game killers though

00:03:41.129 --> 00:03:45.370
and then onto the content, so the main bit of content is missions

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:50.019
missions are.... missions are different the
usual kill

00:03:50.019 --> 00:03:54.379
this many things and bring me this thing
there are also some genuine puzzles

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:57.859
and there are quite a few missions that
require you to go out the game

00:03:57.859 --> 00:04:01.120
load up your web browser actually look up
historical information

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:06.730
although at this stage in its life cycle
going out of game tends to be

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:09.209
go on to crygaia.com for a walkthrough

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:14.500
and then follow it, typing in the name of the missions tends to bring up straight away a walkthrough

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:19.660
which is a bit of a killer but you can see what they were aiming for. The missions are quire enjoyable

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:24.120
some are hard some are easy some are short some are long. A few examples of some I really enjoyed are

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:28.300
exploring a haunted themepark and defending the scrapyard. A mission which sticks out in my 

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:28.710
mind

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:32.090
is a mission which required me to walk miles while being hunted by a ghost

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:35.350
with tons of health and a very annoying slow down debuff so

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:39.240
as I was running along it would spawn up, slow me down

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:44.480
and i would have to kill it and it took ages for very little reward

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:46.780
Happily though I havent come across too many like that

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:51.560
Progression, progression in the secret world is a little different to other games

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:55.000
the staples are there complete missions kill monsters for exp

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.000
However you do not have a set level

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:02.140
With your xp you get ability points and skill points the first can be used to buy abilities

00:05:02.140 --> 00:05:05.420
a second can be used to increase the tier of gear that you can use

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:08.460
start off a little slow but as you get further into the game

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:11.470
the points get easier to farm as the areas you have visited become a cake walk

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:15.990
which leads me to another thing, should you find yourself falling behind and the missions getting on top of you

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:18.990
it is possible to repeat most missions after a set time limit

00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:22.780
you can go back and get all the exp rewards over again to catch up

00:05:22.780 --> 00:05:26.310
Ok some missions you probably wouldnt touch with again with somone elses let alone yours

00:05:26.310 --> 00:05:31.600
but some of them are genuinly fun you will want to do them again regardless gear can be found as drops from 

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:32.170
monsters

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:35.680
as rewards for missions and it can be
crafted. Theres no skilling up for

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:36.220
crafting

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:40.740
other than finding the correct tier resources for the item you want to create the crafting uses

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:43.760
minecraft esk style where you have to draw out the patters

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:46.960
the items you want, its a good job there is an ingame web browser to look them up

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:50.700
So whats in the end game? This is where my knowledge lets me down

00:05:50.700 --> 00:05:55.420
the reason being I'm not there yet as
you can see from my Steam account I put

00:05:55.420 --> 00:05:56.790
ninty seven hours into this game

00:05:56.790 --> 00:06:01.110
which is a fair amount however im not at the end yet, i do know the game features raids

00:06:01.110 --> 00:06:04.760
most of the dungeons maybe all of them, can be completed on elite and nightmare modes

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:06.530
for better loot and added difficulty

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:10.000
there are also some PVP modes to play with. Is the PVP good?

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.890
I have no idea, but when I looked there were people playing it, so either they are mental or

00:06:13.890 --> 00:06:17.410
there is some kind of value in it

00:06:17.410 --> 00:06:21.670
lastly the cash shop as I said before the secret world features a cash shop

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:25.630
It sells all kinda good from pets to skins to clothes to boost potions and they sell some starter gear and endgame weapons

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:29.640
nothing on there is best in slot

00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:34.890
but you cant argue that its 100% not pay to win its unlikley that subscribing or buying a few

00:06:34.890 --> 00:06:37.530
quality level 10 items on a the cash shop is gonna
make your Superman

00:06:37.530 --> 00:06:42.320
but they would definitely help on gearing up or skilling up

00:06:42.320 --> 00:06:44.660
its pay for a speed boost or pay to advance faster

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:48.670
Personally Im happy with the cash shop, the prices are reasonable, and anyone who subscribes gets

00:06:48.670 --> 00:06:50.420
1200 bonus coins a month

00:06:50.420 --> 00:06:53.940
which is more than enough to pay for the latest expansion content when it comes out

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:57.680
or whatever fancy clothes you like

00:06:57.680 --> 00:07:01.090
Is the secret world good? Is it worth paying for and putting the

00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:02.310
time into

00:07:02.310 --> 00:07:07.120
I would argue yes Ive had alot of fun with the secret world and although theres been times when ive struggled

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:10.480
ive had the support of a good cabal to get me by and with a little perseverance 

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:14.020
I feel like I've been getting somwhere
ive even been able to help other people

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:17.130
which is a great feeling. The graphics are nice the client runs

00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:21.640
stable runs well on toasters the grind
is reasonably enjoyable

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:24.970
it can be up from twenty-five on steam a little bit cheaper if you

00:07:24.970 --> 00:07:30.710
shop around it's not a bad price and also you dont need to subscribe. Like I said  theres a

00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:32.010
subscription available

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:35.970
with additional perks but they're not required. Thank you for watching my review

00:07:35.970 --> 00:07:37.610
and thank you for sticking around until the end

00:07:37.610 --> 00:07:41.600
if you liked it please subscribe and
I'll try and make some others also comment on what you dont

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:42.650
like or what you do like

00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:46.110
and maybe even comment on what you think to the secret world and weather im

00:07:46.110 --> 00:07:48.630
talking absolute rubbish thanks again
