00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:01.480
Ughhhhh

00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:03.360
Good morning Hank, it's Tuesday.

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.720
I had all kinds of plans for today's video but instead it's going to be about tiny chickens

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:09.540
because I've been invaded.

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.260
Ughhhhhh

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:14.060
Quick sidenote for nerdfighters-in-training:

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:18.260
Tiny Chicken Disease is, of course, a disease in which tiny chickens invade your nose

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:19.120
and then they

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:19.720
poop

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:20.440
snot

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:21.900
which makes you sick.

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:23.140
Right, Hank so over the weekend,

00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:24.180
the Yeti got Tiny Chicken Disease

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:24.900
and I was like,

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:27.080
"Don't worry! I'm immune to Yeti diseases."

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:28.280
Well I'm not!

00:00:28.280 --> 00:00:29.920
Hank, I don't want to gross you out or anything,

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:31.160
but last night,

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.540
I drank like 14 liquid tons of snot.

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.720
It was like chinese water torture,

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:38.780
except instead of water dripping onto my forehead,

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:40.000
it was just snot

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.440
dripping down my throat,

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:42.480
all night.

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.460
And I didn't sleep and now I'm walking around with like

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.040
28 000 pounds of chicken poop in my body.

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:48.240
It's just not comfortable.

00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:51.720
The weirdest thing about tiny chickens is that you become--

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:52.580
[phone ringing]

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:53.580
Sarah.

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:54.980
Yeah?

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:56.500
What's up?

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:58.420
[Sarah]: Don't forget to vote!

00:00:58.420 --> 00:00:59.220
Ohhhhhh

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:00.980
Are you serious?

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:02.740
[Sarah]: Yeah.

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:06.740
UGGGGGH

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:09.200
I DON'T WANNA VOTE TODAY.

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:10.260
I'M SICK.

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:13.640
Hank, after I failed to vote in Florida in the 2000 presidential election,

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:15.180
I made a promise to myself

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.400
and to my country

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.020
that I would always vote.

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:19.380
Alright, let's go.

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.220
But I'm taking you with me!

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:21.880
Hank, don't get me wrong.

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:22.800
I like voting,

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:23.940
I'm grateful to vote,

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:25.620
I just don't think my vote matters that much.

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:27.100
And I don't meant that in the obvious way,

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.700
like, "lots of people vote and my vote only counts once",

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:32.340
I mean that whenever I'm doing like Crash Course research,

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.060
I've become increasingly convinced that

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:37.400
the most important actors in human history aren't voters,

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:38.880
they're microbes.

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.180
I went to the wrong polling place.

00:01:41.180 --> 00:01:42.760
[door opening]

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:44.440
Now I have to try again.

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:48.160
On the upside, I met nerdfighting poll workers, Neil and Aidan.

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:49.660
Alright, let's try again.

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:51.340
Uggggggh

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:52.540
I vote.

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:53.620
I count.

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.680
The tiny chickens will win in the end, Hank,

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:56.900
but until then,

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:58.120
I'm doing my part.

00:01:58.120 --> 00:01:59.500
See you on Friday.

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:00.520
PS. Nerdfighters,

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:03.120
Hank and I will be hanging out via Google+ tomorrow afternoon

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:04.720
on the Crash Course channel.

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:07.240
Go to &lt;youtube.com/crashcourse&gt; and subscribe to watch it.

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:08.240
It'll be tomorrow afternoon

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:09.620
at 3pm Eastern Time;

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:11.440
I don't know what time that is in your timezone.

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:12.580
I'm sick and tired

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:13.440
and I'm sorry

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.860
but you can look it up on this amazing thing called the Internet.
