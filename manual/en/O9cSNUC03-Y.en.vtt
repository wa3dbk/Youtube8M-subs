00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:03.880
Studio G-dcast

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:08.440
Six days in San Francisco, 
six stories, twelve artists.

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:15.440
Studio G-dcast

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:26.630
Okay okay okay son, get down 
I need you to come here.

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:30.419
I wanna tell you something that you really gotta hear
about your dad, Resh Lakish, a thug phenomenon

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:34.470
and my pretty boy brother, Rebbe Yochanan. 

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:39.570
Gladiator ripped, pirate clever,
Resh wasn't always good, but there no one better.

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.100
My dear son, I see Resh in you
as you grow tall. How he loved the ladies,

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:48.370
how he gave them his all. 
One day, Resh dove in the river, a champion swimmer,

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:52.630
pursuing a woman like a shark approaching dinner. 
His target was a beauty 

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:54.170
second only to me- 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:55.300
his target was *oops!* 

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:59.340
my brother Yochanan. You see, you see,
so beautiful that when he walked, his 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.300
path glistened. And so smart that when he
talked, people listened. Like the only one

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:09.690
at a party wanting dance, he was only the top, my son,
and so starts the bromance.

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:11.380
Yohanan saw Resh and was like  
"Dang boy, dang boy,

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:15.660
you could be a scholar;
bring your strengths to the books."

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:19.980
And Resh was like, "Dang Boy," always tryin to holler.
"You could be woman with those looks, with those looks."

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:25.970
To keep Resh around he offered finer than he:
hey, he offered Resh marriage to me!

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:30.570
Just say bye to gladiating, bye to thievery, 
and let's get into some T-T-T-Torah study.

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:37.570
Ah, when two pieces fit just right-
Yochanan's mind, Resh's might.

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:42.300
One calls out, "Black" and the other calls, "White"
and they Torah, Torah, Torah through the day and the night. 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:47.190
One day in their studies, weapons came up 
and my brother was like, 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:49.049
"You would know this stuff"

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:56.049
and Resh was like, "Uh, why the dis?
I was the master of that, and I'm the master of this."
A small comment

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:01.100
but a huge disaster- Yochanan saw Resh
just wanting to be a master. It wasn't about Torah

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.520
and it wasn't about God,

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.610
and Yochanan got ill- he couldn't go on. 
I pleaded "Forgive Resh," 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:12.099
thinking of you, 
but these men of principle and the things that they do. 

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:15.829
Yochanan's mind left, Resh's body left too. 
That's how your dad died, 

00:02:15.829 --> 00:02:20.049
sounds crazy but it's true. And
now again my brother was alone, was alone

00:02:20.049 --> 00:02:23.620
having loved and lost 
but the fault was his own.

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:27.469
The rabbis missed Yochanan, the only
sharp tack, so they sent in a fresh rabbi

00:02:27.469 --> 00:02:32.730
to try to win him back.
"You're so right, Yochanan," this rabbi always said.

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:37.989
Just reminding him that his best friend was dead.
"I can't take this! Please make the pain end.

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:44.989
Where are you? Where are you, 
my one and only friend?"
