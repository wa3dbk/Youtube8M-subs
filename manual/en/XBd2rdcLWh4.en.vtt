00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:08.800
This video shows how to make this ethereal wire wrapped glass bead necklace.

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:15.000
Take a length of 20 gauge wire fold it in two.

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.000
Make loop at folded end of doubled wire.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.000
Feed the first bead onto the doubled wire.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.600
Then feed the wires back through the bead.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.700
One at a time.

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:40.000
Gently work the wires down through the bead

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.800
by pushing the wire through while gently pulling down on the rest of the wire.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.200
The wire should lay up against the bead

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:05.700
threading wire back through the bead.

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:11.100
Again, pull wire taut.

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:26.600
And continue this way with all your beads.

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:57.000
Once you have the beads threaded make a loop at the end.

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:02.700
At this point you could simple add a chain or cord to finish....but I chose...

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.700
a more unusual look for the necklace.

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:11.100
Take a bangle - cut in half.

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:18.300
Make loops at both ends.

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:25.500
Place side by side and feed onto a jump ring.

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:40.700
This slide is out of sequence and just shows how the necklace is assembled.

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:48.600
Attach the necklace pendant to the bangle parts.

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:55.600
And there you have it - the necklace can be finished with any kind of closure, including small lengthening chain, etc.

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:03.000
How about this look?

A lengthening chain has been added to the back for a longer necklace.
