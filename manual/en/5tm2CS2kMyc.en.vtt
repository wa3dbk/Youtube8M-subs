00:00:00.159 --> 00:00:07.319
And before American Ballet Theatre existed there had not been an american style of dance an american voice in dance

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:11.069
So it really was a pioneer in its way and

00:00:11.530 --> 00:00:16.770
and over at seventy-five years you might think of it as a microcosm of the growth of America it

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:23.880
persevered, it survived, it was never stopped and consequently here we are. I mean as I was growing up as a dancer

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:27.869
American Ballet Theatre was a shiny object in the distance

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:31.949
Some to admire from afar and perhaps to dream one day

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:35.190
of being a part

00:00:35.469 --> 00:00:41.219
But I had ventured into my own world of dance and had not expected to cross the threshold into

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:44.430
this great American dance company

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:48.329
at that particular time Ballet Theatre was embracing

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:51.270
languages of more contemporary

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:54.209
choreographers and I was fortunate enough to be asked to

00:00:54.430 --> 00:01:00.539
contribute. Othello is in the tradition of the story dance which is really the foundation of American Ballet Theatre and

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.799
my first teachers were the great storytellers Anthony Tudor and Martha Graham and

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:12.149
When I approached the subject with Kevin McKenzie it occurred to me that I wanted to do a dance in the classical tradition of storytelling

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:17.099
but told in a contemporary way since my language was language of contemporary dance

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:25.049
but, I've always admired long admired the structure of classical story ballets. I think it was more a

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:28.559
fascination with getting to tell real stories again

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:36.720
Because, for, some time for the decades leading up to the creation of a solo abstract dance had really

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:39.900
taken precedence

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:46.500
but the story dance tradition had been always much always very much a part of the character of American Ballet Theatre so I

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:48.720
wanted to return to that. Well, the

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:55.589
significant thing about the depth of American Ballet Theatre is they've always been very versatile they've been able to shift from the utterly

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:00.269
classical mode right into the most contemporary language and today's dancer is really

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:05.630
A poly linguist a poly movement linguist there's of course it's a much

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:11.660
larger challenge of greater sculpt breadth and depth to create a full evening like dance

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:17.599
but, with it comes the excitement of risk and and risk is the energy

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.330
dancers and choreographers live by

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:28.669
crossing borders, creating new things this is really the stuff of the soul of dance. Dance in general is such an ideal

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.750
expression of our life

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:34.759
here in the United States because above all it's it's a symbol of

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:40.789
freedom and the democratic sharing space and time that ultimately arrives at a goal that

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:46.579
Is is a common cause in this case it's dance but symbolically it represents the kind of

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:52.880
humanity and kind of freedom and kind of idealism that that all art you know represents in society
