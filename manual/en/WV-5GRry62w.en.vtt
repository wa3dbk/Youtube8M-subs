00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:04.899
Hi, everyone.

00:00:04.899 --> 00:00:06.310
Scott Lewis here for Wirefly.

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:10.769
Today I'm here to bring you a waterproof Smartphone
Schmackdown between the Casio G'zOne Commando

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:15.349
4G LTE and the Kyocera Hydro Elite.

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:19.460
The phones we're comparing in today's Schmackdown
are both running on the Verizon 4G LTE wireless

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:20.460
network.

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.339
While they both share some of the same basic
functions from the basic Android operating

00:00:23.339 --> 00:00:27.910
system, they're both heavily layered with
a user interface from the manufacturer.

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:31.070
We'll get into that a little bit more in one
of the later rounds.

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:33.440
Today's Schmackdown is going to be broken
up into 3 rounds.

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:36.340
In Round 1 we'll cover the design elements
of both phones.

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:38.530
In Round 2 we'll cover the software that both
phones are running.

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:42.760
Then in Round 3 we'll cover the camera specs
and then show you some sample pictures from

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:46.420
the Commando 4G LTE and the Hydro Elite.

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:51.040
Let's go ahead and get our Schmackdown started
with Round 1, the Design Round.

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:54.840
First I wanted to mention that while both
phones don't have big-name recognition, like

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.500
Samsung, Motorola, Apple, or Nokia, they both
have a high-quality feel and a look that you

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.450
come to expect in a high-end Smartphone.

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:05.390
The Commando has a rough-and-tumble look that
shouts, "I'm a rugged Smartphone," when you

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:06.470
look at it.

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:11.390
The Hydro Elite, on the other hand, is more
subtle about showing its waterproof side.

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:16.060
To the average person, the Kyocera Hydro Elite
looks like any other non-waterproof Smartphone.

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:19.540
The only thing that even hints that it's a
waterproof, rugged Smartphone is the gasket

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:22.570
that seals the back cover when you're installing
the battery.

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:26.710
The Commando also has this same waterproof-gasket
design to help keep water out of the battery

00:01:26.710 --> 00:01:28.750
compartment.

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:32.450
The Kyocera Hydro Elite has a soft-touch back
cover plate that will help you keep a firm

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:34.180
grip on it.

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:37.780
The rugged outside cover on the Commando looks
great and has a nice feel, but it's a little

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:39.840
slippery for my taste.

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.200
Kyocera took a different approach when waterproofing
the Hydro Elite than Casio did with the Commando

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.370
G'zOne 4G LTE.

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:49.680
Like I said before, the outside of the Hydro
Elite looks like any other average Smartphone.

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.410
The Commando does have caps that need to seal
in order for it to maintain its waterproof

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:55.960
rating.

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:59.240
We've already established that both phones
have a different outside design.

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:02.940
Now its time to look at the designs on the
inside of the phones.

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:08.110
The Commando has a solid 4-inch LCD touchscreen
with a screen resolution of 480 x 800, giving

00:02:08.110 --> 00:02:12.359
it a pixel density of 233 pixels per inch.

00:02:12.359 --> 00:02:16.909
When comparing that to the Hydro Elite's 4.3-inch
LCD touchscreen, with a screen resolution

00:02:16.909 --> 00:02:23.140
of 720 x 1280 and a pixel density of 342 pixels
per inch, you'd expect the Hydro Elite to

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:25.319
be physically larger than the Casio.

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:27.480
You'd be wrong.

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.510
Here's a quick rundown of the measurements
of both phones.

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:32.739
[Video shows Commando to be 5.1 inches in
length, 2.7 inches in width, and .5 inches

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:35.969
thin; Hydro Elite is 4.8 inches in length,
2.4 inches in width, and .4 inches thin.]

00:02:35.969 --> 00:02:39.200
We just saw that the Hydro Elite is thinner
than a Commando, and that should tell us that

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:40.620
the Commando has a bigger battery.

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:46.249
But the Hydro Elite has a removable 2100mAh
battery, while the Commando has a 1800mAh

00:02:46.249 --> 00:02:47.249
battery.

00:02:47.249 --> 00:02:50.969
This is not a huge difference in capacity
and shouldn't make a huge difference in longevity,

00:02:50.969 --> 00:02:53.660
but it's something worth noting.

00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:56.780
To round out the Design Round, let's see what's
powering both phones.

00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:03.340
The Commando is running a 1.5GHz dual-core
processor with 1GB of RAM and 16GB of on-board

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.470
storage.

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:11.590
The Hydro Elite is also running a 1.5GHz dual-core
processor but comes with 1.5 GB of RAM and

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:14.669
16GB of on-board storage.

00:03:14.669 --> 00:03:17.969
If you need more storage after purchase, the
Commando and the Hydro Elite both have the

00:03:17.969 --> 00:03:21.959
ability to expand storage with a micro SD
card.

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:23.319
Let's recap the Design Round.

00:03:23.319 --> 00:03:26.659
The Hydro Elite has an advantage if you're
looking for a waterproof phone with a large

00:03:26.659 --> 00:03:29.419
display that looks like a normal Smartphone.

00:03:29.419 --> 00:03:34.359
The Casio G'zOne Commando in its rugged design
looks quite different than the Hydro Elite.

00:03:34.359 --> 00:03:37.709
That rugged design gives the Commando an edge
in durability.

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:41.860
In my opinion, the Hydro Elite and its textured
back cover has a better feel than the Commando's

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:43.909
smooth back cover.

00:03:43.909 --> 00:03:47.489
When comparing screen clarity and size, there's
no doubt that the Hydro Elite has a better

00:03:47.489 --> 00:03:49.510
looking display that's larger.

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:53.469
And when comparing battery and tech specs
between the two phones, you might not see

00:03:53.469 --> 00:03:58.079
a noticeable difference, but if you're somebody
that really looks at specs, the Kyocera Hydro

00:03:58.079 --> 00:03:59.549
Elite also has the edge there.

00:03:59.549 --> 00:04:04.810
So, our winner for Round 1, the Design Round,
is the Kyocera Hydro Elite.

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:07.840
Now on to Round 2, the Software Round.

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:10.739
Like I said earlier, both phones are running
on the Android operating system, but they

00:04:10.739 --> 00:04:14.819
look different because they're layered with
the user interface from the manufacturer.

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:18.850
The Casio user interface has some unique features
that I think add value to the Commando.

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:22.620
The G'z Gear App gives you access to lots
of useful information.

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:26.930
Some of the information you'll find inside
the G'z Gear App is temperature, tidal activity,

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:31.790
times for sunrise and sunsets, constellation
locations, how far you've walked, and the

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:34.479
current barometric pressure.

00:04:34.479 --> 00:04:39.270
All this great information also has the ability
to be displayed in widgets on the home screen.

00:04:39.270 --> 00:04:42.560
The Hydro Elite's user interface also has
some great value-added features.

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:46.509
The Hydro Elite has an eco-mode that will
help you conserve the battery life of your

00:04:46.509 --> 00:04:51.479
Smartphone to help you get the most out of
your Smartphone between charges.

00:04:51.479 --> 00:04:55.389
It does this by automatically adjusting the
brightness of the screen, Bluetooth connectivity,

00:04:55.389 --> 00:05:00.889
and turns on and off the vibration feedback
based on the amount of charge you have remaining.

00:05:00.889 --> 00:05:04.590
Both phones have interesting value-adds layered
on top of the Android operating system, although

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:08.830
sometimes these heavy layers affect the phones'
performance.

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:12.161
With the time I spent with both phones, I
saw a little bit more lag on the Commando

00:05:12.161 --> 00:05:13.970
than I did on the Hydro Elite.

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:18.389
Overall, I like what the Casio user interface
brings to the table, but I'm not willing to

00:05:18.389 --> 00:05:20.599
sacrifice convenience for performance.

00:05:20.599 --> 00:05:26.009
So, the winner for Round 2 for me is the Kyocera
Hydro Elite.

00:05:26.009 --> 00:05:29.169
Now it's time for Round 3, the Camera Round.

00:05:29.169 --> 00:05:32.050
Let's start with some camera specs, and then
we'll take a look at some sample photos and

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:35.860
decide the winner for the Round and the winner
for our Schmackdown today.

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:41.960
Both phones are equipped with an 8MP primary
camera and a 1.3MP front-facing camera.

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:43.949
That's about where the similarities stop.

00:05:43.949 --> 00:05:47.530
The on-screen interface on the Casio is a
lot easier to use and make adjustments on

00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:50.379
than the interface on the Hydro Elite.

00:05:50.379 --> 00:05:54.240
The Casio gives you quick access to adjustments
that you want and should use when trying to

00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:56.949
take great pictures with your Smartphone.

00:05:56.949 --> 00:06:00.710
To switch the camera to night mode for improved
picture-taking in low-light settings, it takes

00:06:00.710 --> 00:06:05.030
2 taps on the screen for the Casio, while
it takes 5 for the Kyocera.

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:11.409
Now let's go ahead and take a look at some
side-by-side samples from both phones.

00:06:11.409 --> 00:06:44.189
[Video shows side-by side samples of pictures
from both phones.]

00:06:44.189 --> 00:06:49.349
Those were the sample pictures from the Casio
G'zOne Commando 4G LTE and the Kyocera Hydro

00:06:49.349 --> 00:06:50.349
Elite.

00:06:50.349 --> 00:06:53.820
I like the sample photos better on the Casio,
and I like the interface better.

00:06:53.820 --> 00:06:57.780
And that's why Round 3, the Camera Round,
is going to go to the Casio G'zOne Commando

00:06:57.780 --> 00:06:58.870
4G LTE.

00:06:58.870 --> 00:07:03.039
Now it's time to crown our Schmackdown champion
for today.

00:07:03.039 --> 00:07:08.320
With taking 2 Rounds out of 3, the Kyocera
Hydro Elite wins our Wirefly waterproof Smartphone

00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:09.680
Schmackdown.

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:12.680
Now it's time for you to sound off and let
us know which phone you think won the Schmackdown.

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:14.310
Did we get it right?

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:18.300
Is the Kyocera Hydro Elite the better Smartphone,
or did we get it wrong?

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:20.469
Let us know in the comment section down below.

00:07:20.469 --> 00:07:23.300

My name's Scott Lewis for Wirefly.

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:31.860
Thanks for watching.
