00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:08.360
Taking its inspiration from the Audi A4 Allroad,
VW Passat Alltrack and Volvo XC70 is the new

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:11.450
Vauxhall Insignia Country Tourer.

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:16.260
Based on the more conventional Sports Tourer,
the Country Tourer adds all-wheel-drive, 20mm

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.490
higher ground clearance and tougher styling.

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:23.310
Some of that arrives in the shape of the grey
body cladding and wheel-arch extensions, the

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:27.460
rather handsome 18-inch alloy wheels, the
distinctive headlights with wing-shaped LED

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:32.230
running lights - a theme that's repeated at
the rear with the tail-lights - chunky fog-light

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:36.089
surrounds, and subtle silver trim designed
to be reminiscent of a skid-plate.

00:00:36.089 --> 00:00:40.010
At the rear, the chunky look continues, particularly
with the twin exhausts poking out through

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:44.960
the silver trim of the rear diffuser, while
a subtle 4x4 badge hints at the Haldex-based

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:47.710
four-wheel-drive system that lurks beneath.

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:53.170
Inside, it's Insignia business as usual, with
a laid-back driving position and a high window-line

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:55.749
that offers a sense of security.

00:00:55.749 --> 00:00:59.569
The dash itself is well laid out, although
some of the switches such as the Sport button

00:00:59.569 --> 00:01:03.079
are mounted high up and are a bit of a stretch
to reach.

00:01:03.079 --> 00:01:06.899
It's also a little surprising to find dual-zone
climate control is an option on a car like

00:01:06.899 --> 00:01:07.899
this.

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:12.939
Still, the centre stack is dominated by Vauxhall's
IntelliLink system which provides audio, phone,

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:16.869
and navigation functions with an eight-inch
touch-screen that makes everything generally

00:01:16.869 --> 00:01:18.720
easy to get around.

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.549
If you don't like jabbing a sticky finger
at the display, you can instead use the touch-pad

00:01:22.549 --> 00:01:26.590
controller mounted down by the gear-lever
to swipe your way through the menus, and you

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:30.159
can even use the pad to draw letters when
entering addresses - although we found that

00:01:30.159 --> 00:01:31.159
somewhat laborious.

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:36.469
The Country Tourer uses the eight-inch instrument
display that appeared in the Insignia in a

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:40.590
recent update, and it allows a variety of
information to be displayed in front of the

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:41.590
driver.

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:46.060
There's a choice of two styles, too, based
on whether you're in Sport mode or not.

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:49.869
The rear seats are a fairly laid-back affair,
and while there's plenty of headroom, there's

00:01:49.869 --> 00:01:52.539
not a tremendous amount of room to get your
feet in.

00:01:52.539 --> 00:01:56.479
Once you're in, though, it's pretty comfortable
back here, and you get your own charging point,

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:59.219
armrest and cup-holders to keep you amused.

00:01:59.219 --> 00:02:03.189
If you're into cargo space, the seats fold
forward easily and although they're not completely

00:02:03.189 --> 00:02:05.829
flat, they're not far off.

00:02:05.829 --> 00:02:09.619
All Country Tourer models come with a power
tailgate as standard, and this can be opened

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:13.569
and closed from the key fob or via a handy
button in the driver's door that also allows

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:18.720
you to limit how far it opens - useful in,
say, a multi-story car park.

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:23.030
The boot opens to reveal a fairly hefty rear
overhang that can make loading a bit of a

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:24.030
stretch for some people.

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:29.050
That aside, though, it's a good size, and
features an underfloor storage area, underneath

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:33.150
which is the puncture repair kit, there's
a ski-hatch for long loads, and with the seats

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.349
folded there's 1,530 litres of space on offer.

00:02:37.349 --> 00:02:42.840
Two engines are available: a 2.0-litre turbodiesel
with 163PS and 350Nm of torque, or this, the

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:50.480
2.0-litre BiTurbo with a more interesting
195PS and 400Nm.

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:54.000
The latter definitely sounds the more interesting,
but while the low-power unit is available

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.590
with both auto and manual transmissions, the
BiTurbo version is available only with an

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.489
automatic.

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:04.330
As diesel engines go, it's a little noisy,
though, filling the cabin with a rather characterless

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:05.800
drone.

00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:10.261
It's not helped by an automatic gearbox that
feels somewhat behind the competition.

00:03:10.261 --> 00:03:13.700
A six-speed unit, it engages each new ratio
with something of a jolt.

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:18.040
It seems to have been given a very tall set
of ratios, too, and this is exasperated by

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:22.370
its relaxed attitude to kick-down - floor
the gas pedal, and the 'box seems willing

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:28.069
to downshift only one gear, masking what would
otherwise be a very quick car.

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:31.430
Engage Sport mode and the transmission will
hold on to lower gears for longer, perhaps

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:33.580
in an attempt to get around this.

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:36.769
Really all this means, though, is that you
spend much of your time driving around at

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:41.260
nearly 3,000rpm in too low a gear burning
fuel faster than is necessary.

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:46.400
If you want to press on, it's best to use
the tiptronic function of the gear lever - slide

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.730
it across to the Manual position and then
change gear yourself by pushing the lever

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:51.189
forwards and backwards.

00:03:51.189 --> 00:03:55.340
It's a shame the auto box lets the side down,
because the chassis that underpins the Insignia

00:03:55.340 --> 00:04:00.000
is nicely sorted, with a nicely pliant ride
and a surprising ability to filter out even

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.689
large surface imperfections.

00:04:02.689 --> 00:04:06.580
That doesn't mean it wallows about- in fact,
body-roll is very well controlled, especially

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:10.719
when you consider the Country Tourer is 20mm
further away from the ground than the regular

00:04:10.719 --> 00:04:11.950
Tourer models.

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:17.690
That modest increase in ground clearance isn't
necessarily an invitation to head out off-roading.

00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:21.650
Realistically it's more a practical safety-net
to keep you out and about in adverse weather

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:25.880
conditions, with the system defaulting to
largely front-wheel-drive in normal use, but

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:30.280
with a centre differential that can send up
to 95% of engine torque to the rear wheels

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:32.290
as necessary.

00:04:32.290 --> 00:04:36.440
Despite the added 4x4 ability, it's likely
the Insignia will spend most of its time trudging

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:40.930
up and down the motorways, and that's no bad
thing because that's where the Insignia shines,

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:45.010
with comfortable seats, a well-composed ride,
and wind and road noise that are both kept

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:46.520
well in check.

00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:47.780
Economy is respectable, too.

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:53.340
While the government figures claim 42.8mpg
for our BiTurbo model, we averaged around

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:58.120
33mpg in everyday driving, while a day spent
on the UK's motorway network notched up a

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:01.560
figure just under 41mpg.

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:07.470
Prices for the Country Tourer start at £24,349
for a model without the 4x4 system, with the

00:05:07.470 --> 00:05:10.889
cheapest AWD version priced at £25,494.

00:05:10.889 --> 00:05:17.160
Our BiTurbo test car with a few tasteful options
tips the scales at £35,579.

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:25.250
By comparison, the VW Passat Alltrack starts
at £29,385 with the Audi A4 Allroad kicking

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:28.790
in at £32,235.

00:05:28.790 --> 00:05:32.660
If you're looking for an estate car to keep
you mobile when all others are getting stuck,

00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:37.310
the Insignia Country Tourer offers a handsome
and value-for-money alternative to the established

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:38.370
German competition.
