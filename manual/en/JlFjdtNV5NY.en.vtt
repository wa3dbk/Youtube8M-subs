This tutorial will show you how to set
up "Fax Enabled Voice Mail"

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.210
"Fax Enable Voice Mail" allows you to
receive faxes

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:25.700
in your voice mail inbox in a PDF format.
With this feature you're able to download

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.960
then save, forward, or print out a fax
at you're convenience.

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:33.220
You can even view a fax on your mobile
device if you enable the notification

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:33.800
settings.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.120
However, if you would like to send a
fax, you will need a physical fax machine

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:39.120
for this purpose.

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.270
So now that you understand "Fax Enabled
Voice Mail"

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:45.000
lets set it up.

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:51.110
First locate the "Fax Enabled Voice Mail"
tab on your home page.

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:54.970
By default this feature is disabled, so
our first step is to enable it.

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:59.970
Once you click "Enable", a box allowing you
to read the Terms of Service will appear.

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:04.739
Read the Terms of Service, then click I
Agree.  As you can see

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:08.100
the "Fax Enabled Voice Mail" feature is now
active.

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.470
If you would like to be notified on your
mobile device when a fax has been

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:13.300
received

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:17.000
we only have a couple of more steps to
configure it.

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.210
Start by clicking the "Service Settings" tab.

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.500
Then click "Voice Mail Settings"

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.020
on the "Voice Mail Settings" page

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.500
you will need to enter an email address for
notification.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.910
Next, click the boxes next to voice mail and
fax.

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.890
Then click "Save Notification Settings",

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:43.679
and you are done
