[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:10.730
So we're up here on a mountain top.

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:12.396
We've got a storm [INAUDIBLE] behind us.

00:00:12.396 --> 00:00:14.175
It's pretty darn cold outside.

00:00:14.175 --> 00:00:16.467
But we're going to throw
down, get a little workout in.

00:00:16.467 --> 00:00:18.508
This is going to prepare
us for the whole course.

00:00:18.508 --> 00:00:21.040
And it's also going to prepare
us for Arctic [INAUDIBLE]..

00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:21.570
Why not?

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.005
It's freezing out here.

00:00:23.005 --> 00:00:24.230
We don't really need a gym.

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:27.680
We just need a little bit of
creativity for our mudder training.

00:00:27.680 --> 00:00:29.528
Let's get Coachified.

00:00:29.528 --> 00:00:33.000
[THEME MUSIC]

00:01:33.736 --> 00:01:34.690
What's up, Mudders?

00:01:34.690 --> 00:01:36.735
We just got done with
a mountain top workout.

00:01:36.735 --> 00:01:39.617
It was a lot of fun, just
showing that you don't

00:01:39.617 --> 00:01:41.200
need to take yourself super seriously.

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:42.408
You don't need any equipment.

00:01:42.408 --> 00:01:45.830
You just need to be creative to
get ready for a Tough Mudder.

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:47.790
It's freezing cold out here.

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:50.740
I'm borderline hypothermic.

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.830
And I'm ready for some alpha
aminos to do a little recharging.

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:55.980
See you guys next week.
