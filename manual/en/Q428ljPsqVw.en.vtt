00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:07.510
From this diagram we are going
to learn how, basically, an

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:10.340
automobile engine works.

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:14.460
This is a cylinder.

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:19.350
This is basically one cylinder
that we have. And these are

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:22.100
the walls of the cylinder, and
this is the piston that we

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:26.360
have. And this piston is
what moves up and down.

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:28.370
And we have two inlet.

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:34.000
One inlet is for fuel and air
to come in and mixture.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.480
And this is a valve that
opens and closes.

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:41.930
And there is another outlet
here that takes out the

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:45.515
exhaust gases, and there is
another valve that opens and

00:00:45.515 --> 00:00:47.420
closes at appropriate times.

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:50.990
And when the fuel and the air
mixture is inside, the spark

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:55.390
plug provides a spark to
ignite the mixture.

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:59.820
Now, let's see in sequence what
happens in this cylinder.

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:02.610
This piston, basically,
moves up and down.

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:07.480
So the first step is to bring
the fuel and oxidizer, or air,

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:09.300
inside the mixture.

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.820
So this valve opens up.

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:13.810
This valve, of course,
is closed.

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:19.980
And this fuel and air mixture
comes in as this piston is

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:21.630
pushed down.

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.610
This acts like a syringe,
a medical syringe.

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:29.020
When we push this down, the
fuel and air mixture is

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:33.670
basically sucked in, and it
fills up this entire volume as

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:36.650
this piston comes down.

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:39.690
That is the first
step or stroke.

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:42.450
This is a four-stroke engine
that we are talking about.

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.270
First stroke is intake.

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:51.860
And the second stroke, now, the
second step is we close

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:55.490
both of these valve and
push this mixture.

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:59.740
This mixture is, again by
pushing the piston up, this

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:05.770
mixture that is in here is
compressed to very high

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:11.160
pressures, roughly about eight
times to nine times.

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.840
And this piston moves
back up here.

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.860
And again, we have to spend
energy to move the system or

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.660
compress this mixture here.

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:24.700
When this mixture is
compressed to the

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:29.130
predetermined pressures, at
that time the spark plug

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:31.550
ignites this mixture.

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:35.680
And this flame front travels
all the way and

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:37.400
burns all this fuel.

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.280
And this fuel reaches very
high temperatures, and it

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:44.810
pushes the piston all the way
down, all the way down.

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:47.115
So this is actually
the power stroke.

00:02:47.115 --> 00:02:49.420
The first stroke is intake.

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:51.823
The second stroke
is compression.

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.280
Compression.

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:03.400
And the third stroke is
the power stroke.

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:10.140
That is the stroke that gives us
the power from this engine.

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:13.530
In the first stroke and the
second stroke, we have to

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:18.910
supply the energy that is
required to bring in the

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:22.590
oxidizer and fuel and
also to compress.

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:29.270
And after this mixture expands,
or pushes the piston

00:03:29.270 --> 00:03:33.420
down, this valve, this exhaust
valve, will open.

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:36.640
And of course, this valve
is still closed.

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:42.510
And the piston, again, moves
back up, for which we have to

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:43.920
supply the power.

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:48.500
And all of these gases go out
through this exhaust.

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:53.590
And once the exhaust gasses
are out, this valve closes

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:55.880
again and this valve
opens, and the

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:57.910
entire cycle again repeats.

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:01.235
So the fourth stroke is
the exhaust stroke.

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:08.730
So this is a, basically,
four-stroke engine that we are

00:04:08.730 --> 00:04:09.870
talking about.

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:12.810
We need to know the four strokes
and the important

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:19.180
components of this
engine cylinder.

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:23.280
And there generally will
be multiple cylinders.

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.060
We're talking about one here.

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:27.440
And there could be 4,
there could be 6.

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:31.240
There could be 8, or even
10 or even 12 sometimes.

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:34.030
So as the engine becomes bigger
and bigger, you have

00:04:34.030 --> 00:04:35.310
more cylinders.

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:37.910
And that gives us more power.
