00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:05.420
Oh ain't this a trip! Hi guys it's Steve Spell
II I'm coming to you today from inside of

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:08.570
my little snowball stand (Snow Cone Food Truck)
and I'm trying to keep it down I'm trying

00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:14.499
to run a family wholesome business, but I
turn on the news today and on every damn channel

00:00:14.499 --> 00:00:19.429
all I'm hearing about is Tom Brady and his
balls. (Referee Whistle) Are you kidding me

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:24.609
that's what we're talking about? The Patriots
have been to the Super Bowl 6 times with Tom

00:00:24.609 --> 00:00:29.140
Brady at the helm, 6 times! The guy has lost
more Super Bowls than most quarterbacks in

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:34.789
the NFL will ever enjoy seeing and so you
guys are trying to tell me that allegedly

00:00:34.789 --> 00:00:40.399
they let a little bit of air out of the balls
so the man tampers with his own balls and

00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:46.899
then that led to a 45 - 7 rout of the Indianapolis
Colts? Give me a break. While we're talking

00:00:46.899 --> 00:00:52.680
about his balls let me just pull it up here
I got my computer right here and I'm just

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:58.859
gonna look at this article; Patriots accused
of tampering with players balls. Are you kidding?

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:04.019
Are you seriously kidding me with this? Penalties
could be stiff? Yeah I bet they could be "Stiff".

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:08.890
In this latest scandal involving the NFL and
the Patriots the rumors are flying all over

00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:13.640
the locker room that the Patriots were illegally
handling the teams balls (Referee Whistle)

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:19.240
during the 45 to 7 rout of the Indianapolis
Colts. The NFL has initiated whats sure to

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:24.090
be a ball busting investigation into the matter.
I'll be honest with you Andrew Luck performed

00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:30.110
very poorly I thought, I mean the guy I think
Andrew's Luck ran out no pun intended had

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:36.740
nothing to do with the man's balls! You don't
take a team like the Patriots whose known

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.259
statistically speaking of blowing out other
teams and then accuse them of messing with

00:01:41.259 --> 00:01:46.670
the balls! (Ref's Whistle) come on man, any
Jackass knows better than that and even if

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:50.810
you do let a little bit of air out of the
balls (Referee Whistle, Penalty Foul) is that

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:57.810
gonna lead you to win by 45 to 7? That's ridiculous.
You could say it's down right "Ballsy" there

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:03.799
is much that the NFL should be investigating
and whether or not New England Patriots were

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:08.399
illegally tampering with their own balls is
not one of the things that the commissioner

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:14.910
should be looking at right now. Come on man!
Come on! You got, you know it's already alright

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:18.270
to beat your wife, slap your kids around do
whatever you want in the NFL but don't mess

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:23.800
with the balls because then we will launch
a full scale ball busting investigation! Is

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:29.580
nothing sacred anymore? Tom Brady can't even
leave the house now without people accusing

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:34.690
him of ball tampering! How many, you know
I'm 38 years old ain't nobody ever accused

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:39.230
me of ball tampering, tampering with another
man's balls what's wrong with you guys? Leave

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:44.160
Tom Brady and his balls alone show the man
some dignity and stop talking about his balls!

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:51.160
