00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:21.333
Welcome to TFN Access. In this episode
we're happy to bring to you

00:00:21.333 --> 00:00:26.667
a special presentation by renowned Chef
Chachaya Raktakanishta, Director of the

00:00:26.667 --> 00:00:31.667
Suan Dusit International
Culinary School in Thailand.

00:00:32.933 --> 00:00:38.000
She introduced "A New Menu, Famous Dishes
from Thailand and The Art of Fine Dining"

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.133
to a group of invited guests who
learned how to prepare and also got

00:00:42.133 --> 00:00:47.133
to sample these delicious modern
twists on traditional Thai classics.

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:08.000
In food presentation, there's a saying
in the West, "The eyes eat first"

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.567
That is to say, the first thing you experience
with food is not with tongue

00:01:12.567 --> 00:01:15.833
or sense of taste, but with the eyes. So when
a dish is presented, a customer has

00:01:15.833 --> 00:01:20.833
already decided whether the food will be
good or not, simply by how it looks.

00:01:28.167 --> 00:01:33.167
First menu to demonstrate is Fried Steamed
Fishcake with Husked Rice

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.233
Chef Rakta put a modern twist on this
Thai classic by forming the paste

00:01:51.233 --> 00:01:56.333
into balls and rolling them in husked
rice before cooking. And then she

00:01:56.333 --> 00:02:02.333
served them up in grand style atop a bed of
fried noodles with colorful garnishments.

00:02:25.367 --> 00:02:32.933
Sea Bass is the type of fish used.

00:02:32.933 --> 00:02:41.867
On the meat side, it's cut in a square
diagram and then mixed with corn flour.

00:02:41.867 --> 00:02:47.867
After it's deep fried, it will
form a beautiful shape.

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:56.033
The twist on her next dish was all in the
presentation. By elaborately cutting

00:02:56.033 --> 00:03:00.200
the fish filets into the form of a flower
and serving them on an elaborately

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:06.200
arranged plate, Chef Rakta updated this
traditional dish to a modern day art form.

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.967
We are using Pineapples, Red Grapes,
Lychees, and Pea Eggplants, just like

00:03:18.967 --> 00:03:24.633
a traditional red curry with roasted duck.
But instead of using roasted duck,

00:03:24.633 --> 00:03:29.633
we fry the duck and cover it until
it's cooked in the middle.

00:03:30.467 --> 00:03:36.233
For her final dish, Chef Raktakanishta
deconstructs the traditional curry by making

00:03:36.233 --> 00:03:39.933
the duck the highlight of the dish and
separating the primary ingredients

00:03:39.933 --> 00:03:44.933
on the plate. She proved that preparing
meat in a more Western tradition - 

00:03:44.933 --> 00:03:48.367
removing it from the heat before its
cooked well-done - is equally

00:03:48.367 --> 00:03:53.367
delicious, while preserving all
the flavor and juices.

00:03:56.333 --> 00:04:01.300

Thai Chef Chachaya Raktakanishta, who
demonstrated the ease

00:04:09.167 --> 00:04:14.167

dishes a modern twist.

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:18.800
