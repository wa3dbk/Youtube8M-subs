Hi friends, Jenni here.

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:06.120
I love cutting shirts &amp; experimenting with DIY fashion.

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:12.000
On my @DIYwithJenni channel I compile all my fashion-related videos &amp; playlists.

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:23.820
First I cut off the neck

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:36.860
And then I cut off some fabric from the bottom.

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:44.900
Fold the shirt in half, and cut slits along the back side.

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:54.260
snip snip snip

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:20.280
Cut little slits on the top of the sleeves.

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:31.000
Then fold the front of the shirt in half.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.640
And cut more slits down the front.

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:39.120
Fold the shirt again so you can cut down the sides.

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:49.560
Stretch the fabric

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:07.220
Some slits I only make down the bottom half of the front of the shirt.

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:11.540
Get creative as you like. ðŸ˜Š

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:22.600
Stretch stretch.

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:28.720
Weaving: pull each strand through the next, starting at the top and going all the way to the bottom.

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:35.320
Refer to my Tutorials Playlist for slower explanation for weaving. ðŸ’™

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:41.820
Cut the last strands and knot them at the sides.

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:50.280
Add as much weaving as you'd like.

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:21.180
When weaving, you can add a loop before pulling the next strand through, for a different look.

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:51.740
Hope you enjoyed this video.
