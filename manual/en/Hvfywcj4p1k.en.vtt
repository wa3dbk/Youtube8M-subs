If you don't wear primer already, I have feeling you're going to start after you 

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:12.990
hear what our newest primer can do. We already know that makeup always looks better 

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.840
with primer. What about a primer that seriously reduces the appearance 

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:20.500
of pores and keeps shine away? Sounds like perfection in a tube, right? 

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:23.500
Say hello to our Photo Finish Pore Minimizing Primer. 

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:28.390
I'm going to have some amazing secrets to share with you guys after testing it in our photo studios

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:30.000
under hot lights all day long

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:35.400
Be just applying it alone or under makeup, you're going to minimize pores 

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.590
and absorb oil for up to eight hours. We know that.

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:42.469
But to get that gorgeous matte look that's super on trend right now,

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:45.550
try dusting a tiny bit of powder on top of it. It creates

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:49.059
that no makeup skin that I'm seeing all over the red carpets.

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:54.100
You can also use this primer throughout the day as a touch up for problem areas, like your t-zone.

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:57.010
So on Ashley, I'm just going to use a tiny bit to

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:01.500
touch up her problem areas. So you can see where Ashley is just a tiny bit shiny across her forehead,

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:04.710
on the tops of her cheeks, center of her chin,

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:10.000
tip of her nose. We want to really minimize that, and you're just going to blend it into the skin.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:16.100
Instantly minimizes the appearance of the shine, but it never looks

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.960
cakey or heavy. I love how you can really zero in and target problem areas.

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.280
It's like the ultimate secret weapon in my makeup kit on set. 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:26.900
Finally, one of my ultimate tips for this primer:

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.900
you can also apply it over your finished makeup look.

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:33.439
Yep, that's right. I said you could put this primer on last. 

00:01:33.439 --> 00:01:37.400
I know we always say to apply primer first, but with this primer, you can do both -

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:41.100
first and last. This will actually keep your makeup from moving. 

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:44.900
Think of it as makeup insurance. just put on a light, thin layer. 

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:49.380
These are some serious on-set secrets for amazing looking skin.

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:53.759
You'll be pore-free, you'll be shine-free, you'll be flawless for up to eight hours.

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:56.300
Eight whole hours! That's incredible, right? Love it!
