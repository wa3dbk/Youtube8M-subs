00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:08.720
Hi!

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:11.730
Tyrone Shum here from Outsourcinglive.com.

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:16.910
What I want to share with you today is exactly
what microphone that I recommend to use when

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:19.000
using video to record.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.249
Now there's two different types of microphones
you can use and it really depends exactly

00:00:24.249 --> 00:00:25.249
on what you're doing.

00:00:25.249 --> 00:00:29.380
If you're using a camera which right now I'm
talking on the camera, sharing with you exactly

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:33.831
what I'm doing or if you've got something
hooked up or if you're using a video to do

00:00:33.831 --> 00:00:38.440
a screen capture which you want a different
mic for that as well.

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:44.840
So first thing I want to share with you is
exactly the lapel mic that I use to be able

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:45.840
to clip onto me.

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.300
So if you can see this little - I don't know
if you can see this right here, but there's

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:54.270
a little mic that's clipped onto my shirt
and this mic goes directly straight into the

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:55.770
video camera.

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.870
And make sure that the camera that I've recommended,
there's another video as I shared with you

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:03.500
in the past is exactly what camera to use.

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:09.740
So I recommend the Canon T3i camera or the
Kodak Zi8 camera which is in another video

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:11.140
which you're going to have a look later on.

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:16.250
Okay so coming back to it, this is the mic
that I'm currently using and it's just basically

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:17.470
a wired mic.

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:21.380
It comes with a switch and this is what we
call a condenser mic and the switch just turns

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:22.880
it off and on.

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:27.900
And then what it has is an extension which
just clips on like a little mic that you just

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.570
clip onto to your shirt like this.

00:01:29.570 --> 00:01:36.520
And then it comes with a 3.5mm jack or jack
socket that you plug straight in to like a

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:37.820
male to a female.

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:39.060
And that's all you need.

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.640
Something like this, I've picked up from Tandy
and also Dick Smith, Dick Smith here in Australia

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.180
for around about 30bucks so it's a really
good quality mic.

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:52.640
It comes with a battery so there's a little
lithium battery that's in here, or not lithium

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:55.380
but small little battery, I can't remember
what they call it.

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:01.190
I should know because my family just change
or watch for their business but yeah, inside

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:06.950
there there's a little battery there which
keeps the mic running and also too it produces

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.369
that nice quality sound.

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:18.160
So if I actually took out the mic right now
which I'll do in a sec, so I've taken the

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.950
mic right now, and you can see that it sounds
very echoey, it's a really bucket type of

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:23.950
noise.

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.320
That's the reason why I wanted to share that
with you to show you what it sounds like.

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:28.500
And now the mic's plugged back in.

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:32.920
So you can tell that it makes a huge difference
to the quality of sound and I highly, highly

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:37.480
recommend to whatever video you're doing to
make sure that you do have a sound.

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:41.510
It doesn't matter if the quality of the video
is not too good, you know you can get away

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.290
with that but the sound is very, very important.

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.319
Special effects, adding on sounds, stuff like
that is the reason why a lot of movies are

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:51.750
successful is because the sound is very, very
good quality.

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:54.670
And you don't see the behind the scenes because
usually they've got mics at the top, they've

00:02:54.670 --> 00:02:59.239
got mics on the side and stuff like that and
they're trying to capture the best quality

00:02:59.239 --> 00:03:00.430
sound if possible.

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:06.600
All right so that's what I use currently for
the cameras that I record on.

00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:12.500
Second thing is as I mentioned, you can also
get what we call a condenser mic which I currently

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.930
use to record all my screen capture software
- sorry screen capture videos.

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:20.040
And the mic that I currently use is called
the Rode Podcaster.

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:22.280
Rode Podcaster is very, very good.

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:27.250
It's made in Australia and it's of high quality
but the sound quality is absolutely amazing

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:31.150
and I'd recommend if you're going to spend
some money on getting a good quality of mic,

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:34.920
that's what I would get for the computer when
you're doing screen recordings, whatever you're

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:36.460
doing, even for podcasts.

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:38.519
So definitely check that out.

00:03:38.519 --> 00:03:42.390
If you can't afford something like that which
is quite pricey I understand that, check out

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:48.040
the Snowball Mic which is also a relatively
priced mic that's about half the price.

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:54.349
Quality wise, yeah it's not too bad but it
doesn't have all the extra functions that

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:57.209
you'd be looking at for a particular mic like
that.

00:03:57.209 --> 00:04:01.640
And it just sits there on the desktop so if
you want to lean down and talk into it you've

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:04.770
got to talk relative close to it to get and
pick up the quality.

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:09.519
Whereas the Rode Podcaster mic, it's got short
stand and you know all the she bang which

00:04:09.519 --> 00:04:11.090
is what it's got as well.

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:16.650
And I'll show you a setup of it you can see
actually it gets setup in my office and that

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:19.019
way you get idea of how it is.

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:23.599
So anyway, as I said it's very important to
have the right equipment and the right mic

00:04:23.599 --> 00:04:26.430
to go with your camera.

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:29.680
I'm really, really tongue-twisted today but
I do my best.

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:30.940
Excuse me for that.

00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:36.250
But get the right mic and make sure the quality
of sound of your videos are of high quality

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:41.139
because it really makes that extra little
bit different to make your video stand out.

00:04:41.139 --> 00:04:45.570
All right, if you've got any further questions
and you'd like to add any further feedback

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:49.710
to it to let me know what you think about
these videos and also let me know what you

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:51.840
think about the microphones I recommended.

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:55.110
Feel free to leave it down below, I'd love
to be able to answer any of your questions

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:56.139
as well.

00:04:56.139 --> 00:04:58.210
