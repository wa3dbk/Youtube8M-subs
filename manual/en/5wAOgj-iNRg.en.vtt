[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:07.310
Hey guys.

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:09.170
Des, T-Mobile product expert here.

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:14.330
And today, we're going to do a first
impressions of the new HTC1 One M9.

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:16.880
Sense is one of the best
features of the new M9.

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.400
Of course, we have the
new Sense Home, which

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:23.970
customizes which applications show up on
the home screen based on where you are.

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:26.190
So since we're at work right
now, we'll select work.

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:29.480
And you can see different
applications are served up to you.

00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:35.270
Once we got to home, you could see
the applications change dynamically.

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:38.960
As we go into the app drawer, we can
see lots of great pre-loaded content--

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.500
things that you need,
news, and information.

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.830
You can see that we have multiple
screens for the home screen.

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:49.340
And then as we move once to the
left, we have HTC BlinkFeed.

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:51.650
Some of the other great
features of the device

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:55.370
are, of course, HTC BoomSound
and the brand new camera.

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:57.510
Let's play a little
something from BoomSound.

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:58.970
We go ahead and launch music.

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:01.250
We've got a song
already cued up for you.

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:02.480
This is "Raise" by ZNI.

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:07.855
And those dual front-facing
speakers sound amazing.

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.750
Nice separation of bass and treble.

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:18.220
Now, movies and games sound
amazing with BoomSound as well.

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:22.030
And who wouldn't want to play games
or watch videos on this beautiful 5

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:24.250
inch full HD screen?

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:29.050
Now, the device is powered by a Qualcomm
Snapdragon Octa core processor--

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:30.730
yes, that's eight cores.

00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:33.910
And we have an amazing
battery, three gigs of RAM,

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:35.692
and 32 gigs of internal storage.

00:01:35.692 --> 00:01:37.900
Let's go ahead and check
out the camera, since that's

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:40.180
the other impressive
update they've made.

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:43.390
The ultra pixel from last year was
moved from the back to the front.

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:45.730
So we have four ultra
pixels on the front--

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:47.950
great for low light,
things like selfies.

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:53.950
And then on the back, the 20
megapixel new main camera.

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:55.660
Let's go ahead and take some photos.

00:01:55.660 --> 00:02:00.610
Now, of course, we can also take
full HD videos and even 4K videos.

00:02:00.610 --> 00:02:05.860
All in all, the new HTC One M9 is an
amazing device coming soon to T-Mobile.

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:08.530
This has been Des,
T-mobile device expert.

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:09.530
Thanks for watching.

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:11.700
Stay tuned for more.
