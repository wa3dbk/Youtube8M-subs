00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:05.420
we were training him to  identify all these different objects he learned to identify 

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:10.410
fifty objects and  seven colors and five
shapes in quantities up to about six over the

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:11.709
years

00:00:11.709 --> 00:00:16.000
but the issue was we started with objects that
he wanted to obtain

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.110
so it's very easy to teach him to label those
things 

00:00:26.129 --> 00:00:27.750
so we had to teach him

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.619
the label want

00:00:29.619 --> 00:00:33.549
so that he could ask us for what he wanted
as his reward

00:00:33.549 --> 00:00:36.380
separate identification from requests
0:00:36.380,0:00:38.380
 but sometimes he still

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:40.289
just didn't want to

00:00:40.289 --> 00:00:42.930
work and he started with

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:44.530
this little nuh

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:48.480
we do things like show him an object

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.890
 give you a time out

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:55.030
so he learned to say I'm going to go away he
walk

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:59.000
to the edge  of the perch  away from us

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.390
sometimes you get  all the wrong answers
so if the answer was one color

00:01:03.390 --> 00:01:07.350
he would repeat the six wrong colors

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:07.950
yeah

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:10.979
I think it was more fun for him made it more
interesting 

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:15.070
I think at some point if he could have said I've already
done that

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:16.470
he would have because

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.710
I would need sixty sometimes  a hundred
trials

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.850
the statistical significance

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:26.300
he would sip through the first dozen and even
twenty trials it was fun it was a new

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.840
project

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.150
and it then it was like hello

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:31.970
we've done this we've done this already don't
make me do it again

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:34.800
I boring

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:41.349
you described in your book which I must interject
is a wonderful book what a wonderful read

00:01:41.349 --> 00:01:45.869
in any event you you say that in
your years at purdue

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:50.939
you and Alex are like vagabonds as
I recall well we

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:54.230
we did not have our own lab space basically

00:01:54.230 --> 00:01:58.540
they shifted us from whatever was convenient
from one place to another

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:04.009
I I I think we had you know for at least three
maybe four different laboratories depending

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:06.300
on who needed what space

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:12.099
you know it's just okay whatever in as long
as you let me do the work

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:15.269
but it was really difficult because each time
we  moved the lab

00:02:15.269 --> 00:02:16.599
it interrupted

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:21.809
the training  and I would imagine
that it was difficult for alex initially to

00:02:21.809 --> 00:02:25.630
make those transitions am I wrong about
that no it was you know this a different space

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:28.609
is  it safe

00:02:28.609 --> 00:02:31.909
and it took him a while to to get used to
each space

00:02:31.909 --> 00:02:37.139
the test  for colors and shapes
tell the audience a little bit what that was

00:02:37.139 --> 00:02:38.040
all about

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.199
well the idea was could and animal understand

00:02:42.199 --> 00:02:45.649
categories  and categories in a hierarchical
sense

00:02:45.649 --> 00:02:49.939
the idea is not just that this is you know
what's green what is not green

00:02:49.939 --> 00:02:53.330
but that green and blue in yellow  formed a

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:53.909
category

00:02:53.909 --> 00:02:56.810
they could be lumped under the term color

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:01.699
and in other categories like two three four
five six that could be lumped under shape

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:04.879
and paper wood and rawhide under material

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:07.219
so the idea was learning categorical

00:03:07.219 --> 00:03:08.129
concept label

00:03:08.129 --> 00:03:09.669
color shape matter

00:03:09.669 --> 00:03:12.329
and then learning which colors went under
that

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:16.290
so that I could show him an object that had
color and shape and  material and say alex what's 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:17.689
this block

00:03:17.689 --> 00:03:19.139
what  color green

00:03:19.139 --> 00:03:20.809
what shape four  corner

00:03:20.809 --> 00:03:22.489
what matter wood
0:03:22.489,0:03:25.859
so he understood all those concepts and also
meant

00:03:25.859 --> 00:03:29.629
that I was getting away from rote responses

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:32.489
so that's when I showed him an object he never
knew what to say

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:38.429
 until he heard me ask the question

00:03:38.429 --> 00:03:43.800
that is significant  not simply
stimulus responds

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:48.750
oh I see this thing every time I see this
thing I say green  he had to think

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:53.579
 he had to wait for my question 

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:08.239
another particular comment that
alex sometimes would make was the use of I'm

00:04:08.239 --> 00:04:08.769
sorry

00:04:08.769 --> 00:04:14.539
 I can't wait to ask you this 
did he feel remorse there was no contrition
0:04:14.539,0:04:17.509
it was what he learned to defuse

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:19.470
a tense situation

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:23.229
it's the same thing that you see ritualized in
animals

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:26.900
where a dog  will will present its jugular as if
to say you know up

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:29.630
I I'm sorry you know kill me it's okay

00:04:29.630 --> 00:04:32.800
of course that difuses an aggressive

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:33.429
situation

00:04:33.429 --> 00:04:36.789
and so alex learned to say I'm sorry

00:04:36.789 --> 00:04:39.069
to do that and it it started because

00:04:39.069 --> 00:04:44.050
he was sitting on a perch and I had some 
 coffee and I wanted to go outside

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:45.089
for something

00:04:45.089 --> 00:04:46.370
and I put the

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:49.330
coffee cup away from where I thought he could
possibly get it

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:53.080
and I come back whatever it later and
there he is on the floor with the coffee cup

00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:55.229
in pieces all around him

00:04:55.229 --> 00:04:59.550
and of course the first response like any
mother type person you say AHH!

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:01.449
you know what happened how did you do that

00:05:01.449 --> 00:05:03.819
then you stop and go this is a bird

00:05:03.819 --> 00:05:07.849
 your you're ranting it's not his fault
this was an interesting thing he went to

00:05:07.849 --> 00:05:08.539
explore it

00:05:08.539 --> 00:05:12.199
he knocked it off the shelf then you are 
worried that he's hurt

00:05:12.199 --> 00:05:15.580
so you pick him up and say  I am sorry

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:19.580
and he put the two together and she's yelling
at me and she says I'm sorry

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:22.289
if I say  this she'll stop yelling at me

00:05:22.289 --> 00:05:25.629
wow

00:05:26.189 --> 00:05:28.229
what a great story

00:05:28.229 --> 00:05:32.610
if Texas law

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:33.389
before

00:05:33.389 --> 00:05:35.349
the patient

00:05:39.409 --> 00:05:41.839
it's the progress
