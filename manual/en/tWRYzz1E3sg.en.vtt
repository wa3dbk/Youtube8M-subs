00:00:10.969 --> 00:00:16.510
In Old Testament theology today, there is
an on-going discussion of whether there is

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:25.030
a center, that is, is there some common theme
that runs through the old testament's theological

00:00:25.030 --> 00:00:28.910
teachings and uniting them.

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:37.960
A good option that was presented now, ninety
years or so ago, was the idea of covenant.

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:46.010
But its hard to find covenant in Proverbs
or in Ecclesiastes or in many of the Prophets,

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:49.140
so umm maybe not.

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.370
And so it's gone on and on with a lot of different
suggestions.

00:00:54.370 --> 00:01:00.739
I think in the end probably the scholar Gerhard
Hasel made the best suggestion, that the center

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:04.000
of Old Testament theology is Yahweh.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.550
He is God.

00:01:05.550 --> 00:01:10.650
But there has been another proposal that I
think is very significant for us as we think

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:16.750
about Advent, and that is the promise.

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:23.290
Running right through the Old Testament is
a series of promises and fulfilments and each

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:29.680
fulfillment become in a sense another promise,
and on it goes and on it goes.

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:32.360
But is it just promises?

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.420
Or it is a promise.

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:43.620
Dr. Walter Kaiser has proposed that in fact
The Promise is the center of Old Testament

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:44.620
theology.

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:51.060
Well, i could raise a question or two about
that but I certainly agree that the promise

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:54.930
is the thread running through the Old Testament.

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.119
You say what promise?

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:01.630
The promise that begins already in Genesis
chapter three.

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:06.000
As God is speaking to Eve in her falling condition.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:14.960
And says that, her child will crush the head
of the serpent.

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:16.150
Let's very mysterious.

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:17.150
Who is that?

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:18.650
What are we talking about?

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:21.400
But then comes another promise.

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.099
In Genesis chapter twelve.

00:02:24.099 --> 00:02:29.690
When God says to Abram, I am going to give
you that baby you long for, and I am going

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:36.251
to give you that land that you long for, but
I am going to give you something else, your

00:02:36.251 --> 00:02:43.340
family will be a blessing to all the nations
of the earth.

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:45.099
Hm.

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:48.540
Your child will crush the serpent's head.

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:55.459
Your family will bless the world.

00:02:55.459 --> 00:03:00.750
By the time the Hebrew people entered Egypt.

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:06.680
They were seventy people and by the time they
left Egypt, they were a great nation.

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:08.390
That part of the promise had been fulfilled.

00:03:08.390 --> 00:03:12.000
They baby had come in Abram's own lifetime.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.890
The family had come by the time of the Exodus.

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:22.879
And when they got the land, it's as though
they sort of lost focus.

00:03:22.879 --> 00:03:28.129
Well we got what we came for, God, you can
go do some thing else now.

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:36.849
And instead of going forward, they were caught
in a downward spiral, that's the book of Judges.

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:39.160
What about that third promise?

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:45.250
Your family is going to be a blessing to all
the nations of the earth.

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:46.860
God made another promise.

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:49.540
A promise to David.

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:56.100
Like all good ancient near eastern Monarchs,
David decided that he wanted to build a monument.

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:59.540
He wanted to build a house to his God.

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:02.300
And God responded very strangely.

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:03.650
He said I don't need a house.

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:08.720
I have lived in a tent these hundred of years
and that has been fine.

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:15.030
But I tell you what, David, I'm going to make
a house for you.

00:04:15.030 --> 00:04:20.400
Your descendants are going to be on the throne
of Israel.

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.710
In blessing, forever.

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:26.389
Hm, yes.

00:04:26.389 --> 00:04:31.729
Now the people of Israel has regained focus
on the future.

00:04:31.729 --> 00:04:38.590
Oh, and it's amazing that the family of David
remained on the throne of Judah for three

00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:40.919
hundred fifty years.

00:04:40.919 --> 00:04:47.130
There are very, very few dynasties, perhaps
some in China, but very few dynasties that

00:04:47.130 --> 00:04:49.940
latest that long.

00:04:49.940 --> 00:04:52.960
The promise.

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:59.040
So its fascinating to look at the structure
of the book of the Old Testament.

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:06.060
The Pentateuch, first five books, ends with
a promise that there will be a prophet who

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:09.580
is greater than Moses.

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:16.460
The Historical Books in the Hebrew order,
the last book is Chronicles, and the book

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:25.740
of the Chronicles ends with Jehoiakim, the
last of the Davidic line, being taken out

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:32.160
of the prison, given a life time pension by
the king of Babylon.

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:39.690
Virtually all scholars are agreed that that
point is being made that somehow the Davidic

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:46.960
dynasty didn't die when Jerusalem was destroyed
and there were no more Davidic kings on the

00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:49.720
throne in Jerusalem.

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:52.330
It's the same in our English order.

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:54.199
What's the last book?

00:05:54.199 --> 00:05:55.520
Malachi.

00:05:55.520 --> 00:06:00.260
And Malachi is about the one who is to come.

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:06.199
The one who is the Lord and who is the messenger
of the Lord.

00:06:06.199 --> 00:06:12.759
The one who is the messenger of the covenant.

00:06:12.759 --> 00:06:17.350
The one who will come like the sun raising.

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:22.470
The sun that sucks the last moisture out of
the dying stubble.

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:29.979
But the sun that is a blessed healer for the
one who is wounded.

00:06:29.979 --> 00:06:37.180
And so running throughout the Old Testament
is this sense it's not over yet.

00:06:37.180 --> 00:06:39.830
It's not done yet.

00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:44.840
On one hand the Old Testament is a story of
tragedy.

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:50.979
The failure of the Hebrew people ever to be
able to keep their covenant with any consistency.

00:06:50.979 --> 00:06:54.820
Again, and again and again they fail.

00:06:54.820 --> 00:07:00.199
They go into exile and God in grace brings
them back.

00:07:00.199 --> 00:07:02.480
And they sin again.

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:09.770
But, but, the Old Testament is not only a
story of tragedy.

00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:15.190
It's a story of continuing hope- God is not
done with us.

00:07:15.190 --> 00:07:23.360
He is going to bring that promise, the child
who will crush the head of the serpent, the

00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:28.430
descendant who will be a blessing to all the
nations of the earth.

00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:35.910
The son of David who will rule in majesty
and faithfulness and unfailing love on the

00:07:35.910 --> 00:07:37.740
throne of David.

00:07:37.740 --> 00:07:40.710
The one who is to come.

00:07:40.710 --> 00:07:49.319
The Old Testament is a tragedy but it's also
a book of endless, glorious hope.

00:07:49.319 --> 00:08:03.020
He is coming.
