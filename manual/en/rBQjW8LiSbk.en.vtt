Hi, My name is Jenna Halfacre with Last Frontier Adventure Club

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:11.253
and today we're going to talk about The North Face Thermoball jacket

00:00:11.253 --> 00:00:16.761
Down is light and compressible, while synthetic insulation retains loft and is warmer when wet

00:00:16.761 --> 00:00:21.294
Companies have been trying to develop treatments for down that makes it more water repellant

00:00:21.294 --> 00:00:27.554
However The North Face has gone the other direction trying to make a lighter more compressible synthetic insulation

00:00:27.554 --> 00:00:31.694
The Thermoball jacket is available for men and women for about $200

00:00:31.694 --> 00:00:35.634
There are a variety of colors. And a hooded version if that's what you're looking for

00:00:35.634 --> 00:00:41.853
It's lightweight, averaging around 11 ounces. And compressible, stuffing into it's own stow pocket 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:52.534
So the main reason that someone would want to buy a Thermoball jacket is

00:00:52.534 --> 00:00:56.420
the claim that it stays much warmer while wet. The way we're going to test this is we're

00:00:56.420 --> 00:01:01.680
going to soak the thermoball and an 800 fill power down sweater in this bucket of water

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:04.794
Then we're going to walk a lap around the block and see which one stays warmer

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.200
First I'm going to try the down sweater and we'll see how that does

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:44.140
So it's very very cold. It's dripping all over me and it's not really doing much it's kind of like I'm wearing a thin layer of nylon

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.720
so hopefully we get better results with the next one

00:01:59.937 --> 00:02:02.417
And now switch out for the Thermoball

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:15.280
Right away just notice how much more puff it's retaining

00:02:18.394 --> 00:02:19.754
and thermoball is on

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:30.180
Very impressed actually. More than I thought I'd be. I'm not running to keep warm

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:37.173
It's much warmer, it's still chilly because my base layer is soaked, but it's much warmer than the down when wet

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:52.440
This one it was actually stealing the heat from me

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.473
I was warmer with it off 

00:02:54.473 --> 00:02:57.351
This one is keeping me quite a bit warmer than not having it

00:02:57.351 --> 00:02:59.355
it's actually getting quite warm

00:02:59.355 --> 00:03:05.174
So I'd say that The North Face's claim that Thermoball stays warmer when wet than down isn't just marketing hype

00:03:05.220 --> 00:03:07.300
Until next time, Happy Hiking!
