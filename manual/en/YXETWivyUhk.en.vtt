00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:06.810
My name is Cary Russell. I have a Masters
Degree in Landscape Ecology, so I'm standing

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:13.280
now next to a pine tree, whose common name
is Loblolly Pine, and the scientific name

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:19.660
is Pinus taeda. The way that you can identify
this tree, is first of all, by looking at

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:26.320
the needles. Pine trees leaves are called
needles, and they will come in fascicles,

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:33.070
which means bunches, and the Loblolly Pine
Tree, ninety nine percent of the time, will

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:38.020
have needles that come in fascicles of three,
and they're going to be about the length of

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:44.440
the average hand, so that's about perhaps,
five to six inches, Loblolly. Also, looking

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:50.650
around on the ground, here's a pine cone.
Over here, I'm going to walk away for a second.

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:56.280
For the most part, the average size of a Loblolly
Pine Cone, is going to be about the size of

00:00:56.280 --> 00:01:02.310
a baseball. This one is actually a little
bit small, and I attribute its size to the

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:08.590
fact that, these Loblolly pines are growing
in a much drier climate, than would be their

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:14.390
native home range, which would be further
to the east, and would also have at least

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:21.530
ten to fifteen additional inches of rain a
year, which is considerable, but this is also

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:28.380
probably the single most important commercial
species of pine tree in East Texas, which

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:33.760
is, that's an important part of the local
economy, and I think probably even in North

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:41.850
America now, this is a lot of your paper that
you use, comes from this particular tree.

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:49.040
Pine trees are conic, in their form, meaning
that the tree puts more energy into growing

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:55.760
up and straight, than it does, say, like a
rounded crown, like an oak tree would, or

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:02.090
a maple tree, that has a very rounded crown,
so these trees tend to be taller and straighter.

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.750
If you look though, up in the top of the canopy
though,you can see how there's a lot of branches

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:10.509
up there, and what that tells me when I'm
looking at it, is that when this tree was

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:16.319
younger, it didn't have a lot of competition,
which must admit, that it was growing like

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:22.200
in the middle of a pasture someplace, because
there wasn't a lot of pressure on it to grow

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:28.279
straight and narrow. It was able to grow outwards
,which tells me there wasn't a lot of light

00:02:28.279 --> 00:02:35.689
competition. If you look around at some of
the other trees, you won't see so many branches,

00:02:35.689 --> 00:02:41.249
or appendages like this, and chances are good,
that this is one of many that I see around

00:02:41.249 --> 00:02:48.000
us, that probably were the parent trees, that
seeded in the smaller trees, that you see

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:48.260
around us.
