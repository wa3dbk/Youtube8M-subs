JENNIFER CROW: Hi, this is Jennifer and I'm
the owner of wedgiewear.com, and we're here

00:00:03.229 --> 00:00:09.269
with Expert Village. Now, this is probably
the best time to add in your lining and if

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:14.130
you wanted to add lining or pads because all
you would have to do--it would cover up your,

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:22.370
kind of, your messes or whatever along that
line just to keep it cleaner. And so if you

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:30.100
did that, it would actually look like this,
and so how it cleans up the lines here and

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:40.630
it kind of flows it together. And so, this
time or like when you started before you did

00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:45.191
your first stitch up here would be also another
good time to add it, but I like to add it

00:00:45.191 --> 00:00:50.720
at the end. And the next thing that we can
is do the bottom since now we have our top

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:58.670
completed. When I get back on this machine
and do the elastic--again, you can do elastic

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:02.970
on the bottom or you don't have to. I like
the elastic just 'cause it kind of holds a

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:10.560
little bit better, but it's not really all
that necessary. But we can just start off

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:16.500
doing the elastic again, and the best place
you're going to do--because on this part,

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:22.140
the top of the bathing suit is where you're
going to put your band, so you don't even

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.560
want to touch that with elastic. You're just
going to start on the edges where it goes

00:01:27.560 --> 00:02:37.490
in. You're just going to cut off the elastic,
and then we just have the elastic piece. Then

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:51.151
you're going to do the same thing to the other
side. Okay, and now you have the other part

00:02:51.151 --> 00:02:51.559
of it.
