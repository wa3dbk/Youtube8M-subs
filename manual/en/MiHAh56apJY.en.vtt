00:00:10.539 --> 00:00:11.879
Hello today

00:00:11.879 --> 00:00:15.569
We're going to talk about some awesome features in Adobe illustrator

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:21.149
Which are the image trace and live paint bucket wellhow?

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:26.759
I'm going to show you today is going to be on some coloring book pages to start off

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:31.049
I'm going to show you this coloring book page of superman that I found on the [internet] and

00:00:31.689 --> 00:00:33.689
When it's all said [and] done

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:39.990
I'll show you how to effectively trace and color it in illustrator

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:49.470
Alright to start off once you have the coloring book page downloaded you're going to open it with Adobe illustrator

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:58.949
It pulls up and the first thing you're going to want to do is you notice the artboard is smaller than the image

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:00.220
so you're going to

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:02.369
go to the artboard tool and

00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:06.659
Adjust the size of the artboard to fit the image all in

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:11.350
then

00:01:11.350 --> 00:01:13.350
you select the image and

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:18.900
We're going to do the live the image trace first, so you go object

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:21.780
image trace make

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:29.129
Now you notice the graphic changed a little bit this gives you a little bit of preview before you do it

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:31.679
Well what you're going to do is?

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:36.030
go to the image Trace panel click on that and

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:39.389
This opens right here the image trace

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.860
Now I'm going to increase my threshold you now you notice

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:46.680
some Lines or

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:52.349
There's openings and gaps you don't want that when you do the live paint bucket tool

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.280
So I'm going to increase my threshold to about

00:01:57.190 --> 00:01:59.190
[230] for this one

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:01.440
different iMages May Vary

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:07.680
Now that looks like it might be too much, but I'm going to reduce the noise all the way down to one pixel

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:13.619
and increase my [paths] and Corners

00:02:17.739 --> 00:02:20.578
sometimes you want to add strokes and

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:27.839
Lower the stroke to like one pixel that adds more details now sometimes it helps sometimes it doesn't

00:02:29.109 --> 00:02:31.109
[I'm] going to lower my threshold

00:02:33.159 --> 00:02:37.858
It cut it cleans it up a little bit now once I have it looking the way. I want it

00:02:37.859 --> 00:02:39.859
I just click the expand button

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:46.829
now as you see all the anchor point it detects all the lines from the illustration and

00:02:47.079 --> 00:02:52.799
Creates all the Anchor points and curves, and that's it using the live trace. It's officially

00:02:53.349 --> 00:02:57.988
Transferred from a raster graphic with pixels to a vector graphic with the

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:00.840
Anchor points and coordinates

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:04.169
Now you can increase and decrease this image size

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:06.849
and

00:03:06.849 --> 00:03:08.999
It never [loses] quality

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:11.049
now

00:03:11.049 --> 00:03:17.638
You can click off of it to deselect it to do the [live] [paint] [bucket]. Tool you

00:03:18.909 --> 00:03:20.909
select the image and

00:03:21.129 --> 00:03:23.129
Then you either press K

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:24.729
or

00:03:24.729 --> 00:03:26.379
you go on

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:29.758
to your toolbar and choose the select live paint bucket

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:33.150
Now the first thing you want to do is

00:03:33.519 --> 00:03:38.819
you want to have some colors that you know you're going to use so you're going to go to your swatches Palette and

00:03:39.099 --> 00:03:41.099
then click the top, right

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:43.620
Open Swatch Library

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:49.769
Now you might go to coloring books and choose. There's different libraries of colors

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:57.299
Now this one seems to cover quite a bit now. I'm also going to go and open up the

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:01.560
skin tones

00:04:03.909 --> 00:04:06.629
Swatches you just choose the right tone

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:15.000
For the face now. I can't see very well with the [dot] so I'm gonna hold down command click away

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:24.379
There you go, and then you just select the area that you want to pay

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:29.480
Make his hair a little bit of a brown tint inside

00:04:33.540 --> 00:04:39.529
Now the cake. We know that's typically a red so

00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:44.690
Just select the areas

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:57.950
and make it red same with the s

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:06.950
yellow for inside The [s]

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:14.030
So yup Mr. Red there?

00:05:18.060 --> 00:05:24.470
Go back make the [yellow] belts yellow you can make the boots yellow or red

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:33.229
But that's it if you want to get more three-dimensional like I did [on] the first example

00:05:33.229 --> 00:05:36.109
I showed you you could go to the gradient [panel]

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:39.390
click on that and

00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:44.929
Let's say I want a gradient of the cake so I'm going to slide that red

00:05:45.419 --> 00:05:47.449
Put it over the the black

00:05:48.930 --> 00:05:50.930
and now

00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:55.700
Gives it a more of a three-dimensional looks like light

00:05:56.550 --> 00:06:00.020
Reflecting you can adjust these panels with more [cudmore]

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:06.680
colors take the white out make it darker be as creative as you want to be with it, but that's how you use the

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:10.700
image trace and [live] [paint] [bucket] [tool] in Adobe Illustrator

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:13.700
[when] it's all said and done

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:16.789
That's what it looks like when it's finished

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:27.360
you
