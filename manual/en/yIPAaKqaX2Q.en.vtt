00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:10.930
What's up everybody?
This is Betty and I've got

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:14.340
small, powerful and
energy efficient right here.

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:18.340
It's the Acer Aspire 
AX1200 Desktop PC.

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:20.770
It's a great solution, it's
a very powerful machine,

00:00:20.870 --> 00:00:25.180
it runs on a 4850EAMD 
Athlon X2 processor,

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:27.220
So it's got a 
pretty good processor,

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:30.100
you have 3GB
of DDR2 memory

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:33.810
and you've got a 
320GB Sata II hard drive.

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:37.080
It comes with a super multi
DVD player, so if you look

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:38.820
here in the front,
you can actually see

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:42.170
it's the Super Multi,
Dual Layer DVD drive,

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.770
you can burn DVD RWs,
RAMs, watch movies.

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.410
You also have a 12-in-1
Media Reader, it's all here

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:53.630
in the front if you can see,
let me move this over.

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:58.500
If you check out the front here
you see we have all kinds of-

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:01.340
We have fire wire, you've got 
your USB, your card readers,

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:04.160
your output jack, your 
headphone and microphone jacks

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:06.800
and then four more 
USB ports here.

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.770
If you go to the back here, let me
show you what we got in the back.

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:17.480
You have an expansion slot
up here so you can add anything

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.520
else you think you want 
to add to this machine,

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:23.050
although you do come really well
equipped with what come standard

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.570
here on the AX1200.
You can have your

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:28.720
modem connected here, 
if you move down

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:33.690
you have all your 5.1
audio capability jacks here.

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.240
You have your line in, your line
out another microphone jack

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:39.240
another speaker jack, so you
have a good amount of options.

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:41.750
You can actually hook up a 
pretty good sound system to this.

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:44.000
If you move down you have 
your ethernet port and then

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.760
like four more USB ports. 
Look around here, you've got

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:50.030
one, two, three four
and then your ESATA

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.770
cable port and then 
your VGA of course.

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:54.710
You also have another
expansion slot here,

00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:58.160
for any other kind of cable that
you want to hook up to here.

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:02.210
You have your eHDMI slot
and then your PS/2 ports

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:05.930
for your keyboard and your mouse.
And then of course, your cooling fan

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:08.870
and your power supply. 
Lets take a look inside

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:11.270
see what we have.
This machine is super compact

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.140
and you can even see it in
the design inside the computer.

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:17.900
You have your optical drive here,
standing and right behind it is the

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.750
hard drive, so you really don't 
have much more too add on

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:22.600
as far as hard drive space,
but why would you want to?

00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:25.540
You have 320G of 
SATA II hard drive space.

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:29.240
You also have your DDR2 memory,
which are both taken up so that

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:32.950
you have 3G of RAM in this machine
and then of course your heat sig. fan

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.630
it's all very very compact. 
This fan is actually quite big,

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:39.690
so you do get a very 
efficient cooling system

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:42.490
in such a compact design.
Then of course up here,

00:02:42.590 --> 00:02:45.280
you have your expansion slot
if you wanted to add another

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:48.960
little mini card to the machine.
Other than that, you have your

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:52.200
power supply unit down here 
and with this one central fan,

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:56.140
it actually keeps it all cool
and then of course the CPU

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:59.960
and PSU air holes on the side.
One more thing I wanted to

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:03.770
show you before we're done,
is the PCI slot up here, so you

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:07.660
do have PCI slot capabilities 
for your graphics card,

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:10.120
although I would be careful 
what kind of graphics card

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:11.900
you get with this, because 
it is a compact machine.

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:15.330
So again, if you're looking
for energy efficient compact

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:18.820
solution and powerful,
this is it, this is the

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:23.500
Acer Aspire AX1200, powered
with an AMD Athlon processor.

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:28.570
For more information on the 
Acer Aspire AX1200 Desktop PC,

00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:36.140
type in A180-1794 in the search box
of any of these fine retailer websites.

00:03:36.710 --> 00:03:38.880
For computertv,
I'm Betty.
