00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:38.200
Hi guys, back with me Dhara and... 

00:00:38.301 --> 00:00:39.701
... with me Pipi.

00:00:39.702 --> 00:00:43.802
Microsoft released Kinect for Xbox 360 last year.

00:00:43.803 --> 00:00:48.703
This sohisticated sensor camera allow you to play game without controller.

00:00:48.704 --> 00:00:51.320
That's right and you're the controller.

00:00:52.421 --> 00:00:58.611
Kinect became a big hit.
It's sold more than 10 millions less than a year.

00:00:58.612 --> 00:01:02.312
Yet there are not many games for Kinect on this year.

00:01:02.413 --> 00:01:09.313
But don't be disappointed because Microsoft demonstrated a lot of new games at the last E3.

00:01:10.314 --> 00:01:11.714
You're curious, aren't you, Dhara? 

00:01:11.715 --> 00:01:13.415
Yes, indeed.

00:01:14.916 --> 00:01:17.916
Better you set on your Kinect and...

00:01:17.917 --> 00:01:22.437
... we do warming up by playing Kinect games that had been released.

00:01:22.438 --> 00:01:25.738
These are top 5 Kinect games from Duniaku.

00:01:29.839 --> 00:01:32.419
On fifth rank we choose Joy Ride.

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:37.840
This is an interesting casual racing game and anyone can play this game.

00:01:38.541 --> 00:01:42.341
On this game, you feel like you're really driving a car.

00:01:42.942 --> 00:01:45.192
This game is good for you who learns to drive a car,

00:01:45.193 --> 00:01:47.893
especially someone like me who can't drive one.

00:01:49.194 --> 00:01:53.894
This game can be played by 8 persons all at once via Xbox life.

00:01:54.895 --> 00:01:59.595
This game has several pretty varied mode which are "Race",

00:01:59.596 --> 00:02:01.896
"Mario Cart Battle Race ",

00:02:01.897 --> 00:02:03.717
 "1 on 1 Drag Race",

00:02:03.718 --> 00:02:06.368
 "Stunt (acrobatic movements)",

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:10.169
and the one I like very much, "Free Style". 

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:13.570
Let's see riddiculuos actions of Edo and Hendy.

00:02:13.971 --> 00:02:19.471
You also can upload your photo and share it on facebook and twitter directly.

00:02:19.472 --> 00:02:23.242
Next, on 4th position we have "Virtual Tennis 4".

00:02:23.943 --> 00:02:27.833
This game indeed isn't luxurious for Xbox 360.

00:02:28.434 --> 00:02:33.424
Nonetheless SEGA wanted to show motion control feature in this game.

00:02:34.325 --> 00:02:38.125
On PS3 this game can be played on your playstation,

00:02:38.926 --> 00:02:40.826
on Wii you can play it using Wii Mode,

00:02:41.527 --> 00:02:44.797
and on 360 using Kinect of course.

00:02:45.498 --> 00:02:48.328
With Kinect, you'll feel more freedom.

00:02:48.529 --> 00:02:53.029
Moreover this game has joint viewpoint.

00:02:53.930 --> 00:02:55.900
1st person when the ball coming near, 

00:02:56.401 --> 00:02:59.211
and 3rd person when the opponent has the ball.

00:02:59.212 --> 00:03:01.232
Just swing your arms.

00:03:02.133 --> 00:03:03.233
For smash....

00:03:05.134 --> 00:03:07.934
yaahh.... not that SM*SH,

00:03:07.935 --> 00:03:10.445
Don't forget to jump when you smash the ball.

00:03:11.546 --> 00:03:16.486
Unfortunately, unlike its predecessor, this game doesn't support 4 players all at once.

00:03:16.487 --> 00:03:18.747
On 3rd position we have "Child of Eden".

00:03:19.248 --> 00:03:22.818
The opening for this game is worthy to appreciate because it's so beautiful.

00:03:22.819 --> 00:03:24.199
Just take a look at it.

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:30.120
This game was designed by Tetsuya Mizuguchi, best known for "Rez".

00:03:30.121 --> 00:03:33.421
"Child of Eden" is a sequel of "Rez".

00:03:34.422 --> 00:03:39.552
On this game you role as antivirus that will save Lumi.

00:03:39.553 --> 00:03:40.863
Who is Lumi?

00:03:40.864 --> 00:03:43.394
She is the beautiful girl you looked at the opening of this game.

00:03:44.555 --> 00:03:46.805
The gameplay of this game is quite innovative.

00:03:46.806 --> 00:03:50.516
You aim then shoot with both of your hands.

00:03:50.517 --> 00:03:52.617
It's very cool.

00:03:52.618 --> 00:03:54.418
You can take it like Dragon Ball.

00:03:55.119 --> 00:03:58.809
This game is worthy to play because it won many awards,

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:03.210
such as "Best Motion Sensor Game" from GameSpot,

00:04:03.411 --> 00:04:06.451
"Best New IP" from Game Trailers,

00:04:06.452 --> 00:04:10.422
and "Best Rhythm Game of E3 2010".

00:04:10.423 --> 00:04:14.923
Try it by yourself and you'll see how innovative this game can be.

00:04:16.924 --> 00:04:18.974
"Kinnect Sports" is our runner up.

00:04:18.975 --> 00:04:21.969
This game is indeed exciting and competitive.

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:26.420
You have many choices such as "Bowling".

00:04:27.621 --> 00:04:31.121
Standard ten pins bowling is played from 1st person viewpoint.

00:04:31.922 --> 00:04:35.765
This game will get more exciting when you play it with your friends (up to 4 persons).

00:04:37.766 --> 00:04:39.766
The second game is "Boxing".

00:04:40.267 --> 00:04:43.667
This game only has 3 rounds. 

00:04:44.768 --> 00:04:46.568
You can play it either online,

00:04:46.570 --> 00:04:49.855
split screen or against computer.

00:04:50.656 --> 00:04:54.156
Trust me, this game can make your arms cramps.

00:04:55.457 --> 00:04:57.097
The third game is "Table Tennis".

00:04:57.098 --> 00:05:00.198
You can play it in either single or double.

00:05:00.199 --> 00:05:05.649
I think when you play this game in double mode, it gets more exciting. 

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:09.310
The 4th game is "Soccer".

00:05:09.611 --> 00:05:14.845
Most of the movements you play it automatically, so I think this game isn't very exciting.

00:05:15.847 --> 00:05:20.957
You only have two options, feed the ball to your friends or shoot it directly to the wicket.

00:05:21.458 --> 00:05:23.608
However, this game is still rather entertaining.

00:05:24.909 --> 00:05:26.879
Next game is "Beach Volleyball".

00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:32.398
Such as "Table Tennis", you can play this game in either single or double.

00:05:33.399 --> 00:05:36.109
I love the scenery of the beach on this game.

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:41.110
It reminds me of "Death or Alive Beach Volleyball".

00:05:42.611 --> 00:05:44.674
The last one is "Track and Field".

00:05:45.675 --> 00:05:47.625
This is the main menu of "Kinect Sports".

00:05:47.626 --> 00:05:49.126
You can play sprint,

00:05:49.727 --> 00:05:50.687
javelin throw,

00:05:50.688 --> 00:05:51.688
long jump,

00:05:51.689 --> 00:05:53.419
discus throw,

00:05:53.420 --> 00:05:54.460
and hurdles.

00:05:55.461 --> 00:05:59.121
Play this game with your friends and that will be more exciting.

00:05:59.122 --> 00:06:06.782
Just like "Joy Ride", you can share video on facebook, twitter and even youtube.

00:06:06.783 --> 00:06:07.903
Exciting, isn't it?!

00:06:09.904 --> 00:06:12.204
And our winner is... 

00:06:12.205 --> 00:06:16.695
... the best dance game ever, "Dance Central".

00:06:17.296 --> 00:06:19.846
Playing this game will be the same as doing excercise...

00:06:19.847 --> 00:06:24.747
... because the whole of your body has to move to follow the character's movements.

00:06:25.348 --> 00:06:28.708
So you don't need to spend your time attending aerobic class.

00:06:28.709 --> 00:06:33.699
Other than playing it in single mode you can also play it in battle dance mode.

00:06:33.909 --> 00:06:36.369
The songs on this game are pretty new songs.

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:40.060
However, if you're bored with the songs that already exist,

00:06:40.061 --> 00:06:42.247
you can download new songs via internet.

00:06:42.248 --> 00:06:44.698
So, let's dance guys.

00:06:55.499 --> 00:06:57.399
Wow... The games on Kinect is really exciting, isn't it?!

00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:02.290
Still it can't be compared to the new games that are ready to release.

00:07:02.291 --> 00:07:04.791
So guys, check it out and see you next week.

00:07:04.792 --> 00:07:05.792
Bye..!!
