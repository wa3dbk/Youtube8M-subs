00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:19.680
I'm second on the grid again.

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:23.800
I'm last, so if I finish last, I shouldn't be ashamed, I guess.

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:25.560
Lights are now red...

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.080
...and... Off!

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.080
There's someone stalling on the grid.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.360
I'm approaching the corner.

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.560
I'm braking and as expected I'm going to get hit.

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:41.040
I see lots of people off track. The handling feels very good...

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:44.240
Perhaps I should have set the traction control to maximum.

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:49.880
I immediately feel that I can't easily put the power of the car on the tarmac.

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:52.040
Meanwhile I'm in fifth.

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.920
Just imagine: I spun, started in eighth, but now I'm fifth.

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:00.640
I'm now going to attack the kerbs agressively. It goes pretty well.

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.520
They told us you can attack the kerbs more agressively. Turns out to be true.

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.360
The person in first is a second ahead.

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:19.280
As soon as you go off track, it's very hard to correct.

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:23.080
In the previous game, the car would simply slow down a lot.

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:29.640
I found it a very nice game to play.

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:33.200
It's so close to reality, although I'm not sure what that is.

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:38.160
But I'm getting the feeling that I'm driving an F1 car. It's brilliant.

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.560
Speaking in general, it is the same game.

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:48.920
But if you look closely, lots of things that weren't good have been fixed.

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:51.160
It's another step closer to reality.

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:52.760
I'm already getting that feeling.

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:56.000
How bad it must feel when victory literally is in front of you.

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:57.800
You can see it...

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:00.720
...but you can't touch or smell it.

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:06.800
I unfortunately can't use my DRS, because there is no one ahead.

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:12.320
But I do notice it's harder to brake than in the previous version.

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:15.720
I could lose the car under braking.

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:20.000
The gap is 1.5 seconds. Another improvement over F1 2010.

00:02:20.320 --> 00:02:25.920
It's very clear how far someone is ahead or behind. It used to be a big complaint.

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:27.600
Much better.

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:33.120
Despite the tyres getting temperature, I feel they're wearing off and I'm missing the apex.

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.280
It feels better than F1 2010.

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.760
We've seen multiplayer...

00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.600
...but no splitscreen, no co-op...

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.880
Safety Car is new too, but haven't seen it.

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.720
So that makes it a bit hard to judge the game.

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:50.760
We've seen a lot of things that were improved over F1 2010.

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:55.800
But it's a shame we haven't seen all the new headline features.

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.880
Careful now, because there are people in front impeding me.

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.640
But what a great game this is. Unbelievable.

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.880
It's very exhausting. I'm sweating everywhere.

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.840
It's hard to concentrate with all the noise and it's hard anyway.

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.080
And then this steering wheel. Look at it.

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.640
It's heavy. Now it weighs nothing, but...

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:21.360
...you don't need to go to the gym when you play this game. Incredible.

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:24.280
I thought F1 2010 was very sober.

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:30.320
Now, after a race, you see someone jumping out of the car with joy.

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:33.880
You're not only driving some car, you're also doing this for the party afterwards.

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:35.680
So... buying it?

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:37.800
Yes.

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:42.320
I'm looking forward to the new features and improvements.

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:45.440
I think it's worth it to buy the game.
