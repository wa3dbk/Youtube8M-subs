bob.

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:16.750

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:25.050
You will need Stylist Shampoo and conditioner
Anti-frizz balm Texturizing cream Blow dryer

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.779
Paddle brush Hair wax or pomade and finishing
spray or hairspray.

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.480
Step 1.

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:34.890
Ask your stylist for a modified pixie cut.

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:39.120
Have them add sharp layers along your neck
and increase the length as you move toward

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.350
the top of the head and the fringe area.

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:45.390
The ends may be lightly texturized with a
razor for a sculpted look.

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.160
Consult your stylist about how to make subtle
alterations to Posh's cut that best suit your

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.010
facial features and hair texture.

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:56.090
This cut works well on all hair types, including
fine and thick hair.

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:57.350
Step 2.

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:01.260
Wash your hair with shampoo and follow with
a conditioner suited to your hair type.

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:04.010
Towel-dry your hair when you're finished.

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:05.010
Step 3.

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:08.210
Apply an anti-frizz balm and a light texturizing
cream to your hair.

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:12.680
Blow dry your hair upside down to add volume
around the lower areas, while drying the upper

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.290
sections while using a paddle brush to keep
them straight and smooth.

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:21.150
Get regular trims every four to six weeks
to maintain the style, as shorter hair requires

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:23.060
more maintenance.

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:24.060
Step 4.

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:28.479
Apply a small amount of pomade or wax to spike
up the shorter pieces when your hair is dry.

00:01:28.479 --> 00:01:33.070
Put a dollop of product between your hands
and rub them together to soften the wax.

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:36.570
Use your fingers to pull the strands into
position.

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:37.869
Step 5.

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:42.080
Finish off with a glossy finishing spray or
hair spray to control frizz and fly-aways.

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:45.220
Touch up your 'do throughout the day to maintain
the look.

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:48.890
Dark sunglasses and an intense pout are optional.

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:55.009
Did you know In the 1920s, women styled their
bobs with a Marcel iron, a curling iron without

00:01:55.009 --> 00:01:56.009
a spring.

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.929
This look came to be known as the Marcel Wave.
