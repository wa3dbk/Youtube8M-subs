Hey guys what's up? Louix94 here and today I'll be showing you how to jailbreak your iPhone 3G 
 or iPod touch 2G running iOS version 4. This will not work on any other models. 

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:24.300
Okay, before we start, I want you to first put your iDevice in DFU Mode, and if you don't know how 
 to do this, just watch the next clip a couple of times and you'll be okay. Just read the instructions.

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:18.720
Okay, so right now I want you to unzip the redsn0w file...

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.920
... then open the folder, then open the redsn0w program.

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.500
Okay, then click 'Browse'...

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:39.800
... then in the 'File name' box, type "%appdata%" (without quotes).

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.280
Then press enter.

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:57.960
Okay then open the 'Apple Computer' folder, then 'iTunes', then 'iPhone Software Updates'...

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:00.120
If you have an iPod, then it will be under 'iPod Software Updates'.

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.720
Okay, and then open the 4.0 software file.

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.080
Okay and then click 'Next'.

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:38.520
Okay, and then tick the boxes on the screen; if you have an iPhone 3G, 
 I recommend unticking 'Enable homescreen wallpaper', because it really does slow the SpringBoard down.

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.720
And then tick/untick whatever else you want, and then press 'Next'.

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:47.240
Now we're already in DFU mode so just press 'Next'.

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:53.760
... and let it do its thing.

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:16.920
Okay and this will reboot now...

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:41.080
It will do this for about a minute...

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.200
(so I'll pause the video).

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:00.840
(Apple logo).

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:09.280
Okay, so slide to unlock...

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:24.960
Now you can see, if we double-press the Home button, you can see the little multitasking thing pops 
 up, and you can see that on the second page of the SpringBoard we also have Cydia.

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:28.820
So let's just test out multitasking...

00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:38.680
(open Notes).

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:58.770
Okay, if you double-press the Home button, you can see Settings is right 
 there, and you can switch back right where you left off.

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:05.480
So that's how you jailbreak an iPhone 3G or iPod touch 2G, I hope you
