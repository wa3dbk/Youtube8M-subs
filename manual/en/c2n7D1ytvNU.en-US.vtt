00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:18.730
The next night started as an ordinary Friday
evening, even though it was the last time

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:24.689
Mr. and Mrs. Darling saw their three children
for a very long time. They were dressing for

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:31.189
a dinner party, and Mrs. Darling was helping
her husband tie his bow tie. She looked splendid

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:36.399
in her white evening gown and a necklace George
had given her. She told her husband about

00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:42.039
seeing Peter in the nursery the night before.
When she described how Nana had caught his

00:00:42.039 --> 00:00:47.800
shadow, Mr. Darling laughed at the story.
But when she took him to the nursery and showed

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:54.289
him the shadow, which she had carefully folded
and put in a drawer, he almost believed her.

00:00:54.289 --> 00:01:00.339
Meanwhile, Nana was getting the children ready
for bed. As the baby of the family, Michael

00:01:00.339 --> 00:01:07.260
sometimes made a fuss. "I won't take a bath!
I won't! And I won't go to bed!" he would

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:14.260
shout. Tonight, when it came time for his
medicine, Michael refused to take it.

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:19.800
Michael ran from the bathroom into the nursery,
and Nana followed with his spoonful of medicine

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:25.820
held carefully between her teeth. John and
Wendy were right behind. When Mr. and Mrs.

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:30.580
Darling saw the problem, Mrs. Darling went
straight to the kitchen for a chocolate to

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:37.290
sweeten the taste of the medicine.
Mr. Darling was much more strict. "Be brave!"

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:43.930
he commanded Michael. "When I was your age,
I took medicine without a word. I even thanked

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:48.500
my parents for giving me medicine to make
me well."

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:55.360
Trying to be helpful, Wendy interrupted, "You
still take medicine too, don't you, Father?"

00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:01.220
It was true. And even though Mr. Darling wanted
Michael to be brave, it was also true that

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:06.060
he didn't like his medicine. He often found
reasons not to take it.

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:12.840
"It's much nastier than Michael's!" he said.
"And, if I hadn't lost the bottle, I would

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:18.829
take it now to show you how I do it, Michael."
In fact, Mr. Darling hadn't actually lost

00:02:18.829 --> 00:02:22.909
the medicine. He had hidden the bottle at
the back of the medicine cabinet.

00:02:22.909 --> 00:02:29.909
"I know where it is, Father," said Wendy.
She was always a helpful daughter. "I'll bring

00:02:30.579 --> 00:02:36.549
it to you." She ran off before he could stop
her. Wendy returned with the medicine in a

00:02:36.549 --> 00:02:41.790
glass. It was a white liquid that looked like
milk.

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:47.629
Mr. Darling shuddered when he saw it. "Michael
first," he said.

00:02:47.629 --> 00:02:54.629
"Father first," responded Michael.
"It isn't fair," Mr. Darling complained. "There

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.859
is more medicine in my glass than in Michael's
spoon."

00:02:57.859 --> 00:03:04.700
"Father, I am waiting for you," said Michael
suspiciously.

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:11.280
Wendy made a suggestion. "Why not take your
medicines at the same time?" She counted to

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:18.280
three: "One, two, three, go!"
Michael took his medicine, but Mr. Darling

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:26.340
hid his glass behind his back.
Michael let out a yell. "Not fair!"

00:03:26.430 --> 00:03:30.950
Wendy cried, "Oh Father, I can't believe you
did that!"

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:36.999
"Well, I meant to take mine, but I . . . I
missed it," Father said.

00:03:36.999 --> 00:03:43.189
John looked at his father sadly, and Nana
left the room in disgust.

00:03:43.189 --> 00:03:48.040
Mr. Darling knew he had disappointed his children.
He didn't like the way they were looking at

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:55.040
him. "Let's play a joke on Nana," he suggested.
"I will pour my medicine into Nana's bowl.

00:03:56.139 --> 00:04:03.139
She will think it is milk. What fun!" he said,
trying to be playful as he poured the medicine.

00:04:04.010 --> 00:04:10.849
When Nana returned, he patted her on the head.
"Good dog," he said. "Have a little milk from

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:15.849
your bowl, Nana."
Nana wagged her tail and began to lap up the

00:04:15.849 --> 00:04:21.160
liquid. The children were shocked at their
father's sense of humor. They didn't think

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:27.160
his joke was funny at all. When the medicine
was all gone, Nana shook her big head and

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:32.450
crept into her doghouse to lie down. She did
not look well.

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:38.690
Mrs. Darling came back to a silent room. She
looked at the unhappy group and the sick dog.

00:04:38.690 --> 00:04:41.410
Then she picked up Nana's bowl and sniffed
it.

00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:48.410
"George, it's your medicine! How could you!"
she cried.
