Hi, this is Leah Schaefer on behalf of Expert
Village and today I’m going to show you

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:11.599
how to cook with a Dutch oven. Okay, so it’s
starting to turn really light brown so I’m

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:16.309
going to turn it down so it doesn’t burn
and we’re going to add more butter now to

00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:22.460
start to make the roux, which is the base
kind of, of the cheese sauce we’re going

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:38.130
to do. Just add that, okay now we’ll add
some flour, and we’re going to let the flour

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:48.270
cook, you have to let the flour cook so that
it doesn’t have kind of a raw flour flavor

00:00:48.270 --> 00:01:02.579
to it. Just stir it up; okay, looking good
and we’ll add a little bit of milk. I use

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.890
skim milk because I like to keep it as light
as I can, but whatever milk you have on hand

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:23.610
is fine. Use about four or so tablespoons,
okay, you can go ahead and turn it off now,

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:31.320
the skillet is hot enough now that it’s
going to keep that heat. See how it’s thickening

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:37.799
up? That’s from the flour and the butter
cooking together and we’ll add a little

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:55.070
bit more milk now that it’s thick. And we’ll
just let that cook for a couple of more minutes

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:59.570
to thicken back up again. Okay, so we’ve
let it cook for a few more minutes and it’s

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:03.670
a really nice thick consistency, we’re going
to go ahead and add the rest of the milk,

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:17.340
we’ll add about a cup and a half now.

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:22.980
Okay, now if I were baking or anything I would
definitely use an actual liquid measuring

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:37.730
cup, but since this is a rustic dish, it’s
not quite as precise. You just stir it up,

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:49.550
we’ll turn it up to low medium again and
we’ll just let that, let that cook.
