Hello Smokey Bear
and Happy Birthday!

00:00:04.606 --> 00:00:08.036
I'm Joe Acaba, Expedition
32 Flight Engineer,

00:00:08.036 --> 00:00:09.596
on the International
Space Station.

00:00:10.176 --> 00:00:13.196
It is your 68th birthday and
what a journey it has been.

00:00:13.726 --> 00:00:17.866
Since 1944 you have supported
the education of generations

00:00:17.866 --> 00:00:21.406
of Americans about the critical
role in wildfire prevention

00:00:21.736 --> 00:00:24.716
through your message, "Only
You Can Prevent Wildfires."

00:00:25.336 --> 00:00:27.146
I understand there
will be many ways

00:00:27.146 --> 00:00:30.136
in which you will celebrate your
birthday this year outreaching

00:00:30.136 --> 00:00:32.166
to communities across
United States.

00:00:32.936 --> 00:00:35.756
We have been working on
the ISS to position you

00:00:35.896 --> 00:00:38.786
and your support network
by taking imagery of fires

00:00:38.786 --> 00:00:41.016
from space and studying
the behavior

00:00:41.016 --> 00:00:42.646
of fire in microgravity.

00:00:43.226 --> 00:00:46.916
It is exciting news that
NASA Johnson Space Center has

00:00:46.916 --> 00:00:50.206
extended a special invitation
for you to visit the center

00:00:50.206 --> 00:00:53.616
on your birthday to learn
more about human spaceflight

00:00:53.956 --> 00:00:57.296
and the work being done
on the ISS to enable us

00:00:57.346 --> 00:01:00.396
to explore the universe, as
well as gaining knowledge

00:01:00.736 --> 00:01:02.086
for the benefit of all people

00:01:02.476 --> 00:01:03.976
and the protection
of life on earth.

00:01:04.476 --> 00:01:05.806
So please enjoy your day.

00:01:06.926 --> 00:01:09.026
NASA looks forward to
sharing your message

00:01:09.026 --> 00:01:11.566
about being responsible
when using fire

00:01:11.806 --> 00:01:14.116
and to prevent human-caused
wildfires.

00:01:14.666 --> 00:01:17.606
As the talisman of our Soyuz
flight you have been a critical

00:01:17.606 --> 00:01:21.926
member of our team from blastoff
on May 15 in Kazakhstan to now.

00:01:22.766 --> 00:01:25.586
Through our partnership together
I'm pleased to be a part

00:01:25.746 --> 00:01:27.646
of raising awareness
for people everywhere

00:01:27.896 --> 00:01:29.336
about wildfire prevention.

00:01:29.956 --> 00:01:33.076
And I would like to take
this opportunity to recognize

00:01:33.076 --> 00:01:36.466
that you are managed by the U.S.
Forest Service in cooperation

00:01:36.466 --> 00:01:39.016
with the National
Association of State Foresters

00:01:39.386 --> 00:01:41.966
and the Ad Council,
an organization

00:01:41.966 --> 00:01:45.226
that improves change
and improves lives.

00:01:45.826 --> 00:01:48.526
Thank you for all you do
and again Happy Birthday.

00:01:49.016 --> 00:01:57.036
I wish you all the best in your
next 68 years of public service.
