series of plush toys they're like really
soft teddy bear type toys that look like

00:00:19.350 --> 00:00:25.590

we have the tyrannosaurus rex he looks

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:31.199
really cute and we have the Mosasaurus
so i'm gonna go ahead and remove these

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:35.540
tags and then we'll take a look at them

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.130
you

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:06.170
okay let's go ahead and take a look at
the t-rex first I mean he is really cute

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:11.330
I'm if you see from the size of my hand
he's a decent size and if I hold him in

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:17.240
my palm so here's a cute little plush
toy he's got like yellow eyes

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:22.330
he's got they did a good job with
drawing his teeth in there he's like

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:29.720
it's like a lighter brown color so it's
a really cool color for teddy bear toy

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:35.630
that he's got the Jurassic world logo
here on his stomach they did like it's

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:41.840
almost like a tan color it's in the
light it looks a little similar to grey

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:47.660
but it's it's like almost like a grayish
tan and then his uh his feet are really

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:55.310
cute they got a dark grey for his claws
on his feet and then going down the

00:01:55.310 --> 00:02:01.840
other side I mean there's no logos here
but he is super soft I mean this is like

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:09.920
pajama soft so it really is like a toy
for little kids too so I mean this would

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:15.830
be a good toy like your children could
carry around with them you know bring

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:21.260
with them bedtime and my kids really
like these too they're gonna have a lot

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:26.870
of fun with them and then you got the
Mosasaurus the Mosasaurus is really cute

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:32.510
I mean look at him he's got like his the
way they drew the teeth in there it

00:02:32.510 --> 00:02:38.690
looks really funny then he's got big
yellow eyes with black irises he's got

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:44.420
cute little flippers here and back here
then he's got the Jurassic world logo

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:51.470
sewed in the side there he's got a nice
nice long tail it's like inverted where

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:55.970
the flipper is down
I believe that's normal for the

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:00.110
Mosasaurus there because this would be
more like a shark and then that would be

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:04.700
down for the Mosasaurus
then in the front he's got two little

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:10.010
nostrils and then you can see his teeth
in the front and the side also is yellow

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:14.050
eye then he's got a little gray fin on
top and

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:20.530
huh yes cute this little guy is really
cool and then the bottom is like the

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:26.860
light blue color you can see like the
stitches here but other than that these

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:31.660
