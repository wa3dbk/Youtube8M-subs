00:00:02.586 --> 00:00:06.980
With ArchiCAD 18 there are some major changes to consider when lighting your project:

00:00:08.894 --> 00:00:11.253
'Light Cone Down'

00:00:11.253 --> 00:00:12.821
'Light Cone Up'

00:00:12.821 --> 00:00:15.259
'Wall Light Indirect'

00:00:15.259 --> 00:00:21.689
and 'Wall Light Upwards' have been removed and from now on can be fully replaced by the redesigned Spot Light

00:00:23.123 --> 00:00:28.483
and the new IES Light that have all the necessary properties to be used with the new CineRender engine.

00:00:30.098 --> 00:00:37.262
When opening a project made with a previous version of ArchiCAD, ArchiCAD 18, in some cases, will display a Warning dialog.

00:00:41.405 --> 00:00:46.326
By clicking on 'Skip Migration' old light sources as Library elements will be kept.

00:00:50.031 --> 00:00:53.220
Here's how our light sources will be rendered in this case.

00:00:54.473 --> 00:00:57.580
If you click on 'Migrate ArchiCAD Libraries'

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:02.761
old library elements will be converted to matching light sources from the ArchiCAD 18 Library.

00:01:04.241 --> 00:01:09.832
In this case all lamps became 'Spot lights' after conversion and will render like this.

00:01:09.832 --> 00:01:13.067
It may look worse at a first glance,

00:01:13.067 --> 00:01:17.402
but we can achieve a far better result converting them manually to IES Lights.

00:01:18.175 --> 00:01:23.943
Photometric definitions of IES Lights can be downloaded from websites of major light manufacturers.

00:01:27.494 --> 00:01:32.778
Simply put, these IES files contain the emission behavior of the light source.

00:01:32.778 --> 00:01:38.115
The downloaded IES files have to be added to the project using the Library Manager.

00:01:40.152 --> 00:01:47.952
Once the IES files are added to the project they can be chosen by clicking on this arrow.

00:01:51.142 --> 00:01:54.708
As you can see, the Light Settings tab is completely redesigned,

00:01:54.708 --> 00:02:02.522
and offers a wide variety of adjustments, often illustrated with sample pictures of what a particular setting will result in.

00:02:15.107 --> 00:02:17.197
Feel free to experiment with these.

00:02:17.197 --> 00:02:23.653
In the case of IES Light however the following settings will be sufficient in the majority of cases:

00:02:26.508 --> 00:02:28.355
'Main Intensity'

00:02:29.641 --> 00:02:31.306
'Color'

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:36.730
and 'Use Intensity given in Photometric File'

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:42.328
Here are a few examples of the great results IES Light can offer

00:02:43.703 --> 00:02:50.073
And here's another set of lights where we used IES files that include data regarding the Area Shape.

00:02:50.073 --> 00:02:54.413
As you can see, the shape of the Light source is visible in the render image.

00:02:55.750 --> 00:03:01.671
Please note, this additional data that enables showing the 'Area Shape' is rarely embedded in the IES file.

00:03:01.671 --> 00:03:05.745
Let's try one of the IES Lights from the previous example.

00:03:05.745 --> 00:03:09.694
We will use the one on the right wall in a real-life project.

00:03:11.188 --> 00:03:15.659
We already have a few IES Lights prepared with default settings,

00:03:15.659 --> 00:03:21.169
but first let's take a look at what the rendered image of the house looks like without IES Lights.

00:03:26.753 --> 00:03:30.185
Now, let's see how they contribute to the scene when turned ON.

00:03:34.248 --> 00:03:37.561
The IES Lights are a bit high so we will have to lower them,

00:03:37.561 --> 00:03:43.361
but in general we can say the use of IES Lights have a great impact on realism when rendering a project.
