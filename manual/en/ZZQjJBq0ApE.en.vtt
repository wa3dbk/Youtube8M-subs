Cheers! To an early spring, hopefully

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:15.750
Alright guys, so every year in Japan, near the springtime

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:20.280
Starbucks Japan comes out with their Sakura drink line

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.100
Sakura is "cherry blossom" for those of you that don't know

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:29.740
I just went to Starbucks and picked up my first sakura drink of the year

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:30.940
So let's check it out!

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:33.100
Every year they have something slightly different

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.740
This year is a caramel sakura drink

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.940
I got the hot version, so I hope it's yummy!

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:54.180
Alright guys, cheers! To an early Spring, hopefully!

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.490
That's so good! That's so much better than last year

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:10.139
Mmm caramel and sakura is a really good combination I think

00:01:10.649 --> 00:01:14.149
I can't remember what the one last year was, but it was way too sweet and I didn't really like it

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.260
This one has white chocolate, caramel and sakura flavour

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.430
There's no coffee in here, so it's like a heated milk

00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:29.740
with a subtle sakura flavour and it's pretty sweet

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.570
for those of you that don't know what sakura tastes like, I guess it's similar to a cherry flavour

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:36.140
There's something a little different about it

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.600
But it's not really a flavour that you can explain, you kinda just have to try it

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:47.049
Mmm this one is good, I definitely recommend this year's sakura latte

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:47.800
Yummy :)

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.540
and I also got a cake because it looked
amazing!

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:55.320
They have sakura chiffon cake this year

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:57.140
So let me show that to you

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.340
Doesn't that look delicious?!

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:02.340
Oh my goodness~ 

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:07.500
And it has a real sakura flower on the top, I think it's pickled

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.100
I can't wait! This looks so good. 

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:14.760
This is the cold version, the frappuccino version

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:21.080
Look at the cute little cup that it comes in! You can see the sakura syrup all through it

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.960
and the chocolate flakes on top

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.100
That one looks so good too

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:34.300
Alright guys, here we go, my first ever sakura chiffon cake! Itadakimasu!

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:45.529
This one tastes a lot more like cherries
than the drink does

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:49.000
I would say this is more of a cherry flavour than a sakura flavour

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:53.969
Yeah it reminds me of a cherry candy

00:02:55.980 --> 00:02:58.540
Mmm that's so good!

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:04.720
Light and fluffy and not super sweet, yeah tastes like a cherry cake!

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:06.700
So good

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:14.980
Let's try the sakura flower from the top of the cake!

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:22.410
Oo~ it's so salty! Holy crap

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:26.300
Wasn't expecting that, kinda tastes like a pickle o_o; 

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:28.540
Weird

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:35.360
Once you get to the end of chewing it and you mix it with some icing it's okay, but holy crap

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:36.540
That tasted like a pickle, what the hell... 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:41.240
Well this year's sakura drink is a definite thumbs up from me

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.360
This is delicious, I love it!

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:45.920
Definitely go try it out if you're in Japan in the spring

00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:52.720
It's not even March yet and they've started it, I think these will be available until probably the end of April

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:54.460
I hope you enjoyed this video and I will see you soon!

00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:55.780
Thanks for watching, bye!
