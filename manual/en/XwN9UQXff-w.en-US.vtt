00:00:26.151 --> 00:00:28.445
Everything, every scene

00:00:28.486 --> 00:00:29.154
especially heavy scenes,

00:00:29.195 --> 00:00:31.990
and every detail,  he discusses with me

00:00:32.032 --> 00:00:34.951
and entirely follows my advice

00:00:35.118 --> 00:00:37.120
Once

00:00:37.162 --> 00:00:38.955
he felt

00:00:38.997 --> 00:00:39.956
he was not at his best

00:00:39.998 --> 00:00:43.084
he asked if he could have one more take

00:00:43.168 --> 00:00:46.087
In a way

00:00:46.129 --> 00:00:48.048
he has more confidence in my ability as director

00:00:56.097 --> 00:01:00.018
They  are  so  handsome,  attractive

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:01.936
that people usually ignore

00:01:01.978 --> 00:01:03.063
their talent in acting

00:01:03.104 --> 00:01:05.982
but in fact,  his acting is vivid

00:01:06.066 --> 00:01:09.027
and also powerful

00:01:14.032 --> 00:01:15.950
I really like his role

00:01:17.118 --> 00:01:20.080
if I have a boyfriend like him in reality

00:01:20.121 --> 00:01:21.956
my life would be so perfect

00:01:21.998 --> 00:01:23.124
I will give up everything for him

00:01:26.127 --> 00:01:28.963
Anything about a qualified boyfriend

00:01:29.005 --> 00:01:32.133
that you can imagine

00:01:32.175 --> 00:01:34.052
he has all of them

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:40.100
Yifeng Li is...

00:01:40.141 --> 00:01:42.143
sometimes serious but sometimes  funny

00:01:43.144 --> 00:01:44.062
So cool

00:01:46.981 --> 00:01:48.108
Born for shut-ins

00:01:48.191 --> 00:01:49.943
He is caring

00:01:50.026 --> 00:01:52.070
He always brings us food and drinks

00:01:53.154 --> 00:01:55.949
[We did it!!]

00:02:01.037 --> 00:02:02.038
Yifeng Li...

00:02:02.122 --> 00:02:03.164
he always has his own  ideas

00:02:03.248 --> 00:02:06.126
he's able to make good judgements

00:02:06.167 --> 00:02:08.128
about his scenes and character

00:02:08.169 --> 00:02:10.922
To himself, and others

00:02:10.964 --> 00:02:13.133
he could be a leader

00:02:13.216 --> 00:02:16.094
He is charismatic

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:21.860
[Ah, sorry]

00:02:27.063 --> 00:02:31.026
Everyone worked hard to finish this piece

00:02:31.067 --> 00:02:35.155
None of us could take the full credit

00:02:35.238 --> 00:02:41.077
And it's my first starring role in a film

00:02:41.119 --> 00:02:49.085
we all want to make it perfect

00:02:54.966 --> 00:02:56.926
