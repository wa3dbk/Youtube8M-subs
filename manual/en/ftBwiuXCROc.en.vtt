Hi, this is Jon on behalf of Expert Village.
In this video clip we will be touching up

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:13.690
our bathroom. Another great way to really
make your bathroom looking a lot nicer for

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:19.080
a very cheap price is to clean up all the
edges where you might have little bits of

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:25.710
paint that have been accidentally painted
onto a counter top. The first methods I'm

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:33.020
going to use is to use a little bit of lacquer
thinner on a q-tip and go ahead and rub that

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:42.420
on the paint and that's going to break down
that paint and just get that loose. Come back

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:49.980
with a towel and wipe that off and you want
to be real careful that you don't get the

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:56.360
lacquer thinner on your walls or your painted
surfaces. If you don't like using chemicals,

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:02.790
another way to get that paint off is just
to take a razor blade and gently scrape that

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:12.960
paint until that comes right off. Now you
probably don't want to use lacquer thinner

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:19.240
on woodwork because it would take the finish
off. So you just want to be real careful with

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:27.250
what you're actually using this on. The next
way to make our bathroom woodwork look a little

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:34.330
bit better is just to take a rag with some
warm water and mild detergent and just wipe

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:40.880
down all of the woodwork. Now, this is going
to kind of help shine up that woodwork and

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:48.390
it's going to make it look a little bit cleaner.
Next I'll just be using a furniture polish

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:55.690
to use on my woodwork. Just a little bit on
my rag should be sufficient and you're just

00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:02.280
going to rub that in and that's just as the
same as polishing a piece of wood furniture

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:04.520
it's going to shine that right up.
