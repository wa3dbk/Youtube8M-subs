00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:07.339
Hello, everybody. This is Bobby Stilwell here, and I'd like to give you a long overdue tour

00:00:07.339 --> 00:00:14.219
of my dorm room here in Griesedieck Hall at SLU. So looking out here at our beds-yes,

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:20.340
I have a roommate-you see the room is rather tiny. So I'm going to take you through a quick

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:28.020
panorama of what I get in here and just show you around. So, we come over here to the sink

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:37.360
area...it's a basic sink...Of course, you
bring your own soaps and what not-your own

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:44.740
towels. That towel rack is provided, and you get a cabinet down here. The problem is

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:54.120
here, look: My knee is about right here on the cabinet-right in here, so the cabinet pretty

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.739
much is right at my knee level, so I have
to bend over to do anything, which is kind

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:02.960
of a problem for a 6-3 person like myself.
There's another problem too, but I will get

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:09.940
to that as we progress through the room. And of course-you know what, let me do this real

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:14.880
quick-Hello!-So we've got the light up here,
and I'm actually going to turn it on so you

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:25.060
can see a little bit more here. That's better...yeah, that's much better. See, you've got the sink...Some

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:28.620
actually have water savers; we got lucky,
we don't have one that has a water saver on

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:33.779
it. So you've got the medicine cabinet-Hello
again!-You've got a medicine cabinet here

00:01:33.779 --> 00:01:39.099
that slides open, it's-you know-fillable with
anything you need, and again the light. Go

00:01:39.099 --> 00:01:45.459
ahead and shut that off...We each get an armoire-this is my roommate's so I'm not going to open

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:52.180
it, you've got my TV-we do have high definition here at SLU, which is rather surprising, I

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:57.270
brought in the cabinet, mini fridge and the
printer-you have to bring your own printer

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:02.969
or use SLU's printers...Personally, I recommend you bring your own. Here's my roommate's bed

00:02:02.969 --> 00:02:07.649
and his work area down here...I'm not going to light it up because it's...out of respect

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:15.600
for him, curtains...Here's our A/C unit, there's our heater; you can hardly see it, but you

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:18.880
see the vents, yeah, that's a heater-We have no control over it, so these rooms are sweltering

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:25.080
right now. And then over here is-you know,
let me turn on the light over here too real

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:46.460
quick. Come on, baby! Of course, I need it
to work, and it's not going to work. Well,

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:49.400
that's why I have a backup-that's why you
always bring your own light. Let me just turn

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.800
on my own light here-yeah, I brought this
one in; I've had this thing forever-this one

00:02:52.800 --> 00:03:00.620
forever. Ahh, there we go! You see, this is
my desk-kind of cluttered-it was worse, and

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:09.020
my computer, hard drives, water bottle, some newspaper clippings, miscellaneous junk-you

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:13.120
get a-you get a little thing up here to store
your stuff on-a little shelf, and I'll show

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:17.160
you why this is a good benefit later-and now it comes on, of course after I'm done with

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:24.070
this part...so you do have a light, and sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't-Just a standard

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:31.110
florescent office light...We're going to pan
back over here-we each get a dresser, forgot

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:36.930
to mention that, and this is mine, brought
the microwave-little cluttered, there's the

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:44.460
remote and here's the channel guide, that
box of paper's mine, got a chair there, which

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:49.880
is nice, got a little food cart here-yes,
it's restocked because I just came home from

00:03:49.880 --> 00:03:55.460
Christmas break, got my laundry baskets and paper towels up there, got a little broom

00:03:55.470 --> 00:04:00.030
and dustpan over here, using nails-yeah, SLU lets you hang nails, they just have to be

00:04:00.030 --> 00:04:03.870
small enough, which you can go get painter's nails, and you'll be fine. I will open up

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:09.510
this armoire because this is my own. So it's
pretty roomy in here, I've got towels over

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:15.330
here, clothespins, my laundry stuff's in the
back there, got some of my shirts hanging up,

00:04:15.330 --> 00:04:21.209
some of my dressier clothes, some shoes down there, my hamper over there, some extra hangers

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:27.819
for when I need them. So, pretty nice armoire we get-and this configuration with the beds

00:04:27.819 --> 00:04:32.830
by the way, is what-how the room comes, and it's been really good-they do come lofted

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:38.099
like this, so definitely helps maximize space, because I can actually sit here in my chair,

00:04:38.099 --> 00:04:43.479
and I'll actually demonstrate for you-I'm
sitting in the chair here, and there's my

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:48.760
TV, so bird's eye view of the TV, especially
whenever I run Netflix through it, because

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:53.770
I have a cable I can hook to my computer to do just that. One-Oh, yeah. The other height

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:58.960
complaint I have: You'll see I have a pool
noodle hooked on my bed, and you wonder why...Let

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:08.220
me show you. This right here is about my chin-what you're seeing here on the camera is about

00:05:08.229 --> 00:05:14.469
my chin-yeah, it's, yeah, that's my chin.
This pool noodle is level with my chin, so

00:05:14.469 --> 00:05:20.610
as you can imagine, I bend down-I bend down to do something, come up, and Ouch! every

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:25.710
time, so that's why I've got the pool noodle
there, because being 6-3 is rather difficult

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:32.659
here at SLU, at least in the dorms. Oh, and
I was going to show you the benefit of leaving

00:05:32.659 --> 00:05:37.839
your beds lofted and in this configuration,
and let me show you. Let me climb up here on my

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:50.840
bed real quick. Apologies for that...
As you can see, I'm crawling up here...this

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:56.439
is the cabinet right here, and so what I do
during the night-I've got a little fan there-I

00:05:56.439 --> 00:06:05.999
will sit my phone right over here, and I can
access it easily. So it's a really cool thing

00:06:06.009 --> 00:06:09.840
having this bed, because I can just set something anywhere I want. My roommate can do that,

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:14.059
too actually-he can set his phone over there if he wants, because besides having a light,

00:06:14.059 --> 00:06:20.699
they also have a plug-in on them, which is
really-really nice. So, that's the end of

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:28.260
the tour, and of course, there's the door.
Lucky I've never had to hear that thing go

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:37.000
off! So that's the end of the tour, I hope
you found it informative, and wish me luck

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.460
this semester here at SLU. So with that, this is Bobby Stilwell signing off, wishing you

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:46.960
all a pleasant evening. Stay warm, stay safe, and as always, take care!
