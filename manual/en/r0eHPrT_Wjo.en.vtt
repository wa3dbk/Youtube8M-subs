00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:05.000
It's my pleasure to welcome you

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:07.160
to the 41st Commencement Ceremony

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:08.360
at Los Medanos College

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:12.500
RN!

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:20.140
LMC

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:21.880
has provided me with

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:22.380
a great education

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.015
great structure for the future

00:00:25.174 --> 00:00:27.574
and can guide me in my future career.

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:39.560
Provide me with a future and

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:41.540
whatever else comes along.

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:42.640
I have a family of my own, so

00:00:43.022 --> 00:00:45.662
it's success for everybody, in a sense.

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:55.840
It has provided me with an opportunity

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:57.460
to get an education

00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:59.040
but at a lower cost.

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:00.926
So, it's easier than heading straight

00:01:00.926 --> 00:01:02.034
to a four year college.

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.120
It's given me a lot of opportunities

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:08.540
that I feel like I didn't even

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:10.880
think were opportunities.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.180
It's made me realize some things

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:14.560
about myself

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:15.620
just like what I want to do with my future

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:16.920
that I thought were options before.

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:19.940
Gave me another chance

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:20.900
of going to a four year university.

00:01:21.398 --> 00:01:22.918
It helped me figure out

00:01:22.918 --> 00:01:23.778
what I want to do in life.

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:25.740
took me a while, but

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:26.760
I did it!

00:01:28.025 --> 00:01:29.785
You get what you put into it

00:01:29.785 --> 00:01:31.903
and you make connections along the way

00:01:32.032 --> 00:01:33.232
work your butt off

00:01:33.232 --> 00:01:34.766
and you'll be where I am today.

00:01:37.954 --> 00:01:39.474
Graduating champions

00:01:39.702 --> 00:01:42.422
you've worked hard, hurdled obstacles.

00:01:42.801 --> 00:01:44.241
exhibited disciplne

00:01:44.896 --> 00:01:46.256
fortitude and pride

00:01:46.323 --> 00:01:47.683
and they never quit.

00:01:50.328 --> 00:01:52.088
You're off to great places

00:01:52.795 --> 00:01:53.915
today is your day

00:01:54.358 --> 00:01:56.038
your mountain is waiting

00:01:57.165 --> 00:01:58.445
so, get on your way!

00:02:02.948 --> 00:02:04.068
The more we learn

00:02:04.127 --> 00:02:05.167
the more we grow

00:02:05.167 --> 00:02:06.962
and the more we learn about ourselves,

00:02:06.962 --> 00:02:09.477
the better versions of ourselves we become.

00:02:11.436 --> 00:02:13.916
Reach beyond what is clearly visible

00:02:14.688 --> 00:02:16.128
and prove to yourself

00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:17.330
and to the world

00:02:17.631 --> 00:02:19.551
that nothing is impossible.

00:02:22.026 --> 00:02:23.866
I came to America 4 years ago

00:02:24.805 --> 00:02:26.165
and LMC was the place

00:02:26.165 --> 00:02:27.978
that gave me the opportunity

00:02:27.978 --> 00:02:29.991
to assimilate into the culture

00:02:33.006 --> 00:02:34.206
I say just have fun

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.820
learn everything and anything you can

00:02:36.885 --> 00:02:39.365
there are so many different opportunities here

00:02:39.365 --> 00:02:40.325
everyone is so friendly

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:41.200
so helpful

00:02:43.981 --> 00:02:45.261
LMC has prepared me

00:02:45.261 --> 00:02:47.483
to transfer to a 4 year university

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:50.500
and I have had a great time at LMC.

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:55.860
LMC has brought me many great memories

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:58.120
with a lot of poeple

00:02:58.220 --> 00:02:59.560
that I got to meet

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:00.533
that really helped me in my career

00:03:00.533 --> 00:03:01.554
and where I'm going

00:03:01.554 --> 00:03:05.180
and they pushed me and they've been very flexible with me.

00:03:09.307 --> 00:03:10.587
Incoming students

00:03:10.587 --> 00:03:12.672
don't give up and don't be discuraged.

00:03:12.672 --> 00:03:14.085
When you feel like giving up

00:03:14.085 --> 00:03:15.504
that's when you're being tested

00:03:15.504 --> 00:03:17.212
and that's when you need to keep pushing

00:03:17.212 --> 00:03:18.338
and striving for greatness.

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:19.859
You can do this!

00:03:23.248 --> 00:03:25.088
Study hard, but party hard!

00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:26.800
Ah, there you go!

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:27.680
You got that!

00:03:29.813 --> 00:03:31.733
As you leave this field today

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:33.360
LMC's hope

00:03:34.364 --> 00:03:35.484
our expectation

00:03:36.062 --> 00:03:38.702
is that you will keep your dreams alive.

00:03:38.702 --> 00:03:41.808
Graduates, we congratulate you this afternoon

00:03:41.808 --> 00:03:43.440
on your tremendous achievements

00:03:43.976 --> 00:03:46.136
and we look forward to continued

00:03:46.136 --> 00:03:47.842
greatness in your future.

00:03:47.842 --> 00:03:49.842
 

00:03:52.934 --> 00:03:54.374
Set you mind and focus

00:03:54.492 --> 00:03:55.692
like a laser beam.

00:03:56.005 --> 00:03:57.205
and come what may,

00:03:57.205 --> 00:03:59.417
remember that the goal is to finish.

00:04:07.389 --> 00:04:09.149
and it's sooo fullfilling

00:04:09.149 --> 00:04:10.873
being in this place tonight

00:04:10.873 --> 00:04:13.186
and actually to know that I've made it.
