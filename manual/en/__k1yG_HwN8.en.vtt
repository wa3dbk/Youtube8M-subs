00:00:00.833 --> 00:00:02.333
(squeaking)

00:00:02.333 --> 00:00:03.100
(pop)

00:00:05.033 --> 00:00:09.333
(♪♪♪)

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.400
It's difficult to imagine,

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.033
in today's
social environment,

00:00:13.033 --> 00:00:17.000
the separation that people
in pioneer times experienced.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.600
As people moved west,
there were great distances

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:20.933
between families and friends.

00:00:20.933 --> 00:00:24.967
Friendship quilts were made
as practical going away gifts

00:00:24.967 --> 00:00:28.100
and reminders of
times spent together.

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:30.067
A modern take on
the friendship quilt

00:00:30.067 --> 00:00:31.867
is a wire quilt sculpture.

00:00:31.867 --> 00:00:34.467
These examples
are made with wire, string,

00:00:34.467 --> 00:00:35.567
and beads.

00:00:35.567 --> 00:00:37.700
Each square contains
a unique design.

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:40.600
It's a collaborative project
that students,

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:41.733
friends, families,

00:00:41.733 --> 00:00:43.533
and many different
groups can enjoy

00:00:43.533 --> 00:00:45.333
creating together.

00:00:45.333 --> 00:00:47.500
Let me show you some ideas for
making it successful

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:51.533
with just about
any age or skill level.

00:00:51.533 --> 00:00:54.967
I have a ceramic square

00:00:54.967 --> 00:00:57.867
with a little bit of
a thick edge to it.

00:00:57.867 --> 00:01:00.500
I'm going to use this to
make a consistent square.

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.600
You could also use
a block of wood,

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:06.500
or a sturdy box.

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.500
Now younger students can
choose to use

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.400
soft aluminum wire.

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.667
It's very pliable
and easy to work with.

00:01:14.667 --> 00:01:18.400
I'm choosing something
just a little bits sturdier.

00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:20.967
This is a steel wire that
has been heated

00:01:20.967 --> 00:01:24.567
in a process called annealing
that makes it very strong.

00:01:24.567 --> 00:01:26.600
It's still easy to work with.

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:29.733
You can see that I can
form it with my hands,

00:01:29.733 --> 00:01:32.133
but in order to
get a tight corner,

00:01:32.133 --> 00:01:39.200
I will use
a small pair of pliers.

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:44.100
Now the ends could be joined
together by bending them,

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.000
by wrapping it with
a piece of electrical tape,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.333
or what I'd like to do is tie
them together

00:01:52.333 --> 00:01:55.333
with a little piece
of black string.

00:01:55.333 --> 00:01:59.367
Actually I'm using
a wax thread here today.

00:01:59.367 --> 00:02:04.033
This is very very
easy to work with

00:02:04.033 --> 00:02:06.500
because it likes
to stick to itself.

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.633
Now this square could be
considered a blank canvas.

00:02:09.633 --> 00:02:12.567
It's open to endless
design possibilities.

00:02:12.567 --> 00:02:15.900
Some of the designs
I have here incorporate

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:20.567
copper wire
and colourful jewellery wire.

00:02:20.567 --> 00:02:24.533
If I secure the end to
one side of the square

00:02:24.533 --> 00:02:28.433
by wrapping,
stretch it across the square,

00:02:28.433 --> 00:02:35.200
and secure the other side,
also by wrapping,

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:39.400
I can start my design
a line at a time.

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:44.767
Once again,
pliers are helpful for bending

00:02:44.767 --> 00:02:49.167
and for pressing down
those pesky little edges

00:02:49.167 --> 00:02:50.933
that can be very sharp.

00:03:00.367 --> 00:03:04.533
Let's wrap another wire
going the opposite direction.

00:03:12.367 --> 00:03:13.067
And you can see

00:03:13.067 --> 00:03:18.900
we've got the start of a very
simple basic design.

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:24.900
Another way to create a square
is to make a shape first.

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.700
Now, I've created
a star out of soft,

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:30.500
pliable, aluminum wire.

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:33.067
It fits right inside
the square.

00:03:33.067 --> 00:03:35.033
In order to secure it
to the edges,

00:03:35.033 --> 00:03:37.533
I could use a little more wire,

00:03:37.533 --> 00:03:40.100
or as I've started
to do here,

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:46.433
just tie it on with
a little more wax thread.

00:03:46.433 --> 00:03:48.667
Wire Form is a mesh
that is available

00:03:48.667 --> 00:03:51.500
in a variety of colours
and styles.

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:53.700
I would recommend using this
with older artists

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:57.733
because it sometimes produces
sharp exposed edges.

00:03:57.733 --> 00:04:05.700
It can be stretched
and wrapped around the frame

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:08.667
as I'm doing here,

00:04:08.667 --> 00:04:10.033
or it could be suspended
in the middle of

00:04:10.033 --> 00:04:12.767
the square as well.

00:04:12.767 --> 00:04:15.067
I like to use this as
a weaving surface

00:04:15.067 --> 00:04:17.600
for other wires.

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:20.400
Now along with the wire,
incorporating some beads

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:21.967
can be a nice touch,

00:04:21.967 --> 00:04:24.600
and add some emphasis
to the design.

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:26.800
You know, wire is
an amazing art medium.

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:29.267
It can be bent to
form a variety of lines,

00:04:29.267 --> 00:04:31.367
shapes, letters, and images.

00:04:31.367 --> 00:04:34.100
You can mimic traditional
quilt patterns with it,

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:36.400
or just be
completely freeform.

00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:38.333
And if you're working
with younger artists,

00:04:38.333 --> 00:04:40.000
don't worry.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.100
Try using
colourful twisty wires.

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:46.200
These plastic coated wires
are very very easy

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:49.467
and very safe to work with,

00:04:49.467 --> 00:04:52.833
and fuzzy craft stems
are always a great option too.

00:04:52.833 --> 00:04:55.800
The squares can be tied
together to begin a quilt,

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:59.800
or just enjoy it as
individual pieces of wire art.

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:02.633
You can find these
materials at DickBlick.com

00:05:02.633 --> 00:05:05.000
and if you keyword
'Wire Quilt',

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.367
you'll find a free PDF
of this project

00:05:07.367 --> 00:05:10.300
with lots of examples
for inspiration.

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:12.600
Happy quilting.

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:16.633
