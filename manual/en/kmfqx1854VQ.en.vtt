00:00:09.973 --> 00:00:13.123
Why does my computer turn off by itself?

00:00:13.123 --> 00:00:14.923
Does it have energy saving activated?

00:00:14.923 --> 00:00:20.723
It may be turning off because you told it
to, after a set period of inactivity.

00:00:20.723 --> 00:00:24.913
No, I don’t even know how to enable that
feature.

00:00:24.913 --> 00:00:27.513
It might just be the screen saver.

00:00:27.513 --> 00:00:32.192
I know it isn’t that because it doesn’t
immediately come back when I move the mouse.

00:00:32.192 --> 00:00:35.092
That means it might be hibernation mode.

00:00:35.092 --> 00:00:39.833
Some computers have that set to automatically
happen after a set period of inactivity.

00:00:39.833 --> 00:00:43.353
It’s a laptop, not a chipmunk.

00:00:43.353 --> 00:00:48.122
If it is a laptop, it might be dying because
the battery has discharged.

00:00:48.122 --> 00:00:50.093
I routinely charge it.

00:00:50.093 --> 00:00:52.482
Are you charging it all the way?

00:00:52.482 --> 00:00:57.383
If you’re only getting half a charge in,
it will turn off as the battery loses power.

00:00:57.383 --> 00:01:02.023
I’m pretty sure, since it is on the charger
most nights.

00:01:02.023 --> 00:01:06.212
The battery could be losing capacity shortly
before it dies.

00:01:06.212 --> 00:01:11.233
That means it stores less and less charge,
causing the battery to die sooner and sooner.

00:01:11.233 --> 00:01:15.483
Then I’ll need to get a new battery sooner
rather than later.

00:01:15.483 --> 00:01:17.272
Could it be hackers?

00:01:17.272 --> 00:01:21.823
You should be suspicious if the computer is
turning on when you didn’t activate it,

00:01:21.823 --> 00:01:25.683
and you should unplug it from the internet
if the computer is sending emails or opening

00:01:25.683 --> 00:01:27.503
applications on its own.

00:01:27.503 --> 00:01:30.093
That implies it is possessed.

00:01:30.093 --> 00:01:34.193
When someone has infected it with a virus
to create a back door so they can control

00:01:34.193 --> 00:01:37.522
it remotely, the correct term is zombie.

00:01:37.522 --> 00:01:39.753
That means you have a zombie computer.

00:01:39.753 --> 00:01:42.123
Would anti-virus software find that?

00:01:42.123 --> 00:01:43.123
Perhaps.

00:01:43.123 --> 00:01:48.543
A stronger sign is if the anti-mal-ware can’t
update or seems to lock up when you try to

00:01:48.543 --> 00:01:49.783
search it.

00:01:49.783 --> 00:01:52.412
I wish there was a low tech solution.

00:01:52.412 --> 00:01:53.763
Yes.

00:01:53.763 --> 00:01:57.222
You could ask your roommates if they are turning
off the PC when you aren’t around.
