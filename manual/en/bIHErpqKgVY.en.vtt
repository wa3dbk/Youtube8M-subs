For Expert Village, I'm EJ John Erickson with
Vital Flame Productions and thank you for

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:12.890
joining us on our sessions focusing on the
baritone saxophone. Okay, before I get too

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:19.429
far into the inspection, let's talk about
the main sections or pieces of a saxophone.

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:23.970
Obviously, you have your bell piece and it
comes down. You can see the hinge here, which

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:28.740
comes around, this is a U-joint, looks like
a U, it's kind of self-explanatory. From here

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:34.410
is the body portion, and then from the top
from the body portion comes out to the neck.

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:39.730
They call that the neck. And the mouthpiece,
of course we've got that portion, piece as

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:47.000
well. I also just like to say there's a top
and a bottom. The back section of a saxophone.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.860
The keys are all on the other side. This is
mostly blank and bare. And the front of a

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:58.640
saxophone which has all the keys on the front
section. Those are your basic parts. There's

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:02.890
two basic sides, I like to call, there's the
back side of the saxophone which doesn't have

00:01:02.890 --> 00:01:06.811
as many keys, mostly it has the rod portion.
And then I call it the front side and the

00:01:06.811 --> 00:01:12.100
front side has all of the keys. So starting
with the bell, working our way, we'll start

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:17.579
with the back. And you just want to go and
look for all these posts. Make sure that the

00:01:17.579 --> 00:01:23.539
bell, anything, there should be nothing moving
as far as these major hinge posts and kind

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:27.460
of check. I like to wiggle back and forth.
The keys are supposed to go up and down, but

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:31.560
if you also do it left and right, you can
tell if there's any big play in the rod sections

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:37.179
as well. Also, just check to make sure that
your pads look like their seating. Now what

00:01:37.179 --> 00:01:42.759
does that mean that a pad is seating. I'll
kind of describe it with my hands. The different

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:47.829
tone holes that open up create a rim and the
pad comes down and it has a rim inside of

00:01:47.829 --> 00:01:53.829
it that actually goes like this and it seats
right on that rim. Now, if the pad is off

00:01:53.829 --> 00:01:57.130
and that pad isn't lining up, that's going
to create leakage, which means you won't be

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:01.069
able to play it very well. So, one of the
things I'll be checking for is making sure

00:02:01.069 --> 00:02:06.189
all those pads are seating on those tone holes.
And also through the process as you're going

00:02:06.189 --> 00:02:10.010
through it, you can check, when I push a key
down, I can see what happens where it's up

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:15.360
here. So now, I can start to control this.
This is getting to know your Bari. Every hinge,

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:19.780
it's a good thing to kind of know what part
connects to what part and what key pushes

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:24.840
it. I can't tell you how many saxophone players
I know that have never sat down and looked

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:30.500
at the mechanics of basic joints of how keys
work. So many repairs you can fix yourself

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.200
just by knowing about your saxophone.
