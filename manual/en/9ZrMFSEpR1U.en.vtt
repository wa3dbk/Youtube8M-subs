00:00:00.784 --> 00:00:03.191
The NEET problem problem, the hikikomori problem.....

00:00:03.494 --> 00:00:06.229
The number of apathetic young people is steadily on the rise.

00:00:07.192 --> 00:00:10.477
The people known as OTAKU are said to be NEET and hikikomori in the making.

00:00:10.825 --> 00:00:14.454
Today we have gathered 100 self proclaimed Otakus.

00:00:14.454 --> 00:00:18.576
What do they think when they withdraw into the inner world ??

00:00:18.849 --> 00:00:20.628
We will find out what they are really like..

00:00:20.628 --> 00:00:24.552
Otaku summit: A live debate till morning!!

00:00:24.552 --> 00:00:26.788
Oh no!! it started!!

00:00:27.277 --> 00:00:29.615
Huh? this is odd..

00:00:29.615 --> 00:00:30.981
What are you doing ??

00:00:30.981 --> 00:00:33.613
I Got to Tape Shinpachi's Gall entry

00:00:33.613 --> 00:00:34.358
Shinpachi ??

00:00:34.933 --> 00:00:38.427
Come to think of it He hasn't come over today

00:00:38.427 --> 00:00:38.966
Firstly

00:00:38.966 --> 00:00:45.108
I'd like to correct the notion that all Otakus are NEETS an Hikikomori in making.

00:00:45.108 --> 00:00:45.422
53 idol Otaku- Shimura Shinpachi

00:00:45.422 --> 00:00:50.774
There are otaku among us who work and function seriously in the society.

00:00:51.413 --> 00:00:52.507
ah.. i see

00:00:53.712 --> 00:00:55.766
Number 31 what is your opinion??

00:00:55.766 --> 00:00:56.429
Well..

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:03.518
This show attempts to critize and blame otakus for causing Japan's current problems!!

00:01:03.144 --> 00:01:04.690
Ok I understand. I understand.

00:01:04.732 --> 00:01:07.534
Oi Oi whats this ?? He has become a really annoying guy!!

00:01:07.647 --> 00:01:09.787
The Viewers will definatly hate him

00:01:09.745 --> 00:01:13.707
Firstly its weird to group all otakus under one category.

00:01:13.991 --> 00:01:18.733
We're supporting a pop idol, something that is real.

00:01:18.733 --> 00:01:20.893
But what i don't understand is..

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:24.883
People who are in love with girls from 2 dimensional animes and games.

00:01:25.573 --> 00:01:28.398
Oi!! what do you mean by that no. 53??

00:01:28.834 --> 00:01:32.183
A 2 dimensional girl can never be attained even if you are in love with her.

00:01:32.183 --> 00:01:33.177
Its a waste of time!!

00:01:33.391 --> 00:01:36.301
Shut the fuck up! Shiori chan is alive in my heart

00:01:36.575 --> 00:01:40.312
Ahh.. Please wait...I have an objection can i speak?

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:40.845
Go right ahead

00:01:41.147 --> 00:01:41.542
No. 7 Anime Otaku- Toshi

00:01:41.575 --> 00:01:43.761
Umm.. In short what No. 53 is trying to tell

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:49.178
A 3 dimensional Otaku are more realistic than us 2 dimensinal otaku

00:01:50.165 --> 00:01:51.585
But let me ask you this..

00:01:51.796 --> 00:01:56.502
Do you think supporting a pop idol will get you to marry one ???

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:58.100
Well..

00:01:58.496 --> 00:02:00.008
You can't can you ??

00:02:00.388 --> 00:02:03.764
Basically us 2 dimensional otakus and you 3 dimensional otakus 

00:02:03.561 --> 00:02:06.086
Are both in love with something that is unattainable.

00:02:06.865 --> 00:02:08.326
We are in the same Boat.

00:02:07.641 --> 00:02:09.601
NO! NO! NO!NO!NO! YOU ARE WRONG!!

00:02:10.148 --> 00:02:15.829
Indeed it is impossible to marry an idol. but its not 100 % guaranteed

00:02:16.072 --> 00:02:17.831
Its 100% impossible to you!!

00:02:17.602 --> 00:02:18.073
NO!!

00:02:18.176 --> 00:02:19.456
No, its definitly impossible for you

00:02:20.386 --> 00:02:23.659
NO!! ITS NOT!! THATS BECAUSE POP IDOLS EXSIST IN THE REAL WORLD

00:02:23.616 --> 00:02:26.608
No, thinking beyound your grasp like that

00:02:26.795 --> 00:02:28.900
is absolute proof that you are not being realistic.

00:02:27.744 --> 00:02:31.597
That No. 7 is being really annoying!!! GO!! SHINPACHI!!

00:02:31.901 --> 00:02:34.831
WHY YOU!!! HOW DARE YOU TALK TO OUR CAPTAIN LIKE THAT!!!!!

00:02:35.906 --> 00:02:40.525
Whoa!! the 2 dimensional fans and the 3 dimensional fans have begun to fight each other!!!

00:02:40.441 --> 00:02:41.673
Its done!!!

00:02:42.682 --> 00:02:43.603
Its also melted!!

00:02:43.339 --> 00:02:45.205
You were toasting a bread ??
