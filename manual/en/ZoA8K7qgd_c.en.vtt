Natural Avocado Hair Mask

00:00:06.755 --> 00:00:10.202
Hi all! How are you doing?
I'm here to do a video for you

00:00:10.202 --> 00:00:14.210
To do a natural avocado hair mask

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:18.955
Now in summer, our hair suffers plenty 
with the sun, swimming pool, the sea...

00:00:18.955 --> 00:00:23.552
So it's a little extra help for our hair,
made of natural ingredients

00:00:23.552 --> 00:00:27.956
it will be useful to moisturize and nourish our hair

00:00:27.956 --> 00:00:29.746
and avoid that summer-dry look

00:00:29.746 --> 00:00:33.103
It's a avocado mask,
I'll show you how to do it

00:00:33.103 --> 00:00:36.705
I will have a bowl here at the side...

00:00:36.705 --> 00:00:42.142
Why avocado?
It has vitamins D, E... which are antioxidant

00:00:42.142 --> 00:00:47.130
it has a regenerating and softening effect

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:49.476
I'm going to cut the avocado in half
it looks like this on the inside ; )

00:00:49.476 --> 00:00:50.833
I will remove the seed

00:00:50.833 --> 00:00:56.153
I will remove the paste from the avocado with a spoon
and will place it in this bowl

00:00:56.153 --> 00:01:01.739
let's place it in here... the harder the avocado, 
the easier it will be to crush

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.281
I will procede to crush it with a fork
to make a paste

00:01:06.281 --> 00:01:11.722
In my case it was a bit difficult,
so I placed the avocado 15 seconds in the microwave to soften it a bit

00:01:11.722 --> 00:01:15.081
This is how it look and will now add some sweet almond oil

00:01:15.081 --> 00:01:20.953
I will begin with a little squirt first...

00:01:20.953 --> 00:01:24.103
Like this... I'm going to mix it up

00:01:25.318 --> 00:01:27.637
You see how it look? More or less ; )

00:01:27.637 --> 00:01:29.480
Let's place the towel...

00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:32.791
If you don't have (or don't want to use) sweet almond oil
you may also use olive oil instead

00:01:32.791 --> 00:01:34.430
I will have some silver paper at the side prepared

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:37.620
I will try to limit the application just to the hair,
avoiding the scalp so it won't get greasy

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:42.361
As it contains oil and it's quite greasy just apply it on the hair

00:01:42.361 --> 00:01:47.200
I will get some paste and will simply apply it on my hair

00:01:54.155 --> 00:02:00.259
I will rub the paste on the hair in a downwards stroke

00:02:00.259 --> 00:02:02.203
not upwards

00:02:02.203 --> 00:02:06.090
The hair mask is warm but not hot

00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.906
I will continue further up...

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:16.853
I have applied the paste on all this hair area
and will now procede to collect it like this

00:02:16.853 --> 00:02:23.151
I will leave it like this with some silver paper to hold it

00:02:23.151 --> 00:02:28.169
I will leave it like this for about half an hour

00:02:29.552 --> 00:02:36.640
I will leave it half an hour to let the hair
absorb the avocado and almold oil nutrients

00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:40.155
the almond oil is also moisturizing and nourishing

00:02:40.155 --> 00:02:41.754
it also has vitamins

00:02:41.754 --> 00:02:43.946
once the time is out I will remove the mask

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:49.571
So! The hair mask is done, half an hour passed,
I'll go to the bathroom to remove it

00:02:49.571 --> 00:02:51.455
I will remove it with warm water

00:02:51.455 --> 00:02:54.993
I will cleanse thoroughly all mask traces

00:02:54.993 --> 00:03:01.193
and will rinse my hair with shampoo and conditioner
as I normally do

00:03:01.193 --> 00:03:14.575
So! I will go and clean my hair.
If you want, when creating the paste you can add to the mix 
a spoon of your conditioner

00:03:14.575 --> 00:03:18.457
and apply it just like that,
it will be even easier to apply

00:03:18.457 --> 00:03:20.189
and you will achieve nice results ^^

00:03:22.211 --> 00:03:25.338
on this upper part near the scalp, no mask has been applied

00:03:25.338 --> 00:03:29.438
If I stroke like this I can really tell the difference!

00:03:29.438 --> 00:03:32.350
the lower part is much more smoother

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:36.010
it is also very shiny and looks good!

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:42.548
you will also notice that it tangles less...

00:03:44.051 --> 00:03:46.896
Well! That was all!
If you try it, please tell me how did it go

00:03:46.896 --> 00:03:50.898
and let's see each other on the next video ^^
Kiss! Bye bye

00:03:51.794 --> 00:03:58.656
