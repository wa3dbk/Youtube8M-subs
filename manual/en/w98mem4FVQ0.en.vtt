00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.549
Chimps can be three to five times 
stronger than humans.

00:00:08.549 --> 00:00:11.631
That means a really strong chimp 
could, in theory,

00:00:11.631 --> 00:00:14.514
lift around sixteen people over its head.

00:00:14.514 --> 00:00:16.877
But, can eating bananas 
and swinging around in trees

00:00:16.877 --> 00:00:18.747
really account for this difference?

00:00:18.787 --> 00:00:23.377
After all, aren't we supposed 
to share 99% of our genes?

00:00:23.443 --> 00:00:27.348
Studies have shown differences 
in the way our muscles are built

00:00:27.348 --> 00:00:31.059
but muscle control may be 
a much more important factor

00:00:31.059 --> 00:00:35.211
Chimps seem to have less control 
over how much muscle they use at once.

00:00:35.211 --> 00:00:39.351
While this may sound counter-intuitive, 
this can account for the difference in strength.

00:00:39.474 --> 00:00:41.379
Let's take a look at why.

00:00:41.379 --> 00:00:45.899
Compared to humans, chimps have 
less gray matter relative to body weight.

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:48.643
Gray matter is the part 
of the nervous system

00:00:48.643 --> 00:00:51.850
that contains the nerves 
responsible for controlling motion.

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:55.058
These branch out from the spine 
into the muscles

00:00:55.058 --> 00:00:57.704
to control individual muscle fibers.

00:00:57.704 --> 00:01:01.601
Some neurons can contact 
many muscle fibers at once.

00:01:01.601 --> 00:01:05.216
Activating these neurons causes all 
of the muscle fibers that touches

00:01:05.256 --> 00:01:06.807
to contract at once.

00:01:06.947 --> 00:01:08.523
Creating a lot of force.

00:01:08.523 --> 00:01:11.058
This combination 
of neurons and muscle fibers

00:01:11.058 --> 00:01:12.971
is called the large motor unit.

00:01:12.991 --> 00:01:15.582
And these are used for gross motor skills

00:01:15.582 --> 00:01:18.019
like jumping and climbing.

00:01:18.019 --> 00:01:20.979
Some neurons contact only a few fibers

00:01:21.137 --> 00:01:23.246
making a small motor unit.

00:01:23.246 --> 00:01:25.009
These don't have a lot of power

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:26.983
but they are a lot more precise.

00:01:26.983 --> 00:01:30.643
Small motor units let us do 
delicate complex tasks

00:01:30.643 --> 00:01:34.293
like playing a video game 
or plucking a ukulele.

00:01:35.529 --> 00:01:37.879
Things that we can do and

00:01:37.897 --> 00:01:39.757
chimps can't.

00:01:40.243 --> 00:01:43.413
So chimps who have less gray matter

00:01:43.446 --> 00:01:45.528
have fewer motor neurons.

00:01:45.528 --> 00:01:48.400
Therefore, their motor neurons 
are more likely

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:50.690
to be dedicated to large motor units.

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:53.241
This means when they do 
engage their muscles

00:01:53.241 --> 00:01:56.835
it's an all-or-nothing response 
which we see as strength.

00:01:56.835 --> 00:02:00.262
Unlike chimps, our neurons 
control smaller bundles

00:02:00.262 --> 00:02:02.606
so we have more specific muscle control.

00:02:02.606 --> 00:02:06.846
So keep this in mind the next time 
you think of challenging a chimp in a pub;

00:02:07.214 --> 00:02:10.322
You might want to try 
thumb wrestling instead.

00:02:10.322 --> 00:02:13.522
