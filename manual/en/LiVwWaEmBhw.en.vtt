This episode of Dnews is brought to you by
Domain.com.

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:07.689
Zero-calorie foods are all the rage these
days - but are they REALLY zero calories?

00:00:07.689 --> 00:00:11.760
And is it even possible for a food to HAVE
zero calories?

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:20.590
Hey guys, Tara here for Dnews - and I’m
sure a lot of you out there drink diet soda

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:24.210
on occasion, and if so - perhaps you’ve
found yourself wondering at times, “How

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:28.250
is it possible that this has zero calories?”
Or for that matter, how can any food have

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:29.250
zero calories?

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.140
It’s an interesting question, and the truth
is - they really can’t.

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:37.440
Aside from water, there is no truly zero calorie
food or beverage. And here’s why you probably

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:38.440
didn’t know that.

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:42.500
First off, most foods labeled as having “zero
calories” - actually DO contain a small

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:47.510
amount of calories. But as long as it’s
less than 5, then the FDA legally allows manufacturers

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:54.010
to round down - meaning a food with 4.9 calories,
can still be listed as having zero.

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:56.390
Splenda, the “zero calorie sweetener,”

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:00.800
actually has 3.4 calories per packet. But
for an even better example, let’s look at

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:06.049
this product: I Can’t Believe It’s Not
Butter spray. It’s advertised as a non-fat,

00:01:06.049 --> 00:01:10.619
zero-calorie food with a serving size of 5
sprays. But it’s actually not zero-calorie,

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:15.270
it contains 4 calories for every 5 sprays.
And when you consider the fact that its main

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.470
ingredient, soybean oil - contains about 120
calories per tbsp, then that means the entire

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:26.069
bottle - has almost 900 calories, even though
it’s advertising suggests that it is a zero

00:01:26.069 --> 00:01:27.270
calorie food.

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:31.700
So misleading labels are definitely part of
the problem. Another problem is the myth perpetuated

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:36.009
around “negative calorie foods.” These
are things like celery or cucumbers, that

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:40.509
contain very few calories - and it’s a common
misconception that your body expends more

00:01:40.509 --> 00:01:44.889
energy digesting them, than the amount of
calories it takes in. Unfortunately, there’s

00:01:44.889 --> 00:01:46.179
really no science to back that up.

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:50.899
Let’s go back to the example of celery.
A single stalk of celery has 6 calories, and

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:54.569
the “thermic effect” of celery - which
is the percentage of its calories you burn

00:01:54.569 --> 00:02:00.529
by digesting it - is around 8%. 8% of 6 calories
is about half of a calorie - which means that

00:02:00.529 --> 00:02:06.359
even after you account for digestion, your
net calorie consumption is still 5 ½. Obviously

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:09.570
that’s negligible in the long run, but it
proves an important point.

00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:13.310
Foods with the highest thermic effect, are
proteins - which still only have a thermic

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:19.120
effect of around 20-35%. Meaning there are
no truly negative-calorie foods or beverages.

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:24.750
Except… for ice water. Ice water technically
has zero calories, but your body has to expend

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:29.170
extra energy to bring it back up to your normal
body temperature - and for 8 oz of water,

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:34.470
that burns about 8 calories. So theoretically,
if you were drinking 8 8oz glasses of ice

00:02:34.470 --> 00:02:39.950
water a day, you’d be burning about 64 calories
a day - for a year, that equates to 6 ½ pounds.

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:44.010
Now as far as weight loss is concerned, it’s
minimal - but of course the other benefits

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.380
from drinking that much water definitely aren’t.

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:51.190
Now, what about foods that are heavy in mass,
but claim to have zero or very low calories?

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:54.730
How do those work? Well, the idea is that
those foods are made up of ingredients your

00:02:54.730 --> 00:02:59.000
body simply can’t break down. If you were
to think about it in very abstract terms,

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.151
you could almost liken it to eating a piece
of plastic - your body can’t digest it,

00:03:03.151 --> 00:03:07.730
so it simply passes through your system, meaning
you don’t consume or burn calories from

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:08.730
eating it.

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:12.450
Now most of the time, foods that are like
that, contain a lot of fiber, which is indigestible

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:16.070
by humans - although we still consume it,
because it keeps our intestines flowing and

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:21.170
healthy. So if you were to eat a big, heavy
hunk of food that was almost entirely fiber,

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:24.880
it would still have an extremely low calorie
count, because your body can’t absorb any

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:25.880
of it.

00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:30.540
So you see, the idea of a zero calorie food
- is pretty much a misconception. Almost all

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:34.710
foods, even those labeled as “zero calorie”
- do contain a small amount of calories. And

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:40.750
the only true “negative calorie” food
- is water. Which isn’t even a food. EVERYTHING

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:41.850
WE KNOW IS WRONG!

00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:45.400

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:55.510
for you online.

00:03:55.510 --> 00:04:00.150
