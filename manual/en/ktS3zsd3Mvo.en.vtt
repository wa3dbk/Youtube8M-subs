I think it's recording...is it recording? Oh, it is, okay...

00:00:10.339 --> 00:00:16.619
Um...
Oh, that's my iPod.

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:22.210
Oh! I didn't think you could hear me earlier..

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:25.730
Um..I'm gonna play Mary Had A Little Lamb on the flute

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:32.730
The-.. My own version, because it's SUPER easy how I do it, because it's only B, A, and G. (The notes)

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:36.990
So..you'll only move your finger one at a time

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:46.190
For beginners, you do NOT use the three fingers on your right hand. You only put your pinky down.

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:49.720
On-..I think this is too shiny to show you

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:53.400
guys.

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:05.220
Put your thumb down, and keep it down the entire song.

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:11.140
Also keep your index/pointer finger on your LEFT hand down the entire song. 

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.940
Uh...I didn't think you guys could hear me.

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:27.290
and then you can just put each finger down as you go along, and then lift them back up one at a time after putting all three of your fingers down.

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:35.310
Yeah, I think I got it..I'm gonna try it now

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.960
For those that didn't hear me the first time, the notes are only B, A, and G.

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:01.360
Okay, I am WAY to lazy to caption all of this, every caption earlier was pretty much basic stuff, so yeah. XD Kbye~
