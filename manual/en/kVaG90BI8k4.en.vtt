Hello my name is Jose Zuniga and I'm representing
expertvillage.com. What materials and supplies

00:00:07.999 --> 00:00:14.460
do we need in creating our vegetable garden?
Don't worry you are not going to go over the

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:20.410
budget. Most likely a lot of the supplies
are already going to be here at home. Come

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:26.380
on, if you have land equals that you have
to have a water hose. Now for this project

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:32.140
we are going to need some clippers. If you
don't have them don't worry. They average

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:39.190
about $12. I like to clean as I go, so get
a hold of a bucket just a empty container,

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:44.649
clean as you go. It makes the project much
easier. Now another thing that we need, I'm

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:53.891
sure you have it already, is a shovel, we
need a shovel. Now we need scissors, you are

00:00:53.891 --> 00:00:58.560
probably thinking scissors? Well we will be
planting today with some scissors coming into

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:05.210
the package, and I will explain to you later
why these are going to be handy. Now a couple

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:10.150
of those pens I know we are not going to school,
but trust me for this project they come in

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:18.200
extremely handy. Now I know some of you out
there I can't handle that dirt, well just

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:24.240
get a hold of a pair of gloves it runs between
a $1-$2; I personally I like to tackle that

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:31.030
dirt. This just gets the work done and enjoy
it. Now don't forget we also need this little

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:36.790
baby shovel, it comes in really handy. Now
most likely you have plants at home, so I'm

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:42.451
sure you have water cans that are going to
come in really handy as well. What do we need

00:01:42.451 --> 00:01:50.080
also? Top soil, well topsoil or organic soil,
just depending what type of vegetable garden

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:56.310
you are going to create today. Now don't for
get that some of these vegetables come already

00:01:56.310 --> 00:02:01.020
in the packages. You know you can buy them
by the seed, you can also buy them in the

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:09.200
4 inch containers, even the 1 gallon containers.
These are all the materials and supplies that

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.709
we need for creating our vegetable garden.
