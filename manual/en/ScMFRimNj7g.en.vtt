00:00:06.549 --> 00:00:15.160
Right we are at Myherin Forest, between Aberystwyth
and llangurig for the BCCC, and the first

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:19.650
outing for the D-Max Rally Truck and the team.

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.740
So we have just done our sighting lap, which
is a bit of an eye opener, there are some

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:28.949
really fast gravel stages, which I am used
to, but some incredibly rough single tracks,

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:35.110
with very deep ruts and ditch crossings, and
quite a lot of boulders, so it is very rough

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:38.060
on the vehicle.

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:54.120
5 ... 4 ... 3 ... 2 ... 1 ... GO!

00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:08.101
We had two deep ruts, very bumpy.

00:01:08.101 --> 00:01:12.840
We were over to the right hand sand, and this
big rock hidden in the grass, and it has basically,

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:14.800
snapped a bolt at the front end of the axel.

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:18.710
Hopefully we can get the bolt out and get
it sorted and we can crack on.

00:01:18.710 --> 00:02:10.920
As we are on a standard ECU, I think it is
superb, when we get a bit more power, then,

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:11.230
watch this space ...
