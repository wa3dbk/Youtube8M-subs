GROVER: Hello, there.

00:00:02.675 --> 00:00:07.110
This is Professor Grover, and
today I am going to tell you

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:12.050
all you ever wanted to know
about taking a bath.

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:15.620
And I know everything about
taking a bath, because well, I

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:18.170
take one every single day.

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:22.200
It is very important to take
baths, because that is how you

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:26.362
keep your fur bright blue
and squeaky clean.

00:00:26.362 --> 00:00:30.540
Now, there are two things, count
them, two, two things

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:33.060
you need when you take a bath.

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:36.900
First of all, a bathtub, which
I have plenty of surrounding

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:37.910
me right here.

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:41.324
See, this is a bathtub
right here.

00:00:41.324 --> 00:00:45.410
And the second thing you need is
some of this cleaning stuff

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:47.295
here, which is called--

00:00:47.295 --> 00:00:48.085
what is that called?

00:00:48.085 --> 00:00:49.570
Oh yeah, soap.

00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:52.110
This is a bar of soap.

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:56.480
Those two things are what you
need to take a bath, OK?

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:00.620
Now, all you have to do is
rub this soap all over

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:01.840
your body, like this.

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:05.269
Maybe start with your
neck, right here.

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:07.505
Just rubba, rubba, rubba,
rubba, rubba, rubba.

00:01:07.505 --> 00:01:09.560
See, that's one place
you could clean.

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:11.220
Maybe your tummy next--

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.760
rubba, rubba, rubba, rubba,
rubba, rubba.

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:18.030
Maybe your nose you could
clean, too, like that.

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.870
Just rub your nose with a
soap, maybe your cheek.

00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:27.030
Yeah, you can clean your cheek
in the tub, right there.

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:28.450
Isn't that nice?

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:31.000
You could clean your
arm here, see?

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.700
Right here, right by
the elbow there.

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:39.390
My arm gets a little dirty
there, right there, and even

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:40.630
your shoulder, right there.

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:43.180
It's hard to find my shoulders,
because they're a

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:45.610
little weak.

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:49.080
I am not that strong,
but I am wiry.

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:51.510
[KNOCK ON DOOR]

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:52.500
GROVER: Entre.

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.470
GROVER'S MOMMY: Oh,
good, Grover dear.

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:55.250
GROVER: Oh, Mommy!

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:55.890
Hi, Mommy.

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.600
GROVER'S MOMMY: I see that you
are ready for your bath, dear.

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.680
GROVER: Well no, Mommy, I'm
not ready for my bath.

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.980
I am taking a bath, Mommy.

00:02:04.980 --> 00:02:05.760
Yeah, see?

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:10.550
I have my bathtub and
my soap, the two

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:12.680
necessities of bathing.

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:16.420
GROVER'S MOMMY: But Grover,
dear, you cannot take a bath

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.052
with your hat on!

00:02:18.052 --> 00:02:20.526
It will get wet!

00:02:20.526 --> 00:02:21.392
GROVER: Wet?

00:02:21.392 --> 00:02:21.825
GROVER'S MOMMY: Mmm!

00:02:21.825 --> 00:02:24.987
GROVER: Well, how will
it get wet, Mommy?

00:02:24.987 --> 00:02:28.890
GROVER'S MOMMY: Well, dear, it
will get wet from the water.

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:30.520
You see here?

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.520
[WATER RUNNING]

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:32.830
GROVER: Water?

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:35.215
GROVER'S MOMMY: There,
yes, dear.

00:02:35.215 --> 00:02:38.080
GROVER: Water.

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.120
Ha ha ha.

[CLEARS THROAT]

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:45.145
As I was saying, there are three
things you must have in

00:02:45.145 --> 00:02:47.990
order to take a bath.

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:50.130
Oh, I am so embarrassed.
