00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:22.080
In this movie we are going to continue to
talk about how we can color correct

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.400
our photographs using Curves.

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.759
The first thing that you want to do with your
image is begin to try to figure

00:00:26.759 --> 00:00:28.259
out what is the color shift?

00:00:28.259 --> 00:00:30.320
And with this image we can kind of tell that
it's

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:33.020
a bit of a cool or cold color shift.

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:34.670
So how can I then correct that?

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:37.281
Well, one of the things that I want to do
is I want to grab my Eyedropper tool.

00:00:37.281 --> 00:00:41.800
I'm going to change my Point Sample size to
5x5 Average or something other than

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:42.800
Point Sample.

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.399
So you would want to bring that value up,
for higher res files

00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:47.030
we'll take this up even higher.

00:00:47.030 --> 00:00:50.739
Next, I'm going to click on the Adjustment
Layer icon and choose Threshold or

00:00:50.739 --> 00:00:53.879
navigate to the Adjustments panel and click
on Threshold here.

00:00:53.879 --> 00:00:56.940
You can access
the Threshold Adjustment either way.

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.540
Now I'm going to use this Threshold
Adjustment in order to diagnose the image.

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:04.220
Now when I click-and-drag it to the
left I notice I have my darkest tones around

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:05.220
here.

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.220
Okay, great!

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:07.340
Well I have
some shadows I'm just looking to try to find

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:09.140
some meaningful blacks.

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:12.560
So I'll find where the darkest tones are,
hold down the Shift key and I'll add

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.160
a little sample point there.

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:15.670
Next I'll click-and-drag to the right.

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:17.710
Now when I
click-and-drag to the right I notice that,

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:18.710
Oh, my gosh!

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:20.640
I have some
information, some snow here.

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.040
It is completely above 100% white, you can
see

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:30.580
there that my values in this area are 255,
255, and 255, i.e., no information;

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:31.990
that won't print well.

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:34.030
I'm going to need to bring that down.

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:35.930
So we are going to
be able to color correct this image; in an

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:39.680
addition we'll bring this image to a
better place, so that it can be printed even

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:40.680
more effectively.

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.340
Okay, well let's go ahead and Shift- click
on that point there as well, and then

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:45.179
turn off the Eye icon for this layer.

00:01:45.179 --> 00:01:49.050
One of the things I'm noticing is I do,
definitely, have some bright spots in the

00:01:49.050 --> 00:01:52.110
snow, I have this shadow over there,
which will be nice, and also I'm probably

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:55.420
going to need to work on the mid
tones of this jacket as well; but let's start

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:57.310
with our white and black points.

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:00.960
From here we click on the Adjustment Layer
icon and choose good old Curves.

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.780
Next, we will double the black Eyedropper.

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:06.810
We are going to take our brightness
value to 5%, click OK.

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.560
And then we are going to sample that nice
dark area.

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.239
As
you notice that brightened up some of those

00:02:11.239 --> 00:02:15.090
dark tones, now in this one point I
actually have some meaningful detail in that

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.380
nice dark shadow, so that will print well.

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:20.510
Next I'm going to go to my white Eyedropper,
double-click that point, change

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:21.720
the brightness value to 95%.

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.790
I have already done that previously.

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.150
So there is
that number.

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.560
Click OK and we are going to sample this area
of snow.

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:30.230
You know
that brought down some of the values there,

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:33.710
and my point too we can now see I
have meaningful detail there in this area

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:34.710
of the image.

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:37.530
Next I'll click on the mid tone Eyedropper,
and I'm going to sample an area on

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:41.600
this jacket here and that will perform my
final color correction.

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:45.300
Now my blacks are still color correct, my
whites are color correct over here,

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:47.850
and now I have a much more color correct jacket.

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:51.110
I'll hold down the Shift key
and I set a point on this jacket just so I

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:54.340
can look at the numbers and again
these numbers are not going to be exactly

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:56.060
the same, but they are pretty close.

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.730
If I hold down the Shift key and drag this
around, we are just going to be able

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:01.760
to see how close these numbers are, and they
are pretty close.

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.210
So that looks
pretty good; again, just trying to evaluate

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:06.200
the tone of the jacket.

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:07.690
Let's look at the before and after.

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:10.540
Here is before and here is after.

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.490
So in
this case, we brought this image to a place

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:16.000
where we can print it much more
effectively and in addition the image looks

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.000
much stronger.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.840
If you press the Tab
key to hide everything what's happened here

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:22.230
is now this portion of the image is
much warmer.

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:24.690
We still have some nice cool tones in the
background, so it still

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:29.390
feels cool outside, we haven't neutralized
everything and many times you don't

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:32.890
want to neutralize everything, but in this
case, we have definitely removed the

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:37.230
color cast from our subjects, they look a
lot better, the background looks

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:38.230
interesting.

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:39.640
We have this warm cool thing going on.

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:43.330
So this image is now color correct and at
this juncture we could cross off

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:47.780
color correction from our list, and continue
on in our digital postproduction

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:57.860
workflow on this image.
