Hello my name is Lauren with makeup by Dodge
and today we will be talking about how we

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:13.480
are going to apply cat eye eye liner as easily
as possible. This is a little advanced I have

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:22.860
to say. I think that liquid eyeliner is definitely
something to very very careful about when

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:27.850
you are putting it next to your eye. I prefer,
I say liquid liner because I prefer using

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:33.969
liquid liner when I do cat eyes. It definitely
when you have the right kind it gives a much

00:00:33.969 --> 00:00:39.920
deeper and more precise look. You don't want
to blend cat eye, you want cat eye to be very

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:48.809
sharp kind of Betty Page if you will. So the
first thing when you apply this, my liner

00:00:48.809 --> 00:00:56.489
has like a brush at the very end and sometimes
it can be like a sponge point sometimes it

00:00:56.489 --> 00:01:05.670
can be brush. You dip it in and you are going
to pull the eye out this way, when you apply

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:14.190
it just to make sure you have it all the way
flat when you do it. Also when you do cat

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:20.960
eye eye liner you want to stay as close to
the lash as possible. If you have a gap in

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:27.250
between your eye liner and your eye it just
doesn't look like what you are trying to achieve,

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:32.820
let's just stay that. The very end at the
very end of the eye, the very end corner of

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:38.890
the eye should be the thickest part when you
are doing cat eye eyeliner. The very inside

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:47.600
sometimes doesn't need any, if that very very
thin. It will go up when you thickened it

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:52.060
toward the end it will go up towards your
eyebrow. You don't want it to go straight

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.920
across and you don't want it to go down or
else you will look sad. It is to make your

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:02.470
eyes lifted and your eyelashes look thicker
so you'll swoop it up a little but but not

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:08.069
like a real swoop, just like a little angle
when you have finished and that is cat eye

00:02:08.069 --> 00:02:08.609
eyeliner.
