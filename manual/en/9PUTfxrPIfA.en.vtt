one, two, three, four!

00:00:01.600 --> 00:00:03.600
Rev up your engines!

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:16.220
It's time for the Scotty Kilmer Channel

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.800
I just had this corvette towed over to my

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:26.280
house, it sat in the garage for 15 years,
hasn't been driven since 97, so now I'm

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:30.080
going to show you how to get a car
running it's been sitting for years,

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:35.970
first thing to do is empty out the gas
tank, because that's not gasoline in there

00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:41.850
anymore, it's more like turpentine, so get
a long hold and a tank to put some gas

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:47.070
in, and siphon the gas out of the tank,
but don't suck like people used to, you

00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:52.030
can kill yourself breathing it, use a
pump, just stick it in the pump,

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:59.980
and suck it to get the gas out, then just
transfer it into your can, then it's time

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:08.710
to get five gallons of new gas and pour
it in the tank, and pour it in, now you know

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:12.760
the battery's going to be dead after that
many years, and in this case we just

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:16.180
bought a new one to stick in, and now
comes the moment of truth, let's turn the

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:21.220
key and see what happens,
it only clicks, well it means either the

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:25.479
engine is locked up, or the starter's bad,
so we'll get a socket and a wrench and

00:01:25.479 --> 00:01:36.789
see if we can turn the engine over, well
here we go, well the engine turns, so time

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:41.770
for new starter, well here's the old
greasy starter, now we'll see what

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:46.560
happens, well spray in a little start and
fluid in the carburetor,

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:54.160
and then crank it and see what happens,
what do you know, fifteen years later and

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:58.390
she starts right up, and of course once
you get it running you got to change all

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:03.399
the filters, oil and filter, radiator,
power steering, transmission, because when

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:08.590
a car sits for 15 years, everything's
going to be bad, and watch all the hoses and

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:13.810
check all the brake lines too, then pray
like mad that all the oil seals don't go

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:18.640
bad and it starts leaking everywhere, but hey,
at least it's running now and that's half the

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.620
battle, and remember if you've got any
car question just visit Scotty Kilmer

00:02:23.620 --> 00:02:28.800
.com and I'll answer them as soon as
I get back from the devil's hole.
