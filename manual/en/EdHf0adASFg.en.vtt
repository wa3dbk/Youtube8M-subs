00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:10.990
So I'm going to take my chocolate that's already
tempered and that's just cooled down, and

00:00:10.990 --> 00:00:17.669
I'm going to put a little bit of it right
onto my acetate sheet, my transfer sheet,

00:00:17.669 --> 00:00:21.870
and just take a small offset spatula and just
spread it.

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:26.210
You're looking for a very thin layer, not
too thin that it will break, but just thin

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:27.410
enough.

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:32.820
Imagine like a piece of thin brittle like
a candy.

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.640
Just spread it all over.

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:42.000
What I'll do is pop this in the fridge once
I've spread it out really nice and thinly,

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.760
and it'll set up within, I'd say, five, ten
minutes, you'll have a really nice sheet of

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:48.310
chocolate to work off of.

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:51.120
You don't have to fuss too much with it.

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.750
Just make sure it's nice and even.

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:54.980
And one is ready to go.

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:59.420
Now, for the other I'm going to make a little
bit of like a chocolate squiggly design.

00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:04.741
So, I'm going to take a little bit of my chocolate
right into my cornet and you can see it just

00:01:04.741 --> 00:01:05.741
goes right to the bottom.

00:01:05.741 --> 00:01:14.729
I'm going to take it and fold it over, and
I have a really cute little cone.

00:01:14.729 --> 00:01:17.509
This is also great if you want to write people's
names on birthday cakes.

00:01:17.509 --> 00:01:20.609
You just write happy birthday with the little
chocolate cone.

00:01:20.609 --> 00:01:28.400
Just snip the tip and you can go as wide or
as kind of small as you want to.

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:33.630
All I'm going to do is just make cute little
kind of squiggly designs.

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:38.490
When they're set I'm going to break these
up and put them in shards kind of on top of

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:39.490
my cake.

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:43.299
It's going to be really beautiful lace to
put around.

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:49.710
So easy, incredibly easy, but it looks really
cool.

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:50.710
So that's it for that.

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:56.340
You want to do enough that it's not going
to break on you, so a good layer of squiggle,

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.709
a very technical term.

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:01.709
That is it.

00:02:01.709 --> 00:02:05.919
So, all of these chocolate designs I'm going
to pop in the fridge or the freezer until

00:02:05.919 --> 00:02:07.479
they're nice and firm and set.

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:11.650
Then I'll take them off of these transfer
sheets and put them on some cakes, and you'll

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:13.060
see some really beautiful designs.
