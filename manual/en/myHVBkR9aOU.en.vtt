00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:12.870
this is a roofing flashing it's a
six-inch stuff I have this laying around

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:18.869
if I was going to buy it I would have
bought probably eight or ten inch I know

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:25.619
what I'm going to do is make a ring that
will go around this pot for the rocket

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:32.610
stove and what I'm finding out is
without the ring it's just about

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:37.920
impossible the boil water without
focusing the heat up the sides of the

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:44.730
pot so I'm going to show you how to make
a ring real quick and then I'm going to

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:52.730
see how long would it take to boil one
full gallon of water okay what I did was

00:00:52.730 --> 00:01:03.510
cut three tabs and three slots now I'm
gonna turn it over I'm going to bend

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:24.420
these tabs in to hold it that will focus
the heat on the pan all right I'm gonna

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:29.549
go get that stove cranked up real hot
get it going and see how long it takes

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:36.869
to boil one full gallon of water we're
cooking pretty good now I got it got

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:39.530
that fire going

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:47.799
likes dumpin gallon of water in there

00:01:54.830 --> 00:02:07.040
I just realized I had a piece of trim
that was balsa and had a plastic coating

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:11.630
on it I shouldn't put that in there cuz
that's what that black smoke is stinks

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:28.880
all right effects you put the trim ring
on it the heatwave let's see and we're

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:37.420
starting oh that stinks
can't let burns off

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:43.959
okay I'm finding this hard to believe
now this is a nasty fire I accidentally

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:50.170
put some stuff in there that I shouldn't
have look at that and I want to show you

00:02:50.170 --> 00:03:04.120
the clock seven minutes a hard-boil in
seven minutes now this thing is really

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:10.989
cooking now let me show you what I put
in there this stuff okay it's got a wood

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:19.209
micro thin wood veneer on the outside
but it's plastic and boy did that put

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:22.599
some nasty smoke off I won't do that
again

00:03:22.599 --> 00:03:27.310
they've got the pan all black terrible
anyway boiling

00:03:27.310 --> 00:03:30.879
seven minutes boiling amazing I'm real
happy with this

00:03:30.879 --> 00:03:36.670
that's a gallon of water you can purify
in seven minutes with just a handful of

00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:38.819
twigs
