00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.133
The Spot Removal tool can be used to remove two kinds of blemishes. 

00:00:10.866 --> 00:00:13.900
By default the tool is within the Details tool tab.

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:19.700
First decide what kind of blemish you need to remove.

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:23.233
The ‘Dust’ setting is used to remove dust spots on the camera’s sensor.

00:00:24.233 --> 00:00:27.933
The Spot setting is used to remove blemishes on the subject itself,

00:00:27.933 --> 00:00:29.733
for example skin blemishes.

00:00:30.533 --> 00:00:34.333
Select the ‘Remove Spot’ cursor tool from the Spot Removal Tool

00:00:34.333 --> 00:00:35.866
or from the cursor toolbar.

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:40.700
Zoom the viewer to 100% for the best view of the spots that need correcting.

00:00:42.433 --> 00:00:46.533
Right-click on the image and adjust the radius size of the Spot Removal cursor.

00:00:46.933 --> 00:00:50.300
Aim to set the radius a little larger than the spot itself.

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:53.033
Click on the spot to remove it.

00:00:56.066 --> 00:01:00.266
If necessary, adjust the radius of the spot after it has been placed.

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.700
The process is the same for Spot removal.

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.233
Note that the cursor has a different appearance. 

00:01:19.533 --> 00:01:22.133
To edit existing dust removal spots,

00:01:22.133 --> 00:01:25.633
use the selection arrows or drop down menu, to move between them.

00:01:26.533 --> 00:01:28.933
The type and radius can then be adjusted.

00:01:30.633 --> 00:01:33.633
If the same spots are prevalent on a series of images,

00:01:33.633 --> 00:01:37.233
it makes sense to copy and apply the same spot removal points.

00:01:38.533 --> 00:01:41.333
To quickly copy the spot removal points across,

00:01:41.333 --> 00:01:44.733
hold down the shift key and click the Copy / Apply icon

00:01:44.733 --> 00:01:46.933
in the Spot Removal Tool, Toolbar.

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.600
To remove all spots at once on an image,

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.300
investigate creating a LCC with Dust Removal Information.

00:01:57.866 --> 00:02:01.566
Watch the LCC tutorial for details on how to do this.
