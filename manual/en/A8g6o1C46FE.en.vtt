Hello everyone this is Breanna Rutter from
howtoblackhair.com and this vlog I want to

00:00:07.339 --> 00:00:13.510
share with you all my personal best products
that I use for my natural hair now the products

00:00:13.510 --> 00:00:19.110
that you use for your hair will be differ
from mine even from the next person in this

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:23.990
is fine because you want to use products that
best work with your hair and with your own

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:30.220
hair regimens that you already have so I will
walk through the steps as to when I'm getting

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:35.350
ready for a condition wash to shampoo all
the way up to a style and show you and explain

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:40.390
to you to different products that I like to
use for my hair so the first thing that I

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:46.489
like to use in my hair regimen is a prepoo
product I never liked using this term because

00:00:46.489 --> 00:00:53.579
I dont like the way it sounds prepoo it really
is a pretty shampoo treatment or just a pre-shampoo

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.690
so it's like a wash for your actual wash in
a sense of where you are lubricating your

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:04.110
hair and getting your hair ready to be shampooed
so the product that I like to use to prepare

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:10.890
my hair for a shampoo session is vo5 conditioner
use this conditioner ever since I've been

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:15.110
natural and there are some people who don't
like it as well and some people who do and

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:20.410
it seems to me that probably because is cheap
is not favored by some people but nothing

00:01:20.410 --> 00:01:25.570
is wrong with the product it works great and
it works fine with my hair and with many others

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:31.840
as well so for the favorite that I like to
use in the actual vo5 line I will be the link

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:36.920
down in description box for you to check the
blog out to see the specific kind I like to

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:43.799
use so now that I preconditioned my hair I
now move on to my shampoo session and the

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:51.450
type of shampoo that I like to use is called
organic olive oil aloe cream shampoo this

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.540
hole is really good for my hair and I think
a couple other people like to use this as

00:01:56.540 --> 00:02:01.689
well so once again you just want to use a
product that best helps you with keeping your

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:06.990
hair clean and conditioned and moisturizer
for your hair journey so after my hair is

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:15.359
preconditioned I use the organic olive oil
shampoo to wash my so there I wash my hair

00:02:15.359 --> 00:02:20.540
next I used the product that serves as my
deep conditioning treatment and the type of

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:26.620
product that I like to use is called Hollywood
beauty deep conditioning cholesterol hair

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:31.819
cream so really you can kind of put A little
bit of this cream on your hair and leave it

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:37.279
on on for moisture will what I like to do
is actually use it to deep condition my hair

00:02:37.279 --> 00:02:41.859
and as I leave this product on top but this
time of my hair I like to do a steam session

00:02:41.859 --> 00:02:48.849
for about 20 minutes to really penetrate my
hair and give it a lot of moisture so I after

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:54.510
I have done my prepoo my shampoo wash and
my deep conditioning treatment with my hair

00:02:54.510 --> 00:03:00.549
steamer I then sometimes incorporate a little
bit of protein into my hair now I hardly ever

00:03:00.549 --> 00:03:06.279
have to protein in my your first of all because
I have a diet that is very high in protein

00:03:06.279 --> 00:03:11.779
so my hair always feels really strong it just
sometimes the more moisture but if ever it

00:03:11.779 --> 00:03:18.079
feels like I need more protein in my hair
I use a braids braids and proteins will a

00:03:18.079 --> 00:03:23.809
lot of you may be thinking braids spray but
it's all that I need to corporate protein

00:03:23.809 --> 00:03:29.769
back into my hair if my hair doesn't feel
a strong and the best product I like to use

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:36.199
as little bit protein into my hair is called
Africa's best braids spray with conditioner

00:03:36.199 --> 00:03:42.309
this product is perfect I like to mist my
hair would sometimes and are probably less

00:03:42.309 --> 00:03:47.780
than about every 2 to 3 days with this product
it is great for when I have braids when my

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:53.629
hair is concealed or just add a little bit
more strength to my hair so now that I finished

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:58.849
conditioning washing and treating my hair
I didn't want to seal the water in my hair

00:03:58.849 --> 00:04:04.479
right after a wash this seems to be the best
time for me to really seal in moisture to

00:04:04.479 --> 00:04:10.029
keep my hair supple and elastic and the type
of oil that I like to use to hold moisture

00:04:10.029 --> 00:04:16.550
or water into my hair is to use olive oil
or coconut oil now sometimes it just depends

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:22.189
on which oil I like to use really my decision
will be what oil is closer for me to reach

00:04:22.189 --> 00:04:27.180
and then I will put it on my hair and then
sometimes when I use olive oil it feels extremely

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:32.900
too slippery to the point where it just feels
a little bit slimy which I don't like hair

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:38.930
so really it depends on if I need an extra
slip on my strands because most of the time

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:45.800
I do prefer coconut oil but I like to put
olive oil on my hair as well so the last thing

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:50.879
I like to do to help promote natural hair
growth with my hair after I follow all the

00:04:50.879 --> 00:04:56.960
steps is to do a protective style a protective
style simply install the required is little

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:02.560
to no manipulation once you set your hair
so if you constantly flat iron your hair all

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:07.770
the time that's not doing a protective style
or if you're constantly doing twists in your

00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:14.220
hair every single day that is not really protect
you want to style they can hold of so basically

00:05:14.220 --> 00:05:20.090
your next wash for most of the time that doesn't
happen so you have at least two or three different

00:05:20.090 --> 00:05:24.710
styles that you put before you watch and is
perfectly fine you just want to make sure

00:05:24.710 --> 00:05:30.509
that once you set and prepped and fix your
hair it's there for a while in my favor protective

00:05:30.509 --> 00:05:36.560
style that I like to do after I found out
my regimens best is to put my hair into bantu

00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:43.229
knots and let them dry or simply twist my
hair into two strands and let them dry once

00:05:43.229 --> 00:05:49.110
they dry I will release my hair and wear my
hair as is or I like to braid my hair and

00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:55.860
sew extensions on top the purpose of the protective
style is to protect your ends and your hair

00:05:55.860 --> 00:06:00.930
so that you can actually grow longer hair
the less manipulation you put your strands

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:06.539
the more your hair will start to grow so thats
my best products that I use for my natural

00:06:06.539 --> 00:06:11.449
hair iand feel free to share with me your
