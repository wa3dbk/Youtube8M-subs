00:00:00.580 --> 00:00:03.179
when we look at a scene with our eyes,
in reality

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:06.810
the subject is always smack in the
middle of our field of view

00:00:06.810 --> 00:00:10.480
it's just how our eyes work we see
things in the middle

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:14.200
despite the fact I'm looking at you
right now through the lens of jaynes

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:14.759
camera

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:18.609
I can still see stuff going on all
around me I can see guys over there my

00:00:18.609 --> 00:00:21.090
fingertips the sky and the bench down
in front to me

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:25.140
but putting the subject smack in the
middle of a photograph very very rarely

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.670
works as a composition

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:30.170
you'll usually end up with something pretty
dull and not very interesting.

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:33.730
the other thing we forget to do as human
beings when taking a picture

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:37.570
is to come out of the subject and look all around the viewfinder

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:42.050
at the image, tripods are great for this because you can lock of your composition

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:43.750
and then look all around to see what's going on

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:46.969
without losing the composition that
you've set.

00:00:46.969 --> 00:00:51.110
Now while you're looking at me, did you notice that I've got a thing growing out the

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:52.379
side of my head here,

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:56.010
it's not very pleasing is it, and it's a classic error you'll make whilst taking

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:56.620
shots.

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:59.859
Now we can't move the thing, but we can move the camera,

00:00:59.859 --> 00:01:03.789
and by changing the angle the cameras at the thing that's growing out the side of my head

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:04.939
will disappear.

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:08.750
Now just before we do that, i'm gonna ask my lovely young assistant here if he'd mind

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:12.780
taking a shot over my shoulder to show
where the camera is in relation to me,

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:17.090
thanks Tom now then, as we move the camera

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.680
off to the side. wobbly wobbly wobbly wobbly.

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:24.080
the background is changing,

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.170
a house has appeared behind me, now obviously a house hasn't

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:30.770
really appeared behind me it's because
the angle has changed

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:35.229
now it's a different shot, but again it's kinda busy, it's kinda not brilliant

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:38.409
if you want a shot of me you need to lose the house.

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:42.520
How'd you do that? Move the camera again, so if we lower the camera down

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.189
all the while you need to be looking
around that viewfinder making little

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:47.840
adjustments and movements

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:52.060
and as you fiddle around and move stuff
about you'll find a place

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.840
where we can lose the house and just get
the components that you want

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:00.049
to make an interesting composition so
now you've got quite a dramatic sort of

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:02.060
an image, with me against the sky. This

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:05.600
isn't a menu setting,

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:09.890
this is all outside of the camera, this is all about you not being lazy

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:14.370
and moving yourself around and try stuff out to find the composition that

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:15.099
works for you
