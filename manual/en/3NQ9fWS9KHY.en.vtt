00:00:00.299 --> 00:00:04.880
Hello, it's Saturday, finals are over and
I'm home for break and I feel like I haven't

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:07.020
slept in periods of more than 3 hours in..

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.240
I don't even know how many days because all
of the days just become one day and I probably

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:15.559
look like I just finished finals but right
now I'm feeling strangely energetic so..

00:00:15.559 --> 00:00:16.949
Hello it is Saturday.

00:00:16.949 --> 00:00:20.449
One of the best parts of being home is that
I don't feel like the entire world is standing

00:00:20.449 --> 00:00:22.999
directly outside of my door listening to me
make this video.

00:00:22.999 --> 00:00:26.599
Ugh I just want to be shirtless.

00:00:26.599 --> 00:00:32.180
So this weeks topic is name changes and gender
marker changes and I'm going to be 100% honest,

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:35.980
it's always, forever, no matter what, probably
going to be easier for you to google this

00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:37.430
rather than find a video on it.

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:41.500
It will be quicker, it'll just make more sense,
especially considering there's like a million

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:45.699
trillion places in this world where people
change their names and a video is only being

00:00:45.699 --> 00:00:49.170
made by one person I think Iffskjdnkjtnrkjn-
I was going to say I think I just pronounced

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:54.730
two of those words wrong but then I just pronounced,
like, a bunch of words wrong and then...

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:57.160
I feel like I'm not a person right now.

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:59.309
Tons of people change their name for many
reasons.

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:04.030
Probably, being trans is very low on the list
of reasons that people actually change their

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:10.040
names so no matter where you live, there will
be an extensive page of instructions and by

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.580
page I mean probably lots of pages of instructions
on how to change your name and it will be

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:17.860
a very official site and you won't be hearing
it through someone like me who's like..

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:18.860
Not..

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:20.360
Somebody who changes your name for you.

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:25.360
As for gender marker changes: probably not
as well documented in the legal world.

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:29.110
Probably can't find very specific instructions
for that on the internet, I couldn't.

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:33.770
But your local DMV or motor vehicle association,
whatever, should be able to tell you what

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:37.390
you need to give them in order for them to
change your gender marker on your permit and

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:44.340
then you know.. *indistinguishable sounds*
But, like I said, every single place is different

00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:48.070
and there is no way that I can really be that
helpful considering I live where I live and

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:53.810
not where you live unless you live in Maryland
in which case you DO need a surgery to change

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:55.810
your gender marker.

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:57.000
Even on your permit.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.000
License.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Some people can drive well.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.000
So can I!

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.520
I have a license.

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.840
If you don't have the means to change your
name on all of your official documents don't

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.180
feel like you're stuck and at a stand still
and that your birth name is just going to

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:13.920
be plastered everywhere even though you hate
it because, in a lot of situations, people

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.780
will change your name for you on a lot of
things without it being "legally changed".

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:23.220
For example, at my college you can get your
name changed on your ID and on online portions

00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:27.020
of whatever that we use for online classes
and stuff.

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:29.840
You can get your name changed on there without
it being legally changed.

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:33.130
In year books for school, if you're in high
school, they should be able to change your

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:35.950
name in that yearbook without it being legally
changed.

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:40.200
Well, they definitely, that should be a thing,
unless they're transphobic.

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.680
Because these things are not legal documents.

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.840
If the thing with your name on it is not a
legal document you don't need your legal name

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:45.840
on it.

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.610
If you're marker your gender in some box and
it's not a legal document, you don't need

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:49.910
your legal gender in it.

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:53.420
My gender marker is still an F. I have all
the things I need to change it, I just, I

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.930
haven't gotten around to it yet and it's not
causing me any sort of difficulties at all

00:02:56.930 --> 00:02:58.290
keeping it an F right now.

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:02.530
The thing is, if this was before when I was
pre-t, you know, I was all over trying to

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:05.770
get everything changed as soon as possible
because the thing is, people would look on

00:03:05.770 --> 00:03:09.860
my IDs and stuff and look for that information
to see what they should call me because, you

00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:14.010
know, we all go through that awkward androgynous
phase where no one knows what the fuck you

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:15.010
are.

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:20.371
At this point, no one looks there because,
you know, they see this and see this and they

00:03:20.371 --> 00:03:22.280
don't look there and if they did look there...

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:23.280
They wouldn't.

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:24.280
They don't look there.

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:26.170
It's too boring to look through everything
on someone's ID.

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:27.890
Like, why would anyone do that?

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:32.351
What I'm saying is I put male on tons of different,
you know, items that are put in front of me

00:03:32.351 --> 00:03:33.351
with little check boxes.

00:03:33.351 --> 00:03:37.050
Like, I don't put female even though I could
pull out my license and it would tell me what

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:39.790
to put and I would be like "no thank you".

00:03:39.790 --> 00:03:43.690
I'll tell them that I'm trans if I need to,
but however, in most cases, it's just male.

00:03:43.690 --> 00:03:47.760
M. And it will never come back to bite me
because I'm not putting this check on legal

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:48.760
documents.

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:50.950
So honestly, if you don't have the means to
change your name, you don't have the means

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:54.860
to change your gender, it does not mean that
you can't, you know, put your real name and

00:03:54.860 --> 00:03:58.510
your real gender all over the world everywhere
for everyone to see in all kinds of official

00:03:58.510 --> 00:03:59.510
ways.

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:00.530
You can.

00:04:00.530 --> 00:04:01.530
It's your name, it's your gender.

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:03.940
You can do whatever the fuck you want with
it.

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:07.030
There should be some option available to you
where everyone will not have to see your gender.

00:04:07.030 --> 00:04:11.780
I know in many documents if you have to put
a gender you can say you would rather not

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:16.239
say and that's as acceptable as anything else
in the world.

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:17.239
Except for murder.

00:04:17.239 --> 00:04:20.949
Well, there's a lot of things that that's
not as acceptable as because some things are

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:21.969
unacceptable.

00:04:21.969 --> 00:04:23.689
See you next Saturday.

00:04:23.689 --> 00:04:24.990
This video was...

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:25.990
Something.

00:04:25.990 --> 00:04:26.990
So.

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:27.990
That..

00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:28.470
And goodbye.
