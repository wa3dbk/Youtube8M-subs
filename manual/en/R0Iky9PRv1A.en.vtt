00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:04.529
Alright, today I’m going to show you how
to fix and repair almost anything on the Wii U

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:09.200
controller. We’re going to start off by
taking out the battery. It’s underneath

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:15.469
two phillips head screws underneath the back
battery door. Take that off and then just

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:20.560
unplug the battery from the main controller.
They do sell bigger batteries. I’ll link

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:24.710
those in the video description below. It gives
you a whole lot more play time so you can

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:29.630
check those out. And then there’s a bunch
of little black plastic tabs covering all

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:35.219
the screw holes right here. And underneath
all these little tabs is a screw that’s

00:00:35.219 --> 00:00:39.629
called a tri wing. So you can take that and
unscrew all the little screws and then the

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:45.690
back plastic bit just pops right up. There
is a little plug holding the back plastic

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:54.069
part to the main board so you’re just going
to grab that and unplug it. Pretty straight

00:00:54.069 --> 00:00:58.089
forward. And then you can see that all the
little buttons…so we’ve got the triggers

00:00:58.089 --> 00:01:04.080
right here that just pop up and out. Same
thing with this other side. They’re just

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:11.640
kind of stuck down in a little clasp you just
have to wiggle free. And same thing with these

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:21.780
top buttons; the left and the right just slide
down the little grooves. And then right here,

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:29.560
this is the little contraption that controls
the majority of the buttons. So there are

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:32.990
a bunch of screws holding that in place. And
you can see this little ribbon cable that

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:37.740
you have to lift up the latch and unlatch
it. So if your buttons stop working, most

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:43.160
likely you’ll need to replace this guy right
here or just the ribbon cables depending on

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:49.200
what they’re selling. Now the little stick
that you’re going to be playing with, these

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.700
break a lot and so the whole pad comes up
with the circuit board and just plugs into

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:57.810
the main board that you can see right here.
So if it ever stops working or if it gets

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:04.450
stuck or broken, just buy a little contraption
and plug that in and you’ll be good to go.

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:09.659
Now the bottom sync button as well as the
port is plugged into the main board as well

00:02:09.659 --> 00:02:14.560
as that little ribbon cable connector. So
I’m going to unplug both of those things

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:18.799
and then wiggle it free from the little white
bracket that it’s in. It’s got the little

00:02:18.799 --> 00:02:27.840
hooks on the side there. Now that’s free.
Then there are four screws holding on the

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:34.480
main board to the controller. So once those
are done you have a few more power cable connections

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:41.230
and ribbon cable connections to undo. Lift
up the little clasp, pull the ribbon cable

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:49.450
out. Lift up the other clasp, pull that ribbon
cable out. It’s all kinds of fun. Then I’m

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:56.170
going to take apart the other side button
control panel I guess you can call that, just

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:59.779
so I have more room to work with. You don’t
necessarily need to do this if you’re just

00:02:59.779 --> 00:03:05.159
getting in to replace the screen or something.
And then just unplug that other joy stick.

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:10.310
Get rid of a few more tiny connections. And
this one’s pretty important so lift up at

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:15.409
two points on that little latch so you don’t
break it. If you lift up at one point it might

00:03:15.409 --> 00:03:21.659
be too much pressure and it might snap it.
Anyway, keep on working with all the little

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:35.439
connections that are attaching the main board
to the controller. Going to pull those loose.

00:03:35.439 --> 00:03:46.019
Just working my way around the outside. Now
that releases most of the things attached

00:03:46.019 --> 00:03:51.999
to the main board. There are two sensors that
are still attached up at the top, but you

00:03:51.999 --> 00:03:56.389
need to lift up the main board in order to
get to them. Now remember what…remember

00:03:56.389 --> 00:04:05.159
the orientation of the wire as you lift this
out. So right now the wire is facing in towards

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:13.859
the board. And then on this other side, the
white wire, it’s still facing the inside

00:04:13.859 --> 00:04:19.410
of the board as well. So untangle that and
then lift it up from the slot. You can see

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:24.250
right here where I take apart the volume slider
switch, remember that when you put that into

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:30.389
the mother board it has to fit on the groove
of the little slider as well, otherwise your

00:04:30.389 --> 00:04:35.669
volume will stop working. And there’s the
main board. You can see right there the camera

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:46.220
as well on the backside. And then right here
you can see the little pad, so if you ever

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:49.620
need to take that apart to clean it there’s
a little notch in the corner there that aligns

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:55.479
where it needs to be. And now for the screen
bracket. So there are four Philips head screws

00:04:55.479 --> 00:05:04.030
around the outside of this that you’re going
to unscrew. And the plastic screen bracket

00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:08.500
just kind of keeps the screen in place. So
once those screws are undone that’ll come

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:13.090
loose and you’ll be able to pry up the screen.
Be super careful while you’re doing this;

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:19.180
only pry up on the metal frame of it and don’t
pull up on the screen in any way that will

00:05:19.180 --> 00:05:27.060
break the LCD underneath. Now when you’re
replacing the screen it could be one of two

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:32.530
things: it might come with the digitizer,
which is the outer part, or it might just

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:37.520
come with the LCD underneath. So you might
need to separate that little contraption in

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:42.440
order to finish the repair. But it’s not
too bad; there are just little clasps that

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:47.090
hold the two sections together. Now the buttons
are kind of fun. Remember that game you used

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:50.940
to play as a kid where like if the plastic
square wouldn’t fit in the circle hole and

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:55.530
the circle wouldn’t fit in the square hole?
This is kind of the same thing. Each of these

00:05:55.530 --> 00:06:01.300
little buttons has its own little notch so
one button won’t fit in the other button’s

00:06:01.300 --> 00:06:06.990
hole if that makes sense. It’s kind of fun.
Interesting way to keep all the buttons in

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:10.879
the right spot. Anyway if you have any questions
be sure to leave them in the comments below.
