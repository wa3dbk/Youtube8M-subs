00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:05.550
Hi. I'm Karen Grete from Scandinavian
Today. We are getting closer to the

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:11.410
holidays, and in front of me, I have the
four advents candles on the advents

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:17.850
wreath. Or in Danish, it's called advents
krans, and I'm going to light the

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:25.070
first candle, and, of course, when I
light...when the day comes that I can

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:34.000
light the fourth candle, we are close to
Christmas. I'm going to make Risengrød,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.790
a traditional dish for the holidays.
Here I have the rice.

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:42.180
I have the milk, and I'm going to show you
how I make it. And now I'm going to cook

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:53.430
the rice, and first, I'm going to pour two
cups of water and let it boil.

00:00:53.430 --> 00:01:00.000
And after it's boiled, it's boiling, I'm
going to add a cup of rice.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.530
The rice, I have already rinsed in cold
water, so it's clean because I'm going to

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:15.500
make Risengrød. Now, I can add it
to the water, and I'm going to keep an eye

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:25.860
on the rice. I will stir it, keep stirring
it. And when it's boiling completely,

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:32.430
I'm going to add the milk. The water is
boiling now, and I'm going to let it cook

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:42.150
for about 10 minutes under the lid. And
I'm going to turn down the heat,

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:47.850
so I'm going to cook it at low heat for
about 10 minutes. And after that, I add

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:55.370
the four cups of milk. Almost all the
water has been absorbed by the rice now,

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:59.380
so it's time to add the milk. And, of
course, you want to stir it a little bit

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:06.460
to make sure it doesn't burn at the
bottom. So here, we are adding two cups of

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:15.870
milk and another two cups of milk. So now,
I want to have it boiling,

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:24.320
and I keep stirring, and after it starts
to boil, I turn down the heat, at a very

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:30.310
low heat. And I put on the cover, but you
might want to stir in between.

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:35.640
Now the milk is boiling, so I turn it down
to a very low flame,

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:40.990
and I put on the lid. And I will let it
cook for about 25 minutes,

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:48.150
25 to 40 minutes. You want to check on it
after 25 minutes. My rice porridge is

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:54.213
cooked. It's firm, and, of course, in
Danish, it's called Risengrød,

00:02:54.213 --> 00:03:01.107
and I'm ready to eat it. And I want to
tell you a little story about Risengrød.

00:03:01.107 --> 00:03:05.260
When I was a child, we always
celebrated Christmas when my grandparents,

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:11.650
on the island, Møn, they had a big farm.
And my grandmother would always put rice

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:19.370
porridge in the attic for the little
Nisse. And, of course,

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:25.840
I had my suspicion that probably was the
cats that ate all the rice porridge.

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:31.730
But anyway, that was a tradition, and she
did it every single year on the 24th in

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:38.340
the evening. And also, you might have
heard of a Danish song. It sounds like

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:46.750
this. ♪ [foreign language] ♪. And I'm not
singing anymore, but anyway,

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:51.780
it means, in the attic, the elf is sitting
with his Christmas pudding.

00:03:51.780 --> 00:04:00.090
And now, I'm going to serve it, so I serve
it in a Royal Copenhagen plate.

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:05.520
And, as you can tell, it's warm Risengrød
or rice porridge.

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:13.740
Okay. Then I'm going to sprinkle cinnamon
sugar on it, like that.

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:20.480
Here we are, and, of course, in the
center, I need some butter to melt which

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:30.000
is really tasty. And the tradition is to
eat Risengrød with...I mean,

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.690
the tradition is to drink other beer,
and, of course, you want to have a

00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:38.430
non-alcoholic beer with your Risengrød.
Or you can use black currant

00:04:38.430 --> 00:04:44.280
juice, a red currant juice, any of it
tastes really good. So, I'm going to taste

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:50.720
my Risengrød. It's still kind of
warm, but yes, I like it.

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:54.910
