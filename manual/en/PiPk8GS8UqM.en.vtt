00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:06.350
How to Train Your Bird to Talk.

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:10.230
Birds aren’t like babies—you can’t expect
them to pick up speech just by babbling away

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:11.280
at them.

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:12.920
You need a plan.

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:19.340
You will need The right breed of bird Time
Treats and patience.

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:20.420
Step 1.

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:24.450
If you haven’t already bought Tweety, pick
a breed that is known for its chattiness.

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:30.450
Amazon parrots and African greys are the gabbiest,
followed by macaws, male cockatiels, mynahs,

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:32.250
and parakeets.

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:38.260
Female cockatiels, female budgies, grass parakeets,
rosellas, and canaries don’t talk.

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:39.410
Step 2.

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:43.070
Once you’ve narrowed your choices to a talkative
breed, focus your attention on choosing a

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:46.510
bird that seems alert and interested in what’s
going on around him.

00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:49.190
These are clues that he’ll make a good talker.

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:50.570
Step 3.

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:52.100
Get a young bird.

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.100
Like the proverbial old dog who can’t learn
new tricks, an older bird is going to have

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.489
more trouble picking up speech.

00:00:58.489 --> 00:00:59.630
Step 4.

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:02.620
Give the bird a name that is no more than
two syllables.

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:06.750
A longer name reduces the chances that he
will learn to say his own name.

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:08.210
Step 5.

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:12.310
If you’re married and/or have children,
pick one person to teach the bird.

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:16.140
If several people are trying to instruct the
bird, it will only confuse it.

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.470
Birds learn more easily from women.

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:20.950
Step 6.

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:23.130
Start training at the optimal time.

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.130
For smaller birds, that’s at four to six
months.

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:29.210
For bigger birds, wait until they’re six
to twelve months.

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:33.549
Don’t teach a bird to whistle before training
him to talk, or it will make the speech lessons

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:35.299
that much harder.

00:01:35.299 --> 00:01:36.369
Step 7.

00:01:36.369 --> 00:01:40.420
Start training by saying a few simple words
to Tweety, always using them under the same

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:41.510
circumstances.

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:45.350
For example, you could say “Good morning”
every day when you first rise, and you could

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:49.040
reserve “Bye” for when the bird can see
you walk out the door.

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:50.800
Step 8.

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:53.409
Repeat the words several times in each instance.

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:57.680
You want the bird to start associating the
sound you are making with the context.

00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:58.970
Step 9.

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:02.570
Give Tweety a treat every time he repeats
something you are teaching him.

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:07.530
Remember that birds don’t just repeat what
you want them to; they mimic sounds they hear.

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:12.439
So if you’re suffering a bout of loud flatulence,
or getting ready to rip someone a new one,

00:02:12.439 --> 00:02:13.439
stay out of Tweety’s earshot.

00:02:13.439 --> 00:02:15.290
Step 10.

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:19.329
If Tweety has picked up a bad word, washing
his mouth out with soap won’t work.

00:02:19.329 --> 00:02:23.409
But ignoring him when he repeats the word
will, because getting your attention is his

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:25.099
main incentive.

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:26.299
Step 11.

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:29.200
Now enjoy chatting with your fine-feathered
friend!

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:34.250
Did you know Talking birds often will imitate
your phone’s ring tone because they get

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:36.349
a kick out of watching you come running.
