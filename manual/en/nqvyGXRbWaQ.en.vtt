Velvet choker is really sexy. For instance,
here is Yuliya Mayarchuk wearing it throughout

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:17.610
"Cheeky" - a 2000 flick by our favourite fat
guy Tinto Brass. Looking damn hot in it. So

00:00:19.399 --> 00:00:25.980
damn hot, that only a couple years after the
film release this shy Ukrainian girl started

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:32.980
dating world's renown, A-list actor Gerard
Butler. The one from 300 that screamed this

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:40.300
is Sparta. Actually, that's a sure-fire girl
pickup advice. As Yulia showed everything

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:50.920
in high definition detail in that movie, Gerard
could give the object complete private scrutiny

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:58.790
before asking her out. It's nice to be a superstar.
Poor common folk like me and you - we are

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:06.720
fooled even on the beach by all those push-up
bras and slimming panties. I first saw these

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:13.460
velvet collars on girls in mid 90s, and then
they disappeared as quickly as they came into

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:20.460
fashion. Until later in 2000, when they were
adopted by Gothic girls, spoiling all the

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:27.860
sexy image by their black-painted mess of
a face. But now we have EBay! These are listed

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:35.010
as Gothic Lolita necklace for some reason,
even though personally I don't remember Nabokov's

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:42.010
character wearing a collar. Let's order this
one. Unboxing! I don't like the chain much,

00:01:55.619 --> 00:02:02.080
I would prefer a seamless band with some invisible
locker. And the charm will go to the recycle

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:09.080
bin at once. Let's try it on. Looks nice.
But Yulia still has the best one.
