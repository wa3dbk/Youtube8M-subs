Hi Foodies!

00:00:00.996 --> 00:00:02.396
Don’t tell anyone,

00:00:02.426 --> 00:00:04.156
but sometimes I like to wash my hands

00:00:04.177 --> 00:00:07.887
using dish soap to get rid of the fishy smell.

00:00:08.247 --> 00:00:08.898
Turns out,

00:00:08.898 --> 00:00:12.938
using normal soap is not the best option

00:00:12.943 --> 00:00:14.153
to wash your hands,

00:00:14.271 --> 00:00:16.141
because the germs will still remain.

00:00:16.534 --> 00:00:17.974
The solution is to use

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.350
Lifebuoy Kitchen Fresh

00:00:19.366 --> 00:00:21.836
after touching fresh food.

00:00:22.293 --> 00:00:23.463
By scrubbing your hands

00:00:23.483 --> 00:00:25.153
for 10 seconds the germs

00:00:25.153 --> 00:00:28.083
and fishy smell will be gone.

00:00:28.465 --> 00:00:29.535
Let’s get cooking!

00:00:36.763 --> 00:00:37.563
