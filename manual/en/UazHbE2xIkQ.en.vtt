00:00:03.914 --> 00:00:05.724
- When last have you been snorkeling?

00:00:05.724 --> 00:00:06.869
- Well, a long time ago.

00:00:06.869 --> 00:00:07.446
- True.

00:00:07.707 --> 00:00:08.952
- Yeah, in some random pool.

00:00:08.952 --> 00:00:10.718
- (laughs) You snorkeled in a pool?

00:00:10.718 --> 00:00:11.421
- I did.

00:00:11.421 --> 00:00:12.395
- That's ghetto!

00:00:12.395 --> 00:00:13.921
- I've snorkeled

00:00:13.921 --> 00:00:15.657
In the ocean before.
- [Skyy] That is goddamn ghetto!

00:00:15.657 --> 00:00:18.197
Snorkeling in a pool is
some ghetto ass shit, okay?

00:00:18.197 --> 00:00:20.341
Jesus Christ, snorkeling in a pool!

00:00:20.341 --> 00:00:21.822
- I've snorkeled in the ocean before, too.

00:00:21.822 --> 00:00:22.725
Stop that.

00:00:22.725 --> 00:00:23.506
- [Skyy] Yeah, but a swimming pool?

00:00:23.506 --> 00:00:24.735
Everybody snorkeling in no damn pool.

00:00:24.735 --> 00:00:26.104
- I snorkeled in a swimming pool.

00:00:26.104 --> 00:00:27.120
- [Skyy] Were you looking for a seashell?

00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:28.373
In the goddamn swimming pool?

00:00:28.373 --> 00:00:29.387
That's freaky.

00:00:29.387 --> 00:00:30.629
- Someone's band-aid.

00:00:30.629 --> 00:00:32.616
- [Skyy] (laughing)
Searching for a band-aid?

00:00:32.986 --> 00:00:34.548
- They're always floating in some pool.

00:00:34.933 --> 00:00:36.164
You always find one.

00:00:37.871 --> 00:00:39.139
- [Skyy] What's that?

00:00:39.139 --> 00:00:39.961
- Grape vodka.

00:00:39.961 --> 00:00:40.652
- [Skyy] Well pour some

00:00:40.652 --> 00:00:42.496
and stop asking questions.
- Alright, sorry.

00:00:42.496 --> 00:00:45.360
(gasps) Why is it blue instead of purple?

00:00:46.606 --> 00:00:47.831
- [Skyy] 7-Up.

00:00:48.031 --> 00:00:49.419
Or a lemon-lime soda.

00:00:49.419 --> 00:00:52.406
- Just a little splashy, splashter?

00:00:52.406 --> 00:00:53.521
- [Skyy] Cause this is a shot.

00:00:53.521 --> 00:00:54.876
- Exactly, so you...

00:00:54.876 --> 00:00:56.341
- [Skyy] Cranberry juice.
- (whispers) Don't want it.

00:00:56.341 --> 00:00:57.801
- [Skyy] Hit this with
a little bit of that.

00:00:58.724 --> 00:01:00.137
- Okay, okay.

00:01:03.674 --> 00:01:05.435
- That's almost too much, no?

00:01:05.435 --> 00:01:06.304
- [Skyy] It's up to you.

00:01:06.966 --> 00:01:08.203
You're the one who drinkin' it!

00:01:09.556 --> 00:01:10.627
- And now...

00:01:10.735 --> 00:01:11.878
- [Skyy] What am I gonna say?

00:01:11.878 --> 00:01:14.360
Shake that shit and keep it sexy!

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.304
(laughs)

00:01:16.304 --> 00:01:17.485
- Let's see what I got. This sucks.

00:01:17.485 --> 00:01:19.030
- [Skyy] Did you put your body into it?
- Ow!!

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:20.329
- [Skyy] Did you put your
body into it a little bit?

00:01:20.329 --> 00:01:21.748
Don't you do what you got, insanity?

00:01:21.748 --> 00:01:22.893
What about some insanity moves?

00:01:22.893 --> 00:01:25.856
(laughs)

00:01:25.856 --> 00:01:26.823
Go ahead!

00:01:30.085 --> 00:01:31.113
- Leave me alone.

00:01:31.113 --> 00:01:31.770
Okay this is--

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.504
- [Skyy] Uh, that is
really not frickin' sexy.

00:01:33.504 --> 00:01:34.635
- Sorry!

00:01:36.927 --> 00:01:38.632
- [Skyy] Jesus Christ, what color is that?

00:01:38.985 --> 00:01:40.772
Okay, so that's not right then.

00:01:40.772 --> 00:01:43.373
That's fuckin' short. (laughs)

00:01:43.373 --> 00:01:44.407
- (laughs)
- [Man] Damn.

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:46.314
And there you have it!

00:01:46.607 --> 00:01:47.575
The Snorkel.

00:01:47.575 --> 00:01:50.023
Sophie, are you ready to snorkel?

00:01:50.023 --> 00:01:52.436
- (laughs) I will try.

00:01:52.436 --> 00:01:53.809
- [Skyy] Here's how this done.

00:01:53.809 --> 00:01:56.223
You seal the glass with your hand,

00:01:56.223 --> 00:01:58.552
leaving just a little bit of space, okay?

00:01:59.259 --> 00:02:01.818
You have it sealed, then you
bring this up here, okay?

00:02:01.818 --> 00:02:05.642
Keep it air-tight, and you go
upside-down, like a snorkel.

00:02:05.642 --> 00:02:08.014
And allow the drink to go into your mouth.

00:02:08.014 --> 00:02:09.134
Okay?

00:02:09.134 --> 00:02:11.410
So, basically you're
snorkeling some booze.

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:12.941
- Great.

00:02:12.941 --> 00:02:13.929
- Man up, let's do it!

00:02:13.929 --> 00:02:15.484
- Oh God, okay.

00:02:15.622 --> 00:02:17.801
- I really don't--
- Get a nice, air-tight seal.

00:02:17.801 --> 00:02:19.328
- Well, I have to hold it like this.

00:02:19.328 --> 00:02:20.796
- That's fine, that's fine, that's fine.

00:02:21.334 --> 00:02:23.641
And the glass gotta be upside-down, okay?

00:02:23.641 --> 00:02:24.737
- Exactly.

00:02:24.737 --> 00:02:26.093
- This a 180, girl.

00:02:26.093 --> 00:02:28.560
- Okay, alright, here we go.

00:02:29.052 --> 00:02:30.483
Can I already drink it?

00:02:30.483 --> 00:02:31.745
- Okay, so put it in your mouth.

00:02:31.745 --> 00:02:32.852
Now flip!

00:02:33.976 --> 00:02:36.615
Turn to the camera, turn
to the camera. (laughs)

00:02:36.615 --> 00:02:37.761
Oh my God.

00:02:39.991 --> 00:02:41.101
Did it go in your nose?

00:02:41.147 --> 00:02:44.338
(laughs) She spit it back in the glass!

00:02:44.338 --> 00:02:46.622
Don't turn to the camera now!

00:02:46.622 --> 00:02:48.898
Wait a minute, how's that possible?

00:02:48.898 --> 00:02:50.058
That was gone!

00:02:50.058 --> 00:02:51.120
Now it's back!

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:54.065
I think we just, I witnessed a miracle!

00:02:54.065 --> 00:02:55.412
Thank you Jesus!

00:02:56.273 --> 00:02:57.453
- Let me try it again.

00:02:57.683 --> 00:03:00.075
I will try it again, and I will master it!

00:03:00.075 --> 00:03:01.471
- [Skyy] Ready?
- Yeah.

00:03:09.326 --> 00:03:12.895
(Skyy laughs)

00:03:12.896 --> 00:03:14.171
- I'm glad you find it funny.

00:03:15.294 --> 00:03:16.521
I'm glad you find it funny.

00:03:16.597 --> 00:03:18.891
To see more Tipsy... (laughs)

00:03:18.891 --> 00:03:20.033
Is it in your ears?

00:03:20.093 --> 00:03:21.358
- It's everywhere.

00:03:21.358 --> 00:03:22.603
On this side of my face.

00:03:22.603 --> 00:03:23.882
- You smell like grapes, okay?

00:03:23.882 --> 00:03:24.772
It's the best you ever smelled, okay?

00:03:24.772 --> 00:03:25.717
- How 'bout you try that!

00:03:25.717 --> 00:03:27.014
Shut up.
(Skyy laughs)

00:03:27.014 --> 00:03:28.967
I'm gonna go ahead and
clean myself up now.

00:03:29.167 --> 00:03:30.199
I'll be back.

00:03:30.491 --> 00:03:32.614
Goodbye!
(Skyy laughs)

00:03:32.614 --> 00:03:35.340
That was great, snorkeling is so much fun!

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:36.816
Woohoo!

00:03:37.677 --> 00:03:39.735
Bastard!
(Skyy laughs harder)

00:03:39.735 --> 00:03:41.221
Tipsy Bartender. (laughs)

00:03:41.221 --> 00:03:42.690
- Thanks for watching this video.
