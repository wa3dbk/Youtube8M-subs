00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.620
Green hair is pretty common at the New York
City St. Patrick's Day parade,

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.620
and some people even dye their hair green
all year long as a fashion statement.

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:13.250
But others develop green hair accidentally
without hair dye.

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:16.300
Today, I'll tell you the cause and how to
treat it.

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:17.300
Hello,

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:18.300
Iâ€™m Dr. Neal Schultz

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:19.300
[pause]

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:20.300
And welcome to DermTV.

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:28.610
The culprit is exposure of hair to high levels
of copper.

00:00:28.610 --> 00:00:32.689
Yes, what causes hair to look green is literally
copper coating hair shafts.

00:00:32.689 --> 00:00:34.930
And this is much more common in people

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:39.969
with blond, chemically lightened, grey or
white hair.

00:00:39.969 --> 00:00:42.670
The two most common situations in which this
occurs are

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:45.469
usage of regular tap water in the shower or
bath,

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:47.670
and also from swimming pools.

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.230
Additionally, copper coatings on the surface
of the hair shafts

00:00:51.230 --> 00:00:53.399
which cause the green coloration.

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:55.629
These coatings are much more apt to occur

00:00:55.629 --> 00:00:57.890
if the cuticle of the hair has been damaged,

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:01.420
whether by frequent hot air drying, sun exposure,
chlorine exposure,

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:05.770
peroxide bleaching, or chemical straightening.

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:08.480
High copper levels in tap water are usually
caused by copper

00:01:08.480 --> 00:01:11.400
leaching out from old copper pipes in the
house

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.080
despite the copper levels in the water being
normal

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:16.960
before the water enters the home plumbing
system.

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:23.110
And high copper levels can also occur naturally
in hard well water.

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:27.240
Green hair from swimming pools is not caused
directly by the chlorine.

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.850
Instead, while chlorine damages the cuticle
making it more susceptible to copper coating,

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.710
the chlorine itself doesn't turn the hair
green.

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:39.010
Again it's excess copper coating on the hair,

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:41.460
either from high levels in the water put into
the pool,

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.920
or from old copper pipes going to the pool

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:49.660
or most commonly from copper algaecides used
to kill algae in swimming pools.

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:54.600
If your hair does turn green, you can remove
the discoloration easily

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.250
by using a shampoo that chelates the metal,

00:01:57.250 --> 00:01:59.840
which is just a chemists way of saying removing
it.

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.770
Ask your dermatologist or hair dresser for
recommendations.

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:07.620
Ss green hair is most apt to occur when damaged,

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:11.909
light colored hair is exposed to elevated
copper levels in water.

00:02:11.909 --> 00:02:15.870
But interestingly, if you consistently drink
water with too much copper

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:20.470
causing elevated copper levels inside your
body and inside the hair shaft,

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:22.940
the hair doesn't turn green.

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:39.089
If you want to know why, ask Kermit.
