What is going on everybody? Bluecore here coming to you LIVE from Sonic Central.

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:23.020
Here to talk about the Latest, and Greatest in Sonic news and updates.

00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:29.000
First off our head story. Silver Sonic in Sonic Boom.

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:37.040
There has been an image floating around with something that seems to looks like Silver Sonic from Sonic 2.

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:45.260
There has been numerous debates on whenever this is Truly Silver Sonic or just and Sonic like Statue.

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:50.440
As of right now we have not gotten anything confirmed by Sega.

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.980
Are you hyped for GTA 5? Sega sure isn't!

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:02.640
The Sonic Boom Wii U release was moved up a whole week to November 11.

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.700
Sega hasn't gone on recorded to why they moved the release date up. 

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:14.660
However we have reason to believe that Sega is troubled by Sonic Boom's potential sales.

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:23.660
Next in today's stories. The first line of Sonic Boom toys have been found in Toy's R Us stores across the US.

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:28.520
After the months end, most US stores will carry them.

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:33.500
Sadly there are no plans for a release in Europe.

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:39.620
Finally before we go, aside from various creamy coffee puns

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:44.840
how many people do you think would be interested in a coffee cup like this?

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:53.140
This is just one of the many official Sega brand merchandise that will being to appear in store in the next coming months.

00:01:54.320 --> 00:02:03.220
Well that Cream Coffee mug is definitely something to grind for. But you better not steal her coffee or else that would be called mugging. 

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:11.260
If you are having trouble getting these jokes I guess you could say. I have a hard time espresso-ing myself.

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:11.760
...

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:13.000
That joke was so bad it hurt...

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:19.120
My name is Bluecore, and this is Sonic Central signing out!
