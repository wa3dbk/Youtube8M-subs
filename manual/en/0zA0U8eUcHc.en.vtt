Hi! My name is Kip Bradford and I am here
on behalf of Expert Village. In this clip

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:08.940
we are going to look at the different types
of audio cables that you are likely to run

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:17.650
into in doing your own repairs and manufacturing
your own cables. Now microphone cable and

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:23.160
other types of audio cable can also be balanced
and the advantage to balanced is that the

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:28.060
noise that is typically picked up or can be
picked up by an unbalanced cable will still

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:33.210
actually be picked up by the balance cable
but it will be picked up by the shield and

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:38.129
one of the conductors and it is almost like
magic and at the other end, they cancel each

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:45.591
other out and eliminate the interference or
at least squash it to a point where you are

00:00:45.591 --> 00:00:54.239
not going to hear it in most cases. So microphone
cables with XLR's are typically balanced,

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:59.649
quarter inch TRS are typically balanced but
not always but anything that has three contact

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:05.770
points is often times if not always, is always
balanced. The other thing is like RCA cable

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:11.450
or quarter inch or guitar cables, instrument
cables are typically non-balanced. They will

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:16.810
have a shield and a conductor, that's all.
So those are the three types of cables that

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:22.430
you are more than likely to come into. If
you go back to the speaker cable, it is very

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:28.600
important to keep your cables marked for a
purpose because you do not want to use an

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:34.119
instrument cable which is common for someone
to use a guitar cable in place of a speaker

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:38.850
cable and that has to do with the fact that
look how big that cable is. That can handle

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:44.719
a lot of wattage from your power amplifier
to your speaker. This cable is little tiny

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:50.960
skinny and is only designed to handle very
low levels. So what is the bad part about

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:55.969
using this type of a cable instead of speaker
cable for speaker wire is that you can damage

00:01:55.969 --> 00:02:00.340
your amplifier because you can't actually
put enough through here so it tries to give

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:06.530
it a 1000 watts for low end frequencies and
your amplifier will work too hard, over heat

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:15.271
and eventually go out on you but it has a
shield. You don't want to use speaker cables

00:02:15.271 --> 00:02:18.780
for instrument cables because there is not
a shield. There are two conductors but there

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:23.450
is on shield so you are likely to get some
hums and buzzes that you don't want. So if

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:27.440
you are getting some audio interference or
whatever, check and make sure you did not

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:33.730
grab a speaker cable with a quarter inch on
each side instead of instrument cable by accident.

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:38.820
Those are the three types of cables that you
are likely to run into if you are going to

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:40.880
do work with your own audio cable.
