00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:04.290
Hey, this is Annie
here for WTBD,

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:07.490
and today we're at Homestead
Miami Speedway in Florida

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:09.320
for the DARPA Robotics
Challenge, which

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:11.660
is a competition among
some of the top robots

00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:14.520
from across the world, testing
to see how they perform

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:17.420
in various tasks related
to disaster readiness.

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:19.740
So we're here to see some
of the robots up close,

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:21.140
and to see them in action.

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:23.430
The robots themselves are
from government, commercial,

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:25.650
and academic organizations,
and are some of the bot

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.960
world's shining stars, like
Valkyrie from NASA's Johnson

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.970
Space Center, the 6'2
humanoid destined for space.

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:35.450
Or the ape inspired
RoboSimian, also from NASA,

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:37.520
which can operate
on two legs or four.

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:39.670
Every one of these
limbs is actually

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:43.178
very similar to a
human limb, in that it

00:00:43.178 --> 00:00:45.857
has the same sort
of joints in it,

00:00:45.857 --> 00:00:49.753
in terms of the joints in the
shoulder, elbow, and wrist.

00:00:49.753 --> 00:00:53.162
The difference is that
on a RoboSimian limb,

00:00:53.162 --> 00:00:56.084
those joints are
all the way down,

00:00:56.084 --> 00:00:58.519
distributed along the
length of the robot.

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:00.780
And so that's a
very different way

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.728
than you would find in
a biological system,

00:01:02.728 --> 00:01:04.676
and so RoboSimian,
when it moves,

00:01:04.676 --> 00:01:07.402
moves in a way that
isn't always intuitive.

00:01:07.402 --> 00:01:09.110
As for the challenges,
they were designed

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:10.930
to replicate disaster response.

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:13.050
Navigating rocky
terrain, opening a door

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:16.250
and walking through, twisting
a valve, climbing a ladder.

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:18.250
But even something as
small as opening a door

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:21.060
is extremely challenging,
requiring months of practice,

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.230
and of course, watchful masters.

00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:26.866
This robot is an
ongoing development.

00:01:26.866 --> 00:01:29.120
We have a lot more
we would really

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:31.710
like to do to improves
its performance.

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.360
Things like how we're going to
approach grabbing a door handle

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.830
so that we can successfully push
it down and get the door open,

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:42.622
and what's the best way
to hold the door open

00:01:42.622 --> 00:01:44.850
as the robot drives
through doorway?

00:01:44.850 --> 00:01:45.910
Things of that nature.

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:47.640
But it wasn't just
about the competition.

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:49.720
Some special guests
also made an appearance,

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.190
like this LS3 Legged
Support System,

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:55.370
and Cheeta both from Boston
Dynamics, the latest robotics

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:57.570
company to be
snapped up by Google.

00:01:57.570 --> 00:01:59.570
The showcase displayed
the potential of robotics

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:01.930
to act in the crucial
area of disaster response.

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:04.280
An exciting future for
many, including the hundreds

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:05.800
of spectators cheering them on.

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:08.100
But the reality of
robotics was also clear.

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:11.480
Failure is common, and success
happens slowly, and only

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.240
with enormous
support from humans.

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:14.000
So who won?

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:16.570
Schaft, a Japanese
robot maker also owned

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:19.575
by Google, whose robot dominated
the competition with 27

00:02:19.575 --> 00:02:21.120
of 32 points.

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.950
The top eight teams
will get DARPA funding

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.746
through the 2014 trials.

00:02:24.746 --> 00:02:26.620
As always, you can let
me know your reactions

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:28.925
on Twitter, Facebook,
Vk or Google,

00:02:28.925 --> 00:02:30.555
all @AnnieGaus,
where you can also

00:02:30.555 --> 00:02:32.104
send me show ideas or feedback.

00:02:32.104 --> 00:02:34.020
Thank you for watching,
and see you next time.

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:44.270
Oh, my god!
