[music]

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:33.890
&gt;&gt;ANTHONY: So welcome back to Morrocco Method
International,

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:37.460
where natural things happen. The home of the
Five Elements.

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:41.400
And today we're going to be discussing the
styling gel.

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:41.900
&gt;&gt;LAURELLE: Mmhm.

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:45.230
&gt;&gt;ANTHONY: Which I have said for decades,
mousse abuse.

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:48.770
You know there's so much out there that's
really

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:53.140
within, mostly within all the gels today and
all the

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:57.260
styling gels and the mousses, is like polymers.

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.970
You know what polymers are? Most don't even
know

00:00:59.970 --> 00:01:03.100
what a polymer is. It's like made in a laboratory.

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:04.489
But it's liquid plastic.

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:05.759
&gt;&gt;LAURELLE: That's right, yes.

00:01:05.759 --> 00:01:08.250
&gt;&gt;ANTHONY: So it's literally plastic that
has been

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:11.720
liquified sprayed on the hair. And I have
seen so...

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.960
You know, to me, the tragedy is the youth.
The adults?

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:17.760
Well, you know we have some kind of experience
and background

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:21.250
and we know it's happening to some degree,
not all of it.

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:23.510
But the youth really are not aware.

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:27.370
And I see like nine year olds now, 13 year
olds, 17 year olds,

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:28.670
with 50 percent hair loss.

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:29.680
&gt;&gt;LAURELLE: Oh really?

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:30.700
&gt;&gt;ANTHONY: Oh yeah.

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:31.710
&gt;&gt;LAURELLE: Oh, that's...

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:32.560
&gt;&gt;ANTHONY: That young.

00:01:32.560 --> 00:01:34.880
&gt;&gt;LAURELLE: Oh, that's really horrifying.

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:35.600
&gt;&gt;ANTHONY: It's shocking.

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:36.650
&gt;&gt;LAURELLE: Oh, no I...

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:38.840
&gt;&gt;ANTHONY: And they don't really understand,
you know,

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:40.940
what's going on and I say to the parents,
you know,

00:01:40.940 --> 00:01:44.060
when I do find out, I usually say to the parents,

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.080
you know, 'Is your daughter or is your son
using, you know,

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:50.260
mousse? Are they using gels? Are they using
styling aids?'

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:54.920
'Oh yeah!' And I say 'Well that's the problem,
get rid of them.'

00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:01.439
So this styling gel, which is really the Blood
of the Dragons Styling Gel.

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:06.580
We love the Dragon. The friendly dragon from
Morrocco Method International.

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:12.760
This is made from the filet, which is the
inside, of the aloe plant.

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:17.980
And it's all, of course, organic and very
natural.

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:20.560
And you'll see the ingredient lists coming
down.

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.790
Always read the ingredient list, please do
yourself a favor.

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:28.450
Our health is our wealth. And again, some
people say, well

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:31.900
I can't afford it. I go 'That's fine, of course,
you know,

00:02:31.900 --> 00:02:36.680
I can't afford certain things myself, but
we get what we pay for.

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:40.760
So if you're buying something less expensive,
four times less than the price,

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:44.029
and you're getting a very inferior product

00:02:44.029 --> 00:02:46.489
and you're getting hair loss or you're getting
dandruff

00:02:46.489 --> 00:02:48.139
or you're getting a scalp disorder.

00:02:48.139 --> 00:02:50.719
When you're having hair problems,

00:02:50.719 --> 00:02:54.489
then I think it's a wise investment versus
going to a dermatologist.

00:02:54.489 --> 00:02:59.209
&gt;&gt;LAURELLE: No question. And check out the
prices.

00:02:59.209 --> 00:03:00.049
They are inarguably fair.

00:03:00.049 --> 00:03:01.290
&gt;&gt;ANTHONY: Yes, but we...

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.769
&gt;&gt;LAURELLE: They are very, very fairly priced,

00:03:03.769 --> 00:03:07.419
for an all-natural...and the quantities...

00:03:07.419 --> 00:03:09.120
This goes a long way, little bit will do you,

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.189
it's highly concentrated and this, for instance,
is six ounces.

00:03:12.189 --> 00:03:15.959
And I think that they're extremely affordable

00:03:15.959 --> 00:03:18.849
for what you're getting and the quantity.

00:03:18.849 --> 00:03:22.639
And for the fact that a little bit does go
a long way.

00:03:22.639 --> 00:03:24.549
&gt;&gt;ANTHONY: And again, we're super concentrated.

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:26.069
This is very concentrated.

00:03:26.069 --> 00:03:26.829
&gt;&gt;LAURELLE: Oh yes.

00:03:26.829 --> 00:03:28.909
&gt;&gt;ANTHONY: So you have the six ounces, and
then we have

00:03:28.909 --> 00:03:31.329
the trial and travel two ounces.

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:34.620
&gt;&gt;LAURELLE: That's very handy for just throwing
in a bag.

00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:37.079
&gt;&gt;ANTHONY: Look, there it is.

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:38.480
And it's like again...

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:39.189
&gt;&gt;LAURELLE: Very concentrated.

00:03:39.189 --> 00:03:40.109
&gt;&gt;ANTHONY: Is that concentrated?

00:03:40.109 --> 00:03:40.639
&gt;&gt;LAURELLE: That's right.

00:03:40.639 --> 00:03:42.549
&gt;&gt;ANTHONY: There's really stuff in there,
see?

00:03:42.549 --> 00:03:46.430
But it's not coming out, because it's super
concentrated.

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:48.239
&gt;&gt;LAURELLE: There you go.

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:50.109
&gt;&gt;ANTHONY: And the smell.

00:03:50.109 --> 00:03:53.719
&gt;&gt;LAURELLE: It smells like...

00:03:53.719 --> 00:03:55.519
&gt;&gt;ANTHONY: Citrus.

00:03:55.519 --> 00:03:59.079
&gt;&gt;LAURELLE: Sunrise in a beautiful view.

00:03:59.079 --> 00:04:03.559
Beautiful area of cacti and boulders.

00:04:03.559 --> 00:04:08.049
Well, it just smells beautiful.

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:10.079
Every time I use a Morrocco Method product,

00:04:10.079 --> 00:04:12.150
I feel so close to nature.

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:13.309
&gt;&gt;ANTHONY: Because you are.

00:04:13.309 --> 00:04:14.120
&gt;&gt;LAURELLE: Because I am.

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:16.120
&gt;&gt;ANTHONY: Because we are a 100 percent botantical

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:17.090
&gt;&gt;LAURELLE: And of course this...

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:18.570
&gt;&gt;ANTHONY: Very plant based.

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:21.730
&gt;&gt;LAURELLE: This functions as a conditioner,

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:24.920
and stimulates new healthy regrowth.

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:28.410
So you're giving yourself a treatment as well
as

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:31.700
taming down the fly aways. And if you want
to

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:34.110
set your hair, it certainly helps with

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:36.800
the rendering of the style. It enhances if
you're

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:41.480
setting with pin curls, or rollers. And I've
found

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:46.220
it enhances the waves and curls, if your hair
tends

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:48.960
to be that way naturally. It just enhances
it,

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:49.820
and gives it a sheen.

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:52.700
&gt;&gt;ANTHONY: Well that's a good...

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:54.580
That's a good obversation because, as a hairdresser,

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:58.950
if you're setting someone's hair, or setting
your own hair,

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:02.150
you can take this styling gel. You can even
water it down

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:03.920
if you want, if it's too thick.

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:07.420
But you could actually roll your hair in rollers
or pin curlers

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:10.490
or whatever you want to do. But then after
it dries,

00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:13.220
then you get the brush and you brush it out,

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:15.360
and it just volumizes and it's completely...

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:19.440
Voila, it's beautiful. It just opens up.

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:21.420
&gt;&gt;LAURELLE: Yes, so it's a good setting, styling...

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:24.400
&gt;&gt;ANTHONY: So for any of the people going
to salons

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:26.910
for styling, bring your styling gel with you,

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:28.820
don't have them use anything else.

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:34.250
And then for styling usages, it's, I guess,
it's very multi-purpose

00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:36.060
because you can do a lot of different things
to it

00:05:36.060 --> 00:05:40.780
The guys, basically I just take some, put
it in my hair, you know,

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:43.170
especially in the back, where it's puffing
up on me.

00:05:43.170 --> 00:05:46.180
So a lot of times the back puffs up. So I'll
just take

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:47.610
some and put it in the back.

00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:50.870
No, not yet, while it's still longer.

00:05:50.870 --> 00:05:54.210
And then I brush it, then it holds all day
long.

00:05:54.210 --> 00:05:56.630
But I don't really keep my hair spiky up in
the air,

00:05:56.630 --> 00:05:59.590
but if you do want a spiky up in the air effect,

00:05:59.590 --> 00:06:00.660
then this is great.

00:06:00.660 --> 00:06:03.590
&gt;&gt;LAURELLE: Absolutely, because it's a sculpting
gel.

00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:08.090
You can use it on either dry, real wet, or
damp, just damp hair.

00:06:08.090 --> 00:06:10.650
So it gives you that versatility too and you
can control

00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:15.490
the amount of neo-goth whatever the new style
is.

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:18.610
Yeah, you could let it, the first application,
dry

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:20.930
and then if you want it to be a little more
extreme

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:24.590
do it again. And you can actually get these
very extreme,

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:26.330
if that's what you wanted to do, which is
cool.

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:28.380
And it's fun every now and then to be crazy.

00:06:28.380 --> 00:06:30.190
&gt;&gt;ANTHONY: Yeah, for you younger boys and
girls,

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:34.950
if you really want outrageous styles and for
it to be healthy,

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:39.620
then Blood of the Dragon Styling Gel will
give you that effect.

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:42.550
And if you really want to be more extreme,

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:45.640
and you're saying you really want something,
like,

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:49.420
I don't know. That look, it's like frozen
helmet look, I call it.

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:53.120
Then get an egg, separate the white from the
yellow,

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:54.270
Take the white of the egg.

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:55.050
&gt;&gt;LAURELLE: Oh yeah.

00:06:55.050 --> 00:06:57.830
&gt;&gt;ANTHONY: You can beat it up and lather it.

00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:01.680
And then put it on your hair, and that will
make your hair

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:04.450
like this glass. At least it's healthy.

00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:04.910
&gt;&gt;LAURELLE: Yes.

00:07:04.910 --> 00:07:06.510
&gt;&gt;ANTHONY: At least it's healthy.

00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:08.490
&gt;&gt;LAURELLE: It's a natural ingredient thing,
so yes.

00:07:08.490 --> 00:07:10.810
&gt;&gt;ANTHONY: And then when you're done, don't
go to bed

00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:14.740
with that helmet on your head. You must shower
that off.

00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:17.200
You must wash that off. Because that's going
to like,

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:18.470
really break your hair.

00:07:18.470 --> 00:07:22.120
But if you want to go to a part or some fun
event, or

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:26.960
I don't know, if you just want to go out,
to a concert

00:07:26.960 --> 00:07:30.450
or something, looking wild, which you deserve
to do when

00:07:30.450 --> 00:07:32.370
you're young, then that's it.

00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:36.050
But when you're older and more mature, and
you want

00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:40.990
a classic, elegant look, then you certainly
just want

00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:42.730
to use the Blood of the Dragon Styling Gel.

00:07:42.730 --> 00:07:42.990
