00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:26.280
I've always maintained that the Sega Genesis
is my favorite old-school system, but that

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:31.699
doesn't necessarily mean I prefer Sonic over
Mario, Shining Force against Legend of Zelda,

00:00:31.699 --> 00:00:36.660
or anything like that. To add to that, I like
to maintain that the better and more well

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:43.300
known 16-bit RPGs have always been on the
Super NES, back when Square Enix was still

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:48.791
on board with Nintendo. I am reminded of this
fact when I pick up lesser-known RPGs for

00:00:48.791 --> 00:00:54.930
the Genesis that are not named Phantasy Star
or Shining Force, and when I am, it's not

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:01.321
pretty. If you're like me, when you remember
the game Hydlide for the NES, you get a painful

00:01:01.321 --> 00:01:06.619
knot in your stomach. It's the same feeling
I'll get when I'm reminded of Sword of Vermillion

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:11.950
for the Sega Genesis, a Sega original that
will resonate with most hardcore RPG nuts.

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:26.960
To be fair, it's hard to follow in the footsteps
of the Secret of Manas and Final Fantasies

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:31.610
of its time, but Sword of Vermillion will
most likely have you go back to playing either

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:36.170
of the two a little faster than you would
go back to trying to avenging your father

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:43.200
King Erik The Fifth of Excalabria's death
by the hands of the loathsome King Tsarkon

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.729
and altogether being the hero of the world
of Vermillion. Although this game was developed

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:54.189
by legendary arcade game designer Yu Suzuki,
creator of Hang-On, After Burner II and even

00:01:54.189 --> 00:01:59.340
the Shenmue series for the Dreamcast, certainly
Sword of Vermillion should not be counted

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:10.310
among these classic titles, and I'll tell
you why. Sword of Vermillion was marketed

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:16.930
as an arcade action RPG, when in reality it
is indeed an RPG, but with less arcade action

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:22.600
and overall exciting gameplay than it was
touted to have. You control what looks like

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:28.579
a blue-haired Meat Loaf with plate armor through
villages full of shops and townspeople who

00:02:28.579 --> 00:02:40.590
give you some suspicious advice, like this
lady. Sounds like the premise of Men In Black

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:46.790
to me. You'll wander around through the Hydlide-like
map, which is certainly not a compliment in

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:52.690
my case. It's a first person view of the world
around you, which is kind of cool, but the

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:58.590
enemy encounter rate, which is frequent and
really annoying after the first hundred times

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:05.830
you run into a gang of blobs or werewolves
with battle gear, ruins the experience. The

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:11.959
combat is painfully boring too, if not Sega's
way of saying F U to Legend of Zelda fans

00:03:11.959 --> 00:03:22.319
with a top-down view. The command screen is
charmingly old school, but in practice, is

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:28.239
anything but convenient. Instead of a command
button and an equip screen, the menu is separated

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:34.349
into every category frustratingly possible.
Sword of Vermillion famously promised to do

00:03:34.349 --> 00:03:40.950
what Nintendon't. I suppose that means it
promised to be a forgettable game, and should

00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:47.980
serve as testament to the fact that the SNES'
lineup of RPGs were in fact much better in

00:03:47.980 --> 00:04:08.360
both production value and fun factor. And
that's coming from the Genesis fan.
