WALK THROUGH A WEDDING
with Justin &amp; Mary

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:10.660
The First Dance

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:15.330
Hey, we are Justin &amp; Mary and today we're going
to talk to you about how we cover the dance.

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:22.130
When we're shooting this part of the day in particular
and really the whole day in general

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:24.260
we sort of came up with this goal for ourselves.

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:28.190
We said: what if we could get images
from the guest perspective?

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:30.469
As if a photographer wasn't even there that day.

00:00:30.969 --> 00:00:34.370
But also at the same time get images
that those guests could never get.

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:38.640
I think I sort of get these mental snapshots
of what they saw and how the day unfolded.

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:41.350
What if we could deliver a body of work,
a body of images,

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:44.350
to this couple after their day that looked like that.

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:47.200
And when you're flipping through these pictures,
you don't see 'photographer',

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:50.110
you just see two people
and the story that surrounds them.

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.730
So there are a lot of choices we can
make as photographers to achieve that.

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:57.149
One of the things we love about the way
that we're lighting these receptions,

00:00:57.149 --> 00:00:58.749
the first dance in particular,

00:00:58.749 --> 00:01:03.360
is that because we have a light source off to the side
but it's also going through a very large reflector

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:05.720
it's very hard to look at those images and say:

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.960
"Oh, that was definitely flash" or
"That was definitely natural light."

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.010
And because we have that question,

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:14.300
you can always make the argument that the light
was ambient, that it was found in the room.

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:17.000
That is always a sign of that we succeeded.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.500
If somebody looks at one of our
pictures and they see that couple,

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.970
they see that moment, they see the love between them,
and they don't see what the photographer did at all.

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:28.200
I have something that is really important,
if you're gonna be using off-camera lighting.

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.409
To think about where you're actually
placing the stands and the lights,

00:01:31.409 --> 00:01:33.049
to make sure it fits with the aesthetic of the wedding.

00:01:34.049 --> 00:01:37.220
They put a lot of time putting that wedding view
together, designing the dÃ©cor.

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:40.240
Especially the best couples,
they're really thinking about:

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.470
What's the day gonna feel like for my guests?

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:44.090
And that's, like, our favorite kind of couples,

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.060
so we don't wanna be the reason
that it doesn't work out.

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:48.180
And what I love about the Umbrella,

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:51.680
especially if you're in a situation where there
is draping or any kind of white wall is that

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.880
because all they're seeing is that outside edge,
it really can start to blend in pretty quickly.
