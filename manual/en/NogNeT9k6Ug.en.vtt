00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.760
If you come to a conclusion that telling folks the gospel is an empty offer,

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.185
you come to a conclusion that Jesus Christ never came to,

00:00:12.185 --> 00:00:16.864
Paul never came to, nor any of the followers of Christ ever came to.

00:00:16.864 --> 00:00:20.031
And the reason that men and women come to those conclusions

00:00:20.031 --> 00:00:25.348
based on the sovereignty of God is because they come up with their own carnal,

00:00:25.348 --> 00:00:29.499
conclusions about what the sovereignty of God means.

00:00:29.499 --> 00:00:35.755
Look, if you're NOT keeping your nose in the Scripture all the time,

00:00:35.755 --> 00:00:38.906
and feeling the balance of Scripture,

00:00:38.906 --> 00:00:44.597
and checking your own conclusions by Scripture all the time, you will land in error.

00:00:44.797 --> 00:00:48.966
You will either say "It's a valid offer, therefore God is not sovereign,"

00:00:48.966 --> 00:00:53.849
or you'll say, "God is sovereign, and therefore it's not a valid offer."

00:00:53.849 --> 00:00:58.085
And neither are proper conclusions. The proper conclusion is this:

00:00:58.085 --> 00:01:01.088
Are men depraved?

00:01:01.088 --> 00:01:05.440
Through and through? Naturally? Yes!

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:11.026
Is God sovereign? Yes! Is salvation of the Lord? Yes!

00:01:11.026 --> 00:01:15.515
Is it impossible for men to come unless the Father draws him? Yes!

00:01:15.515 --> 00:01:18.102
Are men bidden to come? Yes!

00:01:18.102 --> 00:01:20.286
If they come will they be saved? Yes!

00:01:20.286 --> 00:01:23.681
Are they responsible to come and be saved? Absolutely, they are!

00:01:23.681 --> 00:01:27.144
Does Scripture speak as though there is sufficiency in the atonement?

00:01:27.144 --> 00:01:31.301
That if they come they will find it sufficient to save them and wash them of all their sin?

00:01:31.301 --> 00:01:35.552
Absolutely! If men don't come is it seen to be criminal? Yes!

00:01:35.552 --> 00:01:39.267
If they don't come, their inability is they love their idols more.

00:01:39.267 --> 00:01:42.003
There's only one thing that keeps men from coming to Christ.

00:01:42.003 --> 00:01:45.028
It's because there wickedly married to their sins.

00:01:45.028 --> 00:01:48.329
That is what Scripture says, and they are so guilty,

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:52.582
God is going to throw them into hell, and punish them for their rebellion,

00:01:52.582 --> 00:01:55.776
and their crimes against Him, and their refusal to come.

00:01:55.776 --> 00:02:00.076
If men will believe, then the condemnation of God will not hang over their head,

00:02:00.076 --> 00:02:02.168
and they will most certainly be saved.

00:02:02.168 --> 00:02:05.474
And if they will not believe, it's because they will not believe.

00:02:05.474 --> 00:02:09.960
Jesus said, "You will not come unto Me that you might have life."

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:15.424
And because they won't come, they will perish in their sin, and they will be held responsible.

00:02:15.424 --> 00:02:19.764
And that is what Scripture says, and we are to take the gospel forth,

00:02:19.764 --> 00:02:22.960
and tell men to be reconciled to God.

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:27.925
based on the sufficiency of the atonement, and all things are ready.

00:02:27.925 --> 00:02:32.545
If they don't come, the master of the house is going to have every reason to be angry

00:02:32.545 --> 00:02:36.966
and His anger will burn on them right to the pit of hell.

00:02:36.966 --> 00:02:39.552
And that's what Scripture teaches.

00:02:39.552 --> 00:02:43.524
And in the end is there an elect people of God? You better believe there is!

00:02:43.524 --> 00:02:47.259
But nobody is ever excused because they're not elect.

00:02:47.259 --> 00:02:51.247
Sinners are addressed in Scripture as sinners!

00:02:51.247 --> 00:02:54.876
Who, if they will lay down their weapons of their rebellion,

00:02:54.876 --> 00:02:58.681
and they will surrender into those merciful arms of Christ,

00:02:58.681 --> 00:03:00.850
they will find salvation.

00:03:00.850 --> 00:03:06.307
And many do hear, and they repent and they believe, and they are saved.

00:03:06.307 --> 00:03:10.455
And if they don't hear, Scripture says it's because they won't hear,

00:03:10.455 --> 00:03:12.753
they won't come, they won't believe,

00:03:12.753 --> 00:03:16.485
because they love the praise of men, and they love the field,

00:03:16.485 --> 00:03:19.347
and they love the ox, and they love the wife.

00:03:19.347 --> 00:03:23.596
Therefore they are unable to come, and it condemns men for not coming,

00:03:23.596 --> 00:03:28.409
and it puts the finger right on the fact, that it is their wickedness

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:31.283
that they are personally responsible for.

00:03:31.283 --> 00:03:38.174
Men are criminal, because they will not come. Their hearts are adverse to God.

00:03:38.174 --> 00:03:42.477
They hate God. That's why they do not come.

00:03:42.477 --> 00:03:46.797
That is not an excuse that is valid before God.

00:03:46.797 --> 00:03:55.874
That is a crime that will be punished with the severest, every bit according to justice.

00:03:55.874 --> 00:04:00.139
But it is severe justice, because it is such criminal activity,

00:04:00.139 --> 00:04:04.250
that you know not the depths of, to sin against God.

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:08.541
Their heinous crimes, and that is how Scripture deals with it.

00:04:08.541 --> 00:04:13.339
And the fault is laid in the lap of men who refuse to come.

00:04:13.339 --> 00:04:19.607
We can be grateful to God, that He overcomes the hardness of our heart,

00:04:19.607 --> 00:04:23.607
and He softens it, and He gives us ears to hear.

00:04:23.607 --> 00:04:30.257
We can thank God, that He doesn't leave us all just to love our sin, and go to hell.

00:04:30.257 --> 00:04:34.978
And the thing is everybody that does go to hell, they got what they wanted.

00:04:35.178 --> 00:04:40.339
They loved their sin, and all God did was leave them to have what they love,

00:04:40.339 --> 00:04:44.969
and nobody is going to fault God, in the end.

00:04:44.969 --> 00:04:49.481
That God left them to have what they wanted.

00:04:49.481 --> 00:04:53.844
They wanted their sin, and God let them have it.

00:04:53.844 --> 00:04:59.257
We need to balance out the sovereignty of God, and the responsibility of man.

00:04:59.257 --> 00:05:04.112
In the end how you make it perfectly fit, Scripture doesn't try.

00:05:04.112 --> 00:05:07.226
And where scripture is silent, you know what?

00:05:07.226 --> 00:05:11.165
They're a lot of people who just think they have to give an answer.

00:05:11.165 --> 00:05:15.570
But the thing is there are certain things Scripture does not answer for us.

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:19.019
Where is doesn't answer, we don't need to feel compelled

00:05:19.019 --> 00:05:24.383
to have to answer. But we can see both sides of this reality.

00:05:24.383 --> 00:05:29.219
And I guarantee you, there is not emptiness.

00:05:29.219 --> 00:05:33.782
Look! Jesus Christ wept for sinners.

00:05:33.782 --> 00:05:38.470
Jesus Christ said, "I say these things that you might me saved."

00:05:38.470 --> 00:05:44.652
The Father is seen as extending His hand to a contrary people all day long.

00:05:44.652 --> 00:05:48.147
Bidden to come. Come unto Me.

00:05:48.147 --> 00:05:53.493
The invitations are many, they're a multitude in Scripture.

00:05:53.493 --> 00:05:57.337
I mean, nobody is going to go to hell,

00:05:57.337 --> 00:06:03.764
for a lack of the most affectionate pleas. You remember when I dealt with this.

00:06:03.764 --> 00:06:05.964
I mean how is God portrayed?

00:06:05.964 --> 00:06:11.207
As the prodigal is coming within sight of his home,

00:06:11.207 --> 00:06:18.096
The father is portrayed as one who RUNS to receive the sinner.

00:06:18.096 --> 00:06:24.288
That's not a contrivance of my imagination, or Charles Spurgeon's.

00:06:24.288 --> 00:06:28.908
That is how God reveals himself.
