00:00:03.639 --> 00:00:06.910
How to Make a Traditional Baked Easter Ham.

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:11.209
If your culinary knowledge of ham is limited
to sandwich lunch meat, this guide will show

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:15.840
you how to turn that large hock into a beautiful
holiday meal.

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:25.939
You will need Ham 1 c. brown sugar 2 tbsp.
mustard 1/4 c. pineapple juice 1/4 c.

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:32.119
Cognac Equipment: Roasting pan Basting brush
and serving platter.

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:33.300
Step 1.

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.860
Choose either a city ham, which is brined
and smoked and has a mild flavor and moist

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:43.670
texture; or a country ham, which is cured
and aged for a more intense flavor but drier

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:44.670
texture.

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:45.670
Step 2.

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:51.969
Follow the directions included with your city
or country ham and bake at 325 to 350 degrees

00:00:51.969 --> 00:00:54.480
Fahrenheit in a deep roasting pan.

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.399
Do not remove the outer foil unless instructed
to do so.

00:00:58.399 --> 00:01:03.250
Fully cooked hams only need to be warmed through,
but a partially cooked ham needs to reach

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:07.540
an internal temperature of 148 degrees Fahrenheit.

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:08.790
Step 3.

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:14.200
Mix up the glaze by combining the brown sugar,
mustard, pineapple juice or the Cognac in

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:15.530
a small bowl.

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:18.860
If you use Cognac, you can leave out the pineapple
juice.

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:20.280
Step 4.

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.810
Remove the ham about 30 minutes before the
end of the cooking time.

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:28.009
Remove the foil and apply about half of the
glaze, using a basting brush.

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:33.200
Score the ham in a diamond pattern with a
sharp knife, if it wasn't done already, to

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.380
allow the glaze to penetrate.

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:36.430
Step 5.

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:41.090
Reduce the oven temperature to 300 degrees
and continue baking the ham for another 30

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:45.369
minutes, or until the glaze starts to caramelize
and turn golden brown.

00:01:45.369 --> 00:01:46.729
Step 6.

00:01:46.729 --> 00:01:50.119
Remove the cooked ham and allow it to cool
for 5 minutes.

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:54.420
Baste with the remaining glaze before transferring
it to a serving platter for your hungry family.

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:00.049
Did you know Northern Europeans during the
17th and 18th centuries ate eat ham in the

00:02:00.049 --> 00:02:05.789
spring because most fresh meat wasn't available,
but cured meats like ham were more plentiful.
