00:00:06.486 --> 00:00:09.446
Let's go!Tamagotchi!

00:00:09.986 --> 00:00:10.786
Yah-tchi!

00:00:17.886 --> 00:00:20.646
It looks like another day is safely in the books

00:00:20.686 --> 00:00:23.886
Yes, indeed, you all did an excellent job!

00:00:23.916 --> 00:00:26.346
Excellent work, everyone!

00:00:26.686 --> 00:00:31.716
So earlier today Mametchi came walking by and
I happened to overhear him say to his friends..

00:00:31.746 --> 00:00:32.786
So I wondering, -

00:00:32.816 --> 00:00:37.286
do you guys have any idea what the buildings of
TamagotchiTown mightdo at night when we sleep?

00:00:37.716 --> 00:00:39.286
I've never really thought about it before but -

00:00:39.316 --> 00:00:42.416
I guess they must get pretty lonely
without anyone on the streets to watch.

00:00:42.716 --> 00:00:45.346
They're probably just fast asleep like us-tchi.

00:00:46.446 --> 00:00:48.186
Yeah, as if.

00:00:48.346 --> 00:00:51.186
Sleeping just seems so boring and would be
such a waste of our time!

00:00:51.516 --> 00:00:53.716
Shouldn't they get starting right about now?

00:00:53.746 --> 00:00:55.686
Yup, any minute now.

00:00:55.746 --> 00:00:57.416
Hey, take a look, there's one now!

00:00:57.646 --> 00:00:59.886
It's so delicious-tchi!

00:00:59.946 --> 00:01:02.886
Every night Kuchipatchi has the same dream!

00:01:02.916 --> 00:01:05.316
Oh, have a look at that one, it's so lovely!

00:01:14.016 --> 00:01:18.016
Great work, Super Hero Chama-Girl,
now finish him off with your Minus-4 Beam!

00:01:18.486 --> 00:01:20.546
Good thinking, super-scientist big brother!

00:01:20.586 --> 00:01:24.986
The Super Chama-Girl's most powerful weapon,
the Minus-4 Beam!

00:01:28.016 --> 00:01:29.616
Ah, It's just so enchanting.

00:01:29.646 --> 00:01:32.616
She has the exact same dream as last night again

00:01:32.686 --> 00:01:35.786
Huh? Oh, look! it's Ms. Perfect!

00:01:35.916 --> 00:01:39.246
Ha-ha! Ha-ha! You're all perfect!

00:01:46.416 --> 00:01:48.686
Fireball a 'rockin! Yeah, Yeah, Yeah!

00:01:48.946 --> 00:01:51.186
Fireball a 'rockin! Yeah, Yeah, Yeah!

00:01:51.286 --> 00:01:52.646
Fireball a 'rockin..

00:01:53.046 --> 00:01:55.486
Oh take a look, I think it might be a new dream!

00:01:56.146 --> 00:01:57.286
Go! 

00:02:06.286 --> 00:02:07.816
Sorry to trouble you.

00:02:07.846 --> 00:02:09.116

00:02:09.146 --> 00:02:12.116
Sweepin' and a sweepin'! 
Sweepin'and a sweepin'! Sweepin' and a sweepin'!

00:02:12.146 --> 00:02:17.686

00:02:18.146 --> 00:02:20.346

00:02:20.416 --> 00:02:22.116
...who live here in Tamagotchi Town...

00:02:22.246 --> 00:02:24.016
