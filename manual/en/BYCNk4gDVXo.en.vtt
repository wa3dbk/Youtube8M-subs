00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:07.450
Hey, we've got kitchen cabinets!

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:09.959
The kitchen's lookin' like a kitchen!

00:00:09.959 --> 00:00:16.550
They say an eco-friendly house can't be built
in 150 days for a $150,000, and I say it can.

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:17.550
I'm Allen Smith.

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.100
Join me as I push the limits with time, budget
and creativity with the Garden Home Challenge,

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:24.210
exclusively on eHow Home.

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:29.060
You know, there's just something about the
kitchen, it's really kinda the heart of the

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:30.060
home.

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.570
And, of course, an essential part of the kitchen
is the cabinetry.

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:39.219
And we've talked a little bit about the cabinets
that go up here on the wall, and we got those

00:00:39.219 --> 00:00:42.530
at Re-use Store for the Habitat for Humanity.

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:46.960
And like this Shaker: They call it a Shaker
design, because it's very simple.

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:54.329
So, in this case, on this cabinet door, what
you have is a 2 1/2 inch board that goes all

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:55.329
away around.

00:00:55.329 --> 00:00:56.659
Very, very simple and Shaker-like.

00:00:56.659 --> 00:01:04.879
So, we went to the lumber surplus place on
Saturday, and Tony and I figured out, based

00:01:04.879 --> 00:01:11.100
on the drawings here, what we needed to go
along this wall, which is the east wall of

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:12.100
the kitchen.

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:18.090
So we picked out these cabinets here and here
and the one that'll run under the sink here.

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:23.630
And then, also, if you look over here at this
wall, we've got the base of the pantry.

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:26.140
And we're gonna have some pantry cabinets
that'll come up here.

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.640
Now, Tony may build those, we're not sure
yet.

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:34.300
We got all of these cabinets for about 530
bucks.

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:41.369
And what he's gonna does is he's gonna come
along then and make the doors and the cabinet

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:47.090
drawers match these Shaker doors that you
see here.

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:50.609
And what we're gonna have to do is we're gonna
have to make– it's just a little smaller,

00:01:50.609 --> 00:01:51.609
this trim.

00:01:51.609 --> 00:01:56.560
Probably it's gonna be about an inch and 3/4s,
maybe slighter larger, closer to 2 inches.

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:00.240
And he'll go around each one of these drawers.

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:05.679
And you'll be able reach just behind them,
like that, so there may be no need for knobs.

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:10.369
Although, I found a pull that I like that
I think we may end up using.

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:16.370
Now here's a mistake: These we're wrapped
up– notice this is an external hinge here,

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:19.590
and that's one way to hinge cabinet doors.

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:26.819
But what we really wanted to go for was one
like this were the hinging is on the inside,

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:27.819
here and here.

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:34.120
And if you look closely, you'll see that matches
the cabinet hinges that we picked up the re-store.

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.319
So once we have the appliances laid out, and
we knew how much space we had, we could go

00:02:38.319 --> 00:02:44.129
along and figure out exactly what size units
that we could buy in pre-made cabinets to

00:02:44.129 --> 00:02:45.129
keep the cost down.

00:02:45.129 --> 00:02:47.879
For instance, this unit is 1 foot wide.

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:51.190
This unit is 2 feet wide.

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:56.099
This is unit is, well, 14 inches wide.

00:02:56.099 --> 00:03:00.720
And so, you just have to do the math and fill
in all the spaces that you have.

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:05.610
And you have to think about how many drawers
you need, versus how many cabinets and so

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:06.659
forth like that.

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:11.660
So, hey, if you're enjoying the progress of
the house and seeing these updates, check

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:12.660
in regularly.

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:36.560
