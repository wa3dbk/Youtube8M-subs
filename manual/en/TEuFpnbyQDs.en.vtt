00:00:00.329 --> 00:00:02.126
How big does the Universe's birthday cake

00:00:02.175 --> 00:00:04.896
have to be in order to fit all of its candles?

00:00:05.214 --> 00:00:07.611
Join the 321Science! team as we explore

00:00:07.643 --> 00:00:09.888
 the age of everything in the Universe.

00:00:09.944 --> 00:00:11.952
Scientists have estimated that the Universe

00:00:11.984 --> 00:00:14.777
 is about 13.8 billion years old.

00:00:14.921 --> 00:00:16.634
And when you look up at the night sky,

00:00:16.706 --> 00:00:18.865
you are actually looking back in time.

00:00:18.968 --> 00:00:20.952
This is because any object we see

00:00:21.024 --> 00:00:22.896
 is very far away from us,

00:00:22.976 --> 00:00:25.690
so it takes the light a long time to reach us -

00:00:25.746 --> 00:00:27.530
and that means we are actually viewing

00:00:27.586 --> 00:00:29.186
 the object in the past.

00:00:29.777 --> 00:00:32.776
Observing light from distant stars, clusters,

00:00:32.817 --> 00:00:35.427
and galaxies has helped scientists determine that

00:00:35.554 --> 00:00:37.722
the Universe must be even older than

00:00:37.794 --> 00:00:40.096
its oldest light or radiation we see.

00:00:40.406 --> 00:00:42.649
Parts of our own galaxy, the Milky Way,

00:00:42.705 --> 00:00:44.752
are just about as old as the Universe,

00:00:44.832 --> 00:00:47.720
that is 13.2 billion years.

00:00:48.042 --> 00:00:50.380
Scientists use the element Beryllium

00:00:50.499 --> 00:00:52.407
 as a "cosmic clock" to determine

00:00:52.455 --> 00:00:54.986
the age of the Milky Way's oldest stars.

00:00:55.114 --> 00:00:57.233
Younger yet is our Solar System.

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:59.603
Ages of meteorites indicate that it formed

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:02.404
 about 4.56 billion years ago.

00:01:02.684 --> 00:01:04.994
Scientists calculate that as this formation

00:01:05.042 --> 00:01:07.192
got underway, it took a few million years

00:01:07.287 --> 00:01:10.033
for the planets and other small bodies to form.

00:01:10.224 --> 00:01:12.478
And life on Earth has merely been around

00:01:12.566 --> 00:01:15.367
 for approximately 3.8 billion years.

00:01:15.846 --> 00:01:17.393
There is still much to learn about

00:01:17.497 --> 00:01:19.719
the origins and evolution of our Solar System

00:01:19.783 --> 00:01:21.131
and life on Earth

00:01:21.354 --> 00:01:23.568
but scientists are making advances by studying

00:01:23.719 --> 00:01:25.203
not just meteorites,

00:01:25.243 --> 00:01:27.472
 but also the asteroids they come from.

00:01:27.695 --> 00:01:29.314
Because asteroids formed about the

00:01:29.353 --> 00:01:31.037
same time as the Solar System,

00:01:31.157 --> 00:01:33.235
they may hold key information to

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:34.993
unlocking these mysteries.

00:01:35.196 --> 00:01:36.998
One particular asteroid of interest

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:38.669
to astronomers is Bennu.

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:40.990
Observations of Bennu indicate that it is a

00:01:41.046 --> 00:01:42.846
carbonaceous type asteroid.

00:01:43.203 --> 00:01:45.068
These are perhaps the oldest and have

00:01:45.139 --> 00:01:47.364
 changed very little since their creation.

00:01:47.674 --> 00:01:49.968
NASA's OSIRIS-REx will visit Bennu,

00:01:50.079 --> 00:01:51.849
 collect a sample of the asteroid,

00:01:52.111 --> 00:01:54.008
and bring it back to Earth to be studied.

00:01:54.294 --> 00:01:56.111
Bennu will provide a pristine sample

00:01:56.175 --> 00:01:57.674
 of an ancient asteroid â€”

00:01:57.857 --> 00:02:01.143
a window into the past 4.6 billion years.

00:02:01.413 --> 00:02:03.071
And looking into the past can help us

00:02:03.143 --> 00:02:05.436
understand not only our Solar System

00:02:05.754 --> 00:02:07.722
but also the Milky Way galaxy

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.825
 and even the Universe.

00:02:10.095 --> 00:02:12.571
This video is an OSIRIS-REx production.

00:02:12.698 --> 00:02:14.492
OSIRIS-REx is a partnership of

00:02:14.674 --> 00:02:16.230
the University of Arizona

00:02:16.484 --> 00:02:18.285
NASA Goddard Spaceflight Center

00:02:18.373 --> 00:02:19.769
and Lockheed Martin.
