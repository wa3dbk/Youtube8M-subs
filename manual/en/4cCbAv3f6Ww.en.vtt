The Timing Control, or T-Con Board is a part
of your TV's LCD Panel Assembly. It is connected

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:32.800
to the Main Board via the LVDS Cable, and
to the LCD Panel via flat ribbon cables. The

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:36.239
T-Con Board is centered on the top or bottom
edge of the back of the Panel and can be hidden

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:38.320
under a metal or plastic cover.

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:43.609
AU Optronics or AUO T-Con boards are part
number specific, and do not require matching

TV model number, serial number, or panel number
in order to confirm compatibility.

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:53.239
If the label found on the back of the panel
contains an AUO logo, the T-Con board will

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:57.850
also be manufactured by AUO and is identified
by using the following part number pattern:

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:02.109

within a string of numbers and letters on

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:12.260

can be found between the first 2 dashes on

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:19.260
