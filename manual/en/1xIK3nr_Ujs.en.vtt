00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:02.840
the first republican presidential debate

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:06.230
they had one of the member of this
actually reminds me remember when they

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:10.489
had the what's your favorite bible
passage staying

00:00:10.489 --> 00:00:15.079
and then candidates had to go around and
explain which which was their favorite

00:00:15.079 --> 00:00:19.309
their favorite bible passage and i just
thought why is why doesn't somebody just

00:00:19.309 --> 00:00:20.429
say

00:00:20.429 --> 00:00:23.699
but actually i think that my favorite
bible passage whether i have learned

00:00:23.699 --> 00:00:25.560
that is completely irrelevant

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:29.490
because we have separation of church and
state here and better for other diseases

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.430
are united well this time around in this
next debate there was a question about

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:38.410
let's go around the room and raise your
hand if you support torture that's

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:42.670
basically the question here's how it
went down

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:43.840
karen

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:47.560
then he didn't answer the specifically
congressman fault

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:51.950
raise your hand if he would support or
was on some of waterboarding

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:53.680
underpinning circumstances

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:56.980
under certain circumstances any
assistance under certain circumstances

00:00:56.980 --> 00:00:58.250
we are in

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:05.250
on your seven states is that you could
imagine not all and should

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:11.370
alright and people start against jeering
the people that did raise their hands

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:13.640
and it was herman cain

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:17.340
pizza guide herman cain ten volunteers
rick santorum

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:21.390
frankly the entire debate with some of
the most boring talking point recitals

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.659
that we've seen in awhile and the debate
itself but lewis was sponsored by

00:01:25.659 --> 00:01:29.760
several extremist groups including the
both keepers malicious group

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:34.370
and also the anticommunist radical john
birch society

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:38.150
what on earth is going i think this is
what we're in for lewis for these two

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:39.110
dates

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:43.210
then we have a lot to look forward to
because it is a complete

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:46.350
pd it's a cluster f i mean i don't even
know what else to say it's just it's a

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.470
joke raise your hand if you support
torture you have a mostly you notice

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:52.300
most of the debates

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:53.900
are like this until

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:56.840
we have until after the primaries

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:59.260
industrial apparatus people realize that
well

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:03.050
i say in many other say democrats and
republicans are similar on many many

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:06.080
issues are their positions are very
close

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:10.240
involvement with groups like the both
keepers militia group is only acceptable

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:14.229
on the right i mean tempo lindsey one of
the candidates goes on

00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:18.839
the american family association radio
program hosted by anti gay brian fisher

00:02:18.839 --> 00:02:20.300
who's been on this show

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:24.180
so there's no such thing as a monogamous
gay relationship the rectal wall is

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.719
oneself thirty remember that that louis
farrakhan africa

00:02:27.719 --> 00:02:29.080
so it's ok

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.319
to be associated with a lot of these
groups if you're on the right the oath

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:37.430
keepers website is riddled with this
paranoid rhetoric about government

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:42.050
officials deciding the american people
confiscating the property of the

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:45.700
american people including food the
government's confiscating food from the

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:47.209
american people

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:49.279
block hating american cities

00:02:49.279 --> 00:02:51.599
turning them into giant concentration
camps

00:02:51.599 --> 00:02:52.819
and by the way

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:56.889
in early two thousand eight the old
keepers founder ok deal keepers was one

00:02:56.889 --> 00:02:59.530
of the sponsors of the republican debate

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:03.559
warned that a quote dominatrix in chief
named

00:03:03.559 --> 00:03:05.849
hitler re

00:03:05.849 --> 00:03:12.680
hitler re clinton would impose a police
state on america and shoot all resistors

00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:14.879
one of the group's sponsoring

00:03:14.879 --> 00:03:16.969
of republican debate

00:03:16.969 --> 00:03:21.669
referred to one of the democratic
candidates as hitler re clinton

00:03:21.669 --> 00:03:23.099
and glenn beck also loves

00:03:23.099 --> 00:03:26.370
the oath keepers so that that you give
us a sense of where we are louis gives

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:29.879
us a sense of uh... how seriously this
taken

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:30.809
exactly

00:03:30.809 --> 00:03:31.059
absolutely
