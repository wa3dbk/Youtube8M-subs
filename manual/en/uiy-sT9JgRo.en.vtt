00:00:00.736 --> 00:00:05.311
Good afternoon.
My name is Edward Cole.

00:00:08.209 --> 00:00:13.320
l don't know what most people say
at these occasions. because...

00:00:13.748 --> 00:00:16.253
...in all honesty. l....

00:00:17.552 --> 00:00:20.524
l've tried to avoid them.

00:00:24.525 --> 00:00:26.997
The simplest thing is...

00:00:27.161 --> 00:00:31.269
...l loved him and l miss him.

00:00:36.537 --> 00:00:39.676
Carter and l saw the world together.

00:00:41.408 --> 00:00:43.545
Which is amazing...

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:46.414
...when you think that only
three months ago...

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:49.418
...we were complete strangers.

00:00:54.554 --> 00:00:56.391
l hope...

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:01.296
...that it doesn't sound
selfish of me...

00:01:01.494 --> 00:01:05.735
...but the last months of his life...

00:01:05.898 --> 00:01:09.204
...were the best months of mine.

00:01:11.703 --> 00:01:13.406
He saved my life.

00:01:14.439 --> 00:01:17.545
And he knew it before l did.

00:01:20.412 --> 00:01:24.753
EDWARD:
l'm deeply proud that thís man...

00:01:24.916 --> 00:01:29.324
...found ít worth hís whíle
to hnow me.

00:01:31.055 --> 00:01:32.992
ln the end...

00:01:33.157 --> 00:01:38.901
...l thính ít's safe to say that we brought
some joy to one another's líves.

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:42.268
So, one day, when...

00:01:42.966 --> 00:01:46.405
...l go to some fínal restíng place...

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:51.778
...íf l happen to wake up
next to a certaín wall wíth a gate...

00:01:51.942 --> 00:01:55.148
...l hope that Carter's there...

00:01:55.311 --> 00:01:57.549
...to vouch for me...

00:01:57.747 --> 00:02:00.752
...and show me the ropes
on the other síde.
