00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:23.270
What if the galaxy really were made of paper?

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:25.590
I’m not even sure how that would work.

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.990
Oh, actually, it kind of is, if you think
about space-time.

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:33.020
That’s just a flat sheet...only you can’t
draw pictures on it.

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:37.079
That’s literally the only scientific problem
with that comparison.

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:40.719
And such are the questions posed by Paper
Galaxy for the iPhone.

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:55.479
This is pretty deep stuff.

00:00:55.479 --> 00:01:01.039
Just released to the App Store, Paper Galaxy
might look kind of familiar to avid iOS gamers.

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:05.830
We reviewed a game called Rocket Bunnies last
year that was similar to this, only...not

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:06.830
as much fun.

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:09.479
Seriously, I could play Paper Galaxy all day.

00:01:09.479 --> 00:01:11.119
Because I already am.

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:16.170
That’s, like...see, again, we’re jumping
all over science with this thing.

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:20.770
So the crazy thing about about Paper Galaxy
is that...there’s actually a story.

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:27.020
I guess the moon catches a cold, and...I think
it sneezes on the Crab Nebula or something?

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:31.429
And so now, it’s acting all bitchy and trying
to swallow the moon whole, at which point

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:36.079
the sheer force of the gravity would, like,
literally pull it—look, I don’t know.

00:01:36.079 --> 00:01:39.030
You get to collect stars, alright?

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:42.510
And jump over planets by sneezing.

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:48.020
So basically, you have a few objectives here.

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:53.650
Keep the moon out of the pursuing Crab Nebula,
collect as many stars as you can, follow the

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:54.659
cosmic butterfly.

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:59.539
Your moon orbits whatever planet it reaches
automatically, and you move by tapping whatever

00:01:59.539 --> 00:02:01.570
direction you’d like it to sneeze in.

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:04.689
That sends it flying...hopefully, toward a
planet.

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:07.109
There’s a fine line between moon and meteorite.

00:02:07.109 --> 00:02:10.009
You don’t want Bruce Willis to show up.

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:11.940
So the gameplay couldn’t be simpler.

00:02:11.940 --> 00:02:15.580
It’s all about good aim, building speed,
going as far as you can.

00:02:15.580 --> 00:02:20.569
But it’s addictive because the game also
gives you 100 sub-objectives, like achievements

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:21.599
to strive for.

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:26.120
Those earn you even more stars, which you
spend on upgrades...of which there are more

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:27.980
than a hundred and freaking twenty.

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:33.040
Throw in leaderboards, different game modes
and little social planets that show your friend’s

00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:35.930
best times...I mean, this game is awesome.

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.159
Even if its science is somewhat suspect.

00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:50.430
It’s Paper Galaxy for the iPhone.
