00:00:22.969 --> 00:00:27.579
Sometimes you just have to admire the level
of dedication given to certain aspects of

00:00:27.579 --> 00:00:28.579
a game.

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:31.789
Often it's the attention to detail in the
programming, wowing the player with intriguing

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:36.300
answers to the question of “hmm, I wonder
if I can do this”.

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.239
In Bucketz however, the dedication is in the
level of commitment to the personalities of

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:42.190
the characters in game.

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:46.860
Not only are they are an amusing lot of sentient
buckets with distinct characteristics, but

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.039
every single level contains its own set of
funny conversations between them with fairly

00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:53.140
decent voice acting.

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:56.969
That plus the general level of humor throughout
the game does a lot to draw players into this

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:02.209
game of balancing acts, and yes, the game
itself while not an original concept is quite

00:01:02.209 --> 00:01:03.679
engaging.

00:01:03.679 --> 00:01:08.270
The buckets are all different sizes and find
themselves precariously placed on a ledge

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.080
as objects of varying widths and weights rain
down.

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:15.959
It's up to your finger to keep the buckets
from becoming too heavy and toppling the ledge,

00:01:15.959 --> 00:01:17.659
thus ending the level.

00:01:17.659 --> 00:01:21.329
Large objects will crush smaller buckets,
and sometimes the combination of buckets makes

00:01:21.329 --> 00:01:24.310
for some interesting balancing acts indeed.

00:01:24.310 --> 00:01:28.300
Each level introduces something new that will
help or hinder your progress (and upgrades

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:30.580
can be bought in the shop to help you out).

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:35.050
Don't worry about the prices as every stage
ends with a bonus round, where coins fly with

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:39.390
wild abandon across the landscape, waiting
to be scooped up by your tapping fingers,

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.730
and like the Ode to Joy in Peggle, this is
always a welcome and satisfying end to each

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:45.730
stage.

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:48.811
The presentation was mentioned before, and
it really is one of the highlights of the

00:01:48.811 --> 00:01:49.811
game.

00:01:49.811 --> 00:01:54.250
The characters themselves are a rather simple
cartoon style, but everything is crisp, full

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:58.530
of color, and most importantly the characters
are very expressive.

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:03.060
The buckets themselves are archetypes (the
grizzled war veteran, the hillbilly, the know-it-all

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:07.640
brat), and their voices and personalities
match these archetypes, but it's the combination

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:12.090
of characters plus the punchy writing that
really brings the whole thing to life, with

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.900
plenty of fourth wall jokes and meta humor,
if you like that sort of thing.

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:20.420
Bucketz shows that a decent enough game can
be elevated to something more engaging through

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:24.510
a great aesthetic if the proper creativity
and effort is put in.

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:29.150
Oh sure some of the voices are going to grate
with some people, humor is very subjective,

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:33.290
and we've all seen this type of game before,
but this is a complete package that should

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:42.640
definitely amuse all who make the purchase.
