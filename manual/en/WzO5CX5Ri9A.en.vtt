00:00:01.023 --> 00:00:04.087
This is our first composting toilet at Longleaf Breeze.

00:00:04.087 --> 00:00:07.054
I fully expect that we will replace it with

00:00:07.054 --> 00:00:12.054
models that are prettier, more refined,

00:00:12.054 --> 00:00:16.071
whose joints fit better.

00:00:16.071 --> 00:00:21.062
But for now this gets us into the game

00:00:21.062 --> 00:00:27.026
of composting toilets and seems like a good start.

00:00:27.026 --> 00:00:29.073
Let's look at it piece by piece.

00:00:29.073 --> 00:00:33.025
What you see on top of course is an ordinary toilet seat.

00:00:33.025 --> 00:00:39.017
The elongated seat which many modern Americans favor

00:00:39.017 --> 00:00:43.034
doesn't work well on a composting toilet because you want

00:00:43.034 --> 00:00:47.054
well, doesn't work well in our model

00:00:47.054 --> 00:00:50.065
Okay, I'm going to lift up the lid.

00:00:50.091 --> 00:00:54.098
And the inner working of the composting toilet

00:00:54.098 --> 00:00:57.045
is a five-gallon plastic bucket.

00:00:57.045 --> 00:01:00.069
We bought these at Home Depot; they're the Homer Buckets

00:01:00.069 --> 00:01:04.013
And I think when you buy one with a lid it's maybe

00:01:04.013 --> 00:01:06.090
four, four and a half dollars, something like that.

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.020
And I bought four of them so that we can

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.084
take a bucket out, put a lid on it,

00:01:12.084 --> 00:01:17.027
and not feel like we've gotta run to the compost pile right away.

00:01:17.027 --> 00:01:23.068
But as you can see, if you were to have a more elongated seat,

00:01:23.068 --> 00:01:28.025
you might leave a portion of the bucket exposed,

00:01:28.025 --> 00:01:30.099
which doesn't work well, so

00:01:30.099 --> 00:01:33.001
that's one of the compromises you make when you go with

00:01:33.001 --> 00:01:38.046
a composting toilet: no elongated seat. Sorry.

00:01:38.046 --> 00:01:41.023
So when we get ready to empty it,

00:01:41.023 --> 00:01:44.037
all we do is lift this lid up,

00:01:44.037 --> 00:01:46.090
and pick up the bucket.

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:50.001
(Probably will want to pick it up by the handle then.)

00:01:50.001 --> 00:01:53.071
Right now it's got a little wood ash at the bottom, that's all,

00:01:53.071 --> 00:01:57.048
and put a lid on it and set it aside.

00:01:57.048 --> 00:01:59.051
And then when we get three or four buckets full,

00:01:59.051 --> 00:02:03.025
we will take them to a composting pile, which I hope to have

00:02:03.025 --> 00:02:05.069
in operation by the time we need it.

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:07.080
Now beside the composting toilet

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:12.019
is our ash can.

00:02:12.019 --> 00:02:14.076
What I do is from the wood stove,

00:02:14.076 --> 00:02:17.080
I place the ashes in this can,

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:22.071
and I fashioned a little scoop out of a plastic jug.

00:02:22.071 --> 00:02:24.028
So you can just reach over,

00:02:24.028 --> 00:02:25.054
grab yourself

00:02:25.054 --> 00:02:32.050
a scoopful of ash and put it down in the bucket.

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:35.062
And I've got to come up with toilet paper, but other than that,

00:02:35.062 --> 00:02:37.062
we're in business.
