Laureen: Someone asked, to use our website
do you have to be in your course?

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:32.210
No, not our main website here, like going
to the community, going to our discussion

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:34.280
forum, that's all free.

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:45.340
Now, we have a membership area which is members.codingcerificationl.org,
those are our paid products, our replay webinar,

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:50.340
our practice exam that we charge for.

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:56.629
That inside area there's cost to get in, but
all of the other pages: discussion boards,

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:00.039
the blog, articles, the YouTube channel, all
of that's free.

00:01:00.039 --> 00:01:07.110
And quite honestly, if you really were honest,
you shoestring budget, you could go to our

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:13.990
YouTube channel and probably watch every single
video and be educated enough to pass the exam,

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:15.900
we give a ton away for free.

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:20.299
But, it's all packaged up nicely and more
organized and you can be efficient in your

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:23.640
studies when you purchase like the Blitz video.

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:29.810
You're not going to get a full course on YouTube
but as far as like kind of the tips for passing

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:34.180
the exam, all the good stuff out there, now
the Replay Club members get it immediately

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:35.250
hot off the press.

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:40.090
They get it with a nice little ribbon tied
on it with all transcribed in real pretty

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:41.090
PDF.

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:49.680
They could subscribe to it on there on iTunes
and it just shows up, and you can listen to

00:01:49.680 --> 00:02:08.160
Alicia and I, and Boyd ad nauseum [laughs].
