An announcement is now indicating that we have clear priorities, we've enriched the plan 
 with detail and we're underpinning the masterplan with a commitment to deliver. 

00:00:15.581 --> 00:00:25.581
The Big City Plan of 2007 was a formidable 
 idea. Today's masterplan is a formidable plan.

00:00:25.149 --> 00:00:28.149
[applause]

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:40.360
The Big City Plan, the masterplan to create a world class city centre 
 in Birmingham, is the most ambitious project ever undertaken in the UK.

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:55.520
Five areas of transformational change are pivotal to the Plan:

00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:11.240
The £600 million investment transforming New Street station will support wider regeneration.

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:25.280
The multi million pound Library of Birmingham kickstarts development, 
 with Paradise Circus, Arena Central to follow.

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:44.080
A number of office developments will extend the Snow Hill 
 District, creating a new destination place for business.

00:01:59.233 --> 00:02:09.230
The Multi-Storey Car Park, Academy and Eastside City Park will continue to provide 
 momentum, with High Speed 2 being a catalyst for wider transformation.

00:02:12.724 --> 00:02:18.720
At the heart of the Southern Gateway the Wholesale 
 Markets redevelopment will deliver a new public space.

00:02:19.622 --> 00:02:24.620
‘Moat Square’ will create an exciting cultural, retail and leisure destination for Birmingham.

00:02:25.704 --> 00:02:34.700
These five areas will be at the forefront of the 
 city’s transformation, delivering new high-quality buildings and public spaces.

00:02:34.622 --> 00:02:44.620
Over the next 20 years Birmingham will boast many distinctive public squares 
 and civic spaces, delivering a world-class experience for residents and visitors.

00:02:47.786 --> 00:02:56.790
With Birmingham’s wonderfully preserved canal network and the River Rea restored to their 
 rightful prominence, an extra dimension will be added to the city. 

00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:07.680
Pedestrians will be the heart of Birmingham's future development. By making the city core accessible to all, people 
 will be naturally drawn to explore the city, discovering just how much Birmingham has to offer.

00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:22.080
In an increasingly competitive globalised world, the city centre 
 will be vital to Birmingham's future economic success.

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:33.680
The ambitious aims of the Big City Plan cannot be achieved by any one organisation. More 
 than ever it is a partnership between the city’s stakeholders, requiring cooperation and working together.

00:03:37.734 --> 00:03:42.730
Birmingham’s Big City Plan, creating a world-class city.

00:03:44.978 --> 00:03:47.980
Global City, Local Heart
