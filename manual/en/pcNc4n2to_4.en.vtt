Hi, I'm Terri, and in this segment, we're
going to be doing, how to feather hair. Remember

00:00:06.029 --> 00:00:11.170
the 70's, the whole Farrah Fawcett style,
and then into the early 80's? That was a really

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:16.800
big look. Now, it does help if you have some
layers in your hair, some shorter pieces.

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.999
If you have almost all one length hair, the
way my hair is, it's a little harder to feather,

00:00:20.999 --> 00:00:27.210
but you can even still do it, and my advice
is, using a big rod curling iron, such as

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:32.690
this one. Now, I'm going to take a couple
of pieces, and you want to take larger pieces.

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:43.410
You don't want to take small pieces, and the
trick is making sure you roll it back, towards

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:49.390
the back of your head, never forward. That's
how you get the feather. You can use a bit

00:00:49.390 --> 00:01:03.010
of spray, if you want to hold it,
and again, taking the next piece. I'm going

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:11.609
to just do three or four pieces, and show
you the front. Let's use a little tiny bit

00:01:11.609 --> 00:01:25.210
of spray, just to hold the curl, and let's
do one more piece, and again, make sure you're

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:36.859
rolling your hair back. Hold it there for
a good five to ten seconds, so once we have

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:41.780
these pieces, we're just going to take, you
can take a brush or you can just use your

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:48.090
fingers, if you want. The brush just gives
it that nice volume. It's going to separate

00:01:48.090 --> 00:02:00.350
the curl into a more layery wave, and we continue
to do that with the whole side of her head,

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:03.840
and then just to set it, you're going to use
a bit of hair spray, to keep that feathered

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.829
look, and that's how you feather hair.
