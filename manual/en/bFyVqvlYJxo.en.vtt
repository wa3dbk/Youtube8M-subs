00:00:03.629 --> 00:00:08.680
Without any problems, we roll into Lorella
Springs Station.

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:14.250
This is an amazing one-million-acre property
with plenty to see and do.

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.730
And if you're looking for a bargain, there's
a few around.

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:23.869
We meet up with old mate Rhett Walker, who's
just come through what anyone would call "a

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:25.390
pretty rough patch."

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:28.119
Well Rhett, it's been a long time since I've
been out here.

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:29.659
Yeah it has, I'm glad you're back.

00:00:29.659 --> 00:00:30.659
Thanks mate.

00:00:30.659 --> 00:00:34.559
But you were tellin' me that you had this
horrific injury.

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:37.200
Yeah, lucky to be alive.

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:40.140
You pretty much thought you were gonna die.

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:41.240
I was certain of it.

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:42.780
Yeah, my head burst apart.

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.870
A snatch strap and chain broke towing a big
tyre, building roads as you've done last time

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:48.870
you were here.

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:49.870
Yeah, I've towed the same thing.

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:54.340
Yeah it sort of came up and wrapped around
my head, took out that side of my face, and

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:56.940
I was pretty sure I was dying out there.

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:03.080
And the kids and my dad, they managed to get
me back into here, it was a long trip back

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:04.080
in.

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.930
I think it was 14 hours between the accident
to Darwin and like...

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:12.999
Fourteen hours, I yeah...
...many liters of blood were lost on the way

00:01:12.999 --> 00:01:13.999
and yeah...

00:01:13.999 --> 00:01:18.450
Yeah cause you were saying it was like ten
hours before they could get a helicopter to

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:19.719
you...

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:22.950
Because of where we are and the problems with
like, the chopper had to fuel up, and then

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:26.899
the plane couldn't land on the strip, and
all sorts of dramas but, yeah um.

00:01:26.899 --> 00:01:30.579
So it really sort of set in a bit about how
isolated..

00:01:30.579 --> 00:01:32.820
How remote we are, yes.

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:38.869
The people that flew in to help us said we
were the most remote, it was the most major

00:01:38.869 --> 00:01:40.579
extraction they ever had to do.

00:01:40.579 --> 00:01:41.619
No kiddin'?

00:01:41.619 --> 00:01:44.899
And this is all of the Northern end of Australia?

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:48.439
To my knowledge yes.

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:54.729
Road travel would have killed Rhett, so Careflight
sent two aircraft for the extraction: a helicopter

00:01:54.729 --> 00:02:02.890
that had to refuel twice just to get here,
and a plane that had to land at another airstrip.

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:09.980
The chopper took Rhett to the plane, and the
plane took him to Darwin.

00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:16.660
14 hours after his accident, doctors had Rhett
stabilized, though they commented that the

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:21.100
only worse skull fracture they'd seen was
on a corpse.

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:28.000
18 months later, Rhett was back at work, though
from time to time he still sneezes out chunks

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.450
of windscreen glass.

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:35.560
That really cements the fact that this is
a remote place, isn't it?

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.860
After all the years, we've never known what
would happen in a situation like that.

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:41.450
Never really had a major situation like that.

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:44.600
And yes, it is remote.

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:51.110
Mate, I'm glad you're ok because I'd hate
to loose ya.

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:54.100
I need you to come back.

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:57.090
Alright mate, well let's get goin' hey.

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.640
There's a saying up here: "Territory Tough."

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:06.590
And if you want to know what that looks like...
well, our mate Rhett is a living example.
