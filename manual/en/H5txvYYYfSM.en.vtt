Red Bull Winning 5 is a street football tournament. For this event, Red Bull prepared an art project with the support of FOV Prodüksiyon and Milk Gallery. 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:31.500
We worked with five artists from Turkey. Ham Hams, Wicx, Murys, Ömeria, and Çağdaş Çıtır. Music and sound design were carried out by FFW.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
We painted the important moments of Turkish football history on a 5m x 3m wall.  

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.500
We started with the first teams established in Turkey. We used symbols of the teams.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:53.000
We painted the five champions, Beşiktaş, Galatasaray, Fenerbahçe, Trabzonspor and Bursaspor. 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:13.000
After this part, we reflected the formation of uniforms, formation of the national team, and the first official national match of Turkey against Romania. 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:26.000
We used the historic moment when Can Bartu and Metin Oktay broke ground in terms of fairplay by exchanging their uniforms.

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:43.000
Supporters of Beşiktaş are very famous, we reflected the enthusiastic and creative side of them. 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:50.000
We applied a march from the Metin-Ali-Feyyaz era in the 80's on the wall. We also emphasized the nice location of the stadium.

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:59.000
Naturally, Tanju Çolak's scoring 39 goals in one season and winning the Golden Shoe was also represented on the wall.

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:08.000
We painted the greatest victory of Turkey in international tournaments, the match against Senegal, which we won with the goal Ilhan Mansiz scored in the extra time. 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000
In the final part of the clip, we return to today and set down the ball on the street. Everything shaped up naturally. 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:25.700
Everyone laid claim to one part of it. Some days, we drew for twenty hours straight. Kudos to artists once more.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:32.000
When we encountered problems, they were solved in no time at all. This was a good consequence of this collective, this team play. 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:35.000
This project was a very good experience for everyone involved.

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:42.000
A project of this kind was realized for the first time in Turkey. Both graffiti and football have always played an important role in my own life. 

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:48.500
As someone nourished by street culture, it gave me immense pleasure to direct such a project.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.100
We brought together football, street, art and music and we really had a great time. 

00:02:53.200 --> 00:03:00.100
I hope you will also have fun watching. We extend our thanks to everyone who supported and got involved in the project. Peace out.
