Can You Wear A Pocket Square With A Shirt
Or Vest - Rules On Wearing Pocket Squares

00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:02.620
Hi!

00:00:02.620 --> 00:00:04.009
I'm Antonio Centeno, the founder of Real Mean
Real Style.

00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:08.700
Today, I'm going to be talking about pocket
squares and with which garments can you wear

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:09.700
them.

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:11.720

And if you want more, you know I've got a
free 47-page e-book, but did you know I've

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:26.860
got also a premium e-book, 600 pages, 400
images, 14 hours of audio.

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:29.750
I highly suggest you check it out.

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:34.370
Okay guys, this is the question that came
in, "Antonio, I'm wondering, can you wear

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:37.359
a pocket square with a dress shirt?"

00:00:37.359 --> 00:00:39.690
I've received another one, "Hello, Antonio!

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:43.100
I've received a Kenneth Cole vest.

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.190
Can I wear a pocket square with it?

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:48.379
Is it meant to be opened like they are on
suits?"

00:00:48.379 --> 00:00:54.690
I didnâ€™t write it in here, but I've also
had men asking about overcoats as well, so

00:00:54.690 --> 00:01:02.730
I'm going to talk about each of the four garments,
jackets, shirts, vests, and overcoats, and

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.290
when would you want to wear a pocket square.

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:05.840
Let's start with the shirts.

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:08.140
That's probably the closest to the body.

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:10.290
Pretty much I say never.

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:11.290
I don't like the look.

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:16.260
I've seen some guys try to pull it off, but
really a shirt breast pocket, I don't even

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.170
like making shirts with breast pockets.

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:22.210
I usually recommend men, if they're getting
a custom shirt, not to have it.

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:25.970
And even if you buy something off the rack,
a lot of times, you can remove the pocket

00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:30.860
as well, although it's funny, but this shirt
right there, I actually have a pocket.

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:33.960
This was made by a tailor friend of mine.

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.340
Well, he took the liberty of putting something.

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:38.540
There are many reasons to have a pocket.

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:39.730
I've got a good friend.

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:40.740
He's in sales.

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.850
He's always moving and he keeps pens in it.

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:49.140
In fact, the shirts I make for him have special
pockets on the inside for holding his pens.

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:52.980
He doesnâ€™t really use ones that leak ink,
so I don't think he's ever actually lost a

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:55.300
shirt, to those of you that object to that.

00:01:55.300 --> 00:02:00.520
But if you use it, go for it, but don't stuff
it with a pocket square.

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:05.300
Okay, let's go to vests, sometimes.

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:10.219
I think actually if you're wearing the vest
under a jacket, no, but if you're wearing

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:13.810
the vest by itself, which I've seen a lot
of men do this, especially I've got a good

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:15.260
friend and he's a photographer.

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.660
And for him, he's at weddings all the time,
so he wants to have his arms free because

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:24.969
he's moving and he uses the pockets to actually
hold pieces of gear, but he wants to look

00:02:24.969 --> 00:02:25.969
good.

00:02:25.969 --> 00:02:31.030
So I think he wears a bow tie, but he does
stuff a pocket square, and it looks good.

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:36.299
It shows that he went the extra mile, but
at the same time, he's at work, so he follows

00:02:36.299 --> 00:02:40.930
the function path, which I always believe
function first, style second.

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:42.900
So in that case, it looks great.

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:46.580
If you're just going out on a town, perhaps,
why not, but don't overdo it.

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:49.280
Don't have that thing just falling out there.

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:53.420
With the jacket, I think a jacket should always
have a pocket square.

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:57.900
I know it takes a while for guys to get used
to it, but I have a gentleman client over

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:02.870
in Dubai named Sandiv and he talked about
how he just left the other day, forgot his

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:07.930
pocket square, and how he actually stopped
at a store to buy one because he felt incomplete

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:08.930
without it.

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:13.980
When you can get to that feeling, it's a great
place because people notice these pocket squares.

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:14.980
Start off small.

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:20.019
Start off with white, with just that little
square fold that you barely see there.

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:23.170
We look at pictures of Harry Truman.

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:27.620
He was a haberdasher before he became president
of the United States.

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:29.500
The guy knew how to dress and he looked good.

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:34.239
He always had that little square fold there.

00:03:34.239 --> 00:03:37.540
Let's talk about overcoats, trench coats,
any type of jacket.

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:41.109
Well, here is where function -- really, that's
there to protect you.

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:43.549
Most likely, it's cold outside.

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:49.029
You're maybe in inclement weather, so I would
say in the vast majority of cases, no need

00:03:49.029 --> 00:03:50.140
for a pocket square there.

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:53.599
Most likely you're wearing a jacket underneath
and that's where you would have the pocket

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:54.599
square.

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:56.439
You may say, "Well, why does it have a breast
pocket?"

00:03:56.439 --> 00:04:01.249
Well, that's where you could possibly put
your gloves or to put sunglasses or something

00:04:01.249 --> 00:04:04.900
in that pocket, but it's not really so much
for adornment.

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:06.390
That one is more for function.

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:09.629
Okay, so I talked about the four points.

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:16.470
Basically, overcoats, rarely; jackets, always;
vests, sometimes especially if you're wearing

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:18.959
it by itself; dress shirts, never.

00:04:18.959 --> 00:04:20.180
All right.

00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:21.769
I will see you guys in the next video.

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:25.610
And if you have a question, you know where
to go, mensstyleqa.com.

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:27.900
I'm answering a lot more questions there.

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:31.960
YouTube comments, I love seeing you guys down
below in the comments, but it's more of I

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:36.030
just have fun and I try to interact with people,
but if you've got a serious question, go to

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:38.460
Men's Style Q&amp;A and we'll try to answer the
question.

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:41.590
And if it's a great question, we'll make a
video out of it.

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:42.590
Take care.

00:04:42.590 --> 00:04:43.590
See you guys in the next video.

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:43.591
Bye-bye.
