00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:03.550
We first saw the Chicken Caravan on YouTube

00:00:03.550 --> 00:00:06.720
I googled "free range eggs" and I found this... thing!

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:08.450
It said  "Chicken Caravan",

00:00:08.450 --> 00:00:11.160
I honestly thought: "Gee, I'll have a look at this",

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.190
because I thought it was a joke or something, I honestly did!

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:17.400
And when I saw it,

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:18.930
I just couldn't believe my eyes.

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:19.900
I said "You are kidding me,

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:21.630
how did these people came out with that?"

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:24.570
We're situated northeast of Perth,

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.810
about 300 kilometers

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:29.510
in what's regarded as the Mid West

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:32.610
from Geraldton we're probably about

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.950
280 kilometers east of Geraldton,

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:38.050
which is a regional port and city.

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:41.390
A bit about the project,

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:45.790
we are an iron ore miner,

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:47.590
mainly looking at magnetite

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:49.160
and mining for the magnetite.

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:52.800
What we've been doing and the information

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:53.730
and the background that I've

00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:55.300
been getting on chicken sheds

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:56.570
and whatever else and

00:00:56.570 --> 00:00:57.740
looking into free range eggs,

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:02.710
it was just something that was out of our depth,

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:04.380
and probably out of our understanding.

00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:08.010
But after seeing the Chicken Caravan on YouTube

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.380
and then speaking to Daniel a number

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:12.320
of times over the phone, I just thought

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:14.450
"this thing, it can't fail, surely,

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:16.660
even with blokes like me running it!

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:17.660
Its gotta work!"

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:20.030
So we ended up purchasing the Chicken Caravan

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:22.430
and ended up freighting it over to WA.

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:26.830
And much to all of my neighbors' around here

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:28.100
and others within our company,

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:31.100
much to their enjoyment

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:32.200
they thought it was a great joke

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:34.440
that we were gonna be doing this,

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:38.780
a mining company, and yeah... "What's going on here?"

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.080
But now that they have all seen the Chicken Caravan,

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:42.210
and how it works, being our

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.650
contract partners and whatever else.

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.290
We're just amazed at how it does it,

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:49.190
the ease and the thought that's gone into it,

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:50.060
which it has.

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:56.060
The ease to manage it and operate the machine

00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:57.600
The birds are just so happy

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.300
having this free range grazing which is proper,

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:03.440
a proper free range grazing for them,

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:04.700
they're happy out there.

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:08.340
The ease of how you just collect the eggs,

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.010
they're laying in those nesting boxes

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:14.180
it's just it's so simple for a one man, one person operation.

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:16.050
We are going to be here for thirty years,

00:02:16.050 --> 00:02:17.620
so we want to see that we can partner

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.050
and be a part of these communities.

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:20.690
We're gonna be here for a long time,

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:22.620
so we want to make sure that we, you know,

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:23.490
we try to do the right thing

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:25.060
and we set off on with the right foot.

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:30.100
And we've partnered with a Indigenous group,

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:34.330
there's a bit of labour there.

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:38.940
And through that, we are also doing veggies,

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:41.070
but through the Chicken Caravan,

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:42.410
we see it as an opportunity

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:44.680
where we've got a mine

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:47.680
40 kilometers to the east of us here,

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:50.050
that we need a 1100 - 1200 eggs a day,

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:53.650
to supply our workforce out there,

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:55.150
so we are trying to look to some

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.120
ways that, you know, generating

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.790
employment and some training

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:03.760
for local use and local people,

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:04.830
but we are happy with it

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:06.060
and very pleased with it,

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:09.100
and I've said to the people now that have seen it,

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:10.370
the neighbors that were skeptics,

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:12.700
they are now scratching their heads.
