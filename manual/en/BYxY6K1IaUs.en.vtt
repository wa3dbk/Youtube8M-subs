&gt;&gt; Hilah:Hey dudes!

00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:02.280
I am Hilah and welcome to Hilah Cooking.

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:05.710
So, I’ve gotten quite a few messages from
people sayin “Hey!

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:08.430
What in the kale to I do with kale!”

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:13.889
So today I am going to show you a quick little
garlic and sesame kale sautee, and it’s

00:00:13.889 --> 00:00:18.520
a great way to make quick use of this very
healthy green.

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:19.700
Yayyyy!

[How to Cook Kale]

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:35.289
&gt;&gt; Hilah: First thing you are gonna need to
do is wash your kale because it grows in dirt,

00:00:35.289 --> 00:00:36.289
so I’ve don’t that.

00:00:36.289 --> 00:00:40.390
So, I am just gonna start by stripping the
leaves off of the stems.

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:43.809
You can totally cook the stems too, but some
people don’t like it so I am going to show

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:47.600
you how to strip it off quick and easy.

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.559
Just get that kale naked, and if you never
had kale it’s kind of similar to collard

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:53.559
greens.

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:57.940
It’s a little bit milder in texture and
flavor; not quite as bitter as collard greens

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:03.559
can be sometimes, and a little bit more tender,
so it’s kind of, it’s not as tender as

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:04.559
spinach.

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:05.559
It’s really good though.

00:01:05.559 --> 00:01:06.559
It’s got a lot of vitamins.

00:01:06.559 --> 00:01:12.969
It’s got a lot of iron, so just do them
like that, and then, you know, these big end

00:01:12.969 --> 00:01:18.439
pieces, just sort of tear those up roughly,
you know, we’re going for kind of a rustic

00:01:18.439 --> 00:01:25.149
thing here, so don’t need to be precise
or anything, and you can also, this is a curly

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:26.740
kale as you can see it’s very curly.

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:31.009
There’s another one called dinosaur kale
that’s got flat leaves, but whatever, it’s

00:01:31.009 --> 00:01:32.100
all called kale.

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.520
You could cook it all the same way.

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:34.520
Hey banjo!

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:40.970
You want to help?

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:42.310
You want to eat some kale stems?

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:43.720
Banjo likes vegetables.

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.869
Daisy does not .Here you go buddy.

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:49.049
Get it.

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:50.829
There you go.

00:01:50.829 --> 00:01:51.829
Chompy chomp.

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:54.159
Chomp chomp chomp the little dude!

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:57.869
He is such a little buffoon.

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:05.180
Okay, so I ‘ve got my big pile of beautiful,
fluffy kale here, and we’re just going to

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:09.220
just sautee it real quick so follow me as
I turn to the left.

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:10.920
All right, I’ve got my skillet heating up
here.

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.370
I am just gonna add a little tiny touch of
oil, like half a teaspoon maybe.

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:18.190
We’re not trying to overdo this or anything.

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:23.709
Once the oil is warm I am gonna add a little
bit of minced garlic and just let that sizzle

00:02:23.709 --> 00:02:29.580
for like 30 seconds just until I can start
to like really, really smell it, so that’ll

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.200
depend on your nose.

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.900
Now it’s smelling good, and I’ve got some
sesame seeds here.

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:39.709
You can leave these out if you like, but I
do think that sesame goes nice with kale,

00:02:39.709 --> 00:02:43.879
and I think this dish would go really well
with the pork tenderloin earlier this week.

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:49.910
So, I am helping you out here buds, and then
we can add our kale, and it’s still wet.

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:53.690
I haven't like tried to dry it really thoroughly
or anything.

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:57.500
You start tossing it around, and it’ll wilt
down.

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:02.890
It’s not gonna wilt down as much as spinach
does, but put some in.

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:06.239
Add a little bit of salt.

00:03:06.239 --> 00:03:12.330
Just keep stirring it around and you can add
some more as this first little batch wilts,

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:15.360
and the salt again will help it, you know,
help draw some of the moisture out and help

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:23.909
it wilt down, and it’ll start to turn really
bright green, and just rotate it so that,

00:03:23.909 --> 00:03:27.459
you know, all the kale comes in contact with
the spinach so you are moving the cooked stuff

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:30.120
to the top and letting the uncooked stuff
fall to the bottom.

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:31.730
You could also do this in a wok.

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:32.790
It’d be really easy.

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:38.599
You’d have a lot of room to toss it around.

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:41.940
And then you could say, “Who’s ready for
some wokkin kale!?

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:45.849
“ Right, get people really excited about
it.

00:03:45.849 --> 00:03:52.540
Okay, now that it’s almost done I am gonna
add just a few drops of some toasted sesame

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:54.019
oil and again this is optional.

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:59.409
If you wanted to just go with the garlic and
olive oil and salt, that’s totally reasonable

00:03:59.409 --> 00:04:01.720
and fine.

00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:09.709
Get it all tissy-tossed around, and you could
see this like shrunk up by about half the

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:17.320
volume, but it’s a lot heartier than spinach,
so you know, this would serve two people easily.

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:19.090
Okay!

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:23.580
And just once it’s all evenly wilted it
looks pretty good to me.

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:26.500
Turn the heat off and we’re ready to serve.

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:28.450
Wham blam thank you.

00:04:28.450 --> 00:04:29.890
. . land for this kale.

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:30.890
All right.

00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:37.790
I’ll just put it into my serving dish.

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:38.790
Really pretty.

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:42.560
If you don’t like overcook it, or stew it,
it just stays this really beautiful green

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:43.780
color.

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:46.220
Woo hoo!

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:47.220
And I think the sesame seeds add a lot.

00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:52.480
I think you could do black sesame seeds and
white sesame seeds for a little bit of a Yin-Yang

00:04:52.480 --> 00:05:00.320
effect—Garlicky, and sesameey and kaleeey,
and healthy.

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:03.690
You could also, dudes, I bet you could totally
serve this over some brown rice with a little

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:07.560
bit cheese on top or something and it would
be a really great vegetarian meal.

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:08.560
Yum!

00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:09.560
Oh boy!

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:11.060
I probably could eat this whole bowl myself.

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:12.060
Okay.

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:13.060
I won’t.

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:14.060
Thank you for watching.

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:16.370
If you have any questions, please leave them
below and I’ll get to them as soon as I

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:19.782
can, or if you’d like to share your favorite
way to prepare kale, go ahead and leave that

00:05:19.782 --> 00:05:20.782
in a comment too!

00:05:20.782 --> 00:05:28.120
I hope you have a great weekend and I’ll
see y’all next week.
