Welcome back to my channel.

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:15.180
I'm going to open three more eggs in this
video and let's start ... I 

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:22.370
hope this new year has started well for you
, for me it has been ok.

00:00:22.370 --> 00:00:42.260
Let's see what we get , I think it is one
of those spinning things again, oh no, it's

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:50.510
actually a ball , we can build a ball.

00:00:50.510 --> 00:01:05.470
All these pieces and it is a very cool ball,
from the GoMove serie.

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:21.310
Let's see the second egg.

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:34.760
again a yellow capsule and you guys know already
what the yellow capsule means, we have a beyblade.

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:46.020
This is the pamphlet, again from the GoMove
serie and we have the green beyblade.

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:56.520
This is the action that it makes, very nice.

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:20.140
And the last egg, also yellow 
and we're going to have a ... I don't know

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:33.120
... what are we going to have ?! It is from
the Mixart serie and it is a cute little figurine.

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:41.520
Let's build it and see exactly what we have,
this is the figurine, is a nice little boy

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:43.130
that makes faces.

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:55.760
