Hi, I'm Bob Schmidt with HomeRemodelWorkshop.  Sometime during your project there are 

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:07.850
architectural elements that already
exist in your house such as archways and 

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:09.019
columns

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:12.369
and you would really love to build a match.

00:00:12.369 --> 00:00:16.819
Some people are freaked out by that they
think that is too difficult, it's something they can't do

00:00:16.819 --> 00:00:19.939
but there's a building product
available that could help you out.

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:26.939
I'll show you what that is, let's get to work

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:29.320
What we have here is a plywood it's

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:31.999
specifically engineered to bend

00:00:31.999 --> 00:00:34.910
when they put all these laminant pieces
together

00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:37.870
(a) they put all the wood grain in the
same direction and

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:40.170
(b) they installed what looks like a

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:42.690
fiber wood in between the layers.

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.350
What this plywood will do

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:48.040
without any wetting without any scoring or cutting

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:50.740
is it's made to 

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:52.260
bend

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.150
which as you can see

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:58.190
if you needed a column built in
your house or you even needed to cut a

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:02.290
small piece of this off, to make a curved
archway to either put

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:05.960
drywall or plaster lathe or anything
around

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.380
this plywood is exactly what you need

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:12.460
in tight spots and tough spots where I
just can't come up with another

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.810
material that'll give me a nice uniform
nailing surface

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.850
this is the stuff I always go with

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:22.700
it's probably three times more expensive
than your typical half-inch plywood but

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:26.940
it's worth every penny in the amount of
time you save.  This plywood can be ordered

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:28.920
so that it bends in either direction

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.700
either you can order it so it bends the
four foot direction or if you have a

00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.500
large barrel ceiling or something that
you're building you can order it so that it

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:39.520
bends the eight foot direction, it can't bend both.  If you want to hang a potato

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.160
chip your going to have to get something else

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:46.100
but this will really help you out in
those situations where you need an exact

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:50.810
curve as a good base for quarter-inch
drywall and I've even had drywall hangers

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.300
ask me if they could finish this directly

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:57.419
because it's porus enough to hold
mud and I've allowed them to do it and 

00:01:57.419 --> 00:01:59.659
we've had a great finished product.

00:01:59.659 --> 00:02:02.770
Just wanted to let you know about this
product could help you out in a pinch.
