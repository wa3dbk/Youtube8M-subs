00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:22.820
Here is rotating globe of Mars and we're going
to zoom in on the middle Southern latitudes.

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:27.840
The part of Mars where we find these active
slope features and we're zooming in on the

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.230
Newton Basin crater here.

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:36.339
What you can see are lots of gullies. The
active features that we've recently discovered

00:00:36.339 --> 00:00:41.530
are on the slopes that are facing mostly to
the North to the equator.

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:50.390
What we see are much smaller scale features
than gullies. You can see an area of bedrock,

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:56.930
a steep cliff here, and it's from that bedrock
that these dark features flow out.

00:00:56.930 --> 00:01:02.570
Given the latitude and the slope aspect and
particular the temperatures, it suggests that

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:09.030
there's a volatile involved here and the appropriate
volatile for this temperature is water, probably

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:12.860
salty water because sometimes these are active
when it's a little bit below the freezing

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:18.050
point of pure water, salt lowers the melting
point. And water on Mars should be salty;

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:21.240
we know there's lots of salts on Mars.

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:27.360
This is potentially actual water, in the liquid
state, flowing on Mars today not millions

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:35.049
of years ago. In late spring and into the
summer is when these features form and fade.

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:40.570
By late summer, early fall they'll be completely
gone and we'll see just a normal looking slope

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:42.520
throughout the winter.

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:46.560
Every place where we have multiple years these
features recur.

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.670
They're not exactly the same, they may be
more or less active one year than another

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:52.620
but they keep coming back.
