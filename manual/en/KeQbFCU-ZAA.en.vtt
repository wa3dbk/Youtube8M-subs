00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.030
 

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:11.320
What's going on Bhangra lovers? Today
we've got a great workout step for you.

00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:13.840
It's going to give you one heck of a
workout on your legs.

00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:17.560
It's called Jugni. And when you get low
in Bhangra, this is what we're talking

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:21.880
about. So I'm going to show you the lower
body first, and then we're going to work

00:00:21.880 --> 00:00:25.840
on the upper body, and we're going to put
it all together and do Jugni. Be ready

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:29.320
for this one. It's going to be a little
tough, but I know you can do it. So with

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:33.100
our lower body, I'm going to start with a
very wide posture. It's like you're

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:36.670
almost doing a wall sit, but your legs
are going to be out way further. So you

00:00:36.670 --> 00:00:41.710
want to be nice and low, just like this.
And the back of your knee, this angle

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:46.299
needs to be obtuse. So that means your
heel is not going to be in line with the

00:00:46.299 --> 00:00:51.069
back of your knee. It's going to be slightly out.
We also want our feet and our knees to

00:00:51.069 --> 00:00:56.499
be almost 180, so that you've got this
nice wide stance. You're low and you're

00:00:56.499 --> 00:01:00.760
feeling it right here. Alright, your legs
are definitely tight- both your

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:05.430
hamstrings and your quads. Now, we've got
this low posture. We want to make sure

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.399
moving up, that we've got a very straight
back. We're not leaning forward like this.

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:13.780
We've got a straight back so it helps
give us that core stretch as well. That's

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:18.070
what's going to get you the full body
workout in Jugni. All right, now stand up

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:21.100
for a second, because I know that can get
a little tiring, even for just a little

00:01:21.100 --> 00:01:25.179
bit. We don't need to go through just the
lower body by itself. The hands are

00:01:25.179 --> 00:01:28.750
pretty simple, so mixing them together
will be able to give us the full

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:34.600
workout of Jugni. Now, with our upper
body, our hands, with our left arm first,

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:39.310
is going to be right here in front of us.
So you want to line it up with about the

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:42.579
middle of your chest, but just a little
over, and you don't want to be too close.

00:01:42.579 --> 00:01:46.960
You want to have an extension. Notice how
my arm is extended right here in front

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:51.579
of you with your fingers up, and your
pointer finger and your thumb connected.

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:55.869
Alright, our right arm is going to be
straight up in the air like this, with

00:01:55.869 --> 00:02:00.670
the palm facing forward and the same
fingers just like this, matching our left

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:05.319
arm. When you put this all together, we're
going to be nice and low right here with

00:02:05.319 --> 00:02:09.819
our posture like this. This is very key
that you get the posture right, because

00:02:09.819 --> 00:02:12.760
that's how you get the full benefit of
Jugni, and that's how you'll definitely

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.730
feel it. 
There's one other key thing I want to

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:19.930
point out to you. You've got to shake
those pecs and those delts. There's not a

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:23.560
whole lot going on in this step, so this
is really where you're going to get the

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:27.010
movement in your body, and this is where
you're going to feel a great upper body

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:31.300
workout. And also, I said one step- one
thing I need to tell you, but there's two.

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:34.570
You actually have to smile as well. Don't
forget that. You gotta cheese when you're

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:38.890
doing Jugni. All right. Let's try to put
that all together. We're going to get in

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:43.660
that posture. I'm going to try it with
our lower body and upper body combined,

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:47.050
so we don't have to break up the two. I
think we can do it in one shot- what do

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:50.260
you guys think? You ready? All right,
they're ready to go. I'm ready to go.

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:54.700
Let's do this. You're ready to go. Left
leg goes first. So what we're going to do

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:59.020
is just slightly raise our heel just a
little bit, and bring it down. There's no

00:02:59.020 --> 00:03:05.050
movement of where the legs come up. It's
just a one, two. So it's left, right, left,

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:10.540
right; but the beat count is one, two, one,
two.

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:15.130
Even if you do it this small, that's okay,
The key is to get that shake up here, as

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:18.460
well as getting that wide posture. On my
count-

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:25.960
let's start. Here we go- left leg first-
three, two, one, and go.

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:33.100
We're going to go one, two, one, two.
Get that shake in there now - one, two.

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:38.860
Nice and low, one, two. There you go. One,
two. Good job Raymond. Feel it in your

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:49.090
legs. Keep going guys. And one, two, one, two,
one, two. One more time. And one, two, one,

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:55.870
two, one, two. And here we go. Straighten out.
And just a little bit I felt down my

00:03:55.870 --> 00:03:59.560
legs. I know they're burning-it's okay if
yours are too. Let's try this with some

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:05.910
music. Put it all together- DJ spin it for
me! We're going to do Jugni. Here we go,

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:10.460
nice and slow. Really shake those
shoulders and chest. That's what I want

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:16.640
you guys to focus on. All right, on my
count in three, two, one, here we go.

00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:22.330
Break it down. Great job.

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:33.770
One, two, three, four. Good job everybody.
Now, those arms are probably getting a

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:37.370
little tired. So what we're gonna do in a
second here is go ahead and switch our

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:42.910
arms, just to change things up. On me.
Switch it nice and slow, just like this.

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:50.330
Great job, keep the legs the same. Good
job. Try to keep that same posture. Your

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:53.630
palm is facing forward.
You've got your arm almost right in the

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:56.860
middle of your chest, just a little over.
Good job.

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:03.470
Stay low. I feel the burn. It's okay,
you're probably feeling it too. All

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:08.360
right, cool it down guys.
Awesome job. It's a great step. Jugni

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:14.350
helps you get a full body workout. Keep
up the great work. Way to go.
