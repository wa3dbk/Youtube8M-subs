00:00:30.566 --> 00:00:33.482
Stop it!
I hate being on camera.

00:00:33.502 --> 00:00:36.383
Why? You're beautiful.
You're like a supermodel.

00:00:36.403 --> 00:00:38.274
What? No. I'm not.

00:00:38.294 --> 00:00:42.087
Okay, you're right.
You're very, very ugly, like a troll.

00:00:42.107 --> 00:00:45.236
- What? Like... ugly?
- Yeah, like an angry troll.

00:00:46.494 --> 00:00:48.364
Shut up!
Give me the camera.

00:00:52.299 --> 00:00:53.730
What are you doing?

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:55.148
Nothing.

00:01:16.278 --> 00:01:18.536
I thought I heard someone laughing.

00:01:19.315 --> 00:01:24.147
You did. I was... reading
something funny.

00:01:24.588 --> 00:01:27.057
Good.
You found the books.

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:28.871
I did.

00:01:45.423 --> 00:01:48.257
I haven't seen real books,
I mean...

00:01:49.154 --> 00:01:52.447
real paper bound books
in a long, long time.

00:01:53.069 --> 00:01:55.276
A novelty, I agree.

00:01:57.287 --> 00:01:59.474
See, that's funny.
Novelty.

00:02:00.223 --> 00:02:02.701
You do have a sense
of humor after all.

00:02:02.721 --> 00:02:04.624
I do not understand.

00:02:07.412 --> 00:02:09.349
These are all mine?

00:02:09.369 --> 00:02:12.319
These are the personal items
you chose to bring.

00:02:12.643 --> 00:02:14.443
You thought it would help.

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:15.850
Help with what?

00:02:16.186 --> 00:02:17.538
You did not say.

00:03:16.881 --> 00:03:18.081
You found him.

00:03:18.482 --> 00:03:20.899
I thought you said I was
the only person on board.

00:03:20.919 --> 00:03:21.953
You are.

00:03:21.973 --> 00:03:23.473
Who the hell is that?

00:03:23.493 --> 00:03:25.564
He is of no consequence.

00:03:26.033 --> 00:03:27.194
How come?

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:28.951
He is dead.

00:03:29.454 --> 00:03:33.443
That is why I said you were the only live,
flesh and blood person on this ship.

00:03:36.763 --> 00:03:38.212
Who was he then?

00:03:38.232 --> 00:03:39.318
A prisoner.

00:03:41.878 --> 00:03:43.154
What did he do?

00:03:43.174 --> 00:03:44.743
He was a mercenary...

00:03:45.765 --> 00:03:47.115
sent to kill you.

00:03:54.981 --> 00:03:58.918
