00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:06.570
So, you'd like to train your dog in one day.
Well, that's a wonderful idea. Hopefully you're

00:00:06.570 --> 00:00:10.929
willing to continue to work with your dog
after that first day. It helps a lot to have

00:00:10.929 --> 00:00:16.670
a relationship with the dog already, so that
the dog is willing to work with you and watch

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:22.990
you. If not then a very motivational treat
might help; help you do what you want to do.

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:31.210
Then knowing exactly what you want to accomplish
and being very disciplined about how you offer

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:37.160
that to the dog. It's good to know your dog's
learning style, because some dogs learn slower

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:43.000
than others and it's very good to know how
to keep pace with your dog. So, you might

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:49.440
break something up into segments; if you want
to teach your dog how to sit. It's very quick

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.499
if you already know; if you've practiced your
timing and you can work with something like

00:00:53.499 --> 00:00:57.539
the clicker to mark the behavior. It's very
easy to teach them something like sitting,

00:00:57.539 --> 00:01:03.870
lying down or multiple things in one day.
The key is to work in short sessions, five

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:09.219
to fifteen minutes depending upon how long
your dog can work. Accomplish something and

00:01:09.219 --> 00:01:14.840
when you get the behavior quit and take a
break, because frequently we like the idea

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.380
of “well, let me get it one more time that
was so exciting, I did it well.” It's much

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:24.540
more effective for the dog to stop on a high
note when they've done something. So, with

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:43.570
marking something you might get the sit behavior,
mark the sit. Stand, stand, stand.

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:47.479
You can even offer the treat away initially
to get your dog to stand back up so you have

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:56.380
another opportunity to capture a sit.
Then when your dog knows what you want and

00:01:56.380 --> 00:02:01.840
they're just offering it to you; as she starts
to sit, "sit," clicking the sit and giving

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:02.289
the treat.
