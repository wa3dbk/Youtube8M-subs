00:00:02.169 --> 00:00:06.100
Do you know you can actually use just 2 threads
in the serger?

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:13.139
You get a 2 thread overlock, a 2 thread wrapped
edge, or a 2 thread rolled hem, which means

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:17.199
your using 1 spool less of thread and it actually
looks really nice.

00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:19.610
It's great for very delicate like fabrics.

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:22.410
I actually did a 2 thread wrap on this ribbon.

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.730
I wanted it to have this green hue to it to
match a project.

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:29.680
I actually got overzealous and did an entire
extra spool of it, so I always have it to

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:30.680
show.

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:34.670
It's really nice because there's not that
extra thread tucked on the back side.

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:39.309
It just had 2 threads that I had to match
because that was what I was going for.

00:00:39.309 --> 00:00:44.379
The reason we're pointed down here is this
is where it is stored, the 2 thread converter.

00:00:44.379 --> 00:00:48.329
In this little gray foam, you want to pick
up the white button.

00:00:48.329 --> 00:00:54.459
As you pull the white button out from its
little covered area here, this little guy

00:00:54.459 --> 00:00:59.890
is what is going to allow the machine to think
that there's 3 threads, but when we only have

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:00.890
2.

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:06.070
Now I've gone ahead and taken off the foot
so I could really show you how and where this

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:07.450
is going to attach.

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:12.740
First thing I'm going to do is remove my upper
looper thread, that's the green one.

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:19.030
Now I just have our needle thread and the
lower looper, but once again the machine has

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:25.360
to have something in that upper looper to
catch on this needle.

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:26.920
We're going to take the unit.

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.360
The white button is up.

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.570
There's a little groove right up here, you
just kind of slide it down there like a little

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:34.570
knife.

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:35.570
Now it's really loose.

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:40.960
That's because when you take the other tip,
the part that actually is kind of like a little

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:48.399
tiny hook, you're going to push it back behind
the upper looper so it sits in the eye.

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:52.710
What's going to happen is, as we stitch, you've
probably noticed that you're going to see

00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:56.359
the upper looper comes up and catches.

00:01:56.359 --> 00:02:01.439
See how that blue thread is going to be nestled,
that's the lower looper thread, nestled in

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:06.479
that little groove to come up and catch the
needle thread.

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:11.110
That's what's going to actually make the overlock
stitch all the way through.

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:15.200
What I'm going to do is we're going to just
take out the rest of the green thread.

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:20.260
You know me, I like to remove the spool completely
from the serger, going to put my foot back

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:21.819
on.

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:25.810
Those just snap on and off by pushing that
little lever in the back.

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:32.340
Now this is set up for a wide version, that
means that the needle is in the left needle

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:37.379
position with just the lower looper engaged.

00:02:37.379 --> 00:02:40.069
We're able to stitch, no problem.

00:02:40.069 --> 00:02:45.420
In your manual, on page 30, there is a little
chart like how we get this all set up, so

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.319
you can actually see what is going on.

00:02:48.319 --> 00:02:49.650
Let's just see what we have.

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:54.580
Right now we have the 2 thread wrapped edge
and that's because it goes all the way to

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:56.830
the back side and tucks over here.

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:02.040
If we wanted to not have it go all the way
around, which means we don't want it to really

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:08.200
take up as much thread, take your needle thread
tension down to 0 and watch what it's going

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:09.200
to do.

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:14.890
This is a really nice way to just run a nice,
simple edge along your fabric without the

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:17.950
bulk because you don't have that extra thread
in there.

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:21.420
You get a simple edge with that part on the
back.

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:24.590
It's not holding anything together.

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:28.510
We're not sewing a seam, we're only going
along an edge.

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:38.730
Now this is actually a really good option
for a 2 thread flatlock for a little smoother

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:45.890
edge because when you take the tension down
to 0, here we go.

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:48.329
The book doesn't even show you this, but you
can do it.

00:03:48.329 --> 00:03:51.019
2 thread flatlock is actually one of my favorites.

00:03:51.019 --> 00:03:56.000
That's just because when we have that tension
on the needle to 0, we can flatten that out

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.190
and open and then it lays perfectly.

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:03.170
You're not fighting that extra thread trying
to get it to nestle down on the inside, which

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:05.019
normally you have to do.

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:06.630
That is a really pretty option.

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:08.870
2 thread conversion uses less thread.

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:11.359
I only have the needle thread and the lower
looper.

00:04:11.359 --> 00:04:15.579
You're choice, you could do the right needle,
it doesn't matter which needle you do, but

00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:19.100
2 thread is a very nice delicate stitch.
