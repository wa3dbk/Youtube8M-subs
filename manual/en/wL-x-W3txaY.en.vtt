00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:10.720
WASH: Facility is clear.

00:00:11.300 --> 00:00:12.200
CAROLINA: Find anything?

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:14.160
WASH: Nothing we didn't already know.

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:15.500
CAROLINA: Figured as much.

00:00:15.740 --> 00:00:17.300
CAROLINA: This place was a dead end.

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:18.480
WASH: Sorry, boss.

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:23.380
CAROLINA: The structure we're going to next - you're positive our target was there?

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:25.500
WASH: I know what I saw, that's why it's on our list.

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.480
CAROLINA: But I know what I saw, and it doesn't make any sense.

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:31.420
WASH: All the more reason to investigate.

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:33.700
CAROLINA: Alright then.

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:35.520
CAROLINA: Let's go.

00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:38.700
CAROLINA: Let's go find CT.

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:55.460
(Gulls cawing)

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:02.240
(Gull cawing)

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.740
(Gunshot)

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:06.940
??: To the director of Project Freelancer, Dr. Leonard Church.

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:10.860
??: Dear director, allow me to introduce myself.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:16.280
??: I am a representative of the newly formed UNSC oversight sub-committee.

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:17.360
(Sniper rifle zooms in on soldiers chattering)

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:24.360
??: Our organization is charged with the protection of high level assets of the military, one of which recently went missing.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:30.520
??: These assets are entrusted to our programs as a privilege, not as a right.

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:34.720
??: As such, they will be safeguarded with the utmost care.

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:43.200
??: In these dark times, mankind has the opportunity not only to prove its humanity, but to earn it.

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.880
(Helicopter blades whirring)

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.280
WYOMING: Well, third craft this afternoon. Let's see who else is arriving.

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:59.220
??: I look forward to a long, and mutually beneficial relationship for our two departments.

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:05.880
HARGROVE: Yours truly, Malcolm Hargrove, assistant to the oversight sub-committee chairman.

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.960
(Helicopter blades whirring)

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:09.420
MALE SOLDIER: It's her.

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:11.860
FEMALE SOLDIER: I can't believe you'd trust that bitch after what she did to us.

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:14.860
WYOMING: There she is.

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.500
WYOMING: Come in, command. Tell the director "she's here".

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:21.540
MALE SOLDIER: What is it?

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:23.400
CT: It's nothing, come on.

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.920
(Helicopter powering down)

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.200
COUNSELOR: Congratulations, Director. Another successful test.

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:41.580
DIRECTOR: A new fragment was harvested this morning, Counselor. Find it a match.

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.480
COUNSELOR: This morning? That is ahead of schedule.

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:47.560
DIRECTOR: Our time grows short, find it a match.

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:50.140
CAROLINA: Director, Wyoming reported in.

00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:50.820
Director: And?

00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:53.280
CAROLINA: You won't like what he found, sir.

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:59.780
DIRECTOR: Agent Carolina, information never displeases me. It's ignorance that I find unforgivable.

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:01.200
DIRECTOR: Report.

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:03.780
CAROLINA: It's like you said. CT is with them.

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.280
DIRECTOR: You know what to do.

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:11.520
DIRECTOR: I do not need to remind you how valuable our technology is, Carolina.

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:15.560
CAROLINA: She doesn't have an AI sir. And she wasn't exactly the best agent.

00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:21.440
DIRECTOR: CT will be an acceptable loss, but her armor must not fall into the wrong hands.

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:22.260
CAROLINA: I understand.

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.340
CAROLINA: Will we be the only forces sent out on this mission, sir?

00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:29.340
DIRECTOR: Leave personnel decisions to me, agent! Just do your job.

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.480
DIRECTOR: It's time to cut the head off the enemy once and for all.

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:33.600
CAROLINA: Yes, sir.

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:42.560
TUCKER: So, how do you even know this Carolina chick?

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:43.920
CHURCH (Epsilon??): Oh, Tex used to tell me stories.

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:45.660
TUCKER: You mean, tell Alpha stories?

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:46.820
CHURCH: Oh, yeah, I guess.

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:49.960
CHURCH: You know what? Whatever, it's hard for me to know who's memory I'm in.

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.300
CABOOSE: Oh, yeah. Same thing happens to me with things I'm in.

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:54.200
CABOOSE: Like my helmet.

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:56.600
CABOOSE: That's why I wrote my name on the inside of it.

00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:59.840
CABOOSE: I used my tongue. That was hard to do.

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:02.140
CABOOSE: Now I can't pronounce (unintelligible).

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:04.980
TUCKER: So... How many people are you?

00:04:05.260 --> 00:04:07.520
CHURCH: (Laughs) I don't know. A bunch, I guess.

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:08.740
TUCKER: Are they all assholes?

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:11.980
CHURCH: (Laughs) Yeah. A dozen different fragments and we all have the same shitty circle of friends.

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:12.920
CHURCH: Lucky us.

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:16.440
(Theta setting off fireworks)

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:18.440
NORTH: That's really great, Theta!

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:21.080
THETA: Thank you. I worked super hard on it.

00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:22.460
SOUTH: Ugh.

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:25.400
YORK: Hey Theta, you mind if I talk to North for a second?

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:27.160
THETA: Uhh, okay.

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:32.340
YORK: Need you to shut down while we chat, okay? Delta too. You know, it's the rules.

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:33.060
THETA: North?

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:35.480
NORTH: It'll be okay. I won't talk too long.

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:36.420
THETA: Alright.

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:38.160
NORTH: What's up?

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:40.060
YORK: I need to ask you about something.

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:41.560
NORTH: Oh, okay. Shoot.

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:43.660
YORK: I need to ask you about the Alpha.

00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:45.660
NORTH: Where did you hear that word?

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:47.760
YORK: Same place you heard it, up here.

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:48.760
WASH: What's an "Alpha"?

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.460
YORK: Wash? Are you eating inside your helmet?

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:52.600
WASH: (Smacks lips) Maybe.

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:56.380
WASH: Delta said they got the helmet waste disposal out of beta.

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:58.320
WASH: That it would make my eating more efficient.

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:00.340
YORK: (Laughs) And you believe that?

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:02.900
YORK: Maybe he is getting more personable.

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:05.560
NORTH: It's not "an Alpha" Wash, it's "the Alpha".

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:09.580
NORTH: Theta thinks about him a lot. More than thinks, really. He's- he's obsessed.

00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:10.820
YORK: Delta, too.

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:13.620
YORK: You know how all the units call each other "brother"?

00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:16.060
YORK: They call this one... "Father".

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:18.420
YORK: No, that's not right...

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:19.360
NORTH: Creator.

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:20.160
YORK: Yeah...

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:22.160
WASH: (With food in his mouth) I thought the director would be their creator?

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:24.680
YORK: Haven't you been paying any attention in class?

00:05:24.900 --> 00:05:27.980
YORK: AI's aren't created, they're copies of someone.

00:05:27.980 --> 00:05:30.060
NORTH: But our AI's are just fragments.

00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:32.640
YORK: Which begs the question: "where's the original"?

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:36.040
WASH: What, so, this Alpha thing is what creates the fragments?

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:38.620
YORK: Jesus, will you swallow for God's sake?

00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:41.080
WASH: (Swallows) It creates them?

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:45.460
NORTH: Yeah, Theta isn't clear. It creates them, or something.

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:49.580
YORK: Yeah... It's the "or something" part that has me worried.
