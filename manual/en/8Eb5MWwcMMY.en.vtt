00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:05.400
Let's add 19 and
3/18 to 18 and 2/3.

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.640
So I like to separate out
the whole number parts

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:08.740
from the fraction parts.

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:14.590
So 19 and 3/18 is the same
thing as 19 plus 3/18.

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:18.700
And to that, we are
going to add 18 and 2/3,

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:23.690
which is the same
thing as 18 plus 2/3.

00:00:23.690 --> 00:00:26.520
Now we can separately add
the whole number parts.

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:29.295
So we could add
the 19 to the 18.

00:00:29.295 --> 00:00:33.210
So we could do 19 plus 18.

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:36.960
And then we can add
the fraction parts--

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:42.896
let me do this in green--
plus 3/18 plus 2/3.

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:48.970
Now 19/18, pretty
straightforward.

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:49.830
That is what?

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:50.330
Let's see.

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:51.739
19 plus 19 would be 38.

00:00:51.739 --> 00:00:53.405
So this is going to
be 1 less than that.

00:00:53.405 --> 00:00:54.880
It's going to be 37.

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:57.060
So that gives me 37.

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:59.830
And then 3/18 plus
2/3, to add them,

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:01.640
I need to have the
same denominator.

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.530
And the least common
multiple of 18 and 3 is 18.

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:09.250
So let's convert 2/3
to something over 18.

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:13.810
So 2/3, if I want to write
it as something over 18,

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:16.550
well, I multiplied
the denominator by 6,

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:19.060
so I'd also have to
multiply the numerator by 6.

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:22.580
So it's the same thing as 12/18.

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:27.390
So I can rewrite 2/3 as 12/18.

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:29.390
And now I can add these
two things together.

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.240
That's going to be-- so
I have 37 plus-- it's

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:37.960
going to be something over
18-- plus something over 18.

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:42.452
3 plus 12 is 15, plus 15/18.

00:01:42.452 --> 00:01:44.160
And so expressing this
as a mixed number,

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:48.930
I get 37 and 15/18.

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.050
And that's the right number.

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:52.520
But we can simplify
it even more.

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.160
We can simplify the 15/18.

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:58.330
Both the numerator and the
denominator are divisible by 3.

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:00.084
So let's divide them both by 3.

00:02:00.084 --> 00:02:02.000
And we're not changing
the value because we're

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.680
doing the same thing to the
numerator and the denominator.

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:09.789
And so this gives us,
we still have our 37,

00:02:09.789 --> 00:02:14.400
but the numerator is now 5,
and the denominator is now 6.

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.020
So we get 37 and 5/6.

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:20.850
And we're done.
