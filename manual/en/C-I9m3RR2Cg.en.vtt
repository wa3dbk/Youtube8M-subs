00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:01.140
Math.

00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:03.790
I always found after teaching for 21
years.

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:06.370
Kids love it, but can, don't, don't love
it.

00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:08.920
And now I think I've got 27 kids in my
class

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:11.550
who at some point during the day, say,
hey, I love math.

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:19.530
[MUSIC]

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.130
&gt;&gt; From the first time we started this,

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:27.380
the kids were just through the roof about
it.

00:00:27.380 --> 00:00:29.340
I mean, they couldn't quit talking about
it.

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:30.840
They were excited.

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.299
I could see that enthusiasm.

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:34.390
I could see that they were just wanting to

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:38.100
spend hours and hours of time doing math
calculations.

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:41.670
&gt;&gt; They were really into it.

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.910
I think given the demographic that we
teachers agewise and

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:51.290
the generation we teach, technology is so
heavy in their lives.

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:52.840
Every, everywhere they are, it's
technology.

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.360
[MUSIC]

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:59.590
They're real excited to be using Khan
Academy.

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:01.790
They were like yeah, I I got this.

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:04.420
I, I, I can do division now, I couldn't do
division before.

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:07.390
&gt;&gt; First day that I had my Khan Academy

00:01:07.390 --> 00:01:10.900
class, I could not believe how engaged
they were.

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:13.940
The bell rang, and nobody wanted to leave
my classroom.

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:17.920
So I had to actually tell them you have to
go to your next class.

00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:20.690
You cannot continue working on math here.

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:23.380
So that's when I knew okay, we're onto
something here.

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.420
&gt;&gt; I like how it's different than the math
book,

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:31.850
when everyone's doing pretty much the same
level of things.

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:34.000
And if it, like, higher, then it's boring
for them,

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.390
and if they're, like, lower, they're not
exactly understanding it.

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:41.610
Khan Academy is directly helping because
every day every

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:46.200
child has the opportunity to have
individualized learning opportunities.

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.590
We're there specifically working at their

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:52.460
level, being provided with instantaneous
feedback.

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:57.100
Which is not something that they would get
in the traditional teacher lecture model.

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:01.870
&gt;&gt; I see every student utterly engaged in
what they're doing.

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:06.860
And they are talking about math, they are
excited about math.

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.400
They are appropriately challenged, and
those kids who are really math

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:14.580
superstars are able to push themselves to
where they want to be.

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:23.710
&gt;&gt; High school students are definitely
lacking a lot of foundations.

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:29.120
There's some big gaps, specifically
negative numbers fractions, decimals.

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.050
They come into ninth grade and they're
like

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:33.570
oh, I've heard this speech before,I
already know it.

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:35.420
And so, Khan Academy says, actually, you
don't

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:37.440
know it, because you just got this problem
wrong.

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:41.110
And so it confronts them with their own
false confidence,

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:43.320
and then they're like, okay, now we need
to learn it.

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:45.320
And they learn it, finally, for the first
time.

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:49.260
&gt;&gt; What Khan is really good at doing is
giving instant feedback to

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:53.290
all 36 kids in my classroom, in a way that
I could never do.

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:56.980
So every student, on every problem, is
getting instant feedback.

00:02:56.980 --> 00:02:59.300
Those misconceptions are not solidified.

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:00.570
I think that's the one thing Khan

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:02.850
has changed dramatically, is now their
learning processes,

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:07.120
they learn how to do them correctly, as
opposed to just learning how to get by.

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.420
&gt;&gt; I think the biggest change I've seen in

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:14.820
our students is their idea about how
learning happens.

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:17.150
Students felt that the teacher told you
information,

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:19.760
and magically you understood it, and you
did well.

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:21.690
And Khan Academy has really changed that,
now

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:23.480
the students have realized that it's their
job

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.610
to figure it out, and there are supports

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:28.674
for them, but they are responsible for
understanding it.

00:03:28.674 --> 00:03:32.837
[MUSIC]

00:03:32.837 --> 00:03:37.000
Khan Academy allows them to go back if
they didn't get it.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.940
Or if they got it, they engage in it in a
different type of mathematics.

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:44.800
It's just really awesome, to see them
there

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:48.436
on Khan Academy doing their thing
searching for videos.

00:03:48.436 --> 00:03:50.596
Tying it back to what we're learning in
class,

00:03:50.596 --> 00:03:53.536
and being motivated to take charge of
their own learning.
