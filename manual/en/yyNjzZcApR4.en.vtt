00:00:00.269 --> 00:00:06.740
You know what would really help me out would
be to have a tiny, some would say chibi robot

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:09.139
to help out with chores around the apartment.

00:00:09.139 --> 00:00:14.840
Those haven't really been invented yet, so
I'm going to have to just continue to fantasize

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:21.840
by playing one in entry #46 on the Definitive
50 GameCube Games, Chibi-Robo!

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:49.880
The box for this game declares "Plug Into
Adventure!" and that's exactly what you'll

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:52.620
get when you play Chibi-Robo!

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:57.860
In this title, you take on the role of a tiny
silver robot who has to run around performing

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:04.860
chores and making his host family, the Sandersons,
happy.

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:17.350
You soon discover that this "typical" family
has quite a few problems. The dad is spend-happy

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:22.740
and unemployed, the mom's losing her mind,
and the daughter is out of touch with reality.

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:27.200
Throughout your work as the master of chores,
you need to build up Happy Points by doing

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:32.789
little things that improve life for your owners.
Doing so boosts your rank, and that's important,

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:37.029
because who doesn't want to achieve the status
of "Super Chibi-Robo"?

00:01:37.029 --> 00:01:41.490
Work includes scrubbing paw marks off the
floor, picking up trash, and helping out both

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.389
the human and living-toy inhabitants of the
Sanderson household.

00:01:46.389 --> 00:01:51.560
This probably goes without saying, but Chibi-Robo!
is one unique game. Let's face it, plenty

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:57.909
of titles are built on performing bland, repetitive
tasks, but few dare advertise that fact.

00:01:57.909 --> 00:02:03.219
Chibi-Robo! is an action-adventure game about
the small things in life, and how they can

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:08.360
make a big difference. Rather than battling
orcs, you'll slay trash, and instead of climbing

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:13.640
mountains, you'll climb kitchen tables. Still,
there is definitely a noble quest, and an

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.280
intrepid hero.

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:20.080
All of this serves to give this game some
incredible charm. Chibi-Robo! takes numerous

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:23.230
small moments and turns them into meaningful
narrative.

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:28.560
