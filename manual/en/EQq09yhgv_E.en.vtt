00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:03.570
there's a a group called generation
opportunity apparently they try to reach

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:05.020
out to young voters

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:09.889
old-boy I love it when conservatives try
to figure out what young voters think

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:13.570
and so this is of course a coke founded

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:16.900
group their against Obamacare

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:20.789
right now %uh the government is trying
to get young people to sign up

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:24.109
because it's important to the process
that they be able to sign up

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:27.500
so the King and through the exchange
inning get their health insurance

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:30.710
this group is trying to convince them
not to sign

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:34.520
they're saying hey it's better if you
pay the fine rather sign up

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:38.110
South seems like a hard a

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:42.379
sell because if you pay the fine you
don't get health care

00:00:42.379 --> 00:00:46.250
if you sign up yes you pay something but
at least you get health care

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:49.820
and so far the report so that it is been
surprisingly

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.329
inexpensive okay so how do you think a
missing people

00:00:53.329 --> 00:00:56.980
to not sign up well they're not gonna
talk about any other substance

00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:00.109
their I could take any other policies or
you

00:01:00.109 --> 00:01:03.480
any reasons you shouldn't sign up
instead they're gonna try to scare you

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:03.780
with

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.820
really weird creepy thats here's what

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:10.280
icy chill sign up for Obamacare

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:15.299
yeah it's actually my first time go

00:01:15.299 --> 00:01:21.030
post okay at work

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:28.030
better

00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:35.380
I'm world

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:38.170
our just

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:42.030
that is pretty much

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.270
epic in terms of how creepiness and

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:50.600
business denigrating Uncle Sam I thought
Uncle Sam was a beloved

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:55.520
American figure and for the republicans
the conservatives to do this to Uncle

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:56.260
Sam

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.600
how unpatriotic and un-american how dare
you

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:03.740
by these are put together by the same
creeps who think that they should decide

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:05.310
that your reproductive rights

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.899
that health insurance should cover your
reproductive rights

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:12.010
the you should have to buy birth control
your own that if

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:16.500
the government at allows issuance the
cover another pays for but it allows

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:17.550
users to covered

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:21.330
well then a their on fairly approaching
upon

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:25.200
a the religion and that a they are

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:28.880
getting between you and your doctor but
ironically these are the guys who are

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:30.310
your between you and your doctor

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:34.540
when you make the most important choices
and yes when you're in those Terps

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:38.990
it's not democrats it's republicans who
say I'm gonna tell you what to do with

00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:39.590
your body

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:43.360
k nonetheless they wanna scare the hell
are you now they can run

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:49.620
and equal opportunity at for the males
the stock k everything seems normal

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:56.580
when I see you're new to Obamacare as
well yes I had significant one odd

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:59.210
to keep answered

00:02:59.210 --> 00:03:05.520
okay

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:08.950
on on

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:15.950
home

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.410
now look where I don't think a lot of
young voters

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:23.840
are stupid enough to believe that you
signed up for Obamacare

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:28.210
your actually get a doctor you'll get at
Uncle Sam was going to violate you in

00:03:28.210 --> 00:03:29.040
the ass

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.580
good agenda up

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:35.820
leader Evan Feinberg says Chen up there
so cool

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:39.110
know you actually not required to buy
health insurance if you know about

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.930
Obamacare

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:43.160
you might have to pay a fine but that's
going to be cheaper for you

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:46.420
and better for you I

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:49.970
know what are they don't care about
policy and that's who still would have

00:03:49.970 --> 00:03:50.680
to say

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:54.250
all year paying a fine is so much better
for me than getting health care

00:03:54.250 --> 00:03:59.450
I guess if you spend $750 thousand
dollars like they are on this ad

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:00.100
campaign

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:03.960
you think the american people will
listen to it anything a look at how they

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:04.620
treat you

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:08.420
if the young people are stupid there on
these as they have what

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:11.430
what our young people know he wrote
idiots

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:14.820
soldiers feeding this pure propaganda
probably work does as well

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:17.980
as it works on our older voters yeah
wrong again bob
