Hi welcome to Sweet Art Made Simple.

00:00:09.760 --> 00:00:13.360
One of the questions I get asked all the time is, "How do you frost a cake?"

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:18.800
How do you make it so smooth.

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.920
First let's talk about the frosting I use on most of my cakes.

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:28.940
Buy a tub of vanilla store-bought pre-made frosting

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:29.440
 

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:36.240
Put that in a bowl. Then use that tub to fill Crisco shortening. Now put that in your bowl. Mix well with a beater

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:39.200
Add one 1 pound box of Powdered Sugar in your bowl and mix on low speed for 1 minute.

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.960
Then mix on higher speed for five minutes.

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.120
This makes a perfect icing to frost a cake.

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.880
I baked two 8-inch cakes, filled them and crumb coated them.

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:06.160
A crumb coat is taking a spatula and smoothing the frosting on just like glue to the cake. This sets the cake.

00:01:10.600 --> 00:01:17.600
It gets all the crumbs away. Put in the refrigerator till it is set and then you are ready to frost your cake.

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:46.080
Take a heap of icing just like this. It looks like a lot at first.

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:59.040
Just use your spatula and frost the top.

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:20.960
Now you are ready to ice the sides. Putting frosting on alittle at a time.

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:45.920
Keep working with it until you have a nice smooth finish.

00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:06.240
Now that I have all my sides iced, let me show you how to get it smooth.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:25.600
Dip your spatula in hot water, and smooth it very slowly.

00:03:36.960 --> 00:04:00.000
Keep dipping in the warm water until you get a smooth surface.

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:07.680
Now you are ready for the top of the cake.

00:04:20.960 --> 00:04:29.120
Just smooth from the edge of the cake to the center.

00:04:31.360 --> 00:04:38.880
Keep bringing it from the edge to the middle.

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:51.360
And there you have a frosted cake.
