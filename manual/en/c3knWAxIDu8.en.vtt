00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:03.900
Massage is actually a healthcare intervention.

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:09.650
When we apply massage and use massage with
the person things are happening in their body,

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:17.440
to their body and also on a sort of spiritual,
interpersonal level.

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:20.550
What we do with oncology massage I think is
really two-fold.

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:24.000
How do we adjust massage so that it doesn't
cause harm?

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.170
But I think when we get down to oncology massage
in that safety aspect it's really about how

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:34.960
much more can we do and how much more specifically
of service can we be to people who have been

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:36.019
affected by cancer.

00:00:36.019 --> 00:00:40.149
Okay you have these limitatinos because you've
had radiation or you've had lymph nodes removed

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:43.219
or surgery, or you're going through chemotherapy.

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:47.359
Maybe you're sitting in the infusion chair
and you're receiving some massage therapy.

00:00:47.359 --> 00:00:52.079
What can I do as a massage therapist to sort
of just sneak into what's already happening

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:55.199
with your body in a way that your body almost
doesn't know that I'm there.

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.390
That I'm just there as a sort of sneaky support
that I'm offering.

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:03.530
I sort of envision the body as jumping double
dutch rope if you've ever seen that happen

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:06.990
where you have the two ropes, and the person
who's going to jump is waiting for the hole

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:07.990
in the ropes.

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:12.009
And you jump in and you jump a couple of times
and you jump back out and the ropes keep going.

00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:16.140
And that's sort of what I think of when I'm
doing oncology massage is I connect with that

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.890
person in a way that helps me understand like
where is your nervous system, where are your

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.979
muscles, where's your mind, where is all the
vibration in your body and how can I work

00:01:24.979 --> 00:01:28.649
with you in a way that I'm not asking anything
more of your body?

00:01:28.649 --> 00:01:33.810
And then the other piece is that presence
piece that I think even massage therapists

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.140
sort of forget about.

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:38.689
And there's so many different types of massage
therapy training out there and there are short

00:01:38.689 --> 00:01:43.329
programs and long programs and programs that
focus on mechanics and then programs that

00:01:43.329 --> 00:01:46.560
focus less on mechanics and more on presence.

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.069
And when we do oncology massage it's this
beautiful marriage of understanding the mechanics

00:01:51.069 --> 00:01:57.549
and the pathophysiology of disease and treatment
and adding to it this piece that isn't coming

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:00.119
from helping but is coming more from service.

00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:05.590
Is coming more from where are you today and
how can I be as close to that place as possible

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:07.379
so that I'm not asking anything new of you?
