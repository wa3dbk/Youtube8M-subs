00:00:02.943 --> 00:00:04.377
You're honest,
you're straightforward,

00:00:04.444 --> 00:00:06.079
And you don't crack
under pressure,

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:08.114
As we all saw in an
amazing fourth quarter

00:00:08.182 --> 00:00:09.815
Against westside.

00:00:09.883 --> 00:00:11.885
All the kids
look up to you.

00:00:11.952 --> 00:00:13.819
Now, what does
that spell?

00:00:19.459 --> 00:00:20.894
Student...

00:00:20.961 --> 00:00:22.395
Council...

00:00:22.462 --> 00:00:24.130
President.

00:00:24.198 --> 00:00:25.899
Who, me?

00:00:25.966 --> 00:00:27.600
Oh, no. I...

00:00:27.902 --> 00:00:31.170
I don't know anything
about that stuff, mr. M.

00:00:31.238 --> 00:00:33.406
I mean, besides,
that's tracy flick's thing.

00:00:33.473 --> 00:00:34.857
She's always
working so hard.

00:00:34.924 --> 00:00:37.010
Yeah. She's a real
go-getter, all right.

00:00:37.077 --> 00:00:39.012
And she's super nice.

00:00:39.363 --> 00:00:40.413
Yeah, yeah,

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:42.415
But one person
assured of victory

00:00:42.482 --> 00:00:44.417
Kind of undermines
the whole idea

00:00:44.484 --> 00:00:46.035
Of democracy,
don't you think?

00:00:46.102 --> 00:00:46.953
But, mr. M--

00:00:47.021 --> 00:00:48.854
I mean, that'd be more
like a dictatorship

00:00:48.923 --> 00:00:50.356
Like we studied.

00:00:50.424 --> 00:00:51.357
But, mr. M,
there's--

00:00:51.425 --> 00:00:53.526
Paul, what's
your favorite fruit?

00:00:53.877 --> 00:00:56.029
Pears.

00:00:56.096 --> 00:00:57.863
Pears. Good. Ok.

00:00:57.932 --> 00:00:58.864
Let's say--

00:00:58.933 --> 00:01:01.034
Oh, no, wait.

00:01:01.385 --> 00:01:02.535
Apples.

00:01:02.886 --> 00:01:03.869
Apples.

00:01:03.938 --> 00:01:04.904
Fine.

00:01:04.972 --> 00:01:08.374
Let's say all you
ever knew were apples.

00:01:08.442 --> 00:01:11.377
Apples, apples,
more apples.

00:01:11.445 --> 00:01:13.379
You might think apples
were pretty good,

00:01:13.447 --> 00:01:16.382
Even if you got a rotten
one once in a while.

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:17.883
But then one day...

00:01:17.952 --> 00:01:19.385
There's an orange.

00:01:19.453 --> 00:01:21.387
And now you can
make a decision.

00:01:21.455 --> 00:01:22.888
Do you want an apple

00:01:22.957 --> 00:01:24.890
Or do you want
an orange?

00:01:24.959 --> 00:01:26.659
That's democracy.

00:01:26.961 --> 00:01:28.794
I also like bananas.

00:01:28.963 --> 00:01:29.728
[class bell rings]

00:01:29.964 --> 00:01:31.831
Exactly. Good.

00:01:31.966 --> 00:01:33.399
So what do you say?

00:01:33.467 --> 00:01:36.336
Maybe it's time to give
a little something back.

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:37.903
How's that?
