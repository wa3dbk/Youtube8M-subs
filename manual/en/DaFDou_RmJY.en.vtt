00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:04.470
Hello internet it's that time of year
again, it's a time for sled trailers.

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:05.200
And today

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.799
I'm going to talk about our all-new

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:10.399
twenty-twelve enclosed trailer lineup.

00:00:10.399 --> 00:00:14.979
As you know at Flaman Trailers we like to
bring in trailers for every sled so that

00:00:14.979 --> 00:00:18.089
means we have trailers that we consider
good, we have trailers that we consider

00:00:18.089 --> 00:00:19.949
better, and then we have our best.

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:21.970
I'm going to start my showing you

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:26.289
our Summit Series which is our 'good'
trailer.

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:29.949
If you're just starting to purchase
an enclosed sled trailer, like this is

00:00:29.949 --> 00:00:32.540
going to be your first enclosed sled
trailer,

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:38.250
the Summit Series is a great place to
start.

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.930
Treated floor,

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:45.070
white interior,

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:46.800
garment rack,

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.560
overhead cabinet.

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:53.960
This trailer is loaded up with nice features.
Tortion axles right underneath it

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:57.970
it's a great trailer to start enclosed sledding  experience.

00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:59.690
We just talked about our Summit Series

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:03.520
which is our good, steel frame, enclosed sled
trailer.

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:05.120
This, however,

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:06.830
is our aluminum solution

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:10.570
and it is a beautiful trailer smooth side

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:13.010
two-toned black and green.

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:17.290
Green i guess if you're into a certain
color of sled, but we can get them in yellow,

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:19.900
we can get them in blue, we can get them in red.

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:21.790
inside the trailer

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:24.800
nice finish white wall interior

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:26.880
i really liked the window option

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:29.260
provides natural light inside the
trailer

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:32.520
lighting up the interiors you're working
on stuff

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.230
after sledding.

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:37.440
There is a misconception though about
the floor:

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:41.650
The Advantech flooring which is what I'm
standing on is one of the most

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:42.500
robust

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:43.700
flooring

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.070
on the market today

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:50.410
it's not particle board it's actually a
fiber-resin board that stands up

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:55.930
to water and to abuse from carbines exceptionally well.

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:58.170
The XR sled low-boy.

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:02.170
Undeniably probably the best standard
trailer on the market today for sled

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:04.060
trailers.

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:08.229
I say it's a low-boy because obviously you can get it in the traditional high-boy

00:02:08.229 --> 00:02:12.719
but what we're finding a lot of
customers are liking it with this option

00:02:12.719 --> 00:02:18.319
so that they can also put in cars and
side by sides. It becomes a true

00:02:18.319 --> 00:02:21.819
Multi-seasonal toy hauler.

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:23.899
This trailer shines;

00:02:23.899 --> 00:02:27.589
white wall interior, black hard-top flooring

00:02:27.589 --> 00:02:31.579
checker plate on the trim to finish off
the unit. Standard

00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:32.790
with a window

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:34.979
and with an overhead cabinet.

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:38.790
You will not find better value on the
market place today

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:41.430
than the XR sled series.

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.189
Last but not least one of the trailers
in the enclosed line up that's

00:02:45.189 --> 00:02:50.589
asked about quite a lot is do you have a
trailer for two sleds that's enclosed.

00:02:50.589 --> 00:02:52.219
Well, we do;

00:02:52.219 --> 00:02:54.579
it's this all aluminum Rage two-up.

00:02:54.579 --> 00:02:58.299
It's a nice-looking unit dressed up with
aluminum rims,

00:02:58.299 --> 00:02:59.989
it fits any budget,

00:02:59.989 --> 00:03:04.819
very very economical, and it only weighs
thirteen hundred pounds.

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:08.919
Nothing special about the interior but if
you're just looking for a shed on wheels

00:03:08.919 --> 00:03:10.729
a looks good behind your truck

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:11.870
this fits the bill.

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:16.429
And it has a side door that's really
good for convenient access.

00:03:16.429 --> 00:03:19.169
So that's just some of our enclosed sled trailer line up

00:03:19.169 --> 00:03:21.449
look at our website for a lot more

00:03:21.449 --> 00:03:23.569
variety and options.

00:03:23.569 --> 00:03:25.679
We have ten locations

00:03:25.679 --> 00:03:27.909
Edmonton, Nisku, Lethbridge, Medicine Hat

00:03:27.909 --> 00:03:30.310
Saskatoon, Prince Albert, Southey,

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:33.299
Yorkton, Moosomin, and Swan River.

00:03:33.299 --> 00:03:35.499
