Hello! My name is Jamie Yasko-Mangum and I’m
with Successful Style and Image. Today on

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:14.130
Expert Village we’re going to talk about
the necessity of an undershirt with a business

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:24.300
shirt. Many times men feel that if they wear
an undershirt with their long sleeve stayed

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:30.090
shirt they’re going to get too hot. Well
there are certain regions in the United States

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.890
and around the world where the temperature
does get warm most of the times during the

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:43.329
year, however the undershirt will give you
greater advantages when it comes to your clothing

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:48.699
and you don’t necessarily have to worry
about the sweat. So what does an undershirt

00:00:48.699 --> 00:00:54.170
do? Well first of all let’s talk about the
different types of undershirts, when you’re

00:00:54.170 --> 00:01:01.039
dressed in an undershirt now this undershirt
goes underneath your long sleeve stayed shirt,

00:01:01.039 --> 00:01:08.830
underneath the long sleeve stayed shirt. The
undershirt should always be a crew neck, should

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:17.990
always be a crewed neck shirt not a v-neck
and not the athletic cut strapped shirt, it

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:24.750
needs to be a crew neck and it should be short
sleeve. What the undershirt does it helps

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.500
prevent perspiration in sweat, when you’re
wearing a long sleeve shirt you have this

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:35.630
underneath this will catch the sweat so that
I doesn’t appear underneath the arm pit

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:42.720
of the shirt, it will help to catch that sweat.
Number two the benefits of an undershirt it

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:50.220
will also allow your shirt to hang nicer,
you won’t get as many wrinkles as you can

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:58.940
see here on him, you don’t get as many wrinkles
in your shirt. Also it makes it look nice,

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:05.110
it makes it look like you have it’s not
sticking to your skin, it makes it look like

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:12.500
that it will it pops out. So when you’re
wearing an undershirt I know that you may

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:18.840
say I am absolutely not wearing it but think
of the negative that can happen when you’re

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:24.390
taking off your business jacket you show sweat
under your arm, your shirt is always getting

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:31.060
wrinkled, you do not want that an undershirt
is extremely necessary when you’re wearing

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:36.250
any type of long sleeve stayed shirt with
or without a jacket. Thank you.
