&gt;&gt;GOOD TO SEE YOU.

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:11.139
MALLORY.

00:00:11.139 --> 00:00:11.719
HEY!

HOW'S MY FAVORITE COUSIN?

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:13.549
&gt;&gt;HI.

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:14.709
&gt;&gt;WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

00:00:14.709 --> 00:00:16.630
&gt;&gt;OH, I'M JUST WAITING FOR MY BLIND DATE.

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:19.590
&gt;&gt;I DON'T KNOW.

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:20.680
HONESTLY, I DON'T REALLY CARE.

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:22.369
YOU KNOW I'M NOT THAT KIND OF GIRL.

00:00:22.369 --> 00:00:22.770
&gt;&gt;REALLY?

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:25.570
SO, PHYSICAL ATTRACTIVENESS DOESN'T MATTER
AT ALL TO YOU?

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:26.480
&gt;&gt;NOT TO ME.

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.980
I JUST CARE IF HE'S SENSITIVE AND CARING.

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.809
IT'S A PROVEN FACT THE UGLIER THE MAN THE

00:00:30.809 --> 00:00:34.511
BETTER HIS PERSONALITY.

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:37.540
     &gt;&gt;HELLO.

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:39.600
YOU MUST BE MALLORY.

00:00:39.609 --> 00:00:40.719
&gt;&gt;NOPE.

00:00:40.719 --> 00:00:42.949
&gt;&gt;[CLEARS THROAT]

00:00:42.949 --> 00:00:45.019
&gt;&gt;--IS WHAT I WOULD HAVE SAID

00:00:45.019 --> 00:00:47.640
IF THAT WERE NOT MY NAME, BUT I AM THE NAME

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:48.579
WHICH YOU SPEAK.

00:00:48.579 --> 00:00:50.059
WHAT'S YOUR NAME?

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:52.020
&gt;&gt;GOTHMOG.

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.660
&gt;&gt;IS THAT A FAMILY NAME?

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:56.559
&gt;&gt;NO, I DON'T HAVE A FAMILY.

00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:01.579
I WAS SPAWNED FROM THE GROUND BY AN DARK WIZARD.

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:03.259
&gt;&gt;COOLIO.

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:04.680
WHY DON'T YOU HAVE A SEAT GOTHMOG?

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:05.260
&gt;&gt;THANK YOU.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:09.100
&gt;&gt;WELL, I WILL BE ON MY WAY TO THE DESSERT
MENU.

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:09.560
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:10.200
&gt;&gt;SAVE ME.

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:10.840
&gt;&gt;FROM WHAT?

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:11.450
YOUR SOUL MATE?

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:13.130
&gt;&gt;HE IS NOT MY SOUL MATE.

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:16.000
UNLESS MY SOUL LOOKS LIKE THE INSIDE OF A
YACK.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.490
&gt;&gt;SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE JUDGING HIM BASED ON
HIS APPEARANCE.

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:19.240
DIDN'T YOU JUST SAY--?

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:19.780
&gt;&gt;I KNOW WHAT I SAID.

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:21.719
AND I KNOW THAT BEAUTY IS ONLY SKIN DEEP,

00:01:21.719 --> 00:01:24.070
BUT THAT UGLY GOES DOWN TO HIS CRIPPLED BONES.

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:25.799
&gt;&gt;DID YOU JUST SAY CRIPPLED BONES?

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:28.059
I'M SORRY. I AM REALLY STRESSED OUT, OKAY.

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:29.360
BUT HE HAS GOT TO BE EVIL RIGHT?

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.320
I MEAN, HE'S PROBABLY GOING TO ORDER A HOBBIT.

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.800
&gt;&gt;CAN I GET A VEGAN MENU PLEASE?

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:35.460
&gt;&gt;I'LL BE RIGHT BACK WITH THAT.

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:36.360
&gt;&gt;THANK YOU.

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.760
&gt;&gt;UH, SO, GOTHMOG, WHAT'S THE PLAN

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:40.960
FOR AFTER DINNER?

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.680
&gt;&gt;WE WILL SATIATE MY UNQUENCHABLE THIRST--

00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:45.560
&gt;&gt;FOR BLOOD?

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:46.640
&gt;&gt;NO, FOR SERVICE.

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:48.119
&gt;&gt;FOR SERVICE BLOOD?

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:50.899
&gt;&gt;NO, JUST SERVICE AT A SOUP KITCHEN.

00:01:50.899 --> 00:01:52.409
WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU?

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:53.609
&gt;&gt;SHE'S AN ONLY CHILD.

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:54.259
&gt;&gt;OH.

00:01:54.259 --> 00:01:55.770
&gt;&gt;I'M NOT BEING UNREASONABLE.

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:58.979
THERE IS NO ONE ALIVE WHO WOULD DATE THIS
MAN.

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:00.109
&gt;&gt;GOTHMOG?

00:02:00.109 --> 00:02:02.200
TAKE ME BACK I BEG YOU.

00:02:02.200 --> 00:02:06.399
&gt;&gt;I'M SORRY TO TELL YOU BUT I NEEDED MORE
OF AN

00:02:06.399 --> 00:02:07.509
EMOTIONAL CONNECTION.

00:02:07.509 --> 00:02:12.390
I CAN'T JUST BE YOUR ARM CANDY THAT YOU PRANCE
AROUND

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:14.640
LIKE A BEAUTIFUL SHOW PONY.

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.140
&gt;&gt;I WAS A FOOL GOTHMOG.

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:26.420
&gt;&gt;YOU KNOW I ONLY KISS IF I'M IN A COMMITTED
RELATIONSHIP.

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.930
&gt;&gt;I NEVER DESERVED YOU.

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:31.170
&gt;&gt;GO.

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.140
&gt;&gt;THIS SEAT IS AVAILABLE AND I DON'T REQUIRE
AN

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.010
EMOTIONAL CONNECTION.

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:39.290
&gt;&gt;OKAY, FIRST OF ALL, WHAT?

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:41.760
AND SECOND, YEAH, HE'S GREAT,

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:45.530
BUT MY DAD HATES ORGANIC FOOD-EATERS AND ORCS.

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:46.670
&gt;&gt;ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:47.420
&gt;&gt;DAD?

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:49.000
&gt;&gt;NOTHING WOULD MAKE ME MORE PROUD THAN TO

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:51.030
CALL GOTHMOG MY SON.

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:52.830
&gt;&gt;DAD, WHY ARE YOU HERE?

00:02:52.830 --> 00:02:55.019
&gt;&gt;DO NOT BLOW THIS MALLORY.

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:57.470
YOU WILL NEVER DO BETTER THAN GOTHMOG.

00:02:57.470 --> 00:02:59.810
&gt;&gt;DON'T MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE I DID.

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:00.970
&gt;&gt;MARRY HIM.

00:03:00.970 --> 00:03:04.519
AND MAY YOUR CHILDREN HAVE THE PERSONALITY
OF GOTHMOG AND

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:07.770
THE LOOKS OF ALSO GOTHMOG.

00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:10.740
&gt;&gt;WHAT'S YOUR EXCUSE NOW?

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:11.939
&gt;&gt;OKAY, LOOK, I'M NOT SHALLOW.

00:03:11.939 --> 00:03:12.579
OKAY?

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:13.980
I'M A GOOD PERSON.

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:18.340
&gt;&gt;WOULD ANYONE LIKE TO SEE ME SHOOT A DWARF
KID WITH AN ARROW?

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:22.100
IT'S FUNNY BECAUSE THEY'RE UGLY INSTEAD OF
HOT LIKE ME.

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:26.900
 &gt;&gt;OH BOO!

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:28.040
&gt;&gt;COME ON GUYS!

00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:28.880
IT'S LEGOLAS!

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:31.520
  HIS HAIR IS LIKE BETTER THAN MINE.

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:34.660
&gt;&gt;A RED SUN RISES.

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:37.780
&gt;&gt;GOTHMOG, LET ME ADOPT YOU.

00:03:59.439 --> 00:04:00.269
