00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:06.689
When people ring your door chime, can you
hear it from every room in your home?

00:00:06.689 --> 00:00:10.570
Do you have a broken door chime or none at
all?

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:15.389
Do you wish you could be alerted every time
someone opened the front door to your workplace?

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:20.340
In any of these situations, Carlon Wireless
Door Chime Systems offers a quick, convenient

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:21.340
solution.

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:25.570
Carlon, one of the Thomas and Betts' many
industry leading brand names, is the innovator

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:31.000

Carlon offers several different battery-operated
and plug-in systems to choose from, all with

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:37.580
CD quality sound.

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:41.410
Carlon Wireless Door Chimes have an exclusive
scrolling button feature that lets you select

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:44.020
from multiple musical tones with the push
of a button.

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:46.470
So you can change your tune whenever you like.

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:50.360
The Economy Wireless Chimes allow you to select
different sounds for front and back-doors

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.730
while other models that you choose from up
to 13 different tunes including the Westminster

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:58.260

Bells.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.620
Carlon Wireless Door Chimes include 32 selectable
codes to prevent interference from outside

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:03.620
signals.

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:07.200
If you need to add an extra button for your
backdoor or an additional entrance, extra

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.640
battery-operated buttons are sold separately.

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:14.420
Carlon Wireless Door Chime systems are cross-compatible
so you can use different models together to

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:18.070
build a customized door chime system that's
perfect for your home.

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:21.560
Here's a closer look at some of the different
Carlon Wireless Door Chime models.

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.810
If you want to install a new door chime in
a home, apartment or RV or if you're looking

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:30.600
to replace a broken doorbell or buzzer, Carlon's
Basic Battery-Operated Wireless Chime is a

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.060
convenient economical solution.

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.060
Just mount the button in the desired location
then insert three double-A batteries in the

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:41.400
chime unit and mount it anywhere within the
75-foot operating range.

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.909
This model allows you to select different
sounds for front and backdoors and since it's

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:48.080
battery-operated, you don't need to use up
any outlets.

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:50.729
It comes with a one-year manufacturer's warranty.

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:56.100
Another option is the Carlon Long-Range Battery-Operated
Wireless Door Chime with an extended 300-foot

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:01.119
operating range, ideal when you need to place
the chime unit far away from the front door.

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:05.630
This model features 13 different chime options,
adjustable volume control and high intensity

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:13.470
LED lights that flash as the tune plays, a
helpful feature for the hearing-impaired or

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.330
for using in places with elevated noise levels.

00:02:16.330 --> 00:02:21.580
Another great feature on this model is the
spoken low battery alert.

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:25.599
When the batteries run low in either the chime
or the button, the unit will speak to you

00:02:25.599 --> 00:02:29.240
literally to let you know it's time to change
the batteries.

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:30.480
Installation is quick and easy.

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.629
Just mount the button in the desired location
then insert four D cell batteries into the

00:02:34.629 --> 00:02:38.510
chime units and mount it anywhere within 300
feet of the button.

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:42.630
The Long Range Wireless Door Chime comes with
a five-year warranty.

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:46.950
Carlon also offers a battery-operated, weatherproof
wireless chime that you can use indoors or

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:47.950
out.

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:51.590
It's ideal for new installations or for replacing
a broken door chime.

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:56.020
Features include 13 different chime options,
adjustable volume control and an audible low

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:57.599
battery alert.

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:01.680
Mount the button in the desired location,
then insert four C cell batteries in the chime

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:06.250
units and mount it anywhere you like, indoors
or out within 150 feet.

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:09.100
Mount it on the back of your house and you
will be able to hear visitors arrive when

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:10.480
you're in the backyard.

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:14.300
The Weatherproof Wireless Chime System comes
with a one-year warranty.

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:18.330
Carlon offers plug-in wireless chime systems
as well as battery-operated models.

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:21.690
There's even a model with an integrated night
light, if you want to plug in a door chime

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:23.910
and a night light in the same spot.

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:28.060
Now you can hear visitors arrive and improve
nighttime visibility with a single plug-in

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:29.060
unit.

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.800
This model is great for new installations
or for replacing a broken door chime.

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:37.349
Features include 13 different chime options,
adjustable volume control and an extended

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:39.720
250-foot operating range.

00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:43.599
Just mount the button with the included screws
or double-sided tape then plug in the chime

00:03:43.599 --> 00:03:45.800
unit wherever you need a little extra light.

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:48.260
This unit comes with a two-year warranty.

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:53.090
Then there's Carlon's Extended Chime, a plug-in
wireless chime you can use to enhance an existing

00:03:53.090 --> 00:03:54.909
wired chime system.

00:03:54.909 --> 00:03:58.740
This is a great solution if there's a remote
area in your home or you just can't hear the

00:03:58.740 --> 00:03:59.930
door chime.

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:04.670
The extended chime has six different sound
options along with adjustable volume control.

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:09.159
This one does require minimal wiring but it's
quick, safe and very easy to do.

00:04:09.159 --> 00:04:13.340
Just mount the transmitter inside or on the
existing wired door chime unit with the included

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:14.680
double-sided tape.

00:04:14.680 --> 00:04:18.470
Turn off the power and connect the wires to
the low voltage screws in the existing door

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:19.489
chime.

00:04:19.489 --> 00:04:20.919
Turn the power back on.

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:25.000
Then plug the extended chime into any outlet
within 150 feet.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.900
When you press the existing door chime, the
door chime and the extended chime unit will

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:30.159
both sound.

00:04:30.159 --> 00:04:33.280
The extended chime comes with a two-year warranty.

00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:36.949
If you're looking for a way to announce visitors
at your office or business, choose Carlon's

00:04:36.949 --> 00:04:39.490
Wireless Plug-in Entrance Alert System.

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:42.580
This product is also helpful for child safety
purposes.

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:46.409
You attach this system to the door itself
and it sounds a chime or an alarm whenever

00:04:46.409 --> 00:04:47.960
someone opens the door.

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:51.729
The entrance alert features eight different
chime options plus the alarm sound along with

00:04:51.729 --> 00:04:54.220
adjustable volume control.

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:55.220
Installation is easy.

00:04:55.220 --> 00:04:57.520
Just attach the transmitter to the door jam.

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:58.960
Attach the magnet to the door.

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:02.460
Then plug the door chime unit into any outlet
within 150 feet.

00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:05.259

00:05:05.259 --> 00:05:09.340

range of wired door chime systems including
the innovative Record-A-Chime System.

00:05:13.879 --> 00:05:17.369
Now when someone rings your door chime, you
can hear your favorite song.

00:05:17.369 --> 00:05:21.520
Just record this song using the internal microphone
or plug the included microphone chord into

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:22.520
your computer.

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:25.639
This system is great for new or replacement
installation.

00:05:25.639 --> 00:05:30.469
It works with up to three doors, can be battery
or transformer operated and comes with a one-year

00:05:30.469 --> 00:05:31.610
warranty.

00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:35.710
If your wired door chime, bell or buzzer isn't
working anymore or if you just want to add

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:40.409
a decorator touch to your front door, look
for Carlon wired buttons in a variety of styles

00:05:40.409 --> 00:05:45.599
and finishes including satin nickel, brass,
copper and oil-rubbed bronze.

00:05:45.599 --> 00:05:48.449

visibility.
