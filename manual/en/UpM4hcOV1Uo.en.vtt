00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:07.990
The Princess Leia comic has come to an end.

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:13.090
So let’s take a look back at every easter
egg and reference in every issue!

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:17.330
The series begins immediately after the credits
roll in Episode IV.

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:20.010
Not a major secret, but hey it’s a reference.

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.940
Shortly after we see an Alderaanian memorial
of Bail and Breha Organa.

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:28.339
Which makes me wonder who carved it so quickly?

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:34.090
We saw Ackbar in the Clone Wars, but this
comic is the earliest piece of the timeline

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:39.149
so far that we see him as a part of the Rebel
Alliance.

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:44.570
General Dodonna has to stop himself from calling
Leia a Senator, as the Emperor had completely

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:47.660
removed the Senate during Episode IV.

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:52.829
When Leia asks Artoo what he thinks about
her mission, he responds in Aurebesh, that

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:56.590
translates to “I’ve got a bad feeling
about this.”

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:59.969
Wedge makes a quick appearance chasing Leia’s
shuttle with Luke.

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.969
They continue to call each other by their
Red Squadron callsigns.

00:01:03.969 --> 00:01:07.990
During a flashback to Leia’s childhood,
Bail Organa mentions that soldiers no longer

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:12.920
exist on Alderaan, a callback to Leia’s
protest to Grand Moff Tarking that Alderaan

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:17.909
is peaceful and has no weapons
Leia and Evaan travel to Naboo to save some

00:01:17.909 --> 00:01:23.070
Alderaanians, and Evaan reminds us that the
Emperor was from Naboo

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.920
Leia goes by the name Solo on Naboo.

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.299
Perhaps in her mind she’s already writing
Mrs. Han Solo over and over in her Trapper

00:01:30.299 --> 00:01:31.299
Keeper…

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:36.520
Also, Evaan is wearing the same type of jacket
Luke wears during the medal ceremony.

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:40.140
Maybe it’s standard issue for Rebels, or
just a popular designer.

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.719
Leia is drawn to a stained glass representation
of her birth mother.

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:48.799
Lord Junn exclaims Shiraya’s Word when he
sees Leia.

00:01:48.799 --> 00:01:51.570
Shiraya was a goddess worshipped on Naboo.

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:56.720
Some of Queen Amidala’s headdresses were
worn in honor of Shiraya.

00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:02.229
The ship the Lord Junn is very similar in
design to the other Nubian ships we’ve seen

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:06.070
Nien Nunb makes his first new-canon appearance.

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:08.820
He was helping the Rebellion long before Episode
VI.

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:13.800
And he is given Leia’s necklace from the
medal ceremony as a thank you from Leia.

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.569
It’s also established that the Sullustans
are notorious smugglers, a fact that was set

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:23.260
up in Legends material
Leia laments that she never had a sibling,

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:26.290
foreshadowing her relationship with Luke.

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:28.133
This frame is very reminiscent of “Help
me Obi-Wan Kenobi.”

00:02:28.133 --> 00:02:30.019
Leia meets with the Imperials on a new desert
planet called Skaradosh.

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:32.590
With Tatooine and Jakku, the galaxy is starting
to become full of desert planets.

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:37.459
After saving her people, Leia gives up her
position as Princess of Alderaan so she can

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:42.090
rejoin the Rebellion, and a new Princess is
elected.

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:46.730
This casts a new light on some of Han and
Leia’s banter in Empire when she demands

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:51.300
Han stop calling her things like your highness
or your worshipfulness.

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:55.630
Leia heads back to the Rebellion, which is
still located on Yavin IV.

00:02:55.630 --> 00:02:59.690
It seems the Empire is taking their sweet
time retaliating.

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:04.599
As Leia returns to the Rebellion, she is dressed
in the same clothes she wears in the Empire

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:05.599
Strikes Back.

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:07.819
That’s all the easter eggs I spotted!

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:09.000
Did I miss any?

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.310
