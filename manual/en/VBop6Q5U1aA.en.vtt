00:00:15.666 --> 00:00:21.999
Dashboards are powerful new features of the PeopleSoft user experience that make using PeopleSoft more efficient 

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.533
and engaging for users.  Many dashboards were delivered out-of-the-box with PeopleSoft 9.2 applications. 

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:36.000
The framework for building these products is part of PeopleTools, which means customers have the ability to modify delivered instances or 

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.866
create their own dashboards to support unique enterprise requirements.

00:00:40.633 --> 00:00:45.433
In addition, dashboards work well on mobile devices like tablets or phones, 

00:00:45.433 --> 00:00:49.266
and many of the activities users perform are suitable for mobile work.

00:00:50.033 --> 00:00:54.833
You might wonder what the difference is between Dashboards and the PeopleSoft Interaction Hub. 

00:00:54.833 --> 00:01:01.199
One difference is that the Interaction Hub is used to convey information to a broad enterprise audience. 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:06.833
It’s also used for common and less frequently performed activities, like benefits enrollment or onboarding, 

00:01:06.833 --> 00:01:11.366
while Dashboards are designed for specific roles and peoples’ day-to-day work.

00:01:11.966 --> 00:01:18.766
Use Manage Dashboard Pages to edit existing dashboards or create new ones--a straightforward process that doesn’t require 

00:01:18.766 --> 00:01:26.266
coding or Application Designer. In most cases, subject matter experts can create a new dashboard in just a few minutes.

00:01:26.766 --> 00:01:31.766
In this example, we’re going to create a new dashboard using the Create New Dashboard link.

00:01:32.733 --> 00:01:39.599
Let’s call our dashboard Manage My Team. The label content is what appears to users.

00:01:41.133 --> 00:01:44.966
Enter a name in the Parent Folder field.

00:01:47.466 --> 00:01:55.266
For the purposes of this demonstration, we’re choosing Public Access security, but typically you’d apply PeopleSoft’s role-based security 

00:01:55.266 --> 00:02:01.032
so that only persons in the designated role would have access to this dashboard and its information.

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:08.900
When you click Save, the Manager Dashboard Pages appears listing the dashboards in the system, including the one you just created.

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:15.733
Use the Pagelets button to add pagelets to provide useful information for the role specified for this dashboard.

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:24.533
The dashboard framework enables you to include content from a variety of sources, so you’re not limited to the application 

00:02:24.533 --> 00:02:33.299
in which the dashboard resides. For example, you might bring in content pagelets from HCM, Financials, Enterprise Learning, and more; 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.933
whatever is needed by persons in this role.

00:02:36.333 --> 00:02:43.566
Or use the PeopleTools pagelet wizard to create any type of content you require and then add it to the dashboard you’re creating.

00:02:43.866 --> 00:02:49.999
Now we'll add lots of useful pagelets to our new dashboard. Choose from a variety of content types. 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.233
Also remember that these pagelets are available from a variety of content providers.

00:02:58.866 --> 00:03:07.866
You have several options for the layout of your dashboard. If it’s likely to be used on a tablet, you might choose a two-column layout as this is 

00:03:07.866 --> 00:03:11.966
a little easier for people to use in a touch-first user interface.

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:19.500
If it’s more likely to be used in a laptop browser, you might choose a three-column layout to display more information. 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:23.733
These are just guidelines--the dashboard will work well in either configuration.

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:29.733
Arrange your pagelets so they’re visually balanced, with related pagelets close to each other. 

00:03:30.033 --> 00:03:34.799
Place frequently used pagelets at the top as a convenience for your users.

00:03:37.266 --> 00:03:44.399
The new dashboard is ready to go. Let’s return to the Interaction Hub where you can see your new dashboard appears as a tab.

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:54.066
Use the Interaction Hub and Dashboards in a complementary fashion, with the Interaction Hub serving as a launch pad for a variety of activities.  

00:03:54.066 --> 00:04:00.699
For example, after completing a self-service task like reviewing a paycheck in the Interaction Hub, 

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:05.400
you can open your new Manage My Team dashboard and get down to your daily work.

00:04:06.966 --> 00:04:15.632
Your users can rearrange pagelets to suit their needs. Or enable subject matter experts with the capability to add their own pagelets.

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:26.933
Use the fully interactive pagelets to perform your daily tasks. For example, perform a related action in the Instructor Center, open a blog post, 

00:04:26.933 --> 00:04:29.266
or respond to a poll.

00:04:30.366 --> 00:04:37.299
Personalize your dashboard with the pagelets and content you need with related actions that enable you to work more efficiently 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:43.233
whether you’re in the office or on the go with your mobile devices. With the PeopleTools dashboard framework, 

00:04:43.233 --> 00:04:48.866
create operational dashboards quickly and easily for any role or purpose your enterprise needs.
