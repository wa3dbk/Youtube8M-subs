00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
In the land of Israel, the winter season is the only time it rains

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
And that year, there was no rain.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.000
I'm so thirsty, we haven't had water in weeks

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
I'm so hungry, and my crops are dead.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
What should we do?

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Let's ask Honi the Circle Maker for help!

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:31.000
What can I do ya for?

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.000
There's no rain

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Our trees won't grow.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Stop kvetching. I know what to do.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
I'm going....to pray.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Hey God! These people really need the rain.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Please, send us some!

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
How's it going?

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Nothing yet.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Hello God? These people really need the rain.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.000
We depend on it for everything.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:12.000
It waters the plants. It makes the trees grow. 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.000
And the trees give us shelter, wood, nuts, and fruit.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
And, uh, the people aren't taking many showers lately.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Show some respect, that's God you're talking to!

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000
He is going to get sooooo skewered.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
And still nothing!

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000
(bulging sound, light rain sound)

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Come on God! I'm not leaving this circle until it really rains!

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.000
(thunderstorm sound)

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Whoa!

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000
(popping sounds, Honi singing)

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
Nice job, God. You rock.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
Most people talk to God with respect.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000
But it's like they're talking to their dentist.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Honi and God talk like they're best friends.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Okay, boss. Gotta go. (boing sound)

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
What are you doing?

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
I'm planting a carob tree.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
Why bother? That's going to take forever.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
70 years, actually.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Exactly. You won't even be around to taste it.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Maybe I won't, but my grandparents planted carob trees for me

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000
So I'm planting trees for the next generation to come.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000
Oooooookay.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000
That could have been the end of the story.

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.000
But it isn't.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.000
For then, as the rabbis tell it

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000
Honi fell asleep for 70 years.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.000
Hey!

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000
(yawn)

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Did you plant that tree?

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.000
My grandparents did!

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000
Is the son of Honi the Circlemaker still around?

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
No, but I'm his grandson.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:03.000
You look a little wiped out.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
Here, snack on some carob.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.000
RENEW.

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
Happy new year of the trees!
