00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:27.850
Compared to dogs, there aren't many
charities that seem to do that much for

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:32.720
cats, so Cats Protection's got a real
niche there and they make a massive difference.

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:39.260
Oh, if Charley won today – it
would be... I can't tell you, I can't describe it,

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.140
it would be amazing!

00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:56.539
Welcome to Cats Protection's National Cat
Awards. This is the sixth time Cats

00:00:56.539 --> 00:01:00.890
Protection has run this event and once
again, they were bowled over by the

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:05.660
quality of entries that highlighted many
tales of bravery, friendship and fun.

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:09.890
We begin the awards then, ladies and
gentlemen, with the Best Friends category,

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:14.360
which celebrates those cats that have
shown a remarkable bond with their

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:18.950
owners. Cats have an amazing ability, as
we know, to help people. Whether it's

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:24.220
building confidence, recovering from
illness or easing loneliness and depression.

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:27.580
Please welcome Rick Wakeman to the stage!

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:32.960
I tell you what, we've got

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:37.369
three rescue cats – three Cats Protection cats –
and it's interesting because when you

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:40.340
adopt them, you actually realise when you
get them home that you actually haven't

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:43.940
adopted them, because they end up
adopting you and they run your entire life.

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:47.780
And the winner is: Jessi-Cat!

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.460
Ladies and gentlemen, we come to the Hero Cat
category, dedicated to cats that

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:09.580
perform courageous or heroic feats or
quite literally save the day.

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:12.740
Please welcome to the stage: Lucy Pinder!

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.980
Our winner is: Charley!

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:33.800
On to the next award – the Most Incredible
Story category celebrates belief-defying

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:37.010
true stories, ladies and gentlemen, from the
cat world which demonstrate the

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:41.330
contribution that cats make to the
incredible diversity of life. And here to

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:44.600
present the award: Ed Burn, ladies and gentleman!

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:55.670
I think this is a tough category, in all fairness,
but the winner is: William! So accepting the

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:58.740
award for William is his owner, Debra Terry.

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:09.740
We move on now, ladies and gentleman, to the
Outstanding Rescue Cat category which

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:15.630
celebrates cats who've triumphed to become
fabulous feline companions, following a

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:21.100
difficult start to life, if you like.
Would you please welcome to the stage: Jan Leeming!

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:29.627
It was incredibly difficult to choose it, it always is. But there has to be a winner

00:03:29.627 --> 00:03:33.140
and that's got to be: Phoenix!

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:52.110
Well next, a new award for this year – the
Celebrity Cat category that we heard

00:03:52.110 --> 00:03:56.750
about earlier, which recognises both real
and fictional cats in the public eye.

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:01.740
Finalists were nominated by the public
and over 5,000 people logged on to Cats

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:05.370
Protection's Facebook page to select
their winner. Would you please welcome to

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.500
the stage: Bryony Gordon!

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:15.440
And the winner of the Celebrity Cat of the year is:

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:18.120
Simon's Cat!

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:35.240
Well now on to, ladies and gentlemen, our final
award – the National Cat of the Year 2012.

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:40.880
Here to announce the overall winner is Cats Protection's Chief Executive: Peter Hepburn.

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:53.840
This year's National Cat of the Year is: Jessi-Cat.

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:59.860
Jayne and Lorcan, come on back!

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:18.230
It's lovely – it's a smiley atmosphere. It's
people... you know, I've never met anybody

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:22.520
who doesn't like cats, who doesn't smile.
You don't meet miserable people who like

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:27.820
cats, you don't meet boring people who
like cats. People who've got cats tend to be

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:31.460
contented, they tend to... you know,
we've all got problems in our lives

00:05:31.460 --> 00:05:34.160
but they just tend to be much happier
when a cat's around.

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:39.410
It's been a fantastic atmosphere. It's lovely, it's
very relaxed, very nice people, very

00:05:39.410 --> 00:05:44.960
disparate selection of folk – a broad
spectrum of individuals. Just liking a

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:48.340
cat is something that brings a lot of
different folk together.

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:54.420
Oh, yeah I've loved it. I can bore people to
tears talking about cats, so it's been great!

00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:59.860
We're just shocked! It was a big shock
to win the first one and then when they

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:04.580
announced Jessi-Cat for the final, I just
could not believe it! Which is fantastic.

00:06:04.580 --> 00:06:06.520
Really, really nice.

00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:10.070
I think it's just
been so lovely. There've been wonderful

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:15.940
people here, fabulous stories and of
course at the heart of it – amazing cats.

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:19.700
And everyone's just so happy, isn't it lovely?
