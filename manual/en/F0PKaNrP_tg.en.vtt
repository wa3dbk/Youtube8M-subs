Hi, this is Elise McMahon for ExpertVillage.com.
And, in this video series, we're teaching

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:10.380
our dogs a reliable recall. If you'd like
to find out more about my services, you can

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:16.670
visit my website at canineheadstart.com. So,
in this video clip, we're going to be talking

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:22.551
about introducing distractions to your recall
games. Again, we're going to be working with

00:00:22.551 --> 00:00:27.241
Sue and Teddy. And, the distraction I'm going
to, I'm going to cause the distraction, the

00:00:27.241 --> 00:00:31.369
distraction is that I'm going to go over there
and open the door right when she's asking

00:00:31.369 --> 00:00:36.269
Teddy to come to her. If Teddy comes right
away ignoring the distraction, he's going

00:00:36.269 --> 00:00:40.949
to get reinforcements. If he hesitates to
look at the distraction or if he goes towards

00:00:40.949 --> 00:00:46.449
the distraction, Sue is going to go to her
plan B. And, in this case, Sue's plan B is

00:00:46.449 --> 00:00:51.030
to talk to Teddy's imaginary, well it's a
real roommate, but she won't really be here.

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.679
But, she's going to be talking to Bergie,
who's not really there, and giving Bergie

00:00:55.679 --> 00:01:00.249
lots of love and lots of cookies. And then,
when Teddy comes, she's going to remark and

00:01:00.249 --> 00:01:04.479
reward him for having come to her. So, first,
we going to have Sue put Teddy in a stay over

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:25.460
here. Come. Come. Come. Come. Come. Sit. Stay.
Stay. And, when Sue's ready to do the recall,

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:34.680
I'm going to open the door. So, you can just
step back from him. And, go ahead and call

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:45.860
him. Teddy, come. Good boy. Good job, Teddy.
Good job. Good job. So, there's two possible

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:50.159
scenarios there. The dog can come to you and
ignore the distractions. And, if that happens,

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:55.991
you know that you're working within the dog's
level of ability to work with that level of

00:01:55.991 --> 00:02:00.320
distraction. In which, in Teddy's case opening
the door was. And, you can imagine other kinds

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.780
of distractions you could use other dogs and
other people. To start with, you want to use

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:09.440
low level distractions. A door opening is
a fairly low level distraction. So, Teddy

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.430
did a good job there, and we'll work with
him some more in the next video.
