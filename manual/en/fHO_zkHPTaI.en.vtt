00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:15.000
TODAY, THE WORLD HOLDS 7 BILLION PEOPLE. WITHIN THE NEXT FIFTY YEARS, THAT NUMBER MAY CLIMB TO 9 BILLION.  

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:23.000
THE NEED TO MAKE EXISTING CITIES MORE ENERGY EFFICIENT AND TO BUILD NEW SUSTAINABLE CITIES IS ON THE RISE.

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:30.000
ACROSS THE GLOBE DEVELOPERS ARE BUILDING SMART CITIES OFFERING HIGH QUALITY ECO-FRIENDLY LIVING.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:38.000
ONE OF THE MOST AMBITIOUS IS SOUTH KOREA’S $35 BILLION DOLLAR SONGDO INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS DISTRICT.

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:56.000
SOUTH KOREA IS ONE OF THE WORLD'S MOST DENSELY POPULATED COUNTRIES.WHEN THE SONGDO PROJECT BEGAN IN 2001, THERE WAS NO AVAILABLE LAND TO BUILD IT. 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:11.000
1500 ACRES HAD TO BE RECLAIMED FROM THE SEA.TODAY, SOME OF WORLD’S BEST PLANNERS, ARCHITECTS, BUILDERS AND TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES ARE CREATING SONGDO FROM THE GROUND UP.  

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:19.000
BY 2016, MORE THAN 400 NEW BUILDINGS WILL STAND, INCLUDING SOUTH KOREA’S TALLEST SKYSCRAPER.

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:25.000
[STAN GALE] We took an approach that has the best elements from some of the finest cities in the world.  

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:43.500
40% of the space is open space. You can leave your car at home and you can walk to central park, you can walk your child to school, you can visit an office or a retail shopping center, you can go to the golf course, all within walking distance. 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:15.000
[SCOTT SUMMERS] The design of the buildings is something you don't see anywhere here in Korea and we've got state-of-the-art technology going into our buildings.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:27.500
[JEAN-LOUIS MASSAUT] The network that we deploy here is actually connecting all of the components in the city. You know, all of the residences, offices, schools everywhere, all of the buildings.

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:40.000
IN THIS NETWORKED COMMUNITY, RESIDENTS WILL BE ABLE TO CONTROL THE FUNCTIONS OF THEIR HOMES REMOTELY AND EVERYONE WILL BE ABLE TO INTERACT THROUGH VIDEO FROM ANYWHERE. 

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:46.000
NEW AND OLD TECHNOLOGY WORKING TOGETHER WILL CREATE A TRULY SUSTAINABLE CITY.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:03:00.000
[Peter Lee] We didn’t just look 10 years ahead; we looked 50, 100 years from now. If the city achieves half the things that we planned from the start, the quality of life will be unmatched.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:19.000
[STAN GALE] Songdo is being studied by many countries, many mayors, many governors as an example of a Smart and Connected Community and a more efficient way of organizing urban living.We’re hoping we contribute to the global footprint in a positive way.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000
SONGDO IS ONE OF MORE THAN 100 SMART CITY PROJECTS UNDERWAY WORLDWIDE.
