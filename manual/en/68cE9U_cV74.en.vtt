00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:11.830
Cars old and new have many engineering features
and technologies to make automobile travel

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:18.110
safer but the choices we make getting behind
the wheel are critical in getting you, your

00:00:18.110 --> 00:00:23.369
family and friends safely to a destination
long or short.

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:26.050
Tip number one: Don’t drink and drive

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:30.399
It’s so obvious, but people still do it.

00:00:30.399 --> 00:00:35.800
That’s why more than more than 30 percent
of all car deaths involve drivers impaired

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.270
by alcohol.

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:39.579
Don’t do it!

00:00:39.579 --> 00:00:43.280
Tip number two: Don’t medicate and drive

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:49.350
It’s not just alcohol that impairs your
driving skills; prescription drugs, or even

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.000
too much over the counter cold or allergy
meds can affect your motor skills.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.440
If you are not sure – again, don’t do
it!

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:02.210
Tip number three: Speed kills

00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:07.310
Speed is the contributing factor in about
30 percent of all fatal crashes.

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:08.979
It’s not worth it.

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:12.330
Take your need for speed to the track!

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.800
Tip number four: Avoid distractions

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:17.720
You know what’s distracting.

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:24.500
Cell phone use, texting, applying make-up,
loud music or anything else that takes your

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.770
hands off the wheel or your eyes off the road.

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:33.330
Just wait until you turn off the motor before
doing any of that stuff.

00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:36.990
It takes your full time attention to drive
safely.

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.570
Tip number five: Don’t drive drowsy

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:47.070
Here’s the wakeup call: 20 percent of all
accidents happen because of sleepy drivers.

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:50.030
Hello, that’s why we have beds.

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:51.250
Use them.

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:55.230
Get proper rest before you get behind the
wheel.

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:58.170
These are our top five that will keep you
alive.

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.450
Safe travels everyone!
