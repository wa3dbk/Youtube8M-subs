In this episode we’re gonna be talking
about

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:13.900
ISO values and how to use them. Adorama TV presents Exploring Photography

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:17.940
with Mark Wallace. Where you'll learn
innovative techniques

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:21.550
on shooting a wide range of photography.
Here's your host.

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:25.430
Hi everybody, welcome to another episode of Exploring Photography, right here on

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:27.210
Adorama TV brought to you by

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:30.980
Adorama. It’s the camera store that has
everything for photographers like

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:35.340
you and me. Well if you’ve been shooting for a while
you know that there's the exposure

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:36.880
triangle that’s made up of the shutter,

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:41.320
the aperture and ISO, and we know that we can
use the shutter to control motion and the

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.239
aperture to control depth of field, but

00:00:43.239 --> 00:00:46.730
in all of our discussions somehow ISO seems to be left out.

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:51.020
So in this episode we're gonna talk
about ISO, what it is, how you use it,

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:52.899
which settings to use and

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:57.309
why sometimes having a really high ISO
value isn't such a bad thing.

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:01.120
But before we get into all that I want
to remind you that Adorama has some

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:02.649
terrific contests.

00:01:02.649 --> 00:01:06.130
If you enter the contest you could win some great prizes. So click on the link

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:11.640
and check them out. ISO determines how
sensitive your camera is to light.

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.979
The higher the ISO value the less light
you'll need to take a photo

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:19.400
let's take a look at this animation and
see exactly how this works.

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.920
Let's say we have a room that's lit with
128

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:28.180
lightbulbs. Let's also pretend that we
have a proper exposure at ISO 100

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:32.470
shooting f2.8 and a shutter speed of
sixty.

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:36.329
Remember I'm just making up these values
to illustrate a point.

00:01:36.329 --> 00:01:40.430
At ISO 200 we can get the same result
with only

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:44.140
64 lightbulbs. At ISO 400

00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:47.180
we'd only need 32 light bulbs. At ISO

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.280
800 that number would fall to 16

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.500
lights. Each time we double our ISO value

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:57.630
we only need half as much light. So ISO
1600

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:01.030
would only need 8 lights. If we double
our ISO

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:04.180
again we can half the amount of light
that we need.

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:08.590
ISO 3,200 four lights. ISO 6,400

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:14.340
two lights, and at ISO 12,800 we'd only
need one light bulb,

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:19.090
and we can still shoot f2.8 and 1/60 of a
second.

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:24.280
That is a huge difference from 128
lights at ISO 100

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.230
to just one little light at ISO 12800.

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:31.920
Alright so the question is why wouldn't
you always have your ISO set to a high

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.269
ISO value?

00:02:33.269 --> 00:02:36.620
Well the answer is noise. Noise is

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:40.140
sort of hard to explain but its easy to
see so let's take a look.

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:44.760
Here's an image shot at ISO 100 now
notice everything looks clean

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:50.500
now here's the same image shot at ISO
12800 you can see the grain in this

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:50.970
image,

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:54.560
and that grain is called noise. Noise is
the trade-off.

00:02:54.560 --> 00:03:00.030
Higher ISO values have more noise. Well
in the past photographers have always

00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:04.400
been told to keep their ISO values as low
as possible to get noise-free

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:07.760
images. We still want to do that today but
the good news is

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.629
that there have been huge technological
advances with digital cameras.

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:15.580
Now there are all kinds of camera's
that can shoot at ISO 3200 an even

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:16.280
higher.

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:19.790
In fact I think that the groundbreaking
camera was the Nikon D3X

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:24.159
and then along came there 5D Mark III
from Canon and then the floodgates were

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:24.680
opened.

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:28.220
Now there are all kinds of cameras that
can shoot at high ISO's

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:33.260
with almost zero noise and the question
is what can your camera do? Well

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:37.090
it’s easy to figure out let me show you
how to do it. Get in a room in low-light

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:37.840
and shoot a series

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:42.459
images increasing your ISO with each
shot. Then take a look at the photos at

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:44.549
full resolution on your computer

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:50.200
and you know what ISO value is the max
for your camera. If ISO 6400 has too much

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:51.500
noise for your taste

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:55.230
but ISO 3200 look's good. Then ISO 3200

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:58.409
is your cameras maximum acceptable ISO
value.

00:03:58.409 --> 00:04:02.330
The rule of thumb still holds true you
want to keep your ISO values as low as

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:03.349
possible because

00:04:03.349 --> 00:04:06.480
you don't wanna introduce noise in your images,
if you don't have to.

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:11.280
But because our cameras are advance now
in low-light increasing your ISO can

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:12.830
really help you out. So

00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:16.180
in low light don't be afraid to crank up
the ISO.

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:20.100
Because that can keep your shutter speeds
fast and that can really improve your low

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:20.949
light photography.

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:24.070
Let's take a look. Let's say we're in a
room with low light

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:27.560
and we don't have a flash and we're
taking photos of some kids at a

00:04:27.560 --> 00:04:28.570
birthday party.

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:33.350
We set our camera to aperture priority
mode and we're shooting at ISO 100 at

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:39.090
f2.8. Our camera is telling us our shutter
speed is 1/15th of a second.

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:43.460
That's no good at all our photos are
gonna come out totally blurry.

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:46.850
Now even if we had a tripod those kids
are gonna move around and our photos will

00:04:46.850 --> 00:04:47.790
stink.

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:51.310
We don't want that let's increase our
ISO

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:54.470
and see what happens. At ISO 200

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:57.580
our shutter speed will be at 1/30th of a
second.

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:00.600
At ISO 400 are shutter speed will be

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:04.419
1/60th of a second and ISO 800

00:05:04.419 --> 00:05:08.030
we'll be shooting at 1/125th of a second.

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:12.940
Now that's fast enough to freeze those
kids. We could even boost our ISO to1600

00:05:12.940 --> 00:05:15.020
to shoot at 1/250th of a second

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:19.360
just to be sure. One of my favorite
features is called Auto ISO that's when

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:21.580
you wanna work really fast and your not quite certain

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:26.080
what ISO value you should use. So let's
take the example of shooting a birthday

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:28.229
party with kids and really low light.

00:05:28.229 --> 00:05:31.949
I might wanna shoot in aperture value let's
say F8 and a shutter speed around

00:05:31.949 --> 00:05:34.220
250 to freeze all the motion,

00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:37.710
but what ISO value should I use. Well I
don't have to know that. All I have to do

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:38.370
is

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:42.360
put my camera into Auto ISO mode my
cameras gonna figure that out

00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:45.699
for me. So I'd put my camera in manual mode set it to F8

00:05:45.699 --> 00:05:49.130
set it to 250th of a second and start
taking pictures.

00:05:49.130 --> 00:05:53.100
My ISO is going to change for a correct
exposure every time.

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:57.720
It's really awesome. Now sometimes the ISO might go higher than you might want.

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:02.060
You'll get noisy images but my opinion
I'd rather have noisy images that I can

00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:02.810
use.

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:06.530
Rather than a blurry image that I have to throw away. Well I hope you learned a little bit
