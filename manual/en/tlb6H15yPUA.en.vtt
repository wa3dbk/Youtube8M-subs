00:00:01.079 --> 00:00:04.210
It appears there is a human being watching.

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:06.660
Hello human being, I'm the Doctor!

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:07.700
Ah, you've heard of me?

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:12.389
Well I do travel all of time and space and
seen wondrous things and scary things as well.

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:19.340
Let me tell you about the things you should
be scared of.

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:21.980
Actually it's just me Martin doing a bit of
cos-play.

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:24.930
Give us a thumbs up if you're a Whovian like
me as well.

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:29.510
It is of course Doctor Who's 50th anniversary
so for Head Squeeze I thought I'd look at

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:32.610
some of the recurring monsters on Doctor Who.

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:35.230
Which do you think is the scariest?

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:40.680
Well, keep that in mind as I look with some
science which ones you should be scared of.

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:46.059
Let's start with the weeping angels, they're
almost as old as old as the universe, that's

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:48.980
13.8 billion years by the way.

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:52.440
And they have an ingenious defence mechanism.

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:55.760
When they're not being observed they move
quickly and silently.

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:01.730
But when they are being observed, they quantum
lock, turning themselves into stone.

00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:07.620
And this is actually very similar to the quantum
zero effect, when a normally unstable particle,

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:11.970
when continuously observed, won't actually
decay.

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.510
Essentially, its normal evolution is frozen.

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:21.510
This actually taps into the weird things about
the microscopic world, that the act of observing

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:24.300
something actually changes its state.

00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.370
But this is also a massive problem.

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:29.980
What counts as an observation?

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:35.690
If you go by the original so-called Copenhagen
interpretation, then it's all down to a human

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:36.690
being.

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:41.140
But then you get the absurdities such as Schrodinger's
Cat where you have something both as big and

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:47.590
normal as a cat being both dead and alive
at the same time.

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:52.570
While this is a problem we still yet haven't
yet fully resolved, quantum decoherence could

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:55.060
provide an answer.

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:00.350
This removes that strict boundary between
experiment and observation.

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:05.450
And it's everything in between that gives
you that apparent change of state.

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:11.730
In fact it's a really nice way of just generating
the familiar everyday work around us from

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.170
the weird quantum world that.

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:15.640
Of course, it's built up of.

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.290
So how does this apply to the weeping angels?

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:25.170
Well essentially everything counts as an observation,
even an air molecule bouncing off them so;

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.260
surely they'd be stone all the time.

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:34.830
Then again our understanding of quantum mechanics
could change in the future.

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:36.870
Next up it's the cyber men.

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:42.560
Cybernetically augmented humanoids, that suppress
emotions and want to cyber-convert you into

00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:43.980
their ranks.

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:48.370
Now the original cybermen suffered a massive
weakness to gold.

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:53.959
Some say that's because its non-corrosive
nature would block up their respiratory system

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:54.970
when inhaled.

00:02:54.970 --> 00:03:01.510
But then again, things like gold coins, gold
tipped bullets, and even a golden ticket spelled

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:06.590
their downfall in some episodes, which makes
me think that there is an adverse chemical

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:07.690
reaction going on.

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:12.970
This is actually really surprising because
gold isn't very reactive at all.

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:18.440
In fact it's right at the bottom of the reactivity
series of metals.

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:23.630
This is because its unpaired electron that
it needs to get rid of in order to react is

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:28.010
actually at a lower energy level than some
of its paired electrons.

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:33.190
So whilst gold would like to get rid of that
unpaired electron it can't because it would

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:38.830
make those paired higher energy electrons
unstable.

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:44.849
So if the cybermen are reacting so badly to
gold it makes me think that some part of them

00:03:44.849 --> 00:03:53.020
must compose of a super strong oxidising agent,
when then would readily react with anything

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:59.190
else, iron, aluminium, hydrogen gas, that's
a massive weakness in my books.

00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:03.140
Of course a discussion of Doctor Who's monsters
has to include the daleks!

00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:09.540
Genetically mutated creatures integrated into
a tank like robotic shell.

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:15.459
It's this shell that makes them so deadly,
that and their determination for extermination.

00:04:15.459 --> 00:04:20.919
Because it's heavily armed with a plunger,
don't laugh, it can crush man's skulls, and

00:04:20.919 --> 00:04:23.409
of course a death ray.

00:04:23.409 --> 00:04:28.939
Now death rays or directed energy weapons
as they're known outside of science fiction

00:04:28.939 --> 00:04:30.740
are in fact real.

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:36.370
In fact US Navy's laser weapon system, works
against drones.

00:04:36.370 --> 00:04:43.069
A laser produces highly focused light waves
which mean it's extremely accurate.

00:04:43.069 --> 00:04:47.300
By bombarding a target with the photons of
light you can heat it up and can cause it

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:53.320
to oblate, catch fire, or just generally cause
damage.

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:58.620
The thing is though is that it takes a lot
of power, one reason being because of dust

00:04:58.620 --> 00:04:59.689
in the atmosphere.

00:04:59.689 --> 00:05:03.789
These will heat up before the light even gets
to your target.

00:05:03.789 --> 00:05:09.389
Then again this is a problem we have overcome
of course because we have real laser weapons.

00:05:09.389 --> 00:05:12.650
But they're not really like the Dalek's death
ray.

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:19.119
There's no beam of light, there's no x-ray
flash, in fact the object of the target just

00:05:19.119 --> 00:05:24.220
catches fire just from a point and then everything
goes up in flames.

00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:29.099
It turns out that these directed energy weapons
are actually really economical compared to

00:05:29.099 --> 00:05:34.249
the likes of missiles so they're not only
cooler they're cheaper per shot as well.

00:05:34.249 --> 00:05:38.830
I hope you Doctor Who fans enjoyed that but
