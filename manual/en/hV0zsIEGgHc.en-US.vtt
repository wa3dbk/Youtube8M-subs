00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:06.020
Hey guys so this time I decided

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:07.310
To make a marble tic tac toe

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:09.750
Board game and this really was

00:00:09.750 --> 00:00:10.750
A great little project it's a

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:11.970
Lot of fun and you can do it in

00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:15.309
A few hours and for pretty cheap too

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:17.359
And as you can see I've got my

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:19.770
Lines here and for that I used

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.910
Router with a V groove bit and

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:24.080
For the little divets or the holes

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:25.550
For the marbles to sit in I

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:26.749
Just used my drill press with a

00:00:26.749 --> 00:00:28.829
Standard bit it really was a Pretty

00:00:28.829 --> 00:00:31.140
Easy little project and then the Other

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.669
Cool thing about this is that when you're

00:00:32.669 --> 00:00:34.570
Done playing with you can just flip this

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:37.270
Down you can actually just store your

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:42.170
Marbles inside and you won't lose your

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:44.480
Marbles.. Guarenteed... So check out the

00:00:44.480 --> 00:00:46.100
Rest of this video on how I made this

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:47.340
And always you can check out my

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:49.440
website at WoodLogger.com

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.230
So to get started with my block or my

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.730
Tic tac toe game what I needed to do

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:57.720
First was figure out the math of where

00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:01.370
I cut my lines on my block and so for

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:04.100
Mine it's going to be about 1 and 5/16

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.810
Of an inch and to do that cut I'm going

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:09.830
To use my router table and use a 5/8 inch

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:13.670
V groove bit and I'm using that size

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:16.610
Because it's all I had and I guess I could

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:19.780
Have used my table saw I did try a

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:21.950
Test block to see what it would look like

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:24.820
And honestly I just thought it looked a little

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:28.210
Too wide and I don't know it just didn't

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:30.149
Look the way I wanted it to look So I'm

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:32.210
To try that with a 5/8 inch groove bit

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:59.819
Or V groove bit and we'll see how it goes

00:01:59.819 --> 00:02:02.600
Okay so i've got my lines now from

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.619
The router table and I don't know how

00:02:04.619 --> 00:02:06.600
Well that will show up on the video

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:08.361
You can see I've got my lines now I

00:02:08.361 --> 00:02:10.560
Just kind of want to find my center

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.180
Point for each of the squares honestly

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.620
You could just eye ball this I mean you

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.220
Really can I'm a little more nuts

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:20.970
So I tend to want to be a little more

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.501
Precise and so what I decided to do for

00:02:23.501 --> 00:02:27.230
Me was just kind of find the center by

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:33.950
Drawing a line through all of my boxes

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:38.459
You can line that up within each square

00:02:38.459 --> 00:03:03.159
To find the cross point

00:03:03.159 --> 00:03:05.400
Okay so now I've got my crosses on each

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.189
Of my boxes and I've got my center line

00:03:08.189 --> 00:03:11.040
Or my center point rather for each of the

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.709
Holes to be drilled into All right so

00:03:13.709 --> 00:03:17.019
I've got my all my cross hairs where I'm

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:19.739
Going to drill my holes and I've set

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:22.720
My depth so that I'm just going a little

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:25.902
Under the surface don't need to go to

00:03:25.902 --> 00:03:32.340
Far and I'm using a half inch drill bit

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:33.651
And honestly I wish I had one that was just

00:03:33.651 --> 00:03:35.219
A little bigger cause I think the marbles

00:03:35.219 --> 00:03:37.930
Would look better the further they sat

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:40.060
In there but this is the largest one I've
got

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:41.150
So I'm going to go with this for now

00:03:41.150 --> 00:04:03.510
Here we go

00:04:03.510 --> 00:04:04.900
Okay and now I've got all my holes

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:10.249
Drilled out for my marbles to sit in

00:04:10.249 --> 00:04:13.400
Okay so I've got my holes all drilled and

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:15.260
Now I've really got to do is just for my

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:21.130
Last drill and that is into the end grain

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:23.221
And I've marked a couple places where I

00:04:23.221 --> 00:04:25.710
Want to drill my holes and this where the

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:28.250
Marbles will actually stay when the game

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:50.300
Isn't being used

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:54.900
Well so I have my board basically done now

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:57.250
And really the last piece I have to do is

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:00.110
Put a little backer board here thats going

00:05:00.110 --> 00:05:03.000
To hold the marbles from falling out So what

00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.130
I did was I went ahead and already cut this

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:11.810
I used a 3 and half by 1 inch pience of oak

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:15.000
And I chose just because I had some scrap
that

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.600
Was laying around and I thought it might

00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:20.501
Be an interesting contrast to see you know

00:05:20.501 --> 00:05:22.530
What it looks like with a different end on

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:26.060
Each side So last but not least I just

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:28.940
Have to pre drill my holes

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:59.169
That was a little too tight there

00:05:59.169 --> 00:06:09.199
All right well there you have it I've got
my

00:06:09.199 --> 00:06:10.990
Little blocker piece that will keep my marbles

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:17.430
From falling out and if I add my marbles

00:06:17.430 --> 00:06:32.270
I'll put some blue ones on this side

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:35.430
So there you go I've got my colors all in

00:06:35.430 --> 00:06:37.629
There with my marbles and it's going to hold

00:06:37.629 --> 00:06:39.979
It in place and really the last step I have

00:06:39.979 --> 00:06:44.759
To do is now is to paint my board or

00:06:44.759 --> 00:06:46.990
Maybe I'll stain it I made a couple extra's

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:49.669
Just so that I have 2 kids so you gotta give

00:06:49.669 --> 00:06:54.949
1 to each kid and that was a fun little project

00:06:54.949 --> 00:06:56.949
So if you want to see more pictures and

00:06:56.949 --> 00:06:59.039
