Hey Everyone!

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:06.200
Welcome to my brand new channel here on this
tiny little corner of the internet known as

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:07.470
Youtube.

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:11.080
I wanted to take a minute to introduce myself
to you all.

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:19.780
Hi my name is Nightfox. I'm brand new to uploading
videos to youtube, but I've been an avid viewer

00:00:19.789 --> 00:00:24.839
for some time. I'm not quite sure what I want
to do with this channel just yet, but you

00:00:24.839 --> 00:00:28.579
know I want to at least invite everyone along
for my journey.

00:00:28.579 --> 00:00:34.790
I do want to apologize, I'm still working
out some technical issues on my end. The video

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:40.430
quality is not quite up to speed. I ordered
an El Gato recording device, but it hadn't

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:46.010
arrived yet. But, you know, I didn't want
to pass up the oppurtunity to at least celebrate

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:51.810
the new year with everybody. Yea, so it is
New Year's Eve here in my world, I've made

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:57.010
a couple preparations to celebrate both the
dawn of the new year, and the dawn of this

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:03.489
new channel. Kinda, knocking out two birds
with one stone sorta deal. Anyway, I'm not

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:08.189
here alone in tonight's episode. I've got
a few friends that are here with me that are

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:10.719
at the party. Let's see if we can meet some
of them.

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:16.170
Hey everybody! Hey Mildred, glad you could
make it! See if we can put on some music.

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.109
Let's see Strad or Stal, let's put on Strad.

00:01:21.109 --> 00:01:27.109
And, yeah we're gonna party it up. I wonder
why everybody is in the kitchen, you know

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:31.700
everytime I got friends coming over they always
gotta ransack the kitchen, taking my food.

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:36.280
I guess I should feed them something, but
I'll worry about that in a little bit.

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:40.420
Anyway, we'll get started as soon as I can
sort out all these little slight technical

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:41.429
issues.

00:01:41.429 --> 00:01:48.359
I think, maybe to start off, we'll just start
a new world all together. I've never actually

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:53.659
ventured away from this little homestead I've
built here. So, it will be quite interesting

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:57.869
to start over, plus this will give a chance
for everyone to start off on the same page.

00:01:57.869 --> 00:02:02.719
Gosh, that means I've got a lot to do... I've
gotta pack, I've got to get this boat to start,

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:04.249
Man, I'm gonna be busy.

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:08.440
Anyway, there's no time to worry about that,
the countdown has started.

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:09.750
Let's see...

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.080
6...
5...

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.400
4...
3...

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.720
2...
1...

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:22.470
Happy New Year Everybody!

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:32.420
Anyway, as I said, my name is Nightfox and
welcome to my channel. I hope to see you all

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:37.700
soon. Thanks for watching ,and I hope you
all have a very happy new year.

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:38.750
Bye!
