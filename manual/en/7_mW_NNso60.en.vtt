Marc Luber: Hey everyone – Marc Luber here
from Careers Out There - you can find me at

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:06.860
Careers Out There dot com.

00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:11.470
I recently interviewed Allison Meyerson, the
Vice President of Retail at House of Blues

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:13.860
Entertainment where she’s worked for the
past 17 years.

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.670
I asked Allison to walk us through what retail
buyers do.

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:17.690
Here’s a look at how it went!

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:22.830
Can you walk us through some real life examples
so we can see some scenarios that play out

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:24.580
on each of those things you said?

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:26.980
Allison Meyerson: Yeah.

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:33.400
So weekly or even daily retail buyers are
gonna be looking at reports from the stores

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:40.380
with sales information and then they’re
gonna be analyzing that information to judge

00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:44.370
what needs to be re-ordered and when it needs
to be re-ordered, what’s the lead time that

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:51.010
we have with different vendors and different
product categories, if items are being produced

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:55.890
frequently, if they’re being produced domestically
they’re gonna have a shorter time frame,

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:03.130
if they’re being produced offshore, they’re
gonna have a longer time frame for production…So

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:10.700
all of these things weigh in to the analysis
and the decisions that the buyers are making,

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.950
as well as of course how well the product
is selling.

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:18.770
And then if it’s not selling as well, then
there’s another set of decisions to make

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:27.329
in terms of does this need to be marked down,
or is it selling better in one location and

00:01:27.329 --> 00:01:28.329
not another?

00:01:28.329 --> 00:01:30.520
Do we need to transfer it somewhere?

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:36.509
Anything that’s going to give your stores
their maximum revenue potential.

00:01:36.509 --> 00:01:42.659
Luber: And that’s because let’s say a
certain hat might be really hot in Boston

00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:44.270
but in Chicago nobody likes it?

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.740
Does that kind of thing happen?

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:48.179
Allison: That does happen!

00:01:48.179 --> 00:01:49.179
Absolutely.

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:55.460
I would tell you that in my experience, most
best selling products are best selling products

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:57.680
everywhere.

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:06.210
But there are certain anomalies here and there
that for some reason gangbusters in Las Vegas

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:12.070
or somewhere else and don’t sell as well
in other places.

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:13.830
So yeah.

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:17.790
And those are some of the things that if they’ve
been around a little while you know that and

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.130
you have some of that history – but when
they’re new products, that’s always something

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:24.090
that you’re kind of looking to fine-tune
and tweak.

00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:26.170
