Okay so since I've gotten everything tacked
down, my plackets, my linings and also this

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:13.620
last stitch to the top and the bottom together.
And we're going to sew these buttons on. And

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.009
as you can tell I've already marked it. And
if you forgot your measurements from before

00:00:18.009 --> 00:00:24.669
you can go back and mark what you've already
done and reapply it to the one that you just

00:00:24.669 --> 00:00:30.329
did. And it was 1 1/2 inch by 5/8. So I've
got those marked. And I'm ready just to sew

00:00:30.329 --> 00:00:40.230
these on. And I'm going to go right through
to the lining. Here we go. Pretty tight. And

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:49.870
I'm going to go around twice.
Okay and if you remember from the first cuff

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:55.030
that we did we don't even have to worry about
cutting the thread. All we want to do is make

00:00:55.030 --> 00:01:02.880
one knot. There we go. Run it through about
5/8 of an inch. Then flip it over and you

00:01:02.880 --> 00:01:08.790
can see, you can watch your needle come out
at the chalk mark. And that's when we know

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:16.950
that we have it right. And don't pull it hard
just pull it softly. Get our other button.

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:22.729
Okay. I like to go around them twice just
to make sure that I have them on there nice

00:01:22.729 --> 00:01:31.250
and good. There we go. Go back through to
the other side. Alway go through to the lining.

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:38.509
That's an important part of that. And let's
do one knot here. And let's go back down and

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:46.959
put the last button on. Okay. Like I said
before it's just so much easier to do this

00:01:46.959 --> 00:01:54.929
by hand because you can make sure that everything
is right in place. There we go. One more turn.

00:01:54.929 --> 00:01:58.630
And when were done I want to lay them out
next to each other to make sure that they're

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:04.560
both even and that they both look really nice
and crisp just the way they're supposed to.

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.810
So here I'm going to put about three knots
because this is pulling all the buttons on.

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:15.591
There we go. Let me cut this thread. I'm going
to leave about 1/2 an inch and make sure we

00:02:15.591 --> 00:02:21.810
have extra room. Okay so these are our cuffs.
I'm going to lay them next to each other.

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:30.720
You can see how they look. Hold that and looks
like all the buttons are even, the plackets

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:35.470
are even, nice and straight. This turned out
really good and I hope yours turned out as

00:02:35.470 --> 00:02:36.280
good as mine did.
