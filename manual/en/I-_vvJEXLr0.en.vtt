00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:09.570
you can have so much fun with things inside
your kitchen and make this centrifuge.

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.799
colored water, some oil, bowl and some steel
balls.

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:23.610
first take this bowl and at 3 points attach
the thread with the tape so that you can lift

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:24.970
the bowl in air.

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:25.970
what is unique?

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:26.970
3 points.

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:33.450
and if you attach the string at two points
you will not be able to balance the bowl.

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:40.930
twist the bowl in one direction as much as
you can. and now when you drop some steel

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:49.219
bowls inside this bowl and lift it the bowl
will start spinning in the other direction

00:00:49.219 --> 00:00:54.899
so fast that you can see the steel bowls going
to the end and some them actually fly out

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.570
like canon balls.

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.670
see the balls are aligned in a perfect circle
because of the centrifugal force which depends

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.550
on how fast the bowl is rotating, pushing
the steel balls to the end and they stay there

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:17.890
because of the friction with the bowl. this
is the basic concept of the centrifuge.

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:25.930
now pour some color water inside and add some
edible oil.

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:30.509
these two are of different densities. oil
is lighter and so you can see it floating

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:31.890
on water.

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:41.990
again twist the bowl and when you leave it
you can see this wonderful centrifuge.

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:50.310
water flies out because it is more dense,
edible oil is at center and some part of it

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:57.000
which is more orange is the overlap of water
and oil. and there is nothing in the center

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.770
which is just the bottom of the bowl which
is white.

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:09.380
so you see four colors in this centrifuge.
in fact if you twist it more you might spill

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:13.130
the water out.

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:22.040
this is kitchen science and you can play with
this centrifuge.
