00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:01.890
Hey everyone!

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:06.749
This is Cool Cats R us, showing all you cool
cats out there how to do the Pony.

00:00:06.749 --> 00:00:23.339
Alright, so I'm going to show you the pony
at normal speed and then I'll break it down

00:00:23.339 --> 00:00:25.099
for you.

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:28.759
Alright, so the pony is a very simple move.

00:00:28.759 --> 00:00:31.619
You just have to add some speed onto it later
on.

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.070
It's very simple.

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:37.829
It's three steps to the left and three steps
to the right.

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:43.629
So it's one, two, three

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:48.769
one, two, three

00:00:48.769 --> 00:00:54.039
one, two, three

00:00:54.039 --> 00:00:56.510
To the left one, two, three

00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:01.020
and then to the right, right, left, right.

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:03.710
Then left, right, left

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:07.090
Right, left, right

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:11.380
From behind it's going to be left, right,
left

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:14.610
then right, left, right

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.560
left, right, left

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:19.170
right, left, right

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:25.100
So then as you start to get that down you
want to increase your speed with the regular

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:29.210
pace of the music so it would left, right,
left and right, left, right.

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:30.250
Left, right, left

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:31.650
right, left, right

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.049
left, right, left

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:34.450
right, left, right

00:01:34.450 --> 00:01:37.860
So once you get that down you want increase
the speed to a normal speed and this is what

00:01:37.860 --> 00:01:43.020
it should look like for you.

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:44.700
Swing your arms with it.

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:58.660
You even add in the swim with it.

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:00.640
So that's the basics of the pony.

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:05.530
