Hey guys, It’s Derek here with Equinox Project
Studio. Hope your week is going really well,

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:23.250
mine is going good. It’s been good on the
music front at least. So, today I just wanted

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:29.960
to do a quick little fun video on guitar reamping.
And kind of just make it a 101 type course.

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:33.390
But should also be helpful for some of you
that have heard of reamping and are maybe

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.330
looking to incorporate it into your workflows.
I’m gonna show you the equipment you need,

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:41.460
but first let’s just kind of go over what
reamping is for those of you that may not

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:42.510
know about it.

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.879
Reamping is a really powerful tool for engineers
because it allows us as engineers to go and

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:52.410
play with the guitar tone and not necessarily
worry about committing the tone to the hard

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.120
drive when we first start recording. We just
record a direct input signal, just a dry guitar

00:00:57.120 --> 00:01:01.250
signal and you can keep that on hand and then
later in the session if you’re not happy

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:05.160
with the guitar tone you printed or with whatever
plugins you’re working with, then we can

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:09.899
take that DI signal, we can send it out from
our DAW and we can send it back into our amplifier

00:01:09.899 --> 00:01:12.710
so we can play with some new tones and find
something that maybe sounds better in the

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:13.970
mix.

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:19.380
So essentially it just allows for more flexibility
at the mix stage and it really allows you

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:24.860
to find a tone that you love and play with
mic positions, different polar patterns, different

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:30.149
amplifiers, whatever. You know, it’s just
really flexible, very powerful way to get

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:34.160
good guitar tones. So let’s go ahead and
just look at the equipment you guys need first

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:37.420
and then we’ll get into the process and
I’ll show you guys how to actually do it,

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:38.440
ok? Cool.

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:42.330
So obviously enough you guys will need your
computer, your DAW software of choice — we’re

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:46.130
using Pro Tools here – then you’ll need
probably a couple of cables that may vary

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:50.580
depending on your I/O situation. I like to
have balanced cables if the runs are longer

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:54.970
than 20 feet or so. Just so prevent adding
ground hum or signal degradation. Then you’ll

00:01:54.970 --> 00:01:59.630
need your reamp box. I use the Radial Pro-RMP
which is built like a tank, it’s affordable

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:04.959
and it does its job really well. and then
you’ll obviously need a microphone to record

00:02:04.959 --> 00:02:09.810
the performance from your amplifier. We’ll
just have an SM57 on there today for this

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:13.129
example. Obviously your guitar amplifier will
be needed as well.

00:02:13.129 --> 00:02:19.720
So if we take a look at the back of my interface
here, you can see we’ve got outputs 7 and

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:26.720
8 are available. So we’ll go ahead and send
line output number 7 out from my interface

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:31.200
into the reamp box, so that’ where we’re
going to send out DI signal out for reamping,

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:36.270
is output number 7. So we’ll go ahead and
plug into there now. And from output number

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:42.110
7, the other end of that cable will then go
into the input of our reamp box here. And

00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:46.740
then the output of the reamp box I’m just
going to attach an unbalanced quarter inch

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:51.190
guitar instrument cable and then thats’
going to go right into the front of the amplifier

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:56.420
just like if you were plugging a guitar directly
into the amplifier itself, ok?

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:03.050
Ok guys, so let’s just go through a scenario
here right now. So, pretend I’m the client,

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:06.500
I’m you, I’m your band, your guitar player
— whoever. We’re just gonna record a DI

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:12.569
track just using a plugin in Pro Tools and
then I’ll show you how we send that back

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:16.330
out to reamp and then back into Pro Tools.
So here’s the first step of the process.

00:03:16.330 --> 00:03:20.640
Let’s track in the DI guitars. This guitar
is going direct into the preamp over here

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:24.140
to send to the instrument input. So let’s
go ahead and record a take and then we’ll

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:28.270
send it out for reamping.

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:35.270
[recording guitar DI for reamping]

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:52.550
Ok, so we’ve recorded the DI guitar. You
can see I’ve got the dry signal right here

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:58.220
in Pro Tools. Straight in from the guitar
into the preamp, into the DAW. So now we’re

00:03:58.220 --> 00:04:02.190
gonna send it out to reamp, but first I’ll
show you guys what you need to do in Pro Tools

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:05.580
to get it from A to B. So let’s take a look
there what you need to do.

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:08.980
Ok guys, so here we are in Pro Tools, you
can see that we have the dry guitar track

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:12.920
which we recorded to, we had Amplitude for
reference, it’s all bypassed now. And then

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:16.220
we’ve got a reamp guitar track which is
where we’ll print to. SO we’re essentially

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:20.220
just gonna create a loop from Pro Tools to
the amp then back into Pro Tools again. And

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:26.900
if you remember we plugged our reamp box into
the output number 7 on the back of my converter

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:33.900
box. And so we’re sending our signal out
of output number 7 to the reamp box then to

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:40.290
the guitar amp then the guitar amp is going
to play into the SM57, which is in turn plugged

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:45.760
into analog input number 2 on the interface,
which is what our reamp channel is set to

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:48.419
record to, is input number 2 which is that
microphone.

00:04:48.419 --> 00:04:52.430
So we’re going to go ahead and send this
out output number 7 which is where we have

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:56.889
the reamp box plugged in to. Ok, so that’s
physical output number 7 and we’re gonna

00:04:56.889 --> 00:05:01.230
want to set that to pre-fader and we can still
adjust the gain here to kind of get a hotter

00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:04.960
less hot, just depending on your taste and
how you want the sound. I kind of find this

00:05:04.960 --> 00:05:08.570
is more of a natural area here in that -20
dB range. So that’s where we’ll leave

00:05:08.570 --> 00:05:14.050
it. That’s fine for reference. So now if
I arm this reamp guitar track for record you

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:19.570
will hear some amp noise and amp hum. Ok,
we’ve completed the loop, let’s go ahead

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:23.960
and reamp this bad boy here. Here we go.

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:29.960
[recording reamped electric guitar in Pro
Tools]

00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:36.960
Alright, if we play that back you will hear
just the reamp 6505. Alright guys, so really

00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:51.300
that’s all there is to it. That’s reamping
for you right there. It’s a really cheap

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:55.449
and powerful way to record guitars because
it allows you to be so much more creative

00:05:55.449 --> 00:05:59.930
and you can just have your client focus on
the performance at the time of recording and

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:03.919
then you can dick around and do your thing
as an engineer and get the sounds after you’ve

00:06:03.919 --> 00:06:07.520
already got a good performance committed to
the disk there. Again, yeah it’s pretty

00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:10.550
cheap that radial box — it’ll probably
be the only piece of equipment most of you

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:13.860
guys would need if you don’t already have
one, and they run about 100 bucks. Built like

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:18.120
a tank it’ll last you a lifetime, it’ll
do everything you need. It even has a cool

00:06:18.120 --> 00:06:22.580
little ground hum switch so you can take off
any of the AC hum you pick up if you’re

00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:24.860
running longer cables across the room.

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:29.010
So, I hope I explained it well and in-depth
for you guys. I tried to kind of go through

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:33.710
literally every step of the process so it
was as cut and dry and black and white as

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:38.210
possible. But I appreciate you guys watching
and it would mean a lot if you would subscribe

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:42.479
to my channel if you haven’t yet. I hope
to have tons more informative stuff like this.

00:06:42.479 --> 00:06:46.400
There’s a lot of it already on the internet
and on YouTube but I’d like to contribute

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:50.680
to that myself and put some cool videos out
there. I’ve got some good mixing tutorials

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:54.460
coming out hopefully focusing on some drums
soon. So anyway, thanks again for watching

00:06:54.460 --> 00:07:01.139
guys, be sure to stop by the website: www.equinox-ps.com.
Again this is Derek signing off, have a great

00:07:01.139 --> 00:07:02.240
week dudes. See you later.
