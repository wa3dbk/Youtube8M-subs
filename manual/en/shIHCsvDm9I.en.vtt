00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:04.880
So, out of curiosity we decided to run an
experiment. We were curious to see whether

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:08.080
it mattered how many starting tunnels
you dug for the ants.

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:11.630
So what we did was got two identical set-ups
and we started with

00:00:11.630 --> 00:00:14.809
one starting tunnel in one and four in the other,

00:00:14.809 --> 00:00:18.020
These are our results. Hi, I'm Michael

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:25.020
with How to Ant Farm. Let's talk about ants.

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:35.890
So, here's our first group and if you
notice, these ones have dug this

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:37.040
new tunnel here

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:41.949
and this tunnel here and along the
bottoms they kind of expanded them out a

00:00:41.949 --> 00:00:44.070
little bit but they didn't do too much
besides that.

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:47.290
Also, it's worth noting that these

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:51.149
ants, when we added into the farm, were not
eager to get started right away.

00:00:51.149 --> 00:00:54.550
They kind of were a little bit docile
and treated the

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:58.250
holes that we had dug like it was
all they needed. If you notice,

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:01.440
for the most part, all they did was come
down the

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:04.970
already made tunnels and dig either
straight up

00:01:04.970 --> 00:01:09.170
or just off to the side a little bit.
It's kind of like they thought they had

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:10.740
enough room already and they're just

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.149
kind of expanding to give himself more
area to sleep.

00:01:14.149 --> 00:01:17.520
Something we noted that may be the cause
of them not digging as much

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.910
is that because there were four
well-made tunnels to begin with,

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:24.179
they may have register that as being
enough space for them

00:01:24.179 --> 00:01:28.080
to begin with and cause them to be less
eager to expand their area.

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.270
And if you notice all the matter on top of that
they've displaced, that may have

00:01:31.270 --> 00:01:32.190
something to do with the other one.

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:36.829
You can see here

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:40.159
with this one, we only dug one
starting tunnel to begin with

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:43.720
and as soon as we put ants in, they
busily got to work,

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:47.040
and they went ahead and they created
this tunnel here

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:50.340
all along the side, these ones at the
sides.

00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:53.799
Something that we thought was really
need is that the patterns that they're

00:01:53.799 --> 00:01:56.520
doing here are a lot more intricate than
the previous one.

00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.079
This could be to do with the fact that
there's a lot more open space for them

00:02:00.079 --> 00:02:00.570
to

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.380
build in their own patterns, whereas the
other one they had a limited structure,

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:06.140
it was built into a certain block.

00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:10.310
One thing that we should note about
these ants is when we put these ones

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:11.220
into the colony

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:14.269
they immediately got to work and started
digging

00:02:14.269 --> 00:02:18.090
unlike the other ones. We think this
could have something to do with the fact

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:18.730
that there's

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.630
a lot more room for them to expand into,
giving them more leeway for intricate

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:23.440
designs,

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.920
as well as the fact that they had a
little limited amount of space

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.390
underground to begin with,

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:32.530
making them more eager to expand their
tunnels. So,

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:37.120
the results of our experiments are this:
the one with the four tunnels, while more structured,

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.430
the ants were less eager to start digging

00:02:40.430 --> 00:02:44.320
and it gave them a lot less room to expand
into, causing their tunnels become a lot

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:44.570
less

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.389
intricate one with one tunnel, they got
busily to work

00:02:48.389 --> 00:02:51.470
right away and they immediately started
digging their own

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:56.220
intricate patterns and we think that it
gives them a lot more room to expand, so

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:57.130
if you prefer

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:01.030
more structured method, then you'd probably
be better off with four starting tunnels

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:04.320
but for us we prefer and recommend

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:07.919
the one starting tunnel. So after the first
day

00:03:07.919 --> 00:03:10.979
of having the ants in the hill, we came in the
next morning

00:03:10.979 --> 00:03:14.889
and decided to run the camera for three
hours and take care of a time lapse for you guys

00:03:14.889 --> 00:03:16.549
and this is what we saw.
