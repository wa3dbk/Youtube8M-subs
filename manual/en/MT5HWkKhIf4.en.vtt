Theodore Roosevelt - one of the all-time greats
Was the 26th president of the United States

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:22.779
William Howard Taft was the next man to take
charge

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:28.730
His nickname was big bill - he was really
rather large

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:35.000
In 1917 Woodrow Wilson oversaw
The entry of America into the First World

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.000
War

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.180
It's easy to forget that the next man came
along

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:44.229
As poor old Warren Harding got quite a few
things wrong

00:00:44.229 --> 00:00:48.320
For the next 6 years Calvin Coolidge led the
USA

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.790
He did a rather decent job but never had much
to say

00:00:52.790 --> 00:01:00.780
The Great Depression started back in 1929
And it sure gave Herbert Hoover a very hard

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:02.129
old time

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:06.840
To lead us through World War Two, greatness
was required

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.960
FDR was just the man -- he truly was inspired

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:17.880
Harry Truman authorised the bombing of Japan
He helped build Europe back again with the

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:19.229
Marshall plan

00:01:19.229 --> 00:01:23.810
The Cold War was at its height when the next
man came to power

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:27.560
His friends preferred to call him "Ike": he
was Dwight D Eisenhower

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:32.840
It was John F Kennedy who said, "Let's go
to the moon"

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:37.100
Tragically his presidency was ended far too
soon

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:41.049
Lyndon Johnson was in charge during the Vietnam
War

00:01:41.049 --> 00:01:45.630
The civil rights he introduced made life better
than before

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.689
There were international issues that Richard
Nixon had to handle

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:54.649
But he ended up resigning - after the Watergate
scandal

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:58.490
After his departure the constitution then
ensured

00:01:58.490 --> 00:02:03.649
That the next man to be president would be
Gerald Ford

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:07.529
Next there would be Jimmy Carter the man who
had to plan

00:02:07.529 --> 00:02:11.319
To find a way to bring back home hostages
from Iran

00:02:11.319 --> 00:02:16.080
In Berlin Ronald Reagan said, "Tear down this
wall!"

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:20.849
And in '89 the wall did fall, near the end
of the cold war

00:02:20.849 --> 00:02:25.010
George Bush senior wanted two terms but he
only managed one

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:28.650
In just a few years' time though the president
was his son

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:33.610
Arkansas's Bill Clinton won the election of
'92

00:02:33.610 --> 00:02:38.349
There's a chance that his wife Hillary will
be a president too

00:02:38.349 --> 00:02:43.019
When George W Bush had only just started to
rule

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:47.019
The 9/11 attacks occurred, so monstrous and
so cruel

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:55.700
Barack Obama is the current white house resident
The first African American to be the president

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.260
And what about you young girls and boys, tell
me, what do you say?

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:26.009
Would you like to be the leader of your nation
some day?
