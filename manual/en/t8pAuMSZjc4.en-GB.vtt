00:00:04.569 --> 00:00:05.569
Step Breakdown:

00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:09.280
Step 1: MrCaffiene82 has provided a lot of
guides for quick reference on this site and

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:10.280
others.

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:26.740
Origins Zombies Blue Ultimate Staff 
Of Ice Challenge

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:37.480
Origins Zombies Red Ultimate Staff Of Fire
Challenge

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:50.680
Origins Zombies Purple Ultimate Staff Of Lightning
Challenge

00:00:50.680 --> 00:01:18.990
Origins Zombies Yellow Ultimate Staff Of 
Wind Challenge

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:35.771
Step 2: After Ultimate Staffs are completed
4 new Pedestals will appear. Place the proper

00:01:35.771 --> 00:01:38.250
staffs into the pedestals.

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:44.000
Fire - In Dig Site
Ice - Freya Robot (church)

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.100
Wind - Odin Robot (middle)
Lightning - Thor Robot (spawn)

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:58.850
Step 3: Located outside of Generator 5 (stamina-up)
you will see a downed plane with a concrete

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:13.050
slab in front of it. This is outside of the
play-able area so you must land the Napalm

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:29.920
Strike on the concrete correctly. At the same
time someone must push the red button which

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:33.790
is now inside of the robots.

00:02:33.790 --> 00:02:54.171
Step 4: After the hole is open you simply
release the Maxis Drone near the fence so

00:02:54.171 --> 00:03:18.250
it will fly in which 
will 

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:21.510
start spawning Panzer's.

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:30.350
Step 5: Using a zombie blood you will now
see and shoot a plane flying around that is

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:39.979
glowing red much like the Fire Staff Part
Plane that you shot down earlier.

00:03:39.979 --> 00:04:01.620
Step 6: Using another zombie blood you will
see a zombie running around the Dig Site which

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:50.600
you must shoot and then retrieve the Maxis
Drone from. This zombie will look different

00:04:50.600 --> 00:05:10.180
and 
just runs it's own path.

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:32.850
Step 7: Inside of the Dig Site near the 
Staff Pedestals you must melee the "White

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:50.200
Glow" off of the zombie's hands using your
"Thunder Gloves" from the Rewards Box. Once

00:05:50.200 --> 00:06:11.080
enough are done you 
will receive an upgraded Melee Punch.

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:25.010
Step 8: Place all of the staffs back into
the shrines at the "Crazy Place". Kill zombies

00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:45.310
to feed there soul's into the middle light.
Upon completion release the maxis drone into

00:06:45.310 --> 00:08:00.500
new sky opening and then teleport within the
light for the cutscene.
