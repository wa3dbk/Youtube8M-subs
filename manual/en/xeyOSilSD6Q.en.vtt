00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:09.131
The Three Spirits update, and results from
MLG Columbus and Dreamhack - all that and

00:00:09.131 --> 00:00:14.760
more coming up right now in the Curse Dota
2 Update!

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:20.970
Hey guys, Jess here, and what a big couple
of weeks it's been for Dota.

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:25.619
First Valve released the Three Spirits Update
- also know as "fuck yeah Valve gave us Diretide!"

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.509
All we had to do was whine about for a few
weeks.

00:00:28.509 --> 00:00:33.050
Anyway, besides just Diretide, the big thing
this patch was the addition of the heroes

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:37.440
Earth Spirit and Ember Spirit - plus, Storm
Spirit's model got updated.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.820
This update also added a bunch of new game
features - you can now craft and socket your

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:46.030
in-game cosmetic items, and a new in-game
coaching feature lets you help new friends

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:47.800
learn how to play!

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:52.280

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:53.320
for this patch.

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:58.110
Moving on to competitive news - some of the
world's top Dota 2 teams have been super busy

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:05.250
lately - November 22nd-24th 9 teams competed
at MLG Columbus for a prize pool of $136,890.

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:13.680
The sponsored prize pool was an even $50,000,
but every MLG Championship Bundle sold increased

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.250
that amount by $2.50.

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:20.870
The tournament opened with a round robin stage,
with Alliance, Navi, Fnatic, EG, Liuquid,

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:26.370
Speed Gaming, DK, Signma, and Pretty Boy Swag
playing each other once to determine which

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:29.130
four teams would move on to the semifinals.

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:35.270
During the semifinals, DK beat Navi 2-1, and
Speed beat out Sigma 2-0 in a best of three,

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:39.920
before moving on to the finals where Speed
overtook DK in a 2-1 victory to become our

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.520
MLG Columbus champions, and walked away with
over $60,000.

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:50.490
Next, four of the teams we saw at MLG got
VERY little time off to rest and recover before

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:55.060
jetting off to Sweden for the ASUS Dreamleague
playoffs taking place at Dreamhack Winter

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:56.060
2013.

00:01:56.060 --> 00:02:01.090
The playoffs were double elimination, best
of three, with a best of five for the finals.

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:05.640
Navi showed some impressive back-and-forth
action, first winning 2-1 to Team Liquid,

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.950
then dropping down into the loser's bracket
after an 0-3 loss to Fnatic, before turning

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:15.420
right around and beating Fnatic 3-0 in the
grand finals - there's the Dendi superman

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.240
action we were all hoping for.

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:22.520
Finally, Virtus Pro's long-time captain NS
has decided to retire from pro gaming.

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:27.040
After close to 10 years in the competitive
Dota scene, NS states that he no longer wishes

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.379
to compete as a player, but hopes to stay
in eSports in a non-player role.

00:02:31.379 --> 00:02:36.159
No news yet on exactly what his next steps
will be, but Virtus Pro ALSO announced on

00:02:36.159 --> 00:02:40.599
the same day taht player blowyourbrain would
be leaving the team.

00:02:40.599 --> 00:02:44.760
Hopefully this marks the start of more consistency
after the tumultuous history the team roster

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:46.360
has had these past few months.

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:47.360
That's it!

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:51.609
