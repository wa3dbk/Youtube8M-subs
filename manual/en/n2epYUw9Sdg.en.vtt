00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:10.370
Hey, I'm Justin with AmericanMuscle.com and
I'm checking out a couple of Bullitt Style

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:15.389
aluminum fuel door options available for all
1994 to 2004 Mustangs in your choice of either

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:17.320
brushed aluminum or black.

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:22.960
The styling from this gas cap comes courtesy
of the awesome 2001 Bullitt Mustang, which

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:28.160
was of course a tribute to the famous movie
car, the dark green '68 GT responsible for

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.480
the best chase scene ever recorded.

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:34.820
Now if you're in the market for more movie-inspired
Mustang parts like this fuel door or a set

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:39.220
of Eleanor quarter window louvers for instance,
AmericanMuscle.com is your place.

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:42.260

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:45.780
The fuel door itself is designed to add a
little bit more of an aggressive style to

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.460
an otherwise boring area of your ride.

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:53.400
Now the fuel door has been constructed using
a durable yet lightweight aluminum and is

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:57.450
built to OEM specifications, so you can expect
a perfect fit.

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:01.899
In addition to the quality construction, the
fuel door also includes a steel striker plate

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:05.950
and magnetic clasp, making sure that this
fuel door stays shut until you're ready for

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:07.170
your next fuel-up.

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:10.799
As I mentioned earlier, you do have a couple
of options when it comes to the finish.

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:15.130
For instance, on our 2000 GT here behind me,
we do have the gloss black option, which is

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:18.549
very sleek and will look good on just about
any color.

00:01:18.549 --> 00:01:22.270
On the other hand, if you want to stay true
to the factory Bullitt Mustang, then you might

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:26.249
want to pick up the brushed aluminum finish
here, which will offer a little bit more flash.

00:01:26.249 --> 00:01:31.130
Either way, if you want to see both options
installed on actual customer cars, just go

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:34.719
ahead and click on that link below to head
back to AmericanMuscle.com.

00:01:34.719 --> 00:01:38.109
Installing the Bullitt Style Fuel Door onto
your Mustang is definitely one of the easier

00:01:38.109 --> 00:01:39.109
jobs to tackle.

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:42.840
I think you'll be done in about 15 minutes
from start to finish with basic hand tools.

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.369
You guys should all know the deal by now:
if you should need a little extra help or

00:01:46.369 --> 00:01:50.049
if you just want to talk shop, don't hesitate
to get in touch with one of our Mustang experts

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:51.390

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:56.810
So if you'd like to give your SN95 some iconic
Mustang styling, then be sure to check out
