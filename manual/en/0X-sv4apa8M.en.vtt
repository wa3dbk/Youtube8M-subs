[Beep then intro music]

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:08.780
Mom &gt;&gt; I'm a working Mom as if there's any
other kind.

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:11.500
Mom &gt;&gt; My work day is full of noise and stress

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:15.590
Mom &gt;&gt; all of which, as Moms know, is a walk
in the park compared to home.

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:16.920
Mom &gt;&gt; I'm home.

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.250
Mom &gt;&gt; Mother's arrived.

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:19.140
Daughter &gt;&gt; Uh-uh.

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.430
Mom &gt;&gt; Oooh yeah, well at home I still get
the noise and stress

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:26.430
Mom &gt;&gt; but here it comes with attitude.

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.730
Mom &gt;&gt; Why is it when things get quiet, I
get nervous.

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:30.910
Mom &gt;&gt; How long have you been on that thing?

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:33.629
Mom &gt;&gt; Maybe I'd get an answer if I tweeted
him.

00:00:33.629 --> 00:00:34.480
Son &gt;&gt; [ Sigh ]

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.309
Mom &gt;&gt; It can't be more than a few hours right?

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:38.460
Mom &gt;&gt; How bad can that be?

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.400
Mom &gt;&gt; I mean, he'll probably go blind and
I'll officially be awarded the world's worst

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:42.870
Mom.

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.120
Mom &gt;&gt; Let's think about this ... I mean how
bad can it be really.

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.120
Doctor &gt;&gt; Well it can be pretty bad.

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.430
Doctor &gt;&gt; In the digital age that we live
in, eye strain has become a real concern.

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:55.879
Doctor &gt;&gt; And with more devices around, infiltrating
all hours of the day and night

00:00:55.879 --> 00:00:58.159
Doctor &gt;&gt; It's a problem that impacts all
ages.

00:00:58.159 --> 00:01:02.100
Mom &gt;&gt; Awesome. I'll prepare my worst Mom
award speech.

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.030
Doctor &gt;&gt; Computer eye strain is the number
one computer-related complaint in the US

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.470
Doctor &gt;&gt; ahead of carpal-tunnel and neck
and back pain.

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:11.370
Doctor &gt;&gt; But there are easy ways to combat
digital eye strain.

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:15.030
Doctor &gt;&gt; Like making sure the lighting is
helping your eyes not working against them.

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:17.550
Doctor &gt;&gt; And following the 20 / 20 / 20 rule.

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:20.260
Doctor &gt;&gt; Every 20 minutes give your eyes
a rest

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:22.150
Doctor &gt;&gt; by looking at something 20 feet
away

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:23.150
Doctor &gt;&gt; for 20 seconds.

00:01:23.150 --> 00:01:28.350
Doctor &gt;&gt; At the end of the day, monitoring
the amount of digital usage is key.

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.370
Doctor &gt;&gt; Digital devices can be entertaining
and helpful tools

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:35.150
Doctor &gt;&gt; that don't have to wreak havoc on
your eyes, if used properly.

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:37.810
Mom &gt;&gt; Alright, I can handle that.

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:39.640
Mom &gt;&gt; I think.

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:41.470
[ Mom sets timer ]

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:45.790
Mom &gt;&gt; What are the chances they use those
20 seconds to do their chores?
