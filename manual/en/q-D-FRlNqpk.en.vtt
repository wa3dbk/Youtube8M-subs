Hi, my name is Karl James, owner of Creolesoul
Catering located in Round Rock, TX and on

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:16.290
behalf of Expert Village I'm here to show
you my creole seafood stew. I got my roux

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:22.270
basically to where we want it, it's a medium
tan color like I said we have been working

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:29.671
and working it. I don't want to burn it so
we got it where we want it now. What we are

00:00:29.671 --> 00:00:38.370
going to do is add some stock to it. Now I'm
using a seafood stock and which I told you

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:44.649
earlier you can make your own with those shrimp
shells or fish bones, fish head you want to

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:54.199
boil that with some celery, onions, bell pepper,
garlic and then strain it and you have you

00:00:54.199 --> 00:01:02.090
some nice seafood stock. Or if you can find
it at the store in a can, go for it, if you

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:08.460
can't find seafood stock, chicken stock will
work just fine but like I said we have some

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:21.260
seafood stock. I'm going to pour that in,
just slowly mix as I go cause we want to make

00:01:21.260 --> 00:01:37.189
sure that the roux doesn't clump (I'm making
a mess here) so we put a little bit in and

00:01:37.189 --> 00:01:52.509
mixing it up. The amount of stock that you
use depending on how much you're actually

00:01:52.509 --> 00:02:00.780
making. Oh, by the way if you can't or don't
want to use any stock at all feel free you

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:08.649
can use just plain water. But just make sure
you season it so if you can't find seafood

00:02:08.649 --> 00:02:17.120
stock use chicken stock if you don't want
to go and get any stock at all, well use water.

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:22.840
So what we want to use with this now is get
this to come up to a boil. Now it's at that

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:29.790
point that your roux is really going to start
to kick in with its thickening ability. So

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:34.430
once it starts to boil then you want to turn
that heat down and let it start to simmer

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:39.340
and then it will start to thicken as it goes
along, anyway we'll get this to come to a

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:42.580
boil, get it simmering and I'll see you back
at the next step.
