00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:01.890
Welcome back to my channel!

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:04.870
Today, I am going to do a no makeup ‘makeup’
look.

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:08.231
It’s been a while since I’ve done something
like this, and I thought I would share it

00:00:08.231 --> 00:00:09.880
with you since I’ve been doing it lately.

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:15.750
So, to get started, I am going to prime me
face; with this pore minimizing primer - and

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.289
I really, really do like it!

00:00:17.289 --> 00:00:20.220
I think it keeps my T-zone in check!

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.369
Then, I’m going to follow up with the Loreal
Magic nude foundation with a real techniques

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:33.690
beauty sponge.

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.590
I love this foundation because it goes on
and it looks like skin.

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.090
It looks like my skin, but better.

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.020
But, I’m sad to hear that they are actually
discontinuing it.

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:49.620
So, its back to the drawing board on my favorite
skin looking type of foundation.

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:50.620
But that’s Okay!

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:56.269
I’m going in a warming up my face with this
Jordana 2-in-1 concealer and foundation with

00:00:56.269 --> 00:01:00.940
that same sponge.

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:12.560
Then, I’m going to set my face with the
flawless finish mineral powders from city

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:13.560
color.

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:19.930
You guys know, it’s my all time favorite
powders.

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:29.980
Then I’m going to work on my brows.

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:33.550
So, for everyday, I keep it very natural.

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:37.590
So I’m just going to brush my brow hairs
and I’m going to fill it in using the Nyx

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.650
Micro Pencil in Espresso.

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:44.860
I’m using short strokes, I’m not going
to clean it up or anything.

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:50.039
And I’m basically trying to use the hairs
that I have on my brows to create the illusion

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:52.020
that I have a thicker and fuller brow.

00:01:52.020 --> 00:02:13.050
I’m just adding a little shape and filling
in the areas where I have no hair.

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:16.430
And then, I’ll set all of my hairs in place
with the brow gel.

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:21.900
It’s actually clear, but since I’ve been
dipping it and putting it on my brows and

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.330
dipping back in, it kind of tinted it.

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:25.890
But I don’t mind that at all.

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:29.370
Then, I’m going to curl my lashes with this
nyx lash curler.

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:37.000
I rarely do this, but when I remember, I definitely
do and it does make a huge difference.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:44.069
I’m just going to apply this brown color
into the crease to add the illusion that I

00:02:44.069 --> 00:02:46.409
have a crease, but I’m not adding too much
product.

00:02:46.409 --> 00:02:50.760
Just a quick little dust over.

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:58.599
Then, I’ll go ahead and add my mascara.

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:01.590
This is my favorite mascara from ysl.

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:04.670
And that’s pretty much it for the eyes.

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:10.989
I’m going to take that same brown color
that I used for the crease; lightly contour

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:11.989
my nose.

00:03:11.989 --> 00:03:15.580
Not too much, just a little bit because I
do have a wider nose at the bottom.

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:19.090
And I’ll use my finger to blend it in like
usual.

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:24.120
And to highlight, I’m using my City Color
sunlight trio collection 2 on the high points

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:29.830
of my face to… of course!

00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:33.700
Glow!

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:41.670
Then, to finish off the lips I’m using the
city color lipstick in Kiss me Softly - it’s

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:44.080
my favorite peachy nude color.

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:46.069
And I’m going to apply this, but I didn’t
show a clip.

00:03:46.069 --> 00:03:51.940
I’m just going to use my finger and pat
it into my lips for a more wearable look.

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:58.189
And for the hair, I went in with the herbal
essences naked dry shampoo and it smells amazing

00:03:58.189 --> 00:03:59.739
you guys!

00:03:59.739 --> 00:04:07.470
Now, I’ll usually do a topknot or i’ll
put my hair in a braid on the side… so,

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:09.290
that’s what I did here.

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:12.129
It’s just a messy loose braid.

00:04:12.129 --> 00:04:13.230
And yeah!

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:15.829
