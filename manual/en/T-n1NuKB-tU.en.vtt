Nothing else in there.

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:53.080

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.020
In a moment,

00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:09.639
I'll be discussing the minifigure,

00:02:09.639 --> 00:02:11.249

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:50.769
Here's the sign. I didn't put the sticker on it.

00:02:50.769 --> 00:02:52.129
It's suppose to have a dynamite sticker on it

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:54.419
for explosives.

00:02:54.419 --> 00:03:01.419

to break open this rock.

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:20.779
to break open this rock.

00:03:20.779 --> 00:03:24.839
This is hollow. We just simply open this up,

00:03:24.839 --> 00:03:27.379
and we do get some studs

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:29.719
and you also get two gold elements that look like gold.

00:03:29.719 --> 00:03:34.689

00:03:58.389 --> 00:04:00.669
I like the bumper,

00:04:00.669 --> 00:04:01.939
tires.

00:04:01.939 --> 00:04:05.559

00:04:07.769 --> 00:04:11.089
You also got the holder bricks for the jackhammer

00:04:11.089 --> 00:04:16.069
and the pickaxe, and the top of the cab does open up

00:04:16.069 --> 00:04:19.040
so you can seat a mini-fig.

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:21.259
You also have a steering wheel.

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:23.169
And the top of the cab can be easily replaced.

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:26.580

Also we can take our

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:41.389
container full tools, we can set this back here in the bed.

00:04:41.389 --> 00:04:44.639
It snaps in place so it doesn't fall out.

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:46.919
Now I'm not sure if this is a good way to transport dynamite,

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:49.840
Now I'm not sure if this is a good way to transport dynamite,

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:51.349
but we can go with that.

00:04:51.349 --> 00:04:55.770
It does roll free.

00:04:55.770 --> 00:05:00.680
Very good vehicle.

00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:03.080

The Mining 4x4 is a great set

00:05:18.509 --> 00:05:20.169
The Mining 4x4 is a great set

00:05:20.169 --> 00:05:24.239
to add to an existing Lego City mining theme,

00:05:24.239 --> 00:05:27.259
or to your Lego collection.

00:05:27.259 --> 00:05:28.729
It's very easy to build. Fun to construct.

00:05:28.729 --> 00:05:32.499
It's very easy to build. Fun to construct.

00:05:32.499 --> 00:05:36.590
