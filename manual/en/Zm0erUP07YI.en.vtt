00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:10.740
A great looking finish begins with
the right start.

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:15.029
Following the proper prep procedure will
dramatically affect the look and

00:00:15.029 --> 00:00:17.890
longevity of your finished project.

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:21.510
If applying porch and patio floor paint
on a wood deck surface,

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.040
use a product such as Behr Premium
number 63

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:27.560
All-In-One Wood Cleaner.

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:31.550
This cleaner is specifically formulated
to clean and brighten wood surfaces,

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:34.230
as well as, remove mildew stains.

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.879
Wet surface with water prior to
cleaning. Apply solution liberally with a

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:39.760
pump sprayer,

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:45.090
brush, mop or roller. Keep the surface
completely wet with solution for 10 to

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:46.170
15 minutes.

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:50.210
Scrub the surface using a stiff bristled
broom or brush,

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:55.230
the solution will foam. After scrubbing,
rinse thoroughly with water at normal

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:55.850
pressure

00:00:55.850 --> 00:01:01.230
or use a pressure washer at low setting
500 to 1200 PSI.

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.390
Let surface dry, then, lightly sand any
loose wood fibers with medium grit

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:07.479
sandpaper.

00:01:07.479 --> 00:01:12.520
Your surface is now ready to be primed.
For interior wood application,

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:18.060
use a product, such as Behr Premium Plus
number 75 Stain-Blocking Primer Sealer.

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:23.590
For exterior wood application, use a
product, such as Behr Premium Plus number

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:27.950
436 Multi-Surface Primer and
Sealer.

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:32.119
To apply, use a high-quality 3/8 to 1/2
inch nap roller cover,

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:35.479
nylon-polyester brush or an airless
sprayer.

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:38.960
Use the appropriate spread rate per
gallon.

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:43.630
Stir occasionally, do not thin if using a
roller or brush.

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:48.130
However, if using a sprayer and thinning
is required, thin with up to one-half a

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:51.280
pint of water per gallon of primer.

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:54.370
Heavy stains may require two coats.

00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:58.310
The primer will dry to touch in 30
minutes and will be ready to topcoat in

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:59.080
one hour.

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:05.120
Use this product when air and surface
temperatures are between 50°-90° F.

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.240
Easy clean-up with soap and water.

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:11.620
Now that the surface is clean, prepped

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.800
and primed, it is time to apply the
topcoat.

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.400
Please follow all label instructions.
