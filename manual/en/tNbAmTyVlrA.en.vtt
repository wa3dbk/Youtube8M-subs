00:00:00.526 --> 00:00:03.186
&gt;&gt; I just feel healthier and happier.

00:00:03.186 --> 00:00:06.666
&gt;&gt; It sort of gave me hope that
I could actually lose weight.

00:00:06.666 --> 00:00:08.596
&gt;&gt; It's not that big of a thing.

00:00:08.596 --> 00:00:09.976
You just have to work on it.

00:00:15.046 --> 00:00:17.796
&gt;&gt; Well, we teach our tools to
make these changes in your eating

00:00:17.796 --> 00:00:19.736
and exercise habits for the long term.

00:00:19.736 --> 00:00:23.566
&gt;&gt; It's a behavior-change program that
teaches families how to make healthy choices.

00:00:24.016 --> 00:00:26.336
&gt;&gt; These are life tools, so we teach budgeting.

00:00:26.336 --> 00:00:27.516
We teach planning.

00:00:27.776 --> 00:00:30.426
We teach overcoming obstacles
to meeting your goals.

00:00:30.426 --> 00:00:35.246
&gt;&gt; We really encourage both parent and child
to work together as a team in the program.

00:00:35.246 --> 00:00:38.776
&gt;&gt; We ask them to journal what they
eat, and eventually, when they exercise.

00:00:38.926 --> 00:00:42.636
And we also ask if they are
ready and open to change.

00:00:42.996 --> 00:00:47.436
&gt;&gt; They don't give you rules
in how to categorize foods.

00:00:47.436 --> 00:00:50.186
Instead, they just give you
guidelines of how to look at foods.

00:00:50.496 --> 00:00:52.166
&gt;&gt; So all foods red, yellow, or green,

00:00:52.166 --> 00:00:55.766
and the goal of the program
is to reduce your red lights.

00:00:55.876 --> 00:01:03.146
&gt;&gt; They taught me that a lot of the foods that I
was eating were really unhealthy and fattening.

00:01:03.456 --> 00:01:03.886
&gt;&gt; White bread.

00:01:03.886 --> 00:01:05.146
I can't eat white bread anymore.

00:01:05.146 --> 00:01:09.776
&gt;&gt; So kids will set goals around how many
red lights they're going to eat each week,

00:01:10.066 --> 00:01:13.966
and as they meet their goals,
they slowly reduce them over time.

00:01:14.046 --> 00:01:19.006
&gt;&gt; Because the kids are so involved in
tracking their own eating and exercise

00:01:19.006 --> 00:01:20.576
and setting their own goals, they kind of --

00:01:20.606 --> 00:01:22.846
the program kind of takes it
out of the parents' hands.

00:01:23.296 --> 00:01:24.426
And that's a huge relief.

00:01:24.586 --> 00:01:26.706
&gt;&gt; And then we start talking
about incorporating exercise.

00:01:26.706 --> 00:01:28.886
&gt;&gt; I definitely started doing more exercise.

00:01:28.886 --> 00:01:30.816
I found more sports that I like.

00:01:30.816 --> 00:01:36.046
&gt;&gt; I like jumping on the trampoline with
my dad because he makes me bounce so high.

00:01:36.476 --> 00:01:39.446
&gt;&gt; We made sure, as a family,
that every morning,

00:01:40.266 --> 00:01:42.576
one of us was walking the kids to school.

00:01:42.806 --> 00:01:48.586
&gt;&gt; A month into the program, a
light bulb just started shining,

00:01:48.586 --> 00:01:51.026
and Sean Patrick started changing his ways.

00:01:51.026 --> 00:01:53.696
&gt;&gt; You learn you're not the only one like that.

00:01:53.696 --> 00:01:56.706
A lot of other kids think that about themselves.

00:01:56.756 --> 00:02:02.066
&gt;&gt; The program not only helped her, but helped
the whole family in eating much healthier.

00:02:02.306 --> 00:02:06.676
&gt;&gt; It's really about how to eat healthy
and being more physical in your life.

00:02:07.116 --> 00:02:11.636
&gt;&gt; Learning how to build and enhance your life.

00:02:12.106 --> 00:02:16.736
&gt;&gt; Families come to -- come to us
and say you've saved our lives.

00:02:16.736 --> 00:02:18.406
You've changed our lives.

00:02:18.906 --> 00:02:24.726
&gt;&gt; After I did the program, I thought, wow, if
I could do this and feel confident about myself

00:02:24.726 --> 00:02:27.966
after it, then other people
who are shy can do it, too.
