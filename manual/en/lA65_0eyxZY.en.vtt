00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:12.060
The Shell Eco-marathon is unique.

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:15.150
I know of no other program
that brings

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:16.420
in the Americas alone,

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:18.780
1,200 students together every year

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.870
to tackle the exciting challenges

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:25.720
associated with energy, mobility,
with the future of cars...

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.390
We're moving to a point
where we want options.

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:34.000
We might not want an electric car

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:35.120
or a gasoline car.

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:36.330
We might want a car

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.240
that operates on both types of fuel.

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.390
At Shell, it's great to be supported
by our top leadership,

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:43.780
to have very innovative,
wide thinking.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.210
And in my role, I look at
the integration of everything,

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:51.360
so the Eco-marathon
is one of the examples.

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.210
It's an interesting way

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:54.780
to be a catalyst -

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.870
getting all these companies together.

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:02.120
Our objective today
is to look at this urban nexus

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:03.240
of people,

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:05.570
mobility and technology

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:08.480
and specifically how
they are coming together in Detroit.

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:09.600
I have

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:12.450
to commend Shell
for making this happen

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.240
because without this catalyst,

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:16.360
the subsequent conversations

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:19.270
and ideas and innovations
would not have happened.

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.000
It's a massive event.

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:25.600
I've been blown away

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:27.510
by the scale of this event,

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:30.030
the sheer number of competitors...

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:33.000
We have over 1,000 students here -

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:34.180
over 120 teams

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:36.000
from over 100 schools...

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:37.450
Many members of the public

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:38.690
have come down here.

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:41.240
Of course
this is a great media draw, as well.

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.450
Lots of media
want to cover this event.

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:45.660
So there are any number
of opportunities

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:47.750
to tell any number of stories.

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:50.330
It's fun.
They have a bunch of fun activities.

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.000
They have soccer
and a bunch of stuff going on.

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:55.180
- Oh, that's cool.
- They have lots of stuff.

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:58.570
- It will be great. It will be fun.
- I'll check it out. Thank you.

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.060
Now this is your weekend.

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.150
It's your weekend to prove to us

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:08.510
what this next generation of
innovators and leaders looks like.

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:11.780
It was actually a lot of fun
being able to start from scratch -

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.060
brand-new vehicles...

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:14.510
It was a learning experience.

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:16.240
You want to improve.

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:18.060
That's what we all want to do.

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.870
These young people are applying their
creativity in a real hands-on way

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:23.630
to actually build a real product

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:27.510
and compete that product
right here on the streets of Detroit.

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:29.810
I don't know
many other programs like that.

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:33.510
This is why I'm so grateful
for Marvin and Shell for doing this.

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:36.660
The team came in
to pitch me the Eco-marathon.

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:39.030
It took about 30 seconds.

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.210
I said, "You don't need a long pitch.
We're all the way in."

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.000
I think it's just
a tremendous program

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:47.690
to inspire our young talent,

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:50.210
and that Shell has created
this great program

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:52.330
and has promoted it
for a number of years

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:55.660
with such a wide variety
of individuals, is just outstanding.

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:59.390
Detroit is becoming once again
the icon and the centerpiece

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:01.780
for innovation
for mobility going forward.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.540
Detroit is reinventing itself.

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:07.390
It's a great time to be part
of that reinvention for us at Shell,

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:10.390
and it's a great time to be part
of working with our OEMs

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:11.510
in this town.

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:14.570
Oh, it's such a big deal.

00:03:14.690 --> 00:03:15.750
Stuff like this shows

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:17.750
Detroit is alive and growing.

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:18.870
It's a lot of work,

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:20.090
not a lot of sleep,

00:03:20.210 --> 00:03:21.480
but it's worth it.

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:26.120
We have a constant demand for bright,
young, technically minded people

00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:28.390
to work on our projects
all over the world.

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:31.450
And an event like this
is a great proving ground

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:33.450
for that kind of skill set.

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:36.570
We had a lot of fun this year
and we're excited to come back.

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:40.480
Next year is going to be awesome.
