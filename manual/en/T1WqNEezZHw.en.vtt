i test today for the iPhone 6 or 6 plus the case Artwizz

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:09.620
Because i had the feeling after 1 week of using the iphone that i feels a little bit slippery when using without a case.

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:17.920
for sure when you use it with one hand it gets really slippery.

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:28.020
you have the option with the double tap on the home button to use it with one hand but it doesnt feel save all the time.

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:54.600
it feels very elastic.

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:58.620
the case is bendable.

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:03.580
beamless.

00:01:11.975 --> 00:01:15.815
it is a little bit thicker i think about 0.6 mm

00:01:20.921 --> 00:01:25.481
it has all the holes for the charge jack and camera.

00:01:47.373 --> 00:01:50.093
it looks really classy in beamless black

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:54.440
it feels much saver in the hand then before.

00:02:04.194 --> 00:02:08.834
the only thing is when you turn it in one hand...

00:02:09.954 --> 00:02:15.074
the edge concedes a little bit.. 

00:02:23.493 --> 00:02:28.653
the price in comparison to the quality is very good. the price is around 10-15 â‚¬

00:02:40.354 --> 00:02:44.374
all in all a very good quality and the iphone feels save in this case.

00:02:45.954 --> 00:02:52.574
