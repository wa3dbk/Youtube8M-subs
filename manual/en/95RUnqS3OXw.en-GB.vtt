Heather Nicholds: Hey guys this is Heather
from healthy eating starts here. Now sprouts

00:00:05.009 --> 00:00:11.500
are amazing, they have a ton of nutrition
in them, but they are only useful if you actually

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:16.640
eat them. And a lot of people will buy or
grow sprouts and then have no idea what to

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:17.640
do with them.

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:23.020
So the easiest thing to do with sprouts is
to put them in a smoothie. All you do is blend

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:29.240
them up with some fruits, whatever else you
like and those sprouts will blend up and mix

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.180
in and you’ll barely even notice them.

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:38.120
So what I am going to show is a very simple
smoothie that I make on a very regular basis

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:46.000
and it uses a ton of sprouts. So all you do
is get a blender and I like to use frozen

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.450
bananas, so I just have a bag of bananas in
my freezer that I keep in there for making

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:54.060
smoothies.

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:57.930
And then what happens is I can buy a big bunch
of bananas, let them get ripe, peel them;

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:03.680
stick them in the freezer, all ready to go
for smoothies. And then I have some frozen

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:10.889
berries as well. I really like blueberries
in smoothies, although any type of berry you

00:01:10.889 --> 00:01:17.299
want to use is fantastic, raspberries, blackberries,
strawberries whatever you like. There is also

00:01:17.299 --> 00:01:22.929
frozen mango, frozen cherries, all that stuff
is fantastic, okay.

00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:29.340
So that’s my fruit base and then I am also
going to put in some fresh ginger. I love

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:35.929
ginger, it is warming, so in the winter if
you are having smoothies it can be kind of

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:41.710
cooling and ginger can help offset that. Another
thing is in the summer I love having smoothies

00:01:41.710 --> 00:01:47.529
for breakfast but in the winter it gets a
little cold in the morning so I usually have

00:01:47.529 --> 00:01:53.609
them in the afternoon which is when I am the
warmest and when the temperature tends to

00:01:53.609 --> 00:01:54.609
be the warmest.

00:01:54.609 --> 00:02:00.619
So I am just cutting the skin off of that
ginger and cutting it into little chunks so

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:07.770
that it blends up nicely. Put those in the
blender along with some sprouts. So I have

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:16.120
a large bunch here and I am going to use about
half of this because I love sprouts, but you

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.950
can use however much you want.

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:25.569
As a little side note, alfalfa sprouts, which
I am using today, fantastic! But, not fantastic

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:32.070
for everybody. They can aggravate arthritis
and joint inflammation for some people. So

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:37.879
an easy alternative is to use red clover sprouts.
They are just as easy to make and I have a

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:42.189
video on how to grow your own sprouts that
you can check out for more info on that.

00:02:42.189 --> 00:02:47.860
And these kinds of things, healthy foods that
may not be good for everyone is something

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:54.159
that I love to consult and give recommendations
on. So I am super excited because I am getting

00:02:54.159 --> 00:03:00.159
the last pieces together for getting back
into doing online nutrition consultations

00:03:00.159 --> 00:03:05.550
and one-on-one follow-ups with you guys, but
I would love to know what you guys are interested

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:06.550
in.

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:13.550
I have kind of four ideas of support and consultations
that I want to do. So I’ll put a link to

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:17.330
more info on that and if you guys can give
me your feedback, I would really, really appreciate

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:22.159
it, because I am doing it for you. So yeah,
that’s that.

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:27.239
Alright, now to our smoothie I am also going
to add some ground flax which is lovely for

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:34.769
omega-3. Now I put water to make my smoothie
go round. You can also use any kind of non-dairy

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:41.040
milk you like; almond milk, coconut milk,
hemp milk,what other kinds of milks are there,

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.109
soy milk, whatever you like.

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:50.040
So I like to put a lot of water in here as
well. So I am going to put about three cups

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:57.469
I think in here, no two cups, two cups, there
we go. And I am fantastically lucky because

00:03:57.469 --> 00:04:01.239
the water that comes out of my tap is rainwater.
So I don't have to worry about filtering it,

00:04:01.239 --> 00:04:04.469
but if you are living in a city where there
is chlorine, you probably want to do some

00:04:04.469 --> 00:04:07.189
filtered water for your smoothie.

00:04:07.189 --> 00:04:13.599
Then, this is going to get complicated now.
You put the top on, put it on to the blender

00:04:13.599 --> 00:04:20.220
and press start. Think you can handle it?
I think you can handle it. Alright! A minute

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:26.560
or so on the blender and I have the smoothie.
Easy-peasy, right? So all you do, you can

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:29.690
drink from the blender; I have done it, I’m
not gonna lie.

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:40.520
Put in a glass. The only thing that makes
this better is drinking it with a glass straw.

00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:46.920
So good! If you have not tried a smoothie
with fresh ginger, highly recommended. But

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:52.450
other thing that would be fantastic in here,
fresh basil, I love putting that with blueberries

00:04:52.450 --> 00:04:56.612
and ginger in a smoothie, so tasty!

00:04:56.612 --> 00:05:01.080
Alright! So, I hope you enjoy your smoothie.
You can of course add anything you like. A

00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:05.700
smoothie is out of one of the most versatile
things you can make and I would love to hear

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:11.380
what you put in your smoothies, so leave me
a comment below and let me know. And I will

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:16.920
keep you posted on those online consultations
that I’m putting together. Yay! Okay, see

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:17.520
you guys.
