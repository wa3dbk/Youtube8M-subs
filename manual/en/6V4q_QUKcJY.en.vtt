Hi Fashionsistas welcome this week episode
of Ask Marina, todays question comes from

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:14.960
Marina from Italy oh Hi Marina.

00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:23.119
So Marina asks “over the past year my hair
has turned very oily i have to wash it every

00:00:23.119 --> 00:00:25.940
two days, do you have any tips to control
this?”

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:31.660
So the first thing I will probably say is
that you are probably using some products

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:38.290
on your hair that may be causing oil build
up some products take a lot longer to like

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:43.110
wash out of your hair than others, so if you
have changed a product you know the last you’ve

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:46.430
been using something new id stop using that
completely and maybe go back to what you were

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:48.300
using before that worked for you.

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:53.739
Oil build up can be caused by many things,
so one thing is if you are not shampooing

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:59.300
your hair properly so you know i personally
double shampoo if got a lot of product in

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.399
my hair, i do it twice but also when you are
rinsing out your hair so it’s sometimes

00:01:03.399 --> 00:01:08.670
oil build up is shampoo and conditioner that
hasn’t been rinsed out properly.

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:13.549
So they say an average of the minimum you
should spend in rinsing out your hair is thirty

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:17.250
seconds i personally probably spend about
a minute or two doing that just to make sure

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:21.520
everything is out i always run my fingers
through especially around the hair line cos

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:25.130
i think that’s somewhere you could always
miss and at the back of your head as well

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:28.660
so just making sure you are getting you know
all that shampoo and conditioner out.

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:34.119
Another thing to do is when you are rinsing
your hair is not to use really hot water,

00:01:34.119 --> 00:01:39.619
you are actually supposed to use luke warm
water even cold if you can as cold water helps

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:41.850
close up the cuticles of your hair.

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.840
You have to think of your hair like your skin
its actually uses skin cos it is skin so you

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.840
know its sensitive, it has pores and if you
are not treating it like your skin then of

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.820
course it’s gonna you know it’s not going
to produce the right amount of oil it might

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:59.770
be dehydrated on the ends and oily on the
roots so you really need to be taking care

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:00.770
of it.

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:05.439
Another thing you can do is to stop using
the blow dryer on your air, heat actually

00:02:05.439 --> 00:02:10.840
activates and stimulate your scalp to produce
more oil so if you wanted to take a break

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.610
maybe from the hair dryer just to see if that
might help as well just to get your hair back

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:19.110
to where it was and then maybe you can start
introducing the heat again.

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:23.290
Another thing is to make sure that you are
using like a clarifying treatment or shampoo

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:27.970
at least twice a month that’s gonna really
scrape out any buildup of product in your

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:31.030
hair that might be causing that buildup of
oil for you as well.

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:37.760
And that’s pretty much everything that i
do I know that if I change products in my

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.661
hair or if I’m not rinsing it properly or
if I’m using a new shampoo i noticed that

00:02:41.661 --> 00:02:45.150
my hair can be oily, it’s just really a
trial and error thing so you it’s easily

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:51.070
to be kind of like aware of what you know
what products are causing build up what aren’t

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:54.870
or what dehydrating your hair you just pay
attention to what works.

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:59.120
If you do want to stretch out your hair a
bit in terms of washing it and you don’t

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:03.879
want to be washing it every two days you can
use something like a dry shampoo or even baby

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:07.080
powder so just pop in a bit of baby powder
in your hair that’s gonna really soak up

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:11.690
all the excess oil just to stretch it out
extra day i find that it really helps especially

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:15.489
if I’ve had a busy week and i don’t have
time to go and get my hair done or do it myself

00:03:15.489 --> 00:03:19.250
i have baby powder in my handbag as well as
dry shampoo it’s just depending on where

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:24.200
i am i actually like to use baby powder more
than the spray, i just prefer it, i think

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:28.760
cause that was what i use before dry shampoo
really existed so I’m just used to it so

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:32.819
you can do either of those and just pop that
in your hair and just give that extra volume

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:35.140
and just soak up that oil as well.

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:39.840
