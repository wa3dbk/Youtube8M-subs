00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:09.400
This question came in from Facebook -- from
Paul and Janet Barrow, who must be parents,

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:13.260
and they say, considering the difficulty of
getting a job these days, and the amount of

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:19.349
student debt that you would accumulate, is
it really worth going to university at all?

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:20.660
I think so.

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:23.000
But maybe not for everyone.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:30.970
I think the greatest gift parents can give
their children is an education.

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:36.980
I think an education - if you spend the money,
and the person has the ambition, and they

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:44.079
learn how to use their mind, they will find
the path -- it may not be there from day one

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:46.329
-- but you'll eventually find that path.

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:52.469
I don't look back at all the debt I incurred
in getting an education with one day of regret.

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:57.050
And it took me over a decade to pay it back.

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:58.909
But I never regretted it.

00:00:58.909 --> 00:01:03.280
Are families frightened of the debt that's
left at the end of a university degree now,

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.180
with tuition fees as well as your maintenance
costs?

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:13.299
So -- I'm sure they are, the numbers, when
you look at them in aggregate are quite scary.

00:01:13.299 --> 00:01:17.329
But I think this is why we have to put it
in the context that -- everybody's circumstances

00:01:17.329 --> 00:01:21.520
are entirely individual and you've got to
do whatever the right thing for you is.

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:26.280
And it is of course partly a financial decision,
but it's also a much broader decision about

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.930
what you want out of your life.

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.659
And I think if you boil it down to a simple
'do I want to end up with this level of student

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:37.579
debt, or not?' you're going to miss the wider
benefits of potentially broadening your education.

00:01:37.579 --> 00:01:40.990
Tracey: I mean what we've got to consider
now, is that going to university is one of

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:43.689
the major financial decisions that we'll make
in our life.

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:49.049
So -- I would say, make that-- make it almost
a business decision: sit down, write down,

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:53.219
figure out why you're doing it and then have
the confidence to go ahead once you know you've

00:01:53.219 --> 00:01:54.289
made the right decision.

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:58.820
I think it's worth mentioning as well -- it's
much talked about isn't it, it's a really

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:01.810
tough world for young people to go out and
find work today.

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:03.490
That is absolutely undeniable.

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:09.110
Nevertheless, I think still about fifty per
cent of graduates leaving university -- are

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:13.530
still ending up in graduate level jobs, with
all the career potential -- if that's what

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:14.780
people want- that comes with that.

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:18.260
Alvin: I'm going to tell you all something,
I think, will amuse you.

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:24.400
So I went to this very prestigious school
in America -- a Junior Ivy League school -- and

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:28.990
when I go out it was in the nineteen seventies
(I hate that phrase!)

00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:30.720
I couldn't get a job.

00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.100
I literally could not get a job.

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:40.660
There was a huge recession -- my first job
was -- selling furs in Florida.

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:44.690
From selling furs in Florida to today!

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:48.500
You never know where things are going to lead,
and people say "people bought furs in Florida?"

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:53.170
I was good at that job, I could sell furs
to those ladies on Miami beach -- like that.
