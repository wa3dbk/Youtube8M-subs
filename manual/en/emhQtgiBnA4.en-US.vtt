00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:06.200
- They're using long sleeves. Warm up, what
are we doing here? Give me some scissors.

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:07.700
Cut the sleeves!

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:14.700
We're going to play eight against eight, attack
against defence, right?

00:00:14.700 --> 00:00:17.200
The guy went with you, Ralf came get it back.

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:22.200
Close it down at the back. One goes on, the other comes off, OK?

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:23.200
Close it down at the back. One goes on, the other comes off, OK?

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.200
I'm going to have to work on my ball skills.

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.200
Go on, keep going!

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:34.200
That's the way. Always between the full back and the guy playing in front of the defence.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.900
He's going, he's going. Sprint, there, look!

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:40.000
He has to be quick or the defender will be back to cover.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.800
Who's going to provide cover? It's going to be you. You're in that zone.

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.800
He goes with you and he's try to get the ball off you. The first one to make a mistake is the first one to come off.

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.000
Yeah, close, yeah...

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:55.700
We've got to back up the full back. It's the midfield that gives him the confidence to overlap.

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:58.000
Here, you're going to impose yourself up front Paolo.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000
Go on Rodrigiunho!

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.000
That's the way!

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.800
Come deeper to hit it sometimes.

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:10.700
Turn round and then come in to the penalty spot.

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.000
If I get inside, you'll not get me.

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.700
Get the ball! Come on! Come on!

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:19.900
There has to be two options.

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:26.000
Up front, you're up front, you can't always lay it off. Sometimes you have to hit it.

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.800
Don't play with your back to the ball, get side on.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.700
Let's see some effort! Go with him! Come on!

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:39.000
You hit a bad pass, you make a mistake, everyone makes mistakes.

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.000
That's way! That's way!

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:45.000
Beautiful!

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:48.000
Everyone here has great technique.

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:52.700
Go on, put it away. That's it!

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:54.500
Give it to him, play the ball.

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:55.500
In that position...

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.500
When the attacker is with Ralf, then yes, both full backs can attack at the same time.

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:03.000
When we do that in a game you'll remember we've done it on the training pitch.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.500
You give it a quick flick, Romarinho goes one way, and you're away.

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.500
Ralf's there and you're here.

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.700
Deeper. Look, Ralf's further forward.

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:16.700
There's not enough players in front of the ball.

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.000
Have a go at them again. Ok?

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.200
Tight, make it hard for them, close up at the back.

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:27.700
Hold on, Rodriguinho, get involved.Two of you.

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:28.700
Hold on, Rodriguinho, get involved.Two of you.

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.000
Now. Inside, inside!

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:31.600
Nice!
