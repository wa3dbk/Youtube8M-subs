00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.900
NARRATOR: The fall waterfowl migration

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.900
is one of Missouri’s most
spectacular natural events.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.900
Biologist Andy Raedecke gets
the privilege of seeing

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.900
this phenomenon from a unique
aerial perspective during

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.400
the Conservation Department’s
annual waterfowl survey.

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:19.500
Andy: There’s really
two primary purposes.

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.600
The one is to see the timing
of when ducks

00:00:21.700 --> 00:00:22.900
and geese come into Missouri.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:24.900
We use that information 
for setting hunting regulations

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.900
and also just knowing in general
the chronology

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:30.900
of when ducks and geese arrive.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.900
The other reason we do the survey

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.400
is to monitor the habitat
conditions in Missouri.

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.900
We have restored lots of wetlands 
in the past ten or twenty years.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.900
We want to find out where ducks
and geese are using wetlands

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.900
and what types of wetlands
they are using.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.900
NARRATOR: The information gained
on the aerial survey

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.900
helps to better manage
Missouri’s wetlands.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.900
(duck calls)

00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.900
Eric: They’re coming!
They’re coming around behind.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.900
They’re dropping.
Right over the top.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:07.900
(duck calls)

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.900
When the ducks lock up, you know,
they cup their wings

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.900
and that’s when
they are fully committed

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.900
and they’ll come
right into the decoys.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:15.900
And at that point your mind’s
racing a mile a minute,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.900
the heart is racing
and you are trying to focus.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.900
There is a lot of excitement
going on in your body

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.900
and yet at the same time
you get really calm

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.900
and you focus on the ducks.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.400
(whispers) Get that.
(gun shots)

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.900
Nice shot, nice shot.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.900
Fetch it up, Buckley.

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.500
Good girl, Buckley

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:37.000
Anytime you go duck hunting,

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:38.900
especially when you know
it’s going to be a good day,

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.900
you know, you get excited,
your heart gets to pumping.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.500
It’s just good to be out
in the outdoors.

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:45.500
You know if you do your homework
and know where to go,

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.100
there are some really good
hunting opportunities in Missouri.

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.900
(gun shots)

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:52.500
- Nice Shot.

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.500
NARRATOR: And in the skies
above Missouri’s wetlands,

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:57.500
biologists are working together
with skilled pilots

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:00.900
to assess the effectiveness
of these important ecosystems,

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.900
essential parts of Missouri’s
natural heritage.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.900
In the process they are getting
a unique look at one

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.900
of the things that makes Missouri
special, the fall migration.
