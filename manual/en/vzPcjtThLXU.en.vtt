00:00:00.315 --> 00:00:02.440
Welcome back to this Global
Health YouTube channel.

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:04.320
My name is Greg Martin,
and in this episode

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:05.885
we're going to talk about money.

00:00:05.885 --> 00:00:07.260
So if you're
looking for funding,

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:08.884
be it for a public
health intervention,

00:00:08.884 --> 00:00:10.954
for technical support,
or for a research project

00:00:10.954 --> 00:00:13.412
perhaps, or even a scholarship
to study further, stay tuned

00:00:13.412 --> 00:00:15.328
and we're going to talk
about how to get that.

00:00:15.328 --> 00:00:17.930
Now, raising money
is a gargantuan topic

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:21.026
and can't be covered entirely
in a short five minute video.

00:00:21.026 --> 00:00:23.400
So I'm going to divide this
up into a number of episodes,

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.316
which we'll put together
in a playlist that'll

00:00:25.316 --> 00:00:27.030
be on YouTube channel page.

00:00:27.030 --> 00:00:29.440
So this is episode
one, an introduction.

00:00:29.440 --> 00:00:31.690
And we're going to talk about
how funding agencies are

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:34.150
structured, and about
the life cycle of funding

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:35.430
decision-making.

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.740
Firstly, to quickly
exonerate myself

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:40.240
from any undue chastisement,
let me be clear,

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:41.850
I am not a professional
fundraiser,

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.800
and I'm not an expert.

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.525
That said, I have worked for
two major funding agencies.

00:00:46.525 --> 00:00:48.415
I've worked for
UNITAID at the WHO,

00:00:48.415 --> 00:00:50.790
and they fund interventions
aimed at impacting the market

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:53.079
dynamics for products
for HIV, TB, and malaria.

00:00:53.079 --> 00:00:55.120
And I've worked at the
World Cancer Research Fund

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:56.900
where I was the head
of science research

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:58.230
and oversaw a grant program.

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.477
I've also worked in roles
where identifying funding

00:01:00.477 --> 00:01:01.560
was a big part of the job.

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:04.126
So, for example, I worked
as the director of EMTCT

00:01:04.126 --> 00:01:05.750
at the Clinton Health
Access Initiative

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:06.810
where I was working
with funders,

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.476
and that was the major
part of my arena.

00:01:08.476 --> 00:01:11.146
So how do funding agencies work?

00:01:11.146 --> 00:01:12.520
Well, to start
with, most of them

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:14.540
are governed by a
board of directors,

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:16.709
and they oversee the
governance of the organization,

00:01:16.709 --> 00:01:18.375
and sign off on broad
funding strategies

00:01:18.375 --> 00:01:20.380
that the organization
undertakes.

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:22.830
Next, you usually
have a secretariat,

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.770
and they are the
full-time staff,

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:27.600
and it's their remit to
implement the strategies

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.072
and decisions
taken by the board.

00:01:29.072 --> 00:01:31.280
And these are the nuts and
bolts of the organization.

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:32.696
These will be the
people with whom

00:01:32.696 --> 00:01:34.370
you interact on a
day-to-day basis.

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:37.580
Some funding agencies have an
additional technical advisory

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:40.390
panel, and they don't work
for the agency per se,

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:42.500
but they convene
periodically to evaluate

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:44.920
the technical and scientific
validity of funding

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.490
applications, and they provide
technical and expert advice.

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:48.990
Right.

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:52.477
Now let's talk about
process, the funding cycle.

00:01:52.477 --> 00:01:54.310
Most organizations will
have a board meeting

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:55.560
at least once or twice a year.

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.400
And at that point, they
take decisions as to,

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.710
in broad strokes, what it
is that they want to fund.

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:04.340
Now, this is important to know,
because most organizations will

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.640
publish a strategy
document, and that

00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:10.000
outlines their objectives
and their goals for the year.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.716
So get hold of that document.

00:02:12.716 --> 00:02:14.840
It's likely to be a chunky,
clumsy document, filled

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:16.490
with garrulous
platitudes designed

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:18.200
to mollycoddle their
own stakeholders.

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.110
Remember, even funding agencies
get money from somewhere.

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:24.350
But buried somewhere
in the gaudy noise

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:26.004
of self-aggrandizing
piffle, you'll

00:02:26.004 --> 00:02:28.170
find there's a few paragraphs
that actually tell you

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.253
what they're looking for
in a funding application.

00:02:30.253 --> 00:02:32.290
If your proposal
doesn't line up neatly

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.060
with their stated
objectives, you're

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:36.820
not going to get any money no
matter how good your idea is.

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:38.500
So what happens next?

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:39.920
Well, the secretariat
will publish

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:41.600
either a call for
finding applications,

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:44.340
or a call for letters of intent.

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:47.160
Now, these letters of intent are
basically a screening process.

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:48.320
Afterwards, the
organization will

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:50.695
invite applicants who are more
or less on the right track

00:02:50.695 --> 00:02:51.860
to submit a full proposal.

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:53.860
In either event, there'll
be a definite deadline

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:56.400
at which point you need to have
your application submitted.

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:58.270
Once you've submitted
your application,

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:00.770
the process is relatively
straightforward.

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:02.250
They'll either
review it internally

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:04.707
or send it to their
technical experts to review.

00:03:04.707 --> 00:03:06.290
And there might be
some back and forth

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:08.220
and some requests for revisions.

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:10.661
But at some point, however,
the secretariat or the board

00:03:10.661 --> 00:03:12.410
will take a decision
as to whether they're

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:13.920
going to fund your
project or not.

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.280
If they're going to
fund your project,

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:16.460
then you'll start
the arduous process

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:18.660
of drawing up a memorandum
of understanding, which

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:20.970
is essentially an agreement
between your organization

00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:22.720
and the funding
organization that outlines

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:25.605
the schedule of payment, and
corresponding deliverables.

00:03:25.605 --> 00:03:28.200
Now, sometimes
interim payments are

00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:31.040
contingent on certain
milestones being reached.

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:33.330
And quite often, a mid-term
review of the project

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:35.371
is scheduled to check that
things are rolling out

00:03:35.371 --> 00:03:36.160
according to plan.

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:40.020
The take-home message here is
understand the funding agency's

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:41.200
objective.

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:44.330
And then get your proposal
either in line with them,

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:46.320
or cross them off
your list and find

00:03:46.320 --> 00:03:48.674
a donor who you more
naturally align with.

00:03:48.674 --> 00:03:50.840
Now, that can be difficult,
especially if you've got

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.210
an idea that's genuinely
novel or out-of-the-box,

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:56.090
but we'll talk about how to deal
with that in a future episode.

00:03:56.090 --> 00:03:57.470
In the next video
in this series,

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:59.560
we're going to talk about the
actual business plan and budget

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:00.800
that you're going to
need to put together.

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.580
And in future
episodes we're going

00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:05.066
to talk about how to develop
a fundraising strategy.

00:04:05.066 --> 00:04:06.690
We'll start to look
at specific funders

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:08.565
and try to understand
a little bit about what

00:04:08.565 --> 00:04:10.060
it is that they're looking for.

00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:11.059
So that's all for now.

00:04:11.059 --> 00:04:13.350
Please put your thoughts,
ideas, suggestions, comments,

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:16.370
pontifications, and questions
in the comment section below.

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:17.800
I really appreciate
your feedback,

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:19.036
and I'm going to try and
respond to all the comments

00:04:19.036 --> 00:04:20.199
that are there.

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:21.740

I'll be back, so
speak to you soon.
