Welcome to How Will He Die, the show that
needs more BASS! And MORE BASS! AND MORE BASS.

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:13.179
Yes, that kind as well. Firstly, let's see
how Rick died in last episode's clip.

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:19.290
Yes. This game is UNFAIR. I recommend giving
it a go, it's stained my childhood with its

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:24.140
unfair design and 'please start again' policies.
The link is in the description of this video.

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:29.840
This week we had under 800 comments! TheRainbowpixels'
comment sums it up. Clearly you all hate anything

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:34.149
that isn't CS:GO on this channel. You're gonna
hate my LAN videos that are coming out soon.

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:38.230
Still, time to check the spam folder, which
stinks more than all the farts in a free public

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:43.390
toilet!
Tortozza, MessyBionicJew_Kuntz and Kim Jong-il

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:46.891
all remember and were traumatised by this
game at some point in their lives, but it

00:00:46.891 --> 00:00:51.329
was CurtisAlex who could both identify the
game AND sort of guess that a wooden spike

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:56.390
would kill him, even if it didn't quite fall
on him. Foopy64 simply mentioned spikes, so

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:00.430
half a point to him as well.
In fact, lots of people said SPIKE. Annoyingly,

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:05.400
it pretty much describes everything in this
game, from this, to this, to this and EVEN

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.840
THE ENEMY'S HAIR. More specific plox.
TheHandsomeRed also partially described the

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.580
flying spike thing. Perhaps it was a dildo.
forsteamgamers said ARROW, which is also a

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:19.220
word that could describe the projectile. 9/10ths
of a mark! And without even knowing the game.

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:24.920
YesMarkBlog also suspected a SPIKE, but he
said 'strip' which reduces his mark by 69%.

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:29.870
Or perhaps death found him, l0lmikelol!
Dennis Stanistan and Aprilfools DK are both

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:34.800
wanting to take RealStupidTV's place. WHO
SHOULD GET IT?! Place your bets now.

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:39.150
ThatSpoonehGuy's spam accidentally seeped
out and contaminated the normal comments section.

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:44.450
Suhaib Ali missed the spam folder completely.
As did Bence Channel. WHY AM I EVEN MENTIONING

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:48.790
ALL OF YOU? Now we're all infected!
tomss113, this isn't Russia!

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:53.320
Nelja Lerob at least put some effort into
his comment, even though it was too long didn't

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:57.030
read. Bit like this video in general.
Minty also made an interesting comment and

00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.910
one that I read enthusiastically to the end
and then suddenly forgot all about.

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:05.430
Felix Watkins, if a bottle opener can serve
more purposes, is that such a bad thing?

00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.600
gunup2 clearly you weren't. I've tidied up
now.

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:12.709
Much higher now that I've included you, Netaro.
TheEpicPromo, don't worry they've all been

00:02:12.709 --> 00:02:15.989
used now.
SgtSanchez, you've been included for old times'

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:19.819
sake. Never don't forget.
And now for this week's clip, safely back

00:02:19.819 --> 00:02:23.409
in the land of CS:GO and beautiful graphics
(for 2007).

00:02:23.409 --> 00:02:26.489
HOW WILL HE DIE? FIND OUT NEXT FISH.
