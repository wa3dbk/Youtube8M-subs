00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:26.119
'How often should i change my strings' is
a popular question especially for people just

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:27.119
starting out.

00:00:27.119 --> 00:00:38.350
You'll hear lots of different answers, e.g.
every 2-3 weeks, every 2-3 months some people

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:42.930
might only change their strings when they
break one.

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:47.980
The truth is is really depends on how much
the guitar is played, what type of strings

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:55.950
you're using, how easily you're strings corrode
and so on.

00:00:55.950 --> 00:01:02.780
That's why for me the question of 'how often'
is not really all that helpful.

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:09.180
The more helpful question is 'why' should
i change my guitar strings, because that gives

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.670
me a better idea about the 'when'.

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:19.280
There are 3 main benefits of new strings,
the most obvious one has to do with 'tone'.

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:27.640
You'll notice new strings sound less dull
and a lot 'brighter' than old ones.

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:34.930
Old strings develop general wear &amp; tear against
the frets, they also become corroded by being

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:37.649
in constant contact with your skin.

00:01:37.649 --> 00:01:42.159
This affects how they resonate and sustain,
which obviously affects how they sound.

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:51.730
Secondly, it's those same inconsistencies
that build up over the string that cause old

00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:58.640
strings to have more difficulty with intonation
and staying in 'tune'.

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:08.840
And lastly, for the very same reason old strings
are more susceptible to breaking.

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:15.790
So new strings will help us get more out of
our tone, they are many likely to stay in

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:22.920
tune better (assuming they are stretched in)
and they are less inclined to break.

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:27.740
So what does that tell us about when we should
be looking to change our strings?

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:30.410
A few obvious examples come to mind.

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:42.640
Every time the guitar gets 'set up' we'd be
looking to use new strings for accurate tuning

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.269
and intonation adjustments.

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:50.400
When we have an important performance we'd
want to minimize the chance of strings breaking

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:54.810
but putting on a fresh set.

00:02:54.810 --> 00:03:03.879
And definitely, when we are doing any kind
of recording we'd want to make sure our guitar

00:03:03.879 --> 00:03:06.590
is sound the best it can.

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:12.940
For someone who is playing out very regularly
or doing a lot of studio sessions, they might

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:21.620
be changing their strings multiple times a
week, but for some who doesn't play professionally

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:26.180
or is only very casual with their guitar,
they'd only think about changing strings far

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:27.180
less regularly.

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:30.080
Ultimately it comes down to a matter of personal
preference.

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:34.880
In either case knowing 'why' we would think
about changing strings helps us make an informed

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:37.980
decision about 'when' to change them.

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:48.709
Lastly, common sense applies, playing with
clean hands and wiping our strings down after

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:56.080
playing with a clean clothe will help us get
more out of our guitar strings.

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:14.200
