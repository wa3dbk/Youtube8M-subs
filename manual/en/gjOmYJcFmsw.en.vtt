What's going on guys, my name is The715Gamer, and today I have a special video

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:05.970
regarding LittleBigPlanet 3.

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.550
Now before you guys freak out on my head, let me just start off by saying that: Yes, the game

00:00:09.550 --> 00:00:13.370
is fun no matter what and yes this game
blew our expectations

00:00:13.370 --> 00:00:17.260
over water but unfortunately there are
lots of bugs and glitches that I found

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:19.039
while playing the ps3 version

00:00:19.039 --> 00:00:22.670
of the game. Now of course this is expected because of the fact that

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:26.510
it on the current gen console and
because it was just released a few days

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:27.140
ago.

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:30.179
However this video is NOT to bash the game

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:33.239
but rather to point out some things to
Sumo Digital

00:00:33.239 --> 00:00:37.210
(the creators of LittleBigPlanet 3) to let them know what needs to be fixed

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:40.809
To start off, many people are complaining
about the multiplayer. Why's that?

00:00:40.809 --> 00:00:43.820
Well because for some reason when you
join someone

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:49.430
you tend to not be able to join. And
when you join them, it seems it doesn't

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:50.410
last that long

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:54.719
due to network errors. This could be a
problem for people who are doing level

00:00:54.719 --> 00:00:55.550
collaborations,

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:59.840
or to do a video collaboration on
YouTube. I also found another issue that I

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.199
thought was the most annoying

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:06.110
thing of all time. I don't know what if
this is just me

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:09.920
or if this has happened to other people too,
but I for some reason

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.830
can't gain access to the LittleBigPlanet Move Pack or any of its content.

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.060
Now when I first from this problem, my first
thought was to go to the store and try

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:19.170
and re-purchased it.

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:23.820
So searched it up, and the only thing I found was the PlayStation Move Heroes Costume

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:24.240
pack

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:28.840
LittleBigPlanet Move Pack... is now no longer there

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:34.150
what the fuck. The reason that's an issue is
because the majority of levels on my moon

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:37.409
*clears throught* sorry ALL of my levels on my moon

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:42.579
all have the move pack involved somehow
so I can no longer gain access to them

00:01:42.579 --> 00:01:46.070
so from what I've noticed that's all the
glitches that I have found

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:50.420
however I know there are more to talk about so you're not completely filled in, there is

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:52.500
video on Dragonicfires channel

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:56.600
that has the rest of them. Check him out, he's a pretty cool YouTuber and I think you

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:57.710
should check this channel out.

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:01.110
Thanks for watching guys be sure to check
out the playlist on screen the check out

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:02.829
the story mode of LittleBigPlanet 3

00:02:02.829 --> 00:02:06.300
from start to present time, and I'll see
you guys

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:06.670
in the next video.

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:07.560
Peace
