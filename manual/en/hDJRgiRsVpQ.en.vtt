00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:05.860
Williams Baptist College is more than
you know.

00:00:05.860 --> 00:00:07.740
More than you know.

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:08.700
More than you know.

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:10.320
Williams is more than you know

00:00:10.329 --> 00:00:15.019
because we strive for academic
excellence and the combination of that

00:00:15.019 --> 00:00:17.699
with your faith, with what you believe.

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:23.630
Williams Baptist College is a four-year
private liberal arts college located

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:24.759
at Walnut Ridge

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:27.990
a charming small town in the Northeast
corner of Arkansas.

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:33.020
Williams is well known for its academic
excellence and its warm, caring and

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:34.730
Christ-centered environment.

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:39.390
With an average class size of seventeen
and a student to teacher ratio of

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:40.610
13:1

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:45.490
WBC's professors are passionate and
personal about what they do.

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:49.590
Williams is a very strong college
academically. I've been challenged, but I've 

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.530
also been encouraged because the
professors are really willing to work

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:53.700
with the you one-on-one.

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:57.860
As far as I've experienced, I've learned a
lot in every single class including

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:58.680
 

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.650
general education classes that
changed my perspective on a lot of

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:03.160
things.

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.620
To me, compared to other colleges...I
went to a community college.

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:09.740
I just felt like a number,

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.920
over there. And here I actually have the
opportunity

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:18.150
to actually come and ask for help and
then them actually, you know,

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.650
give me the help that I want and need
and if not I'll also have the tutoring

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:24.170
there to come and help me out with any of 
my studies.

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:28.730
One of the things I like about teaching at
Williams is the personal setting.

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:32.830
I get to know all of my students and I
have them from the time when they are

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:34.650
Freshman to when they are Seniors

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:39.490
and what I really love is not just
teaching them about literature, or making

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:40.620
them better writers,

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:44.270
but also up helping them grow as people.

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:47.580
And I really enjoy the way that that
things connect.

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:53.720
Williams offers over 25 diverse majors
and pre-professional programs to equip

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:56.040
students for the career of their choice.

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.510
I'm a psychology major. I'm a biology
major

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:04.110
I am a physical education and health major.
I'm a Christian Ministries major.

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:08.009
I am an English major. Because of WBC's

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:11.139
academic excellence and personal
learning environment;

00:02:11.139 --> 00:02:15.109
US News and World Report has ranked
Williams in the top tier of Southern

00:02:15.109 --> 00:02:15.840
colleges

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:19.650
for the past five years. When we say, "
wholistically Christian

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:23.980
education", we mean that every aspect of
the education of the student's life at

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:24.810
Williams Baptist College

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:29.620
is thoroughly baptized into Christian
experience. Whether it's the academics,

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:30.799
whether its the student life,

00:02:30.799 --> 00:02:34.029
whether it's what they do on and off the
athletic field,

00:02:34.029 --> 00:02:38.279
it's impacted by our Christian commitment.
Williams Baptist College is more than

00:02:38.279 --> 00:02:38.779
you know.

00:02:38.779 --> 00:02:42.689
More than you know.Academics at
Williams is rigorous

00:02:42.689 --> 00:02:46.299
but it helps to prepare you for when you
leave Williams. It helps for when I'm

00:02:46.299 --> 00:02:49.409
going to enter the classroom and have to
discipline children and make my own

00:02:49.409 --> 00:02:50.230
lesson plan,

00:02:50.230 --> 00:02:53.889
instead of not being prepared and walking
into a situation where I don't know what

00:02:53.889 --> 00:02:54.279
to do.

00:02:54.279 --> 00:02:58.819
Academic life it Williams is enriched by
10 national and

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:02.200
international scholastic honor societies
that recognize

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.859
academic achievement, and promote
activities among their members.

00:03:05.859 --> 00:03:10.299
I'm on the Student Activities Board. I'm a
member of The Cast drama team.

00:03:10.299 --> 00:03:15.019
I am on the volleyball team here at
Williams. I work with the Williams soccer team.

00:03:15.019 --> 00:03:20.419
I'm in the Williams Singers. From varsity
sports and intramural athletics to music

00:03:20.419 --> 00:03:21.180
and theatre,

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:25.239
student activities provide endless
opportunities to make friends and

00:03:25.239 --> 00:03:28.029
grow relationships that last a lifetime.

00:03:28.029 --> 00:03:31.150
One of my favorite times of the whole
year is Christmas in the Cove.

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:34.510
And that's when all the students get to
walk around to the faculty's

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:38.620
houses that are nearby, and we get to go
in each home, and they give us

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:42.680
different kinds of food, which is my
favorite. And we just get to interact

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:43.370
with the

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:47.099
professors and their families and
it's a really cool time. At Williams we

00:03:47.099 --> 00:03:48.549
have Williams Idol,

00:03:48.549 --> 00:03:52.589
we have Mr. and Miss WBC,

00:03:52.589 --> 00:03:57.199
We have the 5k which is open to the
community everyone can be involved.

00:03:57.199 --> 00:04:00.290
I enjoy all the activities that the
Student Activities Board puts on.

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:04.469
They're always a lot of fun and they normally
have free food! Through a wide array of

00:04:04.469 --> 00:04:05.959
activities and events

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:10.529
William students build lasting memories
and life changing relationships.

00:04:10.529 --> 00:04:14.180
Ultimately we want to point people to a
relationship in Jesus Christ.

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:17.329
But from there we also think it's
important

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:20.949
for our emphasis to be connecting with
others

00:04:20.949 --> 00:04:25.190
in a community, Christian community, and those that don't know Christ as well.

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:27.860
just to have those strong relationships
that will

00:04:27.860 --> 00:04:30.970
encourage each other and challenge
each other.

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:36.340
And, it really, I think in turn makes them
feel like this can really truly be home.

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:40.800
Williams' close-knit campus is an ideal
setting for spiritual community and

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:41.539
growth.

00:04:41.539 --> 00:04:45.379
Students meet weekly with faculty and
staff for chapel services

00:04:45.379 --> 00:04:49.250
in the beautiful Manley Chapel. Williams
is very personal.

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:52.270
I've made friendships here that will
last a lifetime.

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:55.650
And they're not just surface friendships
but they're based on deep

00:04:55.650 --> 00:05:00.210
spiritual values. And just being a
part of each others' life.

00:05:00.210 --> 00:05:04.069
Academic excellence, personal attention, and a pervasive Christian commitment

00:05:04.069 --> 00:05:07.789
means William students are not just
preparing for a career,

00:05:07.789 --> 00:05:11.759
they're preparing for life. When I
graduate from Williams Baptist College, I'm

00:05:11.759 --> 00:05:14.150
going to be a marriage and family
therapist.

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:18.460
I want to be a pastor of a small local
church. I would like to teach high

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:19.580
school biology,

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:22.870
and coach volleyball. I'm not sure what I'm
gonna do when I graduate but I know that

00:05:22.870 --> 00:05:26.139
Williams has prepared me to serve God
wherever I go.

00:05:26.139 --> 00:05:29.180
Williams Baptist College, it truly is

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:30.009
More Than You Know.
