Right now, the man of God, Prophet T.B. Joshua, is at the prayer line of the Colombia Crusade,

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:09.560
and God Almighty is using him to pray for the sick and afflicted,

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:12.900
setting them free from every bondage in their lives.

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.620
demons in the lives of people begin to manifest and cry out.

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:12.480
Who are you?

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:23.160
Shut up!

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:26.740
It is not your business!

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:29.240
Leave me!

CRUSADE WITH T.B. JOSHUA, Cali, Colombia

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:02.560
TESTIMONY TIME

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:06.120
Miss Leidy Dominguez - Cali, Colombia

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:11.900
Her name is Leidy Dominguez, and she comes from Cali, Colombia.

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.640
First of all, I was suffering from an eating disorder and was self-harming.

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:20.180
I was aggressive and got angry all the time amongst other problems.

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.400
This was what I went through every day.

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:27.500
She said, in her daily life, she was always angry.

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.800
She had an eating disorder.

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.500
I mainly came because of my sister

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.540
but when I felt the presence of the man of God close to me,

00:02:35.540 --> 00:02:39.520
I started to get desperate and when he touched me, I started running.

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:43.420
I began to scream out of desperation and wanted to start hurting myself.

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:48.460
First of all, I came here because of my sister

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:53.620
but when the prophet came towards her,

00:02:53.620 --> 00:03:04.040
she started to feel anxiety; she started to run, scream and hit herself.

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:13.560
After Prophet T.B. Joshua prayed for you, how do you now feel?

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.960
I felt so calm and peaceful.

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:23.000
I came with so many burdens of stress and anger but now everything has gone.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.240
Now, I have peace.

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:30.400
She said, she feels at peace and calm.

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:39.220
She feels that any problem she had with anger is in the past right now.

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:49.660
How did you hear about today's miracle crusade with Prophet T.B. Joshua?

00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:51.180
I heard about the crusade on social networks.

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:56.520
I first learnt about it through my aunt who attends a church here in Cali.

00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:03.500
She informed us and we confirmed from the social networks that it was true.

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:07.120
As soon as I knew about it, I went to register my sister for the crusade.

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:12.740
She said, one of her aunts came to invite her.

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:19.700
Because of that, she started to look for more information on the internet, social media.

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:26.560
Because of that, she wanted to bring her sister to this miracle crusade.

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:29.480
What is your advice to all the youth out there

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:33.500
that are suffering with the same problems that you had in the past

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:36.980
such as eating disorders and anger problems?

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:50.060
Testimony From Colombia Crusade With Prophet T.B. Joshua

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:54.780
You simply have to look for God because God is love and peace.

00:04:54.780 --> 00:05:01.920
Things like anger, rage, burdens and eating disorders don't come from God.

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:10.720
They came from demons - the enemy who always wants to destroy us.

00:05:10.720 --> 00:05:15.820
Her advice is that people have to look for God

00:05:15.820 --> 00:05:18.820
because God is love and peace.

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:27.660
Any problems like anger and eating disorders come from the devil.

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:34.920
Don't be stubborn; if you are delivered, it is because God is working in your life and He is calling you.

00:05:34.920 --> 00:05:37.820
I am speaking from my experience; I have been stubborn many times.

00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:42.780
That was why the devil could always find an opportunity to enter my life.

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:47.880
She said, we have to be close to God.

00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:51.380
We thank God for your deliverance today.

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:56.780
It is not enough to just seek deliverance but it is also important to maintain your deliverance

00:05:56.780 --> 00:05:59.160
by staying close to Jesus.

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:14.240
Testimony From Colombia Crusade With Prophet T.B. Joshua

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:18.960
Thank you very much. I just love God; He is great!

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:23.980
Thank you very much. God is great!

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:26.300
Jesus is great!

00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:28.720
He alone is my Father!
