00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:04.150
welcome to the solar edge physical
mapping commercial tutorial

00:00:04.150 --> 00:00:07.250
in this tutorial you learn how to use
the editor

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:10.270
to create a physical layout of a
commercial site

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:14.270
including how to assign multiple modules
to a single power optimizer

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:18.740
and how to easily draw a complex system
for more information

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:22.500
on how to use the physical editor you
may want to watch the basic

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.940
editor tutorial first

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:27.490
let's take this site as an example

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:31.250
this is a commercial installation with
three inverters and a hundred and fifty

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:36.219
six modules

00:00:36.219 --> 00:00:36.890
step 1:

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:41.510
on place the inverter and modules on the
canvas.

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:45.239
to place the inverters on the canvas
dragged the inverters

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:49.730
icon from the components panel and place
it on the canvas

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:53.420
select the number of inverters and their
layout pattern

00:00:53.420 --> 00:01:00.420
now let's drag a group of modules to
the canvas

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:03.730
set the number up colums

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:08.450
and rows

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:10.430
the orientation

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:13.580
tilt and azimuth

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:17.670
as you can see this site includes spaces
between the columns in the rows

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.320
we will create the spacing by moving to
the module sets

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.409
tab

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.759
The horizontal set is used when there is spacing
between moduel  columns

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:34.729
set the horizontal spacing between the
sets and set the number of columns

00:01:34.729 --> 00:01:36.540
and every set

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:40.760
in the same way the vertical set is
used when there is spacing between moduel

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:41.390
rows

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:44.630
set the vertical spacing between the
sets

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:48.230
and set the number rows in every set

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:52.050
then click Create this will create the
define module layout

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:56.040
on the canvas notice how the upper rows
are shifted

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:59.830
we can select the rows and move them to
the right or the left

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:03.219
using the mouse or keyboard

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:10.219
now in the same way select the top rows
and move them to the right

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.440
now all the modules are correctly placed

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.269
this is how you create an inverter and a
group of models

00:02:20.269 --> 00:02:24.890
step 2 assigned serial numbers to the
site components

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:28.270
now that we have for inverters and
modules laid out on the canvas

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:32.070
we need to assign the serial numbers
from our PV array

00:02:32.070 --> 00:02:35.849
To each corresponding graphic element

00:02:35.849 --> 00:02:39.310
use the mapping documentation you
prepared during installation

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:43.430
in this case the inverter and power
optimizer barcode stickers

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:46.990
are placed on a template

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:50.750
in this commercial site we are using a
one to two configuration

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:55.099
each power optimizer is connected to two
modules

00:02:55.099 --> 00:03:00.290
to account for this you just configure
the power optimizer moduel ratio

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:04.379
will set it to one to two which means that
one power optimizer

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:07.350
is connected to two modules

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:12.150
then click and drag the serial number to one of the modules connected to that power

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.069
optimizer

00:03:14.069 --> 00:03:18.730
now select the second module connected
to the same power optimizer

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:22.700
now the power optimizer serial number is
assigned to both moduels

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:24.240
simple

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:27.750
you can see that the power optimizer
serial number is displayed on both

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:28.610
modules

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:34.060
and when a model is selected the second
one is automatically selected

00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:38.280
the serial number is also now removed
from the components list

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:42.660
now we can assign the other serial
numbers to their models

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:45.440
if you make a mistake you can simply unassign it 

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:47.890
by selecting the moduel

00:03:47.890 --> 00:03:51.840
If the power optimizers is assigned to two modules
you'll be unassigning

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:55.990
both models in the same action

00:03:55.990 --> 00:04:02.990
just click on unassign

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:16.890
when done the component list will be
cleared

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:20.340
and that is how you assign a serial
numbers from the PV array

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:24.680
to the site components in a commercial
system let's go to the last step

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:27.490
by clicking next

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:33.240
step 3: assigned the power optimizers
into their respective strings

00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:36.259
this installation has six strings two

00:04:36.259 --> 00:04:38.020
per each inverter

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:40.920
first select the inverter

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:41.620
next

00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:44.030
number the string

00:04:44.030 --> 00:04:47.789
now select the modules that are
connected in the string

00:04:47.789 --> 00:04:49.700
click string it

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:50.750
you can check

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:53.449
progress here

00:04:53.449 --> 00:04:56.540
the same way assigned string number two

00:04:56.540 --> 00:05:03.540
repeat this for all inverters

00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:29.280
that's it

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:32.090
now you're ready to publish the layout

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:33.770
Click publish

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:37.160
physical layout which you've just
created will become visible

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:40.490
and the Layout tab the sites monitoring
screen

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:43.889
now you know how to use the editor to
create the physical layout

00:05:43.889 --> 00:05:46.520
