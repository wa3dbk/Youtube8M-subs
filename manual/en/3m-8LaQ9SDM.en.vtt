Hi, I'm Rokosz, your digital lifestyle expert.
So you've got some great footage on your camcorder

00:00:05.319 --> 00:00:09.290
and you need to burn it to your DVD disc.
Well, I'm going to show you exactly how to

00:00:09.290 --> 00:00:14.710
do that, if you've got the right gear. First
thing you need is a DVD burner, little bit

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:18.940
different than a DVD player, you need a DVD
burner. If you don't have one, well you got

00:00:18.940 --> 00:00:22.720
to go get one and I mean seriously, they're
awesome. And all you're going to do there

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:28.980
is get in some good blank DVD media and place
it inside the unit. Okay. Hooking up the camcorder

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:32.900
is where the real art comes into play, let
me show you. First of all you got to decide

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:39.750
what kind of outputs your camcorder has. In
this case here the Sony has a multiple output.

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.040
I'm going to use this cable over here. Happens
to be an Apple cable but it works just the

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:48.440
same way, Sony has it, you can tell, it's
going to have three prongs up the top and

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:55.180
three out here. One, maybe see the yellow
for video, red for right channel, excuse me,

00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:00.111
yeah I keep the red over here for right channel
and white for left channel. And hooking it

00:01:00.111 --> 00:01:04.610
up to this one again this is product specific.
I'm going to put it into the multi video out

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:12.920
part, and I'm going to take my DVD burner
here and I'm going to hook it up properly.

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:19.640
Now I'm looking for line in, okay, yes video
is out, the other ones are out, so these are

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:26.430
the only ones I can choose from. Line in,
is going to be here, red to right, white to

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:32.720
left, yellow to yellow, boom, we're all set
over here. Now basically all that's left is

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:36.500
for me to put in a blank piece of media in
there, and there's some other choices that

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:41.409
you might want to consider, high quality,
low quality, how much disk space you want

00:01:41.409 --> 00:01:44.950
to take up. But that's going to be in the
manual for the particular DVD burner that

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:50.170
you have, and it's simply as easy as doing
a dub and traditional dubs are like this.

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:56.240
You push play and pause on the media that
you want to record, and you do record and

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:01.400
pause on the one that you want to record onto.
Now a lot of times what you'll do is you'll

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:07.490
let the one, actually a good trick is to back
up the player about five seconds before you

00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:13.720
actually want it to start recording, then
you unpause it, more than play, it's an unpause,

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:19.150
and that gives you five seconds to hit the
unpause on the record function, pick up right

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:24.340
where you want your dub to be, and you're
in real time dubbing and burner, from whatever

00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:31.310
media your camcorder is, right to the very
useful DVD. And I'm the very useful Rokosz,

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.430
