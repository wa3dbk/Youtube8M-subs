00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:20.480
Designing your own amp is cool.

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:25.590
But many guitar players like to augment their
tones even more with stomp-box pedals.

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.430
Logic 9 contains a massive set of pedals to
put in line between your

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:30.200
guitar input and the amp.

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:31.270
Let's check some of these out.

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:35.190
You'll notice in the top track, in the channel
strip, Pedalboard is loaded in

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.090
there but it's currently inactive since it's
not lit up blue.

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:43.320
You can activate a plug-in any time in the
channel strip by Option+Clicking it.

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:45.540
Now that it's blue, it's active.

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:48.260
Let's open the Pedalboard by double-clicking
on it.

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.160
This is Logic's Pedalboard.

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:53.920
Currently this track contains 1 pedal, Hi-Drive
Treble Boost.

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.941
The list of all the other pedals that you
can use is on the right.

00:00:56.941 --> 00:00:58.780
There are a lot of them in there.

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:01.700
Let's listen to what this pedal sounds like.

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.710
(Music playing.)

00:01:04.710 --> 00:01:09.700
At any time you can turn on and off the pedal
by clicking on the big button

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:10.850
at the bottom.

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:12.951
This is equivalent of stepping on the pedal
in real life.

00:01:12.951 --> 00:01:15.680
If the light on the top is on, the pedal's
active.

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:19.770
If it's off, it's inactive or bypassed.

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.460
(Music playing.)

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:26.679
We can also adjust the tone of the pedal on
real time.

00:01:26.679 --> 00:01:30.950
This pedal has one control, Level.

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:34.490
(Music playing.)

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:36.470
To adjust the dial, click on it.

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:40.290
Drag up to go right, drag down to go left.

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.649
Let's close this window and we'll go over
to the Country Twang track.

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:47.000
We'll double-click on Pedalboard to open up
the Pedalboard for this track.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.540
In this track we've 2 pedals already being
used, the Squash Compressor and the Blue Echo.

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:54.209
Let's add another pedal to this.

00:01:54.209 --> 00:01:56.429
I like this one called Spin Box.

00:01:56.429 --> 00:01:59.030
It's a Leslie speaker cabinet emulator.

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:01.149
Click on it and drag it to your Pedalboard.

00:02:01.149 --> 00:02:04.729
At anytime if you want to remove a pedal from
your Pedalboard, you can click on it

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:06.650
and drag it back to the bin.

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:08.170
Let's add this back.

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:11.770
Let's click on the Fast button and hear what
this one sounds like.

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:15.390
First let me go to the Arrange window and
move this window down, click on the

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:21.130
region and hit equal on our keyboard to move
our cycle locators to that region.

00:02:21.130 --> 00:02:24.920
(Music playing.)

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:26.810
Cool!

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:33.050
Another handy thing with the Pedalboard is
utilitarian pedal called the Mixer.

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:35.770
Let's drag a Mixer out into the Pedalboard
area.

00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:38.870
The Mixer pedal lets you blend between different
pedals instead of having them

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:41.040
go in line from one another.

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:45.390
Let's pan side B to the left a little bit
and pan side A to the right.

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:49.650
Now, when I drag this fader up to B, we'll
hear just the Squash Compressor and

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:52.129
Blue Echo on the left.

00:02:52.129 --> 00:02:55.450
(Music playing.)

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:58.950
On the right, we'll hear the Spin Box Pedal.

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:02.530
(Music playing.)

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:07.450
With this Mixer pedal, we can blend between
the two in a stereophonic fashion.

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:11.790
Let's close this window and let's go down
to the Glam Rock track.

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:16.769
We'll click on the region, and again hit equal
to move our cycle locators to that spot.

00:03:16.769 --> 00:03:19.739
Let's open the Pedalboard from the Glam Rock
track.

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:24.129
Like the first track, this one contains one
pedal, the Hi-Drive Treble Boost.

00:03:24.129 --> 00:03:27.959
Let's drag a Wah pedal out from the Pedalboard
bin.

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:30.700
Some pedals like Wah have a moving control.

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:37.500
To move the control, click on the Wah and
drag the mouse up and down while it's playing.

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:43.150
(Music playing.)

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:49.329
In the video on automation, you'll learn how
to quickly assign a MIDI keyboard

00:03:49.329 --> 00:03:52.170
controller to this type of control.

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:54.989
As you're working with pedals, if you come
up with a combination you like,

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:56.319
you can always save them.

00:03:56.319 --> 00:04:01.160
Go up to the top of the plug-in window and
open the plug-in settings pulldown menu.

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:07.060
Here we can go to Save Settings As and we
can save it as my pedal combo.

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:11.090
Now if we go back in, we'll see that my pedal
combo will be available to all of

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:14.099
our Logic projects going forward.

00:04:14.099 --> 00:04:15.400
Playing guitar in Logic is a blast.

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:18.380
You can get the tone of your dreams with these
tools.

00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:20.640
Don't forget that you can save your settings
if you come across a

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:31.199
combination that's really good.
