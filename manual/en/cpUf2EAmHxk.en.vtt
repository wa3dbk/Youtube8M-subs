00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:13.530
Scientists have found a massive phytoplankton bloom growing beneath sea ice in the Arctic.

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:21.980
The discovery, captured on video and shown here, stunned scientists, as an under-ice bloom of this size has never been seen anywhere on the planet.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:32.980
The bloom was spotted last summer by a team of scientists collecting field measurements for NASA's ICESCAPE mission, which explores the effects of climate change in the Arctic.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:41.480
Sampling took place at multiple sites along two tracks of ice-covered water in the Chukchi Sea, just north of Alaska.

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:52.230
According to observations, the bloom extended for more than 60 miles from the ice edge into the sea ice pack and concentrated in the top layers of water near the ocean surface.

00:00:53.020 --> 00:01:04.980
Video footage taken below the sea ice at two different study sites contrasts the Arctic's typically barren and dark blue water with the emerald shades of green produced when teeming with phytoplankton.

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:13.980
The blooms consisted mainly of diatoms -- microscopic plants that make up the base of the marine food chain and require large amounts of sunlight to grow.

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:24.180
Scientists previously thought blooms were limited to ice-free expanses of open water, where sunlight isn't reflected by sea ice and prevented from entering the ocean. 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:33.980
But thinning ice and an increase in melt ponds has allowed more sunlight to reach the water below the sea ice in recent years, which may account for the presence of these massive blooms.

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:45.780
If such blooms are widespread, scientists will have to evaluate the impact of these carbon-consumers on the amount of carbon dioxide entering the ocean, and what that means for our changing climate.
