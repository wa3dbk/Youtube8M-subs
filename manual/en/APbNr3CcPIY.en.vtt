00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:07.610
Today in the 2007 Ford F150 Supercab we&amp;#39;re
going to install part number 87418 from Hidden

00:00:07.610 --> 00:00:08.610
Hitch.

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.600
This is what the hitch looks like when it&amp;#39;s
installed on a truck.

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:15.030
Next I&amp;#39;ll give you some measurements to
help you out selecting some accessories such

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.730
as a ball mount, a bicycle rack or a cargo
carrier.

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:22.789
From the top of your receiver opening down
to the ground will be about 19 1/2 inches.

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:27.599
From the center of your hitch pin hole to
the edge of the bumper will be about 3 1/4

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:28.599
inches.

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:38.950
Now we&amp;#39;ll go ahead and show you how the
hitch gets installed 

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:50.010
on the truck.

00:00:50.010 --> 00:01:06.530
First 

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:59.590
off we&amp;#39;ll go ahead and show you where
a 

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:21.910
hitch mounts 

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:32.640
up 

00:02:32.640 --> 00:03:03.400
to 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:15.900
a truck.
