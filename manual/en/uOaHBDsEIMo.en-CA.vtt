00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:06.310
So what we're going to do is a complete hands
on, we're going to do a really great little

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:10.910
project that you'll be able to take home with
you. My assistant Debbie she'll be walking

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:14.470
around on that side of the room and if you
have any questions or you're not sure if you're

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:17.680
touching the right thing, just ask and we'll
come around and help you. We want to make

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:23.019
sure that you have an enjoyable fun experience,
making this project. I'd like to tell you

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:26.869
a little about Janome history just in case
you didn't know. Does anybody have a Janome

00:00:26.869 --> 00:00:34.370
machine? Already? Yeah we have one who doesn't
so that's good. Janome's been around for over

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:39.079
100 years so it is one of the oldest sewing
machine companies. And we'd like to say that

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:45.320
the Memory Craft 11000 is 100 years in the
making. Every generation of machine that Janome

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:50.289
creates adds to the next generation. The technology
that we learn from one goes into the next

00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:56.910
one. In the 1990's Janome created the Memory
Craft 8000.Does anybody have that? Oh look

00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:02.660
at that! So we have some people who know about
the technology. Janome was the first to create

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:09.390
the home embroidery machine, an all in one
sewing machine and embroidery. The technology

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:14.500
that they learned from that Janoe started
making desktop robots. So the technology in

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:20.460
these robots have now been put into the sewing
machine. The robotic arm is a rolling linear

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.299
motion guide and it helps to move the embroidery
hoop. With the best precision and the most

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:30.090
precision that we've ever had in our embroidery.
So going through this machine we hope you'll

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:35.140
hear all the robotic sounds that I love to
hear. You'll really appreciate the quality

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:38.990
that goes into this machine. so what I'd like
everybody to do is turn it on. On the right

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:42.060
hand side of the machine near the plug if
you'd like to reach around and flick that

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:52.770
black button. And it'll all fire up on you.
Hear all the little cool sounds all beginning.

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.790
There we go. And the first thing you'll notice
is that great big eye height screen. This

00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:03.450
is the largest screen on the market. It's
over 7 1/2" diagonally from corner to corner

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.950
and it has over 65000 colours. And what the
means is it's going to give you the most clear

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:14.520
description of your clear view of your designs
and stitches and it even has a screen saver.

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:19.030
So you can import your own pictures into the
machine and look at your own images. As I

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:22.970
said it is an eye height screen and what that
means is you can move it. So if everybody

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:27.970
looks under the screen you'll see a green
button with arrows. Press the up arrow and

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:33.090
you can press on that button until you get
the screen to your height. No more neck straining

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:39.170
trying to look at the screen. You can sew
for hours and hours and hours, isn't that

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:44.500
great? Now what that's done is it's opened
up over 9 1/2" of space to the right of the

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:50.790
needle. So you can get really large projects
in there, all your large quilts, coats, drapery,

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.590
and what that does for embroidery is it gives
us the largest embroidery available, a big

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:59.530
square hoop goes in there. With all that extra
space we need lots of light. So if you look

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:04.280
underneath in the reflection of the bed of
the machine, you can see the reflection of

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:09.500
the lights. So you'll see 2 on the other side
of the needle. There's 4 in the middle. And

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:15.090
there's 2 on the outer inside edge. So they're
LED lights they're nice clear white lights.

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:19.420
You can sew in the dark even. We had one dealer
shut the lights off in the room, it's amazing

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:23.920
how bright it is. They don't get hot. So you
don't have to worry about your hands burning

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:31.540
when you're putting your fabric underneath
there or burning your fabrics. 15000 sewing

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:35.750
hours the lights last. People say oh oh they're
going to burn out next week kind of thing.

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:43.580
15000 sewing hours that's 8 hours a day 5
days a week for 15 years. The lights will

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:48.080
last so yeah, you don't have to worry about
them burning out any time quick. So what we're

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:50.620
going to do is we're going to talk about the
buttons on the front of your machine the back

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:55.050
clip buttons that are in green. So the very
first one there with the 2 arrows pointing

00:03:55.050 --> 00:04:00.320
up ad down. This is your needle up/down/ What
i'd like everybody to do is touch that button

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:07.480
and you'll see your needle go down. Touch
the button again, what this is great for is

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:12.480
bringing your bobbin thread up if you need
to lower your needle to turn corners when

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:16.730
you're pivoting. No longer do you have to
reach around to turn the hand wheel that wastes

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:21.000
time. We don't have as much time to sew through
a lot of the features that we talk about today

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.380
are about saving you time so that you can
get to the task at hand. We need to get to

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:31.410
our projects we don't want to be fiddling
and everything for that. To the right of that

00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:35.660
is your needle threader. Now some of you your
needles are already threaded, if you could

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:41.500
just pull the threads out of your needle.
Is yours threaded? There, just pull your thread

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:46.250
out of your needle threader, out of the needle,
ok, just to make sure. If everybody can push

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:50.931
that needle threader button, it looks like
a needle with a thread going through. And

00:04:50.931 --> 00:04:55.091
you'll see a little mechanism lower itself
down into the eye of the needle. And if you

00:04:55.091 --> 00:05:00.380
look on your screen, you'll see that it's
telling you exactly what to do. So if you

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:05.630
can try and figure it out, sometimes it helps
to lower the presser foot while you're threading

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:12.420
the needle. Did you get it Doreen? Yeah everybody's
got it. Everybody's good? ok? everybody got

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:16.250
it? Yeah! So now you don't have to be able
to see the eye of the needle anymore, you

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:20.930
don't have to bite that thread and try to
get it through the needle. So you're good

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:29.540
Darla? Almost. That's ok.
Ok, so when you're pulling it around through

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:39.340
here...now push...perfect! Now if you can
resist, pulling on that tail..that little

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:44.700
blade that's on the thread cutter on the side
leaves enough of a length of a tail so that

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:50.490
when you go to start sewing there's enough
thread for it to catch. Most people want to

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:54.330
pull that amount of thread but Janome has
made sure that there's enough thread on that

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:59.250
tail to catch so you're not wasting thread.
We're used to pulling the long tail and holding

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:03.710
it and this one gives you just the right tail
and hold it..and you don't have to. And you'll

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:09.180
notice there's no bobbin thread popping up
through the hole, because it cuts and it leaves

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:12.420
enough thread there as well, so we're going
to talk about that button. Ok to the right

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:21.640
of that, you've got your bobbin winder. If
everybody can lower their screen again....and

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:25.500
you're looking at the top of your machine.
And you'll notice that this is your bobbin

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:31.270
winder here, so you would be pushing that
to the left, ok and then pushing your bobbin

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:35.010
winder button, go ahead everybody can push
it. You don't have thread there or anything

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:39.950
but you get the idea, Marn is the only one
who's got thread there. So maybe we'll stop

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:44.670
when the bobbin is wound but it's an independent
bobbin winding motor so you can wind thread

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:50.550
while your machine is embroidering or sewing.
So there's no down time to stop and wind your

00:06:50.550 --> 00:06:54.560
bobbin. And then just to the back of that
to the right there's a little thread cutter,

00:06:54.560 --> 00:07:00.290
so after your bobbin's finished winding, you
can hook down there and cut your bobbin. Little

00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:04.140
time efficient things. And there is a thread
path printed on the top of the machine to

00:07:04.140 --> 00:07:10.010
show you how to thread it. ok? And you'll
notice there's no stitch chart anymore to

00:07:10.010 --> 00:07:14.550
show you the stitches and we're going to get
to that, that's on screen. Ok, so again looking

00:07:14.550 --> 00:07:19.570
at those buttons backlit in green, the button
that looks like a bulls eye, the little circle

00:07:19.570 --> 00:07:23.200
with the dot, this is your autolock. So at
the end of your sewing you can touch that

00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:28.700
autolock and it'll do 4 locking stitches and
stop. Nice time saving feature and then to

00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:34.080
the right of that is a pair of scissors. so
we've got built-in thread cutter. Saves you

00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:39.380
time, it's efficient, it doesn't waste thread,
you hit that thread cutter and pull your fabric

00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:43.791
out and away you go. So it's great if you're
working on a big huge quilt and you don't

00:07:43.791 --> 00:07:47.590
have to drag your quilt out to try and get
to that bottom thread. So you're not wasting

00:07:47.590 --> 00:07:51.590
thread and people do notice you wouldn't think
it's much but when you go to a class and you're

00:07:51.590 --> 00:07:55.540
using that thread cutter everybody wants to
know, what is it that she's done? And she

00:07:55.540 --> 00:07:59.370
doesn't have that big pile of thread there,
because she's been able to use her thread

00:07:59.370 --> 00:07:59.720
cutter.
