00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Hi!
I'm Elizabeth Chow. 

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:12.000
If you've watched me for a while,
you'll know I always have a veggie day in a week.

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:20.000
So today I'll show you how to make my
Veggies Konjac Noodle Soup.

00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:26.000
But! There'll be no noodle in the soup! Haha What does that mean?

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:32.000
When I lost weight, I always ate bread and rice in day time.

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:41.000
However, it's quite hard for a Chinese to cut rice &amp; noodle at dinner.

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:45.000
So I thought of a way to trick myself and my husband,

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:50.000
I've substituted noodle with Konjac Noodle!

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:58.000
The konjac noodle I bought in Hong Kong always comes in a knot, what I do is to untie it so it will look like noodle.

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:05.000
My husband didn't even know he's not eating noodle, he said "this rice noodle is very al dente."

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:09.000
He's so silly hehe.

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:17.000
So the first thing, I'll remove the smell of the raw konjac.

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:27.000
Simply boil the konjac in hot water for a minute, drain the water,

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.000
then set it aside.

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:35.000
The other ingredients you need are fresh tomatoes, cubed,

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:41.000
enoki mushroom, tear into small bunch, some gingers,

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:50.000
and Chinese Cabbage. Tear the leaves, wash it,

00:01:50.200 --> 00:02:02.000
then stack 5-6 leaves together and cut into thin strip.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
So now I'll prepare the soup.

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:11.000
First, grate the ginger.

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:19.000
The ginger sort of gives the soup a kick and the heat would warm your stomach.

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:24.000
You'll sweat after eating this soup, feel so good especially it's already autumn in Hong Kong.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:36.000
Don't worry it won't be crazy hot like chili, fresh ginger is a fragrant plant.

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:39.000
Now add in the tomatoes.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:48.000
This is super simple, just dump everything in...
Enoki mushroom as well.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:03:05.000
Then add in some Japanese Sake, Light Soy,
all measurement is listed in my website.

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:10.000
I'm using chicken stock, you can use vegetable stock.

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:20.000
I'm not using much stock coz all veggies will release lot of water.

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:27.000
Turn on high heat, wait until it's bubbling then add in the cabbage. Lid on.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:39.000
When it's bubbling, turn to medium low heat.
Put in all cabbage.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.000
It looks impossible now but the veggie will wilt down.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:58.000
And don't worry about the cabbage can't touch the soup,
the heat underneath will steam the cabbage.

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:04.000
Lid on, medium low heat, cook for 30 minutes.

00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:07.000
After 30 minutes and I'm ready to eat!

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.600
Put some konjac noodle in the bowl,

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:16.000
get some veggies. The lid is super hot!

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000
I want more enoki mushroom,

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:34.000
that's why I like to cut the cabbage in strip to make it like thick noodle.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:43.000
Get some soup and tomatoes as well.

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:49.000
You may notice there's no oil in it.

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:53.000
And I found that men always like demae ramen, especially sesame flavor ones.

00:04:53.200 --> 00:05:00.000
So I'll always add a teaspoon sesame oil on top.

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:07.000
He'd think he's eating demae ramen haha.

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:19.000
I'm so ready to sweat! I call it "Food Steam", way better than you go steam room.

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000
Want some veggies...

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:38.000
Very hot!! Super Hot! Give me some time...

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:50.000
You can pack this to work too. Separate the soup and the veggie in two boxes,

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:56.000
microwave both then put them together. Get some sesame oil as well.

00:05:56.200 --> 00:06:00.000
So try this on your veggie day,
