00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:02.630
What is OSIRIS-REx?

00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:04.210
Does it refer to an ancient god?

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:06.660
Is it a space mission?

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:10.130
Join the 321Science team as we explore just
what OSIRIS-REx is.

00:00:10.130 --> 00:00:18.080
OSIRIS-REx - is all capitals so it's a good
guess to recognize it as an acronym.

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:22.320
Scientists and engineers use acronyms to form
a word that represents a longer phrase.

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.840
We say them sometimes as letters or formed
into a word.

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:30.060
OSIRIS-REx is an acronym that names a NASA
mission.

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.850
This mission will send a robotic spacecraft
to an asteroid to return a sample to Earth

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:34.920
for study.

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:41.640
The OSIRIS-REx spacecraft will launch in 2016,
rendezvous with the asteroid, Bennu, in 2018,

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.120
sample it, and return the sample in 2023.

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:50.410
The acronym is inspired by the myth of Osiris
and each letter in it tells a piece of the

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:52.080
story of the mission.

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:56.219
As a whole, the acronym explains why scientists
want to go to Bennu and what they hope to

00:00:56.219 --> 00:01:00.859
understand about the Solar System and the
early Earth by studying this asteroid.

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:05.040
The mission is interested in characteristics
of asteroids that can bring life or can end

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.040
life.

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:08.100
O is for Origins.

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.430
The mission will return a sample of an asteroid
essentially unchanged since the early Solar

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:13.700
System.

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:18.110
It's like a time capsule which holds volatiles
like water, organic molecules which are needed

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:23.420
for life, and other elements which have been
isolated for 4.5 billion years.

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:27.470
This sample can reveal details about origins
of the Solar System and about the building

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:29.560
blocks of life on Earth.

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:33.570
S.I. is for Spectral Interpretation.

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:38.250
Scientists characterize asteroids using telescopes
and by studying meteorites, rocks that have

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.799
fallen to Earth from space.

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:44.759
They study how an object's light is reflected
from an asteroid surface at different wavelengths

00:01:44.759 --> 00:01:46.560
- and call this a spectrum.

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.049
They also study how light is emitted from
the surface - as heat.

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:54.810
Comparing asteroid with meteorite spectra
allows scientists to interpret what an asteroid

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.610
is made of, how hot it is, and how big the
rocks on its surface are.

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.189
But to hold a piece of an asteroid and know
exactly where it came from, will allow scientists

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:08.269
to gauge how well they match what they see
through telescopes to meteorites and make

00:02:08.269 --> 00:02:11.830
future matching even more precise.

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:14.940
R.I. is for Resource Identification.

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:16.700
Asteroids could hold a lot of treasure.

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.840
Mining asteroids for precious metals and other
materials to bring back to Earth promises

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:21.840
profit.

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:25.600
But perhaps more important are the water and
other resources that will allow humans to

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:27.540
move out into space.

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:31.620
If we really want to explore or even live
beyond Earth, we'll need to find resources

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:36.860
in space to do that - it's just too expensive
to launch everything we'll need from Earth.

00:02:36.860 --> 00:02:41.630
Identifying what type of resources are available
on Bennu will be an important step for future

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:42.630
exploration.

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:44.830
S is for Security.

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:47.370
We know the Earth isn't always a secure place
to live.

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:51.550
The OSIRIS-REx mission will study the orbit
of Bennu to learn more about its potential

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:55.140
to strike Earth in about 200 years.

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:59.629
Understanding how the Yarkovsky effect alters
the orbit of this asteroid will provide information

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:04.010
that can improve our understanding of asteroid
orbits in general and lead to better protection

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:06.590
from asteroid impacts.

00:03:06.590 --> 00:03:10.459
R.E.x is for Regolith Explorer.

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:14.980
The word regolith is formed from two Greek
words meaning blanket and rock - it's the

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:20.330
layer of loose material over bedrock on a
small planetary body like an asteroid.

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:24.159
Exploring the regolith in detail will help
us understand composition and processes that

00:03:24.159 --> 00:03:25.720
occur on asteroid surfaces.

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:30.970
OSIRIS-REx will explore the regolith of Bennu
at the site where we collect the sample.

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:35.600
This will help us place the sample in context
and make the sample more scientifically valuable.

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:40.250
Over the next three years the OSIRIS-REx team
will ready the instruments and spacecraft.

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:45.599
Just as Osiris was re-formed from pieces scattered
around Egypt, OSIRIS-REx will grow from components

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:50.159
fabricated around the world into a spacecraft
that will travel to Bennu to assemble the

00:03:50.159 --> 00:03:53.220
pieces of the asteroid's story.

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:56.489
This small asteroid will help give us a big
picture.

00:03:56.489 --> 00:04:01.390
Combining the information about origins, spectra,
resources, orbit, and regolith will provide

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:06.000
the full story of this asteroid and clues
to the stories of many others.

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.090
This video is an OSIRIS-REx production.

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:13.439
OSIRIS-REx is a partnership of the University
of Arizona, NASA Goddard Space Flight Center

00:04:13.439 --> 00:04:14.090
and Lockheed Martin.
