There' s a lot of things you can do with chipboard,
and one of the things that I'm going to show

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.790
you is how to make a chipboard flower reef
for your mom for mother's day. So, I'm using

00:00:07.790 --> 00:00:12.830
the on board blossom and basics, and I'm just
chosen a couple flowers, and here they are.

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:16.010
So, the first thing that I'm going to do is,
I want some spring colored flowers so I've

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:21.760
chosen rose red, and regal rose, and these
are my craft, stamp, and spots, and I'm just

00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:33.750
going to ink up my flower, and then once I
get that inked up, I'm going to go ahead and

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:40.500
place it in my clear embossing powder. Actually,
I'm going to place it this way, pour a little

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:47.980
bit on top. O.k., give it a little shake,
make sure it's evenly covered, tap it when

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:52.470
it comes out, put your excess back, because
you don't want it flying everywhere once you

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:57.960
hit your heat gun. Alright, so now that I've
got that one done and ready to be heat embossed,

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:05.770
and I'm going to turn on my gun, I may be
holding it about two to three inches away,

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:11.110
and what I'm looking for is the colors is
to get a little brighter, and the glaze to

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:18.000
melt a little bit, and it's starting right
there, and I'm just going to move my gun a

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:26.800
little bit slowly, till the whole flower,
is nice and shiny. If you're doing this with

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:34.860
your children, just be careful. Help them
with this so they don't get any burns, putting

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:43.950
their hands to closely. So, once that's done,
I'm a just set that aside for a second and

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.380
let it cool, and I'm a put down my little
kick stand on my gun so I don't get hurt,

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:54.040
and set that aside, and now my next flower,
I'm going to use with regal rose, and the

00:01:54.040 --> 00:02:00.240
first few steps are exactly the same. I'm
just going to ink it up, put it into my clear

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.280
embossing powder, and heat it up.
