00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:07.140
There are only eight planets in the Solar System. At least, that we know of.

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.660
I mean, planets are pretty big and we have all these telescopes,

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:12.500
so you'd think we'd know if there was another one sitting around.

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:14.500
But some scientists aren't so sure

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:16.700
According to at least two teams of researchers

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:18.700
there might be a few more planet-sized worlds

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:20.700
lurking out beyond Neptune.

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:22.440
Of course there are lots of good scientific reasons

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:25.640
that some astronomers think it's unlikely that there are unknown planets out there.

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:27.640
For one thing, according to our best current theories

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.640
there's no way that the original disc of material

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.740
that formed the eight planets could have extended out that far.

00:00:32.740 --> 00:00:37.360
We measure distances in the Solar System in terms of Astronomical Units, or AU,

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:40.540
each one being equal to the distance between Earth and the Sun.

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:44.440
And our best estimates right now are that the original disc of planet-forming stuff

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:47.320
couldn't have extended more than 100 AU.

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:51.680
And this seems to make sense, because we haven't found any other planets beyond that.

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:56.940
NASA's space-based WISE telescope, which spends its time scanning the farthest reaches of the Solar System

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:02.320
has already determined that there aren't any objects larger than Jupiter within 26.000 AU from the Sun

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:05.140
and nothing larger than Saturn within 10.000 AU

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:10.380
But WISE is only designed to detect the hotter gas giants, so there could be other smaller rocky worlds

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.060
that just we haven't detected yet.

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.960
In March 2014, for example, scientists announced that they've discovered a dwarf planet sized object

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:21.500
orbiting the Sun called 2012 VP113 out beyond the Kuiper Belt.

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:27.980
Nicknamed 'Biden', makes its closest approach to the Sun, also known as its 'perihelion', about 80 AU away.

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:31.700
And that was gonna strike into astronomers because unlike some other kinds of objects, such as comets

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:38.080
which swing by really close every once in a while, Biden has the most distant perihelion of any object in the Solar System.

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:43.860
That means that its closest approach to the Sun is further out there than the perihelion of any other body around,

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:45.060
at least that we know of.

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.280
But its distance wasn't the only reason the object seemed weird.

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.960
An orbit is usually just a flat ellyptical path around the Sun, and most of the planets

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.080
orbit in approximately the same plane of the Solar System.

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.380
But Biden's orbit is tilted slightly above and below that plane

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.720
and its perihelion happens to occur right where its path starts to rise above it.

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:07.200
That in itself might not be such a big deal, except that almost every other known asteroid

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.540
whose orbits are so far away do the very same thing,

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:14.380
reaching the perihelion right where they cross the plane of the Solar System.

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:20.280
And according to researchers the best way to explain all those perihelia lining up is that a big distant planet

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:21.940
is affecting those orbits.

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:26.400
Specifically, they say that an undiscovered planet at least ten times the size of Earth,

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:34.220
quietly orbiting the Sun at a distance of 250 AU could be affecting the orbits of asteroids between 30 and 100 AU.

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:37.740
Find it hard to believe, that something that big could be out there, that we have never seen?

00:02:37.740 --> 00:02:43.260
Well, in May 2014 two Spanish astrophysicists concluded that there might actually be two new planets out there.

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.260
They looked at 13 known asteroids orbiting way out in this same general region.

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:51.500
They modeled the orbits of these objects and their findings match what the earlier study had predicted.

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:57.260
All 13 of them behaved like there was an unknown planet orbiting the Sun at 250 AU.

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:01.980
But they also noticed that five of the asteroids had orbits that were simillar in another weird way.

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:06.880
One pair of asteroids was taking almost exactly the same amount of time to orbit the Sun

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:10.300
and the other three were all taking precisely two thirds that time.

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:15.140
And that would make sense if these asteroids' orbits were being affected by yet another unknown planet.

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:19.320
This still hypothetical world the team says would be about 200 AU from the Sun

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:22.060
and would have a mass bigger than Mars but less than Saturn.

00:03:22.060 --> 00:03:25.900
So if the math is suggesting where this planets might be, why haven't we found them yet?

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:30.000
Well, if they exist, they're most likely distant, dark, and slow,

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.340
with such large orbits they'd definitely be hard to spot.

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:37.080
And there could be some other reason why the perihelia of all these asteroids line up

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:39.080
or why those five have such funky orbits.

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:43.500
Astronomers will get a big boost in their search for any of Earth's long lost planetary siblings

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:48.380
when the new Large Synoptic Survey Telescope in Chile comes online, in the early 2020's.

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:52.220
It's designed to look for dim, far away objects within our Solar System

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:57.020
so the hope is that if there are any more planets out there to be found, this telescope will find them.

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:00.220
So for all you people who were raised thinking there were nine planets in the Solar System,

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:04.800
maybe you were right, maybe there were more than that. Who knows what the future holds?
