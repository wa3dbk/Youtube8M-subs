how to build a fence on a slope and hill
in order to build the Pats on a sloping

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:18.070
hill

00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:22.320
but your posts in the normal fashion
keeping them level now you have to

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.060
decide which method will look better

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.260
you can either keep your panels run was
on TLE

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:33.570
like this or you can have them following
the contours a sloper hell

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:40.570
like this for slight slope let's just
keep your panel's horizontal

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.900
but as a slope increases following its
contour

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:48.290
stars to make more sense the matter
which method you use

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:53.350
always keep the slots running Berkel for
the horizontal method it's pretty

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:54.390
straightforward

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.400
run the bottom rail from just above the
ground level

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:01.690
on the high side the hell to appoint
perfectly level with this on the low

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:02.470
side

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:05.930
just a starting point for each panel

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:09.049
so that you how to build a fence on a slope

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:12.899
for the contour method render bottom
rail

00:01:12.899 --> 00:01:16.369
so that the spacing from the ground is
the same on both sides

00:01:16.369 --> 00:01:20.090
your top rail should follow the same
angle so that

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:23.299
its distance from the bottom rail it's
the same on both sides

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:28.200
now cut each slat at an angle so that it
remains vertical

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.630
and Pitts on the rails if you're using
la to sign your fence

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:35.909
cattle at an angle so the lattice
remains vertical follows the contours of

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:42.130
your friends

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:43.060
I think I've covered

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:46.980
everything in the process and I hope
that you have no further questions
