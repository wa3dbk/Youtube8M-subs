00:00:14.349 --> 00:00:17.039
this video is about how an MRI or

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:24.039
magnetic resonance imaging system
this is a display of two strong magnetic

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:26.259
field at idle

00:00:26.259 --> 00:00:33.259
by using a key messican see the magnetic
force is very very strong

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.710
this corner here from a two-year to do a
full

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.580
summit with my serious for take about 15
minutes

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:52.580
is receiving a panic button

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:55.970
that will stop the device and get her
how to OKC connects

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:59.700
going on and he will also receive fell

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:04.160
because the gradient force the poll on
the cause because really really loud

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:05.199
noise of

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:12.199
sound like a sledgehammer of something
you can probably hear a noise that

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:15.610
sounds almost like a singing bird

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:19.000
Leslie Dame helium cooling 40 am i

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:26.000
you buy it

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:35.050
the patient is now receiving and Tyler
now displaced over her cervical spine

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:42.100
the area that has to be examined

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:51.660
announces being poor into the MRI

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:09.800
not because of what it sounds like
inside the MRI

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:16.800
right now all

00:02:19.670 --> 00:02:21.640
as a stay at them enough control room

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:24.939
she's just that a very short overview
scam

00:02:24.939 --> 00:02:28.950
know she will mark the area that have to
be examined

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:33.540
factory yes 100

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.939
need much win he is now explaining a.m.
tenneco

00:02:37.939 --> 00:02:42.549
hollingworth something impinging on the
whole because basically absorbs

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:45.680
and the radiation dose um scattered

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:52.680
back from the body shown both produces
with a slight lead

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:56.139
you

00:02:56.139 --> 00:03:02.000
in

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.830
I'm everything clears the different
sound

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:10.400
the focus on domestic ones

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:13.050
yeah missus the final again in 2016

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:16.170
for on all yes we can see how you can
clearly see

00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:19.390
pigmentosa service by

00:03:19.390 --> 00:03:26.390
think fiercer photo of the blurry
scouting scan again

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:29.180
and this stuff

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:32.409
final in the draft sequence 22 I suppose

00:03:32.409 --> 00:03:37.269
you can see the pictures and become my
flickr photostream by the way the link

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:38.219
to some by your chip

00:03:38.219 --> 00:03:39.700
to know

00:03:39.700 --> 00:03:42.760
and as always if you have further
questions feel free to ask
