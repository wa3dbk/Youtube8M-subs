Welcome to College Avenue, a residence hall
constructed in 2006 with a suite-style living

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:19.160
environment. Let’s take a look inside!
On the first floor you will find the front

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:23.960
desk. Residents pick up all of their packages
here. All other mail is sorted and accessible

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:27.230
via the locked mailboxes located near the
front desk.

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:34.230
Down the hall is the main lounge, affectionately
named the “aquarium”, due to the wrap

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:39.030
around windows that flood the area with light.
The kitchen is connected to the main lounge,

00:00:39.030 --> 00:00:44.600
and is fully equipped with a fridge, sink,
microwave, and stove for residential use.

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:49.770
The laundry room is on the first floor of
College Avenue. All machines accept either

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:56.710
MU Student ID charge or quarters.
Each floor has multiple study rooms for students

00:00:56.710 --> 00:01:03.710
who need a quiet place to focus. College Ave
also offers a practice room for its students.

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:09.610
Now let’s take a look at a typical double
suite and floor lounge.

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:13.930
You will find a floor lounge on every floor
with multiple couches and a flat screen TV

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:18.360
where students gather and relax.
Now let’s look at the double suite, which

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:22.759
is two rooms with two students in each room
and one shared bathroom. Each student will

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:28.909
have a bunkable, height-adjustable bed, desk
and desk chair, study hutch with task light

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:33.029
and tack board, two-drawer mobile pedestal
and a closet with a shelf. 

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:39.300
The shared bathroom  will have two sinks, one toilet, and one shower.  

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:57.980
Hey I'm Carrie. I'm from the northren suburbs of Chicago and this is my roommate Sarah. Hi, I'm Sarah, I'm also from the northern suburbs of Chicago.  

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:03.494
I met my roommate on MyZou. And we bonded over our mutual love for Harry Potter if you want to check out the matching comforters. 

00:02:03.494 --> 00:02:05.076
We love living in College Ave! 

00:02:13.015 --> 00:02:18.215
Well I have to go study for this exam but we love living in the suit-style rooms. 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:21.100
It's really sharing a bathroom with your suit-mates  and getting to know them really well. 

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.600
 

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:22.600
See ya later! 

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:26.100

00:02:26.109 --> 00:02:31.040
which consist of four individual bedrooms,
with one student in each bedroom and one shared

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.250
bathroom. Check out the residential life website
