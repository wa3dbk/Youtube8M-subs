00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:04.560
You would expect that with the power of modern servers

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:05.430
and the growing bandwidth capacity

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:09.350
web application performance wouldn't be an issue, 
but what we found is that the

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:11.170
web application response time

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:15.349
the world's top 100 websites has increased by 32%

00:00:15.349 --> 00:00:19.360
over the last two years.
Why is this happening?

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:23.570
Because web page complexity and richness is constantly growing

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:28.710
there are more mobile users experiencing higher latency.
An application

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.399
infrastructure migrates to the cloud
with more control

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:33.280
over quality of experience.

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:38.329
So why should you care about web performance?

00:00:38.329 --> 00:00:41.710
Websites that perform slowly affect the perception of the brand

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:45.800
and ease of navigation. Recent research has
shown users surfing a website reported

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.879
a positive perception of the brand

00:00:47.879 --> 00:00:51.870
while other users surfing the same site,
with an added half second delay,

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.479
reported a three times more negative
perception of the same brand.

00:00:55.479 --> 00:01:00.079
Response time also affects business
metrics such as revenues

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:04.909
and page conversion ratios. 
Amazon's research shows that a faster

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:05.659
response time

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:10.080
of as little as 100 milliseconds can increase revenues by 1%.

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.399
To solve these challenges we bring you

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:16.940
Alteon NG, a next-generation ADC.

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:21.630
Alteon NG is designed with a special architecture called

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:26.299
separate vADC per application, providing
complete resource isolation between

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:30.420
instances, enablement of next generation services with predictable

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:31.259
performance,

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:35.039
on-demand scaling up, in and out.

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:38.440
The result?  SLA guaranteed.

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:42.920
Integrated application performance monitoring provides full application

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:43.629
visibility

00:01:43.629 --> 00:01:47.009
and SLA monitoring through measurement of real user transactions

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.080
including errors.

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:51.429
SLA tracking by application,

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:57.160
transaction, or location.
Out of the box value, requiring no scripting

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:00.920
or installations.

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:05.360
FastView, part of Alteon NG, provides the most
advanced web performance optimization

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.869
that accelerates application performance by up to 40%,

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:12.810
provides acceleration optimized per any
browser and end-user device,

00:02:12.810 --> 00:02:16.599
including mobile ones. As a result

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:20.120
it increases conversion rates, revenue, and productivity.

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.440
Alteon NG delivers proactive SLA management through the

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.870
ongoing monitoring of real user transactions, visibility via powerful

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:30.099
reporting,

00:02:30.099 --> 00:02:33.989
web optimization with FastView, while guaranteeing application's

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:38.209
SLAs at all times.

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:42.870
Alteon NG, the only ADC that fully ensures application SLA.
