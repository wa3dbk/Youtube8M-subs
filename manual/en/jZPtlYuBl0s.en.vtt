00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:13.440
This trick is called Leg Orbits, and it looks
like this.

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:19.770
An Orbit is any time a yoyo goes around you
body, part of your body, it is very similar

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.679
to a trick we have already learned, just the
Barrel Rolls (4A), and in this case instead

00:00:23.679 --> 00:00:27.560
of the yoyo going around your finger, it's
going to go around your leg.

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:32.460
When you are first working on this trick probably
the easiest way to do it is to just put your

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:35.030
leg right over the yoyo.

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:37.800
Just like the Barrel Rolls you are going to
swing the yoyo back and forth.

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.680
When it gets under your opposite hand you
are just going to pull up a little bit and

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:45.240
that should cause the yoyo to go right over
your leg, and of course you have to catch

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:47.890
it with your yoyo hand.

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:50.670
Then you just bring it back, and that is pretty
much the trick.

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.680
If you want it to look a little more interesting,
what you can actually do is you can whip the

00:00:54.680 --> 00:01:00.380
string underneath your leg, instead of just
moving your leg over the top of the yoyo.

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:03.719
That looks like this: you are just going to
pop it up, whip the string underneath your

00:01:03.719 --> 00:01:10.130
leg and then you can actually bring your hands
together and pull apart to grab the string

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:11.830
and open it up.

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:15.700
If you just want to work on on the whipping
motion without worrying about the orbit, that

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:18.300
is probably a good idea.

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:22.220
All you need to do is toss the yoyo up and
whip the string around.

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:27.160
You are going to bring your hands together
and grab the string and then pull your hands

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:29.510
apart, just to catch the yoyo.

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:34.050
When you want to bring it back into the Orbit,
it is the same thing except you whip the string

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:36.460
right under your leg.

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:43.650
You can actually do the reverse motion to
get the Orbit back from under your leg.

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:48.271
All you are going to do, again you start it,
you get it going and you are actually going

00:01:48.271 --> 00:01:53.580
to toss the yoyo up on the outside of your
body let go of the string and then bring your

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:56.680
hands together again and open it up to catch
it.

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:00.000
It is just the same concept and it kind of
completes the trick where whip under and then

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.350
whip over.

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:03.970
That is just one variation that you can do
with the Orbit.

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:06.630
That works with a lot of different Orbits,
so it is a good idea to learn it for this

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:07.880
trick.

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:08.880
Once you get it down it is not too hard.

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:10.390
Those are Leg Orbits.
