00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:11.570
It's the 
moment you've all been waiting for!

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:13.330
YOU CAN GO TO SPAAAAAACEEEE!

00:00:13.330 --> 00:00:17.760
But there's kind of a wicked side effectâ€¦

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:26.820
You'll get stupid.

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:31.320
Every month stories come out with civilian
space travel being JUST over the horizon.

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:33.730
When is it going to GET here already?!

00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:40.610
In 2004, when SpaceShipOne won the Ansari
X Prize, the headlines heralded an era of,

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:44.920
"space tourism," and the media predicted civilian
space travel was within our grasp.

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:51.289
There are companies that say this could be
THE year, but so far it has not come to fruition.

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:54.730
And to be honest, are you sure you want to
do it?

00:00:54.730 --> 00:00:59.109
Governments around the world work to minimize
the risks to space travel, and without a bottom

00:00:59.109 --> 00:01:05.330
line or investors, governments can move slowly
and build huge levels of safety.

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:11.800
Private companies are built on the idea of
competition and an open market, meaning they

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:17.510
inherently take more risks -- but risks when
it comes to the dangers of space travel?

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:18.510
// Nope.

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:19.510
Nope.

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:20.510
Nope.

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:21.510
I know what you're thinkingâ€¦

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:24.210
We're humans, we live for the risk and relish
the rewards, right?

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.780
Exploration and curiosity is part of being
a human!

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:32.350
Okay, to that I say, there's a litany of other
reasons not to go into space: space travel

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:37.560
makes you weak, stupid, sick and irradiated.

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.700
After more than 50 years of human spaceflight,
we know space travel can mess with your vision

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.790
and your mood and can even dull your reasoning
and reaction times.

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:49.430
Your eyeballs change shape in space, and your
vision may change as well.

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:53.140
Muscles and bones become weaker over time
too, atrophying due to lack of use.

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:59.101
A NASA study of missions from 2002-2005 found,
even with a rigorous exercise program, after

00:01:59.101 --> 00:02:05.100
on one to six months in space, astronauts
muscle volume decreased by 13 percent, and

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:07.550
power by nearly one third!

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:09.239
And it's not just muscles and bones.

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:14.540
A study in the Journal of Interferon &amp; Cytokine
Research by NASA found astronaut's immune

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.510
systems get a little freaky too.

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:21.530
Some immune cells overdo it, some underdo
it, causing increased allergies and allowing

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:27.829
viruses that would remain dormant on Earth
to get an asymptomatic foothold.

00:02:27.829 --> 00:02:33.629
But that's just for long-duration astronauts,
the short-term tourists ALSO have to worry

00:02:33.629 --> 00:02:36.939
aboutâ€¦ orienting ourselves to the environment.

00:02:36.939 --> 00:02:41.489
When we don't have an idea of what DOWN or
UP is, like in microgravity, the brain gets

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:44.790
confused, and it takes longer to react.

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:49.040
Some astronauts felt like they were spinning
or falling during their entire trip.

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:54.569
We're so hard-wired to look for the Earth
under our feet, even trained, professional

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:56.930
astronauts get confused or lost.

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:01.370
Without proper training, average peeps may
have an even stronger reaction.

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:04.670
Another thing short term-ers have to deal
with is cosmic radiation.

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:10.450
A NASA paper on space radiation said, on average
at solar minimum an astronaut could receive

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:17.549
160 milliSieverts of radiation over six months
-- a chest x-ray is one milliSievert.

00:03:17.549 --> 00:03:19.640
So that's like a chest x-ray every day!

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:23.499
Of course, most of these things would never
affect the casual space adventurer who goes

00:03:23.499 --> 00:03:28.489
up there one time, but people living on a
lunar colony, or on a mission to Mars will

00:03:28.489 --> 00:03:31.189
definitely have to deal with some of these.

00:03:31.189 --> 00:03:35.849
We have no idea how humans will fare outside
of the crib that is planet Earth!

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:57.489
Even with the dangers, would you want to get
out there into 

00:03:57.489 --> 00:03:57.780
the stars?!
