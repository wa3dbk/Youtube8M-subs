00:00:59.907 --> 00:01:01.825
take besan in a bowl.

00:01:07.409 --> 00:01:12.658
add little water to it and stir till a smooth paste is made.

00:01:24.211 --> 00:01:30.360
if excess water is put then bubbles are created and the paste is not smooth.

00:01:34.168 --> 00:01:35.415
now add little more water

00:01:39.658 --> 00:01:41.438
and beat the besan well.

00:01:50.358 --> 00:01:53.264
the paste needs to be consistent.

00:02:06.335 --> 00:02:26.960
add amchoor powder,garam masala, turmeric powder, dhaniya powder, salt and baking soda to the besan paste and beat rigorously.

00:02:29.386 --> 00:02:32.203
heat oil to fry the peanuts.

00:02:40.587 --> 00:02:43.660
put the peanuts into the paste as well and mix.

00:03:07.288 --> 00:03:12.642
to check if the oil has heated put one peanut

00:03:13.996 --> 00:03:19.928
if the oil hot then the peanut will rise up to the surface else it will sink.

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:33.237
use your  hand to put the peanuts in oil one at a time.

00:03:57.131 --> 00:04:02.345
fry the peanuts on a medium flame tilll they become brown.

00:04:03.953 --> 00:04:09.416
we will not fry them on a high flame as it will not make teh peanuts crispy.

00:04:18.506 --> 00:04:26.475
when the peanuts turn brown and crispy take them out of the pan 
and strain the excess oil with a strainer.

00:04:45.982 --> 00:04:50.779
repeat process with the remaining peanuts.

00:06:06.883 --> 00:06:17.170
sprinkle chat masala and red chilli powder (as desired)
on the peanuts and mix.

00:06:17.452 --> 00:06:33.831
if you prefer more of spicy 
then you can add red chilli powder to besan paste as well.

00:06:41.341 --> 00:06:43.733
crispy nut crackers are ready.

00:06:44.069 --> 00:07:02.109
allow it cool for atleast 2 hours before storing in a container
because a little heat too can make soft.
