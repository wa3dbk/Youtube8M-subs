00:00:34.372 --> 00:00:37.235
Tokai is going to start first, after that we are,
and finally Michigan.

00:00:37.318 --> 00:00:41.369
Hopefully we can gain on Tokai today and 
leave Michigan further behind us.

00:00:41.832 --> 00:00:45.551
Weather or no weather, fire or no fire,
we're going through.

00:01:00.163 --> 00:01:03.490
I had to drive the first part.
So we drove and drove and drove.

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:05.545
Not a lot of problems, but all
of a sudden there was a lot of smoke.

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:07.743
So I put on my mouth cap in Nuna.

00:01:07.957 --> 00:01:10.546
And we are driving straight towards the smoke.

00:01:10.832 --> 00:01:13.315
And slowly but surely I couldn't see the road anymore.

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:15.857
It was a wall of smoke.

00:01:16.534 --> 00:01:19.765
Scout drove through the smoke. I couldn't see Scout
anymore, but I heard through the comm-

00:01:20.169 --> 00:01:24.375
Convoy to the left, convoy to the left!
Road train, road train! Convoy to the left!

00:01:24.351 --> 00:01:27.297
I keep left, road train wooshes past me.

00:01:27.618 --> 00:01:28.580
It was really...

00:01:29.804 --> 00:01:30.802
...very thrilling.

00:01:31.325 --> 00:01:35.910
We're now at a make-shift Control Stop,
we originally imagined another Control Stop.

00:01:35.958 --> 00:01:39.771
But that Control Stop is now in flames, so
we made a new one 100 kilometers down the road.

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:42.765
Yeah, Tokai is already gone.

00:01:43.122 --> 00:01:45.367
They now have a bigger lead on us.

00:01:45.652 --> 00:01:49.323
We think Michigan is a bit further
behind us than this morning.

00:01:49.347 --> 00:01:51.450
We're not going to succumb to the Japanese.

00:01:51.735 --> 00:01:55.073
And we'll see how far we can get on our own strength.

00:01:56.237 --> 00:01:58.340
And that's only half of the story.

00:01:58.542 --> 00:02:00.086
Then it was my turn to drive.

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:05.991
Then out of nowhere a twister
or a whirlwind appears.

00:02:06.133 --> 00:02:10.743
You could see it from afar, 
kind of tall, you know.

00:02:10.980 --> 00:02:12.442
But we got closer and closer

00:02:12.466 --> 00:02:15.400
and suddenly that thing is
literally next to the road.

00:02:15.566 --> 00:02:17.895
And it's turning, turning, turning.

00:02:18.025 --> 00:02:21.269
You can see twigs and dust go up in the air.

00:02:21.304 --> 00:02:24.940
And then the air rose up
from under Nuna

00:02:24.963 --> 00:02:27.102
and the canopy opened up by itself.

00:02:27.518 --> 00:02:32.151
I think I enjoyed it more
than I was startled by it.

00:02:32.472 --> 00:02:35.156
Really, I will remember this till the day I die.

00:02:36.511 --> 00:02:38.388
I will be telling this to my grandchildren.

00:02:39.635 --> 00:02:40.681
Great day, man!
