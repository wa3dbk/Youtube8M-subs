00:00:00.579 --> 00:00:07.289
All right this video goes out to my buddy Johnny at expert boxing expert boxing calm in this video

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.679
I'm going to give you a breakdown of my heavy bag routine when I was competing and

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:16.859
Basically this is what I would do on a non sparring day on Sparring days. What I usually do is I

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:20.850
Want to get 10 rounds total so however many rounds?

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.729
I did up sparring if I did 6 I'd bang out four on the bag

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:29.340
Family did four rounds of sparring [I] get six rounds on the bag, but anyways on a non sparring day

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:32.220
this would be my routine and

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:33.390
I'm going to show you guys

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:37.230
How what I would do and how I'll organize it because half the battle is staying motivated

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:40.139
And so it helps to have some variety and have some things to do that are fun

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.379
And so I'm going to break it down for you right now real quick all right

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:47.890
Round one

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:50.129
Alright first thing I'd like to do is start with the jab

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:55.259
[get] my legs hands and feet warmed up gauging timing distance

00:00:56.079 --> 00:00:59.669
[losing] my head for a jab [my] [head] after [I] jab creating angles

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:02.759
Just started to think about how I'm gonna set up other shots in the later round

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:09.180
Round 2, Southpaw

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:14.790
Just to balance up my body work different shots &amp; Angles you never know when you're gonna need this tactics

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:20.729
Strategy in sparring or in a fight. It's good to have it one round. I dedicate the Southpaw

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:30.599
Round 3, head movements

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:36.750
I would emphasize, scooping, ducking snapbacks, moving my head after I punched and moving my head before I punch

00:01:37.299 --> 00:01:40.199
Extra emphasis on head movement, quick snapping slips

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.840
Always moving that head

00:01:55.970 --> 00:01:58.929
All right, round 4,5,6: Fight pace

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:06.309
This is what I'm throwing fast combos stories [or] combos move my head creating angles my footwork active

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:11.649
Just moving exactly how I move in a fight [you] get a pace high pressure on

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:26.320
All right, round 7. Feet KG slick on the outside

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:30.700
Faking, picking my shots not so busy with the hands

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:35.499
But picking with my shots quick get out home boom and back out again

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:38.110
Just being Cagey and cautious

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:57.449
All right round eight hand speed and punch volleys short quick punches. You should get the looseness

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.050
Speed fluidity in my hands nothing

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:04.649
Particular just let my mind go free let my hands go

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:16.169
All right, next round. Power shots. Bend my knees

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:21.209
Follow my [brow] turn my hips and shoulders keep everything in the shot

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:23.910
Bad intentions on these shots

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:35.290
And final round

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:38.670
My legs were spent and I was tired working on the inside

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:40.870
making it ugly

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:46.620
Getting in uncomfortably close up against the bag, slipping and dissing my head working the body working the head

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:49.140
turning the guy creating angles

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:51.390
Just staying busy

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:56.369
All right, so I hope this helps you guys give you getting some ideas and some ways to work a heavy bag

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:58.950
