Dear photography friend Hi!

00:00:01.991 --> 00:00:06.676
I’m Michael Zelbel. I'’m so lucky I’m over here in city of Beijing.

00:00:06.676 --> 00:00:11.622
With me I’ve got my friends Linxi, Sasha and Ajiao.

00:00:11.622 --> 00:00:16.520
We are in an apartment hotel which is a very simple apartment hotel

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:18.511
but we still can use this room

00:00:18.511 --> 00:00:20.635
to make some really rocking photos.

00:00:20.635 --> 00:00:25.175
I'’m going to show you how we are doing this, so keep on watching.

00:00:25.175 --> 00:00:29.508
When I was a teenager which is roughly 100 years ago,

00:00:29.508 --> 00:00:33.595
I was heavily into horsing riding can you see that? Ok.

00:00:33.595 --> 00:00:39.609
Nowadays photography not into horse riding anymore but why not use this horse riding props

00:00:39.609 --> 00:00:43.013
to spice up our photos over here in the apartment.

00:00:43.013 --> 00:00:48.122
It's about Asian models with western horse riding stuff in an apartment.

00:00:48.122 --> 00:00:54.265
Really crazy really weird. I think it's going to work beautifully.

00:00:54.265 --> 00:00:56.098
So let’s give it a try.

00:00:56.098 --> 00:01:02.344
I think those thinks will look much much better on our models let’s reserve it for them.

00:01:02.344 --> 00:01:03.736
Let’'s make the light.

00:01:03.736 --> 00:01:10.201
It’'s going to be a bit complicated but don'’t fear we will get there.

00:01:10.201 --> 00:01:15.442
I want the light to come from on top to the bottom.

00:01:15.442 --> 00:01:19.385
I want the models to pose on the ground and the light to come from on top.

00:01:19.385 --> 00:01:23.706
For that I prepared this thing which is just a simple multi clamp.

00:01:23.706 --> 00:01:28.400
I put a second hotshoe into the multi clamp so that I can attach two speedlights

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:36.125
and this because I want to hang it and the only thing I’'ve got to hang it

00:01:36.125 --> 00:01:38.528
under the ceiling is a piece of a twine.

00:01:38.528 --> 00:01:46.423
I thought if I add a 2nd speedlights to the multi clamp then at least in theory it should be somehow balanced.

00:01:46.423 --> 00:01:49.511
I think that's hanging pretty stable.

00:01:49.511 --> 00:01:56.515
Under the ceiling over here we have this air condition thing.

00:01:56.515 --> 00:02:05.851
What I can do using this clothes hanger from the hotel to hang this little sucker over here.

00:02:05.851 --> 00:02:11.586
Good! This will give us a cone of light but the light would be very hard.

00:02:11.586 --> 00:02:20.513
I want to soften that. For that I’'m going to use like pretty much always a shoot-through umbrella.

00:02:20.513 --> 00:02:25.452
Put it into the multi clamp, there we go.

00:02:25.452 --> 00:02:34.181
Now we have nice and soft light but the umbrella will spill it everywhere.

00:02:34.181 --> 00:02:37.202
The whole room will be enlightened and I don'’t want that.

00:02:37.202 --> 00:02:41.768
I want the room to be dark. I want to give just a hint that this thing is

00:02:41.768 --> 00:02:46.296
happening in a hotel room but I don'’t want to enlighten any of the furniture over here.

00:02:46.296 --> 00:02:53.522
So I have to shade it somehow so that the light just goes to the ground and doesn'’t spill anywhere else.

00:02:53.522 --> 00:02:59.515
For that I’m using the black material of my reflector.

00:02:59.515 --> 00:03:06.312
Don'’t know how they call it but this is what I mean.

00:03:06.312 --> 00:03:13.576
I attach it with clamps to another clothes hanger. Let's hang it the other way round.

00:03:13.576 --> 00:03:19.725
Hang it in front of the umbrella and wrap it around.

00:03:19.725 --> 00:03:33.514
So, now you cannot see the umbrella anymore which means

00:03:33.514 --> 00:03:36.994
the umbrella, or the light from the umbrella cannot see you anymore.

00:03:36.994 --> 00:03:43.766
I mean we learned light always travels in a straight line unless you are close to a black hole.

00:03:43.766 --> 00:03:46.596
We are over here in Beijing. There are no black holes over here.

00:03:46.596 --> 00:03:52.942
So the light will just go down and not hit any of the furniture and this is what we want to achieve.

00:03:52.942 --> 00:03:58.429
To make the area over here, the ground, a little bit more interesting and crazy

00:03:58.429 --> 00:04:05.565
I got this special thing and now this is where our German carnival tradition comes in very handy.

00:04:05.565 --> 00:04:09.101
You know, we German people once per year we are running around

00:04:09.101 --> 00:04:13.592
in the most crazy costumes like for example this skirt.

00:04:13.592 --> 00:04:22.299
But now this skirt will double beautifully as "straw", which matches the horse riding theme.

00:04:22.299 --> 00:04:34.588
I put the straw over here and I will give the light a try.

00:04:34.588 --> 00:04:42.563
This is now very far away from the light source but it will give us an idea about the light.

00:04:42.563 --> 00:04:47.998
We set the two flashes to the umbrella to 1/4th of their power.

00:04:47.998 --> 00:04:53.853
We fill in with 1/128 of power from on-camera just to fill in the shadows a little, little  bit.

00:04:53.853 --> 00:05:03.678
I go to f/8, ISO200. That should do the trick. Let’s give it a try.

00:05:03.678 --> 00:05:17.275
Beautiful! Really charming light and concentrated to the straw.

00:05:17.275 --> 00:05:24.708
Great! Now we are ready to pose the first model.

00:06:00.212 --> 00:06:04.738
[Claps] Attention! Yeah! The photos were really really beautiful

00:06:04.738 --> 00:06:09.427
and the setup was not complicated after all. It was quite simple.

00:06:09.427 --> 00:06:14.237
If you find this inspiring if you like this video please give me a feed back.

Please come to my website www.Zelbel.com. Go to my blog and tell me what you think about it.

00:06:19.802 --> 00:06:26.696
Until then I wish you a lot of fun with you shoots, with your top light situations

00:06:26.696 --> 00:06:33.426
and I wish you really good light!

00:06:33.426 --> 00:06:36.000
