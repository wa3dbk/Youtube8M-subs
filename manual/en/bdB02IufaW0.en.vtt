00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:04.070
I think you're making a mistake.

00:00:04.070 --> 00:00:05.910
I think you really want to talk to me.

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.371
Sorry, I have three other interviews to do
before this party is over.

00:00:08.371 --> 00:00:11.610
Yeah but they aren't working on something
that'll change the world as we know it.

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:13.570
They say they are.

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:18.880
Yeah, but they're lying
There is a limit even to the imagination.

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:20.510
Human Teleportation.

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:26.080
Molecular decimnation, breakdown and reformation
is inherently purging.

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:31.660
Where our greatest creations meet our deepest
fears.

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:32.940
Something went wrong Seth.

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.090
When you went through, something went wrong.

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:43.860
You are about to go beyond that limit.

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:49.079
Those weird hairs that were growing out of
your back, I haven't analysed.

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:51.090
But they were definitely not human.

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:55.239
If you saw how scared and angry and desperate
he is.

00:00:55.239 --> 00:00:58.690
I'm sure Typhoid Mary was a very nice person
too when you saw her socially.

00:00:58.690 --> 00:00:59.690
No!

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:02.590
You're afraid to be destroyed and recreated,
aren't ya?

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:06.190
You're changing Seth, everything about you
is changing.

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:10.571
Oh no, What's happening to me and I dying?

00:01:10.571 --> 00:01:12.020
I want to know what's going on.

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:13.130
What does the disease want?

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.890
It wants to turn me into something else.

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:17.000
Oh no.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.240
A fly got into the transmitter pod me that
first time when I was alone.

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:22.240
Don't go back to him.

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:23.689
It could be contagious.

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:25.369
I'm afraid!

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:27.140
Don't be afraid!

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:30.120
No, be afraid, be very afraid.

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:31.120
Scream
Help Me.

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:32.120
Please, help me.

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.122
The Fly
