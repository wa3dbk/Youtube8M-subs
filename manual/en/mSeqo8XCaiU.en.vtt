Hi, this is Andy Wilkinson from SkinnyGainMuscle.com,
with another video lesson on how to gain weight

00:00:10.549 --> 00:00:13.170
if you're skinny.
And we're going to keep this video really

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:18.000
short, so you really get a key understanding
of the main points, and go put them into ACTION

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.340
to get great results.
So the question here is:

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:25.960
"How Quickly Can You Expect To Get Results,
And Gain Lean Muscle Weight, By Following

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:31.670
A Good Weight Gain Program?"
So when it comes to how quickly you can expect

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:37.050
to gain weight, as long as you're training
and eating properly to gain weight, you can

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:44.810
expect to gain between 4 and 5 pounds of healthy
lean muscle weight PER MONTH. Anything more

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:49.059
than that is just likely to be fat.
And another important fact to know is that

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:54.229
about 75% of muscle tissue is made up of water.
So you want to make sure that you're properly

00:00:54.229 --> 00:00:57.439
hydrated at all times, to encourage your body
to gain weight.

00:00:57.439 --> 00:01:02.559
And something that's optional - if you want
to SPEED UP your weight gains, as part of

00:01:02.559 --> 00:01:07.299
a weight training program - is to consider
taking a Creatine Monohydrate supplement.

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:12.509
You see, creatine is the most widely researched
supplement in the world. And one of its effects

00:01:12.509 --> 00:01:17.780
is to increase water retention in muscle tissue.
Taking this approach, it's not uncommon for

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:24.460
guys to gain as much as say 5-10 lbs in weight,
in just a 3-4 week period, when they're training

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:29.749
hard. Plus, creatine can help you sustain
greater effort in your weight training sessions,

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:33.710
so you develop greater strength and muscle
mass at the same time.

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:38.030
Again, just to remember though that creatine
is NOT necessary to gain weight and gain lean

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:42.979
muscle. But it can help speed up your weight
gains if you want maximize and accelerate

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:47.179
your progress.
Otherwise, a 4-5 pound increase PER MONTH

00:01:47.179 --> 00:01:51.109
is totally reasonable to expect if you're
skinny and training to gain weight.

00:01:51.109 --> 00:01:55.789
Okay, that brings us to the end of this video.
