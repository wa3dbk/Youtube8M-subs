success on the climbing wall we have

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.039

adaptive Traverse wall features a

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:14.970
surface which is both magnetic and
dry-erase and invites cognitive learning

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.470
creativity and physical play the
interactive surface provides

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:23.520
opportunities to teach fundamental
learning skills such as letters words

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:26.790
and math
and allows communication and formal

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:32.220
written words and diagrams the adaptive
wall from Everlast climbing includes

00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.270
specially designed adaptive hand and
footholds that provide additional

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.940
stability and extra support the 5 inch
deep ledge footholds are available in

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:46.890
two lengths these wide holds have a larger
surface area and helped climbers

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.930
maintain balance and lessen fatigue the
hand holds feature a comfortable grab

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:56.420
bar that allows for a secure grip and
can be mounted vertically horizontally

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:02.060
or at any angle for versatility the
design lets children wrap their entire

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:08.080
hands around the bars for added
stability and sense of control

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:25.000
In partnership with the national Lekotek
center Everlast climbing conducted a

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:29.310
therapeutic play session to evaluate the
use of the adaptive climbing wall with

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:34.590
children of all abilities Lekotek is a
not-for-profit organization that uses

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:38.640
