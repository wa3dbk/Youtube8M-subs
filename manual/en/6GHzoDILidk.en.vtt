00:00:01.390 --> 00:00:26.400
There are some questions you don't ask, right?

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.909
You just leave well enough alone.

00:00:27.909 --> 00:00:31.310
For example, how have I gone without ever
reviewing a Wipeout game?

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:32.369
I review all the bad games.

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:33.890
How have I escaped these ones?

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:35.500
I don't know, I don't ask.

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:36.570
Or I didn't ask.

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.550
But then I ended up with two Wipeout games
in the same week.

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:41.910
And not only two Wipeout games...

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:45.190
The same Wipeout game, on two different platforms.

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:49.060
I guess the universe has a way of, just...evening
things out.

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:50.940
By the way, uh...f*ck you, universe.

00:00:50.940 --> 00:01:02.550
If you 
caught our review of Wipeout: Create and Crash

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.909
for the Xbox 360, you'll know that I reviewed
that game.

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:09.729
And you'll also know that...I was kind of
a mess, in that review.

00:01:09.729 --> 00:01:13.580
Listen, I give every game a fair shake, but...that
game just sucks.

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:16.119
It's actually incredible, how much it sucks.

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:17.119
Like, on its own.

00:01:17.119 --> 00:01:19.340
That's before you add Kinect to the equation.

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.500
You can imagine how that affects the sum.

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:24.670
Or you can consult my review and watch me
have a mental breakdown.

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:26.020
There's some math, for you.

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:33.250
Serenity plus now.

00:01:33.250 --> 00:01:41.189
Anyway, here I am with the Wii U version.

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:43.790
And surprisingly, there's some good news.

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:48.430
Uh, this one doesn't have you jumping around
like an over-caffeinated wallaby, so there's

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:49.430
that.

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:51.539
You just play it with the GamePad, so ten
points.

00:01:51.539 --> 00:01:53.729
That gets the score up to, what?

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:55.020
Negative 30?

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:58.590
Also, there's a decent multiplayer mode exclusive
to the Wii U.

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:03.689
Don't me wrong, it's still a lousy game, but...it's
less lousy, I guess?

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:12.400
I don't know, this is what happens you play
too much Wipeout.

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:17.180
So if you have no idea what's going on here,
uh...Wipeout is a TV show, where people run

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.360
through an obstacle course, and hurt themselves.

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.170
This is a game where you run through an obstacle
course, and hurt your brain.

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:25.540
I mean, people must buy theseâ€”there's a
new one released every year.

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:28.450
But for the life of me, I have no idea why.

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.340
I guess, multiplayer?

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:32.209
Like, watching your friends fail?

00:02:32.209 --> 00:02:35.400
But that's fun in the same way doing anything
with your friends is fun.

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.129
Doesn't mean the game's any good.

00:02:37.129 --> 00:02:40.000
And it's...really not.

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.900
Since it's the same core game as the 360 version,
all the same criticisms apply.

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:49.190
A physics system from hell, clunky gameplay,
bad production, repetitive everything.

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:51.209
Also, John Henson.

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:55.430
You can actually feel your brain being drained
when you play Wipeout games, and that's the

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:56.580
case with this one, too.

00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:59.860
The only difference is...now, you can design
your own courses.

00:02:59.860 --> 00:03:02.390
And on the Wii U, there's a GamePad multiplayer
mode.

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:05.930
You can tap the screen to throw balls at your
friends while they're running the courses

00:03:05.930 --> 00:03:06.930
with a Wii Remote.

00:03:06.930 --> 00:03:09.190
And to be fair, that's pretty cool.

00:03:09.190 --> 00:03:11.940
That's the most fun you'll ever have with
a Wipeout game.

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:16.409
In fact, that mode is so cool relative to
the rest of the game...I'm gonna go ahead

00:03:16.409 --> 00:03:18.690
and say the Wii U version is the way to go.

00:03:18.690 --> 00:03:23.690
Partly because Kinect sucks, partly because
the Wii version is a low-res mess...partly

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:25.770
because I'm grasping at straws here.

00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:28.310
Otherwise, though...same terrible Wipeout
game.

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:36.390
With the same terrible audio.

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:42.180
I don't even have anything to say about that.

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:47.290
Anyway, to the game's credit...the level editor
is nice and simple, and the ability to share

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:48.950
your creations is a nice touch.

00:03:48.950 --> 00:03:51.810
On the other hand, then you have to actually
play them.

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:53.400
No thanks, on that one.

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:57.750
The GamePad Trap Attack mode is alright, but
only in comparison to the rest of the game,

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:58.750
which isn't.

00:03:58.750 --> 00:03:59.750
I don't know.

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:02.909
Watch my 360 review, to see the effect this
game actually has on people.

00:04:02.909 --> 00:04:05.580
I can tell you this, it's certainly not pretty.

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:11.400
It's Wipeout: Crash and Create for the Wii
U.
