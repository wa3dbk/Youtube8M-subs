00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.930
Critics are up in arms about the World Cup
gender gap. The prize money for women is far

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:11.190
less than for men. Commentators attribute
the gap to sexism and what some call the grass ceiling.

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:18.420
Could they be right? Let’s review the evidence.
Coming up next on the Factual Feminist.

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:25.070
This summer, the U.S. women’s soccer team electrified
the nation when it defeated Germany 2–0

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:30.109
and then Japan 5–2 to win the World Cup.
Instead of celebrating the team’s brilliant

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:35.250
play and the continuing growth of women’s
soccer, many in the media are fixating on

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:40.320
what they see as a shameful “World Cup pay
gap.” The U.S. women’s team collected

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:45.879
only $2 million in prize money for its victory
over Japan. But for the corresponding men’s

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:51.190
competition in 2014, the winning German team
won $35 million—while the Americans, who

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:57.300
lost in the round of 16, took home $8 million.
Spurred by the media reports, Senator Patrick

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:02.309
Leahy of Vermont introduced a resolution on
the floor of the U.S. Senate urging FIFA,

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:07.930
the organization that sponsors the World Cup,
to “immediately eliminate gender pay inequity”:

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:12.640
Here is where I think the Senator and the
media critics go wrong. The prize disparity

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.000
has much more to do with sports economics than sexism.

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.440
The women’s players are
formidable athletes and the Women’s World

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:23.580
Cup is growing rapidly in popularity, especially
in the U.S., but it’s still nowhere near

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:29.460
the men’s cup in terms of world popularity.
According to FIFA, the 2011 Women’s World

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:37.090
Cup had an audience reach of less than 250 million viewers. For the men’s World Cup

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:45.390
in, 2010 the figure was 2.2 billion. That same year, the men’s World Cup generated nearly $3.7

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:52.700
billion in revenue, while the women’s World
Cup generated about $73 million. Now FIFA may be a

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.280
troubled organization, and sexism can probably be counted among its many vices—but the

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:01.050
differences in its men’s and women’s prizes
are actually less than the differences in

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:08.200
its revenues from the two competitions. Market forces, rather than sexism, appear to explain the pay gap in soccer.

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:17.310
Well, the sports equity activists have heard all of this before, and they have a reply. “Why accept market forces?” they ask. After all,

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.750
these forces were shaped by a culture that
has been hostile to women, traditionally. Shane

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:27.120
Ferro, a feminist business reporter at Business
Insider says it this way: “Most of us

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:30.719
have been socialized to accept men’s sports
as dominant, and somehow automatically more

00:02:30.719 --> 00:02:34.950
interesting.” And once society internalizes
a falsehood, she says, “it’s very hard

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:41.129
to correct it.” Hard, but apparently not impossible because now there is now a call by sports equity activists

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:46.280
to change the market by re-socializing fans.
“Sports fans, for the most part, will watch

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:52.010
whatever you put in front of them,” says
Kavitha Davidson at Bloomberg News. She thinks we should highlight

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:56.510
the women’s teams, and fan interest and
excitement will come. A recently published

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:00.579
study by two feminist sociologists
comes to the same conclusion. The authors

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:05.709
lament that women’s sports receive only
about 3% of network TV attention, down from

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:13.019
5% in 1989. Major sports media, they say,
is a “place set up by men for men to celebrate

00:03:13.019 --> 00:03:18.099
men’s sensational athletic accomplishments”
while giving short shrift to women’s achievements.

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:23.540
They acknowledge that there are fewer female
teams, so they suggest for now the media increase

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:30.359
coverage of women’s sports to 12–18%.
They also specify that the sportscasters should

00:03:30.359 --> 00:03:35.489
report on women’s sports with the same “enthusiasm”
as men’s sports. More coverage plus more

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:39.829
enthusiasm will increase the fan base, and
that will drive up women’s salaries and

00:03:39.829 --> 00:03:45.969
prizes. Well, I think it might be the gender sociologists and the feminist journalists—not the sports

00:03:45.969 --> 00:03:50.959
fans— who have internalized a falsehood.
There are athletic competitions where women

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:56.669
attract more fans than men—figure skating
and gymnastics, for example. And women’s

00:03:56.669 --> 00:04:02.269
tennis, while not as popular as men’s, certainly
has a large and devoted audience. But when

00:04:02.269 --> 00:04:07.439
it comes to team sports like basketball, football
and soccer, no amount of affirmative-action

00:04:07.439 --> 00:04:13.519
enthusiasm is going to even the score. Men
are stronger, faster, and bigger than women,

00:04:13.519 --> 00:04:19.030
both on average and at the extremes. Most
fans—not all, but most—want to see the

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:24.070
sport they love played at the highest level.
Men’s professional team sports are a fascination

00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:29.070
to many millions of fans because they offer
extreme competition, performance, and heroics.

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:35.200
Women’s team sports, however skilled and
admirable, rarely compare in Promethean drama.

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:40.290
There is a fallacy at the heart of the sports
equity argument. The equity activists insist

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:46.510
that male and female athletes should be treated
the same; while accepting that the sexes are

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:52.140
different and must play on separate teams.
To be consistent, they should call for integrated

00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:59.090
teams and let men and women compete together for the same audiences and same prizes. That would end

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:04.890
the career of most female athletes, but a
few would make it and, if it’s a popular

00:05:04.890 --> 00:05:09.410
sport like basketball or soccer, they would
likely become the richest and most famous

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:14.250
athletes of all time. I doubt that politicians
and activist journalists will actually propose

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:18.920
this—but it makes as much sense as insisting
that women’s teams with separate standards

00:05:18.920 --> 00:05:24.730
of performance must be given the same salary,
prizes, publicity, and enthusiasm that the

00:05:24.730 --> 00:05:30.570
men’s teams enjoy. My suggestion: let’s
take the gender politics out of sports altogether

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:36.160
and just enjoy the games. If you found this
