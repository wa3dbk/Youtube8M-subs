00:00:00.351 --> 00:00:04.371
"Whose Line"!
Dani and Marcão, stand up.

00:00:04.371 --> 00:00:09.952
They will get two sentences
from this box,

00:00:09.952 --> 00:00:16.874
sentences written by the audience,
and they will use them

00:00:16.874 --> 00:00:21.334
during the scene,
and they have to make sense.

00:00:21.334 --> 00:00:25.506
Why is that sentence
is there, in that way.

00:00:25.506 --> 00:00:31.088
You in blue, could you stand up?
Yeah, the bowling player.

00:00:31.088 --> 00:00:33.278
What's your name?
Rafael.

00:00:33.278 --> 00:00:38.708
Our musician will play something and I
wanna know what comes to your mind.

00:00:38.708 --> 00:00:41.380
Dani, play anything...

00:00:55.201 --> 00:00:57.301
Rafael, what did you think?

00:00:57.301 --> 00:01:02.473
- Carousel.
- Carousel! So cute...

00:01:03.173 --> 00:01:10.373
The title for "Whose Line"
is 'Carousel'. Go!

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:28.472
- Samuel!
- Yeah!

00:01:29.692 --> 00:01:36.084
We're on this carousel for like,
four hours! Does it never stop?

00:01:36.084 --> 00:01:42.706
- My horse doesn't get tired!
- Just like mine! Right, horse?

00:01:43.386 --> 00:01:46.056
I'm starting to get hungry!

00:01:46.056 --> 00:01:51.577
- I guess your mom left the park...
- Cripes...

00:01:53.127 --> 00:01:58.231
But... Gosh...
I don't wanna be here forever!

00:01:58.481 --> 00:02:02.062
Poor thing, poor thing,
poor thing!

00:02:08.923 --> 00:02:12.626
But if we stay here forever,
it could be so cool!

00:02:12.626 --> 00:02:16.997
Look at me: Backside!

00:02:16.997 --> 00:02:20.757
- Whare did you learn that, man?
- I saw it in a movie!

00:02:20.757 --> 00:02:24.527
Look: Standing up!

00:02:24.527 --> 00:02:28.619
Are you... Surfing?

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.371
Let me tell you something...

00:02:36.371 --> 00:02:38.663
If you stay forever in this park,

00:02:38.663 --> 00:02:44.914
we might...
Ow, I shaved my whole body today!

00:02:45.334 --> 00:02:49.264
Poor thing, poor thing,
poor thing!

00:02:49.864 --> 00:02:55.495
I shaved and my horse
has no saddle, so it hurts!

00:02:55.495 --> 00:03:00.566
I'm on this horse for four hours,
I'm gonna change,

00:03:00.566 --> 00:03:05.857
I'm getting another one,
this one is cooler...

00:03:06.087 --> 00:03:08.287
What is this one?

00:03:08.747 --> 00:03:13.529
- It's a pegasus!
- It's got wings!

00:03:13.529 --> 00:03:16.392
- Is it a pegasus?
- It's a pegasus!

00:03:16.392 --> 00:03:19.992
I'm jumping on the pegasus!

00:03:21.072 --> 00:03:25.464
I used to see the pegasus on TV...

00:03:25.964 --> 00:03:29.045
My life is in danger!

00:03:30.978 --> 00:03:36.577
I'm afraid of the pegasus! What if it starts
to fly instead of staying on the carousel?

00:03:36.577 --> 00:03:39.838
Yeah, you could die!

00:03:40.038 --> 00:03:42.208
You're gonna save me, right?

00:03:42.208 --> 00:03:45.358
'Cause you're all shaved.

00:03:46.289 --> 00:03:50.081
One, and two, and...

00:03:50.981 --> 00:03:56.511
Poor thing, poor thing,
poor thing!

00:04:03.006 --> 00:04:07.905
If you got yours, I'll get mine!

00:04:08.245 --> 00:04:12.197
Now, some butt cleavage
for everyone!

00:04:12.197 --> 00:04:14.657
I run, but I can't reach it!

00:04:17.938 --> 00:04:21.298
I'm jumping on you!

00:04:21.298 --> 00:04:24.298
I'm jumping now!

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:31.792
- Almost broke the horse... - I could
stay here for another four hours!

00:04:31.792 --> 00:04:37.383
Let's stay here for as long
as we can, because...

00:04:37.383 --> 00:04:40.645
If we stay long, we could...

00:04:40.645 --> 00:04:44.046
Someone stole my hamster!

00:04:44.456 --> 00:04:49.879
- I wanna leave!
- Poor thing, poor thing, poor thing!

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:57.093
"Whose Line"!

00:04:59.793 --> 00:05:03.064
Was that a pegasus, Elidio?

00:05:03.424 --> 00:05:08.575
Yes. Pegasus, the
mythological winged horse...

00:05:08.575 --> 00:05:11.886
Who originated the
'Saint Seiya' animes...

00:05:12.287 --> 00:05:15.187
CIA. BARBIXAS DE HUMOR

00:05:17.588 --> 00:05:21.988
IMPROVÁVEL
Probably a good show.
