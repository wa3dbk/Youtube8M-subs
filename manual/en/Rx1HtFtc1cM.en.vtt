00:00:00.115 --> 00:00:03.999
(jazzy music)

00:00:03.999 --> 00:00:05.027
Male: We're in the Musee du Louvre,

00:00:05.027 --> 00:00:06.660
and we're looking at Gros' massive canvas

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:08.754
of Napoleon at the Pest House in Jaffa.

00:00:08.754 --> 00:00:10.809
Female: We're clearly not in Paris.

00:00:10.809 --> 00:00:12.030
Male: No, this is the Middle East.

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:13.498
What's happening is the forces under

00:00:13.498 --> 00:00:16.392
Napoleon are fighting the British.

00:00:16.392 --> 00:00:18.669
In doing so, they came into contact

00:00:18.669 --> 00:00:19.446
with the plague.

00:00:19.446 --> 00:00:21.401
What Napoleon has done with his soldiers

00:00:21.401 --> 00:00:23.234
that have contracted plague is to put them

00:00:23.234 --> 00:00:25.193
in a kind of quarantine in a makeshift hospital

00:00:25.193 --> 00:00:27.028
in a mosque in Joffa,

00:00:27.028 --> 00:00:30.524
and according to the story, visited them in 1799.

00:00:30.524 --> 00:00:32.777
This painting was made five years later

00:00:32.777 --> 00:00:36.442
and is a really romantic and somewhat sanitized

00:00:36.442 --> 00:00:38.805
view of apparently what really happened.

00:00:38.805 --> 00:00:41.267
Female: By the time Napoleon commissions this,

00:00:41.267 --> 00:00:44.162
Napoleon is emperor of France where he had

00:00:44.162 --> 00:00:45.693
been just the general of the army

00:00:45.693 --> 00:00:46.743
when it actually happened.

00:00:46.743 --> 00:00:50.164
Napoleon obviously recognizes the enormous value

00:00:50.164 --> 00:00:54.131
of art as propaganda and so shows himself

00:00:54.131 --> 00:00:59.875
almost Christ-like visiting this makeshift hospital,

00:00:59.875 --> 00:01:03.156
disregarding the doctors and the fellow soldiers

00:01:03.156 --> 00:01:05.210
around him who are saying cover your mouth,

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:08.625
don't breathe in the air here, this is very contagious.

00:01:08.625 --> 00:01:13.411
He walks through, Christ-like, unafraid of contagion,

00:01:13.411 --> 00:01:18.410
and even touches the sores of one of the plague victims.

00:01:18.410 --> 00:01:21.211
Male: Gros has actually borrowed directly

00:01:21.211 --> 00:01:23.911
from the [Belvedere] in his rendering of Napoleon.

00:01:23.911 --> 00:01:26.365
Napoleon is functioning as both Christ-like

00:01:26.365 --> 00:01:27.767
and borrowing directly from

00:01:27.767 --> 00:01:29.327
the greatest Classical tradition.

00:01:29.327 --> 00:01:31.995
The story itself is actually apparently a really nasty one

00:01:31.995 --> 00:01:34.799
because there were reports that Napoleon had

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:36.100
actually forced his sick troops to drink

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:38.052
laudanum in order to kill them.

00:01:38.052 --> 00:01:39.549
The other part of the story is that

00:01:39.549 --> 00:01:41.842
Napoleon had the prisoners that he

00:01:41.842 --> 00:01:45.221
had taken in battle bayoneted in part

00:01:45.221 --> 00:01:47.714
because he didn't want to have to be slowed down by them

00:01:47.714 --> 00:01:49.965
and he didn't want to waste his gunpowder on them.

00:01:49.965 --> 00:01:51.767
Female: So we have none of that sense

00:01:51.767 --> 00:01:55.131
of the truth of battle and war here.

00:01:55.131 --> 00:01:56.239
Male: No, this is pure propaganda.

00:01:56.239 --> 00:01:58.101
Female: This is pure propaganda for Napoleon

00:01:58.101 --> 00:02:00.633
who makes himself look like a divine leader.

00:02:00.633 --> 00:02:03.104
When I said at the beginning, "This isn't Paris,"

00:02:03.104 --> 00:02:06.465
I said that in part because this would have looked

00:02:06.465 --> 00:02:09.041
very foreign and exotic

00:02:09.041 --> 00:02:12.163
to the viewers at the Paris Salon in 1804;

00:02:12.163 --> 00:02:15.262
clearly Islamic architecture,

00:02:15.262 --> 00:02:17.633
clearly a very far away place,

00:02:17.633 --> 00:02:20.860
figures wearing turbans and exotic clothing.

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:23.435
In a way, part of the appeal of this painting

00:02:23.435 --> 00:02:26.129
was its exoticism and the beginnings,

00:02:26.129 --> 00:02:27.830
really, of orientalism.

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:29.551
Male: It's interesting to see how Gros

00:02:29.551 --> 00:02:31.387
has handled the composition

00:02:31.387 --> 00:02:33.218
You have the figures in the foreground,

00:02:33.218 --> 00:02:36.029
a kind of stage set, that is really

00:02:36.029 --> 00:02:38.598
organized by the architecture and by that

00:02:38.598 --> 00:02:41.433
frieze of the Islamic arches that you had mentioned.

00:02:41.433 --> 00:02:42.532
Then, of course, we have

00:02:42.532 --> 00:02:44.100
this extraordinary expanse beyond it.

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:45.826
We have the figures that have died

00:02:45.826 --> 00:02:48.495
or that are terribly sick in the shadows.

00:02:48.495 --> 00:02:50.798
Of course, Napoleon is lit by the sun.

00:02:50.798 --> 00:02:53.111
Female: We have that feeling of kind of

00:02:53.111 --> 00:02:56.716
Caravaggio lighting, extremes of light and dark,

00:02:56.716 --> 00:02:59.875
of strong dramatic contrasts in light,

00:02:59.875 --> 00:03:02.332
and that borrowing from Baroque art

00:03:02.332 --> 00:03:04.216
that we see in Romanticism.

00:03:04.216 --> 00:03:07.051
This is early for Romanticism, but still,

00:03:07.051 --> 00:03:10.039
we've clearly left Neoclassicism behind

00:03:10.039 --> 00:03:12.873
and we see artists beginning to take on

00:03:12.873 --> 00:03:14.551
this contemporary subject matter

00:03:14.551 --> 00:03:17.100
at the request of Napoleon who wants to

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:21.635
document his rule and to use art as

00:03:21.635 --> 00:03:23.888
a kind of way to aggrandize himself.

00:03:23.888 --> 00:03:27.154
Male: He is hero, home and abroad.

00:03:27.154 --> 00:03:31.154
