Hi! My name is David Dirks. I am managing
director of Dirks Outdoors on behalf of Expert

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:09.800
Village. Today we are going to learn how to
tie the classic and highly effective wooly

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:14.670
bugger. Now in terms of material, there is
only a couple of basic materials you need

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:19.970
in order to tie the wooly bugger. We are going
to be using first of all a marabou. Marabou

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:27.271
can be purchased at any fly tying store or
mail order shop. It comes in bags. It is a

00:00:27.271 --> 00:00:33.640
very very fluffy tailing material. It helps
the wooly bugger become very effective in

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:39.890
the water. Part of the charm and fish ability
of the wooly bugger is the fact that it undulates

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:45.420
in the water. It just flows in the water and
opens up. As you can see in the photo here,

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:51.380
it just looks like something any fish would
want to eat. So we have marabou The next piece

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:59.510
for the body, that's for the tail. For the
body, is chenille Chenille builds the body

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:04.040
out for us. This happens to be olive and this
happens to be black. We are going to be using

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:10.720
black today. You can buy chenille in almost
infinite variety of colors so you can have

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:16.940
a lot of experimentation with the wooly bugger.
We are going to be tying a black one but again,

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:22.360
you can tie to suit your needs and the area
that you are fishing. Another area that we

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:28.909
need to build at the body is a hackle and
in this case I have black hackle. It happens

00:01:28.909 --> 00:01:35.480
to be a saddle hackle from here. It comes
from the saddle part of the chicken that it

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:43.530
is harvested from and we will be using a piece
of this for our body. The wooly bugger can

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:49.130
be tied in several different sizes of hooks.
Today we are using a size 8 streamer hook

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:55.880
that you can tie it anywhere from a 6 all
the way up to a size 14 streamer hook. First

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:01.850
part of constructing a wooly bugger is to
simply attach your thread to your hook and

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:05.220
that is what we are going to do here. We are
just going to take a couple of wraps. Now

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:11.410
every fly generally is built from the rear
end out so we are going to start building

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:19.710
this fly actually we are going to put a little
lead on here first. So I am going to take

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:32.590
a piece of lead and I am going to attach it.
Just as you see here I am going to lay a little

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:40.010
bit of that lead right on top of the hook.
I am going to go back and secure that. I like

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:44.989
lots of lead because I like my fly to sink.
Now the first thing to do is just to wrap

00:02:44.989 --> 00:02:57.440
the lead around the fly and do that as tightly
as possible. You can see here if I don't like

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:01.870
that I can go back. The good thing about tying
is you can go back and I am going to wrap

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:15.830
that like so. I am going to keep wrapping
that all the way up. I only used about a 4

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:23.970
inch piece of lead. That is about all you
need. There we have it. Okay. I am going to

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:29.560
trim that lead off and just to make sure that
I have it secured, I am going to wrap over

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:31.430
that thread a few times.
