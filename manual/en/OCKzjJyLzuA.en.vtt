Hi! This is Eric from Spin City Cycling in
Austin, Texas. I am talking to you on behalf

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:11.310
of Expert Village and we are going to discuss
brakes and brake levers. So let's start with

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:15.110
mountain bikes. In terms of mountain bikes
you've generally got 3 different types of

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:20.179
brakes available to you these days. Something
called the V-brake which is a brake that most

00:00:20.179 --> 00:00:25.249
of you are probably familiar with. It is rim-brake
meaning that when you pull the lever, the

00:00:25.249 --> 00:00:30.929
pads are compressed against the rim of the
wheel. That's your braking surface. A little

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:35.600
bit more of a more common these days on mountain
bikes is something called disc brakes and

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:40.260
there are 2 different types of disc brakes.
One is called the mechanical disc brake meaning

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.930
that when you pull the lever there is actually
a steel cable that runs from the brake lever

00:00:44.930 --> 00:00:50.559
down to the brake caliper and when you pull
the brake, it compresses brake pads against

00:00:50.559 --> 00:00:55.700
the rotor that is attached to the front wheel
or to the wheel of the hub. So this is very

00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:02.120
similar to the mechanism that most cars use
for brakes and works really well. The reason

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:06.350
that it is coming more and more popular on
mountain bikes is because it has some distinctive

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:14.659
advantages over V-brakes and that in wet muddy
conditions it is less likely to get contaminated

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:20.760
and decrease your braking performance. Hydraulic
brakes work in a similar fashion even if they

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:24.290
press against a rotor that is attached to
your wheel but instead of having a cable that

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:29.292
runs from leather to the caliper, there is
a hydraulic hose and it actually has hydraulic

00:01:29.292 --> 00:02:02.280
fluid in there. It is a little bit more expensive
but you can get a bit better feel

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:16.359
and a
little bit braking power.
