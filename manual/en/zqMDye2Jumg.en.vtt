Hi! This is Mike on behalf of expertvillage.com.
For more information about bicycle maintenance

00:00:06.430 --> 00:00:15.870
please visit Prairie Path Cycles in Winfield,
Illinois or visit our website at www.prairiepathcycles.com.

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.189
In this clip I’m going to be showing you
how to tighten your brakes. Now the first

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:24.669
sign you’ll notice that you need to tighten
your brakes is it when you pull your brake

00:00:24.669 --> 00:00:29.779
lever it goes almost all the way to your grip
which it shouldn’t do. You should be only

00:00:29.779 --> 00:00:36.210
pulling it about a quarter or half way to
the grip if you are brakes are adjusted correctly.

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.670
Now the first method you are going to want
to use to try to tighten your brakes is up

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:47.510
by your brake lever. There is a barrel adjuster
that when you turn left or counterclockwise

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:54.120
pulls out, which tightens up the cable and
brings your brake arms closer to your wheel,

00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:00.760
which will tighten it up and there is a little
locking nut on the barrel adjuster that snugs

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:05.962
tight to your brake lever and once you get
that done you can check your brakes and you

00:01:05.962 --> 00:01:11.470
can see they are still pulling a little bit
too much so if you do need a bigger adjustment

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:20.930
than what your barrel adjuster can do there
is a nuts on the rear brake arm, which when

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:28.930
you loosen up hold down the cable and push
the brake arms closer to the rim. Once you

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:37.229
get it close enough to the rim but still not
touching tighten that bolt back up and then

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:41.640
check with your brake lever again to see where
it is at and you can see now it doesn’t

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:47.219
pull nearly as much as how it was before but
if you decide that still it is a little bit

00:01:47.219 --> 00:01:53.100
too tight or little bit too loose you can
use your barrel adjuster to fine tune it to

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:59.939
get it exactly how you want to pull and that
is how you tighten your brakes.
