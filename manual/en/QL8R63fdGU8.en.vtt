00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:07.780
Today is Looney Tunes' Worldwide Day of Play!

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:14.220
Turn off your TV, shut down your computer, put down that cellphone - yes, you - and go all out!

00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:17.080
We'll see you back here at 3:00!

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:28.340
Sesame Street is participating in Viacom's Worldwide Day of Play - a celebration of all things active! An entire day devoted to play.

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:35.080
Today we're off the air from 12:00 noon to 3:00 PM. So grab your educations and go play!

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:40.300
Hey! What are you still doing there? Today's a positively perfect day to play!

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:47.240
Uh... tag. I'm it. I gotta get back to playing. And you should, too.

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:22.360
Hey! Don't just sit there. It's Viacom's Worldwide Day of Play - an entire day devoted to getting active.

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:29.880
And to celebrate Worldwide Day of Play, Paramount has gone off the air and is out to play - which is where you should be.

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:35.460
Tell your family, get your friends, grab your frog and do anything that gets you up and active.

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:41.940
Once you play, there will be more Paramount later. But up until then, this message will keep repeating.
