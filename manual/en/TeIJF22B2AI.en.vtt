Hi guys!

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:08.280
This is Cindy Lietz, your Polymer Clay Tutor
and this is the introduction video to my paid

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.290
tutorial series Cymbidium Orchid Pendant.

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:22.430
Now, I’ve got this beautiful Cymbidium Orchid
that we can create using the Wilton Gum Paste

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:24.500
Flower Set.

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.770
And I’m gonna show you some really neat
tricks to using the cutters from the sets

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:35.370
so that we can make the larger pendant or
the smaller pendant with the same size cutters.

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:39.749
I’ll also show you some tips if you don’t
have the cutters and how to do it on your

00:00:39.749 --> 00:00:41.350
own as well.

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:42.829
They're absolutely stunning.

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:46.809
You can use them for pendants like we’re
going to be using in this tutorial but you

00:00:46.809 --> 00:00:49.499
could also use them for other projects as
well.

00:00:49.499 --> 00:00:58.260
I've got a headband down here where I've wired
one of the orchids onto a headband.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:04.000
You could also put it on a clip, a brooch.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:12.530
I've actually done this one on a… added
it to a silver spoon Bail and I’ve done

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:17.940
a tutorial on how to make silver spoon Bails
in the past, and I thought this would be a

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:21.390
neat use for putting the orchids into.

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:27.369
And then I also want to mention that this
is really a useful tutorial for those of you

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:32.180
who already have the Gum Paste Flower cutter
set, because we've done a bunch of tutorials

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:34.940
using those cutters already in the past.

00:01:34.940 --> 00:01:40.719
And I'll just show you the examples here,
I've got the Dogwood flower technique we did.

00:01:40.719 --> 00:01:47.240
We also did a Calla Lily pendant from those
cutters.

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:56.990
We also did some little tiny Forget-me-not
beads and some Daisy beads from that set.

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:01.439
So it’s very versatile and those of you
that already have that are going to very much

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:06.259
love to be able to now make these gorgeous
Cymbidium Orchids.

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:09.519
So we'll see you in the next video of this
series.
