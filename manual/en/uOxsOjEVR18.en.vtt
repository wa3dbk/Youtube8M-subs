00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:15.929
Sprinkles.

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:30.449
Chocolate.

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:32.070
Shiny wrapping paper.

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.070
Naked chicks.

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:38.989
Enough of that stuff on top, and even the
suckiest things seem to suck a whole lot less.

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:40.409
Emphasis on “seem.”

00:00:40.409 --> 00:00:43.670
Truth is...a turd is a turd, but they can
be shined up.

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:46.399
They can be made to look a lot less turd-like.

00:00:46.399 --> 00:00:49.429
And listen, game designers do it all the time.

00:00:49.429 --> 00:00:53.019
Case in point, Marvel Nemesis: Rise of the
Imperfects.

00:00:53.019 --> 00:00:59.390
This is one of the shiniest I’ve ever seen.

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:08.100
So this game was released in 2005 to just
about every platform at the time.

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:12.250
The PS2, GameCube and, as you can see here,
the original Xbox.

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.469
And it’s worth noting that this game had
real talent behind it, including some big-name

00:01:16.469 --> 00:01:19.360
comic book artists doing the script and character
designs.

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:24.659
But it just seems like...all the development
and design talent in the world couldn’t

00:01:24.659 --> 00:01:26.439
make this an interesting experience.

00:01:26.439 --> 00:01:36.610
They did what they could to shine it up, but
the game itself is pretty bad.

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:42.369
The incredibly fittingly named Rise of the
Imperfects is a 3D beat ‘em up of the most

00:01:42.369 --> 00:01:44.450
standard variety imaginable.

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:49.069
Playing as various Marvel characters, you
take on these short missions that generally

00:01:49.069 --> 00:01:51.149
involve beating a certain amount of enemies.

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:56.179
There are certain stipulations, but for the
most part...beat up the bad guys, and you

00:01:56.179 --> 00:01:57.399
win.

00:01:57.399 --> 00:02:01.860
Of course, that kind of simplicity isn’t
necessarily a bad thing.

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:06.869
At least, provided the gameplay has some kind
depth or addictive quality to back it up.

00:02:06.869 --> 00:02:09.619
But that’s the issue with Rise of the Imperfects.

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:10.619
It doesn’t.

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:11.739
You have, like, two different attacks.

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:14.030
You can throw people or button-mash.

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:15.310
That’s about it.

00:02:15.310 --> 00:02:20.480
I mean, you can build up this rage meter...which
ostensibly does something.

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.180
If not tangibly.

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:25.510
The game also has these ridiculous difficulty
spikes.

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:28.910
The missions are exercises in mindless button
mashing.

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:33.051
But then you get to these bosses and...all
of the sudden, it’s the hardest game in

00:02:33.051 --> 00:02:34.140
the world.

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:38.470
Really frustrating, particularly because the
gameplay is so simple, there’s no nuance

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:39.470
to learn.

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:45.180
It’s just...try, try again.

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:51.099
So shallow combat, repetitiveness, weird difficulty
spikes...the game doesn’t feel very tight,

00:02:51.099 --> 00:02:52.099
either.

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:54.459
But to its credit...it was at least polished
up.

00:02:54.459 --> 00:02:57.200
The Xbox version, in particular, looks really
good.

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.870
The character models are great, there are
some nice effects...just a shame the core

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:04.180
game design is the exact opposite of nice.

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:10.180
Now, if you’re a huge Marvel fan, there
might be some redeeming qualities here.

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:14.189
The game does support multiplayer, which is
when it’s at its best, and you can unlock

00:03:14.189 --> 00:03:15.390
some pretty cool comics.

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:20.250
It’s just...getting to all that content
is a chore, because you have to play the single-player

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:21.560
mode to unlock it.

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:26.400
It’s Marvel Nemesis: Rise of the Imperfects.

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.409
Imperfects.
