00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:07.720
Hi, it's Karena and Katrina from Tone It Up.

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:10.850
Did you know that nearly every day of the
year is a National Food Holiday?

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:20.770
And because we like to eat, and we like to
celebrate, we're doing Food Holidays right.

00:00:20.770 --> 00:00:26.890
It has been said that, through the ages, single,
golden envelopes have been known to arrive

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:31.989
in mailboxes across the world, containing
only the picture of a precious candy and an

00:00:31.989 --> 00:00:32.989
address.

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:39.280
It is here that it is said to contain the
most prized of all candies in the universe.

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:47.820
Well, I guess this is the place?

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:53.650
It is.

00:00:53.650 --> 00:01:08.210
It says so, right here.

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:12.549
Is that the one?

00:01:12.549 --> 00:01:13.549
No.

00:01:13.549 --> 00:01:15.249
What about those?

00:01:15.249 --> 00:01:16.249
No.

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:19.650
Looks like you are looking for something in
particular.

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:29.499
Ah, now this is a very special invitation
for a very special kind of candy.

00:01:29.499 --> 00:01:30.770
Where did you get this?

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:32.859
It came in my mailbox.

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:36.189
Ah, then you must be a very special little
boy.

00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:38.420
I couldn't find it in the store.

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.310
Oh, we don't keep these on the shelves.

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:44.729
We keep these in the back.

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:50.090
Come on.

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:52.770
Ladies?

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:55.450
Hi!

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:56.600
You're guest has arrived.

00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.450
Oh, we had no clue he'd be so cute.

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.290
Come on over.

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:03.509
Come on.

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:05.350
How are you?

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:08.420
You actually make the candy?

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:09.420
Yep, all from all natural goodness.

00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:10.420
Can I help?

00:02:10.420 --> 00:02:11.420
We thought you'd never ask.

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:12.540
Can you grab a plate of…

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:13.540
Chocolate?

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:14.540
Not yet.

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:15.540
Just a little coconut.

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:16.730
Here we go.

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.790
We'll grab 1/2 a cup.

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:22.239
You wanna mix it?

00:02:22.239 --> 00:02:25.159
You put that in the bowl.

00:02:25.159 --> 00:02:27.379
Good job.

00:02:27.379 --> 00:02:28.489
Great.

00:02:28.489 --> 00:02:31.310
And then we'll do a 1/4 a cup of coconut oil.

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:34.520
So you have to be really careful.

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:36.350
Okay, there you go.

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:39.370
Now you get to mix it all together.

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:40.540
Mix it around!

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:43.349
Alright, now that that's all stirred together,
we're gonna add the Agave.

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:44.349
Yeah.

00:02:44.349 --> 00:02:45.349
Do you want to pour it?

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:46.349
It's just 2 tablespoons in.

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:48.540
We usually just eye it, so just tip it over.

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:49.540
2 tablespoons.

00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:50.540
Ready?

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:51.540
Keep going.

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:52.540
Little more.

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:53.540
Little more.

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:54.540
You got it.

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:55.540
There you go.

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:56.540
Right there.

00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.060
Alright, stir it around.

00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:59.420
Now stir that.

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:00.420
Good.

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:04.299
That makes it nice and sweet.

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:05.549
And now it's time for…

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:06.610
The chocolate!

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:07.610
Yes!

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:13.819
We've already pre-prepared some of the chocolate
in the bottom of the molds and put it in the

00:03:13.819 --> 00:03:14.819
freezer.

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:19.090
And now we get to add the almonds and the
coconut to this.

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:20.090
Okay.

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:28.319
So we'll just take a little bit of this and
layer it on the chocolate, just like that.

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:32.480
Add a few little almonds.

00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:34.150
And then…

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:35.150
Chocolate.

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:36.269
Is it chocolate now?

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:37.269
You knew it!

00:03:37.269 --> 00:03:41.150
Take a little bit of the chocolate and lay
it on top of the almonds.

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:43.530
You can use…

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:44.629
You can use fingers.

00:03:44.629 --> 00:03:45.629
Yeah.

00:03:45.629 --> 00:03:46.629
There we go.

00:03:46.629 --> 00:03:47.629
Look at that.

00:03:47.629 --> 00:03:50.480
Have you ever made candy bars before, or is
this your first time?

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:52.459
It's my first time.

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:53.459
Yay!

00:03:53.459 --> 00:03:56.989
Alright, now that we're done, we put these
back in the freezer for 10 minutes, so the

00:03:56.989 --> 00:03:58.420
melted chocolate hardens, okay?

00:03:58.420 --> 00:04:02.920
Well, since you've been such a delightful
helper, I think you deserve you're very own.

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:04.650
Here, try one.

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:05.709
Thanks!

00:04:05.709 --> 00:04:06.769
Mom!

00:04:06.769 --> 00:04:10.200
It looks like you found what you were looking
for.

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.190
I did.

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:15.180
How is it?

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:16.180
Alright.

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:23.710
And so it was, young Sam was granted a sampling
of one of the world's greatest culinary treasures,

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:26.620
K&amp;K's chocolate coconut bars.

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:34.290
And he would forever be changed.
