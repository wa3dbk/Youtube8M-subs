00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.100
[Intro] I've not seen such bravery

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:06.980
[Upbeat Music]

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:10.931
It never ceases to amaze me how many times I've heard someone say:

00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:13.320
"I've heard of Myst, but I've never actually played it."

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.620
Then again, I don't understand a lot of things in this crazy world.

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.200
But, while I can't stop people from watching "Little Honey Boo Bitch-in-the-Making",

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:21.240
maybe I can help fix this whole Myst problem.

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:23.980
There aren't many games I would consider to be must-play games.

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:26.660
Just because I like a game, doesn't mean it's a good game for everyone.

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.980
However, if I had an Extremely Recommended games list, Myst would be way up near the top.

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.620
Myst was released in 1993 on CD-Rom.

00:00:33.620 --> 00:00:37.160
Then it was released again and again and again and again and again [echoing over self]

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.980
And, even though you have the option to play it on almost anything you own,

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:42.720
there's really only one version you should even consider playing. [text: Masterpiece Edition]

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:46.500
Myst is a point-and-click adventure game filled with exploration and puzzle solving.

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.500
The setting and sounds can be immensely creepy, and the game has an

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.300
amazing atmosphere from beginning to end.

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:53.560
The basic story is that you've stumbled upon a book called Myst.

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.740
Its origin, author, and date is unknown, but it describes this mystical Island.

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:59.860
[Pause] ... Ohhh-

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.420
When you reach the end of the book, the world around you fades away

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:04.619
And suddenly you're on the island that the book described.

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.960
And that's ALL you get. That's the story.

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.300
Even the user's manual doesn't spoon-feed you anything.

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:13.440
The storyline is actually incredibly deep but you're left to figure it out by yourself.

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.660
The island is more expansive than it seems, and

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.440
everything needs to be inspected and -- more importantly -- recorded.

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:21.020
Myst is a game that almost requires you to take notes.

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:25.320
Everything you encounter should probably be written down, as you try to uncover the island's secrets.

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.940
What's that you say? Too much effort? Well suck it up!

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:33.460
If you've ever fallen into a book before, than you know just as well as I do that there's no cell phone or internet service.

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:35.280
You better just hope you brought a pencil

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:39.080
Besides, there's nothing like the feeling of coming across a puzzle

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.140
just to realise that you already have the solution written down

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:45.840
Myst was one of the most immersive and rewarding gaming experiences that I've ever had,

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.480
and I still pride myself on the fact that I beat it without any guides or walkthroughs.

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:53.060
But for it to be immersive, you have to actually put some dedication into it.

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:57.460
That means, no buying the 3DS version and playing it on the couch while you watch some crap on TV.

00:01:57.520 --> 00:02:01.710
So after all this talking about Myst, I've decided that I'm not even giving you a choice.

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:05.600
Go out and play one of the best games I've ever played, and thank me for it later

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:07.800
Or we're no longer friends.

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:09.800
