00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:31.580
I haven’t experienced
headaches or nausea at all,

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.780
and I don’t think I’ve actually
rated sedation enough

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.730
in these videos because being
sedated was honestly

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:43.930
the biggest fear for me,
I literally was so scared,

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:47.280
but I really couldn’t wait
in office, it was the best

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.620
experience and the anesthetist
was incredible,

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.250
I honestly have no faults at all
if you’re worried, take my word

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.280
for it and don’t be because
it’s, it’s amazing and I would

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.780
choose over being put 
to sleep with no anesthetic

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:07.080
anytime because it was just 
amazing, um, but you know

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.170
what I can’t wait for to my blow
my nose, to clean my nose,

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:14.980
to see my nose and to have
my nose out of this little cage

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.890
because it’s just so sad
not being able

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:19.660
to see it for a whole week,
it’s just like

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.320
it's there but
you can’t see it. 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:24.670
It is Day 6 of my recovery,
and my cast

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:29.000
comes out tomorrow
I’m really excited

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:35.580
um, because I feel like
I’m trapped in a little cage.

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.780
But yeah, again today I
haven’t had any pain.

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:44.040
I’ve um, taken my drip pad off,
I’ve run out of the actual

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:48.760
bandage stuff anyway 
but my nose only bled slightly

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.710
for the first few days but since
then it’s kind of like having

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:57.580
a cold maybe I’m just gross
or they prescribed

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:02.920
like ointments stuff I  have
to use, I don’t know but my nose

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:05.710
is running like crazy
and it’s driving me nuts.

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:10.580
So, I warn you keep tissue
with you at all times.

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:14.380
No, it’s, it’s not really
that bad but yeah,

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.780
keep a box of tissues
near you just in case

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.610
‘cause it is gross when
like your nose is running

00:02:19.630 --> 00:02:22.380
everywhere, it’s just, it’s
just like having a cold.

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:28.090
just to put it that way,
what else has happened?

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.290
Yawning, oh my God,
yawning will literally

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:35.060
be the death of me, 
how was it so uncontrollable?

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:40.440
is so annoying, um, you know,
when you yawn and like

00:02:40.460 --> 00:02:45.000
your nose creases up like it
just does a whole creasing thing

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:49.000
My nose tries to do that
and it is just not okay.

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:54.480
It hurts my tender little bones 
but um, so, yeah,

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:58.880
I just sleep the whole time,
so you don’t yawn is my best

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:02.730
advice for you, no, it’s,
it’s not that bad, honestly,

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:05.580
I’m just being dramatic,
the pain I’ve experienced,

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:08.880
even yawning and sneezing
is barely even painful enough

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:13.680
to call pain, I’ve been lucky 
and obviously had a really

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:17.580
gentle surgeon, because I’ve 
not really had pain at all.

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:22.510
 I just, I just hate the like,
the yawning and sneezing

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:26.500
hasn’t affected my final result,
if you do sneeze,

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:29.280
open your mouth as wide 
as you can, if you’re having

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:32.940
any chin implant like me
and rhinoplasty is difficult

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:38.840
for the first like 2 or 3 days
because um, you’re so stiff

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:43.930
like even now I can’t feel
my chin  like it’s so numb

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:48.530
but yeah, open your mouth 
basically as wide as you can

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:52.780
and it does prevent any
pain from your nose at all.

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:56.860
Um, I’m sure that that’s
written on the print outs

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:02.130
that you get anyway, um,
but do read them and do listen

00:04:02.150 --> 00:04:05.230
to what your surgeon says,
because clearly it makes

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:07.540
a huge a difference to like
bruising and swelling

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:13.180
and pain because I haven’t
experienced barely any pain

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.920
at all actually it’s,
it’s pretty good,

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:19.930
I had a rhinoplasty
and chin implant done

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:25.190
about 7 weeks ago, um, 
the overall experience was

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:29.430
amazing I can’t feel it at all,
I basically had no pain.

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:33.180
I didn’t even use painkillers
which I thought was crazy,

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:36.580
but I love it, I’m obsessed 
with it, I can’t stop looking

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:39.080
at my side profile ‘cause 
that’s  what I wanted to change

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:43.680
the nose and it looks so natural
barely anyone even noticed

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:46.980
that I had it unless I told
them before and those people

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.430
have said how natural
and amazing it looks.

00:04:49.450 --> 00:04:52.690
I just feel a lot better
after having it done

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:55.290
and I’m very happy I came
to Dr. De Silva.
