00:00:00.859 --> 00:00:06.060
The marine organism we're going to identify
now is the red lionfish. The red lionfish

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:11.030
is not indigenous to any waters outside the
Pacific tropical waters, but it is becoming

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:17.240
more commonly seen around the waters of Florida,
the Bahamas and some parts of the Caribbean.

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:22.970
It's an invasive species. They were first
observed in Florida waters in the early to

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:27.660
mid-1990s and they appear to be spreading
southward as they have been reported in the

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:34.820
Turks and Kekos in 2007. Red lionfish are
very distinctive in appearance. They have

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:42.510
striped bodies and the stripes are white and
red, maroon, or brown in color. They're related

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:47.730
to the indigenous scorpion fish found in the
Caribbean, but have no natural predators in

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:53.420
the Atlantic and Caribbean waters. They have
long spines on their dorsal and pectoral fins

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:59.190
which to some look like long feathers. These
spines have a toxin in them so if you see

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:06.110
one don't touch it. Red lionfish are voracious
eaters. They feed on smaller fishes, shrimp

00:01:06.110 --> 00:01:12.580
and crustaceans. They use their long pectoral
fins to herd their prey into a corner. Once

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:17.400
they have their prey cornered they can use
their poisonous spines to stun their prey

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.750
before swallowing them, or simply by quickly
opening their large mouth creating a vacuum

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:30.000
to draw their prey into their mouth. Red lionfish
can get quite large, up to a foot and a half

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.500
long. They are primarily nocturnal feeders
and can usually be seen resting in caves or

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:41.250
under ledges during the day. They can be found
in shallow waters explored by snorklers and

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:48.540
as deep as 170 feet. They generally are territorial
so they can generally be found in the same

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:54.400
area for prolonged periods of time. If you
see one of these fish in the waters around

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:59.880
Florida, the Bahamas or Caribbean, where they
shouldn't be, you should stay away from it

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:07.950
and make sure to report it to the exotic species
project at reef.org. That's the red lionfish.
