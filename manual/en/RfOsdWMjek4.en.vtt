Hello and welcome to this episode of The Trick here on Network A.

00:00:29.499 --> 00:00:32.969
Today we are in the forest of Mount Hood and we are looking for the campsite of Johnny Miller.

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:33.950
Once we find him, we are going to bring him up on the mountain and have him teach us a new trick.

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.460
Alright, we have come upon a campsite.

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:50.680
Johnny Miller, how are you man?

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:52.230
Good, how are you Preston?

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.840
So I was up on the mountain today

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.600
and I saw you doing some mean front blunts to regular.

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.790
Can you teach me how to do this?
Sure if you wanna learn, I would like to teach you.

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:04.530
Johnny, what exactly is a front blunt?

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:09.130
You are not on a skateboard, so can you even do that on a snowboard?

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:11.750
Call it what you want, but it is not exactly a front board.

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:13.390
I call it a front blunt.

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:20.390
It is more on your back foot if not more on your tail.

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:23.340
Johnny, the ride in, break it down.

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:28.490
So you want to go about the speed of a front board.

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:32.460
So you are coming in up the rail almost parallel but a little bit in.

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:33.780
Once you get to the lip you are coming from a flat base.

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:37.770
Then you will switch to your toe edge.

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:39.420
Then when you ollie, you ollie and throw the front part of your board over to the rail.

00:01:41.659 --> 00:01:43.440
Land on your back foot.

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:45.640
If not passed on your tail if you really are good at it.

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:46.740
You want to keep your front foot a little higher than your back foot.

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:53.520
So you kind of land at an angle like that. Once you hit the rail, you level out.

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.030
Basically once you get past the edge of your back foot or past that,

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.940
you have to keep pressing, otherwise you will dip down and fall off the rail.

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:09.889
So once you have got on the rail,

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:13.569
you are going to look over your shoulders and keep your body tweaked the opposite of your feet.

00:02:13.569 --> 00:02:16.879
Just look at the end of the rail as you are sliding. That is kind of the trick to stay on the rail.

00:02:18.279 --> 00:02:20.879
Well you are getting to the end of the rail and you are still looking over your shoulder at the end of the rail.

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:25.549
And this is basically the trick to the trick, going back to regular.

00:02:25.549 --> 00:02:29.279
And uh.. so the trick is to keep your upper body turned the whole time

00:02:29.279 --> 00:02:32.029
so you have more momentum to pop and go back to regular.

00:02:34.649 --> 00:02:37.029
So keep it twisted.

00:02:37.029 --> 00:02:38.169
That is the trick.

00:02:38.169 --> 00:02:40.989
The trick to the front blunt.

00:02:40.989 --> 00:02:42.349
Keep it twisted.

00:02:42.349 --> 00:02:46.989
Thank you Johnny Miller for teaching us front blunts here in your campground.

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:50.939
And thank you for watching this episode of The Trick here on Network A.

00:02:50.939 --> 00:02:55.259
Go to your mountain, learn front blunts, share them with us.

00:02:55.259 --> 00:02:58.559
We will see you next time here on The Trick.
