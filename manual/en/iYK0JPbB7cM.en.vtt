00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:11.490
Gameloft's Modern Combat series has gone from
strength to strength and the fourth title,

00:00:11.490 --> 00:00:14.150
Zero Hour, steps things up once again.

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:19.220
Unfortunately there are also strangely archaic
hold-overs being dragged in its wake, preventing

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:23.040
the big-console inspired game from being an
all-time classic.

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.840
The hold-over I speak of is the AI.

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:29.820
By now fans of the series have come to appreciate,
and maybe even love the way Gameloft have

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.820
pitched their controls, giving players access
to tight, action-packed levels without compromising

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:36.320
on the difficulty.

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:41.190
Though how that difficulty is obtained is
somewhat less impressive - enemies routinely

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.410
expose themselves to cross-fire, taking no
heed of their own safety or of breaching your

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:46.530
defensive positions.

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.780
In short, it's a duck-shooting gallery - all
the more-so if you happen to play with the

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:52.970
generous auto-aim enabled.

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:57.750
With that said, Zero Hour goes further than
previous titles in creating unique and gorgeously

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:02.300
rendered scenarios, placing you in control
of characters from both sides of the table.

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.269
One mission you'll be defending the United
States, and on another you'll be attempting

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:08.070
to capture and hold the President hostage.

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.270
Although the means by which the game changes
the tone of each stage is blunt, it's great

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.460
to bounce between feeling like a patriotic
hero and a grizzled, bloodthirsty maniac out

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:17.740
for revenge.

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:21.680
You really get a great sense of the calm,
yet fast-paced precision of the former, while

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:25.330
the latter swathes through a sea of corpses
without a care in the world.

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:29.770
Occasionally you'll switch perspectives as
you take control of an on-rails shooter section,

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:33.940
often signified by a drone, but players can
also mix-up and augment their experience by

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:37.060
purchasing items that specialize their character.

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:40.640
A Modern Combat game wouldn't be complete
without the obligatory multiplayer mode and

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:45.040
Gameloft once again delivers a rock-solid
online experience (as long as you're not having

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:47.790
troubles connecting or finding other players).

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:51.290
Aside from the commonly seen modes, players
can level the playing field with a 'back to

00:01:51.290 --> 00:01:56.159
basics' mode or turn on the crazy with a capture-and-hold
mode that triggers global boosts.

00:01:56.159 --> 00:02:00.229
For those who enjoy playing a certain way,
specialization options will now reward you

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:01.460
for sticking to these methods.

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.900
It's a great way to encourage diversity, though
this can be somewhat side-stepped if you're

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:09.649
willing to fork out cash to purchase better
weaponry early on.

00:02:09.649 --> 00:02:13.420
It doesn't ruin the game, but the 'pay-to-win'
concept leaves a bitter taste in many player's

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:16.890
mouths (especially as you've already paid
to play).

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:21.569
Modern Combat 4: Zero Hour pushes the series
a step closer towards perfection, though it

00:02:21.569 --> 00:02:26.099
still has some distance to go thanks to poor
AI implementation and combat scenarios that

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:27.900
can border on repetitive.

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:31.540
In the least it's worth picking it up for
the campaign and it's over-the-top storyline,

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:41.200
but you'll stay for the multiplayer once 
you're done.
