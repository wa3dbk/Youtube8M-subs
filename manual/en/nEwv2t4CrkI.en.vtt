00:00:00.329 --> 00:00:05.109
then in Paris I went to a couple of
museums museums museums column what you

00:00:05.109 --> 00:00:07.080
will Lewis it makes no difference to me

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.170
I and pairs as a really great museums
and I went to the luv

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:14.290
and that is where the famous

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:18.340
mona lisa is no can and I was really
looking forward to seeing the Mona Lisa

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:22.330
I don't understand what goes on at the
Mona Lisa if we have

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:26.369
art connoisseurs or artist or anybody
who understands

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:29.990
why when about described you took place
please tell me

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:34.370
you approach the Mona Lisa okay long
hallway

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:37.500
you going by all of these priceless old

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:40.980
pieces apart as it is but people are
just ignoring them they have tunnel

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:41.570
vision

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:45.809
they're just following signs to the Mona
Lisa you get to the Mona Lisa room

00:00:45.809 --> 00:00:50.390
and it's a huge crowd there's a couple
security guards in there near near the

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:50.950
painting

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:56.329
there's kind of a metal barrier that
stops maybe four feet from the Mona Lisa

00:00:56.329 --> 00:01:00.230
the mona lisa is noticeably smaller than
a lot of people assume

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:04.379
it behind several pieces of glass which
I'm told is because

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:08.330
the used to having no photograph policy
and everybody took photographs

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:11.409
so they said okay we can't control
people taking pictures

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:14.799
we're going to just put the Mona Lisa
behind what I can only assume

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:19.270
is a specific type of glass that
prevents your mitigates the damage that

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:23.670
flash photography can do it chaos in the
room while almost knocking my mic over

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:24.890
the story was so incredible

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:28.630
it's completely chaotic in the room
people are screaming people are pushing

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:31.890
people are taking pictures it's a
massive people

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.700
and I just gonna stand there and I start
slowly working my way to the front cuz I

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.259
just one observe the Mona Lisa

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:40.380
and people are going nuts people are
snapping

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:44.070
50 terrible pictures I love the Mona
Lisa

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:48.430
you see that the flash is creating a
huge reflection on the glass you're not

00:01:48.430 --> 00:01:48.939
gonna see

00:01:48.939 --> 00:01:52.340
anything but people need pictures other
painting

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:57.600
I don't get it what do you do with those
pictures you take 50 terrible pictures

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:58.549
other painting

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:01.740
that you can easily find high resolution
images online

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:05.930
do you ever look at those pictures the
pictures I could see I was looking at

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:07.240
people's viewfinders

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:12.250
the head the tops of people's heads are
blocking the Mona Lisa in the pictures

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.060
what do you do with these pictures have
the Mona Lisa once you get home

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.989
what is the point of this I think it's
just the point was to show with other

00:02:20.989 --> 00:02:23.300
people and say look I was here I took
this picture

00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:27.750
and that's the only thing I can think up
people are pushing at one point a woman

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.010
started she literally put it was like in
basketball

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:35.160
when you drop your shoulder as you're
driving to the basket she was dropping

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:38.910
her shoulder and just trying to power
through people with three cameras she

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:40.510
had two cameras hanging from her head

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:44.500
Jeter cell phone camera out and I stood
my ground standing your ground

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.800
is not shooting an unarmed black
teenager in Florida

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:51.260
that's not standing your ground stand
your ground is what I did

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:55.239
standing in front of the moment Mona
Lisa which is simply stand and not allow

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:56.060
this woman

00:02:56.060 --> 00:03:00.140
to knock me down in order to take her
fifty terrible pictures

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:03.390
a painting on three different cameras

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:07.190
I just didn't get it and when you went
to you due to other places

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:11.800
I it was not nearly as crazy they have
the Venus de Milo at the loop as well

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:15.989
a lot of pictures were being taken there
are not as many and that actually makes

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:17.290
more sense to me because

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:20.319
its interesting to see the Venus de Milo

00:03:20.319 --> 00:03:24.580
and I don't know it it doesn't make that
much sense to me but still

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:28.650
I would if I were to take a picture a
art I would first take a picture above

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:29.819
the Venus de Milo

00:03:29.819 --> 00:03:34.280
then to start taking pictures other
painting behind multiple panes of glass

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:38.830
yeah well the there is no better image
other painting then those high

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:42.310
resolution ones you find online because
the painting is a flat

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:45.459
I square rectangle I

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:48.930
and that's just the best image you can
get but the penis of course is a 3d

00:03:48.930 --> 00:03:49.780
sculpture

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:52.959
I mean you can potentially get a very
unique

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:56.720
photograph a bit depending on your
angolan and whatever

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:58.069
so I think that makes way more sense
