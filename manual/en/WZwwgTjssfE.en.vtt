00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:19.700
Hello, and welcome back. I'm Joseph Hoffman.

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:25.449
Today we're learning a new song on the piano,
"Mouse in the House".

00:00:25.449 --> 00:00:31.140
I'm going to sing it for you once, and if
you can practice by tapping the steady beat.

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:35.320
Today, let's tap once, and then clap once.

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:41.590
Mouse, mousie in the housey.

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:44.770
Hurry! Hurry do!

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:47.860
Or the kitty in the housey

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:54.489
Will be chasing you. Run!

00:00:54.489 --> 00:00:58.579
Let's try a little game with this song "Mouse
in the House".

00:00:58.579 --> 00:01:04.330
I'm going to sing a little pattern, and I'd
like you to figure out if the notes

00:01:04.330 --> 00:01:09.690
are high, and we'll use SO for the high notes.

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:12.729
Middle, or low.

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:16.470
Here's the first pattern.

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.470
[Singing]

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.479
What did you hear?

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:27.369
If you said high, middle, low, then you're
right.

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:32.860
The name for that pattern is SO MI DO.

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:36.240
Can you sing that pattern with me?

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.700
SO MI DO.

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:43.799
Good. Here's another part of Mouse Mousie.

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:46.860
It goes like this.

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.530
[Singing]

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.979
What did you hear that time?

00:01:53.979 --> 00:02:00.460
If you said this: SO SO MI DO, then you're
correct.

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:04.450
Can you sing that pattern with me and do the
hand signs?

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:09.169
SO SO MI DO.

00:02:09.169 --> 00:02:13.769
Here's another part of the song.

00:02:13.769 --> 00:02:15.040
[Singing]

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:20.299
What did you hear that time?

00:02:20.299 --> 00:02:25.930
SO DO is the right answer.

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:27.870
Here's another part.

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:29.459
[Singing]

00:02:29.459 --> 00:02:32.519
What did you hear that time?

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:36.840
It was three DO's. DO DO DO.

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:43.650
Good, now let's try the whole song using hand
signs while we sing.

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:47.239
Ready, here we go.

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:52.650
Mouse mousie, in the housey

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:59.249
Hurry, hurry do!

00:02:59.249 --> 00:03:04.930
Or the kitty in the housey

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:08.299
will be chasing you. Run!

00:03:08.299 --> 00:03:15.249
Great, you are ready to learn how to move
your fingers

00:03:15.249 --> 00:03:17.680
to be able to play this song.

00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:24.680
So if you could please hold your right hand
up in the air about this far away

00:03:28.169 --> 00:03:32.249
and I'm going to sing a pattern, and then
I'd like you to try it after me.

00:03:32.249 --> 00:03:35.790
I'll go first.

00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:38.949
SO MI DO.

00:03:38.949 --> 00:03:44.669
Now your turn.

00:03:44.669 --> 00:03:46.419
My turn again.

00:03:46.419 --> 00:03:50.169
SO SO MI DO.

00:03:50.169 --> 00:03:54.040
Your turn.

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:59.719
Notice that SO MI and DO forms a skipping
down pattern.

00:03:59.719 --> 00:04:03.969
SO skips down to MI skips down to DO.

00:04:03.969 --> 00:04:05.169
Here's the next pattern.

00:04:05.169 --> 00:04:11.889
SO DO. Your turn.

00:04:11.889 --> 00:04:18.359
My turn again. DO DO DO. Your turn.

00:04:18.359 --> 00:04:23.330
Good, let's try the whole song with words
now.

00:04:23.330 --> 00:04:24.680
It starts on SO.

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:28.900
Ready, you can try it with me and move your
fingers.

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:33.539
Mouse mousie in the housey,

00:04:33.539 --> 00:04:38.639
Hurry, hurry do

00:04:38.639 --> 00:04:44.139
Or the kitty in the housey

00:04:44.139 --> 00:04:49.849
will be chasing you.

00:04:49.849 --> 00:04:52.460
Now let me show you what we do for the word
run.

00:04:52.460 --> 00:04:56.159
We're going to have the mouse run up the piano.

00:04:56.159 --> 00:04:58.460
I turn my hand upside down like this,

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:01.180
and I only let my fingernails touch the keys.

00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:05.069
And I do what's called a "glissando".

00:05:05.069 --> 00:05:10.300
I just go up the keys. If I only let my fingernails
touch then it doesn't hurt.

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:14.430
And I go kind of gently all the way up the
piano.

00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:20.009
And that's how the mouse runs up away from
that cat.

00:05:20.009 --> 00:05:22.789
Now we're ready to try it on the piano.

00:05:22.789 --> 00:05:26.360
Let's do this song using the D pentascale

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:30.740
which means we'll put right hand finger one
on D.

00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:35.960
Finger two on E, finger three on F sharp,
remember that black key

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:37.949
and then G and A.

00:05:37.949 --> 00:05:40.240
But since this song only uses SO MI and DO

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:46.789
we really need D, F sharp and A for this song.

00:05:46.789 --> 00:05:50.569
Now placing your hand in the D pentascale,

00:05:50.569 --> 00:05:53.580
let's practice the patterns to Mouse mousie.

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:56.139
I'll play first, and then you echo.

00:05:56.139 --> 00:05:58.560
Here's the first pattern, my turn first.

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:04.939
SO MI DO. Your turn.

00:06:04.939 --> 00:06:11.939
Here's the next pattern. SO SO MI DO. Your
turn.

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:21.120
Here's the next one. SO DO. Your turn.

00:06:23.189 --> 00:06:30.189
Here's the next pattern. DO DO DO. Your turn.

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:35.900
Good. Now let's try it with the words.

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:38.659
I'll play the whole song for you once, and
if you feel brave

00:06:38.659 --> 00:06:41.020
you can try playing along with me.

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:45.580
If it doesn't go well, just don't worry keep
rewinding it trying it again

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:47.770
or push pause and try it on your own.

00:06:47.770 --> 00:06:49.759
Here's the whole song now.

00:06:49.759 --> 00:06:54.069
Mouse mousie in the housey,

00:06:54.069 --> 00:06:56.870
hurry, hurry do.

00:06:56.870 --> 00:07:03.870
Or the kitty in the housey

00:07:06.259 --> 00:07:13.259
will be chasing you. Run!

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:18.830
And then with my left hand I like to go SO
DO.

00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:25.539
I play a low SO DO on the piano using the
D pentascale.

00:07:25.539 --> 00:07:28.550
With my left hand I go SO DO.

00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:31.860
And that makes a nice ending to the song.

00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:35.229
You say run, and then

00:07:35.229 --> 00:07:41.029
and then you're done.

00:07:41.029 --> 00:07:43.490
That's how you play "Mouse in the House".

00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:48.219
I hope you'll practice that every day using
your right hand.

00:07:48.219 --> 00:07:50.069
Also try your left hand.

00:07:50.069 --> 00:07:53.669
If you'd like some activity sheets to help
you with this song

00:07:53.669 --> 00:07:55.439

00:07:55.439 --> 00:08:00.879

materials to help you.
