00:00:09.909 --> 00:00:13.679
Hello everyone. So today we're taking a quick look at the Samsung Galaxy S4's

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:14.929
lock screen controls.

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:16.670
So if you want to

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:18.890
customize your Galaxy S4

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:21.070
and you're quite interested in

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:24.140
kind of changing up how your lock screen functions

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:26.960
there's some very very interesting features here.

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:32.050
So what you need to do, come into settings first of all, go to my device and then come into the lock screen

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:33.240
and then from the lock screen

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:36.989
you've got a few different options, including multiple widgets. Now this is a feature of

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:38.440
Android 4.2

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:42.870
and it allows you to place widgets on your lock screen. Brilliant!

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.920
Now, some of these widgets are already
available from kind of Samsung and they include

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.460
things like your favourite apps or camera

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:50.460
or a personal message or a clock

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:53.060
and you can change exactly what you want
to have

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:57.260
featured there. Just have a clock or you can have it with a personal message like companion

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:58.380
message.

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:00.520
And if you want to you can edit that message

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.910
set it to absolutely anything you like and really cool

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:06.420
it's got customization options which
still keep the kind of awesome look and

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:07.510
feel.

00:01:07.510 --> 00:01:14.510
So if we go here.

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.090
Androidizen. And then if I want to I can change the text.

00:01:22.090 --> 00:01:25.590
There's a few basically built in to begin with to give you a nice

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:26.860
common look and feel.

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:29.290
I've not found a way to actually change those fonts yet.

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:30.970
But you can then also add

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:33.740
various types of color overlays etcetera.

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:35.020
or have it

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:36.310
transparent

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:38.540
what type of font style you want etcetera.

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:42.780
Really really nice so that's  a quick customization for the front screen

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:47.970
but then you've got your shortcuts as well. Now going into shortcuts will allow you to put

00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:50.260
icons on the lock screen.

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:54.070
So these icons you can customize. Now you want to be careful because security is a bit of an

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:58.159
issue when you're using these lock screen icons because effectively a person just has to

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:00.340
touch over the icon and it will

00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:02.020
automatically power-up

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:03.900
that particular application.

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:08.399
Obviously if it's your phone or your camera that could cause you a few problems from a security point of view

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:12.769
so just be careful which shortcuts you decide to enable.

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:16.389
You can show help text on the lock screen as well and you can also generate

00:02:16.389 --> 00:02:21.049
wake-up commands as well. If you happen to be using the S Voice function you can basically say

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:23.630
wake up Galaxy S or Hi Galaxy or anything like that and the

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:25.849
lock screen will automatically wake-up.

00:02:25.849 --> 00:02:27.939
It's quite a nice idea.

00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:31.599
You've got unlock effects as well which are kind
of greyed out because I've got one of the

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:32.959
other features turned on,

00:02:32.959 --> 00:02:34.870
I think it's the multiple widgets

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:38.670
but effectively that just changes whether you get the ink effect or the nice light effect.

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:39.869
Groovy!

00:02:39.869 --> 00:02:43.129
But let's go back now and let's have a look at
the lock screen

00:02:43.129 --> 00:02:46.920
now we've made this change.

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.539
Just get rid of that. Now if you swipe in from the side,

00:02:49.539 --> 00:02:55.569
doesn't always work quite as reliably as I would like this, Samsung could do with making a little change

00:02:55.569 --> 00:02:57.769
but it should allow you, there we go,

00:02:57.769 --> 00:03:02.589
to get into these widget areas and from here you can then pick any of  these standard widgets

00:03:02.589 --> 00:03:04.669
that are already installed or

00:03:04.669 --> 00:03:06.280
whatever you might choose.

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:10.369
So for instance I can have a Google Now widget appearing on my lock screen.

00:03:10.369 --> 00:03:12.939
If I want to

00:03:12.939 --> 00:03:17.459
I can also put the Samsung Watch On application

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:21.399
so then I've got full control of my television and I never have to actually

00:03:21.399 --> 00:03:26.529
log into the phone itself to get hold of it. I just swipe across and then I've got my various

00:03:26.529 --> 00:03:30.609
infra red controls available there. If you swipe across to the other side,

00:03:30.609 --> 00:03:34.729
moving to the right as it were, sorry left! Hang on!

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:35.919
Which way are we flicking?

00:03:35.919 --> 00:03:37.279
We're flicking left!

00:03:37.279 --> 00:03:40.810
You have a series of quick launch applications and again

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:43.169
mind your security on this particular feature.

00:03:43.169 --> 00:03:48.040
Do customize and to remove anything that you don't want to be present at the time.

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:52.370
For instance things that people can make phone
calls or access your code or camera

00:03:52.370 --> 00:03:55.689
without actually having to log into the device.

00:03:55.689 --> 00:03:59.529
But these are really nice quick features and it's quite nice to see that Samsung have integrated

00:03:59.529 --> 00:04:02.699
this with 4.2 quite cleanly do you know what I mean?

00:04:02.699 --> 00:04:08.370
It's not a janky imitation at all, it works really nicely. As you can see there, nice and fluid.

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:12.709
But that's a very quick look at what you can do with the Samsung Galaxy S4 lock screen.

00:04:12.709 --> 00:04:16.949
There's a lot of customization options here, you can really make these lock screens your own now

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:20.639
and with some really really cool widget features as well. I think Google Now on your lock screen

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:21.849
is just a great idea.

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:23.749
But there you go. Galaxy S4 lock screen.
