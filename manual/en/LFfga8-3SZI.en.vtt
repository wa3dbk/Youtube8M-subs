00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:10.340
The blue shell ...

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.970
... one of nature's most graceful ruthless
karmically loaded creatures.

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:26.780
It is known by many names.

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:28.280
Blue justice.

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:31.060
The great equalizer.

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:32.560
Spiny's revenge.

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:35.600
Death and taxes jerk friend.

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:38.500
The liam neeson.

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:41.660
The five stages of grief
in three seconds.

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:43.360
All right I'm done.

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:49.719
We have all found
ourselves on the spiky explosive end of

00:00:49.719 --> 00:00:53.170
one of these in our Mario Kart history.
We've all shouted curses at hearing that

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:54.159
familiar hiss.

00:00:54.159 --> 00:00:58.300
But the fact remains that the spiny blue
shell makes Mario Kart a better game.

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.780
So why is it in there? What does it do?
Well to start off, let's just be clear

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:04.190
about how exactly the blue shell works.

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:10.400
The blue shell is a homing missile. When
fired, it speeds down the track smashing

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:12.580
through any racer in its way to the
front.

00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:15.610
Where it homes in on the player
currently winning the race, and ruins

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:19.330
their day, causing a huge explosion that
may also hit the racers and second and

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:21.030
third if they aren't careful.

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:24.270
Interestingly, the blue shell is only
ever granted the players who are far

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:24.960
behind,

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.190
often those currently in last place. The
specifics of its rules have varied a bit

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:32.909
from game to game since its debut in
Mario Kart 64, but it's a pretty safe bet

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:35.790
that if you're in first or second or
third place, you will not be getting any

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.490
blue shells. At least not in the way that
you'd like.

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:42.540
So one reason for the blue shell to
exist is obviously to serve as a

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:46.380
catch-up mechanism. If you're a racer
trailing far behind the rest of the pack,

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.080
you need more powerful items if you're
going to catch up, and you especially

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:51.960
need to keep the person and first from
increasing their lead if you're even

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.009
gonna have a chance to win the race. At
the end of the day, getting completely

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:57.750
stomped, just isn't fun.

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:01.200
The blue shell helps to ensure that no
one gets left completely in the dust

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:04.350
without a chance to come back. But here's
the really crazy thing.

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.519
It's actually not fun to be uncontested
way out in front in Mario Kart either.

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:11.970
If you're just dominating, if you're far
ahead of the pack there's really nothing

00:02:11.970 --> 00:02:14.700
for you to do. You don't get to use your
items,

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.760
you can't interact with any of the other
players. It just turns into a mediocre

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.959
racing game at that point, instead of the
wild goofy kart racer we all love.

00:02:21.959 --> 00:02:26.400
Unfortunately the whole design of the
game tells you that the goal is to get

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:27.420
way out in front.

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.200
It's the objective you're given as a
player: Come in first. Get to the front

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.280
Stay in the front. Leave everybody in the
dust. The objective you're given as a

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.340
player drives you toward a play state
that's way less interesting than most of

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:41.640
the rest of the game, which makes the
game less fun for everybody involved.

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:44.880
So the designers had to include
something to prevent this from happening.

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.230
Hence, the blue shell: a weapon which when
fired, will not stop until it has

00:02:49.230 --> 00:02:50.780
exploded on the racer in first place.

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:55.480
But adding the blue shell as just
another weapon in the game introduces a

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:58.900
new problem, because the designers are
trying to build close races where the

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:02.140
players are constantly interacting with
each other, and yet if the player in

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:05.530
second place gets their hands on a blue
shell, they can very easily use it to

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.580
claim a huge lead for themselves, which
just leaves us with the same design

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:12.780
problem we had before.

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.290
This is why the item only shows up for
the players who are pretty far behind in

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:17.100
the pack.

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:20.550
It's not just a way to help the players
in the back to catch up, but also a way

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:22.319
to have the arrival of a blue shell,

00:03:22.319 --> 00:03:25.709
be just as much of a surprise to the
player in second, as to the player in

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:29.640
first. Because the player in second
doesn't control the timing of the blue

00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:30.120
shell, ...

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:34.319
they can't take perfect advantage of it
when it shows up. It often give them a

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:37.650
chance to pull ahead of the front-runner,
but it rarely gives them time to zoom

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:39.660
ahead and disappear into the sunset.

00:03:39.660 --> 00:03:43.950
Additionally, the blast radius on the
blue shell is designed so that if the

00:03:43.950 --> 00:03:46.080
first and second place racers are neck
and neck,

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.900
it's very likely that the second place
player will either get caught in the

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.510
explosion themselves, or have to swerve
around it,

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:54.520
sacrificing speed for a few precious
seconds, and giving the rest of the

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:55.940
racers a chance to close the gap.

00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:00.560
So now the designers have addressed one
of the biggest problems with standard

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:04.560
play: the fact that a close game is far
more enjoyable for everybody involved, then

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.989
a game where people are way ahead or way
behind.

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:10.830
Unfortunately in doing so they've now
optimized the game for what I guess

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:14.430
we'll call "casual players", people just
looking to have an awesome night of

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:18.090
Mario Kart with their friends. But in
doing so, they sacrifice some of the

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:21.600
game's play ability for what we'll call
"tournament players", people who are

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:24.960
totally committed to mastery of the game, and want their superior play to be

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:28.080
acknowledged. A group which probably
makes up five to ten percent of the

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:31.350
playerbase. To this sort of player, the
blue shell is especially frustrating,

00:04:31.350 --> 00:04:34.350
since as we've mentioned, it's
effectively random.

00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:37.440
None of the players out in front know
when it's coming, and it has a huge

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:40.979
impact on the game. By design, the blue
shell ensures that the most skilled

00:04:40.979 --> 00:04:42.660
player doesn't always win.

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:45.660
Which is actually not as big a problem
as most people think, even at the

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:48.930
tournament level, but only if the skilled
player has some way to counter the

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:49.770
randomness.

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:53.340
I mean, a bad draw can happen in poker,
and it may give you a handicap, but it

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:57.960
doesn't guarantee a loss. But a late-game
blue shell and mario kart absolutely can,

00:04:57.960 --> 00:04:59.760
if you're not given the means to counter
it.

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:03.810
So what did the designers do to resolve
that problem? Well they gave the absolute

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:06.810
highest level players ways to play
around the blue shell.

00:05:07.449 --> 00:05:12.279
They made it avoidable, under certain
circumstances, and gave a counter play.

00:05:12.279 --> 00:05:15.309
But they made that counter played very
difficult to execute in order to not

00:05:15.309 --> 00:05:19.240
undo all the work they've just done to
improve casual play. The ways to avoid a

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:22.900
blue shell vary from game to game, but
they almost always require incredibly

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:26.349
precise timing, or preserving an item
that you can only get when your way back

00:05:26.349 --> 00:05:27.669
behind sixth place.

00:05:27.669 --> 00:05:31.719
Amusingly, if you don't have the items
you need to deal with a blue shell, and

00:05:31.719 --> 00:05:33.370
you spot one sailing towards you,

00:05:33.370 --> 00:05:36.400
one of the smartest high level players
you can make is to slam on your brakes

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:39.610
at the right moment, to make sure the
player behind you get hit too.

00:05:39.610 --> 00:05:43.060
Or if you do it just right, maybe you can
get the other guy to pass you in just

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:45.819
the right moment for the blue shell to
lock on to him instead.

00:05:45.819 --> 00:05:49.300
Sure it's still a sub optimal situation
for the leading player, but at least it

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:52.719
gives them some agency over the
situation. They feel that by being a good

00:05:52.719 --> 00:05:55.749
player and by playing smart, they can
mitigate some of the damage the blue

00:05:55.749 --> 00:05:59.259
shell does, which is really all you have
to do to make randomness more acceptable

00:05:59.259 --> 00:06:02.139
in high level play. Before we wrap this
up,

00:06:02.139 --> 00:06:04.930
let's look at the changes made by the
designers in the most recent iteration:

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:06.909
Mario Kart 8

00:06:06.909 --> 00:06:10.149
What does it tell us about the vision
and intent behind the series, that in the

00:06:10.149 --> 00:06:14.080
most recent game, designer specifically
put in an item that destroys the blue

00:06:14.080 --> 00:06:19.270
shell? Truth is, it means the audience is
getting more hardcore. The Super Horn

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:22.180
appears rarely enough so as to not
negate the fact that the blue shell

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:25.569
creates tighter races, but it does allow
tournament players a much better chance

00:06:25.569 --> 00:06:28.240
to effectively play around this element
of the game.

00:06:28.240 --> 00:06:31.509
This sets up Mario Kart 8 to be a much
more tournament friendly game,

00:06:31.509 --> 00:06:34.509
implying that the design staff and
Nintendo are starting to consider that

00:06:34.509 --> 00:06:37.569
group of it more heavily, as they plan
out Mario Kart games.

00:06:37.569 --> 00:06:41.709
So that's it for this week, whether you
hate it or you really, really hate it,

00:06:41.709 --> 00:06:45.099
the blue shell is there because being
way ahead is almost as un-fun as being

00:06:45.099 --> 00:06:49.300
way behind, and that big blue explosion
makes for tighter, more enjoyable races

00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:50.169
for all of us,

00:06:50.169 --> 00:06:53.120
even if it doesn't always feel like it.

00:06:54.080 --> 00:06:56.200
*sighs*
That's frustrating.

00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:19.200
