00:00:44.273 --> 00:00:47.500
Karol Szymanowski Violin Concerto No. 2, Op. 61; Agata Szymczewska – violin; Symphony Orchestra of the National Philharmonic, Pablo Gozalez – conductor

00:01:48.743 --> 00:01:51.700
The main difference between my 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.700
performance on this very stage five years ago 

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.700
and today is experience. 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:59.460
In the five years, 

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.460
I have played quite a few concerts, 

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.460
incl. several performances 

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:05.460
of Szymanowski’s Concerto No. 2;

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.460
I have also played his Concerto No. 1.

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:09.460
So, today I take to the stage 

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:11.460
in a completely different mood; 

00:02:12.764 --> 00:02:14.764
I have greater experience 

00:02:14.764 --> 00:02:16.764
in working with an orchestra.

00:02:18.764 --> 00:02:20.044
I guess – or I should say, 

00:02:20.044 --> 00:02:22.044
I hope – I understand music better, 

00:02:22.044 --> 00:02:24.044
in particular this of Karol Szymanowski’s. 

00:02:24.044 --> 00:02:25.033
So, I think in this respect,

00:02:25.033 --> 00:02:25.739
this time 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:27.739
it was a great deal... 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:29.200
I don’t want to use the words

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:31.200
‘more pleasant’; 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.200
without a doubt, I felt much more at ease.

00:03:20.057 --> 00:03:22.057
When I go on stage, 

00:03:22.057 --> 00:03:24.057
I ask myself two questions:

00:03:24.057 --> 00:03:26.057
‘why am I going to the concert’ 

00:03:26.057 --> 00:03:29.000
and ‘am I sure I want to go out and play’. 

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.000
If I find sufficiently many reasons 

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000
to answer ‘yes’ to the first question,

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:39.000
as well as ‘yes’ is the unequivocal answer to the other, 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.080
then, with firm conviction,

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:42.080
I go out and play. Besides, 

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:44.080
it is never too late to say ‘no’. 

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:46.080
I have this feeling 

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.080
that nobody really pushes me to perform;

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:50.080
and until I take to the stage, 

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:52.080
until the door opens,

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.080
I can always say ‘no’. 

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:56.080
Whenever I pack my dress, 

00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:58.080
my instrument, 

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:00.080
the music, 

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:02.000
when I go to the concert hall, 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000
when I sit in the dressing room, I have this feeling 

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.000
that if one day I say ‘no, 

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.500
I am not going to perform today,’

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:08.500
nothing is going to happen, really. 

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:09.500
If I feel like playing,

00:04:09.500 --> 00:04:10.500
I put up a smile on my face,

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.368
go out and play. 

00:04:40.449 --> 00:04:42.449
It would be great 

00:04:42.449 --> 00:04:44.449
if all of us 

00:04:44.449 --> 00:04:46.449
could be spared 

00:04:46.449 --> 00:04:48.449
disappointment 

00:04:48.449 --> 00:04:48.949
and a feeling of being

00:04:48.949 --> 00:04:50.949
professionally burnt out. 

00:04:50.949 --> 00:04:52.949
It is pretty dreadful 

00:04:52.949 --> 00:04:53.449
when music 

00:04:53.449 --> 00:04:55.449
does not give you joy,

00:04:55.449 --> 00:04:57.449
when in the morning, as you open the case,

00:04:57.449 --> 00:04:59.449
or put the score on the music stand, 

00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:01.449
you feel like crying, or tossing the stand, 

00:05:01.449 --> 00:05:03.449
or doing something even nastier to the instrument. 

00:05:03.449 --> 00:05:05.449
Unfortunately, it does happen sometimes, 

00:05:05.449 --> 00:05:07.449
so it is of paramount importance 

00:05:07.449 --> 00:05:09.449
to be able to manage 

00:05:09.449 --> 00:05:11.449
your career 

00:05:11.449 --> 00:05:13.449
the best way you can.

00:05:15.449 --> 00:05:16.948
It is important 

00:05:16.948 --> 00:05:18.948
not to overlook the moment when,

00:05:18.948 --> 00:05:20.948
at times,

00:05:20.948 --> 00:05:22.948
it is worthwhile to say ‘no’,

00:05:22.948 --> 00:05:24.948
‘stop’, ‘enough.’ 

00:05:24.948 --> 00:05:26.948
I should like to warn everyone

00:05:26.948 --> 00:05:28.948
against doing things at all cost,

00:05:28.948 --> 00:05:30.948
against being determined to catch every chance 

00:05:30.948 --> 00:05:32.948
in sight no matter what; 

00:05:35.052 --> 00:05:37.052
one should know his or her value 

00:05:37.052 --> 00:05:39.052
and be able to simply say ‘no’ 

00:05:39.052 --> 00:05:41.052
even to the best, 

00:05:41.052 --> 00:05:43.052
most splendid opportunities.
