00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:15.680
We do not pretend
being a global organisation.

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:21.000
We do not have our branches
somewhere in Singapore or Rio de Janeiro

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:21.520
...yet.

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:26.120
So our ambition is just
to identify ourselves

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:32.040
and to take this European parts
of identity as our strengths.

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:34.960
This university is the
second largest in Lithuania

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:36.880
- or probably the first...

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:40.880
... the largest university
after this September.

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:45.080
But this is a large university
in Lithuanian terms - 22.000 students.

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:50.840
Some 10 or 15 years ago, we had only
100.000 students in Lithuania.

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.720
Now we have more than
200.000 students.

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.680
So, it's basically a double expansion.

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.680
Now, Lithuania is a
service-oriÃ¢nted society,

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:05.880
and a society trying to use
advantages of its geographic location

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.360
- of international trade,
of new technologies.

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:13.080
That's why we are trying to be
a very contemporary university.

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:20.360
To adapt to the new challenges
of the time, and new tendencies.

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:24.840
Our society, as every society
in Europe and around the world,

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.080
becomes internationally step by step.

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.320
And what students need and ask is,
they want international education.

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:35.560
If you take your identity
just as a Lithuanian university,

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.120
you won't always be recognised.

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.280
You present yourselves
as a European university, that's easier.

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.160
And it is important for us.

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.480
It says this is a university which
opens the gate to the EU level,

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:51.760
and which has this ambition
of being of EU standard.

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:58.400
And we take this. With dot-EU,
we take all this spectrum of European priviliges.
