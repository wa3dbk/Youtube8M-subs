00:00:11.512 --> 00:00:15.548
I am working with strands of yarn.

00:00:15.548 --> 00:00:19.248
There are approximately 40 inches.

00:00:19.248 --> 00:00:21.989
102 centimeters.

00:00:21.989 --> 00:00:25.960
You can make them as long as you want to.

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.096
I am working with six strands altogether.

00:00:29.096 --> 00:00:31.464
I want to fold them in half.

00:00:31.464 --> 00:00:36.338
And the ends will meet at the beginning.

00:00:36.338 --> 00:00:44.512
I am going to find the center down here on the ear section and put my crochet hook through like this.

00:00:44.512 --> 00:00:51.317
And they all may not go through at once.  So you may have to do them individually.

00:00:51.317 --> 00:01:02.758
Pull the halfway point through and then just pull through one side like this.

00:01:02.758 --> 00:01:16.075
You will want to even them up and make sure the ends are matching.  The ends do not have to be perfect.

00:01:16.075 --> 00:01:20.180
You can cut them off even at a later time.

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:28.621
You will divide the strands of yarn into sections of four.

00:01:28.621 --> 00:01:32.959
There is the first section, there's the second section, and this is the third.

00:01:32.959 --> 00:02:13.467
And then we will start braiding them.

00:02:13.467 --> 00:02:16.070
Now I am down here at the end.

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:24.358
What I am going to do is to make a knot and I'm just folding the ends over.

00:02:24.358 --> 00:02:31.117
And putting them through like this.

00:02:31.117 --> 00:02:38.104
And then making a knot like that.

00:02:38.104 --> 00:02:45.298
Then pulling it snug.

00:02:45.298 --> 00:02:48.335
Then you can cut all of the ends off even.

00:02:48.335 --> 00:02:53.012
Some of mine aren't even but that's all right.

00:02:53.012 --> 09:59:59.000
Just like that.
