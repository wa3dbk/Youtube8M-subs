00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:09.660
In this episode of Tank Wars we are still
in the Nano division but we are no longer

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:10.660
in Atlanta.

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:17.199
Cam moved on to the next round from Atlanta
and now its time to see who he will be facing

00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:36.780
from Miami.

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:39.870
Will it be Jaiden's 30G or Tommy's 30 Gallon.

00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:42.989
Both of these tanks have unique stories.

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:50.570
For one Tommy's 30G started out as just a
holding tank for his future 200 gallon who

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:53.679
knew he would turn it into a work of art.

00:00:53.679 --> 00:00:55.960
You'll see what I mean.

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:57.320
As for Jaiden.

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.059
Well, Jaiden is 6 years old.

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:05.089
What's cool is Jaiden's father swore to me
that Jaiden did a lot of maintenance on the

00:01:05.089 --> 00:01:06.089
tank himself.

00:01:06.089 --> 00:01:07.089
In last weeks episode we seen All in one systems
from Atlanta.

00:01:07.089 --> 00:01:08.089
Both Nano tanks from Miami are custom.

00:01:08.089 --> 00:01:15.960
Lets see how they compare but first lets take
a quick look at our sponsor Ruby Reef.

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:23.410
Ok, lets just straight into the equipment
tour.

00:01:23.410 --> 00:01:27.150
Jaiden gets his flow from an Vortech Mp10.

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:40.690
His tank is illuminated by a Ecotech Radion
Gen 2.

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:49.520
The tank itself is a rimless aquarium made
by deep blue.

00:01:49.520 --> 00:02:00.450
The sump is a custom 20G made by Jaiden's
dad Jbliss2000007.

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:02.880
The protein skimmer is a Reef Octopus BH50.

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.540
This will be Jaiden's frag section.

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:09.099
Lastly this contain is used for dosing kalk.

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:11.930
Tommy is running a Metal Halide with custom
LEDS.

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:18.310
This bulk reef supply contain (not a sponsor-show
myself) is use for dosing kalk.

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:23.830
Then he also has two bulk reef supply dosers
for Alk and calicium.

00:02:23.830 --> 00:02:27.980
His protein skimmer is the reef octopus 110.

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:29.850
Here is the GFO reactor.

00:02:29.850 --> 00:03:12.020
OK you guys know the drill.

00:03:12.020 --> 00:05:06.280
Now its time to check out both tanks starting
with Jaiden.

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:07.870
Well there you have it.

00:05:07.870 --> 00:05:08.870
Now its up to you to vote.

00:05:08.870 --> 00:05:09.870
Will you pick Jaiden's 30Gallon or Tommy's
30Gallon.

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:10.870
Go to Tankwars.net.

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:11.870
Click on Season 1 then episode 2.

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:12.870
Last episode we received over 250 votes but
a few ppl had trouble voting.

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:16.820
Well if that happens try a different browser
or clear your cookies.

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:20.530
Either way we appreciate you taking the time
to vote.

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:21.610
And remember you will have until Saturday
night to vote.

00:05:21.610 --> 00:05:22.610
I will then announce the winner on Sundayish.

00:05:22.610 --> 00:05:23.692
As I mentioned before the videos announcing
the winners will be quick and you can expect

00:05:23.692 --> 00:05:25.700
