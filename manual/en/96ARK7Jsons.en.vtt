00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.185
By yon bonnie banks and by yon bonnie braes,

00:00:06.781 --> 00:00:12.989
Where the sun shines bright on Loch Lomond,

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:18.711
Where me and my true love were ever wont to gae

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:25.761
On the bonnie bonnie banks o' Loch Lomond

00:00:38.154 --> 00:00:45.040
O' you'll take the high road and I'll take the low road,

00:00:46.083 --> 00:00:51.887
And I'll be in Scotland afore ye;

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:58.432
But me and my true love will never meet again,

00:00:58.574 --> 00:01:05.007
On the bonnie bonnie banks o' Loch Lomond

00:01:05.454 --> 00:01:11.666
'Twas there that we parted in yon shady glen,

00:01:11.963 --> 00:01:18.304
On the steep steep sides o' Ben Lomond,

00:01:18.446 --> 00:01:24.545
Where deep in purple hue, the Hieland hills we view,

00:01:25.222 --> 00:01:32.798
And the moon comin' out in the gloamin'

00:01:33.592 --> 00:01:39.203
O' you'll take the high road and I'll take the low road,

00:01:39.134 --> 00:01:44.711
And I'll be in Scotland afore ye;

00:01:44.905 --> 00:01:49.824
But me and my true love will never meet again,

00:01:49.515 --> 00:01:55.663
On the bonnie bonnie banks o' Loch Lomond

00:01:55.850 --> 00:02:01.722
The wee birdies sing, and the wild flowers spring,

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:08.610
And in sunshine the waters are sleeping,

00:02:09.486 --> 00:02:16.358
But the broken heart will ken nae second spring again,'

00:02:17.272 --> 00:02:28.073
Tho' the world knows not how we are grieving

00:02:58.316 --> 00:03:01.955
O' you'll take the high road and I'll take the low road,

00:03:02.146 --> 00:03:06.099
And I'll be in Scotland afore ye;

00:03:06.274 --> 00:03:10.258
But me and my true love will never meet again,

00:03:10.287 --> 00:03:14.626
On the bonnie bonnie banks o' Loch Lomond

00:03:41.335 --> 00:03:49.519
But me and my true love will never meet again,

00:03:51.739 --> 00:04:08.492
On the bonnie bonnie banks o' Loch Lomond
