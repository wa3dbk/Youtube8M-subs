00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:18.980
In this tutorial video, we'll demonstrate
how intuitive the TRAKTOR KONTROL S4 all-in-one

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:24.040
DJ system is to do live recording, looping
and overdubbing to build up a unique performance,

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:29.180
using just the Loop Recorder, Sample Decks
and TRAKTOR’s amazing effects suite.

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:35.210
Watch how Dub FX created his loop jam on Weekend
Club’s rooftop in Berlin….

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:39.920
The Loop Recorder controls are located centrally
in the S4 mixer section.

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:44.620
They allow to record the output of individual
decks or a live input source, such as the

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:45.860
mic input.

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:50.769
To do this, plug in a microphone into the
S4’s mic input on the rear.

00:00:50.769 --> 00:00:55.400
In TRAKTOR’s preferences, you have convenient
routing options – send the “Input Aux”

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:59.360
to Channel D and turn the “MIC GAIN” clock-wise
to level it correctly.

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:04.080
In the Loop Recorder, select AUX in the input
source drop down menu and make sure that the

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:12.890
dry/wet knob is set all the way to “wet”
– and you’re ready to record!

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:17.680
Once he has engaged via the "REC" button,
it records the input source 8 beats and after

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.640
that starts cycling as a loop.

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:24.580
It allows for further overdubbing by pressing
"REC" again. This is how Dub FX adds more

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:27.210
vocal layers and creates the harmonies.

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.230
The recording loop length can be set using
the "SIZE" button if the Loop Recorder is

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:32.230
empty.

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:36.200
You can free up the Loop Recorder for further
use: Just move the recording into an empty

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:38.250
slot of TRAKTOR's Sample Decks.

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:42.850
To do this, he holds down the "Browse" button
which then allows to copy source audio to

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:44.730
a new destination.

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:48.600
Select the Loop Recorder’s “Play” button
as the source and then an empty loop slot

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:53.250
in a Sample Deck as the destination.

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.670
Dub FX now drops in a breakbeat on one of
the track decks and uses the chunky filter

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:00.950
knob below the channel EQ to slowly bring
it into the mix.

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:05.720
Now watch him add more elements to his performance
using the Loop Recorder with overdub and then

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:07.510
storing them into Sample Deck slots!

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:39.269
The Sample Decks in TRAKTOR can be muted and
unmuted using the Play buttons in the Sample

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:40.269
Deck.

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:43.939
This allows for convenient live arrangements
on-the-fly.

00:02:43.939 --> 00:02:48.299
The upcoming Beatmasher effect is one of the
most popular TRAKTOR effects.

00:02:48.299 --> 00:02:52.879
When engaged, it samples a short bit of audio
and then cuts it up "stutter-style".

00:02:52.879 --> 00:02:56.769
The stutter timing can be controlled with
the first FX knob on the S4.

00:02:56.769 --> 00:03:00.879
The effects layout on the S4 hardware corresponds
with the layout in the software.

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:05.159
The dry/wet knob controls how much of the
original sound gets through.

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:09.420
You can hear TRAKTOR's delay effect in action
here – another extremely popular effect

00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:20.260
that automatically syncs to the master tempo.

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:23.630
We hope you enjoyed taking a closer look at
some of the advanced and unique performance

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:27.339
features of the TRAKTOR KONTROL S4 and that
you will use them in your next set!
