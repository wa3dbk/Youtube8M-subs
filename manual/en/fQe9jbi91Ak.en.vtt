00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:06.649
Today on this 2001 Toyota Tacoma, we're going
to install part number 118534 from Tow Ready.

00:00:06.649 --> 00:00:10.880
Okay,first thing that we're going to do is
go ahead and remove the tail lights.

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:15.880
There are four screws that holdthem in place,
take the tail light back and remove from electrical

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:16.880
connector.

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:20.099
There's a small tab that weneed to push down
and then we can pull it apart.

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:22.890
These are really tight, so it may take some
effort to pull apart.

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:27.509
Now, the driver's side has some extra wires
hooked up to the wire harness that we can't

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:30.970
disconnect, sowe can't completely remove the
tail light.

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:33.489
We'll just leave it as is.

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:38.050
Okay, your tail lights removed, we can go
ahead and start installing the wire harness.

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:41.710
Working on the driver's side, we'll take the
four poles of the wire harness and run it

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:45.100
through the body work down to the bottom.

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:50.190
We'll also do the same thing with the T-connector
with the red and green wire and run it through

00:00:50.190 --> 00:01:00.949
as well, and then the white wire at the ring
terminal, we'll pull that one through as well.

00:01:00.949 --> 00:02:05.180
We'll take our T-connector with the yellow
and brown wire; we'll hook it up to the factory

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:26.140
wire harness.
