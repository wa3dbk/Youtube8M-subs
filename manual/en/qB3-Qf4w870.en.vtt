00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.240
How to Knit a Simple Baby Hat.

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:11.860
This hat will fit most infants up to about
a year-old—but you can easily add more rows

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:14.060
to fit even an adult-sized head.

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:18.580
Just make sure it's an adult who won't mind
a hat with cute, little animal ears.

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:26.440
You will need Some soft yarn Pair of size
8 knitting needles A pair of scissors A tape

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:30.300
measure or ruler and a yarn needle.

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.840
Step 1.

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:37.780
Tie your slip knot and cast on a total of
26 stitches, leaving a six to eight-inch tail.

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:44.850
Use a soft cotton or a cotton blend yarn that
has a little stretch to it for added comfort.

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:45.850
Step 2.

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:51.380
Knit in Stockinette Stitch—that is, alternate
one row of knitting with one row of purling—until

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:54.620
you have a rectangle about 11" long.

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:57.250
Make sure you end on a knit row.

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:58.840
Step 3.

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:02.280
Cast off your last row, leaving about 8" of
yarn.

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.820
Tie a knot to secure it.

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:05.820
Step 4.

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:10.040
Fold your rectangle in half so the smooth,
knitted side—which looks like it&amp;#8217;s

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:13.780
covered in little V&amp;#8217;s—is on the inside,
and the edges are lined up.

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:20.140
The purl side of the project—which looks
bumpy—should be facing out.

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:21.350
Step 5.

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:25.950
Starting at the curling corner of one side,
use a yarn needle and the same tail of yarn

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:30.479
you used to knit the rectangle to sew the
edges together all the way up to the corner

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.080
of your fold.

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:33.590
Step 6.

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:39.170
When you reach the corner, knot the yarn,
and cut off the excess.

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:40.340
Step 7.

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:44.280
Repeat on the other side, beginning at the
other curling corner and sewing the edges

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.640
up to the corner fold.

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:47.750
Step 8.

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.640
When you reach this corner, knot the yarn,
and cut off the excess.

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:56.830
Your hat should now look almost like a square
with only one open side.

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:57.830
Step 9.

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:02.400
Turn the hat right-side-out and put it on
a baby with the &amp;#8220;ears&amp;#8221; out.

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.900
Pretty easy—and totally adorable.

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:12.560
Did you know Forty to 50 percent of lost body
heat exits through the head and neck area,

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:17.310
so wearing a hat is an especially important
way to keep warm.
