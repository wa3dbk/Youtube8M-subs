00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:08.560
[Rawboss] It is what it is...

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:12.394
Life can get the best of you at times,

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:14.660
so you gotta take hold of it.

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:16.760
Chorus [Jael Johnson]

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:19.880
"The time is running out."

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:23.460
"Panic lights are blinking now."

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:27.960
"Pieces are falling down."

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:32.880
"The pleasures come &amp; gone."

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:36.120
"&amp; the nights just feel so long."

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:39.540
"Pieces are falling down."

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:42.520
Verse 1 [Rawboss]

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:45.880
My future is uncertain. It's driving me wild.

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.840
Close the curtain. I feel less than a child.

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.680
What am I promised if I'm sensing nothings available?

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:53.040
I must've chose the path...

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.080
where everything is unattainable.

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:57.700
Time after time, the world is against me.

00:00:57.820 --> 00:00:59.760
I'm falling down to my knees...

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:01.560
asking for the serenity.

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:02.860
But the things I cannot change...

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.360
are the things I want to change.

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:08.260
Not to bring people back, but to have things rearranged.

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.280
I search my heart &amp; thoughts, deeply enough to know...

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.300
No matter how much rejection, to just continue to go.

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.360
Somehow things just keep looking dim.

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:17.740
Have I been condemned?

00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:20.840
I know I'm in that water, but how far is my swim?

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:24.100
I guess I won't know, until I drown, or if I make it.

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:27.160
I'm done with trying to go, wherever life takes me.

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:29.900
The pain of life, is far beyond depression.

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:32.700
 I think I'll get up and leave this psychiatric session.

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:33.420
[end of Verse 1]

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:34.020
Chorus [Jael Johnson]

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:36.900
"The time is running out."

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:40.200
"Panic lights are blinking now."

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:44.120
"Pieces are falling down."

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.620
"The pleasures come &amp; gone."

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:53.400
"&amp; the nights just feel so long."

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:56.620
"Pieces are falling down."

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:59.320
Verse 2 [Rawboss]

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:02.700
I find myself, doubting words of every man.

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.840
Encouragement is dead. I don't know if I can.

00:02:05.980 --> 00:02:08.740
Ever reach my goal. Man it's not this music.

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:11.960
This music is my dream. My goal is how I'm doing.

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.960
&amp; I'm not doing well. I'm going thru a spell.

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:16.780
I'm not talking witchcraft.

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.800
I'm talking more like Hell.

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.780
I'm being held down. Somethings keeping me in check.

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.780
I never asked for this. I am such a wreck.

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.960
All I have is...the little faith I got.

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.180
Even then, I wonder how this all will turn out?

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:32.900
The tears won't stop flowing.

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:34.700
The pressure keeps growing.

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:38.140
I don't know where I'm at, but I'll keep going.

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:40.980
I guess I won't know, until I fall, or if I make it. 

00:02:41.100 --> 00:02:43.840
I'm done with trying to go, wherever life takes me.

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:46.589
The pain of life, is far beyond depression.

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.680
I think I'll get up and leave this psychiatric session.//

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:50.400
[end of Verse 2]

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:51.080
Chorus [Jael Johnson]

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.680
"The time is running out."

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:57.060
"Panic lights are blinking now."

00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:00.920
"Pieces are falling down."

00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:06.440
"The pleasures come &amp; gone."

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:09.360
"&amp; the nights just feel so long."

00:03:10.340 --> 00:03:13.500
"Pieces are falling down."

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:15.760
Verse 3 [Rawboss]

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:19.080
I'm caved in &amp; sleep. Nothings in my reach.

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:20.780
I'm stumbling. I can't see.

00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:22.400
My darkness is deep.

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:25.640
 My mind is falling apart. What was once there is gone.

00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:28.640
My ideas are fading, as if my brain was blown.

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:30.500
Why most people disguise themselves...

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:31.780
disconfiguring my mix?

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:33.880
&amp; most don't care not even a bit.

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:35.320
They just wanna be rich.

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:38.440
They ignore the love of music, that I have.

00:03:38.620 --> 00:03:41.120
&amp; the search for the woman that I'm tryna grab.

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:44.360
My loved ones deserve better, but this is breaking me. 

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:47.780
My substance is fading, &amp; everything that made me.

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:49.840
Something greater doesn't want me happy...

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:51.480
while I'm alive.

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:54.620
I know I'm on that road, but how far is my drive?

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:57.580
I guess I won't know, until I crash or if I make it.

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:01.020
I just may have to go, wherever life takes me.

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:03.520
The pain of life, is far beyond depression.

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:06.180
I am trapped in this psychiatric session.//

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:07.120

"The time is running out."

00:04:10.689 --> 00:04:13.829
"Panic lights are blinking now."

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:17.520
