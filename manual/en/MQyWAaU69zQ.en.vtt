00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:10.430
My name is Cheryl Peterson and I'm the owner / operator 
of the Purple Poodle. The Purple Poodle is the only non-

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:12.899
kenneling dog salon in Brandon Manitoba

00:00:12.899 --> 00:00:17.359
The programs I applied for were originally the Reach Back program through EI

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:20.599
which allowed me a living allowance for the
 first year as I started up my company

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:24.570
as well as a Youth Entrepreneurship Grant that I got because I was under twenty nine

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:30.439
and starting company as well as a loan or 
line of credit through the women't entrepreneurship

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:35.460
my money came to me in a reimbursements if
 I spent $2,000 I got $2,000

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:39.530
The Youth Entrepreneurship worked as if I spent $8,000 they would give me $4,000

00:00:39.530 --> 00:00:43.830
back although I had to have all of my receipts proving I had spent every penny

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:48.200
The Youth Entrepreneurship grant was the biggest grant that I got it was $4,000 it was a big

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:52.610
help because I did not have to pay it back.
 the Women's Entrepreneurship

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:57.430
loan was also extremely helpful. They were 
the only people who would touch me with a bankruptcy

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:58.430
behind me

00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:02.840
without the grants and loans there is no possible 
way I could have opened. I did not have the

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:07.190
financial backing behind me with the bankruptcy,
 my husband was working full time, I was

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:11.850
just coming off of mat leave, we simply didn't 
have the income or the savings to do it

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.710
I was very lucky. I managed to pay back my entire loan

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:18.590
in one year. The money that I received most 
of it,

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:23.460
ninety percent of it went towards equipment.
 Grooming equipment to start up a single groomers is

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.659
close to $3,000 for some initial
 equipment alone

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:32.300
then I had to develop a small states, advertising
, and just getting my name out there

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:36.480
The application process that I went through was a lot of work and getting a business

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:40.040
plan hundred-percent ready and thoroughly 
understanding it

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:45.170
gave light to a lot of things that I didn't know was there and was definitely worth the time

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:49.100
My biggest advice for other people starting up a business
 is to make sure you have your supports, your family,

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:50.930
your friends

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:55.450
they get you through the tough times and I can 
guarantee there will be downfalls. It's

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:57.240
not all a joy ride

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:02.320
there are definitely moments where you want to give up

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:02.570
but don't
