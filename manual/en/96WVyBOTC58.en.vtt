00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.710
[music]

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:09.090
&gt;&gt;&gt; John: Hi my name is John.

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:10.420
&gt;&gt;&gt; Yuqing: Hi, I'm Yuqing.

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:17.420
&gt;&gt;&gt; John: And we're here to show you a genuinely
old piece of Chinese furniture. But because

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:25.040
of heavy usage in China over the course of
the years and because of more adverse indoor

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:32.890
weather conditions than we frequently find
in this county there is often a need for a

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:39.890
lot of restoration to the individual pieces
of furniture. There are four things that have

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.230
been restored here and they're pretty easy
for you to find out once you know what to

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:52.230
look for. They are the doors, the drawer down
at the bottom, the top and these wings right

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:56.829
here. Yuqing, do you want to tell us about
these?

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:03.829
&gt;&gt;&gt; Yuqing: Sure, okay. First of all, let's
open the doors. I believe this was how it

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:13.470
was opened originally. And now they open like
this. So I know this part originally must

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:22.689
be a panel and it was cut from here and this
pull was originally here. It was moved over

00:01:26.799 --> 00:01:33.740
here. This way - why they do that, they can
open it all the way so they can add a shelf

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.380
inside. They can maximize the using of the
interior space.

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:43.850
&gt;&gt;&gt; John: And you know that because you can
see the spot down here where this hinge was

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:44.649
originally filled in.

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:49.700
&gt;&gt;&gt; Yuqing: Yes, this is the rung where too
and the spots filled up on this side and of

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.700
course on the other side too.

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:59.700
&gt;&gt;&gt; John: And you can also feel here with
your hands the matching hole that was filled

00:01:59.959 --> 00:02:06.029
in to the one on the bottom. So those are
great things for you to check out just to

00:02:06.029 --> 00:02:09.280
know what's been done. You want to tell us
about the drawer Yuqing?

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:16.280
&gt;&gt;&gt; Yuqing: Yes let's open it. This drawer
to me, obviously originally this piece is

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:25.569
supposed not to have a drawer down below.
And now it has it and I think this must be

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:34.370
added. They added this because it's inconvenient
to reach stuff from the inside. So they added

00:02:37.239 --> 00:02:41.150
a drawer in there to maximize the using to
make it more functional as well.

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:48.150
&gt;&gt;&gt; John: And you can tell by looking at the
top of the drawer and you can see the line

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:58.319
right along here where the panel originally
was and then this drawer added. Also there's

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:02.299
no wear on the runners and slides where the
drawer gets pulled out.

00:03:02.299 --> 00:03:05.560
&gt;&gt;&gt; Yuqing: But you can see where it was originally
a panel.

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:12.560
&gt;&gt;&gt; John: Correct, correct. Boy I tell you,
they really do a terrific job on taking old

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:18.790
furniture and turning it into something that
is very, very useful. There were two more

00:03:18.790 --> 00:03:24.739
areas that I said we would talk about the
top being one. Yuqing talk to us about this

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:24.989
top.

00:03:24.859 --> 00:03:31.859
&gt;&gt;&gt; Yuqing: Sure, okay. This top, to me, this
is a piece at least 100 years old. It shouldn't

00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:37.280
have a top with such flat and smooth feeling.

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:37.739
&gt;&gt;&gt; John: Sure.

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:44.200
&gt;&gt;&gt; Yuqing: When I touch it. So it must be
something done on it. They either planed it

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:51.200
to make the top more smooth and flat or what
they could do if the top was severely damaged

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.780
they could just replace the top.

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:58.010
&gt;&gt;&gt; John: Replace the panel.

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:01.139
&gt;&gt;&gt; Yuqing: The panel and not rim.

00:04:01.139 --> 00:04:07.400
&gt;&gt;&gt; John: And do you want to talk with us
also about what might have been done on the

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:08.069
sides here?

00:04:08.069 --> 00:04:14.909
&gt;&gt;&gt; Yuqing: Okay, the side - we're talking
about the apron, we call it the apron -- 

00:04:14.909 --> 00:04:21.909
the wings. This wing looks small to me and
down below I saw some further marks which

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:30.170
is giving me a hint that this wing was originally
bigger. Why they cut it off one thing, they

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:37.170
think it's better with a simple look or this
wing was damaged a lot on either side or both

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:44.890
sides. So they make it smaller now. They make
it simple looking as well.

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:50.320
&gt;&gt;&gt; John: Cheaper than trying to repair the
whole thing. So thanks Yuqing these are some

00:04:50.320 --> 00:04:57.320
simple things that you can look for when you're
checking out a nice, old piece of Chinese

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:04.200
vernacular furniture. That is furniture that
was used by just everyday folks like us. Thanks

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:04.450
again.

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:05.700
&gt;&gt;&gt; Yuqing: Thank you.
