00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:07.110
So here's some ice cream we put in the freezer.

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:12.220
We made it yesterday overnight and it's nice
and hard again.

00:00:12.220 --> 00:00:13.309
It's a real process.

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:18.010
If you're going to make ice cream, make a
lot of it, because you might as well keep

00:00:18.010 --> 00:00:21.419
it and it freezes, obviously it freezes.

00:00:21.419 --> 00:00:29.390
It's a straightforward what they call pain
a la francias, which is just a flowering of

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:30.860
bread crumbs.

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:32.930
You don't have to be particularly careful
about it.

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:35.950
You just need to compress it in a little bit.

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:39.610
You're going to be bread crumbing these things
three times.

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:47.830
Because we let people come in and fry anything
they want here, as long as it doesn't kill

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:53.370
the oil, irritate the health department, or
hurt our chefs.

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:58.690
Ice cream is one of the few things we say
no to, because it destroys the oil if it's

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:07.340
not done right, and without three days prep
you can't do it right.

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:12.350
You've obviously got to work really fast with
it or else it'll melt and that defeats the

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:13.350
object.

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:15.679
And you can have fun with it as well.

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:25.020
You could do rum raisin ice cream, do shots
of rum with it or vanilla ice cream and pour

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:29.740
really good balsamic vinegar over it.

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:36.350
I don't like making it just because it's a
pain for me to make it in the store, but I

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:37.789
understand the appeal of it.

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:44.109
I would actually, probably if somebody else
were to make it for me, I'd probably eat it

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:46.819
quite regularly.

00:01:46.819 --> 00:01:56.229
So you've got to work really fast with this
stuff and you put it back in the container,

00:01:56.229 --> 00:02:00.649
back into the freezer again for another 24
hours.

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:05.799
So the process is, you make the balls of ice
cream and you freeze it overnight.

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:10.179
You flour, egg, and breadcrumb them the next
day, and you freeze it overnight.

00:02:10.179 --> 00:02:14.540
You flour, egg and breadcrumb it the next
day, and you freeze it overnight again.

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:19.610
Then you give it the last flour, egg and breadcrumb,
and it takes a bath.
