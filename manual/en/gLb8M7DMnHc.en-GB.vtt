00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:14.490
Now, I don't like to brag, but I do come from
a bit of a dancing background, which is why,

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:20.700
ahead of this year's Sony Xperia B-Boy Championships,
I was chosen to bust some moves with B-Boy

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:25.470
and B-Girl world champions Mouse and Roxy.
This should be interesting...

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:35.540
Roxy. Mouse. Nice to meet you. Now you guys
are a world champion B-Boy and B-Girl. Obviously,

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:42.500
this isn't my strongest area of dance. What
are you going to attempt to teach me today?

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:47.510
Well, we're going to teach you some of the
basics, so we'll top rock to start with, and

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:51.260
then we'll teach you some footwork. We'll
probably teach you a freeze, and then we'll

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:52.120
probably put a routine together for you.
Awesome let's do it.

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:59.120
The first step is called a two-step. It goes
like this.

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:06.120
Cross your arms on your chest, and slap your
right leg across your left leg. Five, six, seven, and...

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:17.420
For the next step that we're going to do...
It's called the Charleston step. Five, six,

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:23.779
seven and...
One two three four five six seven eight.

00:01:23.779 --> 00:01:27.310
Great.
I'm going to teach you some footwork. Okay.

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:30.520
It's going to look like this. Okay.

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:38.140
Yeah, looks easy.

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:48.299
So right leg out, and then cross it over.
Step one. Left leg back. Step two. Leg out

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:55.299
here. Three. Four. Right leg in. Five. And
back to the front. Six. Nice.

00:01:55.710 --> 00:02:02.710
So I'm going to show you a very basic Freeze.
It's called a Baby Freeze. It looks just like this.

00:02:05.689 --> 00:02:10.770
You're going to go in this all fours position.

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:18.900
Okay, put your hands in the middle. Then you
lower yourself down on your elbow. Put the

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:25.900
right side of your head on the floor. Like
this. And you put your right hand on your

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:27.220
hip. Just like that.

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:37.920
Right then guys. I think it's time to put
these moves together. Psyche.

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:45.760
Five six seven and...

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:09.540
There she is!
