a transitional color.

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:48.420
Then, I'm using "Sienna" from that same palette
and applying it to my crease.

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:54.480
Using this lighter orange color, i'm applying
that a little above "Orange Soda"

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.490
And then, Using a color tattoo by Maybelline,
called Barely Branded; i'm using this on top

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:01.600
of the lid.

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.910
Buffing out any harsh lines.

00:01:04.910 --> 00:01:09.820
And taking this darker orange color to the
corners and, sort of into the middle of the

and applying this to my upper and lower lashes.

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:51.700
And then, going underneath and touching up
and using a wet n wild "reserve your cabana"
