00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.779
Two Cadbury's cream eggs, not Hershey's.

00:00:07.779 --> 00:00:11.309
Cadbury's from England, imported, they are
so much nicer.

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:14.839
I am a little bit biased of course, but there
you go.

00:00:14.839 --> 00:00:17.250
You've got to put them in the batter first.

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:18.770
Then in the flour.

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:22.320
Then in the batter again, because otherwise
the batter won't stick to them and you'll

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:24.540
have a disaster on your hands.

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:30.280
These are a once a year delicacy, and you've
got to eat it with a spoon, because if you

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:35.489
bite into them, you may well get a blister
on your chin.

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:45.470
So give it a base for the flour and these
have to be winged into the fryer.

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:48.280
This is a whole different ball game.

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:56.750
This is where, you cameramen should stand
back a bit probably.

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:05.939
All right, because they're small, because
if your finger touches them too hard, the

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.079
batter is going to come off and it's not going
to work.

00:01:08.079 --> 00:01:15.700
So it is one of these.

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:21.399
It's funny how every chocolate bar, basically
is fried a slightly different way, because

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:23.210
of the way the chocolate bar is.

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:27.530
And you can't fry things like plain chocolate
bars.

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.100
They've gotta have some density to them.

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:37.600
In fact, that one sometimes that happens and
what you do is you just dip it back in the

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.670
batter again and you drop it in again.

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:43.299
What you don't want is the chocolate melting
into the fryer.

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:46.149
These take a couple minutes.

00:01:46.149 --> 00:01:53.279
I was trying to think of any redeeming health
features of a deep fried Cadbury's cream egg

00:01:53.279 --> 00:01:55.999
and I came up a blank.

00:01:55.999 --> 00:02:08.890
I eat one a year.

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:19.970
There we go, absolutely perfect.

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:23.750
You can see the orange, you can see the yellow.

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:26.900
It is an experience.

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:28.939
It is a real experience.

00:02:28.939 --> 00:02:32.720
I'm sorry guys, I don't think you're going
have this one to eat.

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:33.090
I think this one is mine.
