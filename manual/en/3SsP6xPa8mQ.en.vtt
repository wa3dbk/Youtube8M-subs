00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
There is a reason surfers travel the globe in search of the perfect wave

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
We are all looking for that indescribable feeling. 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.639
What if we didn't have to travel the world to get it? 

00:00:15.639 --> 00:00:19.000
What if every river city could have a perfect surf wave?
 

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
What if everyone could be a surfer?

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
My name is Neil Egsgard, president of the Alberta River Surfing Association

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:35.000
And our misson is to build the perfect river surfing wave and share it with the world. 

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.000
We will tweak old designs, invent new waves test ideas from around the world 

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
and freely share that knowledge with wave builders everywhere. 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:54.000
In the perfect union of engineered design and inspired experimentation we will sculpt waves and shape the future of river surfing.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
We have a proven design 

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000
We have the perfect location, 

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
we have government support (federal, provincial and local) 

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000
and we have the engineers lined up and ready to go. 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:17.000
The only piece we need to turn this dream of a perfect surf wave into a reality we can share with you and the world is the money.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Stage one is the engineering. 

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.000
With your help to raise the $15,000 for the structural, hydraulic and environmental engineering

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:32.000
we will unite surf seekers everywhere and create the engineered plans for a perfect surf wave. 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Those plans with be available on RiverSurfing.ca so you can start building your own wave

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.760
Stage two is building the wave. 

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:45.000
Building the wave will cost around $200,000 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000
and when built will be free to use. 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:54.000
We will release detailed video of the build 

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:58.000
and how the wave changes as we adjust the feature.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
So, join the movement, 

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.500
spread the word,

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.000
donate

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000
and start building a surf wave near you.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.000
Help bring surfing everywhere!
