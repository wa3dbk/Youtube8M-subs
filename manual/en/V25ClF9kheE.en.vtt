You want your granny to tell you some story?

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:05.540
No.

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:08.240
The possibilities are unlimited!

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:09.220
You look strange.

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:11.340
Did you come to take a look through my telescope?

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:12.380
Nope, but why not?

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:52.820

Oh, hey!

A gang of racist school kids without any education wants me to play hide and seek with them!

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:11.580

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:25.100
You jumped out of the 3rd floor..

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:26.680
You could've been dead!

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.140
