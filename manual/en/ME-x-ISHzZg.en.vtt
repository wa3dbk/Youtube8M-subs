00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:04.600
the 3D editor tools

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:05.200
allow

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:08.889
to hand modify a  volume

00:00:08.889 --> 00:00:11.269
let's start the tools here

00:00:11.269 --> 00:00:12.899
and we can select

00:00:12.899 --> 00:00:19.349
a portion of the image

00:00:19.349 --> 00:00:21.919
and this will show up on the

00:00:21.919 --> 00:00:28.919
preview here.
I can move it

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.779
and I can decide

00:00:31.779 --> 00:00:32.770
how I want to

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:35.090
modify the image

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:39.130
I mean the volume.
I can extrude or emboss

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:41.780
I will use simply dig and grow

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:44.190
which is easier for me to say

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.010
so we can use

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:48.110
different shapes

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:49.840
like spherical

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:52.210
bicubic, linear, or constant

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:55.640
let's grow with

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:58.940
grow with a constant

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:00.870
value

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:07.870
we get this kind of  thing happening here

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:13.040
i can do that on the over side
on the back side

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:20.040
let's take a different shape

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.640
if i want something

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.250
round

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:29.900
to happen here

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:35.119
i just can add

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:42.119
something like that

00:01:43.010 --> 00:01:45.210
ok, that's the way

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.110
it works basically

00:01:47.110 --> 00:01:49.760
now we'll look at some

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:53.480
practical applications

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:58.130
i'm not an artist so i will just show
you the principles and i hope

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:00.390
i will not

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:04.070
destroy too much this nice young lady

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.590
here we will initialize

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:08.819
animation

00:02:08.819 --> 00:02:13.009
as a 3D mesh full image

00:02:13.009 --> 00:02:20.009
which means it's a flat image at the beginning

00:02:25.419 --> 00:02:32.419
select the tools

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:50.959
okay that's just the principle of it

00:03:50.959 --> 00:03:53.439
i'm really not an artist but

00:03:53.439 --> 00:03:55.229
i'm sure

00:03:55.229 --> 00:03:57.729
some people can do something

00:03:57.729 --> 00:04:02.540
nice with that i hope so

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:07.569
something easier for me is to show you
how the 3D editor tools

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:11.509
can be used to create
3D graphics

00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:13.279
for example here

00:04:13.279 --> 00:04:17.209
i select

00:04:17.209 --> 00:04:24.209
this part

00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:37.840
here i will use the tilt plane tool

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:42.650
as its name implies this tool
allows to tilt

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:44.309
a plane like this

00:04:44.309 --> 00:04:46.509
which is an interesting effect

00:04:59.599 --> 00:05:03.309
and finally this is another
application of the tilt plane tool

00:05:03.309 --> 00:05:06.360
as we have seen before

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:12.259
to produce nice 3D effects

00:05:12.259 --> 00:05:19.259
let's look at the video
