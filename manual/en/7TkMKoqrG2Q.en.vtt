00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:04.800
Laurel: Do you guys know that pottery pl-

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:08.880
Do you know that pottery place? It's on Magnolia?

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:11.920
They’re like, um…they’re all…
(frustrated breathing).

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:15.400
[Voiceover] Mm, mm…eww.

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:20.100
Laurel: They keep really weird hours.                                 It’s like…it’s like, uh!

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:21.660
Really random hours-

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:23.400
like two to four on Thursdays.

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:29.859
Megan: Is that the one that’s by the…mm!
Mm! I don’t like that. I don’t like that!

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:31.419
Um, the cupcake shop?

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:35.910
Molly: Oh, I know what you’re talking about.
That’s a Donut Shop. Used to be a Taco Bell.

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.690
And you could clearly tell it used to be a
Taco Bell. Like you could see that there was

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.480
a drive-up window and everything. Around the side.

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:44.580
All done.

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:47.760
Laurel: No, I’m talking about the place
that’s next to…ah!

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.140
There are strawberries?! There are strawberries?!

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:52.920
(intense heavy breathing) There are strawberries.

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.680
(Disgusting heavy nose breathing).

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:02.020
Mm. Mm. Mm. (Excited eating noises for way too long).

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:04.290
It's next to the hair salon, “Curl Up and Dye.”

00:01:04.290 --> 00:01:08.330
Megan: I know exactly what you’re talking
about. Um.

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:12.580
Um....

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:15.990
It... (sighs) Mmmm.

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:21.220
(Gross food sound, almost sounds like a fart)

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:23.800
Molly: Oh, you know you’re thinking of that
dress shop that has, like, dresses from the

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:27.120
‘50s and ‘60s, like vintage dresses with
flowers all over them.

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:36.340
(extended gulping noises that are too loud                      and mean she’s probably taking in air as she swallows).

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:38.380
Megan: (More of the food blowing/fart sound).

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:41.800
Molly: (More gulps followed by that disgusting sound people make when they’re finished drinking something and feel deeply satisfied: “Ah!”)

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:45.120
Laurel: Honestly I don’t know if you guys
are-- (now with a full mouth of food) -really getting what I'm saying.

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:46.580
It’s on Magnolia.

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:48.740
Megan: Yeah, I know.

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.220
Molly: (indecipherable because of all the
food in her mouth)

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:52.660
Laurel: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. Exactly. Exactly.

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:55.560
All: (indecipherable because of food in their
mouths)

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.780
Molly: (appearing like she might choke but holding it together and uttering “Mm.”)
