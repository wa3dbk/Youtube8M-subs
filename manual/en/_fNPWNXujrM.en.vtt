00:00:03.679 --> 00:00:07.500
Without Cherriots, I wouldn’t be able to
function the way I do.

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:12.500
If Cherriots were not operating, I wouldn’t be able to stay in this town because of so many things that I’m

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:15.500
involved in. It's very important to me.

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:22.800
Without Cherriots and without the drivers, I don’t know how to get around and about.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.140
I especially appreciate their help with the people that

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:32.579
are wheelchair-bound, that are sight impaired, the young mothers with children. You know,

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:39.579
they are tremendously helpful.
Whether you use a device, can, walker, chair,

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:44.550
if you have special needs, you need training,
they’re there for you. And that’s what

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:51.000
so nice about the bus system in Salem is it
opens the doors to absolutely everyone.

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:58.530
Whatever the cost, whether it’s an hour of transportation per day to get from south to north and back again,

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:03.000
I think it’s important to really
get there by myself. It’s very important to me to be independent.

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:07.380
They offered training with my wheelchair on the regular bus. And I had

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:14.800
so much fun. And now I take bus as often as I can just because it’s a great way to out in the community.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.290
I can plan my whole trip,
wherever I want to go, and be back home within

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:26.100
two or three hours, all taking bus and I don’t have to fill my tank with gas. It’s just very convenient.

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:29.930
And I have people that come
that are waiting for the bus and asking me

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:35.759
questions about using the wheelchair on the
bus, “How do you get that thing on the bus?”

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:40.600
It is so easy because a bus kneels down to
me. Basically, if you’re driving to school,

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:46.750
you’re using up a lot more gas and polluting
the air a whole lot more than the public transportation

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:53.259
does. It’s less expensive and most seniors,
you know, are on limited incomes.

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:56.369
And most of the drivers I’m on a first name basis with, they say good morning and call you by

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:01.490
name and you know their name, and I’ve never
had a driver that wasn’t friendly on the

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:07.590
Cherriots bus. And the bus drivers are always
awesome because I know each and every one

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:13.209
of them. A lot of seniors don’t walk. They
sit around all day and walking is good for

00:02:13.209 --> 00:02:18.609
you. I find that if I have to walk five or
six blocks, that’s great. There is no reason

00:02:18.609 --> 00:02:24.849
to change your lifestyle as a result of not
being mobile. My favorite thing about Cherriots

00:02:24.849 --> 00:02:31.609
is the capability to get from one place to another
quickly and feel safe. People with disabilities

00:02:31.609 --> 00:02:36.000
can always ride the buses. There is no I can’t do this, they can!

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:48.540
All over Salem I have these things that I am committed to doing and it would be virtually impossible to make those commitments

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:53.279
effective for me time wise, If I had to – If
I couldn’t do Cherriots. It’s very vital

00:02:53.279 --> 00:02:57.599
to the life that I currently live. You start
feeling good about, number one, about the

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:02.739
money you are saving; number two, about the
environment, you are meeting new people, and

00:03:02.739 --> 00:03:08.510
it is an all-around good experience. So I
would urge anyone who feels it's an inconvenience

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:13.559
to try it for a week and see if it doesn’t
help. Having the disability and having to

00:03:13.559 --> 00:03:19.510
use the transit, this is the place to be.
Salem has it. You can be secure no matter

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:24.000
what you are using to get on that bus. And
I think it is a wonderful experience.
