00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:27.960
Reflected in your eyes,
The street was silent,

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:34.840
I've been waiting for this meeting,
And she was the parting.

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:42.000
A flock of leaves fell at his feet,
And the rain was filled with laughter,

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:48.660
When the fall after you closed,
White curtain of wet snow.

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:54.480
I remember the snow close up eyes
Wind bowed his head to me

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.379
Eve did not have to die
Sealy

00:00:59.379 --> 00:01:02.979
Hands down.

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:09.200
And then when the wind stopped,
Taking with them all that could

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:16.620
The snow was melting on my cheeks,
Falling at his feet.

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:28.700
And I stand alone on an empty road,
And if you're still somewhere close quartered,

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:33.320
Just touch me look

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:36.930
And I will do all that is necessary,

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:45.070
If you're still somewhere near
with me.

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:52.800
It all seemed so simple,
Who then made a mistake,

00:01:52.800 --> 00:02:01.020
This sky I remember another,
Remembering your smile,

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:07.120
The leaves fall on my shoulders,
Approaching cold evening,

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:14.020
Word of our new meeting,
The yards scatter wind.

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:27.700
And I'm one nadoroge empty
If you're still somewhere close quartered,

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:34.900
Just touch me look
And I will do all that is necessary,

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:40.600
If you're still somewhere near
with me.

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:13.020
Just touch me look
And I will do all that is necessary,

00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:18.860
If you're still somewhere near
with me.

00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:25.500
If you're still somewhere near
with me.

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:32.040
If you're still somewhere near.
