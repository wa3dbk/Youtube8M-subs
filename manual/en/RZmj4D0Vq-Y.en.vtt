00:02:23.114 --> 00:02:30.177
you a better deal. You're in a lot of trouble Mr. Falcon. You killed three men with extreme

00:02:30.177 --> 00:02:39.430

fair trial if the angry policemen don't kill you before. Or, you can accept my proposition and

00:03:27.965 --> 00:03:30.100
leave with me right now.
