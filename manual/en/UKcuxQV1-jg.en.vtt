00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.302
"Prostate Cancer Survival: The A/V Ratio"

00:00:07.302 --> 00:00:11.290
It is now 8 years since the famous 
Ornish study was published, 

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:14.939
suggesting that 12 months on a 
strictly plant-based diet 

00:00:14.939 --> 00:00:19.672
could reverse the progression 
of prostate cancer. 

00:00:19.672 --> 00:00:21.705
Wait a second! 

00:00:21.705 --> 00:00:23.806
How were they able to get 
a group of older men

00:00:23.806 --> 00:00:25.751
to go vegan 
for a year? 

00:00:25.751 --> 00:00:29.207
They home delivered prepared 
meals to their door, 

00:00:29.207 --> 00:00:31.433
figuring men 
are so lazy 

00:00:31.433 --> 00:00:33.937
they'll just eat whatever 
is put in front of them. 

00:00:33.937 --> 00:00:37.594
But what about out 
in the real world? 

00:00:37.594 --> 00:00:40.508
Realizing that you can't even 
get most men with cancer

00:00:40.508 --> 00:00:43.374
to eat a measly five servings 
of fruits and veggies,

00:00:43.374 --> 00:00:47.823
researchers settled on just trying 
to change their A to V ratio, 

00:00:47.823 --> 00:00:50.591
the ratio of animal to 
vegetable proteins, 

00:00:50.591 --> 00:00:54.990
and indeed were successful in cutting 
this ratio in half at least, 

00:00:54.990 --> 00:01:00.025
from about 2 to 1 animal to plant 
to kinda half vegan, 1 to 1. 

00:01:00.025 --> 00:01:01.428
How'd they do? 

00:01:01.428 --> 00:01:04.659
Looks like their cancer 
was slowed down.

00:01:04.659 --> 00:01:06.923
"The average PSA
 doubling time" 

00:01:06.923 --> 00:01:10.557
(an estimate of how fast the tumor 
may be doubling in size) 

00:01:10.557 --> 00:01:11.969
in the half 
vegan group

00:01:11.969 --> 00:01:15.266
slowed from 21 months 
to 58 months. 

00:01:15.266 --> 00:01:17.163
So the cancer 
kept growing,

00:01:17.163 --> 00:01:19.403
but with a part-time
 plant-based diet 

00:01:19.403 --> 00:01:22.533
they appeared to be 
able to slow down 

00:01:22.533 --> 00:01:24.134
the tumor's 
expansion. 

00:01:24.134 --> 00:01:26.325
What Ornish got, though, 
was an apparent 

00:01:26.325 --> 00:01:28.001
reversal in 
cancer growth, 

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.902
the PSA didn't 
just rise slower, 

00:01:30.902 --> 00:01:33.302
it trended down, 

00:01:33.302 --> 00:01:36.033
which could be an indication 
of tumor shrinkage. 

00:01:36.033 --> 00:01:41.530
So the ideal A to V ratio 
may be closer to zero.

00:01:41.533 --> 00:01:45.410
If there's just no way 
grampa's going vegan,

00:01:45.414 --> 00:01:47.040
and we just have 
half-measures, 

00:01:47.045 --> 00:01:50.900
which might be the worst A 
and the best V? 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:55.790
Eggs and poultry 
may be the worst, 

00:01:55.793 --> 00:01:57.730
respectively doublingâ€¦  

00:01:57.733 --> 00:02:00.300
and potentially 
quadrupling the risk 

00:02:00.302 --> 00:02:03.940
of cancer progression in 
this study out of Harvard. 

00:02:03.945 --> 00:02:07.770
Twice the risk eating less 
than a single egg a day,

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.220
quadruple the risk 
eating less than a

00:02:09.224 --> 00:02:12.230
single serving of 
chicken or turkey. 

00:02:12.234 --> 00:02:15.420
And if you could only add 
one thing to your diet, 

00:02:15.422 --> 00:02:17.400
cruciferous vegetables. 

00:02:17.401 --> 00:02:19.540
Less than a single 
serving a day 

00:02:19.545 --> 00:02:21.170
of either broccoli 
or Brussels sprouts, 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:23.300
cabbage, cauliflower or kale 

00:02:23.302 --> 00:02:26.460
may cut the risk of cancer 
progression more than half, 

00:02:26.460 --> 00:02:28.870
defined as cancer 
coming back, 

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:31.800
spreading to the bone, 
or death.

00:02:31.808 --> 00:02:35.740
This animal to plant 
ratio might be useful 

00:02:35.748 --> 00:02:38.700
for cancer prevention as well. 

00:02:38.703 --> 00:02:41.150
For example, in the largest 
study ever performed 

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:42.800
on diet and 
bladder cancer, 

00:02:42.801 --> 00:02:46.960
just a 3% increase in the 
consumption of animal protein 

00:02:46.963 --> 00:02:52.070
was associated with a 15% 
higher risk of bladder cancer,

00:02:52.070 --> 00:02:55.020
whereas a 2% increase in 
plant protein intake

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:58.130
was associated with
a 23% lower risk. 

00:02:58.133 --> 00:03:00.820
Even little changes 
in our diet

00:03:00.821 --> 00:03:05.630
can have significant effects.
