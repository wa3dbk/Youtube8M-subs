Hello everybody! Many of you tell me that
some of my most useful videos are the heatless

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:10.669
curling tutorials, so today, I'm bringing
you another cheap and easy method to try!

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:16.080
This method will give you some big loose soft
curls, and best of all, you can do it overnight!

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:22.380
To get started, you're going to need two clean
socks. Begin by cutting off the tip of the

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:30.100
sock and roll it down to get a sock donut.
Repeat this with other sock and you should

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:34.980
get something like this. If you already have
some hair donut accessories lying around,

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.580
you can try using those instead but I think
the material of a sock might work better.

00:00:40.579 --> 00:00:45.789
Once you have your sock donut, we can get
started! Divide your hair in half from the

00:00:45.789 --> 00:00:50.519
back and brush out one side to get rid of
any tangles. Spray your hair with some water

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:56.560
to slightly dampen it. Then, gather it up
into a high ponytail and pull it through your sock donut.

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:04.880
Next, lightly twist your hair
in one direction and wrap it around the sock.

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:09.220
My hair usually stays as is, but since
I'm sleeping with this overnight, I'm going

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:12.200
to make it more secure by pinning the ends
of my hair with a bobby pin. 

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:18.860
Continue these steps to the other side. 

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:26.080
This method works especially well if you have
thin hair because using a sock as a tool will

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:29.940
widen the base of your bun and allow you to
have big loose curls. If your hair is super

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:36.420
thick and heavy, I'd recommend dividing it
into 4 smaller sections and using 4 socks.

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:41.820
Now that you have our hair up, you're going
to start the waiting game. If you dampened

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:46.590
your hair just slightly, it shouldn't take
more than 2 hours to be completely dry.

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:50.280
I want my curls to last longer, so I'm going
to sleep with it, and it was comfortable because

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.300
the buns were situated on top of my head.

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:01.060
Alrighty, so this is me in the morning and
I'm getting ready to go out shopping.

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:07.620
Gravity kind of pulled down the buns a bit, but everything looks pretty good. To release your curls,

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:12.769
you just remove any pins, unwind your hair,
and pull the sock out. And you can see that

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:14.349
the curls and waves have formed.

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:22.560
Since they're big and loose, I'm going to
give them a mist of hairspray for extra hold.

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:25.720
I love how these curls have given me a boost
of volume at the top.

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:32.099
Now Let's see how well these curls will last
throughout the day. By the time I finished

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:35.079
filming this part of the video, it was around
1 o'clock and here

00:02:35.079 --> 00:02:41.540
are some pictures of the curls. After I went
about my day, it was around 11pm when I got

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:48.540
ready for bed, and here are the results 10 hours later. The curls have lost most of its

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:53.260
shape, but there's still some volume at the
top and the bottom looks very relaxed. I actually

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.960
quite like this hairstyle too; it looks very
effortless.

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:04.760
The first time I tried this method, I wrapped my hair tighter around the socks, and they gave me these slightly more defined curls and waves.

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:09.660
So depending on what you use and how tightly you wrap your hair, you can get different results. 

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:16.800
I hope you all enjoyed this quick heatless curling tutorial. You should definitely give it a try and let me know how it goes.
