00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.082
- Can people really
come back from the dead?

00:00:02.082 --> 00:00:03.498
Some people think they already have,

00:00:03.498 --> 00:00:05.112
and if you don't die
in the next two minutes

00:00:05.112 --> 00:00:06.401
you'll find out why.

00:00:06.401 --> 00:00:11.401
(eerie music)

00:00:11.521 --> 00:00:13.472
There's a lot we don't know about how

00:00:13.472 --> 00:00:14.911
our brains and bodies work,

00:00:14.911 --> 00:00:17.373
or sometimes don't work as expected.

00:00:17.373 --> 00:00:19.381
Theses conditions might
sound like fiction,

00:00:19.381 --> 00:00:21.854
but they're very real, if very rare.

00:00:21.854 --> 00:00:25.198
(eerie music)

00:00:27.489 --> 00:00:29.963
After surviving a stroke
or traumatic brain injury

00:00:29.963 --> 00:00:32.006
very few people find themselves speaking

00:00:32.006 --> 00:00:33.771
with a strange new accent.

00:00:33.771 --> 00:00:35.848
Foreign Accent Syndrome
is caused by damage

00:00:35.848 --> 00:00:38.414
to parts of the brain that
control and coordinate

00:00:38.414 --> 00:00:40.005
the muscles used in speech.

00:00:40.005 --> 00:00:42.768
It changes the way you
pronounce vowels and consonants,

00:00:42.768 --> 00:00:44.672
positions your tongue differently,

00:00:44.672 --> 00:00:46.890
and switches the rhythms of your words.

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.793
It's not that you've actually
adopted a specific dialect,

00:00:49.793 --> 00:00:52.265
you'll have traces of a
few different accents,

00:00:52.265 --> 00:00:54.935
and listeners might pick
out whatever's strongest

00:00:54.935 --> 00:00:56.293
or most familiar to them.

00:00:56.293 --> 00:00:59.010
Speech therapy can help,
but no know cure exists.

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.462
(eerie music)

00:01:04.304 --> 00:01:06.568
No this one doesn't cause
you to howl at the moon,

00:01:06.568 --> 00:01:09.064
and it won't make you better
at high school sports.

00:01:09.064 --> 00:01:12.155
Werewolf syndrome, properly
called Hypertrichosis

00:01:12.155 --> 00:01:13.875
is the overproduction of hair.

00:01:13.875 --> 00:01:16.988
It can affect your whole
body or just isolated spots.

00:01:16.988 --> 00:01:19.716
And anyone, men, women,
babies and adults alike,

00:01:19.716 --> 00:01:21.226
can experience it.

00:01:21.226 --> 00:01:23.072
It's the result of a genetic mutation,

00:01:23.072 --> 00:01:25.498
the fine soft hair that covers a fetus

00:01:25.498 --> 00:01:27.623
continues to grow instead
of shedding before birth

00:01:27.623 --> 00:01:28.935
as per the usual.

00:01:28.935 --> 00:01:31.465
It can develop later in life
due to your body's reactions

00:01:31.465 --> 00:01:33.707
to hormone imbalances, anabolic steroids,

00:01:33.707 --> 00:01:35.529
or other medications.

00:01:35.529 --> 00:01:39.320
(eerie music)

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:41.984
This psychological disorder is diagnosised

00:01:41.984 --> 00:01:43.865
along with depression or other conditions,

00:01:43.865 --> 00:01:46.152
but it has a striking symptom of it's own.

00:01:46.152 --> 00:01:47.766
Your belief that you are dead,

00:01:47.766 --> 00:01:50.425
or that some parts of your
body are missing or rotting.

00:01:50.425 --> 00:01:53.216
First described in 1880
by Doctor Jules Cotard,

00:01:53.216 --> 00:01:54.945
this delusion doesn't always affect

00:01:54.945 --> 00:01:56.686
your speech, movement, or other behavior,

00:01:56.686 --> 00:01:58.892
but you'll insist that you are dead.

00:01:58.892 --> 00:02:00.993
Which give the disorder
it's colloquial name,

00:02:00.993 --> 00:02:02.851
Walking Corpse Syndrome.

00:02:02.851 --> 00:02:04.210
Treatments include the standards

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:05.731
for extreme depression and delusion

00:02:05.731 --> 00:02:08.493
like psychiatric drugs and
electro-convulsive therapy.

00:02:08.493 --> 00:02:12.973
(eerie music)

00:02:12.973 --> 00:02:16.073
Sometimes called Persistent
Sexual Arousal Syndrome,

00:02:16.073 --> 00:02:18.115
or Restless Genital Syndrome,

00:02:18.115 --> 00:02:20.660
this physicakl disorder
causes uncontrollable,

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.574
painfully intense genital
simulation in women,

00:02:23.574 --> 00:02:26.860
independent of sexual desire
and purposeful contact.

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:29.379
As little as the vibration of a moving car

00:02:29.379 --> 00:02:32.177
can set off hours of
life-stopping sensation.

00:02:32.177 --> 00:02:34.558
Sexual contact or orgasm don't help,

00:02:34.558 --> 00:02:36.228
they aggravate the symptoms.

00:02:36.228 --> 00:02:39.421
Researcher aren't sure why
it happens or how to stop it,

00:02:39.421 --> 00:02:41.941
but some suggest that it's
related to varicose veins

00:02:41.941 --> 00:02:43.601
and restless leg syndrome.

00:02:43.601 --> 00:02:46.469
That's all the bizarre medical
stuff we have time for today,

00:02:46.469 --> 00:02:49.719

mosquitoes spread elephantiasis,
