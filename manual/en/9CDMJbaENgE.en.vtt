00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:18.990
Bob: So at your level of play as a Top 125
player in the world of golf, you obviously

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.349
have a grip that you feel gives you the right
grip pressure for you.

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:25.289
Can you tell me what grip you play and why
you play it?

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:26.289
Brendan: Yes.

00:00:26.289 --> 00:00:30.689
I play the Lamkin Crossline Cord, and I've
played that since I was in college.

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:32.460
I have a lot of comfort with it.

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:36.240
I've done everything in my career that I've
done well, I've done with this grip.

00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:40.760
To me, it gives me a lot of control, no matter
what conditions we're playing in, whether

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.510
it's hot, cold, wet, dry.

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:45.680
I can always count on it.

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:51.530
It lasts very well, and it's very durable
and gives me everything that I need out of

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:52.530
a grip.

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:56.250
Bob: Let's talk a little bit about grip sizing
because when I go on the tour treks, I see

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.500
a lot of manipulation, if you will.

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:01.780
I call them special needs players.

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:08.260
They want grips tapered properly, more tape,
less tape, real small, real big.

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:11.730
How often do you see that coming in, and do
you do that yourself?

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:17.510
Brendan: I actually do it very standard, just
one wrap of grip tape and the basic 58 Round

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:21.870
Crossline Cord, but I see guys that build
up the right hand.

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:23.250
I see guys that build up the left hand.

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:24.840
I see guys with five extra wraps.

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.410
You see guys with mid-size grips.

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:30.040
You see guys with all sorts of different things,
and I think it depends on the type of ball

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:32.830
flight that you want, how big your hands are.

00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:37.151
I like to hit draws, so I don't want to get
the grip to be too big, or else I'm going

00:01:37.151 --> 00:01:38.270
to have trouble releasing the club.

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:39.270
Bob: Correct.

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:42.210
Brendan: Have a little bit too much tension,
and have trouble getting the shot shape that

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:43.210
I want.

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:45.150
So that's very individual, as well.

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:48.500
Some guys that, maybe, don't want to hit draws
might build up the right hand or put an extra

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:52.270
wrap or two under there as well, so that can
be very individual with everybody.

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:53.270
Bob: Right.

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:57.060
And what's important for people, I think,
to take away from this aspect of our conversation

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:02.500
is that tour players really pay attention
to the grips, and they think it is actually

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:07.060
a fundamental aspect of them playing golf
at such a high level.

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:08.060
Brendan: Yeah.

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:09.060
It's a huge factor for us.

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:13.640
I mean, we're very particular about everything
that we do, and grips are no different.

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:18.380
Everybody's got their own individual style
and things that they like, and that's really

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:19.510
the way it should be.

00:02:19.510 --> 00:02:22.770
It's no different for any amateur of any level.

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:28.140
You should find something that you can have
a nice, comfortable feel, be able to reduce

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.230
tension, but still have control of the club
and something that you like the feel of in

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:42.780
your hand.
