00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.959
In this video, we'll demonstrate how to assemble the Tusk SubZero UTV push tube

00:00:04.959 --> 00:00:07.679
and plow blade and then attach it to your machine.

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:12.400
You can refer to our plow mount installation videos for instructions on

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.180
attaching the mount to your specific machine.

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:19.900
The push tube and blade come in two separate boxes as you can see.

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:21.820
We're first going to unbox the push tube.

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:27.720
So just cut the straps and tape holding the box together. Go ahead and open the box up.

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:33.150
Inside, you'll find everything has been wrapped and zip tied together, so just start removing items from the box.

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:34.940
First we'll remove the hardware.

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:36.660
Go ahead and set that aside.

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.540
And next, we'll need to cut the zip ties in order to remove the blade angle bracket.

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.360
Go ahead and remove that from the bubble wrap. Set that aside as well.

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:48.060
Then we'll remove the push pivot from the box.

00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:51.220
Pull that from the bubble wrap, and we'll set that aside.

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:56.220
Now you can pull the push tube from the box, and you'll find that the springs

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:00.000
and eye bolts are zip tied to that, so cut those and remove the springs.

00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:04.580
Now you'll want to cut the hardware bag open.

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:07.960
You'll find all the hardware has been assembled and packaged together.

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:13.180
This helps keep the confusion away about which piece goes where.

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:16.160
So, just lay it out and make sure you have all the pieces.

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.960
Now we're ready to begin assembling the push tube.

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.580
We'll just need a few standard tools to do this.

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:25.420
You'll find a list of these on your provided instructions with the plow system.

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:30.920
So with the push tube sitting on a flat surface, position the push pivot onto the push tube,

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:33.020
making sure to line up the two holes in each piece.

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:38.860
Next, we're going to sit the blade angle bracket, as shown, on top of the push pivot and push tube.

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:43.060
Make sure the pin slides into the holes in the push pivot and push tube.

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:47.760
Next, find the M16x40 mm bolt with the spacer on it.

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:51.920
Disassemble it, and we need to position the spacer between the blade angle bracket and

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:53.680
the push tube as shown.

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:59.960
Slide the M16x40 mm bolt down through all three pieces, then slide the washer and

00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.600
thread the knot onto the back side.

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.500
We're going to leave this loose for now.

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:07.220
Next find the other M16x40 mm bolt.

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.920
This one won't have a spacer on it, and this bolt is going to come up from the bottom,

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:13.360
through the front of the push tube,

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:18.250
and then through the push pivot plate, through the flat washer and into the nyloc nut.

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.120
Now that we've got both bolts in place, we can tighten them down.

00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.860
The front bolt needs to be tightened down all the way, and then backed off a half a turn.

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.380
Doing this will allow the blade to pivot properly.

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.400
On the rear bolt, we can just tighten it down all the way and leave it there.

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.460
Next, we're going to open up the blade box.

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:44.880
Cut the straps and tape and then open it up.

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:51.940
Go ahead and remove the blade, and underneath the blade don't forget to grab the small box.

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.580
This small box contains both the plow blade skids.

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:06.020
Next just line the plow blade with the push tube, and we're going to install the four-way tilt stops.

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:11.520
These will sit in the upper holes of the push pivot, so just remove the nut and flat washer

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.400
and slide the bolt through the hole with the tilt stop on the bolt.

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:19.240
Then just slide the flat washer and thread the nut on the back side.

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.720
Now we can just go ahead and tighten this down.

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:26.160
You want to leave this just loose enough to where you can still turn the tilt stop.

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:29.420
And then just repeat these steps for the other side.

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:33.900
Go ahead and install the four-way tilt stop, and then tighten it down just enough.

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:39.720
Make sure they're both sitting in the same position and we'll be adjusting these a little later.

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:44.019
The next step is to align the two holes in the front of the push pivot up with the two

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:46.219
corresponding holes in the blade.

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:51.180
When you've got that, locate the M12x35 mm bolts that have the small collar

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:52.690
on them like you see here.

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:58.440
Remove the nut, flat washer and collar and then install the bolt through the blade and

00:03:58.440 --> 00:03:59.700
then through the push pivot.

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:02.880
Now you want to slide that collar onto the bolt and into place.

00:04:02.980 --> 00:04:07.580
This is going to slide into the larger diameter hole in the push pivot and act as a bushing.

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:09.940
Now install the flat washer and lock nut.

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:12.540
Then we're going to repeat these steps for the other side.

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:16.760
Slide the bolt through and then slide that collar into place.

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:21.040
Now install the flat washer and thread the lock nut onto the back side.

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:24.380
We're going to tighten both these bolts down all the way.

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:30.080
Go ahead and sit the blade up and we can install the eye bolts and springs.

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:34.880
Slide an eye bolt through each bracket on the plow and then slide on a washer and thread

00:04:34.889 --> 00:04:36.529
a nut onto each of those.

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:41.380
Next, install the springs and it's important to install them with the open end facing down.

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:46.300
And you want to tighten the lock nut down just enough so the spring doesn't come unhooked,

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:50.740
but at this point we still want the springs loose as we'll be adjusting them later in the video.

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:54.480
Repeat these steps for the other spring and eye-bolt.

00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:00.300
The next step is to install both gravel skids, so pull the lock pin and then remove everything

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:01.870
except for one washer.

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:05.400
Slide it through the bracket on the plow and then install another washer, 

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:07.020
and then the rubber spacer,

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:13.960
and after that, install the rest of the washers and secure them in place with the lock pin.

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:18.520
Repeat these steps for the other skid, and we'll show you how to adjust these a little

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:19.490
later in the video.

00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:24.400
So now that the blade and push tube have been assembled, we're ready to attach it to the machine.

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:28.740
So pull the machine up to where the plow mount is sitting over the rear end of the push tube,

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:32.880
then grab the provided lock pins and the lift the rear end of the push tube up into the

00:05:32.889 --> 00:05:34.129
ears of the plow mount.

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:39.240
Slide the straight pin through the mount and push tube and then secure it by installing the hair pin

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:41.680
through the small hole in the end of the straight pin.

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:46.280
Repeat these steps for the other side, and now your plow is attached to the machine.

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:51.020
Now, we need to connect the winch to the winch pin on the snow plow.

00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:55.139
You'll see that there are three different locations in which the winch pin can be located,

00:05:55.139 --> 00:05:58.539
and you want to pick the location that's the most vertical from the winch.

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:00.760
So in this case, we'll pick the rear most hole.

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:03.800
So go ahead and give the winch hook some slack to work with,

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:07.100
and then we'll move the winch pin to the desired hole if needed.

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:13.920
When you have that in place, connect the winch hook to the pin, then you'll want to go ahead and test it out.

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:18.260
Lift the blade up and down a couple times to make sure everything is functioning properly.

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:23.100
Now we can make our final adjustments to the four-way tilt stops.

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:27.199
By rotating the four-way tilt stop, it'll change the angle of the blade depending on

00:06:27.199 --> 00:06:29.119
which side is resting against the blade.

00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:34.380
Let's go ahead and rotate each tilt stop into the desired position and then tighten both of them down.

00:06:35.560 --> 00:06:37.800
After that, we can move to the springs.

00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:41.560
Now that our stops are in position, we can tighten the eye-bolts until we have a little

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:43.290
tension on each spring.

00:06:44.680 --> 00:06:49.060
It's important to make sure both springs have the same amount of tension on them.

00:06:50.380 --> 00:06:52.700
Now we'll move back to our skids once again.

00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:56.600
If you're going to be plowing on gravel or dirt, you're going to want the skids touching

00:06:56.610 --> 00:06:58.270
the ground before the blade does.

00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:02.540
So to make that adjustment, simply lift the blade up off the ground and we placed a block

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:04.770
of wood underneath so we can remove the skid.

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:09.800
Now we'll reinstall the rubber spacer and all but one washer back onto the skid before

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:11.840
reinstalling it onto the blade.

00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:17.180
Now, install that last washer on top followed by the lock pin,

00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:19.820
and then we'll just repeat that for the other side.

00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:24.660
And now you can see that those skids keep the bottom of the blade up off the ground.

00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:30.700
If you're plowing concrete or blacktop, you want the skids raised so that the blade is touching the ground.

00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:35.660
And then with the plow slightly raised, we'll show you how to change the angle of the blade.

00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:40.100
Simply pull up on the L bracket and rotate the blade to the desired position

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:41.820
and now you're ready to plow.

00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:47.020
