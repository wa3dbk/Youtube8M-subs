00:00:03.703 --> 00:00:04.583
Dogs in carts

00:00:05.016 --> 00:00:07.096
really weird thing about Japan

00:00:21.733 --> 00:00:24.933
Let's talk about bikes and biking in Tokyo today

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:31.460
It's hard for me to say if Tokyo is a bike-friendly city or not

00:00:31.461 --> 00:00:35.361
There's a lot of attempts to make dedicated spots for bikes

00:00:35.944 --> 00:00:38.024
Like dedicated biking lanes or

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.240
dedicated space on the sidewalk

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:43.640
but it doesn't really get respected

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:45.825
You'll have like a bike lane that goes for a street

00:00:45.825 --> 00:00:47.454
and then the next street has nothing

00:00:47.454 --> 00:00:49.674
This street seems to be bike-friendly

00:00:49.674 --> 00:00:53.345
and then the next street over there has nothing marked off for bicycles

00:00:53.345 --> 00:00:55.807
The continuity doesn't really add up here

00:00:59.463 --> 00:01:01.143
So what ends up happening

00:01:01.143 --> 00:01:04.535
is you basically just share the road with the drivers

00:01:04.535 --> 00:01:05.764
and it's totally cool

00:01:05.764 --> 00:01:07.022
The drivers are really good about it

00:01:07.208 --> 00:01:09.208
They watch out for bicyclists

00:01:09.208 --> 00:01:12.668
Cars have to watch out for bicyclists and bicyclists have to watch out for pedestrians

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.120
These are all illegally parked bikes

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:21.580
Parking your bike anywhere on the street in an unmarked place

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:23.799
is considered illegal bike parking

00:01:23.879 --> 00:01:26.359
Probably because Tokyo is so crowded

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.920
or maybe just to institute some kind of infrastructure

00:01:30.924 --> 00:01:33.769
This behind me is what dedicated bike parking looks like

00:01:33.769 --> 00:01:36.481
And unfortunately, there just aren't enough around the city

00:01:36.481 --> 00:01:39.057
So you end up with a lot of illegally parked bicycles

00:01:39.057 --> 00:01:42.824
The nearest one to my apartment, for example, that I can think of

00:01:42.824 --> 00:01:43.780
is this one

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:46.780
And it's about 15 minutes away by foot so...

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:51.317
In comparison to Chicago, I would say there are a lot of bicyclists here

00:01:51.317 --> 00:01:54.450
It's a very convenient way to get around the city

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.564
because cars are not so convenient here and expensive

00:01:57.564 --> 00:01:59.957
and you have a good transportation system

00:01:59.957 --> 00:02:02.266
but if you want to get a short distance, bikes are really convenient

00:02:02.266 --> 00:02:04.885
And because drivers are used to bicyclists here

00:02:04.885 --> 00:02:09.520
I don't mind the system, I trust drivers, I trust that they won't hit me

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.320
No one really drives super fast here

00:02:11.325 --> 00:02:13.725
and I'd say it's pretty comfortable

00:02:17.074 --> 00:02:19.954
Kris had to stay behind to do his Polish show

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:25.180
but I am running off to Shinjuku to meet some viewers

00:02:25.471 --> 00:02:28.511
They're from Alaska which is really exciting

00:02:28.511 --> 00:02:31.298
I've only met two people from Alaska in my life

00:02:31.298 --> 00:02:32.965
So I'm pretty excited to meet them

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:35.180
Oh, illegally parked bikes

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:37.600
It's in Japan now

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.280
Hello!

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.680
So let's head off to the bar

00:02:56.136 --> 00:02:58.696
Finally made it out to see the Godzilla

00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:00.655
We're going to a bar

00:03:00.655 --> 00:03:01.975
an izakaya sort of bar

00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:05.920
that's gotten popular for being super cheap

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:07.580
There are beers for 100 yen

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.200
which you never find in Japan

00:03:09.208 --> 00:03:10.621
Cheapest is usually about 300 yen

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:14.560
And there isn't even a seating charge

00:03:14.565 --> 00:03:16.358
So we're going to check it out

00:03:16.358 --> 00:03:17.358
Cheers!

00:03:17.559 --> 00:03:19.799
I am basically out of this episode

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:21.319
because I have to edit

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:22.480
A lot

00:03:26.809 --> 00:03:30.489
I like these aquarium scenes from yesterday's episode

00:03:31.701 --> 00:03:33.621
Ok, I'm going to join them now

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:46.780
I was supposed to go to Shinjuku station, but I got off in Shin-Okubo

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:48.432
which is one station later

00:03:48.626 --> 00:03:52.506
Shin-Okubo in itself, it's the Korean district in Tokyo

00:03:52.506 --> 00:03:54.740
Did I mention I was going to Seoul?

00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:56.460
I don't even remember

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:58.447
I'm going to Korea on Saturday

00:03:58.447 --> 00:04:00.338
Kasia's going to be staying in Tokyo

00:04:00.448 --> 00:04:03.888
so we'll be daily vlogging from two cities at the same time

00:04:04.020 --> 00:04:05.775
It's pretty exciting

00:04:05.775 --> 00:04:07.575
And I'm also looking for people to meet

00:04:07.575 --> 00:04:10.175
So if you live in Seoul or know people in Seoul

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:14.312
or know YouTubers in Seoul who'd like to meet me

00:04:14.312 --> 00:04:17.361
Please let me know, let them know, I dunno, do your  thing

00:04:17.361 --> 00:04:18.800
Make it happen

00:04:19.929 --> 00:04:25.849
This building over there is one of my favorite threatening architecture pieces in Tokyo

00:04:25.849 --> 00:04:29.180
It just screams 'We're an evil corporation.'

00:04:29.194 --> 00:04:31.434
They even took care of the red glow

00:04:34.763 --> 00:04:36.363
I guess this is the place

00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:46.200
We found Kris's doppelganger

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:49.840
Freakin twins

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:52.840
He's a good-looking guy

00:04:59.932 --> 00:05:02.252
So I met up with these four behind me

00:05:03.357 --> 00:05:05.037
And you guys are from...?

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:06.920
Alaska

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:08.320
Alaska

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:11.580
That's where they're from in Alaska

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:12.520
Anchorage

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:15.429
Take a look at a map of Alaska to understand this

00:05:15.953 --> 00:05:16.773
I'm Jaime

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:17.660
I'm Seth

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:19.083
And they're both native

00:05:19.083 --> 00:05:21.218
And by native, that means native what?

00:05:21.218 --> 00:05:22.951
I'm Yupik Eskimo/Native Alaskan

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:25.500
And they see moose all the time

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:26.780
All the time

00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:29.050
They steal pumpkins on Halloween

00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:32.940
And if you drive badly you can decapitate a moose

00:05:33.460 --> 00:05:34.940
into your car

00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:36.620
It does happen

00:05:36.776 --> 00:05:39.576
Is Sarah Palin representative of Alaska?

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:41.400
Nooo

00:05:43.815 --> 00:05:46.535
She is a fantastic conversation starter

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:49.680
Bam

00:05:51.511 --> 00:05:52.951
Alaskan Salmon booze

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:54.640
Pretty cool

00:06:05.563 --> 00:06:07.643
We just said bye to the Alaskans

00:06:07.643 --> 00:06:10.105
Now we're trying to make it for the train

00:06:11.779 --> 00:06:13.779
It's hard to run in flip-flops
