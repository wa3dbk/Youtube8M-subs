00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:29.196
WELCOME

00:00:29.296 --> 00:00:31.164
Tell me when to sit, okay?

00:00:31.198 --> 00:00:33.200
-Whenever you want to.
-No...

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.335
-I'll sit...
-You may sit.

00:00:35.369 --> 00:00:37.137
-May I?
-It's rolling.

00:00:37.171 --> 00:00:38.372
It's rolling.

00:00:39.339 --> 00:00:41.175
-It's rolling.
-Rolling Stones.

00:00:43.944 --> 00:00:46.980
Did you know that since I started
Pilates I have no more rheumatism?

00:00:47.014 --> 00:00:48.015
It's nice, right?

00:00:49.316 --> 00:00:52.686
-When did you come to Brazil?
-In 1953.

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:56.723
When Evita passed away.
She died and we left.

00:00:56.757 --> 00:00:59.826
Very fast, because my father
was against Peron.

00:00:59.893 --> 00:01:01.528
My father was a Socialist

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:05.265
and they had burnt
"The House of Commons".

00:01:06.133 --> 00:01:07.935
-Then my father...
-What was "The House of Commons"?

00:01:08.001 --> 00:01:10.537
It was the place of Socialism,
they called it...

00:01:10.571 --> 00:01:12.039
"The House of Commons".

00:01:12.139 --> 00:01:14.641
My father said: "I won't
stay here anymore".

00:01:14.942 --> 00:01:18.078
Because they used to come
to my house, it was fascism,

00:01:19.646 --> 00:01:24.718
they used to write on the sidewalk:
"Peron makes it, Evita purifies it".

00:01:24.918 --> 00:01:28.655
It was a fascist quote.
Cutting to the end: we left.

00:01:28.689 --> 00:01:29.990
But why Brazil?

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.393
Because my father knew a man
who own some money to him.

00:01:33.827 --> 00:01:35.796
So he came after the debt.

00:01:36.997 --> 00:01:39.099
BRAZILIAN FEMINISM

00:01:39.132 --> 00:01:41.835
We had a smuggler
to take us.

00:01:42.269 --> 00:01:45.005
I remember that,
and I was only five years old.

00:01:45.372 --> 00:01:47.608
My brother was a baby,
he was with our governess,

00:01:47.641 --> 00:01:49.042
because it was fancy.

00:01:49.276 --> 00:01:51.411
We were running away
with a governess and all.

00:01:52.913 --> 00:01:54.515
We tried to cross
during the night...

00:01:55.582 --> 00:01:57.651
On the border,
they caught us.

00:01:58.185 --> 00:02:01.488
Then, my governess said:
"This baby is too young,

00:02:01.522 --> 00:02:06.527
I'm Swiss. I'll take care of him",
then she went to Switzerland.

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:10.364
We both, my mother and I
were on a refugee camp.

00:02:10.697 --> 00:02:15.669
We've stayed there for six months
and my father had to go back to Italy

00:02:15.736 --> 00:02:17.371
with the Carabineer.

00:02:17.738 --> 00:02:22.576
But the Italian Carabineers were
different from the Swiss', German's, etc.

00:02:22.643 --> 00:02:27.915
"You have such a great family.
Run away, run away, run away."

00:02:28.215 --> 00:02:30.617
What did he do?
He ran away,

00:02:30.817 --> 00:02:34.788
and stayed hidden on the fields
and then went hiding

00:02:34.888 --> 00:02:39.860
in a Jew's house
who was a friend of his.

00:02:40.427 --> 00:02:45.899
He spent six months
locked on the attic.

00:02:46.533 --> 00:02:49.336
-That was how things were.
-It was, you know?

00:02:49.403 --> 00:02:53.507
My mother, on the refugee camp,
to solve the problem,

00:02:53.574 --> 00:02:58.145
in the end, she was able
to get some papers for us

00:02:58.645 --> 00:03:01.215
and we were going to Argentina,
then my mother said:

00:03:01.615 --> 00:03:04.718
"You know what? Argentine embassies
are really tough,

00:03:04.785 --> 00:03:08.689
and Brazilian people are all...
'everything is fine. Let's go'.

00:03:08.722 --> 00:03:10.123
We're going to Brazil."

00:03:10.157 --> 00:03:12.292
Peron studied with Mussolini
for three years.

00:03:12.726 --> 00:03:14.895
He went studying with Mussolini

00:03:15.195 --> 00:03:18.031
then he brought all the “wonders”
back to Buenos Aires.

00:03:18.098 --> 00:03:21.535
So, I don't want to talk about it,
because my father told me:

00:03:21.602 --> 00:03:23.003
"Do you want to be happy?

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:26.273
So don't talk,
don't think about politics.

00:03:26.306 --> 00:03:29.776
It will always disappoint you."

00:03:29.977 --> 00:03:33.647
That's what I say.
Forget about politics.

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:34.815
Right.

00:03:35.148 --> 00:03:37.284
BRAZILIAN FEMINISM

00:03:37.317 --> 00:03:41.421
I had several chances
to return or to leave Brazil.

00:03:41.522 --> 00:03:43.790
We can't leave Brazil.
I can't.

00:03:43.857 --> 00:03:46.960
Because it's been generous
to us, you know?

00:03:46.994 --> 00:03:49.663
-Since the beginning.
-What a wonderful people.

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:53.667
I got to Rio de Janeiro
by ship,

00:03:53.700 --> 00:03:55.836
they called us five
in the morning to the deck,

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:59.540
there was a mist on...
I'm going to cry again.

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:03.310
It'll spoil my makeup.
There was a mist and I said:

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:05.779
"What are doing here?"
So I thought.

00:04:05.979 --> 00:04:10.184
Suddenly that mist disappeared

00:04:10.217 --> 00:04:15.189
and I could see Baia da Guanabara
without the earthwork.

00:04:15.255 --> 00:04:19.293
-All that green, that nature...
-That wonderful landscape.

00:04:19.326 --> 00:04:22.763
...that design was amazing.
So we...

00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:31.238
Oh, I loved it.

00:04:31.305 --> 00:04:35.409
I could see the Christ from my window.
I had raves.

00:04:35.943 --> 00:04:38.645
I used to see the Christ
doing exercises.

00:04:44.885 --> 00:04:47.254
BRAZILIAN FEMINISM

00:04:47.287 --> 00:04:50.157
Why do I believe that Brazil
was generous?

00:04:50.224 --> 00:04:52.559
Matarazzo had a...

00:04:53.694 --> 00:04:57.464
relative who knew my father
and called us.

00:04:57.498 --> 00:05:01.502
Soon after that, they found a job.
Everybody welcomed us.

00:05:01.568 --> 00:05:04.137
I didn't know what to speak.
I couldn't speak Italian,

00:05:04.171 --> 00:05:05.639
I didn't know Portuguese,

00:05:06.006 --> 00:05:09.142
I only could speak French at home
because no one could understand it...

00:05:11.011 --> 00:05:12.546
I was always quiet.

00:05:19.319 --> 00:05:22.890
Everyone welcomed us with arms wide
open, because they open their houses.

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:26.293
BRAZILIAN FEMINISM

00:05:26.360 --> 00:05:29.763
What I feel sad is that
such a generous country,

00:05:29.796 --> 00:05:33.367
such nice people
are so mismanaged,

00:05:33.433 --> 00:05:37.237
in such ignorant way.
They don't deserve it, you know?

00:05:37.304 --> 00:05:40.507
-Thank God...
-It's a pity, right?

00:05:40.541 --> 00:05:45.245
Trees are missing, so many things.
I'd paint everything...

00:05:45.312 --> 00:05:47.848
I go by the streets thinking:
"Oh, I'd do this."

00:05:47.915 --> 00:05:51.685
I'd love to work
for the city hall

00:05:52.152 --> 00:05:54.288
as a housewife
for Sao Paulo.

00:05:54.855 --> 00:05:56.456
I'd fix everything.

00:05:56.657 --> 00:06:00.627
I'm talking about the city,
something I could fix.

00:06:00.661 --> 00:06:03.463
-Not the politicians. They're a pity.
-I'm a little...

00:06:04.264 --> 00:06:09.570
sad to see that we still
didn't have the opportunity,

00:06:10.237 --> 00:06:14.141
while I'm alive,
while our generation is alive,

00:06:14.374 --> 00:06:17.744
to live the best that Brazil
deserves, you know?

00:06:17.811 --> 00:06:20.848
Other countries had that,
but our history is too short.

00:06:20.881 --> 00:06:22.749
-Yes.
-No one knows our history.

00:06:22.783 --> 00:06:26.787
Now three or four have written
about Brazilian History,

00:06:26.854 --> 00:06:30.858
and there is so much to be discovered
and no one knows.

00:06:30.891 --> 00:06:33.927
I get angry when I think
about the injustice

00:06:33.961 --> 00:06:38.699
of not taking advantage
of the modern world for we have

00:06:39.099 --> 00:06:42.236
some amazing characteristics
to be used,

00:06:42.269 --> 00:06:44.671
because Brazil is modern,
you know?

00:06:44.972 --> 00:06:49.743
And there are such competent people
in some areas, you know?

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:52.312
But they can't move
all the rest.

00:06:52.679 --> 00:06:53.947
It will take some time.

00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:12.266
Now they want us
to relax.

00:07:12.332 --> 00:07:14.835
-Can I take my shoes off?
-You can. You can.

00:07:14.968 --> 00:07:17.037
-Such beautiful shoes.
-Indeed, but I'll leave them here

00:07:17.104 --> 00:07:20.174
so everyone could see them.
Done.

00:07:20.307 --> 00:07:22.509
I'm great.
I love this couch.

00:07:22.676 --> 00:07:25.112
-By the way, it's a nice couch.
-What?

00:07:25.212 --> 00:07:28.081
-Does it fit in my house?
-No. It's beautiful.
