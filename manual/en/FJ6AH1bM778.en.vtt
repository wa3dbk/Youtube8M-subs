MICHAEL BAY: (cutting him off) 
Do you have any experience?

00:00:45.962 --> 00:00:47.962
DANIEL RADCLIFFE (confused): In... acting? 

00:00:47.756 --> 00:00:48.756
MICHAEL BAY: Yes. 

00:00:48.799 --> 00:00:55.299
DANIEL RADCLIFFE: Well... I’ve been starring in theater and films for over 
 ten years, the largest of course being the Harry Potter series.

00:00:54.847 --> 00:00:58.847
MICHAEL BAY: Oh, you were in those, ah, 
 wizard movies?  Who did you play?

00:00:58.434 --> 00:01:01.434
DANIEL RADCLIFFE (baffled): I was, uh, Harry Potter sir.

00:01:01.812 --> 00:01:10.812
MICHAEL BAY: You may not know this about me son, but I don’t appreciate 
 people lying to me, and I don’t have a sense of humor. 

00:01:10.529 --> 00:01:18.529
DANIEL RADCLIFFE (Very confused): Ah, no sir, I was Harry Potter. 
 I’m Daniel Radcliffe and I played Harry Potter.

STEFANIE (from other room): Sorry Sir!

00:01:30.257 --> 00:01:32.257
DANIEL RADCLIFFE: It’s... Daniel, sir...

00:01:31.216 --> 00:01:35.716
MICHAEL BAY: I guess Harry here threw us both 
 off since he showed up late. 

00:01:35.262 --> 00:01:37.262
DANIEL RADCLIFFE: My name’s not Harry.

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:46.430
MICHAEL BAY: Anyway Harry, there aren’t any wizard or sorcery-related parts in this script, 
 so it may not work 
out for us on this one. Harry.

00:01:45.064 --> 00:01:59.060
DANIEL RADCLIFFE: It’s Daniel, and I’ve played other 
characters before.  I’m not Harry Potter, I just played him in the movies.  I 
 can play other roles as well, I’m a trained actor and I’ve performed a lot of different roles in theater and film, I've...

00:01:57.534 --> 00:01:59.530
MICHAEL BAY: Here, hold these. 

00:01:59.536 --> 00:02:03.540

00:02:04.249 --> 00:02:07.250
