00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Greetings and welcome to this Skyrim tutorial.
My name is Tera, and I will be your hostess.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:37.000
In this tutorial you will learn how to extract BSA files
and modify the color and intensity of NIF files of the game.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.000
For this, you will need the programs FO3 Archive Utility
and NifSkope.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Check the video description for the download links.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Let's start by extracting the mod made by Xanshio
in the Data folder.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.000
See the procedure.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
The Xanshio's mod presents NIF files in different
folders.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
One for the NIF files related to the Daedric
Armor parts...

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000
and other for NIF files related to its weapons.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.000
In game, we can view the Daedric Armor parts
with the new glow.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Let's now modify the color and intensity of
the glow of the Daedric Armor male torso.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
To do this, we will use the NifSkope.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:49.000
The following steps are optional and are made
to better visualize the tridimentional object.

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:42.000
To view the textures in the tridimentional object,
is necessary that you have textures related to
that object in subfolders of the Data folder.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:09.000
Let's now find the block related to the glowing
details in the Block List (a NiTriShape)...

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.000
and select the property BSEffectShaderProperty.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:23.000
Locate and modify the Emissive Color and
Emissive Multiple parameters in the Block Details.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:29.000
The new glow color will be green and
its intensity will be thrice stronger.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
Finally, we save the changes.

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000
Ingame, we can see the new changes.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:07.000
But, what if we wanted to modify a NIF file that is not
part of the Xanshio's mod? Like the Daedric Greatsword?

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:16.000
To get the NIF file related to the Daedric
Greatsword, we use FO3 Archive Utility.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:26.000
With the FO3 Archive Utility, we open the
BSA file that stores all NIF files of the game.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:33.000
Then, we locate and extract the NIF file of
the Daedric Greatsword on the Desktop.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:00.000
Note that the NIF file extracted does not appear
directly on the Desktop.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:08.000
But within a set of folders, identical to
the folders of Xanshio's mod.

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.000
We put this set of folders on the
Data folder of the game.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:29.000
The NIF file of the Daedric Greatsword is together
with NIF the files of Xanshio's mod related to weapons.

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:46.000
The procedure for changing the glow of the
Daedric Greatsword is the same as seen before.

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:30.000
Ingame, we see the Daedric Greatsword with
the new glow color and intensity.

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:40.000
Remember that some objects have two NIF files:
one for each edge of the Weight.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000
The Daedric Armor male torso is an example.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:52.000
With this, we end this tutorial.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000
I hope you have learned everything.

00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.000
Thanks for watching and until next time! ;D
