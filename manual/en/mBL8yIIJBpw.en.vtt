war enough get the air we gone go ahead
and

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:47.490
sample who a base no of this piano

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.600
lektor PL who but I wouldn't use that

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:54.280
d no my here mogayon love is the No

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:56.240
not one yums

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.509
know what I like to do is sample nice
long known because it gives me more

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:01.390
control

00:02:01.390 --> 00:02:05.479
over might be okay mu

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:12.479
I'm Sony here we go sampling human

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.310
okay so bad now have you watched my
other videos on base my eyes

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:23.160
you know it you lose dave is a okay now
like I was saying before

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.340
let's go ahead an

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.700
burns too late the base no

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.989
on and 260 levels

00:02:32.989 --> 00:02:37.209
turn on I and in be sixty

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:41.380
knows to choose from however says we're
using a scale

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:44.780
we're gonna use 1234 my

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:49.569
789 90 nine pairs to choose from

00:02:49.569 --> 00:02:53.430
now in ski out it was aight reason why
there's nine is because

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:57.150
is not right here get the same no

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:00.450
