00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:43.959
fifth string

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:46.370
that becomes a [secord]

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:49.100
so

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:51.230
Third fret [string]

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:55.419
Maybe secord a couple times

00:03:58.460 --> 00:04:01.599
then to the [fifth] string [second] fret

00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:05.200
and the

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:07.370
second string third trip

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:10.240
Play that Chord

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.280
Actually what you do is you play thee?

00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:22.399
Pff string [sack] for a couple times and play the chords

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:29.599
So that part again [staring] [at] see is

00:04:33.750 --> 00:04:35.750
that

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:41.339
And the next chord [is] played like this fifth string

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:44.610
first fret

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:47.450
fourth string Third fret

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:50.480
gee open

00:04:51.650 --> 00:04:57.199
second string third fret like that and the [bottle] string open

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:04.749
Look at a few times is what five beats?

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:18.509
And slide keep it in the same structure, but slide it up two frets [like] [that]

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:24.860
so that part again to play like

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:37.430
Let's start at the [very] beginning and the whole thing over again

00:05:38.970 --> 00:05:45.230
Except when you get to see play the third fret fifth string

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:56.200
Instead of going to the G chord like that stead of going there you play regular G chord like this

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:00.550
Chuckles dance

00:06:04.030 --> 00:06:06.390
Then you go to the third

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:09.930
Third fret top string

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:12.890
some alone

00:06:13.419 --> 00:06:15.419
six string open

00:06:19.780 --> 00:06:21.780
fifth string second fret

00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:25.780
fourth string

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:28.180
second fret

00:06:28.750 --> 00:06:30.750
fourth string open

00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:34.410
then D Chord

00:06:35.910 --> 00:06:37.910
Stremme on a couple things

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:41.919
then to a G chord couple times

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:48.989
So you play that three times like this?

00:06:55.889 --> 00:06:57.889
once

00:07:05.710 --> 00:07:07.710
the third time

00:07:07.940 --> 00:07:12.579
You play just the D instead of going d g and?

00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:16.449
then the vocal line comes in

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:21.200
And that's pretty much it for the intro

00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:24.589
