Hi everyone. My name is Glenda with Sure-Fit Designs. The purpose of this

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:18.850
video is to talk about the lady who's
got the large buttocks or often referred

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:24.610
to as a large derriere. With that kind of
a body frame you obviously need to

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:28.660
distribute more of your fabric towards
the back of your body than you do to the

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:33.640
front, particularly when you are working
with a pants pattern, so I'm going to

00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:38.290
show you how easy that is to do with
Sure-Fit Designs. First of all let's take

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:41.980
a look at this illustration so you can
see the kind of frame that I'm talking

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:47.710
about. The first figure is what I've
called normal, where there is a fairly

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:52.180
even distribution between the front and
the back of the body, but the second

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:58.450
illustration is with the larger derriere
and obviously there is more fabric

00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:03.370
needed to go around the back body than
there is on the front and so with the

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:09.189
Sure-Fit Designs pants pattern that's
very, very easy to do. First of all you

00:01:09.189 --> 00:01:16.149
will have taken a low or a full hip
measurement and ladies you must be very

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:20.950
honest about this measurement. You do
need to get the largest circumference

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:26.770
possible, so measure yourself two or
three times in your low hip area and take

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:32.859
the largest measurement. Then when you
apply that measurement onto the Sure-Fit

00:01:32.859 --> 00:01:37.420
Designs master pattern, when you have
finished drawing off the front and the

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:41.799
back pattern, when you add them together
and double them of course for the entire

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:47.229
circumference, you're going to end up
with approximately two inches of ease. So

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:52.179
that should be plenty to go around your
body, but we do know with the large

00:01:52.179 --> 00:01:56.939
derriere we want to give more of that
circumference and ease to the back body.

00:01:56.939 --> 00:02:02.289
So what you will do is in the pants
pattern when you're drawing it off,

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:07.749
instead of using whatever your hip
measurement number is, you'll go one

00:02:07.749 --> 00:02:12.520
dot larger in the back and one dot
larger or smaller in the front. As an

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:18.400
example let's say that you're 42 inches
around in your hip line when you

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.450
draw off your pattern it should
measure 44 which gives you your two

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:24.670
inches of ease and you can always
double-check that.

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:31.000
Now for the large derriere or large
buttocks in the back please use the

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.459
forty three dot and in the front use the
forty one. When you add those two

00:02:36.459 --> 00:02:40.269
together, divide them in half you still
end up with forty two and the same

00:02:40.269 --> 00:02:45.099
amount of ease, but you've distributed
more of that fabric to the back of the

00:02:45.099 --> 00:02:51.250
pattern. And then I do want you to do a
test pair of pants to make sure and see

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:56.409
how that is fitting on your body. Now
once you've got that on, the next thing

00:02:56.409 --> 00:03:01.359
that you want to take a look at is how
is that crotch feeling within my body?

00:03:01.359 --> 00:03:05.530
Because there's one other refinement or
minor tune-up that you may need to do.

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:11.730
One of the measurements that you needed
to take was a full straddle measurement

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:16.810
like this, and you measure from the
center front of your waistline around

00:03:16.810 --> 00:03:20.650
through your crotch up to the bottom of
the waistband in the back of your body,

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:26.379
but when you don't have pants on that
sometimes doesn't come out completely

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:33.190
accurate and that's why you need to now
check this in your test pair of pants. I

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:37.480
want you to walk around the house. I want
you to sit down, I want you to stand up

00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:42.430
and just do some normal movements and
see if that crotch line is feeling good

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:47.079
because remember, we're dealing with the
large buttocks or derriere situation

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:54.220
right now. If you do need to add any more
length to the back crotch line this is a

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:59.859
very very simple way to do it. You are
going to be drawing a line that is

00:03:59.859 --> 00:04:04.060
perpendicular to the straight of grain
and you're going to draw that

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:08.560
approximately where your fullest low hip
is so that might be seven eight or nine

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:15.729
inches down. Then what you're going to do
is cut on that line from the center back

00:04:15.729 --> 00:04:21.940
through to the side seam, but you are
going to leave that as a hinge or a

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:27.760
pivotal point, so you then make one more
little cut through the seam allowance up

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:32.200
to the side seam but not all the way
through. Now for the sake of

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:38.500
demonstration, I have pre-cut this and so
now I'm just going to pretend like I am

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:42.660
cutting with a pair of scissors. I'm
going to cut all the way across to the

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:49.090
side seam but not all the way
through and then you simply are going to

00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:53.830
pivot, whoops I have a little piece of
tape there I'll just release - you're

00:04:53.830 --> 00:05:00.010
going to pivot the top portion of that
pants pattern open. Now how much you

00:05:00.010 --> 00:05:06.460
pivot that open will depend a lot on how
much more if you need this, how much

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:11.770
more sitting is you might need in the
crotch length of your of your back

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:16.990
crotch. So for this demonstration I've
opened it up about 3/4 to possibly one

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:23.320
inch there. And then what you're going to
do is back this opening with another

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:31.350
piece of tracing vellum because we now
need to tape it shut like this and then

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:37.420
reconnect at the center back and I'll
just use the Designing Stylus to do that.

00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:45.760
You are just going to do a gentle curve
here like this and you can actually do a

00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:52.420
little bit of shaping on that center
back in this fashion and that may give

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:57.910
you a little bit more of circumference
if you need it to go over that large

00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:02.920
derriere, but it definitely gives you
more length in your back crotch that you

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:08.890
may need for sitting purposes and at
the side seam here, of course, the more

00:06:08.890 --> 00:06:12.400
you pivot this open, the more you're
going to get a little divot there so you

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:18.490
will want to just true or blend in your
side seam like that and bring this

00:06:18.490 --> 00:06:24.130
seam allowance out as well and then you
will need to make one more test pair of

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:30.670
pants. Then of course once your test pair
of pants are done, again walk around, sit

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:35.890
down, stand up see how they feel because
you may in fact need to remove a little

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:41.050
bit of that or you might need to close
up your wedge a little bit . It just is

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:45.580
going to depend on your comfort level. So
that actually

00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:51.009
is a very very easy way to deal with the
large derriere by giving you more fabric

00:06:51.009 --> 00:06:56.379
to the back of your body than to the
front and making a center back slightly

00:06:56.379 --> 00:07:03.189
curved and perhaps a little bit longer
if you need it. So for this minor tune-up

00:07:03.189 --> 00:07:08.710
and for any other situations that might
be issues that you deal with in your

00:07:08.710 --> 00:07:12.879
pant pattern. Please make sure that you
