This week, Education Month

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:24.667
That's March 11th to the 17th,
or punching above your weight.

00:00:24.667 --> 00:00:27.867
President Obama:
Denmark is acountry that in American terms punches

00:00:27.867 --> 00:00:29.367
above its weight.

President Obama went to the EEOB

to address rising gas prices and
take questions from the media.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.567

the massive earthquake

00:00:40.333 --> 00:00:41.700
and tsunami there.

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.934
President Obama:
Today's events remind us of just how fragile life can be.

00:00:45.934 --> 00:00:48.834
Our hearts go out to our friends
in Japan and across the region

00:00:48.834 --> 00:00:51.233
and we're going to stand with
them as they recover and

00:00:51.233 --> 00:00:53.734
rebuild from this tragedy.

00:00:53.734 --> 00:00:55.567

Later that afternoon,
President Obama welcomed the

00:00:55.567 --> 00:01:00.300
Stanley Cup Champion Chicago
Blackhawks to the White House.

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:01.867
President Obama:
Where's the enforcer, come on?

00:01:01.867 --> 00:01:03.233
(laughter)

00:01:03.233 --> 00:01:08.867

visited servicemen and women at

00:01:11.633 --> 00:01:14.667
Walter Reed Hospital and held a
street hockey clinic with the

00:01:14.667 --> 00:01:16.533
First Lady on the south

00:01:16.533 --> 00:01:20.734
(laughter)

00:01:20.734 --> 00:01:23.133
On Monday, March
14th, the President visited

00:01:23.133 --> 00:01:25.600
Kenmore Middle School in
Arlington, Virginia, with

00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:28.633
Education Secretary Arne Duncan
to make a speech on education

00:01:28.633 --> 00:01:32.133
and discussed how to prepare
our kids for the 21st century.

00:01:32.133 --> 00:01:34.900
President Obama is urging reform
of No Child Left Behind by the

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:36.333
start of the new school year.

00:01:36.333 --> 00:01:38.867
He stressed that we must not
only leave no child behind,

00:01:38.867 --> 00:01:41.433
but also help every
student get ahead.

00:01:41.433 --> 00:01:43.567
President Obama:
That's why you've got
the gray hair like me.

00:01:43.567 --> 00:01:44.500
(laughter)

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.166
That's why you've
got the gray hair like me.

00:01:46.166 --> 00:01:48.800
The best economic
policy is one that

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:50.834
produces more college graduates.

00:01:50.834 --> 00:01:59.200
(applause)

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:02.033
And that's why for
the sake of our children and our

00:02:02.033 --> 00:02:05.767
economy and America's future,
we're going to have to do a

00:02:05.767 --> 00:02:09.734
better job educating every
single one of our

00:02:09.734 --> 00:02:11.166
sons and daughters.

00:02:11.166 --> 00:02:13.000

Renaissance by exploring
arts, poetry and music.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:30.867
got to keep going, Coltrane,
Miles Davis, Herbie Hancock,

00:02:30.867 --> 00:02:32.934

Back at the White House,
the President met with

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:40.734
Denmark's Prime Minister
Rasmussen to discuss the strong

00:02:40.734 --> 00:02:42.300
ties between the United States
and Denmark, the common global

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.867
challenges our two nations face,
including the situation in the

00:02:44.867 --> 00:02:48.734
Middle East and economic
and environmental issues.

00:02:48.734 --> 00:02:55.834
President Obama:
Of special importance has been our appreciation of the

00:02:55.834 --> 00:02:58.066
sacrifices that have
been made by Danish

00:02:58.066 --> 00:03:03.467
troops in Afghanistan and the
extraordinary leadership that

00:03:03.467 --> 00:03:07.166
Denmark has shown
as part of ISAF.

00:03:07.166 --> 00:03:10.133

On Tuesday, March 15th,
President Obama did several

00:03:10.133 --> 00:03:12.333
interviews with local television
stations from the map room of

00:03:12.333 --> 00:03:14.266
the White House on the
importance of education

00:03:14.266 --> 00:03:17.367
reform and the need to
fix No Child Left Behind.

00:03:17.367 --> 00:03:19.433
President Obama:
Investments in education
are an investment

00:03:19.433 --> 00:03:23.066
in our future, and I would
rather see us make cuts in some

00:03:23.066 --> 00:03:25.500
things that we don't need to
make sure that we're funding

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:26.367
the things that we do.

00:03:26.367 --> 00:03:28.767
And I think education is one of
those things that's going to be

00:03:28.767 --> 00:03:31.467
absolutely critical
for our future.

00:03:31.467 --> 00:03:33.834
Narrator:
The President also spoke
to ESPN in the library,

00:03:33.834 --> 00:03:36.667

give to those in need in Japan.

00:03:42.533 --> 00:03:45.000
President Obama:
One of the things that
I want to do on the

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.934
show was as people are filling
out their brackets, this is

00:03:47.934 --> 00:03:51.567
obviously a national past time,
we all have a great time, it's a

00:03:51.567 --> 00:03:54.433
great diversion, but I know a
lot of people are thinking how

00:03:54.433 --> 00:03:57.867
can they help the Japanese
people during this time of need.

00:03:57.867 --> 00:04:03.467

00:04:03.467 --> 00:04:06.967

00:04:45.166 --> 00:04:47.633
and deep ties between
our two nations.

00:04:47.633 --> 00:04:53.367
President Obama:
We obviously have the strongest possible relationship

00:04:53.367 --> 00:04:55.000
with Ireland.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:01.867
The warmth, the affection, the
familial and person-to-person

00:05:01.867 --> 00:05:06.567
contacts between our two
countries extend far beyond any,

00:05:06.567 --> 00:05:11.734
you know, dry policy issues.

00:05:11.734 --> 00:05:15.333
