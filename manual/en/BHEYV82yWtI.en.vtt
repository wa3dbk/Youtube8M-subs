00:00:01.341 --> 00:00:03.835
We've got a new item in our test this year.

00:00:16.544 --> 00:00:18.344
It's a Kia!

00:00:18.345 --> 00:00:26.307
There used to be a brand that taped the logos and then
asked people what brand they think the car is.

00:00:26.308 --> 00:00:32.094
To be honest, Kia's aren't the biggest or most exiting cars.

00:00:32.795 --> 00:00:35.321
At least this is a big car.

00:00:35.322 --> 00:00:40.914
To see if it's exciting you'll need to keep watching.
It's a like cliff-hanger.

00:00:45.027 --> 00:00:48.035
Exciting isn't the right word.

00:00:48.036 --> 00:00:55.928
Especially for this brand, I really like the looks.

00:00:55.929 --> 00:00:59.451
It stands for itself and certainly isn't anonymous.

00:00:59.452 --> 00:01:03.506
You may find that it's ugly,
something I don't find at all by the way.

00:01:03.507 --> 00:01:06.186
But it does stand out.

00:01:06.187 --> 00:01:08.032
I like that, it's fun.

00:01:08.033 --> 00:01:11.976
It isn't a boring block on wheels like the passat.

00:01:11.977 --> 00:01:14.170
It's got character.

00:01:14.171 --> 00:01:17.454
And this from a Korean car.

00:01:19.625 --> 00:01:21.858
It isn't real exiting to drive.

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:27.304
It's all fine but it isn't really inviting to go
and hit the gas.

00:01:27.305 --> 00:01:30.067
Especially the steering is kind of wierd.

00:01:30.102 --> 00:01:35.588
When the steering wheel is straight it's got some
sort of resistance as if the car has stalled.

00:01:35.589 --> 00:01:43.966
It turns out that they've adjusted this for the European market,
so if you're driving this car in the US it will be worse.

00:01:43.967 --> 00:01:47.470
On terms of handling it won't break any records either.

00:01:47.471 --> 00:01:51.101
It's a fine car, very average.

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:55.958
I'm driving the 1.7 CRDI.

00:01:56.023 --> 00:01:58.677
Or CDI, I'm not quite sure.
Anyway, it's a 1.7 litre diesel.

00:01:58.678 --> 00:02:01.226
This makes you think that it's
quite little for such a car.

00:02:01.227 --> 00:02:02.626
It isn't so bad.

00:02:02.627 --> 00:02:04.774
It's got 136 bhp.

00:02:05.746 --> 00:02:13.335
As long as don't have a cameraman behind you with a lot
more power, this car is just fine in normal traffic.

00:02:13.336 --> 00:02:22.184
Sometimes it falls back a little in first and second gear because
it limits the power in order to protect the mechanism.

00:02:23.469 --> 00:02:26.007
But it's fast enough.

00:02:26.008 --> 00:02:29.469
It's got 128 grams of CO2-emission per kilometre.

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:34.912
Which is sad for Kia, because this means it 
doesn't have tax reduction in The Netherlands...

00:02:34.913 --> 00:02:40.155
 ... and this fine car won't be 
interesting for people who lease.

00:02:41.801 --> 00:02:44.684
In the car there's quite a lot of space.

00:02:44.685 --> 00:02:48.119
It's the Korean Skoda Superb.

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:52.556
The people on the backseat have got enough space for their legs.

00:02:52.557 --> 00:03:00.231
But also in the front, and the headroom; there's
more than enough room.

00:03:00.232 --> 00:03:08.357
Used materials are fine up until this level, that's
also why the camera is aimed at this height.

00:03:08.358 --> 00:03:13.129
It's got a leather dashboard and
all materials up here feel fine.

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:21.270
But below that it becomes very hard, the handbrake
for instance, feels very rough and unpleasant.

00:03:23.681 --> 00:03:25.856
That's something the Korean's should improve.

00:03:25.857 --> 00:03:28.766
But on terms of equipment, wow!

00:03:28.767 --> 00:03:37.160
It's got navi, xenon lights, led lights for daytime, seat warming...

00:03:37.161 --> 00:03:40.553
... seat ventilation, standard in this class.

00:03:40.554 --> 00:03:43.134
You name it, it's got it.

00:03:43.135 --> 00:03:48.530
Even more so, there are only two options:
automatic or one with a roof window.

00:03:48.531 --> 00:03:58.902
The reason this car is so loaded is due to the
popularity of this car in the US and Korea.

00:03:58.903 --> 00:04:04.656
That's why they decided to only put the fully loaded
version on the European market.

00:04:06.210 --> 00:04:08.800
It costs 35.000 Euros.

00:04:08.801 --> 00:04:13.092
That's not cheap but it does bring you quite a lot.

00:04:13.093 --> 00:04:15.872
Both in space and goodies.

00:04:16.778 --> 00:04:18.372
That's is isn't it?
- Yes I think so.

00:04:27.137 --> 00:04:30.380
There's also a hybrid.

00:04:31.948 --> 00:04:37.980
There's also a hybrid with 190 bhp and tax reduction.

00:04:37.981 --> 00:04:42.725
But this car is also quite popular so it won't
reach the European market for another year.

00:04:47.801 --> 00:04:49.531
If I can bitch about something.

00:04:50.056 --> 00:04:54.625
The eco-batch on the back doesn't match the
classy outlook of this car.
