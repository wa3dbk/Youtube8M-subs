Hi I'm Greg from Cutting Edge Stencils
and I'd like to introduce our new line

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:15.940
of wall quote stencils. We've put
together a collection of phrases with a

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:20.680
positive message that can be used on
walls, on pillows, or even on canvas to

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:24.430
make your own artwork but no matter
where you use these, they're sure to

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:29.289
inspire creativity, to motivate you, and
to remind you of what's special. So what

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:34.239
are we waiting for? Let's go! Okay you got
a baby boy? We got a stencil for you. You

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:39.010
got a baby girl? We got one for her too.
I've got our clip on stencil level. This

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:42.879
is a great tool. This is going to help to
keep our phrase parallel with the

00:00:42.879 --> 00:00:46.480
ceiling parallel with the floor. just
looks very professional instead of

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:50.500
having yours your phrase crooked. What
we're going to do is we're going to

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:55.059
slide this on the bottom of the stencil
and what you do is you just take your

00:00:55.059 --> 00:01:00.280
level and you just slide it on the
bottom goes on very easy. Make sure it

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:05.019
sits tight against the stencil and now
what you're going to want to do is make

00:01:05.019 --> 00:01:08.710
sure that your bubble is between the two
black lines and that's going to tell you

00:01:08.710 --> 00:01:13.479
that your stencil is level. Okay we got
our stencil on the wall it's leveled I'm

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:17.470
going to put a couple more pieces of
tape just to make sure that the stencil

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:22.929
doesn't move when we roll it. Okay we got
our stencil on the wall we've got a

00:01:22.929 --> 00:01:26.560
level we check that with our Cutting
Edge Stencils clip-on stencil level and

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:30.880
now we're going to use three mini
rollers, three different colors and we're

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.569
going to do this project here the baby
boy project. We're going to start with

00:01:34.569 --> 00:01:39.160
this a folk art Heartland blue color and
we're going to do the brackets here. We

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:43.090
love these folk art paints the 
acrylics are dynamite. So first thing I'm

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:46.720
going to do is I'm going to take my mini
roller, we sell these at Cutting Edge

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:51.039
Stencils. They work great for projects
like this where you have a big enough

00:01:51.039 --> 00:01:54.700
area to roll stuff small enough where
you really need to get in with a brush

00:01:54.700 --> 00:02:00.459
it's not that detailed these are
dynamite. So what we'll do is we'll load

00:02:00.459 --> 00:02:05.729
our roller and again this is very
important evenly roll load your roller

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:09.970
we'll just run it through the paint nice
and even.

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:18.320
Get it equally distributed on the
surface of the roller and now what we'll

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:22.880
do is we'll offload it onto the paper
towels. So you come down to your paper

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:28.520
towels and just one or two passes you
can see how it offloads it with

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:32.660
different consistency so it gets a
little heavier in some areas so as we

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:37.130
offload this it evens out the load on
the roller. Now we have an even load on

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:41.330
the roller we're going to come up and
we're going to just get right on the

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:49.130
stencil and do our brackets in Heartland
Blue. Don't push too hard or you'll get

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:54.400
bleed just build up your paint coverage
slowly and see it doesn't take very long.

00:02:54.400 --> 00:03:00.020
Over here still have enough paint on my
roller. Again

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:04.870
don't push down too hard see the base on
that baby boy right now.

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:11.360
Okay let's paint the baby and guess what
color were using baby blue, perfect. Again

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:17.990
we're going to load a roller nice and
evenly. Come over again we're just going

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:24.130
to knock off the excess onto our paper
towel nice dry roller it's ready to go

00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:29.180
to the baby. You can see we're not using
spray adhesive here

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:32.530
and there's no problem at all.

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:43.160
Okay let's roll our boy and we're going
to use folk art slate blue for this

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:50.480
again run load our roller nice and even.
I'll float onto the paper towels. This is

00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:56.360
the standard couple passes there yeah
there you go you have nice dry roller

00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:07.490
ready to go. Get creative with this. You
can use all different colors, you can do

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:13.370
each letter in a different color.
See I'm not pushing too hard building it

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:20.690
up this is going to give me the best
tightest line. Okay we finished our

00:04:20.690 --> 00:04:26.780
project. Here we're going to pull this
down see how it looks. This took all of

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:33.530
about five minutes to complete. I think
everyone has five minutes for their baby

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:36.200
boy. This looks great!

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:46.460
