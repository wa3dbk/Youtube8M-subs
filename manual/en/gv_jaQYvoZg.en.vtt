00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.800
Your presence, oh Lord,

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.380
quites the unrest.

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.700
Your Holy Spirit also calms the storm.

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:45.760
Even though the sea will rage

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.560
You are my rock.

00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:52.420
In the midst of terror

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.540
only to You will I run.

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:08.420
You remain faithful.

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:22.440
You remain faithful.

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:40.440
You are almighty

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.020
and You rule over nations.

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:47.916
By Your great power

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.800
You bring freedom.

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:56.940
Lord come and show us Your way.

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:03.400
You are the only source of life and truth.

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:16.460
You remain faithful.

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:31.040
You remain faithful.

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:33.960
You will be with us

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:38.560
and You will not forsake us.

00:02:39.380 --> 00:02:42.480
Even though we may fall

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.940
and be wounded on our way

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:54.380
You will never abandon us.

00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:08.080
You remain faithful.

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:23.400
You remain faithful.
