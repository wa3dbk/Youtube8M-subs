00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:03.240
it's another beautiful day in Sydney

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.170
I'm out enjoying the Sun and looking to find out if anyone knows

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:09.000
Why the Sun shines?

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.660
So the sun gives us a lot of ... ?
- Heat? Sunshine?

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Provides energy (yes) heat energy

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:19.500
Where is the sun get that energy from?

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.700
I have no idea

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:25.000
Some kind of chemical reaction...

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.720
Mmmmmmmm...

00:00:27.430 --> 00:00:29.500
yeah gas explosions

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:30.500
Does it burn gas?

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.000
- It burns gases?
- It's burning air
- Fire

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.610
The fire that's on the sun

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:44.620
But is the Sun really a giant ball of
fire

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:48.280
I mean wouldn't go out after five
billion years?

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.970
This is one of the things that you just assume you know, but you don't actually know

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:55.000
So in this bucket I have the components
of the Sun

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:59.559
Well, I have protons and neutrons

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:02.870
There's some electrons but I didn't
bring them

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:06.190
Most of the Sun is actually protons
- OK

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:10.510
So what the protons does in the Sun
- It's dance together

00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:13.649
yeah

00:01:13.649 --> 00:01:15.000
Okay okay
Like this

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.000
When they come close, you know what they do?

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.640
They just ...
- Colide
Actually they bounce off each other

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:24.040
I'm coming in...
- UOOOOOOH

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:27.000
Why the protons bounce off each other?
- Something about the electrons ....

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.800
Positive and negative eletrons?

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:32.250
Cause they don't like each other
- They don't like each other

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.220
That's because a proton needs a neutron, right?

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:38.020
You know why they... they repel like that?

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.100
-Magnetic force?

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:43.220
The repelling magnetic type thing?

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:44.220
Magnetic field, uh?

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.200
-Electric field.

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:46.380
Positives and negatives.

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:47.540
Positive and Negative

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:49.420
It's to do with the positive negative, right?

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:50.800
We got protons, protons are?

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.360
*Positive*

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:53.600
-They're positively charged

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.480
-Yeah so the positives repel each other, ok?

00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:57.860
This is why its so important that the sun's hot

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:02.360
Cause if the sun is hot enough it gets these things moving so fast, that sometimes they can't avoid a collision

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:02.860
-ok

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:05.580
-And when they get too close they actually go *Pshh*

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:07.960
*Pshh*

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.300
*Pshh*

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:11.880
*Pshh*

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:23.440
-Smash the protons
-Positive?

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:26.120
-Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
No, no, no, sma... ahhh

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:30.080
and now they're stuck together and you saw what happened when they smashed together

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:33.230
What happened?
-They Leaked
-They Leaked

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.550
*Pshh*
is that energy?

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:36.400
-Yeah
-Sick

00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:38.540
Well the water poured out, but

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:40.380
I guess energy would have poured out then.

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:44.560
-The energy came out
-The energy came out! what was the energy before it was energy?

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:47.690
-Kinetic energy?
-Stored energy.

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:49.600
So what's happening there?

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:53.990
-It's releasing some mass... like lighting?
-Yeah, yeah, and that mass is, uh?

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:56.230
-It's converted as energy, yeah

00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:59.550
It was the mass of the proton
-(Ahhh!)

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.880
When the protons smashed together they got lighter!

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:03.820
-Yeah, yeah, yeah

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:05.840
And they lost that mass and the mass was converted energy

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:07.540
-Yeah, yeah
-You know the famous equation about that?

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:09.890
-(E = mc^2)
-Yeah!

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:11.820
E = mc^2?

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:13.030
?????
(French)

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:15.030
have your the famous
equation

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:17.780
-which? process proton makes energy?

00:03:17.780 --> 00:03:18.420
Well..

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.040
Ha ha ha ha

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:22.340
E = mc^2 squared? Yes?

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:24.100
So what's E?

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:26.280
The Sun, I don't know, ha ha ha

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.640
-E, E is energy, um

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:30.200
m is *mass*

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:31.200
C is..
-Cassidy

00:03:31.900 --> 00:03:32.400
Kelvin?

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:35.360
I don't remembers what C means...

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:37.400
So c is...

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:38.900
The speed of light

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:39.720
-Speed of light?

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:42.170
no, right? really
-Yeah

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.300
-Oh, I thought it was something different
-Isn't that weird?

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:45.320
The speed of light.

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:46.400
(Right, Ahh)

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.380
(Wow, no wonder we jumped science)

00:03:49.519 --> 00:03:53.099
it seems most people have a tough time
remembering that C is for the speed of light

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:57.329
maybe that's because C is a bit of
a strange letter to represent a speed

00:03:57.329 --> 00:04:00.750
in fact in Einstein's original paper he used the letter V

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:04.510
for velocity of light but nowadays
everyone uses the letter C

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:07.639
for constant it's a constant of the
universe the speed of light

00:04:07.639 --> 00:04:11.409
though some people claim the letter C
stands for celeritas

00:04:11.409 --> 00:04:13.689
the Latin word for swiftness

00:04:13.689 --> 00:04:16.739
What is
that equation telling us about energy and mass?

00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:19.480
Energy equals constant mass?

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:21.560
The mass and the energy...

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:25.440
combine together, create

00:04:25.449 --> 00:04:26.769
the energy

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:29.260
Ha ha ha ha

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:33.380
it's basically saying like this mass that comes out
-yeah

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:35.200
gets converted to a lot of energy

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:36.960
And the speed of light is a huge number

00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:41.280
-Yeah
-If you think about that, a tiny bit of mass is a huge amount of energy

00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:46.160
so every second the Sun is actually
losing 4.3 billion kilograms

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:48.060
every second
-every second?

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:50.060
-That amount of mass is being converted into

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:50.780
-energy

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:55.180
In the Sun hydrogen fuses together to form helium

00:04:55.320 --> 00:04:57.180
but, that's a little confusing because

00:04:57.190 --> 00:05:01.639
how out of only protons do we create a
helium nucleus which has

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:04.320
two protons and two neutrons well the thing is

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:06.920
when the first two smash together

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:11.960
one up the protons
actually emits a positron and a neutrino

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:14.870
and quickly becomes a neutron

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:16.470
next thing
that happens

00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:19.470
is another proton smashes in
*Pshh*

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:21.470
and again we get more energy released

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:25.169
now if two particles like this collide

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:28.620
*Pshh*
they emit two protons

00:05:28.620 --> 00:05:34.220
and what we're left with is a helium 4 nucleus

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:37.800
there you have hydrogen fused into helium

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:41.460
and a lot of mass lost, a lot of energy hehehe

00:05:43.719 --> 00:05:47.669
if you wanna know more about fusion in
the Sun check out this video by minute physics

00:05:47.669 --> 00:05:51.599
it explains how the protons can fuse
even though they're not really going fast enough

00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:53.300
to overcome their repulsion

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:55.300
(...for fusion will fuse together anyway)

00:05:55.479 --> 00:06:00.119
(and the Sun is so big it has so much
hydrogen that these small chances happen all the time)
