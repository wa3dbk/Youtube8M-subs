00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.771
- Oh! This is my song, this is my...

00:00:03.771 --> 00:00:06.556
If i'm dead, I will get
up and dance to this song.

00:00:06.556 --> 00:00:08.414
My favorite song in high school

00:00:08.414 --> 00:00:10.565
was "Hold the Line" by Toto.

00:00:10.819 --> 00:00:12.776
- The Carpenters, The Bee Gees.

00:00:13.006 --> 00:00:14.230
- I like hard rock.

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:16.036
Well, we considered it
hard rock at the time.

00:00:16.036 --> 00:00:17.911
- A lot of Led Zeppelin, Deep Purple.

00:00:22.848 --> 00:00:24.994
- Just hanging around
in our friends garage,

00:00:24.994 --> 00:00:28.373
you know, drinking 12
ounce bottles of beer,

00:00:28.373 --> 00:00:30.421
some people would be smoking pot.

00:00:30.421 --> 00:00:31.706
- That brings back memories of

00:00:31.706 --> 00:00:33.614
one specific girlfriend, Terry.

00:00:33.614 --> 00:00:35.198
When we were headed to the beach

00:00:35.598 --> 00:00:38.942
to go camping that weekend,
the song came true.

00:00:39.385 --> 00:00:41.345
(laughs)

00:00:42.008 --> 00:00:46.091
- Saturday Night Fever
was the movie of movies.

00:00:46.091 --> 00:00:48.944
- Totally reminds me of
me and all my girlfriends

00:00:48.944 --> 00:00:50.531
standing in front of the mirror

00:00:50.531 --> 00:00:52.661
and trying to get the moves right.

00:00:52.964 --> 00:00:56.548
- I went and bought the album,
I listened to it constantly.

00:00:56.548 --> 00:00:58.812
- I never admitted to anybody
that I liked this song,

00:00:58.812 --> 00:01:00.242
but I love the song.

00:01:00.534 --> 00:01:03.576
- I saw them in concert at Anaheim Stadium

00:01:03.576 --> 00:01:05.341
with Foreigner, Ted Nugent,

00:01:05.341 --> 00:01:07.280
REO Speedwagon, and Lynard Skynard.

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.374
One of the greatest concerts of all time.

00:01:09.374 --> 00:01:12.284
- When I was in ninth
grade, for the first time

00:01:12.284 --> 00:01:13.643
somebody said they didn't want to have

00:01:13.643 --> 00:01:14.963
anything to do with me anymore,

00:01:14.963 --> 00:01:16.758
and I literally played this song

00:01:17.218 --> 00:01:20.568
end to end for like three days

00:01:20.568 --> 00:01:22.151
and cried like a bitch in my bedroom.

00:01:22.151 --> 00:01:24.647
- One of my girlfriends said this song

00:01:24.647 --> 00:01:27.311
was perfect for me because
I was as cold as ice.

00:01:30.489 --> 00:01:31.598
- The Boss.

00:01:31.598 --> 00:01:34.159
- Oh! My first concert.

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:36.253
- It was probably the
best concert I ever saw.

00:01:36.253 --> 00:01:38.283
It was like, four hours.

00:01:38.575 --> 00:01:40.717
- We were on the floor seats.

00:01:41.224 --> 00:01:43.926
One of the best experiences of my life.

00:01:44.126 --> 00:01:45.969
- This is not a song that
I would have listened to,

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:47.536
because, like, the bad guys

00:01:47.536 --> 00:01:49.393
(laughing) would listen to that song.

00:01:49.393 --> 00:01:53.574
- What I definitely
remember is the odor of pot.

00:01:53.942 --> 00:01:57.504
- I stood up on the armrests of the chair

00:01:57.504 --> 00:01:59.459
and danced through the whole thing.

00:01:59.459 --> 00:02:01.351
- He was drenched in sweat.

00:02:01.351 --> 00:02:02.907
- It does give you a sense of the freedom

00:02:02.907 --> 00:02:04.823
of being out there and being young.

00:02:04.823 --> 00:02:06.815
- Music defines so much of your life

00:02:06.815 --> 00:02:09.087
and when you hear that song on the radio

00:02:09.087 --> 00:02:11.607
it transports you back
to a different time,

00:02:11.607 --> 00:02:13.886
a different year, a different age.

00:02:13.886 --> 00:02:18.886
(rock guitar music)
