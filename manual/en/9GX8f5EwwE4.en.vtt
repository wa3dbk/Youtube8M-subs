00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:03.810
Another winter warmer recipe for you and here's my recipe for a

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:10.550
beef cottage pie with a secret ingredient
for an extra crispy topping.

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:13.910
And for the ingredients you'll need: 500g of beef mince,

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:18.660
3 carrots, 2 onions, some oil to fry, some
tomato puree, some Worcester Sauce,

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.830
a beef stock cube, 750g of potatoes,

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:25.200
a knob of butter, a dash of milk and some ready salted crisps.

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:29.500
So we'll start by preparing the onions. Cut each end off, chop them in half

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:33.290
then peel them. With a sharp knife carefully

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:38.080
finely chop them then set the
onions aside.

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:42.839
And now it's time for the carrots. Slice each end off, peel them then slice them length ways.

00:00:42.839 --> 00:00:49.480
Then finely chop with your knife.

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:52.750
Now your carrots are ready, you need to get a large pan and stick it on the hob.

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:58.620
Then pour in some oil so we can fry.

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.970
Get your onions and carrots we
prepared earlier and throw them in the pan

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:06.070
then fry for about 5 minutes.

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:11.229
Then get your beef mince and throw that in the pan as well. Along with a couple of major squirts

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:12.100
of tomato puree,

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:19.140
some lashing of Worcester sauce and crumble in the stock cube.

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.890
Then give everything a stir and keep frying until the mince goes nice and brown.

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.280
 

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:30.420
Then when your mince sauce looks something like this, boil the kettle and

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.170
pour some water over the top so the

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:36.210
contents are just about covered. Then give everything one final stir

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.440
and leave it to simmer for about 40 to 50
minutes or until the sauce has thickened.

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:40.960
 

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.200
Meanwhile we can start preparing the mashed potato.

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:52.190
So peal all your spuds and chop them into chunks.

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:56.000
When you potatoes are ready, put some hot water on the go in a saucepan

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:02.490
and leave them to boil for about 15 minutes.

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:06.060
Once your potatoes are done, get yourself a colander then pour the potatoes in to

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:06.910
drain the water.

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:10.520
Then put them back in the saucepan, pour in the dash of milk

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:15.150
then put in your knob of butter.

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:18.439
Get the potato masher and mash the potatoes until they're nice and smooth.

00:02:18.439 --> 00:02:22.310
...like me!

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:25.520
Once your mince sauce has finished simmering and you have a nice thick sauce,

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:26.240
 

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:29.470
give it a final stir and take it off the heat. Now it's ready to stick

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:34.110
everything into an oven dish.

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.830
Firstly spoon out your mince sauce into the dish

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:39.730
and then level it out so it's nice and flat.

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:42.080
 

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:45.420
Now get the mashed potato and spread it out over the mince sauce.

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.500
I find it easier to do if you spoon it out and use the

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:55.120
back of a spoon to spread it over and make
it nice and flat.

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.180
Once you have a nice uniform layer of mashed potato

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:01.980
get a folk and draw some lines in the
top and this will help it to crisp

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:03.410
up a little easier.

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:06.800
now bust open your packet of ready
salted crisps, crush them between your hands

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:07.950
whilst they're still in the packet

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:11.240
so they're nice and find. Then sprinkle
evenly

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:14.990
on the top of the cottage pie. Now it's
ready for the oven.

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:18.680
Stick it on about 190c and put the cottage pie in

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:22.430
for about 35 to 40 minutes. Make sure you
keep an eye on it

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:27.600
to make sure it's not burning and it's crisping up nicely. When its golden brown and it's

00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:28.680
bubbling at the edges

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:32.880
you know it's cooked and it's ready to
serve. So why not enjoy

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:36.110
