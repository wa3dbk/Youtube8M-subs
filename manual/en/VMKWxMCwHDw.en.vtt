00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:11.889
Jaystepher here today with a tutorial on our custom fifth wheel.

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:14.759
I'm going to be showing you how to design the hitch

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:16.770
to put in the back of the truck,

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:21.570
and we're going to be coming off and smooth tiling

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.130
the top of the coach

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.109
the top of the coach

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:31.720
for the roof assembly.

00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:34.590
In one of my previous tutorials, showed you how to build this cool little pickup truck,

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:36.850
In one of my previous tutorials, showed you how to build this cool little pickup truck,

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:39.909
and I'm slowly modifying the bed for a hitch

00:00:39.909 --> 00:00:43.110
four our fifth wheel.

00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:49.540
So I removed the two flat tile pieces that were in the back,

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:53.810
and we're going to modify this for an actual hitch.

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:54.870
So, I'm going to come in,

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:57.100
So, I'm going to come in,

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.510
take two of these two of these 1 by 2 tiles,

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:07.510
we're going to put one on each end.

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:15.159
Take two of these 2 by 2s.

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:24.420
now we got a hole ... a nice 2 by 2

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.200
open spot here in the middle,

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:27.980
so I'm going to use a 2 by 2 plate.

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:32.340
Any color will be fine, I'm just going to use white.

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:34.790
Place it down in there.

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:41.690
Use a 2 by 2 rounded brick,

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:44.080
place it in the middle there.

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:47.360
Now we need to make an assembly so we can easily attach our

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:48.790
hitch to our thing.

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:52.830
So I'm going to make a .... I'm going to take one of these ...

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:56.940
I'm not sure, one of these Technic pieces.

00:01:56.940 --> 00:01:59.670
It's three studs wide,

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:02.810
drop it down in here.

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.420
Now I really don't want my hitch to really bump these studs.

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.599
I'm just going to take one of these little

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:13.259
spacer things,

00:02:13.259 --> 00:02:17.510
drop it down on top

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:21.919
so we have something that our trailer can glide on.

00:02:21.919 --> 00:02:24.179
Now I need to put a hitch on my coach.

00:02:24.179 --> 00:02:29.650
I'm just going to use one of these 2 by 2 plates

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:31.369
with the eyelet thing at the end here.

00:02:31.369 --> 00:02:34.349
I wan to make it where I can just drop it down,

00:02:34.349 --> 00:02:35.939
but I have a nice swivel base here so I can

00:02:35.939 --> 00:02:38.709
but I have a nice swivel base here so I can

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:39.999
put it on the back of the truck

00:02:39.999 --> 00:02:42.319
put it on the back of the truck

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:44.219
for easy maneuvering.

00:02:44.219 --> 00:02:48.609
I'm just going to take the fifth wheel,

00:02:48.609 --> 00:02:52.079
flip it over and I'm going to place it right here at the end

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:53.559
just enough where this rounded bull-nosed part sticks out.

00:02:53.559 --> 00:02:58.829
just enough where this rounded bull-nosed part sticks out.

00:02:58.829 --> 00:03:02.679
Make sure my kickstands here at the bottom are lifted up.

00:03:02.679 --> 00:03:07.659
I'm just simply going to drop it down.

00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:09.260
As you can see,

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:11.879
you got a nice gap underneath the bottom

00:03:11.879 --> 00:03:15.089
and it rolls.

00:03:15.089 --> 00:03:20.209
I can turn the truck.

00:03:20.209 --> 00:03:21.309
There you have it,

00:03:21.309 --> 00:03:27.699
there's the hitch for our fifth wheel.

00:03:27.699 --> 00:03:31.169
Okay we're looking at the top of our fifth wheel here, and I want to come in and smooth tile all this.

00:03:31.169 --> 00:03:35.319
So it's easier to snap a roof on.

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:38.689
I'm going to start right here above our entertainment cabinet.

00:03:38.689 --> 00:03:41.639
I'm just going to use a 2 by 2 smooth tile,

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:42.849
I'm just going to use a 2 by 2 smooth tile,

00:03:42.849 --> 00:03:48.189
place it right here,

00:03:48.189 --> 00:03:54.779
and a 1 by 2.

00:03:54.779 --> 00:03:57.049
I'm just simply going to come in, take a 1 by 8.

00:03:57.049 --> 00:03:59.409
I'm just simply going to come in, take a 1 by 8.

00:03:59.409 --> 00:04:04.589
place it here.

00:04:04.589 --> 00:04:07.120
Simply just start coming around.

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:10.329
Take a 1 by 2.

00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:14.629
A 1 by 4.

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:21.629
Take another 1 by 2. Kind of finish this end off here.

00:04:23.849 --> 00:04:27.830
Put a 1 by 8.

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:29.570
A 1 by 2 here.

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:31.280
Just got above the bedroom all done.

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:32.909
Let's continue with the living area.

00:04:32.909 --> 00:04:35.139
Let's continue with the living area.

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:42.139
Start just placing these big 1 by 8s on here.

00:04:43.569 --> 00:04:47.460
I'm going to put a  1 by 4,

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:50.750
and a 1 by 2.

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:51.620
Now, this is where my fridge thing is sitting at, and it's not quite sturdy there.

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:56.099
Now, this is where my fridge thing is sitting at, and it's not quite sturdy there.

00:04:56.099 --> 00:04:57.849
Just going to take a 2 by 2 flat,

00:04:57.849 --> 00:05:01.289
place it in here.

00:05:01.289 --> 00:05:03.479
Place a 1 by 4 here.

00:05:03.479 --> 00:05:09.610
It kind of locks everything in place.

00:05:09.610 --> 00:05:12.750
I'm just going to come in

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:17.830
Take a 1 by 6 here.

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:22.360
Put another 2 by 2 tile here.

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:24.960
Now we're starting to fill all that in.

00:05:24.960 --> 00:05:29.479
Take a 1 by 8, we'll place it here at the rear where our bathroom's at.

00:05:29.479 --> 00:05:34.690
Place a 1 by 4 tile there.

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:40.130
Place a 1 by 4 tile there.

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:43.870
Another 1 by 4 here.

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:46.119
A 1 by 2,

00:05:46.119 --> 00:05:49.580
and a 1 by 1.

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:51.729
There you have it,

00:05:51.729 --> 00:05:54.580
the top's all nicely smooth and leveled off.

00:05:54.580 --> 00:05:58.559
We can easily come in

00:05:58.559 --> 00:06:03.919
put our top on there.

00:06:03.919 --> 00:06:04.949
In the final tutorial,

00:06:04.949 --> 00:06:06.270
In the final tutorial,

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:09.180
I'm going show you how to build the roof for this.

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:12.000
I'm going to put a skylight in the bathroom,

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:15.029
and a couple of air conditioner units,

00:06:15.029 --> 00:06:19.039
and put the ladder on the back.

00:06:19.039 --> 00:06:19.819
Thank you for watching!
