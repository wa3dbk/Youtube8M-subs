00:00:12.440 --> 00:00:27.350
[loud wind noise]
Alright. Lets put my hat in wind mode.

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:28.350
There you go.

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:29.350
[loud wind noise]

00:00:29.350 --> 00:00:30.350
Hello everyone.
I am out here today because there is one test

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:33.450
I need to do.
There is not much point in me recommending

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:38.890
a shelter, even a temporary shelter, unless
we have tested it in a really good storm.

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:43.970
[loud wind noise]

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:47.989
And they have predicted that this is going
to be a really big storm.

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:54.620
[Loud wind noise]

00:00:54.620 --> 00:01:00.100
Now we already know that these blue tarps
are completely useless for a long term shelter.

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:09.440
The UV rays start disintegrating the polypropylene
fabric within the first month of being up.

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:13.670
So we have proven that.
What we are doing today is we are going to

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:16.250
prove whether or not its any good for a temporary
shelter.

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:23.500
We have got a thunderstorm warning in effect.
High winds, and possibly even hail, and it

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:28.490
looks like it is going to hit us square on,
And it will be one excellent test to see first

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:33.270
if the shelter will stay up.
And second, if blue tarps are even useful

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.450
for a temporary shelter.

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:38.850
[distant wave sounds]
There she comes!

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:44.620
OK. I don't know if you can hear me in this
wind, but I am under the shelter.

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:52.070
And it looks like I have taken a little too
long to set it up because the rain is on its

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:56.920
way.
So, I need to change into my rain gear!

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:03.430
[nylon rubbing]

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:15.240
I've got a soft spot to sit on while I do
up my boots.

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.060
Wow! [slapping] Love these things.

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:24.400
[Waves crashing on shore]

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.230
[Pause]

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:29.900
[near silence]

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:41.350
Ok. We are going to head back now and check
out the shelter.

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:52.950
The storm has continued, as a wind storm.
With gusts up to 90 kilometers her hour today.

00:02:52.950 --> 00:02:57.370
That's 56 miles an hour.
Those are the gusts.

00:02:57.370 --> 00:03:03.400
And it is playing havoc with the civilized
world.

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:04.821
[loud wind noise]

00:03:04.821 --> 00:03:07.700
Better get in wind mode.

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:13.910
Ok. 24 hours later, lets go and see how our
shelter made it through this really, really

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:16.120
bad storm.

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:21.750
Of course you wouldn't put your shelter right
beside the lake like this would you. If a

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:25.500
storm was coming you would put it deep in
the woods where you would have protection.

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:32.260
What I really want to do though is find out
if the shelter frame itself is a good design.

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:37.080
If its up after this wind, I'll be impressed.

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:46.020
[loud wind, flapping]

00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:51.970
[wave, wind]

00:03:51.970 --> 00:03:57.930
[flapping fabric]

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:09.849
[flapping fabric and waves]

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:18.160
Well what did we learn from this?
Obviously the shelter design is good. It stayed

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:23.729
up in the wind. It hasn't blown over.
But I think we can conclude that these polypropylene

00:04:23.729 --> 00:04:29.540
blue tarps are completely useless even for
a short term shelter like this.

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:34.290
Unless of course you didn't want it to provide
shelter.

00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:35.290
Thanks for watching.

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:35.295
