Hi Dears, welcome t the next "Macademian Girl Inspires" vlog. Today I've got another letter for you, from my reader, Aneta. Thanks dear for this warm, warm mail.

00:00:23.174 --> 00:00:30.100
I'm gonna read it in a moment and I hope that you like it as much as I do, as it's wonderful and optimistic. Let's start.

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:42.100
Hi! I've been following your blog for a while now, give or take from the beginning of 2012. I fell in love immediately. Colors, textures, a lot of everything, but always

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:50.100
greatly composed. I remember my first thought when I saw your outfit from the third day of Fashion Week: the red feather skirt, ornamented coat, 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:01:05.100
and terribly crazy headpiece - an oriental bird. I love that look, Anna dello Russo's bird, vintage coat.. A wonderful coat. I love it.. 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:15.100
So, Aneta remembered the outfit and thought: "Wow! Amazing! A walking piece of art!" Thanks for that!

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:25.100
"I live in the capital, I work in one of the international companies and even tough I always liked colors, I was scared of them." 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:35.100
-You didn't have to - "There were mainly black, grey, white and beige in my closet - Boring, boring, boring. Well, the problem of all, well, most of people working in big

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:45.100
companies, don't worry, your sins have been forgiven. As I've been following your blog, I started experimenting even more - pink, red, violet and

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:55.100
a lot of more colors came into my closet. Besides from colors, I also started paying more attention to cut. I started looking for clothes that 

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:05.100
really matched me. Well, I am supposed to stick to the dresscode, but I'm always able to smuggle some craziness. I've recently decided to go for juicy lipglosses - 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:15.100
blooody red, 

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:25.100
blooody red,

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:35.100
I've recently decided to go for juicy lipglosses - bloody red, violet, which, to my surprise, really suit me. and I bet that everyone around you thinks that as well ;)

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:45.100
It's funny, as I'm approaching my 30s and I was really convinced that I'm still too young to wear them.

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:55.100
Nothing more wrong. Lipglosses are an incredible thing! Absolutely chic and classy!

00:02:55.100 --> 00:03:05.100
So if you think that you're not mature enough, change your thinking and get yourself a wonderful one! Start with a red one. I feel attractive, sexi, 

00:03:05.100 --> 00:03:15.100
my husband is thrilled about my makeover and he compliments me very often on my outfits or make ups. Greetings for the husband, carry on!

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:25.100
It's all thanks to you, Tamara and that's what I'd like to thank you for. For inspiration, courage, motivation for small, yet important changes.

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:35.100
If it weren't for your blog, I wouldn't even have tried. I wish you a lot of luck, successes, never ending happiness and satisfaa

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:46.100
nom nom

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:53.100
I wish you a lot of luck, successes, never ending happiness and satisfaction. All the best once more. Thanks a lot. Kisses!

00:03:53.100 --> 00:04:04.100
Kisses from the bottom of my heart, Aneta! And thanks for this mail, as it's soo optimistic, so great and it shows what fashion is in real life. 

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:14.100
Remember, fashion is not an artificial creature that's imposing something on you or forcing you to do something. It's about being able to your soul and what you've got inside you

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:24.100
from the outside, before you even start talking to somebody, so that he could see who you are. An that's what fashion is about. Not about

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:34.100
fitting in, hiding yourselves but even in such difficult cases as Aneta is in, and working in a company is the most difficult environment for

00:04:34.100 --> 00:04:44.100
fashion experiments, I'm not hiding that I'm perfectly aware of that. Look! Aneta managed to acheive to smuggle a lipgloss here, a chic accessory there and 

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:54.100
it's great! Girls, you've gotta look up to her and I'm happy that you wrote to me, I'd really like to thank you for your letters, as they motivate me

00:04:54.100 --> 00:05:04.100
and help me see that what I'm doing has a value. Keep changing your life into a colorful, better, more courageous and true one. 

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:14.100
