00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:49.050
This Mercedes-Benz Sprinter is in the
colours of 'Cardem'

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:53.130
which is the demolition company that is part
of the VINCI group.   There is a Daimler badge

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:56.080
on the box showing it is a genuine
licensed product

00:00:56.080 --> 00:01:00.990
and it comes in a small Conrad branded
box.   Inside there is no surprise with the

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:03.510
packaging because it's foam backed
cardboard

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:07.950
and that protects the model and also a
bag containing a couple of mirrors.

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:22.409
The mirrors are attached to a plastic
sprue and the first thing to do is to get

00:01:22.409 --> 00:01:23.040
them off,

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.020
and if you can't be bothered with a
modelling knife you can just twist them

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.440
off.

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:31.299
After that it is a fairly straightforward
matter to press the mirrors into holes

00:01:31.299 --> 00:01:35.570
that are pre-formed in the van.  They are a a bit of a
tight fit and here you can see the Cranes

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:36.479
Etc fitter

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.790
has not really fitted the first mirror
correctly. Sometimes it just doesn't seem

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:44.799
to matter how much you train a person they
just cant do a job properly.

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:51.799
Come on!  Straighten that other mirror out!

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.460
For some reason this version of the
model has a plastic floor pan

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:09.150
and the rear axle and steering is also
plastic.  The tyres are fine and are

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:10.840
mounted on plastic wheels,

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:14.320
and it's good to see that the model has
realistic number plates.

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:18.540
The windscreen wipers are applied as
graphics and interior detail is quite

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:19.200
good.

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.390
The panel details and door handles are nicely
done

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:26.300
and the graphics are reasonably sharp.  There are picture graphics on the rear doors

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:29.440
which are fine as long as you don't view
them in extreme close-up.

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:40.400
Here on the Cranes Etc

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:43.620
'autoroute' the Sprinter van rolls
reasonably well

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.090
although some friction prevents it being
completely free rolling.

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:51.360
The wheels turn individually and at the front there is
steering which achieves a reasonable

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:51.950
angle

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:55.390
and if we set that the van makes an attempt
at cornering.

00:02:55.390 --> 00:02:59.330
One issue not so good on the review
model was that the rear doors didn't

00:02:59.330 --> 00:03:00.460
have a good fit

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:04.430
and they wouldn't really close properly
achieving a nice flush finish.

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:08.820
It's unusual to see it on a model like
this and it might be because the doors are

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:10.200
in fact made of plastic

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:14.610
and maybe the tolerances are just a
little bit out.  But one thing you can do

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:17.330
is to try and trim the plastic a little
bit with a sharp knife

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:21.200
and try and get a better fit.   This
version of the van is also unusual

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:24.739
because it doesn't have an opening side
door like previous versions,

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:27.930
and it's surprising that this functionality
has been removed in a model with the

00:03:27.930 --> 00:03:29.070
same model number.

00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:32.770
Looking inside the van there's also
another difference which is that there's

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:34.510
no plastic lining inside

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:38.080
which suggests that this is a lower-cost
version of the model compared to previous

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:38.989
versions.

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:44.040
Anyway with all that said it is on with the
genuine imitation real-life test

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:47.810
and here we see the van delivering its load.

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:51.170
Here at Cranes Etc we like to deliver the
team members to exactly the place they are

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:52.020
needed....

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:54.500
and there!  That's the way to do it!  

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:01.209
This model has more plastic and less functionality than previous versions of the model

00:04:01.209 --> 00:04:04.410
and it would have been better just to
have the earlier version made in Cardem

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:05.180
colours.

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:09.150
However if you do have other models in
Cardem colours, then this one matches

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:09.959
them well.
