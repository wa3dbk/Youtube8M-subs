00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.280
 

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:05.880
Hey I know you use this trick 
in your show

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:08.480
and when I saw you do it 
the other day, 

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:10.310
you had a great idea. 

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:14.560
I was doing this trick more close up, 
where the cards were on the table,

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.550
You came up saying 
"I use a little stand."

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:20.980
This is really a little, like, plastic shoebox.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.580
And you said you can use 
even a folded book, 

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.500
as long as you can create a stand. 

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:31.430
And we call this Follow the Queen 
or Three Card Monte. 

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:34.150
The object is- 
we're going to move the cards around. 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:35.760
You've gotta follow the Queen. 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:38.020
Of course, they're not gonna be 
facing the audience. 

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:39.240
That would be too easy. 

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:41.820
The backs are gonna be 
toward the audience. 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:43.440
Again, that would be 
too easy this way. 

00:00:43.460 --> 00:00:45.130
And this is easy to follow

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:47.880
We use a King. 
We use another King 

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:53.680
and we use the all-important 
Queen of  Hearts. 

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:54.980
That's the one you have to follow. 

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.300
So, easy to remember.
 Easy to follow. 

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.230
Queen, King and King. 

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:01.930
Ready for the move? 
Here we go. 

00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:05.730
And now the bets start. 
Where's the Queen?

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:09.610
Of course, they're gonna say here. 
And say "No, you're wrong. 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.070
Maybe it didn't move at all. 
You just weren't watching."

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:17.780
The Queen is now back over here.

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:22.320
And let's start with the Queen 
back in the middle just like that, 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:26.380
and now we have the two Kings. 
Easy to remember again. 

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.130
Queen, King and King. 

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:30.880
Let's move it this way 

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:34.280
and if you said the King, 
one King is still here, 

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:36.220
you would have been absolutely right. 

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:38.960
If you said the second King 
is in the middle, 

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:40.880
you would have been right also. 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:44.040
And if you said the Queen is here- 
you just weren't watching. 

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:45.280
That's the King. 

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:47.020
Now if that's the King 
and this was the King, 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:49.750
where's the Queen? 
Back in the middle. 

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:52.380
You're not busy are you?
[ No ]  Oh not too much. 

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:56.580
Because I think we're confusing the audience right here 
maybe using three cards. 

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.700
Why don't we eliminate one of the cards?

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:02.100
Would you mind holding on to this, 
so we're not distracted. 

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:03.730
We're just using two cards. 

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:07.380
So remember, 
this Queen is closest to me

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.660
That's closest to me, 
the King is closest to the audience.

00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:15.230
Once again, there's the Queen closest to me,
 there's the King closest to you. 

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:17.180
We'll do a little switch here. 

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.070
Anybody want to bet on 
where the Queen is? 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:22.980
Still over here? 
That's actually the King. Sorry about that.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.580
How about over here? 
That's the King. 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:31.380
And would you show them 
the Queen is now over in Jim's hands.

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:32.580
Hey, I liked your routine. 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:37.350
Thanks for coming up with the suggestions 
of using like a little stand. 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:40.470
This is really a little plastic box. 
[ Works well. ] 

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:42.350
And you got it like at the Dollar Store. 

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:45.350
And you could transport your magic in there. 

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:49.030
And I just covered it with a little silk scarf 
to fancy it up. 

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:52.290
And this is called Jumbo Three Card Monte

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:54.500
It's completely automatic, easy to do. 

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:56.280
Comes with the cards, 
the instructions

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:58.080
You're not included, right? 
[ No ] No. 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:59.490
He's busy. He's doing shows. 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:02.380
So get one. 
Have some fun.

00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:07.202
