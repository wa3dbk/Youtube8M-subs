00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:04.940
I added glitter to a few more of the flowers
 , as you can see here. I really wanted this

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:09.469
bag to sparkle. So the next thing I'm going
to do is adhere this designer series paper

00:00:09.469 --> 00:00:13.799
to my solid paper. And when you're working
with glitter; as you can see I've got it all

00:00:13.799 --> 00:00:20.100
over me, so just give up. It will be everywhere,
but it's a lot of fun. So, when you leave

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:23.340
the house just check your face. Make sure
you don't have any glitter still left on your

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:29.500
face. And, if you do, that's ok too. So, I'm
lining up this paper, using my grid paper

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:35.412
here to line it up, make sure it's even. And
then the next thing I want to do is I want

00:00:35.412 --> 00:00:40.690
to add a little bit of ribbon, because I'm
going to hang a tag from it. So I'm going

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:45.750
to go ahead and give myself some ribbon. And
I'm using the wide 5/8" gross grain ribbon,

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:54.190
and this is the very vanilla. And I'm just
going to tie a little knot on this one side.

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:59.720
Right over left, left over right. And when
you get ready to tie it tight, you just give

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:06.280
it one little twist and your bow will lay
flat. All right, now I'm going to trim up

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:11.700
my bow. So that's nice and pretty. And I'm
going to make a little tag that's going to

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:17.900
hang from that. And to do that, I have my
1 3/8" circle punch, and I'm just going to

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:23.210
cut out this flower that coordinates with
this paper. And again, I'm going to put a

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:27.390
little more bling on this package, so, I'm
going to go ahead and put some glue, just

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:32.590
outlining this flower, and of course, the
center. I'm going to dip that into my dazzling

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:38.060
diamonds. Why not? I've got it everywhere
already. And then I'm going to use my scallop

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:44.840
punch, and I'm going to punch a background
for this. I'm using the coordinating paper.

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:54.160
But I want the green side. And I'm just going
to adhere that to that scalloped circle. And

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:59.700
then the next thing that I'm going to do is
I'm going to adhere this with a little string

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.110
to the ribbon, and then we can put the whole
bag together and you'll see what a wonderful

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.079
gift bag you'll have.
