Hi Guys, its Cindy Lietz, your Polymer Clay
Tutor, and in today's PCT Mini Tute, I'm going

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:17.910
to show you a really neat color mixing trick
that I like to call, Color Plus 1.

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.509
Now I know that color mixing can be pretty
intimidating for a lot of people, but this

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:28.540
neat little trick will make it a lot easier
to come up with your own custom color palettes.

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:35.309
Now I've got some colors here of Premo! clay
that don't go together very nicely, they’re

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:43.230
straight from the pack, and I've got some
Fuchsia, Orange, Cad Yellow, Green and Raw

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:44.680
Sienna.

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:48.390
Now these colors, if I was to just use them
straight from the pack, they wouldn't look

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:57.289
that great together, but if I Plus 1 a new
color, such as Gold or Black, I can make a

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:01.870
really neat color palette where all the colors
go beautifully together.

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:08.320
So here I've got some new colors here where
I've added a little bit of Gold to them, and

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:14.060
they all look lovely together, now let me
explain this technique a little bit more to

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:15.180
you.

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:24.380
Now, if I take…if I take a little cutter
and I take 1 part of each of the colors…and

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:30.890
let’s get this out of the way, and I add
a new color to them…so I've got here…

00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:37.080
I’ve got Fuchsia, and then…I've got 1
part Fuchsia and I add a half of a part of

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:39.010
Gold… this is just Premo!

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:45.789
Regular Gold, and mix them together I'll get
this color here, and it's kind of an iridescent

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:49.220
Raspberry type color that's really beautiful.

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:54.770
If I do the same thing to the Orange, I add
1 part Orange and a half a part Gold, I get

00:01:54.770 --> 00:02:02.520
this color here which is a real pretty color,
same with the Yellow, the Green and the Raw

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:08.890
Sienna, now you can see all these colors look
pretty together now, because their underlying…there's

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:15.330
an underlying commonality to all these colors
which is the Gold, right?

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:20.050
So they automatically go together because
the Gold’s in all of them, now you can do

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:24.890
this with any colors that you want, you could
use any of your base colors that you want,

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:28.260
and then your additional color can be any
color that you want.

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:35.920
I've done the same experiment here, only this
time I added some Black clay to it, so…but

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:42.200
because Black is such a strong color…I’ll
move this here a little bit, because Black

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:49.310
is such a strong color I used a lot less of
it this time.So I used 1 part Fuchsia and

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:57.540
an eighth of a part of Black, and I got this
Burgundy…or this Purple-y kind of color

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:04.800
here, for the Orange, I mixed the same thing,
1 part Orange and an eighth of a part Black,

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:10.110
and I got this sort of Brown color, which
is actually pretty similar to a Raw Sienna,

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:13.030
only a little lighter.

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:21.730
Then for the Yellow, when I mixed the Black
in, I got this Green color, and for the Green,

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:27.560
when I mixed the Black in, I got this rich
kind of Tropical Type Green, and then the

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:33.180
Brown, when I mixed the Raw Sienna and the
Black I got a little bit of a Darker Brown.

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:34.180
But as you can see…

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:39.900
I'll get these outta here for distraction
purposes, you can see that these colors now

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:43.260
go together beautifully too.

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:51.930
So this would work for adding White as your
extra color, your plus 1 color or Ecru or

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:57.970
Copper or any of them, you may just have to
experiment a little bit with the amounts that

00:03:57.970 --> 00:04:03.070
you add, because of the strengths of the different
colors that they are, but this way, you can

00:04:03.070 --> 00:04:09.620
pull any kinda weird colors that you have
in your collection, and make a palette with

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:10.620
it.

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:16.090
So I hope that was helpful for you, if it
was make sure to press that like button that

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:17.910
would be great.

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:24.040
And my question for you today is, are you
a little bit intimidated by color mixing?

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:31.820
