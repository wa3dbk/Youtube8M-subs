00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:41.220
Help, I have done it again
I have been here many times before

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:59.130
Hurt myself again today
And the worst part is there's no one else

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:00.130
to blame

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:10.220
Be my friend, hold me
Wrap me up, unfold me

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:11.220
I am small, I'm needy
Warm me up and breathe me

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.910
Ouch, I have lost myself again
Lost myself and I am nowhere to be found

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:16.610
Yeah, I think that I might break
Lost myself again and I feel unsafe

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:26.910
Be my friend, hold me
Wrap me up, unfold me

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:27.910
I am small, I'm needy
Warm me up and breathe me

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:28.910
Be my friend, hold me
Wrap me up, unfold me

00:01:28.910 --> 00:01:28.921
I am small, I'm needy
Warm me up and breathe me
