[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:06.650
A lot of folks ask what do
you like to cook at home.

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:09.140
For me at home, it's
about being unpretentious.

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:13.670
It's about just going in the kitchen and
having flow, just being like a maestro.

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:15.680
This recipe is one of my favorites.

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:17.390
I like that at it's unpretentious.

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:18.890
And I like that it's effortless.

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:19.970
I've got a pot on.

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:21.650
And it's getting nice and warm already.

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:23.552
Because what I'm looking
for, as the butter

00:00:23.552 --> 00:00:25.322
goes in there, for that initial heat.

00:00:25.322 --> 00:00:26.780
So we're going to take some butter.

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:29.180
I like to use unsalted butter
when I'm cooking, because I

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:31.150
prefer to add the salt to it myself.

00:00:31.150 --> 00:00:32.570
So that goes in the pan.

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:34.180
We want to coat the pan.

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:38.090
Now I'm using an induction
burner by Kenmore of course.

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:41.660
And this is going up to
a medium heat for this.

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:44.420
I've got the garlic, which is chopped.

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:45.169
Fantastic.

00:00:45.169 --> 00:00:46.960
And I'm going to add
the garlic to the pan.

00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:51.300
You can see, already this room is going
to start smell good within moments.

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.620
The shallots, we're just
actually sweating them

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:56.214
in the pan, which means
about medium to high heat.

00:00:56.214 --> 00:00:58.130
We're not looking to
brown the onions, we just

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:00.900
want to get that nice
sweet taste out of them.

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.830
So if you look in the pan now,
you can see that they're cooking.

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:06.320
Now that they've sweated,
we're going to add some wine.

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:09.460
Try to use a crisp, dry wine for this.

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:12.250
Add the wine to here.

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:14.090
Bring this up to a boil.

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:16.460
Now what you want to do,
the most common mistakes

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.910
are when people make mussels is
that you don't let this come down.

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:23.360
I want to let this come down for about
three to four minutes to like a syrup.

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.750
Because remember, when the mussels go
in there and the shrimp go in there,

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:27.179
they're going release water.

00:01:27.179 --> 00:01:29.720
Because we're looking for a
broth, where we can dip bread in,

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.612
because that's my favorite part.

00:01:31.612 --> 00:01:33.320
So we can see now, as
we look in the pan,

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:35.850
it starts to reduce down
to make a nice syrup.

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.150
The alcohol's cooked out.

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:40.640
For anybody's who's worried
about using alcohol in cookery,

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.360
feel free to use some apple juice
or some chicken stock for this.

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:47.630
If you're a vegetarian, feel
free to use some vegetable stock.

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:50.740
So what we want to do now is actually
add the shrimp and the mussels.

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:54.200
So we're going to grab some of the
shrimp and place them into the pot.

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:55.700
Just place them in there.

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:58.400
And these are going to take
about three minutes to cook.

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:02.240
And then we're going to take some of
these mussels, place them in there.

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:05.480
We're taking them off the ice, because
that's how we like to store mussels.

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:07.080
Mussels really like that.

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:08.900
And then what we're
going to do is, this is

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:12.890
going to chill the pan down so we're
going to put the heat up to high.

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:16.409
On this induction burner, it
has a thing called power boost.

00:02:16.409 --> 00:02:18.950
And the power boost is going to
get the heat up straightaway.

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:20.310
It's fabulous.

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.340
And every one of those mussels in there.

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:27.419
And what we want to do now is
after we add, give it a stir.

00:02:27.419 --> 00:02:28.710
Give it a stir, just like this.

00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:30.590
And then you want to add the lid to it.

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:33.260
What's going to happen is
the lid is going to trap

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:34.970
in-- we've got that juice in there.

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:36.650
We've got that juice from the mussels.

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:37.820
We've got the wine.

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:38.960
And everything's going
to come together and it's

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:40.610
going to cause a steaming process.

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:42.650
That will cause the mussels to open.

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:44.600
Now you only want to
go about three minutes.

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:47.330
If you go more than one
minute more, it can actually

00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:49.610
cause the mussel to go tight.

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:52.250
Sometimes you have mussels,
they're not plump and juicy.

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:53.990
There as tough as a flip-flop.

00:02:53.990 --> 00:02:55.440
We don't want that to happen.

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.815
While they're cooking, I'm
just going to grab some basil.

00:02:57.815 --> 00:03:01.340
I'm going to do a thing called
chiffonade, or basically, into ribbons.

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:04.440
I'm just going to take
the basil, fold it over.

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:05.810
Listen, don't be pretentious.

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:08.601
It doesn't matter if one's a little
bit thicker than the other one.

00:03:08.601 --> 00:03:09.380
You're at home.

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:11.480
You're meant to be enjoying cooking.

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:12.920
Fantastic.

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:13.612
Clean that off.

00:03:13.612 --> 00:03:14.820
Let's take a look in the pot.

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:18.110
These are going to be
nearly done already.

00:03:18.110 --> 00:03:20.140
And look, the mussels have opened.

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:22.550
See the way they've opened up.

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:25.460
The shrimp are cooking beautiful.

00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:26.840
Fantastic.

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:30.680
Put them on for about one more minute,
and we're going to be happy days.

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:33.170
I find a lot when you
watch a lot of the shows

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:37.659
that people spend too much time working
on presentation, the food gets cold,

00:03:37.659 --> 00:03:39.950
and it causes you and your
partner to have an argument.

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:43.420
The best way I think to serve food
is just to bring it off the stove,

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:45.020
bring it over to the table.

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:49.090
I always put a damp cloth or
you could use a trivet on there.

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:53.690
And then what we want to do is just
come to here, add some fresh basil, just

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:54.950
put fresh basil.

00:03:54.950 --> 00:04:00.350
And remember, seafood always
loves acidity, so fresh lemon.

00:04:00.350 --> 00:04:01.710
Just fresh lemon comes across.

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:06.050
And squeezing it through you're fingers
because I want to catch the sees.

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:08.630
Because in the United
States you have teeth.

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:12.130
In England, we don't have teeth, so it
doesn't really matter about the seeds.

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:13.640
Squeezing it across.

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:16.488
And then what we want to
do is toss that around.

00:04:16.488 --> 00:04:17.660
Take a look in the pan.

00:04:17.660 --> 00:04:20.360
You can see the mussels
are perfectly cooked.

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:22.960
I just want to show your
a perfectly cooked mussel.

00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:24.500
See the way it's so plump.

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:25.610
It's plump.

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:26.810
It's delicious.

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:28.070
And it's not tough.

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:30.560
And if that would have went
for a minute or two more,

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:34.460
then you would end up
with this tough mussel.

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:37.280
I'm going to take all these,
and then what I want to do

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:39.340
is actually try it, have a taste.

00:04:42.322 --> 00:04:45.690
It's got this sweet
flavor from the wine.

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:49.680
I can taste the floral flavor
from the actual basil as well.

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:52.642
The only thing it may be short of
is a little bit of ground pepper.

00:04:52.642 --> 00:04:54.100
There, it needs some ground pepper.

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:57.266
I'm not going to add any salt because
we've got a beautiful taste of the sea

00:04:57.266 --> 00:04:58.230
already.

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:02.220
When it comes to savory, just serve
it with some crispy, grilled bread.

00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:04.260
This bread is going to
absorb all that sauce.

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:06.390
Look inside the pan, that sauce.

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:10.440
This in here, to me, is what
I call a heavenly recipe.

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:12.420
It's unpretentious, it's effortless.

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:15.060
You can get all the ingredients
in your supermarket.

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:16.020
I hope you enjoyed it.

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:18.490
And I hope you make it for
your friends and family.

00:05:18.490 --> 00:05:20.485
Until next time, I'm John Ashton.

00:05:20.485 --> 00:05:22.110
I'm going to feed the rest of the crew.

00:05:22.110 --> 00:05:23.970
They're all smiling like Sponge Bob.

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:25.890
See you next time
folks, cheerio for now.

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:27.630
Happy days.

00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:30.380
