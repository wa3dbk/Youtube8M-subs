00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.370
Today we are going to install part number
90635 from Hidden Hitch.

00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:08.170
And we are going to install this on a 2003
Ford Escape.

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:11.250
First to show you where the hitch mounts up
on the frame of the vehicle, where it is going

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.290
to mount up is on this hole here and here.

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:19.710
What is going to happen is we will thread
our hardware from the edge of the frame through

00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:24.800
the opening back here and we will pull our
hardware through from the inside out.

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:30.019
Now some vehicles, there will be an exhaust
shield on there which you will have to trim.

00:00:30.019 --> 00:00:33.540
Instructions are provided to do that but in
this case there is not one existing so we

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.140
do not have to worry about it.

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:37.190
And if you do have to trim it, it is very
easy.

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:40.870
Tin snips is all you need to cut it out and
make room for the hitch.

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:43.430
And this assembly is going to be both identical
on both sides.

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:45.710
And it is also going to use one last attachment.

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:48.511
It is going to use a tow loop here too.

00:00:48.511 --> 00:00:52.560
We are going to start on the passenger side
of the vehicle.

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:55.170
We will start fish wiring our hardware in.

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:58.100
Now there is going to be two bolts that go
in, per side.

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:00.010
And there is a difference in the bolts too.

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:02.350
The one is just basically going to be longer
than the other.

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:12.900
What is going to happen is the short bolt
is going to go in the rear most hole here

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:19.050
and then the longer bolt is going to go in
this hole and it is going to get a spacer

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:21.940
put between the frame and the hitch itself.

00:01:21.940 --> 00:02:07.920
So that is why you will put 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.569
the longer bolt in the back.

00:02:12.569 --> 00:03:02.130
With the fish wiring tools, we will start
with the 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:26.930
bolt 

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:40.760
in the back.

00:03:40.760 --> 00:04:13.930
We will just pull it through the hole we are
going to use.

00:04:13.930 --> 00:05:12.339
Go 
all the way to the 

00:05:12.339 --> 00:06:50.779
end of the frame and pull it out.
