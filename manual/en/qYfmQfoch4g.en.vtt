00:00:00.669 --> 00:00:06.190
For May 2014, this is CTA News in Review.

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:11.570
Mayor Rahm Emanuel and CTA President Forrest
Claypool announced that CTA had completed

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:16.599
the installation of security cameras on more
than 800 rail cars to enhance safety for passengers

00:00:16.599 --> 00:00:23.039
and assist in crime-reduction efforts. The
expansion of cameras on the CTA system coincides

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:29.119
with a 26 percent decrease in serious crimes
in the first three months of 2014 across the

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:34.399
CTA's rail and bus system, compared with the
same period a year ago.

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:40.870
Since late 2011, the CTA has doubled its rail
station camera network to more than 3,600

00:00:40.870 --> 00:00:47.870
cameras and last year began a $13.9 million
program to install more than 3,300 360-degree

00:00:48.839 --> 00:00:55.799
cameras on 834 rail cars. The state-of-the-art
cameras record and store high-resolution images

00:00:55.799 --> 00:01:01.529
from all angles, increasing the ability to
identify criminal suspects. Similar cameras

00:01:01.529 --> 00:01:05.880
are installed on the CTA's newest generation
of rail cars currently being added to

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:11.560
CTA's rail fleet, and all CTA buses have multiple
security cameras as well, with the full complement

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.899
of cameras totaling more than 23,000.

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:19.450
Just last month, the CTA announced that security
cameras have helped achieve a big jump in

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:26.009
arrests for graffiti crimes. In just the first
three months of 2014, a combination of Chicago

00:01:26.009 --> 00:01:31.369
police surveillance missions and camera images
aided in 60 graffiti-related arrests, the

00:01:31.369 --> 00:01:35.229
equivalent of all CTA vandalism arrests made
in 2013.

00:01:35.229 --> 00:01:40.990
Crime is extremely low on the CTA system.
Out of more than 120 million rides in January

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:47.990
through March, there have been just 483 crimes
on the system or 4 crimes per every million

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:49.020
rides.

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:54.840
The CTA continued its modernization projects
on the Near South Side, including the rehabilitation

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:59.880
of the Harrison Red Line station and the Orange
Line's 18th Street Connector, as part of a

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:05.249
larger $92 million transportation investment
in the Near South Side announced last year

00:02:05.249 --> 00:02:09.069
by Mayor Rahm Emanuel and CTA President Forrest
Claypool.

00:02:09.069 --> 00:02:14.159
The Harrison Red Line station rehabilitation
will provide a brighter, cleaner and safer

00:02:14.159 --> 00:02:19.120
travel environment for the 1.4 million people
who use the Harrison station each year.

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:24.980
Work on the Orange Line's 18th Street Connector,
which carries Orange Line trains to and from

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.430
the Loop, will make significant repairs to
the half-mile structure that will provide

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.040
a smoother, more reliable ride for customers.

00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:37.370
The CTA also continued its track improvement
project on the Blue Line O'Hare branch, as

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:42.430
part of the Your New Blue project announced
by Mayor Emanuel and CTA President Claypool

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:47.430
in December. The track work will create a
smoother, faster and more reliable ride for

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:52.209
customers and is expected to be completed
in September

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:57.739
In recognition of the 2014 Memorial Day holiday,
the CTA announced that it doubled the number

00:02:57.739 --> 00:03:04.739
of United States military veterans on staff
since 2010 to 348 today from 173 in 2010.

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:11.379
The increases are the result of Mayor Rahm
Emanuel and CTA President Forrest Claypool's

00:03:11.379 --> 00:03:15.010
focused efforts to promote and expand the
hiring of veterans.

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:19.730
Over the past several years, veterans have
increasingly joined the CTA in a wide variety

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:24.920
of positions, from bus operators and flagmen
to mechanics and customer-service assistants.

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:30.180
More than 20 now serve in manager or coordinator
positions.

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:35.299
Efforts to further increase hiring of veterans
began in May 2012, when Claypool signed the

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:40.310
CTA's first-ever executive order creating
a veterans hiring preference. The order set

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:45.260
a CTA goal to attract at least a 20 percent
pool of veterans during the application process

00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:51.480
for positions, including drivers, mechanics,
engineers, managers and other workers. Over

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:57.269
the 18 months, CTA has also done direct outreach
to veterans at a dozen career fairs, including

00:03:57.269 --> 00:04:00.890
Hiring Our Heroes and other veterans hiring
events.

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:06.469
Prior to any vacancy being posted, CTA reviews
and adjusts job descriptions, where applicable,

00:04:06.469 --> 00:04:11.840
to account for "equivalent experience" to
reflect military experience. For example,

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:16.140
a posting for bus mechanics takes into account
a veteran's experience servicing military

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:18.760
vehicles or equipment.

00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:23.600
In the next step of the transition to the
Ventra fare payment system, the CTA and Pace

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:28.630
reminded customers that as of June 1 they
can no longer use Chicago Card or Chicago

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:33.630
Card Plus, and they can no longer reload magnetic
stripe fare cards.

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:39.360
At the end of May, 92 percent of all rides
taken on CTA trains and buses were done so

00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:40.110
with Ventra.

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:45.110
CTA and Pace will complete the full transition
to Ventra on July 1.
