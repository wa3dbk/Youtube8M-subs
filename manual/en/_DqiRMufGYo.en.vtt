00:00:00.299 --> 00:00:06.070
Here we have a variety of flint glass we're
going to talk about this today and these are

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:11.440
some nice examples there's a number of patterns
in each a number of different shapes in each

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:18.960
pattern that you can take a look at. This
flint glass is in the era of 1850 a little

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:25.250
earlier a little later it was prior to the
civil war of 1860 and the reason we call it

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:30.859
flint glass is because there is an awful lot
of lead in here and when you pick up a piece

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:38.510
I can show you an example like this campo,
if you pick it up and ring you can hear the

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:44.469
sound of the bell and bell is caused from
the lead and after the civil war or during

00:00:44.469 --> 00:00:52.039
the civil war they had to use the lead for
bullets so they stopped putting lead into

00:00:52.039 --> 00:00:58.239
the glass so you lost this tone so that's
how you one way you can tell that this is

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:03.239
flint glass. And we have another we have another
few varieties of flint glass here we can show

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:10.830
you today, these are campos and if you look
around there's a number 3, or 4 we have goblets,

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:19.510
tumblers, they made them in shapes of oil
lamps with patterns. We have what they call

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:28.350
a spooner a really pretty picture with an
applied handle it was the way that the handle

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.950
they way the handle was applied to the back
of the picture. Which was not perfected very

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:38.610
well during that period you can tell if you
are looking at pictures that the majority

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:45.670
of them will see in the back the most of them
are cracked the reason there cracked because

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:50.740
they didn't have the firing down to perfection,
so if your looking at these pictures don't

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:59.030
be surprise that you see 9 out of 10 are cracked.
We have honey dishes you can take a look at,

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:06.370
we have egg cups in different varieties, cover
sugar bowls, uncovered sugar bowls, goblets,

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:17.250
here's a spill, and I think we have a wine
cherry and I think that's all I have today,

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:19.420
but we'll talk about the patterns in a little
bit.
