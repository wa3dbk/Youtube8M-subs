{QTtext}{timescale:100}{font:Verdana}{size:20}{backColor:0,0,0}
{textColor:65280,65280,65280}{width:960}{justify:center}

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:06.030
{plain}

00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:11.690
[00:00:07.54]
We have a blank

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:13.599
composition with no layers selected.

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:15.849
[00:00:10.29]
We've selected a Rounded Rectangle tool.

00:00:15.849 --> 00:00:18.330
[00:00:12.97]
We'll set up our initial fill and stroke colors.

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:19.930
[00:00:14.94]
It's time to draw a shape.

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:21.670
[00:00:16.81]
I'm going to start by clicking and

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:24.510
dragging in the Composition panel, but

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.570
[00:00:20.94]
before you let go of the mouse button, there

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:28.689
are some great shortcut keys I want to show
you.

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:31.230
[00:00:25.48]
While your mouse is still down, if you

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:34.129
hold the spacebar down, you can reposition

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:35.129
[00:00:30.36]
your shape.

00:00:35.129 --> 00:00:37.589
So if you find you've been
drawing in the wrong place, this is a way

00:00:37.589 --> 00:00:39.409
[00:00:33.90]
to quickly move it into the right location.

00:00:39.409 --> 00:00:41.409
[00:00:36.29]
Another great shortcut is if you hold

00:00:41.409 --> 00:00:43.639
Command on Mac or Ctrl in Windows, it will

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:46.149
[00:00:40.28]
change where you're drawing the shape from.

00:00:46.149 --> 00:00:49.440
[00:00:42.87]
Normally, you start drawing from one

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.899
corner outward, but if you hold Command or

00:00:52.899 --> 00:00:55.339
[00:00:48.66]
Ctrl, instead you will be drawing

00:00:55.339 --> 00:00:57.570
centered around your initial click.

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:58.920
[00:00:54.24]
That's particularly handy when

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.629
you are trying to draw circles.

00:01:00.629 --> 00:01:02.429
[00:00:56.49]
I'll release Command or Ctrl, and

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:04.309
I'll just drag out from the corner.

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:06.070
[00:01:00.85]
Before I release my mouse button, there

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:07.990
are other parameters I can change as well.

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:12.920
[00:01:04.11]
For example, the up and down cursors allow

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.090
you to change the rounding of the corners.

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.770
[00:01:11.79]
You can also hold the cursor down and you'll

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:20.159
get automatic increment of that rounding.

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:22.080
[00:01:16.03]
You can also use the left and

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.469
right cursors to toggle between an

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:26.240
[00:01:20.91]
un-rounded rectangle, rounding set

00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:29.469
to 0, and a fully rounded rectangle,

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:30.469
[00:01:25.38]
rounding set to 100%.

00:01:30.469 --> 00:01:33.180
[00:01:26.38]
I'm going to press the left cursor to

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.130
get back to my un-rounded rectangle, then

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:37.950
[00:01:32.37]
press my up arrow to add a

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:39.439
little bit of rounding to those edges.

00:01:39.439 --> 00:01:41.479
[00:01:36.01]
I'm going to hold the spacebar

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:43.159
just to center up my shape for now.

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:45.909
[00:01:39.46]
As soon as I release the mouse button,

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:48.280
this position and rounding has been set;

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:50.150
[00:01:44.71]
however, I can change those

00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:52.359
settings down in the Timeline panel.

00:01:52.359 --> 00:01:54.630
[00:01:49.13]
You'll see down here that we now have a

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.509
new layer called shape layer 1, and just

00:01:57.509 --> 00:01:59.229
[00:01:53.79]
like any layer, you can rename it.

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:02.409
[00:01:55.63]
I'll rename this rounded rectangle.

00:02:02.409 --> 00:02:05.760
[00:02:00.26]
Underneath its main twirly called

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:07.390
Contents, you will find something

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:09.220
[00:02:03.62]
called Rectangle 1.

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.680
[00:02:05.68]
That is the name of the shape group you

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:12.900
have created.

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.069
And again, you can rename

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:16.390
[00:02:10.38]
those, rounded rect.

00:02:16.390 --> 00:02:18.330
[00:02:12.57]
I'll twirl that open, and you'll

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:19.769
see what makes up the shape group.

00:02:19.769 --> 00:02:22.989
[00:02:16.61]
I have my path, in this case my

00:02:22.989 --> 00:02:26.069
rectangle, my stroke, the color I set at the

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:29.319
[00:02:21.85]
top, my fill, and I have individual

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:31.620
set of transform properties: Anchor,

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:34.370
[00:02:28.13]
Position, Scale, Skew--a new

00:02:34.370 --> 00:02:37.000
parameter--Rotation, and Opacity, which is

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.720
[00:02:33.19]
separate from the

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:41.680
transform for the entire layer.

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:43.290
[00:02:38.37]
This is where shape layers can be very

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:46.019
powerful and very confusing, because you

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:48.330
[00:02:42.39]
need to manage all these different settings.

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:50.549
[00:02:45.12]
It's best to focus on editing the

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:53.120
shape group and then later on if you want,

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:54.599
[00:02:49.56]
move the entire layer.

00:02:54.599 --> 00:02:56.030
[00:02:50.56]
Let's explore some of these

00:02:56.030 --> 00:02:57.480
components of my shape group.

00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.799
[00:02:53.73]
I'll twirl open Rectangle Path 1, and

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:01.750
again you can rename that if you wanted

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:02.750
[00:02:57.50]
to.

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:04.159
And here I have its size.

00:03:04.159 --> 00:03:06.020
Initially
its Aspect Ratio is maintained, but if I

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:08.120
[00:03:02.72]
want to change it, I can unclick the

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:11.299
Constrain Proportions lock and now edit its

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:12.760
[00:03:07.66]
dimensions independently.

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:16.950
[00:03:10.80]
The position of its path starts off

00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:19.730
centered in this group, but this group is

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:21.730
[00:03:16.05]
not necessarily centered in my

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:22.730
composition.

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:23.890
I'll show you that in a second.

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:25.670
[00:03:20.14]
And of course, we have the Roundness parameter

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:28.239
we were editing earlier using the cursor keys.

00:03:28.239 --> 00:03:30.220
[00:03:25.11]
Notice that all these have animation

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:32.040
stop watches, by the way.

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:33.040
Shape layers have

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:34.299
[00:03:28.84]
a lot of animation possibilities.

00:03:34.299 --> 00:03:36.110
[00:03:30.65]
I'll twirl that up.

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:39.459
[00:03:32.19]
With Stroke and Fill you can

00:03:39.459 --> 00:03:42.530
reorder objects inside a shape group.

00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:46.720
[00:03:39.08]
Right now Stroke is over the Fill, but

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.360
if I drag Fill above the Stroke, you can

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:52.060
[00:03:46.61]
see what's going on here in the Comp panel.

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:54.500
[00:03:48.53]
Now that red fill is going out to the

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:56.871
center line of the stroke, and you can

00:03:56.871 --> 00:03:58.910
[00:03:52.86]
see it's being drawn on top of the stroke.

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:01.609
So you can reorder those elements as desired.

00:04:01.609 --> 00:04:03.780
[00:03:57.51]
Here's the Blending mode pop-up you saw

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:05.379
earlier when we were playing with the

00:04:05.379 --> 00:04:07.310
[00:04:01.50]
Fill and Stroke options, and if you

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:08.680
twirl these open, you'll find lots of

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:10.069
[00:04:05.01]
additional options, which we'll

00:04:10.069 --> 00:04:11.859
go into more detail with later on.

00:04:11.859 --> 00:04:14.599
[00:04:08.90]
Finally, as I mentioned, each shape

00:04:14.599 --> 00:04:16.970
group has its own transform properties.

00:04:16.970 --> 00:04:18.780
[00:04:13.72]
We'll twirl that open for now.

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:21.220
[00:04:15.63]
This particular position value is the

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:24.650
offset from the center of the entire layer.

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:27.440
[00:04:21.60]
If I want to make sure that a shape

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:31.890
group is centered inside its layer, I need

00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:34.770
[00:04:28.31]
to zero these out, and I'll do that now.

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:36.190
[00:04:31.38]
This is something you'll find you need

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:37.970
to do quite often if you want to center

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:39.000
[00:04:33.99]
up a circle, a star,

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.420
et cetera, in your composition.

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:41.820
[00:04:36.98]
Go into the Transform for that

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:43.620
group and 0 out its position.

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:47.230
[00:04:39.89]
We also have Rotation, Skew,

00:04:47.230 --> 00:04:53.260
and the expected Scale and Opacity values.

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:56.310
[00:04:50.33]
Notice that this Scale value is

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:59.660
different from the rectangle's Size property.

00:04:59.660 --> 00:05:01.470
[00:04:56.34]
That's important because you can have

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:04.230
multiple paths inside one shape group,

00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:06.070
[00:05:01.12]
and we'll show that later on.

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:08.030
[00:05:02.84]
Also, Opacity is for the final

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:10.200
composite of everything in the shape group.

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:12.440
[00:05:06.94]
Yes, Stroke and Fill have their own

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:14.880
opacities, but this is the master opacity

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:17.250
[00:05:10.84]
for the shape group, not to be confused

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:20.820
with the layer's own opacity, which also

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:22.330
[00:05:17.05]
fades out the entire layer.

00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:25.600
[00:05:19.12]
Lots of flexibility, lots of power,

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:27.760
lots of room for confusion, so be very

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:29.380
[00:05:23.96]
mindful down in the Timeline panel,

00:05:29.380 --> 00:05:30.960
exactly what it is you're editing.

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:32.820
[00:05:27.58]
Are you inside a shape group

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:34.580
or editing an overall layer?

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:34.710
[00:05:42.00]
