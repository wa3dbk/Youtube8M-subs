Hey guys.

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:07.740
Dr. Axe here.

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:10.750
Doctor of functional medicine and founder
of DrAxe.com.

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:15.700
In this video, I'm going to share with you
the top tips on how to heal broken bones naturally.

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:21.710
And if you want to repair broken bones naturally,
you want to follow a very specific diet, supplement

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:27.300
regimen, lifestyle regimen, as well as use
certain essential oils and natural treatments

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.119
to help your body heal much, much faster.

00:00:29.119 --> 00:00:35.080
And I'll tell you, I've seen broken bones
heal two to three times faster by following

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:37.739
the tips I'm sharing with you in this video.

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:41.140
So number one, let's start with diet, and
the key nutrients you've got to be getting

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:44.140
in your diet in order to heal broken bones.

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:48.559
Number one, you need a lot of minerals, especially
calcium and magnesium.

00:00:48.559 --> 00:00:53.659
The best calcium rich foods are going to be
green, leafy vegetables and raw, fermented

00:00:53.659 --> 00:00:54.659
dairy products.

00:00:54.659 --> 00:01:00.280
So getting a lot of kale, and spinach, and
arugula, and chard and those green leafies,

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:01.690
even broccoli.

00:01:01.690 --> 00:01:03.299
Getting those in your diet is number one.

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:07.600
They're packed with calcium, and calcium is
the main mineral that helps make up strong

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:08.600
bones.

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:13.260
But in order for your body to even use calcium,
you also have to have magnesium.

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.710
And so, some magnesium rich foods are going
to be very similar.

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:21.450
Green leafy vegetables, raw, fermented dairy
products like goat's milk, kefir or raw goat

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:22.659
cheese.

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:27.189
Also though, magnesium rich foods may include
certain seeds, like flax seeds, chia, pumpkin

00:01:27.189 --> 00:01:30.259
seeds, grass fed beef are also good.

00:01:30.259 --> 00:01:33.859
So again, you want to get a lot of calcium
rich foods, magnesium rich foods.

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:37.060
Also, you want to get foods that are rich
in zinc.

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:42.189
Zinc foods again, are going to be grass fed
beef, pumpkin seeds, chia and flax seeds.

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:43.780
Very similar to the magnesium rich foods.

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:48.649
And then, also you want to be getting loads
of Vitamin C, and even things like fresh vegetable

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:49.649
juices.

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:57.540
Vitamin C rich foods can include orange juice,
true oranges, lemons, bell peppers, kiwis,

00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.200
broccoli, asparagus.

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:04.079
Those are foods that are packed with Vitamin
C. So make sure you're getting plenty of Vitamin

00:02:04.079 --> 00:02:05.079
C.

00:02:05.079 --> 00:02:11.180
So really your diet should consist of a lot
of veggies, some fruit, some organic meat,

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:12.570
some nuts and seeds.

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:16.100
And that should really be the bulk of your
diet as you're trying to heal, and get all

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:19.180
of those nutrients for building strong bones.

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:23.250
Now the foods you want to stay away from are
foods that tend to be overly acidic, conventional

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.330
meat and dairy products and alcohol.

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:30.480
You also want to stay away from excess sodium
and excess sugar.

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.000
Those will acidify your body.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.940
They'll actually leach those minerals out
of your body and really cause your bone growth

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:38.830
and healing to slow down.

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:46.390
Now, the top natural supplements for the treatment
of broken bones are going to be, number one,

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:48.610
taking a Vitamin D supplement.

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:51.240
If you have a broken bone, getting out in
the sun is ideal.

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:56.540
Getting direct sunlight, Vitamin D is really
important for bone growth.

00:02:56.540 --> 00:03:03.560
But if not, then taking 5,000 IUs twice a
day for three months of Vitamin D is crucial

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.450
to healing broken bones fast.

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:09.010
The other supplements you're going to take
along with magnesium and calcium supplements,

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:14.820
ideally is a magnesium chelate supplement,
so it would go to whole food form of magnesium.

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:18.200
Also, things that can help is a fish oil supplement.

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:24.680
Those omega three fats can reduce inflammation,
speed the healing process, as well as doing

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:26.360
a green super food powder.

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:31.870
Getting a green super food that has spirulina
and chlorella and other alkalizing fruits

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:33.200
and vegetables.

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:38.310
Very, very beneficial at actually healing
broken bones.

00:03:38.310 --> 00:03:44.730
The next step in healing broken bones fast
naturally, is going to be natural therapy,

00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:47.400
such as standing on a vibrational platform.

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:52.320
There are studies that show a vibrational
platform increases bone density, so you can

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:55.290
find vibrational platforms on line.

00:03:55.290 --> 00:04:00.150
Stand on those for 20 minutes, three times
a day and it naturally helps increase your

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:01.600
bone density.

00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:05.160
And it's doing that without major impact,
so again, vibrational platform.

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:06.160
Don't forget that.

00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:07.540
Some gyms also have them in the gym.

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:10.910
I know a lot of chiropractic offices that
have those as well.

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:13.310
So again, getting on a vibrational platform.

00:04:13.310 --> 00:04:18.320
Now, here are two other key things you can
do to heal broken bones fast.

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:21.220
The next one is use essential oils.

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:27.550
Three powerful essential oils for healing
broken bones, cypress oil, fur oil as well

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:28.980
as helichrysum oil.

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:34.270
And you want to make a blend, and put this
on your body, five to six times daily, is

00:04:34.270 --> 00:04:37.580
you're going to put directly on the broken
bone area.

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:43.819
You're going to go ahead and put cypress oil,
fur oil and helichrysum oil.

00:04:43.819 --> 00:04:48.770
Cypress oil really improves circulation in
the area, speeding the healing process.

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:53.289
Fur oil really works in helping the bone,
and you have helichrysum which actually helps

00:04:53.289 --> 00:04:57.270
in communication repairing damaged nerve tissue.

00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:02.229
So those three oils are the best oils for
helping heal broken bones using that in all

00:05:02.229 --> 00:05:04.669
of those areas, five to six times a day.

00:05:04.669 --> 00:05:07.900
And then, last but not least, getting acupuncture
treatment.

00:05:07.900 --> 00:05:12.779
We know acupuncture really works with your
body's meridians and different healing networks.

00:05:12.779 --> 00:05:19.550
And really transforming where sort of your
body energy is utilized and really supporting

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:22.270
your organs and repairing those damaged bones.

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:25.080
So again, I would recommend seeing an acupuncturist.

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:32.009
Oftentimes, somebody that does a five elements
acupuncture is very effective at the treatment

00:05:32.009 --> 00:05:33.810
of healing broken bones.

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:38.279
I promise you, if you do these tips, you're
going to see your broken bones heal faster

00:05:38.279 --> 00:05:39.279
than ever.

00:05:39.279 --> 00:05:44.249
