00:00:00.819 --> 00:00:05.979
This is the innovative Mountain Hardwear men's
Thermostatic jacket.

00:00:05.979 --> 00:00:10.870
Down jackets have long been celebrated for
their light weight compressibility, but they

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:16.810
do have some susceptibility to poor performance
should they become wet.

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:23.780
The thermostatic jacket uses some really neat
synthetic technology that does away with that

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:29.839
worry, but comes in at a weight and compressibility
that is highly competitive with down.

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:34.969
The Thermostatic jacket is insulated with
thermal Q elite.

00:00:34.969 --> 00:00:39.239
Thermal Q elite synthetic insulation mimics
the structure of down.

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:46.940
So it actually uses a combination of stiffer
and softer fibers resulting in really excellent

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.859
compressibility, but also nice loft and warmth.

00:00:49.859 --> 00:00:54.890
It is designed as a layering piece, not as
a cold weather jacket.

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:57.160
So it is fairly thinly insulated.

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:00.300
It has got 60 grams of that insulation.

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.879
Again, it makes this a great layering piece.

00:01:02.879 --> 00:01:08.860
And in cool temperatures, early fall, late
spring just an excellent stand alone piece

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:10.500
as well.

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:13.640
Pretty stream lined, cut to the jacket.

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:18.750
Again, fairly intentional in it being expected
that you would use it as a layering piece

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:23.080
putting heavier layers over it or a hard shell
jacket over top.

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:27.030
There are a couple of points of adjustability
here at either side of the hem.

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:29.540
So you have got dual adjustment points there.

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:34.909
As far as the cuffs are concerned, elastic
cuffs just a little bit of give there keeps

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:39.740
the sleeves from riding up and keeps them
in place.

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:43.909
Full length zipper on the Thermostatic jacket
so easy on, easy off.

00:01:43.909 --> 00:01:47.869
You don't have to just fight it over the top
of your head like you might on a half zip.

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:51.640
It does have two hand warmer pockets.

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:54.020
That is the only pocketing on the jacket.

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:59.840
This right pocket does allow you to stuff
the jacket inside of itself and zipper it

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:00.840
closed.

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:04.130
So you can store it in your pack, have it
ready at hand.

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:08.700
And again, makes it just a really nice go
to layering piece be that for back packing

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.020
or for every day cool weather use.
