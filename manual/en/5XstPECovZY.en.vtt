GREG HAREM: Another option of covering your
oasis in your container is horsetail, or its

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:11.740
proper name, Equisetum. You'll probably need
about, I'd say, a bunch and a half to two

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:19.400
bunches, depending on how thick the horsetail
is. Just kind of bounce it on the table, get

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:28.940
it all flat, and you need to cut off just
the very ends. Unfortunately with this, it

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:40.450
does get rather messy. Okay, just kind of
put it in your container. You want it up a

00:00:40.450 --> 00:01:00.670
little bit and cut again. And all you do is
insert it between the glass and the Oasis.

00:01:00.670 --> 00:01:10.119
It gives it kind of a bamboo kind of feel
to it, and you just kinda do this all the

00:01:10.119 --> 00:01:15.659
way around. You want to make sure it's very
tight 'cause this is what's going to hold

00:01:15.659 --> 00:01:21.399
your oasis into place so it's not sliding
around in your container. Considering how

00:01:21.399 --> 00:01:30.049
heavy tropicals can be, you definitely want
security. And I'm just going to throw the

00:01:30.049 --> 00:01:58.549
rest of 'em back here. Okay. Again, just chop
off. Oh, a little straggler there. Again,

00:01:58.549 --> 00:02:11.610
just keep stuffing the sides.
Then once all your sides are secure, you just

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:33.769
cut to the very rim or just a little bit above
the container. Again, it's just a nice way

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:35.420
to decorate your container.
