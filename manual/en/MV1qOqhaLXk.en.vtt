00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:09.540
Your scenes asked is a question about why don't chop players do that serve well here's a couple of reasons

00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:29.079
Because you have to bounce the ball on your side [of] the table you just can't hit the ball very

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:34.930
fast unlike in tennis where you can hit the ball straight over the net and the serves traveling at

00:00:35.629 --> 00:00:42.039
More than 200 K is an hour here. You've got to hit the ball a bit slower to get the ball on the table and

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:50.500
There really isn't a lot of area for the receiver to cover so with one step they can cover

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:56.830
The whole area of where you can serve to so it just isn't effective

00:00:57.049 --> 00:01:03.758
But some players you might see serving long, but they will use it as a surprise tactic

00:01:03.759 --> 00:01:08.289
So they will serve the fast one when the receiver isn't expecting it

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:16.209
But they're also getting good variation of Spin with that [far] serve and good variation of placement

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:18.500
so the long fast

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:25.599
Obvious topspin serve just doesn't cut it the only way you're going to get away with doing a fast topspin serve is

00:01:25.759 --> 00:01:27.879
if you use some disguise

00:01:28.429 --> 00:01:34.119
You might also see the top players do a good short topspin serve

00:01:37.009 --> 00:01:39.309
So what they're after here with that short

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:46.269
topspin serve is either to get the receiver to miss read the Spin and put it up higher so that they can attack it or

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:53.019
They are expecting the receiver to flick the ball. They're ready to counter that flick

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.840
you

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.110
