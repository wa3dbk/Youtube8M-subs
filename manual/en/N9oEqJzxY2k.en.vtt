00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:06.600
You're a new goalie parent and you're out there to select your child's first set of pads.

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:11.600
We have a flat-faced pad, and we have your more traditional hybrid pad, with knee rolls.

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:16.379
A hybrid pad with knee rolls will typically have a softer face in it, which

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:20.460
makes the puck hit it, and stay a little closer to the pad.

00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:23.860
The flat-faced pad will typically have a higher density foam

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:27.900
in through the face, so you have to direct the rebound where you want it to go.

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:32.789
Moving on-to the knee rolls of the pads, you'll notice that

00:00:32.789 --> 00:00:36.809
there's two different styles the breaks, this is a double break pad,

00:00:36.809 --> 00:00:41.600
Where this is a single break pad. A double break pad is going to be a little more flexible.

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:46.329
Having a double break pad will allow the five hole to seal up a little easier,

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:50.109
and the second break on-top will help bring the five hole in

00:00:50.109 --> 00:00:53.280
to give you a better seal along the ice with your butterfly.

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.979
the single break will change the top of
your house a little bit

00:00:56.979 --> 00:01:01.600
and the way the pad is going to seal the ice. When you go down you have to be a

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.710
little bit more flexible and flair out your leg

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:08.500
to get the same top of the house. Another
thing that you want to take a look at when selecting

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:11.830
pads is the strapping system on the back
of the pad.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:15.200
Here we have two different strapping setups,

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:20.130
this is your nylon strap, this is your
synthetic leather strap.

00:01:20.130 --> 00:01:25.800
The nylon straps are a little bit easier
with the young goalie because once you have them set up

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:29.520
it's just a quick clip. With the more
traditional

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.050
leather straps, you have to find the proper hole

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:37.680
and remember we want the two finger width technique on the back of the strap

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:40.400
to get that locked in place

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:43.550
Another point of difference that you'll see

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:46.860
on pads at the younger sizes is

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:50.920
the different styles of toe brick, this right here is a sliding toe brick.

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:55.040
It will actually slide when you're going down into your butterfly and in your VH

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:58.790
and allow you a little bit easier of a
push

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:05.300
as it's going to slide on the ice. This
is your standard traditional HD toe brick.

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:10.500
Basically has a piece of HD Foam that's going to sit directly on the cowling.

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.370
After we look inside the pad,

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:19.240
you'll notice a couple different styles of calf landing. Your calf landing and your knee

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:22.090
landing with this style of pad is gonna be brought right in

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:27.180
to the inside of the knee landing and the calf, giving you a little bit easier

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.060
slide-ability across the top of your crease when you're down in your butterfly.

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:34.560
The final thing I'm going to talk about, is the thigh wrap.

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.930
There are two different styles of thigh wrap here. this one here

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:41.970
has a little bit of added protecting through the inside of the knee

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:46.150
where they have this additional doughnut
on there. So when you go down in your butterfly

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:53.239
none of your kneecap is gonna be exposed. This is another version of a thigh wrap without the doughnut,

00:02:53.239 --> 00:02:56.390
it's going to be a little bit easier to
rotate on the pad.

00:02:56.390 --> 00:03:01.190
However when you go down, you may still be exposed on the inside of your knee cap.

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:04.730
From beginner to pro at Source for
Sports we have the right gear to get

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:06.000
your goalie into the game.

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:08.200
