Hey what's going on Youtube?

00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:04.859
This is El Tiro and today is tutorial Thursday.

00:00:04.859 --> 00:00:09.430
We're gonna give you a new popping dance concept
to add to your freestyle.

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:15.430
And today is really cool because we are gonna
be working on dimestops and hits which is

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:21.900
a core fundamental principle of the dimestop
pop.

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:34.500
So whether you have been dancing for a long
time or you are just learning how to hit,

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.600
this tutorial is something that you can always
fall back on because the fundamentals of poppoing

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:43.810
are never something you truly master and you
never practice again.

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:48.649
Dimestops is something that I practice every
single time I dance.

00:00:48.649 --> 00:00:53.620
And what I'm super super stoked about, I've
never done this before, I have partnered up

00:00:53.620 --> 00:01:00.280
with Where the Culture At into creating a
song strictly for practicing Dimestops.

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:05.049
So I'm gonna give that info to you at the
end of this video.

00:01:05.049 --> 00:01:06.140
So before that, let's get started.

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:09.810
So the first thing I want to you to practice
doing Dimestops is changing level.

00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:14.490
Now this, all these types of motions can be
very robotic and very, you know, simple, if

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.790
you break them one by one.

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:20.670
But the kind of change in levels that I want
you to do is have your knees just a little

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.900
bit out and you'll be practicing simple going
down and up.

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:31.810
Now remember dimestop, if you don't know what
that is it's actually the time where you pause

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:37.020
or freeze in a moment, typically, to snare,
bass or any sound that you want to.

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:41.250
It's often the most concept that you use when
you're doing robotics.

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:44.160
It's just multiple dimestops together.

00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:48.280
So it's about really concentrating and focusing
on your muscles on your body.

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:53.090
What we're gonna do, again one at time, our
feet like this and we're just gonna go down

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:54.630
and then a nice pause.

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:59.850
It's almost like a mini hit except not really,
you're not really trying to flex and hit.

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:03.600
You're really just trying to control your
muscles and you pause.

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.950
So I'll go down, clip up, clip.

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:08.450
So it's pretty simple.

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:11.500
Right here, I'm also gonna try leaning to
the left and right.

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:19.810
And I'll have my hands kinda switch like I'm
running so I'll go and also notice my legs,

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:23.189
I'm kinda shifting my knees so I got.

00:02:23.189 --> 00:02:25.290
We can combine this together.

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:34.049
Now when I move down, I'm gonna move my arms
up like this so I'm gonna go move to the right

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:36.189
move to the left.

00:02:36.189 --> 00:02:42.409
Now when doing robotic, one often position
is when you keep a straight flat back, your

00:02:42.409 --> 00:02:48.040
hands are to be kinda out, and I'm gonna actually
lean down keeping my legs straight and that

00:02:48.040 --> 00:02:51.309
would be a dimestop pop.

00:02:51.309 --> 00:02:54.109
Now again, all these are really simple.

00:02:54.109 --> 00:02:58.689
But when you're trying to dance, dimestops
is kind of the move that keeps everything

00:02:58.689 --> 00:03:00.839
relaxed, the cool, calmness of your dance.

00:03:00.839 --> 00:03:05.329
Now you don't wanna be all crazy, crazy all
the time, waving and trying to hit every single

00:03:05.329 --> 00:03:06.329
beat.

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:11.760
The dimestop is really where you break down
and you hit those kind of musicality beat.

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:17.580
Like this song has, its gonna have all these
types of intricacies, which you can hit when

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:18.669
you're doing your dimestop.

00:03:18.669 --> 00:03:24.639
So dancing to this dimestop song, you know,
as the beat goes boom, clap, wew wew wew wew.

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:28.260
So that's probably really annoying to hear
that.

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:29.279
I won't do that again.

00:03:29.279 --> 00:03:33.589
But if we're gonna match that with our kind
of dimestop practice, I'll be facing this

00:03:33.589 --> 00:03:35.730
side here with my arms out.

00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:40.319
And on that big bass clap, I'll switch my
levels.

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:46.349
And then my hands, I'm gonna have them go
up in increments every time of that wew wew

00:03:46.349 --> 00:03:49.109
wew wew wew boom clap.

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:58.939
And I can just practice going down wew wew
wew wew boom clap.

00:03:58.939 --> 00:04:08.449
Use that template to kinda explore all types
of different movements.

00:04:08.449 --> 00:04:23.680
So I can go
A couple of other examples of how you can

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:30.039
practice dimestops to this song is having
that mentality that you are a very mechanical

00:04:30.039 --> 00:04:31.039
robot.

00:04:31.039 --> 00:04:35.310
So I'm gonna be taking my leg, I'm gonna be
twisting my leg all the way out and all the

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:40.681
way in and every single step I'm gonna be
popping up so with that beat, if I'm kind

00:04:40.681 --> 00:04:50.110
of a robot like this so now I'm kind of a
squeezing my abs a little bit so I can have

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:52.970
a nice core balance or else I'm gonna be all
wobbly.

00:04:52.970 --> 00:04:58.280
When you're doing dimestops especially, you
have to be still, frozen in other parts of

00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:59.280
your body.

00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:11.301
So again, I can be like this, I can be as
up tall then that bass clap goes boom so that

00:05:11.301 --> 00:05:15.409
the whole point is I'm taking and isolating
only my leg.

00:05:15.409 --> 00:05:17.509
I'm using that to the dimestop.

00:05:17.509 --> 00:05:20.173
So really the sky is the limit with dimestops.

00:05:20.173 --> 00:05:24.169
It's all up in your creativity with the concept
and then you can move.

00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:26.949
So this is literally perfect for practicing.

00:05:26.949 --> 00:05:31.389
Make sure you're focused on every single beat
and after listening to it a couple of times,

00:05:31.389 --> 00:05:35.750
try hitting every single beat with the movement
and body part.

00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:38.599
