00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:07.189
Out of all the peg rides I am going to teach
you today, the icepick is my personal favorite.

00:00:07.189 --> 00:00:10.640
It involves a whole lot more balance than
the other ones I've talked about because it's

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:15.269
a grind only on your back peg with your front
wheel up. So essentially your balancing on

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:20.110
the back peg. It is sort of like a manual
actually except of rolling on your back wheel,

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:27.000
you are sliding on your back peg. It is one
of those tricks that you really need to know

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.029
what you are grinding on so that you can engage
your speed and figure out your body position.

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:34.800
Because if you are grinding something that
is realy slick, you dont want to be too far

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.690
back because you will loop out really easy.
You want your front end to be really low.

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:43.320
But at the same time if you are grinding something
like an unwaxed cement ledge, you want to

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:47.290
make sure that you are further back because
as you hit it and decelerate it, your front

00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:53.510
end is naturally going to want to drop. It
is one of those trick, this one more than

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:59.640
the other rides that we've talked about really
takes a lot of practice. It is going to take

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.500
you probably a good couple of weeks or so
before you start to figure out the balance

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:11.500
point and more than the balance how to balance
in a grind. The best thing I found for learning

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:17.369
how to use ice pick rides is a nice relaltive
low grind box you know 12 or 14 inches high

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:24.390
with a good bit of wax on it because it allows
you to focus more on your balance and pumping

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.990
with your legs like you would in a manual
so that you can maintain that balance point

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:31.740
for longer distances. Once you get all that
figured out, you can apply all those skills

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:37.240
that you've already learned in grinding all
different sorts of objects but at the same

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:41.590
time having a good foundation where you have
figured out your balance points, you've figured

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:46.119
out how to maintain that balance. That is
going to be really important being able to

00:01:46.119 --> 00:01:52.820
take this to other objects. So the main thing
with this is that you are going to want to

00:01:52.820 --> 00:02:00.080
pick up not too high as with any grind trick
and put your back wheel on your ledge or rail

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:04.211
or whatever it is you are grinding but you
don't do it too hard. If you do it too hard,

00:02:04.211 --> 00:02:10.169
that will force your front end down. As with
a manual when you land, you want to kind of

00:02:10.169 --> 00:02:16.319
squat back into it a ittle bit and that will
allow you to hold the front end up and when

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:20.629
it comes time to get the front end up, just
a little hop kind of like you are hopping

00:02:20.629 --> 00:02:26.669
out of a manual will get you right off of
whatever you are grinding. So the important

00:02:26.669 --> 00:02:31.002
base to have at this point pretty much is
feeble grinds and manuals because it is sort

00:02:31.002 --> 00:02:36.699
of a combination between the two of those
two tricks. you want to sort of figure out

00:02:36.699 --> 00:02:43.359
how a peg grind feels which comes from feeble
grinds but you want in execution, the icepick

00:02:43.359 --> 00:02:47.730
is always exactly like a manual actually so
you really want to make sure you have your

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:54.230
manuals and balance points really figured
out before you start trying this trick. If

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:57.109
you have any issues with the trick, maybe
you need to work on your manuals some more.
