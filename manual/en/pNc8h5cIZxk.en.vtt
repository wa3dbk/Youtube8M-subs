00:00:39.418 --> 00:00:41.419
- Welcome to the Victorian
Cosmetic Institute.

00:00:41.419 --> 00:00:43.352
My name's Doctor Gavin Chan

00:00:43.352 --> 00:00:47.407
and today I'll be
demonstrating jaw reshaping

00:00:47.407 --> 00:00:52.311
with a non-surgical technique
using anti-wrinkle injections.

00:00:52.311 --> 00:00:55.286
The actual name of the product we use

00:00:55.286 --> 00:00:57.747
I can't actually disclose

00:00:57.747 --> 00:01:00.131
due to regulations from the TGA.

00:01:00.131 --> 00:01:03.337
But it is a commonly used product

00:01:03.337 --> 00:01:06.702
for relaxing muscles in
the face, like the frown,

00:01:06.702 --> 00:01:09.599
used by millions of
people around the world.

00:01:09.599 --> 00:01:11.925
In this case, we'll be
using it in the jawline

00:01:11.925 --> 00:01:14.240
or more specifically
in the masseter muscle,

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.083
which is one of the muscles
responsible for chewing.

00:01:18.083 --> 00:01:20.071
If you just take a look at Michelle here,

00:01:20.071 --> 00:01:21.726
she's one of our receptionists,

00:01:21.726 --> 00:01:25.059
she actually has quite a strong jawline,

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:30.602
and a little bit of prominence
in the chewing muscles,

00:01:30.602 --> 00:01:32.744
the masseter muscle there.

00:01:32.744 --> 00:01:33.928
She suffers a little bit

00:01:33.928 --> 00:01:36.471
from teeth grinding, she says, at night.

00:01:36.471 --> 00:01:38.529
And that can be one of the contributors

00:01:38.529 --> 00:01:41.559
to a little bit of squareness in the jaw.

00:01:41.559 --> 00:01:43.295
Now Michelle would like to

00:01:43.295 --> 00:01:45.503
actually have it slimmed a little bit

00:01:45.503 --> 00:01:48.568
and we can do this by
a few simple injections

00:01:48.568 --> 00:01:51.424
into that muscle to help relax the muscle

00:01:51.424 --> 00:01:53.758
and slim the jawline down.

00:01:53.758 --> 00:01:58.492
It's a very popular procedure
because it gives the face

00:01:58.492 --> 00:02:02.659
a very slender appearance as
well as enhancing the cheeks.

00:02:03.997 --> 00:02:06.778
It also helps with medical
problems like teeth grinding,

00:02:06.778 --> 00:02:10.611
bruxism, and it can help
a lot with headaches.

00:02:11.872 --> 00:02:13.553
For people who grind their teeth a lot,

00:02:13.553 --> 00:02:14.865
they often get a lot of headaches,

00:02:14.865 --> 00:02:16.345
especially in the morning.

00:02:16.345 --> 00:02:21.035
So I'll give you a
demonstration of this procedure.

00:02:21.035 --> 00:02:23.601
Now, if we look at Michelle's face,

00:02:23.601 --> 00:02:27.984
she's actually got a prominence
in her chewing muscle,

00:02:27.984 --> 00:02:30.399
or the masseter muscle over here.

00:02:30.399 --> 00:02:32.503
If I could get you to clench your teeth.

00:02:32.503 --> 00:02:34.558
You can see that bulges out there.

00:02:34.558 --> 00:02:36.473
Relax, clench.

00:02:36.473 --> 00:02:39.074
That's quite a strong
bulging of that muscle there,

00:02:39.074 --> 00:02:41.992
which is actually widening the jawline.

00:02:41.992 --> 00:02:43.712
Also, clench your teeth again.

00:02:43.712 --> 00:02:46.336
You can see there's quite a
prominent temple muscle here,

00:02:46.336 --> 00:02:50.446
which is called the temporalis,
the temporalis muscle.

00:02:50.446 --> 00:02:52.992
This muscle is often treated as well

00:02:52.992 --> 00:02:56.642
in the case of people who
have migraines or headaches.

00:02:56.642 --> 00:02:59.505
This can often be a
cause of those headaches.

00:02:59.505 --> 00:03:03.017
But today we'll be focusing
on the masseter muscle,

00:03:03.017 --> 00:03:04.234
the muscle here.

00:03:04.234 --> 00:03:06.726
So the first step is
to mark out the muscle.

00:03:06.726 --> 00:03:08.226
Clench your teeth.

00:03:09.199 --> 00:03:10.586
Relax.

00:03:10.586 --> 00:03:11.868
Clench your teeth.

00:03:11.868 --> 00:03:12.701
Relax.

00:03:14.607 --> 00:03:16.194
Clench again.

00:03:16.194 --> 00:03:19.073
Now I'm just gonna put in a few dots

00:03:19.073 --> 00:03:21.823
where the muscle is quite strong.

00:03:25.058 --> 00:03:26.595
And the other side.

00:03:26.595 --> 00:03:28.204
Clench your teeth.

00:03:28.204 --> 00:03:29.300
Relax.

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:30.753
Clench your teeth.

00:03:30.753 --> 00:03:32.059
Interestingly, this side is

00:03:32.059 --> 00:03:34.976
not quite as powerful as the other.

00:03:36.127 --> 00:03:37.591
Now it's important also

00:03:37.591 --> 00:03:39.664
that when you place these injections,

00:03:39.664 --> 00:03:41.899
that I don't actually go

00:03:41.899 --> 00:03:44.203
into the muscle which causes her to smile.

00:03:44.203 --> 00:03:45.985
So can you just smile there, Michelle?

00:03:45.985 --> 00:03:48.243
There's a muscle which goes
from the corner of the mouth

00:03:48.243 --> 00:03:49.493
up to back here

00:03:52.075 --> 00:03:53.264
and if this muscle is hit,

00:03:53.264 --> 00:03:54.668
then you may get a little
bit of droop in the mouth.

00:03:54.668 --> 00:03:56.833
So we keep our injections pretty low.

00:03:56.833 --> 00:03:59.416
That's important when treating.

00:04:00.462 --> 00:04:03.311
Okay, now for the actual
injection process,

00:04:03.311 --> 00:04:05.598
there's a little bit
of discomfort involved.

00:04:05.598 --> 00:04:08.199
For those who are worried about

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:10.302
a little bit of injection discomfort,

00:04:10.302 --> 00:04:13.373
you can have some ice
or some numbing cream.

00:04:13.373 --> 00:04:16.568
Michelle today has had no anesthesia

00:04:16.568 --> 00:04:19.651
and we'll just ask her
afterwards how she felt.

00:04:19.651 --> 00:04:21.653
So give us another clench.

00:04:21.653 --> 00:04:24.514
Okay, here we go, a little scratch here.

00:04:24.514 --> 00:04:26.785
And it's quite quick.

00:04:26.785 --> 00:04:27.618
How was that, Michelle?

00:04:27.618 --> 00:04:28.586
Was that alright?
- It was fine.

00:04:28.586 --> 00:04:29.835
- [Dr. Chan] Yeah, was it painful?

00:04:29.835 --> 00:04:30.793
- No, it wasn't too bad at all.

00:04:30.793 --> 00:04:32.243
- Not to bad, yeah?

00:04:32.243 --> 00:04:33.743
Clench your teeth.

00:04:35.932 --> 00:04:37.015
And last one.

00:04:39.867 --> 00:04:41.367
Clench your teeth.

00:04:42.403 --> 00:04:44.367
Okay, right, so that's one side done.

00:04:44.367 --> 00:04:46.784
It's quite a quick procedure.

00:04:55.607 --> 00:04:58.672
So I finished the injections
in Michelle's face

00:04:58.672 --> 00:05:00.295
and there's a tiny bit of swelling

00:05:00.295 --> 00:05:02.886
but usually this subsides
in about half an hour.

00:05:02.886 --> 00:05:04.517
The other possibility
is that you might get

00:05:04.517 --> 00:05:08.231
a little bruise in the area treated.

00:05:08.231 --> 00:05:09.257
And usually that can be covered

00:05:09.257 --> 00:05:12.071
with a bit of concealer or make up.

00:05:12.071 --> 00:05:13.323
The results from the procedure

00:05:13.323 --> 00:05:15.809
actually take about two months to work,

00:05:15.809 --> 00:05:19.371
unlike other parts of the face
where we use this product,

00:05:19.371 --> 00:05:21.858
where it usually takes two weeks to work.

00:05:21.858 --> 00:05:24.145
And what Michelle will notice is

00:05:24.145 --> 00:05:26.855
reduced bulk in the sides of her face

00:05:26.855 --> 00:05:28.180
and a slimming of the face

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:31.639
to make her face appear more
like an upside down triangle.

00:05:31.639 --> 00:05:35.056
I think this will be quite a nice change,

00:05:36.073 --> 00:05:40.240
enhance her cheeks, and
slim the jawline a little.

00:05:42.408 --> 00:05:45.635
So in summary, this procedure will,

00:05:45.635 --> 00:05:49.089
it's a relatively quick
and simple procedure.

00:05:49.089 --> 00:05:51.503
It takes a month or two to work,

00:05:51.503 --> 00:05:53.830
and it usually lasts for about six months

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:56.020
or even longer in some cases.

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:58.157
But it does require periodic re-injection.

00:05:58.157 --> 00:06:02.324
So if you're looking to
reduce the size of the jaw

00:06:04.304 --> 00:06:06.400
and improve the shape of the jaw,

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:08.761
this is a good non-surgical procedure,

00:06:08.761 --> 00:06:11.786
which doesn't require
any cutting or stitching

00:06:11.786 --> 00:06:13.859
and it takes about five to 10 minutes

00:06:13.859 --> 00:06:16.859
and works quite well in most people.
