\f0\fs24 \cf0 Face Yoga Method. Have you ever
wondered how to lift up your cheeks as gravity

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:09.953
works against them? When you learn how to
isolate the muscles in your face you can easily

00:00:09.953 --> 00:00:10.970
tone and firm your cheeks. In this video Fumiko
Takatsu, Face yoga expert, shows you how to

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:12.330
exercise, lift up and firm your cheek muscles.Hi
I am fumiko from the Face yoga method. Jane

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:20.289
asked me how to lift up the cheeks with face
yoga exercise. This is a great question because

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:30.730
as you know gravity is working against us
and everything is going down. In this video

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:38.310
I want to show you a very simple face yoga
exercise you can do any time anywhere. I love

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:46.190
to do this one when I am jogging or running
so my cheeks don\'92t go down. First slightly

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:54.510
move your chin forward. Then slightly move
your lips up and over your teeth. Smile and

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:05.549
lift up the corners of your mouth. Push your
tongue against the roof of the mouth and hold

00:01:05.549 --> 00:01:23.180
for ten seconds. Let\'92s do it again. Chin
forward, curl your lower lip, smile, lift

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:36.370
up the corners of your mouth. Chin up. Make
sure and do the tongue push up. By adding

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:42.810
the tongue to the pose it really helps to
lift up your cheeks and tone your neckline.

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:51.500
