00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:04.250
Why?

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:08.420
Why did I let you leave?

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:10.540
Why? Why?

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:12.540
Why did I let you go?

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:14.210
Why?

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:18.690
Why did I cry after that?

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.360
Why am I crying like such a fool?

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:23.950
I don’t know ~

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:26.700
But I ...

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:31.380
still want to tell you ..

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:35.590
to come back to me ~

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:40.550
I really didn't want to let you go ~

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:42.760
Oh. Why?

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:44.840
Why does the stupidity ..

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.270
still remain in my heart?

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:49.790
Why do I cry like this ..

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:52.330
whenever I watch childish television drama?

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:54.780
Your heart that left doesn't know now ~

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.450
There is nothing between you and me now ~

00:00:57.450 --> 00:00:58.880
I can't accept it ~

00:00:58.890 --> 00:00:59.910
I can't believe it ~

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.370
The unforgettable memories of you are so many ~

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:05.260
I, who learned that your heart has become so far away ~

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.420
was shocked by the incident ~

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:09.580
That never showed up ~

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:12.340
even in my dreams or my imagination ~

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:13.380
What am I to do now?

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:14.760
Will I be able to go on living?

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.100
Can I do even if my reason to live is gone?

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.190
I keep sinking in those dark worries ~

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:22.450
Time doesn't seem to pass without you here ~

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.130
Why?

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:28.300
Why did I let you leave?

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.420
Why? Why?

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:32.420
Why did I let you go?

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.090
Why?

00:01:34.830 --> 00:01:38.570
Why did I cry after that?

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:41.240
Why am I crying like such a fool?

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.830
I don’t know ~

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.580
But I ...

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:51.260
still want to tell you ..

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:55.470
to come back to me ~

00:01:57.620 --> 00:02:00.430
I really didn't want to let you go ~

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.690
Oh. Why?

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:04.200
For your softness ~

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:06.380
For worrying about giving you wounds ~

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.030
For knowing that you can't leave me ~

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:10.220
I made a decision ..

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.720
that I would let you go first ~

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.210
Seeing your sadness when you're with me ..

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:17.690
made me think that I would rather ..

00:02:17.690 --> 00:02:20.190
see you laughing by another person's side ~

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:22.670
So I let you go like that ~

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:23.600
Where are you?

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:24.600
Where did you go to?

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.740
Where is the first place you may go to?

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:29.580
Are you happy in that place?

00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.440
Don't you miss me by any chance?

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:34.910
Or am I just expecting too much?

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:37.690
Then why do I keep looking at my phone?

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:38.870
I'm the one who let you go ~

00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:40.210
I drove you away from me ~

00:02:40.210 --> 00:02:42.410
Then why it's me who's waiting desperately?

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:45.530
Why am I like this?

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:50.840
Love is not to remain forever ~

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:54.470
I try ~

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:57.090
I keep trying ~

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:01.970
But why aren't you getting further away?

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:03.830
Oh. Why?

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:08.340
Why did I let you leave?

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:10.460
Why? Why?

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:12.460
Why did I let you go?

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:14.130
Why?

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:18.610
Why did I cry after that?

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:21.280
Why am I crying like such a fool?

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:23.870
I don’t know ~

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:26.620
But I ...

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:31.300
still want to tell you ..

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:35.510
to come back to me ~

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:40.470
I really didn't want to let you go ~

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:44.520
Oh. Why?
