00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:10.370
I think he hit a reset button for the fall
campaign. Everything changes. It's almost

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:17.370
like an Etch-A-Sketch, you can kind of shake
it up and we start all over again.

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:27.509
When Mitt Romney was CEO of Bain Capital,
Bain invested in a series of companies, including

00:00:27.509 --> 00:00:33.760
call centers and manufacturers, that expanded
overseas, sometimes at the expense of American

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:37.290
workers.
That plant went bankrupt, the 750 workers

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.969
were laid off and Bain did make millions of
dollars in profits.

00:00:40.969 --> 00:00:47.969
What he did do was add $750 million in fees,
which is just another way that the government

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:54.609
collects money like taxes.
If Mitt Romney's an economic heavyweight,

00:00:54.609 --> 00:00:59.649
we're in trouble, because he was 47th out
of 50 in job creation in the state of Massachusetts

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:06.649
when he was governor.
I was a severely conservative Republican governor.

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:12.200
The natural disclosure forms reveal that he
and his wife have had millions of dollars

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:15.799
in offshore funds, in the Cayman Islands and
elsewhere.

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:21.439
Romney has gone to great lengths to keep secret
many important details about his wealth, including

00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:28.439
whether he uses tax loopholes available only
to the super rich.

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:35.060
The plan proposed by Romney's new running
mate Paul Ryan to turn Medicare into a voucher-like

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.850
system.
It would cost Medicare patients an average

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:44.850
of $6400 in out-of-pocket expenses.
Romney's proposal would provide large tax

00:01:48.009 --> 00:01:54.799
cuts to high-income households, and increase
the tax burdens on middle and/or lower-income

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:56.109
taxpayers.
