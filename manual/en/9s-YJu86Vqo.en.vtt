00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.970
These are what are called piano accordions.

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:14.060
Most accordions have this really cool boxy
shape, also affectionately called squeeze

00:00:14.060 --> 00:00:15.160
boxes.

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:21.910
Basically what an accordion is is a series
of bellows that are compressed, pushed, or

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:27.599
pulled and allow air into the instrument that
crosses over a valve through a reed that then

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:31.390
produces a vibration inside the instrument
that creates the sound.

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:35.860
So, by pushing or pulling I allow air into
the instrument.

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:42.920
Then by pressing a button the sound is created.

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:45.780
Many accordions have different reed options.

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:52.210
This one in particular, this brand is called
Main Squeeze, has five options for reeds.

00:00:52.210 --> 00:01:14.160
Starting lowest with the bassoon, the bandoneon,
the master, the violin, and the clarinet.

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:19.020
On the left hand side of the instrument we
have a set series of chords that are always

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.050
the same on every instrument.

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:24.349
Some instruments have a greater number of
bass notes than others.

00:01:24.349 --> 00:01:25.599
This is a 48 bass.

00:01:25.599 --> 00:01:29.190
They go all the way up to, I think the standard
is 120.

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:32.369
There are some that are bigger, but those
are really huge instruments.

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.560
The 120 usually being the top that you would
ever use to play.

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:43.490
These are set up in a chord fashion with major,
minor, seventh, and diminished chords.

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:51.400
Major, minor, seventh, and diminished chords.

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:53.700
The first row being closest to the bellows.

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.030
The counter bass being a third.

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:59.950
It's a pretty cool instrument.

00:01:59.950 --> 00:02:01.640
Basically a one man band.

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:05.399
You can play everything that you need to with
both hands and accompany yourself on this

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:05.469
instrument.
