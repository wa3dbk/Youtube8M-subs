00:00:08.869 --> 00:00:13.779
when you go on safari you're there to see
animals in their natural habitat to

00:00:13.779 --> 00:00:16.049
experience that life and to

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.809
connect with them in in a different way
than you would be able to at a Zoo or

00:00:20.809 --> 00:00:22.839
watching a TV special

00:00:22.839 --> 00:00:28.039
the challenge is that sometimes the way
that you experience their lives

00:00:28.039 --> 00:00:30.670
uh... can be extremely uncomfortable

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:32.910
uh... but incredibly powerful

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:36.280
this video showcases one of those
experiences for me and it happened on

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:37.540
my first safari

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:40.810
which was in South Luangwa in Zambia.

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:44.730
So, basically what happened is that this
hippo had fallen and injured itself

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.720
and apparently broken its legs at some
point

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:50.040
the previous night

00:00:50.040 --> 00:00:53.450
so when the day came it was unable to
walk back down into the water like they

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:55.120
normally do

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:58.620
and we spotted it early that morning as
we were making our rounds and doing our day

00:00:58.620 --> 00:00:59.730
safari

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:01.780
and circled back to it that evening

00:01:01.780 --> 00:01:06.860
and right as we pulled up a leopard had just
finished starting to

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.090
feed on the hippo

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.060
it was still all bloody and walked a
about twenty feet away and then laid

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:13.960
down

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:17.070
and uh... and started to clean its paws

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.480
there were two hyena at that point
that had smelled blood and come in to

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:22.150
see what was going on

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:27.780
and one of them approach to kind of seek
approval before then moved in

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:32.100
what made this a very difficult kill is
that it wasn't a clean kill

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.720
this hippo had injured itself but it was
still very much live

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:40.270
unfortunately all it could do was stand
up on its front legs

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:44.180
uh... and it couldn't do anything beyond that

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:48.910
the leopard had had watched it and figured this out and
so had approached and one of two soft

00:01:48.910 --> 00:01:53.470
so had approached in one of two soft spots on a hippo, and hippos have incredibly thick hides so they're almost bulletproof

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:57.080
within the animal kingdom

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:00.490
but they have two weak points and one is
underneath the neck and other is right

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:01.980
underneath its tail

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:05.620
and so the leopard had gone in and figured out
where the range of motion was for this

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:07.670
hippo and had started to feed

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.030
on this hippo underneath the tail

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:12.790
the hyena zeroed in on the point where
the

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:14.320
the leopard had opened

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:18.239
the hippo up and then they began to eat and
that's the footage you're seeing

00:02:18.239 --> 00:02:22.029
and it was it was really rough because
at first we thought the hippo was probly

00:02:22.029 --> 00:02:24.290
paralyzed and hopefully couldn't feel it

00:02:24.290 --> 00:02:27.779
uh... it didn't make any sounds or noise but

00:02:27.779 --> 00:02:31.539
as you can see uh... at one point it
does end up actually standing up in

00:02:31.539 --> 00:02:33.069
response

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:36.180
so while it's hard to know how much was
feeling

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:39.809
uh... it does look like he was probably
suffering some

00:02:39.809 --> 00:02:44.279
and from a,. from uh... humanistic
standpoint you really feel like you need

00:02:44.279 --> 00:02:48.239
to step in like you know this hippo obviously isnt going to survive

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:50.449
can we shoot it, can we do something

00:02:50.449 --> 00:02:51.679
and uh...

00:02:51.679 --> 00:02:55.439
the difficult reality is that you're there and you're not,

00:02:55.439 --> 00:02:58.269
you're not allowed to interfere in any
way shape or form and that that's the

00:02:58.269 --> 00:02:59.909
right course of action

00:02:59.909 --> 00:03:02.620
uh... but it really makes it that much more difficult

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:07.109
the up side that really kind of offset
that difficult experience

00:03:07.109 --> 00:03:10.419
was that over the following two and a half days we watched a circle of

00:03:10.419 --> 00:03:13.169
life come full circle

00:03:13.169 --> 00:03:14.199
so, luckily

00:03:14.199 --> 00:03:18.699
the hippo was dead by the following morning
and hopefully had blead out and and and

00:03:18.699 --> 00:03:20.510
had died fairly quickly

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:24.549
but when we circle back around we saw
hyena starting to feed and they would eat

00:03:24.549 --> 00:03:28.009
until they were so fat they look
pregnant and could barely move

00:03:28.009 --> 00:03:31.139
uh... and then the vultures started to
move in and I expected the corpse to

00:03:31.139 --> 00:03:35.180
stink and to start or rot and to fester
and to be there for a long period of

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:36.219
time

00:03:36.219 --> 00:03:39.679
uh... but amazingly within a about
two-and-a-half days

00:03:39.679 --> 00:03:40.849
every

00:03:40.849 --> 00:03:44.439
piece of tissue had been picked clean
and all that was left with was

00:03:44.439 --> 00:03:45.789
the skull

00:03:45.789 --> 00:03:47.319
and spinal column

00:03:47.319 --> 00:03:50.379
and so this one hippo had fed

00:03:50.379 --> 00:03:53.439
i would imagine at least a hundred
and fifty animals

00:03:53.439 --> 00:03:58.289
uh... and had really perpetuated the circle
of life so it was an incredibly incredibly rich

00:03:58.289 --> 00:04:01.589
experience but an incredibly difficult
experience

00:04:01.589 --> 00:04:03.729
and uh... i wouldn't trade it for the
world

00:04:03.729 --> 00:04:06.939
but even watching this footage now it
really it makes me a little bit queasy
