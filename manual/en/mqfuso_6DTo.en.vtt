00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:06.710
What's up guys?

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:08.390
Jeff Cavaliere, ATHLEANX.COM.

00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:10.710
So today I want to do something a little bit
different.

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.470
I want to start with a story.

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:18.400
Back in 2007 in the off season I would train
David Wright when I was with the New York

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:19.400
Mets.

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:23.110
And we would head to, we'd try to do something
different, we'd try do some aspect of cross

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:24.110
training

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:26.870
that would get him away from Baseball and
actually get him away the weight room.

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:32.000
And one year we decided we were going to Box,
we were going to start taking up Boxing in

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.000
New York City.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.019
So he hooked me up with this gym that I swear
to God to you, I shit you not, the guys name

00:00:38.019 --> 00:00:39.019
was Mickey.

00:00:39.019 --> 00:00:41.750
He was about 75 years old, he was our trainer.

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:45.429
He was bent over at the waist, like a 90 degree
angle.

00:00:45.429 --> 00:00:50.329
And he was our guy who was going to take us
through and make us quicker on our feet, more

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:51.329
powerful, more explosive,

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:54.339
whether or not we ever wanted to be a Boxer
or not.

00:00:54.339 --> 00:00:58.989
And the thing I remember the most about Mickey
and his training was the very first day we

00:00:58.989 --> 00:00:59.989
were there,

00:00:59.989 --> 00:01:05.610
he put me through this ridiculous Ab routine
on here, on the Captain's chair that I still

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.080
remember and have nightmares about every day.

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:12.540
So I thought well if I'm still having nightmares
about it, why not share those nightmares with

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:13.540
you.

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:18.430
So I'm going to take you through, right now
the exact routine that I did with Mickey to

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:20.950
become better, get Abs like a Boxer.

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:21.950
So enjoy!

00:01:21.950 --> 00:02:07.610
And make sure guys you give this one a try.

00:02:07.610 --> 00:03:36.380
So there you have it guys.

00:03:36.380 --> 00:04:08.850
It kicks my ass today just as much as it did
years ago.

00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:09.850
And guess what?

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:11.340
That was only the first round.

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:13.720
We had to go through that thing 4 times.

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:15.390
Do as many as you can.

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:19.030
The bottom line is that's a bitch of a Workout
there.

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:20.079
You don't even need the Captain's Chair.

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:23.840
I always talk about it guys, if you've got
a kitchen counter, you can do it right in

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:24.840
the corner.

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:27.150
Just put your hands down, get your knees up
and start doing the same exercise.

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:31.620
Guys if you're looking for Workouts that you
can do either in the gym with equipment like

00:04:31.620 --> 00:04:32.940
this or at home.

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:33.940
There's no excuses.

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:37.370
ATHLEANX.COM guy, I've got you covered with
our ATHLEANX Training System.

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:40.439

00:04:40.439 --> 00:04:41.970
punishment every now and then,

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:44.979

up below and I'll make sure that I do more

00:04:44.979 --> 00:04:45.979
