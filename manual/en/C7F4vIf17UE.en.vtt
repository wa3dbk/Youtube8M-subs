00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:06.900
The sun was setting as Deb and Dusty Jones
of rural Pittsburg rounded the corner and

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:13.920
quietly fished the last pool of the strip-mine
lake at the Mined Land Wildlife Area headquarters.

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:19.030
The light and the calm were magic, portraying
the beauty of a Norman Rockwell scene as mom

00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:25.900
and son fished with scarcely a ripple. On
a hot summer day, no one else was there. It

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:30.660
was the kind of moment you wished you were
in, rather than simply watching.

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:35.650
The past few hours, these two had explored
the nooks and crannies of this easily accessible

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:41.730
strip-mine lake, catching bass and sunfish,
throwing them back. Nothing fancy – mom

00:00:41.730 --> 00:00:47.130
rowing for her 8th grade son in the lightweight
boat they used to fish almost exclusively

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:53.489
in Mined Land waters. Often, they fished lakes
near Weir and West Mineral among the sprawling

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:59.710
Mined Land units. I sat and waited, not wanting
to break the spell until they landed and made

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:01.760
preparations to leave.

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:06.520
For Dusty, it was his first time to catch
a channel catfish on a lure, and he brought

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:11.979
it to the ramp for a picture before releasing
it. He caught this fish on a Berkeley gulp

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:18.490
minnow trailing an in-line spinner. But he
normally fishes a slower pace using a 7-1/2

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:21.219
inch salted worm. Here’s how he does it:

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:27.240
“I just basically throw it out and let it
sink to the bottom and just bring it along.

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:34.609
And I let it fall. And once I feel a fish,
I just yank the hook and try to set the hook

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:35.609
in him.”

00:01:35.609 --> 00:01:40.219
Mom likes to take her son, even though she
usually gets to do most of the work:

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:49.030
“We go all around and go fishing everywhere.
He likes it more, but I don’t mind going

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:53.249
so much, and doing all the work, the oars,
the rowing and all that, but it’s been fun.

00:01:53.249 --> 00:02:02.100
It’s something to do in the summer time,
and having fun. He loves to fish though.”

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:09.800
I couldn’t help but think. That was me long
ago. Maybe it was you. Fishing with dad, or

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:17.610
mom, or grandpa. I wouldn’t trade my memories,
and the one day, the Jones’s won’t either.

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:24.140
A quiet evening on a Kansas public land, catching
fish and making memories. And for this day

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:29.700
at least, the sun pulls the curtain on something
truly special.

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.390
I’m Mike Blair for Kansas Wildlife and Parks.
