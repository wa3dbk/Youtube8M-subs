00:00:00.729 --> 00:00:04.920
Hi, my name is Dave Webb from Venture Caravans, and I just wanted to show you round our

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.810
Adria Matrix Axess

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:09.759
it's on the Fiat Ducatto

00:00:09.759 --> 00:00:15.130
engine, two point three this is
with the 130 break horse power

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:18.699
euro five.

00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:23.220
This motor home isn't particularly long, it's 5.99 meters long.

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.119
So although it's a coach built, It's probably one of the smallest around.

00:00:29.109 --> 00:00:31.619
So it's good for nipping in and around

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:37.000
the smaller country towns etc.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.320
Just take you round the back here,

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.130
Nicely styled lights it's got a polyester body shell so,

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:46.900
dent resistant and damage resistant

00:00:46.900 --> 00:00:51.040
You've got this locker space here which gives you access into the 

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:52.950
kitchin area at the back

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:59.950
we will see that from the inside

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.150
here at the back you can see the kitchen.

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:09.790
You've got a 4 burner hob there.

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:11.650
Nice domestic style, 

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:13.390
chrome effect tap,

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:15.590
and which is metal.

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:16.590
A nice sink

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:20.600
with a cover over the top.

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.340
Which neatly hides it,

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:25.060
The same with the burners as well, they can be hidden so you've just got a glass top and finishes

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:27.720
the styling of it.

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.130
You've got some cupboards and draws underneath, this cupboard

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:32.159
goes into the garage area,

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:35.880
so you've got access from both inside and outside,

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.320
and this one has a

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.190
large draw which you can pull out

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:42.260
to store your pots and pans and everything else you might want too

00:01:42.260 --> 00:01:44.690
put in there.

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:49.720
You've got some lovely styling touches, the lighter wood effect on the cupboards,

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:54.080
the chrome effect handles.

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:56.780
Push button closing,

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:00.850
a nice bit of storage space in there, and there's nice contrast on the 

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:03.540
wood underneath, it's got a slightly beach feel too it.

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:10.540
Not beach wood but beach drift wood type feel.

00:02:11.049 --> 00:02:14.399
Again they've put little bits of cupboard space
Adria tend to use the space they've got

00:02:14.399 --> 00:02:16.149
so where ever they can 

00:02:16.149 --> 00:02:20.199
find the space they'll use it to give
you some shelving or some other options.

00:02:20.199 --> 00:02:23.259
You've got your color

00:02:23.259 --> 00:02:27.469
digital display up here which is touch button, that's for your 12v power and for turning on the water pump etc.

00:02:27.469 --> 00:02:29.599
Door fly screen

00:02:29.599 --> 00:02:32.309
from this model because this model is fitted with the extra 

00:02:32.309 --> 00:02:35.749
pack which includes the door fly screen and the sites door. 

00:02:35.749 --> 00:02:39.529
the door fly screen and the sites door. 

00:02:39.529 --> 00:02:43.359
As I go round here you can see we've got a microwave

00:02:43.359 --> 00:02:45.349
As I go round here you can see we've got a microwave

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:51.069
down here, with a wardrobe above.

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:58.069
Nice bit of hanging space.

00:03:01.029 --> 00:03:05.159
Good seating area, it's got plenty of space for seating on there

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:11.779
The two chairs at the front swivel round as well, to open up the space again.

00:03:11.779 --> 00:03:14.849
Fly screens and blinds throughout and some good

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:16.339
windows

00:03:16.339 --> 00:03:18.159
good sized windows 

00:03:18.159 --> 00:03:21.859
to allow plenty of lighting including one over the carriage, it's a nice big panoramic style window.

00:03:24.029 --> 00:03:27.949
Even at the front here you've got lots of storage

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:31.119
going around.

00:03:31.119 --> 00:03:34.279
Again, giving you as much as we can where we can.

00:03:34.279 --> 00:03:38.379
We've got blown air heating coming out of the top here, it's got the Trumus 6 Electirc

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:44.049
heating system and gas heating system.

00:03:44.049 --> 00:03:45.999
Big table so when you swing the chairs round

00:03:45.999 --> 00:03:50.579
you've got plenty of room to eat.

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:54.719
there's also a piece underneath, there.

00:03:54.719 --> 00:03:57.929
I think I can just quite capture that but that swings out to make the table even bigger.

00:03:57.929 --> 00:03:59.289
You'll see the solid construction

00:03:59.289 --> 00:04:06.289
that Adria use, they always put solid legs on everything.

00:04:08.969 --> 00:04:10.389
And as we go just

00:04:10.389 --> 00:04:14.290
towards the back again you've got this
big fridge here

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:18.199
dometic fridge, push button

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:21.839
display with a big freezer compartment
inside,

00:04:21.839 --> 00:04:25.819
so good for good long tours.

00:04:25.819 --> 00:04:29.100
They have been very clever with the space.

00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:32.139
Further back we have the shower compartment here in the toilet

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:34.540
compartment,

00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:37.919
nice space on the floor there plenty
of room.

00:04:37.919 --> 00:04:39.120
The curve toilet

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.800
there from fetford with electric flush

00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:46.039
It's curved so the water just cascades off the top of it without

00:04:46.039 --> 00:04:46.849
actually sitting there.

00:04:46.849 --> 00:04:53.849
You've also got easy clean with the toilet seat that comes right the way out.

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:58.099
Mirror drop down sink here,

00:04:58.099 --> 00:05:01.620
again making the most of the space and

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:07.949
really opening it up.

00:05:07.949 --> 00:05:09.849
The shower rail.

00:05:09.849 --> 00:05:15.909
Light above and then roof light and hanging space. So if 

00:05:15.909 --> 00:05:18.249
you do get your wet coats, which hopefully you wont,

00:05:18.249 --> 00:05:19.869
you've got somewhere to hang them.

00:05:19.869 --> 00:05:22.599
Maybe it would be wet suits instead, that would be nicer.

00:05:22.599 --> 00:05:25.639
Doing a bit a surfing.

00:05:25.639 --> 00:05:28.539
Plenty of blown air ducting so it heats

00:05:28.539 --> 00:05:31.650
the motor home all over.

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:35.710
the unique feature of this motor home.

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:37.409
perhaps it's not to be fair,

00:05:37.409 --> 00:05:40.259
it's not unique but it's

00:05:40.259 --> 00:05:44.400
not often seen in motor homes, is that you can drop this part down which is your bed,

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:46.139
so you've got a double bed

00:05:46.139 --> 00:05:48.449
which is fittied in the roof

00:05:48.449 --> 00:05:51.020
and drops down to

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:54.319
your sleeping arrangements, I'll just see if I could capture that by putting it on the side here

00:05:54.319 --> 00:06:01.319
and showing you through how that works. It's got a handle up the top here, which you pull, and then this whole section just drops right the way down.

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:10.900
You do have to take head rests off, so it comes down completely, but you get the idea from that.

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:13.939
It's not too difficult to do, the head rests come off very easily.

00:06:13.939 --> 00:06:17.389
And it does make the best of the space

00:06:17.389 --> 00:06:22.009
giving you a large lounge

00:06:22.009 --> 00:06:25.990
and then giving you the bed above.

00:06:25.990 --> 00:06:31.720
It's a very clever system from Adria.

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:34.770
I'll just have a pan around just so you can get a good look with out me talking over it.
