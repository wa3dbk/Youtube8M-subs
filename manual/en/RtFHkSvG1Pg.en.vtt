00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:03.180
Have you ever wondered what "shipping" and "fanfiction" are?

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:05.620
If you have never heard of those things before,

00:00:05.629 --> 00:00:06.809
forget about this video...

00:00:06.809 --> 00:00:08.360
and RUN!

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:09.720
You have been warned.

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:12.300
Fan fictions are stories, videos or pictures

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:14.530
in which existing personas or characters

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:18.140
are implanted into alternate universes or storylines.

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:21.570
Mostly, they are about friendship, drama, heart-rending love

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.260
and straight up sex.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.840
There are fanfictions about almost everything and anything

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:29.780
for example of the Star Trek universe, of Harry Potter or thr Simpsons

00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:34.620
and of course also about real people like actors... or youtubers.

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.240
But  what is "shipping"? Sounds like shipping charges.

00:00:38.249 --> 00:00:41.559
Well, "shipping" actually derives from the fanfiction-scene.

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:43.479
It is about a fan's wish

00:00:43.479 --> 00:00:45.269
that two or more characters

00:00:45.269 --> 00:00:47.329
- real life or fiction -

00:00:47.329 --> 00:00:49.669
are in an emotional relationship with each other.

00:00:49.669 --> 00:00:52.620
The fan who has this wish is caled a "shipper".

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:55.079
The word comes from "relationSHIP" or "friendSHIP"

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.059
and means every possible - and impossible kind of relationship:

00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:05.120
May it be kinship, friendship, romantically, erotic, sodomitical or even of objectophillic nature.

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:09.180
Everything is acceptable in terms of gender and sexualities.

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:11.560
Shipping can also be about friendships

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:13.460
which is then called "friendshipping".

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.850
More common are stories about romance and - alright, who am I trying to fool here?

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.640
Kinky fetish and sexual intercourse!

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.980
Shippers usually orient themselves by their own fantasies

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:25.799
and not by the characters' actual interests

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:30.419
or cultural norms - which can be quite disturbing in case of real people.

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:34.530
This is also how very unlikely or absurd shippings come to life, like "Drapple",

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:37.220
describing a relationship of whatever nature

00:01:37.220 --> 00:01:40.680
between Draco Malfoy and an apple.

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:43.980
A recurring motive is the exploration of homophile tendencies

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:45.999
of actually heterosexual people.

00:01:45.999 --> 00:01:48.499
In the sixties, Star Trek fans phantasised

00:01:48.499 --> 00:01:50.770
about the infinity of outer space and of the bromance

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:53.950
between Kirk and Spock under the name of "K Slash S".

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:57.230
Since then, homoerotic fanfictions are called "slashfictions"

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:59.340
and the fans of those are sometimes called "slashers".

00:01:59.350 --> 00:02:03.319
The term "shipping" was used first in the mid-nineties on internet platforms,

00:02:03.319 --> 00:02:08.139
where fans of "The X Files" wished for a relationship between Mulder and Scully.

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:12.240
Starting around 2000, fans of fanfiction began to organise themselves on social media

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:16.640
and even influenced pop culture like with the slightly sadomasochistic novel "50 Shades of Grey"

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.840
that was originally written as a Twilight - fanfiction.

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.260
To be able to differentiate between thevarious "ships",

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:24.000
those "ships" receive names.

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.460
John Watson and Sherlock Holmes join forces as "JohnLock" to investigate the world of passion.

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:33.620
"Wincest" is the name for the incestous relationship between Supernatural's brothers Sam and Dean Winchester.

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.050
And the "Sterek" - fans ship the hairy relationship

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:38.790
between Styles and Derek from Teen Wolf.

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:41.640
Of course there is a lot of "shipping" in the YouTube - fandom.

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.380
Maybe this is because the fans feel like they're very close to them.

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:48.060
"TARDY" is the shipping name of the (german) youtubers Taddl and Ardy,

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:50.180
they make the "shippers" wonder

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.110
wether the youtubers should risk their friendship for their love.

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:58.060
The surprise visit of Gronkh (german youtuber) in Sarazar's (another german youtuber's) shower can be found under the tag "Vallerik"

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:01.500
and GermanLetsPlay and Taddl as "GLPaddl" adopt a child

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.480
that they call Kim Joonge Dner (name related to another german youtuber: Dner).

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.560
Wether it is "Rewilz", "ZomGer", "Dizzi" or "LifeWithMaltesDoppelkinn",

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.900
there are no boundaries in the "shipping" - universe.

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.980
Some people who are "shipped" with someone else even add to rumors about a potential relationship

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.630
which leads to tons of new fanfiction.

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:19.750
And some even read out certain fanfictions

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:21.740
and reenact the best scenes.

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:24.320
The "shippers" can be found on one of the various archives specifically for fanfictions

00:03:24.330 --> 00:03:26.610
or on social media platforms like tumblr.

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:28.170
Those are the places they trade stories,

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:30.300
blog about screencaps of suspicious gazes

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:32.650
or use Photoshop to create pictures of romantic kisses

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:35.280
when there had only been a certain tension before.

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.370
If there is more than one "ship" for a person

00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:41.120
- like "Larry", "Zarry" or "Narry" with the british band One Direction -

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:44.710
the fans pick one "ship" as the only true one.

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:48.530
This is the personal "OTP" of this fan, which is short for "One True Pairing"

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:51.780
and don't you dare ask questions or critisise!!

00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:55.740
Some stories also involve the author themselves

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:01.180
for example as the fought - over middle part in a love triangle with "AmazingPhil" and "DanIsNotOnFire".

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:05.860
Or they join Legolas and Aragorn in the Battle of the Hornburg, go to Helm's Deep

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:07.920
... and even deeper.

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:11.620
"Shippings" and fanfictions can be mundane but some are very creative.

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:15.820
They are a phenomenon that enables fans to engage emotionally in a very easy way

00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:18.260
without taking too many risks.

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:20.660
Creating art doesn't have to be the aim of a writer.

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:25.120
Much rather, the author can explore human relations in a way that might not be possible in the "real" world.

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:27.280
For example because it is simply too perverted.

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:29.620
And as long as you are able

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:31.160
to tell real life and fanfiction apart,

00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:32.660
those things are completely harmless.

00:04:32.660 --> 00:04:34.180
Okay, sometimes they're creeps.

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:36.570
But mostly harmless.

00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:38.040
So what is your opinion on "shipping"?

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:42.220
Do you read or even write fanfiction and (the most important question!) who is your OTP?

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:44.220
Write about it down in the somments!

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:46.970
