Hi I'm Kelsea Kelsea Brennan-Wessels

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:29.100
and welcome back to Earth from Space on the
European Space Agency Web TV.

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:37.230
This satellite image shows an area 13 km east
of the city of Mafraq in northern Jordan.

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:41.800
Sitting geologically between the Syrian Desert
and volcanic Hauran plateau,

00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.870
the area experiences a desert climate.

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:52.780
The light-coloured area is the Zaatari Refugee
Camp, measuring some 3 km across.

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:56.210
Located just over 10 km from the border with
Syria,

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:59.890
the camp is currently home to over 100 000
people

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:09.530
displaced by the conflict in the neighbouring
country.

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:15.590
Satellite images like this can help to identify
suitable locations for large refugee camps,

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:20.780
which require traffic connections, water and
electricity, and should be in a rather flat

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:22.600
area.

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.590
High-resolution imagery can also be used to
monitor these camps

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.299
and assist humanitarian operations in the
region.

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:34.710
The Emergency Mapping Service of Europe's
Copernicus programme uses satellite images

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:40.510
to provide geospatial information in support
of emergency management efforts.

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:44.719
This area has been mapped a number of times
to support the construction of the camp,

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:47.740
give a detailed view of the structures within
the camp,

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:51.210
and support drainage work to alleviate flooding.

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:56.719
The Sentinel-2 mission being developed for
Copernicus will deliver frequent and high-resolution

00:01:56.719 --> 00:01:57.719
imagery

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:02.840
-- similar to what we see here -- for disaster
control and humanitarian relief operations,

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.259
among other applications.

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:11.800
This image was acquired on 5 June 2013 by
the Korea Aerospace Research Institute's Kompsat-2

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:19.840
satellite.

00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.510
Well that wraps up this edition of Earth from
Space.

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:28.310
Remember that we broadcast online every Friday
at ten o'clock Central European Summer Time.

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.890

App on your mobile device

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:35.209
