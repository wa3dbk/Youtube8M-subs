00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:07.190
Hi guys, I'm Caroline. And I'm Alejandra.
Today we're making a white chocolate peanut

00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:14.119
butter crepe cake. Ohh, I'm excited about
this because I've never made crepes before.

00:00:14.119 --> 00:00:20.940
Really? Yeah, this is my first time! Well
awesome, I can't wait to teach you! Before

00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:24.460
we get to the crepes though, let's make our
ganache first, which is the filling for the

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:29.910
cake. Sounds good. So if you want, help me
out by tossing that cream in the sauce pan

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:36.910
here. Nice. And you know about about a third
of a cup of White Chocolate Wonderful Peanut

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:42.350
Butter. Love White Chocolate Wonderful! Haha.
So this is a white chocolate ganache? Yes,

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:46.819
and we're going to put some white chocolate
into it too, to echo those flavors. Nice.

00:00:46.819 --> 00:00:51.519
And eventually this cake is going to have
raspberries in it too, so it's extra special.

00:00:51.519 --> 00:00:57.350
So all we're doing is just looking to melt
the peanut butter into the cream. As soon

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:01.139
as it comes together and a few bubbles come around the edges, we'll know it's

00:01:01.139 --> 00:01:04.629
hot enough and we can take it off the heat
and then add the white chocolate. I love making

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:11.280
ganache. It's honestly one of my favorite
things. The trouble is resisting eating it

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.540
all before you use it in your recipe. With
pretty much everything. Hahaha. Alright so

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:21.540
let's give it a little stir and I think this
is ready. Yeah it looks great! Cool I'll take

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.430
it off the heat. Just go ahead and dump all
of that white chocolate in there.These are

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:31.060
some white chocolate bars that have been chopped
up..some of that good white chocolate.. Yeah

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:36.420
absolutely. I mean in a pinch, white chocolate
chips would work, but this is extra special

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:40.570
so if we can just let that sit there for a
second, they'll end up melting right in. And

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:45.530
we're just going to let that sit and stir
it together in a minute. But I'm going to

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:51.920
start our crepe batter. So over here in a
blender, I'm going to combine some milk. This

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:58.050
is similar to a pancake batter, right? Exactly.
Yep, just thinner. And some flour. I like

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:01.870
to put the milk down first just because if
you put the flour down first, sometimes it

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:07.840
gets caught in the blade mechanism, and then
that's just annoying and pretty messy. Hahaha.

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.390
And we got another good dose of White Chocolate
Peanut Butter. I like that there's peanut

00:02:12.390 --> 00:02:18.280
butter in the crepes and the ganache. Just
a nice big spoonful, like to double the White

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:25.280
Chocolate Wonderful. Add these eggs, and just
blend it together. (Blending) Nice and easy

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:37.730
process. Yeah! So we're just going to let
that sit for a second while we heat up our

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:44.420
pan, so we can get this all ready. About medium
heat. What we have here are crepe pans. If

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:49.520
you don't have crepe pans, a smaller, non-stick
skillet works. We're also going to be brushing

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:54.540
it with a little bit of butter. You'll see,
you just have to get the hang of it, I promise

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.819
it will come easy enough and Alejandra will
be proof since she's never done this before.

00:02:57.819 --> 00:03:02.390
I've honestly never done it before, so if
I can do it, let's hope. I know you can do

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:07.150
it, just takes a little practice. How you
know it's hot enough is by holding your hand

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:11.340
over it, it will be sort of warm. And then
we're just going to brush this with a thin

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:16.690
coat of butter. We're not really looking to
fry the pancakes necessarily. So a trick to

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:21.510
the technique of making a crepe is to put
just a small amount of batter and then actually

00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:26.930
swirl the pan. So let's give this a try. So,
a small amount of batter and then swirl the

00:03:26.930 --> 00:03:32.260
pan as you go, so you're just making a nice
thin layer. The sign of a seasoned pro is

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:37.349
when you can really do both of them really
well as the same time. Like that? Exactly.

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:44.349
Is that enough? Yeah! And then swirl.. Exactly!
This is my first crepe people. First. Nicely

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:52.459
done! Ahh. And see it's sort of steaming,
you can tell it's already setting. And what

00:03:52.459 --> 00:03:58.160
we're looking for is a golden brown underside
and that's when you flip it. Because they're

00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:02.849
not terribly hot, you just have to lift them
from the pan. You can see actually now that

00:04:02.849 --> 00:04:06.569
it's starting to turn color. I can see in
some of the thinner parts that it's starting

00:04:06.569 --> 00:04:12.970
to turn golden brown. Mine's going to be golden
brown on one side. Oh that's beautiful! Nice

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:17.509
sizzle. And then the trick with this is, you
really cook it longer on one side and on the

00:04:17.509 --> 00:04:21.209
other side you're really just cooking it to
set it. I like to keep it under towels to

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:26.830
keep them moist. Now I'm just going to make
a couple more. Mine's ready to flip. Great.

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:33.830
Boom! My first crepe. Nicely done, that looks
awesome! Hahaha. See I promise you, you can

00:04:33.870 --> 00:04:38.710
do it too. It might take a little bit of practice,
but I know it's in you. Ok guys, so we just

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:44.650
made a bunch of crepes. A lot. You did a great
job. Thank you. So we're so excited to put

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:51.050
this cake together for you. Here we have the
fruits of our labor. So what we're going to

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:57.630
do is put probably a little bit less?than
that actually, of the ganache on there. This?

00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:01.720
Exactly. Then just spread it in a very thin
layer, because with the weight of all the

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:06.740
crepes, it will end up spreading out more
than you think. Ok. This is the pretty one

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:11.350
but I'm gonna go ahead. You can save your
favorites for the top if you want. So we're

00:05:11.350 --> 00:05:18.199
just stacking them one on top of each other.
Just like that. So our last beautiful layer.

00:05:18.199 --> 00:05:23.270
Awesome. That's gorgeous. And what I like
to do is just, if you want to actually spread

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:27.840
a little bit on top. Ok. Just so that we have
a little bit more ganache, and then we're

00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:31.330
going to sprinkle it with some fresh raspberries,
and then dust it will a little bit of powdered

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:38.330
sugar. I like it. It slices even easier if
it's cool. You know, in the refrigerator for

00:05:38.449 --> 00:05:45.449
a while. So just top it with a pretty mound
of berries. Nice. Hahaha. A trick that I like

00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:55.800
to use to dust powdered sugar nice and gently
is to actually use a spoon. If you tap it

00:05:55.800 --> 00:06:01.280
just so slightly. Oh awesome. It controls
the amount that you let out. That's beautiful.

00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:08.280
Thank you so much! Thanks so much for your
help. You're welcome. Dive in here and cut

00:06:08.419 --> 00:06:15.419
a piece. Mmmm, I feel like a lot of the peanut
butter comes through because remember we put

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:21.850
some peanut butter in the crepes too. It's
really peanut buttery. It's pretty fantastic.

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:26.880
There you have it, white chocolate peanut
butter crepe cake. So what do you think about

00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:31.160
combining white chocolate and peanut butter
and raspberries all in one dish? Let us know

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:34.979

We hope you like this recipe and you give
