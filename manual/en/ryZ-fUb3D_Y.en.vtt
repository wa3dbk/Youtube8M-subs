Hey, we're back again with " Name that Stitch",I'm guest host Libby Lehman.

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.050
Can you guess which stitch this is?

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:00.780
It's actually one that  I've showed before,
but I'd love it so much that I just

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.180
had to do a repeat performance.

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:06.130
This is just your basic " Zig Zag Stitch".

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:09.340
But the twist here is that doing it Free Motion.

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:14.119
So the feed dogs are not engaged, they're
not working. I am using a Free Motion

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:14.890
foot.

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:19.930
So I want to show you this one up close and personal.

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:23.850
I have my machine set up for Zig Zag on Stitch 2.

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.910
A stitch length doesn't matter because
I'm doing Free Motion.

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:32.030
A stitch width can be whatever I want it to
be. Now I'm going to be using a Free

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:36.420
Motion foot and on the Bernina, I have
several choices. This is your open

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:41.330
this and not your open toe, this is your Darning Foot for that which is close toed..

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:43.820
You can also get it open toe.

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:47.320
This happens to be #24.

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:51.640
Another foot you might want to use is
#15

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:56.149
which I kind of like. I can see very well
in that one.  But I'm going to use 29C

00:01:56.149 --> 00:02:01.560
This is a coded foot, which
means I can do 9mm wide

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:04.590
stitches.

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.550
You might also want to use BSR,

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:11.689
some of the Bernina Stitch Regulators
also have a Zig Zag stitch.

00:02:11.689 --> 00:02:15.409
Now the difference in Free Motion and
regular

00:02:15.409 --> 00:02:20.519
Zig Zag stitch, is I'm in charge of how
long the stitch is.If I move the

00:02:20.519 --> 00:02:22.150
fabric quickly,

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:27.699
I willl get a "Zig-Zag".  If I move it slowly, I
will get a "Satin Stitch".

00:02:27.699 --> 00:02:31.539
And when I'm going up and down, I will get a

00:02:31.539 --> 00:02:34.649
thick stitch.

00:02:34.649 --> 00:02:41.529
However, if I move it side to side, I get a thin stitch.

00:02:41.529 --> 00:02:46.909
So, essentially what I've done is turned
this needle into a "Chisel Point Marker".

00:02:46.909 --> 00:02:52.099
You can do this very smooth and regulated or you can go crazy with it. I wanna show doing it

00:02:52.099 --> 00:02:54.909
smooth, first, and doing

00:02:54.909 --> 00:02:59.759
a monogram.  Let's do. I have always
done an "A", So let's do a "B" here.

00:02:59.759 --> 00:03:03.229
And you can do this any width you
want, but this foot I can go up to 9

00:03:03.229 --> 00:03:08.929
millimeter.  I do have this stabilized.  I have 2
layers of stable stuff under here.

00:03:08.929 --> 00:03:12.729
And now when I go up, this is

00:03:12.729 --> 00:03:19.009
going to be as smooth as possible.

00:03:19.009 --> 00:03:25.669
And I can always come back down if I think it needs to be filled in more. I'm moving it

00:03:25.669 --> 00:03:27.849
very slowly.

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:34.849
But here's the difference,I'm gonna go side to side for the bottom of the "B". I'm gonna come up, I'm gonna go in the middle

00:03:39.299 --> 00:03:46.299
but I'm going side to side, it's thin. Up and down its thick. Side to side, thin,Up and down thick.

00:03:52.239 --> 00:03:59.239
And there I have my "B".

00:04:00.179 --> 00:04:05.249
And in case you're wondering, here's what
the  "A" looks like. Up and down, thick.

00:04:05.249 --> 00:04:07.459
Side to side, thin.

00:04:07.459 --> 00:04:13.089
That was very smooth, but sometimes I
want to "fuzzy" the edge between the two

00:04:13.089 --> 00:04:15.449
applique shapes, for example.

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:20.729
Then I may want to go crazy.

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:27.729
Now,Let's go back, I'm going to go...and then I can go

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:35.589
side the side with my thin stitch, and "fuzzy" the edge.

00:04:35.589 --> 00:04:39.620
Now I want to go to the board and show
you this used in a quilt.

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:41.570
In this small, sample quilt,

00:04:41.570 --> 00:04:44.849
I've shown you my love affair with the "Satin Stitch".

00:04:44.849 --> 00:04:46.710
Around the leaf,

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:49.939
I have done "Program Satin Stitch".

00:04:49.939 --> 00:04:51.989
And I've left the stitch width

00:04:51.989 --> 00:04:53.369
the same.

00:04:53.369 --> 00:04:57.739
I've also done a "Satin Stitch " where I have varied the width,while I was sewing...

00:04:57.739 --> 00:05:01.289
And then, this gives you a very defined
edge.

00:05:01.289 --> 00:05:04.210
However, on the background cross here

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:07.699
I  wanted to "fuzzy" the edge between the
two

00:05:07.699 --> 00:05:08.629
fabrics.

00:05:08.629 --> 00:05:11.779
So for this I put in a "Variegated Thread"

00:05:11.779 --> 00:05:13.479
that had both

00:05:13.479 --> 00:05:15.499
of the fabric colors in it,

00:05:15.499 --> 00:05:18.009
And did a "Free Motion Zig Zag"

00:05:18.009 --> 00:05:19.090
back and forth.

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:21.510
This is a great stitch to give you

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:26.169
wide looking stitches. Even if your machine
doesn't have that capability.

00:05:26.169 --> 00:05:28.690
So I hope you enjoy the ""Zig Zag" stitches.

00:05:28.690 --> 00:05:31.190
And I'll see you next time on "Name that Stitch".
