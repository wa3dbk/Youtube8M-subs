00:00:01.069 --> 00:00:06.620
This was an question we got asked at 
http://www.mdrtech.co.uk/answers/

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:10.109
and the question was 
How To Burn Files to an cd or disk

00:00:12.629 --> 00:00:14.259
you need a computer 
and a blank cd or dvd

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:19.990
you have to have an dvd or cd re writer in your computer

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:22.279
Most computers have them know a days 

00:00:22.279 --> 00:00:26.340
so the program you need to burn files to an cd is xpcdbunner

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.029
even tho it is called xp it dose work on all versions off windows up to 7

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:33.320
and on vista

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:37.300
and probably older versions off windows 

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.880
i have only tried it on xp vista and windows 7

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:44.860
this is an free program 

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:49.390
i will put an link in the blog link below where you can download this
with an text verion off this video

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:51.140
will be there as well

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:55.920
when you do install this program don't just keep press next as there is

00:00:55.920 --> 00:01:00.580
that will install that you don't need unless to stop it

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:03.630
i don't install that toolbar as i don't see the point in it

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:09.950
it maybe sorting you want to install but read it carful as it will slow your computer down

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:15.310
once you have installed it go ahead an open it

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:22.310
double click on it on the desktop or find it on the start menu

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:38.020
once the program has loaded your have this box

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:43.210
you can make an audio disk or cd to play in your cd player or car

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:46.330
or even to play in your computer

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:50.740
you can burn an iso with is an image copy off an cd

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:54.630
you can also remove data off disk

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:01.290
we are going to go ahead and make an burn and data disk

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.770
once you found the files that you want to burn to disk 

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.160
or cd or dvd

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:11.709
simple drag to here

00:02:11.709 --> 00:02:15.459
so lets go ahead and drag this

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:20.489
lets go ahead and burn the cd burning program is self

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:22.569
then once you are ready to burn the cd

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:26.819
it will tell you how many mbs it will take up on the disk

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:29.569
you simply click his icon 

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:33.099
here

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:38.159
and you all ways want to make sure that its finalised

00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:43.439
unless you are going to add more to it but only want to play in on this computer

00:02:43.439 --> 00:02:50.329
and buy cd or dvd rws  if you want to add more data to them

00:02:50.329 --> 00:02:54.619
i will put an link below where can

00:02:54.619 --> 00:02:56.669
get cheap cd in the blog

00:02:56.669 --> 00:03:00.599
with my  recommendation
on the best

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:04.849
so  it have no new actual cd in the
computer which is correct

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:06.589
but you simply put an cd in your computer 

00:03:06.589 --> 00:03:11.260
follow all the info on screen all ways used the lowers speed posable 

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:12.769
from the dropdown

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:14.420
at about one or two percent

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:16.189
this dose take an bit longer

00:03:16.189 --> 00:03:20.339
but you  guarantee that cd will work
everywhere

00:03:20.339 --> 00:03:24.069
