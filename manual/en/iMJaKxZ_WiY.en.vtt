Hello everyone my name is bilingue and welcome to KOHispanoGaming

00:00:31.049 --> 00:00:41.049
And today I will be bringing you the first episode of RANKED! These 
 are ranked matches on the Naruto Ultimate Ninja Storm 3 Game

00:00:41.440 --> 00:01:01.440
I will exclusively be playing this game with just Rock Lee in Ranked matches. Believe it or not, this is a 
 ranked match. I have no idea what the hell this guy was thinking but I took advantage of it.

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:17.219
The idea behind this show is to always use Lee. He is one of my favorite 
 characters in the game (and the show) among the really unbalance characters in this game.

00:01:17.503 --> 00:01:24.503
Please keep in mind that I am a noob! I barely have 
 time to play this game but I really like it. 

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:30.429
Please feel free to share any tips on how 
 to improve in the comment section. 

00:01:30.461 --> 00:01:35.461
I won this match but this guy did not do anything.

00:01:37.523 --> 00:01:47.520
To prove that these matches are ranked, I will be leaving the screen 
 on where you can see if I win or lose battle points.

00:01:47.989 --> 00:01:57.990
I am pretty bad at the game. Feel free to laugh a bit but not too much ;p 
 I certainly love these kind of games and want to bring more videos to my channel. 

00:01:58.871 --> 00:02:03.870
Maybe in the future, we can have a tournament

00:02:07.261 --> 00:02:09.260
Here we have Madara vs Lee

00:02:11.402 --> 00:02:16.400
This was a very frustrating fight that I both hated and loved.

00:02:17.479 --> 00:02:32.480
I tried to avoid him with evasive actions and you can see how I failed. Lucky for me, my support 
 came in and I was able to score an ultimate at the beginning of the match. Very lucky!

00:02:32.863 --> 00:02:47.860
This guys knows how to block, something that I am terrible at 
 and you will be able to see in this match.

00:02:49.401 --> 00:02:59.400
I feel that this match represents us noobs very well. We 
 are spaming attacks and doing our best to survive.

00:03:02.169 --> 00:03:12.170
Neji's support here was the reason I was able to get a break. He manages to 
 force Madara to use his last substitution and I was able to do some damage.

00:03:13.161 --> 00:03:28.160
Here I am trying to get closer for some Taijutsu action but he simply does not let me get 
 in. I get pummeled after each attempt very badly. I get lucky and watch that health bar

00:03:28.491 --> 00:03:33.490
Honestly, the skill level in this match is very low for both of us.

00:03:35.646 --> 00:03:47.650
These were some very brutal attacks that almost killed me. 
 Lucky for me, support gets the job done!

00:03:51.346 --> 00:04:11.350
This is where it gets good! WATCH THOSE HEALTHBARS!!

00:04:10.787 --> 00:04:20.790
What do I Do? What do I do? I 
 start charging those shurikens, throwing them... WHO WINS?!

00:04:22.918 --> 00:04:32.920
And I won. This match was very fun but frustrating at the 
 same time. As you can see I am a NOOB.

00:04:34.085 --> 00:04:54.080
This is how the matched ended. I want to continue bringing RANKED! to 
 my channel. Please le me know what you think of the video.

00:04:55.325 --> 00:05:07.320
