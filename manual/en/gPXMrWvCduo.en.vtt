[PAIGE] Hi this is Paige with OneCall and
we’re going to be talking about the Canon

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:22.020
SX210 IS. This would be a great digital camera
for an intermediate to advanced digital camera

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:30.830
user. It offers 14.1 megapixels and 720p HD
video recording. The improved dynamic mode

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:36.790
while shooting HD video will allow you to
have enhanced image stabilization. With the

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:41.230
improved face detection mode you are able
to lock onto subjects and track them while

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:46.260
they’re moving. One of my favorite things
about this digital camera is the face detection

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:51.090
self timer. What you can do is set the shot
up and then when you get into the photo the

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.840
camera will recognize that you joined the
shot and it will take the photo a few seconds

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:59.130
later, you can also wink at the camera so
that it will take the shot approximately two

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:04.400
seconds after that. The camera also has blink
detections, so when everyone’s in that group

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.570
shot the camera will know when somebody’s
eyes are closed and it will hold off until

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:14.430
all the eyes are open to capture that picture.
This camera’s intelligent contrast correction

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:20.580
will adjust for bright or dark scenes in the
same photo. If you’re not using this camera

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.299
on a tripod, the Optical Image Stabilizer
will help reduce camera shake, and help you

00:01:25.299 --> 00:01:30.119
to have a non-blurry photo. You’ll also
notice improved image quality and detail.

00:01:30.119 --> 00:01:32.080
With this camera’s powerful 14x optical
zoom you’re really going to be able to zoom

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.460
in on subjects that are far away, and the
28mm wide angle zoom lens is really going

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:39.220
to help you capture more to the left to the
right of the photo or be able to get more

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:44.170
people into those group photos. When using
your cameras smart auto mode the camera will

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:49.310
automatically choose between 22 different
scene modes to make sure you get the perfect

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:56.520
shot depending on light, motion, and objects
in the shot. Thanks for watching, this is
