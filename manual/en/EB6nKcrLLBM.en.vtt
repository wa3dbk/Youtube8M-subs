00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:36.620
The State Tour began as Dr. Gee's vision of
how to embody our Land Grant mission and serve

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:40.820
all 88 counties, and it has evolved into something
so much more.

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:46.930
It's student driven and it's an amazing opportunity
for not only the state of Ohio to see us as

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:50.300
students, but for us as students to see the
state of Ohio.

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:56.430
Every summer we visit 44 of the 88 counties
in Ohio and we make stops at places ranging

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:04.360
from farms to factories, local businesses,
diners, ice cream shops, pizza places - anything

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:08.010
that contributes to Ohio's culture and economy.

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:11.520
Its an amazing way to see the diversity in
Ohio.

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:17.610
To me, it's not only seeing the passion that
each of these places has and displays or how

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:23.710
welcoming they are, but it's the entire process
of planning this and making all the arrangements

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:28.369
and then traveling with our university leaders
and learning more about the state of Ohio

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:32.290
and meeting those that make up our great state.

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:34.390
Go Buckeye!

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:35.440
O-H!

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:36.490
I-O!

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:41.909
State Tour is important because it gives students
the opportunity to relate back to the state

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:45.479
and see parts of the state that the may never
have seen regardless of whether they're from

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:46.509
Ohio or not.

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:50.729
It's really important that State Tour gives
them that chance to see Ohio in a new light

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:52.319
and all that it has to offer.

00:01:52.319 --> 00:01:58.712
"So me and Sudzy, we worked on collaborating
with Stephanie Smalls from ProMedica to come

00:01:58.712 --> 00:02:01.250
and visit here and see on State Tour what
Defiance has to offer."

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:02.250
"Awesome!

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:05.280
It's such an honor to have you guys here."

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:10.819
State Tour is an amazing opportunity because
it gives students a chance to build personal

00:02:10.819 --> 00:02:16.501
relationships with university leaders and
this also gives them a taste of what the real

00:02:16.501 --> 00:04:08.750
world is actually like.
