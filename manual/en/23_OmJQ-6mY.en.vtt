00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:05.580
Hey Attackers.

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:10.210
It's Bethany here on Wednesday March 5th with
your daily MMO news from the one and only

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:12.420
MMO Attack.

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.930
Wargaming.net is eating up all of the news
like a gluttonous beast, but they are working

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:17.560
hard and we like that.

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:20.529
There is breaking news for both World of warplanes
and World of Tanks.

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:25.480
If you don't care about that Albion Online
has released their alpha testing date, and

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:29.529
the game has the possibility of changing the
way we use our phones forever.

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:30.560
Kind of heavy.

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:34.610
Your daily XP starts now!

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:38.720
World of Warplanes players are stoked this
week because Wargaming has finally taken to

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.790
their numerous requests to better enhance
the game.

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:45.720
Update 1.2 marks the first addition of serious
content since the game's official launch a

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:46.720
few months ago.

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:51.380
There will be new missions, way more in-depth
post battle stats, recording and playback

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:55.671
of matches, changes to the game's economy,
and even cosmetic changes having to do with

00:00:55.671 --> 00:00:56.671
the accuracy of the aircrafts.

00:00:56.671 --> 00:00:57.671
Pretty cool.

00:00:57.671 --> 00:01:01.660
If they are not lying to us update 1.2 for
World of Warplanes should be dropping tomorrow

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:02.820
the 6th.

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.970
Another group of players are stoked as well
today because Sandbox interactive has announced

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:10.940
the start date for the initial alpha testing
phase of Albion online.

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:14.520
People are really excited about this game
because it promises to bring large-scale PVP

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.050
battles into the mobile scene, which has never
really been done before.

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:20.820
I mean, we don't really need to more of a
reason to look at our phones but at least

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:23.240
this is more badass then checking your Instagram.

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.180
The start date of the alpha testing phase
is March 24th, and players are being warned

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:30.590
to act fast because there will be a very limited
number of keys.

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:31.590
Get on it!

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.300
Wargaming.net is back in our news today, stealing
all of the attention, but this time it's for

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:36.370
World of Tanks.

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:39.800
These dudes are working hard over there and
are keeping their promise of delivering regular

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:43.030
updates for their plans for the game in 2014.

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:46.440
They've released their second Developer Dairy
which focuses around a new approach to the

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:47.810
in-game physics.

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:52.310
Expect changes to literally every aspect of
physics including movable objects, detachable

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:56.659
tank turrets, individually mapped tank treads,
and yes, the way things explode.

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:00.461
The video shows the way that different building
models change in behavior depending on the

00:02:00.461 --> 00:02:04.570
ammo used to destroy them, as well as the
different outcomes of destruction when using

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:07.170
an armor piercing round or explosive shell.

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:09.680
Check the video out, it's worth watching.

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:11.159
That's it guys.

00:02:11.159 --> 00:02:13.050
