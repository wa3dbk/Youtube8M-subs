00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.700
President Obama:
It's wonderful to see
President Hu once again.

00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:06.000
We were just noting that it's
the seventh time we've had an

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.667
opportunity to meet.

00:00:07.667 --> 00:00:13.867
And the U.S.-China relationship
I think has become stronger over

00:00:13.867 --> 00:00:16.100
the last several years.

00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:21.033
We've been discussing a whole
range of not only bilateral

00:00:21.033 --> 00:00:23.934
issues but world issues.

00:00:23.934 --> 00:00:28.066
And as two leading nuclear
powers, obviously,

00:00:28.066 --> 00:00:30.233
we have a special
obligation to deal

00:00:30.233 --> 00:00:32.533
with issues of nuclear proliferation.

00:00:32.533 --> 00:00:34.467
As two of the world's
leading economies,

00:00:34.467 --> 00:00:39.100
we've got a special obligation
to deal with ensuring strong,

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:41.700
balanced and sustainable growth.

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:44.000
I am very much looking
forward to hosting

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.100
President Hu in Washington.

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:51.100
And in the meantime, we have
created a structure -- a

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:54.967
Strategic and Economic Dialogue,
in which our teams have been

00:00:54.967 --> 00:00:56.900
working on a whole
range of issues.

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:59.100
And we're seeing
significant progress.

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:01.600
So I look forward to this
meeting and I'm glad to

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.767
see you again.

00:01:03.767 --> 00:02:02.834
President Obama:
(translated in Chinese)

00:02:02.834 --> 00:02:17.200
President Hu:
(speaking in Chinese)

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.000
President Hu:
(as translated)
The Chinese side stands ready to

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.266
work with the U.S. side to
increase dialogue, exchanges,

00:02:23.266 --> 00:02:26.467
and cooperation so that
we can move forward the

00:02:26.467 --> 00:02:29.934
China-U.S. relationship on
a positive, cooperative

00:02:29.934 --> 00:02:32.300
and comprehensive track.

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:46.300
President Hu:
(speaking in Chinese)

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:47.967
President Hu:
(as translated)
I'd like to thank President Obama

00:02:47.967 --> 00:02:52.367
for inviting me to visit the
United States early next year.

00:02:52.367 --> 00:02:54.934
The competent departments in
our two countries are making

00:02:54.934 --> 00:02:56.934
preparations for the visit.

00:02:56.934 --> 00:03:00.800
I hope and do believe that
the visit will be successful.

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:13.100
President Hu:
(speaking in Chinese)

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:15.200
President Hu:
(as translated)
This evening the G20 Seoul

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:16.900
Summit will be opened.

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.934
I believe that with the
concerted efforts of all the

00:03:19.934 --> 00:03:24.400
parties, the summit in Seoul
will produce positive outcomes.
