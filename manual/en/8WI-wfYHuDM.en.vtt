00:00:00.066 --> 00:00:05.700
If you're looking for a high tank toilet, or a chain pull toilet, you've come to the right place. 

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:11.866
At Renovator's Supply, we've got more than 300 different models of high tank toilets and chain pull toilets to choose from, at factory direct prices. 

00:00:11.866 --> 00:00:14.400
Wow! That's a LOT of toilets.

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:17.833
How do you make sure the toilet you order is exactly the one you want? 

00:00:17.833 --> 00:00:21.566
 It's easy. Did you know you can save lots of time and money   

00:00:21.566 --> 00:00:25.333
 by converting your existing 2 piece toilet into a high-tank toilet? 

00:00:25.333 --> 00:00:28.066
  All you need is a Z-pipe conversion kit.

00:00:28.066 --> 00:00:31.300
You keep your bowl as installed, and we supply the rest. 
 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:35.033
 Or, for a complete toilet, just follow these simple steps. 

00:00:35.033 --> 00:00:40.600
First, do you prefer an L-pipe or a Z-pipe?  Choose depending on your rough-in.   

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:45.033
An L-pipe drops from the tank and inserts into the BACK of the toilet.

00:00:45.033 --> 00:00:49.633
With an L-pipe, you can have a rough-in space of 12 to 15 inches.

00:00:49.633 --> 00:00:53.966
A Z-pipe drops from the tank into the TOP of the toilet.

00:00:53.966 --> 00:00:57.566
With a Z-pipe, you have a rough-in space of 12 inches.  

00:00:57.566 --> 00:01:04.000
For a corner toilet, measure the rough-in like this. 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.100
Now you'll need to make some style choices. 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:11.666
You can use the very easy 'Build Your Toilet' tool on our website. 

00:01:11.666 --> 00:01:14.966
Or, you can make your choices by going through these options: 

00:01:14.966 --> 00:01:20.066
Will your toilet mount against a wall, or do you want a space-saving corner toilet? 

00:01:20.066 --> 00:01:24.066
Pick your tank material, your tank color,

00:01:24.066 --> 00:01:28.933
and for wood tanks, your tank panel style. 

00:01:28.933 --> 00:01:32.066
Pick your hardware finish

00:01:32.066 --> 00:01:35.066
 and your bowl style 

00:01:35.066 --> 00:01:38.733
Once you've made these choices, you're close to being done. 

00:01:38.733 --> 00:01:45.066
 You need, for example, this toilet: a wall-mount, L-pipe, wood raised panel tank in a cherry finish, 

00:01:45.066 --> 00:01:48.066
with a round bowl in bone, and a brass finish. 

00:01:48.066 --> 00:01:53.166
Now this is important. All chain pull toilets are not created equal.

00:01:53.166 --> 00:01:56.433
 You definitely want to make sure you're buying the highest quality, 

00:01:56.433 --> 00:02:00.066
because you don't want to have to replace your toilet in a couple years. 

00:02:00.066 --> 00:02:03.533
So what should you look for? Stainless steel pipes.

00:02:03.533 --> 00:02:08.066
 The last thing you need is a pipe that rots out.  At Renovator's Supply,

00:02:08.066 --> 00:02:13.200
all of our pipes are stainless steel with a PVD finish and a lifetime warranty. 

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:18.366
Expert advice. Our customer service people are very knowledgeable, 

00:02:18.366 --> 00:02:20.366
 but if they can't answer your question, 

00:02:20.366 --> 00:02:24.066
we'll connect you with one of our factory engineers or our plumbing experts.

00:02:24.066 --> 00:02:27.266
Whatever your question, you'll speak to someone who can help you.

00:02:27.266 --> 00:02:30.400
a rock-solid guarantee. 

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:36.066
Every toilet we sell comes with a 100% Satisfaction, money-back guarantee. 

00:02:36.066 --> 00:02:40.600

we have the best prices in the industry.

00:02:44.066 --> 00:02:46.500
Already own a toilet and need replacement parts?

We also stock parts for most high-tank chain-pull toilet companies that have gone out of business in the last 30 years. 

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:56.600
