00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.570
Queensland's Sophie Lester asked for a dragon
- and science delivered.

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:10.790
CSIRO in Melbourne has created Sophie her
very own titanium dragon, modelled after Toothless

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:13.780
from the Dreamworks movie "How to Train Your
Dragon".

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:17.260
"We couldn't sit here and do nothing," wrote
CSIRO.

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:21.640
"After all, we promised Sophie we would look
into it."

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:26.929
Scientists spent two days designing and printing
the dragon, using their state-of-the-art 3D

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:27.929
printer.

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:33.160
"Her letter was very hopeful and it was very
polite and we wanted to encourage her curiosity

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:38.100
and encourage her love of science," said a
spokesperson for the CSIRO.

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:43.660
The dragon is currently winging its way to
Sophie's Brisbane home from Lab 22 in Melbourne.

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:48.289
Sophie's mother Melissah Lester said she was
overwhelmed with the CSIRO's response.

00:00:48.289 --> 00:00:51.289
"It's beautiful, I've just seen it.

00:00:51.289 --> 00:00:54.699
I haven't had a chance to show Sophie yet.

00:00:54.699 --> 00:00:57.010
She's going to scream," she said.

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:02.030
CSIRO said they had received a number of offers
of support since Sophie's story went viral

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:03.640
on Wednesday.

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:08.530
One special offer came from the director of
"How to Train Your Dragon", who saw Sophie's

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:12.810
request and will now also be sending her a
dragon to call her own.

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:17.530
Mrs Lester said when she got the phone call
from Dreamworks, she thought it must be a

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:18.670
prank call.

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:23.670
"Someone from Dreamworks called this morning
and the director had asked to ask Sophie why

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:25.520
Toothless is a girl?

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:30.149
They were fascinated that Sophie thought Toothless
was a girl," she said.

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:35.100
Seven-year-old Sophie made headlines world-wide
this week after she wrote to the CSIRO asking

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:37.380
them to help make her a dragon.

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:43.060
To her mother's amusement, Australia's primary
research agency responded, saying they were

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:47.549
sorry they hadn't been putting more time into
their dragon research program.

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:53.090
"Titanium is super strong and lightweight,
so Toothless will be a very capable flyer,"

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:57.360
Additive Manufacturing operations manager
Chad Henry said.

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:02.710
Mrs Lester said it has been incredible how
quickly the story has spread across the world.

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:07.270
"I've had a friend saying that her friend
saw it in New York and they were talking about

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:08.530
it in her office building.

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:13.450
I had another friend saying someone called
her from the UK asking 'Have you seen this

00:02:13.450 --> 00:02:17.069
great letter from a little girl in Brisbane?',"
she said.

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:19.260
"It's just been amazing."

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:24.780
However although Sophie may now be an internet
sensation, Mrs Lester said she hadn't told

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:26.050
her about it yet.

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:28.040
"She doesn't know.

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.730
She knows she was on television on Wednesday
evening and she knows she'll be in the local

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.090
paper but I've left the rest of it out," she
said.

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:40.260
"We definitely will tell her one day, but
possibly not when she's a teenager."
