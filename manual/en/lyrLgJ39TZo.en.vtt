00:00:00.459 --> 00:00:06.630
After rinsing, you want to go to the actual
shampoo. What you want to do is put the shampoo

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:13.509
about a quarter size shampoo in your hand.
Then, you want to rub the shampoo very good

00:00:13.509 --> 00:00:20.259
first before you apply it to the hair. When
you rub it between your hands it actually

00:00:20.259 --> 00:00:26.590
breaks up the molecules to actually release
the molecules to shampoo the hair. If you

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:33.890
don't do this, most of the time you'll use
a lot of shampoo and not get a good lather.

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:42.500
So, you really must rub it first to get it
activated. Then, you want to rub it all over

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:53.089
the hair.
Keep rubbing. Make sure you get it in the

00:00:53.089 --> 00:01:07.040
back. Rub it some more. Rub. Rub. Rub. Make
sure you have thoroughly covered the entire

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:21.310
head and all the hair to the ends. The next
step is the massage. You want to start in

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:25.460
the top or you can start in the back. You
can start wherever you like. But, you want

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:32.020
to start in one area and thoroughly massage
the whole area. So, I'm going to start in

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:40.740
the top and the front. And, then I'm going
to go across to the ears and the temples making

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:49.750
sure I've covered the entire area before moving
to the middle. You should use the ball of

00:01:49.750 --> 00:01:57.829
your fingers, not the fingernails. Because
you could scratch the customer's scalp. You

00:01:57.829 --> 00:02:05.729
never know if they have some type of irritation
or bumps. There could be all kinds of things

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:11.260
going on with the scalp that you just don't
know yet until you see it. So, you want to

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:16.302
move to the middle. Go across down to the
ears and back up. Then, you want to move to

00:02:16.302 --> 00:02:27.120
the back doing the same motion until you cover
the entire head. The shampoo is one of the

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:36.800
most important parts of the hair experience,
because the cleanliness is very important.

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:43.890
First of all, you want to remove all of the
products from the hair. Also, it relaxes the

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:50.880
customer and gives them confidence in what
you're about to do. You want to use a couple

00:02:50.880 --> 00:03:04.120
different massage techniques also.
You can use a circular motion. You can use

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:11.260
a back and forth motion like this. Feels pretty
good to the customer. You can do a circular

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:33.430
massage motion right here at the occipital
in both sides of the head. After you finish

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:37.770
your first shampoo, you can go ahead and rinse
the shampoo from the hair.
