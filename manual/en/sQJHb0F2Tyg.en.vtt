00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.149
The following is a guide
to perfect projection

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:06.500
using a Disney framing chart.

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:09.000
You should always,
first and foremost,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.039
follow your theatre
owner's instructions.

00:00:12.039 --> 00:00:13.079
A quick recap --

00:00:13.079 --> 00:00:15.480
to achieve perfect
projection you must

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.830
delete unnecessary
assets in your server,

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:18.990
ingest content,

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.220
ingest KDM's,

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.680
verify your feature
has been unlocked,

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:23.880
create a playlist,

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.090
select the proper
projection channel,

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:27.410
use the framing chart,

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:31.670
and conduct a QC run before
your first presentation.

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:34.129
if you have questions
regarding any of these steps,

00:00:34.129 --> 00:00:38.859
please review our previous
videos on digital cinema.

00:00:38.859 --> 00:00:41.100
One of the main tools
Disney has provided you with

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.930
is our film-specific
framing charts.

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:50.859
Let's go over to the theater
and take a look at how to use one.

00:00:50.859 --> 00:00:57.829
Wow, that does
not look good.

00:00:57.829 --> 00:00:59.159
It looks like we have
four minutes

00:00:59.159 --> 00:01:01.969
to teach you how to use
the framing chart,

00:01:01.969 --> 00:01:04.479
with a little bit
of Disney magic,

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:10.030
let's go back
to square one.

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:14.110
Settle down,
and pay attention.

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:16.720
To begin with,
the title.

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.030
Make sure the title of the
framing chart you are using

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:21.510
matches the feature you
will be projecting.

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:24.740
Do not reuse framing charts
with different titles.

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:27.840
Below the title you will notice
specific support lines to call

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:31.500
if you run across any problems
you cannot solve yourself.

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:34.220
Always follow your theatre
owner's instructions.

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:38.329
Also notice the version of the
framing chart you are using.

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:42.020
Version 6.0 is for the 5.1
digital surround sound,

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:47.740
where 7.1-DS is used for 7.1
digital surround sound.

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:49.910
Now we need to look
at the picture.

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:52.140
Notice the green lines
on the right and left,

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.070
as well as the yellow lines
on the top and bottom.

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:59.450
When adjusting your masking,
make sure not to cover these lines.

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:01.829
If you see any red on
the edges of the screen,

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.640
there is a problem
with either the size

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.499
or the aspect ratio
of your projected image.

00:02:07.499 --> 00:02:09.909
If you don't know
how to fix this problem,

00:02:09.909 --> 00:02:11.900
contact your supervisor.

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:15.180
Now observe the white circle
in the center of the framing chart.

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.459
If that shape is anything
other than a circle,

00:02:17.459 --> 00:02:19.260
you have a projector problem.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.620
Contact your supervisor immediately.

00:02:21.620 --> 00:02:25.260
Are you following
everything so far?

00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:27.340
Once your projector is
perfectly aligned,

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:28.909
it is time to check color.

00:02:28.909 --> 00:02:31.480
First, look at the background
of your framing chart.

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:34.750
If it's tinted any other color
than black, there's a problem.

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:38.480
Now, observe the white circle
in the middle of the framing chart

00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:42.120
as well as the color bar to
the right of the white circle.

00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:44.150
If the circle is anything but white,

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.549
or the colors within the
color bar appear incorrect,

00:02:46.549 --> 00:02:49.240
you are in the wrong color space.

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:52.060
Do not delete and
reingest your content.

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:54.319
The gray scale at the bottom
of the framing chart

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:56.739
should be made up of
10 different squares

00:02:56.739 --> 00:03:00.150
ranging from the darkest black
to the whitest white.

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:02.040
if you cannot perceive
10 different squares

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:04.040
in the gray scale,
there may be an issue

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:06.300
with your projector's
brightness setting.

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:07.970
Focus!
[laughing]

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:11.680
Okay, seriously,
let's talk about focus.

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:15.049
in all corners of the framing chart,
you will notice a black and white box

00:03:15.049 --> 00:03:17.430
called the focus square.

00:03:17.430 --> 00:03:21.590
Focus the lens until the lines
within the box are clearly defined.

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:24.450
if you're projecting in 3-D,
there are two additional functions

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:26.849
included in the framing chart.

00:03:26.849 --> 00:03:31.340
With your glasses on, look at
the bottom left focus square.

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:33.860
When covering your right eye,
the square should read

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:35.519
"Left Eye Only."

00:03:35.519 --> 00:03:38.079
And when covering your left eye,
the square should look like

00:03:38.079 --> 00:03:40.480
a normal focus square.

00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:43.939
if this is not the case,
you have a technical issue.

00:03:43.939 --> 00:03:46.299
Contact your supervisor immediately.

00:03:46.299 --> 00:03:49.450
And lastly, in the top right
corner of the framing chart,

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:51.879
you'll notice a revolving cube.

00:03:51.879 --> 00:03:54.010
With your glasses on,
this cube should appear

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:58.019
floating off the screen,
giving a strong sense of depth.

00:03:58.019 --> 00:04:00.420
Last thing,
let's check the sound.

00:04:00.420 --> 00:04:03.750
As you can see, there's a countdown
in the center of the framing chart.

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:05.640
When the framing chart
reaches "2"

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:08.120
it will simultaneously
emit a sync pop

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:11.239
that indicates whether your sound
is synced with your picture.

00:04:11.239 --> 00:04:13.459
Also, be aware that
after the sync pop,

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:15.040
that the luminance
within the circle

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:17.870
should read 14 foot-lamberts
for 2-D,

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:21.530
and 3.5 to 5.5 foot-lamberts
for 3-D.

00:04:21.530 --> 00:04:23.100
Next is the sound check.

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:24.100
While sitting in the theater--

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:27.030
Yes, well, OK.

00:04:27.030 --> 00:04:28.470
While sitting
in the theater,

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:31.460
listen while the surround sound
is tested around you.

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:33.381
Version 6.0 will look
like this as it tests

00:04:33.381 --> 00:04:37.310
your 5.1 surround sound system.

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:42.250
Version 7.1-DS will test your
7.1 surround sound system,

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:45.640
and it looks like this.

00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:48.770
And that is how you achieve
perfect projection using

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:51.390
the content-appropriate
framing chart.

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:54.800
Use your framing chart every day
prior to your first show.

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:58.000
This will enable you to deliver
the best viewing experience possible

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.610
to the audiences.

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:02.590
And look at that,
it took only four minutes.

00:05:02.590 --> 00:05:05.500
Good luck!

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:08.780
And if you need additional help,
look at the color of your box.

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:11.750
