00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:24.550
There are basically two ingredients to making
a wrestler.

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:27.419
One, the wrestling ability…two, the presentation.

00:00:27.419 --> 00:00:29.539
Three, the spandex.

00:00:29.539 --> 00:00:31.550
Four, the boss’s daughter.

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:35.350
Take that, Triple H. Anyway, I’m getting
off track here.

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:38.120
Listen, there are basically two ingredients
to making a wrestler.

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.680
Or at least, to making the best wrestlers.

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.500
‘Cause see, a lot of guys end up having
one or the other, the wrestling ability or

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:45.500
the presentation.

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:46.700
Like, Hulk Hogan, right?

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:49.129
Great presentation, not much of a wrestler.

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:51.480
Then there’s someone like Dynamite Kid on
the other side.

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:53.610
Great wrestler, not the best presentation.

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:58.790
Then there’s guys who have both, like Ric
Flair, Randy Savage, Shawn Michaels…

00:00:58.790 --> 00:01:01.160
This game is no Shawn Michaels.

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:10.970
It’s HammerLock Wrestling, for the Super
NES.

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:20.430
No, this game is a lot more like Hulk Hogan.

00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:24.719
It’s got the style, and the presentation,
take your vitamins, brother…but it’s not

00:01:24.719 --> 00:01:25.810
much of a wrestling game.

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:28.540
In fact, the style gets in the way of the
substance.

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:29.540
Like, literally.

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:32.990
I mean, cool animations, bro—I can’t even
see the goddamn game.

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:34.310
Move it with the animations.

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:35.310
Bro.

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.720
I can’t suplex what I can’t see, that’s
a rule.

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:40.560
That’s the John Cena rule.

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.330
Actually, Cena has another rule, too.

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:43.330
Never give up.

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:47.420
And I’ve got to tell you, after a couple
rounds of HammerLock Wrestling, I was prepared

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:48.420
to break that rule.

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:49.420
Sorry, Cena.

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:51.950
I don’t deserve your hat.

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:55.420
Anyway, so as you can tell, this game is all
about the presentation.

00:01:55.420 --> 00:02:00.660
The screen gets split into three sections,
with the top and bottom showing close-up animations

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:03.380
of what’s happening in the match, which
is happening in the middle.

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:04.380
Sometimes.

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:05.830
Sometimes, it moves to the bottom, too.

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:11.890
Which, you know…that’s great, when the
game you’re trying to play just moves.

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:12.890
More on the headaches later, though.

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:14.730
‘Cause at least the animations look awesome.

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.790
I mean, there’s way too much of it, but
watching the close-ups of the moves you’re

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:19.790
actually doing?

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:21.640
That’s pretty awesome.

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:30.709
Be more awesome to see the game I’m trying
to play.

00:02:30.709 --> 00:02:32.239
Brother.

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:41.840
And before I drop the elbow on this thing,
uh…I mean, it has a ton of moves.

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.970
And like, moves you wouldn’t expect.

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:49.290
Abdominal stretches; cross arm breakers; tiger
bombs; freaking enziguiris.

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.819
I mean, what kind of 16-bit wrestling game
has enziguiris?

00:02:52.819 --> 00:02:54.250
I’ll tell you what one.

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:55.580
HammerLock Wrestling.

00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:00.190
So there really is an awesome variety of moves
here, and of course, they look equally awesome

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:01.190
when you see their animations.

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:05.760
In fact, the game has this kind of cinematic
realism that’s really unique.

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:09.340
The animations tell the story of the match,
just like real wrestling, and the matches

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:12.580
are also presented like actual fights.

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:16.790
They have time limits, just like in the old
days, and after the finish, it shows you who

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:21.620
won the match, what the time limit was and
what move they used to score the victory.

00:03:21.620 --> 00:03:25.970
Which is cool, you don’t usually see that
in wrestling games.

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:30.170
Unfortunately, though, HammerLock Wrestling
does get DQ’ed pretty early on.

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:33.720
And that’s because it’s awkward to play,
and it’s awkward to look at.

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:39.900
You grapple with this bizarre system that’s
based on, like…who hit the buttons first?

00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:43.660
Which means, when you go to lock up, you’re
not pounding the buttons to win the grapple

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:44.660
and do your move.

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:49.940
You just have to push the buttons first…which
means it’s based on timing, I guess?

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:52.470
But you have no idea what the timing is.

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:54.420
Like, you don’t know when the start is.

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:57.691
It’s like a deaf guy in an old west shootout.

00:03:57.691 --> 00:04:03.370
If you can’t hear the saloon owner yell
“draw,” that entire situation is gonna

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:07.239
be harder than it needs to be.

00:04:07.239 --> 00:04:11.849
It’s not just the grappling, though.

00:04:11.849 --> 00:04:14.260
The gameplay in general just isn’t that
great.

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.949
And it does some pretty weird things, too.

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:21.049
Like, when you hit a move on your opponent,
you fall down, too.

00:04:21.049 --> 00:04:22.300
Drop an elbow on the guy?

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:24.560
You lay there like you just got elbowed, by
a ghost.

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:28.599
Like Andre’s back from the dead, to take
another shot at Hogan.

00:04:28.599 --> 00:04:30.740
Only he accidentally slammed you, too.

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:31.990
Thanks a lot, Andre.

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:35.650
Next time, just slam this goddamn game for
me.

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:44.020
Mondo Fundi looks like he just saw Andre,
too.

00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:49.780
Look, this is a really weird game, and it’s
hard to feel one way or the other about it.

00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:55.150
Like, the style is cool, and I want to like
it because of that…but at the same time,

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:59.910
it’s supposed to be a video game, so why
is the actual gameplay literally pushed out

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:00.910
of the way sometimes?

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:03.659
It’s a conundrum, this entire situation.

00:05:03.659 --> 00:05:06.550
Fortunately, there’s someone we can turn
to.

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:09.550
Spud will date your sister and not even ask
first.

00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:10.740
See if he cares.

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:12.849
It’s HammerLock Wrestling, for the Super
NES.

00:05:12.849 --> 00:05:19.020
And a huge thanks, once again, to Kris from
Jersey City, New Jersey, for sending it to

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:20.020
the show.

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:22.309
Shawn Michaels is no Spud Marmoset.
