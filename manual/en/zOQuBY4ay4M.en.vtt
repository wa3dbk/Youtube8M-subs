00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:12.129
Now we're going to talk a little bit about
bow divisions and rhythms.

00:00:12.129 --> 00:00:17.580
A good way to demonstrate bow divisions is
in a scale.

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:23.050
I always put my metronome at sixty when I
practice my scales, and I work from a slow

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:28.020
tempo up to a faster tempo.

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:32.630
But, the metronome always stays at sixty.

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:40.670
First, you start with whole notes which is
four counts to sixty, and that's dividing

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:41.670
the bow.

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:44.570
One, two, three, four.

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:47.489
One, two, three, four.

00:00:47.489 --> 00:01:00.909
So, I'll play a little bit of an A major scale
like that.

00:01:00.909 --> 00:01:09.540
OK.

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:14.680
Now I'm going to show you about doing half
notes separate bows.

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.260
I'm going to divide the bow.

00:01:17.260 --> 00:01:18.850
One, two.

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:20.440
One, two.

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:40.060
So the bow's going a little faster.

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:47.310
Now we're going to go to quarter notes, but
we're going to slur them so that one note

00:01:47.310 --> 00:02:01.930
is half a bow and the next note is half a
bow.

00:02:01.930 --> 00:02:05.890
But if you can see, the bow division is so
important.

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:11.910
Because if I did not divide that in half and
I divided it, you know, the first note three

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:16.810
quarters of a bow and then the second note
just a quarter of a bow, the sound would be

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:17.859
very different.

00:02:17.859 --> 00:02:29.330
It would sound like this.

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:34.920
Maybe you'll use that kind of a bow speed
at some point in bow division, but to really

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:41.310
practice your scales and get them the right
sound sustained you do definitely need the

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:46.730
exact bow division, sort of like math.

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:49.440
Let's go to four notes to a bow.

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:53.870
So now you're dividing each note into quarters.

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:55.799
One two three four.

00:02:55.799 --> 00:03:09.709
One two three four.

00:03:09.709 --> 00:03:14.620
This is a little example of bow division in
your scales.

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:18.840
You can use it in all your different scales
and, of course, your pieces as well.
