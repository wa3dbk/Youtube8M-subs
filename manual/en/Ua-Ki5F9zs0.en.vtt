00:00:11.609 --> 00:00:12.709
Good morning.

00:00:12.882 --> 00:00:14.915
Beautiful isn't it?
Let's drive.

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:24.944
Here it is, the Insignia.
The predecessor of the *cough*.

00:00:25.453 --> 00:00:28.143
It's 8 inches bigger than its predecessor...

00:00:28.145 --> 00:00:29.626
...and also 8 inches hotter.

00:00:29.674 --> 00:00:35.832
It's much nicer than what Opel previously
had to offer in this segment.

00:00:41.942 --> 00:00:47.024
Unlike its predecessor,
the Insignia is available with four-wheel drive.

00:00:47.089 --> 00:00:49.101
Of course it doesn't come
as standard on every version...

00:00:49.114 --> 00:00:51.443
...but we've chosen the V6 Turbo.

00:00:51.524 --> 00:00:54.551
It has 260 hp, and of course 4wd.

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:57.677
And it needs it,
because we drove a car once...

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:59.419
...whose name we can't mention...

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:01.404
...but it ended with -tra OPC.

00:01:01.507 --> 00:01:02.966
It had the same engine...

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:05.947
...but you could get
quite a bit of wheelspin with it.

00:01:06.031 --> 00:01:08.068
But that won't happen with this one.

00:01:09.036 --> 00:01:12.434
The Insignia is also the first to appear
of a new design philosophy.

00:01:12.586 --> 00:01:16.706
The Opel-range will become slicker,
more dynamic and sportier.

00:01:17.004 --> 00:01:19.589
The interior is also fancier.

00:01:19.591 --> 00:01:22.586
There are floating buttons,
and a cockpit-feeling.

00:01:23.077 --> 00:01:25.231
Ours has fake wood inlays.

00:01:25.737 --> 00:01:26.987
That doesn't make me very happy.

00:01:27.016 --> 00:01:29.338
It's not very nice, I don't like it.

00:01:29.517 --> 00:01:31.742
But I can imagine that
other people will like it.

00:01:31.835 --> 00:01:34.872
You can also get it in black or other colors.

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:37.819
The rest of the interior is appealing...

00:01:37.839 --> 00:01:39.065
...but there's one big turnoff.

00:01:39.141 --> 00:01:42.726
There's an iDrive-like controller...

00:01:42.748 --> 00:01:45.025
...a mouse thingy.
But if I change gear...

00:01:45.105 --> 00:01:51.232
...I sometimes touch it.
Which deletes the route...

00:01:51.318 --> 00:01:55.230
...or it changes the radio
to classical music of something.

00:01:55.233 --> 00:01:56.703
That's not very convenient at all.

00:01:57.071 --> 00:01:58.688
A good thing is the Opel Eye...

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:04.339
...that's a camera that for example
watches if you're between the lines.

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:07.462
But it also reads the signs...

00:02:07.551 --> 00:02:12.076
...so I know if I can drive 80, 60, 30 or 50.

00:02:12.114 --> 00:02:14.484
I don't always know that because
I'm not paying enough attention.

00:02:14.678 --> 00:02:19.285
It reads the signs and shows
the maximum speed in the display...

00:02:19.301 --> 00:02:21.140
...or if it's prohibited to overtake for example.

00:02:24.197 --> 00:02:27.673
Also special is the Adaptive Forward Lighting.

00:02:27.757 --> 00:02:31.233
Which means the headlights
move with the steering.

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:33.696
But it also has different light profiles.

00:02:33.886 --> 00:02:37.145
In town you get a wider beam...

00:02:37.156 --> 00:02:39.230
...and when driving on the highway
you get a higher beam.

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:41.150
There are nine different profiles...

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:45.777
...that constantly adapt themselves to
the conditions you're driving in.

00:02:49.698 --> 00:02:51.595
Another feature is the adaptive suspension.

00:02:51.617 --> 00:02:55.254
You can't bring out a car nowadays
without an adaptive suspension...

00:02:55.285 --> 00:02:56.534
...so this Opel has one too.

00:02:56.730 --> 00:02:58.358
There are three settings. Normal.

00:02:58.594 --> 00:03:03.156
Tour, which is a bit softer with lighter steering
and a less fierce throttle response.

00:03:03.169 --> 00:03:06.949
I found the steering a bit too light
and lacking feeling.

00:03:07.105 --> 00:03:09.870
And there is sport,
which spices things up a bit...

00:03:10.016 --> 00:03:12.702
...and, very important,
it makes the dashboard red.

00:03:13.361 --> 00:03:14.758
Very nice.

00:03:15.986 --> 00:03:18.348
There are lots of engines available.

00:03:18.474 --> 00:03:20.339
I'll quickly talk you through them...

00:03:20.385 --> 00:03:22.771
...there's a 1.6, a 1.8, a 2-liter turbo...

00:03:22.871 --> 00:03:24.714
...a 2.8 turbo, in which we're driving.

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:26.107
There are three diesels...

00:03:26.266 --> 00:03:29.597
...all 2-liters.
110, 130 and 160 hp.

00:03:29.631 --> 00:03:34.390
And there'll be a 160 hp ecoFLEX diesel
which is nice to the environment...

00:03:34.443 --> 00:03:36.861
...with an emission of
less than 140 grams CO2 per km.

00:03:37.195 --> 00:03:41.956
There'll also be a 1.6 turbo with 180 hp...

00:03:42.002 --> 00:03:44.819
...and a 2-liter bi-turbo diesel with 190 hp.

00:03:44.946 --> 00:03:48.500
I'd skip the 1.6...

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:51.962
...115 hp in a relatively heavy car
doesn't seem to be a good combination.

00:03:52.504 --> 00:03:56.961
You can test drive it,
and eventually choose the 2.8 V6.

00:03:57.137 --> 00:04:01.078
155 mph, 0-62 in 6.9 seconds.
That's the one you want.

00:04:01.706 --> 00:04:03.763
Until there's an OPC,
cos then you want that one.

00:04:04.044 --> 00:04:05.515
There'll be one, they've confirmed that.

00:04:05.635 --> 00:04:08.101
We just don't know with which engine yet.

00:04:10.368 --> 00:04:11.299
The conclusion.

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:15.167
It's quiet, refined, it drives well.

00:04:16.072 --> 00:04:21.593
Unlike its predecessor this car
stands out on the road.

00:04:21.774 --> 00:04:24.929
Opel has made a sexy car...

00:04:25.185 --> 00:04:26.834
...it's a miracle.
