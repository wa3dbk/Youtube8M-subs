00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:09.370
Hi, I'm Harold Enger from Spring-Green Lawn
Care. I'm here to talk to you about two very

00:00:09.370 --> 00:00:16.440
important cultural practices: mowing and watering.
Now, let's talk a little bit about these because

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.800
most home owners misunderstand these practices
and they do it incorrectly.

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:26.680
Let's talk about a lawn mower. The rotary
lawn mower is the most popular mower of them

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:32.390
all. You are going to find these on 90% of
all lawns. The one thing you have to do is

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:37.110
to adjust this properly, because a lot of
times people don’t understand the correct

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:43.171
way to adjust a mower.
Set it on your driveway, take a ruler. From

00:00:43.171 --> 00:00:47.820
the ground to the bottom of that deck should
be about 2 ½ to 3 inches, because for the

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.890
most part, your mower blade runs at the bottom
of that deck. So, make sure you have that

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:58.800
setup high. A lot of mowers have adjustments
and have settings 1,2,3,4,5 – they might

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:05.280
have A,B, C, D, E. That doesn't necessarily
mean 1,2,3,4,5 is inches, that's just settings

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:10.520
number 3, number 4. You need to measure to
make that you've got that mower set at the

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:14.110
right height.
Now, let's talk about mowing height. For the

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:19.710
most part, the majority of grasses within
the United States should be mowed high: 2

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:25.160
½ to 3 inches, sometimes even higher. For
example, the northern turf grasses (your blue

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:30.450
grass, rye grass, fine fescue) that needs
to be mowed 2 ½ to 3 inches from the beginning

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.920
of the spring until you get into the fall.
Maybe in the fall you drop it down a notch

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:39.500
or two, but for the most part, you want it
to be high. Now, we get to our transition

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:45.740
zone, again that Virginia, Kentucky, Tennessee,
Missouri area where you have more of a grass

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:52.060
called tall fescue, there you can even go
3 to 3 ½ inches. It needs to be kept high

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.880
throughout the growing season. You can bring
it down a little bit in the fall, but from

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.770
the first mowing in the spring and on, you
should have it high.

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:02.880
Now, we get down to the south where we have
some other types of grasses, probably the

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.170
only grass that really should be mowed short
is Bermuda grass. That can be cut down to

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:12.150
about an inch, inch and a half. Zoysia, maybe
2 inches. But when you get to the Centipede

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:17.140
and St. Augustine grasses, again, those should
be mowed higher. They will do a lot better.

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:21.860
Now, let's talk about the reasons why we want
to mow them high. Well, think about the grass

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:27.060
blade. The green part of that plant is up
at the top. So, you want to leave as much

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:33.090
of that leaf surface available for the plant
to go through the photosynthetic process.

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:37.790
That's where it produces food – the sunlight
going into the grass blades. You cut it short,

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:42.870
there's less potential for food. So, by having
that plenty high, you'll get lots of sunlight

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:47.610
and the plant will produce lots of food.
Another good reason why is that longer grass

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:51.209
blades will shade the ground underneath and
therefore you're going to keep it cooler,

00:02:51.209 --> 00:02:56.150
and then it's going to stay moist for a longer
period of time. Therefore you don't have to

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:00.820
water as often, and that's a good thing.
Now, the other really good reason why you

00:03:00.820 --> 00:03:07.319
want to mow high is it's a great way to control
weeds. By the longer grass blade shading the

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:12.360
ground underneath, will keep the sun from
hitting down to those weed seeds and causing

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:17.020
them to germinate. So, if you really want
to keep your weeds under control, mow your

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:22.680
grass high. Of course, through the normal
process of mowing, you're going to get a few

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:25.900
weeds, but you're going to have a lot less
if you keep it mowed high.

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:31.709
Now, to show you what will happen when you
scalp a lawn, we did do a little demonstration

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:36.790
for you. And, you can see in that picture
of how bad the lawn looks. All the brown that

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:43.060
shows up, and how the grass around it is nice
and green still. So, mow your grass high.

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:47.330
You will really have a much prettier and healthier
lawn if you do so.

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:50.950
And, the most important thing – you won't
have as many weeds.

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:56.690
Let's talk about our second cultural practice,
and that's watering. Now, a lot of homeowners

00:03:56.690 --> 00:04:02.629
misunderstand the right way to water. If you're
fortunate enough, you have a sprinkler system,

00:04:02.629 --> 00:04:06.270
you can just setup the sprinkler system, it
goes off automatically, and you don't have

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:11.611
to worry about it. Unfortunately, most people
don't have it set properly. Meaning, they

00:04:11.611 --> 00:04:18.209
are watering it maybe 10 minutes per zone,
per day. That's really not enough water on

00:04:18.209 --> 00:04:23.849
a daily basis to really help in providing
a good root system. All that water is staying

00:04:23.849 --> 00:04:28.310
up in the top half an inch or so of the soil,
and therefore that's where all of your roots

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:33.349
are going to grow. We would rather have you
water once or twice a week, water deeply,

00:04:33.349 --> 00:04:38.879
so the roots will go down deeper into the
soil to get that water. If you constantly

00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:43.900
water on the top, you're going to have roots
that are on the top. So, we recommend that

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:49.919
you cut back your sprinkler system to maybe
2 or 3 times a week, but leave it on 20 to

00:04:49.919 --> 00:04:54.439
30 minutes a zone. You will have to adjust
it with your sprinkler system company to make

00:04:54.439 --> 00:04:58.189
sure you're not flooding any area.
Now, if you're like most home owners (like

00:04:58.189 --> 00:05:02.849
me), I don't have a sprinkler system. So,
I have to get out the sprinkler, drag out

00:05:02.849 --> 00:05:08.419
the hose, and setup the sprinkler in different
zones. How long should I leave the sprinkler

00:05:08.419 --> 00:05:12.330
in one location? Well, generally if you leave
it there for about an hour, you'll get about

00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:17.360
a half to three quarters of an inch of water
down in that area. Make sure that you're picking

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:21.849
a sprinkler that's of good quality, you don't
want to get one of the little ones that just

00:05:21.849 --> 00:05:26.699
turn around in a small circle – they don't
get enough water out there. But, if you setup

00:05:26.699 --> 00:05:31.400
your sprinkler, leave it there for about an
hour, that's going to give you plenty of water

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:36.639
so that the water will be pushed out into
the lawn and the roots will go down and get

00:05:36.639 --> 00:05:40.610
it. You will have to move it around several
times, so you might want to do the back one

00:05:40.610 --> 00:05:45.080
day, the front the other. The other problem
that you have to deal with a lot nowadays

00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:49.939
is water restrictions. Sometimes you can water
only on even days or odd days, depending on

00:05:49.939 --> 00:05:56.060
your address. So, you need to follow those
rules that are within your city or area that

00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:59.539
you live in.
But, by watering on that kind of a basis,

00:05:59.539 --> 00:06:04.210
you are going to have a green, nice lawn.
Well, what happens if you can't water that

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:10.189
much? Well, turf is a remarkable plant. It
can go for about a month without getting any

00:06:10.189 --> 00:06:15.610
water whatsoever. Now, it's not going to stay
green, but it will stay alive. And, once you

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:20.030
do get adequate moisture either through rainfall
or you're able to get out there and water,

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:24.530
it will recover.
The worst thing you can do is water your lawn,

00:06:24.530 --> 00:06:28.689
let it go for a week and a half, two weeks,
let it all dry out and water it again, then

00:06:28.689 --> 00:06:33.350
go back into dormancy again. That's going
to be hard on the plant because it uses up

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:38.349
a lot of energy to come back out of dormancy.
Dormancy is okay for the grass to go into,

00:06:38.349 --> 00:06:42.800
it's just a defense mechanism. It's cutting
down what it doesn't need, which is that top

00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:47.990
growth. It wants to keep the heart or the
crown of the plant alive. So, if you're going

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:53.060
to be watering, water consistently. If you
can't, try to get at least an inch of water

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:58.000
on your grass, once a month.
So, today we have talked about 2 things. We've

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:04.289
talked about the way to mow a lawn, and also
about watering. Following these cultural practices

00:07:04.289 --> 00:07:10.250
will really produce a nice looking lawn for
you. That's what we work together with you

00:07:10.250 --> 00:07:15.730
at Spring-Green to develop a good looking
lawn. We look at it as a partnership. We'll

00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:20.590
do the proper fertilization, we'll take care
of any kind of pest control problems, but

00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:24.879
we rely upon you to water it properly and
to mow it properly.

00:07:24.879 --> 00:07:26.939
Together, we can give you a nice looking lawn.
