00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:03.470
Hi everyone. It's Alejandra, and I want to show you one of the 

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:07.280
projects that I recently did inside my home office. So I am big 

00:00:07.280 --> 00:00:11.430
into gift wrap. I have tons of wrapping paper, tons of cards, 

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:15.340
tons of ribbon, all kinds of gift bags, all kinds of stuff to 

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:18.720
make a really cute gift basket or wrap a really pretty present 

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.800
to give to somebody for their birthday or for a holiday or for 

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:25.910
a celebration. So one of the things that wasn’t really working 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:30.550
for me was my gift bags and my gift tags. So, for example, I 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:35.770
used to keep all of my gift bags in this clear box at the top 

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:39.420
of my desk. And every time I needed a gift bag, I would run and 

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.560
get a step stool, bring it back, take the heavy bin down, find 

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:45.430
what I was looking for, and then have to put it back. It was 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:50.750
just a big pain in the butt. So what I did was I took that box down, 

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:54.930
I sorted all my gift bags by category; so I sorted the large 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.110
ones together, the "Birthday" ones together, the "Holiday" ones, 

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:04.060
the "All Occasion," the wine bags; and I put them in this large, 

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:07.270
clear door pocket organizer that I got from The Container Store. 

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:11.780
I also labeled each of the sections with yellow label tape so, 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.030
it’s very easy to read and it stands out, because if you use a 

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:19.880
white label or a clear label, it’s going to easily get lost with 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:23.790
all of the color and design I the gift bags, and you won’t even 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.400
see the label. So, this is working out really well. The second 

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:31.450
part of the project was organizing all of my gift tags. So, gift 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:37.170
tags are those little, um, these little gift tags that you hang 

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.380
on a present or hang on a gift bag when you don’t have a real card 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:46.290
or if you’re giving a very small gift. Now, I, I have, like, I 

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:49.340
don’t know, maybe like, sixty of these cards and the way I was 

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.450
keeping them before was, again, in a shoe box. They were all contained. 

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:56.190
It was working, but I could have taken it a step further and 

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:00.700
sorted them by category. So, what I did was, I went to 

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.410
The Container Store, I’m a big fan of The Container Store, 

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:08.360
and I got this jewelry bag organizer and it’s made for 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:12.280
storing necklaces, bracelets, rings, earrings, all kinds of 

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:15.990
small jewelry, and it has a hanger at the top, um, because 

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:19.260
you’re supposed to hang it on the rod inside your closet, but, 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.440
one of the things that I always do, and this is something that 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.650
I tell all of my clients and anybody that I’m working with, 

00:02:25.650 --> 00:02:30.570
is that if you’re going to be shopping for organizing products, 

00:02:30.570 --> 00:02:33.110
go to the store and look at each of the products and say, 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:36.920
“What else can I use this product for?” So, on the box or on 

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.530
the shelf it’s going to give you suggested uses. 

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:43.570
So, for this one it said, “Perfect for jewelry,” but if you think, 

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:48.690
“What else is small and difficult to contain that I can use this for?” 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:52.440
And for me, I thought of gift tags because it’s perfect; 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.150
perfect size, they fit really nicely in the pockets, 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:59.160
but you could also, for this, you could also use, like, Q-tips, 

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.900
or cotton balls, or bobby pins, or hair ties. There’s all 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:05.110
kinds of stuff you could store inside of it. But, anyways, 

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:09.720
let me show you what I did. So, let me come on this side. 

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.130
So, I put all my hanging tags at the very top, and then down 

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:16.280
here I have all the other ones. I have, like, “Get Well,” 

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:21.690
“New Home,” “Wedding,” “All Occasion,” “Birthday,” “Kids Birthday,” 

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:25.810
“New Baby,” and then down here in these pockets I have all 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:30.050
of my gift card holders. But, anyways, it works perfectly. 

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:35.000
All the gift cards are now sorted by category, and it’s so simple. 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.080
I love it! It’s so easy! I look at it and it’s clean, 

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:41.930
it’s easy to find, it’s accessible. And now that I’m done 

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:45.100
with this, I just hang this behind the gift bag organizer 

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:51.080
and all my gift stuff is now in this corner, very accessible, 

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:53.213
easy to use, and very organized.
