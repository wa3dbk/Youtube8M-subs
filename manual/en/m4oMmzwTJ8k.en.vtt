00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:31.050
With a name that includes words like Higemaru,
it's no wonder this arcade machine never quite

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:32.750
made it to American waters.

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:36.690
That's a pirate-y way of saying it was never
released in the States.

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:41.190
And it's a shame, because this is one of the
smartest, most enjoyable arcade puzzlers of

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:42.190
its time.

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:45.970
Who said pirates aren't educated?

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:51.239
It's Pirate Ship Higemaru for the PlayStation
3.

00:00:51.239 --> 00:01:03.749
So this is the third game in the fifth and
final pack of games for the Capcom Arcade

00:01:03.749 --> 00:01:04.749
Cabinet.

00:01:04.749 --> 00:01:10.120
It comes with the obscure SonSon and the classic
1942, three of Capcom's earliest arcade games.

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:14.550
And in terms of originality, this one actually
falls somewhere between the other two.

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:20.909
There were plenty of games like 1942, virtually
none like SonSon...and just a few like Pirate

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:21.909
Ship Higemaru.

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:25.619
I guess the obvious comparisons are Bomberman,
maybe Pac-Man.

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:28.900
The game takes place on the deck of a pirate
ship.

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:30.070
Perhaps a poop deck.

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:36.390
You play as a sailor stuck on said ship, trapped
by the sleaziest sleaze of the seven seas.

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.320
Fortunately, they're also messy.

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:42.860
All their scattered barrels have turned said
poop deck into a maze.

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:44.720
And therein lies the game.

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:49.460
So, like Bomberman, you're running through
a maze while trying to outsmart your enemies.

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:55.881
A fitting comparison to make, but better yet...Higemaru
is actually Capcom's take on a 1982 SEGA game

00:01:55.881 --> 00:01:56.881
called Pengo.

00:01:56.881 --> 00:02:03.090
It had almost the same premise, but...with
penguins instead of pirates.

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:05.549
As a Pittsburgher, I love them both.

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:10.600
Anyway, I'm a big fan of Pirate Ship Higemaru.

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:17.480
Where a lot of classic arcade games were more
about reflexes and old-school gaming skill,

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.650
this one isâ€”againâ€”a bit more clever.

00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:20.650
A bit smarter.

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:24.720
See, if you want to beat these pirates, you
have to use barrels as weapons.

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.350
Thing is those barrels are also your protection.

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:34.950
So the more you throw, the more open the deck
becomes...the less walls between you and the

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:35.950
scallywags.

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:39.209
So there is some strategy to all this barrel
chucking.

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:43.909
Pirate Ship Higemaru may not have the name
recognition of Capcom games like Commando

00:02:43.909 --> 00:02:48.590
or Ghosts 'n Goblins, but this is a classic
that certainly belongs next to them.

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.160
And the great thing about it is that...it's
actually very different from the other games

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:53.160
in this compilation.

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:58.410
I like the gameplay, I like the pirate theme...I
just like Higemaru.

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:08.709
And if you've never played it before, I'm
betting you will, too.

00:03:08.709 --> 00:03:12.579
Matey.
