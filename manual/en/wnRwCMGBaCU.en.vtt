00:00:20.362 --> 00:00:21.596
(Kitten)
Can't get me up here!

00:00:21.596 --> 00:00:23.139

Come on down kitty.

00:00:23.139 --> 00:00:23.702

00:00:25.223 --> 00:00:26.299

00:00:27.188 --> 00:00:28.284
Yaay!

00:00:28.935 --> 00:00:29.515
Oh!

00:00:31.053 --> 00:00:33.626
(Kitten) ♫ Everybody's doin' the Michigan rag.

00:00:32.216 --> 00:00:33.016
(Nalts) Lovey!

00:00:34.139 --> 00:00:34.795
*plop*

00:00:35.469 --> 00:00:36.245
*plop*

00:00:36.852 --> 00:00:38.370
(Nalts)
Are you going to flush?

00:00:39.754 --> 00:00:40.660
(Kitten)
♫ Hello, my baby.

00:00:40.892 --> 00:00:42.187
♫ Hello, my darlin'.

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.026
♫ Hello, my ragtime gal.

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:42.014
(Nalts) Guys!

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:46.589
Guys, guys, guys...come see the kitten.

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:48.948
Guys!

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.587
Guys, come see this!

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:55.816
Oh.

00:00:58.584 --> 00:01:00.175
No, I swear right before you walked in

00:01:00.409 --> 00:01:04.152
Lovey was dancin' and on the toilet...

00:01:08.912 --> 00:01:10.908
(Katie)
Dad, what's with all the new cameras?

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:14.076
Are you finally going to broadcast our whole life 24/7?

00:01:14.497 --> 00:01:16.465
(Nalts)
No. These are video security cameras.

00:01:17.342 --> 00:01:20.337
So I can see and record what really goes on in this house.

00:01:21.371 --> 00:01:23.831
(Patrick)
Cool! So you can catch burglars and stalkers?

00:01:24.146 --> 00:01:24.765
(Nalts)
No.

00:01:25.125 --> 00:01:27.293
(Grant)
So you can bust us eating junk food?

00:01:27.293 --> 00:01:28.087
(Nalts)
No.

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:34.422
(Nalts)
No, to record Lovey's tricks.

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:36.214
To prove to you I'm not insane.

00:01:36.888 --> 00:01:37.742
Oh, you'll see.

00:01:37.742 --> 00:01:39.978
That cat dances and sings and

00:01:39.978 --> 00:01:42.097
does skateboards and karaokes.

00:01:42.877 --> 00:01:44.454
Well I'll have the last laugh when that cat

00:01:44.454 --> 00:01:47.311
makes me richer than you could ever dream!

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.552
*maniacal laughter*

00:01:53.672 --> 00:01:55.903
(Nalts)
Oh, I've got all these Logitech cameras

00:01:55.903 --> 00:01:57.369
set up to catch Lovey in the act.

00:02:09.861 --> 00:02:10.500
(Nalts)
Oh yeah!

00:02:10.298 --> 00:02:13.293
I'm going to catch Lovey on tape and then monetize it.

00:02:17.521 --> 00:02:19.720
(Nalts)
Charlie, will you stop with the gratuitous plugs?

00:02:21.918 --> 00:02:23.150
(Nalts)
Oh, motion detector alert!

00:02:23.507 --> 00:02:24.365
I got her!

00:02:25.679 --> 00:02:26.627
Ha ha ha ha ha!

00:02:27.127 --> 00:02:29.576
Where's the computer?

00:02:29.576 --> 00:02:32.088
All the video was stored on the hard drive!

00:02:33.208 --> 00:02:34.613
Lovey? Where are you?

00:02:43.978 --> 00:02:44.896
(Kitten)
Wheeheew!

00:02:44.896 --> 00:02:45.911
Yippee!

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:48.189
Yay!

00:02:48.707 --> 00:02:49.357
Oh!

00:02:50.871 --> 00:02:52.103
(Dog)
Uh, you know I can probably

00:02:52.103 --> 00:02:54.833
recover most of what's on that hard drive.

00:02:54.833 --> 00:02:58.200
(Nalts)
Guys! The dog can do computers!

00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:59.383
The dog can do computers!

00:02:59.678 --> 00:03:01.207
♫ Nalts, he is the one for us.

00:03:01.426 --> 00:03:03.203
♫ Nalts, he's the one who cares for us.

00:03:03.483 --> 00:03:05.122
♫ Nalts, he is our only Nalts.

00:03:05.526 --> 00:03:07.649
♫ Nalts, Nalts, Nalts, Nalts, Nalts, Nalts!
