Hi my name is Greg Goldberg I'm here on behalf
of Expert Village and you can check us out

00:00:02.960 --> 00:00:12.009
a www.minettis.com. In this episode, we are
going to be talking about pizza, chicken Alfredo

00:00:12.009 --> 00:00:17.280
pizza, how to add the cheese and the chicken
to it. It is very simple you just grab your

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:23.760
hands full of the mozzarella or your favorite
cheese. Place you hand right by the sauce

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:48.140
edge. You would sprinkle on a little estrange
there or you put to much just pick it right

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:57.269
up and put it back somewhere else. Put some
back here again as well. That is a perfectly

00:00:57.269 --> 00:01:05.890
cheese pizza. Then we are going to take the
chicken. Our tongs and just place that on

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:14.510
this is the chicken that we cooked in the
white wine reduction. A little bit of garlic,

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:30.091
salt, and pepper nothing to fancy. It is always
good to arrange the toppings, no matter what

00:01:30.091 --> 00:01:36.160
you are putting on there, so that every slice
has some of everything. In this case, it is

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:41.750
easy because it is just one topping. You always
want to do your toppings in layers when you

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:49.470
are making your pizza. You should put the
first topping on all the way through the pizza

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.210
or half of the pizza whatever you are doing.
Then you add the second topping and then you

00:01:52.210 --> 00:02:04.210
add the third topping. Finish it the last
of the chicken there and we are ready to put

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:04.460
that in the oven.
