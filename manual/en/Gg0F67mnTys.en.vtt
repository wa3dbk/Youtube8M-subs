00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:11.290
&gt;&gt; JUDY FORTIN: The spinal cord is a very
important part of our central nervous system,

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:15.260
the overall system that controls and coordinates
the activities of our bodies.

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:16.260
&gt;&gt; DR.

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.199
JEFFERY SALOMONE: Our brain is surrounded
by the skull, while our spinal cord is surrounded

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:24.690
by rings of bone called vertebrae, and both
are covered by a protective membrane.

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:30.160
Together, the vertebrae and the membrane make
up our spinal column, or our backbones.

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:35.329
The backbone, which protects our spinal cord,
starts at the base of our skull and ends just

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:37.270
above our hips.

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:41.690
The spinal cord is about 18 inches long and
extends from the base of the brain, down the

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:46.319
middle of the back, to just below the last
rib in the waist area.

00:00:46.319 --> 00:00:51.069
The main job of the spinal cord is to be the
communication system between the brain and

00:00:51.069 --> 00:00:56.250
the body by carrying messages that allow us
to move and feel sensation.

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:02.289
Our spinal nerve cells, called neurons, carry
the messages to and from the spinal cord.

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:06.409
These messages leave the spinal cord through
openings in the vertebrae.

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:11.960
Spinal nerve roots branch off the spinal cord
in pairs, one going to each side of the body.

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.399
Each nerve has a specific job for movement
and feeling.

00:01:15.399 --> 00:01:22.119
They tell the muscles in your arms, hands,
fingers, legs, toes, chest and other parts

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:25.750
of your body when and how to move.

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:31.130
When a spinal cord injury occurs, sensation
and movement may be interrupted, resulting

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:36.210
in a temporary or permanent loss of function
and paralysis.

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.640
In general, the higher on the spinal cord
the injury occurs, the greater loss of function

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.580
the person may experience.

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:46.189
The vertebrae are grouped into sections according
to their location.

00:01:46.189 --> 00:01:50.710
For example, the seven vertebrae in the neck
are called the Cervical Vertebrae.

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:54.700
The vertebrae are numbered top to bottom - from
the head to the tailbone.

00:01:54.700 --> 00:02:01.469
The top vertebra is called C-1, the next is
C-2, C-3, and so on.

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:06.939
Cervical spinal cord injuries usually cause
loss of function in the arms and legs, resulting

00:02:06.939 --> 00:02:11.069
in tetraplegia, which is also called “quadriplegia.”

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:14.160
The next twelve vertebrae are called the Thoracic
Vertebrae.

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.370
The first, T-1, is where the top rib attaches.

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:24.910
Injuries in the thoracic region usually affect
the trunk and the legs and result in paraplegia.

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:29.970
The Lumbar Vertebrae are the five vertebrae
in the lower back between the thoracic vertebrae,

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:33.500
where the ribs attach, and the pelvis, or
hip bone.

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:38.100
The Sacral Vertebrae run from the pelvis to
the end of the spinal column.

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:44.210
Injuries to the five Lumbar Vertebrae (L-1
thru L-5) and similarly to the five Sacral

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:50.190
Vertebrae (S-1 thru S-5) generally result
in some loss of functioning in the hips and

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:51.190
legs.

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:55.620
&gt;&gt; JUDY FORTIN: Whether the cause of a spinal
injury or illness is traumatic or non-traumatic,

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:58.800
the damage affects the nerve fibers passing
through the injured area.

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:03.540
That can damage or weaken part or all of the
corresponding muscles and nerves below the

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:04.980
injury site.

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:10.060
Doctors have already or will assign your loved
one a level of injury that corresponds to

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.180
the damage below the injury.

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:17.060
In Chapter Five, we’ll explain more about
these injury levels and how they can impact

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:18.750
you or your loved one.

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:23.560
Right now, we’ll move on to Chapter Three,
to inform you about some things that may occur

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.820
soon after the immediate spinal cord injury
or illness.
