00:00:04.839 --> 00:00:07.059
How to Play Checkers.

00:00:07.059 --> 00:00:11.799
This game may seem old-fashioned, but it's
just as challenging as a video game—and

00:00:11.799 --> 00:00:15.110
your grandparents will actually know how to
play it!

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:22.400
You will need A checker board 12.0 black checkers
12.0 red checkers and another player.

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:23.530
Step 1.

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:26.630
Sit across from the other player, with the
board between you.

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:30.180
Turn the board so that you each have a red
corner square on your right.

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:35.329
If your board isn't black and red, just imagine
that the lighter color on your board is red,

00:00:35.329 --> 00:00:37.770
and the darker color is black to follow these
instructions.

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:40.680
Step 2.

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:42.360
Decide who's going first.

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:46.350
You can flip a coin, base it on who won the
last game, or just agree.

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.579
Whatever you choose, the starting player gets
the black checkers and the other player gets

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:51.579
the red.

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:52.579
Step 3.

00:00:52.579 --> 00:00:54.200
Set up the board.

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:59.600
Each player arranges all twelve of his checkers
on the black squares (and only black squares!)

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.579
of the first three rows of his side of the
board.

00:01:03.579 --> 00:01:04.890
Step 4.

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.560
The first player (black) begins by moving
any one of his checkers in the row closest

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:12.850
to the middle of the board diagonally one
space.

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:18.149
Checkers can only move diagonally, which means
the game is played entirely on the black squares.

00:01:18.149 --> 00:01:20.460
Step 5.

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:24.389
The next player moves one of his checkers
diagonally one space.

00:01:24.389 --> 00:01:29.399
At this stage of the game, you can only move
your pieces forward.

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:30.399
Step 6.

00:01:30.399 --> 00:01:37.829
Keep taking turns this way, moving another
checker or the same checker further forward.

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:44.700
Step 7.

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:49.429
On your turn, if your opponent's checker is
in front of you—that is, on a black square

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:54.069
diagonal to yours—and there's an empty square
on the other side, you can jump your checker

00:01:54.069 --> 00:01:56.670
over his, landing in the empty square.

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:02.149
Take the other player's checker that you just
jumped over off the board and put it to the

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:03.299
side.

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:09.410
Remember: if your checker is jumpable on your
opponent's turn, he can jump and capture it,

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:13.790
so before that happens, try to move out of
the way or fill in the empty square behind

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.840
you so there's no place for him to jump.

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.110
Step 8.

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:21.950
You can jump over and capture more than one
checker in a turn.

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:26.360
Just remember that there must be one empty
square between each one, so that you're leapfrogging

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:30.030
one checker at a time—not long-jumping over
two.

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:31.299
Step 9.

00:02:31.299 --> 00:02:33.540
Continue to take turns moving and jumping.

00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:37.450
If you manage to get a checker all the way
to the other side of the board, tell your

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:39.090
opponent, 'Crown me!'

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.980
He'll have to take one of the checkers of
yours that he captured and place it on top

00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:44.290
of your checker.

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.450
Now you've got a tall 'king' that can move
both forward and backward.

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:49.900
Step 10.

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:54.790
Continue to take turns moving, jumping, and
being crowned, until one player captures all

00:02:54.790 --> 00:03:07.260
of the other's checkers.

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:12.239
Did you know Checkers is such an old game
that Egyptian kings played it while the pyramids

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:15.339
were being built—around 4,000 years ago!
