Mr. Gibbs:
Hi guys. Good afternoon and
welcome to First Question.

00:00:03.191 --> 00:00:04.024
We'll do a few today.

00:00:04.024 --> 00:00:06.991
So let's start with John
Andrea (sic) who asks:

00:00:06.991 --> 00:00:10.858
What's your reaction to
the WikiLeaks revelation?

00:00:10.858 --> 00:00:12.024
John, thanks for the question.

00:00:12.024 --> 00:00:16.024
Obviously, this is a subject
that has taken a lot of our

00:00:16.024 --> 00:00:20.458
time in the last few days
when we found out that more

00:00:20.458 --> 00:00:27.091
than 250,000 documents, private
discussions had between foreign

00:00:27.091 --> 00:00:30.391
service professionals --
foreign policy professionals

00:00:30.391 --> 00:00:31.591
and the state department.

00:00:31.591 --> 00:00:33.925
Obviously, the leak
is very disconcerting;

00:00:33.925 --> 00:00:37.591
these are highly classified
cables and puts at risk our

00:00:37.591 --> 00:00:42.591
ability to do our foreign policy
in a way that promotes our

00:00:42.591 --> 00:00:46.024
security and protects those
that have honest discussions

00:00:46.024 --> 00:00:47.391
with other governments.

00:00:47.391 --> 00:00:50.191
President Obama, as you
know from the campaign,

00:00:50.191 --> 00:00:54.158
is a huge proponent of open and
transparent governments and we

00:00:54.158 --> 00:00:58.325
seek every day to ensure that
nothing is over classified in

00:00:58.325 --> 00:01:01.792
this administration, but
clearly the revelation of

00:01:01.792 --> 00:01:08.958
250,000 documents that are
highly classified is dangerous

00:01:08.958 --> 00:01:14.191
and is a threat to our ability
to conduct a foreign policy.

00:01:14.191 --> 00:01:19.325
Next -- let's see -- where is
the question -- there it is.

00:01:19.325 --> 00:01:21.758
Scott asks: What is the
administration's stand

00:01:21.758 --> 00:01:23.391
on extending UI?

00:01:23.391 --> 00:01:26.458
UI stands for unemployment
insurance benefits.

00:01:26.458 --> 00:01:31.491
As Scott realizes, this week
there is an expiration in

00:01:31.491 --> 00:01:33.024
unemployment benefits.

00:01:33.024 --> 00:01:37.692
The administration's stand is
today what it's been all along.

00:01:37.692 --> 00:01:41.491
And that is that it's important
for those that have suffered in

00:01:41.491 --> 00:01:43.258
this great economic downturn.

00:01:43.258 --> 00:01:46.758
That they have the unemployment
benefits that they deserve;

00:01:46.758 --> 00:01:49.892
that help to support
them and pays their rate,

00:01:49.892 --> 00:01:54.725
it pays their mortgage, it helps
them put food on their table,

00:01:54.725 --> 00:01:59.425
and makes sure that their
kids have enough to live on.

00:01:59.425 --> 00:02:04.925
So we think it's good policy,
it's good economic stimulus,

00:02:04.925 --> 00:02:10.024
and it's important that
we continue UI benefits

00:02:10.024 --> 00:02:12.892
for this economy.

00:02:12.892 --> 00:02:17.191
Lastly, Kevin asks: How's
the President's lip?

00:02:17.191 --> 00:02:20.925
Kevin, I just came from the Oval
Office and asked the President a

00:02:20.925 --> 00:02:22.591
little bit about his lip.

00:02:22.591 --> 00:02:27.525
It doesn't look real good, but
he said it doesn't hurt at all.

00:02:27.525 --> 00:02:30.091
The President has seen the
doctor since the accident

00:02:30.091 --> 00:02:35.692
happened; the inadvertent
elbow, on Friday.

00:02:35.692 --> 00:02:38.358
He -- the doctor says
the lip is healing well.

00:02:38.358 --> 00:02:41.725
Again, it doesn't look right,
but as the President said,

00:02:41.725 --> 00:02:43.858
you should see what the
other guy's looks like.

00:02:43.858 --> 00:02:47.091
He should heal fine and it
doesn't hurt him at all.

00:02:47.091 --> 00:02:47.758
Thanks guys.
