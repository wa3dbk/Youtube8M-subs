from anyway

00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:21.450
abby i get my for that are that there is
also that excellence in predicting the

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.210
future award which is this concert for a
fortune tellers mighty ducks and the

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:25.740

reminded me i predict and going to come
in third fourth or fifth yeah

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:33.240
unfortunately got a bit of confidence

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.069
yet equity actively wanted better
because of that

00:01:36.069 --> 00:01:38.950
uh... and the funny thing is that it's
not actually to get people to become

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:42.060
psychics and to get people to go into
you like the prediction market the

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:43.579
financial markets

00:01:43.579 --> 00:01:47.950

tape

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:04.690
and those are the man that is why i
think we're dead center of the trust on

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:05.509
the right

00:02:05.509 --> 00:02:10.919
looks like just a regular dressing up as
sulu and that's the way that left

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:13.599
altair antarctica outside

00:02:13.599 --> 00:02:17.400

00:02:28.099 --> 00:02:30.859
yes there is this something quite as
doctor combative

00:02:30.859 --> 00:02:33.999
uh... phyllis m

00:02:33.999 --> 00:02:39.029

detached house you direct us

00:02:47.209 --> 00:02:50.269
so this is an innocent second prime-time
test it's not

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:54.870
it's sponsored by a duck tape company
and so if you caught me other than you

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.639

money and doctor and they're going to

00:02:57.639 --> 00:03:02.400

forgetting that background in illinois

00:03:16.919 --> 00:03:21.010

scholarship and a short sellers shyness
