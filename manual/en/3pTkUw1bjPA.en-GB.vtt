00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:05.130
This is Fran Bradshaw's straw bale house.
It's quite difficult to see what's going on

00:00:05.130 --> 00:00:09.670
from the outside because it's being protected
from the elements but it's progressing well.

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:16.950
The timber frame's in, the straw bale work's
done and it's all compressed. And a little

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:21.480
bit of the plastering has been done on the
outside but none of the plastering inside

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:24.929
has been done. And some of the tapes have
been plastered in but some of them haven't

00:00:24.929 --> 00:00:29.840
been. So it's quite a good moment to find
out a bit about all the different parts and

00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:34.381
how they are all working separately. That's
what I'm hoping we'll find out anyway. It's

00:00:34.381 --> 00:00:38.970
hoped that this house will meet the Passivhaus
standard and it's been designed from the outset

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:43.440
to work with straw. It's got a timber frame
but it's very close

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.690
to being a load bearing building in the way
we've constructed it because the framework

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:53.750
is on the inside and we've got a 30mm plaster
gap behind the framework, but the airtight

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:59.500
layer is on the outside. And the straw is
compressed as it would be in a load bearing

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:05.070
building, all the way round the outside, and
we've had to design the frame very particularly

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:09.929
to make that compression possible because
we have to have part of the frame centrally

00:01:09.929 --> 00:01:15.020
above the straw. This is a much earlier test
of the air tightness than normal because its

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.890
purpose is to see how the straw performs all
by itself. We have our test equipment. We'll

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:24.670
set it up in the doorway. We'll blow air out
so that the inside is at a lower pressure

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:29.560
and then we'll basically go around looking
for leaks, feeling with our hands, using smoke

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:34.369
to look for leaks. The obvious places being
around the windows and doors, possibly the

00:01:34.369 --> 00:01:42.670
edge of the floor but essentially it's a process
of investigation. So that's fully open, which

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:50.389
is disappointing for me because that would
test a small school for Passivhaus. That is

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:57.639
showing a flow of just under 9000 cubic metres
an hour and we reckon that the volume is just

00:01:57.639 --> 00:02:06.200
over 300. So 9000 divided by 300 is about
30. It doesn't take too much investigation

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:11.180
to realise that the work hasn't advanced enough
to get any meaningful readings. It's got a

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:17.411
5mm gap right the way round it. A 5mm gap
all the way round. Well then! So until that

00:02:17.411 --> 00:02:22.540
tape's rendered in . . . Even though there's
a lot of air leakage it's still a good exercise

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:32.230
to establish where the air is getting in.
So it's not the straw? No, it's the contraband

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:35.569
or whatever it is, the equivalent that coming
up through . . . Well we've found out that

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:40.640
it wasn't really as ready as we thought for
the test. There were bits where we found major

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.379
leaks where actually it's because it's incomplete.
For me what it's told us is that the bulk

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:51.590
of the straw is absolutely fine and that we
have to pay attention to the interfaces between

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:56.819
the two bales, which is what we do, and to
stuffing securely. And those things are really

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:57.530
important.
