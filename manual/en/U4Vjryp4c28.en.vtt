00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:04.860
Foamy: Fuckin' shit, man! Look at this!

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:05.640
Germaine: What's that?

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:06.940
F: It's a CD, asshole!

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:10.960
I bought it used from a website and when I got it, there were all sorts of scratches on it.

00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:12.700
This shit is skippin' like a schoolgirl!

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:14.640
G: There's an outfit I haven't worn in a while.

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:15.960
Hmm.

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:21.980
Anyway, why buy CD's? Most people just download their music through some online shop or whatever.

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:24.300
F: Yeah, but dude, this album was only $1 used.

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.040
Why would I buy a compressed version of an album for $10 when I can get it for $4 with shipping and rip it myself?

00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:31.760
I'm saving $6 with every disc I purchase.

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:34.420
Plus, I can resell it and make a little money back.

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:36.640
You can't do that with MP3's.

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:39.040
G: Yeah, but MP3's don't skip.

00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:40.760
F: Yeah, they just sound like compressed garbage.

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:43.140
G: I don't know, the sound quality is better than cassettes.

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.700
I had a cassette player when I was a kid and that shit was so annoying.

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.440
I had to rewind my cassettes with a pencil, dammit. A PENCIL!

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:53.060
I don't wanna go back to that analog nightmare.

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:55.560
F: Okay. Fine. Cassettes sucked.

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:58.400
I just can't understand why people can't treat their CD's a little better.

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.300
This shit was a coaster! See? Coffee stain!

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:04.220
G: Can't you just let the format die?

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.660
I mean, music is produced so poorly anyway these days that all the sound is bricked.

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:13.580
F: Yeah, what's up with that? Recordings from around '94 and earlier sounds so much better.

00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:16.020
Someone's fuckin' with my dynamic range and it's pissin' me off!

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.220
G: It's just gonna get worse.

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.260
F: I'd like to track down the engineers and music producers that are screwing with the recordings

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:23.160
and shit in their ear canals so they can get an accurate taste of what their music sounds like!

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:25.100
G: Uh, that's a little extreme.

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.460
F: Dude, people get paid to poop on boobs!

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:30.400
Ear canal feces is cake, man! FUCKIN' CAKE!

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.000
G: See? Now I want cake!

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:34.200
Fuck!

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:41.100
(END)

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:47.320
F: Stop fuckin' with CD's because it's skippin' like a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a schoolgirl!

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.780
ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah schoolgirl!

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:54.380
G: Ooh, I want some chocolate cake with some chocolate icing, yum, yum yum, chocolate cake.

00:01:54.380 --> 00:01:57.060
Chocolate icing in my belly, yum, yum, yum,

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:03.320
chocolate-chocolate-chocolate-chocolate-chocolate-chocolate-chocolate-chocolate-chocolate-chocolate-chocolate-chocolate-chocolate-chocolate-chocolate-chocolate-chocolate cake.
