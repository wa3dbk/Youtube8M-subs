Anatomy Structure Basics Lesson

00:00:10.699 --> 00:00:12.885
Hello,
I am Commander Meitar.

00:00:12.997 --> 00:00:15.705
Today we will go over
Anatomy Structure Basics

00:00:15.817 --> 00:00:20.369
In this lesson you will gain basic knowlege in the
body's biology and its functions

00:00:20.747 --> 00:00:24.541
This less is critical for understand the
material in the next Anatomy lessons.

00:00:25.127 --> 00:00:28.601
First, we will define Anatomy and Physiology.

00:00:28.913 --> 00:00:33.298
Anatomy is the study of the body's
structure and its different systems,

00:00:33.603 --> 00:00:36.933
the location of its different
organs and their structure.

00:00:37.263 --> 00:00:42.424
Physiology is the study of the processes in the body.

00:00:42.662 --> 00:00:45.482
For example, we will discuss the liver.

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.602
Anatomically, we will discuss the liver's
placement and the cells that make it up.

00:00:50.988 --> 00:00:57.210
And physiologically, the processes and tasks of the liver,
and the mechanisms with which it carries them out.

00:00:57.939 --> 00:01:02.662
After we have defined anatomy and physiology
we will define the characteristics of life.

00:01:03.376 --> 00:01:06.599
There are six characteristics for all living creatures,

00:01:06.611 --> 00:01:10.346
Humans, animals and single-cells organisms alike.

00:01:11.004 --> 00:01:13.706
The first is reproduction.

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:16.643
Reproduction (of some kind) occurs
in every living creature.

00:01:17.266 --> 00:01:22.521
Growth, oxygen consumption and
nourishment for making energy

00:01:22.849 --> 00:01:24.938
reaction to environment, and death.

00:01:25.111 --> 00:01:28.171
Every living creature dies eventually.

00:01:28.955 --> 00:01:33.283
The smallest unit that has all of
these characteristics is the the cell.

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:38.500
There are around 200 types of cells that
differ and structure and function.

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:44.627
Still, all cells have a common structure of a
Membrane, Cytoplasm, and Nucleus.

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:50.853
The membrane (or cell wall) functions as a separator
of the cell's inside from its exterior environment.

00:01:51.381 --> 00:01:57.252
It is a selective membrance, meaning it controls
the material going in and coming out of the cell

00:01:57.613 --> 00:02:00.402
Then, we have the cytoplasm.

00:02:00.749 --> 00:02:04.572
Cyto is cell, plasma is liquid,
so it means the cell's liquid.

00:02:04.787 --> 00:02:11.803
The cytoplasm is mostly made of liquids
and inside float the cell's organelles and systems.

00:02:11.989 --> 00:02:16.017
We also have the cell's Nucleus.

00:02:16.191 --> 00:02:19.063
The cells nucleus contains the cell's DNA.

00:02:19.599 --> 00:02:24.452
The cell recieves certain material, and
turns it into energy or other substances.

00:02:24.489 --> 00:02:28.240
It emits the toxins and waste that are made in the process.

00:02:28.781 --> 00:02:31.020
This process is called Metabolism.

00:02:31.164 --> 00:02:33.808
(the exchange of materials)

00:02:34.404 --> 00:02:37.511
As stated earlier, the cell's membrane's function

00:02:37.571 --> 00:02:41.023
is to select the material going in and out of the cell.

00:02:41.518 --> 00:02:45.120
There are two kinds of transitions between material in the cell;

00:02:45.196 --> 00:02:47.550
Passive and Active.

00:02:48.276 --> 00:02:49.947
First we will discuss Diffusion.

00:02:50.001 --> 00:02:55.562
Meaning, the passing of a substance from a place with high concentation to one with a lower concentration.

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:57.262
As we can see here,

00:02:58.741 --> 00:03:02.847
Osmosis, in contrast, is the passing of liquid or solvent,

00:03:03.022 --> 00:03:05.457
From a a place with low concentation

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:07.918
To a place with higher concentation.

00:03:08.131 --> 00:03:11.345
These types of transitions are passive.

00:03:12.082 --> 00:03:14.843
An active tranition, as seen here,

00:03:15.084 --> 00:03:18.418
is a transition going against the concentation gradient,

00:03:18.421 --> 00:03:20.442
a transition which requires energy.

00:03:20.935 --> 00:03:24.149
The transition is done by pumps.

00:03:24.728 --> 00:03:26.793
Now we will talk about cell respiration.

00:03:27.234 --> 00:03:31.455
Aerobic respiration is done with the presence of oxygen

00:03:31.533 --> 00:03:34.079
and creates a large amount of oxygen.

00:03:34.617 --> 00:03:37.039
The body taken in food and oxygen,

00:03:37.029 --> 00:03:39.023
makes a lot of energy,

00:03:39.146 --> 00:03:42.884
and also a small amount of waste and CO2.

00:03:43.657 --> 00:03:47.903
Anaerobic respiration, in contrast, is almost without oxygen.

00:03:48.158 --> 00:03:53.113
It creates little energy, a lot of CO2 and lactic acids.

00:03:53.427 --> 00:03:57.856
To compare, in aerobic breathing the body creates 36 energy units

00:03:58.192 --> 00:04:01.424
and only 2 energy units in anaerobic breathing.

00:04:02.945 --> 00:04:04.723
Now we will discuss pH.

00:04:04.944 --> 00:04:08.890
pH is a mathematical value for the amount
of Hydrogen ions in a solution.

00:04:09.287 --> 00:04:12.310
The value is betweeo 0 and 14.

00:04:12.406 --> 00:04:16.920
When the pH is between 0 and 7 it is considered acidic

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:20.339
and between 7-14 is considered basic.

00:04:20.987 --> 00:04:22.690
For example, in orange juice,

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:26.877
The pH is 3.5, meaning that orange juice

00:04:27.077 --> 00:04:28.526
is relatively acidic.

00:04:29.425 --> 00:04:33.148
In contrast, the pH of bleach is 12.5,

00:04:33.362 --> 00:04:35.909
meaning that bleach is basic.

00:04:36.475 --> 00:04:41.690
the normal pH in blood is around 7.35-7.45.

00:04:43.063 --> 00:04:45.540
All our bodily conditions are in a normal state,

00:04:45.693 --> 00:04:48.061
and stay fixed, compared to our environment,

00:04:48.061 --> 00:04:49.479
which is changing constantly.

00:04:50.032 --> 00:04:54.585
The body's internal environment stays
stable and is uninterrupted by outside forces

00:04:54.585 --> 00:04:56.013
such as weather

00:04:56.292 --> 00:04:59.233
this property is called Homeostasis.

00:04:59.879 --> 00:05:02.299
Now we will quickly go over the body's parts.

00:05:02.347 --> 00:05:04.413
From the smallest to the largest.

00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:08.048
First, we have the cell, the smallest unit of life.

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:09.372
(as previously discussed)

00:05:09.756 --> 00:05:12.897
A number of cells with a similar structure and funtion

00:05:12.929 --> 00:05:14.589
create a tissue together.

00:05:15.056 --> 00:05:19.046
A number of connected tissues
that carry out a function

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:20.910
create an organ.

00:05:21.444 --> 00:05:23.680
A number of organs with a common function

00:05:23.742 --> 00:05:25.250
are a system.

00:05:25.893 --> 00:05:28.496
The are 7 main systems in the body.

00:05:28.761 --> 00:05:30.439
Which we will name now.

00:05:31.288 --> 00:05:35.192
The circulatory system, which circulates
nourishment and oxygen to the cells,

00:05:35.294 --> 00:05:38.809
outputs waste and CO2 from the cells,

00:05:38.963 --> 00:05:41.606
regulates temperature and transfer of horomones.

00:05:42.162 --> 00:05:44.680
The second system is the respiratory system,

00:05:44.761 --> 00:05:49.540
whose function is to exchange gases
between the system and the outside environment.

00:05:50.167 --> 00:05:52.956
The third system is the nervous system,

00:05:53.079 --> 00:05:57.921
whose function is to coordination control
and monitoring of the bodily systems.

00:05:58.545 --> 00:06:01.400
The fourth system is the digestive system.

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:07.942
Its function is to break down food into its basic forms and absorption into the body.

00:06:08.629 --> 00:06:11.105
The fifth system is the reproductive system.

00:06:11.229 --> 00:06:13.764
The sixth system is the musculoskeletal system.

00:06:14.103 --> 00:06:17.165
which is responsible for the body's movement

00:06:17.323 --> 00:06:22.246
The urinary sytem secretes waste and excess salts out of the body

00:06:22.515 --> 00:06:26.581
The three major systems in the
body are the nervous,

00:06:26.629 --> 00:06:28.600
respiratory, and circulatory.

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:32.668
These 3 make up the "triangle of life".
(life support system)

00:06:32.774 --> 00:06:37.670
Oxygen, comes from the outside
through the respiratory system,

00:06:37.786 --> 00:06:41.531
which carries the oxygen through
the circulatory system.

00:06:41.882 --> 00:06:45.301
The circulatory system carries the oxygen to the body's cells

00:06:45.746 --> 00:06:48.093
and takes CO2 from the cells.

00:06:48.362 --> 00:06:52.092
The circulatory system also carries the
oxygen to the nervous system,

00:06:52.458 --> 00:06:56.311
which acts as a controller of all the other systems.

00:06:56.734 --> 00:07:00.339
The nervours system releases CO2

00:07:00.339 --> 00:07:03.040
like all bodily cells, to the circulatory system,

00:07:03.251 --> 00:07:07.119
Which carries the CO2 tot he respiratory system,

00:07:07.167 --> 00:07:11.809
which then takes the CO2
to the outside environment.

00:07:12.188 --> 00:07:14.972
This was the Anatomy Structure Basics lesson.

00:07:14.982 --> 00:07:17.252
See you in the next lesson!
