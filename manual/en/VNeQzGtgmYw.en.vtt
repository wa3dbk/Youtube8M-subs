Hi, I’m Janae Devika and welcome to Café Janae.

00:00:18.317 --> 00:00:21.023
We’re going to learn about how to get a lot of protein without

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:24.581
eating meat and how to get lots of antioxidants.

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:29.707
Lot of people they think salad, just has to be lettuce,

00:00:30.022 --> 00:00:32.601
cucumber,ranch dressing and that’s it.

00:00:32.911 --> 00:00:35.225
Were going to show you how to make an awesome salad

00:00:35.661 --> 00:00:36.600
that’s totally different,

00:00:37.035 --> 00:00:41.535
its going to be filling, satisfying and full of all the protein that you need,

00:00:41.851 --> 00:00:45.175
so you don’t even need meat. We’re going to learn fiesta in a bowl,

00:00:45.989 --> 00:00:47.053
an awesome bean salad.

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:49.567
Now,this is an awesome recipe

00:00:49.817 --> 00:00:51.381
because a lot of people when they’re switching

00:00:51.647 --> 00:00:55.083
over to a healthier diet they are worried that if they are not eating meat

00:00:55.536 --> 00:00:57.661
and animal products that they are not getting enough protein.

00:00:58.222 --> 00:01:02.613
Well this dish is packed with protein, lots of vitamins, lots of minerals,

00:01:03.176 --> 00:01:06.882
your essential oils, you’ve got everything you need in one bowl

00:01:06.882 --> 00:01:09.693
and its filling and satisfying and it’s beautiful

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:13.535
so it’s got all the components of fabulous healthy whole foods meal,

00:01:14.302 --> 00:01:15.301
all in one shot.

00:01:15.801 --> 00:01:21.380
So, first of all were going to take beans, we’ve got butter beans here,

00:01:21.879 --> 00:01:23.128
these are fun because they’re huge

00:01:23.503 --> 00:01:25.644
and people don’t normally expect to see

00:01:25.644 --> 00:01:31.475
gigantic beans, these are navy beans and this is 1 can of each.

00:01:32.473 --> 00:01:34.849
It’s important to take the cans of beans and rinse and drain them well.

00:01:34.849 --> 00:01:38.458
They contain lot of extra salt in the cans of beans,

00:01:38.768 --> 00:01:42.362
so rinse and drain them and gets rid all the extra salt.

00:01:43.176 --> 00:01:46.862
So the black beans, kidney beans, navy beans and butter beans,

00:01:46.862 --> 00:01:48.361
one can of each rinsed and drained,

00:01:49.051 --> 00:01:51.928
to that were going to add 2 tomatoes -chopped up,

00:01:55.255 --> 00:01:58.972
1 red pepper actually it’s the half of red pepper

00:01:59.285 --> 00:02:02.910
and a half of the yellow pepper and half of the orange pepper.

00:02:02.910 --> 00:02:05.099
Now, if you don’t have all the different colors of peppers

00:02:05.598 --> 00:02:07.283
then don’t worry about it just use what you have,

00:02:07.846 --> 00:02:10.625
it’s just really pretty when you get all those colors in there.

00:02:11.113 --> 00:02:14.909
And then we have 1 bunch of green unions chopped up.

00:02:17.052 --> 00:02:19.002
All right lets just get mixed up

00:02:19.002 --> 00:02:21.941
and the color is like we’ve got party in a bowl,

00:02:22.379 --> 00:02:23.502
looks like a fiesta right there.

00:02:23.814 --> 00:02:27.066
All your beautiful colors, the beans make it filling that,

00:02:27.502 --> 00:02:34.502
the pepper makes it really healthy and you’ve got tons of protein in there.

00:02:34.502 --> 00:02:37.352
So, after that we need to make the sauce.

00:02:37.847 --> 00:02:39.847
Now, the sauce is simple, its 3 ingredients,

00:02:39.847 --> 00:02:44.533
well 4 ingredients and they’re all very important.

00:02:44.533 --> 00:02:47.176
So we have olive oil, that’s going to give you healthy fats,

00:02:47.176 --> 00:02:52.814
we’ve got ½ cup olive oil and then 1/2 cup of apple cider vinegar.

00:02:56.609 --> 00:02:59.296
Now, make sure when you’re buying your Apple Cider Vinegar

00:02:59.296 --> 00:03:01.986
you don’t want to just go buy the cheapest apple cider vinegar

00:03:01.986 --> 00:03:02.796
in the grocery store.

00:03:03.235 --> 00:03:07.049
Apple Cider Vinegar can be super good for you if you buy the right kind.

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:08.924
I go with Braggs brand.

00:03:09.235 --> 00:03:11.735
Braggs Apple Cider Vinegar is raw, unpasteurized,

00:03:12.108 --> 00:03:14.609
untreated and it still has the mother in it.

00:03:14.983 --> 00:03:18.484
The mother is like the, you can see a kind a bit bottom layer at the bottom

00:03:18.985 --> 00:03:23.111
and it’s what helps the vinegar to culture

00:03:23.111 --> 00:03:25.930
and to build up its healthy properties.

00:03:27.984 --> 00:03:29.984
And then we have ½ cup of honey.

00:03:33.924 --> 00:03:36.482
When you pick a honey make sure its local, make sure its raw

00:03:36.797 --> 00:03:39.109
make sure its been treated at the temperature less than

00:03:39.109 --> 00:03:40.357
a hundred and five degrees

00:03:40.983 --> 00:03:45.983
and make sure that the bee keepers feed the bees their own honeys

00:03:45.983 --> 00:03:48.483
during the winter not corn syrup or sugar water.

00:03:52.477 --> 00:03:57.415
Alright, now you could just take all this things and mix by hand,

00:03:57.666 --> 00:04:02.165
but they separate.

00:04:02.165 --> 00:04:06.417
So I add like a tsp of salt and then blend it.

00:04:06.417 --> 00:04:08.478
The salt will help homogenize the sauce,

00:04:08.855 --> 00:04:11.664
so it just kind a creamy and it doesn’t separate later.

00:04:13.853 --> 00:04:16.226
Alright, let’s blend away…

00:04:30.083 --> 00:04:30.584
Done!

00:04:31.084 --> 00:04:35.084
Alright, now its time to add the sauce to the party in a bowl.

00:04:35.646 --> 00:04:36.584
This is going to be awesome.

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:47.646
Now with this salad is you can eat it straight away like you see,

00:04:47.959 --> 00:04:49.395
its really, really a quick meal,

00:04:49.395 --> 00:04:54.270
you can make in you know 10 minutes or 15 minutes at the most,

00:04:54.898 --> 00:04:58.708
super quick, eat right away  or you can leave it in the fridge

00:04:58.708 --> 00:04:59.644
and let it marinate.

00:04:59.644 --> 00:05:02.833
Actually it tastes better the next day or 2 days after

00:05:02.833 --> 00:05:04.711
because all the sauce soaks into the beans

00:05:04.711 --> 00:05:06.208
and makes them a lot more flavorful.

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:08.582
So, I recommend making in a day ahead,

00:05:08.833 --> 00:05:12.647
let it marinate for a while and then eat it the next day.

00:05:15.710 --> 00:05:18.832
You can just eat it like this if you want as a side dish

00:05:18.832 --> 00:05:20.772
or you can make it into a meal

00:05:21.083 --> 00:05:25.519
by adding into some green leafy vegetables like spinach or spring greens,

00:05:26.644 --> 00:05:28.960
just put it on top and the sauce will seep down

00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:31.208
for a really amazing salad dressing

00:05:31.208 --> 00:05:35.083
for the greens and then the beans will really fill you up.

00:05:35.519 --> 00:05:39.332
Now, once again just like a, all the other recipes,

00:05:39.583 --> 00:05:41.459
presentation is everything.

00:05:42.018 --> 00:05:46.459
So, that looks beautiful, and it is totally appetizing.

00:05:46.459 --> 00:05:48.895
I’m going to give it a little bit of fresh ground pepper.

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:58.770
A little side note about pepper - If you eat raw pepper just freshly ground,

00:05:59.144 --> 00:06:02.193
it’s very good for your digestion

00:06:03.003 --> 00:06:05.316
and it actually helps heal your stomach lining,

00:06:05.316 --> 00:06:08.441
if you have ulcers or other problems with your stomach.

00:06:09.815 --> 00:06:12.003
However if you cook pepper or heat it up

00:06:12.003 --> 00:06:15.813
(black pepper, cayenne pepper,  or any kind a pepper)

00:06:16.629 --> 00:06:20.191
once you cook it, it actually damages your stomach its because acidic

00:06:20.503 --> 00:06:23.375
and it hurts your stomach instead of helping it.

00:06:23.627 --> 00:06:24.878
So, anytime you used peppers

00:06:25.191 --> 00:06:29.125
make sure you put it on after you’re done making your meal,

00:06:29.376 --> 00:06:30.501
after you’re done cooking your meal.

00:06:31.443 --> 00:06:32.440
And then just top it off,

00:06:33.942 --> 00:06:35.691
we’re going to do few red peppers on top

00:06:35.939 --> 00:06:37.940
just for a little added presentation

00:06:38.442 --> 00:06:42.875
and a little bit of parsley and there we have it, party in a bowl.

00:06:42.875 --> 00:06:43.627
Enjoy….

00:06:44.253 --> 00:06:45.441
