Hi, my name is Josh reporting to you live
from LCI Paper and today I’m going to talk

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:13.250
about these Gelly Roll Metallic pens. Now
they work on matte and metallic finishes,

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:19.499
of course paper and card stock. And what’s
nice about these pens is that they are a roller

00:00:19.499 --> 00:00:26.169
ball pen so they just make writing effortless.
Your pen hand is just going to glide along

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:32.310
the paper and it will be easier to write actually.
Now these come in 14 different colors. They

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:40.820
do have a reflective finish and what I’ll
do is sample some of the colors for you so

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:47.430
you can see really how they look on both light
and dark metallic finish papers and matte

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.610
finish papers and you’re going to see that
different colors look different on different

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:58.650
surfaces. So let’s get to the testing, if
you’ll swing around mister cameraman.

00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:04.000
The first paper example I’d like to use
is a metallic black card and the first color

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:16.499
sample is Emerald Green which seems to really
show up nicely on the metallic black paper.

00:01:16.499 --> 00:01:25.380
Next, let’s try Silver.
Both of those look pretty nice I think. I

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:35.499
hope you’re able to see that. Let’s try
one more. This is Gold. And you can see because

00:01:35.499 --> 00:01:41.229
I’m left handed, I’m dangerously close
to my hand dragging over my ink which would

00:01:41.229 --> 00:01:46.710
not be good as these inks do take quite a
while to dry. Right handed people might have

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:48.959
it a little easier, I’m not sure.

00:01:48.959 --> 00:01:55.219
Now let’s change the card to a white metallic
card stock. I’ve got a little stack of cards

00:01:55.219 --> 00:02:08.140
here. Let’s try some of the same colors.
Here’s that Emerald Green. Here’s Silver.

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:16.989
That Purple doesn’t look bad. Let me try
it once more. I think when I hold the pen

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:21.810
at more of a 90 degree angle it works better
than if I’ve really got it angled down at

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.019
a 45 like this. It seems to be more saturated.

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:39.150
This is a black matte finish. Let’s go with
the same colors. Here’s Emerald Green.

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:45.519
Silver looks really nice. Again, I’m seeing
a lot of silver in this sample and I’m not

00:02:45.519 --> 00:02:51.989
sure that you can pick this up from the different
angles but at certain angles I see more purple

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:57.870
and at certain angles I see more silver. So
you can see you’ve really got to test the

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:03.290
colors on different stocks that you’re working
with and see which one really works best.

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:08.349
Here’s Gold. This looks very nice as it
really should on black.

00:03:08.349 --> 00:03:16.730
And now we’re going to grab a stack of matte
finish white cards. And how’s the Emerald

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:21.689
Green going to look? It’s nice. Of course
you’re going to have to get a lot closer

00:03:21.689 --> 00:03:31.659
and maybe I can edit some close-up shots later
so you can really see the metallic pearlescent

00:03:31.659 --> 00:03:47.430
finish of this ink. Purple looks very nice.
Let’s try Black.

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:52.930
So now that you’ve seen different writing
examples from our Metallic Gelly Roll pens,

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:57.109
I hope you’re interested in them. Remember
though, we have quite a few other lines of

00:03:57.109 --> 00:04:02.220
Gelly Roll pens and you can see those in other
videos. If you have any questions about these

00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:07.599
Metallic pens though, post a comment. You
can even give us a call, send an e-mail, we’ll

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:10.040
be happy to help you. Signing off!
