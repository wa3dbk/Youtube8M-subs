00:00:03.182 --> 00:00:14.544
Yeah, yeah, oh, whoa
 Sorry, sorry, love
 Sorry, sorry, 
 love
 Sorry, sorry, love, love, love, love

00:00:14.544 --> 00:00:22.837
Sorry, sorry, love, love, love, love

00:00:22.837 --> 00:00:29.604
Wait, I know we hit it off on a good 
 note
 But now you're gettin' a little too comfortable

00:00:29.604 --> 00:00:34.447
Now let me put you on the game
 (I give love a bad name)

00:00:34.447 --> 00:00:41.337
Wait, before you go and pull off the handcuffs
 I'm 
 not your prisoner, don't try to lock me up

00:00:41.337 --> 00:00:45.827
That'll be your worst mistake
 (The biggest you'll ever make)

00:00:45.827 --> 00:00:55.575
Sometimes what you want, it ain't what you get
 I say I want love, and 
 I take it back
 I guess I just don't know how to act

00:00:55.575 --> 00:00:57.330
I'm so-o-o-rry

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:07.925
Sometimes what you give, it ain't what you get
 'Cause I gave my heart and 
 I ain't seen it back
 Now revenge is running through my veins, yeah

00:01:07.925 --> 00:01:18.159
Better unlock the chains
 Or else, baby, I'm a break away
 I'm 
 sorry but I can't change it,
 I was born this way

00:01:18.159 --> 00:01:31.415
Caught me cold blooded
 Put the blame on me
 Charge me to the first degree
 
 Sorry but a love gene's missing in my DNA
 Caught me cold blooded

00:01:31.415 --> 00:01:34.289
Yeah, ye-yeah, yeah, yeah caught me cold blooded

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:46.180
Stop, you're gonna make me put up a roadblock
 Taking the life of me down to the 
 last drop
 You gotta give me room to breathe
 Or I will become the enemy

00:01:46.179 --> 00:01:57.610
Boy your girl's gotta do what you gotta do
 So if you let me keep it 
 moving we'll keep it cool
 Don't try to change me babe
 That'll push me away

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:08.650
Sometimes what you want, it ain't what you get
 I say I want love, and I 
 take it back
 I guess I just don't know how to act
 I'm so-o-o-rry

00:02:08.651 --> 00:02:19.500
Sometimes what you give, it ain't what you get
 'Cause I gave my heart 
 and I ain't seen it back
 Now revenge is running through my veins

00:02:19.505 --> 00:02:31.370
Better unlock the chains
 Or else, baby, I'm a break away
 I'm sorry but 
 I can't change it
 I was born this way
 Caught me cold blooded

00:02:31.368 --> 00:02:42.960
Put the blame on me
 Charge me to the first degree
 Sorry 
 but a love gene's missing in my DNA
Caught me cold blooded

00:02:42.955 --> 00:02:52.210
Yeah, ye-yeah, yeah, yeah caught me cold blooded
 Yeah, 
 ye-yeah, yeah, yeah caught me cold blooded

00:02:52.207 --> 00:03:07.860
Hear me out
 Know you think I'm a monster
 But my heart's been locked 
 up
 Wanna keep me here;
You gotta let me come up for air, yeah

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:18.690
Let me come up for air
 Can't be what you want 
 me to be
 'Cause my love's just cold blooded

00:03:18.686 --> 00:03:29.970
Better unlock the chains
 Or else, baby, I'm a break away
 I'm sorry but I 
 can't (yeah) change it,
 I was born this way
 Caught me cold blooded

00:03:29.971 --> 00:03:41.630
Put the blame on me (ohhhhhhhhhh)
 Charge me to the first degree
 Sorry 
 but a love gene's missing in my DNA
 Caught me cold blooded

00:03:41.632 --> 00:03:49.860
Yeah, ye-yeah, yeah, yeah caught me cold blooded [echo]
