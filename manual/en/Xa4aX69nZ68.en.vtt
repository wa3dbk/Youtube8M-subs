00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:06.807
Hey, it's Mike from Swisco.com, and today I'm going 
 to show you how to replace your

00:00:06.807 --> 00:00:09.381
storm window latches and corners. 

00:00:10.077 --> 00:00:15.279
For this exercise you will need a rubber 
 mallet, a large flathead screwdriver, a hammer

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.434
a wood block, a vice, and safety glasses.

00:00:20.991 --> 00:00:27.725
In this demonstration, I'll be working with the 
 Swisco 91-001 and 91-002 storm window latches.

00:00:28.166 --> 00:00:33.300
And the 95-003 and 95-005 Storm Window Corners.

00:00:34.368 --> 00:00:37.571
To get started, lay your storm window on a flat surface.

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.678
Use your wood block and hammer to disengage the frame, detaching it from

00:00:44.025 --> 00:00:44.912
the glass and spline.

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:54.010
It's only necessary to disengage the frame in 
 two places, as you will be able

00:00:54.388 --> 00:00:56.223
to separate all four in the vice.

00:01:06.733 --> 00:01:09.870
Once you've removed the frame, secure it in the vice

00:01:10.437 --> 00:01:15.509
and place your large flathead screwdriver in the slot 
 of the frame up against the corner keys

00:01:15.976 --> 00:01:18.553
and use your hammer to punch out the corner keys.

00:01:36.084 --> 00:01:41.840
To remove the spring loaded latches, take a pointed 
 object and press down on the spring

00:01:42.302 --> 00:01:45.460
retainer to release the latches from the frame.

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:54.310
To install the new latches, take your spring retainer and 
 put it into the groove of the latch

00:01:56.016 --> 00:01:57.750
and slide it into the frame until it locks in place.

00:02:21.675 --> 00:02:27.180
After you've installed your new latches, use a hammer 
 to gently tap in your new corner keys.

00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:51.150
Once all of your latches and corner keys have been installed, 

00:02:51.638 --> 00:02:54.270
take the two sides of the frame that do not contain corner keys,

00:02:55.055 --> 00:02:58.030
and secure them to the glass using your rubber mallet.

00:03:18.965 --> 00:03:23.130
To finish the project, use your mallet to tap 
 the remaining pieces of the frame together

00:03:23.203 --> 00:03:27.590
at the corners, making sure the frame is secure on all sides.

00:03:50.063 --> 00:03:52.010
As always, thank you for watching this tutorial.
