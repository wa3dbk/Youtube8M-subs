00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:02.040
hi everyone 

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:03.720
today we will make rice pudding in the oven

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:04.540
the ingredients are

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:05.946
1/2 litre of milk

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:07.980
1/2 cup of sugar

00:00:08.153 --> 00:00:10.153
1/2 tea cup of rice

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:12.280
1 table spoon of wheat starch

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:14.520
1 egg yolk

00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:15.840
vanilla extract

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:18.680
I had prepared my own vanilla extract

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:19.800
I will be using this

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.560
If you don't have vanilla extract

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:25.280
you can always use vanilla powder we use for cakes

00:00:26.020 --> 00:00:28.180
we begin by cooking the rice

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.160
we washed the rice

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.480
we put the rice in a small pot

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.440
we add water, just enough to fully soak the rice

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:41.080
we turn on the heat

00:00:41.653 --> 00:00:43.653
and wait for the rice to cook and swell

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:49.320
I spare some of the milk to dissolve the starch 

00:00:51.324 --> 00:00:53.324
this is more than enough

00:00:53.324 --> 00:00:54.755
and now we heat the milk

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:04.060
the milk is now hot and we add sugar in it

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:09.120
I add the rice as well

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:20.940
now I add my vanilla extract

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:25.620
two tablespoons of vanilla extract is enough

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:27.100
if you're using vanilla powder

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:28.740
one small pack will be enough

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:31.440
we will add starch after the sugar has melted 

00:01:31.774 --> 00:01:33.774
now let's prepare our starch

00:01:34.036 --> 00:01:36.036
to 1 tablespoon of wheat starch

00:01:36.036 --> 00:01:37.815
we add the milk we spared

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:41.860
and dissolve the starch in milk

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:48.540
I will add the egg yolk into this mixture

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.340
and whisk it really well

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.180
it is very important that starch is completely dissolved

00:01:57.180 --> 00:01:59.720
otherwise lumps may remain in your pudding 

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.620
mine has dissolved, now we'll add this to the milk

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:11.500
sugar has melted, milk is heated

00:02:12.205 --> 00:02:14.205
while adding the mixture

00:02:14.205 --> 00:02:16.193
we must continue stirring the milk

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:19.320
to prevent the egg cooking and starch getting lumpy

00:02:21.354 --> 00:02:23.354
we will add slowly

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.160
starch and egg will densify the milk

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.180
we don't want it to become as thick as custard

00:02:31.396 --> 00:02:33.396
because it will continue cooking in the oven

00:02:33.580 --> 00:02:35.580
we will put this in pots after it densifies a little more

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.840
now that our rice pudding has densified

00:02:43.980 --> 00:02:45.980
I have chosen these as my oven pots

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:48.540
you can also cook it all in one big pot

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:50.280
I like it more in portions

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.520
as you can see the consistency is

00:02:52.700 --> 00:02:54.700
thinner than custard (like "boza")

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:56.620
now we can distribute into portions

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:07.180
we filled our pots

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.900
we smeared some on the edges of the pots

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.635
do remember to clean them

00:03:11.635 --> 00:03:14.255
they burn in the oven and look bad

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:17.080
pre-heated the oven to 180 C degrees (356 F)  

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:19.300
only the top heater is on

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:21.620
I put rice pudding pots into the oven

00:03:24.880 --> 00:03:26.880
I heated some water before hand

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.653
pour hot water in the oven tray 

00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:31.740
couple of centimetres deep

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:34.660
they will cook until the surface changes color
