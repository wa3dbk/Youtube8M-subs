00:00:01.843 --> 00:00:03.203
[singing] the hills

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:05.980
are alive

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:08.670
with the smell of

00:00:10.552 --> 00:00:12.552
Wachauer Marillen Knodel...

00:00:13.166 --> 00:00:15.486
Apricot Dumplings! [end singing]

00:00:18.515 --> 00:00:19.235
Oh, hello.

00:00:19.235 --> 00:00:21.142
Welcome to my von Trapp household.

00:00:21.142 --> 00:00:22.658
What's that Tastemade?

00:00:23.311 --> 00:00:26.831
You want to do a Spotlight Series on the Sound of Music

00:00:26.831 --> 00:00:29.082
with a bunch of other great channels to check out with

00:00:29.082 --> 00:00:30.977
traditional Austrian recipes?

00:00:31.401 --> 00:00:32.601
Oh, well silly me!

00:00:32.601 --> 00:00:34.841
I'm already dressed in my von Trapp gear,

00:00:35.278 --> 00:00:36.718
with my von Trapp cat,

00:00:36.718 --> 00:00:39.465
and I think we should make some Apricot Dumplings.

00:00:40.561 --> 00:00:41.761
...gluten-free.

00:00:42.646 --> 00:00:43.446
[laughing]

00:00:44.771 --> 00:00:47.811
So now it's demystified: von Trapps all sing.

00:00:49.227 --> 00:00:50.267
and... we cook!

00:00:50.267 --> 00:00:53.007
[singing] You're going to need fresh apricots

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.110
or some preserves

00:00:55.911 --> 00:00:58.151
fresh goat's cheese, not aged...

00:00:59.431 --> 00:01:01.351
brown rice flour and mochiko

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:04.139
which is also a cream of rice flour

00:01:04.139 --> 00:01:06.512
...that's been cooked and you can use as a substitute...

00:01:07.495 --> 00:01:10.215
You're gonna need coconut oil or butter,

00:01:12.274 --> 00:01:13.634
xylitol or sugar...

00:01:14.531 --> 00:01:15.651
an egg, and salt,

00:01:15.651 --> 00:01:17.585
and gluten-free bread crumbs, but if

00:01:17.585 --> 00:01:22.056
you don't have them you can just toast some flour, and I recommend coconut flour... [end singing]

00:01:22.056 --> 00:01:27.050
and for some seasoning I always like vanilla, and cinnamon tastes really good on these.

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:30.340
So, to start out with your apricot dumplings

00:01:30.493 --> 00:01:34.333
You're going to melt 1/4 cup coconut oil over a bain mairie

00:01:34.861 --> 00:01:39.261
Then, you're gonna mix it together with your fresh goat's cheese.

00:01:39.931 --> 00:01:44.411
...which is easier for people with lactose intolerances to digest

00:01:46.826 --> 00:01:48.026
...and your eggs.

00:01:52.283 --> 00:01:54.923
Add in two teaspoons of xylitol or sugar

00:01:56.381 --> 00:02:00.141
Set that aside.  Quickly mix together both of your flours

00:02:03.504 --> 00:02:04.864
and a dash of sea salt

00:02:07.144 --> 00:02:10.584
...and I always like adding vanilla to my desserts.

00:02:14.267 --> 00:02:16.907
Add your dry ingredients into your wet.

00:02:19.483 --> 00:02:20.043
Lovely!

00:02:20.043 --> 00:02:24.166
Now you're gonna let this rest up, covered with a towel, for about 30 minutes

00:02:24.166 --> 00:02:25.325
while you prepare your filling.

00:02:25.561 --> 00:02:30.201
So I had a pretty fun time trying to find apricots for the filling today

00:02:31.079 --> 00:02:32.999
considering it's... April.

00:02:32.999 --> 00:02:36.128
and so you have two options for what you can use for your filling.

00:02:36.263 --> 00:02:38.983
one if fresh apricots; you can halve them

00:02:39.526 --> 00:02:41.606
and stuff them with a sugar cube

00:02:41.738 --> 00:02:44.938
and the other option is to use apricot preserves

00:02:44.938 --> 00:02:46.976
I've mixed them with some agar agar

00:02:46.976 --> 00:02:48.248
brought it up to a boil

00:02:48.664 --> 00:02:50.664
put them in some cake pop molds

00:02:51.336 --> 00:02:53.416
and you've got something solid

00:02:55.485 --> 00:02:57.245
to fill your dumpling with

00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.760
Once your dough has rested

00:03:00.406 --> 00:03:02.806
you're ready to make some dumplings

00:03:03.325 --> 00:03:04.685
So you're gonna take

00:03:04.787 --> 00:03:05.827
about a handful

00:03:06.929 --> 00:03:07.489
of dough

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:11.950
put either your whole apricot that's stuffed with sugar

00:03:14.556 --> 00:03:16.476
or your little agar agar ball

00:03:16.937 --> 00:03:18.617
in the middle of the dough

00:03:20.197 --> 00:03:21.077
and wrap it up

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:24.010
like so!

00:03:25.145 --> 00:03:28.425
This is so cool lookin'... and it smells awesome.

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:31.740
Alright!

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:34.356
Now we're going to cook these like ravioli.

00:03:36.316 --> 00:03:38.636
Bring some salted water up to a boil

00:03:38.709 --> 00:03:41.189
then bring it back down to a simmer...

00:03:43.762 --> 00:03:46.562
and you're going to drop your dumplings in

00:03:49.823 --> 00:03:50.543
one by one.

00:03:51.849 --> 00:03:56.729
and cook them for about 10-15 minutes, until the dough is cooked through.

00:03:57.623 --> 00:04:01.623
You're gonna melt either some butter or coconut oil in a bowl

00:04:03.176 --> 00:04:05.256
Roll your little dumpling in it

00:04:05.296 --> 00:04:10.176
Then, for a nice coating, roll it in either your gluten-free bread crumbs

00:04:11.138 --> 00:04:13.138
or your toasted coconut flour

00:04:13.825 --> 00:04:16.625
We toast the flour to make it easy to digest

00:04:17.689 --> 00:04:19.449
and to give it a good taste.

00:04:21.771 --> 00:04:23.291
Then, put it on a plate.

00:04:24.004 --> 00:04:27.044
Sprinkle it with either some sugar or xylitol

00:04:29.204 --> 00:04:31.684
and a little bit of cinnamon to serve!

00:04:33.816 --> 00:04:37.016
So, let's see how the Austrians do dumplings...

00:04:38.056 --> 00:04:38.936
I'm curious.

00:04:40.384 --> 00:04:41.504
Aw, it's pretty!

00:04:41.504 --> 00:04:43.774
That's kinda cool!  Alright, let's see.

00:04:44.905 --> 00:04:48.985
Mm!  The apricot is really really good with the goat's cheese.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.080
I don't even know how to say it, but it tastes pretty Austrian.

00:04:54.577 --> 00:04:57.777
And if you wanna check out other Austrian dishes
