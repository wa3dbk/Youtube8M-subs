00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:08.879
In New York City, people are the blood
and the transit system are really the arteries

00:00:08.879 --> 00:00:11.579
that carries people around.

00:00:11.579 --> 00:00:16.129
I'm Scott Kolber, chief operating officer
at Roadify.

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:20.260
What we're doing at Roadify, is just making
it easier for people to use this 

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:22.659
terrific mass transit system.

00:00:22.659 --> 00:00:26.070
The best mass transit system in the world really.

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.390
Roadify is a data platform and

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:30.410
a mobile application.

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:34.510
We make it easy for folks to find out
when their ride is coming

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:40.640
on any kind of mass transit. Subway, bus, tram, ferry,

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:42.440
suburban rail.

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:44.990
All you have to do is open the app

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:46.980
and in one screen and one tap

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:50.190
you're actually able to get all the
information that you about your 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.260
mass transit ride.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.830
Well the BigApps competition was
really a big deal for us.

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:02.290
NYC BigApps is a software competition sponsored by NYCEDC.

00:01:02.290 --> 00:01:06.090
It's a challenge to software developers,
asking them to build apps

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:11.200
using data from the city in order to
improve New York.

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:15.840
It helped us in several ways, first of
all it really validated what we were doing.

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.390
Second it gave us a great deal of
visability throughout the city,

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:21.370
and third, actually helped us raise some

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:22.900
angel funding.

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:25.390
That allowed us to continue our growth

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:28.520
and develop new features in our
application

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:31.970
that we were able to introduce following
that win.

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:35.970
And then you have the New York City Economic
Development Corporation, that 

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.880
really gets it. They really understand what
entrepreneurs need and they're particularly

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.860
focused on our sector of technology and development.

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:47.870
So it's just great to feel apart of that
community

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:50.920
at that level of enthusiasm and support

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:56.640
both from government and from other
parts of the private sector.

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.130
What you need to start a business

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.660
is talent and ideas and access to
markets,

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:09.269
and that is available here in New York
City in abundance.

00:02:09.269 --> 00:02:13.739
I'm Scott Kolber, I'm chief operating officer
at Roadify.

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:15.619
and I made it here in New York City.
