00:00:06.838 --> 00:00:08.848
How old is the Earth?

00:00:08.848 --> 00:00:10.866
Well, by counting the number of isotopes

00:00:10.866 --> 00:00:12.212
in a sample of rock

00:00:12.212 --> 00:00:14.320
that's undergone radioactive decay,

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:16.543
geologists have estimated the Earth's birthday,

00:00:16.543 --> 00:00:18.873
when it first formed from a solar nebula,

00:00:18.873 --> 00:00:21.902
to be 4.6 billion years ago.

00:00:21.902 --> 00:00:24.209
But just how long is that really?

00:00:24.209 --> 00:00:25.289
Here's some analogies

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.261
that might help you understand.

00:00:27.261 --> 00:00:30.534
For example, let's imagine the entire history of Earth

00:00:30.534 --> 00:00:31.876
until the present day

00:00:31.876 --> 00:00:33.919
as a single calendar year.

00:00:33.919 --> 00:00:37.124
On January 1st, the Earth begins to form.

00:00:37.124 --> 00:00:39.459
By March 3rd, there's the first evidence

00:00:39.459 --> 00:00:41.286
of single-celled bacteria.

00:00:41.286 --> 00:00:44.850
Life remains amazingly unicellular until November 11th

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.315
when the first multicellular organisms,

00:00:47.315 --> 00:00:50.146
known as the Ediacaran fauna, come along.

00:00:50.146 --> 00:00:54.121
Shortly thereafter, on November 16th at 6:08 p.m.

00:00:54.121 --> 00:00:56.409
is the Cambrian Explosion of life,

00:00:56.409 --> 00:00:57.576
a major milestone,

00:00:57.576 --> 00:01:00.674
when all of the modern phyla started to appear.

00:01:01.412 --> 00:01:03.873
On December 10th at 1:26 p.m.,

00:01:03.873 --> 00:01:05.712
the dinosaurs first evolve

00:01:05.712 --> 00:01:07.293
but are wiped out by an asteroid

00:01:07.293 --> 00:01:09.290
just two weeks later.

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:11.794
On December 31st, the mighty Roman empire

00:01:11.794 --> 00:01:14.952
rises and falls in just under four seconds.

00:01:14.952 --> 00:01:16.037
And Columbus sets sail

00:01:16.037 --> 00:01:17.504
for what he thinks is India

00:01:17.504 --> 00:01:19.378
at three seconds to midnight.

00:01:20.116 --> 00:01:22.071
If you try to write the history of the Earth

00:01:22.071 --> 00:01:24.159
using just one page per year,

00:01:24.159 --> 00:01:27.075
your book would be 145 miles thick,

00:01:27.075 --> 00:01:28.445
more than half the distance

00:01:28.445 --> 00:01:30.817
to the international space station.

00:01:30.817 --> 00:01:33.005
The story of the 3.2 million year-old

00:01:33.005 --> 00:01:35.701
Australopithecine fossil known as Lucy

00:01:35.701 --> 00:01:38.371
would be found on the 144th mile,

00:01:38.371 --> 00:01:41.294
just over 500 feet from the end of the book.

00:01:42.062 --> 00:01:44.872
The United States of America's Declaration of Independence

00:01:44.872 --> 00:01:47.295
would be signed in the last half-inch.

00:01:47.295 --> 00:01:49.326
Or if we compared geologic time

00:01:49.326 --> 00:01:50.749
to a woman stretching her arms

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:52.407
to a span of six feet,

00:01:52.407 --> 00:01:54.331
the simple act of filing her nails

00:01:54.331 --> 00:01:57.466
would wipe away all of recorded human history.

00:01:57.466 --> 00:02:00.699
Finally, let's imagine the history of the Earth as your life:

00:02:00.699 --> 00:02:01.926
from the moment you're born

00:02:01.926 --> 00:02:03.890
to your first day of high school.

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:05.069
Your first word,

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:06.190
first time sitting up,

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:07.652
and first time walking

00:02:07.652 --> 00:02:09.694
would all take place while life on Earth

00:02:09.694 --> 00:02:12.760
was comprised of single-celled organisms.

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.248
In fact, the first multicellular organism

00:02:15.248 --> 00:02:17.156
wouldn't evolve until you were 12 years old

00:02:17.156 --> 00:02:18.691
and starting 7th grade,

00:02:18.691 --> 00:02:19.584
right around the time

00:02:19.584 --> 00:02:21.276
your science teacher is telling the class

00:02:21.276 --> 00:02:23.385
how fossils are formed.

00:02:23.385 --> 00:02:24.579
The dinosaurs don't appear

00:02:24.579 --> 00:02:26.526
until three months into 8th grade

00:02:26.526 --> 00:02:29.680
and are soon wiped out right around spring break.

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.594
Three days before 9th grade begins,

00:02:31.594 --> 00:02:33.171
when you realize summer is over

00:02:33.171 --> 00:02:34.877
and you need new school supplies,

00:02:34.877 --> 00:02:38.636
Lucy, the Australopithecine, is walking around Africa.

00:02:38.636 --> 00:02:39.855
As you finish breakfast

00:02:39.855 --> 00:02:41.698
and head outside to catch your bus

00:02:41.698 --> 00:02:43.676
44 minutes before school,

00:02:43.676 --> 00:02:46.927
the Neanderthals are going extinct throughout Europe.

00:02:47.819 --> 00:02:49.190
The most recent glacial period

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:50.856
ends as your bus drops you off

00:02:50.856 --> 00:02:52.822
16 minutes before class.

00:02:52.822 --> 00:02:55.788
Columbus sets sail 50 seconds before class

00:02:55.788 --> 00:02:58.705
as you're still trying to find the right classroom.

00:02:58.705 --> 00:03:00.552
The Declaration of Independence is signed

00:03:00.552 --> 00:03:02.353
28 seconds later

00:03:02.353 --> 00:03:04.206
as you look for an empty seat.

00:03:04.206 --> 00:03:08.148
And you were born 1.3 seconds before the bell rings.

00:03:08.656 --> 00:03:10.807
So, you see, the Earth is extremely,

00:03:10.807 --> 00:03:12.130
unbelievably old

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:13.592
compared to us humans

00:03:13.592 --> 00:03:14.854
with a fossil record

00:03:14.854 --> 00:03:17.885
hiding incredible stories to tell us about the past

00:03:17.885 --> 00:03:19.958
and possibly the future as well.

00:03:19.958 --> 00:03:21.713
But in the short time we've been here,

00:03:21.713 --> 00:03:23.041
we've learned so much

00:03:23.041 --> 00:03:24.663
and will surely learn more

00:03:24.663 --> 00:03:26.563
over the next decades and centuries,

00:03:26.563 --> 00:03:29.187
near moments in geological time.
