00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:05.620
for this medieval rabbit recipe

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:06.529
you need a rabbit

00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:08.199
three onions, some lard

00:00:08.199 --> 00:00:11.309
Raisins or currants

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:15.139
Wine, red wine vinegar, sugar, pepper, cinamon

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:19.330
Ginger, salt, and breadcrumbs for thickening if you like

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:20.710
First off you gotta cut 

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:22.240
The rabbit So that 

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:23.659
It can be used

00:00:23.659 --> 00:00:26.579
I’ve taken out the kidneys and the liver

00:00:26.579 --> 00:00:30.669
and put them in a bowl, seperatley. You might want to use them,

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:33.700
They can be used as a thickener or put in something else

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:36.330
It doesn’t have to be used in this dish,

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:39.130
Probably better without it as it has a different flavour from the meat

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:43.300
and you can use breadcrumbs for thickening anyway

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:45.750
just separate the saddle

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.870
from the top half

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:50.410
There’s a joint in the spinal cord

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:51.570
You gotta find

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.090
You should be able to

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:54.970
Cut through it Much more

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:58.500
easily than I have if you have a better knife than this

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.710
That’s fine that’s one

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:05.110
Try and separate the spine

00:01:05.110 --> 00:01:07.610
From the part with the rib cage

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:10.610
The hind legs, the saddle and the

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:13.000
Fore-quarters

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.140
for the first part of this medieval recipe it says

00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:18.260
Take connynges or kydde

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.730
And smite hem on peccys rawe 

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:24.520
And frye hem in white grece

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:26.950
so connynges is rabbit

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:29.230
And white grece is lard

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:30.620
Or bacon fat

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:37.600
Or any kind of white fat basically, so as you can see that’s whats been done here.

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.430
The next part

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:42.320
Take raysouns of coraunce and fry hem

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.590
so the other thing I’m gonna fry is 

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:46.250
Raisins and currants

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:48.240
Basically some dried fruits

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.810
In a separate pan. Take oynouns

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:55.280
Perboil hem

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:58.030
And hewe hem small and fry hem.

00:01:58.030 --> 00:01:59.310
So the third thing they do,

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:00.950
unusual for modern cooking

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:03.560
Is to take the onion

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.580
And parboil it, get it a bit softer

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:08.919
Then cut up into small chunks and fry it

00:02:08.919 --> 00:02:12.809
along with the dried fruit

00:02:12.809 --> 00:02:16.099
Here you can see this rabbit browning off nicely, you’re not trying

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:18.109
To cook it, just brown it off. 

00:02:18.109 --> 00:02:23.840
Keep the fat as well, that’s all gonna go in the stew later.

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:26.039
You need a bottle of wine, I bought a very cheap 

00:02:26.039 --> 00:02:28.119
Supermarket type

00:02:28.119 --> 00:02:29.169
Because I’m

00:02:29.169 --> 00:02:32.509
More of an ale man really and its just for the cooking

00:02:32.509 --> 00:02:33.979
If you’re so inclined

00:02:33.979 --> 00:02:37.329
You can have a drink of this while you’re cooking.

00:02:37.329 --> 00:02:44.329
Same with the onions as with the rabbit. You’re not trying to cook them fully, you’re just half cooking them. 

00:02:45.289 --> 00:02:46.939
While this is cooking you should start to prepare

00:02:46.939 --> 00:02:49.419
you're 

00:02:49.419 --> 00:02:51.549
Flavoured spices

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:52.909
Take rede wine and a lytel vynegur

00:02:52.909 --> 00:02:57.420
Sugar, with powdour of peper, of ginger,

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:58.799
of canel,

00:02:58.799 --> 00:03:04.850
Of salt; and cast thereto, and lat it seeth with a gode quantite of white grese 

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:07.989
and serue it forth. What you got here

00:03:07.989 --> 00:03:09.169
is 

00:03:09.169 --> 00:03:10.539
some sugar

00:03:10.539 --> 00:03:12.119
some ginger

00:03:12.119 --> 00:03:14.569
uh... some ground cinnamon

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:15.849
And some pepper

00:03:15.849 --> 00:03:20.189
they wouldn’t have had fresh ginger in
england in medieval times but I do

00:03:20.189 --> 00:03:22.249
So I’m using fresh instead of ground

00:03:22.249 --> 00:03:25.310
here are the mixed currants and raisins and fruit

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:26.539
And so forth

00:03:26.539 --> 00:03:30.559
The parboiled onions should be chopped once they’re parboiled. 

00:03:30.559 --> 00:03:33.120
Basically

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:34.760
Here’s the lard and rabbit fat

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:38.959
That’s leftover. I’ve taken the rabbit out so I can 

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:40.749
fry the onions

00:03:40.749 --> 00:03:42.869
And the

00:03:42.869 --> 00:03:44.469
raisins in it

00:03:44.469 --> 00:03:48.419
uh... so if you have a bigger pan you can leave the rabbit in there

00:03:48.419 --> 00:03:52.629
To go with the fat and then put the raisin and the onions in with them, 

00:03:52.629 --> 00:03:53.650
Fry them abit

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:57.279
So while they’re browning you prepare the spices

00:03:57.279 --> 00:03:59.189
which should all go

00:03:59.189 --> 00:04:00.579
together

00:04:00.579 --> 00:04:01.869
in here

00:04:01.869 --> 00:04:03.819
In a mixing bowl

00:04:03.819 --> 00:04:05.239
Get in there

00:04:05.239 --> 00:04:06.859
and uh...

00:04:06.859 --> 00:04:09.050
You need a cup and a half of red wine

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:12.929
But I’m using white wine. doesn't really make a
difference 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:20.679
It says use red wine vinegar 

00:04:20.679 --> 00:04:22.970
I’m gonna use balsamic vinegar

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:24.389
you wanna have about

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:30.499
Half a cup, maybe less, balsamic is a lot stronger so I’m just gonna use a little bit

00:04:30.499 --> 00:04:35.320
Gonna put some more wine in there. Stir it up with those spices, its like a mulled wine

00:04:35.320 --> 00:04:36.860
A nice scent coming off it

00:04:36.860 --> 00:04:37.960
and uh...

00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:42.029
get on with the browning of the onions. In goes the fruit

00:04:42.029 --> 00:04:43.360
Into the fat

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:45.899
Always add more fat

00:04:45.899 --> 00:04:49.479
Plenty of fat is always good, because rabbit is a very lean meat

00:04:49.479 --> 00:04:50.219
They were brought

00:04:50.219 --> 00:04:52.169
To England by the Normans

00:04:54.050 --> 00:04:58.340
just for food, they have no other function. They’re not native to these islands. 

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:03.530
and they taste very good. They’re a good source of protein but not a good source of

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:04.599
Much else.

00:05:04.599 --> 00:05:08.700
All they need is a bit of grass so they’re good

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:09.690
For farming.

00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:12.009
Eventually they managed to break out

00:05:14.789 --> 00:05:20.270
They were quite timid animals at first. They didn’t do very well in the English countryside, there were a lot of predators in those days.

00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:22.199
but as the predators have thinned off (declined in numbers)

00:05:22.199 --> 00:05:26.059
Rabbits have become one of the most dominant species in England 

00:05:26.059 --> 00:05:28.020
And as they’ve become a less popular food, 

00:05:28.020 --> 00:05:30.459
It’s only done them a lot of favours.

00:05:30.459 --> 00:05:34.739
uh... so you can do the British countryside a favour by killing and eating 

00:05:34.739 --> 00:05:37.650
as many rabbits as you can because they don’t belong there

00:05:37.650 --> 00:05:42.489
and they’re delicious.

00:05:42.489 --> 00:05:44.610
So you can find out what your ancestors knew

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:47.120
Only too well.

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:49.039
Now you can um...

00:05:49.039 --> 00:05:52.639
put all the onions and the currants in with the rabbit

00:05:52.639 --> 00:05:57.380
As you can see I’ve separated the ribcage from the fore-legs. i'm probably gonna

00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:01.599
once its stewed a bit I can probably peel off some
of that meat and just take those ribs out because

00:06:01.599 --> 00:06:06.150
You don’t really want to serve that to anyone. It doesn’t look very good. 

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:27.619
so basically 

00:06:27.619 --> 00:06:31.349
that means put it all..these herbs and spices and

00:06:31.349 --> 00:06:32.879
The wine

00:06:32.879 --> 00:06:35.909
Over the fried onions, rabbit and

00:06:35.909 --> 00:06:37.870
dried fruit

00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:40.620
with a lot of white grease meaning lard

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:43.400
And let it seeth, meaning..uh

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:45.469
Just let it stew for awhile (45 mins-1hour)

00:06:46.839 --> 00:06:51.399
it should smell a little bit like mulled wine and a game stew mixed together.

00:06:51.399 --> 00:06:53.050
And then this

00:06:53.050 --> 00:06:55.860
Should provide you with an authentic medieval rabbit stew. 

00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:59.069
you know its ready when the rabbits gone soft. 

00:06:59.069 --> 00:07:00.749
Because otherwise it’ll be all gamey.

00:07:00.749 --> 00:07:03.269
I’m gonna add a little extra wine because there’s

00:07:03.269 --> 00:07:09.189
Not quite enough liquid in this pan. No one complains about too much wine.

00:07:09.189 --> 00:07:11.120
When its nearing the end, you 

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:12.879
Can add some bread crumbs

00:07:12.879 --> 00:07:15.979
That will make it thicker

00:07:15.979 --> 00:07:19.299
That’s the traditional way, I guess you could use flour as well but the recipe says breadcrumbs.

00:07:19.299 --> 00:07:26.299
1 hour later

00:07:27.729 --> 00:07:29.509
This is delicious

00:07:29.509 --> 00:07:32.570
The rabbit is delicious

00:07:32.570 --> 00:07:39.369
How do you say that in Swedish

00:07:39.369 --> 00:07:46.369
Detta är ????

00:07:50.199 --> 00:07:51.739
It’s nice

00:07:51.739 --> 00:07:58.229
Goes well with an ale

00:07:58.229 --> 00:08:01.519
Good medieval food

00:08:01.519 --> 00:08:05.479
how do you say that in Old English?
