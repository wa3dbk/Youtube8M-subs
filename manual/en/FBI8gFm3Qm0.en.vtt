00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:11.700
I've said it a hundred times

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.700
sausage making should be regarded as 
an essential skill for any hunter

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:19.700
and even though I've been making it for years
this time it's extra special

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:23.400
I harvested my own casing from a small intestine of the pig

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:26.000
cut out a section 
hosed out the goods

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
and then preserved it by packing it in salt in my freezer

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.500
we're gonna fill this gut with the animal's own meat

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.700
along with a host of tasty ingredients
from one of Max's recipes

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:38.700
- So what do you call the sausages?

00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:42.000
- Well, this is an Okeechobee pork sausage, so...

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
- You made it specific to the death's location
to this pig's death.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
- Yeah, so it's got a little bit of Floribean got some citrus in it's

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
got some jalapeño a little bit of ground cumin

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
- I can tell you in this area we're hunting 
there was a lot of orange

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
you're gonna zest that
I'll put the first ground on here

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
it is gonna be a fresh sausage going into our hog casing

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000
yup
and a lot of fresh ingredients not as ton of dry ingredients

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:06.000
it's kind of fun to do it with real fresh stuff

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
you know, I don't use garlic powder and I don't use onion powder
especially in a fresh sausage

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.000
you know, I don't use garlic powder and I don't use onion powder
especially in a fresh sausage

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.000
here comes the ice cream

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.000
alright

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
now put in this lug and we'll hand mix everything

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000
in lot of sausages you'll use a little bit of water to help it ?? to help it stick together

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
we're just gonna replace that with a little bit of orange juice

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000
so we're doing onion, minced-up jalapeño garlic
garlic yeah

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
You got lime zest orange zest orange juice

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000
this isn't the word I use very often, but
that's kind of festive blend, man.

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000
the smell is nice 
smells like summertime

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.000
