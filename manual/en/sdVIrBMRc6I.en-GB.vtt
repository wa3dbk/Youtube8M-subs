00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:09.480
*halloween music*

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:11.660
D: Jack?

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:12.760
J: Yeah?

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:14.260
D: What are you supposed to be?

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:17.500
J: Can't you tell?

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:19.020
D: Racist?

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:22.040
J: No! Obviously not. I'm a ghost

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:23.900
J: What are you supposed to be?

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:25.080
D: A ghost.

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.560
J: That's not what ghosts look like

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:27.340
D: How do you know?

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:28.420
J: Ghosts aren't red!

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:29.600
D: They are in Pacman.

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:30.100
J: What?

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:32.600
D: What is this? Do you not like diversity in your afterlife?

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.360
D: Can't they be white, red, yellow-

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:35.420
J: Yeah, all colours are welcome!

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:36.400
D: Is this a race thing?

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.040
J: Absolutely not! I'm not racist! So..

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:41.940
D: Well, you could have  fooled me. You do look like a member of the KKK

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:42.980
J: You look like a memb -

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:46.120
J: You could be a stylish member of the KKK

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:49.000
D: What, a fashionable racist? Doesn't exist

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:52.000
J: Well, speaking of fashion, costumes at this party

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.000
J: Awful

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.140
D: I don't think that's fair. Someone came dressed up as you

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:00.300
D: That is top notch

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:02.260
J: Awh I've just realised something

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:04.200
J: You cannot stand there.

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:05.000
D: Why not?

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:10.080
J: Uh.. because.. we look like we've come to the party dressed as the before and after

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.040
J: of a sanitary towel

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:17.180
J: Have you been speaking to anyone else tonight?

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:19.100
D: No. I don't dare

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:21.660
J: Literally no one is acknowledging us

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:23.880
D: What if no one can see us?

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:25.920
D: What if we're actually ghosts?

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:30.160
What did you die from?

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:31.740
Eboooola

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:32.860
Ha, cheers!

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:34.740
J: No, no that is not a thing

00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:37.500
D: What if everyone else is dead, and we're still alive?

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:40.280
Both: AHHHHHHH

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.060
J: That seems even less likely than the first one

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.520
D: What if everyone's gay? And we're still alive

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:49.300
J: That looks the same to me. That looks no different

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:50.100
disembodied voice: social commentary

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.300
D: I reckon we could be ghosts

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:55.080
J: If we are ghosts, then we can walk through stuff right?

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:55.960
D: Yeah I reckon we could

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:57.420
D: I'll give it a go right now.

00:01:57.440 --> 00:02:01.020
D: I won't make a big fuss about it though, cos if it does work, I don't want to scare anyone

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:03.800
*bang*

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:07.180
J: Did it work?

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:08.680
D: Nah

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.400
D: You know, I've still got a lot to practice with the whole walking through the walls thing

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:14.540
D: like if I give it a bit more of a push

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.760
J: Ahh I don't know anyone at this party

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.680
D: No you do, you do. You know Paul

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:20.340
D: You could talk to him.

00:02:20.540 --> 00:02:22.540
J: No, I'm not talking to Paul, have you ever spoken to him?

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.300
J: His resting face looks like he's having a traumatic flashback

00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:34.660
*traumatic flashback noise*

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:35.960
J: You see what I mean?

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:37.880
D: Do you know what I'm thinking?

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.120
D: Why do fancy dress shops have to make womens costumes, like, sexy?

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:42.940
D: Like, a sexy witch?

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:44.260
D: What's sexy about a witch?

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:45.120
D: They eat children.

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.520
J: And what if the girls don't want to be sexy,

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:47.040
J: did you ever think about that?

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.180
J: What if I want to be sexy?!

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:49.260
J: There's no option for me.

00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:50.000
D: Awh babe.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:50.860
D: Don't.

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:53.320
J: Oh look. Sexy ghost

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:55.100
D: Or a sexy racist

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:56.400
D: Jack!

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:57.400
J: All right Dean?

00:02:57.540 --> 00:02:58.300
J: DEAN?!

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.740
D: Funny story actually, I've been talking to someone dressed up just like you all night

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:02.520
J: But if you're there -

00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:03.140
D: Didn't even know!

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:03.640
J: Then, how -

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:04.360
J: Who?

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:05.140
D: Are you ok?

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:07.960
J: Dean, I think I've been speaking to a real ghost

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:09.140
J: this whole night

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:10.260
D: Jack, you're scaring me

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:17.060
*dramatic music*

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:18.260
*pings* Ah!

00:03:18.260 --> 00:03:19.980
J: Oh no wait, there he is!

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:21.460
J: That's fine

00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:23.720
D: It's a sexy racist

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.040
J: Hello, groovy people of the internet

00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:30.740
J: My name's Jack Howard
D: And I'm Dean Dobbs

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:31.780
J: We hope you enjoyed that video

J: If you did, then you can click like and subscribe and more things like this will happen to you again

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:37.980
D: Yeah, and if you like that, but wanna see it in real life

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:41.460
D: then we're doing a show at Bloomsbury theatre, ninth of November, in London

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:43.100
D: It's bi- it's a big room

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.720
J: Come along
D: Yeah

00:03:43.940 --> 00:03:44.980
J: It's gonna cost you money though

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:46.200
D: I don't know what that is

00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:47.060
J: You don't know what-

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:48.660
J: Alright, well, they hopefully do

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:50.020
J: And they'll be able to give it to us

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:51.860
J: Actually just give it to me, 'cos he doesn't know how to use it, so-

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:53.380
D: No. You could teach me?

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:54.060
J: Uh, yep

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:55.200
D: What do you keep looking at?

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:56.000
J: Nothing

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:58.180
*gasp*
