00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
(woman)

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.000
I come to Ambles Machinery

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.000
to walk the yard to imagine what

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:17.000
the piece is going to be like.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
This happens all the time

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
at Ambles.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
I'll see something and be

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
like, what was it?

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:23.000
What could it have been?

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000
I can tell it was a shovel

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
for a backhoe or something.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.000
But immediately when I

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
looked at it, I saw a sleigh.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
So it could be a sleigh next.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
My name is Heather Doyle,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
and I'm a metal sculptor

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
and a blacksmith, and I teach

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:41.000
sculpture welding

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:42.000
and blacksmithing

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.000
at Minneapolis Community

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
and Technical College,

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:49.000
and I am also very soon to be

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.000
the artistic director of the new

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Chicago Avenue Fire Arts Center

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
in South Minneapolis.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
There isn't a lot of opportunity

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:59.000
for uberfashion in my life

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.000
because I go

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.000
from like, mom to metalwork.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
So the fashion sense comes out

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.000
in weird T-shirts

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
and weird socks.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.000
This is going

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.000
to go whoosh, so...

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000
(whoosh!)

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.000
(whoosh!)

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
That's a forge,

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000
and we're using

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.000
7 pounds of pressure,

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:23.000
which brings the forge

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000
up to about 2300 degrees,

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:25.000
which will bring our metal

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000
up to a nice orange

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:25.000
in just a few minutes.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000
I'm gonna be flattening the ends

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000
to connect to the bottom

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
of the typewriter.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000
And I'll just drill through

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000
the flattened portion then

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
and use the existing screws

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
that are

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.000
coming out of the typewriter

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
to fasten it together.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.000
I found this typewriter

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
about 20 years ago,

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.000
and it's been a tool for me,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
kind of a cathartic tool

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.000
to process through ideas

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:50.000
that were spinning in my head.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.000
I don't actually record, there's

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
no paper in the typewriter.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.000
I just type on it

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.000
just because I like

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:56.000
the mechanical feel

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.000
of the typewriter itself.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.000
So I've had it in my life

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000
for a really long time,

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.000
and, of course, my children have

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000
grown up with this typewriter.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.000
My oldest daughter Anya

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
asked me if she could have it,

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.000
so I decided to make it

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000
into a table for her,

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.000
and I'm forging

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
some schwoopie legs for it

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.000
that will support a tabletop

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000
that will go to my daughter.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000
(loud metallic tapping)

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Yeah,

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.000
forging you stay really closely

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:28.000
connected to the material.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
So move that.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000
I think

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
the most signature element

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.000
of my style

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:36.000
is the Art Nouveau schwoop.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.000
Doesn't have enough

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
schwoop action if you ask me.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.000
I also use a lot

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
of industrial elements--

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.000
cogs and sprockets

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.000
and that type of thing,

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.000
and really, it's

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
the combination of the two.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.000
This is my favorite aisle,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000
I really, really love

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.000
the cogs and sprockets and

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000
chains in this section.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
I use them often in my artwork.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.000
I can guarantee that

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000
something in this aisle

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
will inspire me, it always does.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.000
So this is

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000
my very favorite aisle,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:10.000
and I have spent hours,

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
hours literally

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.000
hanging out in this aisle,

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000
yeah, finding cool stuff!

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.000
Very nice.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.000
I also like that steel,

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000
we think of in this culture

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.000
as being something really hard

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:21.000
and immovable, and it's not.

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.000
When you add heat it's really

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.000
organic and flowing

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.000
and beautiful to work with.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:32.000
It's a lot more plastic,

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.000
a lot more like clay.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:36.000
In the past,

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:35.000
this metal sculpture realm,

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.000
it's been male dominated.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.000
It doesn't need to be something

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:43.000
that involves 25-inch biceps.

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.000
(laughs)

00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.000
Not that I don't have pipes.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
I do have pipes.

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.000
I think that it is

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.000
very empowering.

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000
It is really inspiring to women.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000
Just try it, just try it,

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.000
and if it strikes

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:04.000
a chord with you,

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.000
if it makes

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000
your heart beat faster,

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.000
it's completely attainable--

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000
just start!
