00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:08.320
Today on RMC Create Station we’re making
lava lamps.

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:11.080
Hi!

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:23.890
I’m Riley and today we will need a glass,
water, vegetable oil, effervescent tablets

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:25.840
and food coloring.

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:42.600
Let’s fill our glass three quarters of the
way with vegetable oil.

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:50.200
Next we’ll take our water and add a few
drops of food coloring to it.

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:55.690
Now stir it up.

00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:06.670
Now let’s pour our water into our glass.

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:21.759
For this next part I will put my safety goggles
on.

00:01:21.759 --> 00:01:25.880
Aren’t they fabulous?

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:32.109
(Laugh) But seriously, back to the experiment.

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:36.189
Now we’re going to take our tablets, I’m
not going to say who make these but it rhymes

00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:37.869
with malka smeltzer.

00:01:37.869 --> 00:02:06.950
Break your tablet into smaller pieces, drop
them in your glass and watch the magic happen!

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:24.000
How cool is that?

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:32.689
And now for the big show!

00:02:32.689 --> 00:02:33.799
So pretty!

00:02:33.799 --> 00:02:34.840
Thanks for joining us!

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:35.840
See you next time.

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:40.010
Science Alert – The oil floats on the water
because it is less dense than the water.

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:43.599
The tablets contain citric acid and baking
soda.

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:50.100
When they dissolve in the water carbon dioxide
rises to the top carrying the colored water

00:02:50.100 --> 00:03:02.650
with it and voila, lava lamp!

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:18.799
Wanna see something really cool?

00:03:18.799 --> 00:03:25.260
Watch this.

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:51.099
(Laughter)
