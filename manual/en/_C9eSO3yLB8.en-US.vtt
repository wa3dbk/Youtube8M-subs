00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.160
*Achievement Hunter and Rage Quit intro*

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:07.760
Game: Fuzion Frenzy 2!

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:09.600
Michael: *mocking voice* Fuzion Frenzy 2!

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:10.980
Look at this fucking shit.

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:12.620
I'll be Zak with a K.

00:00:13.060 --> 00:00:15.700
"Please set the number of dominated planets needed to win"

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:18.180
I need like a million fucking planets.

00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.700
Ooooooooooooooooooh my God.

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:21.280
What am I looking at? What is this guy?

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:23.300
Well the lip syncing is incredible.

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:26.660
I love how is mouth keeps moving eight minutes after he stops talking.

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:29.220
Welcome to Fuzion Frenzy 2, this is the game.

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:30.880
Oh, here we go, finally.

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:32.080
Nope, never mind.

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:33.380
Holy shit, God-

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:35.040
Who the hell were you even talking to?

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:36.860
You were looking into outer space.

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.460
There's no one there!

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:40.420
So the planets are: Earth

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:41.460
Ok, makes sense.

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:42.060
And then,

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:43.140
Machina,

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:44.120
Moisture,

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:45.060
Blazer,

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:45.880
Icicle.

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:46.540
Really?

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:49.900
Why don't we name it, "Earth", "Fire", "Wind", "Water", and a heart?

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:52.420
Now we're just gonna dive in and get wet in Moisture.

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.180
Get it? "Moisture"!

00:00:54.720 --> 00:00:55.360
Liquids.

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:57.280
Holy shit, we're back to this guy.

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.680
Can we just fly into this black hole and die and that be the end of the game?

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.060
He's still fucking talking.

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:06.520
This guy just doesn't SHUT THE FUCK UP!

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.480
HOLY SHIT, how long does this go on?!

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:11.180
Sweet.

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:11.680
Sweet. (2x)

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:12.180
Sweet. (3x)

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.360
Let's just fucking go.

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:16.320
Let's pick a fucking goddamn game already!

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:17.480
It's back to this guy.

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:17.980
It's-

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:21.820
EVERY FUCKING ACTION YOU HAVE TO DEAL WITH THIS GUY!

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:23.920
Select the game type, talk to this guy.

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.080
Pick the fucking game, talk to this guy.

00:01:26.180 --> 00:01:28.080
SCRATCH YOUR ASS, TALK TO THIS GUY!

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:30.640
Do we really have to go on another planet to do this?

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.000
To sit in the water?

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:34.160
I'm pretty sure Earth is mostly made of water.

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:36.740
I don't know what the fuck I'm doing.

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:39.220
Oh my God! She drowned!

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:40.760
We're murdering people!

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:42.000
Oh, they're murdering me.

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:42.900
Yeah, get the blue guy.

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:44.560
GET THE BLUE GUY, YOU FUCK!

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.600
NO!!

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:47.340
YOU SON OF A BITCH!!

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:48.460
This is-this is exciting.

00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:49.780
Duke it out.

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:50.460
Who's gonna win?

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:51.280
Who's gonna win? (2x)

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:51.960
I don't give a shit.

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:52.540
I don't care.

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:54.560
What is coming out of his shoulders?

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:55.560
Is it fire?

00:01:55.660 --> 00:01:56.780
Get the fucking-

00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:58.680
on the guy, goddamn it!

00:01:59.040 --> 00:01:59.540
FUCK!

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:02.300
Little bit behind the score here, as you can see.

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:03.920
Blue Girl: Guess I won, huh?

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.200
Michael: Yeah, I guess you did, you stupid cunt.

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.820
Just fucking pick a level.

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:09.220
Why can't I skip this?

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:11.520
It takes him EIGHT MINUTES!!

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.040
Just fucking get the coins!

00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.600
Get the coins!

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:14.360
Get the coins! (2x)

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:15.940
I-I don't know how to go faster.

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:19.140
*Constipation noises*

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.080
GET UP THERE!

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:21.800
GET UP THERE!! (2x)

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:23.260
Oh my God.

00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:24.260
Did I fucking drown?

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:25.120
I'm drowning.

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:26.420
I'm drowning! (2x)

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:27.400
I'm drowning! (3x)

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.220
CAN I GET A FUCKING SONIC BUBBLE?!

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.080
These guys are BEATING my fucking ass.

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.600
Come here, bitch!

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:34.740
Jab, jab, jab, jab, jab, jab, jab, jab!

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:35.400
I'm dead.

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:36.660
I'm fucking dead.

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:41.240
I LOVE how I have to watch the fucking CPU's fight and then it would just automatically finish.

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.340
Thirty seconds of pure joy await for me!

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:48.220
Can we just fucking grab this dude in the parking lot and just fucking shank him?

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:49.260
I want him dead.

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:50.620
Look at his fucking tie!

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:54.200
Look at his FUCKING STUPID, obnoxious neon tie!

00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:56.040
Neon Tie Guy: What's your favorite type of battle?

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:56.780
Michael: I don't know.

00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:00.740
The one where you fucking shut your mouth and stop talking you annoying fuc-

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:02.680
SHUT UP! I'M FUCKING TALKING!

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.120
Can we just put this guy on the escape pod and shoot him into outer space

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:09.120
into the cold reaches of space where he'll freeze to death?

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:10.460
I can't- I um- I can't do anything.

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:11.220
Oh, I can jump.

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:11.720
Jump!

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.020
Jump OVER IT, fuck-face!

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:15.760
I HIT EVERY SINGLE ONE!

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:17.880
EVERY SINGLE FUCKING LASER BEAM!

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.880
ARE YOU FUCKING SHITTING ME?!

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:21.820
HOLY FUCK! *Throws controller*

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:24.040
JESUS CHRIST, YELLOW GUY!

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:26.600
YOU DID NOT JUMP OVER ONE!

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:27.980
White men can't jump,

00:03:27.980 --> 00:03:29.560
YELLOW DUDES CAN'T JUMP!

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:31.340
WOODY HARRLESON IS LAUGHING AT YOU!!

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:34.420
That went on for about four minutes after I fucking died.

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:36.160
Sixty-fucking-five jumps?

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:40.360
The guy couldn't jump over ONE FUCKING LASER!

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.280
YOU FUCKING GODDAMN HOBBLING PIECE OF SHIT!!

00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:53.200
*Achievement Hunter outro*
