RICK TOBEY: Hello. I'm Rick Tobey and on behalf
of Expert Village, I'm going to teach some

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:17.430
blues guitar techniques. Now, playing blues
on a standard tuning guitar, it's important

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:25.070
that guitar is in tune. The guitar has six
strings. The lowest string is called the number

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:32.500
six string. It's an E, and this is how it
sounds when it's in tune. The 5th string is

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:51.440
an A. The 4th string is a D. The 3rd string
is a G. The 2nd string is tuned to a B, and

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:59.950
the 1st string is tuned to an E. Now, there's
several ways to tune a guitar. You can tune

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:06.870
it by ear. Of course, if you're starting out
like from nothing, you're going to need a

00:01:06.870 --> 00:01:12.229
reference point to at least get one of the
strings in tune to standard pitch which is

00:01:12.229 --> 00:01:20.850
A 440 is what it's called. So, let's assume
that your A string is in tune. From there,

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:29.320
you can tune the D string by placing your
finger on the 5th fret of the A string, and

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:43.810
this will give you the D note. So for example,
if this string was out of tune, you'll just--5th

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:56.799
fret on the 5th string gives you the A. You
could use your ear to tune up to that string.

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:01.549
And then you can use that procedure on the
rest of the strings, always on the 5th fret

00:02:01.549 --> 00:02:21.099
right here--that was a little out of tune.
Now when you get to the 3rd string, you need

00:02:21.099 --> 00:02:30.859
to put your finger on the 4th fret that gives
you the B, and then for the high E string,

00:02:30.859 --> 00:02:42.219
once again, put your finger on the 5th fret
of the B string.

00:02:42.219 --> 00:02:45.760
Now in the next segment, we will tune up our
guitars together.
