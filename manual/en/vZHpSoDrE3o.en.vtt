00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Music Plays

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.000
We have gathered here for a conversation
about the future of public universities.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
We believe their future will be incredibly bright
but to flourish it must be different from the

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.000
past and the present

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
The present models that we have
 the present platforms that we have

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
the present systems that we have
have taken us to where we are

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:26.000
and unless we can find a way to reorganize
restructure and move in new directions

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
we are not going to be able to get up to the
next step

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Please join me in welcoming the former
Prime Minister of United Kingdom, Tony Blair

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
I'd like to give my thanks to
obviously to Governor Bush, Governor Hunt

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:47.000
to Randy Best (indiscernible) Academic Partnerships and
it's a real pleasure to be with you in Dallas, Texas

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
and to address The Future of State Universities Conference

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Please join me in welcoming Dr. Michael Crow

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Dr. Steve Murdock

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
U.S. Secretary of Education, Arne Duncan

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Dr. Martha Kanter

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Please join me in welcoming, Sal Khan

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
We are actually using technology to as on (indiscernible) sounds
human eye is the actual physical experience

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:14.000
You know we are growing so fast, we are 2.5 million
3 million users per month right now

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
This time last year it was a million
so growing about three-fold a year

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000
So there is a lot of people that you
can immediately engage with

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
Dr. Walter Bumphus

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000
Dr. Ralph Wolff

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000
I don't think that our old traditional models
have accreditation of going to work

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Dr. Belle Wheelan

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000
Dr. Francisco Cigarroa

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:37.000
Anyone who is in a university campus clearly understands
that our traditional revenue streams will not sustain

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.000
our current models

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000
Dr. Michael Wesch from Kansas State University

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Almost the entire body of human knowledge is actually
floating in the air all around these students

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
as I say in these rooms

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000
So they are really good at entertaining themselves online

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000
They are not necessarily really good at educating
themselves online, especially these really

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000
high levels of education we want to achieve
and so that's where we come in

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
Former Prime Minister of Australia, John Howard

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:15.000
Your country boasts the very best universities that can
be found anywhere in the world

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:23.000
But you along with me will not be blind of the reality
that side by side with that you face many challenges

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:30.000
about the continuation of university infrastructure
in the United States as we do in Australia

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
Please join me in welcoming my hero
Dr. Clayton Christensen

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:44.000
I suspect that there are a lot of us who if we just go back
and say, I have been to this conference for three days

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:51.000
Holy cow, I got a whole list of things that we got to
change, the resistance will be powerful

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:57.000
If we are frozen in our models relative to technology
If we are frozen in our models relative to how we teach

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:03.000
and how we create learning environments, if we are frozen
in our models of what we think a great university is

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.000
then we are in for a very rough road ahead.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:12.000
Somebody said to me yesterday that they had not ever
been to a conference this like this

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000
that's because there has never been one before

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:26.000
If you look to me the past of prior Ed
there has not been any disruption of any substance

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:33.000
But online learning now in our view changes the game
quite remarkably
