00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:05.530
I have now gone over the Blues form. I have
showed the Blues in the key of C and gone

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:11.470
over the major form. Gone through the chords
of the Blues. And shown the scales that are

00:00:11.470 --> 00:00:19.230
being used in the Blues. I have also shown
a common head Cool Blues and I have also shown

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:24.259
how to solo and improvise over the Blues.
To sum it all up I am going to play a common

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:29.970
Blues form that includes the form three times
playing the head of the Cool Blues, an improvised

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:34.740
solo, and then Cool Blues one more time using
the changes on the piano. This should sum

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:41.450
up what a common Blues piece is like. I hope
you enjoy and learn and practice this style

00:00:41.450 --> 00:02:13.409
to play fun Blues and improvising in Jazz.

00:02:13.409 --> 00:02:15.269
Thanks and I hope you enjoy the Blues in C.
