00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:07.949
Wat's up guys, I'm doing the unboxing of the control that just arrived the GTX3

00:00:07.949 --> 00:00:09.679
Turnigy's

00:00:09.679 --> 00:00:12.949
It's a control for Car or Boat

00:00:12.949 --> 00:00:17.409
is a control with 3 channels

00:00:17.409 --> 00:00:20.599
the receiver was not in the box

00:00:20.599 --> 00:00:22.960
we will make a video showing

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:24.829
how to bind it

00:00:24.829 --> 00:00:28.119
let's get it out the box

00:00:28.119 --> 00:00:35.119
to see how it is packaged, and kill everyone's curiosity ... I bought in HobbyKing, as most know.

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:39.540
comes with a manual showing

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.250
how to configure

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:44.140
how to

00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:45.620
charge

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:47.000
how to connect

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.120
in a receiver

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.880
how to use in a nitro or electric RC car

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:54.700
program configuration

00:00:54.700 --> 00:01:01.700
we will make a video about it

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:08.150
he comes in.

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:15.150
a pack of Styrofoam

00:01:17.370 --> 00:01:18.670
only comes control and manual

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:20.560
only this in the box

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.100
the receiver came out the box

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.340
then

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.750
is a 3 channel control, as I said

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:31.290
the antenna

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:35.390
can be gathered, has an input for the simulator

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:38.770
for you to use in a simulator, So far you've can charge the batteries

00:01:38.770 --> 00:01:40.270
Rechargeable ones ;)

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:42.110
then I'll make a video

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:46.430
to put a lipo battery, which has also reached

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.670
to dont use cells and and use it for longer

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:54.510
The third channel is here(tomb).

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:58.210
throttle in the trigger, some settings can be made as

00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:04.770
ABS, it simulates an ABS. exponential acceleration

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:07.240
I will make a video showing how to bind

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:09.319
it with the receiver

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:13.929

00:02:13.929 --> 00:02:16.939
