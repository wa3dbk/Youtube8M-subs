00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:21.480
And today I'm going to talk to you about bodybuilding.

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.490
Here are some greats tips to help you get
started with your bodybuilding and training

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:26.699
efforts.

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.180
You want to join a gym.

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:33.570
A gym provides a great environment for you
to learn and grow from.

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:40.050
A gym also has a wider variety of machines
and weights for you to choose from.

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:43.069
Consider getting a mentor to help you with
the process.

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:49.149
Invest in a trainer so you don't have to reinvent
the wheel and figure everything out for yourself.

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:54.649
Get yourself a training partner; someone who's
experienced and wouldn't mind helping you

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:57.639
learn the ropes, learn the whole process.

00:00:57.639 --> 00:00:58.859
Create structure.

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:03.249
You want to find a routine you can work with
and remember that routine does not have to

00:01:03.249 --> 00:01:04.519
be perfect.

00:01:04.519 --> 00:01:10.480
Just get started with the process and you
can learn from your experiences and make adjustments

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:11.640
from there.

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:17.240
It's very important that you backup what you
do in the gym with great nutritional habits.

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:22.170
It really doesn't matter if you train like
an animal in the gym and you're very consistent

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:28.000
with your workouts if you don't back that
up with great nutritional habits.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:31.780
So pay a lot of attention to your eating habits.

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:33.070
Be patient.

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:37.420
When you follow through with your weight training
habits, with your workouts on a consistent

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:43.200
basis, when you follow through with your eating
habits your gains will come when they should

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.200
come.

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.170
So be patient with the process.

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:50.420
When you do all those things you're going
to enjoy the journey.

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:56.080
When you enjoy the journey there's no doubt
you'll be better at it.

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:59.770
Again, have fun with the process.

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:04.020
Those are some of the basic tips on how to
get started with your bodybuilding and training

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:04.630
efforts.
