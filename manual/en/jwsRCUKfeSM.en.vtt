How to Make Apple Pie
(French Apple Pie Recipe)

00:00:03.990 --> 00:00:05.900
I love homemade pies.

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:09.530
But pies are really tough to make from
scratch and require hours in the

00:00:09.530 --> 00:00:11.090
kitchen, right?

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:13.320
Well, not with these great recipes.

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:15.230
Hi, I'm Cricket Azima.

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:19.940
We're going to start with a holiday
classic, Impossibly Easy Pumpkin Pie.

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:23.960
You'll be amazed at how easy it is to
make, mainly because the crust is

00:00:23.960 --> 00:00:26.240
actually inside the pie.

00:00:26.240 --> 00:00:29.310
Preheat your oven to 350 degrees.

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.000
Start with some Bisquick.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.410
In a bowl, combine the Bisquick with
some canned pumpkin, not pumpkin pie

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:46.970
mix, sugar, evaporated milk, melted
butter or margarine, egg, vanilla, and

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:50.180
pumpkin pie spice.

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:53.510
After you've mixed all the ingredients
together, you're going to pour the

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:56.670
batter into a greased
nine inch pie plate.

00:00:56.670 --> 00:01:02.210
You'll bake it at 350 degrees
for about 35 to 40 minutes.

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:02.990
And that's it.

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:04.170
Wasn't that quick and easy?

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.270
Then you can serve it with some whipped
cream, vanilla ice cream, or

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:09.980
even sprinkle some nuts
or cinnamon on top.

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:14.040
Now this pie is about as
iconic as it gets.

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.250
Impossibly Easy French Apple Pie.

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:19.950
Preheat the oven to 325.

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:23.360
Spray a nine inch pie pan
with cooking spray.

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:29.350
Mix thinly sliced peeled apples,
cinnamon, and nutmeg together.

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:33.600
Try using different types of apples,
like empire, regent, or spartan, for

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:35.230
different flavors.

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:38.560
Then, pour your mixture
into the pie pan.

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:42.560
You can also experiment with other
filling like peaches or fresh berries.

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.510
Next up is to make a batter
starting with Bisquick.

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:55.950
Add sugar, milk, eggs, and softened
butter or margarine.

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:59.440
Once you've mixed the ingredients
together, pour them over the apples.

00:01:59.440 --> 00:02:01.770
And then, we're onto the last step.

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:08.139
In a separate bowl, make a streusel
topping by mixing Bisquick, some firm

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:14.710
butter, brown sugar, and
some chopped nuts.

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:18.660
Then, I'm going to use a fork to break
up the ingredients until they're

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:24.800
really well combined into
a crumbly texture.

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:27.140
Sprinkle the topping over the pie.

00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:32.820
I'm going to spread the topping
evenly to cover the apples.

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:36.960
Now, you're going to bake a
pie for 45 to 50 minutes.

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:40.650
Once your pie is done, you can serve
it warm and top it with vanilla ice

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.140
cream, or even some homemade
whipped cream.

00:02:43.140 --> 00:02:44.540
So there you go.

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:49.120
Delicious, Homemade, and impossibly
easy pies that can be made

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.640
in no time at all.

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:56.100
