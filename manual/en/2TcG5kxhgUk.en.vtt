00:00:03.580 --> 00:00:07.960
One of the main areas that people want to
target with their shapewear is their tummy

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:11.560
and there are lots of different styles you
can choose from.

00:00:11.560 --> 00:00:15.080
One way to slim your tummy is with a shaping
vest.

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:20.180
This one Lizzie's wearing is light control
and can be worn on it's own or layered under

00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:21.180
something else.

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:25.439
It's longer length to prevent roll up and
comes right down to your hips to pull you

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:27.760
in all around your middle.

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:32.320
It comes up quite high at the back so it's
also great for smoothing out any bulges around

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:33.630
your bra strap.

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:40.040
As you can see, it's made sure there's no
muffin top at the waistline of Lizzie's jeans.

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:44.650
Just a nice smooth line.

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:49.410
For a more dramatic effect, try something
with a stronger level of control, like this

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:50.560
strappy vest.

00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:55.619
This will pull you in even more for a trimmer
looking figure.

00:00:55.619 --> 00:01:01.190
This vest has zoned panels so it's not suitable
for wearing on its own.

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:07.690
Now, both of the vest styles we've just shown
are worn over your bra and give you a slimming

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:11.070
and smoothing effect around your bust area.

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:15.710
If you want to focus just on smoothing your
tummy, you could try a pair of high waisted

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:18.850
briefs like these that Lizzie is wearing here.

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:20.290
These are medium control.

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:26.220
The sheer mesh side panel will give you a
sexy look and the center control panel really

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:29.730
helps to give you a flatter tummy.

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:35.940
So, what if you want to go beyond just a flatter
stomach?

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:40.180
What if you really want to cinch in that waist
for an hourglass figure?

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:46.250
Well, with very firm control garments you
can get some really noticeable results.

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:50.890
Lizzie has now got on a waist corset.

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:56.450
This is very firm control and it's got boning
in it too to prevent roll up.

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:01.440
It's made of rubber but it's lined with cotton
so it still feels really comfortable against

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:02.440
your skin.

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:07.820
As you can see it gives quite a dramatic effect
and in some cases gives the appearance of

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:09.560
inch loss.

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:14.560
Now this will feel restrictive but when you're
wearing it, you'll find it helps your posture

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.440
and keeps you nice and upright.

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:23.870
Now that Lizzie's got this wrap dress on you
can really see the difference it's made to

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:25.430
her waistline.

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:31.560
It's given her that lovely in and out shape,
really sexy curves.

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:37.120
For a waist cinching effect, this waist nipper
has a lighter level of control.

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:41.480
This will still give you great curves and
is more suitable for everyday wear.
