00:00:06.367 --> 00:00:08.434
Welcome to the League of Legends Champion Spotlight

00:00:08.434 --> 00:00:11.067
featuring Gangplank the Saltwater Scourge.

00:00:22.767 --> 00:00:27.834
(Gangplank) "There's only one way in Bilgewater... mine."

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:34.934
As unpredictable as he is brutal,

00:00:34.934 --> 00:00:37.434
Gangplank reigns as Bilgewater's uncrowned king

00:00:37.434 --> 00:00:40.500
through a mix of fear, violence and cunning.

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.033
Gangplank relishes the rare moments when some fool

00:00:43.033 --> 00:00:45.500
challenges him, going to war with pistol and blade

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:48.400
to remind everyone the truth behind the tall tales.

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:55.707
(Gangplank) "The sea may be wicked, but I'm worse."

00:01:04.267 --> 00:01:06.634
Gangplank's passive is Trial by Fire.

00:01:06.634 --> 00:01:09.167
On a moderate cool down Gangplank ignites his blade,

00:01:09.167 --> 00:01:12.033
causing his next melee attack to deal bonus damage

00:01:12.033 --> 00:01:13.500
apply a true damage DOT

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.734
and grant a brief burst of movement speed.

00:01:17.934 --> 00:01:20.133
Gangplank's Q is Parrrley.

00:01:20.467 --> 00:01:21.834
He fires a shot from his pistol

00:01:21.834 --> 00:01:24.534
dealing damage that can crit like a basic attack.

00:01:24.534 --> 00:01:26.467
Parrrley also applies on hit effects

00:01:26.467 --> 00:01:28.601
like Red buff and Static Shiv.

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:31.667
Parrrley plunders extra gold

00:01:31.667 --> 00:01:35.133
and refunds half its mana cost if it kills a unit.

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.767
For each gold plundered by Parrrley

00:01:36.767 --> 00:01:38.667
Gangplank gains a Silver Serpent,

00:01:38.667 --> 00:01:40.367
which is an exclusive currency he can use

00:01:40.367 --> 00:01:42.434
at the shop to upgrade his ultimate.

00:01:42.434 --> 00:01:43.567
We'll get to that in a minute.

00:01:44.801 --> 00:01:47.667
Use Parrrley in early laning to farm at a safe distance

00:01:47.667 --> 00:01:49.601
from any poke or encroaching junglers

00:01:49.601 --> 00:01:52.100
while pocketing the extra gold as money in the bank.

00:01:54.133 --> 00:01:56.634
Remove Scurvy, Gangplank's W, heals him

00:01:56.634 --> 00:01:58.734
and removes disabling effects.

00:02:00.067 --> 00:02:02.467
The more health he's missing, the more health he recovers.

00:02:02.467 --> 00:02:04.767
Whether facing crowd control, sustained damage

00:02:04.767 --> 00:02:07.434
or vitamin-C deficiency, all Gangplank has to do

00:02:07.434 --> 00:02:09.968
is eat an orange, and it's k.

00:02:12.634 --> 00:02:14.100
Powder Keg is Gangplank's E,

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:15.601
and there's a bit of a mini-game with it

00:02:15.601 --> 00:02:18.133
for the Saltwater Scourge and his opponents.

00:02:18.133 --> 00:02:20.601
When he uses Powder Keg, Gangplank tosses out a barrel

00:02:20.601 --> 00:02:24.067
with three hit points that tick down to one over a few seconds.

00:02:24.067 --> 00:02:27.334
If Gangplank last-hits the barrel with a basic attack or Parrrley,

00:02:27.334 --> 00:02:29.300
it explodes, dealing the attack's damage

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:32.868
including crit that ignores a percentage of enemy armor.

00:02:32.868 --> 00:02:35.167
The explosion slows anyone in the blast zone,

00:02:35.167 --> 00:02:38.200
and plunders gold if triggered by Parrrley.

00:02:40.667 --> 00:02:42.467
He gains barrel charges slowly,

00:02:42.467 --> 00:02:45.300
but can store several barrels for a battery of boom.

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:48.868
Powder Kegs can chain together if their explosion radii connect

00:02:48.868 --> 00:02:50.667
although the damage doesn't stack.

00:02:50.667 --> 00:02:53.634
Basically, each additional barrel makes the area bigger.

00:02:53.634 --> 00:02:56.500
As a reward for exploding a barrel, Gangplank gains

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.634
bonus movement speed and instantly refreshes his passive.

00:03:00.133 --> 00:03:02.033
But if an enemy last-hits the Keg,

00:03:02.033 --> 00:03:06.000
they'll disarm it with no explosion and pocket a few gold coins.

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.267
Additionally, because they have other, important barrel

00:03:08.267 --> 00:03:10.667
business to attend to, Powder Kegs will disappear

00:03:10.667 --> 00:03:13.834
after being stuck on one tick for sixty seconds.

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:18.567
Keep in mind that Powder Kegs prime themselves faster with level.

00:03:18.567 --> 00:03:21.234
Later in the game, carefully placing one on the path behind you

00:03:21.234 --> 00:03:23.334
will let you Parrrley the barrel as you run

00:03:23.334 --> 00:03:25.500
slowing your pursuers and reaching safety.

00:03:27.734 --> 00:03:29.834
Gangplank's ultimate is Cannon Barrage.

00:03:29.834 --> 00:03:32.200
When he ults, Gangplank calls on his ship to fire

00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:35.267
waves of cannonballs on a large area with global range,

00:03:35.267 --> 00:03:38.033
damaging and slowing enemies caught beneath the barrage.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.534
There are three upgrades Gangplank can purchase over the course

00:03:44.534 --> 00:03:47.300
of the game with the Silver Serpents from Parrrley.

00:03:48.934 --> 00:03:51.334
First up is Death's Daughter, an enormous cannon

00:03:51.334 --> 00:03:54.400
that deals tons of true damage at the beginning of the ultimate.

00:03:57.234 --> 00:03:59.868
Second is Raise Morale, an upgrade that gives allies

00:03:59.868 --> 00:04:03.067
under the avalanche of iron additional move speed.

00:04:05.534 --> 00:04:08.667
And lastly, Fire at Will increases the ult's rate of fire,

00:04:08.667 --> 00:04:10.067
dealing extra damage.

00:04:14.167 --> 00:04:16.667
Remember that your ult give you global presence.

00:04:16.667 --> 00:04:20.601
Even if you're in another lane, it's almost as if you're there in spirit.

00:04:20.801 --> 00:04:23.500
You can use Cannon Barrage to turn the tide of battle

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:26.834
and potentially leave your enemies feeling extra salty.

00:04:33.934 --> 00:04:36.467
Practice makes perfect, and it's still true

00:04:36.467 --> 00:04:38.868
even if what you're practicing is looting and pillaging.

00:04:38.868 --> 00:04:41.467
Let's look at some examples of Gangplank in game.

00:04:41.968 --> 00:04:44.100
More like gameplank...

00:04:45.601 --> 00:04:47.667
Getting whacked upside the head with a flaming sword

00:04:47.667 --> 00:04:50.400
is a substantial chunk of damage, making Trial by Fire

00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:53.834
a critical park of Gangplank's ability to trade in lane.

00:04:53.834 --> 00:04:58.200
Here, Maokai initiates a fight just as Gangplank's passive comes up.

00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:00.567
Immediately after applying the burn, Gangplank explodes

00:05:00.567 --> 00:05:04.734
a Powder Keg allowing the dread pirate a second blazing hit.

00:05:08.601 --> 00:05:11.367
Gangplank can be exceptionally good at zoning and poking

00:05:11.367 --> 00:05:13.868
champions with his barrels, especially anyone who

00:05:13.868 --> 00:05:15.860
needs to get in melee range to trade.

00:05:15.868 --> 00:05:18.400
Here, Gangplank places a barrel in front of the minions

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:21.868
so that Maokai stays zoned. Rather than give up the lane dominance

00:05:21.868 --> 00:05:25.100
he's secured, Gangplank uses chain barrel explosions to harass

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:28.701
the burly treant further and force him even farther back.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.601
Gangplank can unload surprising amounts of damage

00:05:33.601 --> 00:05:35.200
through an in-and-out fighting pattern.

00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:38.033
In this clip, Ekko's looking to fight, so Gangplank starts

00:05:38.033 --> 00:05:41.000
by strategically moving in the opposite direction.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.868
When Ekko misses the stun, Gangplank Parrrleys a Powder Keg

00:05:43.868 --> 00:05:46.367
into a Death's Daughter-empowered Cannon Barrage

00:05:46.367 --> 00:05:49.067
and simply turns back around to clean up the kill.

00:05:51.500 --> 00:05:53.801
With Gangplank's sea-faring background, it should come as

00:05:53.801 --> 00:05:57.133
no surprise he easily clears waves as a split pusher.

00:05:57.133 --> 00:05:59.601
Placing a premeditated Powder Keg in the brush

00:05:59.601 --> 00:06:01.834
will allow him a snap-combo with a second barrel

00:06:01.834 --> 00:06:04.701
if anyone comes to meddle with that split push.

00:06:04.701 --> 00:06:06.868
When challenged, he can use the slow and bonus

00:06:06.868 --> 00:06:09.300
movement speed from his barrels to escape.

00:06:09.300 --> 00:06:11.934
Needing further assistance, Remove Scurvy and Cannon Barrage

00:06:11.934 --> 00:06:15.000
provide the health and slows needed to reposition.

00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:17.734
As he searches for new opponents he sets up

00:06:17.734 --> 00:06:20.734
several multi-Keg chains to evade his pursuers.

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:27.200
As deadly as the barrels can be, they're fragile.

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:29.667
Enemies who are paying attention can easily disarm them,

00:06:29.667 --> 00:06:32.534
negating their strength and Gangplank's advantage.

00:06:32.534 --> 00:06:35.234
In this last clip, watch as Gangplank hides a barrel

00:06:35.234 --> 00:06:38.033
in the razorbeak camp, out of range of his enemies.

00:06:38.033 --> 00:06:40.400
When a fight breaks out, the Saltwater Scourge casts a

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:43.234
second barrel and shoots the first to chain the explosion.

00:06:43.234 --> 00:06:47.000
In the middle of the explosion, he finishes things off with a third barrel

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:49.367
securing a kill on Orianna and Sona.

00:06:49.367 --> 00:06:51.534
A rather powder-ful interaction.

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:53.320
(Gangplank)"Face me, swab!"

00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:57.234

00:07:07.267 --> 00:07:09.467
(Gangplank) "I have a deficiency..."

00:07:09.767 --> 00:07:11.868
"...of cares"
