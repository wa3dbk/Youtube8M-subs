00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:04.780
Although it’s a stereotypical teaching

00:00:04.780 --> 00:00:07.620
that resembles beauty to people

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:15.100
I’ll continue to love abandoned art

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:32.980
Being forgotten, left behind, without being sung,

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:39.140
dulled from so much use, is your lovely melody

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:45.060
Where does the song go? For whose sake does it exist?

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:51.100
We were just simply friends during the beginning

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:54.180
My sense of value has rusted

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.160
Even sympathy is embarrassing

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:03.300
Don’t leave me behind, I like you after all

00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:07.520
I want to fly someday

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.420
like that song that pierced my heart

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:13.320
even if, say, freedom and beauty

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:16.380
are quite distant from me

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:18.540
I want a mutual understanding,

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:22.560
I won’t forget that’s a chance to strike a chord

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.220
With great care I’ll continue

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:31.600
to draw abandoned art

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.520
Brushing anguish

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.520
Praising delight

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:49.500
There’s no way that I’d whisper

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:52.740
(the difference,) right in your ear

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.540
Justice is alright, although

00:01:55.540 --> 00:01:58.520
let’s move onwards together,

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:01.440
dissolving weakness

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:04.680
and mistakes into fine art

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.800
Don’t laugh at my thoughts

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.600
when I wanted to hide

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.640
my insecure melody

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:16.800
At least, for now

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:21.120
I’m drowning in my imagination reflecting

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.120
a state of living that you can’t see in a mirror

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.700
Even if I shall be tormented

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.000
the joy is overflowing after all

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.460
Although it’s a stereotypical teaching

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:36.100
that resembles beauty to people,

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.700
similarly to how people love

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:43.560
it’s neither old nor new

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.100
I want to fly someday

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:59.840
like that song that pierced my heart

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.740
even if, say, freedom and beauty

00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:06.160
are quite distant from me

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.680
I want a mutual understanding,

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:13.520
I won’t forget that’s a chance to strike a chord

00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:16.200
With great care I’ll continue

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:22.580
to draw abandoned art
