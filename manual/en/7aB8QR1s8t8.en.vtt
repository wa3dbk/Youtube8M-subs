Hi, I'm Charly Duffy for the Dulux How To
Series on Interior Surfaces.

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.559
We all know that painting your walls can be
a very rewarding experience.

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:15.030
Take a look at this gorgeous room!

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:19.430
With a little elbow grease and some expert
know-how, you can easily refresh your dining

00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:20.430
area.

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:21.430
Let's find out how.

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:24.529
As you can see, this room needs a little bit
of a refresh…

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:27.280
So I brought along my mate Drew to give me
a hand.

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:31.430
Let's clear these chairs and tables to make
some room to work in.

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:33.710
Good idea.

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:37.129
So we've laid down our drop sheet and cleaned
the wall with sugar soap.

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:41.070
You may think you'd be ok to skip cleaning
the wall, but it's a really important part

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:42.070
of painting.

00:00:42.070 --> 00:00:45.170
Dirt, dust or grease can potentially ruin
your paint job.

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:47.520
As you can also see, we've masked the trim
for cutting in.

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.760
Now we're ready to begin.

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:54.309
Today we'll be using Dulux Wash &amp; Wear Low
Sheen Antique White USA.

00:00:54.309 --> 00:00:58.409
Load your brush by dipping it into the paint
about an inch.

00:00:58.409 --> 00:01:01.980
Then wipe the paint off, on one side only!

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.720
Start with the brush an inch off the corner,
slowly moving towards the cut-in point.

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:10.970
This will help you find your true line before
you hit the edge or corner.

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:14.890
Don't cut-in too far ahead, because you'll
need keep a wet edge for your roller to blend

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:16.110
into the brushed paint.

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:20.500
If your cut-in brush work dries before you
get to it with your roller, you'll end up

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:24.600
with two coats of paint in one spot, which
can lead to ‘picture framing'.

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.060
Use the same technique to cut in around anything
else you've masked off.

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:31.740
Now that's done, it's time for the first coat
of paint.

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:37.170
Loading your roller the right way is very
important to achieve a consistent finish.

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:40.710
Make sure you have an even cover of paint
all the way round the roller sleeve.

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:44.720
A good test is to push the roller forward
on the tray, then lift it up to see if it

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:46.580
spins evenly.

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:52.730
If it doesn't, or feels heavier on one side,
it means the paint isn't even, and you should

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:53.740
load it again.

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:57.560
Now, starting from the edge where you cut
in, roll across the wall.

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:00.770
Try to roll as close to where you cut in as
possible.

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:06.070
You may have heard of the clock theory: Roll
12–6, then diagonally 2–8.

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:07.600
Or you can paint in the ‘W' pattern.

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:11.620
This will help keep your paint film an even
thickness across the wall.

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:15.219
Once you've finished about 3 or 4 metres,
it's time to lay-off your paint.

00:02:15.219 --> 00:02:19.569
Laying off the paint is the most important
part of rolling a wall.

00:02:19.569 --> 00:02:23.879
Start with your roller not loaded with paint,
and rest it in the top left hand corner.

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:27.940
Make sure the closed end of the roller—that's
the part where the handle meets the roller—is

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.170
on the right, while the open end, is on the
left.

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.599
Gently let your roller roll itself straight
down the wall with almost no pressure

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:37.819
just gravity until you get to the bottom

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:43.220
then take your roller off the wall; overlap
it slightly at the top and roll down the wall

00:02:43.220 --> 00:02:44.220
again.

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.249
You'll be making a line down one side, then
rubbing it out with the other

00:02:47.249 --> 00:02:51.020
working your way across the wall.

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:52.709
Once you're done, it's clean-up time.

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:55.829
But don't worry, ‘cause cleaning up is easy!

00:02:55.829 --> 00:03:00.079
Just add Dulux Envirosolutions Waste Paint
Hardener to your left over paint to turn it

00:03:00.079 --> 00:03:01.730
into hard waste.

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:05.230
This can be removed from the paint can and
wrapped in newspaper, which can be safely

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:06.680
disposed of.

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.989
We all love a simple solution that's good
for mother Earth too!

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:14.819
This looks so good compared to what it looked
like before.

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:16.540
What a great transformation.

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:18.259
Worth doing, worth Dulux.
