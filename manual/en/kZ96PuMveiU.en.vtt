Hi, I'm Brigitte. This

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:12.090
is Slope Style. I'm with Jill who has joined us from Burton.

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:16.100
We're here to talk about the Jeans Pant and I gotta tell you, Jill,

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:20.110
I saw this pant on the hill a couple times and I'm like, "Oh my god!

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:24.150
He's snowboarding in a real jean like you can't

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:28.250
snowboard in jeans." So, what's with this pant? Is it a jean or...

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:32.270
No. It's actually not jeans. What it is it's a Gore-Tex

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:36.290
highly technical pant and it has a digital sublimation

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:40.320
of denim on top of it so it looks exactly

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:44.340
like a jean but it is not denim.
Interesting, so

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:48.350
even, cause I see that it has holes and

00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:52.380
all abrasions, but those aren't real holes.
No, they're not.

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:56.430
They're all part of the sublimation print on the pants themselves.

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:00.540
We do have some pockets and it has a leather

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:04.580
back like patch so it looks just like a pair of denim but it's definitely not.

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:08.600
Wow. That's incredible. And to be Gore-Tex, that's even more amazing.

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:12.620
So, what is the fit of this pant look like?
This is a Mid Fit

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.660
pant so, our Mid Fit's going to fall somewhere in between a

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.680
signature and slim fit which means it's going to be more tailored through

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:24.710
the hip all the way down to the cuff, and it's going to have a slightly longer

00:01:24.730 --> 00:01:28.790
inseam. But it's not overly slim fit and it's not super baggy.

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:32.820
Right in between.
That's good. And does it have

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.900
anything on the inside?

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:40.930
The lining is mapped with satin lining so it has a really nice lining.

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.990
for the guys so it's nice and soft.

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:49.010
And is there any other features to point out about this?
The pant is

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:53.030
fully taped with Gore-Tex tape and

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:57.080
it does have some of the other universal features that our pants offer but overall

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:01.120
it's a very technical, very high-waterproofing pant.
I see

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:05.140
that it has a lifetime warranty as well.
Absolutely, it's really key to

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:09.150
point out that it does have a lifetime warranty.
You're really getting a key

00:02:09.170 --> 00:02:13.220
good investment.
Absolutely, and style as well.

00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:17.260
Thanks for explaining. That's the Jeans Pant by Burton. This is 

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.270
Slope Style.
