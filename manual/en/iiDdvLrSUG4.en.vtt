00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:01.666
- WELL, WASN'T THAT
YOUR LUCKY DAY

00:00:01.666 --> 00:00:02.800
THAT HE WAS NEARBY.

00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:03.800
- ABSOLUTELY.
- OKAY.

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:05.066
SO, FIRST OF ALL, MARK,

00:00:05.066 --> 00:00:06.700
TELL ME WHAT HAPPENED.

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:09.100
- I WAS RESPONDING TO A PERSON
WITH A WEAPON CALL--

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:11.233
MY LIGHTS AND SIRENS GOING.

00:00:11.233 --> 00:00:12.833
CAME INTO AN INTERSECTION,

00:00:12.833 --> 00:00:15.666
WAS INVOLVED IN
AN AUTO ACCIDENT.

00:00:15.666 --> 00:00:16.900
NEXT THING I KNOW IS,

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:19.333
MY VEHICLE'S CLOSE
TO A SIDEWALK,

00:00:19.333 --> 00:00:21.600
MY AIR BAG'S BLOWN,
AND THERE'S A FIRE

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:23.233
RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME.

00:00:23.233 --> 00:00:24.233
I HAD A--

00:00:24.233 --> 00:00:25.433
- SO YOU DON'T REMEMBER IMPACT?

00:00:25.433 --> 00:00:26.833
- I DON'T.
I DON'T REMEMBER IMPACT.

00:00:26.833 --> 00:00:28.700
I--I JUST KIND OF WOKE UP,
BASICALLY.

00:00:28.700 --> 00:00:30.200
STILL, I KNEW
SOMETHING WAS WRONG.

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.766
I COULDN'T MOVE AROUND TOO MUCH.

00:00:32.766 --> 00:00:34.366
JOE CAME OVER,
STARTED "YO.

00:00:34.366 --> 00:00:36.600
HEY, YOU KNOW,
YOUR CAR'S ON FIRE."

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.233
[laughter]

00:00:38.233 --> 00:00:39.533
I WAS--
AND I WAS KIND OF OUT OF IT.

00:00:39.533 --> 00:00:41.533
LIKE, "WELL, THANKS."

00:00:41.533 --> 00:00:43.066
I TOLD THE RADIO,
"THIS IS WHERE I'M AT.

00:00:43.066 --> 00:00:44.433
I NEED HELP."
AND--

00:00:44.433 --> 00:00:46.300
- SO YOU DIDN'T KNOW
THE CAR WAS ON FIRE.

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:48.633
- I DID--I DID SEE
THAT THE CAR WAS ON FIRE,

00:00:48.633 --> 00:00:51.066
BUT IT DIDN'T REGISTER ENOUGH
TO KNOW THAT I WAS IN DANGER.

00:00:51.066 --> 00:00:52.500
- THAT YOU SHOULD GET OUT.
- EXACTLY.

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.533
- YEAH,
THAT'S MY NATURAL INSTINCT

00:00:54.533 --> 00:00:57.600
WHEN THE CAR IS ON FIRE IS,
LIKE, NOT JUST TO WATCH IT,

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.133
BUT CLEARLY YOU WERE, LIKE,
OUT OF IT.

00:01:00.133 --> 00:01:01.133
SO WHAT HAPPENED?

00:01:01.133 --> 00:01:02.166
SO WHERE WERE YOU,

00:01:02.166 --> 00:01:03.733
AND HOW DID YOU KNOW
THIS HAPPENED?

00:01:03.733 --> 00:01:06.633
- I WAS ACTUALLY VISITING
MY SISTER IN SOUTH PHILLY,

00:01:06.633 --> 00:01:09.033
AND AT THE TIME,
WE WERE WATCHING TV,

00:01:09.033 --> 00:01:11.400
JUST HANGING OUT,
AND WE HEARD THIS LOUD BOOM.

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.900
AND I WAS LIKE, "WHOA,
WHAT THE HECK WAS THAT?"

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:15.533
SO WE ALL GOT UP,
RAN TO THE DOOR,

00:01:15.533 --> 00:01:17.666
LOOKED OUT,
AND IT WAS KIND OF SMOKY,

00:01:17.666 --> 00:01:20.800
BUT RIGHT AWAY,
I KNEW IT WAS A COP CAR.

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.166
AND I'M A VOLUNTEER FIREFIGHTER
FOR 3 1/2 YEARS, SO...

00:01:23.166 --> 00:01:24.166
- LOOK AT THAT.

00:01:24.166 --> 00:01:27.000
[cheers and applause]

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.033
SO WHEN I REALIZED
IT WAS A COP,

00:01:29.033 --> 00:01:31.400
KIND OF HIT HOME
A LITTLE BIT FOR ME.

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:34.600
SO INSTANTLY I JUST RAN UP
TO THE CAR--RUN UP TO HIM.

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.066
I WAS LIKE,
"HOW ARE YOU?"

00:01:36.066 --> 00:01:37.733
AND HE'S--
HE WAS ALL DISORIENTED,

00:01:37.733 --> 00:01:38.866
DIDN'T KNOW WHERE HE WAS.

00:01:38.866 --> 00:01:41.000
AND I SAID,
"YOUR CAR'S ON FIRE."

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.000
AND HE'S LIKE...

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.433
JUST STARING AT ME.

00:01:43.433 --> 00:01:46.366
I WAS LIKE, "UH,
I'M GONNA HAVE TO GET YOU OUT."

00:01:46.366 --> 00:01:48.733
AND I TRIED TO OPEN THE DOOR,
AND THE DOOR WASN'T OPENING,

00:01:48.733 --> 00:01:51.166
SO I'M LIKE, "I'M GONNA HAVE TO
GET YOU OUT THROUGH THE WINDOW."

00:01:51.166 --> 00:01:53.433
AND HE JUST THREW HIS ARMS OUT,
AND JUST DRAGGED HIM OUT.

00:01:53.433 --> 00:01:55.466
- BUT THAT'S LIKE--
LIKE JUST DEAD WEIGHT,

00:01:55.466 --> 00:01:57.100
BECAUSE HE WASN'T REALLY MOVING,

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.133
SO YOU HAD TO LIFT HIM
OUT AND OVER THAT DOOR, RIGHT?

00:02:00.133 --> 00:02:01.333
- CORRECT, YEAH.
HE WAS HEAVY.

00:02:01.333 --> 00:02:03.266
- WOW, YEAH.
[laughter]

00:02:03.266 --> 00:02:04.500
IT'S ALL MUSCLE.

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.333
THAT'S WHAT--
IT'S ALL SOLID MUSCLE.

00:02:06.333 --> 00:02:07.800
SO, YEAH,

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:09.733
THAT'S REALLY IMPRESSIVE
THAT YOU COULD DO THAT.

00:02:09.733 --> 00:02:11.900
AND OBVIOUSLY, YOUR TRAINING
AS A FIREFIGHTER

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:13.566
COMES IN HANDY RIGHT THERE TOO.

00:02:13.566 --> 00:02:15.966
- YEAH, SOMEWHAT IT DOES,
KIND OF,

00:02:15.966 --> 00:02:20.033
BUT MORE OR LESS, THE INSTINCT
TO GO AND HELP SOMEBODY

00:02:20.033 --> 00:02:21.200
WAS FROM MY DAD.

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:23.700
HE PASSED AWAY TWO MONTHS AGO.

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:25.400
AND HE GAVE ME--

00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.033
HE INSPIRED ME
TO DO GREAT THINGS.

00:02:28.033 --> 00:02:29.233
HIS FAMOUS SAYING TO ME WAS,

00:02:29.233 --> 00:02:30.700
"IF SOMEONE NEEDS HELP,
HELP 'EM.

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.500
"DON'T MATTER
WHAT THEIR CIRCUMSTANCES ARE.

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:34.200
"IF YOU HAVE $10,

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.233
"AND A GUY ON THE STREET
WHO NEEDS HELP

00:02:36.233 --> 00:02:37.600
NEEDED $10,
GIVE IT TO 'EM."

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:39.533
AND THAT'S SOMETHING--
EXACTLY WHAT HE WOULD DO.

00:02:39.533 --> 00:02:41.466
SO I--HE TAKES--
HE INSPIRED ME.

00:02:41.466 --> 00:02:42.900
- HE SOUNDS LIKE A GREAT MAN.
- HE WAS.

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:43.900
- I'M SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS.

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:45.000
AND YOU'RE A GOOD GUY, JOE.

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.166
- THANK YOU.

00:02:46.166 --> 00:02:47.500
- FIRST OF ALL,
WHAT HAPPENED TO--

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:48.866
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?
WHAT'S--

00:02:48.866 --> 00:02:50.766
- THE LEG, IT'S--
YOU KNOW, IT'S STILL BANGED UP.

00:02:50.766 --> 00:02:53.933
I STILL HAVE TESTS AND DOCTORS
I HAVE TO GO SEE ABOUT IT.

00:02:53.933 --> 00:02:56.000
I'M JUST--
I'M LUCKY THAT JOE WAS THERE,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:58.300
'CAUSE OTHERWISE, I'D STILL
BE SITTING IN THAT CAR, AND...

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:00.066
- BECAUSE, I THINK,
AFTER YOU GOT HIM OUT,

00:03:00.066 --> 00:03:03.233
IT KIND OF--THE WHOLE CAR
CAUGHT FIRE, RIGHT?

00:03:03.233 --> 00:03:04.733
- WITHIN A MINUTE, YEAH.

00:03:04.733 --> 00:03:06.100
- CRAZY.
- JUST LIKE IN THAT VIDEO.

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:09.133
I MEAN, THAT VIDEO WAS--
OH, I'D SAY TWO MINUTES AFTER

00:03:09.133 --> 00:03:10.566
WHEN THE FIRE DEPARTMENT
GOT THERE.

00:03:10.566 --> 00:03:12.600
BUT IT WAS BURNING FOR A GOOD--
- SO HE SAVED YOUR LIFE.

00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:13.833
- ABSOLUTELY.
- THIS GUY.

00:03:13.833 --> 00:03:15.166
- THERE'S NOTHING LEFT
OF THE CAR.

00:03:15.166 --> 00:03:17.033
- AND YOU'RE PALS NOW, RIGHT?
- ABSOLUTELY.

00:03:17.033 --> 00:03:18.866
- WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO
AFTER YOU GRADUATE?

00:03:18.866 --> 00:03:20.466
- I'M MORE OR LESS
THINKING ABOUT

00:03:20.466 --> 00:03:22.333
THE MILITARY SERVICE
RIGHT OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL.

00:03:22.333 --> 00:03:24.766
I DON'T KNOW WHICH BRANCH YET,
BUT--

00:03:24.766 --> 00:03:27.033
AND THEN AFTER THE MILITARY
SERVICE, I WAS THINKING ABOUT

00:03:27.033 --> 00:03:28.533
A FIREFIGHTER
OR A POLICE OFFICER.

00:03:28.533 --> 00:03:29.866
- WE CAN'T LEGALLY GIVE YOU
A GIFT.

00:03:29.866 --> 00:03:30.866
- THAT'S CORRECT.

00:03:30.866 --> 00:03:33.000
- WE CAN'T DO THAT BECAUSE
YOU'RE AN OFFICER OF THE LAW.

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.400
I DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT LAW,
BUT--

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:36.200
YOU KNOW, SEEMS LIKE
WHEN YOU DO SOMETHING,

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:37.400
AND YOU WANT TO HELP SOMEBODY--

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:38.833
YOUR GIRLFRIEND'S
IN THE AUDIENCE,

00:03:38.833 --> 00:03:41.933
AND SHE MUST BE EXHAUSTED
FROM TAKING CARE OF YOU

00:03:41.933 --> 00:03:42.933
ALL THE TIME AND...

00:03:42.933 --> 00:03:44.033
- YEP.

00:03:44.033 --> 00:03:46.233
[cheers and applause]

00:03:46.233 --> 00:03:47.300
- HI.

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:51.100
SO BECAUSE
I THINK SHE'S EXHAUSTED

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:52.633
FROM TAKING CARE OF YOU...
- PROBABLY.

00:03:52.633 --> 00:03:54.233
- SHE DESERVES A VACATION.
- ABSOLUTELY.

00:03:54.233 --> 00:03:56.100
- SO SHE'S GONNA GET
A SIX-NIGHT STAY FOR TWO

00:03:56.100 --> 00:03:58.733
AT THE CEBLUE VILLAS
AND BEACH RESORT IN ANGUILLA.

00:03:58.733 --> 00:04:00.966
SHE'LL STAY IN
A THREE-BEDROOM VILLA

00:04:00.966 --> 00:04:01.966
WITH ITS OWN POOL.

00:04:01.966 --> 00:04:02.966
SHE'S GONNA HAVE A PICNIC

00:04:02.966 --> 00:04:03.966
ON A PRIVATE ISLAND.

00:04:03.966 --> 00:04:05.333
[laughter]

00:04:05.333 --> 00:04:07.866
AND SHE'S GONNA GET
A COUPLE'S MASSAGE, SO...

00:04:07.866 --> 00:04:09.000
[laughter]

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.466
I DON'T KNOW WHO
SHE'S GONNA BRING...

00:04:10.466 --> 00:04:12.466
- YOU COULD TAKE ME.
- BUT THAT'S WHERE SHE'S GOING.

00:04:12.466 --> 00:04:15.933
[cheers and applause]

00:04:15.933 --> 00:04:18.000
ALL RIGHT.

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.200
YOU COULD BRING--
YOU COULD BRING JOE.

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:23.400
JOE, WE HEARD THAT YOU RIDE
YOUR BICYCLE TO WORK A LOT,

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:25.766
BUT YOUR BIKE HAS A FLAT, SO--

00:04:25.766 --> 00:04:26.900
IT ALWAYS HAS A FLAT TIRE,

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:28.300
SO WE GOT YOU A NEW BIKE

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:29.833
RIGHT HERE, AND...

00:04:29.833 --> 00:04:33.000
[cheers and applause]

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:35.600
[both laugh]
- YES. YES.

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:37.133
- THAT'S AWESOME.

00:04:37.133 --> 00:04:38.900
- AND...
- I LIKE IT.

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:40.700
- WE KNOW THAT WHEN
YOU AREN'T WORKING

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:42.966
AS A VOLUNTEER FIREFIGHTER,
YOU LIKE TO PLAY VIDEO GAMES,

00:04:42.966 --> 00:04:44.500
SO WE'RE GONNA GIVE YOU
THIS BRAND-NEW

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:46.366
ENTERTAINMENT SYSTEM OVER HERE.

00:04:46.366 --> 00:04:49.033
[cheers and applause]

00:04:49.033 --> 00:04:50.033
- A PS4.

00:04:50.033 --> 00:04:51.766
- [laughing]

00:04:51.766 --> 00:04:54.133
OH, [bleep].
YOU GOT BOTH, MAN.

00:04:54.133 --> 00:04:55.800
CONGRATULATIONS.
