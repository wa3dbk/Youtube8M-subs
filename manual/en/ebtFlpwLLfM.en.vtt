00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:05.790
Upin! Ipin! Where do you think you're going?

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.440
Hurry, Upin! We're going to be late!

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:11.500
Whoa!

00:00:24.970 --> 00:00:28.270
Heartwarming Lessons.
Part 1.

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:35.750
Opah! Opah!

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:37.370
We got it!

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:42.210
Here.
- Thank you.

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.120
Are you going to make porridge?

00:00:45.648 --> 00:00:46.659
No.

00:00:49.529 --> 00:00:53.562
Then what are you going to do
with all those beans?

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:56.780
I'm going to make putu kacang.

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:58.930
Pu... putu?

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:03.340
Yes. It's a type of cookie
people used to eat back then.

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:06.150
I don't think you've tasted it.

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:07.680
Oh...

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:09.430
Is it yummy?

00:01:09.430 --> 00:01:11.110
Yummy like fried chicken?

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:13.230
Chicken, chicken.

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:14.590
It's a cookie!

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:15.980
Come on, Kak.

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:17.710
We're just asking.

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:19.260
Busy body.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:21.860
Ipin, let's go play!
- Okay!

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.550
Playing can wait.
Come help me first.

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.680
With what?

00:01:31.155 --> 00:01:34.572
Move that mat. And be quick.

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:43.820
Piece of cake!
- That's right.

00:01:44.465 --> 00:01:46.104
Hmph, show-off.

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.290
Ipin, catch it!
- All right!

00:01:56.290 --> 00:01:58.690
Come on, come on!
- Hurry!

00:01:58.690 --> 00:01:59.850
Upin! Ipin!

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:01.710
Where do you think you're going?

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:04.300
Come here.

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:05.630
Don't you dare run away.

00:02:06.089 --> 00:02:07.651
Aww...

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:11.330
What now, Kak?

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:13.770
Go get that stone.

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.250
What are you waiting for? Hurry up.

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:22.330
That's it? It's just a stone.

00:02:24.441 --> 00:02:26.049
Where do we put it?

00:02:26.049 --> 00:02:28.159
Over here.

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:37.110
Just a bit more, Ipin!

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:40.830
Come on, you can do it.

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:45.120
That looks heavy.

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.500
Want some help?

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:48.170
It's okay, Kak!

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:49.600
This is...

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:53.140
... a man's job!

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:56.130
Yes, yes... yes!

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:01.970
What is that thing?

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:03.640
It's so heavy!

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.910
But I thought you're a man!

00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:09.160
Watch me do it.

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:13.150
Piece of cake!

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:16.110
That's a small one!

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:17.660
Yes, yes, yes!

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:20.680
That's not fair!
- You are both strong and hardworking.

00:03:21.220 --> 00:03:24.498
That machine is called a grinding stone.

00:03:24.498 --> 00:03:28.287
People used to make flour with it.

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:31.510
But you always buy flour from the shop.

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:33.150
I know.

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:38.340
But if you make it yourself,
the cookies taste better!

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:39.760
Oh...

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:42.410
They don't care what they taste like, Opah.

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:45.430
If you give them sticks and stones,
they'll still eat them.

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:48.890
Of course we care!

00:03:48.890 --> 00:03:49.480
Opah's cooking is yummy!

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:51.430
Not like yours!

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:52.960
Yes, yes, yes!

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:55.320
Fine, then!

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:57.430
I'm not making fried chicken anymore!

00:03:57.430 --> 00:03:58.480
That's enough.

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:00.130
Come here and help me.

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:09.600
Upin, take a spoon
and scoop some beans into that hole.

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:11.670
A little at a time.

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:15.840
What about me?

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:18.530
You can collect the flour.

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:22.390
Don't spill, Upin!

00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:26.330
Then, turn it this way.

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:30.770
Wow, it turns into flour!

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:40.800
Opah, let us do it!

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.440
Yes, yes, yes.

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:44.550
You can rest, Opah.

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:45.580
It's all right.

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:47.800
I'm not tired yet.

00:04:57.170 --> 00:04:58.370
Here, Opah.

00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:02.330
That should be enough.

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:04.680
There's still some more, Opah!

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:06.790
Why don't you finish it?

00:05:06.790 --> 00:05:08.830
I'll do my prayers for a while.

00:05:10.710 --> 00:05:12.300
Yay!

00:05:12.933 --> 00:05:13.728
Let's go!

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:19.290
Round and round!

00:05:30.046 --> 00:05:30.981
Yay!

00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:58.740
You naughty kids!

00:06:01.063 --> 00:06:02.661
What happened over here!

00:06:02.661 --> 00:06:03.692
Clean up this mess!

00:06:03.692 --> 00:06:05.775
What are you screaming about, Ros?

00:06:05.775 --> 00:06:08.008
Opah, look what they did!

00:06:08.008 --> 00:06:09.445
Everything's a mess!

00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:13.330
Having fun, you two?

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:15.360
Go take a shower now.

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:17.910
Let's go.
- Who's cleaning this mess?

00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:19.480
You, of course!

00:06:23.167 --> 00:06:25.916
Hurry, hurry! First one in is the winner!
- Me first! Me first!

00:06:25.916 --> 00:06:28.617
Yay! Shower! Shower!

00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:34.240
To be continued...
