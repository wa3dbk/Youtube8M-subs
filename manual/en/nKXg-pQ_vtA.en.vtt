00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:03.260
Hi everyone! Welcome to Keith's Toy Box.

00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:08.900
Today's surprise toy will help us sell and repair cars with our own showroom and garage.

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:10.320
Can you guess what it is?

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:21.460
It's the Tomica Honda Cars showroom play set by Takara Tomy from their Tomica Town series.

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:26.740
This play set is available at Amazon for about $45.

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:41.260
It comes with a rotating car display,

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:45.600
a sales office with sliding doors,

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:49.680
a backdoor that leads to the office and showroom,

00:00:50.660 --> 00:00:52.620
and a garage that can launch cars.

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:59.780
And there are many ways to layout parts of of the building.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.640
The cars and batteries are not included

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:04.720
Now let's open the box and take a look.

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:28.500
So these are all the pieces that came with the set.

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.360
Now let's put it all together.

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:54.520
There it is.

00:01:54.868 --> 00:01:56.368
Doesn't it look really nice?

00:01:56.900 --> 00:01:59.840
Just like a miniature Honda cars showroom.

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:02.300
Now let's turn on the car display.

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:05.540
It's turning right there.

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.500
All we need is to put in a car.

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:12.220
Here are the sliding doors to the sales office.

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:16.500
Neat!

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.600
And here's the garage that can launch cars.

00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:37.060
Now let's put a car into the display.

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:54.620
Nice!

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.600
Here's our Honda cars salesman.

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:24.480
These grooves help the figure to stand.

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:45.660
Let's try to launch some cars in the garage.

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:00.720
Vroom

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:04.900
Now let's try it with some very special cars.

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:09.680
The Batmobile and Lightning McQueen.

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:22.140
Let's try that again.

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.460
Oh! Here comes a customer.

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:58.720
Maybe he needs to have his car repaired.

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:00.560
Let's go check.

00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:26.120
hmmm let's see

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:29.320
Looks like the fan belt is broken. Let's replace it.

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:33.560
There you go.

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:34.460
Easy!

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:36.060
You're all done.

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:37.160
Ready to go!

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:43.360
Now let's try laying out the building another way.

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:03.220
This little door leads to the back of the office.

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:06.120
It's big enough for the salesman to go through.

00:06:13.740 --> 00:06:15.640
Now let's try yet another layout.

00:06:28.264 --> 00:06:31.724
This one is like a corner layout with a garage at the back.

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:44.100
So that's the Tomica Honda cars showroom play set by Takara Tomy from the Tomica Town series.

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:47.620
