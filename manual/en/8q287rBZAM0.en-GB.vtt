Hi Food Tubers I'm Alex, the French guy cooking and today we're making an all time French classic,

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.060
the Moules Marinière, known as mussels in marinière sauce.

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:19.020
Fresh seafood in a buttery white wine and shallot sauce.

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:25.060
So it's tasty, it's cheap, it's easy and it's a French dish that you can make in under 10 minutes.

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:27.300
Come on guys, let's do it.

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.520
First up, grab a few shallots and dice them roughly,

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:40.640
bash two cloves of garlic.

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:44.760
Pick up a small bunch of parsley and a stalk of celery.

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:48.260
For both, separate the leaves from the stalks.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:56.440
We use the fine and tender leaves in the dish but the stalks will pimp and pump up the flavours of a bunch of dried herbs.

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:02.160
So I guess that's it for the 'mise en place',

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:02.900
mise en place?

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:06.960
Yes, mise en place is just a fancy French word for preparation.

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.740
But you know it's always good to insert a fancy French word into a cooking conversation

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:16.780
Well I was touche by the chef's mise en place in the cafe but it felt like deja vu.

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:19.340
Yes, maybe that's too much.

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.540
Now we need some mussels and I think this seafood is quite amazing.

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:29.000
It's cheap, delicious, versatile and on top of that it's sustainable.

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:31.700
Use about a kilo of mussels for two people.

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.580
Start by rinsing them under running, cold water,

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.340
give them a good scrub and remove any dirt or fibres.

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:45.660
Very important, discard the broken ones and also the ones that will not close when lightly squeezed.

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:52.340
In a large casserole pan, over a medium heat, add a good knob of butter, I mean a serious one.

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:58.300
Infusing the bunch of dried herbs inside the butter will ensure better distribution of the aromas at the end.

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:02.260
Drop in the shallots and the garlic and cook them until they get soft.

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:11.980
After a few minutes, pour in a good amount of fresh and acidic white wine like Muscadet or Sauvignon or whatever wine you like.

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:15.940
Season well with salt and pepper and let the wine evaporate a bit.

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.220
So the amount of wine in this recipe is totally up to you,

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:28.060
I am using half a bottle of it because I like it and also because I want to spare some glasses for the meal.

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.780
You can use beer instead or you can use apple cider as well

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:36.620
or if you don't want to use alcohol you can use a pint of vegetable stock and a drizzle of vinegar

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:43.200
and the dish will still be amazing. I'm telling you French cooking is not cast in stone.

00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:46.280
What's important is that you own it.

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.100
Place the mussels in along with the celery leaves,

00:02:51.773 --> 00:02:55.393
cook them covered for about 5 minutes, stirring once or twice.

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:02.460
When they open nicely they are ready to go, just discard the closed ones.

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:09.460
It might not be in the classic mussels marinière recipe but I like to add a dash of double cream in mine.

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:14.440
You know, just to make it a bit more naughty and also, because I own it.

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:19.480
Sprinkle that with parsley and stir well to combine all those lovely ingredients together.

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:27.100
The flavours are intense and perfectly balanced but the shallots bring a deep richness.

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:31.140
Yet the white wine and the herbs bring a much appreciated freshness.

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:34.900
Serve them as they are or with french fries on the side.

00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:44.460
So guys, that's it. I told you this recipe is nothing difficult and considering the amazing result at the end you should definitely give it a try.

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:52.520
