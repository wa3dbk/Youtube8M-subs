00:00:05.629 --> 00:00:08.480
Darwin is the capital of the Northern Territory,

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:12.320
in a place Australian’s like call, “The
Top End”.

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:17.240
Situated at the edge of the Timor Sea, the
city is closer to Bali

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:24.240
than to Australia’s other major capitals.

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:32.169
Traditionally the home of the Larrakia People,

00:00:32.169 --> 00:00:36.030
Darwin was settled by Europeans in 1869.

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.760
The city’s isolation has meant that it’s
population has always been low,

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:44.210
and that’s just the way locals like it.

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:49.460
Darwin is very much a gateway city. It’s
the gateway to wild outback adventures,

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:51.900
…it’s the gateway to the Aboriginal Dreamtime,

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:57.220
…and, it’s the gateway to a relaxed state
of mind that you can only appreciate once

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:58.320
you’re here.

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.000
On Thursdays and Sundays, half the city gathers
at the Mindil Beach Markets. Here,

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.030
the aroma’s of cuisines from all over the
world mix together under the tropical sky,

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:18.030
creating the perfect essence of todays multicultural
Darwin. At sunset,

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:24.689
head down to the beach for the best show in
town, as the sun dips into the Arafura Sea.

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:29.049
Then catch a double feature under the stars
at another local institution,

00:01:29.049 --> 00:01:32.789
the Deck Chair Cinema.

00:01:32.789 --> 00:01:36.009
But life here hasn’t always been this easy
going.

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:42.189
During The Second World War, Japanese warplanes
dropped more bombs on Darwin than on Pearl Harbor.

00:01:42.189 --> 00:01:47.770
You can learn more about and those dark days,
and about the city’s ongoing military significance,

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:54.770
at the Defense of Darwin Experience, and the
Australian Aviation Heritage Centre.

00:01:56.829 --> 00:01:59.060
At the Darwin Museum and Art Gallery,

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.939
learn how Darwin was tragically flattened
again in 1974,

00:02:03.939 --> 00:02:10.289
this time by Mother Nature. The Museum and
Art Gallery is also the perfect introduction

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:12.030
into local cultures,

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.040
and the Territory’s unique natural environment.
While you’re here,

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:21.560
say hello to Sweetheart, a rogue croc that
developed a taste for small aluminum boats

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.330
before he was finally caught.

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.500
Sweetheart’s much quieter these days,

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:32.390
but you can still experience the awesome power
of Australia’s salt and freshwater crocs

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:34.140
at Crocodylus Park.

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:39.330
Just a fifteen-minute drive from Darwin, the
park is home to over 1000 crocs,

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:45.560
from hatchlings to adults weighing over half
a tone. But to get close,

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:50.860
real close, make tracks to Crocosaurus Cove,
right in the heart of the city. 

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:52.860
Have a go at feeding the crocs,

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:59.170
or better still, climb into the Cage of Death
and be lowered into a tank

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:03.530
with some of the largest captive salties on
the planet.

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:13.480
Of course, seeing crocs in captivity is just
a little Top-End taster.

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:17.100
For the best holiday snaps of all, hit the
road to adventure.

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:23.450
There’s over 60 national parks in the Northern
Territory; 20 in the Darwin region alone.

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:25.070
If you ask a local for their favorite,

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:30.310
chances are they’ll quietly point you in
the direction of Litchfield National Park.

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:32.090
Just an hour and a half from Darwin,

00:03:32.090 --> 00:03:36.410
Litchfield is set around a sandstone plateau,
criss-crossed by deep,

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:41.980
narrow gorges filled monsoon forests and croc-free
swimming holes.

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:47.710
On your way into the park, stop to check out
the Magnetic and Cathedral termite mounds.

00:03:47.710 --> 00:03:52.070
And when it’s time to cool off , immerse
yourself in the pure refreshing waters of

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:53.300
Buley Rockhole,

00:03:53.300 --> 00:04:00.300
a series of pools which cascade down the hillside
to spectacular Florence Falls.

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:10.600
A little further into the park, are Tolmer
and Wangi Falls. Step into the primordial

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:14.580
waters and let your worries float away,

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:26.480
then climb into the stone country above, and
let your spirit drift off into a land that time forgot.

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:33.970
But if you want to step further back in time,
into a place the Australia’s aboriginal

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:36.389
People know as the Dreamtime,

00:04:36.389 --> 00:04:41.360
head to Kakadu. Half the size of Switzerland
and home to one-third

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:45.530
of Australia’s bird species and some of
the world’s oldest art galleries,

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:52.530
Kakadu is more than a national park, it’s
a national treasure.

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:02.820
Whether you’ve explored The Outback for
a few days or a few months,

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:07.650
there comes a time where everyone begins to
long for the creature comforts of the city.

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:13.470
And this is where Darwin comes into it’s
own, it’s the perfect gateway back into the world,

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:17.760
and not just any world, but the way the world
should be

00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:24.520
 big hearted, relaxed, and forever connected to the rhythms of nature, and, the human spirit.
