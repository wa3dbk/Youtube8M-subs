Gemma's Bigger Bolder Baking
Pot of Gold French Macarons

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:21.700
Hi Bold Bakers! St. Patrick's Day is almost
here and I wanted to make something really

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:26.310
special for you so in true Bigger Bolder Baking
style, I thought I would show you how to make

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:31.450
gold coin macarons to go into a pot of gold
at the end of a rainbow. Also, today is another

00:00:31.450 --> 00:00:35.790
episode of my Chocolicious series over on
the Kin Community Channel so after this video,

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:39.300
make sure you head over there and see how
to make homemade Bread Pudding for St. Patrick's

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.390
Day. So let's get baking!

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:45.220
Now I've shown you how to make macarons before
in my Jelly Donut Macarons video but I'm going

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:49.850
to show you again because the technique is
the most important part to successful macarons.

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.550
So pay close attention to my tips, and you'll
have great macarons every time.

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.340
So we're going to start in a large bowl. I'm
using porcelain but you can use glass or metal.

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:00.559
But don't use plastic because plastic can
actually contain grease and we want to make

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:02.239
sure there's no grease in our egg whites.

00:01:02.239 --> 00:01:06.910
One of the tips for making successful macarons
is to use room temperature egg whites. I actually

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:11.860
age mine for maybe 24-48 hours and it just
makes them that much better to whip.

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:14.590
Also make sure there's no egg yolk in your
egg whites.

00:01:14.590 --> 00:01:18.250
Now whip up your egg whites until they form
soft peaks. I'm going to use a hand mixer

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:20.390
but you can use a stand mixer as well.

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:23.549
One restaurant that I worked at in San Francisco
actually used to age their egg whites for

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.450
up to a week and it just gave the macarons
better flavor and they whipped really well.

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.100
When your egg whites are nice and frothy and
almost at soft peaks, now is a good time to

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.869
add in your sugar. Add your sugar bit by bit
until it's all incorporated.

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:39.290
Ok. Perfect. This is what your meringue should
look like. Nice and stiff. Now to this, we're

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:42.939
going to add in yellow food coloring because
remember we're making gold coin macarons.

00:01:42.939 --> 00:01:46.360
And I'm also going to add in some lemon zest
because it's almost the spring and that's

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:48.570
a really great flavor for this time of year.

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:52.400
And then turn on your beater again and mix
in the color and the lemon zest. It's best

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:55.869
if you use gel colors because it's a more
concentrated color and you use less.

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:59.630
To this mix, we're going to sieve in our icing
sugar and our almond meal. And the reason

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.750
we do this is because we want to make sure
that the mix is really fine and get out any

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:06.259
lumps that might be in the almonds. If you
have any almonds left in your sieve, then

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:09.540
you can save this and use it for a different
recipe but don't use it in your macarons because

00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:10.899
it's too big and coarse.

00:02:10.899 --> 00:02:14.750
Now this is the most important part about
macaron making and it's the mixing. So my

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:20.860
tip to you is go slow, concentrate and count
your mixes and you shouldn't go wrong.

00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:25.799
Just go around the bowl and continuously and
gently fold in all of your mix. I like to

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:34.479
go in the same direction. Five. Ten. Fifteen.
Ok as you can see, it's really thick and it's

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:38.799
starting to come together. What we're going
for is like a thick lava-type batter and you'll

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:44.459
get that around maybe 35-40 mixes. It really
depends. I know this is a lot of work for

00:02:44.459 --> 00:02:49.400
a little cookie but when you have success,
it's all worth it. Twenty eight. You're seeing

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.910
it start to loosen up a little bit and get
a little bit shiny. Ok. So I'm at 30 mixes.

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:58.000
I'm going to slow down now and concentrate
and make sure I don't go over the line of

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.870
what I want in my batter. Thirty four. We're
almost there. You can see it's a nice and

00:03:02.870 --> 00:03:07.780
smooth batter. It's nice and shiny and it's
starting to get loose but it's still thick.

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:14.780
Thirty Nine. Forty. And look at that. You
can tell when it's done because it falls really

00:03:14.780 --> 00:03:19.520
slowly off your spatula and then when it lands
in the batter, it takes a little while to

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:23.970
disappear. This took me forty stirs. The last
time it took me thirty seven. Just keep a

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:27.560
close eye on it and you know what, practice
makes perfect. You never get it right the

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.769
first time and if you do then well done.

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:34.389
Now we're going to transfer this batter into
a piping bag with a nozzle of 1/2 inch wide.

00:03:34.389 --> 00:03:37.430
I like to use this template so I can get a
good shape on my macarons and I'm going to

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:40.579
put a link in the description box below so
you guys can have it too. When baking your

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:44.299
macarons, make sure you use a good quality,
thick baking pan so they don't overcook on

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:48.530
the bottom. Then line this with some parchment
paper. And then place your stencil underneath

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:51.560
the parchment paper so you can pipe directly
on it.

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:56.430
And then slowly pipe on your macarons. Pipe
smaller than the circles so you give it room

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:59.449
to spread. I might have piped mine a little
too big but they should be ok.

00:03:59.449 --> 00:04:03.590
When your macarons are piped, here's a trick
that always forget and it's banging your tray

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:08.049
against the countertop to get out any air
bubbles. Just give it one or two quick bangs.

00:04:08.049 --> 00:04:12.119
Our next important step is letting the macarons
dry out at room temperature for around 30-40 minutes

00:04:12.119 --> 00:04:16.680
until the top of them kind of
dries out and doing this will create those

00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:20.570
lovely little feet that they have on beautiful
macarons. You want to be careful that you

00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:24.290
don't leave these to rest in a humid room
because macarons do not like humidity so put

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:25.820
them in another room if you have to.

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:29.340
It's been around 40 minutes and our macarons
are nice and dry to the touch so now it's

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:30.669
time for the oven.

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:34.789
Before baking your macarons, pipe a dollar
sign, Euro symbol or whatever you like on

00:04:34.789 --> 00:04:37.300
top to make these gold coins even better.

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:42.379
Bake your macarons at 300 degrees F for around
15-20 minutes or until they dry out.

00:04:42.379 --> 00:04:45.669
If you're enjoying this recipe, then don't
forget to subscribe to my channel for a new

00:04:45.669 --> 00:04:47.169
video every Thursday.

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:51.330
Our macarons are out of the oven and they
look amazing. I have to admit, I was a little

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:54.419
bit worried and thought I ruined them but
I looked in the oven and they were lovely

00:04:54.419 --> 00:04:58.659
and puffy and they have their little feet.
Also our dollar signs came out awesome. I'm

00:04:58.659 --> 00:04:59.479
so happy with that.

00:04:59.479 --> 00:05:02.370
So we're going to let these guys go totally
cold and then we're going to get ready to

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:03.610
decorate them.

00:05:03.610 --> 00:05:06.840
To make the macarons look like real gold coins,
I'm actually going to dust them in an edible

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:10.210
gold powder. It just gives them a beautiful
shiny effect.

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:14.039
Dip your brush in a little bit of water. Make
sure it doesn't get too wet. Then dip it in

00:05:14.039 --> 00:05:19.590
your gold powder. And then generously dust
all over your macaron. To make them really

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:23.949
gold, let this layer dry and then go back
and do another layer on top. Look at that,

00:05:23.949 --> 00:05:26.020
it's well worthwhile doing this step.

00:05:26.020 --> 00:05:28.699
I know what you're thinking that I should
have made something green for St. Patrick's

00:05:28.699 --> 00:05:32.389
Day but you know what, in Ireland we don't
eat anything green for St. Patrick's Day and

00:05:32.389 --> 00:05:36.699
I think these are really cute and such a fun
idea. Now here's my favorite part, where we

00:05:36.699 --> 00:05:40.310
get to transform this little cookie into a beautiful
St. Patrick's Day treat.

00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:43.620
I'm going to fill mine with some lemon curd
and I made this in a previous video for lemon

00:05:43.620 --> 00:05:46.030
meringue pie. It's really easy to make
and it's delicious.

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:51.159
And I'm also going to add some mascarpone
cheese. These two really complement each other

00:05:51.159 --> 00:05:53.169
and I think it's going to go lovely with the
lemon macaron.

00:05:53.169 --> 00:05:58.639
To fill your macaron, pipe a line of mascarpone
around the edges. If you don't like mascarpone,

00:05:58.639 --> 00:06:00.340
you can always use buttercream.

00:06:00.340 --> 00:06:04.659
And then for that extra lemon zing, pipe in
your homemade lemon curd in the middle. And

00:06:04.659 --> 00:06:08.490
then place on your top and you have your first
gold coin macaron.

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:12.409
Now continue filling your other macarons.
These may not be traditional Irish treats

00:06:12.409 --> 00:06:14.509
but they sure are BIG &amp; BOLD!

00:06:14.509 --> 00:06:18.180
In Ireland there's a pot of gold at the end
of every rainbow and maybe even a leprechaun.

00:06:18.180 --> 00:06:23.639
I hope you're lucky enough to try these gold
coins and have a great St. Patrick's Day.

00:06:23.639 --> 00:06:25.560
Mmm.

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:28.580
Make sure you head over to the Kin Community
Channel and see how to make White Chocolate

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:31.990
and Raspberry Bread Pudding. Thank you so
much for watching and I'll see you back here

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:37.150
