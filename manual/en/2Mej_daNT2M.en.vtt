00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:09.200
What should I get my girlfriend for her birthday?

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:14.200
If you have her Christmas list, you could
get her something she didn’t get for Christmas.

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:16.120
I don’t have that.

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:20.160
Can you get on her computer long enough to
see her Amazon wish list?

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.670
Then you could get something off of it.

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:25.200
She might not want a Soda Stream from me.

00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:28.720
And diet products will only ensure she’d
hate me.

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:34.610
Fine, you don’t have to get the night cream
and acne cream on her Amazon shopping list.

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:38.340
You could get a book or electronics that she
has on the list.

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.850
What can I do if I can’t see that wish list?

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:43.010
Ask her friends what she wants.

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:44.780
They’ll have a good idea.

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:46.710
I’m afraid to ask.

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:51.579
They seem to have no concept of a budget,
except as a cuss word.

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:55.450
Pity you can’t take a family member’s
way out and give her money.

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:58.149
I feel like I already do that.

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:01.870
You could take her out to somewhere really
special as her birthday present.

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:03.950
The experience is the gift.

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:06.250
I’m afraid I’d blow it.

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:07.350
How?

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:10.700
Taking her to a fancy dinner and movie is
a classic date.

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.490
That’s also a standard date.

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:17.310
So take her to Main Event or Dave and Busters
for a game night with you.

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.140
That’s more a night for the guys than a
girlfriend.

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:24.690
At least you don’t have the need to create
some crappy home made crafts to give to her

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:27.999
for her birthday, as you probably did for
your own mother.

00:01:27.999 --> 00:01:32.429
Well, maybe you could if you were actually
a good craftsman.

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:37.429
Anything I make today is going to be as crappy
as the ones from 20 years ago, though my mother

00:01:37.429 --> 00:01:39.909
still holds onto those.

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:44.659
Take her out on a fancier date than usual
and whisper, “I sold my Xbox games to pay

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:45.689
for this”.

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:48.310
It’s like the Gift of the Magi.

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:49.439
The what?

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:54.009
You sacrificed something you value to give
her that gift of an expensive date, and she’ll

00:01:54.009 --> 00:01:56.240
appreciate it because you gave something up.

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.210
Can I lie and just say that I did?

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:01.779
I don’t actually want to sell my games.
