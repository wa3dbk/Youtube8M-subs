Hi! I’m David Kaynor for expertvillage.com
and I am going to delve into the intricacies

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:16.710
deeper meanings of Twinkle, Twinkle Little
Star. This is one of the most useful learning

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:25.009
pieces I know of, and I believe it’s used
in fairly formalized violin instruction with

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:29.500
small kids who are just starting up, cause
the melody is so easy to hear and remember.

00:00:29.500 --> 00:01:16.240
Now one of the great things about this melody
is that it can be used to teach

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:22.649
using different fingers for different notes
of scale. I just did it starting with an open

00:01:22.649 --> 00:01:31.740
G and I went, G and then D, this time I’m
going to start with my first finger and play

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:52.149
on an A, and then the next note, it’s going
to be an E…and now I’m going to do the

00:01:52.149 --> 00:01:57.420
same tune but I’m going to start with my
third finger in the B flat, so it’s going

00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:37.710
to go B flat, F, G and it can be used on the
other strings starting with different fingers

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:55.120
and I can even be used in other positions
on the fingerboard.

00:02:55.120 --> 00:03:00.430
So if you haven’t used it yet there’s
no time to waste start playing Twinkle, Twinkle

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:02.150
Little Star right now.
