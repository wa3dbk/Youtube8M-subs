00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.180
Today on our 2010 Hyundai Santa Fe we're going
to install the Tow Ready T1 Connector, part

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:06.279
number 118451.

00:00:06.279 --> 00:00:11.340
First, we'll open up the rear cargo door.

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:17.360
Then we're going to remove the storage compartment
door behind both tail lights.

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:20.820
Then were going to remove the storage compartment.

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:33.900
To take out the rear storage compartment there
are three fasteners that will need to be removed.

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:37.079
Now we've got the storage compartment loose,
we're going to go ahead and remove the rear

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:38.079
threshold.

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:44.630
We'll simply get under it with a flat-bladed
screw driver or a trim tool and pop it free.

00:00:44.630 --> 00:00:49.140
Next, we'll remove the cargo hook for each
side.

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.239
Now we have our cargo hooks removed we'll
go ahead and remove the two fasteners at the

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:56.109
bottom or where the corner trim meets the
threshold.

00:00:56.109 --> 00:01:37.460
Now we'll go ahead and pry the trim away from

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:57.070
the 

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:07.840
body of the vehicle.

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:30.349
This will 

00:02:30.349 --> 00:03:16.680
expose the rear 

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:23.579
tail light wiring.
