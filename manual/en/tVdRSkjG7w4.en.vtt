What are you going to cook?
Moong Dal Halwa

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:22.932
Ingredients required to make Moong Dal Halwa

00:00:23.367 --> 00:00:28.219
Green Gram (Moong Dal), Sugar, Milk, Dried Whole Milk (Khova), Ghee

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:36.132
Take a cup of green gram and soak in water overnight

00:00:42.482 --> 00:00:45.769
Grind the soaked green gram into a paste

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:54.130
Take a cup of ghee and twice the amount of sugar for a cup of green gram

00:00:57.401 --> 00:01:13.943
We'll also be using Dried Whole Milk (Khova) and regular 
2% Whole Milk, Cardamom Powder &amp; Dry Fruits

00:01:15.932 --> 00:01:22.406
Firstly, boil the sugar to make a syrup

00:01:27.178 --> 00:01:37.059
Take a pan and heat the ghee

00:01:44.928 --> 00:01:52.387
Add the green gram paste into the ghee

00:01:53.432 --> 00:01:58.338
Keep stirring continuosly to avoid the paste sticking to the pan

00:01:59.341 --> 00:02:09.685
Stir for atleast 30 minutes

00:02:31.296 --> 00:02:37.058
Add the sugar syrup after stirring the green gram paste for 30 - 45 minutes

00:02:38.777 --> 00:02:44.422
This is definitely not for the health conscious

00:03:07.217 --> 00:03:25.106
Add some milk, dried whole milk (khova) and some cardamom powder

00:03:26.379 --> 00:03:30.519
Stir till there are no lumps left and once done, garnish with some dry fruits
