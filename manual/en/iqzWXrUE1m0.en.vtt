00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:01.710
Hey guys.

00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:02.710
Michael here with The Daily Note.

00:00:02.710 --> 00:00:06.840
If you've seen any of my videos, you should
know that I'm a big fan of the Galaxy Note

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:08.080
series of phones.

00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:13.019
When I got my hands on my first Galaxy Note
two years ago, I liked it so much that I created

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:14.840
a YouTube channel around it.

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:17.460
And here we are with more than 70,000 subscribers.

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.369
So here's my wishlist on what I personally
would like to see on the Galaxy Note 4.

00:00:21.369 --> 00:00:25.369
And I'm hoping to hear what you would like
to see on the Note 4 as well because all our

00:00:25.369 --> 00:00:26.829
needs are different.

00:00:26.829 --> 00:00:31.499
And I am absolutely certain that Samung or
at least people that work at Samsung use Social

00:00:31.499 --> 00:00:35.100
Networking sites such as YouTube as a way
of gathering feedback.

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:39.289
So let's add some information to the web and
discuss what features we would like to see

00:00:39.289 --> 00:00:48.930
on the Galaxy Note 4.

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.079
So the first item on my list is display size.

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:54.839
I personally think that the size of the Galaxy
Note 3 is perfect.

00:00:54.839 --> 00:00:59.010
If it was any bigger, maybe it would start
getting a bit hard to carry in the pocket.

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:03.530
So I would love to see Samsung keep the device
size the same, but somehow increase the display

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.590
size by reducing the boarders.

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:10.270
With that said, if they happen to release
a slightly larger device, I wouldn't be surprised

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:14.409
if I initially think that the device is too
big, and then totally get used to carrying

00:01:14.409 --> 00:01:19.100
a larger device in a matter of few hours,
which tends to happen all the time.

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:22.640
Second, what I would like to see, is better
battery life.

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:24.799
Not 100mAh increases.

00:01:24.799 --> 00:01:27.549
But I'm talking about significant increases.

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:31.189
Sure the Note 3 will go for a day and a half
on mild use.

00:01:31.189 --> 00:01:35.700
But sometimes, you just want to use that battery
hogging app in full brightness and for hours

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:36.909
at a time.

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:41.490
And we all know how quickly the battery drains
when we use our devices like that.

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.409
So I would love to see battery life, at least
double or even triple of what it is now.

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:50.070
Maybe they can make a battery door with 2
extra batteries built in for people who don't

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:51.770
mind the extra weight and thickness.

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:56.950
Or people can opt to use such an accessory
on special days only when they think they

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:57.950
need it.

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:03.530
Third, I wish to see the AOSP-based web browser
that we say on the Galaxy Note 2, which wasn't

00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:04.790
on the Note 3.

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:09.270
Right now, the best browser available for
the Note 3 is Dolphin browser.

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.470
And although I've gotten used to it, the browser
on the Note 2 is still better in many ways,

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.190
especially when you enable this feature.

00:02:16.190 --> 00:02:21.890
You can see this browser on the Note 2 is
running on Android 4.4 and it works flawlessly.

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:24.730
I would love to see this again on the Note
4.

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:28.530
Next, the ability to capture raw data from
the camera.

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:33.080
I originally thought this feature was a bit
of a stretch, but it turns out that Android

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.160
L will support this.

00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.710
And considering that the Note 4 will almost
certainly come with the latest OS, this may

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:42.090
be entirely possible.

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.940
And this for me, is a must have feature.

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:47.790
There are many advantages to shooting in RAW.

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:51.240
Accurate re-white balancing during post processing.

00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:54.480
Highlight and shadow recovery and more dynamic
range.

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:58.380
Next, similar to capturing raw images, but
this time with video.

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:03.330
And I really think the 4K video is superb,
especially on the new Galaxy S5 that lets

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:04.930
you shoot HDR video.

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:09.000
And I think the quality would be good enough
for professional use if they are willing to

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.670
make some minor changes.

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:17.730
Currently, it's capturing 4K video at 50mbits/sec
and that bitrate is too low to keep up when

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:19.900
there is a lot of movement on the screen.

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:25.260
So why not give us the option to select something
like 100mbits/sec for 4K video and let the

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.870
user worry about the file size?

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:30.950
High bitrate video in the right hands is very
valuable.

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:37.360
Other settings that are a must is the ability
shoot 24p at 4K, also manual controls for

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:42.310
shutter speed , ISO, and aperture are an absolute
requirement as well.

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:46.620
As a matter of fact, there's a known mod or
hack for rooted users that lets you record

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:52.330
4k video at 100mbits/sec, and these changes
may be entirely possible if Samsung is willing

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:55.750
to give their users the right options in the
camera app.

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:00.890
Next item on my wishlist is Google Chromecast
compatibility of Samsung apps.

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:06.170
Before Chromecast, there was AllShare cast
with the same functionality of ChromeCast

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:09.400
but it was never a huge seller like chromecast.

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:13.960
And now that Chromecast offers basically the
same type of functionality, there is even

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:18.810
less of a reason to buy an AllShare cast that
costs double the price and has very little

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:20.579
3rd party support.

00:04:20.579 --> 00:04:25.040
So Samsung should re-evaluate whether they
want to continue to only support a small number

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:29.120
of people who've bought an allshare cast,
or whether they should let their stock apps

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:30.939
support streaming to chromecast.

00:04:30.939 --> 00:04:34.909
It would definitely be a nice feature to gain
for all Samsung Galaxy users .

00:04:34.909 --> 00:04:40.110
Next, I would like the option to choose my
voice assistant such as S Voice or Google

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:43.280
Now as a sole voice assistant on the Note
4.

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:47.439
Looking at both S Voice and Google Now, it
is very redundant.

00:04:47.439 --> 00:04:50.819
Sure there are a few things that S Voice can
do that Google Now can't.

00:04:50.819 --> 00:04:53.800
But overall, Google Now seems to be the future.

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:58.430
It is clear that Google is willing to spend
way more resources developing a voice assistant

00:04:58.430 --> 00:05:02.050
further than Samsung would ever be interested
in doing.

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:07.039
So S Voice, I know it had a descent run, but
I would like to see the Galaxy Note 4 optionally

00:05:07.039 --> 00:05:11.750
but also fully support Google Now the way
it was meant to be used rather than S Voice

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:14.610
being in the way without the option to change
it.

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:19.110
Next on the wishlist is option for bigger
internal storage.

00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:24.300
I have a 32GB Galaxy Note 3, and there have
been times when I had to make a decision to

00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:27.310
uninstall an app for the sole purpose of freeing
up space.

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:31.790
And really, is that a decision that I need
to be making in 2014?

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:34.990
Solid state storage is incredibly cheap these
days.

00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:40.939
And whatever the reason it was for not having
64GB Galaxy Note 3, I hope Samsung can offer

00:05:40.939 --> 00:05:44.659
higher capacity devices for the Note 4.

00:05:44.659 --> 00:05:49.430
Considering Google is making it ever so harder
to actually use an external storage card,

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:53.999
and demanding more of the internal storage
for the OS, we're going to need that extra

00:05:53.999 --> 00:05:55.830
space.

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:57.889
And finally, here's a fun one.

00:05:57.889 --> 00:06:00.240
An S Pen, that doubles as a kickstand.

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:05.449
I'm not sure if the S Pen on the Note 3 was
purposely made this way, it probably was not,

00:06:05.449 --> 00:06:09.810
but a lot of people have figured out you can
kinda use it as a kickstand, but it is still

00:06:09.810 --> 00:06:11.849
way too unstable in my opinion.

00:06:11.849 --> 00:06:16.189
So I hope Samsung designs the S Pen so that
it can do this officially in a more sturdy

00:06:16.189 --> 00:06:21.400
way because it's a feature that I would probably
use every single day.

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:22.400
And we're done.

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:25.909
So that's my wish list of what I would love
to see on the Galaxy Note 4.

00:06:25.909 --> 00:06:28.969
What do you want to see on the Note 4 that
would be a must have feature?

00:06:28.969 --> 00:06:30.639
Please share that in the comments.

00:06:30.639 --> 00:06:33.439
And if you appreciate this video, please like
and share it.

00:06:33.439 --> 00:06:34.800
And as always thank you for watching.
