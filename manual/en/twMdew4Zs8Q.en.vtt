00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:12.540
Let's multiply 9 times 8,085.

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.640
That should be a pretty fun
little calculation to do.

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:17.710
So like always, let's
just rewrite this.

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:19.726
So I'm going to write the 8,085.

00:00:19.726 --> 00:00:22.100
I'm going to write
the 9 right below it

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:24.650
and write our little
multiplication symbol.

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:26.420
And now, we're ready to compute.

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:29.400
So first we can
tackle 9 times 5.

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.880
Well, we know that
9 times 5 is 45.

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.780
We can write the 5
in the ones place

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:37.400
and carry the 5
to the tens place.

00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:41.030
So 9 times 5 is 45.

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:45.637
Now we're ready to
move on to 9 times 8.

00:00:45.637 --> 00:00:47.220
And we're going to
calculate 9 times 8

00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:49.830
and then add the 4
that we just carried.

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:56.720
So 9 times 8 is 72,
plus the 4 is 76.

00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:01.630
So we'll write the 6 right here
the tens place and carry the 7.

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:05.340
Now we are ready to
calculate, and I'm

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:06.920
looking for a suitable color.

00:01:06.920 --> 00:01:13.890
9 times 0 100's plus-- and this
is a 7 in the hundreds place,

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.040
so that's actually 700.

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.890
Or if we're just kind of
going with the computation, 9

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:19.060
times 0 plus 7.

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:24.830
Well, 9 times 0
is 0, plus 7 is 7.

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:29.130
And then, finally, we
have-- and once again, I'm

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.140
looking for a suitable
color-- 9 times 8.

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:35.990
This is the last thing
we have to compute.

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:39.580
We already know that
9 times 8 is 72.

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:43.680
And we just write the 72 right
down here, and we're done.

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:50.360
8,085 times 9 is 72,765.

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:52.300
Let's do one more
example just to make sure

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:54.456
that this is really clear
in your brain, at least

00:01:54.456 --> 00:01:55.580
the process for doing this.

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:57.860
And I also want you to
think about why this works.

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:08.998
So let's try 7 times 5,396.

00:02:08.998 --> 00:02:14.000
And I encourage you to pause it
and try it on your own as well.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:19.490
I'm going to rewrite
it-- 5,396 times 7.

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:24.470
First, we'll think
about what 7 times 6 is.

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:25.910
We know that's 42.

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:27.790
We'll put the 2
in the ones place.

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:29.940
4 we will carry.

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:34.330
Then we need to concern
ourselves with 7 times 9.

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:37.360
But then, we have to calculate
that and then add the 4.

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:42.990
7 times 9 is 63, plus 4 is 67.

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:47.800
So we put the 7 down
here and carry the 6.

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:54.370
Then we have to worry
about 7 times 3 plus this 6

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:55.970
that we had just
finished carrying.

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:01.300
7 times 3 is 21, plus 6 is 27.

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:05.720
So we'll write the 7 here in the
hundreds place and carry the 2.

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:11.525
And then, finally, we have
7 times 5, which is 35.

00:03:11.525 --> 00:03:13.163
But we have to add the 2.

00:03:13.163 --> 00:03:16.640
35 plus 2 is 37.

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:21.122
So 5,396 times 7 is 37,772.
