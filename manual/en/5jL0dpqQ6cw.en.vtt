00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:08.480
If you've never grown gourds, you've never
really lived.

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:11.090
They're a lot of fun.

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:18.660
Let me tell you about the hanging gourd gardens
of Moss Mountain Farm.

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:19.970
They start right here.

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:21.670
You see this big long arbor?

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:25.140
Well, it's perfect for growing a fast growing
vine.

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:29.800
And when I talk about a fast growing vine,
gourds you will not believe.

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:34.180
I got some seed down here, and you'll see,
I kind of worked up this area.

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:38.870
Gourds love lots of sun and they'll grow in
just about any kind of soil.

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:44.401
I've enriched this with some good potting
soil, so there's lots of humus in here.

00:00:44.401 --> 00:00:49.640
And as soon as the soil begins to warm up,
you see these irises?

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:54.010
Well, they're just about finished so that
tells me that it's time to plant the gourds.

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:58.190
The chance of a frost has passed and the soil
is beginning to warm up.

00:00:58.190 --> 00:00:59.920
And gourds really like it hot.

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.489
Now, what's amazing is they come in all different
shapes.

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:06.710
Last year, we had big long Dipper gourds.

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:10.469
Different shaped gourds hanging from here,
and it worked out really well.

00:01:10.469 --> 00:01:15.729
And this year, I want to make sure every inch
of this is covered with leaves of gourd vines

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:19.289
and all kinds of gourd blooms, as well as
the gourds themselves.

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:22.610
And we have another one of these arbors on
the opposite side, I'm going to do the same

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:24.270
thing, for the same effect.

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:28.020
So what you do is you take the seed, and they're
really big, interesting seed.

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.850
And you see, they're big, flat seed.

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:37.479
Basically, what you're gonna do is just kinda
sorta space them about a foot apart, like

00:01:37.479 --> 00:01:38.479
this.

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:40.350
And I'm just gonna push those in and cover
them up.

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.490
Now, I've worked up this soil to about 12
inches deep, and I'm planting one variety

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:46.490
here.

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:48.299
This Dipper gourd, the old fashioned Dipper
gourd.

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:53.310
The kind that they used to have by the well,
where they would dip out of a bucket, some

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:54.659
water, and drink from it.

00:01:54.659 --> 00:02:00.561
Now, what I'll do is, once these come up they'll
have a primary set of leaves, and then the

00:02:00.561 --> 00:02:03.459
next set will be these big round leaves.

00:02:03.459 --> 00:02:05.649
These will germinate in about 10 days.

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:09.610
And you'll see these great big leaves on them
within two weeks.

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:11.630
And then they start putting up runners.

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:15.630
And that's when I'll lay some little sticks
along here, and that'll give them a leg up,

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:19.480
so to speak, so they can began to climb over
this entire arbor.

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.670
Now, last year I actually took some string
and kinda tied it along, and I may do that

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:25.099
again this year.

00:02:25.099 --> 00:02:29.370
All you need is just something to kinda assist
them, they have little tendrils to hang on

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:32.010
to each of these metal supports that make
the arbor.

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:33.079
One last step.

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:37.879
I fertilize generously with an organic fertilizer
because you really want to make sure they're

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:41.540
well fed, so you can growing the biggest gourds
in the neighborhood.
