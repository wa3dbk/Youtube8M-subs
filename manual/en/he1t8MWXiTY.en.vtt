00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:13.080
My father used to say, he said, "In the Shambhala tradition we believe that everybody is gifted".

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:23.870
And one of the basic notions of this notion of goodness is that we are complete;

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:30.630
so when we’re using this term of "Basic Goodness",

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:39.650
it is talking about the inherent completeness

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:43.230
and the non-faultiness.

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:52.140
And when... again the term in Tibetan that we use for basic goodness is "Döma-ne Sangpo";

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:58.900
"Döma-ne" is the word that means primordial, basic, innate;

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:04.720
and the word "Sangpo" is good, pure, clean.

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:08.670
And my experience of this process of looking at this

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:15.170
is that it is beyond word and it’s beyond expression;

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:20.630
it is something that we have to be willing to feel and touch;

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:24.950
but what is most important is that that moment when our mind

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:30.280
has that moment of self reflection;

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.930
and when you have that moment of self reflection

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:44.830
and if you feel like you are not worthy it's a very [snap] momentary experience;

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:52.380
the power of that moment is astronomical.

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.280
And we’re living in a culture where that very issue, I feel like,

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:02.040
is at the basis of our social fabric;

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.880
it’s the basis of our economy;

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:10.240
it’s the basis of most of why we go to work and get up;

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:16.140
so I feel like right now we are at a crossroads

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:22.840
and what we decide at a global level, how we feel as humanity

00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:26.860
will have incredible implications.

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:33.010
It effects how we raise our children, the education process, everything.

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:38.230
And I am not going to sit here and say I have all the answers, by any means;

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:46.520
but I invite everyone and I completely understand if you are doubting

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:50.000
what I am saying, and also doubting this notion of goodness;

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.140
it is something I can not convince you;

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:56.760
we have to go through this process of what we feel.
