00:00:08.589 --> 00:00:13.610
Another Lego review from Jaystrepher and today I got a good steal on this.

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:18.220
I got the Lego City Truck.

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:20.890
Set number 3221

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:22.689
or just LEGO (R) Truck,

00:00:22.689 --> 00:00:26.460
contains 278 pieces,

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.050
ages five through twelve.

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:32.410
Looks like we get to build the 18-wheeler.

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:34.040
Looks like we get to build the 18-wheeler.

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:40.010
It looks like a hauler type thing with lots of Lego sets.

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:47.010
It looks pretty cool.

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:50.400
I can't wait to put this thing together.

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:57.400
So let's do the unboxing.

00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:04.160
Let's see what we get inside here.

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:09.410
Oh this big box for just for this? Really.

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:12.460
Okay, looks like we get some stuff.

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:17.050
There's some manuals.

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:22.750
More bags of stuff.
Some stickers.

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:25.810
Oh, 8 by 16 plate. No I get two of them.

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:28.070
Okay!

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:31.050
Nothing else in that box.

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:36.000
So let's take a look here.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.490
What a good idea.

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:43.900
Let's take a look at these stickers here. I don't use the stickers but I I'll same them.

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:49.200
At least they got the little ....

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.250
Yeah, that's kind of cool.

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.510
Yeah, that's kind of cool.

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:57.360
I'll save these. Probably not going to use them.

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:01.210
Plenty of yellow stuff.

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:04.210
Wall elements.

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:05.730
So I got this for 15 dollars. I was happy.

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:07.330
fSo I got this for 15 dollars. I was happy.

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:10.529
So I got this for 15 dollars. I was happy.

00:02:10.529 --> 00:02:12.089
Now I guess I can

00:02:12.089 --> 00:02:19.089
put it together and I'll show you guys what it looks like.

00:02:20.529 --> 00:02:21.829
Here is the City Truck all completed.

00:02:21.829 --> 00:02:24.979
Here is the City Truck all completed.

00:02:24.979 --> 00:02:28.689
So you can see,

00:02:28.689 --> 00:02:29.769
we get two minifigures.

00:02:29.769 --> 00:02:35.409
we get two minifigures.

00:02:35.409 --> 00:02:38.639
This guy here is the driver.

00:02:38.639 --> 00:02:41.489
I like the delivery guy

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:44.749
I mean I don't know. I mean this guy here don't look like a delivery driver.

00:02:44.749 --> 00:02:49.669
I mean I don't know. I mean this guy here don't look like a delivery driver.

00:02:49.669 --> 00:02:51.919
I mean I don't know. I mean this guy here don't look like a delivery driver.

00:02:51.919 --> 00:02:53.949
But at least you get two mini-figs.

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:56.719
You also get this cool hand truck

00:02:56.719 --> 00:03:01.859
dolly, whatever you want to call it.

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:07.680
I guess to pick all these Lego packages. I didn't put the stickers on them

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.179
because they'll just end up pealing off.

00:03:10.179 --> 00:03:11.659
So I'm going to save them

00:03:11.659 --> 00:03:14.309
So I'm going to save them

00:03:14.309 --> 00:03:17.689
Just use these as nameless boxes.

00:03:17.689 --> 00:03:19.589
At least you get nine of these little

00:03:19.589 --> 00:03:23.589
smooth titles of blue ones which I rarely have any of those.

00:03:23.589 --> 00:03:26.119
Let's take a look at the trailer.

00:03:26.119 --> 00:03:28.629
Let's take a look at the trailer.

00:03:28.629 --> 00:03:31.629
You get your landing gear thing here.

00:03:31.629 --> 00:03:34.519
I don't like the way they constructed this but it's cool.

00:03:34.519 --> 00:03:41.519
I don't like the way they constructed this but it's cool.

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:56.209
So let's take a look on the inside of it.

00:03:57.549 --> 00:03:59.769
A lot of storage in there.

00:03:59.769 --> 00:04:04.539
Now these do come off.

00:04:04.539 --> 00:04:07.129
The middle one is not so bad.

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:08.629
This one here when you pull it off,

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:11.299
This one here when you pull it off,

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:13.889
will sometimes grab onto this

00:04:13.889 --> 00:04:18.729
and pull these off the doors. So you got to be very careful.

00:04:18.729 --> 00:04:22.879
I would have just did this a little differently

00:04:22.879 --> 00:04:25.429
but it works.

00:04:25.429 --> 00:04:26.710
 

00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:29.650
 

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:31.950
And you get the doors on the sides.

00:04:31.950 --> 00:04:34.360
So you get a total of three entry points

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:37.139
So you get a total of three entry points

00:04:37.139 --> 00:04:40.910
for the truck.

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:47.210
There's the doors on the other side.

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:50.840
This is the hitch. It just simply sits down in here.

00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:55.110
This is the hitch. It just simply sits down in here.

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:59.159
It's real easy to snap in.

00:04:59.159 --> 00:05:01.960
Well let's take a look at the truck.

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:03.419
Well let's take a look at the truck.

00:05:03.419 --> 00:05:05.149
It has doors that open.

00:05:05.149 --> 00:05:07.209
It has these mirrors.

00:05:07.209 --> 00:05:11.739
Well they're suppose to look like mirrors.
There's the inside.

00:05:11.739 --> 00:05:14.789
And we'll open it up

00:05:14.789 --> 00:05:16.419
which is real easy to open.

00:05:16.419 --> 00:05:18.879
This is actually hinged.

00:05:18.879 --> 00:05:22.240
As you can see we get a seat

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:24.599
and we get a bed.

00:05:24.599 --> 00:05:29.009
And if you notice, you get a little TV in there too.

00:05:29.009 --> 00:05:31.310
So it's kind of like a mini trailer in here like a little RV

00:05:31.310 --> 00:05:36.380
which is cool for I guess for the driver just doing a long haul.

00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:42.780
I guess he can sleep in there at night.

00:05:42.780 --> 00:05:47.509
I like the little ladder here. There's a lot of detail.

00:05:47.509 --> 00:05:50.599
I like the front with the grill,

00:05:50.599 --> 00:05:51.919
headlights,

00:05:51.919 --> 00:05:56.519
bumper. I mean this is a really good little set.

00:05:56.519 --> 00:05:58.309
And it's real easy to put together.

00:05:58.309 --> 00:06:02.609
And it's real easy to put together.

00:06:02.609 --> 00:06:04.210
 

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:10.539
And great addition for anybody's Lego collection.

00:06:10.539 --> 00:06:13.019
Here's the manual.
I forgot to mention

00:06:13.019 --> 00:06:18.639
there is numbered bags so it makes it easier.

00:06:18.639 --> 00:06:22.319
So this is the Lego City Truck.

00:06:22.319 --> 00:06:27.110
So this is the Lego City Truck.

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:33.179
Contains 278 pieces, set number 3221.

00:06:33.179 --> 00:06:40.179
Age range is five through twelve years.

00:06:40.799 --> 00:06:45.049
You can't go wrong with this set.

00:06:45.049 --> 00:06:45.610
Thank you for watching!
