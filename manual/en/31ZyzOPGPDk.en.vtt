00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:11.059
What's up Attackers, Today is Tuesday January
21st and welcome to your daily MMO news exclusively

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:13.200
from MMOAttack.com.

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.590
Today's episode is sponsored by Red Stag by
Jim Beam Kentucky Straight Bourbon Whiskey

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:21.340
infused with natural Black Cherry flavors.

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:23.859
You can really taste the male deer.

00:00:23.859 --> 00:00:28.760
Today we have the DayZ update delayed, a preview
for the next Final Fantasy A Realm Reborn

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:31.750
update and not so Rusty after all.

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:35.500
The Daily XP starts now.

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.300
Bit surprise from the DayZ camp, the next
update has been delayed!

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.410
They should change the name to Delayed Z,
amiright?

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.879
Just kidding, I stole that from one of the
comments.

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:50.010
Anyways, the latest update that went live
yesterday was scrapped at the last minute

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.730
because of a bug that made players unable
to loot corpses.

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:56.039
That's kind of a big deal in this game if
you didn't know.

00:00:56.039 --> 00:01:00.059
The team hopes to fix the update soon, which
will bring a number of other fixes and adjustments

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:04.900
including the addition of some much anticipated
items like the Shotgun, Hacksaw and the new

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:08.119
harbor town Svetloyarsk.

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:13.220
Today Square Enix announced a preview event
for the upcoming 2.2 update in A Realm Reborn.

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.400
The previous update that included player housing
and end-game content might be tough to follow

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.619
up but the team has scheduled a special live
video event for January 25th to focus on the

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:23.619
release.

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:27.720
Among the things we can expect are 'The Coming
of Leviathan' primal event and additional

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:30.130
details on the PlayStation 4 release.

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:35.710
If you care to wake up at 4AM PST this Saturday,
you too can be the first to hear the details!

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:40.329
Facepunch Studios founder Garry Newman has
a lot to celebrate following the successful

00:01:40.329 --> 00:01:42.229
Early Access launch of Rust.

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:46.120
According to the developer, Rust has earned
over half of the revenue that his first title,

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:48.640
Garry's Mod, has earned in the past 9 years.

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:52.270
To put that in perspective, Rust has been
on Steam's Early Access for just over a month.

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:53.270
What is Rust?

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:56.200
Rust is an Indie RPG game where your only
aim is to survive.

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.140
