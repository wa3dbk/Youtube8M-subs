Hi this is Josh with another episode of
Solar Tech TV from Wholesale Solar

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:19.259
today I'm gonna tell you about a brand
new product from Four Star Solar

00:00:19.259 --> 00:00:23.560
the Rolling Thunder battery backup. I'd
be willing to bet my next paycheck that

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:24.770
everyone in the world

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:28.340
has got a list of things that they don't
want to lose when the power goes out

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:32.640
and that's what this unit is all about on

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:42.960
The exterior of

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:47.400
the Rolling Thunder boasts an attractive
white powdercoat looks good in any room in your house.

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:52.200
Battery capacity meter built into the
door so you know your state of charge at a glance.

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:57.800
There should be no surprises. Locking door; I've got mischievous kids at home I don't know about you

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:02.200
I don't want them getting into the Rolling
Thunder. Locking red casters on the bottom and

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:05.379
that way you can have power where you
need it when you need it.

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:09.350
It's got 8 GFI protected 120 AC outlets,

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:13.380
there's four on this side, four on the other side.
It's got two USB's

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.960
and that means that you can keep all
kinds of devices and appliances online

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:18.160
during a power outage.

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:21.360
On the inside here we got a 2000 watt

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.380
pure sine wave Magnum Energy inverter on
the top shelf here with a remote.

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:28.580
The shelf has got breakers integrated
into it,

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:32.440
got AC input, AC output, DC disconnect

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:36.220
bottom shelf here is our battery bank.
These are sealed

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:39.720
AGM type two batteries; means no
emissions,

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:43.950
means it's safe to operate indoors where
your standard backup generator is not.

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.789
The quick connects mean you don't need
any tools to set the equipment up.

00:01:48.789 --> 00:01:53.800
This is a total of 500 amp hours at 12
volts which is six thousand Watts of stored power.

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:58.360
To charge the Rolling Thunder all you need to do is take an extension cord plugged into a

00:01:58.360 --> 00:01:59.509
120 outlet in your house,

00:01:59.509 --> 00:02:03.800
plug it into the Rolling Thunder, let it
charge up.

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:07.410
When the power goes out, you can leave it
in place just like this;

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:10.709
or, you can unplug it, roll it anywhere you
need it.

00:02:10.709 --> 00:02:15.090
And that is the lowdown on the new
product from Four Star Solar

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:20.400
the Rolling Thunder Battery Backup. If
you've got any questions or concerns feel free to give us a call.

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:27.480
