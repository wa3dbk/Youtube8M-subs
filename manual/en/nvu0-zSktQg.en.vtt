00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:05.720
How to Like Beer.

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:10.190
Some beers are watery and weak, but, learn
to order the right ones, and you'll find you

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:14.260
can learn to like beer and appreciate all
of its complexities.

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:20.980
You will need Several bottles of beer Correct
temperatures Beer glasses and water or bread.

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:23.440
Don't drink unless you're of legal age.

00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:25.750
Drink responsibly, and never drink and drive.

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:27.250
Step 1.

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:29.160
Make sure your beer isn't too cold.

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.100
Chilling a beer too much makes it more difficult
to detect nuances in the flavor as well as

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.890
making it more difficult to digest.

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:41.620
Many beers from small breweries and European
brewers note the correct drinking temperature

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:43.320
on the label.

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.329
Step 2.

00:00:44.329 --> 00:00:46.050
Pour your beer into a glass.

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.990
There are nearly as many glass styles as there
are beer styles, and each one is designed

00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:52.960
to enhance the drinking experience.

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:54.420
Step 3.

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.399
Consider the beer's appearance.

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.580
Beers can vary greatly in their color and
clarity, and can range from straw colored

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:04.140
and sparkling to opaque and almost black.

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.390
Also note the head on the beer.

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:10.170
Strong head retention often indicates well-crafted
beer.

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:11.369
Step 4.

00:01:11.369 --> 00:01:13.859
Note the beer's aroma as it goes into your
mouth.

00:01:13.859 --> 00:01:18.609
Olfactory senses are important to opening
up your palate and the smell greatly affects

00:01:18.609 --> 00:01:19.880
the taste.

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:25.349
Aroma, like taste, can be delicate or heavy,
well-balanced or uneven.

00:01:25.349 --> 00:01:26.349
Step 5.

00:01:26.349 --> 00:01:30.639
Taste your beer, letting it wash over each
section of your tongue.

00:01:30.639 --> 00:01:34.799
Consider the mouth feel, which is how heavy
or light the beer feels in your mouth.

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:39.369
Try to separate the hop taste and the malt
taste, determining the structure and balance

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:40.450
of the beer.

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:44.770
Dry beer indicates a lack of sugar and tastes
bitter and hoppy.

00:01:44.770 --> 00:01:49.020
Fruitier beer has had more malt sugar converted
into sugar.

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:50.270
Step 6.

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:53.149
Consider the aftertaste, or finish, of the
beer.

00:01:53.149 --> 00:01:57.560
The aftertaste sensation of the beer may be
long and lingering or it may leave without

00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:58.799
a trace.

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.179
Step 7.

00:02:00.179 --> 00:02:03.630
Determine a general impression of the beer
with all of the aspects together.

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:08.950
If it's a high-quality, well-made beer, you'll
like it and you'll want to have another drink.

00:02:08.950 --> 00:02:14.349
Then have a drink of water or a piece of bread
to cleanse your palate and open another bottle.

00:02:14.349 --> 00:02:19.140
Did you know According to a recent study,
the more beer a scientist drinks, the less

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:24.209
likely they are to publish a paper or to have
a paper cited by another researcher.
