00:00:00.699 --> 00:00:04.049
Hey, I'm the one who made that command block video.

00:00:04.049 --> 00:00:08.609
Here is our continuation where I will show you snapshot where you get horses in Minecraft.

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:13.259
You begin with going into your internet browser, not Minecraft this time.

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:16.259
And we let it wait for a while.

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:30.200
And then you type in "Mojang".

00:00:30.310 --> 00:00:33.029
There, we have a Mojang now!

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:37.319
And then you click on "Mojang -Makers of Minecraft".

00:00:38.379 --> 00:00:45.419
Then we just have to wait for a while, there we go, and then you scroll down to

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:49.169
Here, stop it. And now we're here.

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:57.809
You can here see Windows and Mac, these are the computers. I have Windows, you should take the one you have!

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:04.019
And then you press on "run", there you can see the seconds go down - 3, 2 1.

00:01:04.989 --> 00:01:06.989
And then you press there.

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:13.559
And then this thing pops up and you see a lot of weird words that we do not understand. And then you click play.

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:17.999
And I've already gotten in, unfortunately.

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:26.310
Or not unfortunately, it's good. And then you click on the horse world, you can name it to whatever you want. Everyone knows how to create a world.

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.949
And then you press here, and now you have horses as eggs!

00:01:30.909 --> 00:01:38.339
And then you take this, it's good because it's armour. I like to have some.

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:41.880
And sugar is very good to have. For -

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:44.290
Horses.

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:48.179
And then I click on the horse. You have to click it with sugar first.

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.360
And then you click on -

00:01:51.729 --> 00:01:53.140
Wait

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:56.040
*inaudible* and then you press it with "e".

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:58.770
I don't have my own horse.

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.100
Okay, we can test on a new horse then.

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:07.600
And we do this,

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.919
Ow, the little horse is taking damage. Let us see if we can give it some sugar.

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:17.739
And then it gets bigger, bigger, bigger, bigger and bigger. And in the end it's very big.

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:24.670
Okay, now it's "fully big", now you only have to press "E" on it again.

00:02:25.489 --> 00:02:30.939
There, now we have "E" on it and then you put the saddle on it. You can also use armour.

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:37.449
And you can now ride around on a horse. This was snapshot, there are some more things on snapshot as well.

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:39.910
And then you jump of the horse with this key.

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:49.419
You jump of with this one, and then you start walking as normal. And now I'm going to show you what more things are new like this and that.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.009
You can do very funny things with a lead, now I'm going to show you something very funny

00:02:54.739 --> 00:02:58.359
with a lead. Here you have a pig, and you can do this.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:03.789
And then you simply take a walk with the pig. And one good thing you can do with pigs,

00:03:03.790 --> 00:03:10.359
or not only pigs. This works with all animals (using a lead). But the horses don't always listen ;(

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:14.260
There! The pig is now a little bit stuck.

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:20.500
Ok, bye. This was everything for this time. Bye. It's done now.
