00:00:12.339 --> 00:00:15.829
This time we went to those who of four-wheel drive is very experienced:

00:00:15.829 --> 00:00:19.970
Subaru produces only four-wheel drive cars, 

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:23.769
and the STI goes well with our track ...

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:40.820
Every Subaru car has in common some points on which are based all

00:00:40.820 --> 00:00:41.640
projects:

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:45.960
the low center of gravity (for this reason are used the Boxer engines), the optimal distribution,

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:52.960
the weight reduction and the permanent four-wheel drive.

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:03.180
So It isn't a coincidence that all cars badged Subaru are always very

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.760
pleasant and safe to drive, and today, with the advent of the new WRX STI,

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.780
strictly notchback and with the spoiler on the hood (as tradition

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.140
wants), even among the monks of the Pleiades has arrived the star of the ephemeral

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:19.610
and charm. With the slogan "let's make them even beautiful as it

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:23.630
is safe," they launched this crusade animated with the most good

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:27.650
intentions.

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:32.100
New front, fenders wider, taller wing, step incremented

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.740
for more space on board

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:38.780
and a bigger trunk. The extreme sport WRX STI 300 HP,

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:43.970
now appears with a more modern look, sporty and muscular, and with the strong

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:47.590
system SI-Drive to select three driving modes, with

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:51.899
sporty characteristics increasingly extreme. In short, the fixed points of his

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:55.000
DNA were not affected.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.890
"This Subaru STI is very interesting, especially for the possibility of 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:07.640
managing the power, the traction between the front and the rear part,

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.579
simply moving this button

00:02:11.579 --> 00:02:17.680
we can choose where to distribute torque, depending... even on the driving style,

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:21.409
but above all on the terrain you plan to take". The practical result is a funny

00:02:21.409 --> 00:02:23.090
car on the road,

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:27.720
with high sport performance on track and safe to "abuse" even

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.340
on dirt.

00:02:58.819 --> 00:03:03.749
So perfect and easy to control that even a "normal" pilot may get

00:03:03.749 --> 00:03:06.329
some satisfactions, on and off the track...
