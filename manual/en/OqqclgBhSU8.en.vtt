00:00:01.739 --> 00:00:02.739
Hey guys

00:00:02.739 --> 00:00:04.640
As promised this is my tutorial

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:06.709
On how I achieved that fabulous

00:00:06.709 --> 00:00:07.709
"Wash N Go."

00:00:07.709 --> 00:00:10.179
I am starting of with freshly washed hair

00:00:10.179 --> 00:00:14.080
Soaking wet, and I am going to apply

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.600
My "Kimmaytube" leave in conditioner.

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:19.470
It is always better to work in sections.

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.630
I section my hair into four.

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:24.150
This makes it easy quicker, easier,

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:27.199
More efficient and truly less overwhelming

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:28.429
To work with.

00:00:28.429 --> 00:00:30.410
So I smooth down my "Kimmaytube"

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:34.000
Leave in and notice how I am not raking my
fingers through.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.790
I am simply pulling it down in between the
palms of my hands.

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:39.890
Then I follow this with me

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:43.430
"Curl Enhancing Smoothie" from the SheaMoisture
line.

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:48.640
CaroBJDJC will be happy to know I am finally
only my

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:49.870
Second tub of this product.

00:00:49.870 --> 00:00:52.920
In the same way I smooth it down like

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:59.090
I did the "Kimmaytube" leave in.

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:02.420
So initially I thought I was very heavy-handed

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:04.530
With that product because you can see it

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:06.390
Looking kinda white and I was scared that

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:08.359
I was going to end up with flakes.

00:01:08.359 --> 00:01:10.450
But turns out that really,

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:13.399
With this product and my hair,

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:14.570
The more the merrier!!

00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:16.920
My hair was really soft,

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.030
Not crunchy at all.

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.420
I Kind of regret not continuing with

00:01:20.420 --> 00:01:24.250
You know, applying a lot of product.

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:27.780
Hence, you will notice me using smaller amounts

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.509
Of the Curl Enhancing smoothie throughout
my hair.

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:31.939
But for future reference, when I am

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:34.440
Doing my "Wash N Gos" again, I will not

00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:36.590
Hold back on using this product because

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:40.630
It left my hair very soft and very moisturized.

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:46.259
So doing the same thing on the other half,

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:48.479
I start off with my Kimmaytube leave in

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:51.670
And then follow through with my

00:01:51.670 --> 00:02:00.790
Curl Enhancing Smoothie.

00:02:00.790 --> 00:02:11.840
Notice that I do not rake my fingers through
my hair.

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:14.660
I simply apply the product and between

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:17.580
The palms of my hands, just run through and

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.250
Smooth the product through.

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:20.470
I find that raking it

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:23.070
Makes my hair a little bit more frizzy.

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:32.420
And I don't want any frizz to my curls.

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:42.750
Here comes my star ingredient, my Flax Seed
Gel!

00:02:42.750 --> 00:02:44.880
For a look on how I made this,

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.480
You can check out my Flax Seed Gel tutorial.

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:52.950
I will leave the link in the description box
below as well.

00:02:52.950 --> 00:03:00.010
When it comes to gel, I find that less is
more.

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:03.030
I was really really impressed by this gel

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.680
Because it did not leave my hair crunchy at
all.

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:10.180
In fact the combination with the SheaMoisture

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:13.730
And this just left my hair really really soft.

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:16.360
I can't stress enough how soft my hair was.

00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:18.960
But again because I was a little bit scared

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:21.440
About ending up with crunchy hair,

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:24.650
I went ahead and sprayed some water in there.

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:25.650
You don't need to do this.

00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:28.740
You can skip the water spraying part.

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:31.420
But once you have that all done, you are all
set.

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:36.790
The next thing you want to do is seal in all
that moisture.

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:39.820
The next and final step is sealing.

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:43.300
I use Jojoba oil to seal all that moisture
in,

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:45.740
Because I find that Jojoba oil

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:58.790
Infuses nicely through my strands.

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:00.680
And then scrunch up the ends to kinda

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:02.120
Sculpt the look.

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:03.870
And "Voila" you are all done!

00:04:03.870 --> 00:04:06.620
I also like to comb the bottom of my roots

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:08.490
To kind of give it a bigger

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:12.060
Wash N Go.

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:20.269
And that is it guys, My tutorial

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:23.400
On how to achieve a fabulous Wash n Go.

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:24.400
Very Simple.

00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:25.400
Very Easy.

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:27.080
And I hope you like this tutorial.

00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:29.479

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:30.520
