00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:04.370
Hey youtubers it’s Charlie and recently
there’s been some reports that the Carol

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:10.120
Danvers Captain Marvel might be featured during
Avengers 2 and even added to the roster before

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:11.120
the 3rd sequel.

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:14.320
So this video is going to be a quick breakdown
of her origin story in the comics, how they

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:18.590
might introduce her in the movies and my top
5 Captain Marvel stories.

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:22.300
The Avengers roster will be changing between
Avengers 2 and Avengers 3 regardless of who

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:24.430
they add to the team.

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:27.990
We’re already getting Quicksilver and Scarlet
Witch and there have been so many different

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:34.500
team configurations, not to mention spinoffs
like West Coast Avengers, that Marvel has

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.109
to start cycling characters in and out to
keep the stories fresh.

00:00:38.109 --> 00:00:42.469
You bring in a new character with a unique
perspective and suddenly it’s not the billionth

00:00:42.469 --> 00:00:45.570
movie in a row to end in a slapfight over
an infinity gem.

00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.039
Of all the major changes going on behind the
scenes, bringing in more female protagonists

00:00:50.039 --> 00:00:55.489
is one of the biggest priorities, Carol Danvers
being the next on the list.

00:00:55.489 --> 00:00:59.890
There have been a couple versions of the character
including Carol Danvers the air force pilot,

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:04.220
the Ms Marvel, then Captain Marvel, which
is who she is right now.

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:07.979
She even just saved Peter Quill’s ass in
the last Guardians of the Galaxy comic.

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:11.850
She can go trade blows with Thor and the Hulk
and she has the quick wit of Tony Stark with

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:13.850
the soul of Captain America.

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:16.659
She was born to be an Avengers even before
she got superpowers.

00:01:16.659 --> 00:01:23.240
And she’s currently flying around in space
with a cat named Chewie.

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:27.719
In the comics she was born into a totally
normal working class family and had a fairly

00:01:27.719 --> 00:01:29.710
Lisa Simpson type upbringing.

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:33.719
Meaning she was way too smart for her environment
and had a terrible father who did nothing

00:01:33.719 --> 00:01:35.450
to nurture her abilities.

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:40.640
As a way to escape the small town hell closing
in on her she joined the air force after high

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.649
school, became a pilot and rose to the rank
of colonel.

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:46.579
She went on to become a CIA agent and worked
missions with Ben Grimm before he became the

00:01:46.579 --> 00:01:49.100
thing and Wolverine before he got the adamantium
skeleton.

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:53.000
She even crossed paths with Black Widow when
she was still a spy for the Soviet Union.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.060
Already you can see how Danvers has pre-existing
relationships with other Avengers.

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:57.179
Wolverine was an avenger for those who haven’t
read the comics.

00:01:57.179 --> 00:02:01.689
After working in the CIA, Danvers got upgraded
to NASA and ended up working with Mar-Vell.

00:02:01.689 --> 00:02:03.289
The Kree Captain Marvel.

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:07.450
During a battle with Mar-Vell’s arch nemesis,
Danvers was exposed to alien radiation from

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:08.450
a superweapon.

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:11.530
During that she absorbed a bunch of Mar-Vell’s
DNA giving her superpowers.

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:17.010
She essentially got the equivalent powers
of Superman, and a sixth sense for danger.

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:19.430
Think of that like Spidey Sense.

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:21.920
That was the birth of Ms Marvel.

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:28.720
Later she changed the costume to the pre-Captain
Marvel design.

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.540
Fun Fact, Janet Van Dyne, the original Wasp
helped her make it.

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:38.232
In the Ant-Man movie, Janet Van Dyne isn’t
around because who knows why, but her daughter

00:02:38.232 --> 00:02:40.080
Hope Van Dyne is, played by Evangeline Lily.

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:43.240
They could retcon the relationship and make
her friends with Hope, giving Ant-Man one

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:44.440
more reason to cross over with the Avengers.

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:47.030
Here’s where Danvers’ history gets a little
funny.

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:49.234
She joined the Avengers initally when Scarlet
Witch left, leaving an opening.

00:02:49.234 --> 00:02:50.234
She left to have magic babies, because I guess
you can’t be a mom and an avenger at the

00:02:50.234 --> 00:02:51.234
same time.

00:02:51.234 --> 00:02:54.180
I know that sounds weird, but when Scarlet
Witch came back, she joined the West Coast

00:02:54.180 --> 00:03:11.880
Avengers which was a new team started by Hawkeye
at the suggestion of The Vision.

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:15.591
See how Marvel might start doing two Avengers
movies in a year, one for west coast, one

00:03:15.591 --> 00:03:20.140
for the classic team?

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:22.989
She was later kidnapped by an alien race called
the Brood, experimented on and got even more

00:03:22.989 --> 00:03:23.989
powerful.

00:03:23.989 --> 00:03:29.180
She started calling herself Binary and joined
the Starjammers.

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:35.150
She ended up losing those powers, became an
alcoholic, got sober and then House of M happened.

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:40.030
In the alternate reality she regained her
Ms Marvel powers and realized her full potential

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:41.030
as a superhero.

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:42.959
She was basically Marvel’s version of Wonder
Woman.

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:46.680
During the Secret Invasion storyline she defended
the entire city of New York from the skrulls

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:47.680
by herself.

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:51.640
Eventually she upgraded her costume to what
you see here and at the suggestion of Captain

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:54.780
America, started calling herself Captain Marvel
instead of Ms Marvel.

00:03:54.780 --> 00:04:00.180
She just got her own title at Marvel called
Captain Marvel this year that’s about 6

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.959
issues into it’s run.

00:04:02.959 --> 00:04:06.290
She went into space just like Iron Man did
last year and she’s been crossing paths

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:14.690
with the Guardians 
of the Galaxy.

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:18.549
She’s got the powers and the sass to outmatch
Tony Stark any day of the week, so she is

00:04:18.549 --> 00:04:21.489
the clear choice to be the next big female
character in the movies.

00:04:21.489 --> 00:04:25.930
The problem is that there are reports Marvel
is hesitant to give her what’s being called

00:04:25.930 --> 00:04:26.930
a cold-start.

00:04:26.930 --> 00:04:35.150
As in a low-level cameo versus a full on solo
movie.

00:04:35.150 --> 00:04:39.650
So if we don’t see her in Avengers 2, it’s
probably because they opted to give her a

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:42.710
bigger introduction in a future film or a
solo film.

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:47.030
I’ll be sure to add updates in future videos
about the movies as we learn new stuff.

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:50.110
But here are my top 5 Captain Marvel Stories.

00:04:50.110 --> 00:04:53.330
Number 5 - Captain Marvel versus J’Son of
Spartax

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:56.030
That’s right, this is the story that’s
going on right now.

00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:00.410
She goes up against Peter Quill’s father
who’s trying to mine vibranium to fortify

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:07.400
the Spartax fleet for a new war of conquest.

00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:10.960
In this shot here, you can see her getting
ready to take on the whole fleet.

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:16.250
I love how her hair makes you think of Yondu’s
fin.

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:21.740
This whole storyline right now makes me feel
like instead of doing Nova in the next Guardians

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:24.460
of the Galaxy movie, they might just incorporate
Captain Marvel.

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:28.830
It would be an opportunity for Chris Pratt
to make some sweet Star Wars references as

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:31.540
Danver’s cat is named after Chewbacca.

00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:35.280
The only thing preventing that is her human
origins.

00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:38.440
So they’ll probably start her off in an
earth based movie.

00:05:38.440 --> 00:05:40.620
Moving on to Number 4 - Avengers Earth’s
Mightiest Heroes

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:44.230
This is the cartoon.

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:48.790
She debuted in season 1 as Carol Danvers the
air force pilot and they did her origin story

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:50.020
from the comics.

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:53.840
If you want the easy intro to the character
just watch this.

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:57.900
She doesn’t become Ms Marvel to season 2,
but they do a Kree story and everything.

00:05:57.900 --> 00:06:02.009
The reason I like the cartoons so much are
that they don’t get bogged down with practicality

00:06:02.009 --> 00:06:03.009
like the movies do.

00:06:03.009 --> 00:06:06.390
The Cartoon’s just jump right into aliens,
magic and everything from the comics right

00:06:06.390 --> 00:06:07.830
away.

00:06:07.830 --> 00:06:09.660
Number 3 is Mighty Avengers.

00:06:09.660 --> 00:06:13.270
That’s a good comic to read in general.

00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:21.699
The story is rumored to be the basic plot
for the Avengers 2 movie.

00:06:21.699 --> 00:06:25.810
Number 2 - War of the Marvels, this was after
Dark Reign and Dark Avengers.

00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:32.169
Carol Danvers kicks the crap out of Moonstone
who had been posing as a fake Ms Marvel.

00:06:32.169 --> 00:06:36.940
and my Number 1 Captain Marvel Story is her
first solo title as Captain Marvel, the story

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:37.950
where she first took the name Captain.

00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:40.680
It was right after X-Men vs Avengers.

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:47.640
Most of the artwork you see of captain marvel
on tumblr right now is from this run.

00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:51.030
All of the recent titles she’s in are great,
so I’d at least recommend reading all of

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:53.580
the Captain Marvel comics.

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:58.190
I’m working on a new Korra video and walking
dead for tomorrow.

00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:00.960
