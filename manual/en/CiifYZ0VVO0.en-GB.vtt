Hello and a warm welcome back to HuwsNursery.
In today’s video you will learn or be refreshed

00:00:09.895 --> 00:00:15.045
about the top ways to growing healthier vegetables
in your organic garden. Organic gardening

00:00:15.045 --> 00:00:20.425
faces more challenges than conventional gardening
methods due to a zero-tolerance to harmful

00:00:20.425 --> 00:00:25.954
chemical use. But, it is very possible to
get a higher-yielding harvest because other

00:00:25.954 --> 00:00:29.995
gardening methods overlook fundamental points
to a stronger crop.

00:00:29.995 --> 00:00:35.815
This brings me to the first tip. Nitrogen
fixation. Nitrogen fixation is a key building

00:00:35.815 --> 00:00:40.715
block to a fertile soil for your vegetables.
Plants need the ammonia form of nitrogen for

00:00:40.715 --> 00:00:46.244
essential life components like proteins and
amino-acids however they can’t use the nitrogen

00:00:46.244 --> 00:00:52.435
which makes up 80% of the air we breathe in.
Therefore planting legumes like peas and beans

00:00:52.435 --> 00:00:57.814
will fix nitrogen in the soil by being stored
in their nodes. This nitrogen can then be

00:00:57.814 --> 00:01:04.064
used up by other plants requiring this. Companion
plant broad beans, sugar snap peas, peas and

00:01:04.064 --> 00:01:09.685
other legumes with other vegetables and as
a result they will promote plant growth.

00:01:09.685 --> 00:01:15.435
Secondly is to mulch raised beds in the autumn
with a 3inch layer of either well-rotted manure,

00:01:15.435 --> 00:01:21.475
leaves or leaf mould and cover with a dark
plastic. Make sure it is moist beforehand.

00:01:21.475 --> 00:01:26.015
This will let earthworms and decomposers to
work thoroughly at decomposing the organic

00:01:26.015 --> 00:01:32.255
matter over winter resulting in a more fertile
soil to grow vegetables in spring and also

00:01:32.255 --> 00:01:38.135
being warmer as the black plastic absorbs
warmth. Ensure you poke a few holes to allow

00:01:38.135 --> 00:01:43.485
a flow of oxygen otherwise decomposition will
not be possible. If you’ll like to see a

and learn the steps to success in 6 minutes.

00:01:49.715 --> 00:01:54.665
Thirdly is growing in containers. This is
an especially important tip if you have a

00:01:54.665 --> 00:01:59.195
small garden or even limited to a balcony
but growing organic vegetables can be done

00:01:59.195 --> 00:02:05.505
in almost any situation. Also people with
larger gardens should strive to include containers

00:02:05.505 --> 00:02:12.025
to grow some of their produce in but why?
Containers makes it easy to transport plants,

00:02:12.025 --> 00:02:16.995
stops them becoming invasive for example Mint
and it can be used to grow vegetables on hard

00:02:16.995 --> 00:02:23.255
surfaces for example on a patio on a trellis
which will maximise yields. Containers don’t

00:02:23.255 --> 00:02:29.105
have to be plastic. You can easily assemble
together wooden plant boxes or make hanging

00:02:29.105 --> 00:02:35.105
baskets out of dowels to grow cherry tomatoes.
Possibility is endless.

00:02:35.105 --> 00:02:40.495
My fourth tip is to work with nature by attracting
beneficial insects such as pollinators or

00:02:40.495 --> 00:02:46.355
bugs which will help keep pest numbers down.
I strongly suggest you devote at least 10%

00:02:46.355 --> 00:02:51.365
of your space to attracting beneficial insects.
That does not mean to simply plant flowers

00:02:51.365 --> 00:02:57.285
as you can still use the plants you grow as
food. Borage is one well known flowering herb

00:02:57.285 --> 00:03:02.175
which both attracts dozen of beneficial insects
but you can also add the leaves and flowers

00:03:02.175 --> 00:03:08.165
to salads. A colourful way to bring pollinators
is to grow a flower border consisting of herbs

00:03:08.165 --> 00:03:13.625
for the likes of marjoram, mint and borage
along with cornflowers and buckwheat. This

00:03:13.625 --> 00:03:18.785
will create a paradise for visiting bees and
why not create a movable paradise for example

00:03:18.785 --> 00:03:24.465
planting in a bucket or a wheelbarrow and
be able to move it around your garden?

00:03:24.465 --> 00:03:29.365
The fifth and final tip for growing organic
vegetables is to get ahead of the game with

00:03:29.365 --> 00:03:34.435
weeds. As organic vegetable gardening is against
the use of chemical weed sprays it can only

00:03:34.435 --> 00:03:40.775
take a few weeks to get overrun by weeds.
Weeds unfortunately will always outgrow vegetables.

00:03:40.775 --> 00:03:45.705
Originally all vegetables were weeds but after
thousands of years of cultivation they’re

00:03:45.705 --> 00:03:50.765
weaker therefore weeds will win in the battle
for space. But there are plenty of methods

00:03:50.765 --> 00:03:55.965
which will help you get that vital step ahead
of the game. My personal favourite method

00:03:55.965 --> 00:04:01.295
is mulching using up the abundance of free
resources for example leaves, cardboard and

00:04:01.295 --> 00:04:07.685
grass clippings we can source from our own
backyard, in the house or in your local park.

00:04:07.685 --> 00:04:11.755
This fall collect leaves and in the spring
you can use them to place in between rows

00:04:11.755 --> 00:04:16.875
of plants stopping light hit the bare patches
of ground and also adding nutrients as they

00:04:16.875 --> 00:04:23.845
slowly decompose. Add a 2-3 inch layer and
repeat when you see weeds poking through.

00:04:23.845 --> 00:04:28.055
Another great mulch is wood-chippings which
you can get for free or for a very cheap price

00:04:28.055 --> 00:04:33.604
in a local saw mill. Black plastic is a less
aesthetically appealing method however we

00:04:33.604 --> 00:04:38.765
got great results when we used it to plant
our squashes and you can see that video by

00:04:38.765 --> 00:04:43.744
finding the link in the description.
I hope that you have found this video interesting

00:04:43.744 --> 00:04:48.655
and I would love to know what your top tips
are? So please post them down in the comments

00:04:48.655 --> 00:04:54.315
section. Thank you for watching and I’ll
see you again soon in another video, remember,

00:04:54.315 --> 00:04:55.824
don’t panic and grow organic!
