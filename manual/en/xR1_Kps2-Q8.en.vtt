00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:08.800
Now, the main thing we learned about current affairs shows last year

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:12.714
is that they are the very models of fair, detached journalism

00:00:12.714 --> 00:00:15.213
and it's good to see that tradition continuing this year.

00:00:15.213 --> 00:00:19.333
Here's Today Tonight's delicate profile of some ex-Big Brother housemates.

00:00:19.534 --> 00:00:21.614
Remember these two turkeys?

00:00:23.414 --> 00:00:24.294
Reasonable.

00:00:24.294 --> 00:00:28.347
And Today Tonight is never more reasonable than on the subject of Mercedes Corby.

00:00:28.347 --> 00:00:32.587
Yes. You might remember in February, Jodie Power accused Mercedes Corby

00:00:32.587 --> 00:00:33.854
of being a bit of a druggie.

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:38.120
Well, Today Tonight are on Jodie's side.

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:41.280
And A Current Affair are on Mercedes's side.

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.354
And to represent these two, we've chosen these cheap, dim-witted dolls.

00:00:45.354 --> 00:00:50.447
Now, if you haven't seen her in the flesh before, Mercedes Corby looks like this.

00:00:50.813 --> 00:00:55.773
Here she is. Or, of course, if you watch Today Tonight, she looks like this.

00:00:55.773 --> 00:01:00.446
Yes, there she is. No doubt that's the most flattering footage Channel Seven could find.

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:08.000
Yes. And that very fair slow motion effect was used during an interview by host, Anna Coren.

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:13.394
(slowed down) This is a complete fabrication.

00:01:13.394 --> 00:01:14.813
Anna Coren, everyone.

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.980
You can understand why Today Tonight has it in for Mercedes,

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:21.253
because they have some very serious evidence backing up Jodie Power.

00:01:21.253 --> 00:01:25.681
Now, prepare yourself for these startling revelations from a Corby clan insider.

00:01:25.754 --> 00:01:29.034
He says he was stunned when Jodie Power spoke out

00:01:29.233 --> 00:01:32.273
he doesn't know her, but he does believe her.

00:01:32.793 --> 00:01:36.393
A guy who's never met Jodie Power? You're gone, Corby!

00:01:36.594 --> 00:01:41.794
Yes, it's impressive. But it's not who is, but is actually what that guy says

00:01:41.794 --> 00:01:43.675
that blows the whole case open.

00:01:43.675 --> 00:01:47.654
I don't know too much about Mercedes, but the truth about Schapelle...

00:01:47.979 --> 00:01:49.579
the truth is the truth.

00:01:51.853 --> 00:01:53.453
And tenuous is tenuous.

00:01:53.453 --> 00:01:58.553
But on top of all that hard evidence, they even put Jodie Power on a lie detector.

00:01:58.553 --> 00:02:01.914
Yep. Today Tonight are always chaining someone to something.

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:06.920
But for Mercedes, polygraph wasn't good enough. Oh, no. Oh, no.

00:02:06.922 --> 00:02:10.634
They savaged her with the most foolproof lie detection process known to man:

00:02:10.634 --> 00:02:15.674
Reading the body language of someone through a TV screen when you can't actually see their body.

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.480
Well, to be fair, Andrew, body language can be actually revealing of what a person actually thinks.

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:24.234
Today Tonight.

00:02:24.234 --> 00:02:27.854
By the way, here is the body language expert's conclusion.

00:02:27.854 --> 00:02:30.074
She says, "It's lies. It's lies."

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.160
Saying that she's not really on solid ground about what she's saying and believing what she's saying

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:37.594
When you're being honest and open about what you're saying and you believe it,

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:41.440
it would be "Lies. Lies." as opposed to "Lies? Lies?"

00:02:41.814 --> 00:02:44.854
Yes, you see, she spoke "like this, like this"

00:02:44.854 --> 00:02:46.994
therefore, not only is she a liar but so is this parrot.

00:02:47.234 --> 00:02:50.274
Polly want a cracker. Polly want a cracker.

00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:01.894
If speaking in the upper register makes you a liar, I wouldn't trust much of what this woman's saying.

00:03:01.894 --> 00:03:03.934
Just get the fucking camera out of my face, will ya?!

00:03:03.934 --> 00:03:05.494
Don't touch the cameras please.

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.700
Just get out so I can go get fucking dressed!

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:12.413
No, really, we shouldn't mock the body language guy.

00:03:12.413 --> 00:03:14.993
(rising inflection) It's not like he's full of shit.

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.040
Today Tonight aren't the only ones with body language experts.

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.280
It's Jodie's sudden eye movements that Janet Hall says are the giveaway.

00:03:24.533 --> 00:03:25.893
You moved your eyes.

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:30.800
Well, if moving your eyes is a problem, it really makes you wonder how sincere

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:34.180
Sylvester Stallone was being when he told ACA how much he likes Australia.

00:03:34.700 --> 00:03:36.640
And in Australia...

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:40.940
(inaudible)

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:53.000
So, after all that, what is the verdict?

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.900
Well, they're both infuriating bogans.

00:03:57.420 --> 00:04:00.720
The massive scandal in this whole thing was actually when Today Tonight lied

00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.214
to Merecedes so they could ambush her in this cafe.

00:04:03.214 --> 00:04:07.574
But what really touched my heart was the reason TT pulled out at the last minute.

00:04:07.574 --> 00:04:11.073
We didn't film anything with Mercedes because she had a baby with her.

00:04:11.073 --> 00:04:13.574
Any mother with a baby, of course you don't film them.

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:18.593
A baby? Is that all it takes to avoid being beaten up by Today Tonight?

00:04:18.593 --> 00:04:21.953
Yes, well, and we thought that information could come in very handy for the type of people

00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:23.240
Today Tonight usually target.

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:26.980
Hey, Muslim! Today Tonight's coming!

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:28.500
You need this baby now.

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:29.020
Good luck.

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:33.400
This lucky cat won't protect you. You need a baby.

00:04:33.413 --> 00:04:35.653
They're coming! They're coming!

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:41.120
Take this!

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:45.520
Hey, a bludger! Catch!

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:52.480
Beware, microbes! Helen Wellings is on the loose!

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:54.000
Save yourselves!
