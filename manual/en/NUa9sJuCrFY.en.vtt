Hi! Today I will show you how to make a gradient with a small sponge.

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:18.470
I’ve never tired with a sponge but it seems like it works pretty well.

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:24.230
I use a smooth and airy kind of moss that resists nail polish and remover.

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:29.990
I use tweezers to dip one corner of the moss in the nail polish so I don't have to dirty my fingers.

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.380
Then I use the sponge to do the gradient on my nail.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:38.310
If I don’t press too much on it, you won’t have much of a gradient.

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:45.480
To make a beautiful gradient, you should press hard on it and then put more nail polish on your sponge.

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.400
The more you press; the better gradient you'll get

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:52.660
because it'll take the nail polish off the sponge

00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:58.380
You should know that shaded tones done with a sponge dry very fast.

00:00:58.380 --> 00:01:00.380
Because it's a very thin coat of nail polish.

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:05.590
Let me show you one more time, you can of course make a gradient with several colors.

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:07.590
You can overlay them.

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:14.050
For example to make gradient, you can do it with many colors to obtain a base.

00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:19.180
So I’m using three colors.

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:27.190
So once again I dip one side of the sponge in a color and will use it to make the gradient.

00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:59.260
To clean the sponge, dip it in acetone.

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:07.130
Now I will show you another nail art design that I’ve done with a sponge.

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:12.160
It is gradient with two colors done in the same way.

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:17.120
Stamp the moss, then add a rhinestone and some top coat to finish it off

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.120
That’s it! Please subscribe to my channel for more tutorials like this every week! See you in another video!
