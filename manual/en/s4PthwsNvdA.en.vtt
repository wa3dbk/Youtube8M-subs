00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:12.120
While MMOs aren't their only bread and butter,
NCsoft are certainly well known for their

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:18.260
PC presence and when their attention swings
around to the iOS it's hard not to take notice.

00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:22.869
Gem Keeper is their first swing at gaming
on iDevices and much as you'd expect from

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:27.890
a company with this much clout, it's a visually
spectacular game to behold, but instead of

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:32.430
an expected RPG they've gone for the safe
bet of a tower defense game.

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.710
Thankfully Gem Keeper isn't entirely lost
in the melange of titles already available

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:41.520
as it introduces a 'rail' system, with towers
able to be positioned not only on fixed points

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:46.200
available around the map, but also on top
of special slots on a sliding rail.

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.580
The simple inclusion of such a system has
huge implications for the gameplay (especially

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:55.750
at higher levels) as players prioritize powerful
towers to these spots to manually move and

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:58.940
keep marauding monsters in range for as long
as possible.

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:03.080
There are three areas in the main campaign
mode, all designed to teach you how to operate

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:06.670
and get the most out of each new tower (currently
14 in total).

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:10.680
Aside from the usual set of towers, Gem Keeper
tries to mix things up by changing how they

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:17.040
feel - for instance, the typical 'linear piercing'
tower is replaced by a sort of explosive bowling-ball.

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:21.380
They're neat touches, but it's hard to shake
the feeling of having done all this before.

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:25.350
This may be in part thanks to the smooth way
in which the campaign progresses, making it

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.880
a perfect introduction to the genre for those
who are yet to dip their toes in to tower

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.320
defense games.

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:34.301
Three difficulties are on offer, with Easy
geared towards absolutely new players, while

00:01:34.301 --> 00:01:40.030
Normal and Hard scale things up appropriately
for return players or hardcore fans respectively.

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.340
The best that can be said of Gem Keeper is
that it's a highly polished tower defense

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:47.590
game - from its slick cartoonish designs that
are easy to distinguish, to the simple mix

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:51.440
of towers and level layouts that encourage
varied approaches for reaching that final

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:52.920
wave of creeps.

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.560
If you've had your fill of basic tower defense
games, Gem Keeper may not be up to your speed,

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.810
but it's definitely worth a look if you're
a hardcore fan after something a little different

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:14.770
or even a new player who wants to be eased
in slowly.
