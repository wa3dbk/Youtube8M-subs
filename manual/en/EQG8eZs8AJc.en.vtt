00:00:00.867 --> 00:00:02.667
- Let's talk about
the Affordable Care Act --

00:00:02.667 --> 00:00:04.066
also known as Obamacare --

00:00:04.066 --> 00:00:05.934
and what it means for you.

00:00:05.934 --> 00:00:07.667
Say you've got private
health insurance already.

00:00:07.667 --> 00:00:10.033
Maybe you have it through
your job or your parents.

00:00:10.033 --> 00:00:13.934
Obamacare means you get a host
of new benefits and protections.

00:00:13.934 --> 00:00:16.567
For example, insurance
companies are now required

00:00:16.567 --> 00:00:19.600
to cover women's wellness
visits, mammograms,

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:22.200
birth control for women,
immunizations for kids --

00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.300
all without charging
you a penny more.

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:27.233
That means no extra
copays or fees.

00:00:27.233 --> 00:00:29.133
Young adults can now stay
on their parents' plan

00:00:29.133 --> 00:00:31.200
until they turn 26.

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.333
Insurance companies can't
limit the amount of care

00:00:33.333 --> 00:00:35.767
they'll cover
over your lifetime.

00:00:35.767 --> 00:00:37.800
Also, if your
insurance company spends

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.600
more than 20 percent of your
premium dollars on overhead --

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.934
stuff like CEO salaries, marketing,

00:00:42.934 --> 00:00:44.433
administrative costs --

00:00:44.433 --> 00:00:48.467
they have to send you a refund 
for the difference.

00:00:48.467 --> 00:00:51.600
In January, that list of
benefits gets even longer.

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:52.600
It will be illegal

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.834
to charge you higher
premiums or refuse coverage

00:00:54.834 --> 00:00:57.700
because you get sick
or have been in the past.

00:00:57.700 --> 00:01:00.767
Charging women more than men
for the exact same coverage:

00:01:00.767 --> 00:01:03.100
also illegal.

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:06.200
No more deciphering page after
page of jargon-y paperwork

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:07.934
from your insurance
company to determine

00:01:07.934 --> 00:01:10.000
what they will or won't cover.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.800
Instead, you'll get a short, 
plain-language summary

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.467
of your benefits and coverage.

00:01:14.467 --> 00:01:15.633
Easy, right?

00:01:15.633 --> 00:01:18.367
You can learn more
at HealthCare.Gov.

00:01:18.367 --> 00:01:20.600
Okay, what about the folks
without health insurance

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:22.667
or people who buy
coverage on their own?

00:01:22.667 --> 00:01:24.633
Here's what Obamacare
has for you:

00:01:24.633 --> 00:01:26.200
a new, simple way

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:28.867
to buy affordable,
high-quality health insurance.

00:01:28.867 --> 00:01:31.934
Starting October 1st,
you can go to HealthCare.Gov

00:01:31.934 --> 00:01:33.800
and use the new
health insurance marketplace

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:36.033
to see all of the health plans 
available in your area

00:01:36.033 --> 00:01:39.000
and sign up for the one that
fits your needs and your budget.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:41.300
You can also find out
if you're eligible to pay less

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.867
for private health insurance
or whether you qualify

00:01:43.867 --> 00:01:46.266
for other free
or low-cost programs.

00:01:46.266 --> 00:01:49.367
All the plans in the marketplace
are required to cover a core set

00:01:49.367 --> 00:01:53.166
of essential health benefits --
doctor's visits, emergency care,

00:01:53.166 --> 00:01:56.734
prescriptions and lab tests,
rehab for illness or injury,

00:01:56.734 --> 00:01:58.033
mental health services;

00:01:58.033 --> 00:01:59.934
they all come standard.

00:01:59.934 --> 00:02:02.867
Plus, all those benefits and
protections available to people

00:02:02.867 --> 00:02:04.266
who already have insurance --

00:02:04.266 --> 00:02:05.700
no-cost preventive care,

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:08.000
coverage for
pre-existing conditions,

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.967
accountability for
insurance companies --

00:02:09.967 --> 00:02:11.266
you get all of that too.

00:02:11.266 --> 00:02:15.700
You can apply for marketplace
coverage four ways: online

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:20.834
at HealthCare.Gov, by mail,
on the phone, or in person.

00:02:20.834 --> 00:02:23.533
And open enrollment
starts October 1st.

00:02:23.533 --> 00:02:26.433
You can learn more right now
by visiting HealthCare.Gov

00:02:26.433 --> 00:02:31.400
or calling 1-800-318-2596.

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:32.834
So here's the bottom line.

00:02:32.834 --> 00:02:35.066
Whether you need health
coverage or you have it already,

00:02:35.066 --> 00:02:38.166
the Affordable Care Act offers
new rights and protections

00:02:38.166 --> 00:02:40.934
that make coverage fair
and easier to understand.
