00:00:03.969 --> 00:00:06.379
How to Cut Your Man’s Hair.

00:00:06.379 --> 00:00:08.780
Haircuts can cut a chunk out of any family’s
budget.

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:11.030
Learning to cut your man’s hair will save
you hundreds!

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:17.720
You will need A barber’s cape, bed sheet,
or a towel A fine-toothed comb Electric clippers

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:25.490
A spray bottle Haircutting scissors A mirror
A brave man and styling product.

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:27.689
Many haircutting tools can cause injury.

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.650
Pay attention when you are cutting.

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:30.650
Step 1.

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:34.450
Cover your man with a barber’s cape, bed
sheet, or towel to keep hair off him and to

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:35.580
make cleanup easier.

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:39.800
Detangle his hair by running a comb through
it.

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:40.800
Step 2.

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.360
Ask him how short he wants his hair.

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:46.500
Clippers come with blade-guard attachments
that determine the length of the hair that

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:47.500
gets cut.

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.830
The longer the attachment, the less hair gets
chopped.

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:51.830
Step 3.

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:55.830
Start at the back of his head: Holding the
clippers against his scalp, run them through

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:58.960
his hair from the nape of his neck about half
way up his head.

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:00.590
Work your way around the head.

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:02.900
Leave the top for the scissors.

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:03.900
Step 4.

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:06.790
Dampen the uncut hair using the spray bottle.

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:07.890
Step 5.

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.070
Trim the top.

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:14.210
Comb all the uncut hair forward; then, beginning
at the back and working forward, comb up a

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:16.000
half-inch section of hair.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.260
Hold it between your index and middle finger,
slide your fingers up to the length you want,

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:24.640
and snip the hair at an angle with haircutting
scissors so it won’t look blunt or uneven.

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:29.409
When cutting a new section of hair, always
take part of the just-cut section between

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:32.260
your fingers so you can use it as a length
guide.

00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:33.350
Step 6.

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:36.700
When you reach the front of his head, comb
his bangs down.

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:40.890
Holding the scissors vertically with the tips
pointing up, make little snips using the points

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:42.060
of the scissors.

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:44.370
Cut at an angle for better blending.

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:45.549
Step 7.

00:01:45.549 --> 00:01:49.880
Using the fine-tooth end of the comb, comb
upward at the point where the clipper cut

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.280
meets the scissor cut.

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.610
Use the scissors to trim the hair that pokes
out of the comb, blending away, or “fading,”

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:58.860
the harsh line that separates the clipper
cut from the scissor cut.

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.780
Work all the way around the head.

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:06.240
As you use the comb, hold it with the teeth
pointing straight up, making sure you aren’t

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:08.310
angling it toward or away from you.

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:09.590
Step 8.

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:13.870
Using the clippers without an attachment,
trim the neck and hair around his ears.

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.130
Trim his sideburns, stepping back occasionally
to look at him head-on and make sure they’re

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:19.130
even.

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:22.670
Start at the top and work the clippers downward
so you don’t clip too high.

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:23.760
Step 9.

00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.840
Let your man see your handiwork in the mirror
and make any final touches to the cut.

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.640
Add styling products if desired.

00:02:29.640 --> 00:02:37.060
Did you know Tran Van Hay, a Vietnamese man
in his seventies, has hair over 20 feet long!
