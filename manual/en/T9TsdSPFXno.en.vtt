00:00:02.900 --> 00:00:05.900
Green Ninja! Green Ninja!
Teaching kids to keep it clean!

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:08.800
Green Ninja! Green Ninja!
Needs to build a ninja team!

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:11.500
Green Ninja! Green Ninja!
Bicycling, Recycling!

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:15.800
Green Ninja! Green Ninja!
Never going to stop until we do this thing!

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.179
Green Ninja!

00:00:18.179 --> 00:00:23.000
On this episode of the Green Ninja show,
Barnaby from Kona, Hawaii asks:

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:31.500
What's up with all the styrofoam, man?

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.000
Styrofoam Man?!

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.720
I'll tell you about Styrofoam Man!

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.720
From my modest beginnings,
I knew I was destined for greatness.

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:56.000
Styrofoam Man would take over the world.

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:56.789
My influence started small...
but my presence grew greater by the day.

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:08.000
Even when they threw me away,
I never really disappeared.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.000
Soon, I was everywhere. I had them all.

00:02:58.580 --> 00:03:01.500
Not even the Green Ninja could stop me.

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:06.000
He tried using compostable containers,
paper packaging...

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.810
But he couldn't handle me alone.

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:12.000
I was unstoppable.

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:43.070
My rein had spread worldwide.
There was nowhere I hadn't reached.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.520
But then... he showed up again!

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:30.000
And this time... he wasn't alone!

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:47.000
These bans started bringing people against me
city by city. I started to lose my grip.

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:09.000
Now... they even talking about throwing me
out over an entire state!

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000
We hear you, man.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000
We're here for you, buddy.

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000
We've been there, man.

00:05:51.000 --> 00:06:10.000
