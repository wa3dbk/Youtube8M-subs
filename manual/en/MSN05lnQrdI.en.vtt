00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:06.569
If your child’s eczema is frequently infected,
your child’s dermatologist may recommend

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:08.780
bleach bath therapy.

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:13.470
Regular short soaks in diluted bleach can
better maintain control of eczema by reducing

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:15.910
the number of bacteria on the skin.

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:20.109
Always ask a dermatologist before adding bleach
to your child’s bath water.

00:00:20.109 --> 00:00:25.009
If your child’s dermatologist recommends
bleach bath therapy, follow these steps.

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:27.980
To begin, gather the following supplies:

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:30.970
A measuring cup if you are using a regular
bathtub.

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:35.700
If you are using a baby or toddler bathtub,
you will need a measuring spoon instead.

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:41.160
Also obtain ordinary household chlorine bleach
that does not have an added scent.

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:44.460
Make sure the bleach is regular strength: 6 percent.

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.560
Do not use concentrated bleach.

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:50.550
Using a measuring cup or measuring spoon is
essential.

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:55.050
Adding too much bleach to the bath can irritate
your child’s already sensitive skin.

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.290
If you add too little, the bleach bath may
not help.

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:01.310
Here’s how much bleach you should use.

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:05.050
For a full bathtub of water, you’ll need
a half cup of bleach.

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:08.729
If you’ll fill the tub half way, measure
out a quarter cup of bleach.

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.760
For a tub filled with less water, such as
a baby or toddler bathtub, add 1 teaspoon

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:16.280
of bleach per gallon of water.

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.299
Always measure the amount of bleach before
adding it to the water.

00:01:20.299 --> 00:01:24.190
Never apply bleach directly to your child’s eczema.

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:27.799
Take care not to spill the bleach on your
child or yourself.

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:32.009
Now that you have the right amount of bleach,
it’s time to fill the tub.

00:01:32.009 --> 00:01:35.939
While the tub is filling, pour the bleach
from the measuring cup or measuring spoon

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:37.439
into the water.

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:42.280
Be sure to wait until the bath is fully drawn and bleach is poured before your child enters the tub.

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:47.929
Have your child soak in the tub for 5 to 10
minutes.

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:50.990
Remove your child from the tub, and pat your
child dry.

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:54.680
Use white towels if you are concerned about
bleach stains.

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:59.909
If your child needs eczema medication applied
immediately after a bath, apply the medicine.

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:03.799
Then moisturize your child’s skin.

00:02:03.799 --> 00:02:08.979
Bleach baths can be helpful for many children
who have moderate to severe eczema.

00:02:08.979 --> 00:02:13.400
If your child’s dermatologist recommends
bleach baths, ask the dermatologist how often

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.189
a bleach bath should be given.

00:02:15.189 --> 00:02:19.830
It’s important to see a board-certified
dermatologist before starting bleach bath

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:21.300
therapy.

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:25.030
Your child’s dermatologist can tell you
whether bleach baths may help relieve your

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:27.650
child’s eczema.

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:32.349
