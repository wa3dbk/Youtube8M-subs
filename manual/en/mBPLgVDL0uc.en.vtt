Hi! I am Melanie McLeroy with Taurus Training
for Expert Village and today we are going

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.220
to talk about training dogs. A very important
subject is how to properly give commands.

00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:09.690
Many people give commands in a way that really
undermines the relationship with their dog

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.639
and confuses them as well. In other words,
when you ask your dog to sit, don’t say

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:14.469
sit, sit, sit, sit, Rex sit, sit, sit. As
you can see from Zuke’s expression, that

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:17.460
can be kind of confusing. Instead, there are
basically five guidelines to follow when you

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.000
are giving commands. The first one is use
to a calm confident tone of voice; there is

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:29.320
no reason to yell. If you yell at your dog,
if you yell at your kid, yell at your spouse,

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:32.770
it actually undermines your authority. The
way you give a command can really set the

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:39.750
tone for how you want your relationship with
your dog to be. So be calm and quiet. The

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:45.030
second principle is to not repeat the command
over and over. Then your dog thinks its sit,

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.510
sit, sit, name, sit, name, sit and they finally
do it on the seventh or eighth time, you want

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:51.720
it to be immediate. The third principle is
to set your dog up to succeed. If you are

00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:55.050
taking your new puppy to the park and there
are children running around, don’t ask her

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.430
to sit, it’s just too exciting. Instead
work slowly and incrementally and get your

00:00:57.430 --> 00:01:02.310
dog ready to handle those really high distraction
situations. The fourth principle is to be

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:07.430
very, very quick. The second, your dog performs
the command, you want to mark it with a word

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:11.560
or a sound something special that communicates
to your dog that they did the right thing

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:15.850
and that there is a reward coming. Now this
word or sound just needs to be short, bright

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:19.810
and happy. Some people use a clicker. I like
to use the word good, but said in a special

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:24.190
way. Sit. Good. Some people use yup, some
people use yes, it does not matter and the

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:28.460
important thing is to be very consistent.
The importance of this word is that it acts

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:33.941
as a bridge between the action and the possibility
of a reward. Finally make sure that your dog

00:01:33.941 --> 00:01:38.480
performs on your terms instead of hers. If
you say sit or down and it takes your dog

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:42.650
five minutes to perform the command, they
are testing you. You need to figure out a

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:47.380
way to motivate them to move a little bit
more quickly. If you tell your dog to sit,

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:52.270
and she always flops into a down, she is waiting
to see what you are going to do about it.

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:58.420
Just like kids our dogs try to figure out
what they can do to push our buttons. There

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:02.810
is nothing spiteful about it; it is just what
they do. So let us review those; do not yell,

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:06.840
do not repeat, set your dog up to succeed,
be very quick to mark that your dog did the

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.789
right thing and finally make sure your dog
is working on your terms instead of theirs.
