00:00:05.089 --> 00:00:09.170
I wonder if there's any food left in the cities?

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:12.429
Can you forget about food for one second?

00:00:12.429 --> 00:00:16.500
What else is there to think about? I don't
want to think about dying. I'm reminded of that every day.

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:18.000
We still have a lot of food here.

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:19.000
Where?

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:24.900
You think when the supplies run out we're
going to eat grass?

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:26.000
Have you lost your mind?

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:34.530
Think about it. The women are important - they'll
get eaten last. Even doc over here is useful.

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:45.000
You? You're a bad runner. The brat, Elza,
will probably be the first course, but you

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
won't be far behind.

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:51.930
Prattler, you've gone completely insane. You
plan to eat people alive?

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:58.590
What if? Tattered do it and they're ok.

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.000
And you've already lowered yourselves to their
level?

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:15.000
Foureyes. Wipe your broken glasses. Maybe
you'll see something new. I wiped mine -- and

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:26.400
it's all clear -- we'll be dead if not today,
tomorrow. If we're lucky from a bullet, if

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.100
not from the tattered.

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.500
Luck is just a mix of coincidences.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.100
And is there no God?

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:36.500
No.

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:47.800
So if I kill you now, then rape your brat,
then fry her for my dinner, there'll be no

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.100
consequences for me?

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.500
There will be. But not from God.

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:11.800
And what would happen to me? What will you
do?

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.500
I'll kill you!

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.500
Wow! You grew some balls?

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000
Chill out, smartass. No one's going to eat
you here.

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:32.000
Going to take a leak.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
What use is this bastard?

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:51.000
Prattler is the best camp guard. He's god
when it comes to bombs and mines. He fixed that whole building.

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:54.100
That's no excuse.

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:59.100
Shut the fuck up. Our lives were saved a lot
by Prattler's mines.

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.000
And because of we lostone of ours.

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:02.500
No big loss.

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:04.400
Don't you dare demonstrate your character
here, or...

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:06.200
Or what?

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:07.500
Or this.

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:08.500
What?

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.700
What?

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:11.500
Here, eat something.

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:18.400
Go on, eat.

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:21.200
Have some food, you won't be so angry with
food in you.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.500
Thank you.

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:33.200
Don't thank me, Doc. Alex is right. We're
simple people, no philosophy. They want to kill us -- we don't want to die.

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:36.300
So stick
your opinions where the sun don't shine. And don't show off.

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:46.200
It's tasty...

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000
Dan, stop bother him.

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:56.000
Fools
