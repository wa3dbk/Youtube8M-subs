00:00:00.909 --> 00:00:03.889
There are many ways to prepare tofu scramble.

00:00:03.889 --> 00:00:06.660
Most people include vegetables in theirs,
but I don't.

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.509
I didn't make scrambled eggs with vegetables
so it doesn't make a lot of sense to me.

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:19.180
Anyway, I always use my extra firm tofu and
press it for an hour using my Tofu Xpress's.

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:28.390
While my blocks of tofu are pressing, I combine
the dry seasonings.

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:35.870
I ended up using Vegan Dad's wife's recipe
and Dr. Neal Barnard's recipe and really like

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:38.170
the combination of spices.

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:42.989
The exact measurements are on my website which
is linked in the description box.

00:00:42.989 --> 00:00:48.829
I've also provided links to the original recipes
there too.

00:00:48.829 --> 00:00:57.649
I used onion powder, garlic powder, turmeric,
pepper, seasoned salt, parsley, nutritional

00:00:57.649 --> 00:00:59.610
yeast and cayenne pepper.

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:08.190
Yes, a lot :)
After an hour, I drained my tofu, crumbled

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:13.570
it into the bowl with the seasonings and stirred
it well to make sure all of the tofu was evenly

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:16.290
coated.

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.570
I heated my skillet and added a little oil.

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:21.590
Then added the tofu.

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:28.180
I like to cook the tofu until some of it browns.

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:31.630
I don't like my tofu soft and mushy.

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:35.680
While it's cooking, I combined soy milk and
dijon mustard.

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:42.700
Then, I pour that over the tofu and cook it
until all of the liquid has been absorbed.

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:43.700
And that's it.

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:48.560
It's a little different from many of the other
tofu scramble recipes around, but I think

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.950
you'll like the flavor once you try it.

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:54.400
The complete recipe is on vegancookingwithlove.com.

00:01:54.400 --> 00:02:00.370
If you try it, please come back and tell me
what you thought in the comments.

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:02.090
Thanks and I'll see you next time.
