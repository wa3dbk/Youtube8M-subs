00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:09.100
"Atlas" with Atlas and Zeus Promotions,

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:11.000
and FoodChallenges.com

00:00:11.834 --> 00:00:18.234
I am down in Ridgeland, Mississippi at Burger &amp; Blues, taking on their Whammy Burger Challenge.

00:00:18.234 --> 00:00:24.394
Now I've been nervous for the past two days.  There's a 30 minute time limit, and if you can finish

00:00:24.394 --> 00:00:29.802
the three pounds of meat, all these vegetables, the pound of fries, and the 16 ounce shake

00:00:29.802 --> 00:00:33.960
in under 30 minutes, you get it free, a t-shirt, and you'll get up on their wall of fame.

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:37.540
but if you beat the record you'll get the jackpot.

00:00:37.953 --> 00:00:43.313
The record by my friend, Stephanie is 15:25.  If I beat that, the jackpot ($1500).

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.120
Lets get win #183!

00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:02.460
Lets give him another round of applause!  We are going to count down from five!

00:01:05.774 --> 00:01:07.934
Five, four, three, two, one, go!

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:18.620
4:30 - all the meat is gone!  Lets get these veggies!

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:15.500
Hey everybody!  I want to thank you guys!  That was a big win.  I just defeated the Whammy Burger Challenge.

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:22.780
My official time was 15:16.  I'm with the general manager, and he's going to give me my prize!

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:34.100
He won a free t-shirt, will be on our "Whammy Wall" and $1500!  And the meal free!
