Hey, it’s Marie Forleo and you are watching
MarieTV, the place to be to create a business

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:25.600
and life you love, and today I have got a
question for you. Have you ever walked away

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:30.300
from a really good thing whether it was a
business that was making money, a high paying

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:36.030
job that you were pretty good at or a relationship
that was cruising along just fine? I know

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.359
I have and it wasn’t easy, but here's the
deal. Sometimes the only way to create what

00:00:40.359 --> 00:00:46.199
you really want means walking away from the
sure thing you already have. Before we dive

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:51.039
into this, I want to share a little line from
Jim Collins, the author of the classic book

00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:53.200
Good to Great. Jim says:

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:58.539
“Good is the enemy of great and is why so
many things don't become great. We don't have

00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:03.110
really great schools because we have good
schools. We don't have great companies because

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:04.670
we have so many good ones…

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:09.680
…And when we look back over a life and see
if it is a great one, we don't see many -- because

00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:12.540
it's just so easy to settle for a good one.”

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:16.750
Now if we unpack this a bit we'll see that
there's two main factors that keep us trapped

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:21.170
in good land.

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:28.610
1. Comfort – whether it's a certain amount
of money that you're used to making or a warm

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:32.360
body next to you when you're watching Game
of Thrones, sometimes it's hard to walk away

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.430
from the sure thing you already have because
you're not sure if you're going to find something

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:39.520
out there that's better to fill the void.

00:01:39.520 --> 00:02:04.310
2. O.P.E. (Other People’s Expectations)
– tough to ignore, but fun to dance to.

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:08.550
The reason OPE is so hard to break free from
is because we don't want to disappoint people,

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:11.959
we don't want to let them down and of course
we don't want to rock the boat, but if you

00:02:11.959 --> 00:02:16.409
want to shift anything from good to great
you've got to be willing to shake some shizz

00:02:16.409 --> 00:02:21.849
up, which is exactly what I had to do when
I walked away from over $1 million in revenue.

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:26.880
Yes people were disappointed and yes people
thought I was crazy pants; a little side note,

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:34.129
if people think you're crazy pants, you are
probably wearing the right pants.

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:38.140
Here's the story. Back in the day I had two
awesome programs; one was an annual conference

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:42.450
that we held at Donna Karan's Urban Sense
Center and the other was a year-long mentorship

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:47.269
and travel program called Adventure Mastermind.
Both of these programs sold out each year

00:02:47.269 --> 00:02:51.010
with a waiting list. They were fun, they were
life-changing, and they were like nothing

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:56.420
else on the market, and they were both really
profitable. However, I was having this inner

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:00.400
tug inside that it was time for me to clear
the decks and work on new projects that would

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:05.579
allow me to change as many lives as possible.
I'm not going to front; this was not easy

00:03:05.579 --> 00:03:11.549
to do: A - $1 million is a lot of freaking
money, and B - I love what I do, and it was

00:03:11.549 --> 00:03:15.590
hard for me to disappoint so many people who
wanted to take those programs but then wouldn't

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:20.310
have a chance to. So I couldn't deny what
I knew to be true which was that it was time

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:23.219
for me to walk away. And that's what I did.

00:03:23.219 --> 00:03:28.459
Now check this out. About a week or so after
I decided to take those programs off the market,

00:03:28.459 --> 00:03:35.220
I got a call from Oprah's folks to be on Super
Soul Sunday. Coincidence? Maybe, or maybe

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:39.420
it was meant to be because you can't have
really amazing stuff show up in your life

00:03:39.420 --> 00:03:41.750
if you don't have room for it.

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:44.379
Let's wrap this up with a few things to keep
in mind:

00:03:44.379 --> 00:03:50.010
First of all we always say that if it ain't
broke, don't fix it, but if it ain’t broke

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:54.669
it doesn't mean that you should keep it. Furthermore,
things don't have to be crashing and burning

00:03:54.669 --> 00:03:58.700
around you in order for you to walk away.
You can leave on a high note, things don't

00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:01.189
have to get dramatic and they don't have to
get crazy.

00:04:01.189 --> 00:04:06.900
Second, as Jim Collins said, “Good is the
enemy of great. Complacency can be a curse,

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:08.579
so watch out for it.”

00:04:08.579 --> 00:04:13.720
And the final thing to remember, and yes you
can tweet this:

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:20.670
“It takes courage to begin something, but
it can take even more to end it.”

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:25.660
So now, I'd really love to hear from you.
What should be cut loose in your life? Is

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:29.690
there something that you're ready to let go
of, or maybe you're afraid to let go of that's

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:33.490
good, but it's keeping you from something
that's create? Maybe it's a revenue stream,

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:38.000
a relationship or something else. Leave a
comment and let me know.

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.870
