Hi, I’m Chad, I’ve been talking a little
bit about sport bikes and we’re going to

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:09.210
talk a little bit now about choosing a sport
bike. As I’ve said with sport bikes, they’re

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:15.210
racing machines and they’re basically toned
down for the street, and there’s some differences

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:20.150
between motor and seating. And it’s important
to make a decision about what you’re looking

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:25.051
for in a bike when you choose a sport bike.
A sport bike needs to fit. And they’re all

00:00:25.051 --> 00:00:31.640
really great, every brand is really a fine
piece of machinery. But each one will feel

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:38.430
a little different. Basically, the way your
legs will fit on, how you reach to the handles,

00:00:38.430 --> 00:00:43.630
how low the handles are, how high the seat
is, the shape of the seat, the width of the

00:00:43.630 --> 00:00:46.890
seat- there’s a lot of different feels,
it’s all feel. And it’s critically important

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.710
because you control your bike with your body
position. You need to be able to hold on to

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:56.739
the tank and have your feet in the right place
so that you can ride the bike effectively.

00:00:56.739 --> 00:00:59.789
So when you choose a bike, the best thing
to do really is go down to the dealership

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:03.660
and sit on all of them. See what feels the
best, what makes you feel comfortable on the

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.350
bike, you’re locked into the bike. Also
important is to make sure they have the bike

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.250
that you’ re looking for. Do you want a
more twitchy race bike? Or do you want a bike

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:19.810
that’s a little bit more adapted to the
street. Also, size is very important. Starting

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:25.490
out at one thousand for a sport bike is probably
not a good idea unless you’ve been riding

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:30.229
bikes, other kinds of bikes, for a long time.
Six hundreds, even, can be very, very powerful,

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:33.840
very hard to handle, if you haven’t any
experience. But if you’re stepping to the

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.490
sport bike experience, you’ve already been
doing some riding, six hundred’s a really

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:43.369
great place to start. They’ve got a lot
of power, lot of good handling. But yet, they

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:47.350
don’t allow you to quite get into trouble
as quickly as a one thousand would with as

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:51.200
much power as they have. That’s basically
the importance, or the important points, of

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:56.570
picking out. How it fits, how you feel on
it, whether the bike is the kind of bike that

00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:59.750
you’re looking for, and if it’s the size
that you’re comfortable with and it does

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:04.649
what you want it to do. Just as important
as picking out, and always remember your gear-

00:02:04.649 --> 00:02:05.500
it’s as important as you bike.
