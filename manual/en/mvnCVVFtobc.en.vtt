00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.879
We are in Malacca right now and it is nighttime
so we are about to head over to Jonker Street

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:14.210
where they have one of the biggest night markets
I have ever seen.

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:24.079
It is a great place to find food and go shopping,
so let's head over there.

00:00:24.079 --> 00:00:52.170
What are you eating right now?

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.920
There is nothing better to do at the night
market, the Jonker street night market, than

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.519
to indulge in street food.

00:00:58.519 --> 00:01:01.910
We've got a refreshing little dish right down
here - take a look at it.

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:07.543
There are different kinds of jellies and beans
and shaved ice with some sweet coconut milk

00:01:07.543 --> 00:01:08.543
and cane syrup.

00:01:08.543 --> 00:01:11.770
Is it ever good!

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:23.560
It is the perfect way to beat the heat.

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:26.659
Right here we've ordered something called
a carrot cake.

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:32.090
I am not seeing any carrots so far but it
looks really tasty.

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:36.209
It smells good.

00:01:36.209 --> 00:01:37.369
Is it good?

00:01:37.369 --> 00:01:39.969
How would you describe it?

00:01:39.969 --> 00:01:43.479
I would say it is like a Pad Thai without
the noodles.

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:49.930
You have the bean sprouts, you have a little
bit of tofu and some egg and peanuts.

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:50.930
I don't know where the carrot name comes from.

00:01:50.930 --> 00:02:22.900
I just bought some sugarcane juice - it is
really sweet and refreshing and I love that

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:53.349
they gave us lots of ice.

00:02:53.349 --> 00:03:08.570
It is perfect.

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:54.250
It is perfect for a hot night like this.
