00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:04.990
ï»¿Today I am looking over a product known
as Grill Grates, it is an interlocking cooking

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:11.040
system, it is pretty cool, there are two different
types; there are porcelain coated steel and

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:15.410
hard anodized. Which is what I am holding
on to today, they interlock in the center,

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:20.850
as you can see, they don't pull apart. You
can cook on them either this way for an excellent

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:27.660
sear, no flare up, you can also cook on it
this way. This is a pretty cool little deal.

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:34.280
The hard anodized, which would be my personal
pick and my favorite. You can cook to a thousand

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:39.920
degrees Fahrenheit, on the hard anodized and
on the porcelain coated one you can cook up

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:44.141
to about six hundred degrees, which is still
pretty high, but I like the hard anodized.

00:00:44.141 --> 00:00:51.800
I picked up a nice fresh piece of tuna today
and we are going to see how grill grates performs

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:57.680
with a nice piece of fish. The tuna has been
on, probably for about a minute or so, let's

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:07.470
see what it looks like. That is a perfect
sear, I don't know if you can see that? We

00:01:07.470 --> 00:01:13.590
will give it a little forty five degree turn.
The Grill Grate tool that comes with it, this

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:18.369
little spatula that I have, it is pretty neat
because it is set up to go in between the

00:01:18.369 --> 00:01:23.979
grates. And then, if you have been cooking
a bunch and you are looking to clean your

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:29.659
grates out, there are these little tips on
the end, you turn it this way and scrape everything

00:01:29.659 --> 00:01:38.819
out and you are good to go. Let's see what
this is looking like. I would say that Grill

00:01:38.819 --> 00:01:43.409
Grates turns out an excellent looking piece
of fish, with perfect sear marks. In just

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:46.430
a second, I will get some vegetable planks
on there and we will see how it performs with

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:51.359
vegetables. Instead of picking a common vegetable
for grilling, I decided to go with one that

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:58.319
sometimes has a little bit harder time on
a round cooking grate, so that I could see

00:01:58.319 --> 00:02:04.049
how well it performs; so we are going to do
some eggplant. You can turn the eggplant very

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:11.760
nicely. It does not stick very much and it
is not tearing, that is a tough trick on the

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.720
grill, so this is a pretty nice deal for vegetables,
definitely. I believe I would have to give

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:24.140
Grill Grates high marks as an excellent performer.
You can see the way it dealt with tuna and

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:30.960
with eggplant, then the basics should be no
fuss at all for Grill Grates. I hope you enjoyed

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:35.870
the grilling tests with Grill Grates, I think
they performed better than I even expected

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:40.590
and I think it is a very fine product. I have
to give it high marks and I hope you guys

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.020
will try it out and let me know what you think.
