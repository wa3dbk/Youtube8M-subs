00:00:06.163 --> 00:00:10.697
To create a new HTML document, launch Notepad++.

00:00:11.576 --> 00:00:15.701
In the ITS Training Program computer labs, click the Start button,

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.750
point to All Programs,

00:00:19.916 --> 00:00:22.416
 point to Notepad++,

00:00:22.708 --> 00:00:25.292
and select Notepad++.

00:00:26.125 --> 00:00:30.708
If the text area is not blank, click 
 the New button on the Tool bar.

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.450
Click the File menu and select Save As.

00:00:39.417 --> 00:00:41.667
The Save As dialog box will appear.

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:46.750
In the File name box, type index.html.

00:00:46.999 --> 00:00:52.332
We name the file index.html to set it as 
 the default home page for our website

00:00:53.625 --> 00:00:58.583
Click the Save as type arrow and select All types (*.*) from the list.

00:01:04.374 --> 00:01:08.499
Click the Desktop button in the left pane of the Save As dialog box.

00:01:09.875 --> 00:01:12.083
Click the Create New Folder button,

00:01:13.375 --> 00:01:16.915
name the new folder Website, and then press the Enter key.

00:01:19.666 --> 00:01:22.292
Double-click the newly created folder to open it.

00:01:22.875 --> 00:01:25.582
and then click the Save button.

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:30.750
Now that we have created the HTML file, let’s add some code to it.

00:01:30.833 --> 00:01:34.125
Pay close attention to the indentation as seen on screen.

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:37.498
Indentation doesn’t directly affect the outcome of the page,

00:01:37.498 --> 00:01:39.426
but it makes things a lot easier to read.

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:42.540
To indent, we use the Tab key.

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:46.420
With index.html opened in Notepad++,

00:01:46.417 --> 00:01:55.000
type &lt;!doctype html&gt; at the top of the page,

00:01:55.333 --> 00:01:57.880
no closing tag is required for this tag.

00:01:58.792 --> 00:02:02.250
This doctype statement tells the web browser how to read the code.

00:02:02.458 --> 00:02:08.170
In this case, this statement is telling Mozilla 
 Firefox that we are using HTML 5.

00:02:09.083 --> 00:02:11.710
Press the Enter key to create a new line.

00:02:14.625 --> 00:02:27.020
Next, type &lt;html lang="en"&gt;

00:02:29.333 --> 00:02:36.120
and then create the closing tag by typing &lt;/html&gt;.

00:02:36.917 --> 00:02:43.920
Click In-between the two tags and press enter a couple 
 of times to make some space In-between them.

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:59.380
In-between of our opening and closing HTML tags, type 
 &lt;head&gt; and close it by typing &lt;/head&gt;.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:07.710
In-between these two tags, press enter a couple times to add some room.

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:16.220
In-between of the head tags that we just created, we 
 can add an opening and closing title tag,

00:03:16.292 --> 00:03:26.080
To add a title tag, type &lt;title&gt; then close it with &lt;/title&gt;.

00:03:27.375 --> 00:03:29.620
In-between the title tag we just created,

00:03:30.041 --> 00:03:32.420
type "HTML Workshop".

00:03:33.167 --> 00:03:37.330
This title will appear at the top of 
 the window when our webpage is open.

00:03:38.374 --> 00:03:44.970
Place the cursor at the end of the line we just created 
 and press the Enter key to create a new line.

00:03:46.833 --> 00:03:52.420
Underneath the title tags, we can add a meta tag that 
 will tell our browser what character encoding we are using.

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:58.290
Type, &lt;meta /&gt;. 

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:02.850
This tag is a self-closing tag and doesn’t require a full closing tag.

00:04:05.874 --> 00:04:09.790
Next, we are going to add what is 
 called an attribute to our meta tag.

00:04:10.374 --> 00:04:13.210
Immediately before the slash of the self-closing tag, 

00:04:13.416 --> 00:04:21.040
type charset=”utf-8” follow by a space.

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:24.850
This is an attribute that modifies the way the tag works.

00:04:25.083 --> 00:04:27.170
We’ll get into them more in a later video.

00:04:29.083 --> 00:04:33.830
Next, we need to create a new line underneath the closing head tag.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.420
To create a new line,

00:04:35.583 --> 00:04:42.750
place the cursor at the end of the line that contains 
 the closing head tag, and press the Enter key.

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:50.290
Finally, on our newly created line, create the opening and closing body tags. 

00:04:50.833 --> 00:04:59.670
Type, &lt;body&gt; then close it by typing &lt;/body&gt;.

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:04.710
In-between these body tags is where all of our visible content will be.

00:05:05.082 --> 00:05:10.670
Everything inside of the head tag will not 
 be visible on a normal web page.
