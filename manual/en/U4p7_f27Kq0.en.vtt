00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:03.940
This is is the best surprise ever

00:00:04.660 --> 00:00:06.040
Nobody thought we'd ever win this!

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:15.460
It's hard to explain actually to be honest with you 
I really don't want to go back down

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:19.920
you're just like "oh my goodness, we actually are here" it was really good

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.460
my name is Captain Kelsey Penner and I'm a nursing officer in the Canadian Armed Forces

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:26.880
Corporal Kate Mara, Heather Demchek
Courtney Skinner, Lindsey Williams

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:30.780
grew up in a military family
I play for the seventeen wing rondelles hockey team

00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:36.750
I showed up to a game and they're like
okay so you guys are top 3 and we're just gonna videotape your game

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.019
and then they were like so we have some bad news...
so you guys aren't the top three

00:00:41.019 --> 00:00:48.019
and we're like aww and then they were like "you won!"

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:15.240
well I'm from the prairies... The feeling of
looking around looking at the mountains was awesome

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.160
and then we turned that corner and the rink showed up

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:25.160
everything became real

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.700
I wouldn't just call it a hockey fan
paradise, but I would call it a Canadian hockey fan paradise

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:41.840
its probably the best day I've had to this point in my life

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:44.380
it's hard to explain actually to be honest with you

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.160
it was just excellent

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:51.880
once in a lifetime opportunity and I'm really glad that I got to experience this with all these great girls

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:57.120
to be somewhere like this on our own
soil that is just such an absolutely incredible place

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:00.400
playing this phenomenal game that is such an incredible part of our culture

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:04.780
We'll never have an experience like this again so we're just super proud to be here
