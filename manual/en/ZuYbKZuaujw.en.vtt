A lot of new business when they get started
online with advertising they always worry

00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:09.280
or are concerned about how much money they
should spend online with advertising. Like,

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:13.380
what is that advertising going to produce
for me is it going to be a waste of money

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:18.610
or am I going to just be throwing money down
the toilet whatever it is, so in this episode

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:25.610
let's talk about your budget, your advertising
budget.

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:35.569
Welcome to Insider Internet Success, in this
video I have a question from our subscriber

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:40.409
Hamil Sha who owns a pharmacy in the UK, and
he says: "How do you work out the best spend

00:00:40.409 --> 00:00:45.530
on Google Adwords?" How do you know how much
money to be putting in your advertising?

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:50.530
Here's the thing, if you are setting up an
advert online, and you already have a website

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:54.619
and on that website you are selling a product
for a hundred dollars or a hundred pounds

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:59.279
and out of every hundred visitors you that
send to your website one of them buys. That

00:00:59.279 --> 00:01:04.140
means for every hundred persons, you get a
hundred pounds, so then if you would put a

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.000
hundred pounds into advertising you would
break even, you wouldn't make any money. You

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.890
put hundred pounds into advertising you get
a hundred visitors let's say, and then you

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:18.530
have one person buy and you make a hundred
pounds. It's very unlikely for that to happen,

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:22.219
when you spend a hundred pounds you'd get
a lot more clicks than just a hundred clicks

00:01:22.219 --> 00:01:26.210
so let's just say that for easy sake.
So that means that if you don't yet have a

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.789
conversion on your site you first need to
test a conversion on your site, and the way

00:01:29.789 --> 00:01:33.810
to figure out your conversion on your site
with advertising is to start very slow. The

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.759
ultimate thing is testing, I would set up
an ad I would 5 or 10 pounds a day on your

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:43.210
ad to see how many clicks it's giving you
and out of all the clicks that you're getting

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:49.270
on your site, how many sales are you getting?
Or let's say you do 10 pounds or 10 dollars

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:56.270
a day for 5 days, that is 50 pounds and out
of that 50 pounds you get a thousand clicks.

00:01:56.639 --> 00:02:01.439
Out of that thousand clicks how many of them
are buying? Are you getting 10 sales? Are

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:07.920
you getting 5 sales or 4 sales? Then you work
out what it's costing you per click if you

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.209
like, or how many clicks it is taking to get
you a sale and then you work out how much

00:02:12.209 --> 00:02:16.599
in total you have received in sales and how
much you have spent on the ads and you work

00:02:16.599 --> 00:02:20.879
out if you got a profit. If you got a profit
you keep doing it.

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:25.659
Now the way Google Adwords and other advertising
platforms like Facebook advertising works

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:31.510
is the more time you stick with that same
ad, the cheaper it becomes, the cheaper the

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:36.489
cost per click becomes. Your job is to keep
improving the cost per click by getting it

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:41.790
to decrease. If you have your cost per click
decrease it means you are getting more clicks

00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.379
out of the money that you're spending. If
you are getting more clicks to your website

00:02:45.379 --> 00:02:48.049
it is very likely that you're going to get
more sales right?

00:02:48.049 --> 00:02:51.840
So down to your question, "How much money
do I spend on Google Adwords or any other

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.810
advertising platform?"; is first you need
a test there's no way to know without testing,

00:02:55.810 --> 00:03:00.349
because everybody's products and services
are different and if they're not different,

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:04.650
everybody's website and the way they set up
their website is different. So ultimately

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:09.470
what you need to do is start testing, and
start testing small, start testing at 5 or

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:13.989
10 ten pounds or 10 dollars a day, do that
for a week then get your results and analyze

00:03:13.989 --> 00:03:18.590
your results how many actions are you getting?
How many clicks and sales and revenue are

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:22.849
you producing from this? If they don't buy
immediately how are you capturing those visitors?

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:27.700
What are your visitor costs?
All these things can be worked out in one

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:32.069
week, the second week you can wrap up your
advertising, and so forth the third, fourth

00:03:32.069 --> 00:03:35.849
and fifth week, until you are spending a good
amount of money and producing a good amount

00:03:35.849 --> 00:03:40.840
of sales. Every single day this will happen,
then you don't have to do anything else you

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:45.299
just have to rely on the adverts really.
So the simple thing is to test start with

00:03:45.299 --> 00:03:49.390
10 dollars a day and be really specific about
who you are testing, get some results and

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:52.829
then it's all easy.
Now if you would like my help to sit down

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:57.739
with you and strategize a campaign for ads
or for setting up getting visitors from ads,

00:03:57.739 --> 00:04:01.750
if anybody would like some help on that we
can sit down and talk about how specifically

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:05.310
you could use ads to get visitors and how
you could look at your website and increase

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:10.030
the conversions on your website to get more
sales out of them or more inquires or leads

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:13.299
or more visitors. If you want to do that I
would be more than happy to sit down with

00:04:13.299 --> 00:04:17.510
you and have a strategy session and in that
strategy session we talk about different methods

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:21.640
and business models you can apply and I can
