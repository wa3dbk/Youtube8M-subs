I’m Ryan McCaffrey, and this is IGN News.

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:10.320
We are just a few months away from the release
of Pacific Rim, and the studio has been posting

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.700
new images in the past few days from Guillermo
del Toro’s upcoming giant monster movie,

00:00:15.700 --> 00:00:18.440
and when we say giant, we mean it.

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:22.590
The images may not be from the movie itself
as much as a marketing campaign, but that

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:26.410
doesn’t change the fact that the stills
and the captions that accompany them are pretty

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:27.410
chilling.

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:29.000
Especially this one.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.410
With the caption, “We will rebuild the city
around its bones,” you can see the scale

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:35.790
of these alien monsters from the deep.

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:41.450
It definitely answers the question, “What
DOES one do with a 50 foot tall alien skull?”

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:46.830
For the image captioned “Kaiju Blue clean-up
detail: an endless, thankless task,” this

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:51.860
image shows a lot of hazmat suited public
servants cleaning a blue liquid off the beach

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:53.640
like an oil spill.

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.790
And when this is paired with the next still
captioned, “This is as close as you ever

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:02.610
want to get to kaiju blood” it seems pretty
clear that these creatures bleed toxic blue

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:03.610
goo.

00:01:03.610 --> 00:01:08.280
Naturally, if you killed one off the coast
of San Francisco bay, it’d make quite a

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.280
mess.

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.399
And the fourth image, with the caption “A
chilling reminder of a Kaiju attack,” almost

00:01:13.399 --> 00:01:17.400
holds the implication that a footprint of
one of the aliens, called Kaiju, has been

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:20.119
turned into a historical attraction.

00:01:20.119 --> 00:01:23.069
The obvious takeaway here is that these monsters
are big.

00:01:23.069 --> 00:01:24.899
Really, really, big.

00:01:24.899 --> 00:01:29.469
It’s difficult not to compare them to all
the other massive movie monsters.

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:34.779
When Godzilla almost crushed Hank Azaria in
the 1998 masterpiece, Godzilla, the foot of

00:01:34.779 --> 00:01:36.750
the beast was about the length of couple of
taxicabs.

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.060
In the trailer for Pacific Rim, we can see
it takes an aircraft carrier just to transport

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:39.060
the skull and spine.

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:44.300
And, spoiler alert, while Godzilla had problems
with bridges in 1998...the Kaiju don’t seem

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:45.829
to be too bothered by them.

00:01:45.829 --> 00:01:50.619
Pacific Rim is directed by Guillermo Del Toro,
and stars Sons of Anarchy’s Charlie Hunnam

00:01:50.619 --> 00:01:56.399
and Ron Perlman, as well as Idris Elba, and
Always Sunny In Philadelphia’s Charlie Day.

00:01:56.399 --> 00:02:00.009
The film opens July 12th in theaters and IMAX
3D.

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:03.130
