Hi! I’m Lisa Krone and I am here with Best
Epicurean on behalf of expertvillage.com and

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:14.929
today we are going to talk about making hot
chocolate from a mix. I’m sure you have

00:00:14.929 --> 00:00:19.820
all seen these packets that come in a box
from the store so what we are going to do

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:24.650
is show the right way to make hot chocolate
from a mix. A lot of times people end up making

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:31.320
it wrong and they get globby, gross, disgusting
globules in their hot chocolate and that’s

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:37.460
just icky so the first thing we do is open
up the packet. I like to use a cup that you

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:43.510
would get at a coffee shop and the reason
why I like to use that is especially if little

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:48.590
ones are going to be drinking or you are going
to be taking it outside in the snow. You don’t

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:56.110
want to drop a cup there so you empty the
whole packet into the cup, throw your garbage

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:02.010
away because you want to keep your maintenance
and now I have boiled about a cup and half,

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:06.470
little more than a cup of water. I might need
some extra water and what I am going to do

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:14.150
is I am going to put about this much into
the cup. I am going to mix it up so now I

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:20.940
can do a much more vigorous mixing than you
would normally do if the cup was full. What

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:29.860
this does is it breaks up the powder so you
can have some nice smooth hot chocolate. After

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:35.509
I mix it up as you can see there is really
nothing that comes to the top as a globules,

00:01:35.509 --> 00:01:42.599
I will pour the rest of the hot water and
I will give it another mix again. You don’t

00:01:42.599 --> 00:01:46.660
want to put it all the way to the top because
I like to leave room for some extra goodies.

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:51.580
On e of the things I love to do is instead
of marshmallows I love to put a little half

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:57.510
and half in there and that just makes it so
much creamier and then if you really want

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:02.531
to add a little bit of flavor, you can add
some natural vanilla syrup in there. Make

00:02:02.531 --> 00:02:06.950
sure when you buy the vanilla syrup you buy
the natural. You don’t want to buy one that

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:12.590
has corn syrup or anything like that in it
and I would just pour a little drop in and

00:02:12.590 --> 00:02:19.030
what that is going to do is give it a vanilla
flavor and kids will love that. You just mix

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:29.090
it up a little bit more, put your spoon here,
throw your lid on and give it a good taste.

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:37.060
Ah, that’s good and that’s how you make
hot chocolate from a mix.
