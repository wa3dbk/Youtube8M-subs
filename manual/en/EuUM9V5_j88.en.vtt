00:00:00.329 --> 00:00:01.803
(classical music)

00:00:06.023 --> 00:00:06.997
- Hey, everybody.

00:00:06.997 --> 00:00:07.909
If you're like me,

00:00:07.909 --> 00:00:08.847
then you constantly worry

00:00:08.847 --> 00:00:10.486
about building catching on fire

00:00:10.486 --> 00:00:12.940
when someone plays your newest mixed tape,

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:14.343
and since you can't compromise your

00:00:14.343 --> 00:00:17.668
artistic integrity because of
a few exploding sound systems,

00:00:17.668 --> 00:00:19.601
you have to be prepared
for the blazes that

00:00:19.601 --> 00:00:22.306
inevitably ensue once the beat drops.

00:00:22.306 --> 00:00:24.079
A fire extinguisher is
one of your best options,

00:00:25.079 --> 00:00:25.965
but what are these things, anyway?

00:00:25.965 --> 00:00:26.624
How do they work?

00:00:26.624 --> 00:00:27.857
(static noise)

00:00:27.857 --> 00:00:29.641
Great question!

00:00:29.641 --> 00:00:31.057
It's the subject of this episode.

00:00:31.057 --> 00:00:32.781
First, let's talk about fire.

00:00:32.781 --> 00:00:35.905
Fire is the result of a
chemical combustion reaction

00:00:35.905 --> 00:00:38.749
typically between oxygen
and some sort of fuel

00:00:38.749 --> 00:00:40.847
like wood or gasoline.

00:00:40.847 --> 00:00:42.445
For the reaction to occur,

00:00:42.445 --> 00:00:45.432
the fuel has to reach
its ignition temperature.

00:00:45.432 --> 00:00:47.607
For wood, that's about
500 degrees Fahrenheit

00:00:47.607 --> 00:00:49.973
or 260 degrees Celsius.

00:00:49.973 --> 00:00:53.519
The heat decomposes some
of the wood's cellulose

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:55.827
and that decomposed stuff is released

00:00:55.827 --> 00:00:58.137
as volatile gases like a compound

00:00:58.137 --> 00:01:00.521
of hydrogen, carbon and oxygen.

00:01:00.521 --> 00:01:02.122
When the gas is hot enough,

00:01:02.122 --> 00:01:04.085
its molecules break apart,

00:01:04.085 --> 00:01:05.915
the atoms recombine with the oxygen

00:01:05.915 --> 00:01:09.451
to form water, carbon
dioxide and other products.

00:01:09.451 --> 00:01:12.699
This heat keeps the fuel
at the ignition temperature

00:01:12.699 --> 00:01:16.764
so it keeps burning as long
as there is fuel and oxygen.

00:01:16.764 --> 00:01:17.743
There you have it.

00:01:17.743 --> 00:01:18.501
Fire.

00:01:18.501 --> 00:01:22.084
The result of extreme
heat, oxygen and fuel.

00:01:22.084 --> 00:01:24.791
Fire extinguishers remove at
least one of those elements

00:01:24.791 --> 00:01:26.140
from the equation.

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.688
Imagine a fire extinguisher cut in half.

00:01:28.688 --> 00:01:31.086
So, that plastic syphon tube there

00:01:31.086 --> 00:01:33.847
leads from the bottom of the
fire suppressant reservoir

00:01:33.847 --> 00:01:35.728
to the top of the extinguisher.

00:01:35.728 --> 00:01:39.009
A spring-mounted valve
locks the passageway

00:01:39.009 --> 00:01:40.890
from the syphon to the nozzle.

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.613
At the top of the cylinder,
there's a smaller cylinder

00:01:43.613 --> 00:01:45.562
filled with a compressed gas:

00:01:45.562 --> 00:01:48.356
liquid carbon dioxide, for example.

00:01:48.356 --> 00:01:51.533
A release valve keeps the
compressed gas from escaping.

00:01:51.533 --> 00:01:52.980
When you pull out the safety pin

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:54.601
and depress the operating lever,

00:01:54.601 --> 00:01:57.081
it pushes on an actuating rod.

00:01:57.081 --> 00:01:59.904
The rod presses the
spring-mounted valve down

00:01:59.904 --> 00:02:02.099
to open up the passage to the nozzle.

00:02:02.099 --> 00:02:04.922
The bottom of this actuating
rod has a sharp point,

00:02:04.922 --> 00:02:07.809
which pierces the gas
cylinder release valve.

00:02:07.809 --> 00:02:09.469
The compressed gas escapes,

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:12.427
applying downward pressure on
the fire suppressant material.

00:02:12.427 --> 00:02:14.452
And this drives that
fire suppressant stuff

00:02:14.452 --> 00:02:16.717
up the syphon, out the nozzle.

00:02:16.717 --> 00:02:18.961
The proper way to use the extinguisher

00:02:18.961 --> 00:02:22.442
is to aim it directly at
the fuel, not at the flames,

00:02:22.442 --> 00:02:25.191
and spray in a sweeping motion.

00:02:25.191 --> 00:02:27.267
There are three main
types of extinguishers.

00:02:27.267 --> 00:02:29.833
A water extinguisher can put
out things like burning wood

00:02:29.833 --> 00:02:31.580
or paper or cardboard,

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:34.287
but it's not great shakes
at electrical fires

00:02:34.287 --> 00:02:36.923
or fires involving inflammable liquids.

00:02:36.923 --> 00:02:38.176
In an electrical fire,

00:02:38.176 --> 00:02:40.469
water might actually conduct the current,

00:02:40.469 --> 00:02:42.045
which could electrocute you.

00:02:42.045 --> 00:02:44.192
Then there's the carbon
dioxide extinguisher.

00:02:44.192 --> 00:02:47.562
The CO2 is kept in a
pressurized liquid form.

00:02:47.562 --> 00:02:48.821
When the container is opened,

00:02:48.821 --> 00:02:50.553
the CO2 forms a gas.

00:02:50.553 --> 00:02:52.545
This gas is heavier than oxygen,

00:02:52.545 --> 00:02:55.723
so it displaces the oxygen
surrounding the fuel.

00:02:55.723 --> 00:02:57.223
This type of extinguisher
is the one you'll

00:02:57.223 --> 00:02:58.870
find most often in restaurants

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:02.291
because it won't contaminate
cooking equipment or food.

00:03:02.291 --> 00:03:04.193
However, ladies and
gentlemen, drum roll please.

00:03:04.193 --> 00:03:07.564
The most popular fire
extinguishing material

00:03:07.564 --> 00:03:10.105
that's the dry chemical extinguisher.

00:03:10.105 --> 00:03:13.024
These cylinders contain foam or powder,

00:03:13.024 --> 00:03:15.954
typically made of sodium bicarbonate.

00:03:15.954 --> 00:03:17.465
You may know it by its street name:

00:03:17.465 --> 00:03:18.490
baking soda.

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:21.409
Baking soda starts to decompose at only

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:24.041
about 158 degrees Fahrenheit,

00:03:24.041 --> 00:03:27.579
which for everybody but the
U.S. is 70 degrees Celcius.

00:03:27.579 --> 00:03:29.190
And when this stuff decomposes,

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:30.608
it releases CO2.

00:03:30.608 --> 00:03:33.803
The CO2, along with the
insulation of the foam,

00:03:33.803 --> 00:03:34.709
smothers fire.

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:37.157
However, be careful.

00:03:37.157 --> 00:03:40.054
Most fire extinguishers
contain a small amount

00:03:40.054 --> 00:03:40.947
of suppressant.

00:03:40.947 --> 00:03:42.960
You can use it up in seconds,

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:44.608
and that's why they are only effective

00:03:44.608 --> 00:03:46.693
on relatively small fires.

00:03:46.693 --> 00:03:48.041
To put our a bigger blaze,

00:03:48.041 --> 00:03:49.123
you need more equipment,

00:03:49.123 --> 00:03:51.663
like a fire engine, as well as, hopefully,

00:03:51.663 --> 00:03:53.010
some trained professionals.

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:56.536
But, for the conflagrations
that can pop up in your house,

00:03:56.536 --> 00:03:58.884
a fire extinguisher is a life saver.

00:03:58.884 --> 00:03:59.704
That's it.

00:03:59.704 --> 00:04:00.985
I mean, remember again,

00:04:00.985 --> 00:04:02.393
if you have to use one,

00:04:02.393 --> 00:04:03.903
hit the fuel, not the flame,

00:04:03.903 --> 00:04:05.323
and sweep across the fire.

00:04:05.323 --> 00:04:07.149
Thank you so much for watching.

00:04:07.149 --> 00:04:09.202
Toss me a Like if you dug this video.

00:04:09.202 --> 00:04:10.763
Let me know which other gadgets

00:04:10.763 --> 00:04:12.503
I should cover in the future,

00:04:12.503 --> 00:04:15.631
and stay tuned next week
for more Brain Stuff.
