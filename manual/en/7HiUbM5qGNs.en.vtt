00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:17.000
It is an open space which should be offered to all arts from fine arts, dance, theatre to performances for kids.

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:18.900
CONSTRUCTION

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:29.180
Month ago the space was disgusting, yellow, strip lights everywhere. Now it is clean, electricity is distributed etc.

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:32.200
The space is dedicated to all people who got involved.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:38.600
From the name Jatka78 (Slaughterhouse78) to graphics to anyone who for a single hour scratched the endless walls.

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:40.500
PROGRAMME

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:47.500
Early December we welcome the great Sisters Company from Sweden.

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:52.600
They do disciplines which are not often seen or done here in Czech Republic.

00:00:53.400 --> 00:01:02.800
Then we have an unusual performance. It is not a completed show, it will be done specially for two nights here.

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:20.500
It is called Analog. World class circus artists, musicians (crazy drummer from Berlin, wonderful singer).

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:27.700
It was not even a thought about what to start with. We are kicking off the two months here with Dolls, the latest Cirk La Putyka show.

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:34.200
We want to demonstrate the path Cirk La Putyka walked to this show.

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:40.100
It will be a nice bridge, because we are closing with our first show La Putyka right before Christmas.

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.000
OPENING

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:48.400
The space should come alive with everything we expect from it and what it provides.

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:56.400
Sasa Minajev will be reading Dostoyevsky in Russian. Hopefully hanging from the ceiling in the bathroom.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.900
Iby will be there too, playing guitar, and someone else will be juggling glasses at the desk.

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.200
Then the whole space will be open for the audience.

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:13.000
And then I hope there will be an interesting opening party.

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.500
