00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:07.290
Nokia Oro.

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:10.860
Expected Q3 2011.

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:15.669
Is the Nokia Oro a beautifully crafted and
exclusive handset with will impress people

00:00:15.669 --> 00:00:21.180
with your good taste? Or is it a just tarted
up Nokia C7 with a bit of bling and costing

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:28.000
nearly four times as much? The truth is that
it is a bit of both.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.500
Nokia are remarkably honest about their target
customers - they say that "The main markets

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:38.071
for this sort of device are the Middle East
and Russia.. premium products like Nokia Oro

00:00:38.071 --> 00:00:42.430
have always been best sellers in Russia..
In some areas, possession of such premium

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:48.120
products is the passport to being taken seriously."
In other words, the Oro really is about showing

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.250
off and Nokia are not ashamed by it.

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:58.720
Fortunately, the Nokia C7 that this is based
on is a pretty decent Symbian handset, and

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:02.710
Nokia are shipping the Oro with the latest
version of the OS called "Anna" plus custom

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:11.189
themes to match the handset's exclusive design.
On the front is a 3.5" 360 x 640 pixel touchscreen,

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:16.710
there's an 8 megapixel camera with 720p video
capture on the back plus support for HSPA

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:23.819
high-speed data, WiFi and GPS and even NFC
support. Where some other luxury handsets

00:01:23.819 --> 00:01:29.320
- including Nokia's Vertu brand - basically
sell gold plated crap, the Oro is at least

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:33.920
a very capable smartphone underneath.

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:38.899
"Oro" means "gold", and the handset's scratch
resistant 18 carat gold plating is certainly

00:01:38.899 --> 00:01:43.840
distinctive. On the back is a premium leather
finish, and the home key has is protected

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:49.090
by a sapphire crystal. It does all look rather
tasteful and not too garish in both "light"

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:54.799
and "dark" versions, so Nokia have done quite
well here too.

00:01:54.799 --> 00:01:59.759
The Oro also ships with a gold plated "Nokia
J" Bluetooth headset, although other than

00:01:59.759 --> 00:02:04.909
that the standard sales package is pretty
sparsely populated and lacks a microSD card

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:09.399
(although there's 8GB built in) or a case.

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:14.239
Nokia say that the Oro should be available
from Q3 in "selected countries" in Europe,

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:18.689
the Middle East and China.

00:02:18.689 --> 00:02:24.040
The price is quoted as being upwards of €800,
so expect it to retail for about €1000 when

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:29.930
you add tax. It may be expensive, but bear
in mind that a Vertu will cost you at least

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:35.950
€4000 and will have only about as much functionality
as €40 entry level phone.. and with the

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:41.290
Oro you're are at least getting a €270 smartphone
underneath all the gold, so in that case the

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:43.349
Oro does look like a bit of a bargain.
