Hi. My name is Dave Andrews and, today, I'm
going to show you how to connect your Linux

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:16.690
home server to your Windows-based network.
Let's go to our Linux installation. What we're

00:00:16.690 --> 00:00:22.240
going to do is file share. The easiest way
to set up file sharing on your Linux server

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:36.370
is just to type "sudo apt-get install samba."
Samba is a file server for Linux. Our sudo

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:42.039
command tells us to run the sys administrator.
And apt-get install tells us to connect over

00:00:42.039 --> 00:00:51.950
the Internet to install samba. I already had
samba installed on the server but that is

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:58.600
the command you would run to get it installed.
Now let's create a file share. Just type sudo

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:09.770
to get administrative permissions, space,
slash, etc, slash, samba, slash snb dot conf.

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:24.130
This is your samba config file.
Sudo, space, vim to get a text editor on.

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:28.880
Now, here's our samba config file. If we scroll
all the way down to the bottom, we're going

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:35.640
to see the shares that are set up. I've created
one here called davida, the comment on it

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.910
is David, that's just going to be sort of
a browseable comment that would show up on

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:44.030
your network. Browseable means yes, which
means you can browse to it simply by going

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:51.160
to your explorer. The path is the location
of the files I'm going to share. Guest ok

00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:58.000
means allow anybody to access it and read
only no means allow people to write to it.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:03.880
To connect your Windows PCs to your new share,
simply click on the Start button and in the

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:09.000
Search area type slash/slash, which tells
you you're connecting over the Internet, type

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:15.750
the address of the server you're connecting
to and then slash, the name of the share that

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:20.410
you've given it. It's that easy to connect
your Windows-based PC to your Linux server

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:28.420
to your Windows network. My name is Dave Andrews
and I've just showed you how to connect your

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:30.620
Linux home server to your Windows-based network.
