Bob Frederick: Hi, I’m Bob Frederick the director of the 
UAH Propulsion Research Center.

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:20.670
I’d like to talk to you a little bit today
about our students and their dreams and how

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:26.233
higher education and NASA research
can help them fulfill those dreams

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:33.066
and where they plan on going in the future.

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:35.830
Shawn Ikard: I was always interested in space so I knew
I wanted to do something that involved propulsion.

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:38.446
Caroline Hood: I was just watching TV and the news came up about NASA and all the cool stuff that they did and I was telling

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:45.720
my parents that I want to work for NASA someday.

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:49.840
Chad Eberheart: When I was young I always 
dreamed of being a fighter pilot.

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:54.093
Tony Marshall: My class took a field trip to 
the Marshall Space Flight Center

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:56.430
to Space Camp, I looked over at a friend of mine 
and I said I want to do that some day.

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:07.756
Huy Hunh: My childhood dream was to become a pilot
or an astronaut and now that dream is being fulfilled

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:13.180
with NASA supplying
me with an education and research experience

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.133
that is going to help astronauts be sent
into space. I’m getting great research

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:20.233
experience and design experience that is
going to help me in the job field later.

00:01:23.020 --> 00:01:23.290
I can imagine the best benefit that NASA has is that
they are also getting some very viable research

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:33.750
for future design of injectors
and future design of rocket engines.

00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:37.550
Ashley Penton: Oh, when I was a kid I wanted to be 
an engineer just like my daddy. You know, I was always

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:39.573
interested in science and chemistry
and mathematics especially. We are looking

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:44.163
at burn rates for solid propellants and it
is helping NASA because they are

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:49.633
actually looking at using solid propellants
for some of their future rockets. In the

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:55.973
laboratory, I get to build solid
propellant samples and put them into

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:01.100
a pressure vessel and then we get to test
those samples and analyze a lot

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:01.983
of data which involves a lot of mathematics.

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:09.490
I want to be a rocket scientist and working 
in PRC I’m getting to fulfill that.

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:14.223
John Brooks: When I was young, I wanted to… 
I don’t know I was more

00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:15.013
of an explorer, more of an adventurer. 
I wanted to reach out into

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:19.680
the unknown and find something new. 
As I got older and got into college,

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:22.136
I found out that I liked engineering, 
science and math and it was such a really

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:27.216
good outlet to be able to come here and
for NASA and Huntsville to both give me the

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:31.490
opportunity to be able to work on furthering
my aspirations of adventure and, I mean,

00:02:36.570 --> 00:02:38.276
think about it, years from now we
will be exploring the stars and this is the first step.

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:42.303
Dr. Kader Frendi: When I grew up, and this is 7,000 miles
away from here, I looked up in the sky during the Apollo days,

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:48.710
I looked up in the sky and I said to myself,
“I want to work for the organization that sends

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:51.743
people up there.” And guess what? That dream 
stayed alive and I just kept going and going and

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:58.076
going and I did work for NASA. 
I work for NASA, I still work for

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:05.583
NASA even as a professor
so never give up your dreams.

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:07.190
I mean, just keep going.

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:09.086
Ashley: I want to be a rocket scientist.

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:10.836
John: I think we have a great future.

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:13.273
Huynh: I’m happy that I was able to get this opportunity.

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:15.333
This is what I like to do and this is 
what I want to continue to do.

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:17.633
Jason Bush: I hope to do this the rest of my life.

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:21.226
Bob Frederick: When I was a child, people were going to the moon. And so it is no surprise that after growing up in

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:27.893
an environment like that I was able to 
go to college and universities and get my hands

00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:29.550
on things and now I end up in the beautiful 
position of being a director of a research center

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:35.043
at a college where I can help other young people 
achieve their childhood dreams of working on rockets

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:40.376
and being in the propulsion industry.

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:47.640
Ryan Saffel: Uh, the big fire that comes out of the end…
and the loud noise, that’s the exciting part.
