00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:14.400
We are girls that are curvy. We want to embrace
our curves. It's okay to have tits and ass.

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.279
Let's enjoy it. Let's show it off, but in
a sexy way.

00:00:18.279 --> 00:00:25.400
And this is why we love Khloe Kardashian!
The reality superstar launched the Lipsy Kardashian

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:30.430
Kollection in London and told us all about
how their clan have family values when it

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:35.290
comes to sexiness, especially when managing
their younger members.

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:40.059
On the note of sexiness, I feel like your
clothes always seem to hit the right tone

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:44.270
of sexy. With having younger sisters, do you
feel almost like a responsibility to be like

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:48.190
this a good way to be sexy? Don't twerk maybe.

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:56.369
Yeah. Don't twerk maybe. Well, you know, my
sisters are... Now one's 18. 18 and 16, and

00:00:56.369 --> 00:01:04.570
they are such great girls, and they're really,
like for everything like the world they live

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:09.750
in, they could be so wild and crazy, and they're
really just like... They horseback ride. They

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.890
go to school. They have their own collection.
They love fashion. We get a lot of inspiration

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:20.390
from them, and also they get a lot of inspiration
from us. They borrow a lot of our clothes,

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:26.510
and I think it is something you have to look
our for, even for my nephews and nieces. You

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:32.530
want to carry yourself in a certain way, so
they see that as an example.

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:37.850
Although she was happy to admit she wasn't
always a shining fashion example.

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:46.230
I used to wear Sean John, you know Sean John,
velour men's sweatsuits because they were

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:52.881
comfortable literally at all times. I don't
know why. I just thought it was cool. When

00:01:52.881 --> 00:01:58.760
I was like 15 years old, and it was ugliest
thing ever. Like wear a sweatsuit, I don't

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:03.820
care, but not a men's sweatsuit. I don't know
why something in my head told me that was

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:04.820
okay.

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:06.350
I think that's quite adorable. You're comfy.
You don't care.

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:11.819
Well, I'm glad you think it's adorable because
nobody else did. My sisters were like what

00:02:11.819 --> 00:02:17.221
is wrong with you? So that was definitely
not a good time in my life, but hey. Look

00:02:17.221 --> 00:02:19.390
at me now.

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:25.440
Yep, she set the tracksuits packing, but there
is still some fashion mistakes that are slightly

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:26.970
out of her control.

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:31.880
I think we've just embraced camel toe. I don't
know if you ever conquer it because it's just

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:38.700
there. Like you can't do anything. We've just
learned to embrace it. CTC. Cover The Camel.
