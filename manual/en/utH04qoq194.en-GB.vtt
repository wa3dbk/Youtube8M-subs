00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:07.570
They come topped with pepperoni, chicken tikka
or vegetarian. But a flying variety may soon

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:13.900
be found on Indian pizza menus, after an outlet
in Mumbai said it had successfully delivered

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:19.740
by drone. Staff at Francesco's Pizzeria in
south Mumbai were inspired by the news that

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:25.500
online retail giant Amazon was planning to
use unmanned drones to deliver goods, and

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:30.940
decided to try one out as a means to beat
the city's notorious traffic. "We successfully

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:37.500
carried out a test delivery by sending a pizza
to a customer located 1.5 kilometres away

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:43.580
from our outlet on May 11," Francesco's Pizzeria
chief executive Mikhel Rajani told the Press

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:49.110
Trust of India (PTI) news agency. "What we
have done now will be common place in the

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:54.030
next four to five years," he said, adding
that the customised four-rotor drones each

00:00:54.030 --> 00:01:00.650
cost around $2,000. The company posted a video
of the delivery on YouTube, which shows the

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:06.390
drone carrying the pizza box over shops, cricketers
and the coastline of the financial capital

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.890
before landing on a high-rise rooftop. Rajani
believes the test will lead the way to a cheaper

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:17.190
and quicker service than their usual two-wheelers
can provide by road. He said there were some

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:22.450
snags however, such as batteries running out
after eight kilometres and drones being banned

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:27.799
from flying over security establishments.
Mumbai police said they would be seeking an

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:32.799
explanation from the pizza firm as to why
they were not informed about the test run.

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:39.080
"As per norms, permission must be taken for
flying any such object," said Additional Police

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:44.150
Commissioner Madhukar Pandey. "We are very
sensitive towards anything that flies in the

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:50.060
sky with the help of remote control," he told
PTI. It is thought to be the first time a

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:56.170
drone has found such a use in India, although
the UK arm of Domino's Pizza posted a YouTube

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:01.170
video last year showing the "Domino's DomiCopter"
apparently doing a test delivery.
