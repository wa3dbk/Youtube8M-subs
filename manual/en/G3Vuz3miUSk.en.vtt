Hi, this is Michele Bousquet, and in this
video in the Edge Flow Series,

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:11.160
we're going to look at how to make an oblong cutout.

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:18.480
We start with a plane, as usual, and cut some edges in it.

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:31.380
And I'm going to move some of these edges closer together to make more of a square pattern
there.

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:38.380
We scale a few of them out to make the ends
of our oblong,

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:45.140
and just start moving some of the other vertices so that we can make the shape.

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:52.140
Move those edges out to give more support
on that end,

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:04.420
and we're going to keep scaling to make the oblong shape.

00:01:06.399 --> 00:01:13.399
I want a little more of a rounded shape there in those big middle parts, so I'm going to create a few extra edges.

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:27.159
And we'll just scale those out.

00:01:34.249 --> 00:01:41.249
I think I'd like the ends to be a little bit more pinched, but I want to keep my grid pattern, so I'm going to scale all of these at the same time.

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:48.729
And now I have my nice oblong

00:01:49.149 --> 00:01:54.389
and it's time to make some supporting edges.
Calvin likes to delete this section here and

00:01:54.389 --> 00:02:01.389
then Shift+Copy edges, but what I like to
do is use the Inset tool a couple of times

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:07.869
and get a couple of insets.
And then you can take this center part and

00:02:07.869 --> 00:02:14.730
you can lift it up or you can lift it down.
In this case I want to make a bulge, so I'm

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:19.030
going to lift it up.
Then it's just a matter of shaping the bulge

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:23.980
using some scaling and moving some of the vertices around.

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:30.980
I'm going to pull those center vertices up
just to keep the nice curvature of the bulge going.

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:37.260
And when we put subdivision on this you can

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:41.959
see that we get this nice, smooth bulge that
subdivides really, really well.

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:48.959
You could also take that top part and push
it downward to make an indentation or a vent,

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:53.780
something like that on the front
of a piece of electronics.
