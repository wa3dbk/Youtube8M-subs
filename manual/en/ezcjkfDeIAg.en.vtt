Welcome to Hot Tips coming from the Smoke Learning Channel.

00:00:05.103 --> 00:00:09.568
Today's hot tip is copying curve animations between transitions.

00:00:10.185 --> 00:00:15.146
This user inspired tip can help you change 
curve types quickly for transitions.

00:00:15.805 --> 00:00:20.848
For example you would like all your dissolves to be 
linear instead of S-shaped.

00:00:21.513 --> 00:00:25.791
Any curve for that matter can be copied across multiple transitions.

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:28.687
Now Smoke is selection based.

00:00:29.171 --> 00:00:36.611
So you can multi-select a bunch of transitions and adjust some of
 their properties ranging from dissolve blending to durations.

00:00:37.393 --> 00:00:44.664
By adjusting settings using the basic parameters bar, 
all the selected dissolves will update with the changes.

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:51.051
However if you wanted to edit the animation curve, 
you would need to do this in the channel editor.

00:00:51.489 --> 00:00:54.897
This is all fine and you can change the animation curve.

00:00:55.347 --> 00:01:02.228
But any changes you make in the editor only apply to 
one transition and not all the other dissolves.

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:07.193
Going into any other transitionâ€™s editor, 
the curve is still the same

00:01:07.507 --> 00:01:12.506
and the last thing anyone wants to do is 
go through each dissolve one at a time.

00:01:12.951 --> 00:01:15.204
So you have two choices.

00:01:15.581 --> 00:01:21.766
You can either set up your curve type in the preferences menu but 
this requires foresight which is impossible

00:01:21.766 --> 00:01:24.950
because we never know exactly what clients want.

00:01:25.471 --> 00:01:27.721
Or you can try this little tip.

00:01:28.426 --> 00:01:35.227
Once you have made your curve adjustment to the first transition,
 select the transition in the sequence and copy it.

00:01:35.854 --> 00:01:41.506
You can now manually select the other transitions or 
you can go into the filter selection tool

00:01:41.754 --> 00:01:44.381
and select all the transitions in the sequence.

00:01:45.143 --> 00:01:48.754
With the selection made, you can now choose to paste.

00:01:49.314 --> 00:01:57.244
Please note that this will paste the new curve into each selected 
transition but it will not change the duration of each dissolve.

00:01:58.008 --> 00:02:01.190
So this works great for transitions of the same length.

00:02:01.745 --> 00:02:05.777
For transitions of different lengths 
you will have to go into the editor

00:02:06.071 --> 00:02:10.170
and adjust the pasted curve to match the correct dissolve duration.

00:02:10.634 --> 00:02:16.894
