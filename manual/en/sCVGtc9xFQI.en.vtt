00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:04.710
This might be a bit late, but I only now started
noticing just how much shit the Tokyo Ghoul

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:06.460
anime ending was getting.

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:11.670
On the one hand, I expected the cries of it
being a “cliffhanger” and “unfinished”,

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.509
but on the other, I didn’t expect the sheer
magnitude of it all.

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:20.880
Maybe I just happen to not be seeing the more
positive reception, but it seems almost unanimous.

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:25.570
So now I have to take the time to explain
why everyone is wrong and I’m right.

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:30.980
…That was a joke, obviously, but I do genuinely
believe it was just fine, so I wanted to take

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:34.999
a little bit of time to explain why I think
people missed the point of what made the ending…

00:00:34.999 --> 00:00:36.760
well, an ending.

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:40.170
Along with some pondering on what an ending
in general really is.

00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:44.810
Needless to say, this is going to be entirely
about the final episode of Tokyo Ghoul, so

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:48.569
you probably want to stop here if you haven’t
seen or finished the show.

00:00:48.569 --> 00:00:50.350
Which you should, because it was great.

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:55.780
I think what’s mainly baffling is that while
hate for the ending seems to be unanimous,

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:59.019
love for the episode itself also seems to
be unanimous.

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:03.739
It’s confusing because if you understand
what made the episode so great, then so should

00:01:03.739 --> 00:01:06.130
the reason on why it ended the way it did.

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:10.130
I could be wrong, but it makes me think that
the reason most people liked the episode was

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:14.799
simply because Kaneki stopped being a “wimp”
and turned into a “badass”.

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:18.590
Kind of in the same vein as when people complain
about more passive or pathetic main characters

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:19.590
being “bad”.

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:25.560
It’s a pretty bad oversimplification of
the point behind the episode, as the why is

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.280
more important.

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:31.541
Just like with any fight scene, the choreography
of it is just mostly eye-candy, all of the

00:01:31.541 --> 00:01:37.049
actual tension, excitement, and stakes come
from the reasons behind the fight.

00:01:37.049 --> 00:01:41.060
So then what is this why, and how does it
explain why the ending works?

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:44.899
The episode isn’t great because Kaneki gets
aggressive and fights back, in fact, it’s

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:47.340
not even really exciting that he retaliates.

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:51.579
More than anything it’s somber – considering
the sole purpose of the episode was to break

00:01:51.579 --> 00:01:53.560
Kaneki’s spirit.

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.340
Ever since the beginning of the show, the
entire defining point of the series was how

00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:01.469
the lead character became this half-ghoul
and half-human being, and his attempt to retain

00:02:01.469 --> 00:02:03.820
his humanity as much as possible.

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:07.479
Throughout the show he continuously has to
deal with issues that make it harder and harder

00:02:07.479 --> 00:02:11.590
for him to avoid his new ghoul side, and the
final episode was the nail in the coffin to

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:13.959
him fully embracing it.

00:02:13.959 --> 00:02:17.580
Depending on your perspective, this could
be a good thing, but doesn’t change the

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:22.480
fact that Kaneki has spent the entire show
desperately trying to hold onto his humanity

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:28.769
as best as he can, just for him to be completely
broken in the end, both physically and mentally.

00:02:28.769 --> 00:02:34.799
That’s what made the last episode work so
well (along with some phenomenal directing).

00:02:34.799 --> 00:02:39.160
Now the question is: why does that make the
ending good?

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:40.870
Stories are made up of arcs.

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:44.629
Sometimes they’re story arcs, other times
they’re character arcs.

00:02:44.629 --> 00:02:47.750
Generally a show wants to finish a season
at the end of an arc, because that’s what

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:49.450
gives it finality.

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:53.379
There can be hints of more to come, but things
are mostly wrapped up.

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:57.170
Tokyo Ghoul did indeed finish on the end of
an arc.

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:02.099
Again, the entire point of the show from the
very beginning was Kaneki being broken into

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:04.379
accepting that he’s now a ghoul.

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:08.209
The show started with him refusing to eat
another person and being physically disgusted

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:12.549
with the idea of cannibalism, and the show
ended with him more than willing to devour

00:03:12.549 --> 00:03:13.849
his captor in vengeance.

00:03:13.849 --> 00:03:16.510
That’s a character arc.

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:20.189
The main problem I’m sure people have is
that everyone from Anteiku showed up to rescue

00:03:20.189 --> 00:03:24.430
him, and most of them seemed to be about to
get into fights before the show ended.

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:27.320
The thing is, the show was never really about
them.

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:31.849
That’s not to say they aren’t important,
but pretty much all of the events were there

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:34.430
to add to Kaneki’s plight in some way.

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:37.960
Reinforcing that there were both good and
bad people on both sides of the feud being

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:39.600
the main one.

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:43.270
They all went to try and rescue him, but now
he’s already free.

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:46.980
Though they obviously don’t realize it yet,
their goal has already been achieved.

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:48.340
They’re done.

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:52.720
If I wanted to get really technical I could
even argue that it didn’t really end in

00:03:52.720 --> 00:03:57.470
the middle of anything since those fights
didn’t actually start, but that probably

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:59.500
wouldn’t fly for most people.

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:02.650
The point is that Kaneki is the center of
the universe when it comes to all of these

00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:06.950
actions, and at the end he’s gone through
the character arc that was set up at the beginning,

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:08.410
and is now free.

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:12.810
The opening even shows this: it starts with
him sitting and looking defeated in a chair,

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:16.810
eventually has him falling into his ghoul
side where they meld, and then you have white-haired

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:17.870
Kaneki.

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:22.060
The opening was pretty much entirely about
the finale; even the song is about him accepting

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:23.590
that he’s a ghoul and his thoughts in general.

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:28.220
I’m not going to lie and say every thread
got wrapped up, because that’s obviously

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:32.750
not true, but it’s placing a bit too much
importance on threads that don’t really

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:34.960
matter as much as others.

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:38.870
As the idiom goes, it’s seeing the forest
for the trees.

00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:41.060
Or is it not seeing the forest for the trees?

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:44.930
Anyways, the point is that it’s obsessing
over the little details and not getting the

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:46.270
overall picture.

00:04:46.270 --> 00:04:50.460
I know it sounds like I’m saying “just
ignore the problems”, but what I’m actually

00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:53.660
saying is that they aren’t actually problems
to begin with.

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:58.030
Again, it’s like what I mentioned before
about fight scenes: the fight in and of itself

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:01.490
isn’t what’s important, it’s the reasons
behind it.

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:04.210
It’s the same with Tokyo Ghoul as a whole.

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:09.990
There was finality, because it started a character
arc, and ended it, as any good show should

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:10.990
do.

00:05:10.990 --> 00:05:15.729
Well, if you want to get technical it didn’t
necessarily “end” so much as morph into

00:05:15.729 --> 00:05:20.080
something new, but the point is, that’s
something for another season.

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:23.380
Just like the fights with the other characters
it started setting up.

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:26.530
The only reasonable argument against the ending
I could think of is that it should have at

00:05:26.530 --> 00:05:30.419
least continued to the point where Kaneki
and everyone else got out and went home, because

00:05:30.419 --> 00:05:34.070
that would still cover the character arc without
leaving any loose ends.

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:37.680
But even then I’d argue against that since
I doubt they could finish up fights with these

00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:41.819
ghouls they’ve established as being exceptionally
strong in any short amount of time, and more

00:05:41.819 --> 00:05:46.030
importantly because ending the show with Kaneki
eating someone is far too important to have

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:48.770
it keep going considering how everything was
set up.

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:51.479
There’s not much else to say.

00:05:51.479 --> 00:05:55.520
The simplistic summary is just that a final
episode should have finality, and this one

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:58.810
did because it wrapped up a character arc
it had set up at the start and developed over

00:05:58.810 --> 00:06:00.400
the course of the show.

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:04.419
It was the core of everything, and it was
developed and resolved by the end.

00:06:04.419 --> 00:06:07.080
And as I said, that’s what any good finale
should do.
