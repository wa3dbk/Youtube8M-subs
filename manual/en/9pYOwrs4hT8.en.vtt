00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.779
In this segment, we'll talk about another
important part of the dress that is the collar.

00:00:04.779 --> 00:00:19.359
We'll draw a straight line to mark the width
of the collar which is three inches.

00:00:19.359 --> 00:00:24.249
And now the full length of the collar which
is around 15 inches 7.5 inches for either

00:00:24.249 --> 00:01:08.350
side. Now we'll give the shape of the collar
with the help of a scale.

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:12.380
Sides will be more than the normal width of
collar to give it a shape around 4 inches.

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:29.180
This is 1inch more than the original width
of the collar. We'll join all the points together,

00:01:29.180 --> 00:02:08.250
giving them a curved shape.

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:14.620
This is how we give the shape of the collar.
Cut the patter, this going to be the pattern

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.720
of the collar which we are going to use.
