Hi, I'm Joe Cuenco with Family Resources.
Today we're talking about our relationship

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:10.620
skills. Specifically, how do we encourage
our man to share his feelings? Well just how

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.209
do we get a man to share his feelings, because
this is really difficult for a lot of guys

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:22.940
to do. It really starts with a solid communication
process. It means that you've got to have

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:30.230
a free flow of information, of dialogue, between
the man and the woman for this to happen.

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:35.620
It needs to be full duplex back and forth.
Nothing will be communicated unless both have

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:41.440
clear minds and have a full understanding
of what's taking place, or what's not taking

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:46.910
place. The first thing that you want to eliminate
is the fact that perhaps it's because of you

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:53.020
that he's not sharing his feelings. So, sit
down and talk. Ask him the question. Why is

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:56.250
it that you're having a hard time sharing
your feelings? Is is something that I'm doing?

00:00:56.250 --> 00:01:01.420
Because maybe he might feel that you're actually
not listening. So, you need to eliminate that

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:07.770
perspective first. The thing that you can
do is share your feelings. Make sure that

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:13.869
he understands how it is with positive communication
and being able to share feelings. So, do by

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:21.590
example. If he won't volunteer, then ask.
Say, let's start a pattern. Honey, how did

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:26.999
you feel about this? Or, this situation, what
could we have done differently? How do you

00:01:26.999 --> 00:01:31.210
feel about buying a house? How do you feel
about having another child? How do you feel

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:36.829
about moving here? Or what do you think about
this situation in my job? Or, what did you

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:42.420
feel about the situation in your job? So,
open up and have a dialogue, and explain to

00:01:42.420 --> 00:01:49.740
him how you feel positively about him sharing
his feelings. And when he does open up, say

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:55.490
that it's a positive experience, and something
that's very important and key to you. So,

00:01:55.490 --> 00:02:00.009
if you need to have this dialogue started
with a positive aspect of communication, and

00:02:00.009 --> 00:02:05.340
then talk about things where there may be
some improvement--or some help could be used.

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:10.509
There are workshops that can be attended,
family resources, marriage education workshops

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:16.560
and counseling, but it's important that you
have a solid communication first before you

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:22.150
can learn to encourage your man how to share
his feelings. I'm Joe Cuenco with Family Resources,

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:23.200
relationships for life.
