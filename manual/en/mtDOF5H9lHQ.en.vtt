00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:17.850
Thanks for tuning in to another episode of
Superchips Quick Tech.

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.350
In this episode, I'm going to run you through
the quick tune option that comes in the VIVID

00:00:21.350 --> 00:00:26.180
software, and we're going to show you how
to install the windshield mount that comes

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:27.520
in the kit.

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:33.370
Start by plugging in your VIVID LINQ into
your OBD-II port and secure it with either

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:37.510
the wire ties or the velcro strips so that
it's out of your foot well.

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:41.559
You want to pair the two devices together
to make sure that they communicate.

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:50.289
If you are unfamiliar with the pairing process,
see our other video that details that.

00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:54.510
Select the VIVID icon on your phone to open
the program.

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:01.909
Next, select the tuning icon and let the program
read your vehicle.

00:01:01.909 --> 00:01:09.340
This may take a little bit to complete the
first time around.

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:13.150
Once the vehicle has been read, select the
tuning level that you would like to use.

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:18.450
We are going to use the performance level
this time, and we are going to go with the

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:33.500
quick tune option for this episode.

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:36.970
Once the vehicle has been successfully tuned,
you can either close the application down

00:01:36.970 --> 00:02:13.610
or take advantage of some of the other features
that the VIVID software has to offer.

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:17.840
A handy windshield mount comes with your VIVID
LINQ that allows you to mount your Android

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.800
phone to your windshield.

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:25.170
Assemble the mount by placing the spherical
end of the adjustable mount into the suction

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:33.739
cup base, then push the suction cup side of
the mount firmly against the windshield and

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:39.349
slide the locking arm down to secure the mount.

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:44.550
Using the base of your phone, expand the adjustable
claw to place your phone in the mount.

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:48.849
Now lightly reduce the pressure on the claw
allowing the mount to hold the phone under

00:02:48.849 --> 00:02:50.040
tension.

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:54.569
You now know how to quick tune your vehicle
with the Superchips application and use the

00:02:54.569 --> 00:02:56.900
windshield mount to mount your phone to your
vehicle.

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:01.959
