00:00:00.719 --> 00:00:05.819
Hey, folks! You know what I really hate? No,
me neither. So let's check with the wheel

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:07.700
of hatred!

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:09.590
[BUZZER SOUND]

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:11.910
Huh. Apparently it's job interviews.

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.269
Man, I HATE job interviews! Especially the
kind where they ask you stupid questions like,

00:00:16.269 --> 00:00:20.560
y'know, if you were a fish what kind would
you be, if you were a season of Dawsons Creek

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:25.519
which would you be or, and this is the one
that I hate the most, why do you want to work

00:00:25.519 --> 00:00:26.589
for us?

00:00:26.589 --> 00:00:29.640
I'll tell you why I want to work for your
company, no-neck, it's because you are willing

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:34.640
to give me money in exchange for my time and,
on occasion, my energy.

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:39.212
Still, as much as I hate job interviews I
always draw comfort from the fact that I don't

00:00:39.212 --> 00:00:44.850
have it as bad as the character from todays
game: Super Hero, a 1988 offering from Codemasters.

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.970
In Super Hero you play a man with an AMAZING
BEARD!

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:53.300
He wants to be a god. But, let's face it,
who doesn't these days? And because of this

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.060
the gods have told him that, in order to become
one of them, he has to complete three tests

00:00:57.060 --> 00:00:59.920
in a job interview from Hades.

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:03.460
The first test is to gather the inanimate
objects of unfeasible power.

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:07.720
The second test is to defeat the five guardians
lurking within a labyrinth.

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:13.190
The third test is the test of driving theory.
Mercifully this is an optional test.

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:18.260
The fourth test is to purge as much evil from
the labyrinth as is humanly possible.

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.619
Only when you're done with your tasks will
you be accepted as a god and ascend to the

00:01:21.619 --> 00:01:27.659
halls of Asgard. Or Mount Olympus. Or Aaru.

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.960
I dunno, the game doesn't say which god's
you're attempting to please, it could be Blind

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:34.220
Io and the gang for all I know.

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:39.000
In order to defeat the guardians you need
to find their head lying in some random room

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.799
of the dungeon and then walk into it. That's
it, no epic battle to the death, no game of

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:48.250
skill, nothing. Just pick up the head and
be on your way.

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:52.100
There is some degree of challenge, though.
Every time you pick up a head you have to

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:56.610
spend one full minute in the dead zone; a
barren landscape filled with infinite, respawning

00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:03.479
enemies. If you get hit then you lose a life,
and...um...actually, no, that's it, you just

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.900
lose a life. You still get to keep the guardian
you found, it's almost like the guardians

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:11.060
WANT you to ascend to heaven.

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:14.990
Along the way you need to collect four items
to help you out. The items you need to collect

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:18.310
are as follows:
A bag for carrying things, boots that let

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:23.040
you jump, a throwing hammer for busting some
heads, and a magical helmet with no purpose.

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:28.280
You can only progress through the dungeon
if you find the right items in the right order,

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.690
so the game is kinda like Metroid.

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:35.110
Well, I say the game's like Metroid, it's
much closer to another game called Head over

00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:40.060
Heels; a fantastic game from the 8-bit era,
which I'll probably come to in a future video.

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:44.709
How closely is Super Hero based on Head over
Heels? So closely that the Super Hero makes

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:49.310
the same warbling noise as he walks that Head
and Heels did in their game.

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:53.310
Speaking of walking, it's actually kinda hard
to move yourself around since the controls

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:56.470
are somewhat skewed. At least to my eyes.

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:59.760
Take a look at this room, here. Which way's
north?

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.190
This way?

00:03:01.190 --> 00:03:02.190
No, this way.

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:07.190
So you have to rotate the controls by 90 degrees.
Once you get over that hurdle, though, it's

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:09.660
easy enough to move yourself around.

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:15.970
The gameplay area is big. Immense, really.
There's no simple way of describing the hugeitude

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:21.170
of the area. Look, we're talking Krakens and
Dreadnaughts for jewellery, it's THAT big.

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:23.900
So budding cartographers this one's for you.

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:30.260
As for people who want to complete the game...what
the heck are you doing playing on a CPC? Amstrad

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:34.420
games aren't put there to be completed they're
put here to punish you for your past sins.

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:38.599
And punish you it does! Primarily with the
jump physics.

00:03:38.599 --> 00:03:42.450
Not only is it hard to gauge where you need
to jump in order to hit your target platform,

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:45.340
but you fall down very slowly.

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:49.820
The slow falling isn't a problem in and of
itself, of course, it's just agonising to

00:03:49.820 --> 00:03:53.610
watch your character veeeery slooooowly falling
to his death.

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:58.840
There's not a lot of music in the game - You
get a short tune that plays when you begin

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:02.901
the game, and whenever you die you get a few
little bars from 'Thank you very much' which

00:04:02.901 --> 00:04:03.901
sounds like this.

00:04:03.901 --> 00:04:09.239
[JINGLE]

00:04:09.239 --> 00:04:13.280
Once again, feel free to substitute your own
epic music while playing the game. Something

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:18.030
about the land of the ice and snow or the
fire and the flames. You know, one of the

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:19.889
temperature extremeties.

00:04:19.889 --> 00:04:23.690
Or how about some rock music concerning the
Egyptian gods? Why's there none of that?

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:28.750
Or the Mayans? What, ripping your opponents
still-beating heart out of his chest and holding

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:31.169
it up to appease the sun isn't metal enough
for you?

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:38.050
I think it's the beards, myself. Mayans? No
beards. Egyptians? No beards. Vikings? Beards

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:40.210
that have smaller beards themselves. Epic.

00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:47.400
The graphics are nice enough. Each room has
a different set of four colours and it switches

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:50.290
palette whenever you enter a new room, kinda
like Sweevo's world did.

00:04:50.290 --> 00:04:56.470
This is actually pretty nice since they use
some absolutely GORGEOUS colour combinations.

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:00.580
The only problem with moving from one room
to the next is that it takes about three seconds

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:06.610
to scroll the map. Very few other games did
that and it's annoying that this one does.

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:09.750
To conclude, I kinda like Super Hero.

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:14.570
I've never completed it and I imagine I never
will. The game is massive, and it's randomly

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:18.830
generated to boot, so it's very hard and impossible
to map.

00:05:18.830 --> 00:05:22.290
Nevertheless, it's fun to play for about ten,
fifteen minutes at a time.

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:25.490
And I'm done, so until next time, goodbye.
