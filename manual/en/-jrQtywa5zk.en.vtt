With my dad I used to go out in the forest

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.750 position:98%
and he would teach me the trees and the plants and the mushrooms and things like that

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.500 position:63%
and so I guess I just enjoyed doing that

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:27.000 position:86%
and later on I liked learning a little bit about plants

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.500 position:97%
and things like that so finally when it came time to go to university,

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:34.750 position:80%
I decided that biology would be a neat thing to do.

00:00:34.750 --> 00:00:38.250
So I got into biology and

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:40.750
once I was in biology then

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:45.500 position:89%
I couldn’t decide if I liked plants or animals better so,

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.250 position:81%
I had friends who had already chosen birds or plants

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:52.500 position:97%
and they were already fanatics about these things but I couldn’t decide.

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:57.250 position:80%
And then as I went on with my studies I figured out

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:01.250 position:97%
what I really like is the interactions between different animals or different plants

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:04.000
or animals and plants,

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.500 position:91%
or interactions between the environment and the organisms.

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.250 position:56%
So that’s how I became an ecologist,

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:13.250 position:59%
to study interactions in the food webs

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:17.750 position:97%
and the influence of the animals and plants on the environment

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:22.000 position:98%
and the influence of the environment on the animals and plants.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000 position:98%
the animals and plants on the environment and the influence of the environment on the animals and plants. So then I don’t have to choose if I want to do more animals or more plants.

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:33.500 position:97%
But over time I also figured out I liked a lot the mysteries of what lives in the water,

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:38.500 position:97%
the water looks like it’s all the same everywhere, it’s very flat and it’s transparent

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:44.500 position:98%
and it seems like everything’s the same but once you look under the water and see all the creatures

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:50.750
I got very interested in that and

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.750 position:59%
so then I became an aquatic ecologist.

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.750 position:64%
So, I worked in aquatic ecology for a bit

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:10.250 position:77%
I learn about permafrost, sea ice, tundra plants,

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.750 position:98%
remote sensing, but I’ve done just a tiny bit of aquatic ecology since I’ve been with Parks Canada.

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:17.250 position:78%
So that’s the job of being a monitoring ecologist,

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.000 position:88%
you have to know a lot of things about different things.
