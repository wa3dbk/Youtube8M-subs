00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:10.100
Today I'm going to show you how to use butter
cream to create flowers on top of your cupcakes.

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:17.410
So you can see I have my cupcakes baked and
they have a nice beautiful round top to them.

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:19.610
That's going to be the perfect base for our
flowers.

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:21.810
And I have some beautiful colors of butter
cream.

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:27.330
I have purple and white kind of blended together,
yellow, white, and pink.

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:31.880
So using different tips I'm going to show
you how you can achieve different results.

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:36.440
First I'm going to start with probably the
most complicated which is a little kind of

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:37.910
rustic looking rose.

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:44.070
So you can see I'm using a tip that's almost
like a tear drop shape but very rectangular.

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:45.340
That's going to let me build my leaves.

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:50.100
What I'm going to do is hold my cupcake in
one hand, start in the middle, and just push

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.690
my frosting out.

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:57.239
You want your frosting to be nice and cool
so that it's really holding its shape.

00:00:57.239 --> 00:01:00.820
You can see already we kind of have the bud
in the center of our rose.

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:10.100
What I'm going to do is slowly build leaves
or petals around the base.

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:15.110
You can see while I'm doing that those beautiful
petals are just coming right out.

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:22.810
I'm just pulling and building all the way
around, just little leaves.

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:26.470
This is very kind of rustic, fun looking,
and very easy to do.

00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:33.460
If you're looking for a more complicated rose
you can get into that, but such an easy design

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:38.110
and it really creates a fun, beautiful look.

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:42.850
That's really nice, and you can see how quickly
we did that, a very easy rose.

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:50.979
If I wanted to add leaves I could just go
in and take a bag without a tip and just lightly

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:57.600
make a little bit of a V. You can see I'm
going in one direction and then in the other

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.100
to make a V shape.

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:05.789
What I'm going to do is just kind of push
my frosting, and pull, and let it fall off.

00:02:05.789 --> 00:02:08.940
That's a beautiful, easy leaf.

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:11.030
Do a couple more of those if you want.

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:14.200
Just kind of let it fall off the edge.

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:15.200
Really fun.

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:16.940
So that's number one.

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.120
We're going to get a little more fun than
that.

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:22.100
We're going to move into some pansies.

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:25.659
You can see I took my frosting, and I'm looking
for a two-tone design.

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:32.269
I just put a big sploosh of white in on one
side and a kind of big amount of purple in

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:36.260
on the other, and I'm using a very similar
tip to my rose.

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.459
You can see it still has that same tear drop
shape.

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:40.520
This one is just a little bit smaller.

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:43.599
What I'm going to do is, again, lift up my
cupcake.

00:02:43.599 --> 00:02:45.351
I'm going to go in this direction.

00:02:45.351 --> 00:02:51.260
You can kind of just create leaves and move
all the way around.

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:59.150
You can see as I push it pushes out and makes
these beautiful two-tone flowers.

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:02.630
You can kind of go in the middle and just
fill it in a little bit.

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:04.559
Very easy and fun design.
