Behind-The-Scenes Gameplay Design

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
League of Legends: Dominion is the largest update ever. 

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:17.500
So we wanted to create a new game mode for League of Legends -- and specifically capture and hold -- 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
because capture and hold mechanics add a lot of really cool elements that don't exist in Summoner's Rift.

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:27.500
Veteran League of Legends players will really love Dominion because it really boils down the best elements of the game 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
they already know and love into a short and intense twenty-minute gameplay session.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
There's five capture points on the map, and they all start in a neutral state. 

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:43.000
So it's kind of a race at the beginning for players to establish a strong foothold early in the match. 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Throughout the game players are constantly switching between capturing points -- 

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:52.000
trying to overtake them -- as well as defending points that are being assaulted. 

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
There's more combat; it's more intense. Games are a lot shorter. They can go for 10 to 20 minutes.  

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:04.000
And you also progress your character a lot quicker, so people are getting Infinity Edges, Last Whispers, things like that, 10 to 15 minutes in. 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
We really tried to create as much drama and excitement and back and forth as we possibly could. 

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:15.000
Death timers are far lower than Summoner's Rift. The rate at which you're killing opponents and being killed is much quicker.

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:17.000
It's just a much more frantic pace.

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.500
For experienced players there's a whole new layer of teamwork to master in terms of how you can fake an attack on a point, 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
or how you can group up to take a point; how you can group up to defend. 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:35.000
While Summoner's Rift requires exceptional teamwork to win, I think it only requires it in certain key points in the game. 

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:39.000
Whereas in Dominion, I think that great teamwork is rewarding all of the time.  

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Dominion is fast and Dominion is fun. 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:51.000
The game is focused around small skirmish team fights, so one vs. one, two vs. two, two vs. three if you're unlucky. 

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:54.000
Each game is about twenty minutes in length on average, 

00:01:54.500 --> 00:02:01.000
and we really feel that it just captures a lot of the awesome parts of classic League of Legends without some of the slower parts. 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:10.000
The game's never really over until the last second. It's always possible to come back in Dominion, and so there's no feeling of inevitable loss. 

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:18.000
We've also included a new feature in Dominion that we first revealed in Battle Training, which is the idea of quests.

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:24.500
These quests will appear over the course of the game, and basically incentivize you to perform particular actions on the map. 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:31.000
For instance, maybe you receive a quest that says: "Hey, control the bottom two points and you'll get a large reward."

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:39.000
These sort of quests then break up the flow and change things from what the standard approach may be at the given time.

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:47.000
Dominion is a great example of how League of Legends will continue to push our genre forward. 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000
We've put a huge amount of resources behind Dominion. This is a project that has been massive in scope.  

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:57.000
It's involved artists, engineers, designers. It's a massive effort with dozens and dozens of people 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:01.000
that have been spending months working on this fantastic update.  

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:08.000
It creates this really interesting mechanism that has the whole Riot staff totally addicted to it and wanting to play it constantly. 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.000
And we think our players will really enjoy it as well. 

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.000

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.000
