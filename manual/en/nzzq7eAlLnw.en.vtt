Hey, everyone!

00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:10.270
It’s Matt from Kenhub, and in this tutorial,
we will discuss the right ventricle.

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:14.320
The cardiac ventricles are the two lower chambers
of the heart quadrants.

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:18.680
They are larger and more apically narrowed
than the atria.

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:22.779
Collecting the blood that flows into them
from the atria, they then contract and force

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:30.960
the accumulated blood volume out into the
peripheral tissues via the major vessels.

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.050
The right ventricle collects deoxygenated
blood from the right atrium as the tricuspid

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:42.309
valve relaxes and pumps it via rhythmic contractions
through the pulmonary valve and its roof and

00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:47.610
into the pulmonary trunk which passes the
blood into the pulmonary artery and into the

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:48.690
lungs.

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:57.090
It is bordered anterosuperiorly by the sternum,
and this circular convexed area majorly contributes

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:00.129
to the sternocostal surface of the heart.

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:05.590
The inferior surface is situated upon the
diaphragm and this small flat area makes up

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:12.010
part of the diaphragmatic portion of the heart.

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:18.610
The ventricular septum borders the right ventricle
posteriorly and bulges somewhat into it creating

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:25.470
a transverse semi-lunar cross-section.

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:31.880
The conus arteriosus, conical arterial pouch
or infundibulum of the heart, can be found

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:37.000
in the upper left corner of the ventricle
and gives rise to the pulmonary artery.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.610
The tendon of the conus arteriosus is a fibrous
band that extends superiorly from the right

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:48.479
atrioventricular fibrous ring and stretches
between the posterior surface of the conus

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:53.409
arteriosus and the aorta.

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:58.810
The right ventricular wall is 3-6 times thinner
than the left because it starts off thicker

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:02.079
and reduces en masse towards the apex.

00:02:02.079 --> 00:02:06.670
Despite this difference in muscle mass, the
inner chambers of the ventricles are the same

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:14.099
size and can contain approximately 85 mL of
blood in adults.

00:02:14.099 --> 00:02:19.060
This video is more fun than reading a textbook,
right?

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:25.860

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:33.390
It is time to say goodbye to your old textbooks
and say hello to your new anatomy learning

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:35.220
partner, Kenhub!

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:36.220
See you there!
