00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:13.280
So now that we've loaded up our tracks, it's time to look at the Transport section,

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:16.400
which includes the 16 buttons at the bottom of the controller.

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:21.000
Like all the other buttons on the X1, these also have primary and secondary functions.

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:25.200
There are 8 buttons per deck, with identical functions on each side.

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.000
“Play” is for beginning playback on the corresponding deck.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.360
“Sync” activates the sync function of the corresponding deck.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.500
The “Cue/Rel” button in Traktor's internal playback mode,

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:38.480
this sets a temporary cue point

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:41.840
and the button will light up to indicate a cue point has been set.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.680
Now if you press the button again,

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:47.000
the track will return to that cue point and playback will stop.

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:48.840
So when we hit “Play”,

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:52.000
we stop where we want to drop a temporary cue point,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.200
hit the “Cue/Rel” button,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.360
press “Play” again,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.780
hit “Cue/Rel” and it returns to that cue point.

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.120
Now once the deck is stopped at the temporary cue point,

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.360
we simply push the button and the track

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.480
will play for as long as you keep the button held.

00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.680
You can also use this button for dropping in short loops

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.000
or vocals or samples into your mix as well.

00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:19.720
If you're going to try this, you can easily switch

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:21.880
from the “Cue/Rel” mode into the “Play” mode

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:23.480
by pressing “Play” at the same time.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.280
So if I hold down “Cue/Rel”,

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:30.400
I've got my cue and then just hit “Play”

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:31.920
to swap into “Play” mode.

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:36.900
The “Cup/Abs” button, which is to the right of the “Cue/Rel” button,

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.160
again in Traktor's internal playback mode,

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:42.720
functions the same as “Cue/Rel” but starts playback

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:46.720
from the last temporary cue point instead of stopping playback.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
So let's hit “Play”

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:53.900
we'll set a marker there,

00:01:53.900 --> 00:01:56.000
and you can see that instead of stopping playback,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.480
it goes off the marker and begins playback

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:04.000
right from where you've dropped the marker.

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:06.200
On top of these buttons, we've got big buttons

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.250
which move the current playback position left or right by one beat.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.430
So that's moving back a beat,

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:17.200
and moving forward.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000
Now we can look at the secondary functions of each of these buttons.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.520
To access these you again hold down the “Shift” key.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
So at the bottom we have “Key”,

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.300
which activates the Traktor Keylock function for the corresponding deck.

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:35.900
So we can switch that on or you can switch it off.

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:42.440
"Tap" beside that, this allows you to tap in the tempo for guiding Traktor's Autogrid function in a loaded deck.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.800
We also have 2 cue buttons.

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:48.680
The “Cue” button on the left, will force Traktor's deck back

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.680
to the beginning of the currently loaded track.

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.680
So if I hold down “Shift” and hit that,

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.520
we will return right to the start of the track.

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:58.650
The “Cue” button on the right, this can be used to skip through any saved cue points

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:03.600
in the track, so we can skip through these cue points I saved earlier

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.120
...as simple as that

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000
..and then back to the start with “Cue/Rel”.

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:17.560
The next two buttons activate the corresponding decks' pitch bend,

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.480
which temporarily speeds up or slows down the track,

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:23.000
Again holding down "shift" 

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:28.600
...and you can see the bpm increasing slightly and decreasing slightly. 

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:32.840
The final 2 buttons are for manually increasing or decreasing the tempo

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:34.600
of the corresponding deck,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.400
all the way up, or all the way down.

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.000
Just remember, to access all these secondary functions,

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.200
you do need to keep the “Shift” button pressed down.

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:49.900
In the next video, we will be looking at looping with the X1.
