00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:24.840
I might let him call you back. 

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:26.040
(in regular voice) I talk for a living. 

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:27.680
It's the cartoons. 

00:00:27.700 --> 00:00:30.460
They're the things 
that make the biggest splash. 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:31.960
I'm the voice of Yoda.

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.690

Judge me by my size do you hmmm? 

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:38.870
(in regular voice) I must admit 
I have one of the better 

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:41.060
commutes on the planet Earth. 

00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:42.530
I come out to the kitchen. 

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:44.860
I get a cup of coffee in my KU mug. 

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.820
I walk about 25 feet down
 the hallway to my studio and 

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:51.020
I climb over the baby gate that 
keeps my toddlers from coming in.

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:53.390
I have this equipment that
 attaches to every other studio 

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:54.960
in the world and it does it live. 

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:58.570
I'm actually sitting there talking 
and they're hearing me 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.450
from anywhere in downtown
 Kansas City or even Singapore. 

00:01:02.470 --> 00:01:04.900
I'm actually the 
voice of Disney Asia. 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.020
I actually started doing voiceover
 work professionally when 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:08.660
I was 15 years old. 

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:10.890
I was here in Overland Park, Kansas. 

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:12.550
I was a bored teenager and 
I just thought it would be fun 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:13.870
to hear myself on television. 

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.650
I didn't know anyone got paid for it. 

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:18.460
(in TV voice) For the Jimmy Kimmel show,
 this is Tom Kane. 

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:21.120
(in regular voice) I grew up watching 
Hogan's Heroes and

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:24.670
I Love Lucy. 

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:26.370
I'd come home everyday and 
mom and dad worked so 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:28.160
I would watch television. 

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:32.930
So I got a lot of the characters
 I got were from old TV shows

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:36.560
It's funny because to this day
 I'll work with someone who 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:40.820
is much younger and 
they'll say, "We need an old cowboy." 

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:42.710
(in old cowboy voice) So I'll be 
given' 'em a little show 

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:47.070
of ya know a lil' bit of 
Gabby Hayes or Walter Brennan whoa 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.940
(in regular voice) And they're like, "Wow! 

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:49.880
That's a great character!", 
and I'm like I'm just lifting 

00:01:49.900 --> 00:01:51.510
it you know. 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:56.790
The Academy Awards came 
about as just a fluke I guess. 

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.350
I just got this piece of copy 
and it was a paragraph and my 

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:04.410
agent said it was, you know, 
they were auditioning for an 

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:07.700
announcer for the Academy Awards. 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.170
(in old filmstrip voice) I dialed up the 
sort of Mr. Filmstrip

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:10.250
sort of thing. 

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:11.730
(in regular voice) I got a call a 
few days later saying, 

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:14.260
"Oh congratulations you got 
the Oscars gig."  

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.130
And I'm like,"Great." 
And he goes, "Well so they'll be contacting 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:18.680
you regarding flight 
arrangements and stuff."

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:22.720
I'm like, "For what?" 
And they're like, "Well they want you 

00:02:22.740 --> 00:02:25.850
backstage." 
And I'm like, "For what?"

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:27.340
And they're like, "For the Oscars. 

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:29.320
You're the announcer 
for the Academy Awards."

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:31.440
And I'm like (flabbergasted). 

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:33.740
(in TV voice) In the halls of 
one of the most prestigious 

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:35.710
universities in America… 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.350
(in regular voice) I do anywhere 
from 3 to 5 recording 

00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:41.960
sessions a day and at least
 10 to 15 auditions. 

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:43.580
(in TV voice) A good story… 

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:44.960
(in regular voice) I've got a number of 
movie trailer

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:46.640
campaigns running at the same time. 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:48.970
I do a ton of stuff for Disney Pixar. 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:50.390
My record was 17. 

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:53.190
I did 17 recording sessions 
in one day. 

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:58.870
I moved back here expecting 
to lose 20 or 30% of my work. 

00:02:58.890 --> 00:03:02.970
And I actually increased my 
work load by 20 or 30% 

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:05.290
because I can. 

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:08.270
They know that I'm 10 minutes away 
from a microphone. 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:10.190
(in TV voice) This is Kansas and this 

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:12.340
is our Traditions Night. 

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:16.070
The next century of 
Jayhawks begins now. 

00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:17.520
(in regular voice) My wife and I 
met at KU. 

00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:18.830
We met at Oliver Hall. 

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:22.170
We have one son that's 
already graduated from KU. 

00:03:22.190 --> 00:03:25.710
We have 3 sons that 
are going there now and then

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:28.430
in the fall we have a daughter
 starting and then

00:03:28.450 --> 00:03:29.970
a year after that we have two more. 

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:31.300
And KU is a great school. 

00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:33.250
I'm like why not send them to KU? 

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:34.500
Why not save a little money? 

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:35.970
Every once and a while I get to 
go to Lawrence and 

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:39.710
have lunch with one of my kids
 and see my old haunts

00:03:39.730 --> 00:03:41.720
so it's all good.
