00:00:14.165 --> 00:00:18.215
Non-alcoholic fatty liver
disease is a condition in which

00:00:18.215 --> 00:00:21.293
the accumulation of
excess fat in the liver,

00:00:21.293 --> 00:00:24.290
not due to excessive
alcohol consumption.

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:30.770
It's a very common condition
in clinical practice.

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:33.740
It's affect about 20% of
the world population.

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:39.923
[MUSIC]

00:00:39.923 --> 00:00:43.189
We care about fatty liver
disease because it is one

00:00:43.189 --> 00:00:47.466
of the problem which can cause
liver failure, liver cancer, and

00:00:47.466 --> 00:00:50.840
the need for
liver transplantation.

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:54.400
The presence of extra
fat in the liver

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:58.500
can cause chronic irritation
of the liver cells and

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.040
subsequently can cause
further liver damage.

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:06.112
[MUSIC]

00:01:06.112 --> 00:01:09.931
There are three common causes
of fatty liver disease,

00:01:09.931 --> 00:01:13.420
being overweight,
patient's with diabetes and

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:16.340
also patient's with
high cholesterol.

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:21.360
Keeping in mind some people
with normal body weight

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.010
can have fatty liver disease.

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:29.510
The increasing epidemic of fatty
liver disease has been recently

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:33.750
attributed to overweight and
the high prevalence of diabetes.

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:40.043
[MUSIC]

00:01:40.043 --> 00:01:44.880
Fatty liver disease used to be a
very rare condition in children.

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:49.221
However, recently with the
increasing problem of obesity

00:01:49.221 --> 00:01:50.262
in children,

00:01:50.262 --> 00:01:55.058
fatty liver disease became
affecting about 10% of children.

00:01:55.058 --> 00:01:59.690
[MUSIC]

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:01.542
Early in the course
of the disease,

00:02:01.542 --> 00:02:04.020
many patients have no symptoms.

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.010
However, when the scaring and

00:02:06.010 --> 00:02:08.710
the inflammation of
the liver progress.

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:11.590
Many patients start to
complain of problems

00:02:11.590 --> 00:02:15.900
related to enlargement
of the liver or fatigue.

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.990
If complications happened from
fatty liver disease such as

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:21.560
cirrhosis or complete scaring,

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:26.300
patient can have problems with
bleeding and symptoms of other

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:29.270
complications of liver
disease such as liver cancer.

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:33.923
[MUSIC]

00:02:33.923 --> 00:02:36.749
When we do a blood test for
a patient with fatty liver

00:02:36.749 --> 00:02:40.474
disease, many patients will have
elevated liver function test.

00:02:40.474 --> 00:02:44.654
Imaging modalities can
be very helpful for

00:02:44.654 --> 00:02:48.139
diagnoses of fatty
liver disease,

00:02:48.139 --> 00:02:53.261
such as ultrasound,
CT scan, MRI, or fiber scan.

00:02:53.261 --> 00:02:57.535
Occasionally, patients might
need liver biopsy to assess

00:02:57.535 --> 00:03:00.789
the significance of
the damage in the liver.

00:03:00.789 --> 00:03:06.692
[MUSIC]

00:03:06.692 --> 00:03:10.224
Fatty liver disease in early
stage could be completely

00:03:10.224 --> 00:03:11.810
reversible.

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:16.386
However, if patient continues
to have excess fat in the liver.

00:03:16.386 --> 00:03:21.420
This can lead to complete
scarring of the liver,

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:23.540
or what we call sclerosis.

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:27.840
And subsequently liver failure,
and its complications such as

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:32.875
liver cancer, and the need for
liver transplantation.

00:03:32.875 --> 00:03:36.695
Fatty liver disease become
a more common indication for

00:03:36.695 --> 00:03:39.140
liver transplantation globally.

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:45.191
[MUSIC]

00:03:45.191 --> 00:03:49.280
There is no specific treatment
for fatty liver disease.

00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:53.170
The most important step is
to control the risk factors

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:57.140
to liver disease such as high
cholesterol and controlling

00:03:57.140 --> 00:04:01.870
the blood sugar, and lose
weight for obese individuals.

00:04:01.870 --> 00:04:08.700
[MUSIC]

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:12.548
There are recent studies which
confirm clearly the benefit of

00:04:12.548 --> 00:04:15.140
coffee for
patients with liver disease.

00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:18.820
There have been some suggestions
that drinking two or

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:24.820
three cups of coffee a day
will prevent liver cancer,

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:27.640
and liver scarring in patients
with fatty liver disease.

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:33.171
[MUSIC]

00:04:33.171 --> 00:04:37.466
The most important food to avoid
for patients with fatty liver

00:04:37.466 --> 00:04:41.594
disease, are food rich in
refined sugars, such as bread,

00:04:41.594 --> 00:04:43.510
rice, potatoes and corn.

00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:49.490
Also we recommend for patients
to consume lean meat and

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:52.300
increase the amount
of vegetables and

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:53.470
salads in their diet.

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:58.695
[MUSIC]

00:04:58.695 --> 00:05:02.255
At Johns Hopkins Hospital we
are conducting several clinical

00:05:02.255 --> 00:05:03.390
trials.

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:06.970
Looking for a novel therapy for
fatty liver disease.

00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:11.690
We're using tablets form for
specific drugs that

00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:15.900
alter the pathophysiology
of fatty liver disease.

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:18.750
What we are hoping is to
prevent the accumulation of

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:20.230
fat in the liver.

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:22.880
To reduce the amount of scarring
in the liver from fatty

00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:24.410
liver disease.

00:05:24.410 --> 00:05:29.108
And eventually preventing liver
cancer and liver failure.

00:05:29.108 --> 00:05:36.708
