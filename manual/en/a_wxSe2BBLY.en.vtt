00:00:20.534 --> 00:00:24.895
Aspen habitats are probably the most biologically diverse habitat  in North America. 

00:00:25.305 --> 00:00:27.305
They’re considered to be oasis or hotspots of biodiversity.  

00:00:29.023 --> 00:00:31.023
When you walk through an aspen stand it's music to your ears. 

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:34.970
It supports more species per area than any other habitat we have.

00:00:36.201 --> 00:00:38.201
We’ve got to treat these stands now for restoration.  The objective is restoration.

00:00:42.305 --> 00:00:44.305
But the current aspen stands we know of 
 are at a risk of being lost.

00:00:49.014 --> 00:00:51.014
There has been about 140 years of grazing.

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.449
There has been about 100 years of fire suppression

00:00:53.919 --> 00:00:55.919
and 80, 90 years of timber harvest.

00:00:56.187 --> 00:00:58.187
And so the existing problem now is of 
 the stands that we know are present

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:02.579
the ones that we can find and see on 
 the landscape, are in a degraded condition.

00:01:05.263 --> 00:01:07.263
The most common risk factor on our district has been conifer encroachment.

00:01:10.669 --> 00:01:12.669
Aspen are extremely shade intolerant

00:01:13.338 --> 00:01:15.338
so as they get over topped by conifers, 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:17.540
they tend to be out competed and become ill 
 or diseased and will die off.  

00:01:19.774 --> 00:01:21.774
And I’m actually worried that our restoration efforts won’t 
 happen quick enough for some of the stands,

00:01:24.949 --> 00:01:26.949
that we might lose them before we even get it done on the ground.  Some of 
 our stands are in that bad of shape where you have just one standing aspen left.

00:01:33.424 --> 00:01:35.424
A number of the aspen stands on the district have declined to the point where 
 they’re the only thing that’s left is just a handful of sprouts. 

00:01:40.764 --> 00:01:42.760
This is an example of one of them. 

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.000
Basically this is the last remaining living aspen in this area right now. 

00:01:47.204 --> 00:01:49.200
And once they’re gone, once they’re dead like this, there is 
 no proven means of restoring them to the site. 

00:01:54.077 --> 00:01:56.080
We have conducted a district-wide inventory of aspen across this 330,000 acre district.

00:01:59.617 --> 00:02:01.620
It’s been about eight years in the making and 
 we have GPS’d or mapped every aspen stand.

00:02:05.153 --> 00:02:07.150
We think we have a pretty complete inventory that so far totals 
 about 700 stands and about 3,700 acres of aspen. 

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
Of our 700 stands, about 75% are at a 
 high or highest risk of being lost,

00:02:18.102 --> 00:02:20.100
about 4% are healthy, and 6% have been totally dead. 

00:02:22.707 --> 00:02:24.710
So we have actually found more dead stands than healthy stands. 

00:02:26.863 --> 00:02:28.860
Aspen’s a fascinating tree.

00:02:29.013 --> 00:02:31.010
Basically this system is set up for disturbance.

00:02:33.086 --> 00:02:35.090
There’s a root system under the ground and when there’s 
 enough hormones in the root to promote suckering,

00:02:39.857 --> 00:02:41.860
which is producing new stems off the roots, 
 then out comes a new sucker. 

00:02:45.648 --> 00:02:47.650
It breaks out of the ground and starts growing as its own independent stem.

00:02:49.503 --> 00:02:51.500
Maybe it’s sharing, for a long time it’s sharing the 
 same root system as the parent tree. 

00:02:53.437 --> 00:02:55.440
And we know they only have a life expectancy 
 on the average about 60 to 120 years.

00:02:58.542 --> 00:03:00.540
The actual clone, the presence of that genetic identity,

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:04.600
could be some people think up to thousands of years old. 

00:03:07.217 --> 00:03:09.220
Aspen are primarily a clonal species in that the primary means 
 of regeneration is through sprouting from a common root system.

00:03:14.627 --> 00:03:16.630
Seeding events are exceedingly rare. 

00:03:16.694 --> 00:03:18.690
A successful seeding event may be on the 
 order of hundreds or thousands of years.

00:03:20.731 --> 00:03:22.730
Once an aspen stand dies, there’s no proven 
 means of restoring aspen to that area.

00:03:26.403 --> 00:03:28.400
So the existing amount of aspen we have on the 
 landscape is basically all we are going to have.

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:36.480
So our approach is to remove conifers within and adjacent to the aspen stand.

00:03:39.316 --> 00:03:41.320
And we typically will remove conifers from about 150 feet on the south, east and west 
 sides of the stand and 100 feet to the north to maximize sun exposure.

00:03:50.194 --> 00:03:52.190
The purchaser, whoever buys the material, they have to remove the 
 small logs and the biomass in the same operation. 

00:03:56.748 --> 00:03:58.750
So what happens is we have one entry into the stand, 

00:03:59.336 --> 00:04:01.340
so soil compaction is limited so that we don’t have damage to the stand.

00:04:03.173 --> 00:04:05.170
What we are looking at here is a landing where 
 they’re bringing in saw logs today and biomass.

00:04:09.413 --> 00:04:11.410
And he takes it over and they are piling it 
 on that back pile that you’re looking at. 

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:15.150
That’s the biomass, the small trees that will be chipped 
 up and taken to the wood fired power plants.

00:04:19.201 --> 00:04:21.200
The Lassen National Forest is very fortunate because 
 it has the infrastructure around it. 

00:04:24.361 --> 00:04:26.360
And the location of that biomass plant to the 
 material coming out of the woods is critical.

00:04:29.299 --> 00:04:31.300
We need to be within about 50 miles of a biomass plant 
 because it costs so much to haul the material. 

00:04:35.943 --> 00:04:37.940
We are very unique here in Northeastern California that we have an infrastructure

00:04:38.976 --> 00:04:40.980
of five small log mills and, more importantly, we have stand-alone wood 
 fired power plants that use chips to produce the power.

00:04:46.683 --> 00:04:48.680
One load of biomass removed from the National Forests will supply 
 enough power for approximately an hour to 10,000 homes.

00:04:54.525 --> 00:04:56.520
So we are helping to improve the forest health 
 and we are also producing green power. 

00:04:58.495 --> 00:05:00.500
So it’s a win-win situation for us.

00:05:01.832 --> 00:05:03.830
Aspen management really isn’t about a tree, it’s about a habitat. 

00:05:07.871 --> 00:05:09.870
We really have to think about how we manage across 
 all the forest, all these different habitat types,

00:05:14.244 --> 00:05:16.240
and aspen being one of the most important ones.

00:05:15.913 --> 00:05:17.910
We know we have lost most of it.

00:05:17.347 --> 00:05:19.350
We live in a conifer sea up here and so 
 these unique habitats are really disproportionately important to wildlife,

00:05:23.187 --> 00:05:25.190
and they are such a small part of our landscape, that’s 
 where we really want to pinpoint our conservation efforts.

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:31.210
All the grasses and seeds and all the herbaceous material 
 produced provides feed for hundreds of bugs and insects.

00:05:37.244 --> 00:05:39.240
It’s like a big lunch counter.

00:05:39.837 --> 00:05:41.840
It’s probably the most diverse habitat in the Sierra Nevada for birds.

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:45.340
So from a conservation organizations perspective,

00:05:45.943 --> 00:05:47.940
it’s really our, one of one of our top 
 priorities in the Sierra Nevada is aspen restoration.

00:05:50.581 --> 00:05:52.580
It’s really the aspen community that we are trying to 
 restore, not just aspen as a single species.

00:05:55.796 --> 00:05:57.800
But it’s the aspen plus it’s all the other 
 plants that come in with the aspen stands,

00:06:00.257 --> 00:06:02.260
it's the grasses, the forbs and shrubs that 
 make up that community.   

00:06:04.127 --> 00:06:06.130
And it’s really those associated plants, that host of plant species, 
 that provide the ecological value in an aspen community.

00:06:15.072 --> 00:06:17.070
What you really look at is how that system functions more than just a 
 meadow or just some aspect for wildlife or timber or something else.

00:06:24.705 --> 00:06:26.700
To me it’s looking at the whole system.

00:06:29.581 --> 00:06:31.580
We’ve treated about 20% of our stands so far.

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:35.180
Every stand that we have done this treatment to has responded. 

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:38.760
Within even one or two years after these treatments, 

00:06:38.893 --> 00:06:40.890
which are just really removing the conifers,

00:06:40.731 --> 00:06:42.730
just doing that alone we're seeing a spike in bird diversity.

00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:45.700
We do get a very, fairly quick response, within 
 three or four or five years, 

00:06:48.157 --> 00:06:50.160
you can go back to a site and see six, eight-foot aspen sprouts 
 plus all the other plant species that come in with it. 

00:06:54.978 --> 00:06:56.980
I've been able to see change on landscape 
 and there's nothing more rewarding than 

00:06:59.816 --> 00:07:01.820
walking into a stand where you couldn't see two feet 
 in front of you and all of a sudden

00:07:04.855 --> 00:07:06.860
there's a view of aspen and a meadow with these old-growth pine trees.

00:07:08.859 --> 00:07:10.860
I could retire tomorrow feeling like I've accomplished something in my career, 

00:07:13.093 --> 00:07:15.090
just knowing that I was a part of 
 seeing aspen restoration on the District. 

00:07:18.832 --> 00:07:20.830
This Aspen stand will dominate this site for sixty 
 to eighty to a hundred years. 

00:07:23.304 --> 00:07:25.300
So this is going to be a successful treatment and like you said 
 David, this stand will be here for a long time to come.

00:07:29.579 --> 00:07:31.580
And what better legacy to leave behind than 
 a healthy aspen component across this landscape.
