00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:10.170
What do you think of GE vs Kenmore water softeners?

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:15.680
Kenmore's latest generation of water softeners
use up to twenty percent less salt.

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:19.160
Salt is not the biggest expense with a water
softener.

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:22.230
It also uses up to a third less water.

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.720
Meaning it uses about twenty percent less
water.

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.240
How does it use the water, again?

00:00:28.240 --> 00:00:33.370
To clean the salt or softener resin pellets
so it can remove the minerals from it.

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:38.190
Water softener resin is expensive no matter
which manufacturer you choose.

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:42.429
One cubic foot of it is around eighty dollars
for the good stuff.

00:00:42.429 --> 00:00:46.649
Kenmore's Elite hybrid water softener and
its ultra high efficiency water softener are

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:49.860
essentially the same, in terms of specs and
performance.

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:53.750
They are also made by EcoWater for Kenmore.

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:59.620
If you buy a Kenmore appliance, there is as
much chance it was made by Whirlpool as Amana.

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:02.589
That does not give me confidence in its quality.

00:01:02.589 --> 00:01:07.540
Whirlpool is better than Amana for most types
of appliances, but I want to know what I'm

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:08.540
getting.

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.810
You'll do just as well with the ultra high
efficiency one as you would the Kenmore Elite

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:16.630
Hybrid water softener, though you'd spend
a third of the cost.

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:20.340
Or I could just go directly to EcoWater.

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:25.180
EcoWater's brand name appliances are three
times as costly as Kenmore.

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:27.479
That's making GE's prices look reasonable.

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:32.080
At least GE's water softeners are cheaper
than Morton's.

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.120
And get better reviews.

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:35.640
Morton makes salt.

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.560
Or, rather, sells salt.

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.030
They sell water softeners, too.

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.490
How are expensive are they?

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:47.890
Morton's water softeners are often 20% more
costly than GE's.

00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:53.610
And GE's 45K grain water softener is $800
or so.

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.310
I think all water softeners are expensive.

00:01:57.310 --> 00:02:03.720
Kenmore's cheaper model, 38350, is a little
under five hundred dollars, though that does

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.000
not include installation.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.770
It never does.

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.030
That's like the limited warranties that cover
everything that doesn't break.
