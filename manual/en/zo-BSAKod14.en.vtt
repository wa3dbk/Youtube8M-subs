00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:07.080
Arming the Union, a new Civil War exhibit
at the American Precision Museum in

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:08.149
Windsor, Vermont,

00:00:08.149 --> 00:00:11.290
shows how precision machines enabled
skilled workers

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:15.530
to produce innovative weapons for the
Union Army with features including

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:18.700
interchangeable parts and rifled barrels.

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:23.199
These innovations help the North win the Civil War.

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:27.550
The American Precision Museum's exhibit
also includes an innovative feature of

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:31.559
its own, a 3D animation of an 1853

00:00:31.559 --> 00:00:34.300
automatic rifling machine.

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:38.030
While the Robbins &amp; Lawrence rifling
machine is fascinating in its own right,

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:41.690
the actual cutting the rifling grooves
can't be seen

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:44.200
because it happens inside the gun barrel.

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:48.339
Additionally, the machine cannot be operated for
museum visitors

00:00:48.339 --> 00:00:51.870
due to the fragile and irreplaceable
nature of it's parts

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.390
By virtually bringing the machine to
life,

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:59.620
the 3d animation shows the complex
movements of the machine

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:03.699
and through the magic of animation the
viewer can see the cutting action

00:01:03.699 --> 00:01:06.000
inside the barrel.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.960
Ann Lawless, Executive Director of the
American Precision Museum,

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:15.370
is excited about including an animation as part of the Arming The Union exhibit.

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:19.780
According to Ann, animation is the best
possible way to get inside

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:21.800
a nineteenth century machine.

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:26.680
Demonstratives' Engineers and Animators brought its subtle mechanisms to life

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:31.000
making all the activities of the machine
completely clear.

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:35.740
The rifling machine created a special
challenge for DI.

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:38.980
The machine could only be operated by
hand

00:01:38.980 --> 00:01:43.900
in a very limited way, and had no
surviving engineering drawings or schematics.

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.640
By carefully recording measurements of
the components

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.450
and taking detailed photographs of all
aspects of the machine,

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.770
along with video of the machine in limited
operation,

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:59.240
the skilled engineers at DI were able to
create a working digital model

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.679
of a machine that was in action over 150
years ago.

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:07.549
The American Precision museum's exhibit
opened on Memorial Day.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:11.510

Precision Museum

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.730
rifling machine, go to americanprecision.org.
