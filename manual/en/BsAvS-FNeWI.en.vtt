00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:10.930
Sam here from Creativeminds.

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:15.000
If you're looking for a simple way to add
image and HTML pop-up ads to different pages

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.830
on your Wordpress site, the Creativeminds
Pop-up Banner Plugin allows you to create

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:25.320
an infinite number of beautiful ad campaigns
with a whole range of display options.

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:29.590
Including randomized or selected banners,
advanced show effects and delay timings, as

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:31.570
well as specific activity dates.

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:35.860
The plugin also collects information about
the impressions and clicks for your ad campaigns

00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:40.080
and generates statistical reports about how
your campaigns are performing.

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:41.710
So let's start with some examples.

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:45.750
This is an image pop-up banner that appears
immediately when you open this particular

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:50.309
content page and when you click on the banner
it brings you directly to that particular

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:51.490
web page.

00:00:51.490 --> 00:00:56.309
Now we're going to have an example of a fly
in banner that appears after three seconds

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:57.949
that someone has been on a page.

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:02.820
Again it's an image campaign and when you
click on that image it will bring you to the

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:05.100
content page advertised in the image.

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:07.920
The third example is an HTML campaign.

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.930
It's a simple color banner with text and the
text is also a link so when you click on it

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.270
it will bring you to the Creativeminds blog.

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:17.270
Creating a campaign is very simple.

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:22.380
Give the campaign a name, then you add your
advertisement items which are the actual banners.

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:28.920
You can add an image or you can create an
HTML campaign and use our ad designer, you

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:34.580
can customize the font, create a description,
and choose the font color, size and alignment

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:36.600
and do the same for the title.

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:42.590
Give it any border that you would like including
different borders and styles.

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:49.649
You can control text padding, so you can center
or left align that text if you want and you

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.780
can also control the banner size.

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.759
What this ad designer does is create a code
based on all of these customization options

00:01:56.759 --> 00:02:01.921
and you can simply just copy that code and
paste it into the advertisement time and it

00:02:01.921 --> 00:02:05.280
will automatically generate your customized
ad campaign.

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.920
Next we have some basic, visual customization
options.

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:13.400
The type of campaign can either be a pop-up
or a fly in and you saw exampled of both.

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:18.360
The display method, so you can choose for
this campaign to display a random banner or

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:21.730
a selected banner if you've created multiple
within one campaign.

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:26.750
You can define the width and height of the
banner, give it a specific background color

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:30.790
and also decide if the banner has rounded
or sharp edges.

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:35.000
Advanced visual options include a bunch of
different show effects and you can really

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:37.230
have fun with these different show effects.

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:40.970
You can also use a delay time, so we saw an
example of this.

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:46.890
You could have the image appear after three
seconds, ten seconds, whenever you choose.

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:50.570
The show interval so you can have this ad
campaign show the first time that the page

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:53.290
loads or every single time it loads.

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:57.810
And you can also define how you want the statistics
for clicks to be calculated.

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:02.840
Finally, under the activity settings, you
chanteuse whether you want this pop-up banner

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:07.370
to show on every page of your site, if you
only want it to show on particular urls matching

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:13.060
a specific pattern or you can actually choose
specific pages or posts and add as many as

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:14.060
you would like.

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:19.260
Finally, you can choose activity dates for
that pop-up banner to appear and you can define

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:20.750
it down to the minute.

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:25.380
This way you can create campaigns in advance
that you only want to appear for specific

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:28.790
time whether it's for a promotion or holiday
sale.

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:32.850
Under the general option what's really cool
is you can add in a geolocation API key and

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:38.950
this way you can know where the people are
coming from who see and click on your banners.

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:41.400
Finally we have our statistics.

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:45.880
You can get a daily report of all of the impressions
and clicks going on for all the different

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:47.760
campaigns on your website.

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:52.470
You can also get reports by period and this
display shows all of you campaign names and

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:57.440
how many impressions and clicks they got during
a specific period of time.

00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:03.430
Finally, your access log gives you a visual
report of those impressions and clicks in

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:04.850
a specific time frame.

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:09.350
So you can really see the progress and performance
of your different ad campaigns and know where

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:11.240
you have to make some changes if needed.

00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:15.220
The CM Pop-Up Banner Plugin is the perfect
solution to create and track the performance

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:18.440
of pop-up banner ads on your Wordpress site.
