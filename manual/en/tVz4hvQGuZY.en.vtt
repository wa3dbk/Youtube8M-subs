00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:07.270
Dead Trigger is not going to win any prizes
for creativity.

00:00:07.270 --> 00:00:11.330
This is a game where you blow basketball-sized
holes in the heads of zombies, while your

00:00:11.330 --> 00:00:16.810
dumbass hero delivers cliche one-liners like
"goodnight!" and "down for the count".

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:21.630
One munch-sized stage is prefaced by "Objective:
kill zombies".

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:23.900
That could effectively sum up every level.

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:25.470
It could be the App Store description.

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:28.029
Hell, it could be the title.

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:32.450
There are three (count them) different zombies,
who roam about a handful of maps, and it's

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:34.100
your job to kill them.

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:37.660
Different level types involve staying alive
before the time runs out, killing a set number

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:41.990
of walkers, schlepping boxes about the level,
or defending some door.

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:43.990
Consumable items help mix things up.

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:47.960
For example, you might want to prop a turret
or a deadly rotating laser beam by one of

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.220
your defence points to ward off zombies.

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:53.710
Then again, these are locked away until you
reach such a high rank that you might never

00:00:53.710 --> 00:00:55.480
get to use most of them.

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:56.890
The controls are serviceable.

00:00:56.890 --> 00:01:01.610
You're going to have to sacrifice either moving
or aiming while shooting, but that's a necessary

00:01:01.610 --> 00:01:03.660
evil for touchscreen shooters.

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:07.780
It also takes too long to turn around, and
the weapon change button is too far away from

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:08.810
the other controls.

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:12.439
But the simple act of shooting zombies in
the face works fine.

00:01:12.439 --> 00:01:14.740
Dead Trigger ostensibly has a story.

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.130
There's one pre-rendered cut-scene, and the
rest of the tale is delivered in poorly written

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:19.130
text boxes.

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:23.329
In reality, this game is about showing off
Madfinger's graphical prowess.

00:01:23.329 --> 00:01:27.479
The visuals are impressive, once again raising
the mobile bar (by quite a few notches).

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:31.690
The detailed guns, sharp lightning, and fancy
effects make it an excellent showcase of the

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:34.090
new iPad's GPU, for example.

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:37.409
Dead Trigger costs 69p, but that won't get
you the full game.

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:42.140
There are six premium guns - including the
super-powerful mini-gun - that cost gold bars.

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.450
That's a secondary currency that you can only
get through in-app purchases, or by completing

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:48.909
offers like signing up for free trials at
Netflix.

00:01:48.909 --> 00:01:53.240
All in all, you'll need to pay an extra £1.20
to actually get all the content.

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:59.229
If you want the speed, damage, and money multipliers
too that'll bring the extra cost up to £2.99.

00:01:59.229 --> 00:02:04.009
There's no way to get this stuff without getting
out your credit card or filling in a survey.

00:02:04.009 --> 00:02:06.179
Dead Trigger is dumb fun.

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:10.040
It's got less brains than a starving zombie,
and it'll get old long before you unlock the

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:14.000
coolest guns, but the basic gunplay is fun
and fast.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.410
Icky in-app purchases and control issues dull
the sheen, but it's a pleasant distraction.
