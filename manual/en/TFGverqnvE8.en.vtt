Today's Topic: How Does a Precious Metals IRA Work

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:10.180
Hi, I'm Terry White, CEO of Sunwest Trust, and this is Tuesday at Two.  

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:12.490
Thank you for being with us this afternoon.  

00:00:12.490 --> 00:00:17.660
We're continuing now in our self-directed IRA investment examples, 

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:20.130
and today, I wanted to talk to you about precious metals. 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.330
Seems like a lot of people want to invest in precious metals with an IRA, 

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:26.640
and that might or might not be a good idea for your situation, 

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.390
I'm not really here to tell you if that's a good investment, or not, 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:32.070
but what I am going to do, is explain to you how to do it.  

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:36.110
So, basically, there are two ways that you can do it; 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:39.290
the first way, let's talk about buying the precious metals, 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:43.120
directly in your IRA, here at Sunwest Trust.  

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:46.620
So, what you would do, is you would find a precious metals broker, 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:49.190
that you trust, and want to do business with, 

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:53.790
and, then you would negotiate to buy whatever you're going to buy, careful, 

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:57.980
and make sure that you're buying precious metals that are allowed in your IRA, 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:03.130
there are some collectible coins that wouldn't be allowed in your IRA.  

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:07.040
Right? So, make sure what you're investing in is allowed in an IRA, 

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:10.940
if you have questions about that, you could use our Ask The Expert button 

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:14.440
on the bottom left-hand side of our homepage of our website.  

00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:18.940
But you negotiate that, and you would send us a direction of investment, 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:22.420
telling us to purchase those metals 

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:24.590
that you've already negotiated to buy from that broker.  

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:29.600
The metals would then be shipped from that broker, to Delaware depository, 

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.700
which is where we keep all of our precious metals, they're in Delaware, 

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:38.940
if you'd like to know more about that, particular place that we hold those, 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:41.810
you can go, you can Google 'Delaware Depository', 

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.180
they have a website, that gives you a lot of information.  

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:50.180
It's a very secure site, and they will hold that, that metal, in your name, 

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:55.260
in an account there in your name, and will also have a record of what you purchased, 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:57.560
in your account here with Sunwest Trust.  

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.830
And you will get a statement from us, showing that that metal is there.  

00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:05.780
So, that's when you buy it directly in your IRA.  

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:09.090
The second option you have, is to do an LLC, 

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:12.690
which we've talked about, where you form an LLC, 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.640
and have your IRA buy all the membership units in that LLC.  

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:18.890
But then you have the LLC buy the precious metals.  

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.690
Now, what a lot of people do, and where they make a mistake, is, 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:25.600
they go out and buy the precious metals, in their LLC, 

00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:28.560
and then, maybe they put them under their mattress, 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:29.960
or they bury it in their backyard.  

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:35.960
The Internal Revenue code is clear, that the assets have to be held by a custodian.  

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:40.610
So, the asset of the LLC, is the precious metal, 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:43.570
and that needs to be held in a depository; 

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:45.970
so, you could contact Delaware Depository, 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:51.970
I assume they would let you hold investments, or metals, in the name of your LLC; 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:56.150
or, what a lot of people do, is they may take it to a bank, 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.920
and open a safety-deposit box, in the name of their LLC.  

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:02.220
So, the main thing there, is it has to be held by someone, 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:06.810
that has the authority to do that, which would be the bank, or depository.  

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:09.680
So, those are the two ways in which you could buy precious metals.  

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.400
It might be a great investment for you, 

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.200
I know I personally own some precious metal in my IRA, 

00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.970
and I bought it several years ago, so it's done very well, 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:21.080
but then, it also, as every investment, could go up or down, 

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:24.160
so you need to be aware of that.  

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:25.040
So, we will continue on next time 

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:28.820
we'll talk about more examples of investments you can make in your LLC, 

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:32.460
and I hope you take the time to come back next Tuesday, and watch our next video.  

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:38.460
Thank you.
