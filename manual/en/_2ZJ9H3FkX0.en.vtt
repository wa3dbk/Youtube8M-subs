00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:06.700
So are you interested in knowing the different
reviews regarding a flexible partial denture?

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:09.890
Well my name is Michelle and I'm a dental
assistance with Solutionz and we are going

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:16.240
to talk today about the pros when it comes
to a flexible partial denture. Basically this

00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:22.560
is what a partial denture looks like. It is
called partial denture because it is only

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:28.689
replacing part of your teeth in your mouth,
only the ones that you are missing and flexible

00:00:28.689 --> 00:00:36.550
because the acrylic is half based, it is 50%
acrylic and then 50% of a rubber based material

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:43.170
which in return hence it gets its name flexible.
What is, it is great because there is a lot

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.300
less adjusting with a flexible partial denture
than there is with an acrylic because an acrylic

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:54.469
is much harder and with a flexible one it
actually flexes to fit your mouth so you don't

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:58.190
have to keep going back to your general dentist
and getting adjustments done all the time

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:03.420
in order to form it to fit into your mouth.
It actually just basically custom fits itself

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:10.350
to your mouth. The type of base material that
is on a partial denture, it heats up with

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.709
the warmth of your mouth and then therefore
becomes a lot more pliable and flexible so

00:01:14.709 --> 00:01:19.869
there is a lot less adjustments. Also too
there is a lot less times that you have to

00:01:19.869 --> 00:01:26.079
go see the dentist. Plus too you can actually
choose a different kind of color of the acrylic

00:01:26.079 --> 00:01:31.499
so therefore it can match the shade of the
gums in your mouth. Then basically it is a

00:01:31.499 --> 00:01:37.430
lot more comfortable to wear and it is a lot
easier to get used to because you will not

00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:43.539
tend to get as many sore spots as you would
with an acrylic denture so basically the pros

00:01:43.539 --> 00:01:47.939
when it comes to a flexible partial denture
is it fits a lot better and there is a lot

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:52.889
less down time for you when it comes to getting
a new flexible partial denture. Once again

00:01:52.889 --> 00:01:56.489
my name is Michelle and I'm a dental assistant
with Solutionz and I just explained to you

00:01:56.489 --> 00:01:59.399
the different reviews on a flexible partial
denture.
