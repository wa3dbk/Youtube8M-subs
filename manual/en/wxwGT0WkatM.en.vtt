00:00:00.909 --> 00:00:05.759
Hey you think different right? You made a
super smart choice by buying that mid

00:00:05.759 --> 00:00:09.559
2009 macbook pro, you know, except for all the money you spent on it.

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:13.910
Let's say hypothetically you need to
replace the battery

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:18.020
or track pad, because hypothetically a Mac can break.

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:22.580
And you don't know any geniuses or
maybe it's out of warranty

00:00:22.580 --> 00:00:26.250
and it's just not the same since Tim Cook took over.  Or you know,

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.490
whatever.  It's pretty easy to tell
if your track pad is out of whack.

00:00:30.490 --> 00:00:35.360
It starts jumping around erratically. This is sort of a common problem

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.739
and it's super easy to fix.  I suggest
googling

00:00:38.739 --> 00:00:43.379
"erratic track pad mac book pro" first- just
to do a little research and see if you

00:00:43.379 --> 00:00:44.809
can fix it in other ways-

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:48.940
by positive thinking or snake oil.  Okay so you've

00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:52.969
Googled and Googled- or maybe you're just not a positive person.  And you

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:57.160
just want to replace the track pad. To do this you're gonna need a few tools.

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:03.059
First of all, the track pad was pretty
easy to find on eBay for about 35 bucks.

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:07.360
You just need a few tools- a tiny
Phillips head screwdriver,

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:10.619
a tri-wing screwdriver and a beer.

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.200
Since you probably don't have a tri-wing
screwdriver

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:18.430
unless you're into fixin' shit.   You can find
one cheap on eBay.

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:21.430
The beers there for you to enjoy, you
know, or to spill

00:01:21.430 --> 00:01:26.950
all over the exposed electronics.  Okay
so open the damn case.

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:29.950
Just remove the screws with the Philips
head screw driver.

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:34.540
Ideally there's 10 of them.  Or in the case your shit's not nice

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:37.689
like this one. Some may have already
fallen out.

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:41.780
Okay so you gonna take out 8 to 10
screws or whatever.

00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:45.500
Uhh.. you notice that there's gonna be a
few screws near the

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.880
hinge that are a little bit longer.  Just
make a note of where they go.

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:52.700
Alright that  was easy, now your genius!

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.290
No not that kind of genius- just an Apple Genius.

00:01:56.290 --> 00:02:02.009
Alright now if you just need to replace
the battery, this will save you some time

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:05.930
The batteries held in place by those two
tri-wing screws.

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:09.310
Remove those then remove the battery
connector. Since I

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:13.370
don't have to replace my battery- you're going to have to imagine me putting in a

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:17.560
new one and replacing the case.  You can probably stop watching the video

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:17.890
now.  You know, you've got

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:23.290
things to do.  So you're sticking around

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:27.060
because you need to finish up the track pad. You've got that art

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:27.870
project... and video with bizarre

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:31.760
religious symbolism doesn't edit itself, right?

00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.670
Right.  So to get to the track pad

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:38.700
of course you have to remove the battery.
Which you've already done.

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:42.739
Cool.  You're awesome.  Now take the screwdriver

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:45.970
remove the tiny brackets used to hold
the track pad in place.

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:51.830
You may need have some tweezers on hand to pick them up.

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:55.200
There's a total of eight- four screws per side.

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:58.599
After removing the screws, unplug the track pad

00:02:58.599 --> 00:03:01.640
from its connector. You're gonna say "well
umm...

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:04.819
you didn't actually pull up the connector!"
Well I did, but I forgot

00:03:04.819 --> 00:03:09.580
to have the camera rolling.  But you see that thing to the right of the screen

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:12.900
to the right of the track pad, that's the connector.  It's a simple

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:16.650
pry up motion.  Kinda like the battery
connector.  Then lift up

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.680
and pull out the track pad.  It's kind of
awkward and it

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:24.140
isn't quite as easy as this video makes it look- but that's what editing is for.

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:28.129
To make something look like it took 5
minutes when it really took 30 minutes.

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:35.129
Okay so awkwardly put the new track pad in.  Then for stability make sure the

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:36.190
computer is lying flat and it's not

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:40.440
opened at all.  Replace those eight
screws, they're

00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:43.590
tiny- so keep the tweezers close by

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:50.590
in case you have the shakes.

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:56.180
Plug in the track pad connector.  Throw that damn battery pack back in-

00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:00.709
with confidence, because you fixed something.

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:06.090
Don't forget  to plug the battery back in. And

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:09.280
grab that nice cover for the bottom of your computer. I don't know

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:16.280
it's called an aluminum cover or something.

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:17.060
Now replace the 8 to 10 screws.

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:24.060
It should be 10 but  remember this one was missing a few.

00:04:28.270 --> 00:04:35.270
And the meth should kick in right about now.

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:39.919
Alright so flip it over, turn it on, and
marvel at your skills.

00:04:39.919 --> 00:04:43.079
Skills possessed by only the most elite

00:04:43.079 --> 00:04:50.079
of retail mall technicians.  And as a

00:04:52.100 --> 00:04:54.560
finishing thought, how about you clean up
your computer.

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:56.560
It's filthy.  Computer repaired was a Mid 2009

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:58.560
Macbook Pro 13" 2.26 Ghz Core 2 Duo. This repair might work on several other

00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:00.560
Macbook Pro models, but Google it first before attempting.  Video by M. Hanlen.
