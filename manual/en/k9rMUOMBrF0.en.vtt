00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:12.120
We have a interesting unit here. This item
is called water chiller. This unit on the

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:18.440
wall, which cost us eight thousand dollars
is called water meter water chiller. This

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:23.980
is connected to a cooling unit in the back.
It takes the water and keeps it the temperature

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:30.560
that you want. So, I could tell this machine
that I want so many liters of water at a particular

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:37.330
temperature. I can use liters or gallons,
or I can use Centigrade or Fahrenheit as my

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:43.940
measurement units. It's interchangeable. So,
I've told the machine that I need four pounds

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:53.649
of water and I need it to be about sixty degree
temperature. And, I'll take my unit, and I

00:00:53.649 --> 00:01:02.330
put my hook on it, and I press start. It will
give me the water. So, I've got enough amount

00:01:02.330 --> 00:01:13.139
of water. Now, in all of the formulas, water
is variable. So, water is not always exact,

00:01:13.139 --> 00:01:21.159
it's approximate. You always have to tinker
with it a little bit. I set the time, and

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:29.619
I have the proper rotation, and I turn on
the machine. As you notice, it's moving very

00:01:29.619 --> 00:01:36.240
slow. At first, it's going to move very slow
to mix all of the ingredients. Once the ingredients

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:43.649
is mixed, I've told it that after ten minutes,
hit the higher speed for another fifteen minutes,

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:49.539
so it does that automatically. As you can
see, we've got a hook that is stationary mixing,

00:01:49.539 --> 00:01:54.779
then we've got a rotating bowl. This is the
best way to mix the dough. You don't tear

00:01:54.779 --> 00:02:03.289
it, you don't heat it up, you don't alter
the temperature. It's perfect. It's perfect.

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:06.950
So, we give it some time, and we're going
to go back to the cookies in a minute. You're

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:12.230
going to give it some to mix the ingredients
and in about six more minutes, seven more

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:17.430
minutes, it's going to hit into this faster
speed. I need to add a little more water to

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:28.680
it though. It feels kind of dry. Then we're
going to give it a little more time to see

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:33.720
if we need to add more water or if it's just
fine as much water you put it in.
