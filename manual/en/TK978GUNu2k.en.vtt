Today is new glasses day for me, you guys!

00:00:03.159 --> 00:00:07.319
and this time, I would love it if you would
help me to narrow down my options for a

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:08.050
new pair.

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:11.480
This video is sponsored by Warby
Parker which I'm excited about because I was

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:15.230
already considering getting some glasses
from them when they contacted me

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:18.869
I thought about ordering a Home Try-on package from their website, but when I found out that they

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:22.300
have a store only about an hour away
from me, I decided to make a trip

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:26.779
and try on some glasses there. Because I am
ridiculously indecisive I would love to

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:29.210
hear which of these frames you guys
think I should get

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:32.270
but while I try them on, I'm going to 
tell you a bit about my personal

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:34.340
experience with being a glasses wearer

00:00:34.340 --> 00:00:38.410
When I was really little, I loved glasses
and I really wanted them even though I didn't

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:40.540
actually need them yet. I wanted to wear them as a

00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:43.870
fashion accessory and I would always tag
along with my dad whenever he went to

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:45.200
his optometrist appointments

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.800
and try on as many pairs as I could. So
when I was in second grade and I found

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:50.120
out that I needed glasses

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.270
I was actually really excited! This was basically the opposite experience of

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:58.469
every TV show and movie when I was a kid
that basically told you wearing glasses

00:00:58.469 --> 00:00:59.780
was a terrible,

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:04.049
embarrassing experience. I was thinking they're
adorable, they come in all different

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:05.269
shapes and colors

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:08.850
and they help me to see the board in
class? Sign me up! 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.799
The first day that I wore glasses, I
realized out loud at my bus stop

00:01:12.799 --> 00:01:16.900
that grass is actually made of many many
individual blades.

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:20.680
I guess you learn something new everyday
and apparently I actually needed glasses

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:24.100
a lot sooner than that. By the time I was a
freshman in high school,

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:27.979
I needed to wear glasses full-time. I tried wearing contact lenses for a while and they

00:01:27.979 --> 00:01:28.680
were okay

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:31.619
but by the time I was in college I ended
up switching back to wearing glasses

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:32.390
every day

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:36.170
and even now I basically only wear
contact lenses when I go to the beach or

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.780
something

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.960
Since then, my glasses have become a really
important part of my face

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.439
I'd even consider them to be part of my
identity. Especially now that my hair is

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:47.100
super short, people probably notice my
glasses before they notice any of my

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:47.420
other

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:50.630
features. I would love to be able to
treat them like fashion accessories and

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:52.420
switch them up with whatever I'm wearing

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:55.950
unfortunately, most prescription glasses
are super expensive

00:01:55.950 --> 00:01:58.979
which is one of the reasons why I was so
excited to find out about Warby

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:02.270
Parker. While I was in the store, I decided
to have some fun and try on some

00:02:02.270 --> 00:02:05.219
prescription sunglasses which is a new
thing for me.

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:06.360
I haven't quite decided

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.460
if I'm going to buy a pair of these yet, but I am
extra excited about the possibility of

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:11.910
being able to see when it's

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:15.360
sunny without wearing two pairs of
glasses on my face at the same time.

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.620
What do you think these ones? I decided to
switch the labels from numbers to

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.470
letters for the sunglasses just so
there's no confusion the comments.

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:24.520
Some of you might know this already and a few of you have actually recommended this

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:25.530
to me recently

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.380
But in case you don't live near one of their
stores, Warby Parker actually lets you

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.380
choose five frames from their website

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:33.709
and they'll send them to you in the mail for free so
you can try them on. You don't have to pay for

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:35.320
shipping either way, you can take all the

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:38.740
selfies you want, send them back within
five days, and then you can confidently

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:42.570
make a more informed decision about
whether you should buy your favorite, not

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:43.040
buy any of them

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.380
at all, or even order another round
of 5 free frames to try on.

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:50.420
So in case any of this interests you, Warby 
gave me a URL to share with you guys

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:54.380
Are we on a real first name basis now? And if you visit
warbyparker.com/laurenfairweather

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:57.840
and order the home try on, you'll
get free 3-day shipping on the pair of

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.110
glasses that you like best

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:02.120
and for every pair that they sell, they even
donate a pair of glasses

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.209
to someone who can't afford them which is
pretty wonderful. And if you end up doing

00:03:05.209 --> 00:03:08.730
the home try on yourself, send me a link to
the video or photos of you trying them

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.700
on and I'll help you choose some frames too! 

00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:14.269
New glasses day is like a holiday for me
that doesn't come around very often

00:03:14.269 --> 00:03:17.390
I'm happy that I could bring you guys along
with me to help me decide which ones to

00:03:17.390 --> 00:03:17.810
get!

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:21.030
So if you'd like, remember to leave me a comment
below telling me which pairs you liked

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:21.350
best!

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:24.910
In a couple of days, I'll tally up your votes and order our favorite pair!

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:30.210
Thanks for watching and I'll see you soon.

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:31.770
 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:32.020
