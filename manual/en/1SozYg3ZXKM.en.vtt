Hi, my name is Caroline and this is Amanda,
we're here at Encore Gymnastics and we're

00:00:04.160 --> 00:00:08.090
going to teach you how to do a front flip.
We're going to start by stretching, so go

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:13.940
ahead and stretch your ankles, right and left.
Turn around in a couple circles on each leg.

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:20.680
Very good. You're also going to want to stretch
your hamstrings, so she's going to stand up

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:26.130
and grab the back of her foot and push this
forward. A good way to make this stretch work

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:31.789
is by squeezing your bottom and the other
leg. There's a lot of stress on your legs

00:00:31.789 --> 00:00:37.100
when you land a front tuck because there's
so much momentum in it. And you always want

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:44.620
to stretch your wrists and your neck as well.
Very good. For starting a front tuck you're

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:49.100
going to punch off the ground, so she's going
to take a few steps and then just punch straight

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:56.379
up. Very good. The next step we would do that
same exact thing but she's going to punch

00:00:56.379 --> 00:00:59.520
up and pull her knees into her stomach, so
into a tuck position, same thing, pull your

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:09.111
knees in this time. Very good. So we're going
to have three body positions, the first one

00:01:09.111 --> 00:01:13.840
is going to be going up in the straight body,
the second one is over into the tuck, and

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:19.670
the third one is again with the bent knees,
both bent knees landing, landing. Very good,

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:22.820
right there, so those are the three positions
your body is going to go through in the front

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:26.500
tuck. We're going to go ahead and bring her
up onto the block to show you all the way

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:33.220
through. You're going to start up and big
jump, finish on the other side, very good.

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:46.060
We're going to have her do that all on her
own. She's not quite landing it because she's

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:48.971
leaning a little bit forward, so when you
do your front tuck you're going to want to

00:01:48.971 --> 00:01:59.480
go up a little bit more, go ahead and do one
more for us. Pull it all the way around. And

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:01.079
there it is, that's a front tuck.
