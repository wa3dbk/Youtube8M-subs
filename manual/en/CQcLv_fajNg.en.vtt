00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:11.840
They say an eco-friendly house can't be built
in a 150 days for $150,000, and I say it can.

00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:15.980
I'm Allen Smith: Join me as I push the limits
with time, budget and creativity with the

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:30.200
Garden Home Challenge, exclusively on eHow
Home.

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:45.450
We're gettin' ready to put the gutters on
the house, and we're gonna do the front porch

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:46.450
first.

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:48.010
We took our measurements.

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:53.540
We're gonna use these gutters that they had
extra from building on the rest of the farm.

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:59.490
So we're gonna take them and try to piece
them together and build our own end caps and

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:02.170
downspouts and things like that for it.

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:03.789
We do sustainable solutions.

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:08.590
We try to do all parts of construction that
are Green, from metal roofs --and we're gonna

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:13.290
be doing some rain water harvesting-- painting
and all types of construction.

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:14.640
We do recycled glass countertops.

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.220
We recycle glass.

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:18.340
We do recycle mulch.

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:20.920
All sorts of things with our company.

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:26.280
All the gutters on his house and all the barns
and just about everything that's out here

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:34.229
has this style gutter, because he's wantin'
to go with the 1800s, you know, old style

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:38.409
look, especially with the metal roof and these
style gutters.

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:40.979
And this metal, it's a galvanized aluminum.

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:54.000
It's called Galvalume, and it is made of about
54 percent recycled material.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.890
We're gonna try to get all the clips and gutters
hung today, and then we'll have to make end

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.630
caps for them.

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:05.310
And then we'll come back, and we'llâ€“ once
we figure out where all of our downspouts

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:08.080
are gonna go, we'll come and pop all those
in them.

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:38.159
Get our down spouts where they need to be
and then attach them to the house.
