00:00:06.970 --> 00:00:07.779
Tucked away

00:00:07.779 --> 00:00:11.700
under the A316 at Kempton is the UK's
newest

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:16.269
steam railway. The opening at the Hampton
and Kempton Waterworks railway

00:00:16.269 --> 00:00:19.940
is an important milestone for members
and enthusiasts alike.

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:24.000
"Well I think it's a tremendous. I looked
at this railway

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.449
some many years ago, with the idea of trying to

00:00:28.449 --> 00:00:32.199
put something together and thought it
was a wonderful route but...

00:00:32.199 --> 00:00:37.290
thought it was quite ambitious.
So absolutely delighted that the Society was formed

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:41.489
and they built this first part of the railway

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.840
with a view to building the rest of it. 
I think it's an absolutely wonderful

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:48.360
thing and amazing really amazing that

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.200
with to amateur

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:54.240
volunteer labour got so far, in such a
professional manner."

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:58.900
Press and VIP guests assembled for the
official opening

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:03.580
Thomas Wicksteed

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:06.680
is a locomotive on loan from the Kew
Steam Museum

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.390
As usual

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:15.420
it attracted a lot of attention.

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:18.870
Everything and everyone was smartly
turned out for the opening

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:22.890
by the boss of Thames Water.

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.890
"I call on the executive officer of Thames Water

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.950
to formally open the Hampton and Kempton Waterworks Railway.

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.200
This is the 400th anniversary of Thames Water this year

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.700
in various guises.  It was 400 years
ago they developed the first

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:42.890
scheme to bring water in to London.

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:45.720
We've got the engines behind us and the railway in front of us

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.200
literally the engine is behind me.
So it's with great pleasure

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:56.280
to open up the railway today.  I cut in the middle, do I? Fantastic!

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.920
We're now going to ask the

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:03.440
Deputy Mayor of Hounslow to

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:07.690
formally opened the first railway
station on our railway

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:16.030
Duputy Mayor will you do us the favour of opening

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:18.880
first station on our newly opened railway

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.000
it is called "Hanworth Halt".

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.300
It gives me great pleasure to formally name this station

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:35.370
Hanworth Halt.

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:52.370
After the ceremony it was time for the
fun part

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:06.560
The VIP's and special guests became very
first passengers

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:12.370
"I was here about a year ago now 
and it's totally different now."

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:50.600
The newly restored coach will carry
paying passengers around the Hanworth Loop

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:57.600
most weekends this summer

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:04.799
While reporters discovered every detail
of this new narrow gauge railway

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:07.959
the snappers - amateurs and professionals alike

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:14.959
were in search of that special shot

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:33.500
"Well if you look at look at the railway
behind me in and the Steam

00:04:33.500 --> 00:04:35.500
Engine Trust on the main works

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:39.100
we've worked with the volunteers over
number of years. This has been a real long

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:41.710
term project in the making.  It's taken ten years for the

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:45.400
team to get where they are today. So
in terms of providing the support and

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:48.130
also in terms of making the land available,

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:52.040
also just working with the
volunteers. Not just us as the

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:54.580
company but also our employees on the site as well

00:04:54.580 --> 00:04:58.750
This is a side of Thames Water
that people don't normally see.

00:04:58.750 --> 00:05:03.340
This is a massive year for us, this year,
this is actually our 400 anniversary.

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:06.330
So four hundred years ago to first
scheme was developed to bring

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:06.990
water in to London

00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:10.400
and here we are today to
celebrate the opening

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:13.800
of a rail way to celebrate our heritage. 
Fantastic news!"

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:23.000
So how did it all begin?
When the Great Engine Trust decided they weren't going

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.260
ahead with the railway

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:29.100
I talked to Brian Woodriff  and another local
man, Ron Keyvil, and they encouraged me

00:05:29.100 --> 00:05:30.890
to set up a society

00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:34.600
and we got off the ground back in May 2003

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:39.590
So as you can see it's been quite a few
years before actually got something running

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:55.600
But can a bunch of amateurs build a safe railway?

00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:59.200
It's been very very interesting to see it

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:03.400
in this area because the thing that
surprised me - and I've been to nearly

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:06.200
every heritage railway in the United Kingdom.

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:08.470
Concrete sleepers!

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:10.900
Now you find that on the modern railway

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:13.000
is very rarely on a

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.020
heritage railway

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:17.400
they tend to use the old 
fashioned wooden sleepers

00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:21.160
and they've made them themselves.
That is really something

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:25.500
I've taken great interest - and the important
thing here particularly

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:29.070
in Hampton is the fact that the
waterworks museum

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:31.100
and that wonderful engine there

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:34.620
it will boost this railway

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:37.600
and boost the museum as well

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:39.910
So, congratulations to them today

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:41.550
and I'm sure there will be a

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:44.400
great tourist attraction

00:06:47.400 --> 00:06:50.100
The railway is now open to the public

00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:54.200
and working most weekends.
