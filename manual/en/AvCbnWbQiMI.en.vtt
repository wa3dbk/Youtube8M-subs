Hi I'm David Cantor with the Law Offices of
David Michael Cantor

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:18.369
and today I'm gonna talk about
Misdemeanor DUI Statute of Limitations.

00:00:18.369 --> 00:00:22.520
A lot of times people ask us how long do
they have to charge me with a DUI if I

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:23.470
was pulled over?

00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:27.130
Well, on a misdemeanor they have one full
year to charge a person

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:31.170
and work it's tricky as if they charge
somebody and then we get the case

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.710
dismissed let's say for discovery
violation.

00:00:33.710 --> 00:00:37.129
They don't have blood results yet, they
haven't given us a police report,

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:40.559
and it gets dismissed, it can be refiled.  Now

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:44.409
they have a choice they can either
refile it up until the full one year

00:00:44.409 --> 00:00:45.820
from the date a violation,

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:50.140
or six months after it was dismissed,
whichever is longer.

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:53.670
So for example on January one if you
got a DUI,

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:57.449
they dismissed it at March they have all the
way until January if you got a DUI

00:00:57.449 --> 00:01:00.040
January 1 and they dismissed in
September 1,

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:04.540
they would have up until March of the
following year to charge you with that

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:05.260
DUI.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:07.950
So you should contact a lawyer knows
what they're doing if you're going to

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:08.920
find out whether

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:12.690
you can be properly charged or not or
weather statute of limitations has run.

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:17.110
Now in blood cases this is where it gets
tricky, a lot of jurisdictions will draw

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:17.790
your blood

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:22.610
and then they'll release you without
actually giving you a ticket and they'll say once

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:22.860
we get the

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:27.130
results we're going to charge you.  Where it gets tricky is a lot of people move,

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:30.180
and they'll send a summons to the last
known address and they won't forward that

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.690
summons.  So if you live in an apartment
and then you've moved,

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:35.760
it's possible there's a warrant out for
your arrest

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:38.860
and that can be problematic.  Now
sometimes we've seen where

00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:42.000
they charged after the last day had run

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.780
and they don't bother telling you this,
you have to hire an attorney knows what

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.100
they're doing so they can spot that get
the case thrown out

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.360
for a statute violation.  DMV

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.300
issues, here's another problem, the DMV
hearing is completely separate from the

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:58.070
criminal hearing. So a lot of times

00:01:58.070 --> 00:02:01.460
the draw your blood they'd send you on
your way and then you get something in

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.940
the mail call the corrective action
notice it says

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:07.880
we're going to suspend you for 90 days.
And you're like "wait a second I wasn't even

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:09.039
charged with a DUI"

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:12.409
that's because your DMV is completely
separate from the criminal court case.

00:02:12.409 --> 00:02:16.230
Bottom line is if you're stopped for a DUI
wheather they give you paper work

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:19.849
