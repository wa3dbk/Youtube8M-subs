00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:10.780
You made a loaf of homemade bread, but the crust ended up being hard as a rock.

00:00:11.589 --> 00:00:13.219
I think I broke a tooth.

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:16.019
Has this ever happened to you?

00:00:16.019 --> 00:00:22.119
Do you wish that your loaf had nice, soft crust like the bread you buy at the store?

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:27.970
The bad news is that the loaf you already baked is toast.

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:31.400
Toast is hard an crunchy...nevermind.

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:34.530
But the good news is there is hope for
your next loaf.

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.380
But before we get to that, let's ask why the
loaf gets hard in the first place.

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:42.220
Lot's of the loaf's moisture escapes as steam while it's cooling.

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:46.420
Maybe you're thinking, "If you could prevent the steam from escaping,"

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:49.930
"..the crust won't dry out."  And you'd be right.

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:54.970
But there's a right way and a wrong way to do it.  Some wrong ways would be to put it in a box,

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:57.020
or some sort of bag.

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:01.630
For the box, it's because there's still air space for the steam to escape out of the loaf,

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:06.440
and you still loose moisture.  For bags, it's
because bags tend to expand when you get

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:09.650
steam inside them causing the same
problem.

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:12.210
You need something that wraps the loaf up tightly.

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:16.759
Now you may be thinking, "What about aluminum foil?"
You'd be on the right track, except that

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:21.509
steam can corrode aluminum, which can cause holes to form, and steam to escape, and may leave  

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:23.890
some metal residue on your loaf.

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:27.620
And yes, I am speaking from experience.
 That leaves us with:

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:29.710
Plastic wrap.

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:34.560
Now maybe you're savvy, and maybe you've heard that if you expose plastic wrap to high temperatures,

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:39.480
(such as you would have with steam), then toxic chemicals can be leeched out of the plastic,

00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:42.240
and contaminate your food.  That used to be true,

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.950
but not so much anymore; most plastic wraps these days are safe.  And if you want

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:51.780
to be sure, check the box.  If it says it's microwave safe, or provides microwave

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:57.710
instructions, or if the box says
"low-density polyethylene", then it's safe.

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:01.470
As far as we know.

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:03.240
As soon as it's done baking, 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.190
quickly remove it from the pan.

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:10.479
Cut off a large piece of plastic wrap
and tightly wrap up the loaf.

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:17.479
Make sure that there are no holes.

00:02:21.609 --> 00:02:23.209
Don't take the plastic off

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:25.930
Until it's completely cool.

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:30.930
If there are any damp spots on the crust after you've unwrapped it, let it dry in the air

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:32.509
for a couple of minutes,

00:02:32.509 --> 00:02:37.369
before putting it in a bag for
long-term storage.

00:02:37.369 --> 00:02:40.959
Congratulations; you've made a loaf with a nice, soft crust!
