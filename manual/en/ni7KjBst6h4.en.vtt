00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.700
Welcome to another episode of Mighty Mods. 
We've had a busy weekend.

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:10.980
We did have a busy weekend. 
We got invited out to Oran Park Raceway,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.280
with the Project-D boys, watching them get sideways out there on the skid pan.

00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:18.700
So this special episode, we're not actually going to show you how to do anything.

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:22.820
We're just going to sit back and watch some hot, drift, action, we hope you enjoy.

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:24.840
And, ahh, we'll see you next episode.

00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:59.020
Luckily, there was only one off for the day.

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:01.560
And even more luckily, no damage was done.

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.540
Might need a wash though.

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:08.260
A bit environmental.

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.280
There were, however, some other casualties of the day.

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:20.320
Particularly, of the rubber type.

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.460
Alright, so here with Eric. He's the scrutineer here today.

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:32.820
There are very limited rules on these.  I mean they only need a lap safety belt, basically a road-going car.

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:36.500
But a lot of cars, they put harnesses in, roll cages for their own safety.

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:37.000
Yeah.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.140
I personally make sure that the seat is bolted in. 
You laugh about that...

00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:46.780
*Car revving, tire screeching*

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:04.980
This is Marty. He helps out with Project-Drift, 
and also tests the cars.

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:09.120
He took our Marty 
for a few passenger runs around the track.

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.880
*Engine revving, tires screeching*

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.580
Yeah!

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:29.820
Good work!

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:31.320
Haha.  I try.

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:37.400
I compare drifting in Japan is a bit
like a kid going down to the skatepark.

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.520
They got a bunch of young blokes...
and the cars are cheap.

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:44.160
And they go down and they have a roll-around.  
A bit of fun you know?

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:50.060
Whereas here, I think it started off a lot more serious because you had to have money to get into it.

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:53.660
Whereas now, I think it's coming back to the grassroots.

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.060
*Car revving, tires screeching*

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:02.440
I was actually trying to get my car ready to bring down this weekend,

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:04.840
but didn't sort of end up happening.

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:05.460
What have you got?

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:06.360
Uh, an S13.

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.740
It looks like it's kind of the best one 
to have when you come out here?

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:16.260
Yeah. Generally, it's your best base model you can...

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:20.200
Cheap parts can go in them. Readily available.

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:21.300
And easy to drive.

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:23.400
Well, relatively easy to drive.

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:25.000
Some of us find them easy to drive.

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:29.780
There was only one driver 
flying the flag for the Aussie cars.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.900
It seems the VO Commodore can keep up
with the best of the Japanese drift machines.

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:40.160
*Tires screeching*

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:52.760
Both the Toyotas present on the day 
are over 20 years old and still going strong.

00:04:56.760 --> 00:04:59.680
We were amazed at just how much abuse 
these cars could take.

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:06.300
JJ let us have a close look 
at his purpose-built drift machine.

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:10.620
It's an S13 180SX, 
with S15 front end and motor,

00:05:10.620 --> 00:05:15.160
with plenty of handling mods, 
to help him get as sideways as possible.

00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:18.140
What kind of turbo?

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:19.320
A 3037.

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:21.060
Oh cool. Garrett.

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:24.120
Custom-made cooling ducts 
for the intercooler and oil system,

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:26.180
help keep the car running reliably.

00:05:27.540 --> 00:05:30.580
*Car revving, tires screeching*

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:39.980
Most of these drivers are happy to work
under the hood of their own drift machines,

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:43.700
giving Marty a good chance
to check out the mods.

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:47.580
Mechanical skills definitely come 
in handy in this kind of sport,

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:52.640
so make sure you keep checking out:
mightycarmods.com

00:05:56.160 --> 00:06:00.200
The Project-Drift crew run a regular 
school where you can learn how to drift.

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:02.960
