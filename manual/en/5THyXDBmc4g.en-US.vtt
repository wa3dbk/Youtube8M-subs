Hello dear 1000 PS fans, ma name is Chris and I'm here at the infamous racetrack in Imola,

00:00:53.013 --> 00:00:58.273
close to Bologna which unfortunately brings back not only good memories from the past.

00:00:58.273 --> 00:01:06.388
But today is definitely a good day, it's the World Premiere of the Ducati 899 Panigale.

00:01:06.388 --> 00:01:12.128
Unfortunately it's been raining and  we started with wet tires first.

00:01:12.101 --> 00:01:19.385
Good thing is, the bike offers 3 riding modes: wet, sport and race. (wet mode = 100 HP)

00:01:19.605 --> 00:01:28.061
Additionally, you can set the ABS in 3 and the traction control in 8 levels.

00:01:28.777 --> 00:01:35.222
As it has stopped raining, it seems we'll start in dry conditions in the afternoon.

00:01:35.222 --> 00:01:43.785
And we will finally be able to use all 148 horses out of the 898 ci V2.

00:02:01.979 --> 00:02:09.764
 

00:02:10.822 --> 00:02:15.358
It's not too much power of course, the small Panigale is really easy to ride and very predictable.

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:19.262
Still, riders can use the electronic control systems as a back-up in critical conditions.

00:02:20.228 --> 00:02:26.234
In all three modes, race, sport and wet, the ABS can be set in 3 levels,

00:02:26.528 --> 00:02:34.453
the traction control in 8 levels and the electronic engine brake control also in 3 levels.

00:02:36.607 --> 00:02:44.957
ABS and DTC can be turned off. In wet-mode the engine performance will be limited to 100 hp.

00:02:45.233 --> 00:02:51.052
The Panigale is euipped with the Pirelli Diablo Rosso Corsa.

00:02:51.052 --> 00:03:00.349
Front: 120/70, Back: 180/60. The Panigale 1199 certainly belongs to the most beautiful

00:03:00.349 --> 00:03:06.856
motorcycles of all time, so the smaller sister isn't ugly at all. Design-wise there were only some small changes, the biggest

00:03:06.856 --> 00:03:13.409
difference of course is the 2-armed swing arm of the 899, but that does not blur the picture really.

00:03:13.803 --> 00:03:21.393
In 2014 the Panigale will be offered in white and in red. Maybe in 2015 a black version will

00:03:21.393 --> 00:03:26.497
follow and since yellow is having a rennaissance, that's also an option.

00:03:46.555 --> 00:03:53.855
For my size of 1,80m in height, the Duc is perfectly dimensioned and naturally to operate.

00:03:54.251 --> 00:03:59.866
You immediately understand the bike and it's like you've always driven it.

00:04:00.081 --> 00:04:06.615
I could move on the bike just like I wanted to, and I move a lot. Nothing got in my way.

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:13.043
It's implicitness and easy handling makes the 899 a Superbike,

00:04:13.323 --> 00:04:21.330
that will dominate the racetrack just like the daily grind. A real all-rounder dressed as a Supermodel.
