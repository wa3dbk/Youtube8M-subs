Hello there, I'm Ian Noctor and
welcome to AdoramaTV.

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:14.020
Today I'm excited to show you
Bose new CineMate 120

00:00:14.020 --> 00:00:17.700
Home Theater System. Ok, let's look
at its different components.

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:22.439
Firstly, the soundbar nifty eh? The sound
bar at less than a ft and a half,

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:24.990
delivers powerful detailed sound

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:30.420
at a level of performance that belies its size.
It's compact, so it also means it's a great

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.640
choice for an average sized living room,

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:38.920
bedroom, den, or office. Inside this tiny
speaker enclosure are five precisely positioned,

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:42.870
powerful drivers that are aided by true
space technology.

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.879
Couple that with the resonant bass
provided by the Acoustimass module,

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:50.010
and you will hear a compelling level of sound and
spaciousness,

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:53.590
all without a massive unsightly wires in
your room.

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:57.460
Now, let's move on to the Acoustimass
module. This wireless module

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:01.390
add's really dramatic low notes to all
your entertainment.

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:06.270
There is a single range of 30 ft, so you
can place it pretty much anywhere in the room,

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.040
at the back if your TV, anywhere if you
want to keep it out of sight.

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:14.939
Looking at sound design this is where
the speaker really stands out.

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.890
It features the cutting edge adapt IQ audio system.

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:22.610
So what's that? Well, your environment can
really affect

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:26.049
your sound. So whether you have wooden
floors, plush rugs,

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:29.880
or your room is just an unconventional
shape, adapt IQ

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.930
adjusts the speakers performance to the
acoustics

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:37.560
of your room so you don't have to change
a thing. Once you have positioned your speaker where

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.380
you want it, just run the Adapt IQ system, sit back,

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:45.390
and enjoy consistent performance
throughout the room. Another great

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.960
feature you can enjoy it with the CineMate 120 Home Theater System,

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.420
is the ability to stream music over your
WiFi network.

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.780
With an optional wifi adapter you can
discover and enjoy music

00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:01.759
easier than ever before. You can
wirelessly stream 20,000 internet radio

00:02:01.759 --> 00:02:03.210
stations from around the world,

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:06.360
songs, and playlists from a personal
music library

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.379
and popular music services like Deezer
and Spotify,

00:02:09.379 --> 00:02:12.819
it's all available by at your home wifi network,

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:16.380
and what's really great is the
system also works with other Bose

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:20.500
Sound Touch systems, to create a
multi-room listing experience.

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:25.580
In party mode, these systems work together
as one to play music everywhere,

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:29.250
stream different music in different
rooms, play the same music in

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.220
every room, or create customized zones.
Really there is a solution here

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:38.560
for all your audio needs. Finally, the
system includes an infrared remote control,

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:44.050
and a small control console with the
four HDMI input, and if you look here

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:48.750
at the console side panel, there is a 3.5
mm collection for headphones.

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:52.850
