00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.800
I recently had a chance to discuss wealth
confiscation with John Rubino of DollarCollapse.com.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.600
He reminds us of what governments do when
under pressure; time and time again we have

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:22.679
seen wealth confiscation. Inflation is an
easy way to steal from your population, you

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:30.340
have taxes, laws altered to take your money,
and then as things get worse, the wealth confiscation

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:36.070
just gets more extreme.
Citing a few examples from the Roman Empire,

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:40.489
John also covers a few things that have happened
in U.S. history.

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:46.530
* 1942, after entering World War II, FDR moved
all Japanese citizens living in the U.S. to

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:52.820
concentration camps and sold off their property.
The detainees were released in 1945, given

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:59.820
$25 and a train ticket home - without being
reimbursed for their losses.

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:04.080
* During the U.S. Civil War, Lincoln with
the help of Congress passed laws confiscating

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:11.080
property used for "insurrectionary purposes"
and of citizens generally engaged in rebellion.

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:18.360
* 1933, FDR banned the private ownership of
gold, gave those who surrendered it $20.67

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:25.229
per ounce and then devalued the dollar to
$35 an ounce, effectively stealing 70% of

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.780
the wealth of those who surrendered their
gold.

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:33.289
Obviously you want to diversify your assets
here in the U.S. and offshore in multiple

00:01:33.289 --> 00:01:38.920
countries.
My favorite store of value

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.639
The biggest advantage to holding precious
metals (Gold, Silver, Platinum, &amp; Palladium)

00:01:42.639 --> 00:01:48.139
is that no one really knows you have them.
They are liquid assets outside of the system,

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:53.049
easily portable, and are rare metals that
have to be mined giving them a real and lasting

00:01:53.049 --> 00:01:57.350
value.
I recommend 5-10% of your net worth in physical

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:03.709
precious metals, think of gold specifically
like an insurance policy. Many people ask

00:02:03.709 --> 00:02:08.780
me all the time about what the gold price
is going to do next... To me, this is like

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:13.880
expecting a return on investment from my auto
insurance, healthcare, or ADT alarm system

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:19.600
that protects my house. Gold is a protector
of wealth, it is your financial insurance,

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:24.580
don't let the day to day price consume you,
because you don't want gold to pay out!

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:30.660
Believe me, you do not want gold $10,000.
That puts oil in the hundreds of dollars,

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:35.950
gas over $15 a gallon, and who knows what
we would be paying for food.

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:41.230
However, if we were to see a major systemic
shock to the system, like a disorderly end

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:46.980
to the U.S. dollar, owning gold will be one
of the most prudent decisions you ever make

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:53.980
in your life.
On a side note, as the middle class continues

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:07.320
to shrink, I would expect more civil litigation
to rise as people want to put the blame for

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:14.320
their own obstacles on someone else, so be
careful, and actively take steps to protect

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:52.650
your wealth.
