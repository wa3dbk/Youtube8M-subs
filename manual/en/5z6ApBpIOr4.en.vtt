00:00:01.399 --> 00:00:05.840
why is weight loss so hard for most
people

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:09.499
why don't we gain the weight back

00:00:09.499 --> 00:00:10.569
what gives

00:00:10.569 --> 00:00:14.719
for most people weight loss is one of
those projects they'd love to start

00:00:14.719 --> 00:00:17.599
love to achieve and love to maintain

00:00:17.599 --> 00:00:20.099
still despite all the love

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:24.109
and order would have scored patsy shake
hands in the world

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:28.279
most people will go on diets eventually
gain or the weight back

00:00:28.279 --> 00:00:29.570
what gets

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:30.570
afterglow

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:35.080
doesn't it make sense that if people are
motivated to get a leaner and lighter

they should be able to achieve their
goals if you are reading this you

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:44.750
probably already know that losing weight
is one thing keep

00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:51.000
losing weight is one thing and keeping
it off is another thing altogether

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.360
force of habit

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:56.780
when it comes to weightless and
attitudes toward weightless most people

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:59.440
are like rolling rock's going downhill

00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.430
if you have developed certain eating
habits your eating habits will have a

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:05.080
momentum of its own

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:08.970
it will continue like tinh yeu until you
dramatically stop it

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.200
when you do changing eating habits

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:12.929
your physical habits change

00:01:12.929 --> 00:01:14.550
but your mental habits

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:15.840
haven't changed

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.470
justice would have tried to seek its
level

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:20.340

activities

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.400
and you may end up

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:27.240
with the same eating patterns as before

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.450
far from a victory over fat

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:32.720
without establishing the right new
mental habits

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.330
you'll go back to your old patterns

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:36.109
the fact

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:40.760
and the weight are soon to follow

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:42.549
studies show

00:01:42.549 --> 00:01:47.990
study after study confirmed that diets
tend to produce short-term results

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:50.090
people gained all the way back

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:52.480
sam even gained more weight back

00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:55.640
this is why weight loss is so hard for
most people

00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:58.460
sustainable weight loss is the problem

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:03.190
weight loss is easy people can manage to
lose a few parents in a few weeks

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:06.150
keeping that weight loss is the big

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:09.080
here s some key reasons why many people

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:14.029
who go on diets can keep the weight off

00:02:14.029 --> 00:02:15.209
interruption

00:02:15.209 --> 00:02:16.909
is not

00:02:16.909 --> 00:02:21.889
most people will go on diets usually use
an interruption models too

00:02:21.889 --> 00:02:23.159
to losing weight

00:02:23.159 --> 00:02:25.880
interruption is all about doing
something

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.059
and introducing something that breaks
the pattern

00:02:29.059 --> 00:02:32.279
if you are heeding two thousand calories
a day

00:02:32.279 --> 00:02:35.879
you can interrupt this calorie intake
level but you could dramatically

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:41.029
shifting to lower calorie foods or
shifting to a high

00:02:41.029 --> 00:02:43.779
high-protein low-fat foods

00:02:43.779 --> 00:02:45.409
your body get shocked

00:02:45.409 --> 00:02:48.569
your all eating habits get interrupted

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:49.999
break the pattern

00:02:49.999 --> 00:02:53.409
to create and no one

00:02:53.409 --> 00:02:54.769
less calories

00:02:54.769 --> 00:02:59.419
due to the lower calorie intake your
body starts burning up your fat stores

00:02:59.419 --> 00:03:03.899
and you get leaner as a result
unfortunately when should get vendor

00:03:03.899 --> 00:03:06.789
your mind is still used to be your old
habit

00:03:06.789 --> 00:03:13.699
it continues to fight the interruption
by looking for continuity

00:03:13.699 --> 00:03:14.959
lifestyles

00:03:14.959 --> 00:03:19.159
weightloss plan was not integrated into
a new lifestyle

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:23.609
the most common reason many people don't
achieve sustainable weightless is

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:26.339
because they did not change their
lifestyles

00:03:26.339 --> 00:03:28.349
they change their eighteen patterns

00:03:28.349 --> 00:03:29.629
temporarily

00:03:29.629 --> 00:03:34.250
once they get to a certain weight level
they go back to their whole life style

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:36.479
and they packed the pounds backline

00:03:36.479 --> 00:03:38.439

00:03:38.439 --> 00:03:39.570
make it permanent

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:41.500
by changing your heating habits

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:43.590
