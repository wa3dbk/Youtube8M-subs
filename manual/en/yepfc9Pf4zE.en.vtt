00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:07.360
Hello everyone! I'm Stas Kargin, also known as "Veider."

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:09.440
I'm a game designer for World of Tanks,

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:12.840
and today I'll be telling you about the 9.2 update.

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.360
What can players expect in this update?

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:34.400
The 9.2 update is not the most extensive update -

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:35.640
there'll be small fixes,

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.040
and improvements to maps and vehicle balance.

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.880
Also, several HD vehicle models will be introduced.

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.120
What are the results of the testing of Strongholds?

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:47.240
The common test of the Strongholds brought us solid feedback.

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.120
Based on these results, we changed the format of the battles

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:52.800
in Skirmishes for tiers six, eight, and ten.

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.560
The battles will be 7 vs. 7, 10 vs. 10, and 15 vs. 15, respectively.

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:59.440
Everything else is left as it is.

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:01.960
What vehicles were rebalanced?

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:05.080
We revised quite a few vehicles.

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.840
In particular, we rebalanced the Waffenträger auf  E 100.

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:10.600
We focused on its drum,

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.040
because everyone had been fed up with it.

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:14.560
It's a tricky problem

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:17.920
but we want to rework this vehicle to make it truly balanced.

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:21.840
With 9.2, one shell will be removed from its drum.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:29.240
As for the FV215b (183), the main problem was its premium shells.

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:31.920
These shells had excellent armour penetration,

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.600
and players used them more often that we had expected.

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:36.240
So, we rebalanced this type of shell

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.000
by decreasing its armour penetration value.

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:42.800
In tier nine, we rebalanced the M46 Patton

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.920
and the VK. 45.02 (P) Ausf. B.

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:48.360
These vehicles have been in the game for a long time

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:50.280
and they have never been rebalanced.

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.600
They had lost their competitiveness over time,

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:54.680
so we gave them some attention.

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.000
The M46 Patton received better stabilisation,

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:00.600
a bit more accuracy and quicker aim time.

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:02.400
So, we focused mainly on its gun.

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:06.920
The VK 45.02 (P) Ausf. B was a different case.

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:09.400
It was always a heavily armoured vehicle.

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:11.960
With time, its armour lost its effectiveness,

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.640
so we decided to improve its survivability.

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.040
We revised its front hull armour and turret armour.

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.320
Now vehicle should be perform more effectively in its role.

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:27.680
We also paid attention to the Waffenträger auf Pz. IV.

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.320
This vehicle has become too popular.

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:33.520
We were concerned it was slightly overpowered,

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:37.200
so we decided to rework this vehicle in advance.

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.240
Most changes were made to its gun.

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.160
Currently, this vehicle has the highest damage per minute,

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:45.360
so we worked on its gun reload time.

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:48.880
In tier eight, changes were made to the T-44

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.240
and the Rheinmetall-Borsig Waffenträger German tank destroyer.

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.360
We changed their gun reload time as well.

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:59.720
Basically, the T-44 fits its intended role, a mobile medium tank.

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.040
The only thing that needed to be improved was its gun reload time,

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:04.600
so we reduced it.

00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.400
The Rhm.-Borsig Waffenträger had the same problem.

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:12.120
In general, this vehicle is quite hard to master: its armour is weak,

00:03:12.240 --> 00:03:14.000
and it can be spotted easily.

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:17.280
But, its high rate of fire allowed it to play quite differently from

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:18.760
what we wanted it to be.

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:21.400
So, we increased its reload time.

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.440
We also took a look into less popular branches,

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:28.640
such as the branch leading to the Object 263 Soviet tank destroyer

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:31.840
and the branch leading to the Leopard 1 (Prototyp A)  German medium tank.

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:34.240
Once again, we changed the gun reload times

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:35.720
of some vehicles in those branches,

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:38.000
so that they can deliver fire more effectively.

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:41.440
A number of HD vehicle models will appear in the 9.2 update.

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.440
They are the Soviet IS heavy tank,

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.800
the SU-100 Soviet tank destroyer,

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:48.120
the Sturmgeschütz III Ausf. G German tank destroyer,

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:50.160
and the Churchill I British heavy tank.

00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.680
Are there any reworked maps in this update?

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:56.240
Yes, several maps were reworked in the 9.2 update.

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:58.560
Mostly, changes were made to improve gameplay

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.200
and balance on these maps.

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:02.040
The reworked maps are El Halluf,

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.400
Sand River, Cliff, and Hidden Village.

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:07.360
We also reworked the battle tiers for the Komarin map.

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:10.000
Higher-tier vehicles won't see this map anymore.

00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:12.600
We also added the so-called "Prokhorovka-2."

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:15.160
It's a renovated Prokhorovka with new design

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:18.960
and new effects: smoke, cannons, explosions and other things.

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:20.680
What are the other changes?

00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:24.440
In the 9.2 update, we implemented a large number of fixes

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:26.320
that should improve optimisation

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.400
and make the game client work faster.

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:30.240
One of the most important changes

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:33.520
is how HD vehicles are displayed in a 3D scene.

00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:35.800
We reconsidered our views in this respect.

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:37.800
We understand that it's important for players

00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:39.960
to see their vehicles in HD quality

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.120
but when players aim, they don't really care

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:43.760
whether it's an HD vehicle

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:46.200
or a standard vehicle they see in their gunsights.

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:47.960
Players care more about whether or not

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:50.960
they can effectively damage enemy vehicles (can they aim

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:54.200
and shoot effectively) and not so much about how the vehicles look.

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:57.000
Additionally, when there are lots of HD vehicles on the map,

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:58.400
the system is burdened.

00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:02.040
So we've switched off displaying HD vehicles in 3D scene.

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:05.000
Only the player's own vehicle is displayed in HD.

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:08.600
We also added the option of turning off foliage transparency.

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:11.200
This change is aimed at improving performance

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:14.120
when playing on computers with low performance capacity.

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:16.760
Foliage, especially transparent foliage,

00:05:16.880 --> 00:05:20.440
can lead to massive FPS loss on some configurations,

00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:22.320
and we worked on this issue as well.

00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:24.680
You will learn more details about all the changes

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:27.800
in the upcoming review of the 9.2 update.

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:40.760
Now, we are working on a large bunch of tanks for the 9.3 update.

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:44.280
They are new American, Soviet, and German light tanks.
