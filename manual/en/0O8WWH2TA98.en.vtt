00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:20.340
Once upon a time, there was a Royal Elephant

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.760
that used to reside in the premises of the King's palace.

00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:27.320
The Elephant was very dear to the King.

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:31.300
So he was cared well fed and well treated.

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.300
There was a Dog who used to live in the neighborhood of the Elephant shed.

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:45.140
He was very weak and skinny.

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:48.200
He was always, fascinated

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:51.320
by the smell of the rich sweet rice ,

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:53.700
being fed to the Royal Elephant.

00:00:56.960 --> 00:01:00.880
One day, the Dog could not risk the aroma of the rice

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.420
and somehow he sneaked into the Elephant's shed.

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:14.000
He ate the sweet rice that fell from the Elephant's mouth.

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:16.540
He liked the rice so much.

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:23.800
He started coming daily to eat the rice.

00:01:24.220 --> 00:01:28.280
For days, the huge Elephant didn't notice the small Dog

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:31.500
as he was busy in enjoying the delicious food.

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:40.340
Gradually, the Dog became bigger and stronger

00:01:40.340 --> 00:01:42.300
by eating such rich food.

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.200
He came under the notice of the Elephant.

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:56.240
The Elephant used to enjoy the company of the Dog

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.820
and started sharing his food with him.

00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:02.840
Both of them also started sharing time with each other

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:05.740
and soon they made good friends.

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:09.960
They ate together, slept together, and played together.

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.740
It didn't take long when neither of them was happy without the other.

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.120
They became great friends

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:20.020
and didn't want to get separated from each other.

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.340
Then, one day, a man saw the Dog

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.440
and asked the Elephant keeper

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:29.600
I Want to buy this Dog.

00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:31.900
What price do you seek for the Dog?

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.200
The Elephant keeper didn't own the Dog.

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:40.660
Still, he sold the Dog and extracted some of money out of this deal.

00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:47.380
The man took the Dog to his home village,

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:49.620
which was quite far away.

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.980
The Kings Elephant became very sad after this incident.

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:01.100
He missed his friend a lot and started neglecting everything.

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:04.720
He didn't want to do anything without his dear friend.

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.940
So stopped eating, drinking, and even bathing!

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:13.980
Ultimately, the Elephant keeper reported this to the King.

00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:16.940
However, he didn't tell anything about the Dog.

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:22.680
The King had a wise minister, who was known for his understanding of animals.

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:25.520
At once, the King asked the minister.

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:31.280
Go to the Elephant's shed, and find out the reason for the Elephant's condition!

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.420
The intelligent minister went to the Elephant's shed,

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:43.000
and found the Elephant very sad.

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:48.880
He looked the Elephant all over and asked the Elephant keeper

00:03:50.980 --> 00:03:53.460
There is nothing wrong with this Elephant's body.

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:55.960
Then why does he look so sad?

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:58.940
I Think this Elephant is grief-stricken.

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:01.980
Possibly due to the loss of a dear friend.

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:06.140
Do you know if this Elephant shared a close friendship with anyone?

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:11.060
There was a Dog who used to eat , sleep, and play with the Elephant.

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:14.500
He has been taken by a stranger three days ago.

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:15.940
Where is the Dog?

00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:17.540
I don't know.

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:19.280
Your majesty,

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:21.140
as per my opinion,

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:23.480
the Royal Elephant is not sick.

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:27.900
But he is lonesome without his dear friend the Dog.

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:29.760
Do you know where the Dog is?

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:34.140
Elephant Keeper has informed that a stranger took him away,

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:36.560
and he didn't know about his whereabouts.

00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:40.840
How can we bring back my Elephant's friend and make him happy again?

00:04:41.420 --> 00:04:43.940
Your Majesty, make a declaration,

00:04:44.140 --> 00:04:48.060
that whoever has the Dog that used to live with Royal Elephant's shed

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:50.060
will be penalized

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:57.560
attention everybody.

00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:59.320
attention everybody.

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:03.880
Whoever has the Dog, that used to live at the Royal Elephant's shed,

00:05:04.300 --> 00:05:05.580
will be penalized.

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:07.700
This is the King's order.

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:11.320
the King did the same and the man who took the Dog,

00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:14.580
Instantly turned him loose when he heard the proclamation.

00:05:15.340 --> 00:05:16.800
When the Dog was free,

00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:21.420
he ran back as fast as he could to reach the Elephant's shed.

00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:29.420
The Elephant was so delighted to see the Dog,

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:33.060
that he picked his friend with his trunk and made him sit on his head.

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:35.460
The Dog waved his tail,

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:36.980
while the Elephant's eyes

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:38.520
Sparkled with happiness.

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:42.380
The King was contented to see the happy Elephant once again.

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:46.020
He also rewarded the minister for his wise judgement.

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:50.780
Both the Elephant and the Dog lived happily ever after.

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:58.260
Children, what do you understand from this story?

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:01.260
Did you see what a wonderful relationship

00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:03.680
that the Elephant and the Dog shared with each other?

00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:05.280
That is friendship.

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:07.840
Friendship is one of the most beautiful things

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:10.000
that can ever happen in one's life.

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:14.620
The moral of the story is true friends can never be separated.

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:18.280
Even if you fight with your closest of friends,

00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:20.440
I think you'll make up later sure.

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:24.520
Because I know that you can never be separated from your true friend.
