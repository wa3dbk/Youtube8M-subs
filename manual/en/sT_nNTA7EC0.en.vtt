00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.960
COMPUTERIZED VOICE: Hockey.

00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:15.730
NARRATOR: When everything floats,

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:18.100
it's hard to begin a hockey game with a faceoff,

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:20.900
but Valery and Sergei give it a try.

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:25.860
On Earth, this sport relies on gravity,

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:28.500
on the energy transferred to a puck when hit by a stick,

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:29.730
on the puck's speed,

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:32.400
and on what happens when the puck hits a wall.

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.730
In space, it's easy to swing the stick,

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:37.660
but harder to keep the stick from touching the puck

00:00:37.660 --> 00:00:40.360
when the puck can bounce off in any direction.

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:42.030
Passing back and forth works well

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:44.130
until the puck is pushed against the floor.

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:47.000
Then it bounces up and becomes hard to control.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.200
This puck is a very soft plastic

00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.830
to protect the space hockey player.

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:54.060
Passing back and forth can be mastered,

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:56.360
but there's no friction or downward force

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:59.000
to hold the puck to the floor.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:02.300
What if Valery and Sergei decide to compete for the puck?

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:04.760
Then it's challenging to control the puck

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:07.130
and to take it away from your opponent.

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:09.600
It's easier to check with the puck

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.630
on the locker than in the air,

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.460
and it's also easier to pass when there's a surface

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:16.500
to help control the puck's motion.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.830
Sergei also discovered that the vent helps control the puck.

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:23.100
Both the vent texture

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.530
and the air pulling down through the vent

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.130
both stabilize and slow down the puck's motion.

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.800
WOMAN: Works well on a fan. That's cheating.

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:35.260
NARRATOR: To play hockey, we need a goal,

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:38.160
so we'll use the hatch, with Valery as the goalie.

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:39.530
[ Cheers and applause ]

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:42.130
WOMAN: I like your -- your mask, Valery.

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:43.860
That was cool.

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:46.200
NARRATOR: It's Sergei's task to score

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.460
by knocking the puck past Valery and through the hatch.

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:52.060
Notice that it's hard to keep the puck still

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:54.400
long enough to take a shot at the goal.

00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:58.160
Is it easier to block a shot on Earth or in space?

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.260
Look at Valery's stance,

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:02.960
with his feet in straps for stability.

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.700
It's hard to stay in place to protect the goal,

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:09.800
and it's fun to imagine new rules for a space hockey game.
