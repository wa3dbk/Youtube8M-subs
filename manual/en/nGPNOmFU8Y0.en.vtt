00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:02.810
STEVE GROVE: Hello everyone,
and welcome to the first ever

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:04.940
presidential Google+ hangout.

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:07.300
Over a quarter of a million
people visited the White House

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:09.520
YouTube channel and submitted
their questions for you.

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:11.950
We're joined by five of those
people right here.

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:13.570
We're ready to put you
in the hot seat.

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:14.620
JENNIFER WEDEL: Hi, Mr. President.

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:15.275
[INAUDIBLE].

00:00:15.275 --> 00:00:15.610
BARACK OBAMA: Hey, Jennifer.

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:17.030
JENNIFER: I'm from Fort
Worth, Texas.

00:00:17.030 --> 00:00:21.490
Why does the government continue
to issue H-1B visas

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:24.640
when there are tons of
Americans, just like my

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:26.510
husband, with no job?

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:29.540
BARACK OBAMA: What industry
tells me is that they don't

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:33.270
have enough highly skilled
engineers.

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.360
JENNIFER WEDEL: I understand
that, but--

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:37.270
BARACK OBAMA: Can I ask you
what kind of engineer your

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:38.410
husband is?

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:40.980
JENNIFER WEDEL: He's a semiconductor
engineer.

00:00:40.980 --> 00:00:43.190
BARACK OBAMA: That kind of
engineer should be able to

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:45.900
find something right away.

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:48.550
We should get his resume and
I'll forward it to companies

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:51.220
who say they cannot
find somebody in

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:52.490
that particular field.

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:53.320
MALE STUDENT: Hi,
Mr. President.

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:55.550
I'm a senior from John F.
Kennedy High School in

00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:56.680
Fremont, California.

00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:58.810
What is your plan to help
students pay off all their

00:00:58.810 --> 00:00:59.670
student loans?

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:00.840
BARACK OBAMA: What we're
going to start doing is

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:03.750
incentivizing schools that have
come up with creative

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.870
ways to keep costs down.

00:01:05.870 --> 00:01:07.610
There may be better ways
to use technology.

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:10.740
I mean, you look at what we're
doing today, potentially a lot

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.750
of folks can take classes
without ever actually being in

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:14.740
a classroom.

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:16.610
Great to talk to you,
and thanks for

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:19.450
wearing a tie today.

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:20.510
PARAS PATEL: I'm from
Michigan and my

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:21.500
dad works for GM.

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:23.640
How do we make sure that the
auto industry is competitive

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:25.840
long term, and not just for
the next couple of years?

00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:28.060
BARACK OBAMA: The auto industry
is starting to look

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.800
at the trends of the future, and
one of the biggest trends

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:33.720
is making sure that we're
creating fuel-efficient cars.

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.180
CHRISTINE WOLF: Mr. President,
if it's all right with you,

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:37.540
may I just introduce you to my
children who are sitting--

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:37.900
BARACK OBAMA: Yeah,
let me see them!

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:39.200
CHRISTINE WOLF: --just
off camera.

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:40.100
Come on over.

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:41.170
BARACK OBAMA: Hey guys!

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:43.440
CHRISTINE WOLF: Let
Nate in too.

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:43.955
BARACK OBAMA: Hey!

00:01:43.955 --> 00:01:45.070
How's it going?

00:01:45.070 --> 00:01:46.950
CHRISTINE WOLF: What
do you say?

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:48.590
BARACK OBAMA: Be sure to study
hard in school and do

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:49.480
your mom tells you.

00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:50.930
MALE STUDENT: We'd just like to
thank you for giving up a

00:01:50.930 --> 00:01:53.490
little bit of your time to let
us all be a part of this

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:54.350
Google interview.

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:54.750
BARACK OBAMA: This was great.

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:55.750
I really enjoyed it.

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:57.260
Thanks, everybody.

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.012
JENNIFER WEDEL: Thank
you, Mr. President.

00:01:59.012 --> 00:02:00.360
BARACK OBAMA: Jennifer, remember
to send me that

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:00.720
information.

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:01.950
JENNIFER WEDEL: I sure will.

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:02.260
BARACK OBAMA: See you guys.

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:03.510
FEMALE SPEAKER: Bye.
