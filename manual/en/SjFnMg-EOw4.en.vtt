Hello, I'm Lisa.
I'm from Switzerland and I'm 19.

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:27.550
Hi, my name is Daniela Krauss.
I'm from Germany and I'm 27 years old.

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:31.830
Stanta Barbara is really beautiful
because the architecture is Spanish

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:37.400
and the weather is always sunny
with the Californian sun and all these palm trees.

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:38.280
I like this!

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.400
I like the school because it's
located on a university

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:44.830
and here you can meet a lot of
students from all over the world

00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:46.970
and it's really nice to meet new people here.

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.680
I like class because
it's really interesting.

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:55.090
The class is really interactive.
The atmosphere is really good

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:58.300
because the teachers are really
funny and really brilliant.

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:02.390
Our teachers all have
years of experience.

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:05.910
They love seeing our international students
succeed and grow

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:08.980
and a lot of them will transfer into
Santa Barbara City College

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:10.840
and transfer to a university as well.

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.620
We're located on the campus of
Santa Barbara City College

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:16.090
so we have all the facilities
that our students need.

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:20.590
We have everything from cafeteria, library,
fitness center, pool, tennis courts.

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.360
But we also have supportive services,
for students who need help in their home stay,

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:28.900
cultural adaptation where there's
always someone here at our school

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.040
to help the students with
whatever needs they have.

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:35.350
Hi Joyce, how are you?
Hi Lisa, I'm good. How are you?

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:39.310
Students have the option of
choosing between staying with a host family.

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.410
Being in a host family
there's a lot more interaction.

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.220
They are provided with meals
seven days a week, breakfast and dinner.

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:49.200
It's more of the family lifestyle
and a lot of students choose

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:50.630
to do that for that reason.

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:55.610
The residence option is also a
very good one and it's for students

00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:00.060
who would like to be more independent.
Our residence is centrally located,

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:04.620
so it's nice for students who aren't
necessarily interested in being with a family

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:07.210
but who also want to
connect with other students

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:08.560
who live there with them.

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:10.980
Studying in Santa Barbara
is not only learning English,

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:12.230
but it's also a lot of fun!

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.710
In 15 minutes you can reach State Street.
There you have a lot of shops.

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.400
You can go shopping all the day.
It's really cool!

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:23.520
You can find everything in State Street,
a lot of good restaurants.

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:25.880
And of course Yogurtland
you have to go there,

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:27.880
it's really cool!
You get a cup,

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:31.270
you get a lot of different
kinds of frozen yogurts.

00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:36.980
You get fresh fruits, a lot of different
sorts of chocolate, chocolate sauce

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:40.280
and so on and after a hard school day
it's really cool to hang out.

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.470
The one thing you have to try
when you are here in California

00:02:48.810 --> 00:02:51.310
you must go surfing.
It's really cool!

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:53.630
When you stand on the board,
maybe not the first time,

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:56.370
but when you stand on the board
it's a very great feeling!

00:02:56.890 --> 00:03:01.340
One of our teachers here in Kaplan
gives us a surfing lessons.

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:05.800
I tried for the first time surfing here
and I like this very much.

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:11.440
After school I can go to the
beach and play volleyball.

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:14.550
We can have a lot of fun.

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:19.290
You can play frisbee
or you can rent a jet ski and you can do

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:21.150
all things here.
It's really cool!

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:23.740
In the evening there are
lots of things to do here.

00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:25.230
There are lots of clubs.

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:29.320
For example the Sharkeez on every Monday
you have international nights.

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:33.360
You can dance and you can meet a lot of
new friends and have a lot of fun.

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:36.560
I would recommend Kaplan to all my friends

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:39.760
because since I have been here
my English has improved very well.

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:42.900
I'm so glad that I came here because
I met a lot of new friends.

00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:48.180
I learned a lot of new things
and I made so many nice experiences.
