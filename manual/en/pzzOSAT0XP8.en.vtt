00:00:02.469 --> 00:00:04.319
Jefferson's original capitals

00:00:04.319 --> 00:00:08.200
were carved by the Raggi boys in Carrara
in Italy.

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:11.720
Jefferson saw them as part of the
education

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:14.740
of the University. You learn from the
architecture.

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:16.880
And so here they are,

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.900
on the most prominent building at the university,

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:25.730
it was the mind of the University. The capitals
were very badly damaged in the fire.

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:28.840
This marble that was replaced in the early
twentieth century

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:31.300
deteriorated very, very badly.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:33.720
[Lahendro] As we began
planning

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:37.280
for the current multi-year renovation at
the Rotunda, a UNESCO World Heritage

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:40.930
Site, we knew we wanted to look at
replacing the capitals.

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:44.230
Despite all out efforts to preserve them,

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:48.780
there was no way to keep them from still
falling apart. The University then began

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:53.059
a long process to select the marble to
be used and the contractors to carve

00:00:53.059 --> 00:00:55.000
and install the replacement capitals.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.309
[Guy-Wilson]  And the
decision was made

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:02.780
let's get the very best that is possible
anywhere and duplicate the original Jeffersons.

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:06.380
[Wylie] I was walking by the Fralin Museum one
day

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.310
and there's a crew out scanning one of the old capitals 

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:13.780
to the rotunda. When I started to talk to
them turned out they were from Carrara. So

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:17.560
I showed them my book and we talked about
all these people we knew.

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:21.310
And I was able to go over to Carrara,

00:01:21.310 --> 00:01:24.360
film and photograph the initial

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:29.800
modeling they were making.

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:34.410
They had taken those 3D scans and
produced a quarter fragment of one of

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:35.240
the capitals.

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:39.340
[Lahendro] Not only did we have the scans,

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:42.950
we also sent over 3 large remnants.

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:46.200
And then the Pedrini carvers did a clay

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.380
mock-up of the top part that we didn't
know as well.

00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:54.090
[Wylie] So it was super fascinating to see these
guys working with both

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.000
fragments of stone, photographs from the
1800's,

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.090
and trying to make a fragment that then
the UVA architects and the people working

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:03.570
on the project would come over

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:10.300
and approve for them to then go to a
full-scale capital.

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:13.430
And then that started them on their
process of,

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:17.710
loading the blocks of marble which had
come down from the quarry,

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:22.770
putting them into the robotic carvers.
[Lahendro] Pedrini used the CNC machines

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:27.440
to cut out the bulk material and take it
to within 10-15 percent

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.660
of the final product. Then carvers

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.690
come in and, by hand, carve that last 10 to
15 percent.

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:36.000
of the capital.   

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.850
[Guy-Wilson] when I saw them un-crated it
was very, very moving 

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:45.290
because they are so beautifully
done.

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:48.350
[Wylie] Finally, it was amazing to see

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:51.760
the capitals picked off the trucks
here at UVA,

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:55.140
moved slowly into place, to finally being placed

00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:58.510
on top of the columns perfectly
positioned.

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:03.000
It was just fantastic to see this
process from the beginning to the end.
