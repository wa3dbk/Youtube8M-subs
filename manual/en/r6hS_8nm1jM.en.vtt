00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:03.900
Find the absolute value
of x when x is equal to 5,

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:09.240
x is equal to negative 10,
and x is equal to negative 12.

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:13.530
So the absolute value,
the way of writing it

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.810
is almost more complicated
than what it really is.

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:19.535
The absolute value is really
just the distance of x from 0.

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:28.460
So let me just draw a fast
number line over here.

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:31.510
So let's just put
0 right over here,

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:33.880
since we're thinking
about the distance from 0.

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:36.150
So let's just think
about the absolute value.

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:37.650
Let's think about
the absolute value

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:39.640
of x when x is equal to 5.

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:42.390
So that's equivalent to
the absolute value of 5.

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.530
We just substituted 5 for x.

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:48.590
The absolute value of 5 is
the distance of 5 from the 0.

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:51.570
So you go 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:55.350
5 is exactly 5 to
the right of 0.

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.300
So the absolute
value of 5 is just 5.

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:00.760
Now I think you
already get to see

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:02.670
this is a pretty
straightforward concept.

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:07.960
Now let's do something a
little more interesting,

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:10.480
the absolute value of x when
x is equal to negative 10.

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:13.120
So let's just put
negative 10 in for x.

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:16.000
This is the distance that
negative 10 is from 0.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.110
And so let's just go negative
1, negative 2, negative 3,

00:01:19.110 --> 00:01:22.620
negative 4, negative 5, negative
6, negative 7, negative 8,

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:23.920
negative 9, negative 10.

00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.020
I should extend the
number line more.

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:28.470
So this right here
is negative 10.

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.770
So how far is it away from 0?

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.590
Well, it's 10 to the left of 0.

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.780
So you put a 10 here.

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.670
And so in general,
absolute value

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.460
will always be a
positive quantity.

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:43.160
And when we're rethinking
about just absolute values

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:45.830
of just numbers, it's
just going to be,

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:48.310
really, the positive
version of that number.

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:49.590
Let's do one more.

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.020
Well, they tell us to do one
more, the absolute value of x

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:54.920
when x is equal to negative 12.

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:57.912
So we have the absolute
value of negative 12.

00:01:57.912 --> 00:01:59.620
We don't even to look
at the number line.

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:01.545
It's just going to be
the positive version

00:02:01.545 --> 00:02:02.740
of negative 12.

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:04.920
It's just going
to be equal to 12.

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.779
And this is just saying that
negative 12 is 12 away from 0.

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:10.070
And we could draw it over here.

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:10.979
This is negative 11.

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:13.080
Negative 12 is right over here.

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:21.396
It is 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7,
8, 9, 10, 11, 12 away from 0.
