00:00:07.399 --> 00:00:08.399
Hey guys!

00:00:08.399 --> 00:00:10.950
So this is the book cover tag.

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:16.020
I was tagged by WordsofaReader who also made
a really great video, so you should go watch

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:17.020
hers.

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:20.560
The first question is - what are my six favorite
book covers?

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:23.910
So the first one is this edition of Wuthering
Heights.

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:30.060
I really like the composition of the cover,
how the image takes up most of the space,

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:34.180
and this picture definitely really captures
the mood of the story.

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:37.510
The next one is this edition of One Day.

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:43.190
I really like the kind of bold graphic design
and these bright colors just really make it

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:46.470
pop, and I really love silhouettes.

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:51.390
I really love this edition of Mrs Dalloway
by Virginia Woolf.

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:57.900
I love the typeface here and the really subtle
colors, as well as the vintage photograph.

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:01.970
It's just all really well designed and brought
together.

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:05.379
Next is this collection of Emily Bronte's
poems.

00:01:05.379 --> 00:01:11.810
I love the intricate little details, the graphic
design on the spine is really great, and the

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:16.390
design on the first couple pages, I also just
really like.

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:20.860
The fifth book is Wildwood, which I have mentioned
several times.

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:26.290
It's illustrated by Carson Ellis, and she
has a blog post where she goes through the

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:31.060
whole process of designing this, which is
really fascinating, so I'll put a link below.

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:37.140
I love how the title and their names are kind
of really shiny, and also pop out from the

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.150
physical paper and add a kind of texture.

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:45.080
And then you get the hint of the bright red
of the actual book itself.

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:52.229
So without the dust jacket you just have bright
red and a lone golden raven, which hints to

00:01:52.229 --> 00:01:53.790
what happens in the book.

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.540
And then this simple spine is just really
great.

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:02.850
And of course, I have to include this edition
of Jane Austen's Seven Novels.

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:11.300
It's got the kind of embossing and gold inlay,
gold page edges, just all of these flowery

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:15.370
details, the kind of wallpaper-y design on
the inside.

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:17.159
As well as this title page.

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:19.930
I just really love stuff like this.

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:24.629
So the second question is about keeping series
covers together.

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:31.819
So often, they will re-design covers before
the series is even complete, so I personally

00:02:31.819 --> 00:02:34.840
like to have my covers match as well as I
can.

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:39.939
When I bought my own set of the Harry Potter
books, I went to Powell's in Portland and

00:02:39.939 --> 00:02:44.879
just went through all of their copies and
found the matching set that I could.

00:02:44.879 --> 00:02:53.359
So I went with these paperback editions, with
the checkered spine, and the first three all

00:02:53.359 --> 00:02:59.719
match and have shiny letters and then the
checkered pattern has this kind of implied

00:02:59.719 --> 00:03:01.159
fabric texture.

00:03:01.159 --> 00:03:08.920
But the other ones I got don't have the fabric
texture and the lettering isn't shiny, but

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:12.599
it still matches close enough, so I'm pretty
happy with it.

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:16.260
The next question is how important is the
book cover?

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:20.290
To me it's not all that important, but it
is still pretty important.

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:25.980
For example, if you go to Goodreads, and look
at all the giveaways, you can see a lot of

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:29.870
really crappy covers and a lot of really well
designed covers.

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:33.459
The cover can definitely push me away or intrigue
me further.

00:03:33.459 --> 00:03:38.120
But I never rely on just the cover alone when
I buy a book.

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:41.480
The next question is what kind of book covers
draw you in?

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:47.579
I really like kind of graphic floral designs,
like here on the corner of The Name of the

00:03:47.579 --> 00:03:49.930
Star, or on Emily Bronte's poems.

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:57.469
I like silhouettes, like Two Histories of
England by Jane Austen and Charles Dickens.

00:03:57.469 --> 00:04:00.810
Or again, on One Day.

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:06.370
Covers that are very graphic with bright colors
and sharp lines that really pop out.

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:09.510
Catcher in the Rye, this cover is definitely
very graphic.

00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:14.709
I love the line quality paired with the kind
of more raw red paint.

00:04:14.709 --> 00:04:19.799
The colors are really simple, and I really
love the kind of vintage look of this, especially

00:04:19.799 --> 00:04:22.830
with the hand painted typography.

00:04:22.830 --> 00:04:26.949
The next question - what are your book cover
pet peeves?

00:04:26.949 --> 00:04:34.380
I really stay away from books that have shirtless
guys on the front, or girls in prom dresses,

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:38.050
or people posed in front of some kind of wasteland.

00:04:38.050 --> 00:04:43.400
I really agree with Leslie in how she stays
away from photographs of people on covers,

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:45.340
they just feel really posed.

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:51.720
One exception I have is this cover of Mrs
Dalloway, it's not a very posed picture and

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:54.229
it just really is beautiful.

00:04:54.229 --> 00:04:57.860
And, like I said the whole cover just really
flows together.

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:01.990
The next question is do you like short descriptions
or long ones?

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:07.931
I like enough of a basic description to tell
me what it's about, what genre it is, but

00:05:07.931 --> 00:05:10.210
without revealing huge amounts of the plot.

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:15.460
If I'm in a bookstore and there is no description
on the back or the front flap that really

00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:20.020
does bother me, because how am I supposed
to know if I'm interested in it or not?

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:26.129
But more often I am hearing about books through
the internet, and on Goodreads.

00:05:26.129 --> 00:05:29.199
Rather than just browsing through a store.

00:05:29.199 --> 00:05:34.370
Because I can't really afford to just browse
lately, it's too much of a temptation.

00:05:34.370 --> 00:05:39.491
I have gotten a couple requests to show the
illustrations in some of these books, so I

00:05:39.491 --> 00:05:41.250
am going to do that.

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:43.360
So make sure to watch out for the video.

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:46.349
As always, thanks for watching, and I'll see
you later!
