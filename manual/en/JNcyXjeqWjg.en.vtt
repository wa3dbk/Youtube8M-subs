00:00:07.779 --> 00:00:11.080
Hi I'm Mike, and this is "Mike's Road Trip!"

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:13.950
"Get off the road" says driver.

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:19.840
Hey Guys, well I've traveled long and far
for this next trip, I in the Nordic country

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:21.250
of Finland.

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:25.620
Where in a few days I'll be participating
in a "winter on wheels" event in the northern

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:26.669
part of the country.

00:00:26.669 --> 00:00:33.320
But right now, I'm in the vibrant city of
Helsinki, located right on the Baltic Sea,

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.400
this is the nation's capital.

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:40.129
So come along with me, and let me show you
around.

00:00:40.129 --> 00:00:50.790
After a long journey from the west coast of
the US, my first priority was some rest.

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:56.149
The next morning I strolled the cobble stone
streets of Helsinki to get my bearings, while

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:02.969
seeing some interesting and talented street
performers.

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:13.850
Then I took a short ferry ride across the
harbor to the Suomenlinna Sea Fortress one

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:16.660
of the most popular sights in Helsinki.

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:22.960
Here, visitors can explore historic buildings
while finding solace from the hustle and bustle

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:33.100
of town.

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:49.039
Back in town you'll find plenty of outdoor
activities, architecture and epicurean delights.

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:54.830
Well know I'm Lapland area, staying in the
regional capital of Rovaniemi, where the winter

00:01:54.830 --> 00:02:00.460
activities thrill, and the holiday spirit,
well, it never ends.

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:05.530
Rovaniemi is located in the Arctic Circle
and is the official headquarters for the "real"

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:11.260
Santa Claus, where I got a chance to meet
the man himself.

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:16.030
This is the official post office for Santa
Claus, where over half a million children

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:26.620
from around the world send their Christmas
wishes.

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:41.580
Santa Claus Village is a magical place with
lots of things to see and do.

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:45.570
Even the hotel I stayed at is named after
ol' St. Nick.

00:02:45.570 --> 00:02:59.510
Tonight I'm having dinner in an igloo at a
place called, Snowland.

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:05.900
I had a host of winter activities in my bucket
list and the folks from Lapland Safaris allowed

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:07.659
me to check most of them.

00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:12.489
So right now we're about to participate in
the rally sport.

00:03:12.489 --> 00:03:28.030
Did you get this in 3rd gear?

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:32.470
reply: "no"

00:03:32.470 --> 00:03:37.680
Well, scratch another one off the bucket list.

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:43.670
After a break to warm up by a fire, we then
had an opportunity to go dog sledding and

00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:52.909
ride in a reindeer slight before hoping on
the snowmobiles toward our destination.

00:03:52.909 --> 00:03:59.890
As night fell, we relaxed in a sauna and invigorated
ourselves with a dip in a frozen river.

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:10.219
Then, it was time to dine by fire in a relaxing
lodge to conclude the evening.

00:04:10.219 --> 00:04:21.400
The next day it was all about culture, with
a visit to the Arktikum museum, that evening

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:30.300
we enjoyed some local fine dining cuisine.

00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:37.000
The adventures in Rovenimi never seemed to
end, the next day I went snowshoeing, tobogganing,

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:47.610
and got to see some great snow athletes.

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:55.639
Well now I've traveled south to the seaside
town of Kemi, which is home to this extraordinary

00:04:55.639 --> 00:04:58.030
snow castle.

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:05.340
Visiting the Snow Castle was such a unique
experience, and yes, I even stayed the night.

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:11.410
The next day I took an Olokolo ride, then,
I boarded the only tourist icebreaker cruise

00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:17.390
in the world.

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:22.919
Of course the grand finale of visiting Lapland
Finland, were the Northern Lights...

00:05:22.919 --> 00:05:44.780
Until next time...we'll see ya on the road...
