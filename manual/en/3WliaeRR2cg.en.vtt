00:00:01.647 --> 00:00:07.647
THERE IS A NEW CULINARY CURRICULUM BEING OFFERED AT THE UNIVERSITY 
 OF HOUSTON THIS FALL…. WELL, SORT OF…  

00:00:07.895 --> 00:00:10.895
You won't see steam table pans anywhere. 

00:00:11.979 --> 00:00:15.979
YOU COULD SAY THESE CHEFS ARE CERTAINLY GIVING 
 A LESSON ON GRADE A COLLEGE CUISINE…

00:00:15.916 --> 00:00:22.916
You will see open flames, a fired oven, a round griddle with 
 food on it as its cooking like Mahi Mahi. 

00:00:24.242 --> 00:00:28.242
THE FRESH FOOD COMPANY AT MOODY TOWERS WAS A CONCEPT 
 COOKED UP FOR U-H ABOUT A YEAR AGO. 

00:00:29.196 --> 00:00:38.196
Now we have the building, we are getting the stuff up and running, and come first day 
 of school we will be packed with students with eyes as big as a dish.

00:00:39.242 --> 00:00:43.242
BECAUSE IT’S NOT JUST THE SPACE THAT’S UNDERGONE RENOVATION… SO HAS THE MENU.

00:00:44.071 --> 00:00:53.071
This station is all vegetarian. Wow. Here we have some polenta cakes that 
 we did with a tomatoe dish on the other side today.

00:00:53.887 --> 00:00:57.887
And right here the chefs are making a vegetable Moraccan stew.

00:00:58.992 --> 00:01:05.992
It's fresh, it's vibrant, it's interactive. All of the 
 cooks are talking with the students, the faculty.

00:01:06.099 --> 00:01:13.099
If you want something that is made to order or you have an allergy to 
 something, or say you don't like tomatoes or what not, we can accommodate.

00:01:14.374 --> 00:01:19.374
We are all set to accommodate that request and those style of food. 

00:01:19.319 --> 00:01:25.319
THE FOCUS IS ON FRESHNESS… WITH NINE MADE-TO-ORDER STATIONS 
 THAT RANGE FROM VEGETARIAN TO INTERNATIONAL FLARE.

00:01:26.019 --> 00:01:30.019
Here I have an outside calzone with fresh vegetables and gorgonzola cheese.

00:01:30.697 --> 00:01:37.697
All of these stations are geared to do 
 something different, do something wild, to evolve.

00:01:38.174 --> 00:01:42.170
We don’t want the students seeing the same thing over and over again.

00:01:42.818 --> 00:01:47.820
THE FRESH FOOD COMPANY CONCEPT HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTED AT A NUMBER OF CAMPUSES NATIONWIDE

00:01:47.708 --> 00:01:52.710
BUT THE UNVERSITY OF HOUSTON IS THE LARGEST… AND 
 FIRST TO COME TO THE SOUTHWEST UNITED STATES.

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:59.680
I don’t even like to use that name cafeteria, 
 because it's not a cafeteria, it’s a restaurant.

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:03.980
It's awesome, I am ready to eat.

00:02:05.016 --> 00:02:10.020
Giving you a taste of what to expect at 
 the University of Houston, I'm Shawn Lindsey.
