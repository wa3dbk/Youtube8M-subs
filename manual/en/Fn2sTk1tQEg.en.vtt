00:00:00.133 --> 00:00:05.133
(upbeat music)

00:00:18.605 --> 00:00:20.149
Hey everyone, how's it going?

00:00:20.149 --> 00:00:22.111
Welcome back to DIYMAS,

00:00:22.111 --> 00:00:23.942
and this week we are dedicating it

00:00:23.942 --> 00:00:27.353
to making gift ideas.

00:00:27.353 --> 00:00:32.162
So starting with this week
of gift ideas for DIYMAS,

00:00:32.162 --> 00:00:34.205
I am going to show you how to make some

00:00:34.205 --> 00:00:38.083
adorable, absolutely cute pillows.

00:00:38.083 --> 00:00:39.627
They're not just any pillows,

00:00:39.627 --> 00:00:42.756
there are penguin pillows and owl pillows.

00:00:42.756 --> 00:00:45.508
This right here is my
friend Walter, the penguin.

00:00:45.508 --> 00:00:50.093
And today we decided to
dress in similar styles.

00:00:50.093 --> 00:00:52.474
So we have on our plaid scarves

00:00:52.474 --> 00:00:55.179
and we're ready to go
out have some hot cocoa

00:00:55.179 --> 00:00:57.301
and play snowball fights.

00:00:57.301 --> 00:01:00.697
For materials, you will need
some cozy fleece fabric,

00:01:00.697 --> 00:01:05.697
printed flannels, black,
white and orange felt.

00:01:05.812 --> 00:01:08.910
Some pillow stuffing
and a big sheet of paper

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:10.791
to cut out your template.

00:01:10.791 --> 00:01:12.114
With this big sheet of paper,

00:01:12.114 --> 00:01:14.041
I freehand my drawing.

00:01:14.041 --> 00:01:15.944
But my pillow turned out to be

00:01:15.944 --> 00:01:19.797
about 14 by 17 inches in dimension.

00:01:19.797 --> 00:01:23.001
So here I just folded my paper in half,

00:01:23.001 --> 00:01:26.089
and now I'm going to draw a big oval

00:01:26.089 --> 00:01:28.005
for my penguin.

00:01:28.005 --> 00:01:29.999
Make your pillow as big as you would like.

00:01:29.999 --> 00:01:33.729
Here I'm just doing this based
on my personal preference.

00:01:33.729 --> 00:01:37.757
After drawing my oval,
it's time to cut it out.

00:01:37.757 --> 00:01:41.020
Take that oval and place
it on top of your fabric.

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:42.982
Make sure your fabric is doubled together

00:01:42.982 --> 00:01:45.571
with the right sides facing inward.

00:01:45.571 --> 00:01:47.986
It's time to make the second template.

00:01:47.986 --> 00:01:51.318
Here I'm using the same oval
that I just cut out earlier.

00:01:51.318 --> 00:01:54.116
And to make the penguin's face and body,

00:01:54.116 --> 00:01:56.786
I'm creating a big loop up top,

00:01:56.786 --> 00:02:00.420
and for the arm I'm creating
a little loop inward.

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:02.322
So this almost looks like an S.

00:02:02.322 --> 00:02:05.215
And then I'm creating
another loop as the body.

00:02:05.215 --> 00:02:06.922
Now I'm drawing in the eyes,

00:02:06.922 --> 00:02:08.547
so that way this will give me an idea

00:02:08.547 --> 00:02:12.761
on how the penguin would look as a pillow.

00:02:12.761 --> 00:02:15.559
Cut out the shape and
body of your penguin.

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:16.848
Then take the template and place it

00:02:16.848 --> 00:02:19.890
on the wrong side of
your white felt material.

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:21.724
Now with a pen or marker,

00:02:21.724 --> 00:02:25.648
draw out your penguin's face, body,

00:02:25.648 --> 00:02:27.065
I don't know what to call this (laughs).

00:02:27.065 --> 00:02:30.606
It's pretty much a face and a body.

00:02:30.606 --> 00:02:32.359
Cut out the penguin's face and body,

00:02:32.359 --> 00:02:34.995
and now you're going to make some circles

00:02:34.995 --> 00:02:36.074
for the eyeballs,

00:02:36.074 --> 00:02:39.151
and a little triangle for the beak.

00:02:39.151 --> 00:02:40.834
After you figure out how you would like

00:02:40.834 --> 00:02:42.330
your penguin's face to look,

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:44.584
glue it on to your white fleece.

00:02:44.584 --> 00:02:46.500
Back to the big fleece oval cutout,

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:49.426
open it so that way the
right sides can face you.

00:02:49.426 --> 00:02:51.841
And with one piece of the oval,

00:02:51.841 --> 00:02:55.010
glue the penguin's face and
body onto the right side

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:56.810
of that one oval.

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:58.516
If you want to use the hot glue method,

00:02:58.516 --> 00:03:00.188
then take out your hot glue gun,

00:03:00.188 --> 00:03:04.275
and apply glue along the
cutline of your penguin.

00:03:04.275 --> 00:03:06.446
Make sure to leave a hole on the bottom

00:03:06.446 --> 00:03:07.767
of your penguin that's big enough

00:03:07.767 --> 00:03:09.406
for you to stick your hand through.

00:03:09.406 --> 00:03:11.485
That sounds kind of wrong
and strange (laughs),

00:03:11.485 --> 00:03:13.528
but you want to leave a hole big enough

00:03:13.528 --> 00:03:16.407
so that way you can do
your stuffing later on.

00:03:16.407 --> 00:03:18.207
Apply a nice strip of hot glue,

00:03:18.207 --> 00:03:20.668
then quickly lap over your other oval

00:03:20.668 --> 00:03:23.083
and make sure that the right
sides are facing together.

00:03:23.083 --> 00:03:25.498
And press it downward.

00:03:25.498 --> 00:03:27.297
Then apply more hot glue around,

00:03:27.297 --> 00:03:30.455
and press the fabric
together as you're going.

00:03:30.455 --> 00:03:33.219
Let the glue set for a good hour or so,

00:03:33.219 --> 00:03:36.638
before turning the penguin inside out.

00:03:36.969 --> 00:03:38.013
If you have a sewing machine

00:03:38.013 --> 00:03:38.849
and you want to use it,

00:03:38.849 --> 00:03:41.020
you can absolutely use it at this step

00:03:41.020 --> 00:03:42.181
and not do the gluing method.

00:03:42.181 --> 00:03:44.608
I'm just demonstrating the gluing method

00:03:44.608 --> 00:03:48.033
for those of you who don't
have a sewing machine.

00:03:48.033 --> 00:03:49.902
It's now time to take
out the pillow stuffing

00:03:49.902 --> 00:03:51.574
and stuff your penguin,

00:03:51.574 --> 00:03:54.784
so that way he can be round and chubby.

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:56.288
After that, to seal the opening

00:03:56.288 --> 00:03:59.949
just take glue gun and
seal the opening closed.

00:03:59.949 --> 00:04:01.782
If you want to see how I
seal the opening closed,

00:04:01.782 --> 00:04:04.277
just stick around for the owl tutorial.

00:04:04.277 --> 00:04:04.988
(bell chime)

00:04:04.988 --> 00:04:06.381
Making the owl is very similar

00:04:06.381 --> 00:04:07.798
to making the penguin.

00:04:07.798 --> 00:04:10.004
Instead of drawing a big oval,

00:04:10.004 --> 00:04:13.591
I drew a big U and then
up top for the ears,

00:04:13.591 --> 00:04:16.552
I just drew a loop.

00:04:16.552 --> 00:04:18.014
Cut out the owl shape

00:04:18.014 --> 00:04:19.520
and you're going to do the same steps

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:21.099
you did for the penguin,

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:24.347
by placing it on top of
a double layer of fabric

00:04:24.347 --> 00:04:26.472
with the right sides facing inward.

00:04:26.472 --> 00:04:29.479
Trace the shape of the
owl and then cut it out.

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:30.847
For the tummy of the owl,

00:04:30.847 --> 00:04:33.101
I choose to use a printed material,

00:04:33.101 --> 00:04:36.433
and then I just drew
out a shape of an apple.

00:04:36.433 --> 00:04:38.744
After that I made some eyes for my owl,

00:04:38.744 --> 00:04:40.114
and a beak.

00:04:40.114 --> 00:04:42.656
Then I placed everything
on the shape of my owl

00:04:42.656 --> 00:04:45.327
to see how it looks altogether.

00:04:45.327 --> 00:04:46.546
And once I'm happy with that,

00:04:46.546 --> 00:04:50.249
I just glue everything
together on to the felt.

00:04:50.249 --> 00:04:53.303
Turn the owl right sides facing in,

00:04:53.303 --> 00:04:55.413
and then do the same thing,

00:04:55.413 --> 00:04:57.297
sew around the owl or you can also

00:04:57.297 --> 00:05:00.045
glue around the edges of the owl.

00:05:00.045 --> 00:05:02.312
Make sure to leave an
opening at the bottom

00:05:02.312 --> 00:05:03.810
for your stuffing.

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:05.180
Turn your owl inside out

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:07.734
and make sure to pop the ears out.

00:05:07.734 --> 00:05:09.150
Then stuff your owl up,

00:05:09.150 --> 00:05:12.096
so that way he can be
nice, plump and chubby.

00:05:12.096 --> 00:05:15.327
For the bottom of your
owl and for your penguin,

00:05:15.327 --> 00:05:17.359
make sure to fold in the opening

00:05:17.359 --> 00:05:21.039
and then glue it about one inch at a time.

00:05:21.039 --> 00:05:22.908
Make sure to be careful with hot glue gun,

00:05:22.908 --> 00:05:27.041
especially at this part,
because you could burn yourself.

00:05:27.041 --> 00:05:29.421
If you are sensitive to heat, I recommend,

00:05:29.421 --> 00:05:34.004
I highly recommend that
you handsew this together.

00:05:34.004 --> 00:05:36.381
Alright guys, that is it for today.

00:05:36.381 --> 00:05:39.051
Don't forget to give this
video a big thumbs up

00:05:39.051 --> 00:05:41.257
if you think I am cute.

00:05:41.257 --> 00:05:43.556
If not, then I'm very sad.

00:05:43.556 --> 00:05:45.390
Alright guys, so you heard Walter right?

00:05:45.390 --> 00:05:47.434
He said give this video a thumbs up

00:05:47.434 --> 00:05:48.978
to make him happy.

00:05:48.978 --> 00:05:51.602
And subscribe if you guys haven't.

00:05:51.602 --> 00:05:55.639
Also, if you guys haven't
seen my last view DIYMAS

00:05:55.639 --> 00:05:58.068
and videos, then check those out.

00:05:58.068 --> 00:06:00.820
I will link them on
the side of this video,

00:06:00.820 --> 00:06:03.908
somewhere around on the
bottom, I don't know.

00:06:03.908 --> 00:06:04.999
Check it out.

00:06:04.999 --> 00:06:06.657
I'll have the links
available for you guys,

00:06:06.657 --> 00:06:10.163
and I will see you guys
in my next DIYMAS video.

00:06:10.163 --> 00:06:12.090
Bye, love you.

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:13.716
Ciao.

00:06:13.716 --> 00:06:18.716
