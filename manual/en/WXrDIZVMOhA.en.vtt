Promise, Hope Grace and Faith appear to be
very different, but there's one common thing

00:00:09.519 --> 00:00:10.519
they share.

00:00:10.519 --> 00:00:16.580
If you take a closer look, you'll
notice they all have curly hair!

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:22.119
My Hair Is So Happy is the only children's
book written and illustrated for EVERY little

00:00:22.119 --> 00:00:23.460
curly girl.

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:39.820
Be sure to pick up your copy on
Amazon.com, BarnesandNoble.com and on Kindle.

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:44.770
There are very few treatments that I do on
my hair that I will absolutely rave about

00:00:44.770 --> 00:00:48.140
and the apple cider vinegar rinse is definitely
one of them.

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:56.929
I fill a 22 once spray bottle with about 8
ounces of ACV and then water all the way to

00:00:56.929 --> 00:00:57.929
the top.

00:00:57.929 --> 00:01:03.321
I always do my ACV rinses on wet hair, so
I'm going to take down my hair and jump in

00:01:03.321 --> 00:01:05.470
the shower and wet it...

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:11.580
So now I'm going to divide my hair into four
sections and then use the spray bottle to

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:18.830
soak down each section of my hair with apple
cider vinegar.

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:30.570
Ain't it just like stuff to not work the moment
you're trying to demonstrate it in a video?

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:37.940
So, my big spray bottle clearly did not work
so I transferred my ACV rinse to a smaller

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:40.630
spray bottle.

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:49.150
It doesn't matter if I'm washing my hair with
ACV, conditioner or shampoo, I always scrub

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:50.590
my scalp.

00:01:50.590 --> 00:02:00.050
And after that I just thoroughly rinse my
hair and I'm telling y'all, I love it!

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:09.429
ACV rinses always leave my hair feeling so
super soft, clean but not stripped and it's

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:14.810
so freaking easy to detangle my hair after
an ACV rinse.

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:20.709
The best part about this treatment is
that the effects of it last up until the next

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:24.210
month when I do the treatment again.

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:28.890
Let me know down in the comment section what's
your preferred method of cleansing and clarifying

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:30.370
your hair.

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:39.980
Until next time y'all.

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:48.970
Peace.
