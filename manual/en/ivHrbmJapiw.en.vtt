00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:23.359
the twenty flutters up one and one of my
favorite designed to raise more like his

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:26.509
unit has a lot of space audience i did

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:30.449
as deep as compared to the nineteen it
really gives a different field this unit

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:33.470
does happy front powered jackie

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:36.470

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:38.650
scouted outside shower

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:40.280
aluminum wheels

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:49.060
not the major de floorboard amount
there's a few rock chips on the front of

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:50.700
the stock like mister

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.480
there's fewer rock tanks up here on the
front of the major

00:00:55.480 --> 00:00:58.870
say well on the other side there's few
love the gipper

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:04.400
brought this issue took the kit for
anywhere near ended yet this

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.360
buildings on the rest of the body of
this

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:08.500
scratches

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:09.760
gorgeous

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:14.720
got a huge outside awning

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:16.410
get around the back together

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:22.100
swore say that there's no dings or dents
on the rear end of this

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:27.430
if i can get back for an hour

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:30.870

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:38.950
coast

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:42.560
the get a lot of version of the white
school in the belt blind

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:49.560
the reason for that is because of the
salt dot here we don't have any assault

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.760
laws on that issue

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:59.930

got a nice big bear

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:07.570
the ban itself a seventy eight inches
long it's trenches longer than the

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:11.710
nineteen s probably the reason why i
like it on a bigger target ourself i

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:16.340
like the extra life everything is it's
even longer than that because you have

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.549
these bolsters on each end

00:02:18.549 --> 00:02:20.469
but if you pull those out of the way

00:02:20.469 --> 00:02:24.239
we need to get a couple extra inches out
of there

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:25.529
great lighting

00:02:25.529 --> 00:02:30.999

00:02:30.999 --> 00:02:34.129
this is something to stop so you have
read it

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:36.959
airstrip really puts together a super
fine product

00:02:36.959 --> 00:02:38.489
this unit does have

00:02:38.489 --> 00:02:43.499
the audio package it has a tendency d
changer has a dvd player

00:02:43.499 --> 00:02:46.340
got a hook ups that evoke almost
anything that you want through the

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.879
system

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:53.869
got about five pro-growth fifteen inch

00:02:53.869 --> 00:02:55.459
there is a high deputy

00:02:55.459 --> 00:03:00.059
this unit does have the heat stroke and
a furnace what that means she is if you

00:03:00.059 --> 00:03:01.209
plug it in

00:03:01.209 --> 00:03:04.759
to your house you don't have to use up
your propane out of work down to about

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:08.039
forty five degrees i think the
manufacturer actually says it will lower

00:03:08.039 --> 00:03:08.959
manhattan

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:13.429

uh... the sort of maybe a sporter stock

00:03:17.189 --> 00:03:18.019
market

00:03:18.019 --> 00:03:19.480

00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:21.669
speakers

00:03:21.669 --> 00:03:26.139
you could have front and rear fantastic
standard for over top of the better

00:03:26.139 --> 00:03:27.449
in one right there

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:29.759
the kitchen area in here is

00:03:29.759 --> 00:03:34.080
more than twice the size of the nineteen
if not before five times the size

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:37.600
the ninety just has no kitchen
countertop space was a twenty

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.820
souls all kitchen countertops peso

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:42.780
if you're into cooking and entertaining
and things like that
