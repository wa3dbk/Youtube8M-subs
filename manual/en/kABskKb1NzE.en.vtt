00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:11.290
you'll need the following tools to
service a doc200 trap you'll

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:17.290
need at all to open the tunnel other
ratchet or a squared screwdriver, a wire

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:26.080
brush safety or multiples, especially for
double set, bait; 'Eraze' in this case, a

00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:35.260
pair of gloves . ADOC 200 setting tool - (this can be optional) it's good idea to carry

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:40.989
spare tools in this case one for opening
the tunnel also marked with flagging

00:00:40.989 --> 00:00:45.550
tape so that's make sure easier to find
when you get on the ground

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:48.760
flagging tape comes in this form

00:01:05.856 --> 00:01:12.400
We open the lid so that it is supported
by the box. We are sitting behind the

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:20.590
track with hand firm on the back of the
box pull the draw arm back to the top

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:32.619
grab with both hands, pulled over the
Waddington trigger, lock in place.

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:38.950
Over the Waddington trigger. Locks into
place on the sear.

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:50.810
When cleaning our trap important to make it safe,

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:59.540
we insert safety clip. As a backup
precautionary method, if you left have

00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:17.360
your safety clip can use just the old
Squarehead screwdriver.

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:20.360
focusing on the trigger mechanism

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:52.239
Trigger arm can be out of alignment by being too low, which stops it from catching

00:02:52.239 --> 00:03:04.630
Trigger can also the out of alignment by
being too high which stops it from setting

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:25.900
Adjust trigger arm with pliers or custom-made tool. Checking to see if  trap is adjusted.

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:28.900
And it works

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:49.920
Refresh bait making sure that bait sits
firmly on top of nails.

00:04:08.319 --> 00:04:09.910
some tek screws are quite long.

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:16.150
as long as it is firmly and
tightly screwed down,

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:17.980
it doesn't necessarily need to go all the way in.
