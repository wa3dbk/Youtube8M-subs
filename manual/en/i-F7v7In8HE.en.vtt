00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:04.720
church yards are very good places to come and photograph snowy scenes,

00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:09.830
their usually fairly quiet. It certainly gives you something to concentrate on your

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:10.410
shot,

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.660
the point of focus, now in between
leaving my pad and coming here

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:18.690
the lights changed, we have got sunshine
we've got the whole combine going on

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:19.770
which he's brilliant

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:25.080
now then, notice I've come along the fence line here, followed the hedge

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.670
I don't want anymore footprints in the
snow that I can possibly avoid

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:33.230
there's one or two already. I also chose this corner because

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:38.290
there's these lumps of snow just hanging on the tree here, it's an absolutely brilliant

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:39.670
piece of foreground.

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:45.550
Camera, you'll notice I've got it

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:49.789
in a bag always take the camera bag with
you when you go out shooting in snow

00:00:49.789 --> 00:00:53.120
because you might need to put something
down change lenses you don't wanna leave it in

00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:53.870
the snow

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:57.079
and there's another reason too, which I
will tell you about later.

00:00:57.079 --> 00:01:00.289
No I've put my wide angle lens on,

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:04.629
because I wanna get the whole snowy
scene going on so

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:08.799
we've already set our exposure plus 1.7
just like back in the field

00:01:08.799 --> 00:01:12.450
because there's still tons of snow and i'm gonna shoot a picture of the church

00:01:12.450 --> 00:01:16.100
and i'm gonna use this snow hanging on the

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:19.890
the tree to give depth to the picture, i'm gonna get in quite close to this

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:23.840
let's just focus her up, focus her up.

00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:27.340
i'm gonna focus on the wall of that bench there, so that i know that i have

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:32.119
lot's of depth of field in close to there, lovely, bright, snowy

00:01:32.119 --> 00:01:36.630
intimate snow picture,  much better than the trees in my film

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:37.270
even if we had the light there it still works better because

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:41.110
we got a proper point to focus to look at

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:44.399
and by composing it was some snow strong in the foreground

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:48.149
we're really saying this is a good snowy
sort of a scene.

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:51.829
it's Christmasy, the other thing that
works well

00:01:51.829 --> 00:01:56.060
are close ups little fine details which
probably tell the snow story

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.189
even better the wider scene
