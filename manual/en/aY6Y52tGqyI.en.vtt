00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:05.240
Hi, I am Ahmed Barkhia and here we are
with the professor Koen de Smet and

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:07.250
professor Alessandro Calistri

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:10.550
I'm here in this prestigious

00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:14.160
Hip Medical Center, because I want
to solve my problem

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.340
and I want to ask you something about
that.

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:22.539
so the first is: "Can you explain what is exactly

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:24.020
my pathology?".

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:27.740
Yeah, Acondroplasia it's a congenital defect

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:28.960
pathology

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.840
that's can cause it's what you're interest

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:37.740
degenerative problems on your articulation. So, as you can see on this X-rays

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.480
You have a conjured and destroyed

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:45.770
femoral head on the right hip, Osteonecrosis,

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:49.190
and so for that you have inflammation

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:50.800
and problems.

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:52.440
Okey.

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:57.690
"How can this pathology will be solved?"
In your case

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:01.520
Well, the only solution is hip replacement.

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:05.100
because of the osteoarthritis

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.229
and your special congenital disease

00:01:08.229 --> 00:01:11.229
there are areas where the cartilages

00:01:11.229 --> 00:01:15.290
completely gone, and because of that you
have also

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:18.640
a part of the bone that has died, because of

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:23.080
the pressure on that not biomechanically normal

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:26.570
hip. Whatever you do: infiltrations,

00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:29.810
physiotherapy, nothing will help you
anymore

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:33.300
today. The only thing you can do, is a total

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:37.970
hip replacement. "Why the surgery will be performed in a private Center

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:42.759
rather than in a public one?". I think it's
very important to you,

00:01:42.759 --> 00:01:46.600
for you, to find a place with

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.829
big experience in difficult cases

00:01:49.829 --> 00:01:53.270
where you can be treated, so the problem is

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:58.570
you need an excellent center where you
can treat your pathology

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:02.280
I think it's very important like

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:06.780
Dr. Calistri said: its experience!

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.349
With you, you have a congenital disease,
you have small

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:14.410
bones, you have different biomechanics

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:18.860
you have in the mean time also Displasia, because of your condition.

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:24.019
So, you need a small prosthesis, the biomechanics are completely different

00:02:24.019 --> 00:02:29.560
so you are a very special case! So you
need somebody who has experience

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.799
not only with hip but with very special
cases.

00:02:32.799 --> 00:02:36.599
The thing is to find somebody like this

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:39.599
often that one person

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:43.079
will find him more in a private setting,
than

00:02:43.079 --> 00:02:46.829
in a public setting or university
hospital where they just do standard

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:49.900
 prosthesis. Okay, "What are the risks

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:54.819
if the surgery would not be carried out
in time?" Well

00:02:54.819 --> 00:02:59.440
for you the main thing is that one: pain
will increase,

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.700
functional impairment will increase, that
means that you have no

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:07.099
quality of life anymore, what is already

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:10.480
the case today, it will just become worse

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:14.079
and worse! So, like now you are now thirty years

00:03:14.079 --> 00:03:17.180
and you will become a man of

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:21.549
sixty or seventy, which you aren't. So, that's why you

00:03:21.549 --> 00:03:25.190
really need the surgery. I think there is also  problem for bone stock.

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:29.220
Yeah, of course your main

00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:33.650
something that interests you it's to
conserve your bone.

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:37.389
Your bone! So, as long we go further

00:03:37.389 --> 00:03:42.859
much more you lose your bone stock. So it's time! It's very important you are young

00:03:42.859 --> 00:03:46.079
so we have to keep the bone as much as possible

00:03:46.079 --> 00:03:49.620
do you need surgery...in time!

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:52.840
Not in two years, not in one year. I
think if

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:57.280
 you looks the X-rays now, with the bone as you have, and we see the function of

00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:03.079
the hip is very bad. I think you need something to be done.

00:04:03.079 --> 00:04:08.139
"Why it's better if I do it here, rather
than the normal hospital?"

00:04:08.139 --> 00:04:11.160
Well, you have to look to

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:14.509
experience, I think this is very important

00:04:14.509 --> 00:04:19.449
when you look to case like yours and if
you look to standard case

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:23.210
even for standard total hip replacement
we know

00:04:23.210 --> 00:04:27.199
if you have a lot of experience, you have
less risk

00:04:27.199 --> 00:04:31.440
of complications, already with the
standard case.

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:35.190
If you do 200 hips a year, the chance

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:39.250
for you, to have revision, to have it
redone

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:42.850
to have complications is three times
higher

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:47.190
when you do in a normal hospital. If you
have a Center with

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:50.470
clinical excellence, you have three times
less

00:04:50.470 --> 00:04:53.970
to have complications and it's not only
complications

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:57.660
it's the outcome. You are a very special case

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:02.500
and you need a normal hip for once in
your life. You need

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:05.889
to be normal, a normal person to be able
to do

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:09.509
everything, like somebody of thirty years
of age.

00:05:09.509 --> 00:05:13.430
So, its not only complications. You
should be

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:16.759
a normal patient, afterwards

00:05:16.759 --> 00:05:19.819
with a normal hip, with a normal

00:05:19.819 --> 00:05:23.819
outcome. No crutches, not limping

00:05:23.819 --> 00:05:27.069
no pains, so you can do everything..again

00:05:27.069 --> 00:05:30.150
and for that you need experience

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:34.420
and a Center of excellence

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:36.539
Professors

00:05:36.539 --> 00:05:41.160
De Smet and Calistri, I hope to see
you soon and thank you for this

00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:42.000
interview

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.500
and take care! (Smile)

00:05:45.500 --> 00:05:48.590
Thank you Ahmed, "Arrivederci"!

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:48.840
"Ciao!"
