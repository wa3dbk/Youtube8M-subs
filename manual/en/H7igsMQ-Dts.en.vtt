00:00:01.201 --> 00:00:03.970
(buzzing sounds)

00:00:05.338 --> 00:00:06.740 align:start size:94% position:6%
- I've been really
enjoying being on the road

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:08.274
ever since the roast.

00:00:08.274 --> 00:00:11.778
I've been on the road
for years, but people

00:00:11.778 --> 00:00:15.115 line:0%
had no idea who I was, but
they'd see a picture of me,

00:00:15.115 --> 00:00:16.316 line:0%
and they'd be like,
oh she looks sweet.

00:00:16.316 --> 00:00:19.119 align:start size:84% position:16% line:0%
She kinda looks like
Amish, you know.

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:22.188 line:0%
Like, kind of cabbage
patchy up top, right?

00:00:22.188 --> 00:00:25.925 line:0%
We should bring the family, I
bet she talks about shopping.

00:00:25.925 --> 00:00:28.261
And then they get here,
and I'm like, my pussy.

00:00:28.261 --> 00:00:31.264
(audience laughing)

00:00:34.334 --> 00:00:36.636 align:start size:97% position:3%
But it's way better now
because like a lot of people

00:00:36.636 --> 00:00:40.006
saw that roast, and they were
like, oh she's a bad person,

00:00:40.006 --> 00:00:41.674 align:start size:84% position:16%
so that means you guys
are dirtbags, too,

00:00:41.674 --> 00:00:44.511
and I appreciate you coming out.

00:00:44.511 --> 00:00:45.979
(crowd applauding and cheering)

00:00:45.979 --> 00:00:47.714
You are bad people.

00:00:47.714 --> 00:00:49.916
(crowd whistles)

00:00:49.916 --> 00:00:51.751
Thank you, bad people.

00:00:53.019 --> 00:00:54.554
But I've been really lucky.

00:00:54.554 --> 00:00:57.290
Like my whole life, I've
found friends just like me.

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:59.559 align:start size:97% position:3%
At a young age, I found
girls that were just like me.

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:01.094
We were all whores.

00:01:02.262 --> 00:01:04.731 align:start size:81% position:19%
Just little drunks
running around.

00:01:04.731 --> 00:01:07.467 align:start position:0%
But in every group of girl
friends, there's always like one

00:01:07.467 --> 00:01:09.636
who's the sluttiest, ya know.

00:01:09.636 --> 00:01:11.671 align:start size:97% position:3%
If you don't have that
friend, you're that friend.

00:01:11.671 --> 00:01:13.573
Let's be real.

00:01:13.573 --> 00:01:15.308
(audience laughing loudly)

00:01:15.308 --> 00:01:17.744 align:start size:94% position:6%
And it wasn't me in my
group of friends, shocker.

00:01:17.744 --> 00:01:19.079
Was my nickname.

00:01:20.013 --> 00:01:23.616
(audience laughing loudly)

00:01:25.752 --> 00:01:28.254 align:start size:97% position:3%
But no in my group of
friends, the sluttiest of us

00:01:28.254 --> 00:01:30.857
was this girl Katie, and we
didn't judge her for that,

00:01:30.857 --> 00:01:32.692
but she wouldn't own it.

00:01:32.692 --> 00:01:34.861 align:start size:97% position:3%
Like as she would have a
boyfriend, she'd start acting

00:01:34.861 --> 00:01:36.863
like Mother Theresa.

00:01:36.863 --> 00:01:39.432 align:start position:0%
You know, she'd walk different,
she'd talk differently.

00:01:39.432 --> 00:01:42.001
I remember one time she walked
over with her new boyfriend.

00:01:42.001 --> 00:01:44.404
She was like Adam and I are
thrilled you can join us

00:01:44.404 --> 00:01:45.305
for brunch.

00:01:47.707 --> 00:01:50.844
I was like, I helped you
get cum out of your hair.

00:01:50.844 --> 00:01:54.447
(audience laughing loudly)

00:01:55.715 --> 00:01:57.550
Remember we tried
using peanut butter

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:00.787
because we're stupid, remember?

00:02:00.787 --> 00:02:02.422
(audience laughing loudly)

00:02:02.422 --> 00:02:05.992
We can talk about that
at brunch with Adam.
