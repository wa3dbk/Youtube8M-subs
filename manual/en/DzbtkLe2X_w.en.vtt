00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.780
Today I will be making garam masala.

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:21.720
This is a very aromatic spice mix.

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:29.540
Garam means hot and masala is mix of spices.

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:38.060
This is very pungent but not hot as chilli powder.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.900
Itâ€™s sparely used.

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:48.260
Garam masala is very popular in North Indian dishes.

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.520
This is my mother's recipe.

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:59.940
This recipe will make about 5 oz of garam masala.

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:03.560
For this recipe we will need:

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:08.380
1/3 cup cumin seeds (jeera), 40 grams.

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:15.000
2.5 tablespoons black pepper (kali mirch), 20 grams.

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:21.620
1/4 cup whole black cardamom (kali elaichi), 20 grams.

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:28.560
2.5 tablespoons of cinnamon powder (dalchini),
20 grams.

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:34.300
1/4 cup of cloves (long), 20 grams.

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:39.060
2 teaspoons of mace (javitri), 8 grams.

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:44.040
2 teaspoons nutmeg (jaiphal), 8 grams.

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:49.940
1 cup packed bay leaves (tejpat), 20 grams.

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.080
This is very simple recipe.

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:56.970
We are going to grind all the spices together

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:00.370
which will take 2-3 minutes.

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:05.600
And then store it in airtight container and use it as needed.

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:10.140
So first I am going to put the bay leaves.

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.970
Cloves

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.000
Cumin seeds

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.280
And black cardamom.

00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:26.800
Mix it.

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.480
Every 30 seconds, you stop to check

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:40.340
that how much grinding you have to do.

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.240
And all the spices settled down.

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:47.080
And at this time add the remaining spices.

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:48.800
Black pepper

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:51.860
Cinnamon

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:55.360
Nutmeg

00:02:57.700 --> 00:02:58.700
And maze.

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:02.280
Grind it again.

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:09.200
So stop again after about 30 seconds

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:12.080
and then mix everything together.

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:15.480
And grind it.

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:25.470
You will have to stop and go few times

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:29.450
and keep mixing till it comes to a powder form.

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:43.840
This looks ready.

00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:46.620
It took me about 2 minutes.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.140
So now I am going to put that in glass jar.

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:05.600
Garam masala is very aromatics spice mix.

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:10.040
This can be stored for few months in airtight container.

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:13.020
I like to store in glass jar.

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:17.240
All the spices that are used in garam masala

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:19.880
are very strong in flavor.

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:26.940
By adding little garam masala to the dish towards the end

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:30.520
gives the extra flavor and aroma.

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:35.460
And brings the taste to the different level.

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:41.320
I like to use garam masala in chickpeas, cholay dishes,

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:45.920
paneer dishes and aloo gobi.

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:47.410
Enjoy.

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:48.729
Thank you.

00:04:48.999 --> 00:04:54.839
