JENNIFER CROW: Hi, this is Jennifer and I'm
the owner of wedgiewear.com, and we're here

00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:09.280
with Expert Village. And then you pretty much
just want to finish one thing at a time. That's

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:14.219
why we're not going to finish this up first;
we're going to go on to the next one and do

00:00:14.219 --> 00:00:49.920
that one. So again, you're just going to start
feeding it through. And again, if you're using

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.680
elastic, you need to make sure--your tension
is pretty much trial and error. You don't

00:00:54.680 --> 00:01:00.550
want to start off just starting sewing. You
want to maybe get some leftover material that

00:01:00.550 --> 00:01:07.040
you have and kind of test it out first to
see what type of tension in everything that

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:13.200
you have, which would make this gather a lot
more. Right here, we just have a minimal gather,

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:56.420
which is what you want. I'm going to cut them.
Okay. Now that you have the elastic part done,

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:05.360
you're going to want to do the second step
of it. In this one, we're just gonna--you

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:10.549
can use a different fabric if you want or
you can just keep this one and pretty much

00:02:10.549 --> 00:02:16.780
just turn it over, and then we're just going
to sew directly on top of the elastic again

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:21.859
to give it a nice edge. And so with that,
what you can do is change out your needle

00:02:21.859 --> 00:02:26.909
and your foot, and you can go from there.
It's a lot easier if you do have another sewing

00:02:26.909 --> 00:02:29.140
machine. This time would be a good part to
use that.
