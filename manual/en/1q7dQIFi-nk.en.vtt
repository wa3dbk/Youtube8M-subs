I’m Tracy Tenner with Better Behavior Dog
Training at Extra Care Animal Hospital in

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:23.550
Davie, Florida. I am here today on behalf
of Expert Village.com at the Tri County Humane

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:28.919
Society in Boca Raton, Florida, where I have
volunteered as a trainer and a behaviorist.

00:00:28.919 --> 00:00:32.719
We are here today to help you learn how to
pick the perfect pet for you and your family.

00:00:32.719 --> 00:00:37.140
So if you are ready, let’s get started.
One of the first things to consider as you

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.989
are narrowing your choices is whether you
want an adorable puppy like this one or whether

00:00:41.989 --> 00:00:47.510
you would rather have an older dog. As you
can see there is nothing cuter than a puppy.

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:53.859
They are a lot of fun. There are cute as a
button; they will ensure many many years of

00:00:53.859 --> 00:00:59.949
laughter and love and fun in your family.
These are all the upsides to puppies. How

00:00:59.949 --> 00:01:06.220
could anyone possibly resist this face? On
the other hand, we have to consider our time

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:11.970
frame as well. If you and your family work
full-time and the kids are in school full-time

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:17.610
and nobody is home during the day, a puppy
would really not be my first choice. Puppies

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:23.570
require an awful lot of time to learn everything
there is they have to learn. Puppies have

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:28.859
to be potty trained. You have to teach them
where to go potty and where not to go potty.

00:01:28.859 --> 00:01:32.640
They have to learn what they are allowed to
chew and what they are not allowed to chew.

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:38.310
They are just brand new babies with no knowledge
of the world whatsoever, so we have to have

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:43.969
both the time and the patience and the love
in our hearts to bring a puppy into our family

00:01:43.969 --> 00:01:49.049
and do a good job of it. Remember, we are
here at the animal shelter to select the right

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:54.439
pet for you and your family, but you also
have a huge responsibility to the pet as well.

00:01:54.439 --> 00:01:59.280
It is important for your family that you select
the right one, but it is equally important

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:04.579
to that pet because this is a lifetime commitment
on the part of this little puppy right here.

00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:10.110
We do it properly, we do it with knowledge
and we choose the right age dog. If we are

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:15.300
not home all day, perhaps it would be wiser
to go with a slightly older dog that already

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:20.590
knows what to do and what not to do and won’t
require quite as much time on our part and

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:25.660
training. If you would like to learn more
