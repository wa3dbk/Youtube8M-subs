00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:12.950
Motorola Moto G.

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:15.370
Available Q4 2013.

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:19.610
We haven't seen much in the way of new announcements
from Motorola recently except for the Moto

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:24.200
X which is a US-only device, and in fact it
has been over a year since the announcement

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:30.070
RAZR i which was designed for European markets.
So, Motorola fans will be relieved to see

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:35.180
the new mid-range Motorola Moto G which is
designed to pack as many features as possible

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:40.420
into a device with a relatively modest price.

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:47.910
On the front is a 4.5" 720 x 1280 pixel display
with a 1.3 megapixel video calling camera,

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:53.780
on the back is a 5 megapixel camera with LED
flash and 720p video capture. Inside is a

00:00:53.780 --> 00:01:01.070
quad-core 1.2GHz CPU with either 8GB or 16GB
of internal storage but there is no mention

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:08.100
of a microSD slot. The Moto G also has an
FM radio.

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:14.240
This is an Android 4.3 device with an upgrade
to Android 4.4 promised early next year. In

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.490
the past Motorola have been pretty poor at
providing timely updates to their phones,

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:22.740
but hopefully this will change now that the
company is more firmly under the control of

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:28.750
Google. Motorola also indicate that the Moto
G will be unencumbered by add-ons skins and

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:35.700
other cruft and should offer a pretty pure
Android experience.

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:41.560
Motorola are selling this device on price
- in the US the basic 8GB version will be

00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:51.090
just $179 SIM-free (about Â£135 in the UK)
or $199 for the 16GB version. Compare this

00:01:51.090 --> 00:02:00.960
with a whopping $549 for a 16GB SIM-free iPhone
5C and $450 for an 8GB iPhone 4S and you can

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:06.130
see that Motorola clearly offer a lot more
bang for the buck. In order to keep costs

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:10.259
down there is not a charger or a headset in
the box as standard, but it does come with

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:16.099
a USB cable, but you should be able to re-use
your existing USB charger and headsets instead.

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:23.279
There are 19 different customisation options
including interchangeable shells and covers

00:02:23.279 --> 00:02:27.579
in several different colours, although the
handset itself comes in black only at the

00:02:27.579 --> 00:02:33.989
moment. All the usual features are here including
GPS, GLONASS, WiFi and HSPA+, but there is

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:46.849
no LTE or NFC support. The Moto G measures
130 x 66 x 11.6mm and weighs 142 grams.

00:02:46.849 --> 00:02:51.230
Motorola say that the Moto G will ship to
Brazil and part of Europe this week, followed

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:57.019
by Latin America, Europe and parts of Asia
during Q4 and then the US, India, Middle East

00:02:57.019 --> 00:03:02.170
and other Asian markets from January onwards.
Motorola say that it should be available in

00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:08.239
30 countries on 60 networks from 2014.

00:03:08.239 --> 00:03:13.150
The Moto G certainly has some shortcomings,
mostly the lack of expandable memory and lack

00:03:13.150 --> 00:03:18.139
of full HD video recording, but it certainly
offers a lot of phone for the money and it

00:03:18.139 --> 00:03:23.439
may well be better than the Android in your
pocket right now. But the Moto X hasn't been

00:03:23.439 --> 00:03:27.849
the sales success that Motorola were hoping
for, so Motorola will be hoping that the Moto

00:03:27.849 --> 00:03:51.829
G will capture the public imagination rather
better.
