00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:07.260
Hi, I'm Debrah DeMirza, at Deluxe, a resale
clothing boutique, in Eugene, Oregon, and

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:12.940
today, I'm going to show you how to get a
perfect fit for your jeans. What you do first,

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:19.250
is start out by making sure you wash and shrink
your jeans, the way you would normally launder

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:25.679
them, and usually if you don't do that, and
cotton, you can get a couple of percent shrinkage.

00:00:25.679 --> 00:00:33.120
Usually it happens in the waist, and in the
length, so what I tell people, is get a pair

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.829
of jeans that fit well in the waist, because
if you start taking in the waist, there is

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:43.800
so much bulky fabric. For one thing, it's
very uncomfortable on your hips, so the best

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:49.840
thing to do, is get a nice fit on the waist,
and then you can take in the sides. The next

00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:55.859
thing you want to make sure of, is if it has
metal rivets by the pockets, you make sure

00:00:55.859 --> 00:01:00.920
this area fits well, too, because you don't
want to have to try to sew, over those metal

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:08.850
rivets, and most jeans will have a single
seam, so you don't have to undo a lot of stitching,

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:15.270
in order to take in your pant legs, so what
you'll need to do, is get a perfect fit on

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:21.140
any of the complicated areas, and then you
can narrow the legs if you want to, and what

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:28.020
you can do, is look at the jeans, by laying
them flat, and seeing where the line is. If

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:33.799
you have a pair of bells, they're going to
need to be taken in on both sides. If it's

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:38.649
just a straight leg, and you want to make
it narrower, then you can go ahead and start

00:01:38.649 --> 00:01:45.170
pinning them on yourself, right side out,
or inside out, and when you put them on right

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:51.240
side out, just pinch the sides, where you
wanted to take them in, and make sure that

00:01:51.240 --> 00:02:01.400
you've got your seam line at the fold, so
what you'll do, is make your pins gently angle

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:07.870
in from the natural one of your sewing, and
then take them in. I usually pin every couple

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:13.530
of inches, once I determine how much I want
to take them in, and then what you can do,

00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:19.970
whether they're inside out, or right side
out, is I take, you have to turn them inside

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:24.890
out to sew them, and so if I don't know where
my line is going to be, I take a piece of

00:02:24.890 --> 00:02:31.080
chalk, and you can go right over the pins,
with that piece of chalk, and it helps to

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:37.830
make a nice dark line. You can use contrasting
colors, so that when you start, you take the

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:45.460
pins out, and you turn them inside out. You
can use those lines, by again, pinching them

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:52.410
to where that chalk line is, and then you
can re-pin on the inside, where that line

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:57.240
is, and you can check it, by finding out where
your chalk line is, on the outside. Now, if

00:02:57.240 --> 00:03:03.330
you're going to put them on inside out, and
then pin them along your seam, you need to

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:08.410
make sure that you have, if you have one leg
that's fuller than the other, make sure that

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:13.440
you allow for the fullness, on the opposite
side, if it's inside out, because once you

00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:18.950
put them on right side out, it will flip to
the other side, and fit differently. Now,

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:30.500
when you get to the fold line, and you work
all the way down, or even just partially down

00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:34.550
the leg, depending if you want it just narrow,
and then you want to make them into bells,

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:40.720
you can do that. You just want to make sure
that if you're coming off of the edge of the

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:48.410
pant leg, that you do a river stitch, to lock
that stitch into place, so it doesn't open

00:03:48.410 --> 00:03:54.870
up, and that's how you would take in a pair
of jeans, to get that perfect fit. Usually,

00:03:54.870 --> 00:04:02.540
you only need to take in the outside, and
if there's a double stitched seam, it's usually

00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:06.510
on the inside leg, because they usually allow,
that you're going to take the seam in, on

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:12.400
the outside, so it's simpler than having to
undo the double stitching, and that's how

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.790
you get a perfect fit, on your jeans.
