00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:05.020
Hello everyone and welcome to this week's
game development log video diary! And this

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:08.200
week I've been finishing off the entity editor
and programming a

00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:12.059
parser to allow my game to read the entity
files that the editor creates.

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.800
So let's get straight into the updates that
I've made to the entity editor, and first

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.900
off I'm going to show you the finished particle
settings. I've now got these error

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:25.340
margins to work, allowing you to make the
particle settings slightly more random. Gravity

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:29.660
can now also be set to negative which makes
everything float up, and

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:34.700
the direction setting is now more useful because
I've added this diverge slider, which lets

00:00:34.700 --> 00:00:37.520
you choose the error margin for the direction,
giving you

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:43.050
some pretty nice cone effects. As well as
that you can now choose which particle atlas

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.390
you want to texture the particles. And finally
I added some settings

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:52.100
for particle targets which suck the particles
towards them like magnets.

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:58.829
So, I'll now open the tree entity and you
can see here that I've added a few more component

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.070
choices. The tree already has the particle
component here

00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:07.780
which is creating the falling leaves effect,
so let's now add a collision box component.

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:10.310
When you add a component now it removes it
from the list

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:16.780
of components, and you can also remove a component
if you want, which will put it back into the

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:18.880
list. But let's now choose some collision
objects for the

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:24.880
tree so that our player can collide with it
in game...and these are just obj files containing

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.610
the collision meshes that I made surrounding
the tree model

00:01:27.610 --> 00:01:33.070
in Blender. You can see the preview of the
collision boxes over here on the left, but

00:01:33.070 --> 00:01:36.659
this only shows up when you're in the collision
box tab, so it doesn't

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:41.950
get in your way when you're adding different
components. Finally there are these two sound

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:45.030
components; the sound emitter gives an entity
the ability to

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.570
emit sounds, while the sound looper uses the
sound emitter to play some random sounds on

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:54.540
loop. This means that the sound looper requires
the sound emitter,

00:01:54.540 --> 00:02:00.570
so if I try to add the sound looper it will
automatically add the sound emitter as well.

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:03.560
So in the sound looper there are first a couple
of options to decide

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:08.590
how long it waits between playing each sound,
and I'll just set these to 0 so that our sound

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:12.110
simply plays on loop. Then you can choose
any number of

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:16.360
possible sound effects for the sound looper
to choose from and it will just randomly choose

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:21.640
one sound effect from the list to play each
time. Finally, there's also an option

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:26.520
here to choose the range of the sound effect,
which determines how far away from the entity

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:32.450
the sound can be heard. So now we've got our
tree emitting

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:36.230
this lovely wind chimes sound effect.
So once you've finished creating an entity

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:40.760
you can save it, which will export it to a
folder like this, which contains all the information

00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:44.709
and necessary
resources that the entity uses. Then I can

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:50.030
simply move that folder into my game's resource
folder, and then I can use it in the game.

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:53.319
All I have to do is
to load the entity file, and then place it

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:58.209
wherever I want in the world. So I've put
a couple of trees at these positions in the

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:02.720
3D world, and now if we have
a look in the game, we can see these trees

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:08.310
that I just created in the entity editor rendering
nicely in game.

00:03:08.310 --> 00:03:12.200
So that is it for another week! Next week
I'm going to be working on something a little

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:17.630
less exciting which is an improved OBJ model
converter. Don't forget to follow me on twitter,

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:22.590
indie db and my new Facebook page to keep
in touch and to see what I'm working on during

00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:25.620
the week.
But yeah, thank you guys very much for watching

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:31.370
this video, do subscribe if you haven't already,
have a fantastic week, and I will see you

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:32.200
all, next time!
