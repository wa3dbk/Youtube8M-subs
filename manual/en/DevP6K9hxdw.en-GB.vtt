00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:59.899
For 2015 the ultra-fashionable Audi A1 supermini
has been refreshed, with equipment upgrades

00:00:59.899 --> 00:01:03.859
and even the option of Audi’s first three-cylinder
petrol engine.

00:01:03.859 --> 00:01:10.990
I know, you’re thinking it does look very
similar, and while its design hasn’t drastically

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:16.580
changed, it didn’t really need to. Instead,
Audi has improved kit levels to keep its demanding

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:22.430
customers happy, and improved the engine line-up
for lower running costs. The main visual change

00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:27.750
is the large single-frame grille that’s
become an Audi trademark.

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:32.640
The A1 boasts an interior the likes of which
hadn’t been seen in a supermini just a decade

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:38.140
ago, with the same level of quality you’ll
find in Audi’s larger models. Changes are

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:43.580
minimal, but there’s now more chrome detailing
and gloss black plastic, along with new upholstery

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:49.409
options. This being the five-door Sportback,
access to the rear seats is more than adequate,

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:53.490
and for more information on the boot check
out our 2014 review.

00:01:53.490 --> 00:02:00.840
There are three trim levels: SE, Sport and
S line, and alloy wheels, air-con and a 6.5-inch

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.570
display are all fitted as standard. Sport
models now get Audi Drive Select bringing

00:02:05.570 --> 00:02:10.219
different driving modes as well as preparation
for sat-nav via the SD card slot.

00:02:10.219 --> 00:02:16.099
Go for an S line like this one and Xenon headlamps
are now standard, along with LED surrounds

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:22.099
and rear lights, 17-inch alloy wheels, a sports
body kit and stiffer suspension. Across the

00:02:22.099 --> 00:02:27.549
range a Tech Pack is also offered bringing
in-car internet, a music interface and MMI-controlled

00:02:27.549 --> 00:02:33.579
sat-nav, as well as a Comfort pack, which
now adds an enhanced trip computer and auto

00:02:33.579 --> 00:02:39.450
main beam to the cruise control, auto lights
and wipers and rear parking sensors included

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:48.269
previously.
Take to the road and the biggest difference

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:54.189
is the steering, which is now an electric
set-up instead of hydraulic, saving fuel.

00:02:54.189 --> 00:02:58.650
Its weighting changes depending on your speed,
so it’s very light for parking and heavier

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:05.919
on the motorway. It’s still a little lacking
in feel though, so it won’t reward you quite

00:03:05.919 --> 00:03:09.810
like a hot hatch or even its rival, the MINI
hatch.

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:17.799
There’s plenty of grip, but it sadly just
lacks the grin factor. The seven-speed s tronic

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:22.450
automatic gearbox is impressive though, with
fast changes and it’s available across the

00:03:22.450 --> 00:03:31.309
range. Audi has made the suspension a touch
more supple, but we’d still recommend deselecting

00:03:31.309 --> 00:03:41.400
the S line setup and going for the softer
option instead, it’s much more comfortable.

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:48.459
Under the bonnet, there’s the option of
Audi’s first 3-clyinder petrol, a turbocharged

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:56.129
1.0-litre with 94bhp capable of returning
67.3mpg. This replaces the 1.2. Stick with

00:03:56.129 --> 00:04:01.909
petrol and there’s also a 1.4-litre TFSI
with power up to 123bhp and the 147bhp version

00:04:01.909 --> 00:04:08.930
we’re driving now. This engine boasts cylinder
on demand tech, shutting down two cylinders

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:18.670
when you don’t need them. Tax costs just
£30 annually and 58.9mpg is possible.

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:28.570
The 1.6-litre diesel now gets 114bhp with
economy up to 80mpg and no road tax thanks

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:40.260
to CO2 emissions of 92g/km.
Audi didn’t need to change the A1’s design,

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:44.260
so it has concentrated on bringing it even
more in line with its large models by updating

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.860
its technology instead. You now get more equipment
for your money and the A1 should cost less

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:52.590
to run, which is a win win in our books.
It might not be quite as exciting to drive

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:58.090
as it looks, but the A1 is still a great city
car which is equally at home on longer trips

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:05.640
and out in the countryside.
