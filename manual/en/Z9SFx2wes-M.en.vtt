Hi, I'm Linda.

00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:05.200
I created a company called Paint Along.

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.450
Check us out at paintalongnyc.com.

00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:14.200
We have really fun painting workshops in Nashville
and New York.

00:00:14.200 --> 00:00:18.200
When you buy your acrylic paints you may want
initially to spend some time just getting

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:24.119
to know how they work together, how they blend,
and how much paint takes to make a secondary

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:25.579
color.

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:31.679
The primary colors are Yellow, Red and Blue,
and you cant mix anything together and you've

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:34.870
got to start whit these.

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:40.360
So let's start whit the yellow, and what we
gonna do is mix yellow and red together and

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:41.579
that will give us some orange.

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:48.260
And I am just gona dip a little bit into the
yellow, and bringing it to the other wells,

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.989
and Im gona take a little bit of red, now
the red is usually a lot stronger than the

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:57.699
yellow, so I am just gona start whit a little
bit of red to make the orange, and those to

00:00:57.699 --> 00:01:01.760
colors together make me an orange shade.

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:11.180
I'll go ahead and put it right here, and lets
put a reference of red onto our canvas too.

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:16.870
So coming out around well take some of our
red and will put int into another well and

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:20.520
then i'm gona mix some blue into it, this
will make purple.

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.020
When you're mixing you're colors whatever
you're working on is far as your subject matter

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.640
just make sure that you mix enough paint so
that you can get trough your project without

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:33.790
having to remix, because sometimes the colors
come out differently when you start over again.

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:40.060
Here is my purple, and then we'll put a reference
of blue on here as well.

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:49.091
So i'm gona take a little bit of yellow and
put into the well here , and taking some of

00:01:49.091 --> 00:01:59.990
the blue and mixing it into the yellow, and
that gives us green!

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:07.300
So now we have formed our Primary colors Yellow
Red and Blue, and our secondary colors which

00:02:07.300 --> 00:02:09.400
are orange green and purple.

00:02:09.400 --> 00:02:11.220
And thats how you mix your paint!
