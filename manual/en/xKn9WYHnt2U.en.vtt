00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.704
- Hey guys, today I'm gonna share with you

00:00:01.704 --> 00:00:04.609
one of my favorite recipes
for a springtime brunch.

00:00:04.609 --> 00:00:07.210
It's my blueberry almond tea cake.

00:00:07.210 --> 00:00:09.831
I love this recipe because it is so light,

00:00:09.831 --> 00:00:12.777
so delicious, and so easy to put together.

00:00:12.777 --> 00:00:14.158
It also gives you one more reason

00:00:14.158 --> 00:00:15.987
to use your fluted tart pan.

00:00:15.987 --> 00:00:18.018
But if you don't have a
tart pan, not to worry,

00:00:18.018 --> 00:00:20.355
you can make this recipe
in a regular cake pan,

00:00:20.355 --> 00:00:23.220
a spring form pan, or even
turn them into muffins.

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:24.231
Let me show you how to make it.

00:00:24.662 --> 00:00:25.964
So the first thing we're gonna do is spray

00:00:25.964 --> 00:00:28.339
our tart pan lightly
with some baking spray.

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:30.676
I do like to go over it
with a pastry brush after

00:00:30.676 --> 00:00:32.504
just to make sure that
all of that baking spray

00:00:32.504 --> 00:00:34.536
is in all the nooks and crannies.

00:00:34.536 --> 00:00:36.263
Then you can set that aside.

00:00:36.263 --> 00:00:38.498
And then in a large
bowl we're going to add

00:00:38.498 --> 00:00:41.952
3/4's cup of melted unsalted butter,

00:00:41.952 --> 00:00:45.324
and a 1/4 cup of either
canola oil or vegetable oil.

00:00:45.324 --> 00:00:47.092
I do like to mix the two fats

00:00:47.092 --> 00:00:49.164
because the butter is
gonna give us great flavor,

00:00:49.164 --> 00:00:51.399
and then the pure fat
in the form of the oil

00:00:51.399 --> 00:00:53.548
is going to make this cake extra moist.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.779
And then you're also
gonna add a cup of sugar.

00:00:56.942 --> 00:00:58.303
And you can go ahead and whisk that up

00:00:58.303 --> 00:00:59.660
until it's nice and combined.

00:01:00.721 --> 00:01:02.870
And then we are going to add two eggs.

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:05.064
And you can whisk those up.

00:01:05.699 --> 00:01:06.979
And then for our almond flavor

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:09.092
we're going to add a teaspoon and a 1/2

00:01:09.092 --> 00:01:12.683
of pure almond extract
and a 1/4 cup of water.

00:01:13.259 --> 00:01:16.020
So you can combine all that
just until it's nice and mixed

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.092
and set that aside.

00:01:17.565 --> 00:01:19.250
Then in a smaller bowl
we're gonna whisk together

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:20.383
our dry ingredients.

00:01:20.936 --> 00:01:22.684
So you're gonna take a cup and a 1/2

00:01:22.684 --> 00:01:24.630
of regular all purpose flour,

00:01:25.427 --> 00:01:27.373
two teaspoons of baking powder,

00:01:27.906 --> 00:01:29.120
and a teaspoon of salt.

00:01:29.938 --> 00:01:31.207
Go ahead and just whisk that up.

00:01:31.207 --> 00:01:33.382
And then you're gonna
take your dry ingredients

00:01:33.382 --> 00:01:35.651
and slowly add it to your wet ingredients.

00:01:35.651 --> 00:01:37.661
I do like to use a wire whisk for this

00:01:37.661 --> 00:01:39.997
because I find you don't have
to actually mix it as much

00:01:39.997 --> 00:01:41.318
because you wanna be gentle

00:01:41.318 --> 00:01:43.289
so that you don't end
up with a tough cake.

00:01:43.289 --> 00:01:45.219
So go ahead and just add it in 1/3's,

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:46.616
combining all the while.

00:01:47.169 --> 00:01:50.542
And then we're gonna add six
ounces of fresh blueberries.

00:01:50.542 --> 00:01:52.431
You can go ahead and mix
those up with a spatula,

00:01:52.431 --> 00:01:54.057
just being gentle, making
sure that you don't

00:01:54.057 --> 00:01:56.104
smash your blueberries as you mix them in.

00:01:56.637 --> 00:01:58.323
And then we are going
to transfer this batter

00:01:58.323 --> 00:02:00.045
into our prepared tart pan.

00:02:00.634 --> 00:02:03.413
And then just go ahead and
smooth it out with the spatula.

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.948
Then we're gonna add a 1/4
cup of sliced raw almonds

00:02:07.948 --> 00:02:08.879
right on the top.

00:02:09.574 --> 00:02:10.713
And then the final thing I like to do

00:02:10.713 --> 00:02:12.967
is just take the cake pan,
shake it a little bit,

00:02:12.967 --> 00:02:13.858
and bang it on the counter,

00:02:13.858 --> 00:02:15.484
just to make sure that all of that batter

00:02:15.484 --> 00:02:17.106
is actually at the same level.

00:02:17.842 --> 00:02:21.238
And then we are going to
pop it in a 350 degree oven.

00:02:21.238 --> 00:02:22.478
You'll know that the cake is done

00:02:22.478 --> 00:02:24.306
when it's nice and golden brown on the top

00:02:24.306 --> 00:02:25.988
and that a toothpick comes out clean.

00:02:26.866 --> 00:02:28.979
Then go ahead and allow your cake to cool.

00:02:28.979 --> 00:02:31.519
This cake is actually
best at room temperature.

00:02:31.519 --> 00:02:32.819
And it's also gonna make it easier

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:34.749
to get that cake out of the tart pan

00:02:34.749 --> 00:02:36.025
when it's nice and cool.

00:02:36.498 --> 00:02:37.981
And then we're gonna dust the whole thing

00:02:37.981 --> 00:02:40.072
with some powdered sugar.

00:02:40.072 --> 00:02:42.146
And you'll see how beautiful this cake

00:02:42.146 --> 00:02:43.445
that's so simple to put together

00:02:43.445 --> 00:02:44.887
turns out to be.

00:02:44.887 --> 00:02:46.980
It's perfect for a celebratory brunch,

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:48.727
either for Easter that's coming up

00:02:48.727 --> 00:02:51.125
or for Mother's Day,
bridal shower, baby shower,

00:02:51.125 --> 00:02:53.075
any of those types of
springtime occasions,

00:02:53.075 --> 00:02:54.986
this would be perfect for.

00:02:54.986 --> 00:02:56.855
And then you can go ahead and
serve it with your favorite

00:02:56.855 --> 00:02:58.987
tea or coffee.

00:02:58.987 --> 00:03:00.877
It really is such a simple recipe

00:03:00.877 --> 00:03:02.503
that just impresses a crowd

00:03:02.503 --> 00:03:04.454
because it looks so fancy and elegant

00:03:04.454 --> 00:03:07.277
when it really took you hardly
any time to put together.

00:03:07.277 --> 00:03:08.294
And when you cut into this cake

00:03:08.294 --> 00:03:11.301
you will see how light and
delicate the texture is.

00:03:11.301 --> 00:03:13.474
And you have those
beautiful fresh blueberries

00:03:13.474 --> 00:03:15.322
mingling with that almond extract.

00:03:15.322 --> 00:03:17.882
It's such a winning flavor combination.

00:03:17.882 --> 00:03:19.833
I hope you guys give this one a try

00:03:19.833 --> 00:03:21.153
and let me know what you think.

00:03:21.153 --> 00:03:22.779
And I also hope that you subscribe

00:03:22.779 --> 00:03:24.425
for more quick and easy recipes.

00:03:24.425 --> 00:03:26.598
And I will see you back here
next week for another one.

00:03:26.598 --> 00:03:27.652
Until then, bye.

00:03:27.652 --> 00:03:32.652
