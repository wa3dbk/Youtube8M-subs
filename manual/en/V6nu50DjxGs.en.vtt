00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:03.800
this is going to be a crochet bracelet
made with pony beads

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:08.090
if you're making this for someone else
please share something special about the

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:09.620
person you're making it for

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:14.660
I'm using four ply yarn
i am gong to start by attaching a slip knot

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:18.340
to the crochet hook, i'm going to work

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:23.789
chain 3 I'm going to leave this loop

00:00:23.789 --> 00:00:28.769
on insert my hook through the next chain yarn
over pull through

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:32.899
hook through the next chain yarn over pull through
pull through

00:00:32.899 --> 00:00:38.000
there are three loops on the hook what
we're going to do is work a chain

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.690
on each of these loops now this is where

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:45.590
it gets a little tricky you're going to
pull off these loops

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:49.180
wrap the yarn over pull through this
chain

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:52.600
insert your hook through the next chain

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.969
yarn over pull through hook through the
next chain

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.660
yarn over pull through just like
that this is what it looks like on the

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:07.460
back drop the two loops

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:12.340
yarn over

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:16.720
pull through

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:23.420
put your hook to the next stitch

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:30.420
yarn over pull through

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:36.370
hook through the next stitch

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:38.320
yarn over pull through

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:43.840
drop the two loops

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:50.840
yarn over pull through

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:59.210
put your hook through the next loop

00:02:02.870 --> 00:02:09.870
yarn over pull through

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:12.520
put your hook for the last loop

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:19.520
pull through

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:23.319
and this is how you will work

00:02:23.319 --> 00:02:28.040
a smaller thread and I am going to drop
these two loops

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.269
yarn over pull through put your hook
through the next loop yarn over pull

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:32.939
through

00:02:32.939 --> 00:02:36.170
yarn over pull through

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:39.450
hook  through the next loop yarn over
pull through

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:43.829
we have three loops on the hook drop the
two off

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:46.989
yarn over pull through

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:51.519
hook to the next loop yarn over pull
through

00:02:51.519 --> 00:02:55.889
hook through the next loop yarn over pull
through and really what we're doing is

00:02:55.889 --> 00:02:56.760
just making

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:02.159
a chain 1 in each loop dropping off the
last two loops

00:03:02.159 --> 00:03:05.659
chain 1, chain 1, chain 1

00:03:05.659 --> 00:03:10.870
and this is what it looks like on the
back and it's just completely closed up

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:15.169
I made it two sizes longer and i'm using

00:03:15.169 --> 00:03:20.250
pony beads, this time you don't have to crochet the pony beads

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:23.599
what I'm doing, i am attaching the beads

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:27.239
over the tail and then pulling them up
like this

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:32.720
they go right over the cord you can put
them as close together

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:36.209
or as far apart, once you get it complete

00:03:36.209 --> 00:03:43.209
and tied together you can rearrange your
placement

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:50.850
just slipping on the outside

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:57.470
just like that i am going to go ahead and
pull the yarn through

00:03:57.470 --> 00:04:01.590
I want to cut it  but I don't want my strands

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:08.590
to unravel, so I'm going to put this on
through like that

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:11.720
we can still see are three strands right
here

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:17.700
I'm going to thread my, needle i'm going to
match it up

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:22.670
this end and move this tail out of the way

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:29.670
sew right through the loop

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:33.400
like that, then catch

00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:40.400
the middle loop

00:04:40.979 --> 00:04:47.979
and then catch the last loop I'm going
to make a knot

00:04:54.139 --> 00:04:57.129
and a second knot

00:04:57.129 --> 00:05:01.340
tails onto my needle

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:05.620
a few pony beads on the outside of the
tail like that

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:12.620
some different colors

00:05:20.909 --> 00:05:23.610
one of my tails is a little shorter than the

00:05:23.610 --> 00:05:27.159
other ... I think that's pretty good

00:05:27.159 --> 00:05:31.939
I want to make sure they stay secure

00:05:31.939 --> 00:05:36.300
so I'm going to sew

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:40.460
around the outside back up in this
direction

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:45.669
like that, i am going to do the same thing with this one

00:05:45.669 --> 00:05:48.699
going around on the outside back up here

00:05:48.699 --> 00:05:51.879
i'm going to go through a little bit

00:05:51.879 --> 00:05:55.360
of the main portion a bracelet

00:05:55.360 --> 00:06:02.360
pull it through like and I'm going to make a
knot

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:09.890
mine is kind of stiff you may wanna
make yours a looser

00:06:09.890 --> 00:06:12.940
and both my strands have pulled together

00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:17.960
the second

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:23.680
knot, now i am going to run this one

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:30.380
to the inside like that and cut it off
close right there

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:34.560
i am going to run this next one through beads
as well

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:37.990
then cut it off

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:42.780
now you can fold it in half and it fits just like that

00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:46.210
you can see I can shake it around on my hand

00:06:46.210 --> 00:06:50.120
and its not falling off, and its got a little

00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:54.150
tail thing right here, and thats where we joined it together

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:56.720
and then this is the other one
