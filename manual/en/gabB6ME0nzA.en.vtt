00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:33.270
Viewtiful Joe left us all wondering and asking
the same thing?

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.750
What does “viewtiful” mean exactly?

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:41.710
Well whatever it is, I’m sure it’s a fitting
adjective for Joe.

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:53.000
Part of the so-called Capcom 5, Viewtiful
Joe left a lasting impact on most who played

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.790
it with its incredibly addicting mix of beat
‘em up gameplay, super powers and love of

00:00:58.790 --> 00:00:59.790
movies.

00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:06.060
Joe was just a crazy movie fan whose girlfriend
Silvia got sucked into the movie itself and

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.150
he became viewtiful to rescue her.

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:15.470
And now for the sequel not much has been changed,
simply going with the safe route of more awesome

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:23.640
viewtiful action.

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:29.780
An alien group has taken control of Movieland
and are out to capture the Rainbow Oscars.

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:36.090
Joe and Silvia now team up and become Viewtiful
Joe and Sexy Silvia to fight them and save

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:37.219
Movieland.

00:01:37.219 --> 00:01:38.250
Simple plot, yes.

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:43.259
But it works well with the lighthearted don’t
take things too seriously nature of the game.

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:47.369
Joe and Silvia will have to fight against
the aliens through multiple different movie

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:50.570
reels, each taking its name from famous movies.

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:57.130
There are titles like 10 Millions Years BC,
the Statue of Doom, and my favorite Do Androids

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:59.030
Dream of Romantic Scenes?

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:04.320
If the last one doesn’t make sense to you,
you need to brush up on your Philip K. Dick.

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:09.440
What the story allows is for the dynamic duo
to fight against Dinosaurs in tanks.

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.840
Again, this game does not take itself seriously.

00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.400
What it does take seriously is the gameplay.

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.360
It is the same as the first title in that
it is a beat ‘em up that is played in a

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:22.540
2D space, but with wonderful 3D graphics.

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:25.430
The graphics and gameplay go together very
well.

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:29.360
Joe is capable of all his powers to fight
against the enemies.

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:34.500
He can slow things down, speed up to a hyper
speed to will catch him on fire, or zoom in

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.430
for more focused attacks.

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:41.640
You will have to use each power appropriately
to deal with enemies and solve the puzzles.

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:43.670
But this time Joe is not alone.

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:47.170
Instead of playing damsel in distress, Silvia
joins in.

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:52.760
She has the same abilities but with some extras
that make her play better in some situations.

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:58.190
Along the way, you will collect score bonuses
and V points that be can spent to buy new

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:04.950
moves, health bonuses and powers.

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:08.980
Viewtiful Joe 2 is more and better Viewtiful
Joe and Sexy Silvia.

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:14.820
The gameplay hasn't seen any major changes,
with Silvia being fresh but surprisingly familiar.

00:03:14.820 --> 00:03:19.510
It is a great mix of fun gameplay, humor,
and great style.

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:29.440
Although I still don’t know what it means,
this game really is viewtiful.
