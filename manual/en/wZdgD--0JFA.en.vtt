00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:13.219
Earlier this afternoon,

00:00:13.219 --> 00:00:17.199
Board of Education met with the Delaware County Sheriff, District leadership and our 

00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:20.710
legal team to be updated on the unthinkable events

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:25.189
involving suspended teacher Matthew
Rosenberg.  We are fully

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:29.250
swiftly cooperating with law enforcement
to bring justice to the children

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.349
were victimized and will give the Sheriff
and the Prosecutor

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:36.640
whatever help they need to complete
their work.  In addition to seeking

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:37.460
justice,

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:40.519
they're also ensuring that affected
children and families

00:00:40.519 --> 00:00:44.289
get the care and support they need.  Additional counselors

00:00:44.289 --> 00:00:47.770
have been and will continue to be made
available as well as

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:51.309
access to tools and strategies on
having helpful

00:00:51.309 --> 00:00:56.480
and healing conversations with children. As members and parents of this community,

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:01.600
myself a father of four daughters, we
understand how upset

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.800
parents and community members are.  We all 

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:09.830
feel betrayed by his teacher.  Parents are
understandably looking for answers as to

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:10.830
how this happened

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:13.970
we are committed to helping find those
answers.

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:18.720
To that end, in addition to the criminal
investigation underway

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:21.990
I'll be asking the Superintendent to
move quickly

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:25.649
and initiate a termination process and
asking the Board 

00:01:25.649 --> 00:01:29.459
to complete a comprehensive independent
investigation

00:01:29.459 --> 00:01:33.429
of those events to find answers and
to help us move forward.

00:01:33.429 --> 00:01:37.709
We all know the measure of an organization is not whether it

00:01:37.709 --> 00:01:41.840
faces adversity or problems. The true measure

00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:46.039
is how the organization deals with those
problems.  We will act quickly

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:50.209
and thoroughly so that we can continue to
earn the confidence of parents 

00:01:50.209 --> 00:01:54.270
and the Olentangy community.  Sheriff Martin also has some comments.

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.640
the Delaware County Sheriff's Office wants to reassure the community

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:02.709
that we are with diligence and competency

00:02:02.709 --> 00:02:04.860
conducting a very thorough investigation

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:08.710
we went to the best of our ability, to

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:12.650
also reassure the community that we have
worked hand in hand

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:16.160
in a very cooperative manner with the
leadership team of

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.390
the Olentangy School District.  Please be
reminded that day in and day out

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:21.880
thousands of our students

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:25.640
are safely entering the halls of our school and being taught

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:29.000
by the most competent teachers and staff
available

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.990
Uh, if you suspect that perhaps one of
your children may have had a bad

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:33.990
experience

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:37.600
or been the victim of a crime. We were asking you to contact the Delaware County

00:02:37.600 --> 00:02:38.910
Sheriff's Department.

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:43.840
Please do not to attempt to conduct your
own interrogation or interviewer

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:44.910
investigation.

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:49.140
Rely on the professionals at the Delaware
County Sheriff's Office in collaboration

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:51.120
with the other agencies that we're
working with

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.870
to conduct that investigation.  So again,
please don't hesitate to call us if you

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:56.880
have any questions.

00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.160
Thank you, thank you.
