00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:08.680
[narrator] Every major airport is somehow unique. 

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:12.730
Many pilots even think that every airport runway has a unique personality.

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:14.590
And depending on weather and time of day, 

00:00:14.590 --> 00:00:16.320
that personality can change. 

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.020
On a sunny day, it's one way,

00:00:18.020 --> 00:00:20.020
and in a storm it's completely different. 

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:22.810
To help pilots adapt to all those runway personalities

00:00:22.810 --> 00:00:25.650
Boeing and Embraer have partnered in developing a program

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:29.000
based on a long-term strategy respecting pilot control.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.630
The program is called Runway Situation Awareness Tools. 

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:36.960
[Marisa Jenkins, Lead Engineer on Runway Situation Awareness Tools] Excursions are the leading cause

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.490
of aviation accidents in the past few years. 

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:43.010
An excursion occurs when an airplane departs the runway unexpectedly. 

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.660
That can happen off the side of the runway, so that's called a veer off. 

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:50.680
Or an overrun, which is when the airplane goes off the end of the runway.

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.780
[narrator] Boeing and Embraer are providing customers with a suite of 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:56.760
flight deck guiding and alerting tools along with training aides and procedures 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.300
for pilots to follow. 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:01.390
The idea is to help pilots plan well ahead for landings. 

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:03.700
They will be able to determine a runway's specific condition

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:06.070
in any weather, any time of day or night. 

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:08.100
Then, before planes approach the airport 

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:11.420
pilots can make timely and informed decisions about how to land. 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:13.680
[Jenkins] Pilots are trained wonderfully. 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:16.890
Aviation is the safest form of transportation,

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.110
but there are always conditions that pop up that are unexpected. 

00:01:20.110 --> 00:01:23.250
[narrator] One of the tools shows enhanced visuals on the heads-up display. 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.950
It includes approach planning, runway position planning,

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:27.990
and stability and landing guidance. 

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:30.970
[Jenkins] We had to be innovative because there isn't just one solution.

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:32.670
We need to include the pilots.

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:34.330
We need to include the regulators.

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:36.230
We need to include the engineers

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:38.840
to make the operating environment the safest possible. 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.340
[narrator] Ultimately, the pilot always retains responsibility and control of the airplane,

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.610
but if this set of tools can help pilots reduce airport excursions,

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:49.620
it's worth the effort Boeing and Embraer are putting into it. 

00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:51.430
[Jenkins] Collaboration is key.

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:55.250
We as flight deck engineers aim to give the pilots

00:01:55.250 --> 00:01:59.390
the most up-to-date, real information so that they can make their own decisions. 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:02.650
We want the pilot to be the first and last line of defense

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:05.440
in flying and landing an aircraft. 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:13.730
