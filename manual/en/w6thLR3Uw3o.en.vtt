00:00:11.150 --> 00:00:15.750
So far we have seen the geometric
construction that allows us to find the 

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:17.899
square roots of natural numbers

00:00:17.899 --> 00:00:20.069
but it was a recursive process

00:00:20.069 --> 00:00:24.289
that is to know the square root of a given natural number it was necessary to

00:00:24.289 --> 00:00:27.319
know the square root of the previous one.

00:00:27.319 --> 00:00:29.110
Now we're going to look at

00:00:29.110 --> 00:00:31.970
another construction which is more powerful and

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:33.650
direct as well

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:35.320
So it will allow us to find

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:36.650
in one step

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:37.970
the square root of

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:39.810
an arbitrary number

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:41.860
say 3.14

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:46.480
this is based on the geometric property
of similarity

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:48.100
Similarity in is nothing but

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:48.900
scaling

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:53.110
either scaling down or scaling up of a geometric figure. For example

00:00:53.110 --> 00:00:55.350
here we have a triangle

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.170
and we have scaled it up

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.470
by the factor say 1.5

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:01.949
and then once again

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:03.170
we are going to scale up

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.980
by the same factors to get this third triangle

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:11.760
Now if we take the corresponding lengths
of these three triangles - say these green

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:15.510
lengths: 16, 24 and 36

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:19.170
then they bear the same ratio

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.630
and therefore they are in

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:24.079
proportion. So to say 16:24

00:01:24.079 --> 00:01:26.080
is 24:36

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:27.560
16:24 = 24:36

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:31.770
such triplet of numbers is said to be in geometric progression

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:33.810
and the middle number

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.400
can be had

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.070
as the square root (as shown here)

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:42.679
of the product of the first and last
number. So 16 (the first number)

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:45.160
multiplied by 36 (the last number)

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:45.700
will give us

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.290
the squared of 24 (the middle number)

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:49.880
and that's the route

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.640
we can take to find square roots!

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:56.289
Now such triplets in geometric progression can be had

00:01:56.289 --> 00:01:58.590
using right angle triangles

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:00.060
so we will start with

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.640
this one over here

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:04.760
and we are going to rotate it

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:05.930
so that this

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:07.500
base of the triangle

00:02:07.500 --> 00:02:09.839
comes and aligns with the 

00:02:09.839 --> 00:02:11.069
height of it

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:12.560
Then we are going to scale

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:13.389
this copy

00:02:13.389 --> 00:02:15.339
that we just made

00:02:15.339 --> 00:02:19.319
about this point so that height of the copy

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:21.919
becomes the same as the original

00:02:21.919 --> 00:02:22.900
So now we have

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:26.200
two right angle triangles which are necessarily similar because they are just

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:28.709
rotated and scaled 

00:02:28.709 --> 00:02:31.709
and they have the same height

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:33.449
Now the base of 

00:02:33.449 --> 00:02:37.569
this triangle, then this height

00:02:37.569 --> 00:02:39.749
and the base of the original triangle

00:02:39.749 --> 00:02:40.749
will be

00:02:40.749 --> 00:02:43.829
in geometric progression

00:02:43.829 --> 00:02:47.009
Because this base upon height

00:02:47.009 --> 00:02:52.149
will bear the same ratio as this height upon this base

00:02:52.149 --> 00:02:55.309
and therefore the product of these two
bases

00:02:55.309 --> 00:02:58.919
will give us the square of this height

00:02:58.919 --> 00:03:02.359
Now how does that help us in finding the square root?

00:03:02.359 --> 00:03:04.319
imagine a situation where

00:03:04.319 --> 00:03:08.409
one of of these bases - say this one - is equal to unity

00:03:08.409 --> 00:03:10.969
and in that case, the height

00:03:10.969 --> 00:03:15.680
will be the square root of this base! 
Let's see how -

00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:20.180
Suppose we want to find the square root of say 3.14 So i will draw a 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:21.489
segment of 

00:03:21.489 --> 00:03:23.309
length 3.14 units

00:03:23.309 --> 00:03:26.299
then extended it with a co-linear segment of 

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:27.540
one unit

00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:28.320
these are

00:03:28.320 --> 00:03:29.919
the two bases

00:03:29.919 --> 00:03:30.940
one is unity

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:33.749
and one if a number whose square root we want to find

00:03:33.749 --> 00:03:35.729
Now we want to construct this 

00:03:35.729 --> 00:03:36.459
larger

00:03:36.459 --> 00:03:41.879
right angled triangle whose hypotenuse is this compound segment.

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:45.540
A quick way of constructing right angle triangles with given hypotenuse

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:48.349
is to use that hypotenuse as

00:03:48.349 --> 00:03:50.870
the diameter of a semi circle

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:55.199
because the included angle in a semi circle is ninety degrees

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:56.780
then from their junction

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:01.529
we'll be drawing this line which is going
to contain this height here

00:04:01.529 --> 00:04:02.889
and then trim it

00:04:02.889 --> 00:04:05.019
up to the circle

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:06.650
and we are actually done!

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:10.729
but just to make it look like our previous figure I'm going to construct

00:04:10.729 --> 00:04:12.329
these

00:04:12.329 --> 00:04:13.670
two lines

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:16.249
and under the circumstances

00:04:16.249 --> 00:04:19.459
we can get the square root of this red length

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:21.919
as this yellow length. Let's actually measure it

00:04:21.919 --> 00:04:22.590
this is

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:25.319
3.14 because we plotted it so

00:04:25.319 --> 00:04:26.199
while this

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:28.840
is 1.772

00:04:28.840 --> 00:04:32.800
this should be the square root. Let's check if it is indeed so

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:36.280
Punch in 1.7720

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:37.410
square of that

00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:40.039
is giving us 3.1399

00:04:40.039 --> 00:04:43.740
almost 3.14

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:48.569
So this is the way we can obtain square roots.
Now these three triangles that we constructed,

00:04:48.569 --> 00:04:52.029
have a strange connection with an
interesting

00:04:52.029 --> 00:04:53.300
ancient tool called the Arbelos

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:55.640
An Arbelos is

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:57.629
a cobbler's knife

00:04:57.629 --> 00:05:00.500
and if you look at its blade

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:03.639
you'd realize it is made up of three semi circles really. 

00:05:03.639 --> 00:05:05.939
So there is this large one

00:05:05.939 --> 00:05:06.870
and from which

00:05:06.870 --> 00:05:12.319
these two smaller semi-circles of half the size are subtracted

00:05:12.319 --> 00:05:16.310
When Archimedes saw this he was
absolutely fascinated

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:17.940
and he quickly did

00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:21.679
two things that mathematicians like to
do

00:05:21.679 --> 00:05:24.440
1. He generalized this shape

00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:28.800
by making these two smaller semicircles of unequal size

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:29.810
and

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:34.340
2. He started thinking about propertys of the shape

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:36.199
like its area

00:05:36.199 --> 00:05:42.539
Here the area is shown in blue and this
is how the Arbelos is related to the triangles

00:05:42.539 --> 00:05:44.519
that we have constructed

00:05:44.519 --> 00:05:46.560
Archimedes came up with

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:51.829
a very impressive statement. He said that if
you drawl a circle

00:05:51.829 --> 00:05:55.800
whose diameter is given by this height

00:05:55.800 --> 00:06:00.939
then the area of this circle is equal to the area of this Arbelos.

00:06:00.939 --> 00:06:02.559
Let's see how her proved that

00:06:02.559 --> 00:06:06.020
We've already seen that area of a geometric figure

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:09.759
is proportional to any of its linear dimensions

00:06:09.759 --> 00:06:14.050
so we can express the area of this larger semi-circle

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:18.569
in terms of its diameter (a + c) squared

00:06:18.569 --> 00:06:22.190
of course multiplied by some constant factor which will filter out because

00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:25.479
it's going to be there for all our expressions

00:06:25.479 --> 00:06:29.289
So this is the area of the larger semi-circle

00:06:29.289 --> 00:06:31.199
from it let us subtract this

00:06:31.199 --> 00:06:33.279
semi-circle of diameter (a)

00:06:33.279 --> 00:06:36.379
soI'll subtract (a) squared

00:06:36.379 --> 00:06:37.770
Then the second semi-circle

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:40.550
i'm going to subtract so a minus (c) squared

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:45.029
Now algebraically speaking this is the
expansion of

00:06:45.029 --> 00:06:47.649
binomial (a + c) squared

00:06:47.649 --> 00:06:50.580
So if you subtract a squared and c squared from that

00:06:50.580 --> 00:06:52.039
you'd be left with only

00:06:52.039 --> 00:06:54.839
2 x a.c

00:06:54.839 --> 00:06:56.439
this a x c

00:06:56.439 --> 00:06:58.639
is the product of these two

00:06:58.639 --> 00:06:59.339
bases

00:06:59.339 --> 00:07:02.060
which we are already shown to be the square of 

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:03.199
this height

00:07:03.199 --> 00:07:05.280
so this expression 2.a.c

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:08.709
will be equal to

00:07:08.709 --> 00:07:11.129
two b squared. And this b squared

00:07:11.129 --> 00:07:12.659
will be the area of 

00:07:12.659 --> 00:07:16.099
this green semi-circle because (b) is its diameter

00:07:16.099 --> 00:07:17.449
and there are two of them

00:07:17.449 --> 00:07:18.490
so that makes

00:07:18.490 --> 00:07:19.520
the whole of

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:20.960
this green circle

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:22.869
and thus Archimedes showed

00:07:22.869 --> 00:07:25.809
that the area of this Arbelos

00:07:25.809 --> 00:07:27.310
is equal to the area 

00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:29.240
of this circle

00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:30.550
This is called

00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:30.800
Archimedes's Lemma
