00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:08.890
You know, when you think Netbook, you usually
think Intel Atom Processor,

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:13.590
you think plastic enclosure, you think no
expansion possibilities, you think slightly 

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.950
low res screen, well I'll tell you what. HP is
taking a slightly different route on this thing,

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:24.090
with the HP Mini-Note 2133. This actually has
a VIA Processor in it, 

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:30.870
it has an 8.9 inch screen that runs at a very
high resolution. It's got a nice aluminum

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:35.720
 enclosure, and it's just overall a rather 
different beast on the Netbook market.

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:41.570
It's got the VIA C7-M, 1.2 gigahertz processor,
it's got a 'gig' of DDR2 RAM, 

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:44.920
and a 120 gigabyte hard drive. Comes with
XP Home, pre-installed. 

00:00:45.550 --> 00:00:54.760
This 8.9 inch LCD actually runs at a 1024 by 768
is the max resolution you can get out of this.

00:00:55.200 --> 00:01:00.160
So it's a much higher resolution screen, and 
you're actually able to watch 720p video,

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:06.460
at full resolution. It does have the VIA Chrome 9
graphics chip integrated onboard, 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.990
and it actually has an Express 54 slot too. So
you're actually going to be able to plug in

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:16.810
a 3G card. I'll show you that in a sec. It has
Gigabit LAN, it's got 'a', 'b' and 'g' wireless, 

00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:22.660
plus it also has Bluetooth. So it has a lot more
features than most of the Netbooks in the market.

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:28.760
Up here is the integrated webcam, on the HP
Mini 2133. You've got stereo speakers

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:34.780
integrated into the screen bezel, right here.
And then you have a nice sized keyboard here.

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:38.990
It's actually a rather.. The keys on this keyboard
are very large, very very 'typable', 

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:43.720
it's a really great keyboard on this particular
Notebook. You've got a button to disable 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.190
your trackpad located right here, as well as your
left and right track buttons on each side,

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:53.830
and a scroll zone, on that trackpad as well.
Up on the front you see 2 switches, 

00:01:54.280 --> 00:02:00.200
one over here for power, and one over here
for turning on and turning off your WiFi.

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:05.340
Over here on the side, you've got VGA, you've
got USB and you've got your headphone 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:09.290
and microphone ports, and then over on the 
other side, is where you're going to find

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:13.900
that Express 54 slot located right here. Which
is a huge feature on a Netbook. 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:18.870
It gives you the ability to throw in any sort
of expansion card and be able to go off with it.

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.850
I mean that's something you can't do with the...
Pretty much the vast majority of Netbooks

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:27.940
 on the market. You have an SD reader, right
underneath that Express 54 slot.

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:34.760
Over here you've got a USB and an Ethernet 
port, and that is Gigabit Ethernet onboard here,

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:39.230
and that's another thing that sets this one apart.
Most Netbooks have the standard 10100, 

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:43.670
this is Gigabit. And then your power port is
located right here.

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:48.640
But take a look at how nice this thing looks.
It is one of the most attractive,

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:54.970
Netbooks on the market. If I saw this Netbook's
picture on MySpace, I would immediately 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:58.760
send it a message. But not a creepy one,
 because you have start off really nice

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:02.890
when you're talking to people on MySpace, right?
So, this is a really good looking Netbook though.

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:09.030
It's got a really really cool color, it's very
very light, and it's, it's a little different than

00:03:09.230 --> 00:03:13.080
all the others, which is fun. Because in the
Netbook world most things are so similar, 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:16.140
this one's cool because it's a little bit
different than all the others on the market,

00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:22.460
and actually, probably one of my favorites
in terms of looks, the HP 2133.

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:31.150
To get more info on the HP Mini-Note 2133
go to any of these retailers and type in H24-8000.

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:33.190
