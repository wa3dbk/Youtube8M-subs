00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.630
What I want to do in this
video is show you a way

00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:06.540
of subtracting numbers that is
different than the regrouping

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:07.040
technique.

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:09.880
And this is closer to what
I actually do in my head.

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:12.060
And this might not be
what you see in school,

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:14.210
so be careful while
you're looking at this.

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:16.129
Some people might
not fully approve

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:17.610
of what I'm about to show you.

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:20.240
But the idea, the reason
why I'm showing you this

00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:22.750
is to understand that there's
not just one way to do things.

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:25.340
As long as you understand
the underlying principles,

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:27.200
what these numbers
represent, and you

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.645
do things that make
sense, you should be OK.

00:00:29.645 --> 00:00:31.215
And what's neat
about this technique

00:00:31.215 --> 00:00:32.590
is that we don't
have to regroup.

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:34.631
We're just going to start
with the hundreds place

00:00:34.631 --> 00:00:35.750
and keep on moving.

00:00:35.750 --> 00:00:38.440
So, for example,
if I think of 301,

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:39.990
I first want to subtract 100.

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:45.000
So 300 minus 100 is
going to get me to 200.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.095
Now I need to subtract 60.

00:00:47.095 --> 00:00:51.760
And so I can think about what
is 20-- two, zero-- minus 6.

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.910
So this is essentially
saying what is 200 minus 60?

00:00:54.910 --> 00:00:58.530
Well, 20 minus 6 is 14.

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.480
So I just subtract, and
now I'm left with 14.

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:06.350
And so now the problem has
resulted in 141 minus 9.

00:01:06.350 --> 00:01:09.012
So I really just have to
think about what-- well,

00:01:09.012 --> 00:01:11.580
or I could do what
141 minus 9 is.

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.287
Well, 141, it's a little
bit more mental computation

00:01:14.287 --> 00:01:15.370
than you might be used to.

00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:21.070
But 141 minus 9 is
going to be 132.

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:26.714
So we are left with 132.

00:01:26.714 --> 00:01:28.130
Let's do this one,
same technique.

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:29.755
And I encourage you
to pause the video

00:01:29.755 --> 00:01:32.130
and try it yourself,
this same technique.

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:35.630
Well, 9 minus 2, it's
really 900 minus 200.

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:37.550
You're going to
be left with 700.

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:43.550
Then 71 minus 8, let's
see, 11 minus 8 is 13.

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:48.025
So you're going to
be left with 63.

00:01:48.025 --> 00:01:51.700
And now we have to
subtract 633 minus 6.

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:55.270
13 minus 6 is 7.

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:58.870
So it's going be 627.

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:01.840
And once again, try to pause
the video and do it on your own.

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:04.890
So I don't have any hundreds to
subtract, so I can immediately

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.960
go to 72 minus 8, which
is really 720 minus 80.

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:11.750
But let's just think
in terms of 72 minus 8.

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:19.200
Well, 12 minus 8 is 4, so 72
minus 8 is going to be 64.

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.900
So now this is the same
thing as 641 minus 8.

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:28.250
Well, 41 minus 8
is going to be 33.

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:30.660
I have to do a little bit
of mental computation here.

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.470
So this will result in 633.
