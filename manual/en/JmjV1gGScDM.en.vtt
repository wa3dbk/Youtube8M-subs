00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:03.090
So in a nutshell

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:07.700
this is the problem with the Subaru, uh, level sender

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:11.030
Here's my

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:15.980
multimeter hooked up to the brand new one

00:00:15.980 --> 00:00:21.680
at the bottom of the range, empty, you read about 45 ohms

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:25.439
halfway, right around half that, 24 ish

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:29.600
and all the way at full reads pretty close to zero

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:34.390
like two or three ohms

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:37.600
And it's nice and it's, uh, monotonic

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.170
through its range so as it fills up

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:48.170
it only goes down and as it goes from full

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.250
to empty it slowly

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:55.739
and progressively goes up to forty five ish (50 ohms).

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:01.469
So let me just hook up the
multimeter

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:19.400
to the old one that just took out, and we'll see
what the problem is

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:21.120
so the old one

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:24.670
all hooked up to "mr multimeter"

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:29.100
bottom of the range it reads empty

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:36.020
halfway up it reads 35, three quarters of the way up

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:42.210
it reads twenty. You can just see as it moves
through the range

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.910
at full it reads about the same

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:52.910
6 ohms, rather than 4. But you see as I
slowly go down the range

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:59.050
(45), (170)

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:02.400
it like (sixty)

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:06.840
(287!). It just doesn't

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:12.230
smoothly, right, it doesn't smoothly go from

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:16.880
empty to full, the resistance gets stupidly
high

00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.260
part-way through because these

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.950
litle contacts that the float on this

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:27.970
variable resistor makes contact with

00:02:27.970 --> 00:02:31.070
(I don't know if you can see that

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:34.300
let's try focusing). So, these little contacts

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:37.500
get dirty from all the stuff in the
gasoline

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:40.540
and then the resistance

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:44.520
doesn't read with it's supposed to as it slowly
moves through the tank.

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:48.570
If you always keep the tank around half full

00:02:48.570 --> 00:02:52.850
(back and forth, back and forth) those
little contacts

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:56.100
Well, it's empty. It's over full

00:02:56.100 --> 00:03:00.010
it's just crazy sauce.  So I

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:04.030
cleaned these once already and the only
solution really seems to be to replace

00:03:04.030 --> 00:03:04.660
them.

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:07.690
Brand new little assembly nicely anodized

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:10.880
hopefully it'll last another

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:13.239
80,000 kilometers.
Ta ta!
