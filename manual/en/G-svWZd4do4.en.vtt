Hey guys, it's Ro, welcome to another Nerdy
Nummies!

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:18.099
Today we are going to be making something
that we've never made before: We are going

00:00:18.099 --> 00:00:19.820
to be making gummies!

00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:23.250
I learned how to make gummies when I was on
the set of "Feast Of Fiction".

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.149
Jimmy Wong and Ashley taught me how to make
Lego Gummies, it was so much fun.

00:00:27.149 --> 00:00:30.820
I'll put a link down below so you can check
out the video if you missed it!

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:35.430
The recipe was so good that I wanted to share
it with you all, so today I'm gonna be making

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:36.820
Bejeweled Gummies!

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:38.489
Let's get started!

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:44.690
The things you will need will be a big pot,
some unflavored gelatin, and we're gonna need

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:46.250
six Jell-O flavors.

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:51.470
You're gonna need Red, Orange, Yellow, Green,
Blue, Purple and then for the clear gems,

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:55.720
you're just gonna use the regular gelatin
and we'll have to add a little flavor.

00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.290
Anything that is a clear-flavoring will be
fine.

00:00:58.290 --> 00:00:59.840
I've got two options here. I

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:04.040
I've got "Cotton Candy" or "Pineapple", whatever
flavoring you'd like, we'll use that.

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:08.149
And then you're gonna need gem-molds, I
just found these at the store, but if you

00:01:08.149 --> 00:01:12.890
can't find them at the store, I'll put a link
down below so you can find it online.

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:14.180
Take a look at that!

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:15.820
They look just like the game!

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:22.220
You'll also need 1/2 a Cup measuring cup,
a baster, and a bunch of bowls to mix our Jell-O up!

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:24.000
Let's put it all together!

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.390
The first thing that you're gonna do is separate
all your different gem-gummy colors by Jell-O.

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:35.560
Everybody gets their own bowl so you have
a little Jell-O Packet and then 3 gelatins.

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:40.560
First we're gonna add our 3 packs of gelatin,
then we're gonna add our Jell-O Pack...

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.500
Then you're gonna take a spoon, mix it all
around...

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.920
Then you're gonna-ha-add 1/2 a Cup of water...

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.229
Eeeeuuuhh don't drop it, don't drop it, don't
drop it!

00:01:49.229 --> 00:01:50.949
Eeeewwwuh- I'm so buff, I'm so buff!

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:54.530
Then mix it around again!

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:58.590
After you've mixed up the red one, now you're
just gonna do this to all of your other colors,

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.689
and your clear one we're gonna do something
a little bit different, you're gonna add 6

00:02:02.689 --> 00:02:07.689
packs of gelatin, 1/2 a Cup of water and a
teaspoon or tablespoon if you want a LOT of

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:10.929
flavor of whatever little flavoring you'd
like!

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:12.670
I'm choosing "Cotton Candy"!

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:15.650
Now that we've got all of our Jell-O's mixed
up, they're nice and thick!

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:18.310
Even our little white, clear one- Look at
that!

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:22.620
Really thick, it should feel like mashed potatoes,
you're gonna get your pot, fill it with some

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:24.879
water and head over to the stove.

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:28.609
Fill your pot with about an inch and a half
of water and bring to a boil.

00:02:28.609 --> 00:02:33.349
Then, place the bowl of gelatin into the pot
and stir with a spoon until it dissolves.

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:34.680
'til it's all liquid!

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.379
When a layer of foam begins to spread across
the top, it is done!

00:02:38.379 --> 00:02:41.430
Remove the pot from the heat and grab your
baster.

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.049
You're gonna use the baster to transfer the
mix into your gem-molds.

00:02:45.049 --> 00:02:48.469
It's really, really handy 'cuz it's gonna
bypass all the foam on the top and you're

00:02:48.469 --> 00:02:50.859
gonna get that clear color from the bottom!

00:02:50.859 --> 00:02:55.329
Fill all your molds and pop them into the
freezer for about 15 minutes to set.

00:02:55.329 --> 00:02:59.040
Once your molds have set, you're just gonna
pop 'em out and they'll look like this.

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:00.169
Dew-doooooooo!

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:02.280
It's super easy, I'll show you how to do it.

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:04.290
So you have a mold just like that...

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:08.639
...they're very durable, but I always am a
little bit gentle, just take a corner...

00:03:08.639 --> 00:03:10.469
...and pull 'em out!

00:03:10.469 --> 00:03:12.379
A little Jell-O Jiggler!

00:03:12.379 --> 00:03:16.290
I'm putting these little gummies on a piece
of wax-paper because I'm gonna cut them to

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:19.090
be a closer shape to the actual game.

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:25.140
For little purple gummies, I'm gonna cut them
to look like a triangle, so I'm just gonna

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:27.879
cut off the top of the gem, perfect!

00:03:27.879 --> 00:03:32.829
Then for the green gummies, I'm gonna cut
each corner at a diagonal, just a little bit!

00:03:32.829 --> 00:03:36.099
Then I'm gonna do the same thing to these
little white ones.

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:37.079
Ta-daaaa!

00:03:37.079 --> 00:03:39.659
Here are The Bejeweled Jell-O Gummies that
we made!

00:03:39.659 --> 00:03:41.089
I hope you guys liked 'em!

00:03:41.089 --> 00:03:44.790
Again, I'll put the recipe down below- I learned
this from "Feast OF Fiction".

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:47.760
I had so much fun with them and I hope you
guys enjoy it!

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:51.829
