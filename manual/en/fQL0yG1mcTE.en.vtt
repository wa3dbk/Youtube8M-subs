Fishing with a Banana Rod
Hi again everyone, I'm down at the creek.

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:29.880
It is two days after I built a Banana Rod,
this is the same Banana! I got pretty close

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:42.150
last time, have a look at the link here.
Hopefully today, I will catch some fish. I

00:00:42.150 --> 00:01:01.180
am very persistent.
I am using a Zman grubz, in a 2 1/2 inch motor

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:12.679
oil.
This is my new type of cast, to get the lure

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:18.079
out.
It works alright.

00:01:21.440 --> 00:01:35.200
That was a tarpon, a bit too far out.

00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:56.000
Oh, that's a fish! Yes. Dropped him, that
was a Tarpon on the Banana!

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:06.880
Lets go again. Exciting.
The Banana

00:02:06.899 --> 00:02:11.059
is getting ripe and very soft.

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:24.620
Now I'm changing to the Squidgee soft plastic
lure.

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:32.340
Drop bear colour and 3" long.

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:44.880
Yep, oh, yep, twice that time.

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:57.840
They are starting to fire up.
Yep, oh that was one, yep, got him that time,

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:19.200
and dropped him again...
That was a hit, yep, another one, two, three

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:37.040
hits.
Oh Trapon, oh another one, had that one.

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:41.920
Come one, that was a hit.

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:08.160
Wow there is a big Barramundi, that was a
big Barra.

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:26.220
A couple of misses there.

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:37.470
This is the Banana from two days ago, it is
getting very ripe.

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:43.560
Now it's too dark, but I am back tomorrow.
with a new banana.

00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:26.720
There are Tarpon rolling out in front of me.
That's pretty good.

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:11.520
Flash, and a hit.
Oh, yes got one, and he is ON! He is staying

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.720
on! Woo Hoo!
I

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:29.840
got 
a fish on the Banana Rod, how cool 
is that!
Happy, Happy, ohhh!

00:06:29.879 --> 00:06:56.310
Check it out, the Banana Rod works, woo-hoo!
That is, that 
is about 30cm Tarpon.

00:06:56.310 --> 00:07:24.550
It took me 3 days, but I got a fish on 
the Banana rod.

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:51.860
Banana and Tarpon, woohoo!
