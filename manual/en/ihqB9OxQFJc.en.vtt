00:00:00.922 --> 00:00:05.948
A handling comparison of S2000 vs.
rivals under wet conditions on gymkhana.

00:00:09.383 --> 00:00:13.676
Course consists of slalom section which
continues with extended 80R corner, then

00:00:13.702 --> 00:00:18.782
comes an S corner with 270Â° turn.
Course ends with crank-shaped section.

00:00:19.334 --> 00:00:21.210
First the S2000.

00:00:21.945 --> 00:00:24.394
The clutch is a little bit slippery.

00:00:30.137 --> 00:00:31.950
It goes into 3rd gear here.

00:00:38.885 --> 00:00:42.466
Chassis stiffness is very good.
The brakes are awesome.

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:44.199
What about the engine.

00:00:45.171 --> 00:00:46.767
It feels very good.

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:53.338
It goes very fast.

00:00:54.347 --> 00:00:55.708
It's very fast here.

00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:00.956
The revs are a bit too low,
it's tough with just 6500 rpm.

00:01:04.116 --> 00:01:06.605
Time is 42.73 sec.

00:01:07.437 --> 00:01:11.144
I was surprised how good
the chassis stiffness is.

00:01:11.517 --> 00:01:16.397
Going through S-corner up to crank
corner feels very stable, even though

00:01:16.423 --> 00:01:20.875
it's a convertible car, it totally
doesn't feel like open roof car.

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:28.034
Brakes are very good.
Engine revs smoothly though.

00:01:28.945 --> 00:01:35.805
Engine doesn't quite fit to this course
profile, there's no torque below 6500 rpm.

00:01:36.283 --> 00:01:38.800
Even though it accelerated just fine.

00:01:38.935 --> 00:01:43.522
As a pro driver I have
no problem to drive in

00:01:43.548 --> 00:01:48.333
tight corners with this
car, it turns very well.

00:01:48.741 --> 00:01:52.482
Indeed, we can see a sharp
movement even from outside.

00:01:56.274 --> 00:01:59.353
Next is a fully equipped Silvia.

00:02:00.937 --> 00:02:02.291
It also goes into 3rd gear.

00:02:04.334 --> 00:02:11.102
I'm trying to avoid any counter steering
in order to get best time possible.

00:02:11.124 --> 00:02:12.757
Brakes are not that good.

00:02:13.656 --> 00:02:15.223
The rear is not stable.

00:02:16.464 --> 00:02:19.158
It's over steering a lot.

00:02:21.992 --> 00:02:25.806
It's pretty tough to drive a turbo car.

00:02:27.284 --> 00:02:31.378
Because the turbo kicks
in during cornering.

00:02:32.733 --> 00:02:35.397
It's more lazy-moving than S2000.

00:02:35.759 --> 00:02:37.954
It's 0.6 sec slower.

00:02:38.462 --> 00:02:39.618
How about Inte R?

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.985
It also goes into 3rd gear.

00:02:49.202 --> 00:02:52.086
I'm in 3rd gear though, can't step on it.

00:02:56.082 --> 00:03:02.133
A car with tendency to under steer makes it tough
in corners, similarly to over steering car.

00:03:02.398 --> 00:03:05.224
It's very hard to correct
any power-over-steer.

00:03:06.175 --> 00:03:08.828
The time is a little bit behind Silvia.

00:03:10.181 --> 00:03:14.195
One of the fastest domestic
cars, The RX-7, how will it go?

00:03:14.504 --> 00:03:16.091
This one goes into 2nd gear only.

00:03:17.186 --> 00:03:18.887
Not able to use 3rd gear.

00:03:19.073 --> 00:03:23.057
This one does it too, if you release
the throttle... oh, it doesn't stop.

00:03:23.057 --> 00:03:24.773
Brakes don't stop the car.

00:03:24.773 --> 00:03:26.059
It slips away.

00:03:27.126 --> 00:03:31.031
I'm not able to judge the braking
point very well with these brakes.

00:03:32.614 --> 00:03:34.803
The brakes make it under and over steer.

00:03:34.803 --> 00:03:38.019
ABS system is not very effective.

00:03:38.825 --> 00:03:42.000
I'd be far better with
cranked up ABS setting.

00:03:42.716 --> 00:03:45.539
Debut of NSX was 10 years ago.

00:03:47.352 --> 00:03:50.847
NSX is also not able to go into 3rd gear.

00:03:51.899 --> 00:03:53.123
It's the 2nd gear.

00:03:55.696 --> 00:03:57.873
2nd gear, 2nd gear here as well.

00:03:59.417 --> 00:04:00.165
It's tough.

00:04:04.438 --> 00:04:07.545
It goes forward with a wheel spin.

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:10.612
The steering feels very heavy.

00:04:11.009 --> 00:04:14.533
For nowadays standards it's heavy.

00:04:17.781 --> 00:04:19.948
NSX is not suitable for gymkhana.

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:28.427
The conclusion is, the S2000 is the
top car, with best time and feeling.

00:04:30.457 --> 00:04:32.427
It wasn't overwhelmingly
better though.

00:04:34.481 --> 00:04:42.909
The middle section of pylon layout was
better suited for turbo equipped Silvia.

00:04:43.379 --> 00:04:52.328
I think, the turbo equipped RX-7 also ran
very good sector time in middle section.

00:04:52.548 --> 00:04:56.351
The S2000 has a very good handling
and high chassis stiffness.

00:04:56.351 --> 00:05:01.313
Turning, stopping, it excels
in these kind of actions.

00:05:01.928 --> 00:05:05.397
It is a car created on very
high performance level.

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:10.227
I'm looking forward to
the race at Tsukuba.

00:05:13.433 --> 00:05:19.432
It's evident that the S2000 is capable
of pleasant steering performance.
