Hello, folks, Paul here with another shisha
tobacco rating for you.

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:38.520
This one is for Afzal Ginger Lemon.

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:40.930
I’m a huge fan of ginger flavors.

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:45.150
I drink ginger beer more than any other soda
- it’s pretty much the only soda that I

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:46.239
do drink.

00:00:46.239 --> 00:00:53.690
I eat candy ginger as a snack and this is
the most accurate, most tasty and most satisfying

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:55.489
ginger flavor I’ve ever found.

00:00:55.489 --> 00:01:06.101
The only other ginger flavor I can even think
of is the now discontinued Tangiers Ginger

00:01:06.101 --> 00:01:08.990
Beer, which was an absolute flop.

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:14.810
That tobacco was not good, it was best as
a mixer more than anything else and it didn’t

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:15.810
taste like ginger.

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.450
This, on the other hand, is a very accurate
ginger flavor with a nice light lemon in the

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:26.600
background and I think that if you are a ginger
fan, you need to absolutely pick this one

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:27.600
up.

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:32.170
If you’re not a huge fan of ginger, you
don’t love it nearly as much as I do, I

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:45.049
still suggest checking this one out because
it is just tasty.

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:47.200
As you can tell, the clouds are good.

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:53.979
I absolutely suggest picking up this flavor
and that’s definitely a positive review

00:01:53.979 --> 00:01:59.070
from me for Afzal Ginger Lemon, big thumbs
up.

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:03.899

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.660
