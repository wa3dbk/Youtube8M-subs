00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Plans don't win battles.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Astras don't win battles.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Even armies don't win battles.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
People win battles. 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
And if Duryodhana had realized this in timeâ€¦

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
I might not have been alive today.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
I'd thought my dearest friend Krishna would stay out of 
 the battle, or join our side on his own.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:07.000
And when I was told I would have 
 to seek his alliance, I was shocked.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
And when I learned Duryodhana was already on his 
 way to ask Krishna to join the Kurus...

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:19.000
I panicked.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000
I raced to Dwarka faster than the wind.

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.000
I'd never even imagined a day when I might have 
 to face my dearest friend across a battlefield.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000
But this war... 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.000
This was something else.

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000
I knew I would be facing my guru, my old 
 friends, and the warrior I respected above all.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000
But Krishna? Fighting Krishna? I could not imagine it.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000
I raced through the woods of Dwarka, imagining them burning.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Imagining that my own hands wielded the astras that set them ablaze. 

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
Could it come to this?
