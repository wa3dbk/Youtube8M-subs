00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:05.320
The East Coast-Ngati Porou
rugby team is the only

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:08.120
iwi-based team in the country.

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:13.400
It's been more than a decade
since the team played a final,

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:16.680
but that could all
change this weekend,

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.720
according to its supporters.

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.720
Some of East Coast rugby's
biggest fans.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.680
Yeah, it's in the bag.

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:34.280
These boys go to Ngata College
in Ruatorea.

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.920
They're doing what they love -
playing rugby.

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.000
But never mind the All Black jersey,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.320
these boys are chasing
the blue jersey.

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:48.040
They would play with us every day

00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:53.000
so that we could be as good as them.

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:07.720
Playing professionally is the goal.

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:10.640
Ngati Porou beat
Whanganui last year.

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:20.880
This is Whakarua Stadium.

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.560
On Saturday, it'll be full

00:01:23.560 --> 00:01:30.040
of Ngati Porou fans from back home
and from all over the country.

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:46.920
It's hoped that Ngati Porou takes
it out this year to make up

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:49.560
for the losses of the last 12 years.

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:03.760
Cheeky words - let's hope
they're also prophetic.

00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:05.760
Irena Smith, Te Karere.
