Now, this week's VEST MEDIA starts!

00:00:32.747 --> 00:00:35.119
Good evening! Welcome to this week's VEST MEDIA!

00:00:35.255 --> 00:00:37.276
I'm the MC, Ari Keita and...

00:00:37.397 --> 00:00:38.639
I'm Boo.

00:00:38.925 --> 00:00:41.428
Hope you enjoy tonight too!

00:00:41.483 --> 00:00:46.185
We'll rate videos by using "VEST Board" again!

00:00:46.723 --> 00:00:49.681
We'll review videos picked up from all over the world.

00:00:49.681 --> 00:00:53.883
By classifying in any buzzed 4 sections-

00:00:53.883 --> 00:00:56.437
-we can visualize the global rate of videos.

00:00:56.437 --> 00:00:58.591
That's what VEST Board stands for!!

00:00:58.591 --> 00:00:59.429
Indeed.

00:00:59.744 --> 00:01:01.925
People might think "What the hell is VEST Board?"

00:01:02.243 --> 00:01:05.125
What Ari said is it for VEST Board!

00:01:05.516 --> 00:01:06.606
YES!!

00:01:07.339 --> 00:01:09.130
By the way Boo...

00:01:10.332 --> 00:01:11.765
Can I talk ask you one thing?

00:01:11.765 --> 00:01:12.496
Sure.

00:01:12.596 --> 00:01:15.311
I heard you're photo had appeared in Times Square.

00:01:15.311 --> 00:01:16.314
That's right!

00:01:17.493 --> 00:01:22.828
I thought it was composite photo at the first time.

00:01:22.828 --> 00:01:24.782
But I heard it is a real picture!

00:01:25.817 --> 00:01:27.196
Can viewers watch this too?

00:01:27.454 --> 00:01:30.187
Our director will put this photo in this video.

00:01:30.325 --> 00:01:33.570
I still can't believe it. Doesn't it look like a composite?

00:01:37.005 --> 00:01:45.062
The introduction above says "Popular VJ Boo from Japan became a co-host of new type of show on YouTube 'VEST MEDIA.'"

00:01:45.906 --> 00:01:47.580
Incredible.

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:49.212
Are you sure?

00:01:49.457 --> 00:01:50.762
Where was it? Central...?

00:01:50.762 --> 00:01:51.488
Times Square.

00:01:51.488 --> 00:01:53.571
Oh no, not Central Park.

00:01:55.485 --> 00:01:59.413
Though we're in the West Coast, we've picked up in the East Coast.

00:01:59.413 --> 00:02:02.606
Surprising. Do you feel like you're a New Yorker?

00:02:03.034 --> 00:02:05.359
Not at all.

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:13.357
Well, let's get started with New Yorker Boo.

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:14.110
What the!

00:02:15.159 --> 00:02:16.394
Sorry for butting into your joke!

00:02:17.122 --> 00:02:20.704
You can watch cute kittens at the first video.

00:02:20.944 --> 00:02:24.014
This is very very cute one.

00:02:24.182 --> 00:02:25.580
Huh, type of CUTE?

00:02:26.268 --> 00:02:30.173
This is one of my favorite.
