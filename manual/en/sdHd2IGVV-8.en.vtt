00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:05.410
If Team Fortress 2 is the fun and crazy online
shooter with a strange addiction for headgear,

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:10.180
counter strike global offensive is probably
its serious cousin with an obsession with

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:12.330
guns, and competition.

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:13.730
Man this game is serious business.

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:19.159
But you are not here to hear me complain,
you are here because this is LowSpecGamer,

00:00:19.159 --> 00:00:25.380
where 2 Ghz and 30 FPS are big numbers. You
requested it and I aim to please.

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.860
So forget cool graphics and flying particles,
because we are going to make this game run.

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:52.160
This is the default configuration I got from
the installation. This is a source engine

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.810
game, so we can we expects lots of options
to play with and a decent performance on the

00:00:56.810 --> 00:01:03.050
get go, but this is is a pro online multiplayer
game, and every frame we can get counts towards

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:03.810
our performance.

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:06.100
So. Let's see what we got.

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.550
Why do I always seem to end off in the office
map?

00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:14.760
Yeah, yeah, let's all run together, this is
definitively how teamwork works, let's shoot

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:17.150
together at anything that moves.

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:23.409
So, when everyone is around and bullets are
flying we see around 35 frames per second.

00:01:23.409 --> 00:01:30.170
if the actions get close and personal it goes
under 30 and to around 25.

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:35.860
Of course... being alone means something around
50. But we are looking to make intense moments

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:39.170
better. Otherwise it will be very hard to
play effectively.

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:42.730
Am I the only one left in my team?

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:44.210
Ah shit...

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:53.740
As it was for Team Fortress, we can use some
simple launch commands to improve the performance

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:56.330
on those very needed moments.

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:02.510
First, we have “high”. This option will
make the game process run in high priority

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:07.380
mode. This is important since this game can
be very CPU intensive.

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:13.480
Next, we have “threads”, which we can
use to set the minim number of threads the

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:20.010
game uses and must be set to the same number
of logical threads of your CPU. To find out

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:25.620
how many logical threads your CPU has you
can go to the system manager that is opened

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:29.260
when you press control + alt+ delete.

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:35.080
See this tab over here? You will see one graph
for every logical thread. Some sites will

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:40.630
tell you that this is simply the number of
cores in your CPU but, boy, believe when I

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:49.069
say I do not have a quad core but rather one
of those odd intel notebook CPUs that has

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:54.959
two cores but four threads due to some magic
called “hyper threading”. Anyway, I have

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:59.160
4 logical threads, so I can finish the command
with a 4.

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:07.940
Finally we have “nod3d9ex”, which disables
a bunch of improvements done by the Direct3D 9 API

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:09.860
We do not need that.

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:16.910
Huh, that's nice. I think the new average
is around 45 and I do not thing it drops under

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:19.420
35. You can feel the difference just by playing.

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:24.080
Is that a guy guy there or just... SHIT.

00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:28.420
Come on guys. Behave, we have a game to play
here.

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:33.670
Why would you do that? Come on. Oh well, a
good chance to test performance. I do not

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:37.330
think that flashbang got us under 30

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:43.849
Almost 60 frames per second now. Very good!
Wait is there an enemy out there? Maybe I

00:03:43.849 --> 00:03:47.120
can circle around and get him.

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:51.220
Wait... where is he?

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:54.569
AH COME ON.

00:03:54.569 --> 00:04:00.209
Enough with the flashbangs! That guy over
there is stabbing a box. Boy we are all really

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:07.349
bad at this aren't we. This time my performance
dropped to 27 frames per second so... SHIT.

00:04:07.349 --> 00:04:15.340
Sigh
Well, time to show you my last tip.

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:20.560
Veteran Counter Strike players will know about
custom configuration files. But if you are

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:26.280
just starting you may not know that all the
game's configurations are saved on a file

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:31.560
and that you can copy configurations made
by other players that include tweaks to improve

00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:34.750
performance, such as preloaded textures.

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:41.750
I have tried several a so far my favorite
is FPS Boost configuration from game banana.

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:43.900
I will leave the link on the description.

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:51.810
And what you need to do is take this configuration
and copy it.

00:04:51.810 --> 00:05:00.490
The configuration file we are searching is
located at Program Files (x86)/steam/steamapps/common/

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:07.150
counter strike global offensive/csgo/cfg/config.cfg

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:13.310
Open up this file and copy your new configuration
over the old contents and save.

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:17.470
What is your favorite performance boosting
configuration? Where did you get it? Feel

00:05:17.470 --> 00:05:20.710
free to share them with me over comments!

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:27.740
This feels pretty speedy. More than 45 frames
per second on average? OH SHIT... Awwww...

00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:31.650
It's good to return to the office. I feel
like I am getting a couple more frames than

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:35.120
before. Between 37 and 45 frames per second.

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:38.509
Did that guy just flashbanged his own team?

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:43.520
Come on. Get that hostage. Let's get out of
here!

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:46.560
SHIT!... Aaww balls...

00:05:46.560 --> 00:05:51.389
Well. That's it for this video. I hope you
can get some use out of it. This game can

00:05:51.389 --> 00:05:57.150
be some serious business. Before playing I
checked some introduction videos and they

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:02.789
explain this was not a game for casuals and
that it would require study, practice and

00:06:02.789 --> 00:06:09.350
skill just to start playing. I decided to
ignore all of that and jump right in. I remember

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:14.490
telling myself: I will be fine, how hard could
it possibly be?

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:29.580
Wait. I actually got one of them!
