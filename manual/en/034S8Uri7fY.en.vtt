00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:03.840
Hey what's up

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:05.280
Man Vs. Pin Field Test

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:06.960
Actually it's more of a like a backyard test

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:10.880
This next pin comes from Ashley with over a 100+ likes

00:00:10.880 --> 00:00:11.840
It's the water blob

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:14.120
Which has been making its way around the Pinosphere this summer

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.500
Originally hailing from the Clumsy Crafter, this pin suggests taking a plastic tarp and some duct tape

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:19.880
To create this water blob

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.300
However, another pin from Homemade Toast suggests using an iron to fuse the plastic together

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.160
Which, I thought made a whole lot more sense

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.940
I got myself a roll of plastic from the hardware store

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.640
I picked up the thickest one which was 6.0 mil

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:35.600
And, just in case, grabbed some duct tape

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:38.840
Then I got myself some parchment paper and folded it in half 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.440
And marked out a line 2 inches away from the fold

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:45.460
This'll help create a little bit more consistency when fusing the plastic together

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.520
Next I unrolled the plastic and cut off a huge piece that I proceeded to fold in half

00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:53.540
Alright, we'll put some water in it

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.800
Well, I'm glad you asked!

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.560
Once I lined all the edges, I placed the parchment paper over the sides

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:05.160
and with my iron turned all the way up, began to fuse the plastic together

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.980
Which, only actually takes a few seconds of running your iron over it a couple of times

00:01:09.213 --> 00:01:10.033
And Voila!

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:12.480
Now, be sure to give it a sec to cool down

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:14.660
Sss, ah, *BLEEP*

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.700
And as you can see here, we now have this fused plastic edge

00:01:18.820 --> 00:01:24.840
After that I just simply moved my parchment paper along the edge of the plastic and fused together the three remaining sides

00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:29.940
And I thought this was totally gonna take forever, but the whole process probably took me about 15 minutes

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:35.360
Now right before I reached the end I left a small hole unfused and large enough to fit my hose in to

00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:37.280
Mmm..That didn't sound right

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.200
I made sure to check all of my edges before I wrapped everything up and took it back outside 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.120
Once I put it back out on the lawn I grabbed the hose and began to fill it up

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.060
Now you can stand there like an idiot for 20 minutes while it fills up

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.560
Or

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:48.860
You can prop it up on a chair

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.820
Your choice.

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:51.320
Now, I warn you

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:57.360
The hardest part of this whole project is probably going to be the anticipation from small children

00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:00.560
Which, apparently, is absolutely unbearable

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:02.100
Is it ready now?

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:06.940
It's not ready yet, it hasn't been ready for the past 20 minutes

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:11.480
About halfway through I put in some blue food coloring, which makes it look pretty awesome

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:13.260
"Looks like space!"

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:14.682
...Or...like space.

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:17.900
Once it's filled I just taped up the hole with some duct tape and-

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:18.620
"Is it ready?"

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:19.360
It's ready!

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:25.940
Now, we fed these kids a good amount of crap before we let them loose, just to see how long this thing would really last

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:27.080
Under intense conditions

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:29.320
This is awesome!

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:32.280
There was a whole lot of jumping

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:35.640
There were some water blob angels

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:37.060
Some acrobatics

00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:39.640
Some..ah..some babies

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:43.920
All in all, it lasted about a solid, mmmm, 10 minutes before the first leak was sprung

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:46.160
Alright, we've got hole #1

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:52.000
And it really wasn't that bad, just a couple little holes in the seams of the plastic and the where the fusing meets the water

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:57.760
A few of these began to spring up within the first few minutes or so, but with a couple pieces of tape, it really wasn't a big problem

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:59.560
"That is not helping"

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:00.600
"Ah, there's another one"

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:04.120
Ah, yep, you just made it bigger...

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:10.960
However, all the duct tape in the world wont help you when a child's natural instinct of picking at things completely takes over

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:14.440
"I'm picking holes. I love you hole!"

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:16.700
"It looks like it's peeing"

00:03:16.940 --> 00:03:20.100
Oop, yea, yeah, that is wet now.

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:24.700
And ..The Water Blob has been compromised

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:29.700
Which isn't necessarily a bad thing. 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:33.380
It kinda gave the Water Blob a second life after the kids initial excitement wore off

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:36.260
THIS IS AWESOME!!!

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:38.460
Now, it just becomes a small pool

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:40.620
Or..a watering hole

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.420
Whichever you prefer, because apparently it tastes delicious

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:48.960
All in all it lasted a good 3 hours, I would say

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:58.380
The Water Blob, pretty successful, few pieces of duct tape here and there, but, otherwise, damn fine time

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:04.840
Leave a, ya know, some fun pins for the summer in the comments below, and we'll see you next time!

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:07.240
Kids. &lt;3
