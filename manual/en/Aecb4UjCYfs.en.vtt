00:00:12.999 --> 00:00:15.999
when the surface is completely dry

00:00:14.299 --> 00:00:17.999
the concrete is ready to be sealed

00:00:17.999 --> 00:00:22.500
we strongly recommend that a coat of sealer
be applied to the surface prior to

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:23.929
engraving operations

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:25.050
to protect the stain

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:30.070
the exception to this will be when you plan to
accent stain after engraving

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:34.570
there are several options for the type of sealer
that are available

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:39.050
water based acrylics and solvent based acrylic
are the most common and will be covered

00:00:39.999 --> 00:00:40.030
in this video

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.310
in the advanced video the use of epoxies and
urethanes will be covered

00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:49.999
in most cases water based and solvent based
acrylics will meet your needs

00:00:49.999 --> 00:00:53.800
while being more cost effective
and simpler in application

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:56.480
water based acrylic is described as
low odor

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:02.999
low cost low toxicity and works on interior
and exterior applications

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:06.999
this sealer can only be applied by roller or
airless spray system

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:11.250
the application of water based sealer with a 
pump sprayer is not recommended

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.750
because areas where the material becomes too
thick are not likely to cure properly

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:17.999
and will remain milky

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.310
in cases where the use of solvents are 
prohibited

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.160
water based acrylics may be your best solution
to sealing

00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:29.380
any stained clean surface can accept water
based acrylic sealers

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:34.620
when rolling be sure to wrap your roller cover
with masking tape to remove loose lint

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:36.600
and fibers

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:44.180
solvent based acrylic sealer can be described
as high odor toxic

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:48.890
extremely easy to apply and best for use in 
exterior environments

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:53.940
this sealer may be rolled on or sprayed on a 
clean surface with acid based stains

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:58.230
if you used concrete resurrection water reducble
concentrate stain

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:01.390
solvent based sealers must be sprayed on

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.390
a professional grade metal pump sprayer
utilizing viton seals

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.390
is required when using solvent based sealers

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:13.990
special attention to personal safety is recommended
when using this product

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:17.990
remember to use safety goggles and masks
at a minimum

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.000
as you are spraying the sealer move the wand in 
a circular motion

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.999
this will lay the sealer down more uniformly
on the concrete

00:02:25.999 --> 00:02:29.999
be sure to follow manufactures directions for
re-coating while allowing for sufficient

00:02:29.999 --> 00:02:31.500
drying time

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:36.500
remember when applying water based sealers to
RAC stained surfaces

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.500
the end result will be a duller surface

00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:40.999
similar to dry stains

00:02:40.999 --> 00:02:44.500
solvent based sealers will leave you with a 
finished surface

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.479
which gives the appearance of a wet stained area

00:02:46.479 --> 00:02:52.479
with a richer deeper and more vibrant color
expression
