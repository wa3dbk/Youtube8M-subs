soft ochre pay

take this to light

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:07.229
cream-colored and gonna play it all over

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:11.110
deleted and then up to the brow bone
because we're just setting and nice

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:14.860
late be and doing this is just gonna
allow a more

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:19.240
even grip for your shed now we're gonna
be taking this

00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.420
pinky nude match shade and its

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:26.090
gonna be left up on lead and then we're
gonna work it above the crease

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:32.810
an almost up to the brow bone as well

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:34.869
and this is going to be used as our main

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:38.609
lending color

00:01:38.609 --> 00:01:43.490
up now we're gonna be taking this match

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:47.549
bold shocked re delicious cranberry
shade

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:51.229
and Israel descriptor for international
anyway

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:54.359
and we're gonna kicking it on the
outside the lid

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:57.819
we're gonna be going in the outer corner
and just very gently bring it in

00:01:57.819 --> 00:01:58.619
slightly

00:01:58.619 --> 00:02:02.149
we're gonna work on this more later see
you don't really have to perfect it for

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.670
now

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:06.479
next your gonna be taking this muted
pink shimmer town

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:10.170
and we're just gonna be using the brush
to apply it all over the lid

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:15.670
where we haven't placed the Met shadow
you also want to avoid it going into the

00:02:15.670 --> 00:02:16.160
crease

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:19.400
because it can make it look a little bit
muddy so just

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:22.420
be careful to stay below where you got
that crack

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.230
in now we're gonna go back to that

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:30.150
original blending shade and we're just
gonna soften the edges up a bit

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:34.280
make sure everything looks a little bit
neater it even a good idea just to look

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:35.890
straight ahead in the mir

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:39.239
and make sure you've got everything
blended out nicely to purchase looks

00:02:39.239 --> 00:02:39.950
like a nice

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:44.930
glow of color coming from the shimmery
shadows after that and just taking this

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:49.250
lucky blending brush to ensure that
everything blended up on the edges and

00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:50.750
around the brow bone nicely

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:56.519

retractable eyeliner by Athens in the
shade hot chocolate

00:03:00.579 --> 00:03:03.970
and I'm just gonna be applying it
underneath my waterline

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:10.970
and you're gonna go slightly more than
half way and

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:15.569
now and gonna take this

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:20.330

just the edges that cover that wanted to

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:20.569

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:27.180
a harsh overlook ferial okay now and
taking this brindell scandalized

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:31.410
insulin nuthin just lining the waterline
this is gonna keep me from look into

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:33.040

I because as you can see page next we're
gonna go back to that pink shimmer

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:40.129

on the bottom lash line

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:19.340
