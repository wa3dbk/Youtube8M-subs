00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.180
standing in the other thing i'm thinking
of also is uh...

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:06.019
george w_ bush inouye

00:00:06.019 --> 00:00:07.759
has lowered the bar

00:00:07.759 --> 00:00:11.130
for this idea that listen it doesn't
matter if

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.519
the guys but the republicans nominate

00:00:13.519 --> 00:00:15.649
is completely incompetent

00:00:15.649 --> 00:00:19.019
it's okay to elect someone completely
incompetent

00:00:19.019 --> 00:00:23.199
as long as it keeps a democrat out of
office that is now ok among republican

00:00:23.199 --> 00:00:26.389
circles right even mitch mcconnell said
the number one things get rid of obama

00:00:26.389 --> 00:00:28.840
doesn't matter who replaced

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:32.710
i mean i i guess that that's a
possibility i know from the side of the

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:35.510
the legislators it's okay to destroy
your country

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:37.760
to make sure return

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.420
along with that their characters and the
secure reelected until it went on

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:42.510
friends

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:45.710
romney might be a good president inouye

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:49.370
well i mean i think i foresee two
possibilities in around the presidency

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:50.980
one is that

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:52.150
he's a moderate

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:56.180
so in other words he's a he's ponting
himself up to be some sort of right wing

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:00.900
extremist capable an extremist rightwing
guy catering to the republican base

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:03.800
right when he's elected he'll just be a
moderate that's one possibility which

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:05.610
would be that bad

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:09.090
in other words it would be much better
than a right wing extremist presidency

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:09.750
okay

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:14.390
on the other hand he might just cater to
whatever interests are pushing him to

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:16.950
act on any given situation

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.810
ourselves so that weber puts the most
lobbying money and is good influence raw

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:24.150
meat into absolutely anything but that's
pretty optimistic is that says that all

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.030
the progressives have to do is find a
way to get out this guy

00:01:28.030 --> 00:01:32.460
in hell actually cater to them because
he has no convictions of his own fastest

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:34.359
i think that is just his uh...

00:01:34.359 --> 00:01:37.740
his campaign face i think this is on a
that pandering

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.250
anne i have no idea what the iraqis
actually about and i don't think anybody

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:45.259
does because this is all that is all
pandering this is all to win who knows

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:48.539
we seem to me with this thing could be a
kind of in the condo but you're saying

00:01:48.539 --> 00:01:50.770
is that the hell do anything else that

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:53.780
they'll have an agenda we have no way of
knowing what it will be before you

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.720
select the right

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:58.500
uh... deborah and it's not real quick
yeah i mean if we need to look at what

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:02.920
he did in massachusetts he wasn't that
conservative of the governor compared to

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.400
of their parts of the country no he also
was it that competent

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.119
that's true but what i'm saying is

00:02:08.119 --> 00:02:11.459
lake it like louis is saying we don't
know what you'll do

00:02:11.459 --> 00:02:14.789
governing the country is massachusetts
was a liberal state this guy caters to

00:02:14.789 --> 00:02:16.250
the situation he's in

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:18.370
the country is not as liberal as
messages
