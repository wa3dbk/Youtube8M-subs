00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:06.550
-Hey, everyone.

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:08.710
I'm Mindy from Cute
Girls Hairstyles.

00:00:08.710 --> 00:00:10.380
Today, I'm going to
show you how to do

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:12.310
yarn extension fishtail braid.

00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:13.910
So you will love it.

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:16.900
I think this is a great way
to add color to your hair

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:20.650
if you're going to a football
event, if you're a cheerleader,

00:00:20.650 --> 00:00:22.910
or you have a costume that
you're trying to match.

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:24.590
Where else could
you use this time?

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:26.570
If you had dress or
a certain outfit.

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:29.976
-Or costumes and dance
recitals or anything like that.

00:00:29.976 --> 00:00:32.100
-It's a really fun way to
pep up color in your hair

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:35.690
without actually dying
your hair-- so no long term

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:36.560
commitment.

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:39.380
So what we've done is we've
gone to our local craft store

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:42.420
and we've picked up
some skeins of yarn--

00:00:42.420 --> 00:00:44.600
just in any color you
want will work fine.

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:45.840
And we picked those colors.

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:48.320
And we have cut them
into pieces just

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:50.092
depending on length
of your hair.

00:00:50.092 --> 00:00:51.300
See, I'll show you right now.

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.980
I pulled up the top
portion of her hair

00:00:53.980 --> 00:00:59.760
and I've tied the yarn all
throughout her hair like this.

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:02.490
And I'll show you how I did that
right here on this front piece.

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:03.960
So I just took the yard.

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.130
I folded it in half.

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:07.380
I'm going to pick up this
little section of hair right

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:08.129
here in the front.

00:01:11.601 --> 00:01:15.840
And I'm going to just literally
tie the string around her hair,

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.790
just like you're going
to tie a shoelace.

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:21.850
So you want to pull it pretty
tight so it stays up there.

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:23.512
And then I'm going
to double knot it.

00:01:23.512 --> 00:01:25.720
And I'm going to give it
one last little tug before I

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:26.670
double knot it.

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.940
Now, just in case you're
worried about it sliding down

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:31.490
the hair, because some people
have the texture of hair that

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:34.640
is more slick, I'm just
going to go back and tease

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:36.430
right there just a little bit.

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:40.780
And that's just going to help
secure that yard into the hair.

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.060
Now, when you're all done
placing the yarn in the pattern

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:45.950
you want and how
many ever you want--

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:48.360
we did-- how many did we do?

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:51.047
One, two, three, four five,
six seven, eight, nine, 10, 11,

00:01:51.047 --> 00:01:54.470
12-- 13 total, but you can
do how many ever you want.

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:56.410
Going to let her hair down.

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:59.450
Part it on one side.

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:04.730
And I'm going to sweep
it all over one shoulder

00:02:04.730 --> 00:02:08.396
and make sure I get
this the way I want it.

00:02:08.396 --> 00:02:10.229
So we're going to go
into the fishtail down.

00:02:10.229 --> 00:02:11.687
And I'm just going
to do a fishtail

00:02:11.687 --> 00:02:14.310
that lands over the
side of her shoulder.

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.370
So you're going to
divide the hair in half.

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.790
And you're just going to
pick up an outside piece.

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:23.506
And I'm going to try to
grab a string of yarn.

00:02:23.506 --> 00:02:24.880
And then, of
course, you're going

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:31.420
to grab another outside piece
and bring it over, as well.

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:34.040
And you're just going to
keep going back and forth

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:40.110
and pulling those pieces of
yarn along with pieces of hair

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:41.372
so that they crisscross.

00:02:41.372 --> 00:02:43.330
And you guys know-- I
always say it-- fishtails

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:45.290
take a little bit of
time, just because you're

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:47.344
trying to get smaller pieces.

00:02:47.344 --> 00:02:49.010
And if you can't see
the yarn right off,

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:50.801
don't worry, because
we can always go back.

00:02:50.801 --> 00:02:52.530
As long as you have
the yarn in the hair,

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:55.900
you can always go back
and adjust the placement

00:02:55.900 --> 00:02:57.150
when we're all done.

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.365
I want a pink one in there.

00:02:59.365 --> 00:03:00.240
Pull a pink one over.

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:06.956
And here's another fun pink one.

00:03:06.956 --> 00:03:08.330
We're just going
to keep creating

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:12.910
our fishtail-- our
multi-colored fishtail here.

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:16.055
Let's get some
yellow going through.

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:23.365
And we're going to work our
way all the way down the braid.

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:28.840
Now, if you are a
cheerleader, a fun thing to do

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:31.060
would be to run your school
colors through your hair.

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:33.165
So red, black, and
white, or whatever-- blue

00:03:33.165 --> 00:03:36.250
and gold-- whatever it may be.

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:38.290
That would be a fun way
to pep it up for a game.

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:44.040
And you can see we're
just basic fishtail.

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:46.840
I'm taking a little bit chunkier
pieces than I normally would,

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:51.937
just because the smaller piece,
the longer it takes to do it.

00:03:51.937 --> 00:03:53.645
And I'm trying to go
a little bit faster.

00:03:56.950 --> 00:03:58.700
We need some more pink.

00:03:58.700 --> 00:03:59.390
Aha.

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:00.311
There's some.

00:04:00.311 --> 00:04:03.678
[MUSIC - CHARITY VANCE, "ICING"]

00:04:09.475 --> 00:04:11.850
And when you get down to where
you're running out of hair

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:16.519
or your layers are starting to
pop out, simply take an elastic

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:23.470
and finish the whole thing
off with the elastic.

00:04:23.470 --> 00:04:30.590
Now, a fun way to end this would
be to just take some yarn--

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:38.920
and you can just go back up
and even just take that yarn

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:42.950
and wrap it around the
elastic to finish it off

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:49.630
with a little extra
yarn like this.

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:59.740
Then you can just tuck this
back under and pull it through.

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:02.020
And then just go down to
the end of your hair--

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:04.530
make sure not to cut
your hair-- and just cut

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:09.084
the ends of the yarn and leave
the colors to show through.

00:05:09.084 --> 00:05:11.000
And then you can just
go back and, if you just

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.300
tweak and twist-- you
can pull on the yarns

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:15.810
if you want them to pop
through a little bit more.

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:19.440
Or you can flatten the pancake a
little bit on the fishtail just

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:22.760
to give it a little
softer, more bohemian feel

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:24.820
and let those colors pop out.

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:25.950
And you are all finished.

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:27.430
I think it's adorable.

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:28.260
What do you think?

00:05:28.260 --> 00:05:29.110
-I like it.

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:33.070
I'll spin her so you
get the completed look.

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:35.455
So cute.

00:05:35.455 --> 00:05:36.080
Do you love it?

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:36.830
-Mm-hmm.

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:37.330
-OK.

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:39.355
So make sure and check
out our new video

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:42.040
well, today.

So you get two videos
this week instead of one.

which is an adorable bun.
