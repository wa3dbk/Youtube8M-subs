00:00:00.399 --> 00:00:04.380
Today were going to review Part# 5AS16K.

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.069
This is the Reese Elite Airborne/Sidewinder
Combo.

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:12.460
This one has no turret, and it is a 16,000-pound
weight capacity.

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:16.500
The reason this does not have a turret is
because it is required you have to mount a

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.859
rotating turret on here to work correctly.

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:22.130
We do sell those separately, but theres about
five different ones that you would need to

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:26.749
choose from, and youll have to pick the correct
one for your application because the turret

00:00:26.749 --> 00:00:32.279
itself is made to fit a particular pin box
manufacturer that is on your fifth wheel.

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:37.220
Once you get what pin box manufacturer you
have and then choose the correct turret, then

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:42.390
you could just add that turret to this and
youd be all ready to go.This 5th Airborne/Sidewinder

00:00:42.390 --> 00:01:32.190
Combo will provide the benefit of both a 5th
airborne air-ride pin box and the automatic

00:01:32.190 --> 00:02:48.919
turning 

00:02:48.919 --> 00:03:03.650
of 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:20.549
the sidewinder 

00:03:20.549 --> 00:04:36.400
pin box.
