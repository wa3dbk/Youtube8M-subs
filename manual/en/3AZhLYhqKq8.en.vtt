Hey Rick this is JT here at Handys I want
to do a quick video walk around on this Toyota

00:00:06.149 --> 00:00:11.980
Tacoma I know you Hate red so I'm just showing
you this one I can get you any color any option

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:16.930
you want just kind of wanted to walk you through
some of the features that are on these on

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:21.050
the sport model this is what you were interested
in as you can see you have the hood scoop.

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:25.590
You get the fog lights your rims and tires
are a little bit different than they are in

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.880
the stock model same size you just get the
Alloy rims.

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.330
You get the blinker integrated in to the side
mirror.

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:45.010
Now let's walk around out back as you see
on this TRD sport you have the blistein shocks,

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:48.440
skid plates underneath for protection on your
motor and the differential.

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:55.269
Alright so on the back of this Tacoma as you
can see you have your hitch got your wiring

00:00:55.269 --> 00:00:58.270
Back up camera is integrated into right here
I'll show you how that works on the inside

00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:02.190
of the truck still make it very easy to back
up to anything.

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.470
Inside this bed it is a hard plastic bed easy
to put anything on so you dont need a bed

00:01:06.470 --> 00:01:10.659
liner you have the track system on the top
if you need to tie down anything you've got

00:01:10.659 --> 00:01:14.920
a storage compartment on either side the one
on the other side is a little bit bigger easy

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:21.210
spot to put tools gloves anything like that
that you need now this truck is pretty neat

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:24.840
because it's got the power source in the back
if you are anything like me I run my table

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:28.840
saw out on the back of my tailgate when I
am outside working in the summer time so this

00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:34.329
makes that a lot easier than running an extension
cord alright Rick so on the top of this one.

00:01:34.329 --> 00:01:40.090
This one has a very unique side rail on the
top as you can see I have already undone this

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:51.110
side they come across and reattach so that
if you want to put something over on top and

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:55.570
you need them on crossbars instead of the
side bars that is easy to do and they just

00:01:55.570 --> 00:01:59.610
position themselves right back Alright Rick
when you put the truck in reverse as you can

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.090
see the back up camera comes on and the radio
your guidelines you can see the hitch would

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.710
be right about here so when you are backing
up the stuff when you have the ball inserted

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:15.810
into it its easy to see when you are backing
up everything Radio is all touch screen Bluetooth

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:21.100
hands free all of your hands free controls
are on the steering wheel for your phone calls

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:24.500
for the music your volume button.

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:32.310
Most of the key features for the sport model
are over here on the left hand side top button

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.270
right here is for your fog lights.

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:41.280
This is for that power source in the bed of
your truck traction control button clutch

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:47.620
start cancel you can probably ignore I know
you want the automatic and the RSCA off is

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:52.590
the roll side curtain air bags so that if
you want to go off roading a little bit the

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:58.250
air bags wont deploy and when you go a little
bit sideways on it alright Rick so like I

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:02.530
