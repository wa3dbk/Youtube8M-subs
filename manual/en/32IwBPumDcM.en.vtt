00:00:03.049 --> 00:00:09.719
I'm going to do a review of a couple of
flashlights that have just simply amazed

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:15.929
to me they're the brightest flashlights
I've ever had and the batteries last

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.430
they're rechargeable batteries and they
last a good long time

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:25.380
and I'm going to tell you about this one
first friend of mine in Colorado sent

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:33.420
this to me and I work at night so I have
to have flashlights I go on to oil well

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:42.480
sites gas wells sites and do a lot of
work at night in the dark this is a an

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:49.350
LED bulb made by Cree it's an American
company in Durham North Carolina I've

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:56.399
never heard of them before and I've done
a little bit of research on them and I

00:00:56.399 --> 00:01:00.989
liked this flashlight let me put it
there where you can see it I like this

00:01:00.989 --> 00:01:07.290
flashlight so much and went and bought a
smaller one that I keep in and a little

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.280
pocket on the side of my pants you know
the carpenter uh pants where they've got

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.549
got a little ruler parking on this
pocket on the side I'll keep this one

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:25.979
this is an ultra fire this model here is
501 B with a Cree light bulb and the the

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:30.570
brightness is just phenomenal I mean I
just can't believe something this small

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:34.350
put out that much light just what the
light for the battery looks like it's a

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:42.200
3 volt rechargeable battery and it lasts
me probably a week before I need to

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:47.520
recharge it there is a couple of things
now these lights are both chinese-made

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:55.350
and I did experience some trouble with
this at first and I did a little bit of

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:03.000
reading online and I found out what it
is the tail cap has a threaded washer in

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:10.200
here let me see if I can I'm gonna put
my light on that so you can it has a

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.100
threaded washer in here and that
threaded washer has a cult

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:19.370
little holes in there well that thing
gets a little loose and I need to do is

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:23.930
well all I did was take a pen and stick
it in one of them holes and tighten it

00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:31.190
up and it's worked great ever since this
bigger one the well sites that I go on

00:02:31.190 --> 00:02:37.580
are typically two or three acres across
and this will shine from one end to the

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:44.600
other and it will illuminate everything
I need to see some of these well sites

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:50.000
that I go on contain a gas called h2s
and if you breathe it it will

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:55.670
incapacitate you so you have to choose
an evacuation route when you go on these

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:59.420
wealth sites you have to constantly
watch the windsock to determine which

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:03.680
direction the wind is blowing in and
from across the well site I can shine

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:10.490
this on the windsock and constantly
monitor wind direction and that is a

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:17.270
lifesaver right there it's a lifesaver
and I actually thought I could depend on

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:26.600
the Pelican light that I returned and
then got a broken one back and it was

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:31.970
undependable and when your life depends
on something I'm not exaggerating and if

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:36.890
I can't see to evacuate if I can't see
the windsock I could die

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:44.510
not so important having a reliable light
is on my job so these are two of the

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:47.900
best White's
I have ever had and they're only 17

00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:53.380
bucks on Amazon there's this well I'll
shut this off and I'll show you a

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:58.520

bought this one this one I bought for 17

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:04.880
bucks this one's for sale on the same
site for it's about the same this one is

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:12.740
a little bit brighter just because the
know what all this part the the Bell I

00:04:12.740 --> 00:04:15.410
don't know
the Bell is bigger than this one this

00:04:15.410 --> 00:04:20.420
one's really bright for a like this
small but this one is a good bit

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:25.830
brighter and the beam casts further but
they're both fantastic lights
