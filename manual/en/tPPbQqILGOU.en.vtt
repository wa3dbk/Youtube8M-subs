00:00:01.179 --> 00:00:02.179
Video Transcript:

00:00:02.179 --> 00:00:03.179
Hi, I’m Sarah here with RealTruck.com.

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:06.850
Our team is working hard to finish up the
Storm Truck, which is our 2012 SEMA truck.

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:10.810
The latest projects to be completed are really
bringing the front of our truck to life.

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:16.600
I’m talking about our custom Boondock Backwoods
bumper, our KC HiLites 10” LED light bars

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.700
and our T-Max Off Road winch.

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:22.270
So, stick with us, I’m going to give you
a quick look at how the installation of these

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:24.000
accessories went.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.720
And at the end of the video we’ll show you
the electric winch hard at work pulling this

00:00:27.720 --> 00:01:08.700
beast of a truck up onto a trailer.

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:28.310
[music]

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:52.189
The yellow wire here is gonna be used for
the power; it’s to go to the battery, just

00:01:52.189 --> 00:01:53.560
a power source.

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:57.000
The ground is already attached to the relay,
which we attached to the frame.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:59.899
This white light here is going to be our signal
which we are going to tap it off with the

00:01:59.899 --> 00:02:16.180
factory fog light wiring.

00:02:16.180 --> 00:02:31.579
[music]

00:02:31.579 --> 00:02:34.489
Just like any other electrical piece it needs
a power and a ground.

00:02:34.489 --> 00:02:35.579
So you’re going to have your ground here.

00:02:35.579 --> 00:02:38.389
We’re gonna to run this down.

00:02:38.389 --> 00:02:42.680
The ground will be fastened up here, along
with this bolt right here.

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:51.340
And our power is attached to our 12-volt source
on our power wire, which is below the manifold

00:02:51.340 --> 00:03:10.480
right here.

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:20.049
[music]

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:33.199
[sounds of the winch and the truck]

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:35.260
[music]

00:03:35.260 --> 00:03:37.330
