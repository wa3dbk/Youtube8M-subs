00:00:04.797 --> 00:00:08.123
A Microsoft manager says next
gen specs are meaningless.

00:00:08.123 --> 00:00:11.347
Darkspore is deserted by EA and
removed from Steam.

00:00:11.347 --> 00:00:15.144
And Google releases statistics on
the state of video games on YouTube.

00:00:15.144 --> 00:00:16.943
I'm Neil, this is your Remag Daily.

00:00:16.943 --> 00:00:19.439
[MUSIC]

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:20.855
Speaking to OXM last week,

00:00:20.855 --> 00:00:25.047
Microsoft's product planning manager
Albert Penello said that hardware specs

00:00:25.047 --> 00:00:28.910
for either console is meaningless
because it all comes down to the games.

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:31.810
He says that the problem is that
Sony decided to just go out and

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:34.390
publish a bunch of numbers,
which are in some ways meaningless.

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:36.800
Penello has since received
internet backlash and

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:38.850
took to NeoGAF to clarify his statements.

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:41.970
He reiterates that he's not diminishing
Sony's performance claims and

00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:44.070
wasn't trying to be arrogant or
dismissive.

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.280
And that only great
games are what matters.

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.010
But like Microsoft these days,
Penello says he loves taking the hits, and

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:52.230
he probably should've paid
more attention to his words.

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.340
It seems Microsoft hasn't been able to
catch a break, with them having to do

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:58.920
damage control on just about everything
they've done and said since E3.

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:03.170
But hey look, system specs don't matter
unless you have the best system specs, and

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:04.555
then they kind of matter, huh.

00:01:04.555 --> 00:01:09.060
Maxis's action RPG Darkspore was
removed from Steam because of, yes,

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.120
you guessed it, server issues that
rendered the game unplayable.

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:15.150
The game had been experiencing
these issues for months, and

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:16.270
since its release in 2011,

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:19.440
it's been plagued with server errors
that locked out players from the game.

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:23.520
Before being shut down on Steam, Darkspore
was experiencing server-side issues that

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:25.760
didn't even allow players
to save their characters.

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:27.840
Since then,
an announcement on the official forum,

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:30.980
started that Darkspore wouldn't be fixed,
and that the game was for

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:33.892
almost all intents and
purposes an abandoned title.

00:01:33.892 --> 00:01:37.670
While Darkspore and its ongoing issues
aren't a very big deal in 2013,

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:40.140
it sets an alarming
precedent with EA outright

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.500
abandoning the game with
next to no explanation.

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.320
So what does this mean for
future EA published games?

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.790
When EA no longer sees value
in your favorite game,

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:49.770
they may just pull
the plug without warning.

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:50.770
And for all their faults,

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:54.460
this is exactly what Microsoft was
trying to prevent with the Xbox One,

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:58.300
leaving game authentication to Microsoft
instead of individual publishers.

00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:01.720
Google has released some very interesting
statistics in a document called

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:02.880
Gamers on YouTube.

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:06.100
You guys should all check it out, but
the basic thesis is that time spent

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:09.110
viewing game-related videos
has doubled year over year.

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:11.840
About half of all views on
YouTube are from publishers

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.540
before the launch of a video game.

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.080
So this would be announcement videos,
gameplay demos,

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.610
launch promotions, et cetera.

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.290
And then once a game is released,
the community takes over and

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:23.480
produces the other half of all
views over a game's lifespan.

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.480
So this would be parody videos, funny
in-game footage, tutorials, walkthroughs,

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:28.220
and last-plays.

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:30.970
Especially interesting is
that before a game comes out,

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:33.480
most views are coming
from desktop systems.

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:36.590
But once a title is released,
those views transition to mobile.

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:39.550
Presumably because gamers are playing
the game on their TV, and

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:42.550
looking up videos about the game
on their phones while playing.

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:44.950
Check out the full document in
the description link below for

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:47.080
all sorts of highly
interesting information.

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:50.710
And that's been your Remag Daily for
Monday everyone, thanks for watching.

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:53.625
In other sad news,
today is my last day on Remag.

00:02:53.625 --> 00:02:56.330
[LAUGH] No it's not.

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:58.710
Production tried to get rid of me and
I said absolutely not,

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:01.040
in fact, it's all Neil all the time.

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:02.810
So I got rid of the other two hosts.

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:05.010
I bet you're wondering how I did it.

00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:09.070
Okay, let's just take care
of the first problem.

00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:16.069
[NOISE] Hey, Holly, hi, yeah,
I just wanted to see how you were doing.

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:17.070
How you're holding up.

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:17.810
You didn't hear?

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:21.640
Your, your whole planet has,
yeah, bird flu.

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:22.140
Bird Flu.

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:26.220
Yeah, being a race of bird people,
I imagine it's, pretty bad.

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.690
It's too bad Remag's
keeping you here on Earth.

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:29.370
You're probably immune.

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:30.350
You could probably save them all.

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:31.470
But I, no, I get.

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:32.860
I get it, you know?

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:35.908
Reporting the news once a week,
huge commitment.

00:03:35.908 --> 00:03:36.460
What?

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:37.010
What's that?

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:40.020
You want me to take over
all your Remag episodes?

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:42.065
Well, I mean, what are friends for?

00:03:42.065 --> 00:03:43.800
[LAUGH] No, no.

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:45.310
That's, that's me crying.

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:46.680
Yeah, I'm crying for your planet.

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:47.950
All right, good luck out there.

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:49.865
Thanks for playing.

00:03:49.865 --> 00:03:51.618
One down.

00:03:51.618 --> 00:03:53.777
[SOUND].

00:03:53.777 --> 00:03:58.790
&gt;&gt; Hm, now if i can only come up
with an idea how to get rid of Lisa.

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:00.750
Ooh, I've got it.

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:08.437
I'll impersonate the only one she
trusts completely, the big boss of TGS.

00:04:08.437 --> 00:04:12.261
[SOUND].

00:04:12.261 --> 00:04:15.883
[NOISE] Hi Lisa, it's Big Boss here.

00:04:15.883 --> 00:04:19.552
Sorry to tell you this but
we have to let you go.

00:04:19.552 --> 00:04:21.595
Nay nay oats oats carrots.

00:04:21.595 --> 00:04:22.559
So there you go.

00:04:22.559 --> 00:04:24.240
It's all Neil all the time.

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:27.305
Things are gonna be a little bit different
around here now that I'm running Remag.

00:04:27.305 --> 00:04:30.575
First of all, no Holly, no Chad, no Lisa.

00:04:30.575 --> 00:04:33.525
Every episode is gonna start
with maniacal laughter.

00:04:33.525 --> 00:04:35.410
Every episode ends with maniacal laughter.

00:04:35.410 --> 00:04:38.705
[LAUGH] What are they gonna do,
give the show to Chad?

00:04:38.705 --> 00:04:40.858
Yeah, [LAUGH] right.

00:04:40.858 --> 00:04:42.831
Are you seriously giving the show to Chad?

00:04:42.831 --> 00:04:43.900
No!

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:45.409
He's half the man I am.

00:04:45.409 --> 00:04:47.390
On the death of Washington and Remag.

00:04:47.390 --> 00:04:49.282
I am King Kong.

00:04:49.282 --> 00:04:49.873
