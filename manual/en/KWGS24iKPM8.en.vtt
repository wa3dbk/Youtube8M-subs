00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:17.630
Like fox, his face resembles Command, but
his clothes are a slight redesign of what

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:19.441
he wore in Star Fox 64.

00:00:19.441 --> 00:00:33.680
The colors are red and closer to Command though.

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:37.360
Falco's second resembles the Command rape-design
of Katt Monroe.

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:38.360
eww...

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:41.710
It also resembles Andrew, so let's go with
that one and pretend command never happened

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:43.719
in any way.

00:00:43.719 --> 00:00:48.079
Just kidding, this actually resembles Peppy
quite well from Star Fox 64 too, down to the

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:52.319
faint orangey tinge to his jacket, which was
more just awkward lighting, but Adventures

00:00:52.319 --> 00:00:58.030
kept and made canon.

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:07.020
Falco's third resembles Slippy from Star Fox
64.

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:11.280
Falco's fourth may represent his assault suit,
but resembles General Pepper with the strong

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:17.549
red colors, and orange and black accents.

00:01:17.549 --> 00:01:22.229
Falco's fifth may similarly stem from how
Sakurai likes to draw Star Fox characters

00:01:22.229 --> 00:01:24.800
as an extension of Fox's.

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:47.000
More broadly it might represent Fox or James
from Star Fox 64.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.891
Falco's final is popularly considered to represent
rebel Falco from adventures, but likely has

00:01:51.891 --> 00:01:59.130
the same heritage as Dark Fox's; Andross from
Star Fox 64 or Aparoid infection or just as

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:34.660
a darker reflection of Falco.
