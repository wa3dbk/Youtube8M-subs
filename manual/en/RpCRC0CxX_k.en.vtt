hello to everyone welcome to howTo Channel

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:12.730
today I'm going to show you a little
trick

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:15.789
it's not a tutorial, just a little trick

00:00:15.789 --> 00:00:19.180
of how you can check or recover your current

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:23.429
wifi password that you are using on your computer

00:00:23.429 --> 00:00:26.560
it's very useful if you don't remember it

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:30.970
and you want to add another device on your network and you don't want to go

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:34.020
through the hassle of reset the router's password

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:37.270
or ask for help to do it, because you maybe don't even know how to do it.

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:42.110
So first we're going to go to
control panel

00:00:42.110 --> 00:00:45.300
in this case I'm using Windows 8.1

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:48.410
it is the same way on Windows 8

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:52.300
and we must click "Windows+C"

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:55.600
and then to open Windows Charms

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.720
into settings -&gt; control panel

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:02.190
and from here is the same on Windows 7

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:05.900
on 7 it is the same window

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:09.670
then we click network and Internet from all
those options

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:13.630
and from these network options, we are going to see the network status

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:16.780
 

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:20.550
here we can see on which network we are connected, it is important to be connected

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:24.070
on the network that you want to recover the password

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:27.600
or to know about it. You need to know 

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.150
that if the password is not stored on this computer

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:34.510
and you are not administrator, you are not going to be able to see it.

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:38.390
So we click on the network that we are connected

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:42.770
and then wireless properties

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.820
security tab and here we can see the security

00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:50.909
options for this network

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:54.010
as you can see here is the key and it is hidden.

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:57.630
And to reveal it you just have to click
this little checkbox

00:01:57.630 --> 00:01:59.479
 

00:01:59.479 --> 00:02:03.140
but as I was saying before, you need to be administrator as this icon is showing

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:06.450
in this case I am, so it won't be a problem

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.729
here you can see my password, maybe blurred out

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:14.220
or strike-through because I don't want to show 

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.220
my password to anyone but you can see

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.900
how this works

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:26.410
well I hope that this little trick has helped you, and let me know on the comments below, what do you think

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:30.269
or if you need some kind of help or more assistance in this matter

00:02:30.269 --> 00:02:33.709
and yeah that's pretty much everything, guys

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:39.680
so thank you for watching and have a nice day

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:40.760
me
