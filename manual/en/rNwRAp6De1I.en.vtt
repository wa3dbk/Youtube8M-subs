00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:14.900
Welcome To G-TV! Today I will be showing you
how to use King Innovation's AlumiConn Series

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:20.990
of Connectors. These connectors can be used
in industrial as well as residential wiring

00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:25.890
when the need to repair aluminum wires is
required. Currently, the Consumer Product

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:32.890
Safety Commission only approves of three methods
for a permanent repair of aluminum wired homes.

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:38.510
The first is a complete rewiring with copper
wires, the second method is pigtailing using

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:44.660
special crimp connectors called COPALUM and
the third is using the lug-type AlumiConn

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:50.020
connectors. Any repairs should be done by
qualified electricians familiar with aluminum

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:56.969
wire problems and repair methods. The AlumiConn
is suitable for aluminum to aluminum, copper

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:02.930
to aluminum and copper to copper wire splices.
For this demonstration, I am using an aluminum

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:08.630
wire, which is already inserted in to the
connection. The second port here can also

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:14.170
have a copper wire or another aluminum wire.
I will insert a copper wire for demonstration

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:19.670
purposes and then tighten the wire using the
nickel plated screws. The third wire I am

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:25.460
using is a copper wire, which can be wired
to my application. If this were a single pole

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:31.329
switch, the copper wire coming from the AlumiConn
connection can connect to the copper plate

00:01:31.329 --> 00:01:37.409
on the side. This type of pigtailing prevents
the aluminum wires from overheating and causing

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:44.090
electrical fires. The copper wire size range
can be from #18 to #10 and the aluminum can

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:50.600
be #12 to #10. King Innovation's AlumiConn
