00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:05.600
Hi I'm Caroline.

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:06.600
And I'm Alejandra.

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:14.750
Today we're making a chocolate peanut butter
pie.

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:19.520
It's very, very easy done in a couple of steps
and just a few ingredients.

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:23.790
So here we have some melted butter and just
a little bit of espresso powder.

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:26.890
Gives it this nice extra flavor.

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:32.369
Some semi-sweet chocolate chips, of course
our Smooth Operator, a little bit of vanilla

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:37.600
extract, confectioners' sugar, milk, softened
cream cheese.

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.449
And we have a couple of garnishes, a little
bit of whipped cream.

00:00:41.449 --> 00:00:45.670
A chocolate crust which is either homemade
or store bought.

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:50.949
So this is actually my very favorite peanut
butter pie recipe from the Peanut Butter &amp; Co.

00:00:50.949 --> 00:00:52.359
Sandwich Shop downtown.

00:00:52.359 --> 00:00:55.449
They shared the recipe with us, so we're going
to share it with you.

00:00:55.449 --> 00:01:00.590
We're going to start by making our first layer
which is chocolate chips, this butter, and

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:02.989
an espresso mixture making a nice little ganache.

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:04.100
Oh I love that.

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:06.979
We're just going to stir this until it comes
together.

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:08.400
Espresso is so great with chocolate.

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:09.780
It really brings out that flavor.

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:13.840
Yea, it offers a little bit of a bitter flavor
in comparison to the peanuts.

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:16.189
I think its a really great secret ingredient.

00:01:16.189 --> 00:01:19.880
Not so secret anymore.

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:20.880
So here we go.

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.810
It's all nice and mixed together.

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:26.950
I'm going to go ahead and pour this into our
pie crust that we made ourselves.

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:30.490
It's a chocolate crumb crust but you could
definitely buy one and that would be just

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:31.490
as great.

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:33.399
So here we go, I'm going to pour it in here.

00:01:33.399 --> 00:01:37.329
I'd probably just eat his all right here.

00:01:37.329 --> 00:01:40.420
We chill this in the freezer until it is nice
and firm for about twenty minutes.

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:41.420
Nice.

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:46.539
So we're going to make our second layer which
of course begins with our Smooth Operator

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:49.179
peanut butter, where the best things do.

00:01:49.179 --> 00:01:51.740
There we go.

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:55.219
And then we're going to add a little bit of
softened cream cheese.

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:57.590
You want to add the confectioners' sugar?

00:01:57.590 --> 00:01:58.590
Sweet.

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:01.270
Milk and vanilla, that'd be great .Alrighty!

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:06.729
We're just going to sort of stir it together
until combined.

00:02:06.729 --> 00:02:10.090
And this is our second layer.

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:11.090
It's gorgeous.

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:12.090
So are you a fan of icebox pie?

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.760
You know what I love about them?

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:15.500
No, that's why I ask.

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:16.500
No baking!

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.160
Nice and easy.

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:22.670
So I like to get this mixture all together
first, just make sure there are no streaks

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.690
of the cream cheese before we fold in this
whipped cream.

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:28.300
So now we can add our whipped cream.

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:33.140
You wanna go ahead and scrape that into the
bowl or at least a little bit just to lighten

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:34.140
it up.

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:35.140
Alright.

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:36.140
There we go.

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.170
I'm just adding a little bit at first just
to lighten up, make this mixture a little

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.640
bit less dense and then I can add the rest.

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:44.640
Alright perfect.

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.400
Now we can go on with the rest.

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:48.530
All of it?

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:49.530
Yea.

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:50.530
Alrighty!

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:51.530
Live dangerously.

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:52.530
So folding is pretty easy.

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:57.050
You just pick up the mixture from underneath
and just do that as quickly as possible and

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:58.880
get the mixture sort of coming together.

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:00.270
So light and fluffy.

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:02.050
And there's nothing you can really do wrong.

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:04.170
I mean it's pretty tasty!

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:08.230
Now you can see it's a nice blended mixture.

00:03:08.230 --> 00:03:11.700
Nice and light and we're going to add this
to our chilled other layer.

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.730
Just go ahead and pour it over top.

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:17.700
It's super easy actually because you can make
it in advance.

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.290
That's great for parties.

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:20.480
Have it ready!

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:21.810
Spread this on top.

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:25.540
And after we spread it on top you can take
those garnishes that you have right there.

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:27.280
We have some peanut butter chips.

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:28.410
Some semi-sweet chips.

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:31.150
And we just sort of sprinkle them on top.

00:03:31.150 --> 00:03:34.670
Can I go ahead and do that?

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:36.180
Yea please do.

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:37.180
Sweet!

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:38.180
Alright!

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:39.180
So you're going to refrigerate this until
you are ready to eat it.

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:42.900
I would say at least an hour just to get it
until it's a little bit firm in order to slice

00:03:42.900 --> 00:03:43.900
it.

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:45.340
So we waited an hour.

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:46.400
It's nice and firm.

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:49.260
So I'm ready to cut a slice.

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:50.720
Are you ready?

00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:52.180
I'm very ready.

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:53.180
So exciting!

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:54.180
Gorgeous!

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:56.210
Look at this expert pie cut!

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:59.510
There you have it, Chocolate Peanut Butter
Pie.

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:01.370
Let's chow down!

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:02.610
Alright!

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:05.100
Delicious, right?

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:10.850
Oh my god, it's so great.

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:13.750
Like the ultimate chocolate peanut butter
pie!

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:14.750
Perfection!

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:18.540
This pie reminds me of how much I love no
bake desserts.

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:22.660
