My name is Carolyn Pioro, and..  currently, I am interning at a custom magazine publishing company.

00:00:23.089 --> 00:00:31.006
Well, right now I, again, I can't sort of text um.. ah.. what else?

00:00:31.006 --> 00:00:36.048
So yeah, recognition.. I'm excited.  I think it will be better with, with Tecla, because

00:00:36.048 --> 00:00:43.063
I do have the opportunity to do voice and um, texting, and soon um, what I've heard

00:00:43.063 --> 00:00:49.075
I'll be able to use, sort of voice, for texting as well as the on screen keyboard.  So there's

00:00:49.078 --> 00:00:54.068
..it's always helpful to have many options.  So right now, with my cell phone, there's just

00:00:54.068 --> 00:00:59.033
the one option to dial out and, to recieve calls, but

00:00:59.033 --> 00:01:03.086
I like that there's a possibility of either texting with keyboard, texting

00:01:03.086 --> 00:01:08.033
with voice, or making phone calls regular styles.

00:01:08.033 --> 00:01:12.024
It's always good to have back up, because

00:01:12.024 --> 00:01:16.002
every situation is different, and there's always one thing that won't work in that situation

00:01:16.002 --> 00:01:21.041
and something that will work better.  With Tecla, and with having the freedom

00:01:21.041 --> 00:01:25.054
of using the phone, I will be able to use Google maps, and I will be able to find directions

00:01:25.054 --> 00:01:30.072
or find alternative Starbucks locations in an emergency.. coffee emergency.

00:01:30.072 --> 00:01:34.085
So I think that's gonna be really helpful, and probably a little bit safer.

00:01:34.085 --> 00:01:40.029
And, yeah.. driving, more pleasurable.

00:01:42.090 --> 00:01:49.043
As in magazines, and working as a fact checker and a copy editor, we have sort of..

00:01:49.043 --> 00:01:53.079
an arsonel of tools.  Be them style guides, or dictionaries..

00:01:53.079 --> 00:02:00.055
and currently the magazine that I am with, they do a lot of food and recipes. So we have a, sort of a food dictionary.

00:02:00.055 --> 00:02:06.058
And, all of my reading is done on e-books. So, if I want to bring my library with me, really I can't.

00:02:06.058 --> 00:02:11.033
Unless I can download on a work computer, and then get my books that way.

00:02:11.033 --> 00:02:16.067
But, I am really excited to have the books be accessible through the phone.
