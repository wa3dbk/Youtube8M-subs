00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:04.990
Bangladesh is one of the most densely
populated countries of the world

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:08.269
with a population of 158 million

00:00:08.269 --> 00:00:13.299
with the growing population establishing
affordable means of connectivity

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:18.369
between people and generating employment
has always been a challenge in Bangladesh

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.300
Mobile communication has helped to
target both these problems

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.290
with a single bullet

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:29.750
This service not only enables over a 120 million mobile

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:32.330
subscribers to connect with each other

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:34.300
anytime anywhere

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:37.890
but also provides livelihood to millions
of merchant

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:43.720
be it airtime and mobile data services

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:47.020
Today people cannot live

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:50.130
without their mobile phones

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:52.440
Ensuring one’s mobile phone is fully recharged

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:56.260
is also a necessity 
People come to me, often in a hurry

00:00:56.260 --> 00:01:00.330
to recharge their phones in seconds

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:05.199
I recharge their phones instantly

00:01:05.199 --> 00:01:09.300
and get a message confirming that the transaction has been processed successfully.

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:15.890
My customer and I are both happy!

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:20.240
Over the past three years, I have never sent

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:23.160
a customer back without servicing him.

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:33.750
Take me as an example

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:36.840
Whenever my prepaid balance dips below 100 Taka,

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.909
my balance is automatically credited.

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:44.729
The system in place is very dependable and offers 100 percent uptime.

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:48.200
I don’t have to call many people. This is unlike, the man running the neighbouring shop

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:53.700
His airtime gets exhausted frequently

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:59.140
and he has to coordinate with too many people.

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:11.380
The best part is

00:02:11.380 --> 00:02:17.240
the extra commissions that we get as a part of the loyalty programme.

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:23.280
For example, if i exceed a target of 40,000 Taka in one month,

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:27.170
we get an additional commission of 1 per cent

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:35.750
With these extra commissions, I have been able to buy a mobile for my son.
