00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:29.730
This is a game about war.

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:34.430
War is about politics, and to bring it full
circle, politics happen in video games all

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:35.430
the time.

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:39.990
Sixteen years ago, in fact...politics led
to a problem that has since become so ingrained

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:42.280
in the industry, it’s become the reality.

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:48.120
A reality we’ve been describing since 1996
with the same tired sentence.

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:51.680
Third-party publishers don’t support Nintendo.

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:55.559
Of course, with that reality in mind, the
importance of this game becomes even more

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:56.559
evident.

00:00:56.559 --> 00:01:00.489
And you start to understand why Nintendo really
wanted this on the Wii U.

00:01:00.489 --> 00:01:05.280
So much so that they courted Activision like
an awkward teenage boy standing next to a

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.720
cute girl’s locker.

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.750
Oh, you want a Classic Controller?

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:10.390
Anything for you, baby!

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:20.530
Just please go to the dance with me!

00:01:20.530 --> 00:01:24.740
And just like a Molly Ringwald movie, this
story has a happy ending.

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:28.100
Because Black Ops 2 is a Wii U launch title.

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.880
And surprisingly, the two are actually dancing.

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:38.000
That is to say...step for step, move for move,
bullet for bullet, this is Black Ops 2.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:44.030
It’s not some watered down Nintendo port,
and in fact, it actually has some advantages.

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:50.450
Obviously, Call of Duty: Black Ops 2 is a
follow-up to the 2010 original.

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:56.510
Which is a follow-up to domination, which
is what Call of Duty has for all intents and

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:57.649
purposes become.

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:02.229
It’s one of the biggest names in gaming,
and Black Ops 2 delivers on its pedigree.

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:05.360
This alone makes it one of the Wii U’s best
launch titles.

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:16.780
And if this is a sign of third-party support
to come...

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:23.069
Black Ops 2 tells a story that spans decades,
jumping from the Cold War to the year 2025.

00:02:23.069 --> 00:02:29.010
Now, story is hardly this game’s selling
point, but I was pleasantly surprised by how

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:30.010
much I cared.

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:34.680
Because the story spans such a long time,
you see it through the eyes of generations

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.700
of soldiers, which gives the narrative surprising
impact.

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.670
Add an interesting villain, and the story
is anything but an afterthought.

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:44.480
And the game itself’s not an afterthought,
either.

00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:50.530
Again, Black Ops 2 is just about the same
on the Wii U as the 360 and PS3, in terms

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:52.280
of both graphics and content.

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:57.230
In fact, the only things this one is missing
are the social features for livestreaming

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:58.950
and Elite functionality.

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:04.340
Everything else is in tact, from the campaign
to the zombies to the multiplayer...which,

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:07.730
by the way, runs just fine on the Wii U.

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:12.209
In fact, to its credit, online is where the
Wii U version makes up ground.

00:03:12.209 --> 00:03:16.819
Using your GamePad, you can use the touch
screen to quickly do things like call in score

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:18.060
streaks and switch classes.

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:23.410
And if you’re doing split-screen online,
you actually don’t have to split the screen.

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:26.590
One player can have the TV screen, and the
other can play on the GamePad.

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:31.310
In fact, you can play the entire game on the
GamePad, which means your friends can go ahead

00:03:31.310 --> 00:03:34.990
and watch My Little Pony while you shoot people
in the face.

00:03:34.990 --> 00:03:37.931
Finally, the roommate wars over TV time may
abate.

00:03:37.931 --> 00:03:46.240
And you know, maybe this game is a sign that
other struggles are ending, too.

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:50.290
It’s promising that the Wii U is launching
not only with Nintendo’s heavy hitter in

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:55.040
Super Mario, but also some of the biggest
names...from third-party publishers.

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:58.950
None bigger or better than Call of Duty: Black
Ops 2.
