00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:09.669
Would you like to know the 
effectiveness of advertising on YouTube?

00:00:09.669 --> 00:00:13.129
We have studied the results of 
eight advertising campaigns for major

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:17.720
brands, shown on television and YouTube, 
with more than 25 thousand 

00:00:17.720 --> 00:00:19.939
interviews.

00:00:19.939 --> 00:00:23.710
The campaigns’ average coverage 
reached 4 million consumers

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:25.169
of the target audience.

00:00:25.169 --> 00:00:29.659
Out of these 4 million consumers, 
2 million were in addition to the

00:00:29.659 --> 00:00:33.170
television coverage, as they had little 
or no exposure to this form of media.

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:36.700
This represented an additional
coverage of 9%.

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:40.810
This study with YouTube 
shows that online video is a

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:44.030
very effective method, not only for
implementing more significant metrics,

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:46.080
but also for achieving additional
campaign coverage 

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:53.080
in a more efficient way.

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:55.690
We even see how in a multimedia campaign,

00:00:55.690 --> 00:00:57.560
which also included advertising
in the press,

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:59.350
and in a target audience less 
accustomed to online media,

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:01.130
individuals between the ages of 35-50,

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:03.100
that this form of media 
provides additional coverage.

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:04.270
Online video works

00:01:04.270 --> 00:01:07.910
and it works particularly well with 
people who do not watch much television.

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:11.230
The results confirm that online
video is here to stay.

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:12.310
We have included it as a strategic part 

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:14.880
of our advertising campaigns.

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.460
Our objective of this campaign, the
launch of Diesel Loverdose,

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:23.040
was to achieve additional coverage and
make an impact on Diesel’s target audience.

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.960
Thus, YouTube has been an ideal 
complement to the television campaign.

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:28.799
Adding YouTube to the television plan

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:32.250
also means an improvement in 
brand-metrics.

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:38.460
On average, the brand’s advertising
awareness increased between 5 and 7%.

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.110
Synergy is increased among those who
are seldom exposed to television

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:48.550
with a 14% increase in image and a 16% 
increase in purchase intention.

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:51.960
It has been interesting to discover 
segments that are seldom exposed to television.

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:54.530
Online video shows some very 
interesting metrics

00:01:54.530 --> 00:02:01.530
with regard to message comprehension 
and purchase intention.

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:04.840
YouTube helps us to be more efficient 
when planning campaigns.

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:07.380
For example, in the case of Decathlon

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:10.089
from 70% of television coverage onwards, 

00:02:10.089 --> 00:02:14.569
YouTube is more efficient in adding
increased coverage.

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:16.329
Especially in the case of Decathlon,

00:02:16.329 --> 00:02:19.809
reaching the same coverage without using
YouTube in the campaign

00:02:19.809 --> 00:02:22.569
would have meant an additional 
television budget of 28%.

00:02:22.569 --> 00:02:25.629
At Sony, for future campaigns,
we have identified

00:02:25.629 --> 00:02:29.899
the need and importance of spending 
more budget on the online world,

00:02:29.899 --> 00:02:32.859
particularly on YouTube

00:02:32.859 --> 00:02:34.569
due to the results achieved

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:36.310
on a quantitative and qualitative scale.
