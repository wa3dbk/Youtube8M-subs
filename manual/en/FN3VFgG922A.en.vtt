00:00:02.010 --> 00:00:06.660
This is the Empire State Building. With 102
floors, it's one of the tallest buildings in the US.

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.760
But it's 4 floors shorter than the MSC Oscar.
Which isn't a building, but a boat: The largest

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:14.040
container ship in the world.

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:18.920
Launched in January 2015, the MSC Oscar is nearly the size of four football fields laid end-to-end.

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:22.550
It has a draft of 16 meters, which means that
if you were to stand at the bottom of the

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:25.300
ship, you'd be 5 stories underwater.

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:29.240
It's one of 5000 container ships crossing
the world's oceans, carrying the vast majority

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:33.100
of products you buy and the parts those products
were made from. These ships are the engine

00:00:33.100 --> 00:00:38.440
of the global economy, but 60 years ago, they
didn't even exist.

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:42.800
How did all this happen? For hundreds of years,
shipping was a bit of a nightmare. Goods had

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:48.020
to be unloaded into storage at ports, then individually packed onto ships and unpacked afterwards.

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.979
This process was painfully slow and expensive, and it left items vulnerable to damage and theft.

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:58.179
In 1956, Malcom McLean, an American trucking
executive, proved that you could save time

00:00:58.179 --> 00:01:02.489
and money by loading truck containers directly
onto ships. On the other side they'd be put back

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.760
onto trucks or trains, and reach their
destination without ever being opened.

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:10.460
McLean later got the government on board by
using containerized service to help the military

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:12.680
provide supplies for the Vietnam War.

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:20.580
"Some of the more notable innovations in solving the logistical problems in Vietnam have been in the field of containerization"

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:25.500
After the industry recognized how efficient
container shipping was, the use of container ships exploded.

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.090
International standardization was the key. The unit of measurement is TEU, or twenty-foot

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:33.840
equivalent. Most containers used today are
twice as long.

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.000
Shippers quickly realized that the larger
the boat, the cheaper the shipping price per

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.670
container. So the size of the largest ships has
grown exponentially.

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:44.990
In 1999, a shipping executive predicted an
eventual ceiling of 12,000 TEU. 

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:48.340
But the MSC Oscar has a capacity of over 19,000.

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:51.710
To accommodate these huge ships, ports have
been rebuilt, with vast yards to store the

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:56.800
containers and huge cranes to load and unload
them simultaneously, in a specific order.

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.990
Today's biggest ships are so huge that they
can't actually fit through the Panama canal

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:04.360
or dock at any American port. They're used
mostly for shipping between Europe and Asia.

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.820
It's hard to overstate how much all this has
transformed the world economy. 

00:02:06.820 --> 00:02:12.940
After containerization, global trade in merchandise
soared while insurance costs and inventories decreased.

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:16.819
Jobs at ports and in factories in the U.S.
dropped while consumers gained access to a

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:19.200
greater variety of products at a lower price.

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:23.079
As a result, products we buy can be made with parts from several different countries, by people

00:02:23.079 --> 00:02:24.249
on the other side of the world.

00:02:24.249 --> 00:02:27.680
And it's hard to imagine any of this happening
without someone first deciding to put the

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:30.640
stuff in a box and put the box on a boat.
