So every year since 1970

00:00:09.208 --> 00:00:12.245
a different national forest has 
the U S Capital Christmas Tree.

00:00:12.245 --> 00:00:15.248 align:start position:0%
That is no easy task. 

00:00:15.248 --> 00:00:18.284
So our staff has come together 

00:00:18.284 --> 00:00:21.354 align:start position:0%
with folks from the Leech Lake
Band of Ojibwee

00:00:21.354 --> 00:00:24.524
Choose Outdoors, and a myriad 
of different community partners

00:00:24.524 --> 00:00:27.526 align:start position:0%
to create a moment
that will be magical 

00:00:27.526 --> 00:00:30.596 size:78% position:39%
for the next generation. 

00:00:30.596 --> 00:00:33.632 align:start position:0%
I'm Erica Johnsrud I teach here 
Cass Lake Bena Elementary
School. 

00:00:33.632 --> 00:00:36.635 align:start position:0%
Right now we are working on dift
ornaments that we are creating
for 

00:00:36.635 --> 00:00:39.705 align:start position:0%
the Capital Christmas Tree that 
going to Washington DC. 

00:00:39.705 --> 00:00:41.173 align:start position:0%
Hi I'm Tamiyah and
I'm in 3rd grade.

00:00:41.173 --> 00:00:45.745 align:start position:0%
Here's an ornament I made. 
I want my 

00:00:45.745 --> 00:00:48.781 align:start position:0%
neighbors and friends
and relatives to know that 

00:00:48.781 --> 00:00:51.784 align:start position:0%
it was hard work and
I made it by myself. 

00:00:51.784 --> 00:00:54.820 align:start position:0%
My name is TrayVaughn Lee and
I am from Cass Lake, MN. 

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:57.857 align:start position:0%
I got one of my dream catchers
that 

00:00:57.857 --> 00:01:00.893
I made. We made two one for the 

00:01:00.893 --> 00:01:02.395 size:81% position:41%
capital and one for home. 

00:01:02.395 --> 00:01:07.033 align:start position:0%
It feels great because 
I really never 

00:01:07.033 --> 00:01:10.069 align:start position:0%
ever had anything go
to anywhere else

00:01:10.069 --> 00:01:13.105 size:75% position:38%
besides home and stuff. 

00:01:13.105 --> 00:01:16.142 size:78% position:39%
Well I mostly helped with
making the dream catchers

00:01:16.142 --> 00:01:19.178 align:start position:0%
cause I had history 
making dream catchers. 

00:01:19.178 --> 00:01:22.215 align:start position:0%
I did the pinecones 
and it is really cool 

00:01:22.215 --> 00:01:25.251 align:start position:0%
to see how the kids
did their own little thing

00:01:25.251 --> 00:01:28.321
and none of them are the same. 

00:01:28.321 --> 00:01:31.423
Hi! I'm Mary LaPlant and my job

00:01:31.423 --> 00:01:32.925 align:start position:0%
is tree team lead. 

00:01:32.925 --> 00:01:37.463 align:start position:0%
So I'm working with a number 
of people on the Chippewa

00:01:37.463 --> 00:01:40.533
and we are looking for the tree 

00:01:40.533 --> 00:01:43.503 align:start position:0%
that will go out there 
and stand on the lawn. 

00:01:46.606 --> 00:01:49.642
It's not the Hollywood version 

00:01:49.642 --> 00:01:52.645 align:start position:0%
of a Christmas tree. 

00:01:52.645 --> 00:01:55.681 align:start position:0%
But it's a good Minnesota versi 
This is by far

00:01:55.681 --> 00:01:58.751 align:start position:0%
the biggest base one I think
on the candidate list. 

00:01:58.751 --> 00:02:01.787 align:start position:0%
That is a big tree. 

00:02:01.787 --> 00:02:04.890 align:start position:0%
It's cool, alright. 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.060 align:start position:0%
Definitely been hugged.
That's been here 

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:11.097 align:start position:0%
a while. That is pretty
impressive I like the space

00:02:11.097 --> 00:02:14.200 align:start position:0%
of it. Some of the other
ones were very 

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:17.369 align:start position:0%
small and this one 
has some stoutness. 

00:02:17.369 --> 00:02:18.871 align:start position:0%
They will be happy to come
look at this in July. 

00:02:18.871 --> 00:02:23.443 align:start position:0%
It will be a blast. One of 
the most fun aspects 

00:02:23.443 --> 00:02:26.479
of this project is when we get o
invite folks from Washington DC

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:29.481 size:88% position:44%
out to our national forest. 

00:02:29.481 --> 00:02:32.518
And to have folks from the Washn
office tromp through the woods 

00:02:32.518 --> 00:02:35.588
with you, look at trees and to 

00:02:35.588 --> 00:02:38.590 align:start position:0%
have a conversation
around a happy positive 

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:41.627 align:start position:0%
product is so much fun. 
So one of the 

00:02:41.627 --> 00:02:44.630 align:start position:0%
great things about this particu 
journey is we have over 

00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:47.667 align:start position:0%
34 events across the country.
And we've talked

00:02:47.667 --> 00:02:50.702 align:start position:0%
to literally thousands of people
about this Capital Christmas
Tree

00:02:50.702 --> 00:02:53.739 align:start position:0%
and at a time when I think our 
country has so many pulling

00:02:53.739 --> 00:02:55.307 align:start position:0%
us apart; right and left, 
republican democrat.

00:02:55.307 --> 00:03:00.013
This is truly an opportunity
to come together as a community

00:03:00.013 --> 00:03:03.049 align:start position:0%
and as a nation. 
The Capital Christmas Tree

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:06.085 size:78% position:39%
has a long time standing 
of building relationships

00:03:06.085 --> 00:03:09.188
within the communities and that 

00:03:09.188 --> 00:03:12.224 size:81% position:41%
is something that I think 
will be a lasting legacy

00:03:12.224 --> 00:03:15.260 align:start position:0%
with these events. Knowing thatr
children made a thousand
ornaments 

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.331 align:start position:0%
and they are going to 
Washington DC. It's going to be 

00:03:18.331 --> 00:03:21.367 align:start position:0%
really a good circle. 
To see the beginning 

00:03:21.367 --> 00:03:24.404 align:start position:0%
knowing that the tree was comin 
from the Chippewa National
Forest.

00:03:24.404 --> 00:03:27.439 align:start position:0%
And for our children to 
make those ornaments

00:03:27.439 --> 00:03:30.476 align:start position:0%
and to see them on this
little tree at the tree

00:03:30.476 --> 00:03:33.479 size:84% position:42%
cutting ceremony. It really
brings it all together. 

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:36.515 size:84% position:42%
So I will be with the crew 
that is actually delivering

00:03:36.515 --> 00:03:39.551 align:start position:0%
the companion tree to the offic.
I'm traveling with the tree
the whole way

00:03:39.551 --> 00:03:42.588 align:start position:0%
Have fun! Take good care of our
tree! 

00:03:42.588 --> 00:03:45.624 align:start position:0%
Will do. Alright.
