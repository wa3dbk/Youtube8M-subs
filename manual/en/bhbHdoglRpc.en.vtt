Hello everyone this is Breanna Rutter author
of one of my most popular books the natural

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:18.250
hair Bible and founder of howtoblackhair.com
and for these videos I love to answer the

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:23.019
questions you all send me via email so you
have any questions that you will like for

00:00:23.019 --> 00:00:29.180
me to answer be sure to check out the description
box below for additional information so this

00:00:29.180 --> 00:00:35.620
video today is because of an email Monica
sent me Monica says that she has a hair type

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:40.730
of either 4a or 3c and she wants to start
wearing weaves but she's not sure how to get

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:45.760
the weaves to blend with her curl pattern
without having to use a lot of heat or manipulation

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:51.079
to do so of course so many people want to
versatility with their natural curls and I

00:00:51.079 --> 00:00:55.800
can offer you some tips Monica on what you
can do to help your weaves work for you so

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:01.280
my very first tip is for the fact if you decide
that you want to wear braids or twists if

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:05.510
you want to or braids or twists you don't
really have to worry about that textural work

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:10.720
curl of your extension but I do wanted to
match the texture of your hair more so than

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:16.560
it is that you have to buy curly braiding
hair to do your braids or twists so my suggestion

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:22.100
that I suggest for you will depend on how
your hair feels if your hair feels like it

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:27.450
is more of a silk grade then I suggest that
you use Toyokalon hair to do your braids or

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:32.399
twists but at the texture of your hair feels
more of a kinkier more of a coarser feel to

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:37.740
your hair then I suggest that you use kanekalon
hair to do your braids or twists and my second

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:43.299
tip goes for the fact that you have to try
out a lot of different extensions if you decide

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:48.130
you want to use extensions to sew or clip
onto your hair so I want you to do a search

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:53.759
around online or either at your local beauty
supply store for hair that mimics the natural

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:58.200
curl of what your real hair looks like so
that way when you add the extensions into

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:03.719
your hair it blends best without having to
use heat or use a lot of manipulation to get

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:08.289
it to do so and then my last and final tip
for helping you to where weaves that will

00:02:08.289 --> 00:02:13.420
go great with your hair is to think about
making a u part or an L part wigs and I'm

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:19.319
not sure how long you want to keep the extensions
in your hair so that's why a u part or an

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:23.970
l part wig will give you the versatility to
take it off and put it right back on instantly

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:28.681
if you want to have more length or volume
depending on you know why you want to wear

00:02:28.681 --> 00:02:34.810
extensions in the first place so in my description
box out some links to the DVDs that I teaches

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:40.060
as far as how to make your own upart or lpart
wig as well as how to blend your natural hair

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:44.620
with your extensions for your desired look
like give you so many tips on different things

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:49.159
you can do like if you want to where braids
or twist or if you want to weave in your hair

00:02:49.159 --> 00:02:53.130
and things that you want to do to make sure
that you're able to find the hair this going

00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:57.980
to work best for you so you just have to go
through just a little bit of trial and error

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:03.409
