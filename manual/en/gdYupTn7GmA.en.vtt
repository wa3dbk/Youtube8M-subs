He everyone welcome to The Wolfe Pit.

00:00:01.251 --> 00:00:05.501
Today I'm going to show you how easy it is to make smoky, moist and tender and very delicious

00:00:05.501 --> 00:00:08.351
pulled pork on a Rec-Tec pellet grill.

00:00:08.351 --> 00:00:10.501
This is the easiest pulled pork you'll ever
make.

00:00:10.501 --> 00:00:11.521
So let's get started!

00:00:11.521 --> 00:00:16.541
Here I have a 10 lb bone in Boston butt that
I'm going to very generously season with Wolfe

00:00:16.541 --> 00:00:18.481
Rub Original BBQ seasoning.

00:00:18.481 --> 00:00:24.621
You can use whatever kind of Barbecue rub
you like.

00:00:24.621 --> 00:00:27.271
I like to season my pork right before it goes
on the smoker.

00:00:27.271 --> 00:00:31.651
But you can season the night before if you
like.

00:00:31.651 --> 00:00:35.190
For this cook I'm going to use the small Rec-Tec,
which is the RT-300.

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.471
I'm going to preheat it to 250ยบ, which is
just a matter of pushing a couple buttons.

00:00:40.471 --> 00:00:45.401
15 minutes later we're at 250ยบ and I've added
the pork shoulder.

00:00:45.401 --> 00:00:49.921
If you noticed I have it fat side down, that's
just my preferred method for Boston butts.

00:00:49.921 --> 00:00:54.780
Now I'm going to close the lid and let the
Rec-Tec do it's thing!

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.721
Here's the pork after 5 hours, it's coming
along nicely and smells even better.

00:00:58.721 --> 00:01:03.471
I went ahead and added the meat probe.

00:01:03.471 --> 00:01:09.541
After smoking for 10 hours at 250ยบ the BBQ
pork is at 198ยบ and it's done.

00:01:09.541 --> 00:01:12.461
Just look at that bark!

00:01:22.171 --> 00:01:24.661
Look at how tender the meat is underneath
the bark!

00:01:28.711 --> 00:01:31.461
There's all the rendered pork fat, all you
have to do it let it cool and dump it out.

00:01:40.481 --> 00:01:44.991
To give you an idea of how efficient the Rec-Tec's
are, this is a 15 lb hopper and I might have

00:01:44.991 --> 00:01:50.241
used at most, 10 lbs of pellets.

00:01:50.241 --> 00:02:05.360
I've let the pork rest a little over an hour
to cool, now I'm going to pull it.

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:08.161
Look at how fall apart tender this is.

A clean bone is always a good sign!

00:02:30.881 --> 00:02:37.590
Once all the pork is pulled add more Barbeque
seasoning.

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.761
Give it a good mix to get all the pork and
rub combined and you're ready to eat!!

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:46.100
Make your pulled pork sandwich how ever you
like!

00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:51.361
I like mine on a kaiser roll, homemade cole
slaw and whole lot of Texas Pete hot sauce!

00:03:07.441 --> 00:03:11.870
There you have it, simple easy, smoky and
delicious pulled pork!

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:14.590
Thank you all very much for watching I hope
you give this a try.
