How to Sell a Car on eBay.

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:10.120
Broaden your market and sell your used car
the modern way by auctioning it off or selling

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:11.570
it on eBay.

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:19.300
You will need Internet access Bank account
or credit card Camera Vehicle description

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:26.560
VIN number Vehicle sale documents and sale
or reserve price (optional).

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:27.560
Step 1.

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:32.640
Create a seller's account at motors.ebay.com,
and provide a bank account or credit card

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.030
that your seller's fees will be deducted from.

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:40.510
Gather documentation such as the vehicle title
and a bill of sale early, so you will be ready

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:42.390
to complete the sale.

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:43.390
Step 2.

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:47.039
Determine the value of your vehicle using
an online guide.

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:48.210
Step 3.

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:51.420
Take digital color photos of the car from
every angle.

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:57.170
Don't forget photos of the interior, odometer,
and any blemishes or defects.

00:00:57.170 --> 00:00:58.199
Step 4.

00:00:58.199 --> 00:01:02.219
Decide if you want to hold an auction to sell
your car to the highest bidder, or set a fixed

00:01:02.219 --> 00:01:03.219
sale price.

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:05.420
Keep the price low enough to make a sale.

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:10.330
For auctions, eBay lets you set a starting
price at which bidding begins, and a reserve

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:13.810
price, which is a hidden minimum price at
which you are willing to sell.

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:17.910
It is possible to revise your pricing requirements
while bidding is active.

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:19.020
Step 5.

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:23.360
Create a listing on eBay Motors, including
a description of the vehicle and its condition,

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.869
the VIN number, and photos.

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:28.670
Be honest about any major problems with the
car.

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:33.080
Disclosing the information up front will save
you and the buyer from an unhappy experience

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:34.090
later.

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:35.340
Step 6.

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:37.690
Make your terms of sale clear in the listing.

00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:43.280
Describe acceptable forms of payment, deposit
requirements, and delivery or pickup options.

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:44.280
Step 7.

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:49.039
Check in frequently on the My eBay page to
monitor bidding activity, contact potential

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:53.380
buyers, and respond to inquiries once your
listing is active.

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:54.830
Step 8.

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:58.599
Contact the winning bidder when the listing
expires to close the deal and arrange payment

00:01:58.599 --> 00:02:00.780
and transfer of the vehicle and title.

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:01.780
Congratulations!

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:07.720
Did you know In 2004, a man got bids for his
ex-wife's wedding gown on eBay for more than

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:12.920
three times its original price by posting
a photo of himself wearing the dress.
