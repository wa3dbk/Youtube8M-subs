00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:30.080
No, no, it’s exactly the Berk I probably
remember.

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:31.119
One island?

00:00:31.119 --> 00:00:32.439
Five minigames?

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:35.300
More rings than every Olympics ever?

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:37.710
Tell me again how this probably isn’t the
Berk I remember.

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:38.970
Go ahead, say it again.

00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:41.850
Say it one more goddamn time.

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:54.240
Oh, you’re gonna know my name is the Lord,
How To Train Your Dragon 2.

00:00:54.240 --> 00:01:05.470
Hey, so what have you guys accomplished this
year?

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:07.010
Maybe graduate from school?

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:08.400
Get your first job?

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.230
Platinum some stupid game?

00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:12.430
Oh, congratulations, you busy little beaver.

00:01:12.430 --> 00:01:14.100
Hey, guess what I’ve been doing.

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.970
Reviewing every f*cking version of How To
Train Your Dragon 2 in the world.

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:23.960
Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, Nintendo 3DS, yeah,
I’ve reviewed those.

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:25.340
I’ve reviewed all of those.

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:26.340
And listen to me now.

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:27.620
You know, I used to be just like you.

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:28.620
Listen to me now.

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:29.620
Is this what you want out of life?

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:30.750
To be like this?

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:34.950
I am an empty husk of man, teetering on the
edge of sanity.

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.200
That’s what I’ve done this year.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.300
So why stop now?

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:53.450
It’s already the worst year of my life,
let’s fly through some more rings.

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:54.979
I hate this game, you guys.

00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:59.780
I hate it more than I hate myself, which is
a lot, because who puts themselves through

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:00.940
this?

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:02.340
What kind of asshole does that?

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:04.030
I’ll tell you what kind of asshole—me.

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:05.030
I do.

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:09.280
This is the fourth time I’ve played and
reviewed How To Train Your Dragon 2, and what’s

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:12.639
amazing is that my hatred has somehow grown.

00:02:12.639 --> 00:02:14.790
That’s actually pretty unbelievable.

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:19.230
That’s, like…a humpback whale starts wearing
lifts.

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:22.409
No reason to do it, already the biggest animal
on the planet…

00:02:22.409 --> 00:02:24.030
But what are you gonna do about it?

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:25.030
I’ll tell you what.

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:36.430
You’re gonna fly through the rings and shut
your damn mouth.

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:41.340
How To Train Your Dragon 2 is a collection
of about five minigames.

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.819
I say “about” because they’re so goddamn
similar, it’s impossible to tell where one

00:02:45.819 --> 00:02:46.909
ends and the next begins.

00:02:46.909 --> 00:02:50.069
Which is kind of like someone’s who’s
been ripped apart by a dragon.

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:53.379
It’s tough to tell where one corpse ends
and the next one begins.

00:02:53.379 --> 00:02:58.409
It’s just a mess of catastrophe and regret,
and death.

00:02:58.409 --> 00:02:59.999
Coincidentally, so is this.

00:02:59.999 --> 00:03:02.219
Minigame one, you fly through rings.

00:03:02.219 --> 00:03:03.840
Minigame two, you pick sheep.

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.409
Minigame three, you pick up sheep…while
flying through rings.

00:03:07.409 --> 00:03:09.219
Minigame four, you shoot vikings.

00:03:09.219 --> 00:03:11.610
Minigame five…you fly through more rings.

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:15.890
So really, it’s three minigames stretched
into five.

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:18.069
All of which, stretch your sanity.

00:03:18.069 --> 00:03:20.569
I hate this game, you guys.

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:25.709
So you fly around the island, you land on
these little perches…they start a minigame.

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:30.060
So you play it, stuff happens…and then you
just fly around some more.

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:31.939
Go to the next perch.

00:03:31.939 --> 00:03:33.180
Sounds pretty eventful, huh?

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:34.859
Yeah, it truly is.

00:03:34.859 --> 00:03:35.859
With all three of the minigames.

00:03:35.859 --> 00:03:37.840
Hey, want to hear the coolest part of all?

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:41.069
There are times when you have to play them
all, in succession.

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:47.400
No joke, doing that…it challenges everything
you think you know about time.

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.529
Because the minutes literally feel like hours.

00:03:50.529 --> 00:03:52.760
This feels like five hours, playing this race.

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:54.159
Your head starts hurting.

00:03:54.159 --> 00:03:56.029
Your stomach starts turning.

00:03:56.029 --> 00:03:58.029
Your psychosis starts growing.

00:03:58.029 --> 00:03:59.999
Oh, one more time.

00:03:59.999 --> 00:04:03.519
Say it one more goddamn time.

00:04:03.519 --> 00:04:10.329
Oh, you’re gonna know my name is the Lord,
How To Train Your Dragon 2.

00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:11.969
Did I already say that?

00:04:11.969 --> 00:04:12.969
I don’t know.

00:04:12.969 --> 00:04:27.699
Look, I don’t want to talk about this anymore.

00:04:27.699 --> 00:04:28.699
Have a heart, you guys.

00:04:28.699 --> 00:04:30.080
You want to know more about this game?

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:31.199
Trust me, you don’t.

00:04:31.199 --> 00:04:33.889
But if you think you do, watch my other reviews.

00:04:33.889 --> 00:04:39.800
There is, seriously…more than 20 minutes
of video, on the Internet, right now…of

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:41.449
me talking about this game.

00:04:41.449 --> 00:04:48.770
Discussing the awful gameplay, the nauseating
camera, the ugly graphics and the despicable

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:52.069
sound…dude, I didn’t know sound could
be despicable.

00:04:52.069 --> 00:04:56.400
I caught this sound trying to steal my wallet,
I think.

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:59.370
Which is, like…the definition of despicable.

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:01.720
That’s despicable.

00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:04.180
I’m really losing it, you guys.

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:07.699
It’s How To Train Your Dragon 2, for the
Nintendo Wii U.

00:05:07.699 --> 00:05:11.970
I’d tell you this game sucks and you shouldn’t
buy it, but if I have to tell you that, I

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:13.340
don’t want to tell you that.

00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:16.479
Baby zebras can walk, like, ten seconds after
they’re born.

00:05:16.479 --> 00:05:20.330
Don’t make me baby you, least of all on
Berk.

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:25.110
Oh my god…
