00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:07.971
During the plasmid miniprep we are going to
grow cultures of&nbsp;E.coli&nbsp;cells, lyse them,

00:00:07.971 --> 00:00:08.971
and isolate plasmid DNA.

00:00:08.971 --> 00:00:09.971
Plasmid miniprep protocol:
* Prepare numbered cell culture tubes with

00:00:09.971 --> 00:00:10.971
4 ml of liquid LB medium and appropriate antibiotic
* Pick colonies from a plate and inoculate

00:00:10.971 --> 00:00:11.971
media in the numbered tubes
* Incubate the culture tubes in a shaker at

00:00:11.971 --> 00:00:12.971
37&nbsp;oC overnight
* On the next day, save 1 ml of culture in

00:00:12.971 --> 00:00:22.405
a separate Eppendorf tube (for clone library)
* Spin down the remaining 3 ml of culture

00:00:22.405 --> 00:00:23.405
and proceed with plasmid miniprep kit

00:00:23.405 --> 00:00:27.110
The only task for Day 2 is to start the miniprep
cultures. Here I prepared three cell culture

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:31.690
tubes with 4 ml of liquid LB medium with ampicillin
in each of them.

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:37.790
Right now I am going to inoculate the colonies
from the plates into the tubes. I open tube

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:56.790
one, pick a colony with a pipette tip 
and inoculate it into the tube. I repeat the

00:00:56.790 --> 00:01:06.680
same procedure for the other two tubes.

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:18.890
The culture tubes are incubated overnight
in a 37&nbsp;oC shaker.

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:23.130
We are now on the Day 3 of our cloning protocol.
Right here on the bench I have the overnight

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:26.360
cultures of&nbsp;E.coli&nbsp;which I am going to use
for plasmid miniprep.

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:31.540
But first, I am going to take 1 ml out of
each of these culture tubes and save it in

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:39.409
a separate Eppendorf tube. Later today, after
I verify the clones by restriction digest,

00:01:39.409 --> 00:01:46.400
I will freeze these cultures in my Frozen
Clone Collection.

00:01:46.400 --> 00:02:06.340
Now I am going to proceed with a plasmid miniprep
kit to isolate DNA from these cultures. If

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:10.509
you used the plasmid miniprep kits before,
fast forward to the next step.

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:14.200
First, I pellet the cells by spinning the
culture tubes in a centrifuge.

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:30.400
Here I have the pelleted cultures and now
I am going to use standard miniprep kit (in

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.290
this case it is an AccuPrep Plasmid MiniPrep
kit from Bioneer), which consists of several

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:37.090
buffers and columns, to isolate the plasmids.

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:50.870
I start by discarding the supernatant from
each of the tubes. Then I add 250 µl of a

00:02:50.870 --> 00:03:10.849
resuspension buffer. Then I resuspend the
pelleted cells and transfer to new Eppendorf

00:03:10.849 --> 00:03:16.299
tubes.

00:03:16.299 --> 00:03:34.729
Now I am going to add 250 µl of a lysis buffer
and mix the solution by gently flipping over

00:03:34.729 --> 00:03:45.879
the tubes.

00:03:45.879 --> 00:04:04.519
Then I add 350 µl of neutralization buffer
to each of the tubes 

00:04:04.519 --> 00:04:08.139
and again mix the solutions by gently flipping
over the tubes.

00:04:08.139 --> 00:04:12.979
You can see that there is a cottage cheese-like
formation in the tubes, which we are going

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:26.229
to separate by spinning the tube for 10 minutes
in 

00:04:26.229 --> 00:04:27.259
a microcentrifuge.

00:04:27.259 --> 00:04:45.870
Then I transfer the supernatants to spin columns,
spin 1 minute in a centrifuge, discard the

00:04:45.870 --> 00:04:47.919
flow through and add a wash buffer with ethanol.

00:04:47.919 --> 00:06:02.310
I spin it for 1 minute in a centrifuge again,
discard the ethanol, and spin one more time.
