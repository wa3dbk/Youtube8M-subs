00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:12.140
My name is Buddy Rhodes and we've made this countertop using my concrete mix,

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:15.020
and my signature pressed surface.

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:18.820
I mean, I love it, but I don't want to talk anyone else into using it.

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:22.500
and I feel that most people when they try it they like it too.

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:30.520
But that's... I'm not a salesman I'm
more of a craftsman, inventor.

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:49.100
Long long ago I went to the Art Institute after being a potter in upstate New York.

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:54.420
And then just kind of overwhelmed all their kilns.

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.680
So I developed this mix, this concrete
mix that is very clay like.

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:03.040
I like working with my hands.

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:10.800
I like making functional objects, so I develop this mix design using white cement,

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:16.040
most mixes are gray so this colors really well.

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:22.040
It's part of our complete system. We've kind of have been the mad scientists for you,

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:28.940
So you can take that and add to it rather than just spending your time working out the basics.

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:36.800
So we mix this fairly dry, very
clay like, and I'm putting down just a half-inch layer.

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:42.520
You can work it up a vertical wall which is very unusual for concrete,

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:48.200
Usually you'd need a two-sided mold and suspend your reinforcement in there.

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:54.040
With this it's very clay like and you can just pack it against the inside of the mold and it sticks.

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:58.400
There's so many different ways that you can mix the concrete and finish the concrete,

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:04.740
from right side up you can hand trowel it to get that beautiful buttery hand troweling look,

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:10.300
or you can polish it out to reveal the aggregates within the mix,

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:17.600
or cast it upside down and pack it and fill the voids with the same color slurry or a contrasting color.

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:25.320
It's very user friendly you can make it
work up a wall like... I like to call it "The Wall Crawler".

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:31.140
A lot of concrete mixes you have to wait three or four days in order for you to turn it over.

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:37.140
Well depending on the day, how hot or cold it is, it's usually about nine hours or so.

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:41.700
Most times people have a very successful project the first one that they do,

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:48.160
and I get lots of emails and photos and look at the fireplace mantel I just made. And it's really exciting.

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:52.420
We really want to celebrate the hand
and the craft.

00:02:52.420 --> 00:03:00.240
In today's world everything is mass-produced by a machine we're trying to do everything we can to not have that.

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:04.700
That is a handmade product for a
custom project,

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:11.920
and that's what really gives us its beauty and took the hand of the craftsmen.
