Hey everyone! You might have facing the
problem while booting your yu yureka

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:14.120
Let me show you

00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:21.180
You can see my phone is stuck at the Yu logo and is not starting as usual

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:28.040
and some of you having this Android loading graphics while booting probably, not for all

00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:32.740
and boom doesn't start at all and the Yu logo again

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:38.920
So first of all what you need to do is to
just remove the battery to completely turn off your device

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:41.720
and then just
replace it

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.720
Now connect your phone to the PC using the USB cable

00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:56.140
And basically wait before moving on let me tell you some of the important things

00:00:56.140 --> 00:00:59.980
and instruction that you need to go on further

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:04.680
So firstly I need to notify you
that this video is all about unbricking

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.660
soft bricked phone not for heart bricked
basically

00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:10.740
In simple words your phone should be able to boot into the fastboot mode

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:14.280
I hope you understand what I mean to say

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:20.500
Ok so download these two files before going on. I have leave the link for them down below in the description

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:24.580
so check them out before going on

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:29.320
From now I gonna have you guys installed ADB drivers so just double click the a to be set up and just hit run

00:01:29.320 --> 00:01:31.999
I'm going to try
and keep everything simple for you guys

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.160
so that you can have everything right on
your PC

00:01:35.440 --> 00:01:37.260
it will open this up

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:39.020
As you can right here

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:43.840
I will hit Y and enter to go on and again Y and enter

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:51.600
And setup is going to pop up right now I hope you all know how to install a setup so just install it

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:55.420
Nnow you're gonna need to
extract the softbrick rar

00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:58.640
So I'm gonna to extract it right onto this folder

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:06.680
now on your phone what you need to do is holding the volume up key just pluck on the device to your PC

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:10.840
and thereafter try tapping the power key without leaving the volume up key

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:14.960
Now I have my
phone connected to PC

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:19.700
I will just run last flash.bat file to install the stock recovery

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.160
So I'm gonna double tap that

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.920
oh yeah you will see some of the process going on for few seconds and then

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.460
It will disappear letting you know that
everything is fine

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:38.180
if that's not working try running flash
thought that as administration and that should work fine

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:42.220
you can just connect
your phone now at the moment

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:48.300
And now you can open the recovery.

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:53.780
So press volume up/down key and the power key all together until the phone
vibrates

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:58.500
now it should open the recovery, so

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:07.640
you have to delete all the user data so
so like wipe data/factory reset

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:12.360
Just select that and yes delete all the user
data

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:20.720
leave it for a while and then you reboot the
system manually

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:22.600
and that's all

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:26.540
All fine now, your phone should start normally

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:33.620
