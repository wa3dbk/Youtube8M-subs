00:00:01.270 --> 00:00:04.910
1965, and the Ford Transit is born in Europe.

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:10.670
It was a new kind of van -- tough, flexible
and affordable, the start of nearly 50 years

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:16.160
of helping people move their stuff and Help
by The Beatles defined the year -- one of

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:22.330
the most iconic music albums of all time.

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:29.670
In 1971, the Transit got a facelift thanks
to a new front end -- and some new technologies,

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:36.030
including a high-speed diesel engine, while
Texas Instruments launched the world's first

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:39.710
pocket calculator -- for those with big enough
pockets!

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:46.079
By 1976, more than a million customers all
over Europe had fallen in love with the Transit.

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:51.110
And so two years later Ford gave them more
of what they loved -- the Transit was updated

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:56.850
with six different body shapes, two lengths,
loads of new engines, all wrapped up in a

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:07.299
stylish new design -- almost as stylish as
John Travolta in Saturday Night Fever.

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:12.610
In 1986 a daring new Transit with its advanced,
streamlined shape took van owners' breath

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:18.450
away pushing van design to a new level, while
Maverick and his mates Top Gunned their way

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.149
to victory.

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:25.179
Over three million Transits were in customers'
hands by 1994, and a new model brought commercial

00:01:25.179 --> 00:01:30.380
and passenger vehicles closer together, adopting
car-like technologies such as central locking

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:35.859
and airbags for the first time, just as the
UK was brought closer to the Continent with

00:01:35.859 --> 00:01:38.799
the opening of the Channel Tunnel.

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:43.619
New millennium, new Transit -- just in time
for the 4 millionth van to hit the road, and

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:49.009
for the first time it was front wheel drive,
making it easier to load thanks to a lower

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:50.009
floor.

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:53.529
Computer users were worried about loading
too -- they feared the Millennium Bug was

00:01:53.529 --> 00:01:57.569
going to bite but it didn't even bark...

00:01:57.569 --> 00:02:03.179
The 2006 Transit introduced all-wheel-drive,
making it the clear winner for International

00:02:03.179 --> 00:02:04.569
Van of the Year.

00:02:04.569 --> 00:02:10.030
Meantime, scientists bagged all sorts of awards
for unscrambling the spaghetti of life in

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:12.490
the Human Genome Project.

00:02:12.490 --> 00:02:17.350
2012 and the latest chapter in the glorious
history of the Transit began.

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:23.630
Ford showed off the next-generation Transit,
which'll be sold in 118 markets on six continents.

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:29.560
And in June 2013, the 7 millionth Transit
rolled off the production line.

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:34.180
Parked end-to-end, they'd stretch from London
to Sydney, Australia and back again.

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:39.750
The iconic Ford Transit -- the backbone of
business for five decades.
