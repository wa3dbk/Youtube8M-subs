Hello, and welcome to this presentation of Voice-O-Matic Maya edition

00:00:06.802 --> 00:00:16.647
Voice-O-Matic is an easy to use plugin that automates the creation of lipsync animation directly inside of 3D programs you are already familiar with, like Maya.

00:00:16.794 --> 00:00:18.205
Let's take a look at how it works

00:00:18.481 --> 00:00:26.179
Once we have a character created with any type of facial rig either blend shapes, bone rigs or whatever the type of setup desired.

00:00:26.322 --> 00:00:30.716
We can just connect it to Voice-O-Matic to automatically create the lipsync.

00:00:30.739 --> 00:00:36.738
Here we have a character. As you can see and she has 9 mouth shapes already created as blend shapes.

00:00:39.058 --> 00:00:45.204
Several mouth shapes are already created for this character. They were created as you would create regular mouth shapes.

00:00:52.602 --> 00:00:57.344
Now let's launch Voice-O-Matic to do the automatic lipsyncing.

00:00:58.146 --> 00:01:01.685
The first thing we are going to do is load up an audio file.

00:01:03.128 --> 00:01:10.914
Now, let's set the sound file as active and set the length of the Maya scene according to the length of the audio file.

00:01:13.964 --> 00:01:23.808
Next we access Voice-O-Matic, and we go to the phoneme mapping section. In this section we have access to 40 different phonemes recognized by Voice-O-Matic

00:01:24.086 --> 00:01:30.113
When we switch from one of the pre defined sets to another, we can see the already assigned mouth positions.

00:01:30.608 --> 00:01:40.535
Here in the visemes, we see the visual representation of the phoneme set. In the group FV, we can see that F and V are already in use.

00:01:42.197 --> 00:01:52.898
We can easily change these visemes to match our character setup, so whether we wish to use 9 blend shapes or 12 or 15, it can easily and quickly be done.

00:01:53.222 --> 00:01:58.895
Voice-O-Matic settings can easily be adjusted to fit the character setup already defined for your character.

00:01:58.937 --> 00:02:05.978
Now we are going to map together the animation curves of the different blend shapes to the viseme sets we have in Voice-O-Matic.

00:02:05.997 --> 00:02:10.777
To do so, we are going to launch Voice-O-Matic outliner here.

00:02:13.273 --> 00:02:26.901
Now we are going to connect all the mouth shapes, so that the blend shape "A" will be connected with the viseme "A" over here. So, let's click "connect" here. And let's repeat the same operation for all the mouth shapes.

00:02:27.342 --> 00:02:41.459
Since Voice-O-Matic was created by animators for animators, it was designed to be very efficient, so once you finish connecting your shapes : you can easily save it and reload it as you please directly within Voice-O-Matic, saving you lots of time.

00:02:48.567 --> 00:02:55.082
Once all the shapes have been connected, we can close the Voice-O-Matic outliner, and click process lipsync.

00:02:56.181 --> 00:03:01.617
The next step is to create the keyframes. We can now see the resulting animation playing on the screen.

00:03:07.111 --> 00:03:13.115
Voice-O-Matic creates standard keyframes using the type of interpolation available on this list.

00:03:13.251 --> 00:03:21.461
As you have just seen, Voice-O-Matic allows you to easily create quality lipsync animation for any animated character directly inside of Maya.

00:03:21.674 --> 00:03:34.840
Now, bear in mind these keyframes can easily be tweaked since they are just standard keyframes, so if you wish to adjust the lipsync, you can easily do so by going in the animation editor or the dope sheet editor.

00:03:35.089 --> 00:03:48.704
