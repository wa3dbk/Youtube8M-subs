00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:10.340
76 year-old Gordon Golding prides
himself on being active, loving to garden

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:15.480
and walk. But last year those simple tasks
became impossible.

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:22.749
"I got so that I couldn't walk anywhere, it was
deteriorating so quickly and I couldn't breathe."

00:00:22.749 --> 00:00:27.730
Gord had stenosis, a common condition
where a heart valve is blocked, impairing blood

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:29.410
flow to the rest of the body.

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:36.410
And Sunnybrook surgeon Dr. Gideon Cohen, told him
the situation was dire. "He just said to me, 

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:39.200
'we've got to do something.' He said, 'you're not going to
be here if we don't.'"

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:44.940
The problem was traditional procedures to
fix the problem were far too invasive and not

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.670
an option for Gord.

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:51.270
"Some patients are simply too high risk for
whatever reason, either they're too elderly,

00:00:51.270 --> 00:00:54.770
or they have too many [commobidities] or
other illnesses,

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:59.860
which preclude them from undergoing conventional
aorta valve replacement. In the past those patients

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:01.470
would be turned down

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:06.200
and treated medically, and the mortality rate
was extremely high." Luckily, Gord was about

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:13.200
to undergo a Sunnybrook first, a procedure
called TAVI or trans-catheter aortic valve implantation.

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:21.040
"So in the TAVI procedure, a catheter or a tube
is placed into a groin artery in the leg.

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:28.180
Through that we can gain access to bring in
other catheters or tubes up into the disease valve.
0:01:29.049,0:01:24.749
At the level of the disease valve,
we cross this with a wire,

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:37.010
and then use a balloon expanding catheter to

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:40.260
create some space, to open up the disease valve,

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:46.350
to allow us to have the space to bring in
and then deploy

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:49.610
the new percutaneous valve."

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:54.369
TAVI saved Gord's life, and it's estimated that
the procedure could do the same for hundreds

00:01:54.369 --> 00:02:01.369
of thousands of other patients. The problem
is funding. "The devices are very expensive, 

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:03.970
they're approximately $20-25,000 each.

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:09.860
At this time these devices are not approved 
by the regulatory agencies in Canada or

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:14.569
the US. Because of this, the Ministry of
Health

00:02:14.569 --> 00:02:18.289
will not fund this; it's considered
experimental.

00:02:18.289 --> 00:02:22.450
That means each valve has to be purchased
through patient donations. 

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:28.029
Gord had the TAVI procedure done last fall
and remembers what a difference it made.

00:02:28.029 --> 00:02:34.629
"I [inhales] went like this, and thought to myself,
'you can breathe!', you know... I was blessed."

00:02:34.649 --> 00:02:39.529
Blessed to have a second chance, and to tell
others about this live saving option."
