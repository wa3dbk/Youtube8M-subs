Thank you for joining Masakazu Tachibana's flute lesson.
Today I'm going to demonstrate the quick pitch adjustment.

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:10.629
When you play the flute you can adjust the pitch slightly&nbsp;by changing the&nbsp;breath angle towards the blow hole.

00:00:10.629 --> 00:00:14.538
This&nbsp;technique is&nbsp;useful when you need to adjust the pitch in&nbsp;a moment under performance.

00:00:14.799 --> 00:00:17.939
Now I am going to show you how to do it.

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:24.900
Hold the flute right. You will have a lower pitch by lowering your jaw&nbsp;to have&nbsp;the breath go down.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:40.000
This is very helpful&nbsp;with middle C#, for example,as it&nbsp;tends to be played in a higher pitch.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:02.000
To the contrary you will have a higher pitch by raising up your jaw to have the breath go up.

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.290
The pitch tends to be lower at the last moment of a&nbsp;long tone,

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:20.390
but this technique will help you to keep the pitch correct.

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:42.050
Note that you do not change the position of your hands. If you move&nbsp; your hands according to the jaw movement, the direction of the breath stays the same and the pitch is not adjusted.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000
As your jaw gets back to the former position the pitch aslo gets back accordingly.

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:03.100
I hope you will learn this technique and it'll be very helpful when you play in a concert or an ensemble.

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:08.900
See you in the next lesson!

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:15.500
