00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:03.600
All right, today we're going to take out the
battery in the iPhone 5s.

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.060
First take your Pentalobe screwdriver, the
same screwdriver that's used for all of the

00:00:07.060 --> 00:00:10.490
iPhones, and take out the two screws near
the base.

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:15.480
Then take your suction cup and put it as close
to the home button as possible.

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:21.330
And take a metal pry tool or anything that's
sturdy enough to fit between the glass screen

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:22.640
and the metal frame.

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:26.110
I like to use a razor blade just because of
how firm it is.

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:31.580
It doesn't bend around and it makes sure that
the screen comes up when in control.

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:36.659
So you can see I'm just barely prying it up
very very gently right here, and then I'm

00:00:36.659 --> 00:00:41.629
going to switch to a plastic tool to not damage
the frame or the screen.

00:00:41.629 --> 00:00:46.469
And you have to very careful when you're lifting
it up because there is a little ribbon cable

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:52.319
attached to the home button that you can see
right here, and there is a little clasp that

00:00:52.319 --> 00:00:53.719
you have to lift up.

00:00:53.719 --> 00:00:57.879
It's just like a little latch so I'm going
to get my little pry tool in there and just

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:00.789
clip it up.

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:04.170
You can see it bend back just like a little
door.

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.899
And the whole little thing comes off, you
can see that it'll detach itself as soon as

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:09.359
I get the ribbon cable un-clipped.

00:01:09.359 --> 00:01:11.430
It's just kind of like a LEGO.

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:19.920
So I lift up and away from the bottom and
it unsnaps.

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.460
And now we're going to take off the screen
just so we don't damage it while we're removing

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:24.460
the battery.

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:28.430
It's pretty simple, there's just four screws
around the outside of the little metal bracket.

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:32.020
I'm undoing each of those right now.

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:36.539
Make sure not to bend the screen past ninety
degrees or it will damage the cables.

00:01:36.539 --> 00:01:40.229
Any parts that you need for those will be
down in the video description below, tools

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:45.219
batteries, if you need anything else just
ask me in the comments, I usually respond

00:01:45.219 --> 00:01:46.399
pretty quick.

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:49.659
So now I'm going to take off these three ribbon
cable connectors.

00:01:49.659 --> 00:01:52.570
This one's for the speaker on the screen.

00:01:52.570 --> 00:01:58.950
This next one is for the LCD on the screen,
and then this last one is for the digitizer

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:03.469
on the screen, which is the part where you
touch and it recognizes where your finger

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:05.130
is.

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.520
Now the screen is off, you can just kind of
see the back of it here.

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.760
You have the earpiece with your cameras and
everything, and then you have your fingerprint

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:15.560
sensor on the home button.

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:16.610
Now take out the battery.

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:21.330
There are two screws holding on this metal
bracket that holds the battery connector in

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:22.330
place.

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:23.330
So I'm going to take off this screw.

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:26.700
Keep it separate from the other screws you
took off it earlier cause they are different

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:27.870
lengths.

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:32.400
And I'm going to remove this bracket and set
it next to the screws so I know which one

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.060
goes in which hole.

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:41.170
And I'm going to take my pry tool and lift
up on the little latch, you can see the three

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:43.340
pin connector right there.

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:49.909
And now I flip the phone around and I'm going
to start prying down from the top of the battery.

00:02:49.909 --> 00:02:54.299
Just kind of using the frame as leverage and
pushing my pry tool underneath the battery

00:02:54.299 --> 00:02:59.799
so I'm not doing a whole lot of pulling up
on the frame or the back, I'm more just sliding

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:01.690
the tool underneath.

00:03:01.690 --> 00:03:07.480
And that un-sticks it from the two strands
of sticky tape that you'll see here in just

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.140
a second.

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:14.960
Then just kind of wiggle the battery loose
and the battery is now free from the iPhone

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:17.819
5s.

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:22.430
The iPhone 5s and the iPhone 5c battery is
interchangeable.

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:28.090
I will list the iPhone 5s battery below though
because it is the bigger battery, it will

00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:29.090
last longer.

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:35.110
Anyway, press it down into place inside the
phone, make sure it's completely flat.

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:42.490
And put the three-pin connector back into
place and the metal bracket back on top.

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:43.840
Screwing it back in.

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:46.939
If you have any questions you can either leave
them in the comments or you can always hit

00:03:46.939 --> 00:03:56.189
me up on Twitter or Facebook, I'll put links
at the end of the video for that.

00:03:56.189 --> 00:04:03.340
Now we're going to reattach the screen, starting
with the digitizer cable.

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:08.220
Just kind of clip that into place.

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:09.860
It's just kind of like Legos.

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:13.870
You'll just have to position it with your
finger and then you'll hear a snap as it goes

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:15.209
in.

00:04:15.209 --> 00:04:16.209
Be gentle though.

00:04:16.209 --> 00:04:22.720
We want to break the least amount of stuff
possible when we open these phones up.

00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:24.130
Hopefully nothing.

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:27.220
You can see me struggle a little bit with
this last one, it's takes a second to figure

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:29.260
out where the connection actually is.

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:35.160
And then I'm going to put the bracket back
into place, grabbing each of the screws that

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:40.000
I laid out before, remembering where they
went, I usually lay the screws out around

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:52.010
the bracket next to the hole they go in.

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:55.750
Once again any parts for this can be found
in the video description below.

00:04:55.750 --> 00:05:01.430
Amazon is usually the cheapest place to get
batteries and stuff, so I'll put a link there.

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:02.440
Now the fun part.

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:08.440
The little ribbon cable for the thumb print
reader or finger print reader is pretty hard

00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:09.440
to get back into place.

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:15.750
You have to line it up kind of with your finger
first and then take your plastic pry tool

00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:18.260
and just kind of gently press it into place.

00:05:18.260 --> 00:05:23.230
It takes a while, you're going to love it.

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:27.170
So now that that's clicked in you have your
little bracket and you set that into place

00:05:27.170 --> 00:05:30.410
just sitting kind of on top of it.

00:05:30.410 --> 00:05:34.890
Make sure it's oriented in the right direction,
and you can press it or click it back down

00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:37.880
into place with your finger.

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:40.440
Takes a second to get it all lined up.

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:43.720
And that's what it looks like when it's all
pressed down into place, so it'll clip in

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:52.440
on both sides and hold that ribbon cable in
very securely.

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:58.870
Then line the top of the screen up with the
frame and kind of clip it up on the sides,

00:05:58.870 --> 00:06:02.670
being careful not to press it too hard in
the center of the screen, we don't want to

00:06:02.670 --> 00:06:03.670
crack it.

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:05.960
And it will clip back into place.

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:10.090
And you can see that it's completely flush
with the phone again.

00:06:10.090 --> 00:06:14.220
And then at this point I like to turn it on
just to make sure everything's working so

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:19.150
I don't have to jump back in, just in case
I forgot to connect any cables or anything

00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:20.150
like that.

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:24.320
If you have any questions, make sure to leave
them in the comments section below, and then

00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:26.680
also don't forget to get those bottom two
screws in.

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:30.160
I put up videos pretty regularly.

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:35.410
I get my hands on pretty new technology pretty
quick, so if you have any questions or anything,
