&gt;&gt; William Haynes: Welcome back to SourceFed.
I�m William Haynes. Come with me internet.

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:07.029
On a time machine. We�re going on a journey!
A journey to your childhood.

00:00:07.029 --> 00:00:07.850

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:14.730
&gt;&gt; William Haynes: Wow, your childhood looks
just like 2014. Maybe you�re a child now.

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.539
Maybe you never grew up. ANYWAY. Did you ever
notice that female lego characters are kind

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:23.550
of one-dimensional? I mean, we have LEGO beach
girl, and LEGO bride, not too many LEGO women

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.640
killing the rap game or much.

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.800
This is no longer a problem! LEGO is releasing
a new line of female figurines doing something

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:34.000
other than cooking or being a grandma. I loved
the grandma LEGO as a child. I pretended like

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.330
she baked my characters apple pie. She loved
me. I didn�t have a lot of friends.

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:41.920
I got to say the pressure was on as a child
with LEGO figurines. I could only imagine

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:45.860
I was doing exciting things like flying the
millennium falcon or dangerously hopping from

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:50.450
pirate ship to pirate ship like a kid with
no morals. Why didn�t they have LEGO sets

00:00:50.450 --> 00:00:54.120
where the figurines sat around a spot of tea
and talked about their emotions? That would

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.470
have fit me much better.

00:00:55.470 --> 00:01:00.140
Luckily, the new LEGO set will include female
scientist like paleontologists and astronomers!

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:04.220
Now kids today can dream towards something
realistic. You know how often Paleontologists

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:09.280
get scurvy? Probably never. Or every once
and a while maybe, that probably happens sometimes.

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:13.460
I personally find it hilarious when someone
tries to fix things and accidently makes things

00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:18.290
absolutely worse. After facing criticism for
lacking professional female figurines in 2012,

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:22.110
LEGO Friends was released. A line that was
SUPPOSED to be for young girls that included

00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:26.140
slimmed down figurines, juice bars, bakeries
and pet salons. You know, the only things

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:30.470
that girls think about. It faced even more
criticism for its pink and purple color scheme

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:34.340
because once again those are the only colors
that females like. I bought my ex-wife an

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:37.060
orange shirt once and we are no longer together.
Facts.

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:40.700
Lego released a statement on the updated set
saying, �This awesome model is an inspiring

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:44.630
set that offers a lot for kids as well as
adults.� Don�t tell me what to do LEGO.

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:48.380
Yeah, you�re a great company who makes cool
toys and yes you shaped my childhood but don�t

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:50.350
assume I�ll like something even though I
totally will.

00:01:50.350 --> 00:01:54.080
What�s hilarious though is those people
that will complain and say things like �We

00:01:54.080 --> 00:01:58.290
don�t need this set! This is ruining LEGO.�
No, shut your gosh darn mouth. They�re not

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.530
going to make less Deathstar�s to make a
few female scientists. That�s like when

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.260
people say: I�m not racist but� Anything
you say preceding that sentence is going to

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:07.430
be racist.

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:14.430
I don�t think LEGO made these decisions
with intentions of holding women down they�re

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:18.980
just not their target demo. LEGO is awesome!
What do you guys think about realistic jobs

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:24.830
in LEGO? Would you buy your daughter a paleontologist
LEGO set? Is it just something fun to have

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:27.900
and look at? Have you ever looked in the mirror
and realized you�re a shadow of your former

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:34.900
self? Let us know in the comments down below.
