00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:12.000
A facelift to Summoner's Rift, visual improvements to the game, matchmaking updates, and a new item are featured in this episode of the Patch Preview.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.500
I'm Phreak and I'll be your host for the show, introducing the various topics in this episode.

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.900
For design input, we've recruited Morello, the Lead Champion Designer.

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.000
We're updating the look of Summoner's Rift.

00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:31.800
While we're hoping all our players will like the new look of the map, the update is even more significant for players who use "Low" or "Very Low" settings.

00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:38.000
In addition to the new look; most players will see better frame rates on the map, especially on low settings.

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:43.300
It will completely depend on your computer and settings, but we've seen as much as double the old frame rate.

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:47.800
With everything being redone, your current settings probably aren't optimal anymore.

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.800
Head over to the Video menu and set your options to what's best for your computer.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
We rebuilt our Head's-Up-Display, or HUD, from the ground up.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.200
All of our players will see a frame rate improvement on all maps, no matter what settings you're playing on.

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:09.200
We've also got some small visual improvements, too: You'll see new icons, more readable text, and some better-looking art.

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.500
We're also including Minion kills in the top right corner by your kills, deaths, and assists.

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:23.500
In addition to the updates with Summoner's Rift and the HUD, we're giving Ashe a visual upgrade, complete with model, animations, particles, splash art, and voiceover.

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:25.000
What can you tell us about this upgrade?

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:34.600
At the end of the day, we're players, too, and when we log in and see some of these older art assets that don't meet our quality standards today, we want to go back and fix that.

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:43.000
This is something you've seen before with Kayle's model rework and Gangplank's visual overhaul, and it's something you'll continue to see in the future with our older characters.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000
We made some improvements to how players see turrets, too.

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:54.600
Unless we're trying to hide information, like with the Fog of War, the game should inform players of everything going on so that they can make quick decisions.

00:01:55.400 --> 00:02:00.400
In a big team fight, a turret could be the biggest source of damage output and players need to react to that.

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:04.400
So we're giving them the cues they need to do make attack or retreat decisions.

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:12.800
Now, whenever a turret targets a player, that player hears a sound and sees an icon over his champion and the turret so he knows what's going on.

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:18.800
We're updating Ranked Solo/Duo Queue by removing the Free-to-Play rotation from this game type.

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:22.000
Now players can only pick from champions they have unlocked.

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:27.700
However, Normal Draft and Ranked Teams are staying the way they are. Why are we making this change?
00:02:29.000,00:02:26.800
Ranked is designed to be a place where you can try your best and try to win, while the Free-to-Play rotation is there so you can try out new champions.

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:45.000
These are mutually exclusive goals because you want to try hard to win; you should be using champions you have some skill with already, not a champion you haven't used before.

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:53.000
We're not changing anything about how Free-to-Play works in Normal, so you can still use that to try out new champions or just play a champion you haven't unlocked that you liked.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:01.200
Ranked Teams are typically made up of players who know each other and are "bought into" the experience they're going to have, to Free-to-Play isn't going to change at all for Ranked Teams.

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:08.500
To clarify really quickly, if you have a champion unlocked on your account during its Free-to-Play week, you can still play it in Ranked Solo/Duo Queue.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.800
Normal Draft Games are seeing a change that our players have been asking for:

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:19.000
We used to give players in premade groups priority and always gave one of them the "captain" slot, with banning powers and first pick.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:27.700
Now, whenever a player queues up for a Normal Draft game, he will have a 20% chance to be the team's captain every time, regardless of premades.

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:35.700
If he's not given the captain slot, an individual player will be given a random slot in the pick order instead of being behind all the premade players.

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:44.800
If multiple players group up before the game, their host absorbs all of their chances, meaning that the host of a 4-man premade has an 80% chance to be captain.

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.000
What are the goals behind all these changes to Normal Draft Games?

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:55.700
We wanted to make Normal Draft fair for solo queue players, and giving them a one-in-five chance to get any slot top to bottom really helps accomplish that.

00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:03.000
Since premade groups can now pick a captain, they can choose who they want picking and banning champions so they can make more effective decisions as a team.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:11.800
Chalice of Harmony is supposed to be this big "I need mana" item but gets ignored, because it takes up an extremely important item slot late game.

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:22.000
To help this, we're adding a late-game upgrade to Chalice of Harmony called Athene's Unholy Grail that grants Ability Power, Cooldown Reduction, Magic Resist, and a bunch of Mana Regeneration.

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:24.900
What effect do we think this item will have on the game?

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:34.500
This late game upgrade will let mana-hungry champions like Swain, Anivia, and Orianna to keep onto the Chalice of Harmony and upgrade it to something useful at the end of the game.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.500
Another reason to do this is to improve caster item variety and build options.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:46.000
Choice in your item build allow you to customize your play style and develop your own way to play your champion, which we always think is fun.

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:53.800
