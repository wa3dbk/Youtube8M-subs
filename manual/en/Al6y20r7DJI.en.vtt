00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:58.000
WALK TO THE BUCKET.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
THAT BUCKET JUST SPLASHES.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000

IT'S VERY POWERFUL.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.733
YOU HAVE THINGS FOR LITTLE

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.000
TINY, PEOPLE, TOO.

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:17.000
SLIDES FOR THE KIDS, WHEN

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
THEY'RE SMALL, THEY CAN SILT AND

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.666
LOOK AT INTERACTIVE WATER

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.000
FEATURE.

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000
DO YOU HAVE AGE RESTRICTIONS.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.000
THERE'S A HEIGHT RESTRICTION.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
THEY HAVE TO BE UNDER 48 INCHES

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000
SO RIDE THE RIDES SAFELY.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:36.000
LET'S RIDE THE SLIDES.

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000
OK.

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
WE HAVE SLIDES, THERE'S A

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000
HUGE SLIDE BEHIND US, THEY COME

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000
INTO THE LAZY RIVER WHERE YOU

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
CAN FLOAT AROUND.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.000
HOW TALL IS THAT ONE?

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000
FOUR STORIES TALL.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:01.000
WE ACTUALLY HAVE A CONVEYOR

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.000
BELT SO YOU DON'T HAVE TO HAUL

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000
THE TUBE ON THAT.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.000
WE DO HAVE BODY SLIDES.

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.000
THERE'S TWO.

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000
YOU HAVE TO CLIMB UP TO THE TOP

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
OF THE FORT TO GET TO THE BODY

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.000
SLIDE.

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000
WHAT DO YOU THINK IS THE

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.000
BIGGER THRILL, THE BODY SLIDE OR

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000
TUBE SLIDE?

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:16.866
THE HOWLING WOLF IS THE BEST

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000
RIDE.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.000
THEY HAVE TO BE AT LEAST

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.000
42 INCHES TO RIDE THAT ONE.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000
THE LAZY RIVER.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.000
I LIKE THIS, BECAUSE IT'S A

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000
CASUAL EXPERIENCE.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000
YOU OFTEN SEE MOMS FLOATING

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000
WITH KIDS SWIMMING THROUGH IT.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:31.000
WHAT'S YOUR BEST TIP, YOUR

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.000
INSIDE SCOOP IS MAKE SURE TO

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000
CHECK IN THE PARK IN ADVANCE

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
WHAT ARE THE ABILITIES OF YOUR

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000
KIDS.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.000
A LOT OF PEOPLE COME AND THEY'RE

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000
DISAPPOINTED BECAUSE THEY'RE

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000
KIDS AROUND TALL ENOUGH.

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.000
WE DON'T WANT FAMILIES TO GO

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000
HOME, THEY SHOULD COME INTO THE

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.066
PARK PREPARED FOR WHAT THEY ARE

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.000
ALLOWED TO DO.

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.000
GREAT IDEA.

00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000
THANK YOU.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.000

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000
WHAT HAPPENS HERE?

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000
THEY RUN ACROSS.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
WE ALSO HAVE OUR SNAKE, VERY

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000
POPULAR FOR THE KIDS TO SIT AND

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.000
TWIST ON AND PLAY ON AND THE

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000
BASKETBALL HOOP BEHIND US.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000
I AM IMPRESSED BY HOW CLEAN

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000
AND I FEEL SAFE HERE.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.000
IT BRINGS IN A LITTLE FRESH

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000
WATER EVERY HOUR.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.666
WE HAVE CHEMICALS THAT GO

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.000
THROUGH A IF IT REACTION SYSTEM

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000
WHAT ABOUT THE LIFEGUARDS?

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:39.000

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000
WHAT'S YOUR FAVORITE THING

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.133

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.000
PARK?

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.000

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000
