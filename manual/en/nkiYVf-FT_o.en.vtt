00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.600
Hear this: suspended bullfighting in Madrid, the bull, I'm sorry

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:25.450
for them, perhaps not so much, gored three bullfighters.

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:29.670
The bull wins...

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:36.670
Unexpected. Paradoxical, far-fetched and exceptionally

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:42.730
rare. Almost impossible, probably bogus.

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:49.399
These are the stories where 'the others' win. Those who in the tale told by the peaks of

00:00:49.399 --> 00:00:55.350
the world must lose. To just die.

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.789
Nevertheless, when an unexpected event, lurking in the dreams of predestined to

00:01:00.789 --> 00:01:07.789
an inglorious end creatures, transcends all boundaries and invades the real screen well, it means

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:15.020
light for many. Food and hopes fuel for angels

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.490
do-it-yourself. Reads as well as the designers of selfish wings.

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:26.490
So look, that is, let us read together what the illuminated loser

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:28.520
wrote on his diary.

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:35.340
The different lives in the world dodge yet another insult as Neo in Matrix with bullets.

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.700
And strongly replied to the small eye of equally tiny skull.

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:47.670
Making feel him really different. For human dignity.

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:54.619
The last specimens that are commonly named just animals, destined to disappear creatures, become

00:01:54.619 --> 00:02:01.619
larger, larger, so large as to make the hated exterminator

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:07.220
negligible as an adjective in a wonderful adventure story.

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:11.930
Where it is not so important to describe things.

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:18.170
it is enough to read it and the heart will do the rest.

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:23.569
The slaves, all the slaves on the planet, wherever they are locked up, now, at this

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:30.400
very moment, perhaps not very far away from you, will disappear.

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:34.050
They will fade away, as if they never existed.

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:38.239
Here, now. But this does not mean that they are not alive

00:02:38.239 --> 00:02:44.709
and free somewhere else. But I will not say it here where, so that nobody

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:48.019
will ever be able to imprison them again.

00:02:48.019 --> 00:02:54.819
And so on, from land to land, from light to light, the unexpected stories disembark and donate

00:02:54.819 --> 00:03:01.660
light to secret desire. Courage, out there, the voice is whispering.

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:03.900
Get up. You can still win...

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.150
