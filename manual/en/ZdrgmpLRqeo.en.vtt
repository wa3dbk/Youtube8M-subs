00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:01.630
Hello everybody and welcome back to my bedroom!

00:00:01.630 --> 00:00:02.729
You haven't seen that in a while.

00:00:02.729 --> 00:00:03.979
That sounds slightly provocative.

00:00:03.979 --> 00:00:04.979
Moving on!

00:00:04.979 --> 00:00:06.120
It's time for another ask evan!

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:10.019
The only ask series on YouTube where you ask
legitimate questions and I answer with illegitimate

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:11.019
puns.

00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:12.019
Let's get started.

00:00:12.019 --> 00:00:13.019
Did you see any hobbits in New Zealand?

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:16.810
Well as a person of above-average height,
everybody I met in New Zealand was in fact

00:00:16.810 --> 00:00:17.810
a hobbit.

00:00:17.810 --> 00:00:21.470
However, when I asked them, they didn't really
tell the truth about it because I heard they're

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:22.660
hobbitual liars.

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:26.130
Yeah, like the Hobbit poster in the back yeah!

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:28.410
Can you give me a pun about bread please pretty
please!

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:32.009
Well I would loave to give you a pun about
bread, but this video is already jam-packed

00:00:32.009 --> 00:00:33.960
full of puns so I don't think I'll have enough
time?

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.260
How badly have you ever been sunburned?

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.010
I'm guessing this is relevant to my last video.

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:40.200
If you watch that, my strumming arm was red
as a tomato.

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:43.870
Sorry it wasn't a misSUNderstanding.

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:45.920
That was probably the worst I've been burnt
in the last year.

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.190
There's not that much sun here in England.

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.230
Which YouTuber would you like to marry if
you could?

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:50.460
Probably Bridebride on tour.

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.480
I'm sure we'd make beautiful tall babies.

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:55.270
Would you rather have a period every month
or have a boner for the rest of your life?

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:58.860
This question is basically, would you rather
be a girl or have a boner for the rest of

00:00:58.860 --> 00:00:59.860
your life.

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:03.930
To be honest, the boner thing wouldn't be
that big of a deal until they started hugging

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:04.930
people.

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:07.750
They might COCK a few eyebrows.

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:08.750
It's not appropriate.

00:01:08.750 --> 00:01:10.030
Have you and Dodie made the chore chart yet?

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:14.210
No, I feel like we need a chore chart to figure
out who's going to make the chore chart.

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:15.920
Cause none of us have made the chore chart
yet.

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:16.920
Opinions on Nicolas Cage?

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.920
Well I've watched a lot of his movies, and
if I had to rate them

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:25.880
on a grade scale, I'd probably give them all
solid BEES!

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:26.880
New merch shop?!

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:27.880
Yes!

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:29.750
I finally have a new merch shop it's in the
description down below, and just between you

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:33.480
and me, I've got a few punny products on the
way, so watch this space.

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:35.370
Are the fairy lights still in the oven?

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:36.370
Oh God.

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:40.100
I just figured we would've taken them out
OVENtually.

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:41.150
Sing this?

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:42.840
We'll go down in history.

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:44.561
Remember me for penny panic!

00:01:44.561 --> 00:01:47.409
Have we officially converted Dodie into loving
pop punk yet?

00:01:47.409 --> 00:01:50.820
Well despite me getting her to cover Young
Volcanoes by Fall Out Boy with me last week

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.480
and getting her to listen to a lot of pop
punk on the road trip she's just not into

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:55.480
that music.

00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:56.480
That's just not her.

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:57.480
As it is.

00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:00.729
Can you make up a pun on the spot?

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:05.730
What do you call it when the person who pays
for you to work the corner does the opposite

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:07.130
of push you?

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:08.130
Pimple.

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:14.260
Cause I made it up on the SPOT.

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:15.709
Who wakes up first in Dovan Flat?

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:18.310
Well considering I have a job and Dodie doesn't,
it's me.

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.530
Why don't you collab with bigger YouTubers?

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:23.080
Why don't bigger YouTubers collab with me?

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:27.240
No to be honest, I would collab with people
bigger than me, but I feel like I just don't

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.420
wanna do a standard video if I did that?

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.640
I'd have to have like this really good idea.

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:33.819
And plus I only really collab with friends.

00:02:33.819 --> 00:02:37.920
Even though there's some bigger YouTubers
that like watch my videos and I respect greatly,

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.280
I'd really wanna have a cool video idea or
they have a cool video idea before I really

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:43.280
collab with anyone.

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:44.280
You know what I'm saying?

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:45.720
I don't wanna make content for content's sake.

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:46.800
I wanna make good stuff.

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.830
What can I say to my crush to convince him
to date me?

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:52.630
As I was trying to come up with an answer
for this I was like why don't I just follow

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:54.560
this advice?

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:58.310
Just ask him out for coffee or just Yo you
free this Saturday?

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:00.380
Why don't we just go watch a movie?

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:01.380
It's that easy!

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:02.910
It's that easy, is it?

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:05.940
Says the guy who hasn't been on a date in
a year.

00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.050
How much phan merch do you own?

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:12.180
Well, one of our lovely viewers, phantidote,
has given Dodie and I this lovely calendar.

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:18.040
So, let's turn to April, we're gonna have
to get through.

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:19.430
*laughs*

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:21.709
What is your next travel destination and can
I join?

00:03:21.709 --> 00:03:24.760
Actually by the time you're watching this,
I'll be doing a roadtrip in Belgium.

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:25.890
Because I decided to go to Belgium.

00:03:25.890 --> 00:03:27.150
So bit late on that.

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:28.150
Sorry.

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:29.150
Make a poem about memes.

00:03:29.150 --> 00:03:30.150
I love watching YouTubers.

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:31.810
Especially those on gleam.

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:34.510
But I'd give it all up
for just one dank frog meme.

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:36.660
Where did you learn to be good at puns?

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:37.660
Teach me your ways!

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:40.310
Well Zoe, you forgot the hashtag, but I can
still help you.

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:41.310
It's okay!

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:45.459
Basically, the way I do it is whenever I hear
people talking or tweeting and I see words,

00:03:45.459 --> 00:03:50.099
I automatically break them up into their syllables
and then in my head these syllables are automatically

00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:52.820
cross-referenced with other words that sound
like them.

00:03:52.820 --> 00:03:54.769
And related words within that little niche.

00:03:54.769 --> 00:03:56.290
And then I make puns out of it!

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:57.900
Like hopefully really fast.

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:58.900
Like I wasn't born like that.

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:01.110
Wasn't like I came out of the womb like goo
goo ga ga.

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:02.300
Bad Romance.

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:03.300
Lady gaga.

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:04.459
It wasn't just like that.

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:08.200
Practice makes perfect and the more puns you
make, the more puns you can't stop making.

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:10.080
It's a problem, you gotta help me!

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:14.010
When we were in New Zealand driving, I didn't
want to fall asleep so in order to stay awake,

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:16.359
Dodie and I came up with a lot of different
car puns.

00:04:16.359 --> 00:04:17.839
Cause that's what you do.

00:04:17.839 --> 00:04:22.389
And one of my favourites that I came up with
was what do you say to your actor friend Mr

00:04:22.389 --> 00:04:26.530
Connory when you don't want him to leave,
but you want him to keep dismissing your opinions?

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:28.189
Stay, Sean!

00:04:28.189 --> 00:04:30.280
Wag on!

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:31.910
Station wagon.

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:34.690
It's terrible.

00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:35.690
It's beautiful.

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:36.779
And terrible.

00:04:36.779 --> 00:04:38.729
Make a pun out of pythagoras theorem.

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:41.320
I could tryangle.

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:43.509
What is your advice for someone who wants
to start a YouTube channel?

00:04:43.509 --> 00:04:46.449
I could use the classic answer that every
YouTuber likes to answer with now which is

00:04:46.449 --> 00:04:49.740
so funny which is "Start YouTubing 5 years
ago!"

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:51.379
That was funny 5 years ago.

00:04:51.379 --> 00:04:53.580
The new joke is start YouTube 10 years ago.

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:55.919
But in reality, just keep making stuff.

00:04:55.919 --> 00:04:56.919
You're gonna be bad.

00:04:56.919 --> 00:04:57.969
And then just keep doing it.

00:04:57.969 --> 00:04:59.759
Keep being bad, but then you get better.

00:04:59.759 --> 00:05:01.650
Get honest opinions, and then just keep making
stuff.

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:05.479
Honestly, the only way you can get better
at anything is practice, so the same goes

00:05:05.479 --> 00:05:06.479
for YouTube.

00:05:06.479 --> 00:05:08.460
I wasn't normal at talking to a camera when
I first started.

00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:09.460
I was terrible.

00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:10.460
How does this make you feel?

00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:14.820
To be honest, it hurts whenever you wind up
using recycled jokes like that, it makes me

00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:16.710
feel like I'm gonna blade.

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:17.710
Blade.

00:05:17.710 --> 00:05:18.710
*laughs*

00:05:18.710 --> 00:05:19.749
Have you seen the film Paddington?

00:05:19.749 --> 00:05:22.589
Actually I saw that on my flight back to England,
and it was really good!

00:05:22.589 --> 00:05:26.039
I thought I wouldn't be able to bear to watch
it, but it was really good.

00:05:26.039 --> 00:05:29.129
It had a lot of British jokes in it that I
don't think I would've gotten 4 years ago.

00:05:29.129 --> 00:05:31.939
But now I was like hah rain.

00:05:31.939 --> 00:05:33.949
Describe your trip to New Zealand in 3 words.

00:05:33.949 --> 00:05:34.949
We smelt bad.

00:05:34.949 --> 00:05:36.460
D'ere were hobbits.

00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:37.460
Mountains.

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:38.460
Mountains everywhere.

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:39.460
I saw stars.

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:41.490
Do you ship Dodie and Sammy?

00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:42.830
No, that's kinda rude.

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:43.969
Sammy already has a girlfriend.

00:05:43.969 --> 00:05:47.210
I mean I'm pretty sure I mentioned it in an
old video.

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:48.210
Fake fan.

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:49.210
Were you breast fed?

00:05:49.210 --> 00:05:51.460
Well, I asked my mother this and she said
when she was deciding whether to give me formula

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:55.259
or her own nature's milk, she said "only the
breast for my little kid."

00:05:55.259 --> 00:05:59.069
Can you recreate Dodie's eyeliner tutorial?

00:05:59.069 --> 00:06:02.029
I've gotten this tweet from like 4 or 5 different
people so yes.

00:06:02.029 --> 00:06:03.379
I'm gonna have to try it now.

00:06:03.379 --> 00:06:05.189
Dodie's asleep in the other room.

00:06:05.189 --> 00:06:06.189
It's 4 in the morning.

00:06:06.189 --> 00:06:07.580
But I've got her eyeliner here.

00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:08.580
Let's try it out.

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:10.189
Okay, so I did watch Dodie's video.

00:06:10.189 --> 00:06:12.270
I know all the perks now.

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:13.300
I'm gonna try this out.

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:14.300
Ahh there we go.

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:15.300
Oh no.

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:16.300
I have to make sure it's a straight line.

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:20.689
So we're gonna have to dip it back in.

00:06:20.689 --> 00:06:21.689
She said super thick.

00:06:21.689 --> 00:06:24.580
She said thick like 8 times it was like talking
to Meghan Trainor.

00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:25.580
Good.

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:26.580
we made the wing.

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:29.030
This being my first time, I get a slight...

00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:32.659
Oh God it's in my pupil.

00:06:32.659 --> 00:06:33.710
Oh there look at this.

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:34.710
I don't need Dodie.

00:06:34.710 --> 00:06:35.710
Okay this one's...

00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:36.710
I'm gonna try the other one.

00:06:36.710 --> 00:06:37.710
Oh that's so much better.

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:39.180
I had to switch out for the newer one.

00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:40.701
Oh look at that wing!

00:06:40.701 --> 00:06:43.160
Look at that nice wing I'm about to take off
man.

00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:44.430
Oh it's a sad wing.

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:46.199
Cleopatra comin' atcha.

00:06:46.199 --> 00:06:47.199
Cover the eyeball.

00:06:47.199 --> 00:06:48.199
Oh we're getting better.

00:06:48.199 --> 00:06:49.860
I wish I could start over to be honest.

00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:50.889
I feel like I could do it now.

00:06:50.889 --> 00:06:52.430
This is the finished look.

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:54.619
Nice and thick she said.

00:06:54.619 --> 00:06:55.749
Nice and thick.

00:06:55.749 --> 00:06:57.819
It looks like this eye has a fringe.

00:06:57.819 --> 00:06:59.059
Just down the side.

00:06:59.059 --> 00:07:02.749
You know I don't look so bad when I'm all
blurry but then you...

00:07:02.749 --> 00:07:03.749
oh

00:07:03.749 --> 00:07:07.779
Well I hope you guys find me extra attractive
cause I got work in another 4 hours and I

00:07:07.779 --> 00:07:09.899
don't think I'm gonna have enough time to
get this stuff off.

00:07:09.899 --> 00:07:10.919
So thank you so much for watching.

00:07:10.919 --> 00:07:12.669
If you did like the video please give it a
like below.

00:07:12.669 --> 00:07:14.749
Other than that, I'll see you guys next Sunday!

00:07:14.749 --> 00:07:15.749
Good bye.

00:07:15.749 --> 00:07:18.060
*cue catchy whistling tune*
*swoosh*

00:07:18.060 --> 00:07:30.729
I love memes so much.
