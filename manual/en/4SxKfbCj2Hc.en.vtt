00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.600
Easy Samsa

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:18.000
hellos ladies from mutevazilezzetler.com

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:24.320
today me and Banu Atabay are with you with very nice recipe

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:27.080
hello Mrs. Banu, hello welcome

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:30.440
thanks, how are you? thank you nice to see you

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:32.600
thanks, thank you very much, what will we do today?

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:35.600
we worn gloves and ready, today we will make "Easy Samsa" 

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:39.920
we say easy samsa cause we will make from prepared puff pastry dough

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.160
but it is not so much different from original samsa dessert as flavor 

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:48.000
feature of our books is that have always easy and delicious recipes

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.880
and it doesn't take so much time, but we don't miss the taste

00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:55.840
of course it is important point for ladies who has precious time

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:57.840
let's start then

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.000
ingredients for easy samsa;

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.520
8 puff pastry dough

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.400
1 waterglass milled almonds

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:04.680
1 egg

00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:06.720
2 tablespoon sugar

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.280
for sorbet;

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.040
2 waterglass sugar

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:11.600
2 waterglass water

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:14.120
1 tablespoon lemon juice

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:16.720
we have 1 waterglass milled almonds

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:22.440
we put this to mixing bowl as filling

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:25.200
we have 2 tablespoon sugar

00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:28.080
and 1 egg

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:32.080
now we put white part of egg into filling...

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:38.400
so it isn't wasted and it gathers the filling

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.400
we seperate the yellow part to apply onto

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:57.160
very very easy and cook quickly

00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.000
but we wait 2 hours to absorb the sorbet

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
there is no waiting side

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.720
it absorbs the sorbet well, but sorbet will be hot

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:15.080
so we will boil the sorbet after put this into oven

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:18.080
now dough leaves becam soft

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.760
take some flour, we will roll out dough a little

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:28.680
my scarf isn't stand by, i enwrap like this at least

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:40.200
actually it can be roll out with hand by push down softly

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:44.400
and turning, puff pastry what a nice thing

00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:48.880
especially for spectators who have limited time

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.440
there is making of this, we make that but..

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:55.160
it takes too much time

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:59.080
now this size is enough

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:02.880
let's mix

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:11.400
we place like this lengthwise

00:03:11.840 --> 00:03:16.440
we didn't mix well, otherwise whites gathered like this

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:20.680
is it need to mix very well

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:22.600
yes, i am in a hurry in here

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:28.880
it doesn't come to my mind, you will put walnut into puff pastry

00:03:31.360 --> 00:03:33.240
i think i am very lazy

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:34.880
no you are not but...
a hayır ondan değil de...

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:38.320
presumably we think hard and those things come up like that way

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:41.040
with 2 finger space or we can do like this

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:45.320
to be equal, we cut from middle to four

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:50.200
we will align into tray now

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:51.960
will it be the oiled tray?

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:54.960
puff pastry doesn't want more oil so it can be very little

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:57.960
sometimes i didn't oil but it keep up in this time too...

00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:02.120
spectators aren't blame then, let's oil little

00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:05.720
shall we apply margarine or oil is there any difference?

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:08.960
no we always suggest oil anyway

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:11.440
margarine isn't recommended much for health 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:14.440
for example while making cake, shall we apply oil to cake mold?

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:18.600
but believe me in cake mold, margarine gives better result, unfortunately

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:21.600
i apply margarine to cake mold

00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:23.320
so it isn't keep then

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:25.480
let's show one more

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:33.040
they smashed much, actually this is better 

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:35.440
yes but its shape is formless a little

00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:45.960
we used almonds in this, walnut can be used too

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:51.080
but in original recipe which we make dough on our own...

00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:54.080
we always use almonds in samsa desserts

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:59.000
it is traditional now

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:05.520
let's put lesser like this to prevent to spill

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:14.920
in our site most popular desserts are desserts with sorbet

00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:18.640
our people love sugar and dessert

00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:20.160
so we are overweight people

00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:21.720
yes unfortunately

00:05:21.720 --> 00:05:24.000
then ladies dealing with diet

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.800
but human only live once

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:28.800
i am not, i am 49 kilo, overweigth people think 

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:31.040
is that so, i am not overwiegth either

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:32.240
no you are not, you're not

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:34.800
plus i am fighthing with this meal hardly

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:37.800
now we align it into tray

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:45.520
we aligned into tray, then cook

00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:50.240
now after we made all of puff pastry we gave scale...

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:52.960
we apply yellow part of the egg we seperated before

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:57.320
we will make others after shooting, now ladies... 

00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:58.760
let's show recipe

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:00.920
but scales are exact

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:04.840
we put into oven heated in 180 degrees before...

00:06:04.840 --> 00:06:07.840
cook until above turns red 

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:13.040
we told before, we spill hot sorbet which contains... 

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:16.040
2 waterglass sugar, 2 waterglass water and 1 tablespoon lemon 

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:18.800
to hot dessert

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:23.640
after 5 minutes it came out from oven we spill hot sorbet... 

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:28.040
onto it, after 2 hours it will be absorbed and we will eat with appetite

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:30.880
easy samsa cooked

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:33.600
cooked we hurried but it is better to stay some

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:37.040
we spilled the sorbet immediately, hot sorbet to hot dessert

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:42.000
after waiting 2 hours to absorb sorbet hopefully we eat with appetite 

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000
Bon Appetit!
