00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:09.850
Hi, I'm Karen Girardo of JustNaturalProducts.com
and today I'm going to give you an

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:13.619
overview of some of the highlights
of our cleaning line.

00:00:13.619 --> 00:00:15.900
We hope you enjoy!

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.130
First of all, your

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:21.029
feet have the largest pores on your body.

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:23.029
When you're standing in the shower,

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:25.970
any residual residue of any

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:28.160
toxic or chemical cleaner that you have

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.480
is literally being absorbed through the pores
in your feet.

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:34.930
Then when you have the situation with
the steam in the shower,

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:38.960
now you're getting that right into your lungs,
you're getting that systemically, you're taking

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:39.710
that in,

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:41.380
in venues.

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:45.449
So, I recommend the next step for people after
the laundry

00:00:45.449 --> 00:00:47.590
is to go to the shower.

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:53.090
Within 26 seconds of being
exposed to a toxin or chemical,

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:56.320
traces of that chemical can be found
in every organ of your body.

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:00.790
Think about it, 26 seconds is pretty
astounding!

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:03.120
Starting with a shower, something that

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:07.380
you've got, you know when you're
in that shower is

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:08.530
affecting you in

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:10.010
in all venues,

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:11.740
there's a great place to start.  Now

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:15.570
what I'll tell you too, here's whats
great with our shower--

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.770
let's see, that when you
picked the unscented,

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:19.850
we also have a

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.420
rosemary mint

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:26.380
essential oil blend that many
people like because of it's,

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:27.820
because of it's freshness,

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:30.200
a nice minty freshness.

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.160
Well what you do, here is it plain and simple,

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:35.390
walk up and spray your shower,

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:37.580
let it sit about 60 seconds,

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:39.280
take your microfiber cloth,

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:43.390
and these by the way, pick up
99.9% of the bacteria

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:47.710
they don't respread the bacteria to other
surfaces because it's held in

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:49.130
at the base

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:51.400
and then releases when you wash it out.

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:54.090
So you take the cloth, you wipe it down

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.900
and that's it.

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:57.090
There's no rinsing,

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.009
you cut your cleaning time in half,

00:01:58.009 --> 00:02:00.030
it does a fabulous job,

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.810
cuts through soap scum--

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:06.539
people are just astounded at the performance
of this, and then what makes it even better

00:02:06.539 --> 00:02:10.149
not only do we have that in
our ready to use fashion,

00:02:10.149 --> 00:02:13.300
but we also, and for the majority
of our product line,

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:14.849
we have concentrates.

00:02:14.849 --> 00:02:16.540
So that you're saving a bottle

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:19.749
and your refilling it with
the concentrate for those that

00:02:19.749 --> 00:02:22.670
want an efficiency.

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:24.279
So, there's the first step.

00:02:24.279 --> 00:02:25.689
Now, I'm gonna just

00:02:25.689 --> 00:02:29.729
briefly go over a couple of the other,
what I consider to be our top

00:02:29.729 --> 00:02:30.340
picks

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:31.949
as far as

00:02:31.949 --> 00:02:35.789
using natural products and where,
how you want to step that through.

00:02:35.789 --> 00:02:38.799
And the reason that I'v selected some
of these top

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:39.979
picks is because

00:02:39.979 --> 00:02:42.929
they're things you using very frequently

00:02:42.929 --> 00:02:43.780
or

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:48.139
there's things that, the chemical counterparts
are very toxic.

00:02:48.139 --> 00:02:49.370
For example

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:50.879
the toilet bowl cleaner

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:51.999
is one of the--

00:02:51.999 --> 00:02:56.789
tends to be one of the--most toxic
products you're using in the home

00:02:56.789 --> 00:02:57.690
This toilet bowl cleaner

00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:59.019
works fabulous,

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:01.769
put a scoop in, swish it around,

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:03.090
it not only does it,

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:04.270
is it natural

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:06.959
but I have found it outperformed

00:03:06.959 --> 00:03:09.309
any chemical product I've ever used.

00:03:09.309 --> 00:03:11.489
My toilet bowl stays cleaner longer,

00:03:11.489 --> 00:03:13.529
works great.

00:03:13.529 --> 00:03:17.889
Our organic foaming soap is one of
our signature products

00:03:17.889 --> 00:03:20.689
and it comes in a whole variety

00:03:20.689 --> 00:03:25.599
of different scents that we are all
scented with pure essential oil.

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:31.319
Thinking back to that conversation that we
had earlier about your skin being your largest organ

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:35.349
and everything that touches it gets absorbed
into your bloodstream, well

00:03:35.349 --> 00:03:38.379
here we are with all those chemically
laden handsoaps,

00:03:38.379 --> 00:03:41.209
you wash your hands how many times a day?

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:44.739
This is a great product to
pick up right away

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:48.000
and start using so you're not introducing
chemicals

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.249
multiple times a day into your system.

00:03:50.249 --> 00:03:53.680
And not only that, bur the pure essential
oils in our soaps

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:54.009
naturally

00:03:54.009 --> 00:03:55.709
kill bacteria.

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:57.439
And I will add this fact

00:03:57.439 --> 00:04:00.549
the Centers for Disease Control

00:04:00.549 --> 00:04:01.959
have requested

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:03.669
that products

00:04:03.669 --> 00:04:08.629
that have antibacterial,
antimicrobial products

00:04:08.629 --> 00:04:10.509
for use in the home,

00:04:10.509 --> 00:04:12.469
cease to be manufactured

00:04:12.469 --> 00:04:15.409
because it's the number one cause of superbugs

00:04:15.409 --> 00:04:18.849
and bactera resistant

00:04:18.849 --> 00:04:20.309
strains of, uh um,

00:04:20.309 --> 00:04:22.120
of bugs.

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:23.789
So, there's a great

00:04:23.789 --> 00:04:25.199
alternative.

00:04:25.199 --> 00:04:27.000
Air fresheners--

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.449
another one right at the top of the list--

00:04:29.449 --> 00:04:32.229
standard air fresheners have, um

00:04:32.229 --> 00:04:34.189
nerve deactivating

00:04:34.189 --> 00:04:37.819
um, chemicals in them that affect your whole
um,

00:04:37.819 --> 00:04:39.069
your nerve system.

00:04:39.069 --> 00:04:42.150
So that just using a natural air freshener

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:44.919
not only is it good for your health
but it also has

00:04:44.919 --> 00:04:46.430
the aromatherapy benefits

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:47.750
of naturally

00:04:47.750 --> 00:04:48.539
uplifting

00:04:48.539 --> 00:04:51.779
body, mind, and spirit.

00:04:51.779 --> 00:04:52.710
And...

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:54.460
our natural

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:55.719
disinfectant--

00:04:55.719 --> 00:05:00.719
spraying just too ounces of standard
disinfectants

00:05:00.719 --> 00:05:02.989
in the well ventialted area

00:05:02.989 --> 00:05:04.190
takes in excess

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:06.849
of a year to get rid of the toxic effects.

00:05:06.849 --> 00:05:11.129
So here we are, this is a very strong blend
of pure essential oils

00:05:11.129 --> 00:05:15.979
that kills bacteria and viruses in
the air and on surfaces.

00:05:15.979 --> 00:05:17.390
And then the other thing,

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:22.089
every day were eating off our dishes and
there are so many chemicals in our

00:05:22.089 --> 00:05:24.659
dish products, in our standard dish products.

00:05:24.659 --> 00:05:28.990
So every scoop that you take with your fork,
going into your mouth, you're getting a little

00:05:28.990 --> 00:05:29.550
bit

00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:31.110
of your soap.

00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:33.550
Well here it is, the natural

00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:36.530
dish soap is a very important thing
so that you aren't

00:05:36.530 --> 00:05:38.860
eating your dish soap on a daily basis.

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:41.360
So these are really the highlights,

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:44.020
with one other thing I do want to focus on,

00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:45.569
our glass cleaner;

00:05:45.569 --> 00:05:47.639
and the one reason for that,

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:49.539
again asthma is ramped

00:05:49.539 --> 00:05:52.879
in our environment today, all the kids, the

00:05:52.879 --> 00:05:56.729
toxic effect of everything that we're using
affecting their lungs--

00:05:56.729 --> 00:05:58.399
our glass cleaner

00:05:58.399 --> 00:06:00.000
does a fabulous job

00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:01.270
as well as

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:04.050
there's no ammonia, no toxic chemicals

00:06:04.050 --> 00:06:06.319
so that you're not worrying about

00:06:06.319 --> 00:06:09.029
harm to you, your children

00:06:09.029 --> 00:06:13.949
grandchildren, pets, etceteras. This clear and
degreaser is a great all-purpose degreaser.

00:06:13.949 --> 00:06:19.220
And things, um, oh my gosh if you've
got a messy, greasy stove, does an amazing

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:19.910
job

00:06:19.910 --> 00:06:21.020
simply spray it,

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:22.940
wipe it with your microfiber cloth,

00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:24.559
I will tell you

00:06:24.559 --> 00:06:26.109
I had the hardest time--

00:06:26.109 --> 00:06:29.639
the grease above my, um, stove, the
cupboard on my stove--

00:06:29.639 --> 00:06:31.230
I couldn't, I have white cupboards,

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:34.149
I could not get that client, it didn't matter
what I was using.

00:06:34.149 --> 00:06:35.509
I will tell you with this,

00:06:35.509 --> 00:06:37.030
I simply spray,

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:39.559
wipe with a microfiber cloth and
it comes right up.

00:06:39.559 --> 00:06:41.180
So for your really tough

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:43.119
daily jobs, um,

00:06:43.119 --> 00:06:47.680
you know, difficult messes in the refrigerator
that you can't get up, you spray this

00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:52.499
you'll just be amazed you can use this for everything
from your granite counter top

00:06:52.499 --> 00:06:55.280
to cleaning the baseboard, the woodwork,

00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:57.589
you can get Crayola crayon off the wall.

00:06:57.589 --> 00:07:00.879
And not only can you buy it in the ready to
use, but again,

00:07:00.879 --> 00:07:02.419
we have our concentrates

00:07:02.419 --> 00:07:04.249
so it's much more economical

00:07:04.249 --> 00:07:06.129
and I think that some people are

00:07:06.129 --> 00:07:07.730
surprised at when they

00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:10.650
come and use Just Natural Products,

00:07:10.650 --> 00:07:11.970
is just how cost effective it is

00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:13.289
per use

00:07:13.289 --> 00:07:16.699
in that it out performs many of the
products on the market.
