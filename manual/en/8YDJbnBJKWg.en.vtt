00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:28.480
Reviewing a game that combines two classics
onto one cartridge can be tough.

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:34.080
See, people see names like Paperboy and Rampage,
and they reflexively go into nostalgia mode.

00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:37.650
They don't want to hear a single bad thing
about games like these, and really, there's

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:39.860
nothing bad to say about Paperboy and Rampage.

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:41.710
They're like pizza and ice cream.

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:43.030
They're always great.

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:45.580
But mix them together?

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:48.770
Ice cream pizza?

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:51.570
Sounds...reprehensible.

00:00:51.570 --> 00:01:01.390
And honestly, if you like these games, this
cartridge is kind of reprehensible, too.

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:05.700
Paperboy and Rampage pairs together two of
the most popular arcade games in history,

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.140
but it does so with little resemblance to
the arcade games themselves.

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:16.610
This is, like, playing Paperboy on a funhouse
mirror.

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:23.990
So this collection was released to the Game
Boy Advance back in 2005.

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:27.340
It was kinda slammed by critics, and for good
reason.

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:31.310
I mean, these games are classics, but these
are not the classic versions.

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:35.539
These are really bad ports of the classics,
stripped down for the Game Boy Advance and

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:37.689
with inexplicably bad gameplay.

00:01:37.689 --> 00:01:40.300
Like...how do you screw up Paperboy?

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:41.950
How's that even possible?

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:46.409
Anyway, let's start with Rampage, since that's
easily the better of the two games as they've

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:47.670
been replicated here.

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:52.470
Rampage was originally released back in 1986,
and the game was a huge success.

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:57.289
Destructible environments was an exciting
concept at the time, and also—unlike a lot

00:01:57.289 --> 00:02:00.490
of arcade games—it was actually even more
fun with multiplayer.

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:04.530
So Rampage really stood out in 1986, and it
played great.

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:17.660
I guess it stands out here, since Paperboy's
so bad, but...it doesn't play great.

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:26.540
The primary problem here is that...these games
were really compressed for this collection.

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:30.680
Rampage loses a lot of graphical detail here,
not to mention animation.

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.920
Movement is way choppier than it's supposed
to be, which has an effect on the appearance

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:36.370
as well as the gameplay.

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:40.360
Another issue with Rampage is that there's
no multiplayer, obviously.

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:45.940
So again, it's missing one of the game's best
features, but...at least Rampage is playable.

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:56.920
Paperboy, on the other hand...ugh, man.

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:01.570
Like Rampage, Paperboy is an arcade classic...this
time, from 1984.

00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:06.280
The idea is to deliver newspapers to your
subscribers and use them to vandalize the

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:07.960
homes of the people who don't subscribe.

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:10.450
Throw them through windows, whatever you got
to do.

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:14.930
Now, Paperboy is notoriously challenging...but
this one's tough for all the wrong reasons.

00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:20.010
I mean, I'm bad at this game to begin with...but
for some reason, your bike wants to pull to

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:21.460
the right in this version.

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:22.460
Like, by itself.

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:28.030
Kind of a problem.

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:32.230
Things like that would seem to point to sloppy
development, and the evidence seems pretty

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:33.230
convincing.

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:38.820
The music is a mess, and the Paperboy's voice
is notoriously out of sync here...often apologizing

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:40.810
even when you actually hit the mailbox.

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:46.510
Throw in the clunky mechanics, the stripped
down graphics, the lack of high scores...

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:47.920
Ugh, man.

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:59.750
I'd like to cancel my subscription, please.

00:03:59.750 --> 00:04:04.390
Paperboy and Rampage was released at a budget
price, so...in that sense, the dip in quality

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:05.660
is kind of understandable.

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:08.410
Then again, it's not like these are new games.

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:10.210
I mean, they're decades old.

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:14.280
And as such, there are...literally dozens
of other versions that are more worth your

00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:15.860
money than these two.

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:17.810
Paperboy and Rampage are classics.

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:39.210
Paperboy slash Rampage is not.
