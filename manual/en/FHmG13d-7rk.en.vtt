00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:08.650
Now let's try altogether the crossover. It's
called the crossover. Are you ready for crossover?!

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:39.410
Now, you got a little, so you can usually
crossover, yeah, crossover. Change the direction.

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:49.090
You can do this, yes, yeah. You have to prepare.
Now take a look for everybody. Observe what

00:00:49.090 --> 00:01:02.809
I do by closely watching real well. Rotate
your upper body to center of the circle. The

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:16.200
center of the circle, a little bit to the
center of the circle, center of the circle.

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:29.870
Pay attention for the shoulder, look at me.
The outer shoulder, outside shoulder is forward.

00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:43.259
So let the arms swing. Let the arms swing.
Let the arms swing and do it as I do. Do it

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:57.920
as I do.
That can look difficult if you do it so. That's

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:10.429
not so good that you can't lose your balance
and fall down. That's not so good. In the

00:02:10.429 --> 00:02:36.670
other direction, yeah, so it's very good.
It's all right you can smile. That's so easy,

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:50.709
yeah. It's so fun. It makes more and more
fun. So that was the crossover, a very, very

00:02:50.709 --> 00:02:52.409
important exercise.
