00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:12.800
The peregrine falcon  the fastest animal on planet Earth.

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:18.840
In dizzying chases that exceed 300km/h 

00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:22.880
it literally sweeps its prey out of the skies.

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:48.080
At three years old, weighing just over half a kilo,

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:52.000
 this male peregrine falcon is all ready a deadly hunter.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:57.400
Nothing goes unnoticed by the extraordinary eyesight of this “heavenly peregrine”,

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.840
 which takes full advantage of any open space.

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.480
Birds on the wing become the object of its well-planned aerial ambushes.

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:08.440
It usually attacks from a great height,

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:11.080
 diving vertically at vertiginous speeds.

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:23.040
But on this occasion, it has detected a target on its perch, 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:24.960
so flies low and out of view, 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.520
picking up speed without betraying its presence

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.680
 until as close as possible.

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:33.720
With a cruising speed of over 100km/h, 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.000
any victim that senses danger and tries to escape will do so too late: 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:51.040
a final sprint, and the pigeon is taken with no resistance.
