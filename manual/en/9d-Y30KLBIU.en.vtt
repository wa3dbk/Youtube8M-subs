00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:01.089
Hey everyone!

00:00:01.089 --> 00:00:06.520
If you want to know how I transform my face
from this, to this, keep watching!

00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:12.540
I start with a primer to protect my skin and
provide a glow.

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.770
Next i use a light reflecting concealer to
sculpt my face, focusing under the eyes, on

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:29.280
the cheekbones, browbone, and center of the
forehead.

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:33.520
I like using a spray foundation to cover my
5 o'clock shadow, because it builds very quickly.

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:40.680
I take whatever is left on the brush for my
face

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:48.280
Make sure to set your foundation with powder!

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.690
I just got the Smashbox contour kit, it's
back at Shoppers Drug Mart!

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.250
The taupe shade is my perfect contour colour,
and the highlight colour blends nicely with

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:06.520
the touch of a finger.

00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:13.400
I always use a bronzer to warm up the skin.

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:21.270
For the eyes I'll be using a few shades out
of this palette - starting with Smog on the

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.560
lid.

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.990
Next I'm going to line my tightline with a
black pencil liner, and then create depth

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:36.810
and dimension using a black shadow on a small
brush.

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:45.359
I'm creating sharp shape that will be blended
out, using this shadow called Lost along the

00:01:45.359 --> 00:01:47.939
crease and under the eye.

00:01:47.939 --> 00:01:57.119
Lastly, I'm going to blend and fluff it all
out with the Blackout eyeshadow.

00:01:57.119 --> 00:02:00.090
For dramatic effect, I like lining my eyes
with a liquid liner.

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.490
I often create a cat eye in both the inner
and outer corners, to widen and angle my eyes

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:07.840
more.

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:13.150
I like applying blush after I'm done the eyes,
so that it's not too heavy or too light.

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:20.700
For days like these, I love using false lashes
to densify my lashline and feminize my eyes!

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:23.459
A defined brow in soft taupe is a nice finishing
touch.

00:02:23.459 --> 00:02:28.400
Next, mascara, and we're on to our lips!

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.030
I'll be lining them with a nude pencil to
create a nice plush base for this soft rose

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:38.330
lip gloss.

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:41.340
Next I fuss with my outfit and hair for twenty
minutes, and we're good to go!

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.090
I hope you enjoyed this, I'll see you next
time!!

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:48.459

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:49.170
Bye now!
