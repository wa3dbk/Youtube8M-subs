"Which Spices Fight Inflammation?"

00:00:07.388 --> 00:00:10.917
Once in a while I come across 
a study that's so juicy,

00:00:10.917 --> 00:00:12.803
I do an entire 
video about it.

00:00:12.803 --> 00:00:17.084
It's like my which-fruit-fights
-cancer-better video,

00:00:17.084 --> 00:00:19.518
or "the best cooking method" one,

00:00:19.518 --> 00:00:21.876
or that one comparing 
thousands of foods.

00:00:21.876 --> 00:00:25.357
Well, this is one such study.

00:00:25.357 --> 00:00:29.000
A group of researchers at U of F, 
Gainesville and Penn State,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.680
set up an elegant experiment.

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:32.575
We've known ounce per ounce,

00:00:32.575 --> 00:00:36.303
that herbs and spices have 
some of the greatest

00:00:36.303 --> 00:00:39.726
antioxidant activities known, 
but that's in a test tube.

00:00:39.726 --> 00:00:43.183
Before we can ask if an herb or 
spice has health benefits,

00:00:43.183 --> 00:00:46.544
it's first necessary to determine 
whether it's bioavailable.

00:00:46.544 --> 00:00:51.583
This has never been 
done, until now.

00:00:51.583 --> 00:00:53.457
They could have went 
the easy route

00:00:53.457 --> 00:00:55.663
and just measured the change 
in antioxidant level

00:00:55.663 --> 00:00:58.183
in one's bloodstream before 
and after consumption,

00:00:58.183 --> 00:01:01.102
but the assumption that the appearance 
of antioxidant activity

00:01:01.102 --> 00:01:04.556
in the blood is an indicator of 
bioavailability has a weakness.

00:01:04.556 --> 00:01:07.275
Maybe more gets absorbed 
than we think,

00:01:07.275 --> 00:01:09.474
but doesn't show up 
on antioxidant tests

00:01:09.474 --> 00:01:11.406
because it gets bound up 
to proteins or cells.

00:01:11.406 --> 00:01:13.018
So they attempted 
to measure

00:01:13.018 --> 00:01:15.586
physiological changes 
in the blood.

00:01:15.586 --> 00:01:18.430
They were interested in 
whether absorbed compounds

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:20.303
would be able to 
protect white blood cells

00:01:20.303 --> 00:01:22.622
from an oxidative or 
inflammatory injury,

00:01:22.622 --> 00:01:25.215
whether it would protect 
the strands of our DNA

00:01:25.215 --> 00:01:27.943
from breaking when confronted 
by free radicals.

00:01:27.943 --> 00:01:30.742
They also wondered if the 
consumption of herbs and spices

00:01:30.742 --> 00:01:33.741
might alter cellular 
inflammatory responses

00:01:33.741 --> 00:01:35.744
in the presence of 
a physiologically

00:01:35.744 --> 00:01:37.502
relevant inflammatory insult.

00:01:37.502 --> 00:01:39.223
What does this all mean?

00:01:39.223 --> 00:01:41.850
What they did was take 
a bunch of people

00:01:41.856 --> 00:01:43.380
and had each of them eat

00:01:43.384 --> 00:01:45.170
different types of 
spices for a week.

00:01:45.172 --> 00:01:48.860
There are so many really unique 
things about this study,

00:01:48.861 --> 00:01:52.500
but one was that the quantity 
that study subjects consumed

00:01:52.501 --> 00:01:56.660
was based on the usual levels 
of consumption in actual food.

00:01:56.665 --> 00:02:00.060
Like the oregano group was 
given a half teaspoon a day—

00:02:00.069 --> 00:02:02.380
the kinds of practical quantities

00:02:02.389 --> 00:02:05.140
people might actually 
eat once in awhile.

00:02:05.141 --> 00:02:08.020
Then at the end of the 
week they drew blood

00:02:08.021 --> 00:02:09.460
from the dozen or 
so people they had

00:02:09.461 --> 00:02:11.420
adding black pepper to 
their diets that week,

00:02:11.421 --> 00:02:14.020
and compared the effects 
of their blood

00:02:14.022 --> 00:02:16.060
to the effects of the 
blood of the dozen

00:02:16.061 --> 00:02:18.760
on cayenne, or cinnamon, 
or cloves, or cumin.

00:02:18.765 --> 00:02:20.780
They had about 10 different 
groups of people

00:02:20.789 --> 00:02:22.360
eating about 10 
different spices.

00:02:22.364 --> 00:02:24.340
Then they dripped 
their plasma

00:02:24.344 --> 00:02:26.020
(the liquid fraction 
of their blood)

00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:28.540
onto human white blood 
cells in a petri dish

00:02:28.541 --> 00:02:30.850
that had been exposed to 
an inflammatory insult.

00:02:30.852 --> 00:02:33.580
They wanted to pick something 
really inflammatory

00:02:33.581 --> 00:02:35.860
so they chose oxidized cholesterol,

00:02:35.862 --> 00:02:38.530
which is like what you'd 
get in your bloodstream

00:02:38.537 --> 00:02:40.870
after eating something 
like fried chicken.

00:02:40.871 --> 00:02:43.120
So they jabbed the 
white blood cells

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:44.760
with oxidized cholesterol 
and then measured

00:02:44.767 --> 00:02:47.820
how much TNF they 
produced in response.

00:02:47.829 --> 00:02:52.500
Tumor necrosis factor is a 
powerful inflammatory cytokine,

00:02:52.502 --> 00:02:56.020
infamous for the role it 
plays in autoimmune attacks

00:02:56.024 --> 00:02:57.480
like inflammatory 
bowel disease.

00:02:57.484 --> 00:02:59.460
Compared to the 
blood of those

00:02:59.464 --> 00:03:01.220
who ate no spices 
for a week,

00:03:01.223 --> 00:03:03.860
was the blood of those 
eating black pepper

00:03:03.864 --> 00:03:07.270
able to significantly dampen 
the inflammatory response?

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:09.630
No.

00:03:09.636 --> 00:03:12.860
What about any of 
these other spices?

00:03:12.864 --> 00:03:17.340
Cloves, ginger, rosemary, 
and turmeric

00:03:17.343 --> 00:03:21.980
were able to significantly stifle 
the inflammatory response.

00:03:21.984 --> 00:03:25.970
And remember, they weren't dripping 
the spices themselves

00:03:25.976 --> 00:03:27.340
on these human white 
blood cells,

00:03:27.344 --> 00:03:29.580
but the blood of those 
who ate the spices

00:03:29.584 --> 00:03:31.420
and so represents 
what might happen

00:03:31.425 --> 00:03:33.860
when cells in our body are 
exposed to the levels of spices

00:03:33.865 --> 00:03:38.090
that circulate in our bloodstream 
after normal daily consumption.

00:03:38.091 --> 00:03:40.420
Not megadoses in some pill,

00:03:40.422 --> 00:03:44.100
just the amount that makes your 
spaghetti sauce taste good,

00:03:44.105 --> 00:03:45.910
or your pumpkin pie 
or curry sauce.

00:03:45.916 --> 00:03:49.980
There are drugs that 
can do the same thing.

00:03:49.984 --> 00:03:53.620
Tumor necrosis factors are 
such major mediators

00:03:53.623 --> 00:03:56.540
of inflammation and 
inflammation-related diseases

00:03:56.540 --> 00:04:00.280
that there are these TNF 
blocking drugs on the market

00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:02.140
for the treatment of 
inflammatory diseases

00:04:02.143 --> 00:04:04.830
like osteoarthritis, 
inflammatory bowel disease,

00:04:04.834 --> 00:04:07.540
psoriasis, and ankylosing spondylitis,

00:04:07.543 --> 00:04:12.540
which rake in, collectively, 
more than $20 billion a year,

00:04:12.542 --> 00:04:15.260
because drug companies 
charge people

00:04:15.264 --> 00:04:20.210
$15,000–$20,000 a 
year for the drug.

00:04:20.212 --> 00:04:24.900
At that price, the side effects 
better be hugs and rainbows,

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:28.180
but no, these drugs carry 
a black label warning

00:04:28.184 --> 00:04:30.060
because they can 
cause things like,

00:04:30.065 --> 00:04:32.790
hmm, cancer and 
heart failure.

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:37.300
If only there were a 
cheaper, safer solution.

00:04:37.304 --> 00:04:40.240
Curcumin, the yellow 
pigment in turmeric

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:43.310
a spice that's a tad 
cheaper and safer,

00:04:43.313 --> 00:04:46.500
but does it work outside 
of a test tube?

00:04:46.508 --> 00:04:49.660
There's evidence that it may 
help in all the diseases

00:04:49.663 --> 00:04:52.180
for which TNF blockers 
are currently being used,

00:04:52.184 --> 00:04:55.580
and so with health-care costs and
safety being such major issues,

00:04:55.584 --> 00:05:04.240
this golden spice turmeric may 
help provide the solution.
