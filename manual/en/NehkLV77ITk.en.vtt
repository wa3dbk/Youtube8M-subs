00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.050
You're just walking down the street

00:00:02.050 --> 00:00:03.040
and someone comes up to you

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:04.210
and says "Quick! Quick!--

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:09.120
4792. Is this divisible by 3? This is an emergency!

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:10.700
Tell me as quickly as possible!

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:13.010
And luckily you have a little tool in your toolkit

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:16.110
where you know how to test for divisibility by 3

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:17.510
Well, you say I can just add up the digits

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:19.810
If the sum of that is a multiple of 3

00:00:19.810 --> 00:00:21.590
then this whole thing is a multiple of 3

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:27.470
So you say 4 plus 7 plus 9 plus 2

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:30.730
That's 11. Plus 9, it's 20. Plus 2 is 22

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:32.660
That's not divisible by 3

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:34.860
If you're unsure, you can even add the digits of that

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.360
2 plus 2 is 4. Clearly not divisible by 3

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:44.580
So this thing right over here is not divisible by 3

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:49.070
And so luckily that emergency was saved

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:50.840
But then you walk down the street a little bit more

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:56.060
and someone comes up to you--- "Quick! Quick! Quick! 386,802--

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:57.900
Is that divisible by 3?"

00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:59.360
Well, you employ the same tactic

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:05.800
You say, what's 3 plus 8 plus 6 plus 8 plus 0 plus 2?

00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:11.540
3 plus 8 is 11. Plus 6 is 17. Plus 8 is 25. Plus 2 is 27

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:14.090
Well, 27 is divisible by 3

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:16.610
And if you're unsure, you could add these digits right over here

00:01:16.610 --> 00:01:20.810
2 plus 7 is equal to 9. Clearly divisible by 3

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:23.790
So this is divisible by 3 as well

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.340
So now you feel pretty good

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.230
You've helped two perfect strangers with their emergencies

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:30.360
You figured out if these numbers were divisible by 3

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.100
very very very very quickly

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.510
But you have a nagging feeling

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:35.690
Because you're not quite sure why that worked

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:37.840
You've just kind of always known it

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.740
And so, let's think about why it worked

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.410
To think about it, I'll just pick a random number

00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:44.390
But we could do this really for any number

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:45.910
But I don't want to go too puffy on it

00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:48.290
just so you can see it's pretty common sense here

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:51.060
And the number we'll use is 498

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.440
I can literally use any number in this situation

00:01:53.440 --> 00:01:56.220
And to think about why this whole little tool

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:57.530
this little system works

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:00.020
we just have to rewrite 498

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:03.510
We can rewrite the 4- since it's in the hundred's place

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:05.740
we can write that as 4 times 100

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:11.460
Or 4 times 100, that's the same thing as 4 times 1 plus 99

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:12.410
That's all this 4 is

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:14.910
400, which is the same thing as 4 times 100

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:17.360
which is the same thing as 4 times 1 plus 99

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.030
And the little trick here is I want to write-

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.530
instead of writing 100, I want to write this as the sum of 1

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:24.620
plus something that is divisible by 3

00:02:24.620 --> 00:02:26.370
And 99 is divisible by 3

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:30.050
If I add more digits here- 999, 9999--

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:31.630
they're all divisible by 3

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:34.950
And this is why you can do the same reasoning for divisibility by 9

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:36.690
Because they are divisible by 9 as well

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.630
Anyway, that's what the 4 in the hundred's place represents

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:43.270
This 9 in the ten's place- well that represents 90

00:02:43.270 --> 00:02:47.460
or 9 times 10, or 9 times 1 plus 9

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:50.780
And then finally this 8. That's in the one's place

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:54.320
8 times 1, or we just write plus 8

00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:56.800
Now we can distribute this 4

00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:04.520
This is 4 times 1 plus 4 times 99. So it's 4 plus 4 times 99

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:06.670
Actually let me write it like this. I'm going to write--

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:12.640
Actually let me write it first like 4 plus 4 times 99

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:13.960
Do the same thing over here

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:17.290
This is the same thing as plus 9--

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:26.100
do that magenta color- plus 9 plus 9 times 9

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:30.390
And then finally I have this 8 right over here

00:03:30.390 --> 00:03:32.290
And I can rearrange everything

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:36.900
These terms right over here, the 4 times 99, and the 9 times 9

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:38.140
I can write over here

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:41.550
4 times 99- I'll write what's like a different notation

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:45.040
plus the 9 times the 9, that's those two terms

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:54.190
and then we have the plus 4 plus 9 plus 8

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:58.990
Well, can we now tell whether this is divisible by 3?

00:03:58.990 --> 00:04:02.880
These terms, these first two terms are definitely divisible by 3

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:05.290
This's divisible by 3 because 99 is divisible by 3

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:06.640
regardless of what we have already

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:07.810
you don't even have to look at this

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:09.980
This is divisible by 3, so if you're multiplying it

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:11.340
it's still going to be divisible by 3

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:14.140
This is divisible by 3, so if you're multiplying this whole thing

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:15.630
it's still going to be divisible by 3

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:17.380
If you add two things that are divisible by 3

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:19.130
the whole thing is going to be divisible by 3

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:21.290
So all of this is divisible by 3

00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:23.820
And if you have another digit here, you'd done the same exact thing

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:30.270
Instead of having 1 plus 99, you'd had 1 plus 999, 1 plus 9999, etc

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:32.480
So the only thing you have to really worry about

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:33.990
is this part right over here

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:35.460
you have to ask yourself

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:37.440
in order for this whole thing to be divisible by 3

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:40.630
this part is- well that part is, then this part

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:43.480
in order for the whole thing has to be divisible by 3

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:50.120
that also has to be divisible by 3

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:51.890
But what is this right over here?

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:53.450
These are just our original digits

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:56.630
498. 4 and 9 and 8

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:58.650
We just have to make sure that when we take the sum

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:01.000
it's divisible by 3
