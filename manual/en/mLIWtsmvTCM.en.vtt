Hi this is Jeff Isbell on behalf of ExpertVillage.com.
Modern finger style just wouldn’t be what

00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:22.290
it is without altered tunings. If fact, I’m
using one now. Here are some of the most common.

00:00:22.290 --> 00:00:28.330
The first one is called dropped E, you just
take your E, and we’re going to drop it

00:00:28.330 --> 00:00:32.610
down to a D. Now you notice I went below the
D and then back up to it, that helps you stay

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:41.370
in tune. Here’s a good way to check your
tuning. Twelfth thread on the D and fifth

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:53.890
thread on the E string. You can use it for
things like this. So it gives you a nice strong

00:00:53.890 --> 00:01:01.129
bottom on you D string, you probably already
used that. Another one is called DADGAD, D-A-D-G-A-D.

00:01:01.129 --> 00:01:08.580
Well, I’ve got to drop my high E down to
a D,

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:30.300
and my B drops down to an A,
you can use it for things like doing the intro.

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:35.740
One more fairly common tuning, its actually
less popular than it used to be is an open

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:41.250
D, now that means that it’s the D chord
played with all the strings open, that’s

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:50.670
a D there. It’s really a great tuning you
know for harmonics and whatever fret you fret,

00:01:50.670 --> 00:02:04.840
just a straight bar. It’s really great for
finger picking and finger picking with a slide.

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:16.060
So you know, it has a lot of options, so open
D. There are many other altered tunings and

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.270
we could make a whole series of lessons just
on that, you can find them on lots of places

00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:26.700
and a really great thing to do is just create
your own, just don’t be limited, just start

00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:29.810
changing the string notes and have fun.
