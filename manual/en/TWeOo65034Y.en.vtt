00:00:00.969 --> 00:00:06.240
Changing a watch can be a little tricky at
first, but once you know what to do you can

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.400
change your watch battery in minutes. With
this video from Esslinger.com, you can learn

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:17.740
how to replace a watch battery without a cell
strap holding it in place.

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:21.970
Before you can change a watch battery, you
must remove the watch back. If you need help

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:28.970
figuring out how to open your watch case back,
you can check out our other videos here.

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:36.880
The tools you will need to replace the watch
battery are:

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:41.200
A watchmaker's flat head screwdriver
A pair of plastic tweezers

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:44.570
Finger cots

00:00:44.570 --> 00:00:49.530
Put plastic finger cots on your fingers that
may touch the watch movement. Dirt, oils and

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:53.600
grease on your fingers can damage the inner
workings of the watch and the cot will keep

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:57.890
that oil from transferring to the watch.

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:02.340
When the watch case is open and before you
attempt to remove the battery, find the battery

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:07.970
number on the battery. Batteries will sometimes
jump out of the watch case and get lost, making

00:01:07.970 --> 00:01:10.990
it very difficult to replace if you don't
know the number.

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:17.680
The watch battery number may be a difficult
task. Usually the batteries are marked with

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:22.570
their three digit number, but sometimes they
are marked with a combination of letters and

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:27.290
numbers. If it marked with letters and numbers
you will need a battery chart, like this one,

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:29.360
to find its 3 digit number.

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:35.909
Using the watch battery number, get the right
size replacement battery for the job.

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:40.190
To be able to remove the watch battery, you
will probably have to remove the plastic movement

00:01:40.190 --> 00:01:45.950
ring that keeps the movement in place inside
the watch case.

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:50.299
There will usually still be a spring loaded
arm holding the battery snug in the case.

00:01:50.299 --> 00:01:54.760
To remove the old battery, take your screwdriver
again and gently pull the spring loaded arm

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:55.670
back.

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:00.920
Do not be concerned if the battery jumps out
of the case.

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:05.049
Once the old battery is free of the case,
set it aside in case there is a problem and

00:02:05.049 --> 00:02:06.409
you need it later.

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:11.030
Take the new battery out of the package and
pick the battery up with the plastic tweezers.

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:15.120
Make sure that the side of the battery with
the engraved number is facing upwards.

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.730
Insert the new battery into the battery well.
It usually works best to start by sliding

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:22.760
one side of the battery in toward the arm
first.

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:27.040
When the battery is most of the way into the
well, take your watchmaker's screwdriver

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.200
again and gently pull the spring loaded arm
back again and push the battery flat into

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.250
well.

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.310
Release the arm while holding the battery
steady to ensure it holds the new battery

00:02:36.310 --> 00:02:40.120
perfectly in the watch case.

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:44.360
Now that the battery is back in place, you
can put the plastic movement ring back in

00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:51.060
place around the movement to keep it from
moving in the watch case.

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:56.000
When you are done, you can discard or recycle
the old battery and replace the watch case

00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:02.379
back. For information on how to close your
watch back, check out these videos.
