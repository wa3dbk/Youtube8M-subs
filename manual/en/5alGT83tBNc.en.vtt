00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:20.289
Let’s get this out of the way early.

00:00:20.289 --> 00:00:21.289
Yes.

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:22.289
I get it.

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:23.430
There’s a freakin’ ice cream cone.

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:27.909
But is it really as bad as fake pokeballs,
or a mime, or a blackface controversy?

00:00:27.909 --> 00:00:33.290
Say what you will about the designs of these
most recent hundred and (mumble), at least

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:37.330
you can just grab your trusty Pikachu and
be the best like no one ever... wait.

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:42.530
You mean you don’t even get to see a Pikachu
until AFTER you’ve beaten the game?

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:47.460
That all the 493 monsters that came before
are Pokemon-non-grata until you’ve become

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:48.460
the champion?

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:52.149
What the heck kind of hellhole are we dealing
with here where something like this can happen?

00:00:52.149 --> 00:00:53.850
Oh, it’s New York.

00:00:53.850 --> 00:01:00.170
That explains it.

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.129
This Fifth generation of Pokemon tries a number
of new things.

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:06.759
Not content with the idea of just giving you
one rival, they pin a companion at each end

00:01:06.759 --> 00:01:10.909
of the spectrum: One’s a calm, calculating
know-it-all, and one’s a free spirit who

00:01:10.909 --> 00:01:13.000
just wants to hug every Pokemon.

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.890
However, you still get the criminal syndicate
you’ve come to know and expect... except

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.759
this group, Team Plasma, are less concerned
with money or land expansion or whatnot than

00:01:20.759 --> 00:01:22.909
just forging a new world order.

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:27.140
It’s not by any means “grimdark,” but
compared to previous outings, you get the

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:30.630
sense that Black and White are a bit grittier,
for whatever that’s worth.

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:31.950
This is where we’ve come.

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:38.870
Sentient trash bags and Dark/Fighting types
constantly pulling their “pants” up.

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:45.189
Mechanically, the game’s undergone some
slight but significant changes.

00:01:45.189 --> 00:01:49.789
Three-on-three battles have been added, thus
introducing the concept of range to your team’s

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:50.789
attacks.

00:01:50.789 --> 00:01:54.219
Or you can just stick all 3 Pokemon on a lazy
Susan for a Rotation battle.

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:58.680
Or you can put them all on a TRAIN, as instead
of a Battle Tower or Battle Frontier or something

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.049
almost reasonable, we’ve got a Battle Subway.

00:02:01.049 --> 00:02:04.340
And they don’t even offer five dollar footlongs.

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:09.619
A new, almost paranormal zone called the Entralink
allows access to nearby players’ worlds

00:02:09.619 --> 00:02:15.420
via local Wi-Fi, where you can terrorize them
and earn bonuses for your own exploitation.

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:20.060
Also branching from the Entralink is a forest
for collecting any Pokemon your Pokemon dream

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:24.840
of if you put them to sleep and then point
your browser to the interwebs and do some

00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:27.310
minigames, but we can cover that later.

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:32.470
If you think Pokemon is just “Get monsters
and grind grind win,” all the changes in

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:38.409
the world and all the plot development in
the galaxy isn’t going to break you.

00:02:38.409 --> 00:02:42.570
But if you, as a kid, back in the Red and
Blue days, stepped into the World of Pokemon

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:47.200
(after dealing with that genderblind creeper
Oak) and enjoyed every species being something

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:53.140
new and exciting, you finally have a chance
to experience that in earnest again.

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:54.010
Even the ice cream cone.
