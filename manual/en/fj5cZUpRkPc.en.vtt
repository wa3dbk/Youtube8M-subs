Welcome to Expert Village. This is Kim Brown.
This is actually a color primer, so it primes

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:11.519
your face; it smooths everything out and gives
you a nice moisture. It is not going to be

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.380
overly moisturizing. You don’t want to use
too much moisture on your wedding day. Don’t

00:00:15.380 --> 00:00:22.490
use anything extra and you should always practice
your makeup before the actual day, so you

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:33.550
know how it is going to last. Yeah, you’ve
got some dry spots. It is always good to get

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:45.299
facials beforehand to smooth out your skin
tone a few weeks before. Especially if you

00:00:45.299 --> 00:00:51.300
have never had facials before, then you should
may be start a month ahead of time and get

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:56.019
a facial just in case you breakout. Since
we are using a liquid foundation, we are going

00:00:56.019 --> 00:01:00.609
to go ahead and put the liquid on first and
then we will do the concealer. If we were

00:01:00.609 --> 00:01:06.100
doing a powder foundation, we would want to
put the concealer on first, cover any blemishes

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:12.979
or dark circles under the eyes. We have a
primer for the eyelids that helps the eye

00:01:12.979 --> 00:01:19.060
shadow stay on longer. The reason for that
is you want to work from wet to dry, so you

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:29.869
don’t want to put concealer over a dry powder.
Okay? Two different foundations; I just like

00:01:29.869 --> 00:01:35.560
to hold them up to the skin. You can really
tell just by holding it up. That one looks

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:45.880
like it is going to be a good match, usually
three pumps depending on what your makeup

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.310
is, but you don’t want to have too much,
but you would have a nice coverage all over

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:56.560
and I just warm it up in my fingers. You can
apply with a sponge too or a makeup foundation

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:02.539
brush. I think that most people are used to
putting their makeup on with the fingers and

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:09.119
there is nothing wrong with that at all. You
can rub it in really well and get it blended.

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:15.560
Blending is really a key to putting your foundation
on. You don’t want to have lines anywhere.

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:19.430
So this matches your skin tone really well.
You want to have something that matches. Sometimes

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:27.560
I go one shade darker with foundation. As
long as you blend really well, you can do

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:34.510
that. A lot of times your face tends to be
a little bit lighter than your neck area and

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:40.490
your chest area, so if you do go one shade
darker and blend it really well then it blends

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:49.799
it really well with your neck and you have
got a little bit of color. You might even

00:02:49.799 --> 00:02:59.379
use a sponge just to finish blending. When
you think you have blended enough, just blend

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:05.959
a little bit more and then you will be good.
