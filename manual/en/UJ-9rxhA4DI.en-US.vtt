Hello im Jaocagomez

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:03.500
and we are gonna meet the company Oneplus

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:05.000
and its new cellphone One

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.400
and see what can it offer against the other options in the market

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:10.000
Lets Begin!

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:20.000
First of all.... Who the fuck is Oneplus?

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Well Oneplus is a Chinese Company created on December 2013

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
The Creator of Oneplus is Pete Lau who was Vicepresident of Oppo

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
He Quit his Job to create a new company with a new focus and vision

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
To change the market and offer more with less money

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.000
And thats the strategy they are aiming for with the new One

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.000
The first cellphone they launch its Oneplus One

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.000
A device with very good specifications, very good price, cheap.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:53.000
It has the GPC, good, pretty and cheap

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:58.000
Its a phone with a very good design, simple. Its gonna have exchangeable back covers like Moto x.

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.000
Whats offering Oneplus with the new One?

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Well, First of all, Very high specifications

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000
A 5.5 Inch Screen with 1080p Resolution

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:17.000
3Gb of Ram, a Qualcomm 801 Quad Core Processor running at 2.5Ghz each one.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:28.000
a 13 Megapixels Camera capable of recording at 4k Resolution, it also has a 5 Mpx Front camera to make your selfies even better

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:35.000
It has dual stereo speakers, on the bottom of the device, tuned by JBL

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
Its an unlocked cellphone with Global LTE, works with almost all companies in the world.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:48.000
It has Touchless voice control like Moto x Triggered by a voice command like ''ok google'' and it responds

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:55.000
It also has screen Gestures so you can draw a V with the device screen off, and the lintern turns on

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:00.000
you have the option to choose between Physical capacitive keys or virtual on-screen buttons like the Nexus 5

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:07.000
It has Miracast Wireless video protocol so you can project your phone on your TV

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:15.000
It comes with a custom version of android that many of you may now called cyanogenmod,

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:22.000
on its version 11s, which is a subtle modified version of cyanogen 11 but still cyanogenmod

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000
its one of the best and more stables android roms around

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.000
And Finally a 3100Mah Battery one of the biggest in the market for a cellphone.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:35.000
And the detail here that shines its that its price is not 600 dollars

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
is not 500 dollars, is not 400 dollars

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.000
it costs 300 dollars public price on its 16Gb Version

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:48.000
And there's no 32Gb version the next storage is 64 Gb

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.000
And the price for the 64Gb version its 350 Dollars

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000
So we will see how good this company does
with its experiment of a GPC phone

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:05.000
with High specs and everything you expect from a high range 600 dollar cellphone

00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000
So we will see how it goes

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:18.000
Its making a very agressive marketing strategy, blaming on brand prices with Sony, Samsung and LG

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000
And how they manage the specs and price of their smartphones making a point

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000
which is OK, this company its doing the advertising Good and agressive

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:28.000
And its aiming for the people who buys Google's Nexus Phones

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000
Because if you wanted a nexus you wanted to flash custom roms

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000
And Obviously for the price, very good processor for low price

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.000
a Nexus 5 costs 350 dollars on its 16Gb version

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:43.000
So this phone its attacking the price and audience of Nexus Phones

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000
Which is Ok, this company is doing well on the branding they want to create

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.000
They have me very tempted because this phone has everything With Very good Specs

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:58.000
But i want to know whats gonna do Motorola with the new Moto X+1

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:05.000
Thats the phone i want to see because Samsung Galaxy s5, Sony z2, Lg g3 we will see

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.000
They are no surprise for me as there is no real change

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:15.000
Off course they have drastic hardware changes but not on software they are not a real surprise for me

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.000
This is just a race of cores, and the most Ghz, Gb's and internal memory

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.000
But all the prices are still up, so they are not really inovating

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000
Oneplus One comes out Middle May at no specific date

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000
and no specific stock for launch.

00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.000
but lets hope it doesnt happen like the Nexus phone because everyone wants one and they sold one in one hour or less

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.000
So thats all for the moment, im Jaocagomez, i say goodbye to you, regards!
