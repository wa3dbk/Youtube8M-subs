- [Voiceover] Experience music
in your car like never before

00:00:10.932 --> 00:00:14.390
with the JAD Amplifier Series from NVX.

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:17.484
Guaranteed to perform at
or above their rated power,

00:00:17.484 --> 00:00:20.572
these superior amps are CEA-2006 Certified

00:00:20.572 --> 00:00:25.383
for true and honest output
in real world situations.

00:00:25.383 --> 00:00:27.927
Underneath the clean,

00:00:27.927 --> 00:00:31.728
is one of the most advanced
amplifiers ever manufactured.

00:00:31.728 --> 00:00:34.847
The brand new IR Chip
enhances the audio efficiency

00:00:34.847 --> 00:00:37.104
and assists the Class D Circuitry

00:00:37.104 --> 00:00:40.895
and S.M.P.S Power Supply
Circtuitry in reducing the amp size

00:00:40.895 --> 00:00:43.072
that allow for a smaller footprint

00:00:43.072 --> 00:00:45.476

The JAD800.4 puts out 800
watts RMS to four channels

00:00:53.247 --> 00:00:56.150
and is stabled down to 2OHMS.

00:00:56.150 --> 00:00:59.240
It could be used as four
channel powering four speakers,

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:01.886
a three channel with a pair
of speakers and a subwoofer,

00:01:01.886 --> 00:01:04.773
or a two channel with two
sets of high watted speakers.

00:01:04.773 --> 00:01:06.243
Each of which can be adjusted

00:01:06.243 --> 00:01:09.006
using the channel model switch.

00:01:09.006 --> 00:01:11.803
The nickel plaited set screw
terminal securely attached

00:01:11.803 --> 00:01:14.904
to the power grounded remote
turn on cables to the amp.

00:01:14.904 --> 00:01:17.860
If you're installation requires
a larger gauge of power wire

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:19.105
than the standard terminals,

00:01:19.105 --> 00:01:21.126
then use the included gauge adapter

00:01:21.126 --> 00:01:24.003
to ensure the proper gauge is used.

00:01:24.003 --> 00:01:27.330
For protection, three 25 amp
fuses are conveniently located

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:30.454
next to the power terminals.

00:01:30.454 --> 00:01:32.344
Once the amp is connected
to the stereo using

00:01:32.344 --> 00:01:34.903
the RCA inputs, adjust the level dial

00:01:34.903 --> 00:01:36.753
to match the output of the source unit

00:01:36.753 --> 00:01:39.678
to get the cleanest signal possible.

00:01:39.678 --> 00:01:41.635
The crossover selection switch allows you

00:01:41.635 --> 00:01:43.585
to enable the Low Pass Filter,

00:01:43.585 --> 00:01:47.335
High Pass Filter or a
combination of the two.

00:01:48.222 --> 00:01:50.251
And the selectable Frequency Multiplier

00:01:50.251 --> 00:01:52.876
will increase the crossover
frequency by 10 times

00:01:52.876 --> 00:01:54.698
for greater frequency definition

00:01:54.698 --> 00:01:57.926
when running active component speakers.

00:01:57.926 --> 00:02:01.168

00:02:04.126 --> 00:02:05.705
It's wide frequency response range

00:02:05.705 --> 00:02:08.339
and high damping factor
provide excellent control

00:02:08.339 --> 00:02:12.374
over the speakers and all
the desired frequencies.

00:02:12.374 --> 00:02:14.412
The impressive signal to noise ratio,

00:02:14.412 --> 00:02:17.194
an extremely low THD providind clean,

00:02:17.194 --> 00:02:21.249
noise free signal for
excellent sound quality.

00:02:21.249 --> 00:02:24.949
Internal Soft Start technology
safely turns on the amplier

00:02:24.949 --> 00:02:27.446
a few seconds after the
car's eLectrical system

00:02:27.446 --> 00:02:29.559
to prevent potentional speaker damage.

00:02:29.559 --> 00:02:31.898

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:42.009
disipate heat and keep
the amp running cool.

00:02:42.009 --> 00:02:44.374
