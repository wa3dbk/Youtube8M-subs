Hi this is Nev Lapwood from Snowboard Addiction.

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:41.340
We’re riding at Whistler Blackcomb and this
tutorial is focused on tree riding.

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:44.910
Riding tree runs can be some of the best runs
on any mountain.

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:48.800
They get less traffic than other areas of
a resort and as a result they’re usually

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.730
a good place to find powder.

00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:55.940
The skills you need are a combination of the
ability to ride bumps and powder.

00:00:55.940 --> 00:01:00.020
I’d highly recommend staying out of trees
until you’ve had the chance to explore those

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:04.460
2 areas of shredding.

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:09.690
Riding Trees
If the snow is deep in the trees then you’ll

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:14.490
want to ride in more of a straight line with
light turns just leaning from side to side

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.270
so that you can keep your speed and momentum
rather than constantly trying to slow yourself

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:21.090
down.

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:24.810
If you start to pick up more speed then you’re
comfortable with you can hammer some weight

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:30.149
into your tail combined with a little counter-rotation
for a slash.

00:01:30.149 --> 00:01:34.800
This technique is relatively easy in tight
locations, and will dump some speed but allow

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:37.460
you to keep momentum.

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:42.130
They also look and feel cool to quickly spray
some snow.

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:46.250
Try this out both on your heel side as well
as your toe side as it’s important to be

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:50.000
able to change to either direction when needed
in trees.

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.350
Don’t turn fully sideways when it’s deep,
if you turn fully sideways in powder the snow

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.670
grabs your board and kills all your momentum.
