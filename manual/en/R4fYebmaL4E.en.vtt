00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:08.690
Hey Food Tube, it's DJ BBQ and the sun is
shining.

00:00:08.690 --> 00:00:11.629
It means the grill is out, good timing right.

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:17.630
One of you cats commented on our videos and
wanted a spicy burger.

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:21.290
Jessie Maldonado from South Carolina you asked
and you shall receive!

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:28.790
We're going to do a beautiful spicy burger
with chilli, blue cheese, bacon, tomatoes

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:30.730
all from scratch!

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:31.730
You ready?

00:00:31.730 --> 00:00:32.730
Here we go.

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:37.320
For our spicy burger we're going to use a
scotch bonnet chilli.

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:46.430
Finely chop this bad boy up because you want
small bits of that into the meat and add all

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:51.790
this chilli into a kilo of mixed beef and
now we're going to add a teaspoon of mustard

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:55.460
powder into this and then add salt and pepper.

00:00:55.460 --> 00:01:00.090
So now I'm just going to work it all in but
not too hard.

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:09.740
I don't want to break all that fat down I
want a nice juicy burger.

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.180
So a couple more of these.

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:19.040
Oh man this has a lot of chillies in!

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:28.000
That's a perfect sized burger it's going o
be so juicy when pulled off the BBQ.

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.900
And the angels sing!

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:31.900
Ah.

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:38.900
It's time now for some red neck science.

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:42.300
Our coals are white hot; I want a really hot
heat for our burgers.

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:48.360
SO I've created a kind of a ramp, it goes
less and less in heat so it's indirect.

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:55.030
This is in case I get any flare ups from the
meat I can move my meat over there.

00:01:55.030 --> 00:02:01.660
Or if you get any big flare up you can just
take the lid, throw it back on your bbq and

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:04.689
the lack of air just melts it all down dude.

00:02:04.689 --> 00:02:07.009
Now we're going to start with the streaky
bacon.

00:02:07.009 --> 00:02:10.700
Oh man, that's hot.

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:13.469
See that happening?

00:02:13.469 --> 00:02:15.319
They're the flare ups.

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:19.349
There are lots of fat on this stuff.

00:02:19.349 --> 00:02:27.219
I don't want to burn my bacon I just want
it to crisp up.

00:02:27.219 --> 00:02:29.569
Let's get our burgers going.

00:02:29.569 --> 00:02:32.579
She looks big doesn't she?

00:02:32.579 --> 00:02:33.579
Looking good!

00:02:33.579 --> 00:02:39.140
I want a bit of wood smoke flavouring going
into our meat, so I've got some apple wood

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:40.409
chunks and some cherry.

00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:44.079
I'm going to get them in there into the coals.

00:02:44.079 --> 00:02:46.400
It's just going to add another layer of flavour.

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.499
I love the taste of wood smoke on my meat.

00:02:50.499 --> 00:03:02.849
It's time to flip the burger man, I'll get
this right.

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:06.559
See that?

00:03:06.559 --> 00:03:09.040
That's caramelised flavour man, chargrilled
burgers!

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:14.029
My bacon is nice and crispy so it's going
to come off and pat it dry.

00:03:14.029 --> 00:03:15.730
The burgers are getting nice heat there.

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:20.109
I'm going to calm them down and bring them
over the indirect side.

00:03:20.109 --> 00:03:23.290
Make sure they cook in the inside a bit more.

00:03:23.290 --> 00:03:27.549
So I need the bacon ready and some blue cheese.

00:03:27.549 --> 00:03:36.010
We need each burger a couple of strips of
bacon, okay now we're going to crumble on

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:42.139
our blue cheese.

00:03:42.139 --> 00:03:43.390
We have a really really hot heat.

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:45.309
SO I'm going to do a quick toast of the buns.

00:03:45.309 --> 00:03:48.629
Seriously I'm talking 10 seconds.

00:03:48.629 --> 00:03:52.530
See what happened?

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:53.839
15seconds.

00:03:53.839 --> 00:03:56.389
we've got to work fast here.

00:03:56.389 --> 00:03:59.379
And now the magic happens.

00:03:59.379 --> 00:04:02.419
Burgers go on the buns.

00:04:02.419 --> 00:04:06.589
A nice tomato on top to go with that creamy
blue cheese.

00:04:06.589 --> 00:04:07.589
Look at that!

00:04:07.589 --> 00:04:09.559
How good does that look!

00:04:09.559 --> 00:04:10.569
Oh!

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:15.430
And there you have it, our spicy burgers and
blue cheese and burger.

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:20.660
And now it's time to set my mouth on fire!

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:25.760
Oh my god.

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:27.460
Mmmm.

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:32.460
That's' a spicy but tasty burger.

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:35.500
That's a good burger.

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:38.070
