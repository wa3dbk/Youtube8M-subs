00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:09.000
Hello, everyone! I‘m Sr. Vassa, and this is just a
short Coffee Break. As we are approaching

00:00:13.019 --> 00:00:19.990
the feast of the Nativity or Christmas, at
which Christ is born, ever so humbly, in a

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:25.570
manger, and, perhaps even more strikingly,
His Mother, the All-Blessed

00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:33.653
Virgin, gives birth, ever so humbly, in a
manger, let‘s reflect a bit on this elusive

00:00:33.653 --> 00:00:40.219
quality or virtue called “Humility.“ In
the few words we have recorded in the New

00:00:40.219 --> 00:00:46.700
Testament of the Mother of God Herself, She
makes mention of humility several times, most

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:52.360
famously, perhaps, when soon after She‘s
received news, at the Annunciation, that She

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:58.940
will give birth to the Savior, She says: “He
has regarded the humility of His handmaiden...

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:04.320
“ (Lk 1:4 7). Now, we don‘t know all that
much about the day-to-day life of Mary, the

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.159
Mother of God, but
every time we do encounter Her in the New

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:15.159
Testament, Her humility is so striking, and we
do know that She led a life of prayer and

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:22.450
also read the Scriptures. This reminds us,
zillions, that humility is a gift; it‘s a

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:28.960
gift from God, a state of grace that comes
from putting our life in God‘s care on a

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:32.175
daily basis, in daily prayer.

00:01:32.457 --> 00:01:38.731
When we stop relying on ourselves,
in the largely futile effort to control everything

00:01:38.731 --> 00:01:44.806
and everyone, then our reaction to things
that we‘d rather not have happen to us is

00:01:44.806 --> 00:01:52.317
no longer anger, uncertainty, or fear. We
have rather the spiritual strength, the grace,

00:01:52.317 --> 00:02:02.925
the peace, and yes, the humility to survive.
But humility is a gift, like I said. So when it eludes

00:02:02.925 --> 00:02:08.727
us, and we notice ourselves slipping into
self-reliance and dissatisfaction with people

00:02:08.727 --> 00:02:16.385
and things we can‘t control, let‘s hurry
back into the God Zone and get connected with Him.

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:22.907
But that's all I've got for you, for today, zillions.
And I hope to see you next time.
