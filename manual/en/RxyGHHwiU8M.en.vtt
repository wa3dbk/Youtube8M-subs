Hi I'm Jay French from jayfrenchstudios.com,
and I'm going to show you how to draw an medieval

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:12.130
weapon. Now we're going to start of course
with a sword, and a good way to start with

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:16.859
a sword is with a straight edge. You don't
have to, but it's a good thing to have at

00:00:16.859 --> 00:00:27.910
least a few straight edge lines underneath
to give you a guide. Okay, so once we have

00:00:27.910 --> 00:00:36.370
where the center point is, good thing to remember
about swords is that the handle is much narrower

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:46.569
than the blade. Unless you're talking a rapier
where it maybe about the same size. A pommel

00:00:46.569 --> 00:00:50.649
is a very important element, which is the
very end of the sword opposite the point.

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:54.820
A very important element actually, because
it gives balance to the sword. So you want

00:00:54.820 --> 00:01:00.520
something solid. The bigger the sword, and
we're going to do a nice good medieval great

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:08.369
sword here, then the bigger you want the pommel
to be. The weightier you'll want it to be.

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:20.240
So, it's good to have some symbolity to your
medieval weaponry. Hand guards are broader

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:26.159
again on bigger swords. You'll notice they're
smaller like on shorter swords like Roman

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:32.320
swords. We're just going to give this one
a basic straight cross guard. Now you've got

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:37.680
your straight line for your blade, but maybe
you don't want a straight blade. So at that

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:52.060
point what you might do is just follow the
same time on each side, we wanted it to come

00:01:52.060 --> 00:02:04.579
out here and then maybe broader again, and
then have a nice curved tip. But because you

00:02:04.579 --> 00:02:10.540
had your center line you knew what to follow.
There's your basic on a sword. Your handle

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:18.480
can be wrapped leather, just do a zig zag,
a good easy way to cover that. A little shading

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:22.790
on it, make it darker than the rest. Now let's
say you wanted a northern battle ax, don't

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:35.959
have to worry as much about your straight
edge there, because it's not as long generally

00:02:35.959 --> 00:02:42.349
a handle goes inside of the thick metal chunk
at the center, which again is your weight

00:02:42.349 --> 00:03:01.599
that is put behind the force of an ax blow.
Get some nice shine in there. A few just diagonal

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:10.860
lines, darkest away from the light source,
very good way to get that effect. Often a

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:21.019
medieval ax, especially a fantasy ax will
have a nice thick spike on this end. And perhaps

00:03:21.019 --> 00:03:26.260
an armor piercing point on the opposite side.
A good way to make something look nice and

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:34.610
used is to wrap some leather straps cross
crossing around it. Make sure you show them

00:03:34.610 --> 00:03:42.180
wrapping here, and then have them tie off,
show the straps going. Then we can have a

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:53.530
leather wrap, if you make these angles slightly
curved, it gives them a little more depth.

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:57.299
And that's a basic first lesson in how to
draw a medieval weapons.
