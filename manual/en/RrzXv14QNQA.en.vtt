Chef Devaux -- Teriyaki Chicken Sushi Roll
So first off you want to make some Teriyaki

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:15.330
Chicken, it's very simple to make.

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:22.160
You just take a hot pan add some sesame seed
oil and some olive oil then add your chicken.

00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:27.000
Alright, so you want the chicken to be cooked
but not overcooked, if it's overcooked then

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.349
it's very dry, so make sure you really don't
overcook it, but also don't undercook it because

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:36.570
then it's raw, obviously.

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:43.580
Okay so just flip over the chicken and then
when it's perfectly cooked you add some thick

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:49.680
sweet teriyaki sauce, just drizzle it over
like that.

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.210
This is a very simple sauce to make.

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:55.739
If you want to know how to make it then check
out the link in the description of this video.

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:00.949
Alright so just glaze the chicken a little
bit with the teriyaki sauce and not too long

00:01:00.949 --> 00:01:07.431
and then put it to the side ready to make
the sushi.

00:01:07.431 --> 00:01:10.689
Alright, so you start off by laying a bamboo
rolling mat inside a plastic bag with a half

00:01:10.689 --> 00:01:13.910
sheet of Nori on top of it, rough side up.

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:18.390
Then you slightly wet your hands so that the
rice doesn't stick so much with water and

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:25.400
vinegar rice mixture, and you take 120g of
cooked seasoned sushi rice and you spread

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:30.789
it out evenly over your half sheet, and you
want to do this nice and softly and fluff

00:01:30.789 --> 00:01:31.799
it out.

00:01:31.799 --> 00:01:39.770
Now flip the sheet over with the rice, and
place two pieces of teriyaki chicken you just

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:45.530
made earlier, then add a little bit of sliced
cucumber, a very small amount because otherwise

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:46.840
you won't be able to close it.

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:53.520
Then you add a little bit of teriyaki sauce,
okay, and then you roll it.

00:01:53.520 --> 00:02:01.369
You just bring up the back end, you pull it
over and then you compress.

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:07.600
Then you let go, push forwards and compress
again and let go one more time, and push forward

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:13.480
and compress one more time, and there you
go, that's your sushi roll.

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:20.470
Okay now you just move this to one side, and
you take a half avocado and then you start

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:29.130
slicing very thin slices, about 1mm thickness
is what you want to aim for and you want to

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:32.210
have very precise cuts.

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:36.630
By only dragging the tip of the knife through
the avocado you encounter less resistance

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:40.920
and then the avocado doesn't stick to the
knife as much, if you go flat up and down

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:45.030
what will happen is the avocado slices that
are cut very thinly will just stick to the

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.250
knife as you pull back out.

00:02:48.250 --> 00:03:00.700
Once you've cut the avocado slices you spread
them out thinly on the board just like so,

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.640
and then you just trim off the sides.

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:08.270
This is just to make it look a little neater.

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:15.020
Alright, then move your sushi roll so you
can easily add the avocado slices and the

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:20.570
with your knife you just slide it underneath
the avocado slices and then place it on top

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:26.620
of your sushi roll, just like so.

00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:36.620
Now you take a piece of cling film and you
place it over your sushi roll, and then press

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:42.710
this on with another bamboo rolling mat, this
one without a plastic bag over it so the plastic

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:45.960
wrap doesn't stick to it, and then release.

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:48.230
Now to cut the sushi roll.

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:52.430
Alright so wet your knife again to a damp
rag so the sushi rice doesn't stick to it

00:03:52.430 --> 00:03:59.090
much, then just cut your roll in half, place
the two together.

00:03:59.090 --> 00:04:06.150
Okay, so cut the sushi roll into six pieces
and two spare off cuts.

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:10.860
Don't forget to wet your knife on a damp cloth
in between cuts, this helps against rice sticking

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:18.320
against the blade and makes it much easier
to cut through the sushi.

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:24.350
These will be the end bits of the roll and
these can be eaten by the chef or thrown away.

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:31.302
Now remove the cling film very gently and
then you have six perfect pieces of sushi

00:04:31.302 --> 00:04:32.759
left over.

00:04:32.759 --> 00:04:41.449
Alright so to plate up, you simply place your
sushi roll pieces and you place them onto

00:04:41.449 --> 00:04:51.520
a plate, add a little pickle ginger then you
drizzle some thick sweet teriyaki sauce over

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:53.879
it.

00:04:53.879 --> 00:05:01.370
Just look at that glossy thick honey like
consistency, just marvelous, and then sprinkle

00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:24.319
with some freshly toasted sesame seeds and
violÃ , done.

00:05:24.319 --> 00:05:26.340
Thanks for watching this video, I hope you
all enjoyed it.

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:30.189
If you did you are going to need two more
things to make this recipe, the first is thick

00:05:30.189 --> 00:05:33.090
sweet teriyaki sauce, the one you saw in this
video.

00:05:33.090 --> 00:05:36.770
A link has just appeared on the bottom right
for you to learn how to make that.

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:39.460

rice, and a link has just appeared on the

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:42.439
bottom left corner to learn how to make that,
