00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:04.380
Here at Northern Brewer there's one
question we get asked a lot during the

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.000
fall and winter months

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.760
and that's how to incorporate real pumpkin 
in our Smashing Pumpkins Ale beer kits.

00:00:10.939 --> 00:00:15.139
One of our most popular seasonal recipes,
Smashing Pumpkins Ale drinks like a

00:00:15.139 --> 00:00:17.590
slice of pumpkin pie in the glass.

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:20.270
Now what most people are 
thinking of when they think

00:00:20.270 --> 00:00:22.869
"pumpkin pie" isn't the pumpkin itself,

00:00:22.869 --> 00:00:28.349
it's the spices: cinnamon, nutmeg,
allspice &amp; cloves that typically 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:29.429
go into a pumpkin pie.

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:33.190
Our Smashing Pumpkin kit 
certainly includes a spice blend

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:34.560
for that holiday pizzazz.

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:38.000
But if you want to step up your game and
give your Smashing Pumpkin added

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.829
body and color, you can use real pumpkin.

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:44.449
In this video we will show you how to 
use canned and real pumpkin in our

00:00:44.449 --> 00:00:49.820
extracted and all-grain kits. Let's start by
adding canned pumpkin to our extract kit.

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:53.270
Of course you can make this beer by
simply steeping and draining the

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:54.540
specialty grain, adding the extract,

00:00:54.540 --> 00:00:58.530
boiling the hops and spices -- and end up with a perfectly awesome beer.

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:01.600
But if you want to use canned pumpkin

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.820
here's what Northern Brewer suggests.

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:07.690
This will require a straining bag large
enough to fit in the opening of your

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:12.310
boil kettle. We recommend a brew master
filter bag. In addition to your extract

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:16.880
recipe kit, you'll also need to buy two
pounds of crushed six-row malt 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:18.790
and two or three cans of pumpkin.

00:01:18.790 --> 00:01:22.650
This pumpkin should have no sugars or
preservatives added. This mini-mash of

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:26.060
six-row malt will help convert 
the starches in the pumpkin 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:27.550
into fermentable sugars.

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:32.080
Bring three gallons of water up to 
about 160-degrees. Don't sweat it

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:34.150
if you're off by a degree or two.

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:36.470
Line the kettle with the filter bag.

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:40.900
Add the grain into the bag and 
stir well then add the pumpkin.

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:42.649
Be careful not to splash,

00:01:42.649 --> 00:01:44.069
this water is hot.

00:01:44.069 --> 00:01:48.620
Stir the pumpkin to mix well into the
mash and break up in the large clumps.

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:53.140
After you add the grain and pumpkin the
temperature should drop a few degrees.

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:56.740
Hold this mash at a temperature 
of 150-to-152 degrees

00:01:56.740 --> 00:02:00.200
for about one hour.

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:02.049
If your temperature is too high

00:02:02.049 --> 00:02:04.090
add a small amount of cold water.

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:05.290
If it's too low

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:09.590
just turn the heat on low and 
stir for a few minutes.

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:12.549
At the end of the hour, 
lift the bag out of the kettle,

00:02:12.549 --> 00:02:16.139
drain as much liquid as possible,
and discard the contents.

00:02:16.139 --> 00:02:18.090
The mesh bag itself can 
be cleaned and reused.

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:22.490
You can see the influence of the canned
pumpkin in the color of the wort already.

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:23.499
From here

00:02:23.499 --> 00:02:25.639
add heat to bring to a boil,

00:02:25.639 --> 00:02:26.730
add your extract, 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.419
hops and spices per the recipe.

00:02:29.419 --> 00:02:33.709
Now let's look at using real pumpkin 
in our all-grain kit. You can use this

00:02:33.709 --> 00:02:38.760
roasted pumpkin method for the extract 
kit as well. First, find an 8-to-10 pound

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:43.359
pumpkin or a few smaller pumpkins that
add up to that weight. Cut the gourd(s)

00:02:43.359 --> 00:02:48.930
in half and discard the innards. Then cut it
into smaller chunks or cubes. If pumpkins

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:53.199
are out-of-season, this technique works
well with winter squash like butternut

00:02:53.199 --> 00:02:57.949
or acorn. Toss the pumpkin on a 
cookie sheet covered with tin foil or a 

00:02:57.949 --> 00:03:01.659
glass casserole dish in the oven 
between 300 and 350 degrees 

00:03:01.659 --> 00:03:04.080
for about 60 to 120 minutes

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:08.089
or until soft and cooked through.

00:03:08.089 --> 00:03:12.829
Once out of the oven, move to another 
cookie sheet or bowl and let cool.

00:03:12.829 --> 00:03:17.159
Once cooled, use a spoon to scoop the
flesh out of the gourd skin and into a

00:03:17.159 --> 00:03:21.749
small bucket or bowl. Stir or smash the
pumpkin well the break-up any large

00:03:21.749 --> 00:03:24.839
clumps before adding the 
pumpkin into your all-grain mash.

00:03:24.839 --> 00:03:28.809
We suggest adding some hot water to the
pumpkin to help loosen it up and make it

00:03:28.809 --> 00:03:33.079
easier to pour into your mash tun. Pour
your grains into your mash vessel and

00:03:33.079 --> 00:03:38.259
stir well the mix. Some homebrewers even
add a few handfuls of rice hulls to help

00:03:38.259 --> 00:03:40.499
avoid a possible stuck sparge.

00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:45.009
Next, scoop the moist and cooked 
pumpkin flesh into the mash tun.

00:03:45.009 --> 00:03:50.269
Again stir well to mix the pumpkin into
the mash and break up any clumps.

00:03:50.269 --> 00:03:54.519
Mash it at 152-degrees
fahrenheit for at least one hour.

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:58.629
After this mash rest you have the option of
raising to a mash-out temperature 

00:03:58.629 --> 00:04:02.739
of 170-degrees for ten minutes
then continue to sparge by

00:04:02.739 --> 00:04:04.510
whatever method you choose.

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:08.529
Again, you'll notice the pumpkin's
immediate influence on the color,

00:04:08.529 --> 00:04:10.470
feel, and aroma of the wort.

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:12.829
Collect your total boil volume.

00:04:12.829 --> 00:04:14.000
Bring to a boil.

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.300
Follow the recipe for hops 
and spice additions.

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:20.520
Just like you can add real roasted
pumped into the extract version of

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:21.829
Smashing Pumpkin, 

00:04:21.829 --> 00:04:25.059
you can also add canned 
pumpkin to the all-grain version.

00:04:25.059 --> 00:04:26.169
And there you have it:

00:04:26.169 --> 00:04:31.080
a festive beverage with full body and
great spice. Whether you add real pumpkin

00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:35.210
or not, Northern Brewer's Smashing Pumpkin
Ale is a perfect treat for friends and

00:04:35.210 --> 00:04:37.380
family during the holiday season.
