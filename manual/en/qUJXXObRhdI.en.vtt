00:00:03.394 --> 00:00:06.695
&gt;&gt; The President:
Well, I want to welcome the
congressional leadership here

00:00:06.695 --> 00:00:09.895
and thank them for their time.

00:00:09.895 --> 00:00:15.728
I think we're all aware that we
have some urgent business to do.

00:00:15.728 --> 00:00:18.361
We've got to make sure
that taxes don't go up on

00:00:18.361 --> 00:00:22.528
middle-class families, that
our economy remains strong,

00:00:22.528 --> 00:00:24.161
that we're creating jobs.

00:00:24.161 --> 00:00:28.061
And that's an agenda that
Democrats and Republicans and

00:00:28.061 --> 00:00:31.795
independents, people all
across the country share.

00:00:31.795 --> 00:00:37.127
So our challenge is to make sure
that we are able to cooperate

00:00:37.127 --> 00:00:40.528
together, work together,
find some common ground,

00:00:40.528 --> 00:00:44.761
make some tough compromises,
build some consensus to do the

00:00:44.761 --> 00:00:45.895
people's business.

00:00:45.895 --> 00:00:48.027
And what the folks
are looking for --

00:00:48.027 --> 00:00:49.828
and I think all of
us agree on this --

00:00:49.828 --> 00:00:50.828
is action.

00:00:50.828 --> 00:00:53.261
They want to see that
we are focused on them,

00:00:53.261 --> 00:00:56.695
not focused on our politics
here in Washington.

00:00:56.695 --> 00:01:00.861
So my hope is, is that this is
going to be the beginning of a

00:01:00.861 --> 00:01:04.127
fruitful process where we're
able to come to an agreement

00:01:04.127 --> 00:01:09.695
that will reduce our
deficit in a balanced way,

00:01:09.695 --> 00:01:12.895
that we will deal with some of
these long-term impediments to

00:01:12.895 --> 00:01:17.361
growth, and we're also going to
be focusing on making sure that

00:01:17.361 --> 00:01:20.127
middle-class families
are able to get ahead.

00:01:20.127 --> 00:01:22.528
So I want to thank all
the leadership for coming.

00:01:22.528 --> 00:01:26.127
And with that, we're
going to get to work.

00:01:26.127 --> 00:01:28.194
Thank you very much, everybody.

00:01:28.194 --> 00:01:28.994
Appreciate it.

00:01:28.994 --> 00:01:31.061
Oh, wait, wait, excuse me.

00:01:31.061 --> 00:01:34.528
There's actually one other
point that I want to make,

00:01:34.528 --> 00:01:37.528
and that is that my
understanding is tomorrow is

00:01:37.528 --> 00:01:39.328
Speaker Boehner's birthday.

00:01:39.328 --> 00:01:44.161
So for those of you who want to
wish him happy birthday we will

00:01:44.161 --> 00:01:46.494
-- we're not going to embarrass
him with a cake because we

00:01:46.494 --> 00:01:48.561
didn't know how many
candles were needed.

00:01:48.561 --> 00:01:49.928
[laughter]

00:01:49.928 --> 00:01:50.728
&gt;&gt; Speaker Boehner:
Yeah, right.

00:01:50.728 --> 00:01:51.761
[laughter]

00:01:51.761 --> 00:01:53.494
&gt;&gt; The President:
But we do want to wish
him a happy birthday.

00:01:53.494 --> 00:01:54.861
&gt;&gt; Speaker Boehner:
Thank you, thank you.

00:01:54.861 --> 00:01:56.061
&gt;&gt; The President:
All right, thank you, everybody.
