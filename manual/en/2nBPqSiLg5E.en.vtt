00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:22.300
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD, is the gradual loss of your ability to breathe effectively.

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:28.520
Normally, as you inhale, air moves freely through your trachea, or windpipe,

00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:31.500
then through large tubes called bronchi

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.300
smaller tubes called bronchioles

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:39.010
and finally into tiny sacs called alveoli.

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:44.390
Small blood vessels called capillaries
surround your alveoli.

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:49.660
Oxygen from the air you breathe passes into your capillaries

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:55.800
then carbon dioxide from your body passes out of your capillaries into your alveoli

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:00.120
so that your lungs can get rid of it when you exhale.

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:06.400
Normally, your airways and alveoli are
flexible and springy.

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.539
When you inhale each air sac inflates like a small balloon

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.440
and when you exhale the sacs deflate.

00:01:21.409 --> 00:01:24.749
Smoking is the leading cause of COPD.

00:01:24.749 --> 00:01:30.380
However, it may also be caused by long-term exposure to other lung irritants, such as

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:31.280
air pollution

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.240
chemical fumes

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:35.070
and dust.

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:42.560
If you have COPD, you have the two main
conditions that make up the disease

00:01:42.560 --> 00:01:45.240
emphysema and chronic bronchitis.

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:51.340
In emphysema, your airways and air sacs lose their flexibility,

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:54.720
making it harder for them to expand and contract.

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:00.620
Emphysema destroys some of your air sac walls,

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:06.740
leading to fewer, larger sacs that provide less area to absorb oxygen from the air you breathe.

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:11.029
The symptoms of emphysema include:

00:02:11.029 --> 00:02:11.920
wheezing

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:13.960
shortness of breath

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.840
and tightness in your chest.

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.440
With chronic bronchitis,

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:27.400
damage inside your airways causes
the lining to swell, thicken, and make mucus.

00:02:28.300 --> 00:02:33.400
You develop a persistent cough as your body attempts to get rid of the extra mucus.

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:39.680
the symptoms of chronic bronchitis include:

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:42.820
an ongoing cough that produces a lot of mucus

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.500
shortness of breath

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:47.200
and frequent respiratory infections.

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:57.040
The damage done to your lungs by COPD cannot be reversed, and there is no cure for the disease.

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:03.110
However, treatment can slow the progress of your disease, and help you feel better.

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:06.700
The most common treatments are:

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.300
quitting smoking

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:14.430
use of inhaled medicines to open your airways and reduce swelling

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:19.640
antibiotics for bronchitis caused by bacterial infection

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:26.840
oxygen therapy for those with advanced COPD and severely low levels of oxygen in their blood

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:32.800
and surgery, such as a bullectomy or lung
volume reduction surgery

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:35.800
to remove non-functioning air sacs.

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:44.800
The best way to prevent yourself from getting COPD is to never smoke.

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:50.710
If you are a smoker, quitting smoking reduces the chance you'll develop COPD.

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:58.020
You can also limit your exposure to chemicals, fumes, and dusts that may cause COPD.
