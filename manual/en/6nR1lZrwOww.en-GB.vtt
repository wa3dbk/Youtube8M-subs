00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:13.200
Is this the evolution?

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:18.080
Hi and welcome to a new video!

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:19.040
My name is Konzi...

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:20.080
...I am Luca...

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.080
...and today we will test the adidas X15!

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:24.080
Together with the Ace the X is the successor

00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:27.000
of the Predator, F50, 11Pro and Nitrocharge.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.860
Stay tuned to find out if it's an upgrade to the previous models!

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:02.540
The X15.1 offers a great fit and comfort.

00:02:02.540 --> 00:02:07.180
I didn't have any blisters or pressure marks in six weeks.

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:11.920
Also the fit is really tight.

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:19.320
Thus, players with wide feet may have problems with fit.

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:48.300
The snug and thin upper offers a great feel for the ball.

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:51.780
However, the upper is a bit too stiff for me.

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:58.140
I also missed extra grip applications similar to the Ace.

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:26.380
There are a few weaknesses in terms of quality and durability.

00:03:26.380 --> 00:03:31.780
The quality could be a bit better - e.g. opening seams after six weeks.

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:33.780
However, this was only a visual problem.

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:36.800
Overall, the durability is really good.

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:41.340
Still, it's not as good as the Ace or the old F50.

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:22.200
The X15.1 is an excellent football boots.

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:25.560
Many people see him as the successor of the F50.

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:31.600
However, compared to the F50 2014 it lacks the lightness.

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:34.660
I also missed the barefoot-like feel.

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:37.580
The boot still convinced me.

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:40.100
The comfort and fit are really excellent!

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:43.540
Also the touch and durability are really good.

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:49.380
Although I miss the old F50, I still really like the new X15.1!

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:52.860
Therefore, I rate the boot with 9 out of 10 points!

00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:54.340
Finally let me know in the comments...

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:55.740
Which boot do you prefer?

00:04:55.740 --> 00:04:57.740
The new X or Ace?

00:04:57.740 --> 00:05:05.200
Leave your comment and let me know how you liked the video!

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:08.500
