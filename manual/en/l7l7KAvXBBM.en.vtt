00:00:01.940 --> 00:00:06.730
Food from your own garden. 
 It's cheap, healthy, and it makes you happier.

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:10.830
Author Toor de Haas has written a book entitled "Simple Happiness".  

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.040
This is New Zealand spinach. 
 You only use the leaves. It's delicious.

00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:19.540
That's cucumber herb, borage with blue flowers. It tastes like cucumber.

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:22.900
You can use sea cale 
 in all recipes that contain broccoli.

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:26.970
Sage. If you buy a little branch in a store 
 it costs a fortune. 

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:29.990
My garden is full of sage. 
 Delicious!

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:32.870
You can even enjoy weeds.

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:36.980
Dandelion leaves. They're very healthy 
 particularly in the spring, but now too.

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.060
'Weeds' is of course a strange word. 
 I prefer to call them spices.

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:46.820
Because they have so many good substances and they're free.

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:52.470
According to Toor, everyone can live cheaply and consciously 
 with their own vegetables and fruit...

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:55.550
whether you have a big garden 
 or a small balcony.

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:04.890
There are a lot of vegetable plants that climb, 
 and almost all leguminous plants hardly need any space.

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:07.840
There are many fruit plants that climb.

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.260
Tonight she's having pasta 
 with basil and pumpkin seeds...

00:01:12.710 --> 00:01:15.940
and for desert 
 biological yoghurt with Japanese wineberries.

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:20.750
Everything, except for the pasta and yoghurt, 
 comes from her own garden. So it's very cheap.

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:24.840
It's delicious. With a tomato salad 
 it makes for a very healthy meal.

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:30.360
Her book is full of healthy recipes, 
 costing 50 cents or less.

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.340
But the book isn't only designed for poor people.

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:35.790
It's much more than a cookbook.

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:39.840
It's about how you relate to the world, 
 how you treat yourself...

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:44.590
how to take care of yourself. 
 As far as vitamines are concerned...

00:01:44.790 --> 00:01:46.590
do you get the ones you need? 

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:52.970
So it's also about culture, 
 art, religion and nature.

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:55.770
I think that people who work long hours...

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:59.410
and who may have a lot of money, they just keep on going.

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:03.160
I believe they sometimes don't think enough about themselves.

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:07.380
Spend some time hulling beans. 
 It calms you down.

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:10.210
And it forces you to slow down.

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:16.890
The pesto is ready for tonight's pasta.

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:24.490
I think it costs less than 50 cents, 
 including the spaghetti.

00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:29.100
Author Toor de Haas lives very consciously.

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:33.990
So it's not surprising that she chose 
 to call her book "Simple Happiness". 

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:39.310
What I mean is that you can have 
 a high quality of living with very little.

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:42.600
And then you can enjoy it.

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:47.920
To enjoy it a lot. 
 That's an unbelievable mine of wealth, especially if you're poor.

00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:54.310
Then I think that it's even more important. 
 If you really enjoy something, what else else do you need?

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.440
Yes, that's it.
