00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:02.180
I am in Baton Rouge, Louisiana

00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:06.540
How do I know that? Because it is written in enormous letters on this levee just here.

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:11.680
And this levee is on the Mississippi River, the most important river in America.

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:15.540
Not just because of the amount of water that it moves, but because of the amount of cargo.

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:17.840
Look at all these barges just here

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:23.320
that are waiting to have whatever they are carrying moved to the container ports

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:28.480
and to the factories that line this river for miles and miles and miles and miles.

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:30.640
But here is a problem, and something you might not know.

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:34.040
The Mississippi river doesn't want to be here anymore.

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:36.920
You see about a century ago, in the age of steamboats

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:42.480
there was a bend in the river about 80 miles away from here called Turnbull's Bend

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.180
And that took you twenty miles out of your way

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.980
and of course, we're humans, we don't stand for that

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:51.520
So a canal was built to cut that bend out of the way

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.580
Now that caused a problem

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.920
hydraulagic-- hydra-- hydral-- hyda-- that's a difficult word to say

00:00:57.140 --> 00:00:59.780
Hydraulogic hydrologic hydra...

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.600
Water modelling wasn't really a science back then

00:01:03.800 --> 00:01:06.560
It was more a case of just try it and see what works

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:08.260
So that new canal

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:11.620
combined with the removal of a log jam on the Atchafalaya River

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:14.240
meant that the Mississippi wanted to move.

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:19.080
It had found a much faster, steeper, and quicker route to the sea

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.400
So gravity took it that way

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:23.960
Suddenly, the Mississippi didn't want to go this way

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.020
It wanted to go down the course of the Atchafalaya River

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:27.900
a completely different route to the ocean

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:30.140
and that is a big problem because here

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.100
we have all these factories

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:33.100
all these container docks

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.420
built, and relying on this river

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:42.800
The Mississippi moving would be a multi billion dollar, possibly even a trillion dollar disaster for America

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:45.280
And so, 80 miles upstream from here

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:47.600
where once there was Turnbulls Bend

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:50.380
is now the Old River Control Structure

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:52.600
Built by the US Army Corps of Engineers,

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.220
who are the frankly amazing group who handle

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:57.480
enormous public works and dams in America

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:02.880
The Old River Control Structure means that the Atchafalaya River is dammed

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:03.520
is stopped

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:05.520
and 70% of the flow coming into it

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.520
still moves down the Mississippi

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.920
It is, a battleground, if you like, between humans

00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.520
trying to keep our world working

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.140
and nature, which very much wants to go its own way

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:17.880
so there you go

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:18.800
something you might not know

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.160
the Mississippi River really doesn't want to be here anymore

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:24.660
