00:00:01.099 --> 00:00:04.060
Today is a glorious day for our Sonic the
Hedgehog fans.

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:06.630
Sonic Dash has landed and it looks amazing!

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:09.320
For those of you just hearing about the title, Sonic Dash is an endless runner
comments on the crashes and endless

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:11.909
developed by Hardlight Studios.

00:00:11.909 --> 00:00:15.249
Sonic Dash takes place in Seaside Hill. One of the stages found in

00:00:15.249 --> 00:00:17.630
Sonic Adventure and Sonic Generations.

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:20.509
How does the game stack up?

00:00:20.509 --> 00:00:21.949
Let's... JUMP... straight in.

00:00:21.949 --> 00:00:26.299
As an endless runner, it's not difficult
to see where Sonic Dash gets its inspiration.

00:00:26.299 --> 00:00:28.769
The game is in the "Temple Run" style -

00:00:28.769 --> 00:00:33.329
a 3D, third-person action game using tap and swipe gestures to guide your hero.

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.790
In fact, Sonic fits so unbelievably well in to this style of game, it's hard

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:38.180
to imagine why SEGA waited

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:40.430
this long to bring us a title like this.

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:43.320
Your little blue hedgehog is running,
endlessly.

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:46.530
The player swipes left and right to change the lane that Sonic is in.

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.070
Swiping up makes the character jump and swiping down not only causes Sonic to

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.330
perform a rolling maneuver

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:54.440
but brings you quickly back to solid ground if airborne.

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.500
As with all Sonic titles, of course you'll be collecting rings as you go.

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.140
These not only act as the primary currency of the game but grant the player immunity from

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:04.420
death should you run in to an obstacle...

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:07.050
...at the cost of all the rings in your
possession.

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:10.840
Sonic Dash requires the player to "bank" these between each stage of the game to

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.180
upgrade the character when not playing.

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:16.890
Interestingly, the player has the choice of either doing this or risking all the

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:20.960
rings you've collected so far by choosing
not to bank them and instead choosing one of

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:22.619
the alternative paths.

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.209
By doing this you have the chance to
gain bonus rings and see different

00:01:26.209 --> 00:01:29.450
sections of the game, like Sonic's
iconic loop-de-loops.

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:33.160
During these sections, the camera zooms and gives a more cinematic feel.

00:01:33.160 --> 00:01:36.370
The player can still manipulate Sonic during these parts and although it's difficult

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:39.750
to see what's actually going on, it's still a nice feeling collecting a few rings

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:40.780
along the way.

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:44.230
That's pretty much it. Run for as long as
you can, jumping, spinning and attacking while

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:48.740
collecting rings and powerups. Endless runner staples like the magnet that will temporarily allow you 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.230
to collect all the rings you run past without having to touch them.

00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:56.090
There are few major differences between
Sonic Dash and its distant cousin Temple Run.

00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:59.810
First of all, while the game is on par
graphically with Temple Run, Sonic Dash

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.100
seems much, much faster.

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.180
The sense of speed you get from our little blue-haired friend is pretty damn good and the

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.279
graphics look amazing on the iPhone 5's
retina display.

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:14.209
As with most endless runners, the game leans heavily towards in-app purchases.

00:02:14.209 --> 00:02:17.939
No, you don't necessarily have to spend your cash as both rings and the game's

00:02:17.939 --> 00:02:20.740
secondary currency red stars can be earned,

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:23.219
albeit slowly, through normal play.

00:02:23.219 --> 00:02:27.139
Even though it's unfortunate that the game industry and mobile gaming specifically are

00:02:27.139 --> 00:02:30.129
headed down this path, I generally don't
have a problem with it.

00:02:30.129 --> 00:02:34.219
Some games however tend to feel a little
heavy-handed, almost exploitative and

00:02:34.219 --> 00:02:37.139
unfortunately, Sonic Dash is exception.

00:02:37.139 --> 00:02:40.639
The cost of the unlockable characters is
pretty high. You'll need to be playing a

00:02:40.639 --> 00:02:43.739
considerable amount before being able to afford these without spending real-world

00:02:43.739 --> 00:02:47.689
world money. Unfortunately, unlocking extra characters does nothing more than 

00:02:47.689 --> 00:02:49.599
change the skin of the hero.

00:02:49.599 --> 00:02:52.149
The gameplay remains exactly the same.

00:02:52.149 --> 00:02:55.369
Now the game does grant a few bonus stars here and there, but this seems to be

00:02:55.369 --> 00:02:58.169
nothing more than a mind washing technique -

00:02:58.169 --> 00:03:01.669
getting the player in the mind frame that these shiny red stars aren't only necessary,

00:03:01.669 --> 00:03:03.549
but rare and special.

00:03:03.549 --> 00:03:06.089
This ties in heavily with my second gripe.

00:03:06.089 --> 00:03:09.229
When the player dies, instead of being able to spend a boost purchased with 

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:12.819
primary currency (like with the original
Temple Run allowed you to do), you now have

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:16.699
the opportunity to continue your run with expendable continues purchased with red stars.

00:03:17.709 --> 00:03:21.290
This will unfortunately allow players who spend a lot of cash to rise quickly to

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:24.599
the top of the leaderboards, which brings me to my next point.

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:28.849
I hate to say it, but the game feels
dangerously close to being unfair.

00:03:28.849 --> 00:03:31.870
You see, the level design, or more
specifically, the layout of the tracks

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:34.979
can be... well... difficult.

00:03:34.979 --> 00:03:38.159
It's an all too common occurrence that
you'll find a spiky enemy on

00:03:38.159 --> 00:03:39.710
the opposite side of a wall

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:43.470
or wall and beam segments packed so closely together that there's really nothing the player

00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:46.809
can do except run into an obstacle and bring their run to an end.

00:03:46.809 --> 00:03:49.869
I'm not saying it's impossible, but it is
extremely difficult -

00:03:49.869 --> 00:03:52.169
this is not a casual runner.

00:03:52.169 --> 00:03:55.829
A few of the game mechanics weren't covered very clearly during the tutorial.

00:03:55.829 --> 00:03:59.279
The first being where you need to jump a chasm and dash

00:03:59.279 --> 00:04:01.589
attack a shark to cross the gap.

00:04:01.589 --> 00:04:05.180
The game tells you to jump and tap accordingly, however the speed at which you need

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:07.319
to comprehend and execute this move,

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:10.629
especially the first couple of times, is
pretty silly.

00:04:10.629 --> 00:04:13.949
Also, the ability to swipe down to return to the ground quickly wasn't covered at all.

00:04:13.949 --> 00:04:17.739
Trust me, this is vital during those closely packed together sections I was referring to before.

00:04:17.739 --> 00:04:21.999
It also would've been nice to see a tilt-to-move mechanic for a more

00:04:21.999 --> 00:04:26.050
visceral experience rather than the changing fixed lanes by swiping,

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:29.569
but for the most part this doesn't
hamper the experience too much.

00:04:29.569 --> 00:04:32.580
Sonic Dash is an excellent game, no doubt about it - 

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:34.770
but it just feels really commercial.

00:04:34.770 --> 00:04:38.080
Sure companies need to make money but
considering the game will already

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:39.449
set you back $1.99,

00:04:39.449 --> 00:04:42.580
it would've been nice to see the game being a little more forgiving.

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:45.729
Hardcore Sonic fans, and fans of the endless runner genre will find a great deal of enjoyment here.

00:04:47.199 --> 00:04:50.629
The game is universal so it will run on both iPad and iPhone.

00:04:50.629 --> 00:04:52.520
There'll be a link in the description below.

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:56.800
