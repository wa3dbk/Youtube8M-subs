00:00:00.826 --> 00:00:01.486
&gt;&gt; Welcome back.

00:00:01.486 --> 00:00:02.286
I'm Curtis Smith.

00:00:02.406 --> 00:00:04.176
Today we're visiting
Lee County again,

00:00:04.176 --> 00:00:06.616
the Lee County Extension
Service Master Gardeners.

00:00:07.036 --> 00:00:09.196
Shelly Marsh-Rice is
going to show us some

00:00:09.196 --> 00:00:11.166
of the things people are having
problems with over on this side

00:00:11.166 --> 00:00:13.776
of the state, things that should
be of real interest to you.

00:00:13.986 --> 00:00:14.896
Shelly, what do we have here?

00:00:15.296 --> 00:00:19.646
&gt;&gt; Well, this winter
we've had more moisture

00:00:19.646 --> 00:00:22.196
and winter damage than usual.

00:00:22.236 --> 00:00:24.076
We've had a few ice storms.

00:00:24.136 --> 00:00:26.666
And one of my trees,
a willow tree,

00:00:26.996 --> 00:00:28.196
took a pretty good beating.

00:00:28.596 --> 00:00:32.456
And I don't know exactly what
to address on this issue here.

00:00:32.456 --> 00:00:34.096
&gt;&gt; You can't complain
about the moisture, but --

00:00:34.096 --> 00:00:35.556
&gt;&gt; No, you can't complain
about the moisture.

00:00:35.556 --> 00:00:37.826
Who says it never
rains, it never snows.

00:00:37.826 --> 00:00:39.566
&gt;&gt; Right. But when it does,
something else happens.

00:00:39.726 --> 00:00:40.226
&gt;&gt; That's right.

00:00:40.226 --> 00:00:40.776
&gt;&gt; And we have to
deal with this.

00:00:40.776 --> 00:00:41.856
And this is a common problem.

00:00:41.856 --> 00:00:44.496
A lot of people in New Mexico
have branches that break either

00:00:44.496 --> 00:00:45.686
in the summer or in the winter

00:00:45.686 --> 00:00:46.646
and they wonder what
to do with it.

00:00:46.676 --> 00:00:47.576
So this is a real good one.

00:00:47.576 --> 00:00:50.086
And what we looked at
here is what should we do?

00:00:50.566 --> 00:00:51.706
You've got this spar here.

00:00:51.706 --> 00:00:53.436
You could cut that off
but that's still going

00:00:53.436 --> 00:00:55.736
to leave a scar on the
underside of the other branch.

00:00:55.736 --> 00:00:56.236
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:00:56.236 --> 00:00:58.186
&gt;&gt; So it's probably better
to remove that whole branch.

00:00:59.046 --> 00:01:00.336
And that's cutting a lot out.

00:01:01.016 --> 00:01:02.686
But looking at this
particular tree,

00:01:02.686 --> 00:01:03.796
it's right next to a fence.

00:01:04.756 --> 00:01:06.066
You've got a pole
that runs through it.

00:01:06.196 --> 00:01:07.786
&gt;&gt; And it's awfully close to it.

00:01:07.916 --> 00:01:09.426
&gt;&gt; Yeah. And so you're
going to have a problem

00:01:09.426 --> 00:01:10.266
in the future with that.

00:01:10.266 --> 00:01:12.696
So it's probably better to
remove that whole branch.

00:01:12.696 --> 00:01:13.666
You want to bring
it down in pieces.

00:01:13.666 --> 00:01:15.546
If you cut it right now,
you're going to bend the fence.

00:01:16.526 --> 00:01:18.526
But you can begin
taking pieces of that out

00:01:18.526 --> 00:01:19.846
and then prune it
out at the base here.

00:01:20.266 --> 00:01:20.766
&gt;&gt; I see.

00:01:20.766 --> 00:01:21.666
&gt;&gt; And prune properly.

00:01:21.876 --> 00:01:24.436
As I look at this I see a
hollow spot down below it.

00:01:24.566 --> 00:01:25.146
&gt;&gt; There is.

00:01:25.146 --> 00:01:27.446
&gt;&gt; That means there is some
rot, probably from a pruning cut

00:01:27.446 --> 00:01:29.016
or a broken branch
that happened early.

00:01:29.016 --> 00:01:32.556
Cottonwoods and willows are
very prone to such things.

00:01:32.756 --> 00:01:34.806
So that means this is
a weak branch anyway.

00:01:34.986 --> 00:01:36.996
It's probably going to
split out in some wind.

00:01:36.996 --> 00:01:38.896
You're lucky the whole thing
didn't break with the ice.

00:01:39.496 --> 00:01:41.766
So it's probably wise to
remove this whole branch.

00:01:41.936 --> 00:01:44.366
It's going to remove a lot
of your shade but it's going

00:01:44.366 --> 00:01:45.696
to prevent future problems.

00:01:45.966 --> 00:01:46.466
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:01:46.636 --> 00:01:47.936
&gt;&gt; And you want to
prune it properly.

00:01:47.936 --> 00:01:50.766
You want to check with your
county agent or publication

00:01:50.766 --> 00:01:53.306
to show you how to properly
prune because a portion

00:01:53.306 --> 00:01:55.616
of this branch, though
-- kind of at the base --

00:01:55.616 --> 00:01:56.766
really belongs to the trunk.

00:01:57.006 --> 00:01:59.106
And when you prune it we want
to make sure we don't cut

00:01:59.106 --> 00:02:01.406
into the tissues that
belong to the trunk.

00:02:02.106 --> 00:02:06.206
&gt;&gt; But now what we were looking
for is to get the rotten part

00:02:06.206 --> 00:02:07.936
out of under here also.

00:02:07.936 --> 00:02:09.536
&gt;&gt; Well, down here you're not
going to be able to remove that.

00:02:09.696 --> 00:02:10.196
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:02:10.196 --> 00:02:11.016
&gt;&gt; So you're just going to cut

00:02:11.016 --> 00:02:13.316
that so the branch doesn't
break because of the rot.

00:02:13.766 --> 00:02:15.436
&gt;&gt; Now is there something
I should treat it

00:02:15.436 --> 00:02:17.296
with after we prune it?

00:02:17.326 --> 00:02:18.406
&gt;&gt; Good question and really no.

00:02:18.436 --> 00:02:20.156
You make a pruning cut
in the proper place,

00:02:21.236 --> 00:02:23.276
the tree will take
care of itself.

00:02:23.776 --> 00:02:24.656
Trees in this group --

00:02:25.016 --> 00:02:27.406
very, very soft wood
prone to rotting --

00:02:27.756 --> 00:02:28.936
are going to have
problems anyway.

00:02:28.936 --> 00:02:29.706
They're already there.

00:02:30.336 --> 00:02:32.356
This tree is, because it's
showing the rot there,

00:02:32.466 --> 00:02:33.976
is on its last legs now.

00:02:34.326 --> 00:02:36.376
You might want to plant
another tree somewhere nearby.

00:02:37.366 --> 00:02:37.866
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:02:37.866 --> 00:02:40.486
&gt;&gt; So that you've got a new tree
once this one finally does go

00:02:40.486 --> 00:02:42.006
out because you need the shade.

00:02:42.216 --> 00:02:45.646
&gt;&gt; Right. And it will
eventually go out with a --

00:02:45.736 --> 00:02:48.766
&gt;&gt; Well, cottonwoods,
willows, trees like that tend

00:02:48.766 --> 00:02:49.846
to be fairly short-lived.

00:02:49.986 --> 00:02:50.486
&gt;&gt; I see.

00:02:50.486 --> 00:02:51.156
&gt;&gt; Especially in this area.

00:02:51.346 --> 00:02:54.026
And so if you can get 30-40
years, you're doing really good.

00:02:54.766 --> 00:02:55.906
Some don't even make
it that long.

00:02:55.996 --> 00:02:56.496
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:02:57.386 --> 00:02:58.686
&gt;&gt; OK, but that's
a good question.

00:02:58.686 --> 00:03:00.316
And I see you've brought
us something else as well.

00:03:00.476 --> 00:03:04.376
&gt;&gt; Yes. We have several of
our master gardeners and one

00:03:04.376 --> 00:03:06.356
of them brought the grapes in.

00:03:06.686 --> 00:03:09.126
And she's trying
to propagate them.

00:03:09.126 --> 00:03:13.536
And she had them in a utility
room that got fairly cold

00:03:13.536 --> 00:03:15.966
and they leafed out and
then they just quit.

00:03:16.796 --> 00:03:17.916
&gt;&gt; OK, I see some problems.

00:03:17.916 --> 00:03:20.356
Look at that -- there's
a wound over here.

00:03:20.356 --> 00:03:21.046
Ah, it's not bad.

00:03:21.046 --> 00:03:22.766
That's just where the
bark is drying up.

00:03:23.256 --> 00:03:25.226
The big problem on
this one is the cool.

00:03:25.866 --> 00:03:27.606
This would root better
if it were warmer.

00:03:28.316 --> 00:03:29.746
&gt;&gt; Is there a certain
temperature

00:03:29.746 --> 00:03:30.836
that the water ought to be?

00:03:30.836 --> 00:03:33.096
&gt;&gt; You want to keep the water
up around 70 degrees or so.

00:03:33.376 --> 00:03:33.916
&gt;&gt; I see.

00:03:34.286 --> 00:03:35.706
&gt;&gt; And the air can be cooler.

00:03:35.706 --> 00:03:37.716
In fact, a lot of
plants propagate better

00:03:37.716 --> 00:03:39.006
if they have what's
called bottom heat.

00:03:39.366 --> 00:03:39.866
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:03:39.866 --> 00:03:40.566
&gt;&gt; So you're heating the soil

00:03:40.566 --> 00:03:42.126
and letting the top
portion be cool.

00:03:42.126 --> 00:03:44.376
And one thing I've
tried in the past is

00:03:44.406 --> 00:03:46.106
to put an aquarium heater --

00:03:46.316 --> 00:03:46.816
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:03:46.876 --> 00:03:47.596
&gt;&gt; Inside there.

00:03:47.986 --> 00:03:49.586
Set it so it's just
keeping it warm.

00:03:49.586 --> 00:03:50.366
Put a thermometer in because

00:03:50.366 --> 00:03:51.636
if you make it too
hot you'll cook them.

00:03:52.286 --> 00:03:53.796
So put a thermometer in.

00:03:53.796 --> 00:03:57.626
Set it so it's staying 70-75
degrees whereas the top's cool.

00:03:57.626 --> 00:03:59.816
And that should increase
the chance of rooting.

00:03:59.816 --> 00:04:01.146
And I've seen that
actually work --

00:04:01.146 --> 00:04:01.646
&gt;&gt; I see.

00:04:01.646 --> 00:04:02.276
&gt;&gt; With a begonia.

00:04:03.136 --> 00:04:04.426
It wouldn't root,
it wouldn't root,

00:04:04.776 --> 00:04:06.176
and you put the aquarium
heater in

00:04:06.176 --> 00:04:07.396
and it grew roots very quickly.

00:04:08.026 --> 00:04:08.526
&gt;&gt; I see.

00:04:08.526 --> 00:04:10.226
&gt;&gt; So that's something that
might work to help you.

00:04:10.546 --> 00:04:12.346
And of course you can
also stick them in soil.

00:04:12.596 --> 00:04:17.716
&gt;&gt; Now Curtis, in a situation
like this, if it were in a house

00:04:17.716 --> 00:04:20.666
and just at room
temperature would it root?

00:04:20.666 --> 00:04:22.246
&gt;&gt; It depends on what
your room temperature is.

00:04:22.426 --> 00:04:24.226
And with cost of gas these days,

00:04:24.226 --> 00:04:25.766
a lot of people are
cooling their house off

00:04:25.766 --> 00:04:26.996
and that's causing a problem.

00:04:27.706 --> 00:04:30.906
If you're keeping your
house up around 80 degrees,

00:04:31.176 --> 00:04:33.946
70 to 80 degrees, it'll
probably root a lot better.

00:04:34.486 --> 00:04:35.956
But in a place where
it does cool off,

00:04:36.036 --> 00:04:38.026
a lot of the times
water does stay cool,

00:04:38.346 --> 00:04:39.116
it's going to be slow.

00:04:40.436 --> 00:04:43.656
&gt;&gt; And a lot of people are
cutting their heaters off

00:04:43.656 --> 00:04:46.926
at night, too, with the
cost of electricity and gas.

00:04:47.196 --> 00:04:48.016
&gt;&gt; That can affect it.

00:04:48.116 --> 00:04:49.536
Now, it doesn't hurt
to have diurnal

00:04:49.756 --> 00:04:51.476
or day-night temperature
variations

00:04:52.696 --> 00:04:54.286
but it's going to
have some effect.

00:04:54.286 --> 00:04:55.126
It will slow it down.

00:04:55.546 --> 00:04:56.626
&gt;&gt; And what about lighting?

00:04:57.776 --> 00:04:59.676
&gt;&gt; Light is important
once the leaves appear.

00:04:59.916 --> 00:05:01.636
Until the leaves
appear you're OK.

00:05:02.656 --> 00:05:04.316
When the leaves come
out, then you need light.

00:05:04.316 --> 00:05:06.296
Now having leaves is not bad

00:05:07.356 --> 00:05:08.446
because you've still
got the water.

00:05:08.496 --> 00:05:09.816
As long as it's drawing
water up.

00:05:09.816 --> 00:05:11.246
Now, see, these are
wilting and it looks

00:05:11.246 --> 00:05:14.346
like there's a little powdery
mildew developing on it.

00:05:14.346 --> 00:05:17.716
But the leaves will create
sugars which will translocate

00:05:17.716 --> 00:05:19.096
to the bottom and
feed the growth

00:05:19.146 --> 00:05:20.316
of roots which is important.

00:05:20.496 --> 00:05:20.996
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:05:21.476 --> 00:05:23.406
&gt;&gt; But there's enough
sugar stored in the stems

00:05:23.806 --> 00:05:26.076
that if the leaves don't
appear it can still grow roots

00:05:26.076 --> 00:05:27.386
and then the leaves will
come out afterwards.

00:05:27.676 --> 00:05:30.106
The powdery mildew,
though, is a concern.

00:05:30.106 --> 00:05:31.966
The humidity is related to that.

00:05:32.656 --> 00:05:33.626
The cool temperatures --

00:05:33.806 --> 00:05:35.746
&gt;&gt; That's not something
that we've dealt

00:05:35.746 --> 00:05:38.756
with in this county much
because it's usually so dry,

00:05:38.756 --> 00:05:40.196
but with the moisture
we've had --

00:05:40.276 --> 00:05:42.556
&gt;&gt; In a greenhouse or
in a closed environment

00:05:42.556 --> 00:05:45.296
such as a utility room, that's
something you watch out for.

00:05:46.416 --> 00:05:47.736
And diseases.

00:05:48.176 --> 00:05:49.226
And I noticed down at the bottom

00:05:49.226 --> 00:05:51.166
of this some mold is
beginning to grow.

00:05:51.556 --> 00:05:53.166
You might want to change
the water periodically,

00:05:53.216 --> 00:05:56.146
maybe do some things to
protect it from rotting.

00:05:56.846 --> 00:05:57.496
It's a good one, though.

00:05:57.496 --> 00:05:58.716
It's nice to start
your plants early.

00:05:58.986 --> 00:06:01.326
I appreciate you bringing
these things in to show us.

00:06:01.496 --> 00:06:03.156
&gt;&gt; Well we appreciate
you, good Curtis.

00:06:03.496 --> 00:06:03.996
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Shelly.
