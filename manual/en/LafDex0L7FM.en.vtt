00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.029
The bulk of your people are working on your products,

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:10.884
it's a creative, active thing.

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:17.389
And it is the group that generates your revenue,

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:19.484
but it's also where your costs are.

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:22.859
So I don't mean it's the Hungry Beast in the derogatory sense,

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:24.939
but it's this beast that's got to be fed.

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:27.019
Or think like the news or newspapers,

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:29.379
right you've got to feed this thing.

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:33.304
So upfront we have to generate new ideas,

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:37.569
what happens with a lot of companies is after the founders go away

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:42.589
or move on or get hit by cars or whatever happens to founders,

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:45.869
the most organized people are the ones who run the beast.

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.409
So they put those people over the whole thing and they bring the

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.149
values to the upfront process which is okay let's go on schedule,

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:57.769
let's get this, because we've got to feed this beast here.

00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:01.029
Our issue, and I think this is true in most places,

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:04.938
is the very nature of what we're doing at the front is fundamentally

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:07.504
different than when we're running the beast.

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:11.329
We're doing something which is unknown, we're in wild territory,

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:14.069
we don't what's going to happen and what

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:17.929
we first do - or if I think of movies,

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:21.349
people think making the movie sounds exciting,

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:22.449
and it is exciting.

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:24.969
But there's an imagination of what it must be like.

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:27.919
It's sort of like having this beautiful baby and that

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.349
baby grows up to be this beautiful movie star.

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:33.889
But what do you do if the baby is ugly?

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.784
And that is our reality, is that the new ideas are fragile,

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:42.129
they don't look good, they take protection,

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:45.139
you cannot judge them at that point.

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:47.959
You can see how well the team is working

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.364
together but you can't judge the ideas.

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:55.644
So we have to go from that stage to somehow with engagement

00:01:55.770 --> 00:01:59.279
with that beast and this is a long process but the normal

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.140
thing that happens is people screw up the front-end.
