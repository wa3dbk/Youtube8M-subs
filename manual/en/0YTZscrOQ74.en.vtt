00:00:09.705 --> 00:00:13.901
Chrysalis:

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:13.901
This Day is going to be Perfect.

00:00:14.264 --> 00:00:18.375
The kind of day of which I've dreamed since I was small.

00:00:19.142 --> 00:00:20.670
Everypony will gather 'round

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.145
Say I look lovely in my gown

00:00:23.145 --> 00:00:27.117
What they don't know is that I have fooled them all...

This day was going to be perfect

00:00:31.603 --> 00:00:35.707
The kind of day of which I've dreamed since I was small.

00:00:35.707 --> 00:00:38.134
But instead of having cake

00:00:38.823 --> 00:00:40.527
with all my friends to celebrate

00:00:40.527 --> 00:00:44.637
My wedding bells, they may not ring for me at all.

00:00:44.637 --> 00:00:46.063
Chrysalis:

00:00:44.637 --> 00:00:46.063
I could care less

00:00:46.063 --> 00:00:46.893
about the dress

00:00:46.893 --> 00:00:48.304
I won't partake

00:00:48.304 --> 00:00:49.421
in any cake

00:00:49.744 --> 00:00:52.702
Vows? Well I'll be lying when I say

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.184
That through any kind of weather

00:00:54.952 --> 00:00:57.105
I'll want us to be together

00:00:57.084 --> 00:01:01.325
The truth is I don't care for him at all.

00:01:01.642 --> 00:01:04.521
No, I do not love the groom.

00:01:04.521 --> 00:01:08.337
In my heart, there is no room.

00:01:08.337 --> 00:01:15.013
But I still want him to be all mine.

00:01:15.013 --> 00:01:17.268
Cadence:

00:01:15.013 --> 00:01:17.268
We must escape before it's too late

00:01:17.268 --> 00:01:18.889
Find a way to save the day!

00:01:19.403 --> 00:01:22.373
Hope? I'd be lying if I say

00:01:22.373 --> 00:01:24.718
That I don't fear that I may lose him

00:01:25.018 --> 00:01:26.638
To one who wants to use him

00:01:26.638 --> 00:01:29.842
Not care for, love, and cherish him each day.

00:01:29.842 --> 00:01:33.920
For I oh so love the groom.

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:37.250
All my thoughts, he does consume.          (CRY D:)

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:44.048
Oh Shining Armor, I'll be there very soon!

00:01:53.323 --> 00:01:57.179
Chrysalis:

00:01:53.323 --> 00:01:57.179
Finally, the moment has arrived

00:01:57.179 --> 00:02:00.891
For me to be one lucky bride

00:02:01.364 --> 00:02:03.114
Cadence:

00:02:01.364 --> 00:02:03.114
Oh, the wedding we won't make

00:02:03.114 --> 00:02:05.155
He'll end up marrying a fake

00:02:05.155 --> 00:02:07.143
Shining Armor will be-

00:02:07.143 --> 00:02:08.451
Chrysalis:

00:02:07.143 --> 00:02:08.451
Mine

00:02:08.451 --> 00:02:11.444
All mine

00:02:11.444 --> 00:02:12.397
Hahaahahahaah!!
