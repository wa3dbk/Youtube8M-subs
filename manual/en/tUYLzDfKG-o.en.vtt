Hi, my name is Vince with PlumbingSupply.com.

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:12.320
We'd like to thank you for joining us today
as we're going to show you how to swap out

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:13.760
a toilet trip lever.

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:18.730
In this case, we have a plastic trip lever
that we're going to swap out with this nice

00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:22.590
fancy brass one that we have in stock in our
warehouse.

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:28.380
For demonstration purposes we have this toilet
tank set up here, and some tools that you

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:31.800
might need are pliers or a wrench.

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.969
In this case, we're just going to use the
pliers.

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:41.930
So first off, you want to remove your old
trip lever.

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:47.730
In order to do that, you just unhook the toilet
flapper and you're going to take this nut

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:54.750
off which is opposite of what normal nuts
are, so righty-tighty lefty-loosey is not

00:00:54.750 --> 00:00:55.750
the case.

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:02.440
So in order to loosen this, you're going to
turn it to the right.

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:10.900
Unscrew it all the way and that will just
slide out.

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:20.570
Grab your fancy deluxe brass one, slide it
in, and this time we're going to tighten it

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:24.500
to the left.

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:31.130
Make sure we wrench it up so it doesn't loosen,
so we're going to put the wrench on it, and

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.799
just barely tighten it cause we don't want
to crack our tank.

00:01:35.799 --> 00:01:43.343
And then don't forget to put your flapper
back on, slip it through the holes, and there

00:01:43.343 --> 00:01:44.343
you have it.

00:01:44.343 --> 00:01:46.670
Once again, thank you for joining us today.
