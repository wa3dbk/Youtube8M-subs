00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:01.580
Hey guys,

00:00:01.580 --> 00:00:03.500
today's video is the second part of

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:05.340
my halloween special.

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:07.660
In my first video I showed you how to 

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:09.940
create a creepy doll make up,

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:12.880
make sure to watch this by time.

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:15.560
Why did I choose a creepy doll costume

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:17.900
for halloween?

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:22.280
Well, I thought it would be kind of a cool outfit

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:25.000
which not everybody has at home

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.360
and it's also a costume you can

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:29.920
make for yourself in an easy way.

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:32.060
The good thing is, you don't have to go

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:34.520
shopping, a simple dress in your closet 

00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:36.520
will also work well.

00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:39.640
I've chosen a lacy dress which reminds me

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:42.620
of the dresses dolls are usually wearing 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:45.240
actually kind of romantic.

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.120
Underneath I'm wearing a black tulle skirt,

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.420
a tutu, to bag the whole thing a little bit.

00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:55.100
But the very special part of this outfit 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.100
are these tights

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.960
which are about 36 euro in online shops.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.400
Well, I found that very expensive

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:05.400
for a one-time-worn-costume

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.060
so I decided to make these by myself.

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:10.460
I really like to share this DIY with you

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:13.220
so you can do this at home, so let's start!

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:15.400
Take your tights,

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.960
I decided to use white ones, because

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.380
it gives a more porcelain-doll-like look.

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:23.320
It's better to put them on

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:25.880
so you can outline the shape of your knees

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.700
with a light pencil.

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:31.420
Not a problem, if you can see all the contures

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:34.160
because everything will ne overpainted in the end

00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:37.080
and it's very important to do so,

00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:40.400
because you want your tights stay in the right place.

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:43.820
Leave a piece of paper or cardboard inside your tights

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:46.540
so the color will just stay on one side. 

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:48.420
Let's begin :)

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:51.860
Of course you need black and white acrylic colors

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:54.420
and a very thin brush to outline

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.720
 the  shapes of the dolly joints.

00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.860
So go ahead and take your black color

00:02:03.340 --> 00:02:09.180
and outline the lines from your pencil.

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.100
Ready with outlining on the front and back side

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:30.100
of the tights.

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:33.480
Now we have to shade everything a little bit 

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:37.880
to create a more realistc and plastic look.

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:41.860
So take a bigger brush with 

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:44.300
a mix of white and black color

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:46.980
but make sure to use a small amount of black color.

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.620
Let's start over here.

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:51.960
Betweet your black outlines and the shadows

00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:53.960
you are now creating, there has to be 

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.540
a clearly white line.

00:02:58.780 --> 00:03:01.380
Let me show you what I mean by that,

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:03.940
right over the black line

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:07.700
you have to leave a blank of white color.

00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:27.220
To give the outlines a more softer look

00:03:27.220 --> 00:03:29.360
I edited them with this small sponge.

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.120
The next thing we gonna do, is painting the

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:36.640
the inner sides in a darker way.

00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:40.160
This time we don't have to leave a gap

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:42.780
and just have to use the make up sponge

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:45.320
because that should work better.

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:47.320
You can use a brush as well, just as

00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:49.320
you like.

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:00.940
Here you can see the first knee

00:04:00.940 --> 00:04:03.160
the second one will be done in a few minutes.

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.860
Let me give you a wise tip: make sure to 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:08.240
use the sponge right from the beginning

00:04:08.240 --> 00:04:11.400
I decided to use this triangled casual make up sponge

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:14.140
because it has these tiny edges

00:04:14.140 --> 00:04:16.920
to work with, that's actually very nice. 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:21.500
If you want to, you can try it with a brush as well

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:22.900
like I did,

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:25.600
but believe me, it works better with a sponge,

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:28.240
Now off to the second knee 

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:30.240
and you will see the result in a moment.

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:33.080
Well now you know how to make yourself tights 

00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:35.660
which are easy to make and look very cool.

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:38.660
If you like you can do this for your arms as well

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:42.320
you can also use fleshings if you like,

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:44.320
just as you want to :)

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:47.200
I will give you some nice pictures on instagram

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:50.600
and facebook, so make sure to follow me there.

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:54.860
Are you going on a halloween party 

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:57.700
and if you're going, what costume are you wearing?

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:00.260
I really would like to know that, so please leave

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.820
your answers right in the comments below this video.

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:05.440
I'm looking forward to your comments

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:07.440
and hope to see you next time.

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:09.780
Byebye and HAPPY HALLOWEEN! :)
