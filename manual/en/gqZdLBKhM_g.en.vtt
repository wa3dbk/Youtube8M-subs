00:00:03.370 --> 00:00:10.370
Hunting in Vorpommern (germany) 2013

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:13.000
Note: This film contains scene of hunting and killing.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
He is the star of the story. But later.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:23.000
For the third time I went with a friend to hunt in the vicinity of Usedom. Far away from everyday life, we give ourselves back in those days the impressive nature and hunting in the field. For me, the highlight of the year, who was crowned this year by the hunting of my biggest buck.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Travel to east

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Arrival in the afternoon of May 8.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:43.000
The winter was long and snowy

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000
Therefore, the nature wakes up from its winter sleep late.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
The green is not so green. And the fields of oilseed rape are not so yellow.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000
Cranes and the regionally occurring crows

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:14.000
In the first trip through our hunting area this young buck crosses the path.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Morning stand hunting on 9 May at 3.45 h

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:35.000
40 meters in front of me meets deer family

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.000
now begins the selection

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.000
I select the one-year, female deer (german: Schmalreh) , which was pushed back by young roebuck.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:10.000
Warning: I will shoot. Could be noisy.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:23.000
The other deer react delayed, are confused by the situation.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:38.000
Then they go on living as before. They begin to eat.

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000
...and the day begins.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.000
Evening stand hunting and I'm sitting on my favorite place.

00:02:53.000 --> 00:03:02.000
In the morning there was no time to check the stand, the wasps are not a good sign when boarding. That does not seem enough, so sitting inside on the front shutter a hornet. Answered by prayer, then she flies away when the window opens. I take a deep breath and let my gaze wander in stand. I saw two small wasp nests. I removed the nests.Completely different kind of huntingfeaver shakes me here.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:10.000
At 5.30 pm: The sight of a big roebuck, which can be seen on the right corner of grasland lets me the noise of the seeking wasps forgotten.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:20.000
I can not look long strong sixpointer. In this region, the roe deer is generally very big.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:46.000
He goes directly to a bush. The buck lies under it and is not to be seen one hour.

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:52.000
6:30 p.m. The buck leaves his resting place.

00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:03.000
A great guy who seems to be old enough.

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:35.000
19:15 pm The bullet in the caliber 7x64 leaves the rifle Steyr GK. The buck is dead immediately.
Warning: I will shoot. Could be noisy.

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:45.000
After the repeating action ... breathing. Peace and quiet.
 I smoke three cigarettes.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.000
Then I can not wait anymore ...

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:31.000
The buck that I see, forcing me instantly to the ground. So powerful I have not rated him. For several minutes I try to conceive.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:39.000
It is tradition in Germany and so I thank my strongest ever hunted roe buck.

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:40.000
It is a german hunting tradition and  I thank my strongest ever hunted roe buck.

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:47.000
Now I see the moody light of the evening sky. And there is a feeling that can probably understand only a hunter.

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:56.000
The joy of hunting friend is big and we drink at least one drink emptied for the good of of the roebuck "Ascensio Domini". During the night, another hunting friend arrived. His gift of joy I could be two days later, when he was stalking a unique and highly strong buck in the same area in the morning and shoot ... but that's another story.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.000
Our last evening hunting brings reassurance and peace.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:10.000
Madness. A young buck who sees someone very similar.

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:28.000
He looks like my hunted roebuck, only much younger. So he has inherited successfully. And a new great guy takes his place.

00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:48.000
The last evening on the high seat with an amazing sunset to end.

00:06:48.000 --> 00:07:03.000
