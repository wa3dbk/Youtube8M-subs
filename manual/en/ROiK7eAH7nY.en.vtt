00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.330
Lighting
If you're impressed by the realism afforded

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:08.840
by these new consoles, it's probably the improvements
to lighting effects that are making the biggest

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:09.840
difference.

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:15.389
Our eyes are very accustomed to the way multiple
light sources fill a three-dimensional space,

00:00:15.389 --> 00:00:19.919
reflect off of different types of objects,
and cast shadows.

00:00:19.919 --> 00:00:25.460
To put it simply, these details haven't been
close to accurate on older consoles — they

00:00:25.460 --> 00:00:29.929
lack the horsepower required to handle all
of these effects.

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:36.040
With the jump to the PlayStation 4 and Xbox
One, however, light plays a far more convincing

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:37.980
role.

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.320
Resolution
The jump from the PlayStation 2 to the PlayStation

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:47.500
3 and from the Xbox to the Xbox 360 was one
of the most impressive generational leaps

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:52.290
ever because the new consoles brought high-definition
gaming to the living room.

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:56.831
While this year's new consoles don't offer
such a noticeable resolution increase, they

00:00:56.831 --> 00:00:59.090
do offer a marked improvement.

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:06.659
The truth is that the vast majority of Xbox
360 and PS3 games are rendered at 720p (or

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:11.100
sometimes lower) and then upscaled to play
on your 1080p TV.

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:19.889
The Xbox One and PlayStation 4, meanwhile,
can handle games that run natively at 1080p

00:01:19.889 --> 00:01:22.610
— or close to it.

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:26.109
Performance
Upgraded graphics don't mean much if the gameplay

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:28.590
is ruined as a result.

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:34.549
Fortunately, this isn't yet a problem for
the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:39.179
Developers are managing to reach at least
30 frames per second, which is the standard

00:01:39.179 --> 00:01:44.549
for most gameplay, while certain titles are
running at a buttery 60fps.

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:50.939
After spending time with multi-platform games
on the next-gen consoles, it's difficult to

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:56.549
imagine going back to the inconsistent and
middling performance of the older consoles.

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:02.399
Battlefield 4 feels entirely different across
the generations thanks to the jump from 30

00:02:02.399 --> 00:02:09.060
to 60fps, and Assassin's Creed 4 on next-gen
consoles largely does away with the troublesome

00:02:09.060 --> 00:02:14.570
frame-rate drops prevalent on the Xbox 360
and PS3.

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:21.310
We just wish more games ran at 60fps on the
new consoles — many suffice for a reasonable

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:23.420
but unimpressive 30fps.

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:29.630
PS4 vs. Xbox One
If the graphics upgrades between the two console

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:36.150
generations fail to impress you, the distinction
between the visuals on the Xbox One and PlayStation

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:38.730
4 will seem downright miniscule.

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:46.260
For this first batch of launch games, however,
Sony's console undoubtedly has the upper hand.

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:52.920
Across the multi-platform titles, the improvement
comes down to one factor: higher resolutions.

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:58.750
In the early running, most developers have
been more successful at running 1080p at reasonable

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:02.920
frame rates on the PlayStation 4 than on the
Xbox One.

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:10.150
Assassin's Creed 4: Black Flag and Call of
Duty: Ghosts, for example, run at 1080p on

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:17.880
Sony's console versus 900p and 720p, respectively,
on the Xbox One.

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:25.200
Battlefield 4, meanwhile, runs at 900p on
the PlayStation 4 compared to 720p on the

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.390
Xbox One.

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:31.561
Wrap Up
These multi-platform launch games, then, have

00:03:31.561 --> 00:03:36.460
tangible and noticeable improvements on the
PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:42.120
But there's no doubt that the majority of
these games simply do not amaze.

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:46.910
These titles don't offer a moment that makes
you say "now this is next gen."

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:52.920
Appreciated graphical upgrades aside, these
experiences don't feel that much different

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:57.710
than what the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 have
offered for years.

00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:02.600
In this way, the next generation has not yet
defined itself.

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:06.170
But truthfully, that shouldn't be surprising.

00:04:06.170 --> 00:04:10.720
It takes time for developers to grow comfortable
with new hardware and eke out everything a

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:12.990
platform has to offer.

00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:18.079
Launch titles in particular are not usually
very pretty (or very good).

00:04:18.079 --> 00:04:23.450
Compressed development schedules and brand-new
consoles aren't a good match for high-quality

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:24.450
games.

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:29.870
And, perhaps most importantly, console gaming
is now in a transitional period between the

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:35.280
two generations, and developers won't do their
best work for these new consoles until they're

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:41.300
free to leave the limitations of the PlayStation
3 and Xbox 360 behind.

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:46.430
If we want a true look at the future of what
these brand-new consoles can offer, we must

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:48.120
look at games designed solely for the next
generation.
