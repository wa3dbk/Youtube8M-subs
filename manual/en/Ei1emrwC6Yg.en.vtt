00:00:07.420 --> 00:00:10.940
Welcome to San Jacinto, or as you might hear us calling it, “San Jac.”

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:17.040
San Jacinto is located in the Waller Creek community on San Jacinto and 21st streets, down by the stadium. 

00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:20.300
More than 800 Longhorns call San Jacinto their home. 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:22.120
Let’s go look inside! 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:30.420
At the front entrance, there is a 24 hour help desk where you can check out movies or kitchen equipment, and the mailboxes are just around the corner. 

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:34.880
But, what you probably really want to see are the rooms, so let’s go take a look. 

00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.900
The rooms in San Jacinto are shared rooms; all with private bathrooms. 

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:43.620
You and your roommate have the bathroom all to yourselves, but you’ll have to clean and stock it yourselves too. 

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:44.120
 

00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.700
Make sure you bring those cleaning supplies when you move in. 

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:48.500
Every room has movable furniture. 

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:53.160
With a loftable bed, dresser, bookshelf, desk, and chair for each roommate.

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:55.860
Each room also has its own microfridge. 

00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:59.400
Plus, there’s a lockable drawer for each roommate to keep valuables in. 

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:04.440
San Jac is one of the newest residence halls on campus and it has a more modern feel. 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:10.320
And, since you can move all of the furniture around, you have the opportunity to make your room look totally unique. 

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:18.020
We also have a huge laundry room where you can use quarters, or just swipe your ID to use Bevo Bucks to clean and dry your clothes. 

00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:21.360
Down the street from San Jac, you’ll find the Rec Sports Center  

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:25.320
with a complete gym, racquetball courts, and a variety of other fitness facilities. 

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:30.560
Plus, Clark Field, a multipurpose sporting field and track, is just outside.

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:36.680
San Jacinto is in the shadow of Darrell K. Royal Texas Memorial Stadium. So it’s easy access for you football fans.

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:40.960
Some rooms in San Jac even have a view right into the stadium.

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:45.860
And of course, Jester Center and the Perry-Casteneda library are just up the street. 

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:50.440
If you’re looking for a place to hang out right here at home, San Jacinto has a lot to offer. 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:56.140
We’ve got everything from TV and game rooms, a formal piano lounge, which is always a great place to study,

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:01.200
as well as a large multipurpose room, that houses a variety of interesting events throughout the year. 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:07.940
Outside we have a beautiful Creekside sitting area with an outdoor amphitheater, which is a quiet place to go enjoy the outdoors. 

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:14.620
And if you think that’s a lot, just check out all the great places to eat around here that accept Dine in Dollars and Bevo Bucks. 

00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:17.880
On the first floor of San Jacitnto there is Cypress Bend Café

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:22.080
famous for its delicious homemade soups and made-to-order salads and sandwiches.

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:26.700
Cypress Bend also has a lot of convenience store items, so it’s really handy. 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.780
Jester Center is just a block away from San Jacinto,

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:38.240
so you’re not far from the other dining facilities like Jester City Limits or J2, an all-you-care-to-eat buffet that’s a great choice for lunch in between classes. 

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.640
Just check out the online menus to see what is available each day. 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.520
San Jacinto has so much going for it. 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:50.360
If you want convenient, comfortable college living with a modern feel, then San Jac is a great place for you. 

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:52.840
I’ll see you around soon, and Hook ‘em horns!
