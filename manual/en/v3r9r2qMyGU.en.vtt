00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.500
It's time for some hardcore!

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:07.300
Strength!

00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:10.500
Strength!

00:00:10.930 --> 00:00:13.100
C'mon baby!!

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:19.100
'You're too thin in my opinion...'

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:26.800
So hello you man... it's Krzychu Golonka and in short: I travel the world thanks to my ball!

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:35.500
In today's episode: John Guidetti and his hardcore Rainbow Flick

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:39.900
So you have to turn into real man, you have to be like Machete...

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:46.800
...in 'Machete', you have to be graceful and flexible like Michal...

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.900
...in the house, you have to be smart like Balotelli...

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:01.100
...on training and you have to be fast like Ryszard Kalisz...

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:16.500
...on the pitch, so get down to work!

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.500
At the beginning we stand behind the ball and touch it by our soles in turns.

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:38.500
We jump from leg to leg, landing on our toes. This trick is great as a freestyle warm-up.

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:48.300
Now increase the tempo. We do only three touches by our soles and put one leg on the ball, pushing it to the ground.

00:01:48.830 --> 00:01:54.500
We start doing second part of the trick by pulling the ball straight behind us and joining our legs fast.

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:58.500
Our task is to control a backward crossover.

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:00.500
We start without the ball

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:06.500
We join our feet and with our left leg (it's that second one, next to the right leg) we do the step behind.

00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:11.100
Now we do the same with the right leg but in different direction.

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:17.700
Put your legs as wide as it's possible. Thanks to that our ball will have a place to roll.

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:22.100
Notice the fact that I do these steps landing on my toes.

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:30.500
We add the ball – pulling it straight behind us, joining our legs together and doing a crossover, step by step.

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:39.500
When we overcome these steps, try to transform it into jumps. So we just jump from one leg to another, doing a crossover in the same time.

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:42.300
As always - without the ball first.

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:46.100
And with the ball.

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:51.800
To do Rainbow Flick correctly, we need a first stage of crossover.

00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:59.100
So we pull the ball and we do two jumps, but during the second we kick the ball by inside of the foot

00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:04.500
and catch it by the sole of our second leg.

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:09.500
The last part is to flick the ball, hit it by our heel and throw it over the opponent.

00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:14.800
We jump, changing the leg, and pull the ball on the leg that we stand.

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:20.500
It's important to raise our toes up and jump in the same time we pull the ball.

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:27.800
Remember to bend down – it will be easier to do the next part of this trick.

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:35.500
We finish our combination from John by hitting the ball with our heel or outside of the sole.

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:43.100
It's quite simple, we bend down and move forwards softly – then our ball will have a good speed and fly over us.

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:47.500
This trick is great to throw the ball over our opponent.

00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:55.500
That's all, I hope that you won't be frightened of this combination and you will use it on the pitch.

My official t-shirt that I performed in,  for you! Let me tell you how to win it

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:09.500
and to win it you have to do a few simple things. Firstly:

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:15.500
You have to enter my facebook page – facebook.com/GolonkaKrzysztof and do two things for me.

00:04:15.830 --> 00:04:21.900
Firstly you share my attached post with this episode with a content 'bla bla #TRENUJzKRZYCHEM'

00:04:22.230 --> 00:04:27.900
And secondly, you guess what's my juggling record in a comment.

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:31.500
A margin of mistake is 200, but I can tell you that is more than 2000.

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:36.500
Let's do it, from among all correct answers I will draw one that will get the t-shirt.

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:42.100
