00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:04.770
The question is how to use polished stones
and jewelry. So what I'm going to do right

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:08.360
now is I'm going to show you how to use the
most popular polished stone which is a diamond

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:14.009
and I'm going to show you how to set it in
a ring and what I'm holding here is a diamond

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:19.720
that a gentleman just bought and some lucky
lady is getting ready to get really surprised

00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:24.710
tomorrow. Let me show you how I set the diamond.
This is the engagement ring that the gentleman

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:31.020
has selected. So what I'm going to do is I'm
going to take a little device called a millimeter

00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:37.329
gage and I'm going to measure this diamond
and I see this diamond is 6.25 millimeters

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:45.079
which is one carat so I'm going to go in with
my box of stone setting burs and I'm going

00:00:45.079 --> 00:00:54.510
to fine that exact bur and there it is. Now
I've placed the ring in a wooden ring clamp.

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:02.429
I've but my stone setting bur into my little
dremel tool called a plack shaft and now I'm

00:01:02.429 --> 00:01:15.360
going to start cutting a seat for my diamond
to set in. I've marked my depth with a black

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:26.500
line and I want the tops of my prongs at that
black line. Now I'm going to take a specialized

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:31.310
pair of pliers called stone setting pliers
and watch how I'm going to bend this prong

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:37.340
over that stone, see it move just a little
bit. I'm going to turn it around and I'm going

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:44.110
to go to the opposite prong and I'm going
to do the same thing. Now I'm going to do

00:01:44.110 --> 00:02:07.170
that four more times because this is a six
stone, or a six prong setting.

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:14.280
Now I've got all six prongs pushed over just
a little bit and then I've manipulated it

00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:36.650
and straightened everything up and I'm checking
to see that my diamond is level and it is.

00:02:36.650 --> 00:02:43.959
Now that all the prongs have been filed and
rounded I'm going to do one last step. I'm

00:02:43.959 --> 00:02:53.940
going to take my pliers and push those prongs
right over that diamond and they're going

00:02:53.940 --> 00:03:09.209
to grab it very tight and that diamond is
not going anywhere. That is the most common

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:14.930
way and the most popular way to use polished
stones in jewelry. I bet she says yes.
