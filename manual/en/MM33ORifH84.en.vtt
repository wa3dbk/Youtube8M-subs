00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.740
&gt;&gt; My name is Brian Griffin, I went to school
at Iowa State University, and I work at NASA

00:00:24.759 --> 00:00:28.879
Armstrong as an operations engineer. 

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:33.760
Moving out to the desert from Iowa was a huge shock,

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:39.809
in terms of geographic location and the environment.
And seven years later I'm still trying to

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:46.800
get used to brown as opposed to green. But
at the same time I just remind myself where

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:49.300
I get to go work every day. 

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:51.020

[Music]

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:57.660
&gt;&gt;At Armstrong, our purpose is to fly airplanes for flight research

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:02.160
and collect data. The operations engineer
is responsible for helping to coordinate all

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.970
the efforts required to both integrate the
research experiment and then flight test that

00:01:06.970 --> 00:01:10.590
research experiment to fulfill that mission.

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.660
&gt;&gt;We interface on a daily basis with the chief

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:25.610
engineers, the project managers, the ground
crew, even our center management In order

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:30.380
to integrate whatever that particular research
mission is onto the airframe, do it safely,

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:34.560
and then fly it safely, and collect the data
required.

[Oxygen mask breathing]

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.340
&gt;&gt;We'll collect all types of data-

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:54.810
pressure data, air data from the aircraft,
visible and infrared images of flight test

00:01:54.810 --> 00:02:00.380
fixtures that are underneath the aircraft
in support of analyzing supersonic airflow

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.580
over these fixtures.

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:09.280
[Fighter jet flyover]

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.300
&gt;&gt;The project I'm currently
working on, the F-15 high speed aircraft, the

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:19.150
research that it's supporting is hopefully
at one point and time going to allow supersonic

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:25.030
flight commercially over the U.S. and throughout
the world, and I think the ability to have

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:30.830
at least some type of impact in that is a
very rewarding experience. 

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:32.460
[Music]

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:33.460
&gt;&gt;A typical flight

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:38.260
test mission starts much earlier than the
day of the mission. For example, all the coordination

00:02:38.269 --> 00:02:43.310
and scheduling required to get the airspaces,
and the aircraft in our system, so everyone's

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:47.400
on the same page and aware that the flight
test is going to be performed.

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:51.250
&gt;&gt;Good morning, the is the crew brief for
SBLT-2 flight #2.

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:56.620
&gt;&gt;On the flight day we typically have crew
briefs, where we brief what the mission is

00:02:56.620 --> 00:03:01.340
for that day, we discuss the flight cards,
what the flight cards and the test points

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:03.799
are going to be on that mission.

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:08.959
&gt;&gt;The objectives are to determine the stability
of the boundary layer and the extent of laminar

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:14.340
flow for the test article surface. This chart
here shows that flight envelope that we have

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:19.209
cleared for this series of flights. Failure
of any of our safety of flight parameters

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:21.949
is an immediate cancellation and RTB.

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:24.000
&gt;&gt;All right- we'll see you out there in a little bit.

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.299
&gt;&gt;After the brief, we'll staff the control
room, get the control room screens all up

00:03:28.299 --> 00:03:32.079
and running. We'll do day of flight checks
on the ground, which is ensuring that the

00:03:32.079 --> 00:03:36.239
aircraft is ready to go before we take off.
And then the flight mission itself, we'll

00:03:36.239 --> 00:03:39.919
take off, perform the flight cards as briefed.

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:41.580

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:42.480
&gt;&gt;Go ahead.

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:47.040
&gt;&gt;Yeah, we're ready for card 5, the wing rock,
and turning the camera to standby when able.

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:48.460
&gt;&gt;There's your wing rock.

00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:57.699
&gt;&gt;My role in the control room as ops engineer
on the F-15 project is to serve as the mission

00:03:57.699 --> 00:04:03.470
controller, so we are the interface between
the control room personnel and the pilot flying

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:04.670
the airplane.

[Radio chatter]

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:09.820
&gt;&gt;A typical communication that
goes back and forth between the controller

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:15.959
and the pilot is just verifying what flight
card we're on, what test point we're on, what

00:04:15.959 --> 00:04:21.540
the next maneuver might be, if there's information
that the principal investigators are looking

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:25.220
for, or any information from anyone else in
the control room that needs to be relayed

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:29.479
to the pilot, we'll be letting them know about
that. We'll let the pilot know about how

00:04:29.479 --> 00:04:33.860
much fuel he still has on board, airspace
checks, if he's getting close to boundaries

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:38.439
and he needs to make turns. Just any information
that can increase the situational awareness

00:04:38.439 --> 00:04:44.639
for the pilot, and also help the pilot perform
the mission, complete the test cards, and

00:04:44.639 --> 00:04:46.159
then come back and land.

00:04:46.159 --> 00:04:47.860
&gt;&gt;Mission Controller, this is Flight on Data 1,

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:50.480
we're ready for the supersonic run.

00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:53.980
&gt;&gt;Copy. NASA 836, NASA 1 is ready for the

00:04:53.990 --> 00:04:57.240
run, and I have you right now at 48.5 for reference.

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:01.000
1.83...4...

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.960
...5...hold!

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:06.680
&gt;&gt;There is a lot of pressure associated with
being the mission controller, the only person

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:11.750
talking to the pilot. That pressure seems
to decrease with experience, the more flights

00:05:11.750 --> 00:05:13.170
you perform.

00:05:13.170 --> 00:05:16.940

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:30.020
&gt;&gt;Being the guy on the ground, talking to
the pilot, and doing that communication with

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:34.150
the rest of the control room is a rewarding
experience, when you come back and capture

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:37.909
the data that you wanted to capture and everyone
is happy with the flight. You're going to

00:05:37.909 --> 00:05:41.650
have a lot of success, but sometimes you're
going to have failures, and the important

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:46.830
aspect is to not just learn from this success,
but also learn from the failures.

00:05:56.199 --> 00:06:03.759
duties is also a rewarding experience in itself.
Let alone you'd be able to just fly in a fighter jet.

00:06:16.889 --> 00:06:20.649

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:32.300
&gt;&gt;Flying past Mach 1 is definitely

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:38.270
an excitement, but you don't necessarily feel
that you're going past Mach 1, until you start

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:43.060
to slow back down. When you slow back down
you can definitely feel the deceleration,

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:45.860
it's very pronounced.

00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:56.100
&gt;&gt;Getting used to the
motion sickness is definitely always a challenge,

00:06:56.110 --> 00:07:03.110
but I think the benefits of being able to
fly outweigh those challenges.

Every day in OE is typically different than the day before, and the day upcoming.

00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:18.380
As an Ops Engineer, the overall picture is to ensure the mission success, 

00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:21.080
while also ensuring that the integrity

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:27.139
of the air frame is safe, and the airplane
itself is air worthy. The chance to come to

00:07:27.139 --> 00:07:31.909
work every day and work on these things, and
be involved in this flight research, to help

00:07:31.909 --> 00:07:38.389
put those pieces together to fulfill the mission
is a very valuable experience.
