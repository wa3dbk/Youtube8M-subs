00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:01.170
Hello everybody.

00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:04.980
Today I want to talk about dreams and aspirations.

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:12.250
Now some of you may have dreams and aspirations,
I have dreams and aspirations.

00:00:12.250 --> 00:00:15.690
Things that I wish to accomplish; there are
a couple of them.

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:21.430
Number one,
I want to get under 250 pounds by the end

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:23.790
of the year.

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:28.789
That's an achievable goal that is basically
50 pounds in 5 months.

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:31.750
Very doable
I just have to stay focused

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:37.670
I just have to keep exercising
and the weight will come off

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:39.920
so that is something that I can accomplish.

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:47.109
The other thing that I am going to accomplish
and I am going to keep trying until I accomplish

00:00:47.109 --> 00:00:50.859
this goal
is I want to get back into truck driving.

00:00:50.859 --> 00:00:58.529
You know, I tried earlier, didn't make it
I came real close.

00:00:58.529 --> 00:01:05.280
Some of you guys know what happened
Those of you guys who are new, well I am not

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.759
going to get into it because, I am just not
going to get into it.

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:17.921
Needless to say, I am going to continue to
work to get into truck driving because it

00:01:17.921 --> 00:01:19.640
is something that I want.

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:26.340
It is something I know that I can do, simply
because I have done it for years.

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:28.990
I did it for over three years.

00:01:28.990 --> 00:01:34.610
It is something that I can do, it is something
that I can do well, and I am going to get

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:36.909
back into it.

00:01:36.909 --> 00:01:42.509
But anyway,
I guess the point that I am trying to say

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:52.289
is, don't give up on your goals, because I
am not going to give up on mine.

00:01:52.289 --> 00:02:02.219
Because the moment that we stop trying to
accomplish a goal, that is the moment we stop

00:02:02.219 --> 00:02:04.450
living.

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:09.440
Anyway I want to thank you guys for watching
and I will see you guys in the next one.
