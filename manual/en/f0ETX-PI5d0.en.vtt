00:00:00.333 --> 00:00:04.033
Ben Rhodes:
The President will be going
to Mexico and Costa Rica on

00:00:04.033 --> 00:00:06.467
the first trip to Latin
America of his second term.

00:00:06.467 --> 00:00:09.066
And it's an important chance to
show how important Latin America

00:00:09.066 --> 00:00:11.667
is to our foreign policy
and to our economy.

00:00:11.667 --> 00:00:13.934
In Mexico, he'll be meeting
with the new president there,

00:00:13.934 --> 00:00:16.867
President Pena Nieto, and we'll
have a chance to increase,

00:00:16.867 --> 00:00:18.967
not just our security
cooperation and our efforts

00:00:18.967 --> 00:00:22.066
to combat drug trafficking,
but to broaden our cooperation,

00:00:22.066 --> 00:00:23.967
to take advantage of the
extraordinary economic growth

00:00:23.967 --> 00:00:26.433
that we've seen in Mexico in
recent years and to expand our

00:00:26.433 --> 00:00:27.867
people to people ties.

00:00:27.867 --> 00:00:30.100
The President will be speaking
not just to the President,

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:32.100
but also to the Mexican
University students.

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:35.066
And he'll be doing so at a time
when we're pursuing encumbrance

00:00:35.066 --> 00:00:37.667
of immigration reform
here in the United States,

00:00:37.667 --> 00:00:40.166
which ultimately will demand
the cooperation of Mexico in

00:00:40.166 --> 00:00:41.367
securing our border.

00:00:41.367 --> 00:00:44.200
But also as Mexico continues
to grow its economy,

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:47.233
that will reduce the source of
illegal immigration as there are

00:00:47.233 --> 00:00:50.233
more opportunities for Mexicans,
just as there are opportunities

00:00:50.233 --> 00:00:53.266
for the people in the United
States to continue to contribute

00:00:53.266 --> 00:00:55.400
the extraordinary immigrant
communities that come from

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.200
Mexico as immigration
reform moves forward.

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.533
In Costa Rica, the President
will be meeting not just with

00:01:00.533 --> 00:01:02.700
the President of Costa Rica,
but with heads of state from

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:04.200
across Central America.

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:07.567
So that includes Belize,
Guatemala, Honduras,

00:01:07.567 --> 00:01:12.233
El Salvador, the Dominican
Republic, Panama, and Nicaragua.

00:01:12.233 --> 00:01:14.133
And there he will be able to
talk about what we're doing

00:01:14.133 --> 00:01:16.533
together to combat the
extraordinary violence that's

00:01:16.533 --> 00:01:19.467
ravaged Central America in
recent years through greater

00:01:19.467 --> 00:01:21.300
cooperation and resources
from the United States,

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:23.066
but also sharing of
best practices from

00:01:23.066 --> 00:01:24.066
within Central America.

00:01:24.066 --> 00:01:27.200
And he'll talk about how we can
increase economic cooperation in

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:29.500
the region more generally,
so that again we see the

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.734
development that can
automatically crack down

00:01:31.734 --> 00:01:34.500
on the sources of violence
in this part of the world.

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:35.500
There are two.

00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:38.200
Immigration is an important
issue as so many Americans

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.467
can trace their heritage
back to Central America.

00:01:40.467 --> 00:01:42.467
So again, as we pursue
encumbrance of immigration

00:01:42.467 --> 00:01:44.867
reform it's important to have a
dialogue with these countries as

00:01:44.867 --> 00:01:47.867
well about how we can cooperate
in ensuring that there are paths

00:01:47.867 --> 00:01:50.567
to legal immigration, but we're
also combating the sources of

00:01:50.567 --> 00:01:52.467
legal immigration
at the same time.

00:01:52.467 --> 00:01:55.100
So this is an important chance
for the President to speak to

00:01:55.100 --> 00:01:57.900
important security and economic
partners for the United States.

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:02.066
At the same time, to speak to
the huge ties that span the

00:02:02.066 --> 00:02:06.100
border, ties of family, ties of
culture, and ties of commerce.

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.600
So we're looking forward to a
chance to get down to Mexico.

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:10.400
We're looking forward
to going to Costa Rica.

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:12.800
Unfortunately, we won't be
there for Cinco de Mayo,

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.967
but we'll be back here in the
United States to celebrate with

00:02:14.967 --> 00:02:17.900
so many Hispanic Americans
who look forward to May 5th.
