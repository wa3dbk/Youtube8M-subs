00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:25.650
Well obviously, nothing else
compares to Lincoln Center.

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.810 position:97%
 


00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:31.280
It's a little nerve wracking
though once you get out there

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:32.830
and you start playing
the music that you

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:33.870
feel so comfortable with.


00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:35.860
It feels really good.


00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:38.010
I'm playing with my new
students that I came in

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:41.330
with as freshmen, and to
perform at Lincoln Center

00:00:41.330 --> 00:00:43.690
is a culmination of all the
work we've done together.

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:47.390
It's a really great honor
and a big deal to me.

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:48.970
Some of the world's
best orchestras

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:52.460
play in Lincoln Center, and to
be able to play where they play

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:54.240
is an incredible opportunity.


00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:56.980 position:97%
 


00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:00.120
When I was a student myself
and I came to play in New York,

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.440
I was always at
the top of my game.

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:06.270 position:97%
 


00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.190
Each one of those
performances pushed my level

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:08.940
up another notch.


00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:12.750
So to watch these students have
this similar kind of experience

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:15.210
is very exciting.


00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:18.960
Dr. Meyer holds us to
extremely high standards.

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.460
It really creates that sense
of a professional orchestra.

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:25.060
It is a challenging
time to be a musician,

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:27.170
but there are people
who believe in being

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:29.000
a musician to the point
where they literally

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.190
devote their lives to it.


00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:33.540
The devotion of both
practice and performance

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:35.590
in this orchestra
is really palpable.

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:37.710
I can see their performance
level just go like this

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:39.380
and like this.


00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:40.930
I love that.


00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:42.410
We love that.


00:01:42.410 --> 00:01:52.270 position:97%
 


00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:54.430
Playing in Alice
Tully for a musician

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:56.930
is a little bit like being
a college baseball player.

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:59.740
All of a sudden, you get
dropped in the Yankee Stadium.

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.880
For me, this was always an
incredibly exciting experience

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.510
just to come into this
city to see the skyline.

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:08.850
Ithaca is a wonderful place to
live, but to hit the big city

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:11.410
is always something
quite exciting.

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:16.450
You can feel the demand in
presence and personal power

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:18.430
that is necessary to
reach that audience.

00:02:18.430 --> 00:02:20.310
And so that's the
experience that we

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:21.840
hope to give to our students.


00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:23.630
We got dropped off on the
bus outside Lincoln Center,

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:25.720
and we see, I think, a
college symphony orchestra

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:28.090
in the lights going across
the steps of Lincoln Center.

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:29.680
It was really cool.


00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:32.440
It's really great that the
college gives us an opportunity

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:38.580
to play in spaces such as this
and to have these experiences.

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:41.150
Well, we're performing
three pieces tomorrow,

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:43.150
the first is the
Poulenc, "Gloria,"

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:44.720
which is with the choir.


00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:47.350
There's a lot of excitement and
nervous energy from the choir.

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:50.190
There will be at least 700
people at Lincoln Center.

00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:52.610
The fact that we are able to
share what we've been working

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:55.250
so hard on for so long will
be an amazing experience.

00:02:55.250 --> 00:03:00.190 position:97%
 


00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:03.200
The second piece we're playing
is "Atmospheres" by Ligeti,

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.840
and this is a really
iconic piece, definitely

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.010
something I had never heard
before I got to college.

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.500
It is so different and
somewhat out there.

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.570
One thing that's been
really great about Ithaca

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:17.890
is that I've grown to appreciate
pieces that aren't really

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:20.420
played all that much or
aren't heard that much.

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:22.960
And the last piece we're playing
is the "Lutoslawski Concerto

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:26.440
for Orchestra," which is one of
the most exciting pieces I've

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:27.480
ever played in my life.


00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:29.960
The performance tonight
will be for many students,

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:32.220
the memorable moment of their
study of Ithaca College.

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:35.880
It will be something that
catalyzes and energizes them

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:39.760
as they go out into the world
and carry a practice, music,

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:42.940
that carries all of humanity.
