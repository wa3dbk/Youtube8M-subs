00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:34.290
hye-won it's Chloe and today I'm going
to be doing a 1/2 my pencil case video

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:39.860
I'm really excited about this video
because I absolutely love stationary and

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:46.830
back-to-school time is actually a great
time to have an excuse to bus so that

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:53.220
further ado let's get started okay so
first I'm going to show you my pencil

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:57.570
cases that I have to I have to be tiny
one for almost stationary and one for

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:02.460
coloring in stuff there were three
Midori and like you so the first one is

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:07.680
just this nice silver glittery one this
is from pavement bit by the brand

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:14.759
pebbles or so sell it payment and it's
so cute it's just that and the next one

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:19.259
is this gold one which is also from
payments for the firebrand and

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:23.640
this is adorable tjust like I
love this one if it's also pink on the

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:29.640
inside and I love pink and it's just
really nice and look around okay

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:35.039
so first I have got this stuff it all of
this is from office works I really like

00:01:35.039 --> 00:01:40.709
this because it rules do not fit in your
pencil cases if you have small ones like

00:01:40.709 --> 00:01:45.420
many and they don't fit in so I love
this nothing more for it next I have

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:51.209
this electric eraser it's just so cool
this is from sneakers absolutely love it

00:01:51.209 --> 00:01:55.739
and this is soaked away sometimes people
think I'm crazy because they're if they

00:01:55.739 --> 00:02:01.789
can just see this noise and they don't
realize what it is

00:02:01.789 --> 00:02:06.490
okay
automatic so next I have this in

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:11.050
they cool off and I'm sorry if there's a
bit of a pink thing happening

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:15.610
this was meant to happen but it just
happened but it's really nice just six

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:25.600
