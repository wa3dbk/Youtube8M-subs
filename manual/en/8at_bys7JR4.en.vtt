00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:24.039
Herb?

00:00:24.039 --> 00:00:27.239
Did you hear the question?

00:00:27.239 --> 00:00:28.380
Yeah.

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:37.560
So what are you planning to do if the DNA
test confirm that Chancie here is your son?

00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:39.079
Uuuuuuh...

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:40.470
It's a pretty simple question...

00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:42.170
DAD.

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:48.190
What do you want to do?

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:49.260
What can I do?

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:50.320
I'll keep him.

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:51.320
I guess.

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:52.320
Hey!

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:53.559
Don't do me any favors.

00:00:53.559 --> 00:00:55.610
I got a good set up where I am.

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:58.229
I'm at boarding school and doing just fine.

00:00:58.229 --> 00:00:59.229
What?

00:00:59.229 --> 00:01:02.589
The kids there don't beat you up?

00:01:02.589 --> 00:01:04.030
I'm confused.

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:06.930
What is he even doing here if you're not sure
yet...?

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.570
The lawyer, who serves as his legal guardian,
thought it would be a good idea for us to

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:12.820
get to know each other.

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:16.320
Cuz Rachel kinda already told him that I was...

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.320
You know.

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:18.320
Wait a minute!

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:25.149
A LAWYER knew you were the biological father
and DIDN'T come after you for child support?!

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:26.580
Rachel wouldn't LET him.

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:30.140
Because she didn't want me to know about...

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:33.229
Anyway, the DNA are just a confirmation.

00:01:33.229 --> 00:01:35.960
You don't have to sound so depressed about
it.

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:37.290
I'm not, it's just....

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:45.160
Look this hasn't exactly been a picnic in
the park for me either.

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:49.830
I just spent the last year with the step-son
from HELL then I finally get a chance to see

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:50.979
my REAL sons...

00:01:50.979 --> 00:01:52.090
And now they're GONE!

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:54.409
Because of ME, your NOT real son!

00:01:54.409 --> 00:01:57.240
That's not what I'm saying.

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.240
Look, I know you're mine.

00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:59.729
And just how do you know that?

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:02.080
I feel it in my gut.

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:04.860
Pity that's not the same as feeling it in
your heart.

00:02:04.860 --> 00:02:07.600
Oh, get out the violins!

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:08.830
I just met you.

00:02:08.830 --> 00:02:09.830
What do you expect?

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:10.830
Instant love?

00:02:10.830 --> 00:02:13.810
No, but I'd like to think that I at least
had a chance at love.

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:18.599
A chance at having a real father in my life.

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:21.010
Really...?

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:25.580
Do you want to know, why, I think, your Mom
NAMED you Chance.

00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:27.000
Herb, stop.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:29.840
NO, Herb, Go on!

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:32.459
You knew my Mom for a whopping 48 hours.

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:36.670
I'd love to hear your insights on her thought
processes.

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:44.159
Okay, the night we were together.

00:02:44.159 --> 00:02:49.340
We talked about my family and I asked her
when she was gonna settle down and start a

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:51.829
family of her own.

00:02:51.829 --> 00:02:53.680
And you know what she said?

00:02:53.680 --> 00:03:00.230
You mean after she said: "This is the most
disappointing SEX I've every HAD?"

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:04.590
She said: Fat chance I'll ever get stuck with
a kid.

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:08.189
Fat chance I'll ever be a MOTHER!

00:03:08.189 --> 00:03:12.069
Oh, my God.

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:13.540
What?

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:19.599
The name my birth certificate is F. Chance
Dinoffsky.

00:03:19.599 --> 00:03:24.769
My Mom always said it was she liked F. Scott
Fitzgerald, but she never told me what the

00:03:24.769 --> 00:03:27.900
"F" really stood for.

00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:30.969
I guess I know NOW, huh?!

00:03:30.969 --> 00:03:33.260
Chancie, I'm sorry.

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.499
I should've gone there.

00:03:35.499 --> 00:03:36.950
It's just that I'm upset about...

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:37.950
What?!

00:03:37.950 --> 00:03:38.950
Your REALSONS?!

00:03:38.950 --> 00:03:39.950
Chancie, please...

00:03:39.950 --> 00:03:41.859
You know, you're right Herb.

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:44.019
Why should you care about me?

00:03:44.019 --> 00:03:46.659
We're just a couple of strangers.

00:03:46.659 --> 00:03:47.659
And maybe...

00:03:47.659 --> 00:03:49.680
Maybe what, Chancie?

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:54.219
Maybe it should STAY that way.

00:03:54.219 --> 00:03:59.449
Chancie, c'mon, I never meant to make you
feel...

00:03:59.449 --> 00:04:01.639
Hold on I'm vibrating.

00:04:01.639 --> 00:04:04.459
It's the lawyer, probably about the DNA tests.

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:16.720
Why don't you take it in my outer office,
Herb.

00:04:16.720 --> 00:04:36.580
It'll give Chancie and I a moment to talk.

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:38.790
Sure.

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:43.900
Chancie, honey, what do you want to do?

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:44.900
Punt.

00:04:44.900 --> 00:04:48.810
I don't know Dr. Spiegel, if Herb is my real
Dad, I want to at least TRY.

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:54.770
Honey, given Herb's state of mind right now,
I'm real sure that's a good idea.

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:56.060
But I HAVE to.

00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:58.410
It's what my Mom would've wanted.

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:01.160
How do you know that?

00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:02.960
Cuz if she hadn't, she wouldn't have left
me the letter.

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:09.590
Besides from the little I know about Herb,
he's the kind of person who complains about

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:10.760
NOT being left alone.

00:05:10.760 --> 00:05:13.600
But he doesn't WANT to be alone.

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:14.600
You...

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:16.920
Are a very smart boy.

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:19.840
And probably better than Herb deserves.

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:20.840
OKAY!

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:22.240
It's official.

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:23.830
You're mine.

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:26.229
Not yet, Herb.

00:05:26.229 --> 00:05:27.250
You're still on probation.

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:28.510
Atta boy.
