00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:08.100
This video shows you how to create barcode 
 labels using Microsoft Word and TBarCode Office.

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:13.800
Install TBarCode Office, a free demo version is available on TEC-IT's website.

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:17.450
Change to the tab 'mailings'. 

00:00:17.883 --> 00:00:21.483
Choose the appropriate label template under 'start mail merge'.

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:26.700
To include your own data click 'select recipients' and 'use existing list'.

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:32.150
Choose your excel file from the list and import the data.

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:36.700
Design the first label as a template according to your needs.

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:39.250
Now let's insert a logo!

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:44.900
Change to the tab 'insert', then click 'picture' and choose your graphic file.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.100
Under the tab 'home' you will find the settings to position the graphic. 

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:00.050
You have to activate the TBarCode Panel under 
 the tab 'add-ins' to insert a barcode.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.300
Now choose the required barcode type.

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:11.350
In order to link the barcode data to the imported data, click 
 'insert field' and choose the proper data field from the list.

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:17.150
Adjust the barcode size and insert the barcode into the label template.

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:22.650
Additional dynamic text fields can be created under the tab 'mailings'.

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:26.600
Click 'Insert Merge Field' to add a data field like the product name.

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:30.600
Let's finish the label template and create a frame!

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:35.650
That's all! The label is ready. 

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.050
In order to create a whole sheet with labels 
 click on the button 'update labels'. 

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:42.500
Finally you have to merge the data.

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.650
Do this by clicking 'finish and merge' and then 'print'.

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:55.300
The result created in this video is printed into a pdf file.

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:59.500
