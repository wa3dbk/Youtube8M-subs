00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
hello welcome the tutorial today's is artistic chocolate.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:29.000
We use chocolate chips of different colors
also we are going to deal with plastic sticks, wooden sticks
and a plate of chocolate plastic.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:38.000
 We have to empty our sparks of chocolate in aluminium containers and are going to keep in hot water.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:50.000
also we will need a small plastic spoon
and a wooden stick that we occupy to paint our plate.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:01:02.000
We will start to paint our plate already well dry here without anything of moisture and no oil.

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:15.000
We will always start by details more small I will start
with this stick the only thing we are going to do is to place the color.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:23.000
in a way that we are going to go painting our drawing.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:34.000
so that by the time we finish paint our drawing  here we have it.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:54.000
and finished our plate to see nothing more than we are painting all the more small the only thing we do is destribuir chocolate.

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000
and we are going to put in the refrigerator for five minutes.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:10.000
so we remain very thin our plate.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:20.000
came out our plate of the refrigerator here I have, here I have others following to see as they are.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.000

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:47.000
Here I have the roses that are lists to fill already are completely dry I'm going apreparar fill my palette.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:03:03.000
But first I'm going to put a stick transparent, pair that mix that I add tape me my stick and I can hold my palette.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:11.000
and the only thing that we do is distribute the chocolate with a small spoon, since I have it well distributed.

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:30.000
the only thing I'll do is hit my palette so that in some places our chocolate fits well, leave it to cool for five minutes and it will do with my roses.
