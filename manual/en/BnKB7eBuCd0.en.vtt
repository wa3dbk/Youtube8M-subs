Hello, I'm Matt Cail and on behalf of Expert
Village, I'm going to show you easy ways to

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:10.240
draw turkey cartoons for this holiday season.
Now comes the fun part. We get to move on

00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:15.099
to coloring and to get ready for coloring,
make sure and break out all of your colored

00:00:15.099 --> 00:00:18.750
pencils. Specifically, you are going to need
a lot of different colors to do a turkey right.

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:23.090
Just off the top of my head, you are going
to need black, you are going to need blue,

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:28.210
sort of a reddish pink, tan, dark brown, light
brown, and you are going to have some white

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:31.189
colors, but you shouldn't have to worry about
drawing that in. A really good thing again

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:35.040
is going back to a point of reference; not
even necessarily a photograph. You can see

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.570
from this little guy here that turkeys have
a lot of colors. They are not just a basic

00:00:38.570 --> 00:00:42.480
gray brown duck or goose. So, you definitely
want to keep that in mind. It's going to make

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.440
your turkey a lot more realistic to add those
colors. So let's start of on the head area

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:53.040
for our coloring exercise. I usually like
to start out using black, and this is not

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:57.690
going to be an exception. Taking the black
colored pencil, we are going to go around

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:02.720
and outline in the eyes. Turkeys actually
have black eyes. That's a little point I break

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:09.240
with when cartoonizing a turkey. Big, big
black or even small beady black eyes don't

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.679
work very well for cartoon characters. But
you can certainly outline it in black and

00:01:13.679 --> 00:01:20.310
you can have black pupils. Next, we are going
to be putting in some nice light blue around

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:26.890
the immediate eye area. Again, applying it
in nice light strokes; it doesn't have to

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:35.049
be super dark. After that, we are going to
break out some red; time to color in the snood.

00:01:35.049 --> 00:01:41.799
I love saying the word "snood." We are going
to basically color all of that in the red.

00:01:41.799 --> 00:01:46.090
In here, you know, you want to make sure...this
is pretty brilliant. If your pencil starts

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:50.799
breaking in your hands, you are pressing too
hard. But make sure you have a solid red color

00:01:50.799 --> 00:01:56.499
here. It's one of the more garish, fun colors
of a turkey. Then, taking a tan color, we

00:01:56.499 --> 00:02:02.450
are going to draw in the beak. Sometimes,
the beak is even more understated than tan.

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:07.770
Don't use bright yellow if you have any other
options. I find the tan is a lot more of a

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:09.410
subtle and more fun effect.
