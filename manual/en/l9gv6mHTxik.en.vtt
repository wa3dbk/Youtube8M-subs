00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000
By Simon Pham.

00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Premier Cherdenko recruits the new Commander and assigns him to defend Leningrad against the invading Empire of the Rising Sun.

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.400
Ah, Commander!

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:17.400
As you can see, our situation is shockingly grim.

00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:22.700
All our division are concentrated in Europe, pushing the Allies west.

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:28.400
This "Empire" knows very well that we're vulnerable right now.

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.500
They will be expecting us to fall swiftly.

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:39.000
At this very moment, their invasion force moves relentlessly towards Leningrad.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.500
I have chosen you to defend the U.S.S.R in this difficult hour.

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:49.800
Because I need a commander who not believe in defeat!

00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:57.000
Someone who will not simple drive our enemies back, but ultimately annihilate them.

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:02.900
And show them no mercy!

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:11.000
General Krukov! Would you like to meet our new commander?

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.000
New commander?

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
Yes! We're sending him to protect Leningrad.

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:21.400
Even though I told you it was foolhardy to try and defend that city?

00:01:21.500 --> 00:01:26.500
If Leningrad falls, the Soviet people will begin to lose hope.

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:30.900
Yes, well. I wish him luck then!

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.000
The Empire's technology is highly advanced and he will likely be vastly out-numbered.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.300
But of course, it is an honor to sacrifice one's life for the motherland, is it not?

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:42.100
Indeed.

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:46.100
Now if you'll excuse me, I have a nation to defend.

00:01:46.300 --> 00:01:52.300
Comrade Dasha will be your information officer and will coordinate all our communication.

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:58.800
Thank you, your excellency. Commander, the armies of the Empire are losing in as we speak.

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000
Make haste, commander.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Time is of the essence!

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.500
We know little about the Empire's invasion force other than that they are extremely mobile.

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:18.100
They have surrounded Leningrad and are assaulting the city by way of the canals.

00:02:18.100 --> 00:02:22.100
Save our great metropolis; it is a symbol of the People's Revolution.

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:25.500
We've assigned the legendary sniper Natasha to your command.

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.500
She will help you to help defend the city and eradicate the invading Imperial soldiers.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000
Dasvedanya.
