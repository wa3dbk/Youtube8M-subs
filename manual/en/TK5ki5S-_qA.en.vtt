00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.540
Alright, on this new website "Readers.net"

00:00:02.540 --> 00:00:06.540
a bunch of people were asking me, like, questions, trying to get up in my personal business.

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:08.940
And, you know, I was gonna blow them all off,

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:11.260
'cause that's really- that's my life, you know, that's my personal life,

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:13.160
you guys don't have any business about that.

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:16.780
But, then they said that they actually had my son hostage.

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.260
So now I gotta do 'em.

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:21.280
But I'm gonna give you two answers to each question

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:24.280
and only one of them is sorta truthful, so, starting off here:

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:24.900
Question 1:

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.300
Oh, definitely my- definitely my "Glover" video.

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:33.000
I mean, every time I sit down and play that game I say in my head

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:34.480
"It's Glover"

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.800
And I- and I know I'm gonna have a blast just playing it.

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:39.280
The Glover Universe as a whole is so immersive.

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.380
Just commentating on its innovation,

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:42.660
the breathtaking atmosphere,

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:43.520
the ball physics

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:46.100
Just an all-round- just an all-round great game.

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:48.600
Just kidding, "Glover" sucks my glove dick.

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.820
Really the best one was my second "Guide to Girls" video

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:55.600
which I think was clever enough to come across as kinda, like, tongue-in-cheek

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:56.780
and funny.

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:59.120
But actually it was just a brutally honest,

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:02.940
just straight forward beatdown of all the stupid ass girls I met on "League".

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:07.080
Playing video game- I mean, uhm...

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.120
I attend Marquette University,

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:13.660
I'm in my third year of pursuing a degree in Business Economics and Administration.

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:19.200
I volunteer coach a children's baseball team in the ghetto to pay off a gambling debt

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:20.280
Starring Keanu Reeves.

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:23.560
Sometimes I'll actually go out into the outside world

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:26.220
to get food and then bring it back to my apartment.

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.360
I also get laid once a week.

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.780
Yeah, I actually met her at Marquette, uh, she's very charming.

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.580
I would describe her as a intellectual, you know, she's studying to be a doctor.

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.580
She always makes me watch these Art movies as, like, all this talking and stillness,

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:43.740
I couldn't even tell who the bad guy was because there's not any shooting.

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:47.980
But the whole thing went way above my head, but, she gets it, you know, she's really clever and witty.

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:52.380
She'll be watching one of my videos, while I'm editing it up and make a little comment on it.

00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:57.020
And then I just work what she said into the video and then it ends up being the best line in the whole thing.

00:01:57.360 --> 00:01:59.240
And most importantly, she has big ass tits.

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:00.420
*laughs*

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:01.440
Come on,

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:02.180
a guy like me,

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:02.840
girlfriend?

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:04.160
Don't be so fuck.

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:07.380
*laughs*

00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:09.720
Like five seconds, it's just putting clips together and saying

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.860
"Not Even Close", "Nice try guy", just stupid ass shit and people eat it up, you know, idiots.

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.860
I mean, uh

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.780
Sometimes it takes, like, days of work to make a little one or two minute video, you know,

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.280
I gotta play, like, 50 matches to get enough clips.

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:27.260
I have to write down this big giant script, you know, I have to

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:30.220
you know, I really have to get lucky, I'm not that good at "League".

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:33.980
I mean, uh, I'm- actually, it's- it's all live actually, you know,

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:38.860
I usually get all my clips in one match in ranked, because I'm the best player of all time.

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:43.860
I'm- I'm just the funniest, best video game guy- I'm just the best person in the whole world.

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:48.720
Well, a lot of my champions are inspired by other existing characters.

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.740
Like, when I designed "Mundo", I was just watching "Incredible Hulk" and I was like

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:53.120
"What if...

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:53.720
purple?"

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:59.040
Then I just draw up some concept art, make it to 3D model, balance his moveset into the game...

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.340
No, but actually Pheak's in charge of that.

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:09.800
Well, before I started studying at Marquette, I actually was an apprentice to acclaimed composer:

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:10.740
Hans Zimmer

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.460
I would do editing and sound mixing work for Mr. Zimmer; just the monotonous underling work, you know,

00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:19.920
but he taught me all about making music, which is how I actually make all the songs in my videos.

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:22.680
Never, never once.

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:24.640
Everybody knows smoking is bad for you.

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:27.400
And on top of that I don't really know anyone

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:29.260
I couldn't get it if I wanted it, so...

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:30.960
which is why I inject heroin.

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:33.240
Wait a minute, I don't have a son.
