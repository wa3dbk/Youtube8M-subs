00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:28.500
Hey what's going on everybody, Justin with
AmericanMuscle.com, as you can see, out in

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.770
Las Vegas with the MMD car for the big reveal,
and final stage of the build.

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:38.550
Now, cruising the strip right now in this
car is really just an amazing feeling, It

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:44.400
looks awesome, sounds incredible and basically
turning heads and breaking necks all the way

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:45.400
down the strip.

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:49.410
Feels right at home here underneath the big
lights and everything of Las Vegas.

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.960
We travelled over 2000 miles to reveal the
car at this year's SEMA show, and I have to

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:56.350
say the car is definitely ready for the big
event.

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:01.670
MMD really stepped up and gave us some great
parts for stage 2, along with the matte white

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:07.399
vinyl job, the 20" Forgestars and the Airlift
performance kit we added in stage 1, but,

00:01:07.399 --> 00:01:12.180
like I told you at the shop, it was up to
us, AmericanMuscle.com, and the Bama performance

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.240
team, to make sure this car was more than
just a pretty show car, and that's exactly

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:20.200
what we did, so I'm going to get this thing
into the convention center, onto the show

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:30.500
floor, and I'll tell you guys about some of
the big power adders we added in stage 3.

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:40.789
Well guys we made it, the car is on the floor
here at the SEMA show, looking great under

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:45.420
the lights and in Forgestar's booth with some
pretty cool company as well, but I'll tell

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.649
you what, let's cut to the chase and show
you some of the big mods we made in stage

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:49.649
3.

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:53.480
In order to give project MMD enough power
to back up these show car looks we needed

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:56.649
to do something big, that's exactly what we
did.

00:01:56.649 --> 00:02:00.789
We went with Vortech centrefugal blower kit
available for all 2011 and newer Mustangs,

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:06.520
but not just any Vortech kit, we went with
their black 20th anniversary edition kit,

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:09.090
just looks amazing under the hood of project
MMD.

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:15.120
The kit is based around this V3 SI trim compressor
and at the moment is pushing a pretty conservative

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.709
7 or 8 lbs of boost, but of course there's
always room to grow with a quick change of

00:02:18.709 --> 00:02:19.890
the pulley.

00:02:19.890 --> 00:02:24.670
Complimenting the Vortech I installed the
JLT replacement air intake, which did get

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.660
rid of that factory restrictive airbox, and
replaced it with this massive power stack

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:29.770
filter.

00:02:29.770 --> 00:02:34.209
Now this might give us a little more boost,
about a pound, pound and a half or so, and

00:02:34.209 --> 00:02:38.879
the best part is it was designed to work specifically
with the Vortech blower, but regardless it's

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:42.220
just going to make sure we're breathing a
lot better on the top end.

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:45.879
We're here with Mr RTR himself, my main man
Vaughn Gittin Jr.

00:02:45.879 --> 00:02:46.879
What's going on man.

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:47.920
Vaughn: What's up man good to see you.

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:50.030
Justin: Did you get a chance to check out
our MMD car we brought?

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:51.030
Vaughn: I did!

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:52.030
Justin: What did you think?

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:58.069
Vaughn: It's pretty sick man, I like the ducktail,
and I see you guys have bags on it, it's dope.

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:01.549
Justin: Alright guys the next part I'm going
to show you is something I'm really excited

00:03:01.549 --> 00:03:05.341
about, something we've never used before on
any of our project car builds, and I want

00:03:05.341 --> 00:03:06.879
you guys to see it so check this out.

00:03:06.879 --> 00:03:12.040
We decided to install the snow performance
water meth kid here on the project MMD, the

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:16.209
job of a kit like this is to help reduce the
temperatures of the combustion chamber, preventing

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:20.819
any detonation and lowering our intake air
temperatures which is always big on a forced

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:21.910
induction car.

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:25.819
Now, another nice thing about this is it's
going to allow us to safely run more ignition

00:03:25.819 --> 00:03:30.659
timing and a little bit more boost, while
using pump gas so we don't have to go to C16

00:03:30.659 --> 00:03:34.400
race gas or P85 to achieve bigger numbers.

00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:38.420
Very important part when we do decide to swap
out those pulleys later on, and go for really

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:41.000
big numbers.

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:46.680
Alright guys that's going to do it for some
of the big power adders, we did do a lot of

00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:50.450
cool stuff underneath the car which obviously
you can't see now, but we do have some great

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:52.969
footage of it from back at the shop.

00:03:52.969 --> 00:03:57.410
Ryan and I installed the driveshaft shop's
carbon fiber one piece driveshaft just for

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:01.249
a little added insurance when we really do
start beating on this car a little later on,

00:04:01.249 --> 00:04:06.139
and it's just a great product, a lot stronger
a lot lighter than our factory two piece driveshaft.

00:04:06.139 --> 00:04:09.909
This next part is a little custom and there's
a few different things to it so I'll explain

00:04:09.909 --> 00:04:14.780
all of them First up, we knew we wanted a
Boss exhaust for this car, the moment it took

00:04:14.780 --> 00:04:19.030
shape so, that's exactly what we did, we threw
a Boss mid pipe on it, got the really cool

00:04:19.030 --> 00:04:22.900
side exhaust which you can't see now of course
because the car is so low, but you can see

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:27.780
it on the footage, and it just sounds amazing,
dumps to exhaust in front of the rear tyre,

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:28.780
it's loud, it's obnoxious, it's great.

00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:33.070
Coming off the Boss mid pipe Ryan and I actually
had to get a little custom, I'll explain why

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:34.750
in a minute.

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:38.540
Right off the mid pipe what we have going
for us now, we fabbed up two 4" shorty Bullet

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:43.040
mufflers and two turndowns that do dump the
exhaust right underneath the rear axle, and

00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:48.170
paired with the Boss exhaust just sounds so
loud so angry and in your face, basically

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:50.660
everything we wanted for the MMD car.

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:54.880
Now let me show you why we had to do that,
come on back, this is why Ryan and I had to

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:59.210
get custom with our exhaust, check this thing
out man, this thing is the latest exhaust

00:04:59.210 --> 00:05:04.470
delete panel built specifically for the MMD
car here at SEMA.

00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:09.480
Obviously it deletes the exhaust, makes for
a much cleaner look back here, and basically

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:11.740
just totally sets this thing apart from the
rest.

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:15.760
They're actually going to build this panel
for your Mustang, but they will include cutouts

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:18.090
so you're not going to have to worry about
getting crazy with the exhaust but for the

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:21.100
purposes of our car, it really looks killer
back here.

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:26.340
But that wasn't it, they also threw this prototype
deck lid panel at us as well, very Mach 1

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:32.690
inspired, really cool on this car, and this
part with this part, just sets it off.

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:38.320
We're back here with Evan from Muscle Mustangs
&amp; Fast Fords, with the MMD car man, what do

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:39.400
you think of this bad boy.

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:43.030
Evan: Overall I love the package, we're always
looking for something different, and this

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:46.690
car is different, it's unique, but it's also
classic.

00:05:46.690 --> 00:05:52.960
Justin: With all the power adders on, with
all the appearance parts done, it's time to

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:56.910
talk numbers, we told you from the beginning
it was up to us, AmericanMuscle.com, and the

00:05:56.910 --> 00:06:01.090
Bama performance team to give this thing enough
power to back up its good looks, and that's

00:06:01.090 --> 00:06:02.890
exactly what we did.

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:07.000
The Bama performance team stepped in, Mike
and his crew wrote a tune for this thing,

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:12.860
put down 589 and 480 at the rear wheels, enough
to basically just incinerate the tires first

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:13.860
through fourth gear.

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:17.390
Brian from Vortech: I absolutely love it,
this car is sick, I've always loved white

00:06:17.390 --> 00:06:19.210
cars, and this is very cool.

00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:24.160
Justin: It is still a conservative tune, with
about 8 lbs of boost so we definitely have

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:28.280
room to grow if we do want to swap that pulley
out later on, and have a little bit more fun.

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:34.940
That's going to do it for the third and final
stage of project MMD here at SEMA, obviously

00:06:34.940 --> 00:06:39.000
MMD stepped up, made this thing look sick
here at the show, we stepped up, made sure

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.960
it had plenty of power under the hood.

00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:45.470
It's been fun building a car, using the road
a little less travelled for us, I mean Airlift

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:48.740
performance kit, that matte white vinyl, some
stuff we've never really done before and it's

00:06:48.740 --> 00:06:52.990
been a lot of fun, I've had a lot of fun driving
this thing all round Vegas, from the bright

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:57.200
lights of the strip, to the beautiful red
rock conservation center, and it's been a

00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:00.910
heck of a trip all around, so we hope you
guys have enjoyed watching the Project MMD's

00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:01.610
road to SEMA.
