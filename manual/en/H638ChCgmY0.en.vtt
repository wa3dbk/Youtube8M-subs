00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:07.980
Dance strongly transient human

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:12.720
Your life is based on wrong beliefs

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:33.940
If this is why you go against the divine punishment, even if you’ll see through your terrified nature, you’ll be fine

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:46.620
The solution you’ve been lead to, the ground forged; tonight you’ll fight for a grey moon

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:47.600
Break Out!

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.540
What do you think there’s in a forbidden game?

00:00:52.540 --> 00:00:58.000
This isn’t the death of an innocent smile, the battle isn’t over yet

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.900
EXceed the limit!

00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:01.680
Shoot Her Down!

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:06.060
Even scars will become pleasant

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:10.820
Someone was plotting; it’s subliminal, but

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:16.800
You don’t need to know now something like the end

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:25.260
Break through resignation, until you’ll be decorated with the gears you’ve accepted

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:43.260
The truth disappeared, yet not even God fears it. There’s not a reason, nor a beginning, the wild rose vanished

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:55.880
The Earth turns, offering to the life a broken solution, until it’ll become ashes

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:56.920
Break Out!

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.600
What will you dream about in a locked world?

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:07.380
Until you’ll be the last one, the fight won’t end

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:09.260
EXceed the limit!

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.060
Burst You Up!

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:15.400
I surrendered myself to this spiral, slowly falling

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:20.100
I threw again and again a fraud dice

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:26.180
Things won’t be able to turn back, to come back

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:34.500
The faults I headed towards, and fought; my raison d’être is there

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:07.020
Shoot Her Down!

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:11.360
Even scars will make you feel pleasure

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:16.020
Someone was plotting; it’s subliminal, but

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:22.040
Someday you won’t need to know something like the end

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:26.500
Finally you resigned to the gear’s voice

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:28.300
Burst You Up!

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:32.800
Even a trauma will become pleasant

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:37.460
I broke, destroyed the fraud dice

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:43.500
Things won’t be able to turn back, to come back

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:51.680
The faults I headed towards, and fought; cross the limit

00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:16.920
The night I’m tied to begins

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:23.760
While I start spilling empty tears
