00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:14.500
When your child is diagnosed with a congenital heart defect, it's kind of an overwhelming

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:21.119
experience. And understanding who can help you and who to reach out to will help you in your child's journey.

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:26.769
The Cardiac Center is unique because it's
the only organization within the country that

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:32.320
combines cardiologists, cardiac surgeons,
intensive care physicians, and anesthesiologists

00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:34.180
all dedicated to the care of children.

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:40.510
Everyone has the same objective, the same
mission for a patient with acquired or congenital

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:43.579
heart disease.This is all that we do.

00:00:43.579 --> 00:00:48.930
I am the patient care coordinator, the nurse
coordinator who helps the family navigate

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:49.930
their way through our system.

00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.120
I'm a pediatric cardiologist. Most typically
we take care of kids who are born with heart

00:00:56.129 --> 00:01:00.379
defects or structural problems with their
heart. I particularly spend a lot of time

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:04.870
taking care of kids with risk factors for
future heart disease like high cholesterol

00:01:04.870 --> 00:01:06.810
or high blood pressure.

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.410
I am one of the heart surgeons
in the Nemours Cardiac Center. I do  

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:14.450
heart and chest surgery on kids, starting with babies who are born with heart problems. 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:19.790
I also do surgeries for children who develop heart problems later, including heart failure,

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:23.720
may need heart transplantation, or mechanical devices to assist their heart.

00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:30.140
You have a long period of training that involves
general surgery and then cardiothoracic surgery

00:01:30.140 --> 00:01:35.330
in adults, and then you train to do surgery
in the pediatric population.

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:40.470
One of the most important parts of coming in for heart surgery is the trust that you have for the surgeon  

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:43.220
who's going to be performing it and the team who's going to take care of you.  

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:46.760
 We're very proud here of the extraordinary outcomes that we have.

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:49.220
Our outcomes really rank among the best in the country.

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:56.120
The transplant coordinator has a role that involves education of the patient, education of the parent,

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:01.780
explaining what it entails to live
with it after a transplantation to get the

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:04.280
most out of that transplantation.

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:12.580
I am the director of the cath lab, which includes diagnostic catheterization and most importantly,

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:18.120
interventional catheterization, which is the
treatment of heart disease through the blood

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:22.380
vessels without incisions, without open heart surgery, 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:27.939
Things that the patients had to undergo open heart surgery for and now we're doing it in the

00:02:27.939 --> 00:02:30.139
same day or overnight.

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:38.040
Our role as an intensivist is somebody to
take care of the babies when they're critically ill

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:42.640
 or the children that come in. But also
to coordinate our care back and forth with

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:46.870
the cardiac surgeons who may have operated
on the babies or the cardiologist who might

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:48.370
have sent the children in.

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:55.019
Electrophysiology is a study of arrhythmias.
I specialize in managing patients who have

00:02:55.019 --> 00:02:59.379
heart rhythm abnormalities. Heart
rhythms are too fast. Heart rhythms are too slow.

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:02.820
Patients who have pacemakers, patients who have defibrillators.

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:04.649
And we take good care of our patients.

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:09.819
We have an excellent group of nurses in the Cardiac Center. They are very dedicated to

00:03:09.819 --> 00:03:12.780
the care of the patients and families. 

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:18.180
The cardiac ICU nurses are highly trained
to take care of cardiac patients. The ratio

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:23.540
is usually one patient to one nurse. The nurses are at the bedside of your child 24 hours a day.

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:27.560
I am the director of the nurse practitioners
and the physician assistants in the Nemours

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:31.980
Cardiac Center. There's the attending
physician, such as myself or the cardiologist

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:36.349
or the surgeon, and then these are the next
people in line taking care of the children

00:03:36.349 --> 00:03:38.400
in the ICU. Many of them have been here since

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:41.580
we started the Cardiac Center, so they've
been a tremendous asset.

00:03:43.709 --> 00:03:48.450
There are four anesthesiologists in our division
and all of us are very experienced in taking

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:54.359
care of kids with heart disease. We are to
relieve pain and suffering, which is really

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:57.099
kind of a great job and when you put that in the context of working with children.

00:03:57.099 --> 00:04:01.139
it really is a very rewarding  professional pursuit.

00:04:01.139 --> 00:04:04.560
"Bye pumpkin!"
"I'll be careful with her, I promise." "Alright."

00:04:04.939 --> 00:04:11.179
All of the resources we need to take care
of a patient with any problem are really right here.

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:14.420
I can have them here in a heartbeat.

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:18.340
If I'm concerned about a patient I'm taking
care of, they're just down the hallway,

00:04:18.340 --> 00:04:21.060
in the next office, on the phone - I can
just get them immediately.

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:26.650
The way we work is extremely collaborative,which makes it extremely efficient. 

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:33.310
Like a nephrologist, a neurologist, a GI doctor - having that capability readily available is exceedingly important

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:37.780
particularly when you care for
the smallest and the sickest patients.

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:42.810
We have a clinical psychologist that works
with us. We have a developmental program,

00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:47.300
which we follow the infants from the time
after they've had surgery to three years.

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:53.000
We have a therapy department that can work with physical therapy that the child may need,

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:55.640
occupational therapy as well as a speech therapy department

00:04:55.640 --> 00:04:59.060
that can help with children that have feeding difficulties.  

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:02.840
And we have a respiratory therapy department that is dedicated to our team. 

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:05.140
We have a genetic counselor who works with us.

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:09.920
We have a dedicated dietician who
is able to increase the caloric intake as

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:14.250
far as the infants are concerned, and giving
healthy diet suggestions.  

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:19.160
We have a dedicated child life therapist that helps in explaining medical procedures

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:24.200
to the children in a way that it makes it
like play and makes them much more relaxed.

00:05:24.780 --> 00:05:31.240
The two biggest areas of support that I remember from our time were pastoral care and social work.  

00:05:31.240 --> 00:05:34.360
And I remember the chaplain stopping by our room a couple times. 

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:37.160
If we wanted to talk, he was there to listen.

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:42.440
Our social worker was a godsend - setting up all of the deliveries to our house, 

00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:47.180
ordering all the supplies that we needed, making sure we knew what resources were available in terms of

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:49.820
insurance and in terms of community support.

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:53.000
With her help we were able to make it home,and make it home successfully.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.880
We want families to understand that they are part of the care of their child so that 

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:01.740
we're on the same team to help their child be well again and be home with them.

00:06:01.740 --> 00:06:04.020
And because you're treated as part of the
team here,  

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:06.200
there is no question that you shouldn't ask.

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:09.620
Whatever is on your mind, your nurse,
the physician, whoever is there will answer you

00:06:09.630 --> 00:06:12.410
and answer in terms that you can understand.

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:17.710
We cannot really deliver this complex care
without knowing the families' interests,

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:19.690
needs, what is right for them.

00:06:19.690 --> 00:06:27.210
We recognize that it's difficult, that it can be very scary to be told that your child needs heart surgery.       

00:06:27.300 --> 00:06:33.620
I think that's one of the things that make this a great place - is that we all do recognize how much trust the parents are putting in us. 

00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:40.340
One thing we hear from the families who have chosen to have their care with us is how comfortable

00:06:40.350 --> 00:06:43.030
they become with the team that they work with.

00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:47.520
The  hospital support team on the floor,
they just get to be family with the family.

00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:53.430
We see that all the time. We get cards for
Christmas with pictures year after year 

00:06:53.430 --> 00:06:56.840
and they write in there that we've become part of their family.

00:06:56.840 --> 00:07:00.780
When they have an appointment in the outpatient clinic, they come up to the cardiac ICU and

00:07:00.780 --> 00:07:06.900
cardiac inpatient unit to see how everybody
is doing and to let us know how their child is doing.

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:10.440
This is very rewarding for everybody.
