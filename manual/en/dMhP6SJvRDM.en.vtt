00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:20.070
Hi, I'm Dr. Josh Axe and welcome to my kitchen.

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.130
This week I'm going to be making an antioxidant
trail mix.

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.801
One of the questions I get asked most frequently
is, "Dr. Axe, what do you do when you're traveling,

00:00:27.801 --> 00:00:30.900
when you're out on the road?

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:34.900
It's so hard because the only thing that's
out there is fast food restaurants, so what

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:35.900
you do?"

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:40.480
Well, I plan ahead of time and I pack, and
one of the things I always bring with me when

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.370
I'm traveling is my antioxidant trail mix.

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:47.760
This is good for, number one, the title of
it is antioxidant, which is going to help

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.050
fight free radical damage, help you age slower,
boost your energy levels, so this recipe is

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:54.190
good for so many things.

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:55.930
It's good for a kid's snack as well.

00:00:55.930 --> 00:01:00.980
What we're going to start off with here in
our antioxidant trail mix is almonds.

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:04.239
Almonds are good because they are a good source
of monounsaturated fat.

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:05.239
That's Omega-9 fats.

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:10.280
It's going to help balance your hormones,
help with actually lubricating your joints

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:11.741
and overall it's just a good, healthy nut.

00:01:11.741 --> 00:01:13.820
So we're going to start here with some almonds.

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:16.700
The next thing we're going to add in . . . and
it's about one cup of almonds.

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:19.140
The next thing we're going to add in is pecans.

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:24.330
Pecans are the most antioxidant rich nut that
is out there.

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.830
We're going to take one cup of pecans here
and add that in.

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:31.990
Both of these nuts are also good in fiber
which is good for your bowels and colon.

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:34.220
The next thing here is apples.

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:36.880
We've taken some dried apple slices.

00:01:36.880 --> 00:01:40.670
Apples are also a good source of fiber, good
source of vitamin, minerals, also very high

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:42.230
in antioxidants.

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:45.659
We're going to add those in here as well and
that's about a half . . . so we added one

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:51.759
cup of almonds, one cup of pecans, and one
cup of dried apple slices.

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:55.579
The next thing we're going to add in is something
to sweeten it up a little bit, and that's

00:01:55.579 --> 00:01:56.829
raisins.

00:01:56.829 --> 00:01:59.810
Raisins are actually loaded with potassium.

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.729
That's an electrolyte that's going to help
your body recover fast if you're working out

00:02:03.729 --> 00:02:06.950
and overall just help boost your energy levels.

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:11.230
We're going to start off here with, like I
said, about a half a cup of raisins.

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:15.500
Raisins are also high in antioxidants, the
same thing you're going to find in red wine

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:18.190
and grapes, Resveratrol.

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:20.790
That's the antioxidant you're going to find
in raisins.

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:24.170
The last thing here, everybody's favorite
food, chocolate.

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:26.980
We've got some dark chocolate here.

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:30.230
It's above 60% cocoa.

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:36.260
Cocoa is the antioxidant rich nutrient that
we're finding here in the dark chocolate.

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:39.590
So cocoa, we're going to add a half a cup
of dark chocolate chips.

00:02:39.590 --> 00:02:43.540
You can find these in just about any health
food store and even at regular convenient

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:46.230
grocery stores today you can find dark chocolate.

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:48.340
We're going to add those in here as well.

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:53.460
The last thing we're going to add in to taste
is some sea salt and then some cinnamon.

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:59.290
We're going to take some sea salt here, probably
put about a teaspoon in, just simply sprinkle

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:03.960
that on to kind of get the sweet and salty
taste that I personally love.

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:06.130
So we're going to add some sea salt in here.

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:11.220
Then the last thing we're going to add in
here is some organic cinnamon.

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:17.650
Cinnamon is actually one of the most nutrient-dense
and it's actually the highest antioxidant

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:20.790
food on the entire planet that we know of.

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:24.690
If you actually look in general, if you go
and look at what's called ORAC Score, that's

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:30.270
O-R-A-C, it's how well something fights free
radical damage and it's how many antioxidants

00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:31.390
are in something.

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:33.250
Cinnamon is ranked number one.

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:37.550
It's also great for balancing out blood glucose
levels, so blood sugar for diabetes and weight

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:39.280
lose and energy levels.

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.640
So we're going to also generously to throw
some cinnamon on here.

00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:47.300
I'll typically throw on about one teaspoon
of the cinnamon.

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:51.800
So we'll do the cinnamon here and the last
thing we're going to do is simply mix it up.

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:55.150
You can get a big spoon or use your hands
to mix it up.

00:03:55.150 --> 00:03:59.630
Simply mix up this antioxidant trail mix a
little bit and it's ready to go.

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:03.879
What I like to do when I'm traveling is simply
throw this in a big Ziploc bag and I'll bring

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:07.810
it to conferences with me, snack on it while
I'm on an airplane or while I'm traveling

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:09.060
in the car.

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:10.879
This is great also for a kid's snack.

00:04:10.879 --> 00:04:13.230
It's great for you when you're traveling.

00:04:13.230 --> 00:04:17.440
So now you don't have any excuses to eat the
unhealthy snacks when you're on your road

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:18.440
trips.

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:19.440
Now you have got a healthy snack.

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:35.750
You've got the antioxidant trail mix.
