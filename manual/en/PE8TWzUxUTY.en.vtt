Hi, I’m Frank Spear. I want to welcome you
to this blog.

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:18.650
We’re now into our seventh portion on anterior
temporization. And, some of the things that

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:24.500
we still haven’t talked about yet are custom
staining or custom shaving of your temporaries.

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.390
Now that may seem like kind of going a bit
too far but in reality there’s a lot of

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:32.989
times it’s a necessity. If you’re doing
one or two teeth in an older patient, often

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:37.420
none of the temporary materials look even
close to their teeth. And I want the temporary

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:42.730
to look pleasing enough so they’re not self-conscious.
In addition you have some patients who may

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:47.510
not want white teeth. They may want teeth
that have a certain appearance to them. And

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:50.260
I’m gonna actually share with you one of
those patients.

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:56.440
This is a patient who had been in my practice
for years, and um, did not want his anterior

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:01.829
teeth treated, because he was afraid I would
make them look too nice. And he was very serious

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:05.560
about that. He’s an artist and he didn’t
want straight white teeth.

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:10.729
I had treated his wife with veneers and she
was extremely happy we made the teeth very

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:14.060
pretty, but he was clear that’s not what
he wanted.

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:18.409
He finally decided he did need to do something
with how they looked, but he said, “You have

00:01:18.409 --> 00:01:22.310
to make it so they still look like they’re
mine, not like they’re part of everybody

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:27.750
else who wants to have their teeth done.”
So, the initial thing to do of course is to

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:33.509
try and decide what shade should we make them.
We’re gonna treat just the four anteriors,

00:01:33.509 --> 00:01:37.570
and it’s kind of a multi-colored approach.
In other words, it’s got a virtual shade

00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:42.350
guide across the anterior.
And ultimately, he and I talked about it.

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:49.409
He looked in a mirror and we came with A3.5,
which is pretty dark and pretty colorful.

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:53.539
But he said, “No, that’s what I want.”
And some of his teeth were a little darker

00:01:53.539 --> 00:01:57.759
than that. Obviously the right lateral was
significantly lighter than that.

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:03.549
Now to be honest, I wasn’t positive A3.5
is what he would want. He also didn’t want

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:09.429
them straight; he wanted them slightly malaligned.
And so, the malalignment was no problem. We

00:02:09.429 --> 00:02:14.460
had a diagnostic wax-up done that left the
teeth slightly malaligned. But I actually

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:20.620
made the temporary out of shaved A2 temporary
material, so he could see what it would look

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:25.870
like if they were lighter in shade.
Now honestly I knew A2 would be too bright,

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:32.120
but I knew I could also stain it down fairly
easily. And if I made it out of A3 temporary

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.709
material, often those are not very pretty
looking temporaries.

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:42.090
Well, the bottom line is he hated the A2 – hated
it. So the good news is, it’s easy to stain

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.040
temporaries. There’s a lot of different
products on the market.

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:50.110
I’m just going to show you what I’ve used
for probably the last 16 years. And that

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:55.280
is a product from Kulzer called Palaseal,
which was designed as a light-cured denture

00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:00.860
sealant. And I’m gonna mix with it, some
powdered porcelain stain.

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:06.830
So, when this photo was taken, when this patient
was treated I used the product from GC called

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:11.769
Orbit Stain. That product’s no longer
available on the market, but your lab can

00:03:11.769 --> 00:03:15.890
give you porcelain stain.
You just need powdered orange, powdered blue

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:20.590
and powdered white. And then you’re going
to mix it with the Palaseal in a dappen dish.

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:27.599
And I’m gonna show you a video in a minute
of how to do it. Super simple. Because it

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:31.959
won’t set until you light-cure it. So you
can put on your stain, get it to where you

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:38.250
want it. And here was that A2 temporary. And
after a few minutes’ time here’s that

00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:42.819
same temporary.
And literally by holding up an A3.5 shade

00:03:42.819 --> 00:03:48.840
tab, I could stain the temporary to literally
match that A3.5 tab.

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:55.140
Now I can try that back in, see if he likes
it or not. If he likes it, I photograph the

00:03:55.140 --> 00:04:00.790
shade tab next to the temporary, and that’s
what goes to lab is our shade photograph.

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:07.420
Here is the A3.5 temporary in his mouth.
In reality it doesn’t look too dark at all,

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:12.280
because of the shade of his lower anteriors
and his cuspid. And in fact, he loved it.

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:17.290
And so this is a case where staining the temporary
was really a helpful tool, not just to make

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:22.610
him happy while he’s wearing the temporary,
but also as a communication tool to him on

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:27.220
what’s possible for color and form, and
also to the laboratory.

00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:31.810
We send this photo and a photo of the shade
guide next to this temporary, and of course

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:37.360
we send a model of the temporary to the lab.
They can make a very simple putty matrix of

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:40.970
that temporary.
And it’ll tell them exactly where the incisal

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:46.020
edges should go of those final restorations
to replicate the form of the temporary.

00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:52.199
And, that’s what he looked like pre-treatment.
And again, his goal: not to have teeth that

00:04:52.199 --> 00:04:56.889
were too nice looking. Not too straight, not
too white. But much better than what he had

00:04:56.889 --> 00:05:02.070
and he was very pleased with the final result.
Now, just to walk you through actually doing

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:07.650
it, here’s a video of how we stain. We’ve
got our orange stain powder and our blue.

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:12.970
We put some clear Palaseal in one dish. We
mix the orange with Palaseal.

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:17.620
The orange will go on cervically but before
we do that we air-abrade the whole temporary

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:23.800
with aluminum oxide. And then once we put
a clear coat on every tooth and cure it. So

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:28.949
we put a clear coat on everything.
Now I take my orange, and color the cervical,

00:05:28.949 --> 00:05:34.000
and I color up the interproximals. So, it
defines the temporary more, because it gives

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:39.380
it some interproximal color.
And then we go to blue. And the blue starts

00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:45.090
to intensify the look of translucency in the
incisals, so we just put it up the interproximals

00:05:45.090 --> 00:05:50.580
and across the incisal edge.
And then we come over all of that with clear.

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:55.970
So it’s one layer of clear, followed by
the colored layers, cure it, another layer

00:05:55.970 --> 00:06:00.910
of clear. And I like to actually cure it for
several minutes in an oven. I use a triad

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:05.720
oven. Umm, there’s many other ovens on the
market that use halogen light. It’s one

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:10.639
or two of them.
And you end up with a very nice surface. Now,

00:06:10.639 --> 00:06:19.110
I do polish it with pumice and Ivoclar polishing
paste, because to me, Palaseal is too shiny.

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:24.889
It also has an oxygen-inhibited layer on it.
So, I polish it. And this is what it looks

00:06:24.889 --> 00:06:29.050
like after you’ve polished it. You can see
the color interproximally. You can see the

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:35.110
blue. It’s not overly done in this case.
But that’s a simple example of how we stain

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:40.139
temporaries. And for a lot of cosmetic cases,
it’s not done. But for a lot of patients

00:06:40.139 --> 00:06:46.039
who are really looking to get natural-looking
teeth, I find staining very helpful tool to

00:06:46.039 --> 00:06:50.139
test-drive the color before I have the lab
commit to it.

00:06:50.139 --> 00:06:54.889
So, I hope you’ve enjoyed this part of the
segment. One of the things we haven’t done

00:06:54.889 --> 00:06:58.910
yet with anterior temporaries is adjust them
in the mouth. Everything I’ve shown you

00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:03.300
so far is contouring them on the lab bench.
But in the next segment we’ll talk about

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:07.050
what happens if you actually need to make
some adjustments – the length or embrasure

00:07:07.050 --> 00:07:11.740
form in the mouth. It’s nice to not take
it out. So, I’ll look forward to seeing

00:07:11.740 --> 00:07:12.240
you there.
