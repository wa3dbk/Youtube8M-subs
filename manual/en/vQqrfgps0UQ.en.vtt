00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:07.080
Today on this 2003 Ford E-250 we are going
to install part number 87115 from Hidden Hitch.

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.050
This also applies to part number 75191 from
Draw-Tite.

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:13.320
Looking at the drivers side frame rail we
will show you where the hitch installs.

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.190
We are going to install using this forward
hole here, this slot right below the canister,

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:22.050
this existing hole, and also this rearmost
hole here.

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.560
It will be identical on both sides.

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:25.560

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:43.820
The first step involved is to take down the
carbon canister on the frame rail 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:48.100
on the drivers side.

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:54.460
That will give us some working room to our
bolts in.

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:58.879
Then we can life the hitch into position.

00:00:58.879 --> 00:01:06.190
Next we will install the hardware.

00:01:06.190 --> 00:01:41.249
This is the slot we are going to use, it is
going to use 

00:01:41.249 --> 00:01:48.679
the carriage bolt and the plate.

00:01:48.679 --> 00:02:04.459
And we can 

00:02:04.459 --> 00:02:10.849
put our canister back into place.

00:02:10.849 --> 00:02:12.379
