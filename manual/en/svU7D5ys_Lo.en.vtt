00:00:01.868 --> 00:00:04.169
            White ball          
            in the hole         
            right over there.   

00:00:05.072 --> 00:00:07.105
                    (EXCLAIMS)  

00:00:07.174 --> 00:00:09.240
 Eric, you just                 
 scratched on purpose.          

00:00:09.309 --> 00:00:11.543
            Yeah, well,         
            I'm a loser anyway. 

00:00:18.218 --> 00:00:19.518
          Hey,                  
          do you wanna talk?    

00:00:21.321 --> 00:00:22.487
       What, you and me?        

00:00:23.757 --> 00:00:25.891
        Yeah.                   
        Can we do that?         

00:00:26.993 --> 00:00:28.326
        Why, I mean,            
        I don't know.           

00:00:28.394 --> 00:00:30.362
 We never have before.          

00:00:30.431 --> 00:00:32.197
            No, not in          
            the last six years. 

00:00:32.266 --> 00:00:33.631
 Not even that year             
 we lived together.             

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:35.567
            I know.             
            I completely forgot 
            about that year.    

00:00:35.635 --> 00:00:36.667
                 When was that? 

00:00:36.736 --> 00:00:38.536
 That was last year.            

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:42.674
                      Oh!       
        Oh!                     

00:00:42.742 --> 00:00:44.776
 So, you want                   
 to try talking                 
 and see what happens?          

00:00:46.045 --> 00:00:48.446
            What could          
            you and I possibly  
            have to talk about? 

00:00:49.749 --> 00:00:50.782
         Okay.                  

00:00:52.152 --> 00:00:54.286
        My life sucks, Shawnie. 

00:00:54.354 --> 00:00:56.688
         I lost my apartment... 
         My apartment!          

00:00:56.756 --> 00:00:59.291
               I lost Rachel... 
               Rachel!          

00:00:59.359 --> 00:01:01.526
           I lost               
           my best friend Jack. 
           Rachel!              

00:01:03.096 --> 00:01:05.863
            And now I'm about   
            to lose Feeny to    
            that mean old lady. 

00:01:05.932 --> 00:01:07.232
                     Jack!      

00:01:10.136 --> 00:01:14.339
 Well, Eric, I lost             
 something that means more      
 to me than any of that,        

00:01:14.407 --> 00:01:16.341
 and I managed to survive.      

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:18.109
          You mean              
          your dead dad, Shawn? 

00:01:18.845 --> 00:01:20.645
 You're a sensitive guy.        

00:01:20.713 --> 00:01:22.514
              Hey, thanks, man. 

00:01:23.783 --> 00:01:25.850
         I just wish that       
         Rachel could see that. 

00:01:25.919 --> 00:01:27.552
            I mean, I love her. 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:29.253
 Let me                         
 ask you something.             

00:01:29.323 --> 00:01:32.056
 Do you think                   
 the two of you would           
 actually make a good couple?   

00:01:32.125 --> 00:01:34.259
               She's so pretty. 

00:01:34.328 --> 00:01:37.461
 Right. But what about her      
 attracts you spiritually?      

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.832
               Oh, spiritually. 
               She's so pretty. 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:45.737
 Okay, but what                 
 about her personality          
 makes her your ideal woman?    

00:01:45.805 --> 00:01:48.038
            Well, she's pretty, 
            like I said,        

00:01:48.107 --> 00:01:53.511
          and she can           
          walk really good,     
          and she's got this... 

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:55.079
              You know what?    
              Why don't you     
              just go ask Jack? 

00:01:55.148 --> 00:01:57.348
 I mean,                        
 he's the one who won her.      

00:01:57.417 --> 00:01:58.983
                You know,       
                it sounds to me 

00:01:59.051 --> 00:02:00.217
          like you care more    
          about the competition 
          with Jack             

00:02:00.287 --> 00:02:01.453
              than you actually 
              care about her.   

00:02:01.521 --> 00:02:03.421
 Oh, well, now, see,            
 that is ridiculous.            

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:06.090
 I could've won that.           
 I could. I swear.              
 He cheated.                    

00:02:07.427 --> 00:02:08.560
              Because Dad died? 

00:02:08.629 --> 00:02:10.629
 Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.              
 I mean, he was grieving.       

00:02:10.697 --> 00:02:12.463
 Chicks totally dig             
 people that are grieving.      

00:02:12.533 --> 00:02:14.900
 Now, don't get me wrong.       
 I know it was your dad         
 and everything, I really do,   

00:02:14.968 --> 00:02:17.201
 but I'm pretty sure            
 it was a fix.                  

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:19.137
             Eric, you know,    
             I feel really good 

00:02:19.205 --> 00:02:20.906
                about my life   
                right now.      

00:02:20.974 --> 00:02:23.441
        Because when I took off 
        in my dad's trailer,    

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.309
               I had a moment,  
               just one moment, 

00:02:25.379 --> 00:02:28.079
       that made everything     
       completely clear for me. 

00:02:28.147 --> 00:02:29.614
              I was looking     
              at the night sky, 

00:02:30.551 --> 00:02:32.350
                and I could     
                see everything, 

00:02:32.419 --> 00:02:36.987
             the stars,         
             planets, galaxies. 

00:02:37.056 --> 00:02:39.291
   You must've                  
   felt so small.               

00:02:39.359 --> 00:02:42.294
            I did.              
            I totally did.      
            I felt like a speck 

00:02:42.362 --> 00:02:46.631
             who was here for   
             one moment in time 
             and then gone.     

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.300
           And I decided        
           that while I'm here, 

00:02:48.368 --> 00:02:51.403
         I wanna be             
         with my friends        
         and the people I love. 

00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:55.540
             Because when       
             I'm with you guys, 

00:02:55.609 --> 00:02:57.509
                   I don't feel 
                   that small.  

00:02:59.412 --> 00:03:00.912
                 That's what    
                 I figured out. 

00:03:03.083 --> 00:03:04.882
      But that's for you.       

00:03:06.052 --> 00:03:08.453
           Yeah, that's for me. 

00:03:08.522 --> 00:03:10.888
   So, I guess I got            
   to figure stuff out, too,    

00:03:11.724 --> 00:03:13.224
          but for me.           

00:03:13.293 --> 00:03:14.526
                  For you.      

00:03:15.696 --> 00:03:17.095
 I'm glad                       
 you came back,                 
 Shawn.                         

00:03:17.931 --> 00:03:19.598
            That's a nice talk. 

00:03:19.666 --> 00:03:21.933
 Yeah, it was.                  
 We should do this              
 again sometime.                

00:03:28.742 --> 00:03:31.041
       (ALL CHATTERING)         

00:03:35.449 --> 00:03:37.549
                Now, remember,  
                we are not here 
                as a couple.    

00:03:37.617 --> 00:03:40.552
       I'll sit with you,       
       I may dance with you,    
       but we are not together. 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:43.821
 I know. I know.                
 You reminded me                
 three times in the car.        

00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:46.391
 Don't worry.                   
 The only feelings              
 I have for you                 

00:03:46.460 --> 00:03:47.925
 are friendly feelings.         

00:03:47.994 --> 00:03:49.594
            Okay,               
            but it's a wedding. 

00:03:49.662 --> 00:03:50.462
               I don't want     
               you getting      
               all sappy on me. 

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:51.829
 Oh, come on.                   

00:03:51.898 --> 00:03:54.499
           Am I the sappy type? 

00:03:54.567 --> 00:03:58.369
                 Oh, Morgan's   
                 a flower girl. 
                 Gimme a kiss.
