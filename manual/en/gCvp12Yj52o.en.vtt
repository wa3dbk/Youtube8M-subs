SHIVANI SINGHVI: Hi. I'm Shivani, on behalf
of Expert Village. In this clip, I'm going

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:11.800
to tell you how to make Mint Leaves Parathas.
And now, let's start with the Mint Leaves

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:21.360
Paratha. That's the mint leaves, we add some
coriander powder, some salt as per taste,

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:39.520
sprinkle some red chilli powder, some dry
mango powder, some carrom seeds followed by

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:54.310
couple of cumin seeds. Mix all the ingredients,
lay all the mixed ingredients onto the kneaded

00:00:54.310 --> 00:01:05.300
dough. It should be well spread, start sealing
it, should be sealed nicely without any mixture

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:19.000
coming out. Now, we use our rolling pin and
start rolling. Should be nicely spread, before

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:28.570
it goes into the hot pan to roast, and there
you go, it's on the hot pan, with a drop of

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:50.070
oil, that will help not to stick onto the
pan. Then we go using our cooking spoon,

00:01:50.070 --> 00:02:05.760
turning it around. As you can see it has started
cooking, it's turning brown now, slowly and

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:15.819
steadily. And now it's red in color, just
add some butter to it and it's ready to eat.

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:17.650
It seems delicious.
