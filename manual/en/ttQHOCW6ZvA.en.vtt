00:00:03.235 --> 00:00:06.035
Welcome to this tutorial about how you can

00:00:06.035 --> 00:00:08.315
Create a simple 3D book cover

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:14.160
You can either go to the "Format" tab when you

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:16.240
have clicked on the picture

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:20.900
Instead I'll right click, go to "format picture"

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:23.840
Then I'll select "3D rotation"

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:28.980
Here you can choose a few perspective views

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:32.800
Now go to "3D Format"

00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:38.040
Select the "Depth" to simulate the amount of pages

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:43.540
If you want you can create a contour line, black or grey

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:47.940
Now you should create a shadow

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:54.180
I'll choose this shadow perspective

00:00:54.620 --> 00:00:56.648
Now you can add a blur to your shadow

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.980
Now you've seen the first 3D-book cover

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.280
Here we have two other examples

00:01:09.535 --> 00:01:14.475
Right click on the picture and select "Format Picture..."

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.320
Menu: 3D Rotation

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.980
And select a perspective

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:23.320
Menu: 3D Format

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:27.320
Add a number to "Depth" to simulate the pages

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:36.740
Here you can change the Depth Color to white

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:38.220
That will also simulate pages or the spine of the book

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:42.060
You should also change the lighting

00:01:44.444 --> 00:01:47.844
You can also add a contour line if you want

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.500
Line size should be about 0,5 pt

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:02.640
Now I'll change back to the default options

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.720
You should also create a shadow

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:10.240
Add a blur to your shadow

00:02:12.675 --> 00:02:17.995
Here is the final result
