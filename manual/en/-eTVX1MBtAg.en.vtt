and a groundbreaking Learn to Steer technology. With Lean to Steer,

00:00:30.079 --> 00:00:33.820
you can easily steer with one hand, which

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:39.820

the other hand free to make adjustments

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:41.010

trusted by top golf courses and sports
fields worldwide,

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:51.059
Toro understands that accurate
application is key.

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:55.050
Toro designed this sprayer with a high
capacity 20 gallon tank that's

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:59.850
easy to fill, easy to drain, and big
enough to cover most jobs

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.309
without having to stop to refill. And the
low profile design allows for greater

00:01:04.309 --> 00:01:07.560
stability and control on hills and
rougher terrain.

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.960
A tank was also designed with two
agitation nozzles

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:15.259
which keep wettable powder suspended at all times. That means a consistent

00:01:15.259 --> 00:01:18.179
mix with no wasteful build up at the
bottom of the tank.

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:22.440
The sprayer nozzles are protected under
the bumper, offering two settings:

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:27.149
narrow, which brings up to 5 feet, and wide, with coverage up to 11 feet.

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:30.860
There's even a standard spray wand on
board for easy spot spraying.

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:36.100
Then there's the spreader, with a large
hopper that can hold 175 pounds of

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:38.920
material and a clear cover that keeps
moisture out.

00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.680
You can also haul another 50 pounds
with you, so you don't have to head back to the

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:44.369
truck for a refill.

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:47.080
You can change the spreading pattern
from 3 feet

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:52.130
up to 22 feet and deflect material away
from sidewalks and ornamental landscapes.

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:55.840
Toro built this pressure sprayer with
heavy duty stainless steel

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.020
to reduce corrosion

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:02.080
and the compact size makes it easy to get around, including through 36 inch gates.

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:06.600
It's easy to operate with features like
electric start, lean to steer,

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:12.020
and quick access controls packed with a
powerful 9 horsepower Subaru engine

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:16.110
with speeds up to 5.5 miles
an hour, it can handle all types of

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.670
terrain

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.740
And with the rugged hydrostatic
transmission, there are no

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:21.060
belts to maintain.

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.239
Toro understands that with all your hours
on the job

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:28.679
the ride needs to be comfortable. The
floating stand on operator platform absorbs

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:32.680
bumps and vibration and features thick padding to reduce fatigue.

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:37.260
