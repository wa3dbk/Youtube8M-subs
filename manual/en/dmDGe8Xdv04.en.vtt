00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:26.770
After one of these best years
of competetion

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:30.480
Bomber has finally made it
to the big stage

00:00:30.556 --> 00:00:31.666
Blizzcon!

00:00:31.666 --> 00:00:34.918
It's the combination of
basically, everything for the year

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:37.973
Blizzcon is our Superball

00:00:37.973 --> 00:00:40.833
It is a pinnacle
of Starcraft II competition

00:00:40.833 --> 00:00:44.413
It is where the strongest pro-gamers
from every region come to show

00:00:44.413 --> 00:00:45.893
what they can do

00:00:45.893 --> 00:00:48.363
For 2014, dozens
of tornaments played across

00:00:48.363 --> 00:00:53.066
North America, Europe, Korea
this is the ultimate opportunity to say

00:00:53.066 --> 00:01:00.129
I am the best in the world and I will
never be forgotten in Starcraft's history

00:01:00.129 --> 00:01:03.183
Whoever wins this tornament
we will go down

00:01:03.183 --> 00:01:05.883
as immediately one of the great
StarCraft II players of all time

00:01:05.883 --> 00:01:08.593
You go to Blizzcon this year and they had
former champions' posts up

00:01:08.593 --> 00:01:12.083
at the entrance; evrerybody who wins
a WCS Global Final

00:01:12.083 --> 00:01:17.503
is going to be looked up to, and soft of
immortalized through that victory

00:01:17.903 --> 00:01:22.426
As a professional gamer
winning Blizzcon would mean

00:01:22.426 --> 00:01:27.029
everything a pro-gamer
could have achieved in one's career

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:31.090
With a higher level of competion
comes in even greater award

00:01:31.111 --> 00:01:36.388
Blizzcon has 250,000 dollar prize full
open for the taking

00:01:36.388 --> 00:01:43.516
As a professional Starcraft II player
Blizzcon is not so much about the prize

00:01:43.516 --> 00:01:49.111
but it's where the world's finest
come to compete in the biggest event

00:01:49.111 --> 00:01:52.086
It is about the honor
rather than the prize money

00:01:52.086 --> 00:01:56.163
It is not just winning one title.
It's not just getting money

00:01:56.163 --> 00:02:00.543
It's being the best at something that
you dedicated your whole entire life to

00:02:00.543 --> 00:02:02.463
There is nothing bigger

00:02:02.463 --> 00:02:08.061
There is nothing more that any of this
players could want until get this title

00:02:08.061 --> 00:02:17.489
This may be my last Blizzcon and I am certain
that every match will be memorable win or lose

00:02:17.489 --> 00:02:19.758
No matter how you look at it,
it's the biggest tornamant of the year

00:02:19.758 --> 00:02:23.318
We will have most respect dataset
the biggest model of place mind itself

00:02:23.318 --> 00:02:25.838
This will be truly
something special for Bomber

00:02:25.851 --> 00:02:28.001
This is one you truly want to excel

00:02:28.001 --> 00:02:30.511
I think that no matter
how he performs this year's Blizzcon

00:02:30.511 --> 00:02:32.788
he'll always be one of the best
Startcraft II Players of all time

00:02:32.788 --> 00:02:37.026
It would be the best case scenario
if I were to win the championship before retiring

00:02:37.026 --> 00:02:40.694
All that I can really do is try my best

00:02:40.824 --> 00:02:44.384
I think is very realistic to expect that
Bomber would at least make it

00:02:44.384 --> 00:02:48.234
to the semi-final of Blizzcon prabably
because of hot 3 days been on

00:02:48.234 --> 00:02:50.290
Bomber was definitely a favorite

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:53.016
Then, just looking at third foruth
quarters this year

00:02:53.016 --> 00:02:55.214
his performancces has been dominating

00:02:55.214 --> 00:02:57.124
He is beat the bests

00:02:57.124 --> 00:03:00.074
Being so confident,
being able to back it up with results

00:03:00.074 --> 00:03:02.474
I think that is made him the scarest

00:03:02.474 --> 00:03:06.044
It's one of the things that made him a big
threat going into Blizzcon especially

00:03:06.224 --> 00:03:09.224
MMA is a huge match up on paper

00:03:09.224 --> 00:03:13.754
MMA is a huge match up on paper

00:03:13.754 --> 00:03:17.094
MMA is always been a very aggressive
very dangerous Terran player

00:03:17.514 --> 00:03:21.744
He's been successful in a lot of TVTs

00:03:37.496 --> 00:03:43.606
Our first game MMA bullet face off
Terran vs. Terran

00:03:44.405 --> 00:03:47.277
MMA and Bomber match up
was a rollercoaster

00:03:47.277 --> 00:03:49.960
This is an opportunity for Bomber
to get into the infrastructure

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:51.433
Do all the damage

00:03:51.433 --> 00:03:54.857
Bomber just dominant,
absolutely dominant in this game

00:03:54.857 --> 00:03:58.707
Bomber manages to take the first game
from the position that

00:03:58.707 --> 00:04:01.537
didn't look really winable, but MMA just
continuously throughout the series

00:04:01.537 --> 00:04:05.857
shows that he was
almost moving a little too fast

00:04:05.857 --> 00:04:09.147
Good stuff here from MMA!
Bomber was a 200 supply!

00:04:09.147 --> 00:04:13.797
He is down to 140. That's what happens
when you lose a lot of its position

00:04:13.797 --> 00:04:20.377
And going through GG! MMA!
Ties up the series. An amazing game #2

00:04:20.441 --> 00:04:24.397
I think MMA figured out something
so slight that

00:04:24.397 --> 00:04:26.773
he was able to exploit on Bomber

00:04:26.773 --> 00:04:30.811
All right. Game #3 now! And this is
really can pick up that by MMA

00:04:30.811 --> 00:04:33.631
Ah, really brilliant there from MMA
And it feels like Bomber deal with

00:04:33.631 --> 00:04:36.251
one problem at a time but not thinking
about a next possible move

00:04:36.251 --> 00:04:39.201
that comes out from MMA

00:04:39.201 --> 00:04:42.091
And here comes the drop
The last that Bomber wants to deal with

00:04:42.091 --> 00:04:44.521
because he's got this touch outside
from the main base

00:04:44.521 --> 00:04:48.831
And as more fire power hit from MMA, push
forward, big army supply advantage now

00:04:48.831 --> 00:04:52.911
There we go. GG. MMA takes Game #3
And wow! He is now one game away

00:04:52.911 --> 00:04:57.461
from the round 4

00:04:57.491 --> 00:05:01.671
Bomber is so aggressive and attacts
so much that everyone's on the defensive

00:05:01.671 --> 00:05:03.621
and even in the equal position
Bomber can still find a way

00:05:03.621 --> 00:05:06.801
to puncture a hole in your defense

00:05:06.801 --> 00:05:12.591
And MMA did a tiny, small, little
but very very annoying

00:05:12.591 --> 00:05:15.211
and very very distracting counter attack

00:05:15.271 --> 00:05:17.381
Gee, it's not good in for Bomber

00:05:17.381 --> 00:05:20.191
Bomber is always very aggressive player
and most of the time

00:05:20.191 --> 00:05:22.661
he is able to overun his opponents

00:05:22.661 --> 00:05:26.151
But MMA was keeping up, he kept his cool
and after that MMA went

00:05:26.151 --> 00:05:28.571
into the later phase
of the game with an advantage

00:05:28.571 --> 00:05:30.971
and he played that very well

00:05:30.971 --> 00:05:34.404
And six times pockets Baby, MMA!
He is able to make it out

00:05:37.837 --> 00:05:41.271
GG! MMA!

00:05:56.907 --> 00:05:59.433
It was disappointing to see Bomber go out

00:05:59.433 --> 00:06:01.959
not just because
he is very likable character

00:06:01.959 --> 00:06:04.487
and we always want to see someone
like Bomber do well

00:06:04.487 --> 00:06:07.497
especially because, you know,
could be in the last Blizzcon

00:06:07.497 --> 00:06:10.327
he was going into this Blizzcon
in such a hot streak

00:06:10.327 --> 00:06:13.577
After all the success that
Bomber had in 2014

00:06:13.577 --> 00:06:17.587
given all of his prior results and records,
it does seem like kind of a match that

00:06:17.587 --> 00:06:22.147
Bomber really would've felt most confident
in and against an opponent that

00:06:22.147 --> 00:06:25.117
he definitely believed that he can beat

00:06:25.117 --> 00:06:27.047
For Bomber, he know that
he was hoping for more

00:06:27.047 --> 00:06:29.867
and he knows how he is escapable
for more as well

00:06:30.372 --> 00:06:33.822
And it is still nice to see that even
when Bomber loses

00:06:33.822 --> 00:06:38.032
you still get to see his style, you still
get to see how he attack oriented he is

00:06:38.032 --> 00:06:41.796
You still get to see how relentless
he is even when he is in a bad position

00:06:41.796 --> 00:06:44.045
You never know
what is going to happen in life

00:06:44.045 --> 00:06:46.854
I have no regretes whatsoever,
Because I couldn't do it any better

00:06:46.854 --> 00:06:48.835
even if I could rewind time.

00:06:58.504 --> 00:07:01.304
Bomber's road to Blizzcon
has come to an end

00:07:01.304 --> 00:07:04.764
But for life, the tornament is
just getting started

00:07:04.764 --> 00:07:08.734
At 17 years old, he finds himself
on Starcraft's biggest stage

00:07:08.734 --> 00:07:12.734
with his sight sets of becoming
the Blizzcon champion
