00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:03.540
Hi I am doctor Shikha MD of NutriHealth Systems.

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:09.170
Many people have written to us asking that
what is the cause of grey hair.

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:14.160
And of course what is the remedy and what
are the cures possible for grey hair.

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:16.200
So there are many causes for grey hair.

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:20.340
In young people having grey hair could be
due to stress.

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:24.170
Because sudden stress breaks down your immune
reaction.

00:00:24.170 --> 00:00:28.160
And due to that breakdown in that immunity
the melanin pigments are attacked by immune

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:31.890
cells and therefore the discolouration or
greyness starts.

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:37.430
It could also be due to lack of vital ingredients
in your diet.

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:43.960
Like for example folic acid, biotin, vitamin
C, B12... which cause grey hair.

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:47.487
Third could be the deficiency of protein in
your diet which could cause grey hair also.

00:00:47.487 --> 00:00:55.340
And of course a lot of grey hair is also due
to lack of oil in the hair, lack of nourishment

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:56.850
in the hair.

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:03.820
And lot of people who use chemical colourants
or gels or reagents or harsh shampoos that

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:07.299
also leads to breakdown of melanin and grey
hair.

00:01:07.299 --> 00:01:10.719
Now other reasons for grey hair could also
be sun exposure.

00:01:10.719 --> 00:01:16.640
So if people are exposed to sun for long period
of time that leads to grey hair and it is

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:25.929
very important to use an umbrella or to use
for example aloe vera juice and soak it overnight

00:01:25.929 --> 00:01:29.969
or you can leave aloe vera juice in your hair
and the next morning you can wash your hair.

00:01:29.969 --> 00:01:32.969
Because aloe vera also protects the hair.

00:01:32.969 --> 00:01:37.319
Now some of the remedies which you could do
for grey hair is of course there is a diet

00:01:37.319 --> 00:01:42.270
portion and then there is a portion where
you could apply some of the oils.

00:01:42.270 --> 00:01:48.159
Now bhringraj oil is one of the very popular
Ayurvedic oils which is specifically for grey

00:01:48.159 --> 00:01:49.159
hair.

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:50.159
And similarly Arnica.

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.000
Arnica is an Indian herb.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.969
And you can use Arnica either alone or you
can use Arnica as a shampoo.

00:01:57.969 --> 00:02:00.299
Or you can even use Arnica put in oil.

00:02:00.299 --> 00:02:05.590
Which could be like Castor oil or Olive oil
or Til oil.

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:10.080
But if you are using til oil it has to be
used only in winters and not in summers.

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:14.330
So some of these remedies especially Bhringraj
and Arnica are traditional Indian remedies

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:17.760
which are available as Arnica oil or Bhringraj
oil for hair.

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:23.450
Which are also very cooling in nature and
also lead to sort of a prevention or you can

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.020
say control of grey hair.

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:28.330
