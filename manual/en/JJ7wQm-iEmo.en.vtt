WURM: TRIPLE TROUBLE

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:22.630
Hi everyone, today we have the pleasure to present you
the basic guide of the meta event of the

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:24.419
wurm triple trouble.

00:00:24.419 --> 00:00:28.679
As many of you probably know, the event is composed
of several phases and to successfully complete it

00:00:28.679 --> 00:00:30.500
you need a lot of coordination.

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:35.300
As a general vision, we can say that there are
three wurms that you have to kill

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:39.920
in less than 14 minutes. Once you kill one
of them, the timer goes down to 1 minute.

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.470
so you would have just that minute
to kill the bodies of the other two.

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:47.670
Once you accomplish this, you have 2 minutes
more to kill the heads and end the

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:48.780
meta event.

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:49.470
Let's begin...

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:54.239
The event always starts in the Firthside Vigil
Waypoint at even hours.

00:00:54.239 --> 00:00:58.860
The first phase is an escort that gets separated
into 3 routes, one for each wurm. They are

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:02.689
escort events more or less long in wich
we confront waves of mobs

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:06.490
and break wurm's eggs as we advance
to the encounter with

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:09.979
the wurm, at which point the second phase will
begin.

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:14.090
For the bodies' phase the most important things
are power and vitality because the wurm can't

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:19.530
be hit with a crit and it will be vital to soak
the damage. Every mob in this second

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.860
phase has a lot of toughness, and because of that
direct damage barely do anything.

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:28.280
It should be good to have a group of
people with condition damage that dedicates

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:29.830
to clean the area.

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:30.710
Let's do the wurms...

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:34.409
Amber:
During amber's escort we will meet

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:39.210
with a boss called "Plagued Carrier Abomination"
from which we must be close when he dies

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.620
so he buff us.

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:45.090
Once in the place of the fight, we will see a
red arrow pointing downwards to

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:50.060
the point in which the wurm will eat
some 20-25 unwary each turn.

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:55.080
Those 20-25 people must have stability
and regeneration, because there is a tick

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.590
The rest of the players should clean
the mobs in the area.

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.979
Inside the stomach, under your feet
there is a harpoon that you must get, with it,

00:02:02.979 --> 00:02:07.080
you must shoot the valve of the wurm
until you kill it, and warning! once

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:12.909
outside of the stomach you only have 1 possible
shoot that you must use against the wurm.

00:02:12.909 --> 00:02:16.670
With 20 stacks removed the wurm becomes
vulnerable.

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:21.739
Take this opportunity to do max dps...
When it becomes invulnerable again, the

00:02:21.739 --> 00:02:26.409
20-25 group that didn't enter the first
time in the stomach will enter now and the ones

00:02:26.409 --> 00:02:29.010
that have just gone out will clean the area.

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.709
Crimson:
This wurm's mechanic is simple, there are

00:02:31.709 --> 00:02:36.590
some "coloured clouds" in the area and some
platforms with those colours. 20-25

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:40.689
people should dedicate themselves to take those
buff to the platforms; and the other

00:02:40.689 --> 00:02:45.689
20-25 people should clean the area mobs.
We should point out that we can carry all three

00:02:45.689 --> 00:02:50.489
coloured buffs at the same time but if we get
hit we will lose them, nonetheless, there are

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:55.519
nutrients in the area that if we take them
we can block 1 attack.

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:58.939
When the 3 platforms are full we make
the wurm vulnerable.

00:02:58.939 --> 00:03:00.189
Dps and repeat...

00:03:00.189 --> 00:03:04.299
Cobalt:
We have 3 points where we will take

00:03:04.299 --> 00:03:08.180
some kegs, jump across some platforms
above water without falling to reach a

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:12.760
meeting point, from there we get close to
the wurm and hit the 1 skill

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:18.709
With 20 stacks we make it vulnerable.
Then it's just dps and repeat...

00:03:18.709 --> 00:03:22.709
For this wurm, if we have 50 people,
30 should dedicate to take kegs.

00:03:22.709 --> 00:03:27.299
Adds:
During all the combat we will find the

00:03:27.299 --> 00:03:31.969
same kinds of adds. We have:
A) the husks: that have a lot of toughness

00:03:31.969 --> 00:03:36.139
and is better to do condition damage to them. Take
special care at Amber, because they push the people

00:03:36.139 --> 00:03:40.879
that are waiting under the red arrow.
B) The eggs: that you should kill quickly because

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:46.059
they spawn grubs. These grubs can be killed 
easily by reflecting their own projectiles.

00:03:46.059 --> 00:03:52.059
C) We can reflect the eggs when they are thrown
with projectile reflecting skills.

00:03:52.059 --> 00:03:53.359
D) Wurms

00:03:53.359 --> 00:03:57.189
And with this we have explained the bodies'
phase, now let's go to the heads...

00:03:57.189 --> 00:03:59.669
Phase 3:
For the last phase the most important thing is

00:03:59.669 --> 00:04:04.489
the dps, so we should add power and precision.
Take food, gear and consumables

00:04:04.489 --> 00:04:07.909
accordingly.
About the mechanics of the phase; they are heads

00:04:07.909 --> 00:04:11.620
that moves randomly, that you should
avoid going behind because they cripple and

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:13.699
damage you, and above all, getting lucky...

00:04:13.699 --> 00:04:16.810
So if you are successful, congratulations!!
If not... maybe next time...

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:20.199
Here ends the basic wurm guide,
we hope that you liked it and that at leasts

00:04:20.199 --> 00:04:22.910
it have cleared some doubts... Until
next time!!
