Stephanie: Hi everyone this is Stephanie Manley,
you know me from copycat.com but today I am

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:27.840
going through my old home economics book and
I'm teaching you how to cook just like I learned

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:28.840
how to cook.

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:30.460
Today we are going to cook carrots.

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:32.310
Now I love to cook carrots.

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:37.079
They are wonderful, they are inexpensive and
they are so easy to do.

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:41.640
We are going to show you how to make some
wonderful buttered carrots today.

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.870
The first thing that you need to do is go
ahead and use the peeler and get the skin

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:51.070
off of the carrot.

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:54.469
So I am going to go ahead and peel these up.

00:00:54.469 --> 00:01:04.479
So now it is time to cut the carrots and when
you cut carrots the first thing you want to

00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:07.800
do is you want to just nick off this end right
here.

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:14.320
We don't really use those bottom portions
where the roots actually come out of.

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:17.380
We just go ahead and cut this off.

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:22.259
Now if you have a sad carrot like I do here
you just go ahead and cut off the portion

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:26.189
that is a little lonky you don't really need
to use that part.

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:27.759
Just cut off the end.

00:01:27.759 --> 00:01:30.979
The next thing we are going to do is we are
going to chop up our carrots.

00:01:30.979 --> 00:01:38.270
Now I'm going to chop up mine in little round
pieces like this.

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:54.070
You want to do about a half inch slice or
a little bit smaller.

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:58.110
So when you are cutting your carrot you don't
want to actually use this end right here,

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:08.180
so what I do is I just cut 
until I get pretty close to the end and we

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:09.840
don't worry about that piece.

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:23.000
Next thing we need to do is just take all
of our carrots in a pot right here.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.210
We want to go ahead and add some salt, you
want add about a good teaspoon of salt to

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:28.210
these.

00:02:28.210 --> 00:02:36.060
You want to add enough water to cover the
carrots and then you want to add about a tablespoon

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:37.700
of butter to these.

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:41.650
The next thing we are going to do is we are
going to go over to our stove top and we are

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:47.650
going to cook these on a low to medium heat
for about 10 to 12 minutes until the carrots

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:48.650
are soft.

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:58.900
So let me show you what you need to do next.

00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:02.409
So we cooked our carrots for about 10 to 12
minutes so you can see that now I'm going

00:03:02.409 --> 00:03:08.120
to stick a fork in and they are nice and tender
and they are very easy to pierce that is the

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:09.510
sign that carrots are done.

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:19.260
So if you like go ahead and serve these up
for dinner, put them in a bowl and make it

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:22.080
all fancy.

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:25.849
here you go, you have buttered carrots and
that was really easy.

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:31.500
