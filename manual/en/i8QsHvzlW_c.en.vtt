00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:01.640
Hi, this is Joelle Meijer.

00:00:01.640 --> 00:00:07.759
I will show you how to make a 3D robot on
wheels.

00:00:07.759 --> 00:00:10.700
Print or photocopy the patterns that are in
the free document

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:14.790
onto thick coloured construction paper.

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.679
Cut out the two patterns with an x-acto knife
or scissors.

00:00:19.679 --> 00:00:23.869
The tabs are required to glue the prisms together.

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:26.769
Start by scoring the edges of the rectangular
prism

00:00:26.769 --> 00:00:31.240
with the tip of a scissor blade for example.

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:34.380
Scoring the edges will make folding easier.

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:40.790
Next, fold all edges of the rectangular prism.

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:43.489
With a pair of sharp scissors, make a small
hole

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:49.790
at the black dot that is printed on one side
of the rectangular prism.

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:52.769
Then glue all sides of the rectangular prism
together

00:00:52.769 --> 00:00:56.649
with the exception of the face with the hole.

00:00:56.649 --> 00:01:01.550
You can glue the prism together using white
glue or a glue gun.

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:05.129
Proceed the same way for the hexagonal prism.

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:10.979
So, first score all the edges with the tip
of a pair of scissors for example,

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:14.850
and then fold the edges of the prism.

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:19.890
Make a hole in the centre of one of the hexagonal
faces.

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:26.020
Glue each rectangular face one at a time to
the hexagons on either side.

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:29.860
Do not glue the last two rectangles so that
you will be able to access

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:32.470
the inside of the prism.

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:38.360
If like me you forgot to make the hole in
one of the hexagonal faces at the beginning,

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:41.210
you can still do it now!

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:45.250
Take a brass fastener and slip the pointy
part through the hole on the inside

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:50.079
of the hexagonal prism and then pass the pointy
part again through the hole

00:01:50.079 --> 00:01:54.590
on the outside of the rectangular prism.

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:56.820
Spread the legs of the brass fastener that
are now

00:01:56.820 --> 00:02:01.119
on the inside of the rectangular prism.

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:04.729
Start by gluing the last face of the rectangular
prism

00:02:04.729 --> 00:02:08.759
and then glue the last two faces of the hexagonal
prism.

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:14.489
At this stage, you have attached the robot's
head to the robot's body

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:18.370
and the head can turn relative to the body.

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:21.650
Now you can decorate the robot.

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:26.050
I chose to glue eyes and a mouth on the head.

00:02:26.050 --> 00:02:31.120
I will represent the ears with silver beads
glued on buttons.

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.230
I glue the ears on either side of the eyes.

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:40.400
I decided to put silver paper on the front
of the robot's body.

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:45.830
The silver paper can represent a solar panel
or a control panel.

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:48.540
If you have other buttons, you can also glue
some of them

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.270
to continue decorating the robot.

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:56.379
With a pin or other sharp object, make two
holes in the top of the head

00:02:56.379 --> 00:02:58.080
for the antennas.

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:03.590
Cut pieces of pipe cleaner with a length of
your choice.

00:03:03.590 --> 00:03:09.120
Put dots of glue and insert the pieces of
pipe cleaner into the holes.

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:12.960
Bend them in the direction you want.

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:16.970
If you wish, you can add arms to the robot.

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:22.360
I decided to use pieces of pipe cleaner as
I did for the antennas.

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:27.739
I could have used cardboard or pieces of plastic
straw too.

00:03:27.739 --> 00:03:30.810
Now let's choose some wheels.

00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.239
I collect lids of bottles and containers

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:37.439
and I will see if I can find 4 lids of the
same size and the same colour

00:03:37.439 --> 00:03:41.920
so I can use them as wheels for my robot.

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:44.010
I would have liked to use the orange lids

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:49.250
but unfortunately I only have 3 of the same
colour.

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:52.890
But I find that I have enough green lids.

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:57.239
I put hot glue on half of each lid and I glue
the wheels one by one

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:00.490
on the sides of the robot.

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:03.980
And now the robot has four wheels!

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:07.890
But I see that I actually have a fifth green
lid.

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:12.870
I will put it at the back of the robot as
a spare wheel!

00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:16.730
Collect all kinds of lids, corks, bread tags
and other small items and give them to

00:04:16.730 --> 00:04:20.270
children for craft activities.

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:22.290
You will find they will have fun using them
and

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:25.640
decorating their robot to make it unique.

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:30.170
