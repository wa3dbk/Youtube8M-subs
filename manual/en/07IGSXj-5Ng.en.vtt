Cheap Web Hosting 2016 - Alright in this video

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:12.459
what a web hosting account is why you need
it and how to get it all set up alright let's

00:00:12.459 --> 00:00:15.369
get started

00:00:15.369 --> 00:00:21.300
Okay a web hosting account is basically if
you had a business and you needed to rent

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:28.300
an office building, essentially this is renting
space on the online world and why you need

00:00:28.699 --> 00:00:34.030
it you could set up a free blogging account
at blogger.com but you're going to have some

00:00:34.030 --> 00:00:38.489
restrictions there are certain things you're
not going to be able to do, plus if Google

00:00:38.489 --> 00:00:44.690
ever decides to shut down their blogger.com
website you would lose all of your data all

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:49.129
of that hard work you put into it. Whereas
if you owned your own web hosting you have

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:54.199
complete control over it. You could advertise
on it, you could sell products and services.

00:00:54.199 --> 00:01:00.000
You could even flip the website if you decide
to sell it in the future for a profit. So

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.559
here is how we get started. You're going to
go to Hostgator.com or you can use my affiliate

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.880
link below this video and I also provided
a Hostgator Coupon code to get 25% off

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:12.740
which I will show you how to apply. So you're
going to click on this button called view

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:17.220
web hosting plans and it's going to bring
you to this page and this page is basically

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:22.180
explaining some different options that you
can use. Now, I'm going to recommend to you

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:27.350
the Baby Plan and the reason why is the hatchling
plan is great if you are going to only create

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.790
one website. But, trust me I have learned
through experience once you start learning

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:36.159
how to create these websites you're going
to want to create more than one. So a Baby

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:40.360
Plan is perfect because it says right here
"Unlimited Domains" so basically you have

00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:45.119
one web hosting account and you can create
more than one website on the same Hosting

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:51.060
Account. So we are going to go with Baby Plan
and you can pick different selection options

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:56.219
you can either go to a month to month program
or you can purchase six months one year or

00:01:56.219 --> 00:02:00.359
three year terms so you can basically pay
ahead of time. And obviously the longer the

00:02:00.359 --> 00:02:05.310
term the more money you will save. In this
case we are going to set you up with the 1

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:10.619
year plan and we are going to click order
now. So they are going to this order screen

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:14.540
and basically you already have a domain name
which we showed you how to purchase on GoDaddy.

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:19.120
So you're going to click on this button and
you're going to type in web address that you

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:26.120
had already purchased so in my case I am going
to type AnthonyTran.biz and then you're going

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.140
to go ahead and confirm that you have the
Baby Package and you can change the billing

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:38.140
cycle here if you wish. You're going to create
a username and create a pin and basically

00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:43.159
fill in you're billing information. Next you're
going to scroll down and they are already

00:02:43.159 --> 00:02:50.159
going to preset for you a purchase for a sight
lock and code guard which is a backup program,

00:02:51.269 --> 00:02:58.069
you can purchase these things however in this
case I'm going to give you the least expensive

00:02:58.069 --> 00:03:04.849
option so we are going to unclick those this
time. Now as you can see right here they already

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:10.769
preset a SNAPPY Hostgator coupon code which
gives you a total price of $95.52 but if you

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:17.769
use my Hostgator Promo Code "myaccesspass"
and click validate your price drops down to

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:25.540
$89.55 so basically it's a 25% off Hostgator
Coupon code so it's a great thing. Hostgator

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:35.610
also offers 24 hours a day, 7 days a week,
365 days worth of support you can call them,

00:03:35.689 --> 00:03:40.799
you can live chat with them, you can email
them, that's why I love about Hostgator because

00:03:40.799 --> 00:03:45.189
they have awesome customer service and it's
a very inexpensive way to first start off

00:03:45.189 --> 00:03:51.580
an online business. So you're going to click
I have read this and click create account.

00:03:51.580 --> 00:03:54.540
So great! Now that you have purchased your
Hosting Account you're going to get an email

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:58.310
that looks something like this. This is a
very important email and you should definitely

00:03:58.310 --> 00:04:04.209
save it somewhere. You're going to want to
save these login addresses as well. The first

00:04:04.209 --> 00:04:08.909
one is your billing system so if you ever
need to change how your billing system is

00:04:08.909 --> 00:04:14.150
you want to be able to access this link with
your username and password, and then you are

00:04:14.150 --> 00:04:19.390
also going to have your control panel login
screen which you also want to save and maybe

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:24.440
bookmark. So I am going to go ahead and click
on this and we will see you on the next screen.

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:28.350
So this is your control panel login screen.
You're going to enter your username and temporary

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:33.300
password that they provided. Okay when you
enter you're going to see a screen that looks

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:40.300
like this. And I am going to say No Thank
You. and Click No I'm Fine Thank you here.

00:04:41.490 --> 00:04:44.580
Next I want to show you how to change your
password. You're going to go to this section

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:51.580
called Preferences and click change password.
So go ahead and type in and you are going

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:56.650
to close this box and then go ahead and type
in your old password provided and you are

00:04:56.650 --> 00:05:03.650
going to type in a new one. And you are going
to click change your password now. So there

00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:09.770
you go your password has been changed. And
that's pretty much the end of this video tutorial

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:16.770
of how to setup your web hosting account.
