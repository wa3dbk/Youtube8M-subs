00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:23.078
There is a Name I love to hear,
I love to sing its worth

00:00:23.078 --> 00:00:32.709
It sounds like music in my ear,
the sweetest Name on earth.

00:00:32.708 --> 00:00:44.288
Oh, how I love Jesus,
oh, how I love Jesus

00:00:44.288 --> 00:00:54.799
Oh, how I love Jesus,
because He first loved me!

00:00:54.799 --> 00:01:05.421
It tells me of a Savior's love,
Who died to set me free

00:01:05.421 --> 00:01:15.839
It tells me of His precious blood,
the sinner's perfect plea.

00:01:15.839 --> 00:01:26.263
Oh, how I love Jesus,
oh, how I love Jesus

00:01:26.263 --> 00:01:36.709
Oh, how I love Jesus,
because He first loved me!

00:01:36.709 --> 00:01:57.605
Instrumental chorus

00:01:57.605 --> 00:02:08.019
It tells of One whose loving heart
can feel my deepest woe

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:17.929
Who in each sorrow bears a part
that none can bear below.

00:02:17.929 --> 00:02:29.405
Oh, how I love Jesus,
oh, how I love Jesus

00:02:29.405 --> 00:02:38.501
Oh, how I love Jesus,
because He first loved me -

00:02:38.501 --> 00:02:50.096
Oh, how I love Jesus,
oh, how I love Jesus

00:02:50.096 --> 00:03:03.777
Oh, how I love Jesus,
because He first loved me!
