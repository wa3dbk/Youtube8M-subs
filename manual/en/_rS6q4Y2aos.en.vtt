Hi. This is Bob Wolf again for Expert Village.com
with cowboy action shooting. We're going to

00:00:05.870 --> 00:00:09.519
talk a little bit about some of the guns we
use in the sport. Most of them are around

00:00:09.519 --> 00:00:14.519
the late 1800's. They need to be paired correct,
they can be originals or they can be replicas.

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:19.110
We have a small example of some of the guns
that we use here. I will just go over them

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:23.901
briefly for you. This is cap and ball type
revolver, some of you may be familiar with

00:00:23.901 --> 00:00:31.130
that. Next one we have a Remington, next we
have a pair of Rutgers in different configurations,

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:35.920
and these are thirty-twos. We have the old
standby street sweeper, the double-barreled

00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:43.539
shotgun, which has been cut-off, very popular
in the old west. This model 97 pump and this

00:00:43.539 --> 00:00:49.109
gun are still in use today. It was used back
in the 1800's and it is still in use today.

00:00:49.109 --> 00:00:55.780
This is a typical model 73 which is the one
affiliated with James Stewarts western Winchester

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:02.379
73. These are your birdie copies made in Italy.
This is a 66, same action only with a brass

00:01:02.379 --> 00:01:10.670
frame, based on the same John Browning design.
This is a model 92 Winchester, a little bit

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:17.050
different design on this one, a little lighter,
a little smaller gun. This is a Marlin, Marlin

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:21.630
goes way back to but this is a modern version
of a Marlin lever action rifle. These are

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:27.340
typical of some of the guns we use in cowboy
action shooting. There's a whole variety of

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:33.740
categories that you can shoot in, age based,
gun based and costume based also. So under

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:39.299
the cowboy action shooting umbrella, there's
all kinds of different ways you can play cowboy.

00:01:39.299 --> 00:01:44.450
Also, when we do the main matches, the calibers
that we use in these guns, our main match

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:54.179
caliber is 32 - 45. That covers a lot of different
bullet sizes, 32, 32, 20, 38, 44, 44 magnums,

00:01:54.179 --> 00:01:58.689
40, a lot of the cap and ball guns are used.
The guys really like that, they like to see

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:06.079
that flame shooting out the end of the barrel.
So these are typical of the guns we use and

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:10.599
there are pump action rifles and there?s a
lever action shotgun also. We don't have samples

00:02:10.599 --> 00:02:16.730
of this right here. But there is more and
more guns coming into play in our sport because

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:21.470
so many people are doing it. That the gun
manufacturers are responding and making more

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:25.180
and more period correct guns for us, which
gives us a lot more toys to play with.
