Hi! My name is Karl James owner of Creoesoul
catering in Round Rock, Texas on behalf of

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:12.740
Expert Village I'm here to show you a quick
easy spaghetti recipe. Okay now we are going

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:18.170
to work with our garlic and once again a good
way to peel garlic is to twist it and get

00:00:18.170 --> 00:00:28.029
a little pop there and then the skin would
peel right off. Let's see and lets try something

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:33.000
else I smash my garlic a lot of time before
I chop it anyways but I have always been told

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.399
if you take with the skin on and just hit
it that is another way to get the skin off

00:00:39.399 --> 00:00:54.530
really easy. I didn't seem that easy I like
my method better but there it comes. Take

00:00:54.530 --> 00:01:05.299
that part off. Anyway like I said I smash
my garlic, give a little smash or if you have

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:12.700
some gadgets you can just put it in a small
chopper and chop your garlic up. Of course

00:01:12.700 --> 00:01:19.280
you can do your onions like that, you can
do your bell pepper, I wouldn't suggest tomato

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:26.810
unless you want your tomato puree more then
chopped. But we would chop our garlic up give

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:36.930
a nice and edible and in spaghetti many times
or in any dish a lot of times it is not a

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:43.259
pleasant thing to just come across a big chunk
of garlic as your eating unless your like

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:54.570
me and you like garlic you look forward to
that. Anyway we can chop our garlic, garlic

00:01:54.570 --> 00:02:08.880
I love it. A friend and I where traveling
together and came across a place that serves

00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:19.780
this garlic cloves amazing we have been looking
forward every since but we where over seas.

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:28.720
Anyway here is our garlic and we would add
that to our onions and set it aside as we

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.000
continue to build our ingredients and our
base for our sauce.
