00:00:02.360 --> 00:00:06.569
Sometimes your watch band clasp will wear
out before your watch band does.

00:00:06.569 --> 00:00:10.790
If you don�t want to replace your whole
watch band you can always just replace the

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:13.089
clasp itself.

00:00:13.089 --> 00:00:19.600
Use this guide from Esslinger-dot-com to learn
how to change a basic tri-fold watchband clasp.

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:22.920
How do you know if your watch clasp is a basic
tri-fold clasp?

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:27.200
When the clasp is open there will be three
metal plates and two joints.

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:31.591
When it is closed the two lower plates will
fold under the clasp that matches the watch

00:00:31.591 --> 00:00:33.430
band style.

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:37.120
To replace your tri-fold clasp, you will need:
A spring bar tool

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:40.300
A ballpeen hammer
A pin pusher

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.760
A watchband holder
A digital gauge

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.710
A parts tray
An extra friction pin

00:00:47.710 --> 00:00:51.890
And a replacement tri-fold clasp

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:55.030
The first thing to do will be to remove the
old clasp.

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:59.460
Place the watch band in the watchband holder
and use your pin pusher and ballpeen hammer

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.199
to tap the friction pin out.

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:09.110
The friction pin will be on the split end
of the clasp, like this.

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:13.340
Once the pin is free from the watchband, set
it aside in your parts tray.

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:16.390
You may need to use a pliers to pull the pin
out of the clasp.

00:01:16.390 --> 00:01:20.780
Next, we will remove the other side of the
clasp from the band.

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:25.090
The tip of the spring bar will be visible
on the outside of the clasp.

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:30.020
Take your spring bar tool, using the pointed
end, push down on the spring bar to compress

00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:31.020
it.

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.939
Then angle your spring bar tool to slide the
watch band and compressed spring bar out of

00:01:34.939 --> 00:01:36.700
the clasp.

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.790
Set it in your parts tray.

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:45.580
Next, use the old clasp to measure the dimensions
needed for the new one.

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:51.869
Start by measuring the outside width of the
split end of the clasp with your digital gauge.

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:57.439
Then, measure the inside of the clasp that
fits over the watch band.

00:01:57.439 --> 00:02:00.810
Use the inside opening jaws of the gauge to
find this measurement.

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.159
It should be about one millimeter smaller
than your first measurement.

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:09.149
Once you have these numbers in hand,
order the corresponding size and color replacement

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:14.150
watch band clasp from Esslinger.com.

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:18.070
When you have the new clasp in hand, you will
want to start by attaching the cover end of

00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:21.110
the clasp to the watch band first.

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:25.370
Take your spring bar and insert it back into
the end that you removed it from earlier.

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:29.910
Holding the watch band with the spring bar
inserted, slip the band inside the clasp.

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:35.120
Align one end of the spring bar with the corresponding
hole in the bottom of the clasp.

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:39.480
Take your spring bar tool and use the forked
end to press the spring bar down into the

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:40.480
watch band.

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.569
Slide it completely into the watch clasp.

00:02:42.569 --> 00:02:46.819
Wiggle the watch band around until the spring
bar clicks into place.

00:02:46.819 --> 00:02:50.980
You can now attach the other end of the clasp
to the band.

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:57.270
Take the two loose ends and hold them together
so the corresponding holes line up, like this.

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:00.629
Insert your friction pin part of the way into
the clasp and band.

00:03:00.629 --> 00:03:04.660
Carefully place the clasp in the watchband
holder to keep it steady while you insert

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:08.780
the friction pin into the clasp completely.

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:12.780
Make sure that the pin is not lined up with
a hole in the holder so you don�t accidently

00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.140
push the pin out the other side.

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:18.959
Tap gently on the end of the pin with your
ballpeen hammer.

00:03:18.959 --> 00:03:22.580
Gradually increase the pressure until the
end pins are flush with the outside of the

00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:23.580
clasp.

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:29.190
To avoid scratching your new clasp, use your
pin pusher to finish inserting the pin.

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:32.930
When both sides of the pin are flush with
the watch clasp again, you can remove the

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:36.910
watch band from the holder and wear it again
with pride.

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:41.430
