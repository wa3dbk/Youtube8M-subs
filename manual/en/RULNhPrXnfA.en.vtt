"Hi, my name is Marcus Milius. I play harmonica.
I got a degree at the University of Southern

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:15.030
California, a Bachelor's of Music, in Jazz
Studies - Chromatic Harmonica. I play and

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:23.721
teach harmonica here in New York City, and
I'm happy to show you what I do.

00:00:23.721 --> 00:00:30.199
Alright, playing in different keys, on the
diatonic harmonica, easiest solution to that

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:36.080
is simply owning all your different harmonicas.
Each diatonic harmonica is set up in one key,

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:41.180
so you need to buy 12 different harmonicas
in different keys to play in all the different

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:45.470
keys. When you are in the key of A, pick up
you're a harmonica, when you are in the key

00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:51.670
of F pick up your F harmonica etc. On the
chromatic harmonica, playing in different

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:56.540
keys becomes a little more complicated. You
actually have to learn a new pattern for each

00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:10.000
key. So if I learned a song in the key of
A, [Music], I have to learn a completely different

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:18.939
pattern to play in the key of C. [Music].
So you'd notice I wasn't pressing the slide,

00:01:18.939 --> 00:01:23.530
when I was in the key of C, but I was for
A. You can also play in different keys on

00:01:23.530 --> 00:01:32.460
the same diatonic harmonica. So we have a
C harmonica here. In the key of C first position,

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:40.351
you would want to play mostly blow notes resolving
to one blow, four blow or seven blow. That

00:01:40.351 --> 00:01:44.881
will be your tonic. If you wanted to play
in a different key, you might play in second

00:01:44.881 --> 00:01:50.830
position. Although positions are five notes
away, so if you are on a C harmonica, first

00:01:50.830 --> 00:02:05.450
position is C, five up from that C D E F G.
[Music]. You could also play in third position.

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:10.920
Third position will be five notes away from
second position. Second position was G on

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:24.440
the C harmonica, so that is G A B C D, is
your third position. [Music].

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.500
So it takes a little more work to play in
all the different keys or positions on the

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:33.390
same harmonica and diatonic harmonica. So
you but wanna (want to) think about investing

00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:39.790
in all the other key harmonicas. Playing your
chromatic harmonica, all the notes are there

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:45.590
so, playing in the different keys, you simply
have to learn the notes and learn all your

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:59.430
keys, all your scales. [Music]. And there
are 12 keys and each one is different and

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:04.910
you just have to learn the scales and then
you'll be able to play in all 12 keys.

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:05.910
