00:00:07.340 --> 00:00:08.000
Hi, how are you?

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
today we take the wheel of Dirt 2

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.090
It's an old game, with no native Rift support

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:16.890
but we have Vireio for the 3D mode

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.480
and OpenTrack to simulate head movements

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:22.720
because Dirt 2 natively supports TrackIR

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:24.259
Let's see how I drive!

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:31.229
You're going to see how badly I can drive

00:00:31.229 --> 00:00:33.270
I love using manual gears

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.350
and clutch with H-gears

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:39.000
so a big disaster may be coming here

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.050
I'll try not to make a fool of myself

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:46.300
because I'm not good at all with racing games

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:51.040
First of all, the feeling of being inside a car cockpit is superb

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:53.770
Even though it's not native support

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:55.560
I'm using Vireio

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:58.010
and this new version has a better 3D effect

00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:01.350
It's not like it was before

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.930
It wasn't able to send both images

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.110
of left and right eye at the same time

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.680
It sent them one after another, alternating frames

00:01:10.680 --> 00:01:13.510
It did it very fast

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:16.850
And it was a problem for more sensitive people

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:20.500
But now it works as a native game

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.130
And I must recognice that it does

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:27.510
extremely well. Also the default 3D settings work very well for me

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:32.240
I didn't have to change anything, I feel comfortable with these settings

00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:35.820
The only problem is that I'm pretty bad as you can see

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.440
The head movement sensation is

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:43.520
incredible as usual

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.420
I feel that I am

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:48.190
in a rally car, at full throttle

00:01:48.190 --> 00:01:50.190
racing

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:56.190
I hope I can get to the asphalt soon

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:09.300
After some many years with the wheel, I'm still a bad pilot

00:02:09.669 --> 00:02:10.969
But I love racing

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:17.109
And with the Oculus Rift I've rediscovered both this game and the wheel

00:02:18.969 --> 00:02:20.609
It's crazy

00:02:20.609 --> 00:02:27.609
Here's the asphalt, I hope I can drive better here

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:30.969
Sometimes instead of 4th gear I put 6th

00:02:30.969 --> 00:02:32.679
and the car slows down

00:02:32.679 --> 00:02:34.979
but it's still awesome

00:02:34.979 --> 00:02:37.000
Wow this guy was less luckier than me!

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.659
The good news is that I'm not finishing last

00:02:43.849 --> 00:02:48.000
You can see that the pilot hands are shaking

00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:51.399
However the wheel is responding perfectly

00:02:51.399 --> 00:02:53.619
Now inside the village

00:02:53.619 --> 00:02:58.589
The feeling of being so close to the houses is incredible

00:02:58.589 --> 00:03:01.129
You can see the people leaning in

00:03:01.129 --> 00:03:02.989
I almost could hit them

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:06.539
I will probably hit them

00:03:06.539 --> 00:03:13.539
I got stuck here, pretty bad driving

00:03:17.189 --> 00:03:19.769
The game feels incredible

00:03:19.769 --> 00:03:25.179
Dirt series has always been very arcadish but very spectacular

00:03:25.179 --> 00:03:29.059
and with the Oculus Rift it's even better

00:03:29.059 --> 00:03:31.349
I hope my friend Franky from our forum is watching this

00:03:31.349 --> 00:03:33.709
and he can come again to my house

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:36.029
He's going to love this game

00:03:36.029 --> 00:03:38.799
even though he loves real car simulators

00:03:38.799 --> 00:03:39.889
Ok let's see

00:03:39.889 --> 00:03:45.839
my pathetic position

00:03:45.839 --> 00:03:47.829
I'll take out the Oculus

00:03:47.829 --> 00:03:50.449
Sixth position! It could have been worse

00:03:53.449 --> 00:03:54.349
So

00:03:54.349 --> 00:03:59.029
that was Dirt 2, it was terrific even without native support

00:03:59.029 --> 00:04:00.469
but Vireio and OpenTrack

00:04:00.469 --> 00:04:01.659
work perfectly here

00:04:01.659 --> 00:04:03.729
I hope you liked it and please

00:04:03.729 --> 00:04:05.019
Don't mock on my driving!

00:04:05.019 --> 00:04:07.019
See you soon
