The Reichstag building is a historical edifice
in Berlin, Germany, constructed to house the

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:17.690
Imperial Diet, of the German Empire. This
imposing building houses the Federal German

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:23.150
Parliament or "Bundestag" and was originally
completed in 1894 to meet the need of the

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:28.940
newly-unified German Empire of the Kaisers'
for a larger parliamentary building. The Reichstag

00:00:28.940 --> 00:00:34.530
was intended to resemble a Renaissance palace,
and its architect, Paul Wallot, dedicated

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:37.550
the building to the German people.

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:41.699
The Nazi leader Adolf Hitler exploited the
fire which gutted the Reichstag building in

00:00:41.699 --> 00:00:47.859
1933 by blaming the Communists for the arson
and for attempted revolution. There is good

00:00:47.859 --> 00:00:52.850
evidence to suggest, however, that his followers
were actually responsible and that this was

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:59.199
a manufactured crisis. When German reunification
became a reality, the new republic was proclaimed

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:03.729
here at midnight on the 2nd October 1990.

00:01:03.729 --> 00:01:09.080
The Reichstag has undergone considerable restoration
and alteration. The building is now the second

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:14.040
most visited attraction in Germany (after
the Cologne Cathedral), not least because

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.690
the addition of a spectacular glass dome designed
by the British architect Norman Foster. The

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:24.970
large glass dome at the very top of the Reichstag
has a 360-degree view of the surrounding Berlin

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:30.490
cityscape. The main hall of the parliament
below can also be seen from inside the dome,

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:35.820
and natural light from above radiates down
to the parliament floor.

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:39.680
The Reichstag building is well known in the
art world thanks to Paris-based Bulgarian

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:45.830
artist Christo's mammoth 'Wrapped Reichstag'
project in 1995. The entire building was swathed

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:51.040
in silver cloth for two weeks that summer.
You can visit the dome for free but you will

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:54.000
need to register online in advance in order
to do so.
