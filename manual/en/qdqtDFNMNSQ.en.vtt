00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
In this ikologee.com video I show you how to make an artisan necklace from a washer and a bangle.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:18.000
For this project you will need 1 1/2  metal bangles, two small beads, 26 gauge wire, and a metal washer.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Take the uncut bangle, cut in half.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Use your needlepoint pliers to make a loop...

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.000
at both ends...

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
of both halfs.

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.000
Cut one of the halves in half again.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:10.000
For safety always cut your metal bangles inside a plastic bag - and/or wear protective goggles. 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:27.000
A note about loop making:  - when making the loops - push the bangle around the pliers with your thumb - instead of trying to turn the heavy metal of the bangle with the pliers.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Take one of the short looped pieces to work with...

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:46.000
and feed a small bead onto some wire (the bead should be able to fit inside the loop) then...

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000
thread the wire through the loop and back through the bead.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:02:00.000
Push the bead down the now doubled wire. 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:11.000
Use pliers to pull the wire taut as you push the bead down the wire... 

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:28.000
and position it in the center of the loop. Snip off the excess wire so that you have a single wire for wrapping as opposed to the doubled wire you had before.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:37.000
Wrap the wire around the loop a couple of times pulling the wire taut with pliers as you go.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000
Snip of the excess wire at the crease of the looped piece...

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:58.000
and use a butter knife or something flat to tuck any excess wire into the crease and you will do this for both looped pieces.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:07.000
You should feel no rough/sharp ends when running your finger over the pieces.

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:16.000
So, this is the design we are making - clean lines with a contemporary grecian feel.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:25.000
Take the long looped piece...

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:34.000
and one of the short looped pieces and thread some wire between the loop and the bead.  

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:44.000
and attach one of the looped halves to it by wrapping with wire a few times...

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:55.000
Use pliers to pull wire taut as you wrap.

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:04.000
Be sure to snip off and tuck any wire ends neatly in the gap between the bead and the loop.

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:13.000
Once again, you should feel no sharp or rough ends when running your finger over and around it.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.000
Then do the same for the other short piece.

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:34.000
You should have something that resembles this.

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000
Wrap the ends to secure pieces as shown here.

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.000
Now we need to attach the the washer.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000
Take a piece of bangle aprrox 3"

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.000
Loop one end with needlepoint pliers...

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.000
then measure your washer as shown here...

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:18.000
starting under the loop mark a space for that washer measurement.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.000
Make a loop on the remaining end and bend at the point you placed a mark for the washer.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:40.000
Before inserting the washer on this hook, you will need to cut a piece off the last loop you made...

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.000
so that the washer wiill hang straight when you assemble it.

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:59.000
Then add whatever type of chain be it bead, cord or metal that you wish and you have a really pretty, easily made necklace.  Its not over elaborate and has a real artisan look to it.
