00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:21.280
tap to get good coverage.

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:36.160
add black lines to create the soccer. it's important that the child 
 closes his eyes until the paint is dry to avoid smudges

00:01:05.225 --> 00:01:07.225
add loose eyeshadow on a wet brush for the sky. avoid the other eyelid.

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:36.520
add a color for the face of the player. 
 the player is "looking" at the ball

00:02:01.231 --> 00:02:03.230
with a rake brush add the grass, for texture

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.720
now outline the player in order to locate the body.

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.520
you can add a number or a name on the drawn shirt.

00:02:51.479 --> 00:02:53.480
add clothes for the player, in colors to the child's preferances

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.760
locate the player as if he's kicking the ball drawn on the eyelid.

00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:06.600
you can add details to the shoes as well

00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:09.720
if you're not happy with the coverage of the 
 loose eyeshadow you can add a second layer.
