00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:07.229
 

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.250
I'm Mike Hanley with cars dot com

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:13.549
let's get one thing outta the way we
know the four-wheel-drive

00:00:13.549 --> 00:00:17.050
Infiniti QX 56 gets twelve miles per
gallon in the city

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:20.189
and 70 miles per gallon on the highway
with the four-wheel-drive version

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:23.529
but if you're watching this video that's
probably not high on your priority list

00:00:23.529 --> 00:00:27.640
what might be on your list is power in
luxury and in that regard

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.029
this vehicle holds up pretty well but
when you turn to things like

00:00:31.029 --> 00:00:34.110
interior luxury doesn't ring quite so I
for

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:39.620
like other full-size luxury SUV is like
the Cadillac Escalade in Lincoln

00:00:39.620 --> 00:00:40.300
Navigator

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.670
the QX 56 has a big bold chrome girl

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:47.600
and that really helps the finest
exterior look I need side the girl has

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.400
standards enough high-intensity
discharge headlights

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:54.329
as you move around to the side you see
the standard 20-inch chrome wheels

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:58.120
is he going further back you can see
it's interesting

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:01.870
rear doors which have a unique design
kinda looks like a sale

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:05.030
when you open a little bit and the color
here

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:08.110
is called lakeshore slate its new for
2008

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:15.110
and is coming in it as well all QX 56 is
that standard v8 power

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.370
its engine this place is 5.6 leaders and
makes 320 horsepower and commuter 93

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:22.600
pounds hit a torque

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.170
and even though this SUV weighs nearly
three times

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:29.799
the engine offer strong response and I
scrawl when you accelerate

00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:33.659
gas mileage is in line with an Escalade
czar navigators

00:01:33.659 --> 00:01:37.060
and if they're the only recommends
regular gas which may help takes a

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:38.470
listing of at the gas pump

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:45.280
if it is restyled the interior the QX
for 2008 make a more luxurious than it

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:46.110
was before

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:49.600
now these changes are step in the right
direction but it doesn't rival the

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.710
escalating terms that luxury feel

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:55.220
par that may be due to our test models
all gray interior which looks a little

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:58.740
bland so you may want to check out some
the other interior colors offered

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.070
now does feature some nice materials
though like real wood aluminum trim that

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:05.280
looks nice and the front seats are
comfortable

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.519
but also the standard navigation system
that's easy to use

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:12.560
and a backup camera that's helpful one
putting this big vehicle in reverse

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:17.639
procures 26 is available with a number
power features

00:02:17.639 --> 00:02:21.249
as power folding side mir's powered a
small puddles

00:02:21.249 --> 00:02:24.889
power operate liftgate which can be
operated by the key fob

00:02:24.889 --> 00:02:27.980
and power folding third row seat

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:31.620
power when that third row seat

00:02:31.620 --> 00:02:35.719
is up in use which gives the QX 56
seating for up to eight

00:02:35.719 --> 00:02:39.819
there's not much car room behind it so
you can see here

00:02:39.819 --> 00:02:45.279
this is the medium sized bag it fits in
here there's not much room left over so

00:02:45.279 --> 00:02:50.269
all as a people may not be able to bring
all the luggage they won about myself

00:02:50.269 --> 00:02:54.359
liking the QX 56 more than I thought I
would thanks to its easy drivability and

00:02:54.359 --> 00:02:58.359
strong drivetrain in a few more
interested in a luxury cabin

00:02:58.359 --> 00:03:02.450
the QX 56 might leave a little
disappointed especially when it starts

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:07.849
at more than 53,000 out for additional
information on this car or any other

00:03:07.849 --> 00:03:10.669
got a car start com on our blog kicking
tires
