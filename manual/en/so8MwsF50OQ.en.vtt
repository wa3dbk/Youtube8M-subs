00:00:13.424 --> 00:00:17.124
Six years have passed since the First War between man and orc...

00:00:19.395 --> 00:00:25.835
The once might army of Azeroth lay among the blackend and charred remains of Stormwind Keep.

00:00:26.041 --> 00:00:33.735
Those that escaped fled across the great sea bringing tales of the suffering they had faced at the hands of the Orcish Hordes.

00:00:45.132 --> 00:00:52.773
Eager to engage in battle once again, the orcs constructed ships of war to bear them across the Great Sea.

00:01:04.362 --> 00:01:12.928
The Orcish warriors yearned for the sounds of battle to fill the air and looked to the far horizon for new blood to spill.

00:01:16.367 --> 00:01:22.584
Using the weapons forged by their new allies, the humans made haste to prepare for the onslaught.

00:01:24.071 --> 00:01:30.768
While Dwarven cannon were being loaded, others armed themselves with Elven steel and mail.

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:58.058
Now, united in arms with new allies against a common foe, Mankind stands at the shores of destiny and awaits the coming of The Tides of Darkness.
