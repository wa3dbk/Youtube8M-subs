00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:25.140
Hello and welcome back to FitFoods,

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.480
the show that takes nutrition and taste,
combines them together

00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:33.260
to show you how to make a quick and effective meal 
that will help you support your fitness goals.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:38.260
I'm Rob Riches and on today's show I'll be making a great tasting, high protein nighttime snack

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.580
that's ideal for eating before bed and will supply your body with those essential amino acids

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:47.160
that it requires to promote 
muscle recovery long into the night. 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:48.980
 Let's get started.

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:53.780
The first thing I'm going to add into the blender here
is a handful of raw almond nuts.

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:55.440
About 10 or 12. 

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:59.080
Great source of fats in there, 
and a little bit of protein.

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:03.780
And the reason we're adding those in... 
it will help give us a little bit more consistency 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:07.460
and bite into our nighttime meal 
that's going to go into this bowl here.

00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:09.300
Let's blend these nuts.

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:23.593
As you can see, it's not finely ground like flour, 
we still got a few pieces of almonds in there.

00:01:23.593 --> 00:01:25.693
Perfect, something to bite in to. 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:29.380
Next thing that goes in, 
I'm going to use cottage cheese.

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:35.580
This is a great source of caseinate protein, which is slower releasing than our usual whey protein we have.

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:41.040
Basically, it provides the body with 
up to 7 hours of protein release.

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.140
I'm putting the equivalent of a cup full in.

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:50.120
This particular cottage cheese is low-fat,
 2% milk fat.

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:54.460
Best option to go for.

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.860
And now we're just going to add the rest of 
the ingredients, before mixing it again.

00:01:58.980 --> 00:01:59.960
Next thing,

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:01.560
peanut butter.

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:04.680
Now, take a tablespoon and...

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:07.940
I point out here: a lot of people 
are concerned when they get this...

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:10.740
...oil on the top, they normally drain out.

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.800
This is good fats that we get from the peanut butter, so I'm going to pour a little bit of that in.

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:16.920
About a teaspoon worth there.

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:19.180
And take a big healthy...

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.080
serving of that tablespoon there.

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.300
Dump that in. 

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:28.420
The reason I'm adding quite a bit of fats into this, as you've seen with the nuts and the peanut butter here,  

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:35.000
is that fats, along with that protein that we're getting mainly from the casein here, in the cottage cheese,

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.880
will help slow the release of those amino acids 
into our bloodstream.

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:45.980
So we're taking a meal that normally might give us 3 to 4 hours worth of protein digestion and absorption,

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:49.880
and we're now extending that up to 
somewhere in the region of 7 hours.

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:55.380
Perfect for nighttime, and therefore, when you wake up, your body is still in that positive nitrogen balance,

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:58.100
meaning that the body hasn't started to break down the muscle, 

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:00.920
it needs to get those essential amino acids,

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:04.120
so we're always going back 
to those essential amino acids.

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:05.140
Next up.

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.360
I'm going to take some raw almond milk.

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:13.960
And I'm going to use... 
this is a third of a cup, about 80 ml,

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:16.680
and just pour that in.

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:22.140
This is an optional extra, you don't need this, 
but I just like to add...

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:27.620
...add the taste in it to help that consistency as well, 
so it doesn't come out too stodgy.

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:31.780
Ok, this is the real protein kick in here.

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:36.680
I'm going to add a scoop of this 
ProEffect 100% Whey.

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:38.008
This is vanilla flavour.

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:42.486
I find vanilla or chocolate flavour 
really work best with this.

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:47.460
So this will give us that immediate 
high biological value protein  

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:52.400
that will get into our body very quickly and give us 
at least 2 to 3 hours worth of protein absorption, 

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:57.900
and then the casein along with the fats 
will continue for further 3 hours after,

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:59.900
which is why this is best eaten at night. 

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:01.320
One more thing. 

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:03.700
Add a bit of pumpkin spice.

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:07.000
Cinnamon, nutmeg, pumpkin spice, 
they all work well.

00:04:07.780 --> 00:04:14.220
Just don't go too nuts on adding it, because 
some of them, especially the nutmeg, 

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:18.420
can actually give you hallucinogenic effects, so... 
we don't want that at night,

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:22.200
limit it to no more than a couple of sprinkles or, 
at most, half of a teaspoon.

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:26.100
Now we just need to turn the blender on 
and mix everything together.

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:33.280
So you can see just how easy this is to make

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:37.840
And I'll start to pour it out now using a spatula,

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:40.580
we get this lovely thick creamy...

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:43.680
almost like a milkshake,

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.360
but I'm going to put this into the bowl,

00:04:47.140 --> 00:04:49.300
keep it in the fridge for about 10-15 minutes,

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:53.300
this will start to get a little bit firmer, 
and then we can bring it out and

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:55.720
pretty much eat it like a dessert.

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:58.940
This is why I call it my nighttime protein dessert.

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:06.780
I'll add my spoon in there, 
ready to dive into it later.

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:09.500
So, here it is, this is a vanilla... 

00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:14.660
using the almond milk, ProEffect whey, 
a tablespoon of peanut butter, 

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:19.600
one cup of cottage cheese, 
this is a 2% milk fat,

00:05:20.060 --> 00:05:24.320
and a sprinkle of pumpkin spice, 
along with our ground almonds.

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.620
It's tastes amazing at nighttime, 
and really helps support 

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:30.940
and promote muscle recovery and growth 
long into the night.

00:05:30.940 --> 00:05:34.320
So this goes in the fridge, 
and I'll be sure to enjoy this later tonight.

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:36.760
