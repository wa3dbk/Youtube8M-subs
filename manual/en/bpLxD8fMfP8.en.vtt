00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:09.170
Okay, we are going to talk about how to remove
and remount your bicycle wheels.

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:10.920
This is a road bike.

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:15.750
Most road bikes have caliper brakes, which
are going to have a quick release; usually

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:19.600
like this, which basically is going to open
up your brake caliper which is going to get

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:23.000
the tire out of the actual brake calipers.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.670
So you twist that to the top.

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:32.660
This is a quick release lever so basically
all you are going to do is get your fingers

00:00:32.660 --> 00:00:41.559
behind it, pull it down and then unscrew it
slightly and your wheel just falls right out.

00:00:41.559 --> 00:00:45.420
Then to remount the front wheel, what you
are going to do is have the lever all the

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.510
way up so that you are not going to hit your
brake pads.

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.100
Have your quick release open enough so it
can get over the little tabs that are on the

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.649
bottom here.

00:00:55.649 --> 00:00:59.079
Pull it straight up and through.

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:06.420
Then you are going to screw down the quick
release; not too tight because it is a lever

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:12.310
system so basically it is going to push down
and cinch on it by itself.

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:14.390
Just get that feel.

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:18.690
This is a little bit too tight; see I cannot
push it easily so I am going to unscrew it

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:21.659
slightly.

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:26.130
That is just way too easy, that is really
dangerous because it can flop open at any

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:27.130
time.

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:28.960
So just right in the middle of those two.

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:31.710
It is better to have it a little bit tight
just to be safe.

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:35.369
Also, you are going to make sure that when
you pull it up straight that it is sitting

00:01:35.369 --> 00:01:41.570
straight in the fork so basically you can
see the line from where the bolt is on the

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:42.570
brakes.

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:43.570
Make sure this is really straight.

00:01:43.570 --> 00:01:47.479
You do not want to have it sideways like that
or on the other side sideways because then

00:01:47.479 --> 00:01:49.086
it is not going to sit properly and also it
is not going to ride properly.

00:01:49.086 --> 00:01:52.520
So make sure you cinch that closed.

00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:54.980
You do not want to do what a lot of people
do with quick releases; a lot of people just

00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:58.479
spin them all the way down and they do not
actually close them and they think that is

00:01:58.479 --> 00:01:59.600
secure.

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:04.090
Really what you need to do is you need to
push that lever all the way down and make

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.180
sure that it is nice and secure.

00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:11.410
Then after you are done with that make sure
that you put the quick release for your brake

00:02:11.410 --> 00:02:16.100
back down so you are not going to be riding
along and have a very loose brake.

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:17.240
Double check it.

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:18.800
Make sure that it is stopping properly.

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.300
Make sure that it is in there real nice, straight
and secure.
