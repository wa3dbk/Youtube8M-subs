00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:10.639
It used to be common to have a new dance craze every year.

00:00:10.639 --> 00:00:15.630
They were new. They had catchy names, funny steps and some stack around for a while.

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:21.009
Since the Renaissance, European monarchs hosted many dance fads that became social crazes.

00:00:21.009 --> 00:00:25.020
The minuet, the mazurka and the waltz are
in this long list. However, it was in the

00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:28.600
20th century that these dance crazes reached the peak of their popularity.

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.910
One could say that "The Charleston" was the
mother of all dance crazes.

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.270
Believed to be born in the American harbor
city of the same name, "The Charleston" has

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:48.000
many variations. Solo, with a partner, quick and slow. Here we go:

00:01:07.009 --> 00:01:12.380
Popularized in 1920's, we believe that it
takes its name from famous vaudeville actor

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:18.050
Harry Fox, but the dance itself was created
by African American dancers a decade before that.

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:21.330
The "Fox Trot" looks similar to a waltz, 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.700
but it has a different tempo. Let's see:

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:42.200
From Fox to Fox, this dance became a huge trend in Paris in 1936. 

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:47.130
The French celebrated New Year's Eve with a "Hot Fox". It looks like a Charleston with some variations, 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:52.400
but it was described as faster, crazier and hotter. However, it didn't last too long.

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:09.530
An old English Tune modernized by the Americans. 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:15.450
The original song dates to the seventeenth century and it is believed that it was already a dance. 

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.570
Later, in the late 1930s, it was orchestrated and choreographed for ballroom dancing. 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.580
As opposed to the previous dances,                           created closer to the 20s,

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:27.680
"The Chestnut Tree" was a very innocent dance and it didn't have any sensuality.

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:32.300
Many would say, “What's the point then?”,
but the truth is that it became very popular.

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:43.700
Now, this was another very popular Party Dance.
It used to be hugely successful in the UK

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:48.569
and in many countries of the Commonwealth.
Listening to the lyrics of its tune tells

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:52.591
us a lot about the social values of the early
40s. Pay attention:

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:56.780
While the band is playing

00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:00.720
to a waltz we will say

00:03:02.719 --> 00:03:05.499
Then you'll see us strut along down

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:07.300
Swinging our Blues away.

00:03:07.959 --> 00:03:09.299
And if we should quarrel

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.960
We'll make up and understand

00:03:13.859 --> 00:03:15.719
Strolling in the Park Parade

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:17.620
Yip-pee, ain't love grand.

00:03:18.209 --> 00:03:23.699
American soldiers brought the "Lindy Hop" to
Europe in 1942, but English dance instructors

00:03:23.699 --> 00:03:29.449
and ballroom gurus found it foreign and vulgar.
So they developed an elegant version of it,

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:34.529
called “The Jive”. It became a World Wide
phenomenon and in 1968 it was adopted as the

00:03:34.529 --> 00:03:38.329
5th Latin dance in international competitions.

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:48.640
And we get to the 60s.

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:53.080
Since the 20s the World hadn't seen such popularity of dance crazes.

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:56.839
There used to be a new dance craze
every week, with songs like "The locomotion"

00:03:56.839 --> 00:04:01.829
and "The Mashed Potato" hitting hard. This one,
the "Golly Golly" was particularly popular in

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:04.279
London clubs in 1962.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.960
In the mid 60s, a dance called                                     “The Shake” became the new trend. 

00:04:23.620 --> 00:04:27.460
Easy to describe, the dancer shakes the body until the tune stops. Nothing more.

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.860
It might sound dull, but “The shake” transcended

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:33.150
the dance craze of the summer category 

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:36.800
and it became a standard move in many dances still danced today.

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:40.960
Did you think this was vintage or old fashioned?

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:45.380
Think of "The Macarena", "Saturday Night", "The Shuffle" or "Gangnam Style". 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:47.400
Not so long ago, was it?
