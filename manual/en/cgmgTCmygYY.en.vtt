00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:11.840
Right now you are looking at
the Garmin Nuvi 205 GPS.

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:16.790
Now, this thing is for beginners.
If you are lost when it comes to GPS'

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:19.880
you can't figure out which one 
is for you, this could be it.

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:22.560
It's very very easy to use.
Now look at this thing.

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:26.960
It's very thin and it's very portable,
so you can take it with you anywhere you go.

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:28.960
It's easily mountable 
to your windshield,

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:30.930
and it's only got a couple switches. 

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:33.270
Right here you'll see this 
is your power on and off,

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:34.740
and also your lock.

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:37.340
On the back you've 
got your USB Port.

00:00:37.940 --> 00:00:39.940
And on the side you
have your power.

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:42.380
So, you know, not too 
complicated at all.

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:44.780
Now, right now we are 
on the home screen,

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:47.850
but it's important to 
note that this Garmin 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.020
has a five hour battery life.
Which is great.

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:52.750
You don't have to keep it 
plugged in all the time.

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:55.550
Not to mention, it comes 
with a one-year warrantee.

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:59.760
So, lets get right to it. Right here you see
the big magnifying that says, Where to?

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:02.900
We're going to start right there.
Move this box out of my way.

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:07.700
Where to? Okay. 
So, you can search by address,

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:09.970
you can search by 
point of interest,

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:12.780
or you can go home. So, 
address is pretty simple,

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:17.310
we'll just go in here, and when you 
do a Spell City a keypad pops up,

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:19.880
and you can type in your city,
it's really really easy.

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:21.910
We'll go back,

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:25.480
back again, 
back again,

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:27.220
Right here, points of interest. 
 

00:01:27.850 --> 00:01:29.890
This is great if you need 
to find food on the go,

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.730
transit, it will take you not 
only to airports but also

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:35.770
it will show you where 
bus stations are.

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.730
If you need to get gas.
We'll go down.

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.330
Lodging, hotels for a long hotel stay,

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:47.080
shopping, ATM, 
entertainment, recreation.

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:48.740
Let's say you're traveling with 
the kids something happens 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:52.810
and you need to find a hospital ASAP,
that is not a problem, it will take you there.

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:57.750
We'll go down, also auto services.
How many times has your car broken down

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:00.090
and you really need to find help fast.

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:05.190
This is a great little tool. So we're 
going to go back to the main page.

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.790
Here we go, and if you click on View Map

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:11.270
this will show you both ariel 
and street views of your map.

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:15.630
So let's say you don't need point-by-point
directions, that's not a problem at all.

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:17.770
You can just look at the map 
and find your own way.

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:20.840
This is not for me though, 
I need step-by-step.

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:23.480
Alright, we'll go back to the main screen.

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:28.950
Now if you go into tools, right here,
you'll see it's much more than a GPS.

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.920
You've got your picture viewer, 
and you can load all your pictures on here.

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:35.120
And if you go into picture viewer 
you also have a slideshow option.

00:02:36.490 --> 00:02:37.360
So we'll go back, 

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:41.360
If you go, Where am I?
Now this is a cool little feature,

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.360
If you go Where am I? It will 
tell you exactly where you are.

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.630
Your location, 
your coordinates,

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:48.200
the nearest hospital,
the nearest police station.

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:51.300
This is great if you have 
no idea where you are.

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:53.040
If you are in a city 
that is foreign to you.

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.810
You know I can't tell you how many times  
I have been there and needed this.

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:58.710
Alright, so we'll go back,

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:02.050
and you'll see the other features  
when you scroll down,

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:04.250
like a calculator, 
a unit convertor, 

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:06.090
world clock, if you're 
a jet-setter.

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:09.790
And also, My Data, 
and that's about it.

00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:11.550
We'll go back to  
the main screen now,

00:03:12.030 --> 00:03:14.000
but this is the Garmin, 
and it's easy to use,

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:17.960
it's great, and I think it's great for beginners.
So, go out and get yours.

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:21.940
