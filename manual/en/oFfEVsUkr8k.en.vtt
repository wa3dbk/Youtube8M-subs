Hi, my name is Ivan and we are here with Expert
Village and in this clip we're going to learn

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:09.950
about beers, different kind of beers. In this
very clip we're going to learn about lagers

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:17.500
or pilsners. And, since we talked about strong
beers, each beer company has something of

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:23.869
a strong beer, with a little bit higher alcohol
content. We are going to pick, or I picked,

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:31.640
the Hungarian Borsodi, this company was founded
in 1973 and they own a couple of different

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:39.590
brands and are very well recognized in Hungary.
And, they came up with a Bivaly which means

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:52.380
Bor it's a Borsodi Sor with 6 1/2% alcohol
content beer. And, let see what it tastes

00:00:52.380 --> 00:01:15.650
like. Wow, nice big half liter bottle, everybody
wants this. It has a little bit of a darker

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:28.850
color,
not as smooth in the aftertaste, has a quite

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:37.380
a strong after taste. But, all around it's
a nice beer to drink. You don't feel the higher

00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:47.580
alcohol content. Between the Dreher or with
the pilsner at 4 1/2 this is 6 1/2 and you

00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:52.579
really can't feel the difference tasting it.
I guess when you drink 4 or 5 bottles of it

00:01:52.579 --> 00:01:59.890
it does have a different effect after that.
As I mentioned we have two famous brands,

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:09.079
one is Dreher, which is probably the oldest
beer producing company in Hungary. And, Borsodi,

00:02:09.079 --> 00:02:13.980
they own, these two beer companies together
own most of the famous beer brands that are

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:21.519
available in Hungary. Hungary, by the way
is located in the middle of Europe, surrounded,

00:02:21.519 --> 00:02:29.730
right next to, between Austria, and Eukrane
and Romania and Czeck Republic, Slavakia,

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:39.579
and Slavania and Croatia. So, we got all these
neighbors. And, we are big beer drinkers,

00:02:39.579 --> 00:02:46.879
and big wine drinkers as well, and all together
we are big drinkers. So, if you come to Hungary

00:02:46.879 --> 00:02:52.989
you will find lost of good local beer. Make
sure you try the local beer when you're here.
