00:00:16.804 --> 00:00:18.140
We set the record last year,

00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:21.168
so the goal is clear for this year,
we have to break the record.

00:00:21.611 --> 00:00:24.221
We are representing Nigeria,
University of Benin.

00:00:24.221 --> 00:00:27.198
It's very exciting seeing everybody
working on their car

00:00:27.198 --> 00:00:30.388
and you see the good cars,
the bad and the ugly!

00:00:31.363 --> 00:00:35.683
We want to make our country
happy for our challenge,

00:00:35.683 --> 00:00:40.978
our school, our friends and also our
sponsors really believe in our team.

00:00:40.978 --> 00:00:43.606
Maybe, why not, we can be the first,
in the first place.

00:00:43.606 --> 00:00:47.073
3...2...1 and go!

00:00:51.649 --> 00:00:55.833
It's our first time today that
we drive and go on the track.

00:00:56.593 --> 00:00:57.432
'Are you nervous?'

00:00:57.432 --> 00:00:58.600
Just a little bit.

00:01:00.631 --> 00:01:03.626
Someone crashed into me, I had
to slam the breaks on one time,

00:01:03.626 --> 00:01:07.520
lots of other drivers - just relieved
to have made it in 39 minutes.

00:01:12.037 --> 00:01:13.209
I'm so psyched out,

00:01:13.209 --> 00:01:16.018
this is the last day
so I'm going to give it all.

00:01:24.898 --> 00:01:26.544
Probably we are now
top of the list.

00:01:26.985 --> 00:01:29.400
604km per Kw.

00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:32.563
Two hundred and eighteen point nine.

00:01:37.526 --> 00:01:40.393
Two thousand, zero zero zero
- perfect!

00:01:43.665 --> 00:01:47.934
The winner, Microjoule-La Joliverie
from France.

00:01:54.463 --> 00:01:57.506
We beat our last record
and it's a world record

00:01:57.506 --> 00:01:59.800
so it's great and we are very happy.

00:02:03.225 --> 00:02:05.674
Can't wait to do it again next year.
