Let's jump ahead. And although I like to work
from dark to light let's go ahead and add

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:17.360
some lighter tones in here to help establish
this form so that you can see where we're

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:26.900
going with this. This is just a lighter gray.
And I'm just going to add some of this lighter

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:33.140
tone in here where I'm seeing that lighter
gray to help establish the shapes that we're

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:47.760
dealing with as much as anything else.
You can see that this is beginning to have

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:55.699
much more of a rounded form. Beginning to
look like it's not just a flat plane. And

00:00:55.699 --> 00:01:08.620
it's got some brighter highlights over here
and there's a little bit of that shape there.

00:01:08.620 --> 00:02:22.560
Watch what happens when we move to an even
brighter color. A lighter gray yet. I once

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:34.110
had a teacher that said the secret was just
to put the color that you see in the right

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:37.069
place on the canvas and the painting will
appear.
