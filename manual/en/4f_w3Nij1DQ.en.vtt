00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:03.840
Hey there. This is a little guide to how to

00:00:04.839 --> 00:00:11.699
make some cheap super cheap super easy [weather] [proof] signs and

00:00:12.639 --> 00:00:15.569
Here's an example of the finished product right here

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:19.109
and it's completely laminated and

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:25.499
This will be very much more cost effective than if you were to buy signs

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:30.720
To go over the material list I'll be using this

00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:35.320
1.5 mil [Link in Description]

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:38.560
hot sealing laminate [Link in Description]

00:00:38.740 --> 00:00:44.580
I bought a roll of two of these and this is made over two hundred signs right here and

00:00:44.880 --> 00:00:47.020
The other roll I have not used at all

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.750
so

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:51.699
Let's get started

00:00:51.699 --> 00:00:53.699
first you'll want to

00:00:54.129 --> 00:01:01.739
This is just using two sheets of paper right here like this. I put a border [on] this, so it'd be

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.769
more connected when it laid in front like that, so first

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:11.159
line them all up

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:20.159
This is only you only have to do this if you put a border on it

00:01:20.159 --> 00:01:25.079
But I feel like the border makes it look more complete and professional use

00:01:25.810 --> 00:01:27.549
bigger scissors

00:01:27.549 --> 00:01:29.549
And just quickly

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:32.700
cuts across

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:37.140
pulling this corner

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.290
And I am cutting

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:47.669
ten sheets at a time because cutting

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:53.909
Will be your largest time expense, and then just clean it up

00:01:58.689 --> 00:02:03.029
And I'm doing just this you know just as fast as possible I could be neater

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:07.320
but if they're going to be signs that are placed on a

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:15.450
Telephone pole or anything that people are driving by I the little mistakes will not show up

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:19.570
and

00:02:19.570 --> 00:02:22.560
People people respond to the ones that are made

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:26.069
Beautifully to the responds ones that are made a little bit more

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.519
Sloppily, okay, [alright]. You'll take

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:32.070
these two right there I

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:37.650
Like to do it this way. I lay it over line up the border edges like that

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:44.790
Put a small piece of tape between them to hold them together when you're working with it

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.390
just a

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:51.250
little bit of tape will work

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:56.430
You could probably use more than this, but this just [to] see is all you really need

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:00.299
All [right], then you'll put [that] to the side

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:04.360
and

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:11.730
Your first couple times of these it might be more difficult but once you get like 20 or so under your belt it will be

00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:16.770
You know you could do this you could crack out three [done]

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:21.659
You know two to three times as many as when you first start it so don't be discouraged

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:25.739
if it takes a bit of time, so what I did was I sort of I

00:03:26.500 --> 00:03:32.820
Rolled it out and flipped it back over so it's covering both sides I make sure there's a good

00:03:34.780 --> 00:03:37.559
About a quarter to a half inch from the edges

00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:42.480
Just help with sealing then I take my razor

00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:45.040
that I have and

00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:47.429
I run. It along this edge pull it taut

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:50.310
Run it along this edge

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:53.670
Very simple very easy, you're almost ready to go

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:55.450
now

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:56.980
You'll take your iron

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:03.299
Which is been heating up this time and I have it set [at] five you want it a little bit higher

00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:08.339
Then you'd think with the plastic, and you just hit it really quick you move from the center out

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:11.130
Just like that

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:13.410
really fast

00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:20.130
And then you hold down the edges just a bit because when the the heat will make it shrivel up

00:04:20.130 --> 00:04:22.439
And if you cool it off a little bit

00:04:24.879 --> 00:04:31.919
It will shrivel just a little bit less all right you have the basics of it right there. [I] like [to] [go] around the outsides

00:04:36.729 --> 00:04:44.729
And just seal it in and take a little bit of that curl out of there flip that back over do that again

00:04:52.419 --> 00:04:55.288
All right, you've got almost a finished product right there

00:04:56.169 --> 00:05:01.139
then I like to you don't have to but I think it looks a lot more professional and

00:05:02.349 --> 00:05:06.509
the more professional you look the less people think they can just

00:05:07.180 --> 00:05:09.689
Do whatever service you're doing by themselves

00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:12.330
So I

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:16.199
Cut that up not the best cut right there

00:05:17.139 --> 00:05:18.279
but

00:05:18.279 --> 00:05:22.949
It works just fine because I'll be reselling it one last time

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:37.180
All righty

00:05:37.939 --> 00:05:44.019
You seal the edges one last time and it's a few times you can go over the center of it

00:05:44.270 --> 00:05:48.849
The better because it'll start to bubble, and it'll start to tear and melt

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:54.159
If you go over this area too many times, and that's all done

00:05:56.719 --> 00:06:00.309
It'll look right like that these are completely weatherproof

00:06:01.249 --> 00:06:03.249
[I've] had them

00:06:03.289 --> 00:06:06.878
Taped up on telephone poles and the ones that weren't taken down

00:06:07.879 --> 00:06:09.469
lasted for

00:06:09.469 --> 00:06:15.969
over a year now with no leaking no blotching of the ink on the inside and

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:20.799
They've just held up really well, and they're a super cheap alternative

00:06:21.529 --> 00:06:23.529
I'll have some

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:29.529
Other films where I go over the color paper ones and show the results on that

00:06:30.259 --> 00:06:37.688
that is just a way to make some super cheap [signs] that you can really put a lot of them out there and

00:06:37.939 --> 00:06:42.669
If they get taken down you it really doesn't matter to you because you have [ten] more to put back up

00:06:42.889 --> 00:06:44.889
All right, hope this helped. Bye

00:06:46.339 --> 00:06:47.169
Hey there

00:06:47.169 --> 00:06:53.288
I decided after this video to see how many I could make in a half an hour and I could [just]

00:06:53.689 --> 00:07:01.119
Write at make 11 per 30 minutes. So I used to be if you get a better slightly better system

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:03.489
You could probably make them a little bit faster

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:07.509
but just use that as a time frame if you

00:07:07.699 --> 00:07:13.508
Need a certain amount of time a certain amount of signs and have a certain amount of time till

00:07:14.089 --> 00:07:16.089
That deadline

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:21.550
11 per half-hour is is a pretty good rate? It's not the greatest, but it's

00:07:22.069 --> 00:07:24.309
a pretty average rate, so

00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:26.830
if you were

00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:34.719
Debating on whether to do this on a large scale or not. I hope that little extra tidbit helps [alright]. Bye
