Hi I'm Mark Emiley on behalf of Expert Village.
In this segment we are going to go over the

00:00:04.640 --> 00:00:09.009
recipe that we are going to use for our brew
session today. For all of my recipes I would

00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:13.780
be using liquid malt extract instead of dry
malt extract. If you like to use dry malt

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:19.160
extract you can use twenty-five less, I would
also be using whole hops instead of pellet

00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:25.869
hops. If you like to use pellet hops alos
reduce the amount of hops by twenty-five percent.

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:30.740
Finally all of our boils are going to be going
for sixty minutes. Before I give you the recipe

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:35.410
take a second go grab a piece of paper and
a pencil and get ready to write down the ingreidents

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:39.670
and the amounts you are going to need. For
our American barely wine we are going to go

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:45.530
to a huge mulch beer it is going to be having
a lot of hops to showcase in both the flavor

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:51.320
and the malt bitterness. To this effect we
are going to go with fifteen pounds of liquid

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:57.579
malt extract. If you want to finish a little
bit drier you can replace two or three pounds

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:03.309
with two or three pounds with either table
sugar or preferable dextra instead and that

00:01:03.309 --> 00:01:08.690
ferment a lot cleaner but still give you alcohol
content. For our speciality grains we are

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:14.470
going to go with one quarter pound of victory,
one quarter pound of munic, one quarter pound

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:20.680
of crystal forty and one quarter pound of
crystal one-twenty. This is going to give

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:26.220
it some nice background flavors to the malt
profile. For our hops we are going to go with

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:31.210
one ounce of centennial with ninety percent
of acid for our beginning hops in sixty minutes

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:37.410
in beginning of the boil. We are also going
to go with one more ounce of Shanok and the

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:40.980
alpha acids with fifteen minutes left in the
boil. Next we are going to go with one ounce

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:45.940
of Cascade added to ten minutes left in the
boil. Cascade is around 5.2 percent alpha

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:53.040
acid. And finally after we are done boiling
we are going to add one more ounce of Simcoe

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:59.130
to it and let that steep to give it a nice
aromatic profile. With fifteen minutes left

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:02.740
in the boil we are going to add our Irish
moss to help with that protein coagulation

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:13.770
and for this beer we are going to use the
Fermentis Safale US-05 to give it a nice clean

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:14.349
fementis profile.
