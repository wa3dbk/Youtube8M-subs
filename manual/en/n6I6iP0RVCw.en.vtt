00:00:02.599 --> 00:00:05.600 position:80%
-The 5th generation was [unk] show. Can I say [unk]

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:07.606 position:69%
show? I have to look at my notes. That's how

00:00:07.374 --> 00:00:10.372 position:67%
much of a [unk] show was. 3DO in '93, Atari

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:13.227 position:95%
Jaguar in '93, then finally the playstation. There's too many

00:00:13.299 --> 00:00:14.313 position:95%
players here. There's too many players in the 5th generation.

00:00:14.256 --> 00:00:25.900 position:83%
Some things got to give. -It really was a fascinating

00:00:26.129 --> 00:00:31.128 position:84%
time. So many people found companies like 3DO and Sega

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:33.531 position:69%
all moved to Nintendo or to Sony and both of

00:00:33.679 --> 00:00:38.677 position:97%
them just became major powerhouses for the next several years.

00:00:37.759 --> 00:00:39.725 position:77%
-I think history chosen the Nintendo 64 is one of

00:00:39.419 --> 00:00:45.424 position:91%
the stranger systems ever created. -1964-- -On the one, it

00:00:45.929 --> 00:00:50.926 position:92%
lost. The playstation was far more successful than the N64.

00:00:50.339 --> 00:00:53.356 position:75%
On the other hand, it run arguably, the two best

00:00:53.384 --> 00:00:56.385 position:81%
video games ever made. Super Mario 64, a launch game

00:00:56.469 --> 00:01:00.446 position:70%
for the N64. And then a few years after that,

00:01:00.159 --> 00:01:02.182 position:77%
Legend of Zelda, The Ocarina of Time and then you

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:09.467 position:98%
can't forget GoldenEye. And suddenly, you know, the Nintendo 64

00:01:08.729 --> 00:01:13.723 position:78%
is a staple of college dorm rooms and drinking and

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:13.973 position:80%
it's one of these things that you are sitting there

00:01:14.529 --> 00:01:19.532 position:97%
with passing the control around playing nonstop. -But something dramatic

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:22.303 position:97%
happened in the next generation, the 32-bit generation Sony showed

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:29.795 position:78%
up. -The Walkman people have the nerve to come out

00:01:29.694 --> 00:01:32.677 position:78%
with this Playstation. As as a Sega kid talking to

00:01:32.399 --> 00:01:36.391 position:97%
my Nintendo enemies suddenly [unk] his Playstation I have watched.

00:01:36.189 --> 00:01:38.192 position:77%
-For several years in my career with Sega when we

00:01:38.889 --> 00:01:40.912 position:75%
heard a big company like Sony was gonna get into

00:01:41.199 --> 00:01:46.194 position:94%
the game in mystery, it was laughable. -Fly, plaything, fly.

00:01:45.439 --> 00:01:49.524 position:92%
You're not ready. -And then when the Playstation first came

00:01:49.789 --> 00:01:51.806 position:81%
out, we were all pretty blown away and quite frankly

00:01:51.959 --> 00:01:54.953 position:77%
pretty scared. But what it was? Was Sony making a

00:01:54.819 --> 00:01:57.722 position:97%
calculated effort that you know whether you see Microsoft, camera,

00:01:57.189 --> 00:01:59.234 position:80%
and DVD exact same thing, then saying we are coming

00:02:00.059 --> 00:02:01.116 position:89%
in here. We're seeing with this market isn't worth taking

00:02:01.709 --> 00:02:03.726 position:72%
our claim in it. This is kind of an accidental

00:02:04.379 --> 00:02:06.367 position:89%
way. They were supposed to just partner with Nintendo and

00:02:05.765 --> 00:02:06.163 position:91%
make a CD attachment to the super Nintendo. Relations fell

00:02:05.815 --> 00:02:06.342 position:92%
apart. A lot of people historically they blame Nintendo for

00:02:06.019 --> 00:02:15.001 position:89%
kind of boggling that, but the bottomline is-- -The media

00:02:14.539 --> 00:02:17.538 position:94%
is much cheaper for groups. One think ss produced cartridges

00:02:17.259 --> 00:02:21.266 position:80%
with [unk] side. One think is just [unk] -And thus,

00:02:21.939 --> 00:02:24.053 position:78%
it was expensive to develop to get those things to

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:26.932 position:81%
test them out to me where you're making your return,

00:02:26.089 --> 00:02:28.098 position:77%
you know, I mean, that's the whole problem. - You

00:02:28.415 --> 00:02:34.407 position:94%
and me. Booyah, grandma. Booyah! -The thing that Sony really

00:02:33.369 --> 00:02:37.255 position:80%
did that was different is they added to-- that they

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:39.592 position:97%
brought in marketing that first generation of the Playstation. -"Hey

00:02:39.879 --> 00:02:44.902 position:97%
plumber boy, mustache man. Your worst nightmare has arrived!" -But

00:02:45.229 --> 00:02:47.093 position:70%
it was this idea that you should be moving on

00:02:47.119 --> 00:02:51.112 position:97%
from whatever kiddie games you played before. There were times

00:02:50.189 --> 00:02:51.206 position:75%
when I'm, you know, in high school and I'm like,

00:02:52.139 --> 00:02:52.968 position:70%
"I don't know how much longer I'm gonna be in

00:02:52.054 --> 00:02:52.088 position:70%
this hobby." This is cool and this is fun and

00:02:53.529 --> 00:02:57.536 position:88%
this is distraction, you know, but I want something more

00:02:57.584 --> 00:02:59.539 position:75%
and I didn't know-- I didn't know what that was.

00:02:59.089 --> 00:03:00.097 position:69%
I didn't know what to say. And then one day,

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:03.038 position:70%
you know, me and a friend went off. We rented

00:03:02.769 --> 00:03:05.768 position:84%
some games with this Playstation I just gotten and one

00:03:04.989 --> 00:03:06.853 position:73%
of them was Metal Gear Solid and I played Metal

00:03:06.629 --> 00:03:08.645 position:72%
Gear Solid and for the second time in my life,

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:12.754 position:98%
video games changed my life. -Colonel, what's a Russian gunship

00:03:12.429 --> 00:03:14.454 position:70%
doing here? -And one of them is on his knees.

00:03:14.679 --> 00:03:17.565 position:81%
His name is Otacon. He's crying over sniper wolf and

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:24.130 position:78%
she's staring up the sky dying. -Set me free. -And

00:03:24.659 --> 00:03:25.773 position:84%
hearing up with my other high school friend right next

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:29.436 position:81%
to me and you get attach to these characters, that's

00:03:28.899 --> 00:03:31.854 position:84%
when you get an experience you can't get anywhere else

00:03:31.779 --> 00:03:34.770 position:69%
and the scene, the taste that had it out was

00:03:34.039 --> 00:03:36.040 position:72%
Metal Gear and it was like just that moment of

00:03:36.694 --> 00:03:41.699 position:73%
like this is it man like this is-- -The future.

00:03:42.201 --> 00:03:47.220 position:78%
-We have the second Dreamcast that was the last of

00:03:47.449 --> 00:03:51.424 position:98%
Sega's Consoles unfortunately. -Sega should have been in a Dogfight

00:03:50.789 --> 00:03:52.813 position:98%
with Nintendo of third generation of the generation. They begin

00:03:53.669 --> 00:03:56.646 position:72%
to fade away. -The dream cast was so far ahead

00:03:56.359 --> 00:04:00.234 position:69%
of its time. Nobody knew it to make it. -And

00:04:00.154 --> 00:04:01.256 position:89%
then you had companies like the [unk] that basically just

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:04.056 position:86%
said we're a juggernaut and we are pulling support from

00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:08.234 position:89%
your console and, you know, eventually, the right down on

00:04:08.729 --> 00:04:12.728 position:84%
the Sega Saturn for Sega out of the hardboard business

00:04:12.199 --> 00:04:22.215 position:97%
and they became a software publisher which is essentially what

00:04:22.619 --> 00:04:31.580 position:86%
we have now. -I owe you nothing. -PlayStation 2. You're

00:04:31.099 --> 00:04:34.099 position:70%
gonna see that even as today is the most sold

00:04:34.099 --> 00:04:36.985 position:89%
video game console. -And Sony flips the switch, man. They

00:04:37.049 --> 00:04:39.092 position:78%
changed the game with the Playstation 2 and it was

00:04:39.689 --> 00:04:42.696 position:72%
also-- it was a bit of Trojan horse effect and

00:04:42.869 --> 00:04:45.851 position:75%
that it was right around the time when DVDs were

00:04:45.139 --> 00:04:48.843 position:92%
becoming the most popular medium of home video. -It's movie

00:04:48.859 --> 00:04:50.902 position:59%
on a disc, the size of a CD. -The same

00:04:51.499 --> 00:04:54.474 position:72%
way it back in the old days Nintendo kinda had

00:04:53.589 --> 00:04:54.771 position:72%
every game we needed to play with maybe one or

00:04:55.194 --> 00:05:00.155 position:95%
two exceptions. PS2 is the system for sixth generation. -Your

00:04:59.799 --> 00:05:03.254 position:98%
torment is just beginning. -When you talk about-- Okay, Playstation

00:05:03.374 --> 00:05:06.340 position:70%
2s were God of War shows of. Then, Metal Gear

00:05:06.349 --> 00:05:09.367 position:91%
continues to evolve, right? Again, all the games I've just

00:05:09.829 --> 00:05:12.847 position:97%
mentioned are exclusive to the Playstation 2. Sony is swinging

00:05:13.809 --> 00:05:16.582 position:88%
like Mike Tyson against your grandmother. -Do you have a

00:05:16.209 --> 00:05:21.182 position:92%
problem? Turn off your spaceship. -And again, there are the

00:05:20.489 --> 00:05:24.466 position:69%
young kids on the block and then I mean Déjà

00:05:23.929 --> 00:05:26.974 position:98%
Vu comes a knock-in and here Microsoft suddenly announces they're

00:05:27.299 --> 00:05:32.754 position:89%
gonna make-they're gonna make this Xbox. The Xbox was not

00:05:32.865 --> 00:05:36.842 position:83%
a great console. It was a good first step. -Microsoft

00:05:36.439 --> 00:05:38.394 position:77%
comes out. They know they're gonna take a loss at

00:05:37.819 --> 00:05:41.801 position:81%
the Xbox. They talk a horrendous loss and not making

00:05:41.339 --> 00:05:43.362 position:70%
money on it. But Microsoft is so in the black

00:05:43.899 --> 00:05:45.922 position:84%
here that they can just say, okay, will do. -Microsoft

00:05:46.459 --> 00:05:49.436 position:83%
is the Windows company. It is weird enough when Sony,

00:05:48.899 --> 00:05:49.922 position:86%
the people who made your television, are gonna make you

00:05:50.459 --> 00:05:51.482 position:73%
a game console, but at least they made a thing.

00:05:52.269 --> 00:05:56.064 position:80%
-And they give you this gigantic black box and this

00:05:56.229 --> 00:06:00.206 position:92%
gigantic controller and you're like, what the hell is this?

00:05:59.669 --> 00:06:03.669 position:77%
This thing is a bomb. Nobody wants Halo. That was

00:06:03.669 --> 00:06:06.646 position:80%
it for them. That's all they needed, what was Halo.

00:06:06.359 --> 00:06:10.404 position:80%
-This is gonna be your lucky day. -There's the Halo

00:06:10.525 --> 00:06:13.912 position:98%
obviously. There's Fable. You're talking about Knights of the Old

00:06:13.999 --> 00:06:17.974 position:94%
Republic. Like they're saying we're gonna get you good games

00:06:17.089 --> 00:06:19.066 position:72%
and then we'll put on them yellow text only on

00:06:19.029 --> 00:06:25.074 position:92%
Xbox. -Yeah! -Hello? -The Nintendo comes out and they said,

00:06:25.649 --> 00:06:28.785 position:75%
all right, you guys love N64 so much. Let's give

00:06:28.759 --> 00:06:31.532 position:81%
you the Nintendo GameCube. -If you remember a lot of

00:06:30.909 --> 00:06:34.918 position:88%
people laugh at the GameCube. So, there's a purple lunch

00:06:35.149 --> 00:06:38.944 position:77%
box with a handle on. I appreciate that because I

00:06:39.109 --> 00:06:41.152 position:94%
thought, you know, game consoles previously were meant to be

00:06:41.749 --> 00:06:47.724 position:91%
tucked away hidden-- -But the Nintendo found a software in

00:06:47.089 --> 00:06:50.071 position:95%
odd position in the beginning of the sixth generation because

00:06:49.109 --> 00:06:52.102 position:69%
of a lot of gamers they want the Nintendo to

00:06:51.179 --> 00:06:54.213 position:86%
fight back. They feel like Nintendo had taken its lumps

00:06:54.329 --> 00:07:02.326 position:84%
from Sony, from Sega. -[unk] -And again, they had lost

00:07:02.049 --> 00:07:05.067 position:88%
before they began on-- Remember, we only have this small

00:07:05.779 --> 00:07:07.811 position:86%
group of franchises that we really love. I'm sure other

00:07:08.369 --> 00:07:11.353 position:75%
people can program for it. -They did not. No one

00:07:11.199 --> 00:07:14.063 position:70%
decided to come the game plan. -A lot of that

00:07:13.589 --> 00:07:17.580 position:77%
focus had gone on to the Playstation 2. That real

00:07:16.599 --> 00:07:19.592 position:80%
is where the industry had shifted over to. But this

00:07:18.919 --> 00:07:19.944 position:75%
was the beginning of a change where it wasn't so

00:07:20.829 --> 00:07:22.836 position:77%
much just about how good are your graphics or how

00:07:23.759 --> 00:07:26.718 position:80%
good are your games, but what else can your console

00:07:26.179 --> 00:07:34.190 position:81%
do. -[unk] This was the biggest Trojan horse I think

00:07:34.479 --> 00:07:35.797
anyone ever pulled off.
