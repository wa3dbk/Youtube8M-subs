"A Scientific Discovery"

00:00:15.167 --> 00:00:19.708
The best sample I've extracted!
An unknown subspecies...

00:00:22.042 --> 00:00:23.667
I'm just here to sweep up a little.

00:00:23.792 --> 00:00:28.667
Ah, the chore list! I'm done anyway. I
just need to fill out this address form.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:30.375
Institute of

00:00:34.999 --> 00:00:41.500
Institute of Microorganisms...
Department of Discoveries.

00:00:41.958 --> 00:00:43.964
Attention young scientists!! Do you want to
travel to the Himalayas to search for the

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:46.086
legendary Yeti?? Of course you do! Be one of
the first to sign up for The Young Explorers'

00:00:46.111 --> 00:00:48.093
Himalayan Expedition. It leaves the train
station at nine AM. Do you want to go down

00:00:48.118 --> 00:00:50.006
in scientific history?? Of course you do!!
Don't miss this exciting opportunity!

00:00:57.792 --> 00:01:01.573
Hooray!!! Liza! Be a lamb and
mail this for me. I don't

00:01:01.598 --> 00:01:05.649
have the time. I'm going to go
down in scientific history!!

00:01:05.833 --> 00:01:07.583
Sure I guess, but why can't you??

00:01:07.917 --> 00:01:09.083
I have a train to catch!

00:01:15.333 --> 00:01:16.500
What's up with Alex?

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:18.083
He's so, active!

00:01:18.125 --> 00:01:21.667
He's training to go on an expedition.
He wants to catch a yeti.

00:01:22.667 --> 00:01:23.667
Oh yeah??

00:01:23.833 --> 00:01:25.417
Alex who??

00:01:25.667 --> 00:01:28.833
That's not very nice! Alex is
a good scientist you know!

00:01:29.167 --> 00:01:30.750
He'll hurt himself out there!

00:01:31.083 --> 00:01:32.375
He'll freeze to death!

00:01:32.417 --> 00:01:36.208
We have to keep him from leaving.
I bet Tim'll help us out.

00:01:41.895 --> 00:01:46.874
I need a set of claws. Rosie! Please! I
know you have some press-on nails in there.

00:01:46.875 --> 00:01:48.083
You want my new nails??

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:50.250
We're trying to save a life!!!

00:01:50.792 --> 00:01:52.750
I guess you can use them this once.

00:01:58.999 --> 00:02:00.708
I have a million things to do!

00:02:01.208 --> 00:02:03.625
Check this out! You won't believe it! Look!!!

00:02:08.833 --> 00:02:12.458
It's a yeti all right! Why was it in our yard??

00:02:13.167 --> 00:02:16.708
What does it matter?? You found it!!
You big explorer you!!

00:02:17.125 --> 00:02:21.417
But it can't be! There have to be
some witnesses wouldn't you think??

00:02:21.792 --> 00:02:25.583
Oh hey Tim! You haven't seen anything
suspicous have you?... Well??

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:33.583
I have!! I saw a, an enormous hairy guy,
with big teeth! And long sharp claws!

00:02:34.167 --> 00:02:38.167
I saw him hanging out on the park bench. He
was eating his lunch or something. Look!

00:02:38.542 --> 00:02:43.250
What's this?? Uh-huh! They appear to be
the fragments of the bones of a chicken!

00:02:43.458 --> 00:02:46.834
I guess it was taking a nap here.
Uh, I mean it was sitting. Right?

00:02:46.835 --> 00:02:48.624
No!

00:02:48.625 --> 00:02:51.976
It was standing. Of course I won't
believe any of this until I

00:02:52.001 --> 00:02:55.191
see some photographic proof,
and that won't be easy at all.

00:02:56.458 --> 00:02:58.500
Uh-oh he's setting up a camera!

00:02:58.708 --> 00:03:02.625
Don't worry he'll get his evidence!
Rosie!! Get me your new fur coat!

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:03.999
Oh I don't think so!

00:03:04.833 --> 00:03:05.999
It's for a good cause!!!

00:03:21.667 --> 00:03:24.208
Wait!!!... Please don't run!!

00:03:27.833 --> 00:03:31.667
Hold on!! You're supposed to be my
major contribution to science!!!

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:41.917
It's you Max?? Forget this
I'm going to the Himalayas!!

00:03:54.583 --> 00:03:56.125
Got it!

00:03:56.542 --> 00:03:57.583
Sshh!!!

00:03:58.083 --> 00:04:01.125
So he oversleeps. At least then he'll be safe.

00:04:04.375 --> 00:04:07.917
My alarm clock is gone!!! I missed the train!!

00:04:09.875 --> 00:04:10.999
Who's responsible??!!

00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:16.042
Alex!! The Institute of Microorganisms!!
It's a reply!!

00:04:16.917 --> 00:04:20.228
Your sample contained the cell of
an unknown organism!! They think

00:04:20.253 --> 00:04:23.316
it's consistent with something
originating in the Himalayas!!

00:04:25.125 --> 00:04:28.875
You don't have to go anywhere! Maybe you can
take that cell and grow your own yeti!! Mm-hm!

00:04:30.417 --> 00:04:35.875
Hooray!! Hooray!! I made a major
contribution to science after all!
