00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:11.120
Nokia 5330 XpressMusic.

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:16.720
Nokia call the styling of the new Nokia 5330
XpressMusic "edgy".

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:18.890
We have another word for it - "ugly".

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:23.619
"Edgy" is the sort of word that designers
use when they have come up with something

00:00:23.619 --> 00:00:26.480
that looks like a Pontiac Aztek.

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:32.460
The Nokia 5330 XpressMusic is an unappealing
mix of curves and straight lines that doesn't

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.739
seem to fit together well.

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:40.770
The 2.4" display is dwarfed by a sea of shiny
plastic that looks out of proportion, and

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:46.710
when the small numeric keypad slides out,
the 5330 looks almost comical.

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:54.170
It is worth bearing in mind that the 5330
is 101 x 48 x 14mm in size when closed, the

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:58.780
same size as many monoblock "candy bar" designs.

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:04.210
Slide it open, and the 5330 comes in at 128mm
tall.

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:10.010
Get past the tragic exterior, and the 5330
XpressMusic isn't bad.

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:18.520
It comes with tri-band UMTS (but no HSDPA),
GPS with Nokia Maps, a decent multimedia player,

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:24.670
FM radio, stereo Bluetooth and a 3.5mm audio
socket.

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:31.370
There's a 2GB microSD memory card in the standard
sales package, plus dedicated media keys to

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:34.520
make music playback easy to manage.

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:40.090
We appreciate that some people might like
the way that the 5330 looks, and it certainly

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:43.310
looks like it might make a good music player.

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:48.290
At â‚¬160 before tax and subsidy, it looks
like pretty decent value too.

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:53.450
Even if it is probably the ugliest phone that
we have seen so far this year!

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:59.740
Nokia say that the 5330 XpressMusic should
be available during Q3 2009 in black/red and

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:02.280
silver/blue colour combinations.
