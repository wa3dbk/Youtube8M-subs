00:00:01.900 --> 00:00:03.280
Phineas: Mom's fried chicken.

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:04.600
Always good.

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:13.499
Ferb: Yes, but at KFC, I think their grilled
chicken is a lot better.

00:00:13.499 --> 00:00:21.992
Phineas: Cool...I know what we're gonna do
today, Ferb!

00:00:21.992 --> 00:00:32.940
We're gonna build a giant pillow!
*construction noises*

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:46.810
Delivery Man: Uh...Aren't you a little young
to be building a giant pillow?

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:49.850
Phineas: Yes, yes we are.

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:53.450
Delivery Man: Uh...okay then.

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:56.120
Just sign here...

00:00:56.120 --> 00:01:05.340
Phineas: Hey, where's Perry?

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:22.190
Major Monogram: Agent P, Doctor Doofenshmirtz
is doing something.

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:24.500
He's building some -inator.

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.710
Go stop him!

00:01:28.710 --> 00:01:30.120
(Perry!)

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:35.710
Dr. Doofenshmirtz: Ah, Perry the Platypus.

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:39.211
Just in time for my angry bear-inator.

00:01:39.211 --> 00:01:47.450
Using this, I will make all the bears angry
and they will destroy the Tri-State Area and

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:57.490
make it mine! (evil laugh)

00:01:57.490 --> 00:02:09.150
Phineas: Oh, Ferb, that feels so good.

00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:10.750
The giant pillow thing?

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:13.520
That was a great idea.

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.529
Ferb: It was your idea.

00:02:16.529 --> 00:02:21.049
You do know that, right?

00:02:21.049 --> 00:02:29.719
It was your idea.

00:02:29.719 --> 00:02:38.999
Phineas: Maybe we shouldn't have built such
a large thing.

00:02:38.999 --> 00:03:00.809
Oh, there you are, Perry.
