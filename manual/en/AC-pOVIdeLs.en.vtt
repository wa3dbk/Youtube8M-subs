&gt;&gt; Rick Miller: Food security means the ability

00:00:10.569 --> 00:00:14.401
to grow a crop or to enhance yields in such
a way that we have a secure food supply. Food

00:00:14.401 --> 00:00:17.200
has to be grown in a manner that it is safe.
\

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:18.200
\
0:00:17:030,0:00:28:130 \

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:22.929
Crop protection plays a role in food security
and food safety in two ways: first, we look

00:00:22.929 --> 00:00:28.300
for products that can help enhance the yield,
which is providing for food security. \

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:29.300
\
0:00:28:150,0:00:50:180 \

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:35.370
The second thing around food security is that
the public, the people that are consuming

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:40.610
the food, they want an assurance that that
food has been grown in a safe manner. So whether

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:45.180
it be transporting the crop to the market
place or actually making the end products

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:52.649
that we eat and consume, crop protection products
are used to accomplish all of that.\

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:54.789
\
0:00:54:150,0:01:27:050 \

00:00:54.789 --> 00:00:59.940
We do business locally, while we have a number
of products and we have knowledge that is

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:06.130
global in nature, we do business essentially
one acre or one hectare at a time. We deal

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:12.750
with local growers and local producers that
are focused on maximizing the crop that they

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:19.310
are growing that season, so the solutions
that we have, have to be adapted to the local

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:23.850
needs of the grower, they have to be brought
to the market in such a way that they can

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.280
be utilized by local growers to solve local
problems. \

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:28.280
\
0:01:27:090,0:01:49:040 \

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:35.549
Whether it be the large grain enterprise in
the Ukraine that may be growing wheat on 10

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:42.930
to 20 thousand hectares, to the rice grower
in Vietnam that may be tending to their half

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:48.640
a hectare plot of rice, we have to adapt our
products and adapt our solutions to fit both

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:49.640
needs.\

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:57.540

We have a tremendous number of new innovations

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:02.229
that are coming to the forefront now that
will be commercially available that will help

00:02:02.229 --> 00:02:07.110
growers not only enhance their yield but enhance
the quality of those crops, and do so with

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:11.099
products that will provide them new answers
and new solutions. \

00:02:11.099 --> 00:02:12.099
\
0:02:11:130,0:02:40:040 \

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:15.500
When we launched Rynaxypyr insect control
product in the Philippines and I was sitting

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:20.580
and talking to a group of growers that were
growing eggplant, and they were telling me

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:25.800
not only about the enhanced yields that they
were achieving from the product, but probably

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:31.320
more importantly and quite unexpectedly, they
told me about how it was improving their livelihood,

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:37.110
how it was improving their quality and their
standard of living in addition to providing

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:39.630
them an agricultural solution that they were
looking for.}
