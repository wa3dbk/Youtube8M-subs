00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.520
MARCELLO PAGANO: Anybody can watch TV
and see margarine is good for you,

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:04.975
margarine is bad for you.

00:00:04.975 --> 00:00:07.310
Should you have a cancer exam or not?

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:10.470
Should you have a mammogram or not?

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:13.650
EARL FRANCIS COOK: I think the field of
public health ad the disciplines of

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:20.140
epidemiology and biostatistics are the
best way to address health problems by

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:23.800
quantifying relationships
that exist in data.

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:26.360
MARCELLO PAGANO: How do they decide
how much to charge us for health

00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:29.650
insurance, for life insurance,
annuities?

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:31.610
How are all these things calculated?

00:00:31.610 --> 00:00:33.360
Why shouldn't we smoke?

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:35.890
Why do we think it's not
good to be obese?

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:36.870
All these issues.

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.560
My name is Marcello Pagano.

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:39.480
EARL FRANCIS COOK: I'm Fran Cook.

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.100
I'm a professor here in the Department
of Epidemiology at the School of

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:44.110
Public Health.

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:49.110
MARCELLO PAGANO: The name of the course
is Quantitative Methods in

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.510
Clinical and Public Health Research.

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.370
EARL FRANCIS COOK: PH207x.

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:59.520
MARCELLO PAGANO: So the point of this
course is to allow the student to

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:09.010
learn about what we can do with
statistics when applied to the

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:12.680
biomedical, health, public
health area.

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:16.150
EARL FRANCIS COOK: We want to expose
them to the basic principles of

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:18.640
epidemiology and biostatistics.

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:24.830
MARCELLO PAGANO: How to make the best
of the information we can gather.

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:27.250
EARL FRANCIS COOK: So this is meant
to be an introductory course.

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:30.030
MARCELLO PAGANO: Numbers
are very precise.

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:33.140
It's the language of science.

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:36.150
EARL FRANCIS COOK: We want them to be
better consumers of the clinical and

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:40.590
public health literature, better able
to interpret publications that they

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:41.200
might read.

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.200
MARCELLO PAGANO: We're all different
heights, different

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.590
weights, different ages.

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:47.780
And that's just with the
superficial stuff.

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:52.080
When we get down to it, with all the
other measurements we can take on

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.860
people, then we really are
very, very variable.

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:59.890
EARL FRANCIS COOK: I hope that the real
success of this course is not

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:03.120
just what the students will learn,
but what the students will do.
