your stemware.

hoss.

strong.

00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:18.760

and single malt, and always ask for a specific

brand of liquor.

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:34.210
If, heaven forbid, your drink comes garnished
with a fruit peel or an umbrella, flick it

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:36.890
away like the trifle it is.

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:38.090
Step 5.

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:41.500
