00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:29.920
Ohhhhhhh

00:00:29.920 --> 00:00:34.260
Ohhhhhhh

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:38.680
Ohhhhhhh

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:41.280
Ohhhhhhh

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:43.360
OhhhOhhh

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:51.700
I feel your lips, I feel you touching my skin

00:00:52.400 --> 00:01:00.320
I feel your sweet, I feel the tears by me

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:08.720
And I wonder, the days to see, what's deep inside of me

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:18.120
Emotions that I hide so carefully, I'm to agree

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:27.180
And I lust to a shadow cast

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.140
I now know that you will hear me

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.840
Feelings in more I'll speak to you

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:39.920
A whisper upon the breeze

00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:44.560
The feeling is more than I've ever known

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:49.000
A love so strong it hurts

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.040
As the years went by

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.320
I found in time

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.820
A way to smile

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:59.860
I call your name

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.240
I call your name

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:19.200
Feel free, to comprehend

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:23.160
But since you've been gone

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.960
What I see, will never end

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:31.940
It couldn't be more wrong

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:36.820
Just in time a natural disaster

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:40.540
Hard to find the strength but I try

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:45.360
And I'm dying to find the truth higher

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:49.540
Then you really made me cry

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.300
Cry

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:07.340
Who are you? why Iâ€™m not the only one?

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.700
No matter the things you do

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:16.060
You tucked me in I'm done!

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:40.260
And I lust to a shadow cast

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:44.460
I now know that you will hear me

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:48.960
Feelings in more I'll speak to you

00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:53.100
A whisper upon the breeze

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:57.620
The feeling is more than I've ever known

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:02.040
A love so strong it hurts

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:05.240
As the years went by

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.380
I found in time,

00:04:07.660 --> 00:04:10.000
A way to smile

00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:12.740
I call your name

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:21.200
I call your name

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:30.180
I call your name

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:37.780
Did you like my video, it would make me very happy

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:39.780
if you would support me through Patreon

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:42.300
Even one dollar makes a huge difference,

00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:43.980
I hope to see you there.
