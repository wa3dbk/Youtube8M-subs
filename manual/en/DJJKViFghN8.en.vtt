00:00:00.186 --> 00:00:02.936
(exciting music)

00:00:03.994 --> 00:00:07.066
- When I came to Valpo, I knew no one.

00:00:07.066 --> 00:00:09.853
- I knew one person coming into Valpo.

00:00:09.853 --> 00:00:12.269
- You feel anxiety, you feel excited.

00:00:12.269 --> 00:00:13.743
- There is never a time in your life

00:00:13.743 --> 00:00:17.061
where you're going to be
in a huge group of people

00:00:17.061 --> 00:00:18.821
that are the same age as you,

00:00:18.821 --> 00:00:20.542
going through the exact same thing.

00:00:20.542 --> 00:00:21.935
- You don't really know
what's gonna happen

00:00:21.935 --> 00:00:23.902
but you know that it's gonna be good.

00:00:23.902 --> 00:00:25.785
- Because just as nervous as you are,

00:00:25.785 --> 00:00:28.898
the person right next to you's
gonna be just as nervous.

00:00:28.898 --> 00:00:30.988
- There are lots of kinds of people here

00:00:30.988 --> 00:00:32.298
that are into a lot of different things.

00:00:32.298 --> 00:00:34.674
Skateboarding, guy rides a unicycle.

00:00:34.674 --> 00:00:36.313
- A big stress reliever
for me is juggling.

00:00:36.313 --> 00:00:38.605
It's kind of a hobby
I've had for a long time.

00:00:38.605 --> 00:00:41.717
- I do play the piano, I've
played since I was five.

00:00:41.717 --> 00:00:43.846
- I love to doodle, ya
know, if there's just

00:00:43.846 --> 00:00:46.306
a piece of paper or anything that I can

00:00:46.306 --> 00:00:48.148
just scribble something down on.

00:00:48.148 --> 00:00:49.173
- I can hit a baseball pretty well.

00:00:49.173 --> 00:00:50.648
(baseball colliding with bat)
(soft music)

00:00:50.648 --> 00:00:52.574
- I make mittens from sweaters.

00:00:52.574 --> 00:00:55.482
They're really cute too, so.
(laughter)

00:00:55.482 --> 00:00:58.103
(rock music)

00:00:58.103 --> 00:01:00.806
Everyone has all of
these different stories

00:01:00.806 --> 00:01:03.646
and cool adventures that
they've done in life.

00:01:03.646 --> 00:01:05.614
- It's easy to make
friends and people here

00:01:05.614 --> 00:01:08.934
are so welcoming, so non-judgmental.

00:01:08.934 --> 00:01:10.612
- And you build friendships here.

00:01:10.612 --> 00:01:11.872
Friendships last a long time

00:01:11.872 --> 00:01:13.879
and here, I've built a lot of friendships

00:01:13.879 --> 00:01:15.771
that will probably last me a lifetime.

00:01:15.771 --> 00:01:17.328
- And you're gonna meet people from all

00:01:17.328 --> 00:01:20.074
different faith backgrounds
which I think was really cool.

00:01:20.074 --> 00:01:21.181
(exciting music)

00:01:21.181 --> 00:01:23.393
- My time here at Valpo, I've matured.

00:01:23.393 --> 00:01:26.140
I was hit with a lot of
challenges and adversity

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:28.394
on the field and off the field.

00:01:28.394 --> 00:01:30.813
And I learned that I can
overcome those things.

00:01:30.813 --> 00:01:31.919
- With the tools that they've given me,

00:01:31.919 --> 00:01:34.336
it's really made it so I can propel myself

00:01:34.336 --> 00:01:37.694
into whatever direction that
I want to go after I graduate.

00:01:37.694 --> 00:01:40.598
- I wanna have a career,
I want to have a job

00:01:40.598 --> 00:01:42.687
where I can support myself one day

00:01:42.687 --> 00:01:44.489
and have a family and
be able to support them

00:01:44.489 --> 00:01:46.948
and pay for them to go to college.

00:01:46.948 --> 00:01:49.037
- My dream job would
probably be to one day

00:01:49.037 --> 00:01:52.849
be a Chief Meteorologist,
Weather with Will at six.

00:01:52.849 --> 00:01:54.037
Something like that.
(laughter)

00:01:54.037 --> 00:01:57.120
(upbeat happy music)

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.778
I've loved college, I've loved Valpo.

00:02:03.778 --> 00:02:06.933
And I don't want college to be over yet.

00:02:06.933 --> 00:02:08.122
- I often joke with my friends saying,

00:02:08.122 --> 00:02:10.621
I wish I could do a
victory lap, a fifth year.

00:02:10.621 --> 00:02:11.890
- I've been in school my entire life.

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:13.612
And now it's just kinda like taking that

00:02:13.612 --> 00:02:16.928
extra step farther and
being in the real world.

00:02:16.928 --> 00:02:19.221
- Valpo talks a lot about
how you fit in in the world.

00:02:19.221 --> 00:02:21.474
And what you're place in
the world is gonna be.

00:02:21.474 --> 00:02:23.891
I think Valpo really does a good job of

00:02:23.891 --> 00:02:25.528
placing you in this world and helping

00:02:25.528 --> 00:02:27.207
you find out who you truly are.

00:02:27.207 --> 00:02:30.290
(happy upbeat music)

00:02:33.107 --> 00:02:34.992
- Take a look at Valpo, check us out.

00:02:34.992 --> 00:02:36.466
- Let's go.

00:02:36.466 --> 00:02:37.655
- You got this.

00:02:37.655 --> 00:02:38.596
- Go Valpo.

00:02:38.596 --> 00:02:41.679
(happy upbeat music)
