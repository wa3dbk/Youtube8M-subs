00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.120
 OUR PROJECTS ARE SCALED TO OUR DREAMS

00:00:04.968 --> 00:00:10.802
Those are projects that people have really liked, that is our satisfaction

00:00:11.006 --> 00:00:15.200
 and most of all because the investor has recovered his investment.

00:00:17.765 --> 00:00:22.445
We are talking about five hotels, two thousand rooms. 

00:00:23.638 --> 00:00:26.638
Each hotel was given a specific concept. 

00:00:27.167 --> 00:00:30.167
For example this one was given Mediterranean style… 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:33.279
Mexican style, the next one was called Architecture from the pacific,

00:00:33.901 --> 00:00:37.781
from Jalisco, Careyes style.

00:00:40.133 --> 00:00:44.133
The fourth one was given Mayan style. 

00:00:44.675 --> 00:00:48.000
For the fifth one, they wanted something classic.

00:00:48.037 --> 00:00:51.820
If you are going to pay for a hotel, you ought to have all the proper amenities

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.000
and comfort. Because what people want is to see is the ocean.

00:00:55.865 --> 00:01:00.865
It is very important from the restaurants to the cafeteria to have ocean view.

00:01:01.393 --> 00:01:04.393
Because a Grand Hotel at least must have five specialty restaurants.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.302
This is what you are seeing: you are watching the ocean and the pool. 

00:01:08.633 --> 00:01:11.880
We made a totally suspended cupola.

00:01:12.353 --> 00:01:13.400
MAYAN INSPIRATION

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.016
When I was very young, I had the chance to travel to Palenque. 

00:01:17.415 --> 00:01:21.295
I saw the pyramid and enter into the tomb.

00:01:21.316 --> 00:01:30.360
It shocked me. All that experiences and nice moments remains in my memory...

00:01:31.115 --> 00:01:37.000
The Mayan vaults create a totally different atmosphere.

00:01:37.477 --> 00:01:43.000
The interesting thing here is if you see it from the outside looks like a pyramid.

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.049
If you picture it like a stair, 

00:01:49.038 --> 00:01:52.038
the steps are skylights. 

00:01:53.081 --> 00:01:56.081
It is pleasant to see.

00:01:56.933 --> 00:01:59.933
ROCKY POINT

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:03.829
After “Plaza Las Glorias”, 

00:02:04.416 --> 00:02:08.136
We made “Princesa de Peñasco”, a 200 condos project.

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:13.450
After that we had the opportunity to make the “Sonorans”, 

00:02:13.608 --> 00:02:17.328
around 600 condominiums distributed in three buildings of 200 each. 

00:02:18.019 --> 00:02:21.899
Then “Esmeralda”, we have made a lot of condos. 

00:02:21.895 --> 00:02:24.975
And they have sold pretty well; one of those buildings 

00:02:25.824 --> 00:02:29.864
was sold out on one Saturday.  It was a combination of good sellers, the product and all. 

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:32.590
They sold 100 condos on an afternoon.

00:02:33.198 --> 00:02:36.198
