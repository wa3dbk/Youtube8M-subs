00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:18.060
We use a florist's underwire

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:22.640
Brush with food glue

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.300
We shape the spadix (yellow part of the flower)

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:59.900
We check that it is the right size by comparing it with the flower stencil.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:31.640
The sugar paste must be thin, to the point where you can see the veins of the underlying marble.

00:01:45.800 --> 00:01:52.800
We use a venom stencil to make the flower even more realistic.

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:41.240
Now with the ball tool we thin the edges.

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:29.940
This cone helps us to shape the flower

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:50.460
Now we glue the hard parts, always using the food glue

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:34.420
We coat the underwire with ribbon for florists

00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:24.920
Brush with food coloring powder

00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:21.480
Here is our calla in sugar paste
