Hi this is David Jackel on behalf of Expert
Village, and I am here to talk to you about

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:10.400
poison ivy in the Appalachian Mountains. Now
poison ivy can ruin a trip very quickly, and

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:15.539
unfortunately the Appalachians are filled
with poison ivy. The irritation from the oils

00:00:15.539 --> 00:00:19.910
of poison ivy starts as a small rash, and
then grows to a rash that covers different

00:00:19.910 --> 00:00:24.480
parts of your body, and it itches and it burns.
It is very uncomfortable. In order to treat

00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:30.160
poison ivy you need to know three things.
First, how to spot it. Second, how to prevent

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:36.710
it. And third, how to treat it if you do get
it. Poison ivy has leaves of three. These

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:42.000
are shiny leaves and the leaves have ridges
that point upwards. Poison ivy can grow just

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.080
about anywhere; in the water, in a bush, up
in the trees. If you are not sure whether

00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:51.780
or not it is poison ivy, do not take a chance,
do not touch it. I personally do not go around

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:55.350
touching plants unless I am really sure what
they are. An important point to remember is

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:00.290
that the irritation you experience from poison
ivy is actually your body's reaction to the

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:05.030
oils that come from poison ivy. So you can
get what is referred to as poison ivy when

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:10.970
you are exposed to those oils, and those oils
can be attached to the plant, but they can

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:15.039
also be attached to your clothing if you brush
up against the plant or anything else that

00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:19.609
has touched the plant. So you want to make
sure that if you are walking through foliage

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:23.090
that you keep an eye on what you are walking
through before you start touching your clothing.

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:27.990
If you think you have been exposed to poison
ivy, wash the area with cold water. Make sure

00:01:27.990 --> 00:01:32.659
that it is cold because hot water will open
your pores. As soon as you can, treat the

00:01:32.659 --> 00:01:37.630
area with a medicated scrub. I tend to use
a product called Zanfel, but there are other

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:42.279
products out there like it that actually bonds
with the toxins that are in poison ivy to

00:01:42.279 --> 00:01:46.342
help remove those toxins from your body. If
you are not sure whether or not you have been

00:01:46.342 --> 00:01:50.549
exposed to poison ivy, but you think you might
have been, you should use this kind of scrub,

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:55.749
because even though it is not particularly
cheap, it is worth it to not risk actually

00:01:55.749 --> 00:01:58.999
getting poison ivy, because once you have
gotten it, you have to deal with it and you

00:01:58.999 --> 00:02:00.399
may be dealing with it for up to a week.
