00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.280
Hello ! 
In this video, we will see how to

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.600
disassemble an Acer Aspire 5735Z laptop PC. 

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:25.920
To begin, we will remove the battery. 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.320
Then we will start by removing the keyboard. 

00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:36.460
To remove the keyboard, we take a small flat tip, 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:42.340
we pass the tip in the top left corner and 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:51.680
after we will erase the small plastic clips in three places. 

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:58.820
Then there is a small clip here to remove and we can remove the keyboard. 

00:01:00.900 --> 00:01:11.680
For the keyboard ribbon cable, simply push the plastic holder 

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:14.260
and we can remove the keyboard. 

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:43.540
We do the same for all the visible ribbon cables.

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:51.880
Once everything is disconnected, we can remove the plastic cover. 

00:01:56.100 --> 00:02:01.240
These screws here allow to undo the screen. 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:44.540
We return the PC and we will open the back cover. 

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:49.040
Here we see the wifi card, 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:51.139
here the two memory modules (RAM), 

00:02:51.139 --> 00:02:53.544
here the processor (CPU), 

00:02:53.544 --> 00:02:56.349
here the graphics card (GPU) 

00:02:56.349 --> 00:02:58.440
and here the hard disk drive. 

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:06.800
We will remove this screw there. 

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:14.740
Just push up and after we can remove the hard disk drive. 

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:54.060
Then we will remove the chassis screws. 

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:58.639
All the screws have been removed, we will now remove the CD player. 

00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:17.440
We will remove the cooling system. 

00:04:18.260 --> 00:04:24.940
Be sure to disconnect the power plug to avoid tearing the wire. 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:30.960
From the moment when the cooling system is dismantled, 

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:33.780
it will be necessary to replace the thermal paste imperatively. 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:38.900
I made a video explaining how to change the thermal paste (see link at the top). 

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:41.479
Then we will disconnect the cables from the wifi. 

00:04:41.479 --> 00:04:45.629
Before unplugging them, we can see where the black and gray wires are. 

00:04:45.629 --> 00:04:51.940
We can draw a line to mark the black wire.

00:04:51.940 --> 00:05:02.780
Then we disconnect the wifi cables. 

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:16.100
We return the computer and we will remove the screen. 

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:37.440
Before removing the screws, we will disconnect the cable from the screen. 

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:45.560
Then we will unscrew the screws which hold the screen to the chassis. 

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:47.360
There are two screws: 

00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:48.580
the first is here 

00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:51.060
and the second is there. 

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:02.479
Just lift, we can lay it.

00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:14.220
Then we will continue to unplug the wires of the wifi and release the plug. 

00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:18.950
Once you have both wires, we can clear the screen. 

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:44.160
We will then remove the three screws which appear. 

00:06:44.160 --> 00:07:00.700
Before lifting, we still have a small cable to disconnect, it is the speakers. 

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:07.100
All that remains is to lift the hood. 

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:38.380
We will unscrew the network card. 

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:49.220
We will disconnect the power supply. 

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.200
Here we have access to the motherboard. 

00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:01.960
For reassembly, it will proceed in reverse. 

00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:04.820
This video is now complete, thank you for following it.
