00:00:00.774 --> 00:00:04.960
- [Voiceover] I find drawing
to be a very direct medium.

00:00:04.960 --> 00:00:07.625
You can see the artist thinking through,

00:00:07.625 --> 00:00:10.864
working through a compositional problem.

00:00:10.864 --> 00:00:14.580
It's the spontaneity, the lack of finish,

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.668
the process-oriented character of drawings

00:00:17.668 --> 00:00:20.610
that attracts me to the medium.

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:23.240
This is a drawing by Michelangelo,

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:24.525
one of the great artists of all time,

00:00:24.525 --> 00:00:27.686
and one of the sort of titans
of the Italian Renaissance.

00:00:27.686 --> 00:00:29.789
It's a multi-figured composition

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:32.447
that depicts Mary and Joseph on their rest

00:00:32.447 --> 00:00:34.627
in the flight into Egypt.

00:00:34.627 --> 00:00:38.746
The virgin, at once, pulls off her shawl

00:00:38.746 --> 00:00:40.746
in order to expose her breast

00:00:40.746 --> 00:00:42.733
for the Christ child to nurse.

00:00:42.733 --> 00:00:44.950
The child turns back

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:47.740
in this very, very complicated movement

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:52.345
to nurse backwards, exposing
this heroic musculature,

00:00:52.345 --> 00:00:54.645
that of course points to his divinity.

00:00:54.645 --> 00:00:57.473
The virgin is a mountainous figure,

00:00:57.473 --> 00:00:59.763
and I think in a symbolic way,

00:00:59.763 --> 00:01:03.002
meant to Michelangelo the kind of great

00:01:03.002 --> 00:01:06.534
power and protection of
the figure of the virgin.

00:01:07.887 --> 00:01:12.256
We tend to think about
drawing, for the most part,

00:01:12.256 --> 00:01:13.908
the standard idea is to think of it

00:01:13.908 --> 00:01:16.032
as a linear medium.

00:01:16.032 --> 00:01:18.463
Drawings are equated with line.

00:01:18.463 --> 00:01:21.862
But there are other
aspects of a work of art

00:01:21.862 --> 00:01:24.945
that artists can explore in drawing.

00:01:24.945 --> 00:01:29.124
For example, how they
actually lay on the paint,

00:01:29.124 --> 00:01:32.331
and I think this was a primary goal

00:01:32.331 --> 00:01:34.554
for Gainsborough in this drawing

00:01:34.554 --> 00:01:37.445
of a fashionable lady walking in the park.

00:01:38.831 --> 00:01:42.602
The chalk is laid down in
a very, very powdery way,

00:01:42.602 --> 00:01:45.095
so that we can feel these textures,

00:01:45.095 --> 00:01:47.423
we can see the gestures with which

00:01:47.423 --> 00:01:49.556
Gainsborough has applied them,

00:01:49.556 --> 00:01:53.329
but also not to be missed is
the coloristic aspect of it.

00:01:54.591 --> 00:01:56.388
Drawing is

00:01:56.388 --> 00:02:00.417
an extremely exploratory medium.

00:02:00.417 --> 00:02:04.602
It represents the thought
processes of the artist

00:02:04.602 --> 00:02:08.265
and it also represents a kind of

00:02:08.265 --> 00:02:11.652
exploratory attempt to find

00:02:11.652 --> 00:02:15.596
graphic expression for
one's creative ideas.
