00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.450
This is the Lenovo M57.

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:17.420
It is an Intel Core 2 Duo, packing..
 business monster is what I like to call it.

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:25.100
It's a 2.3 GHZ Intel Core 2 Duo processor 
inside, it's got 1 Gig of DDR2 RAM.

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:29.070
It can be expanded up to 8 GB though,
there's lots of room for expansion

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:31.670
in this PC, and one of the other things
that makes this PC so great

00:00:31.870 --> 00:00:33.940
is that it's very easy to service,
very easy to get into,

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:36.810
it's sort of an IT department's dream.

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.140
Of course, maybe you don't have
an IT department,

00:00:39.410 --> 00:00:41.880
maybe you're just a small business.
It's gonna be your dream too,

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:43.550
because if you need to swap out
a hard drive,

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:48.630
if you need to change out some memory,
the more time you're computer's down,

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:53.600
the more business your money is not making,
or the more money your business

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.560
isn't making, yeah, that's what it is.

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:59.530
So, very easy to service
and a big big selling point

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:01.230
for this particular PC.

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:03.600
80 Gig hard drive,
Vista business pre-installed,

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.880
gigabit Ethernet,
it does have an optical DVD drive

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:10.750
onboard as well
and intergrated Intel graphics.

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:12.720
Now, over here on the front
is where you're gonna find

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:18.390
a pair of USB ports, along with
microphone and headphone ports as well.

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:22.360
Your DVD reader is located right above those.

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.200
Now, it does also come with a nice keyboard
and a very nice mouse,

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:29.670
what you're gonna find
is a very nice typing keyboard

00:01:29.770 --> 00:01:33.510
and a solid optical mouse
that comes along with this thing.

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:37.080
Now, this computer can be oriented
either horizontally or vertically,

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.380
it does come with a stand,
so it is quite flexible in that regard.

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:45.080
It's also very easy to get into,
and I'll show you how to get into it

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:47.490
in just a second, right after we show you 
what's on the back here.

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:50.590
Couple of expansion slots
located right over here,

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:55.470
you do have Ethernet,
a bunch of USB ports, eSATA,

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.330
you have a parallel port,
you've got your serial port,

00:01:58.630 --> 00:02:00.670
you've got VGA,
you've got line-in, line-out,

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:03.870
and your microphone,
all on the back as well.

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:06.310
Now, getting into this
is very very simple.

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:09.380
As you see there's a button right here.
there's also a button over on this side.

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:12.010
And you push these buttons
to lift this up,

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:17.220
and you have instant access
to the interior of the PC.

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:21.630
Now, if you also lift this part right here,
which allows you to gain even more access

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:23.130
to the memory.

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:27.230
As you can see there are 3 available
memory slots in this computer,

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:30.800
so you can, as I said before,
get up to 8 GB.

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.900
You also have expansion slots,
located right up here,

00:02:33.010 --> 00:02:38.920
as you can see there's a PCI X16,
and a standard PCI express slot

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:40.850
located right there as well.

00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:44.180
You also have room for your hard drive
right here,

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:46.320
and one more bay,

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:50.020
you can actually stick a hard drive
right in here.

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.900
So, you've got plenty of space
for expansion in this particular machine,

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:57.420
and it's gonna do your business quite well.

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:02.540
Very easy to maintain,
very easy to use, is the Lenovo M57.

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:07.110

00:03:07.350 --> 00:03:12.820

and type in T70-9045.

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:15.020
For Computer TV, I'm Bower.
