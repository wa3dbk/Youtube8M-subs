00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:16.280
The sun comes out and at the same time, so
do many lovely cars and of course drop tops

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:17.790
really come in to their own.

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:23.401
The new Vauxhall Cascada is the replacement
for the Astra TwinTop and on the face of it

00:00:23.401 --> 00:00:25.670
looks like a massive improvement.

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:31.090
For starters, Vauxhall has ditched the folding
metal roof for a lighter fabric one (put the

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:34.800
roof up and point) and it is much better looking
with its stylish contours and large alloy

00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:35.840
wheels.

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:41.121
In fact it has a different concept, hence
the new name and slips in to the range in

00:00:41.121 --> 00:00:42.980
between the Astra and Insignia.

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:49.070
The boot is spacious and easy to load items
in and out of.

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:59.219
When you are not using the roof just slide
this back to create more room.

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:07.130
Plus you can flip the rear seats down at a
touch of a button

00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:17.420
We are in a top of the range Elite today so
are blessed with features and options including

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:23.609
these gorgeous leather heated seats, sat-nav,
climate control and parking sensors.

00:01:23.609 --> 00:01:30.270
The stitched leather dash certainly gives
it a more up market appeal as well.

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:36.439
The Cascada looks good on the road and the
roof will operate of speeds up to 30mph and

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:42.979
takes only 17 seconds, perfect for our constantly
changing weather.

00:01:42.979 --> 00:01:52.479
The Cascada has been designed to be more of
a cruiser than a sports car, so the ride is

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:57.979
soft and irons out most of the bumps in the
road.

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:02.999
Wind buffeting is suppressed with the roof
down so you can have a decent conversation

00:02:02.999 --> 00:02:07.770
with your passengers, well I suppose that
is down to who your passengers actually are,

00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:11.120
as mine won't talk to me.

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.159
Hello?

00:02:13.159 --> 00:02:15.910
What do you think of the Cascada?

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:20.260
I give up.

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:29.250
Instead I will enjoy cruising around with
the roof down and tell you about its fuel

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:30.250
economy.

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:34.980
There is a broad choice of engines, however
the most efficient is the 2.0 diesel returning

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:41.900
54.3 miles per gallon, although the best blend
of performance and economy will be the BiTurbo

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:49.360
diesel, which arrives in late 2013 and will
return the same economy but with more power.

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:56.710
If you prefer petrol there is a 1.4-litre
turbocharged engine and a new 1.6, which is

00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:00.220
only available with a 6 speed automatic gearbox
at first.

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:09.760
That returns 39.2 miles per gallon.

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:15.450
Time for the negative points, the Cascada
is not that fun to drive and has quite a lazy

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:16.450
throttle response.

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:19.790
Visibility is poor due to thick windscreen
pillars.

00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:26.150
Finally, it has pitched itself against the
Audi A5 cabriolet but claims to be £8,000

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:27.150
cheaper.

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:34.390
By the time you add all the options on including
essential things like the acoustic roof to

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:39.570
limit road noise, you have spent much closer
to the price of the Audi anyway.

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:44.420
I did not criticise the Audi for having a
dated interior, quite the opposite, the Cascada

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:56.670
though, well it is a brand new model and already
feels in need of an update.

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:16.100
Both suffer with head and legroom although
I think the Cascada slightly more as it is

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:21.259
a bit cramped even for me.

00:04:21.259 --> 00:04:28.349
However all that aside, if you don't get carried
away with spec it genuinely is £8,000 cheaper

00:04:28.349 --> 00:04:35.139
so you must ask yourself, do you have something
else that you would rather spend £8,000 on?

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:40.130
Overall the Cascada is smooth, easy to drive
and very good looking.
