00:00:00.429 --> 00:00:06.129
I’m going to start turning on and zeroing
out my scale with the container on the scale.

00:00:06.129 --> 00:00:15.430
That way as I measure the water I am only
measuring the weight of the water. One advantage

00:00:15.430 --> 00:00:23.480
of being outdoors. I am setting this aside.
The next thing I will do is measure out the

00:00:23.480 --> 00:00:30.860
lye. I find that it is a convenient step to
measure it in a baggie so that if you have

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:38.770
to carry this or handle this or if you have
to pause in the process you can close it up.

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:54.730
Once again, we will zero the scale;
6 ¾. Promptly cover your lye. That’s my

00:00:54.730 --> 00:01:04.140
bag. This is the mixing of the water and the
lye. Now it is very important, critical that

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:12.090
you add the lye to the water and not the other
way around. As I pour this in it is going

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:18.350
to get near boiling and so if you poured a
little water in this bag of lye, it could

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:24.620
explode. So I am going to pour this very slowly
and gradually. I am going to be very careful

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:33.979
that I don’t produce a lot of dust. As I
stir it I want to make sure that I don’t

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:38.490
get a lump in the bottom because it is real
hard to get rid of a lump once you created

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.659
it. I also lean back a little bit because
there is no way I am going to be breathing

00:01:43.659 --> 00:01:49.240
these fumes. It is getting very hot as I can
already tell just with my hands even with

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:54.079
gloves on and I found it kind of tends to
cake up on the spoon. You don’t want any

00:01:54.079 --> 00:02:01.619
kind of build up with the lye. The goggles
and the gloves always seem awkward and unnecessary

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:07.290
until I start doing this. You breathe a little
of those fumes and you start how feeling how

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:14.430
hot it gets and you realize how important
it is to protect yourself from this material.

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:19.870
Now it is all stirred together and insert
the thermometer. Make sure the bulb is not

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:26.579
hitting the bottom of the container just a
little above the container’s bottom, immersed

00:02:26.579 --> 00:02:33.079
in the liquid. I’ve got it turned to where
I can read it and sure enough we are already

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:45.040
at 175 degrees Fahrenheit. Now this is going
to cool down to about 115 degrees and it will

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:52.409
take a little while so while this is cooling
we are going to mix our oils and warm them

00:02:52.409 --> 00:02:54.560
up and we are going to prepare our molds.
