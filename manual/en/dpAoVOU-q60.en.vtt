00:00:01.494 --> 00:00:03.414
This is the day we met.

00:00:03.664 --> 00:00:07.168
You were by the surf.
I could just make you out
in the distance.

00:00:07.203 --> 00:00:09.880
I remember being drawn to you,
even then.

00:00:09.915 --> 00:00:12.023
I thought, "Wow, how odd!

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:14.133
"I'm drawn to someone's back."

00:00:14.342 --> 00:00:16.517
You were
in that orange sweatshirt

00:00:16.552 --> 00:00:20.140
that I would
come to know so well,
and even hate, eventually.

00:00:20.682 --> 00:00:24.895
But at the time I thought,
"How cool,
an orange sweatshirt."

00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:26.229
Hi, there.

00:00:28.482 --> 00:00:29.656
Hi.

00:00:29.691 --> 00:00:33.404
I saw you sitting over here
by yourself,

00:00:34.696 --> 00:00:37.366
and I thought, "Thank God,

00:00:37.532 --> 00:00:41.161
"someone normal who
doesn't know how to interact
at these things."

00:00:42.704 --> 00:00:45.333
I don't ever know what to say.

00:00:45.958 --> 00:00:47.502
I'm Clementine.

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:51.548
Can I borrow
a piece of your chicken?

00:00:52.424 --> 00:00:55.634
And then you just took it,
without waiting for an answer.

00:01:00.264 --> 00:01:04.018
It was so intimate,
like we were already lovers.

00:01:06.648 --> 00:01:07.897
I'm Joel.

00:01:08.982 --> 00:01:12.736
Hi, Joel.
So, no jokes about my name.

00:01:14.446 --> 00:01:15.496
You mean, like

00:01:15.531 --> 00:01:18.200
"Oh, my darlin', Clementine?"

00:01:18.784 --> 00:01:21.328
Huckleberry Hound?
That sort of thing?

00:01:21.363 --> 00:01:23.264
Yeah, like that.

00:01:23.299 --> 00:01:25.166
No, no jokes.

00:01:25.542 --> 00:01:27.710
One of my favorite things
when I was a kid

00:01:27.745 --> 00:01:29.921
was my Huckleberry Hound doll.

00:01:33.425 --> 00:01:35.593
I think your name is magical.

00:01:38.597 --> 00:01:42.100
This is it, Joel.
It's gonna be gone soon.

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:46.230
I know.

00:01:47.647 --> 00:01:49.108
What do we do?

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.362
Enjoy it.

00:02:11.006 --> 00:02:12.840
You married?
No.
