00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:19.000
Let’s face it:: The 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.030
best part of Pokemon is the toys.

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:26.000
And I don’t mean merchandising, I mean the
strange technology that humans are inclined

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.700
to create in a world filled with near-magical
monsters.

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:30.740
Case in point: The Pokedex.

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:34.160
Sure, it’s a crucial point of one of your
earliest fetch quests.

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:39.500
But when you get right down to it, who wouldn’t
want a device capable of scanning, cataloguing,

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:43.870
and dispensing information on whatever strange-looking
creatures you come upon?

00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:47.110
There have been imitations before, but we’ve
been waiting a long, long time for the kind

00:00:47.110 --> 00:00:51.829
of technological marvel that we were promised
back in ‘97.

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:56.320
Ladies and gentlemen, the wait is over.

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:02.350
Well, if you’re only concerned with the
latest generation, that is.

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:06.370
And given that Nintendo’s current policy
for their official Pokemon Championships allows

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:09.530
only the Generation V monsters, It’s the
most relevant.

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:14.080
Also, you don’t start with all the information;
everything aside from the starting evolutions

00:01:14.080 --> 00:01:18.220
and a few others requires either receiving
the data from a friend or just waiting for

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:20.960
your daily entry to be unlocked.

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:26.920
Even with this application that has no game
mechanics whatsoever, you have to wait for

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:27.920
unlocks.

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:31.570
But, worst case scenario, a couple months
later and you have the full roster.

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:34.600
So what can you do with them?

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:40.670
Well, the most obvious idea is to look at
the critters in 3D.

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:41.670
And they do look good.

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.270
You can even animate them with the push of
a button.

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.430
And just look at all that data.

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:51.390
Egg group, abilities, learned attacks, TMable
attacks, egg moves... pretty much everything

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.530
you’d get from one of the major websites.

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:56.890
Unfortunately, that “pretty much” means
you’re not going to get a complete breakdown

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:02.340
of base stats (instead you’ll have to settle
for a more abstract number of bars) or the

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:05.520
ability to search by, say, Special Attack.

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.009
Speaking of moves, they’re all listed here.

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:10.009
All of ‘em.

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:11.860
All five hundred fifty some.

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:17.480
Even moves like Conversion2, which aren’t
actually used by any fifth-gen Pokemon.

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:23.200
Leaving hope that eventually it will be expanded
to include all 600 and whatever number.

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:28.480
These attacks are even sortable by type, base
power, or how likely your opponent is to throw

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:30.640
his DS at you when you use it.

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:35.890
Don’t hate me, hate X-Scissor.

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:41.069
But the cutest little trick of the Pokedex
3D involves bringing the little critters into

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:45.530
our very own world, by means of black-and-white
marker codes that you can print out, load

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:52.140
onto your phone, or if you feel like having
some arts and crafts time, draw yourself!

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:57.170
Just fire up the AR camera, take a look at
the code, and blam, instant Pokemon.

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:01.769
And yes, this supports the 3D capability of
the screen, even if you can’t see it here.

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:05.520
The downside is that keeping optimal viewing
distance from the screen as you pan around

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:09.330
a code on a table or something can be a little
on the difficult side.

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:11.629
But Victini catches fire and flies around!

00:03:11.629 --> 00:03:13.370
That has to be worth something.

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:18.380
Sure, I can have my complaints; I’d much
prefer this software support the entire history

00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:21.099
of Pokemon and not just those from Black and
White.

00:03:21.099 --> 00:03:25.640
Because let’s face it, being able to look
at a Porygon in 3D like this just seems so

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:26.900
perfectly in the moment.

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:31.870
But the net result is that the Pokedex 3D
is a useful little tool, especially if you

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:34.390
need to look up a move on the fly.

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:38.000
And the price can’t be beat: It’s FREE.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.000
Gratis.

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:40.000
Kostenlos.

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.120
Zero dollars.

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:44.940
Just obtain it, and enjoy looking forward
to receiving a new Pokemon each morning.
