00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.190
The gaming industry you used to know...is
pretty much on life support.

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:26.580
Like it's been stabbed in the chest.

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.960
Alright, it's not that dramatic, but things
have really changed for gaming.

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:37.129
And one of its biggest and most problematic
changes...is the customer's perception of

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:38.129
the product's value.

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.480
These days, you can get great games...for,
like, 99 cents.

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.140
For a lot of people, that's made 60 bucks
seem ridiculous.

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.160
And that's something the industry has been
forced to adapt to.

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:52.830
Publishers are moving to digital distribution,
they're taking fewer risks...some are even

00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:55.470
doing games that are free, but they make you—

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:57.950
The first portion of this review was completely
free to watch!

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:01.110
And it's just $9.99 per minute to unlock the
rest of it!

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:05.610
Yes, Classic Game Room accepts...traveler's
checks.

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:08.330
If it seems too complicated, just send money.

00:01:08.330 --> 00:01:10.620
How about tens and twenties?

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:13.229
So, listen...I get it, alright?

00:01:13.229 --> 00:01:15.490
I get that it's not 1992 anymore.

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:18.740
I get that I can't just buy a game and get
the complete finished product.

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:20.710
It sucks, but hey...I get it.

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:22.100
Things have to change.

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:24.660
But not all of those changes are the right
changes.

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:29.510
The concept of freemium games has really caught
on, but...if they're not done right, they

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:31.720
come across as shameless cash grabs.

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:38.290
And I don't think I've ever played one as
shamelessly shameless as this one.

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:43.930
This is, like, begging...at this point.

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:50.130
Obviously, Spartacus: Legends is a freemium
game.

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:51.500
It's also a fighting game.

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.910
It gives players a whole army of slaves-turned-gladiators.

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:56.680
Actually, it gives you one slave.

00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:59.310
The army is gonna cost you, like, 20 bucks.

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:01.091
Nonetheless, there is an interesting structure
here.

00:02:01.091 --> 00:02:06.950
You move from map to map taking on various
warriors, unlocking new areas, leveling up...the

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.550
only thing is, the game makes you pay for
it.

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:17.000
With money and boredom.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:27.720
Look, this just isn't a good game in general,
but to pinpoint it...I think there are two

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:28.720
problems here.

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.090
The first of which is...the gameplay is just
kind of broken.

00:02:31.090 --> 00:02:35.870
I mean, you can do all kinds of different
moves—rolls, grabs, shield breaks, kicking

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:40.540
people in the balls—but all you really have
to do is spam the same attack over and over.

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:44.590
In fact, things actually get harder when you
try to mix it up and play the right way.

00:02:44.590 --> 00:02:46.140
I'm, like, terrible at fighters.

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:55.470
And even I know that sucks.

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:59.640
None of the fighters have any character, but
fortunately, there are enough weapons to give

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:00.640
the game some variety.

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:05.160
A guy with a spear fights a lot different
than a guy with two daggers, or a guy with

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:06.160
a sword.

00:03:06.160 --> 00:03:08.300
I mean, until you figure out what move to
mash.

00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:09.530
Then, it's lights out.

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:12.320
But hey, at least you can use all those weapons,
too.

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:18.390
And it's fun to experiment with them, and
learn all their different tendencies...

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:20.690
And which buttons to mash.

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:22.080
Seriously, guys.

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:24.160
It's freaking...Mashed Potatoes.

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:25.400
The Game.

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:36.740
The Revenge.

00:03:36.740 --> 00:03:42.459
But the second problem, the bigger problem...is
that Spartacus takes freemium to a whole 'nother

00:03:42.459 --> 00:03:43.459
level.

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:46.270
Things cost way more than you earn, which
is normal.

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:50.290
But then, the game makes you pay for even
the most basic functionality.

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:54.020
Like, in this fight, I earned a new perk for
my character.

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:55.480
Like, in the fight.

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:58.410
But to apply that perk, that I earned in the
game?

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:00.480
Oh, that's gonna cost you money.

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:15.989
REPLACING ITEMS WITH ITEMS YOU ALREADY HAVE
COSTS MONEY.

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:19.780
The gaming industry is in a weird state of
evolution right now.

00:04:19.780 --> 00:04:25.569
Hopefully, when we look back, we'll remember
games like Spartacus: Legends the same way

00:04:25.569 --> 00:04:28.150
we remember the human tail.

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:30.680
Something that was more annoying than useful.

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:42.130
And stuck to our asses.
