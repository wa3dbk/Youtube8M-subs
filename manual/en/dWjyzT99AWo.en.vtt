00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:14.040
 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:23.890
the room is one that when you walk
into

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:29.030
you realize something different is
gonna happen here

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:30.820
 

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:37.820
 

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:44.600
 

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:49.380
when we have classes in an interactive
learning space like this

00:00:49.380 --> 00:00:56.380
it tends to be noisier than a typical
lecture hall

00:00:58.290 --> 00:01:02.390
 

00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:03.899
walking in I think

00:01:03.899 --> 00:01:06.909
the thing that you see right off the bat
that strikes you

00:01:06.909 --> 00:01:10.000
is a lot of big round tables that

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.030
seat nine people.  Each of the tables has
their own

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:16.549
link-ups to a flat screen TV and we have
mics at our tables

00:01:16.549 --> 00:01:20.360
and at the same time you have the power
point on the slides on every computer

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.930
all around the room so it's this great space where

00:01:23.930 --> 00:01:28.159
technology and people intact to just
create a completely unique learning

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:29.000
experience

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.190
instead of being in rows where
students are facing a podium

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:38.399
students are facing one another and so it
forms a

00:01:38.399 --> 00:01:43.550
community issue come into this room and
it facilitates

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:47.810
both for students and for professors
doing something different than what

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:48.280
they've

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:51.649
done before. The whole day is planned
around

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:56.069
what are the students going to do so
that they can learn

00:01:56.069 --> 00:02:00.420
what I think they need to know about
this topic. But I do want you to now move

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:01.539
into Inquiry 3

00:02:01.539 --> 00:02:05.989
it's basically doing the same thing except
you have more than two sequences to look at

00:02:05.989 --> 00:02:06.650
 

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:09.350
we'll spend 10 minutes

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:12.090
working together as a team

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:16.490
learning concepts, learning how to apply concepts and so on

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:21.470
that's not typically done as well with me
just talking

00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:25.850
and students absorbing knowledge, it's really that practicing

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:30.290
it's about being able to demonstrate this and
for students to demonstrate to each

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:34.120
other what they know and what they don't
know. You really get to know your team

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:37.690
a lot over the course of the semester because
you're sitting at your table with them you're

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:39.610
doing class activities with them and

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:43.290
we worked outside of class we met up outside of class, we really were just friends

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:44.370
by the end of the semester.

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:49.160
in this class your grade is going to be
better

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:53.480
if your whole group does better and so
you have a responsibility just like we

00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.220
do in real life and just like we do

00:02:55.220 --> 00:03:00.070
in research laboratories and clinical
situations it's not an individual that's

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:02.060
responsible for everything it's the team

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:07.970
once you get to a research university
like this

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:14.190
we want to transition this from science
courses being about memorization of facts

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:18.370
in really about learning how to think

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:22.810
go ahead and align all these sequences
and look to see what kind of mutations have arisen

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:25.980
so what I'm looking for is where are you
describing

00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:31.420
this final molecule. When we refer to that as coding DNA, what does that mean?

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:34.459
It's not the template

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:38.989
Would it correspond to the entire message
or RNA sequence?

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:42.939
so what's missing

00:03:42.939 --> 00:03:45.570
It never felt like instruction, it was

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:48.770
more discussion, they'll give a little bit of instruction behind it but ask

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:51.000
questions what would you do now what do
you think

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.240
would be the next step. It made you have
a lot more interaction with your

00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:56.880
professors than you might have otherwise
and they were really approachable

00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:00.240
they're kind of just helping you with your
activities and a lot of times they're walking around the

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:01.030
rooms

00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:04.320
and you're asking them a lot of questions so that
was really nice to be able to just talk

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:05.710
to your professors but also

00:04:05.710 --> 00:04:08.830
have a kind of a different relationship
with them because they're not lecturing

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:09.350
you

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:12.980
it with them allowing us to figure it
out for ourselves but at the same time

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:15.230
being there when we needed help to guide us

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:19.540
They really were more like colleagues in
a sense

00:04:19.540 --> 00:04:22.990
just colleagues that knew a heck of a lot
more than you did.

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:26.660
One of the major assignments that
students work on during the whole entire

00:04:26.660 --> 00:04:27.840
semester is

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:33.220
a project that starts with the proposal
so we ask them to identify a problem

00:04:33.220 --> 00:04:37.890
of social value and to solve that
problem using genes

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:41.210
the region that makes it possible for 
this organism to

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:45.110
transfer its genes into another
organism is its virulence region here which

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:46.770
codes for proteins that excise

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:51.690
we found that if this holds that in gene
is

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:56.660
inhibiting my of that the muscle
will eventually grow

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:01.600
we wanted to reduce the amount of water
used by cotton to increase drought

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:02.470
resistance

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:05.970
they ultimately come to very interesting

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:10.590
very sophisticated very important
problems

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:13.760
and viable solutions for it

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:17.190
It was one of the key things that I liked about
this class

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:20.900
is you were learning without really knowing
that you were learning.

00:05:20.900 --> 00:05:22.460
Students would say I learned how to

00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:26.760
ask questions and learn
on my own and think about things

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:30.090
that's what we really are aiming for

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:33.500
that's what makes teaching fun
teaching this kind of space really fun.

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:35.020
 

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:39.159
I am actually doing the kind of
teaching that I've always wanted to do

00:05:39.159 --> 00:05:41.039
where I'm

00:05:41.039 --> 00:05:44.499
really getting to see.. really the light bulbs go on

00:05:44.499 --> 00:05:46.199
for students

00:05:46.199 --> 00:05:50.139
at the end of it, I had learned so much about
biology

00:05:50.139 --> 00:05:53.809
about what it was to be a scientist and
about myself because

00:05:53.809 --> 00:05:57.360
in a way uh you know the things that I
can achieve that I never thought that I

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:57.889
could

00:05:57.889 --> 00:06:03.430
you just think at the end of the semester
wow I learned so much

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:07.150
 

00:06:07.150 --> 00:06:07.930
 

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:08.760
 

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:10.990
 

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:17.990
 

00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:19.520
