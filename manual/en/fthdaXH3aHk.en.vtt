"Reducing Muscle Fatigue With Citrus"

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:09.918
The same lactic acid that 
makes yoghurt tangy 

00:00:09.918 --> 00:00:12.636
is the same lactic acid that 
builds up in our muscles 

00:00:12.636 --> 00:00:14.774
when we exercise strenuously. 

00:00:14.774 --> 00:00:16.861
Instead of bacteria fermenting 
the sugar in milk

00:00:16.861 --> 00:00:18.221
to make energy for themselves, 

00:00:18.221 --> 00:00:19.987
our muscles ferment 
sugar in our diet 

00:00:19.987 --> 00:00:22.637
to produce energy to contract. 

00:00:22.637 --> 00:00:25.868
If, like when we're sprinting, 
lactic acid builds up 

00:00:25.868 --> 00:00:28.212
in our muscles faster 
than it can be removed 

00:00:28.212 --> 00:00:31.270
we can end up with a burning 
sensation in our muscles,

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:32.884
forcing us to stop.

00:00:32.884 --> 00:00:35.631
Now, if we train we can increase 

00:00:35.631 --> 00:00:37.612
the number of blood 
vessels in our muscles 

00:00:37.612 --> 00:00:39.703
and clear out the lactate faster. 

00:00:39.703 --> 00:00:43.157
For example, if you take some 
overweight sedentary women

00:00:43.157 --> 00:00:45.894
and start them on an 
aerobic training program 

00:00:45.894 --> 00:00:46.999
of running and walking, 

00:00:46.999 --> 00:00:49.183
at the end of three months 
their lactate levels 

00:00:49.183 --> 00:00:52.220
during exercise decreased 17%, 

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:53.890
but those on the same program 

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:56.619
who drank 2 cups of 
orange juice a day 

00:00:56.619 --> 00:00:59.321
decreased their levels 27%.

00:00:59.321 --> 00:01:01.187
They did the same 
exercise program, 

00:01:01.187 --> 00:01:04.148
but the citrus group experienced 
a significant decrease

00:01:04.148 --> 00:01:06.532
in blood lactate concentration,

00:01:06.532 --> 00:01:09.052
signifying an improvement 
in physical performance 

00:01:09.052 --> 00:01:11.455
with less muscle fatigue.

00:01:11.455 --> 00:01:14.556
I don't recommend drinking juice, 

00:01:14.556 --> 00:01:16.730
because you're losing 
all that wonderful fiber 

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:20.089
that slows the rate of fruit 
sugar absorption into our system. 

00:01:20.089 --> 00:01:22.481
Here's the blood sugar 
spike one might see 

00:01:22.481 --> 00:01:24.956
after drinking coca cola. 

00:01:24.956 --> 00:01:27.185
Compare that to the spike 
you see with orange juice. 

00:01:27.185 --> 00:01:29.286
No difference. 

00:01:29.286 --> 00:01:31.257
But now what if you ate 
the same quantity of sugar 

00:01:31.257 --> 00:01:33.903
in the form of orange slices?

00:01:33.903 --> 00:01:35.222
Significantly lower.

00:01:35.222 --> 00:01:39.275
So the whole fruit is nearly 
always better than fruit juice. 

00:01:39.275 --> 00:01:42.430
Now this is not to say OJ 
isn't better than coke. 

00:01:42.431 --> 00:01:46.080
OJ has those citrus phytonutrients 
like hesperidin, 

00:01:46.084 --> 00:01:49.250
which may be why the women's 
triglycerides didn't go up 

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:52.660
even though they were drinking 
2 cups of fruit juice every day. 

00:01:52.663 --> 00:01:57.130
Hesperidin may actually help 
lower our digestion of fats, 

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:00.700
but once you get up to 
3 cups a day of juice

00:02:00.702 --> 00:02:06.360
you can really start 
bumping your triglycerides.
