Hi, I'm Bob Schmidt with HomeRemodelWorkshop.

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:08.240
I have a little bit of wall damage here
where I'm sure my wife or my son ran the car into

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:10.869
the back of the garage wall.

00:00:10.869 --> 00:00:15.719
Sure, I could take out my keyhole saw and my razor knife on the studs to cut this back for a repair

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:22.719
but I will show you a unique way to use a sawzall and get this out easily.  Let's get to work.

00:00:25.169 --> 00:00:30.000
Now after finding my two studs and putting
these two marks on the two studs

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.660
I went ahead and took a level and just leveled a line around here.

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.930
If I grabbed my sawzall the way
this is right now and just started cutting

00:00:37.930 --> 00:00:39.840
into here with my sawzall

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:44.010
a) I would be hitting that stud on this side and b) there is a potential

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.500
that there are wires or plumbing pipes

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.490
or something along those lines in there
that I really don't want to get into.

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:53.900
Here's a simple way to take care of that.
Putting your thinner blade in your sawzall

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:57.560
and making sure that your sawzall is unplugged,

00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:01.960
the first thing you want to do is pull
up on the sawzall extending this as

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:07.010
far out as it can go. I'm taking a
scrap of the material I'm cutting out

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:09.200
and set it on top of this guide

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.500
and I take a marker

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:15.990
and I go ahead and put a mark right at
where the top of that material is.  I'm taking

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:21.360
a pair of tin snips, go ahead to that thin blade

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.070
and cut it off right at the mark.  Plug your sawzall back in and you are ready

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:26.840
to cut out this patch.

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.200
The nice thing about doing it this way is

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:32.120
not only will cut out on the open spaces

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:35.100
but it will also cut right down on this stud

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:42.100
without bottoming out on the stud or doing any damage to the stud.

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.670
Now, as you see, using the sawzall like this

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.840
doesn't damage the stud and you can cut right down on the stud

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.920
it gives you a nice great breaking place.  All I did was take my knife, after I was

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.609
done cutting and clean up a little of the loose paper around the edges and

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:08.989
I'm ready to patch this back in.

00:02:08.989 --> 00:02:13.470
So there you go, a unique way of using an
old sawzall blade that might make

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.479
doing some repair work a little bit
easier for you and

00:02:16.479 --> 00:02:19.859
making sure that you don't do any damage
to any electric or any plumbing that may

00:02:19.859 --> 00:02:21.819
be inside that wall.

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:25.440
