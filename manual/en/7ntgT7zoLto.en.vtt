00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:04.670
there's a new mc romney active which is
pushing the false claim that chrysler

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:09.110
jeep is sending jobs to china mit romney
actually told the story etc and he had a

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:12.459
campaign event in defiance ohio last
week

00:00:12.459 --> 00:00:15.229
basically went out there he said i saw
story today

00:00:15.229 --> 00:00:17.689
that uh... what what exactly they said

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:21.749
that one of the great manufacturers in
this state jeep now owned by the attack

00:00:21.749 --> 00:00:24.939
italians is thinking of moving all
production to china

00:00:24.939 --> 00:00:28.960
romney was apparently thought responding
to reports on right wing blogs that

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:32.209
misinterpreted of bloomberg news story
so

00:00:32.209 --> 00:00:34.159
what's the actual story

00:00:34.159 --> 00:00:37.650
and what's the story mit romney is
talking about let's be very clear here

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:40.300
chrysler owns g

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:41.180
they said

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:44.680
jeep has no intention of shifting
production of cheap models outside of

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:46.140
north america to china

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:50.400
it's simply reviewing opportunities to
return jeep output to china

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.080
for the world's largest auto market

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:54.340
real story

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:58.060
they're looking at selling jeeps to
china to make money

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:02.110
romney story they're looking at
outsourcing the production of chiefs of

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:03.350
jeeps to china

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:07.110
see the difference lowest i know it's
nuanced one is the exact opposite of the

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:09.670
other but i could see what people would
be confused

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:13.710
there's a difference so that we got this
ad from mit romney this is the advocate

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:15.160
now

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:17.710
more regarding ministry

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:19.390
not morocco obama

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:24.550
frank checkers confirm his attack from
mit romney our house

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:27.930
mitt romney has a plan to help the auto
industry

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.650
he supported by lee iacocca and the
detroit news political bamaca g_m_ and

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:36.940
chrysler into bankruptcy penciled
chrysler to accounts were going to be

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:41.230
windy in china so then i mean you know
what's the honest

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:44.360
if lee iacocca is supporting mit romney

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.920
that's gonna we need a fundamental
paradigm shift

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.100
uh... about how we think of this
election i had no idea lee iacocca was

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.940
supporting that ron

00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:54.520
is there any are there any repercussions
for

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.630
ants that are completely false

00:01:56.630 --> 00:02:00.290
uh... yes interest on that on these were
great

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:04.350
of all let me tell you what doesn't work
of the the mainstream media calling

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:05.300
these out

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:08.380
uh... they're pretty much the only actor
in this whole bowl game they could

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:12.850
actually state you know put their foot
down and actually uh... come out against

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:15.980
it and maybe help people make an
informed decision but they're not doing

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.409
one final fact this ad

00:02:18.409 --> 00:02:22.479
there could be people out there who the
only at the ever seated on and say why

00:02:22.479 --> 00:02:25.719
they should be there should be legal
repercussions to lying in campaigning

00:02:25.719 --> 00:02:29.589
it's funny because and chrysler jeep is
actually bringing more jeep production

00:02:29.589 --> 00:02:32.469
to ohio to add about two thousand jobs
there

00:02:32.469 --> 00:02:36.049
so it's it's really sad that this is
these these lies what people are are

00:02:36.049 --> 00:02:37.450
hearing but that's that's the reality
