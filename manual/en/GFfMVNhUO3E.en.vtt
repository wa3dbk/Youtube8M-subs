Hi, this is Yolanda Vanveen from Vanveenbulbs.com.
In this segment we're going to talk about

00:00:06.939 --> 00:00:13.040
how to attract bluebirds to your garden. Now
we all love wildlife. There are so many different

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:17.730
animals and birds, that we can enjoy when
we have our garden. Whether it's just spending

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:23.150
an afternoon looking at the butterflies. Or
humming birds in your Crocosmia. There are

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:26.970
so many different little birds and animals
that we really enjoy in our gardens. And that

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:32.140
we want to attract. So Bluebirds are like
other birds. There's just a few things that

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:37.980
they need to survive. Now you've got remember,
in nature out in the wild. You usually find

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:46.909
Bluebirds in wide open fields with just a
few trees. And there's lots of fruit, berries.

00:00:46.909 --> 00:00:52.989
A lot of cherries and those apples, all kinds
of trees and shrubs that they can live in.

00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:58.870
They also need a lot of places to raise their
young. So in the wild they have old trees.

00:00:58.870 --> 00:01:02.629
When trees die, they're hollow. So they make
their homes inside the hollow trees. Well,

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:07.890
in our gardens, we don't usually have a lot
of hollow trees. So we can add lib a little

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.920
bit and enjoy the Bluebirds in our garden,
as well. So I might not have a lot of dead

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:17.759
logs on my property. But I do have a lot of
bird houses. And the key with the bluebirds

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:24.259
is, is you don't want the hole to the entrance
to the home. To be any larger than 2 inches.

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:29.030
Because you don't want larger birds or crows
to get in there and attack the babies. Or

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:35.200
get the eggs out. And just about two inches
seems to be the key. And Bluebirds and sparrows,

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:40.780
all love bird houses. And so I've got them
all over my property. And it gives them a

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:45.530
place to live. And we do have a lot of wold
areas in the neighborhood. That they can live,

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:50.720
as well. So they seem pretty happy in my garden.
The most important feature of your garden

00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:56.240
to attract birds. Any type of birds, especially
Bluebirds, is water. You cannot have birds

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:01.500
on your property without water. And the sparrows
and the Bluebirds and the Blue Jays just love

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:06.289
my little rock water fountain. And even this
morning, I saw a lot of them playing in there.

00:02:06.289 --> 00:02:12.560
And it's so fun to see them. And how much
fun they have in the water. And so, make sure

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:18.870
if you have any water features. Never ever
to add any chemicals. No bleach, no algae

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:24.080
reducers. Pretty much nothing. My key is to
make sure you do not put them in full hot

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:29.430
sun. So they don't get as much algae. And
also, I just drain all the water out and put

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:34.680
fresh new water in it. Just by adding the
hose to it for about an hour, once a week.

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:39.390
And that's about enough to keep the water
fresh for the birds. Bluebirds also need some

00:02:39.390 --> 00:02:46.820
kind of a food source. And they love sunflowers
and they love all types of berries. Blue berries

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:52.560
and black berries and raspberries and cherries.
And so if you have a lot of different fruit

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.450
trees on your property or even wild berries.
Or any wild areas near you, they'll be really

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:03.660
happy. And I really enjoy all of the Bluebirds
on my property. And just by adding some bird

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:08.200
houses. Making sure you have some berries
and a couple water features. You'll be amazed

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:09.480
how the birds will enjoy your property too.
