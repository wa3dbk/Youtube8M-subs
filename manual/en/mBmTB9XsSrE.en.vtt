00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:08.429
Hey everybody.

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:14.219
It's me, Margaret, with notes on this Addi Nutcracker scarf that I did.  I've done two other

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:21.209
color-block scarves like this.  One was a Santa, one was a snowman, and so I'm not gonna go over the

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:28.499
demonstration of the AddI in building this scarf.  The Addi machine, if you're interested, there'll be links in the description box.

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:34.079
I'm also going to put written notes on my blog, which is sheepishlysharing.com.

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:37.380
So you can find the measurements for each of these blocks.

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:40.889
Now the best part about these kinds of

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:45.959
scarves is that they're basically just a tube and therefore, can easily be worked up in--Well,

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:53.939
this, like I said was done up. Addi Express knitting machine. You can crochet it, knit it, or loom knit it.  Now

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:58.739
I've recently had someone asked me, "Well. I'm ready for the loom knit instructions."  Well

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:04.829
I don't know what they are because I've never done them on a loom. That's why when I design the little scarf

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.610
I always provide you with

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:13.169
measurements, so that it gives you an idea of the proportions of what I've done.  And if you want to copy it then,  you know,

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:16.739
you create your own three-inch scarf, and probably done on a small--mine

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:20.939
is blue,  My smallest, round Nifty Knitter loom.  And--and

00:01:21.850 --> 00:01:24.809
use your own creativity, choose your own colors,

00:01:25.689 --> 00:01:30.209
decorate any kind of way that you want to.  Make it your own, and you'll probably come up with better ideas.

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:36.720
Mine's just a base to give you a foundation on which to build.  So, yeah, have fun.

00:01:37.750 --> 00:01:44.250
Here's the hat and it's approximately three and a half inches or what works out to be seventeen Addi rows.

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:47.040
As for the French knot decorations,

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:52.259
I suggest you go look up on YouTube how to do it, because clearly I'm not the person to teach you!

00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:58.589
Now here's his little face, which is around two and a half inches or twelve to thirteen Addi rows.

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:04.530
I couldn't find any shank-backed googly eyes, so I used buttons, sewed them on first

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:07.799
and then attached regular googly eyes with jewelry glue.

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:13.649
For the Nutcracker's beard and mustache, you'll need about twelve pieces

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:17.130
of white yarn cut at about three inches.

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:23.309
I took an extra piece to bundle four of them together for his mustache and eight of them together for his beard;

00:02:23.739 --> 00:02:26.489
pretty simple.  If you need to see me do this,

00:02:26.489 --> 00:02:32.429
I'll put a link in the description box that will pop you right over to this exact spot in the Santa scarf video.

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:39.450
In case you're wondering, I attached mine at the seventh and ninth rows on his face.

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:46.930
And after I sewed them on, then I trimmed them up, okay?  So they're shorter.

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:51.279
Now, we left Santa's long on there. This is a completely different deal.

00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:58.600
I also would encourage you to try a little hair on the sides.  When I had originally designed it--sorry--I

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:01.480
Was planning to put hair and

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:04.880
I

00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:08.619
don't know why I chose not to do it, 'cause now I'm kind of thinking I want to do it.

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:12.040
My nutcracker has a simple double-breasted coat,

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:18.219
these tiny, tiny little buttons that I already had on hand, but look at some other pictures to get ideas.

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:23.649
Some have braids across the front and gold, and there's just different options.  Dress him up.

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:31.599
Hindsight's always 20/20, and I'm thinking after looking at it that I may have benefited from another black stripe

00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:33.820
beneath the drum,

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:34.970
but

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:40.630
It--it's fine like it is.  And then you just add some of those, you know, decorations on the side of your drum

00:03:40.630 --> 00:03:42.630
and there you go.

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:48.219
And I would encourage you, as with any of my ideas that I throw out there,

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:51.160
I want you to use your own creativity and to embellish,

00:03:51.860 --> 00:03:54.010
build on what I have and make it better.

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:59.380
So I'd love to see pictures if you do any of these.  I will tell you that it's a little time-intensive

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:05.559
to do the embroidery. I don't know how to do embroidery. I'm not going to do a tutorial for you.

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:07.660
You're gonna have to look elsewhere for those tutorials.

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:11.410
Clearly that's not my strength.  But, um,

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:16.119
Yeah... so... there he is!
