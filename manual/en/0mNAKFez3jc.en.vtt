Hi my name is Amitha Punnoose and I'm from Madras Christian College

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:12.360
in Chennai, India and right now I am in South Australia

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:14.650
with the University of South Australia

00:00:14.670 --> 00:00:17.690
doing an international student exchange program.

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:20.740
I'm doing my field placement here with Campbelltown Primary School

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:23.790
and they have a Sudanese project there which

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:26.850
actually works to help the Sudanese parents get into the

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:29.890
school and be comfortable with the school and also

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.930
to help them to make the children integrate into the system

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:37.960
much better and I also work with the year four and five

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.010
sorry, five and six children and we

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:44.070
I'm planning to do group work with them to help them to

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:46.730
improve their collaborative skills

00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:48.720
so I'm looking at both of these projects as in working

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:51.070
with the Sudanese children as well as to work with the

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.790
group work to improve their collaborative skills.

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:56.840
The refugee communities, we actually have not started

00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:59.880
working with them but we have organised a barbeque

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.930
that the previous student who had been here in Campbelltown

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:05.970
from India and she had organised a barbeque get together

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:09.030
for the parents, so we are continuing, planning to continue the

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:12.080
barbeque so that we get to have the parents come into the school

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.110
and also discuss about issues concerning them

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:18.140
and we are going to look into the issues and help

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:20.320
them to sort out. For example there are things like

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.600
the language and things like violence

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:26.630
you know, violence is more seen as a solution to them so

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:29.670
helping them to solve all that and especially

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:32.720
Campbelltown is wonderful because Campbelltown has a

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:35.780
multicultural setting. In the same class there will be children from

00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:38.830
six to seven nationalities. So, helping them to accept

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.860
each other and to integrate within the Australian community

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:43.390
so that's what we are looking at.

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:46.420
Yeah, out here I have actually become so much

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.450
culturally sensitive because working with a lot of cultures

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:52.470
and when I go back to Channai I want to continue my...

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:55.510
now I have become more like a global social worker

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:58.550
so when I get back to Chennai I would want to put in all

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:01.600
the skills that I learned here and also to do a lot

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:04.660
of reflective social work as in every step that I do to

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.040
reflect on how it could have been done better or what I did is right.

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:09.560
So, that's what I'm looking into and

00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:11.940
work more with children because that's my passion.

00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:14.100
I come from Chirala in India, but then I've

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:15.610
moved to Chennai to do my studies

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:19.360
so moving on to a new place was... it's nothing new to me.

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:22.400
but then coming to Adelaide was totally different because

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:25.450
the way the academic system here

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:28.090
the way the field workers practice, everything was different

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.130
but then I found, being in Adelaide, I mean I was scared of

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:34.190
how people would be but then I find this place really

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:37.270
people were being really helpful. As in, anybody that I

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:40.340
asked questions of, if there is a clarification

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.380
that I need, well people help you so much that you feel you're

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.440
part of the system. I mean you don't feel like an outsider anymore because

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:49.500
you're so much accepted. I guess it's because of Adelaide's culture

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:52.040
where you don't just have the Australians, but you have

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:54.460
the Italians, the Greeks, the Indians, the...

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.110
name it and you have them here.
