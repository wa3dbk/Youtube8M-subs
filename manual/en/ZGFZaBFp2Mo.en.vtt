Hello everyone, my name is Nilsor and welcome to The Dragon Cook Tavern

00:00:04.725 --> 00:00:10.831
In this show I’m going to propose to you recipes to bring food and beverages from video games into real life

00:00:11.449 --> 00:00:12.466
Today we are going to make

00:00:12.466 --> 00:00:16.523
the recipies for two of the most famous sodas in the Fallout universe

00:00:16.523 --> 00:00:17.584
Nuka-Cola 

00:00:18.046 --> 00:00:20.012
and Sunset Sarsaparilla

00:00:20.771 --> 00:00:22.987
In the game the Nuka-Cola is made of

00:00:22.987 --> 00:00:24.309
carbonated water

00:00:24.309 --> 00:00:25.619
caramel color

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:26.746
aspartame

00:00:26.746 --> 00:00:28.077
phosphoric acid

00:00:28.077 --> 00:00:29.649
potassium benzoate

00:00:29.649 --> 00:00:30.791
natural flavors

00:00:30.791 --> 00:00:31.927
citric acid

00:00:31.927 --> 00:00:33.119
and caffeine

00:00:33.309 --> 00:00:36.254
For a regular bottle of 250ml

00:00:36.254 --> 00:00:38.025
or 8.45 oz

00:00:38.025 --> 00:00:39.989
the things we will need are going to be 

00:00:40.484 --> 00:00:44.257
160ml or 5.4 oz of Cola

00:00:44.257 --> 00:00:47.721
90ml or 3 oz of Carbonated water

00:00:47.721 --> 00:00:49.693
1 teaspoon lemon juice

00:00:49.693 --> 00:00:52.205
1/2 teaspoon of Vanila Extract

00:00:52.711 --> 00:00:54.001
For the Sunset Sarsaparilla

00:00:54.001 --> 00:00:56.011
the game doesn’t indicate its recipe

00:00:56.011 --> 00:00:56.755
but we know that

00:00:56.755 --> 00:00:58.077
it is a root-beer-type 

00:00:58.276 --> 00:00:59.719
carbonated beverage

00:00:59.719 --> 00:01:00.663
With that in mind

00:01:00.663 --> 00:01:02.605
the things we will need are going to be

00:01:02.605 --> 00:01:05.481
for 1 regular bottle of 250ml

00:01:05.481 --> 00:01:07.369
or 8.45 oz

00:01:07.369 --> 00:01:10.941
80ml or 2.7 oz of Cola

00:01:11.305 --> 00:01:11.990
Root Beer

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:12.945
And Ginger Beer

00:01:13.468 --> 00:01:15.093
1 tablespoon of Orange Juice

00:01:15.262 --> 00:01:17.445
1 teaspoon of fresh Lemon Juice

00:01:17.747 --> 00:01:18.682
And 2 Cloves

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:21.340
Now let’s do it

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.788
The instructions are fairly easy for both

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:27.671
Pour all the ingredients in order into their respective bottle

00:01:27.671 --> 00:01:29.237
with the help of a funnel

00:01:32.142 --> 00:01:32.527
Stir it

00:01:32.527 --> 00:01:35.282
but don’t shake otherwise you’ll be in for a surprise

00:01:36.151 --> 00:01:39.446
Close the bottle and let it chill in the fridge until serving

00:01:55.289 --> 00:01:56.074
And voilà!

00:02:03.725 --> 00:02:06.445
