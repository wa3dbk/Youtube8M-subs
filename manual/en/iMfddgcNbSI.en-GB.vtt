00:00:01.930 --> 00:00:08.620
I won Evolution which is kind of a world championships
in America, in Las Vegas. I won that twice.

00:00:08.620 --> 00:00:13.100
I then featured in the Guinness Book of World
Records for winning the most number of tournaments

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:17.500
world wide on multiple fighting games. Which
is over 450 tournaments and is the most number

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:24.280
of countries travelled to, to win tournaments
between 1998 and 2011.

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:35.720
I think my heaviest week was a trip from UK
to LA to Brazil to Sweden all in a row and

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:43.140
it was 75 hours of travel, which was 7 flights
within 7 days. I've already been to US 5 times

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:47.040
this year. Ive been to France, Sweden, Italy.
Coming up I have Australia, two different

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:54.050
parts of Brazil, another Sweden event, Portugal.
It's pretty never ending to be honest.

00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:00.380
So Street Fighter is played on a two-dimensional
platform, where two characters will be used

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:05.700
by the players to gain victory. And it's about
learning how to use each character which can

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.729
take up to 6 months per character.

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.640
My favourite character on Street Fighter is
probably Sagat, he's the character that I

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:22.770
use the most. I like Sagat because he can play
both a very strong defensive game and a very

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:26.580
strong aggressive game. I do like to mix it
up, I like to be unpredictable for the opponent

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:31.560
I don't like them to have an idea of what
I'm going to do.

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:40.360
My dad plays poker competitively so he knows
all about psychology and mind games and playing

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:43.180
for money.
At first when you play a game like Street

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:47.159
Fighter you just press all the buttons, but
when you get into the system of the game and

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:50.990
you learn that all the moves are actually
used for certain purposes in the match.

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:56.370
It's like watching a game of chess if you didn't
know how to play it, it would look very monotonous.

00:01:56.700 --> 00:02:01.409
I've noticed that I seem to have a stronger
drive than most players. A lot of players

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:06.049
will not want to go that far. They'll be
really good and then at some point they'll

00:02:06.049 --> 00:02:08.409
say 'na its not for me anymore'

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:14.260
I've noticed that all my hobbies tend to involve
hand-eye coordination of some kind and using

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:18.739
the body in some way because I also did martial
arts as well. So martial arts, breakdancing,

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:24.079
drumming, gaming are all to do with coordination
or rhythm of some kind.

00:02:28.299 --> 00:02:32.019
Video gaming is definitely an addictive thing.
Being a determined person I've always wanted

00:02:32.019 --> 00:02:34.279
to be the very best that I could.

00:02:35.609 --> 00:02:40.590
I know that this as a hobby has a sell by
date but I'm not really sure where mine is.

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:45.159
I always give thanks to God for every victory,
for everything that I win. Everything I get

00:02:45.159 --> 00:02:49.399
in life I always thank Him because if it wasn't
for Him I don't think I would have anything.
