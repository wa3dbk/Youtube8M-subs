00:00:04.799 --> 00:00:09.740
Star Horizon is a new rails shooter releasing
on Steam that's actually a port of a mobile

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:11.179
iOS game.

00:00:11.179 --> 00:00:16.090
But is the port any good and does it stand
on it's own playing the PC version on Steam?

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:20.390
I've had a chance to test it for a few hours,
so let's find out in this first impression

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:28.160
of Star Horizon.

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:33.600
Many would immediately compare Star Horizon
to the old school Starfox Nintendo games mainly

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.840
because there's not a lot of rail shooters
these days.

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.810
Star Horizon is not a Starfox clone, it's
a sci fi shooter.

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:45.519
There is a struggle between the Inter Galactic
Corporation known as the Federation and the

00:00:45.519 --> 00:00:47.130
Rebel Alliance.

00:00:47.130 --> 00:00:52.571
You play as John a private pilot of the federation
and your companion is Ellie the AI on your

00:00:52.571 --> 00:00:53.571
ship.

00:00:53.571 --> 00:00:57.640
Your role is to find out what's really happening
in this war.

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:01.399
There's simple cutscenes that take place over
voice communication and there is plenty of

00:01:01.399 --> 00:01:22.700
banter between John 
and Ellie.

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:27.520
The voice acting fits and helps the game flow
a little better, but the story is not incredibly

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:28.520
deep.

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.490
Although the game was originally designed
for touch screens, the PC version supports

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:34.330
Xbox controllers.

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:37.440
Your ship is outfitted with your primary weapon
the laser.

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:41.850
But you have to be lined up directly behind
enemies in order to hit which is different

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.890
from typical rails shooters and a little difficult
to aim, but you get used to it.

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.800
Then you have homing missiles and torpedos
which have unlimited ammo, but are on a cooldown.

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:56.420
Both your weapons and armor can be upgraded
in the hanger in between missions.

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.690
There's also a dodge mechanic which comes
in handy.

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:04.240
Combat is fast and keeps you busy but there
are moments when the difficulty increases

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:07.040
significantly for certain sections.

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:11.510
Even on easy certain sections seem difficult
to pass without upgrades due to the amount

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:12.510
of enemies.

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:16.510
I wish the difficulty scaled a little better
in these sections.

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:21.880
As far as the port from Mobile to PC, there's
a lot of benefits but a few disadvantages.

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:26.580
The graphics are nice and it even supports
anti aliasing and ultra settings.

00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:31.080
Your ship and your the effects of your attacks
look very detailed and the space atmosphere

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:32.080
is immersive.

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:35.870
I still feel like the primary weapon shooting
needs to have a reticle with a bit of lead

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:37.860
time like in Starfox.

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.130
Then in the hanger upgrades section the scaling
seems off.

00:02:42.130 --> 00:02:47.170
Running 1080p, the menu options are fair sized,
but the text on the ship upgrades is so small

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:48.170
it's illegible.

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:52.780
There's not a lot of space rail shooters on
Steam and this game is pretty fun for a short

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:53.780
ride.

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:56.510
Check it out on Steam if you want a fun space
shooter.
