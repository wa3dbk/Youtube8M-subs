00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
“Raisins vs. Jelly Beans
for Athletic Performance”

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:12.090
After about an hour of strenuous exercise,
long-distance athletes can really start

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:17.000
to deplete their glycogen stores—
the body’s source of quick energy.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.030
Studies dating back to the 30s found
that by hooking athletes on a treadmill

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:25.730
up to an IV drip of sugar water,
you could delay fatigue,

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:28.140
and that drinking sugar
water could help as well.

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.940
So, the sports supplement industry has
come up with an array of energy drinks,

00:00:33.940 --> 00:00:36.069
shots, gels, bars, chews—

00:00:36.069 --> 00:00:40.120
even sports jelly beans,
used (what a coincidence!),

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.229
by the Jelly Belly Cycling Team.

00:00:42.229 --> 00:00:46.179
In fact, the Jelly Belly Candy Company
paid for a study that found that

00:00:46.179 --> 00:00:52.309
said sports jellybeans could shave four
or five seconds off of a 10K cycling trial,

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:54.440
compared to sports drinks or gels.

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.679
But, what about compared to raisins?

00:00:58.679 --> 00:01:02.420
Given that “professional, collegiate,
and recreational sporting events

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:06.799
are supplement centered and heavily
marketed to, athletes at all levels

00:01:06.799 --> 00:01:11.280
may be left with the impression that
‘specially designed’ supplements

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:14.090
are essential for optimal performance.

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:16.759
Yet, these products are often expensive

00:01:16.759 --> 00:01:21.219
and cheaper, natural foods that
may provide a healthier alternative

00:01:21.219 --> 00:01:23.270
are often overlooked.

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:26.950
There are low-cost, natural
food products rich in [carbs],

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:28.409
such as sun-dried raisins…

00:01:28.409 --> 00:01:31.350
that have the potential to improve
performance to a similar degree.

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:34.929
[R]aisins are nutritious,
convenient, typically palatable,

00:01:34.929 --> 00:01:39.250
and are a cost-effective source
of [concentrated carbohydrates].”

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:42.109
But, do they work as well?

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:45.479
They work exactly as well.

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:47.289
Exact same time.

00:01:47.289 --> 00:01:51.420
Same thing comparing raisins
to a commercial sports gel—

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:57.130
same respiratory exchange, same carb and
fat oxidation, same energy expenditure.

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:00.590
In fact, the only significant difference
between raisins and jelly beans

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:03.229
was in “hedonic scores”—

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:04.840
pleasantness scoring—

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:08.450
and, raisins beat out the jelly beans.

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:12.319
Compared to jelly beans with
flavors like “Extreme Watermelon,”

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:22.520
there was a greater preference
for just raisin-flavored raisins.
