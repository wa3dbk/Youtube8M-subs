00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.300
Would you believe?

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:09.840
you can

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:10.340
have feelings

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:12.240
for someone you have never met before? 

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:20.740
I wouldn’t have believed it

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:26.920
until it happened  to me.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:29.240
(Happy birthday to you)

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.220
The first time I got to know her

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:37.760
was when I happened to see this photo. 

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:41.860
It’s a beach photo with “Happy Birthday” written on it. 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.660
I’ve always wanted to celebrate my birthday at the beach.

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:48.640
But never had a chance to. 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.920
I clicked to see, in her Instagram.

00:00:53.880 --> 00:00:56.540
She uses the name “29”.

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:01.060
She has no followers and she doesn’t follow anyone.

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:05.700
After looking through many photos,

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.020
I found out we like many of the same things. 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:13.840
She became my inspiration

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.820
to do what I always thought of doing,

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:19.040
but never got around to

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:22.800
(Yay!)
And I did it. 

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:28.540
(MISS YOU)
But 

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:30.480
she’s probably seeing someone already.

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:34.620
Actually

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.280
being friends this way is already good enough 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:39.440
because

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:41.140
I’m not ready.

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:45.780
I created a new IG account.

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:48.220
I named it

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:49.760
“365”

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:51.820
and

00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:53.960
I clicked to follow her. 

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.660
I am her only follower

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.900
and she is my only follower too.  

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:08.440
I was so surprised.

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.720
We got along so well, I could hardly believe it.

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:16.400
We can talk about everything.

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.300
(Happy New Year!)

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:36.500
Today

00:02:37.260 --> 00:02:39.580
I want to tell my only follower... 

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:42.940
“Happy New Year”. 

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:48.160
Thank you for making me feel happy every day.

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:03.200
(I’m not a happy pill)

00:03:04.020 --> 00:03:05.420
After that

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:07.680
she posted a photo of a restaurant

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:09.840
 very close to my house.

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:12.400
So I decided

00:03:13.100 --> 00:03:16.320
to take this chance to meet her this one time.

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:21.540
I didn’t get to meet “29”

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:23.720
instead I ran into Ney.

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:28.520
Ney is my ex-girlfriend. 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:35.160
(Just walk away, really?)

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:37.040
(How could you?)

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:40.340
(No hello?)

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:43.300
(We are just strangers now?)

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:44.860
We’ve been

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:46.560
broken up

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:48.520
for over a year now

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:57.380
In the beginning it was great, we got along in every way.

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:01.060
We were always together.

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:08.500
But

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:11.900
after a while

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:21.540
she started to nitpick and we argued about everything.

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:47.240
It got to a point 

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:49.720
that I got so tired 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:54.320
that breaking up seemed better.

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:03.320
I miss her.I think about her everyday

00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:05.740
but felt

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:08.460
 breaking up was better for us.

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:11.300
It’s the best way. 

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:18.180
After that day,

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:21.520
I checked on 29’s IG. 

00:05:21.620 --> 00:05:23.620
(I’ll never regret loving you)

00:05:23.620 --> 00:05:26.900
(I’ll never regret loving you)
It was the picture

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:28.940
Ney drew of me.

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:31.180
On it she wrote,

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:32.940
“I’ll never regret loving you”.

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:41.860
29

00:05:42.920 --> 00:05:44.360
is Ney. 

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:50.840
And everything she posted

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:53.620
and wrote...

00:05:53.780 --> 00:05:56.020
(MISS YOU)
MISS YOU

00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:02.180
All this time, I...

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:05.460
I’ve been falling in love with my ex-girlfriend.

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:15.120
I will never let her go again. 

00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.020
I’m not sure 

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:24.300
how things will turn out.

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:25.540
But

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:28.080
today

00:06:28.560 --> 00:06:31.020
just getting to see her is enough for me.

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:39.160
I’ve never regretted loving you either.

00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:43.320
The one who used to make you happy, 
where is that person now?
