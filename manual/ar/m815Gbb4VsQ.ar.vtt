00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:19.240

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:05.460
The camera falled

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.760
lets continue .. its ....

00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:13.360
i really want to say its not good

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.400
but the bacon ...

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.560
Moah &lt;3

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:33.780

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:38.520
thats it ..

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:40.740
we eat pork , and moaah &lt;3 ..

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:42.940
nothing happened , I recommend it

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:45.240
but there is one thing u should know

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.520
the first thing this is not pork

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:48.120
good ..

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:49.300
dont believe it ..

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.580
but thats a reply for someones

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:53.760
some people made me infidel

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:56.140
too much comments i deleted

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:02.660
some pepole said im infidel, punk ,non-believer .. bluh bluh bluh

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:04.180
lets show you

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:06.340
this bacon i bought

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:08.040
its from (The Danop/Saudian company and stores)

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.620
good..

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:11.980
they call it Turkey , and its know at all

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.940
its right (bacon/the word) .. or the translate of the word

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.600
is .. Cured meat or stick .. whatever

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:22.560
but there is things out of here , known as (Turkey Bacon and beef bacon)

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:27.420
i mean there is burger from it , turkey and pork

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:31.580
God takes us away from it (pig meat is forbidden in islam for scientific and religious reasons)

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:32.940
but...

00:02:33.140 --> 00:02:34.920
im saying ..

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:35.840
dont believe anything

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:38.600
i mean .. by reason something inside saudi arabia

00:02:38.980 --> 00:02:39.840
good...

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.060
We got it

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:42.140
its sure that it will be without pig meat

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:45.800
specially something big and famous like McDonalds  , etc ..

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.080
all of this under food control

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:49.020
its impossible that this will be pig meat

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.940
i dont know how i have too much pepole saying that its pork

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.340
so the bacon is species

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.680
so if i said its bacon and im in saudi arabia

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:00.840
so its sure that we all will know that its not pork

00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:05.520
we just have to species here , beef and turkey

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:11.480
and the second thing .. dont believe this idiots who make challenges and play with you guys

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.720
they r just savages

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:16.220
at the end of the clip i want you to know few things quickly

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:22.960
first thing i just made this clip for those who made me infidle and said bad things about me

00:03:23.220 --> 00:03:24.920
and they have not saw anything (the source of that bacon .. etc)

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:25.420
good..

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.620
and the problem is that im in Saudia Arabia !!

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.220
and there is some people at the begaining of the vedio who really believed that im eating pork

00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:31.380
Sooo....

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:36.720
dont believe anything , and the second thing dont say bad things about your brother in islam

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:38.840
they said .. there is one of ancestors in islam

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:40.760
he say about (good thinking about people)

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:46.960
he said ( if i saw a brother for me in islam his beard is full of beer , i will think that it poured on him)

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:52.100
it means .. think good about your muslim brother

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:55.780
and he said .. (if i saw  a muslim brother saying im your greatest god , i will think that he is reading Quran)

00:03:55.900 --> 00:04:00.560
there is a verse in Quran talking about Feron (an egyptian tyrant lord) was saying im your greatest god

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:05.600
i mean .. there is too much youtube clips needs good thinking

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:07.100
thats all what we need on youtube

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:11.480
and just dont believe any challenges clips .. etc ,, its full of lying

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.400
and dont believe anything again .. good thinking about people

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:17.040
thats everything i want to say ..

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:20.260
Naif-s was with you , see ya after Eid inshallah , Assalamualaykom
