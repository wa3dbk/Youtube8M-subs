00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:04.740
Carnivorous plants have evolved effective traps for catching prays.

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:08.380
Let's watch how work especially snap traps of Venus flytrap,

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:10.080
flypaper traps of sundews

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.180
and pitfall traps of Trumpet pitcher plants.

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:19.340
Most people consider as the typical and the most interesting carnivorous plant the Venus flytrap.

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:25.520
At the end of their leaves are traps that look like jaws.

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.460
The edges of traps contain glands that secrete nectar to lure prey.

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:37.060
Once the insect disrupts clusters of small hairs on the outside of the trap, flytrap spring to attention.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.680
When the prey continues to wander on the trap, 

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:45.020
it stimulates at least one of the trigger hairs and the trap snaps quickly.

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:53.060
Flytrap seals its trap hermetically, enlaces the prey and starts digestion.

00:00:56.780 --> 00:01:00.320
It opens in about two weeks time.

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:05.200
There is not much left, just an indigestible body.

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:12.240
To prevent from needless snapping of the traps, for example during the rain,

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:20.440
the trap reacts only after stimulating the trigger hair twice in 2 to 20 seconds.

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.480
Primary snap can take only Â½ second.

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:30.980
The trap imprisons its prey and gradually seals itself hermetically.

00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:38.240
Sundews have flypaper traps

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.100
Their leaves are covered with hair that known as tentacles.

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.160
The tentacles secrete sticky mucilage that looks like dew.

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:52.960
These drops contains enzymes and organic acids which able the plant to digest prey.

00:01:53.340 --> 00:02:02.140
Tentacles are able to move to prey and digest trapped insect more effectively.

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:12.080
Sundews usually hunt small insects while bigger ones are strong enough to save themselves.

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:19.760
Some sundews evolved more efficient strategies.

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:27.660
They have longer or even movable leaves and as the prey tries to escape, it sticks again and again.

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:32.680
Look how the Cape sundew can bend its leaf.

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:38.220
Pitfall traps are specific for Trumpet pitcher plants.

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:42.700
Their trumpet-shaped leaves are slightly covered.

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:46.780
As you can see, the cover and the entrance into tube are coated by nectar.

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:52.260
Lickerish prey searches for more and more sweet nectar and continues deeper into the trap.

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:53.720
It is unable to climb out.

00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:57.740
The prey drops inside the trap and the pitcher plant digests it.
