00:00:01.641 --> 00:00:09.079
How a baby lion and a tortoise sang a song

00:00:13.963 --> 00:00:17.507
There once lived a baby lion in Africa.
His name was...

00:00:17.607 --> 00:00:19.376
- Rrrr-meow.

00:00:19.476 --> 00:00:21.985
That's right, his name was "Rrrr-meow."

00:00:22.803 --> 00:00:27.242
One time, he went for a stroll
in the desert, and there he met...

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:31.906
- A biiiiiig tortoise!

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:38.382
The tortoise was lying in the sunshine
and humming a merry little song.

00:00:53.194 --> 00:00:54.365
Can you hear it?

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:58.775
- I am lying in the sun.

00:00:59.429 --> 00:01:03.253
And I'm having lots of fun.

00:01:03.528 --> 00:01:07.490
Lots of fun in the sun.

00:01:07.697 --> 00:01:11.451
And the fun has just begun.

00:01:11.793 --> 00:01:15.137
- What a cute little song.
I'm going to get a bit closer.

00:01:15.237 --> 00:01:19.925
And he did get a little closer, but
the tortoise did not notice him

00:01:20.132 --> 00:01:23.439
because she was singing with
her eyes closed tight with pleasure.

00:01:26.435 --> 00:01:30.707
- A giraffe-raffe-raffe is tall

00:01:30.845 --> 00:01:34.910
Crocodile-dile-dile can crawl

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:38.768
Only I'm having fun

00:01:39.181 --> 00:01:43.040
As I'm lying in the sun.

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:47.139
Baby Lion crawled right next to
the tortoise and curled up in the sand.

00:01:47.414 --> 00:01:49.550
Then he raised one of his ears.

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.408
- Yes, that's so I can hear better.

00:01:55.854 --> 00:01:59.540
- There's a lion lying near

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:04.018
And he's playing with his ear

00:02:04.118 --> 00:02:08.117
Only I'm having fun

00:02:08.217 --> 00:02:12.354
As I'm lying in the sun.

00:02:12.454 --> 00:02:15.971
The tortoise finished her song
and opened her eyes.

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:23.033
- Good afternoon. I'm Big Tortoise.

00:02:23.133 --> 00:02:24.859
And who are you?

00:02:24.959 --> 00:02:28.613
- Me, I'm Baby Lion, Rrrr-Meow.

00:02:28.923 --> 00:02:32.609
I really like your little song.

00:02:35.916 --> 00:02:39.602
- I am sitting in the sun

00:02:39.702 --> 00:02:43.426
I am having lots of fun

00:02:43.701 --> 00:02:47.422
Lots of fun in the sun

00:02:47.938 --> 00:02:51.004
And the fun has just begun.

00:02:51.104 --> 00:02:52.279
- It should be "lying," not "sitting."

00:02:52.379 --> 00:02:54.415
- You're the one lying. I'm sitting.

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:59.030
- A giraffe-raffe-raffe is tall

00:02:59.444 --> 00:03:03.061
Crocodile-dile-dile can crawl

00:03:03.474 --> 00:03:07.091
Only I'm having fun

00:03:07.191 --> 00:03:10.777
As I'm sitting in the sun.

00:03:11.225 --> 00:03:15.772
- And yet, you should sing "lying,"
since I'm the one who wrote the song.

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:21.042
- How can I sing "lying" if I'm sitting?

00:03:21.594 --> 00:03:25.899
- Then lie down and all will be right.

00:03:25.999 --> 00:03:29.310
You will be lying down and singing.

00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:33.340
Like so: "I am lying in the sun."

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:36.991
- But I don't like lying down,
I like running.

00:03:37.091 --> 00:03:39.920
At the very least sitting.

00:03:42.572 --> 00:03:46.154
- But you were lying down
when you crawled toward me.

00:03:46.637 --> 00:03:50.288
- I only did that so I could listen
to the song.

00:03:50.388 --> 00:03:54.077
I only lie down on special occasions.

00:03:55.214 --> 00:04:00.175
- How do you sleep then? Sitting up?

00:04:00.725 --> 00:04:01.725
- No.

00:04:02.035 --> 00:04:03.447
No, I sleep lying down.

00:04:03.547 --> 00:04:07.477
But when I sleep I don't sing, right?

00:04:07.856 --> 00:04:14.470
- Just pretend that you're sleeping
and singing at the same time.

00:04:15.504 --> 00:04:16.778
- I'll try.

00:04:17.295 --> 00:04:20.257
Let's start from the very top!

00:04:22.703 --> 00:04:23.703
Aaaaaand go!

00:04:23.803 --> 00:04:27.422
- I am lying in the sun

00:04:27.522 --> 00:04:31.487
And I'm having lots of fun

00:04:31.587 --> 00:04:35.311
Lots of fun in the sun

00:04:35.411 --> 00:04:39.203
And the fun has just begun.

00:04:39.303 --> 00:04:42.510
- It's still not right, because I sleep
with my eyes closed.

00:04:42.610 --> 00:04:44.508
And that means I can't see the sun.

00:04:44.608 --> 00:04:49.503
- Then open your eyes and pretend that
you sleep with your eyes open and sing.

00:04:49.603 --> 00:04:51.088
- All right, I'll try.

00:04:51.604 --> 00:04:52.638
Aaaaaand go!

00:04:53.017 --> 00:04:56.599
- A giraffe-raffe-raffe is tall

00:04:56.909 --> 00:05:00.767
Crocodile-dile-dile can crawl

00:05:00.867 --> 00:05:04.488
Only I'm having fun

00:05:04.763 --> 00:05:08.346
As I'm lying in the sun.

00:05:08.446 --> 00:05:11.481
- Now you sing alone, because
I can't sing about myself.

00:05:11.581 --> 00:05:15.304
- There's a lion lying near

00:05:15.404 --> 00:05:19.300
And he's playing with his ear

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:23.399
Only I'm having fun

00:05:23.499 --> 00:05:26.017
As I'm lying in the sun.

00:05:38.556 --> 00:05:41.519
- Wow, that's a very nice song.

00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:44.860
Wonderful, just wonderful song!

00:05:45.687 --> 00:05:48.580
And now can we play horsies?

00:06:48.898 --> 00:06:53.135
When it got dark, they parted.

00:06:53.235 --> 00:06:56.924
- Good bye, my dear Big Tortoise!

00:06:57.406 --> 00:07:02.194
Will you... will you come up
with a new song tomorrow?

00:07:03.124 --> 00:07:07.809
- Of course. Come by tomorrow.

00:07:08.154 --> 00:07:09.325
- Okay.

00:07:09.738 --> 00:07:12.115
See you tomorrow!

00:07:18.970 --> 00:07:22.071
- A giraffe-raffe-raffe is tall.

00:07:22.622 --> 00:07:25.894
Crocodile-dile-dile can crawl.

00:07:26.652 --> 00:07:29.580
As he walked, he kept on wondering.

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:33.404
- How can you sleep with your eyes open,

00:07:33.783 --> 00:07:36.194
and even sing a song at the same time?

00:07:36.642 --> 00:07:38.226
I don't get it.

00:07:38.674 --> 00:07:40.087
Only I'm sitting down...

00:07:40.293 --> 00:07:41.602
Oops, I mean...

00:07:41.912 --> 00:07:45.529
Only I'm having fun

00:07:45.629 --> 00:07:48.113
As I'm lying in the sun.

00:07:57.620 --> 00:08:00.100
The end.

00:08:00.857 --> 00:08:01.857
