00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.660
Who's there?

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:16.220
It's me, mailman Pechkin.
I brought an article for your boy.

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:20.180
Who's there?

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.740
It's me, mailman Pechkin.
I brought an article about your boy.

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.420
Who's there?
- NO ONE!

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:32.420
It's me, mailman Pechkin.
I brought an article about your boy.

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.940
Who's there? Who's there? Who's there?

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:40.940
Who's there? Who's there? Who's there?

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:49.020
Who's there?

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:54.660
It's me, mailman Pechkin.
I brought an article about your boy.

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:09.660
Boy missing: Uncle Fedor,
47 inches tall...,

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.020
sought by his parents.

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.860
whoever finds him gets a
reward--a new bike.

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:25.820
Don't be sad, Uncle Fedor!
There's lots of boys like that around

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:32.700
Maybe many.  But not all of them get
shiny new bikes either.

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:38.420
Now I'm going to take measurements
of your boy.

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:46.060
My mom and dad,
I live very well.

00:01:46.180 --> 00:01:48.220
Simply excellent!

00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:52.420
I have everything I need... Whoa!

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:26.140
My mom and dad,
I live very well. Simply excellent.

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:33.020
I have what I need.  I have a house.
It's warm.  It has a room and a kitchen.

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:37.780
I miss you very much,
especially in the evenings.

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:42.100
But my health is not so great.

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:46.300
Either my paws are aching,
or my tail keeps falling off.

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:02.180
And the other day I started to shed.

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:06.620
The old fur is coming off
all over the house.

00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:10.460
But the new fur grows in its place
clean and silky

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:14.100
Thus my shagginess has increased.

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:19.540
So long,
your son--Uncle Sharik.

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:29.300
What did he say increased?
--Shagginess.

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:33.020
Now he can sleep on the
snow in the winter.

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:35.300
I don't understand anything.
Maybe we've lost our minds?

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:38.780
Maybe it's our shagginess that's
increaased? And it's us who can
sleep in the snow?

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:42.580
We can't lose our minds both at once!
People lose it one at a time!

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:45.300
It's only the flu that people
get together all at once.

00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:50.940
Hello! I am mailman Pechkin
from Prostokvashino.

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:56.420
Are you the ones who give bikes
in exchange for a boy?

00:04:10.300 --> 00:04:14.500
--It's your fault that Uncle Fedor
has fallen ill.
--Why mine?

00:04:14.580 --> 00:04:18.180
"Why mine, why mine?"
You're the one who fed him cold milk

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:22.420
You even boasted: "look what cold milk
my cow yields!"

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:24.900
"No need to buy a fridge"!

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:29.420
--Who's there?
- Family. - Family.

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:33.980
In this weather, family stays home
and watches some TV.

00:04:34.180 --> 00:04:37.700
Only the strangers are out and about.
We're not opening the door!

00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:42.300
Отворете!
Това са татко и мама.

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:54.380
Open it,
It's my mom and dad visiting!

00:04:54.540 --> 00:04:59.740
You see the condition they've
put your child into.  They must be
sent to the clinic at once... for
research purposes.

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:09.780
Where do you keep raspberry?
- Here you go, please.

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:13.820
Wow, I never knew that cats
could be so intelligent!

00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:16.900
I thought they only knew
how to shout in the trees.

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:21.260
Big deal...I even know how to sew

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:24.780
...and can even work on the
sewing machine.

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:37.820
You do as you please, son, but
we're taking you back to the city.
You need to be taken care of

00:05:38.060 --> 00:05:42.540
And if you want the cat and Sharik,
bring them right along!

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:47.380
We have no objections.
- Well, Matroskin, will you come?

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:53.820
I would, if I were alone.  But
what about my cow and the household?

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:56.900
And you, Sharik?
- We're gonna stay.

00:05:57.220 --> 00:05:59.420
Better if you come visit us
on vacations.

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:01.860
And on the weekends.

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:10.157
Hold on! Hold on!

00:06:10.853 --> 00:06:12.860
Here, take him!

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:16.820
It will be more fun with him.
- Who's that there?

00:06:16.900 --> 00:06:21.620
It's me, mailman Pechkin.  I
brought a comics magazine.

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:27.900
Oh, how rude of us...
We completely forgot about PEchkin.

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:35.500
That's ok, he is so annoying.
- Excuse me, why was I annoying?

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:42.060
Because I had no bike.
But now I will instantly become kinder

00:06:42.700 --> 00:06:47.940
And I'll adopt some pet
to make life merrier.

00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:53.220
You come home...
and it's just happy to see you.

00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:02.500
Come visit us in Prostokvashino!

00:07:06.820 --> 00:07:10.220
THE END
