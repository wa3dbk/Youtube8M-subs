 Hello everyone, annyeong !

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:11.000
For this first tutorial we're going to present you SKINFOOD's balm, which you can buy on mabbcreme.fr 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
while associating it with party make-up

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:25.010
Here is a short overview of what you will need 

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:36.000
This is our model Tsuki, one of our blog's writer, who kindly accepted to be part of this video.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:42.000
We're going to start with the eyes. To highlight Tsuki's blue eyes, we are going to use this copper colored eye shadow

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:49.000
For this video we used sleek's cosmetic palette, but you can use any eyeshadow you like.
Apply the eyeshadow to the eyelid with an eye shading brush

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000
Apply the eyeshadow to the eyelid with an eye shading brush

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Then blend with a tapered blending brush

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:12.000
For the shading, we're using black eyeshadow with a smaller brush but you're free to use your own equipment

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:25.000
Apply the black eyeshadow to the outer corner of the eye and blend the  borderline between both of the colors

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:46.000
If you want to take off some marks do not hesitate to use Q-tip to clean them

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Apply black eyeshadow to a third of the eye's bottom as well

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000
For the inner corner of the eye, we've made a mix between two bright colors

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:45.000
After that, we're going to use a liner with a small angled brush
To have the same shape on both eyes, do some mark with the liner before starting

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000
Take a smaller brush for the inner side of the eye

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000
And now, the mascara

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:17.000
And here is  this month product ! SKINFOOD's balm is  known for its natural impression and good performance

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:33.000
We're starting with the apricot tint
We can apply it, either with a sponge or your own fingers, we're just going to tap a little bit

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:38.000
It smells nice and it's really cute. You can apply it on both lips  and cheeks
 


00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:44.000
While applying it we realize it's really easy to do ! It boosts your complexion and give a radiant complexion without being too much

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:04.000
Then powder to fix the complexion, you can use either a loose powder or a compact powder

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000
Here is the result

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000
Before and after 

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000
