presents

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:10.640
A Stop (Hitch) in Paris

00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:15.200
it's over with her, I made chit

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:16.300
She will never come back to me

00:00:16.300 --> 00:00:19.800
It is not by deploring you your fate and crying on your own that she will return

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.800
It's not sexy a man who is crying

00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:25.420
with the nice authorization of utilisation of the musics

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:30.980
and I'm sure that she made his life like hell

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:33.400
and he's an asshole of going out with her

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:34.760
instead of being with me

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:43.440
Go ahead, you're here for that, go dancing !

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:02.620
Fred, nice to meet you

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:04.620
Stella, Nice to meet you

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.460
but you know, it's not because you are sad and angry, that you can argue with everybody

00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:09.560
you can't understand

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:45.180
and yet front, dancing was all my life

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:47.500
and you don't miss your Island too much ?

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.860
oh yes

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:52.020
I miss it terribly

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:54.060
I hate the life here

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:56.540
Are you gonna make contest you also ?

00:01:57.220 --> 00:01:59.500
No, but anyway, it's not of your business

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.520

00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:02.720

00:02:03.020 --> 00:02:05.160
It's not that bad... for non professionnals

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:08.980
Let's move out !

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:10.060
Why ? What's wrong ?

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:13.360
Honnestly, I hate her already and I don't even understand Why you're still loving her

00:02:38.460 --> 00:02:40.160

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:40.918
