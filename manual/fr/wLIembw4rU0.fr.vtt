00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.120
Few days ago, took place the Milan motorcycle show

00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:30.440
There, we obviously saw the new bikes for 2015 

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.120
But in Moto Journal, we decided to show you everything

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:34.860
hostesses

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:36.140
stars

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:38.560
stranges prototypes

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:39.640
hostesses

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:41.900
good Italian food

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:43.600
awesomes videos

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:44.820
hostesses 

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:46.340
and big parties

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:50.340
Uh, did i mention that we’ve seen hostesses too?

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:55.720
When you go to a show, the first thing to do is to wear a good pair of shoes

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:57.960
Well, this is the conferences list

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.480
As you can see, it’s start in Hall 14, then Hall 4, Hall 14, Hall 6… 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:04.100
So, we brought a pedometer, to see how much kilometers we walk today

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.400
Because, from one press conference to another, you walk a 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:10.820
again .... again… And again…

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.040
For our first rendez-vous, we landed at Honda’s

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.760
Where the world's leading manufacturer unveiled with sounds and  lights two prototypes

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:31.320
So, two protorypes. True Adventure, it’s a trail bike, 1000 cc, wich is in an off road environment. 

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.800
This is a prototype, but it’s very close to the real model

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.100
It will arrive in approximately one year in Honda’s dealers. 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:48.380
The second one, RC213 VS, for Street Version. 

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:52.860
This is Marc Marquez’s race GP bike adapted to the road. 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:58.840
It will be for real fans who want to enjoy on an ultimate bike, extreme and rare. 

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:04.600
Well, don’t be too excited, the RC213 road version won’t be here before 2016

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:10.920
And if Honda has not released an official price, the beast should cost more than € 200,000. 

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:12.800
It’s hurt, isn’t it ?

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.220
In the kind of crazy motorcycles, Kawasaki maked a little surprise too

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:21.760
After the H2R and its 326 horsepower, we’ve seen the H2

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:27.220
A quieter homologated version, because it « only » develops 200 horsepower

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:32.100
The originality of these two Kawasaki is obviously the air compressor 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:35.960
that swallows, on the R version, more than 200 liters / seconds

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:41.660
This turbine in aluminum, CNC machined, is expected to rev at 130 000  RPM 

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.020
when the engine will be near the red zone

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:47.720
Sounds like a proper ass kicking bike ! 

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:54.760
Well, time is flying, so we have to move our asses. Express visit of the other stars of the show

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:02.840
Here are the long-awaited Suzuki GSX-S 1000 and 1000 F

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:06.940
Suzuki feared so much for its new bike to go unnoticed 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:10.220
that they hired the less dressed hostess of the whole show.

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:11.600
Hop, few hostesses

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:12.939
Hello Madam 

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:14.201
Miss

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:17.760
This is the KTM 1050 Adventure

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:22.700
Close to its big sister's looks, but with a smaller 95 horsepower twin cylinder 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:24.360
and a more affordable price.

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:30.020
Still hostesses

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:31.840
we say hi to the camera

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:37.260
In Milan, BMW presented in world preview its S1000 XR

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:45.240
A sport trail with 160 horsepower, akward looks, and Multistrada Ducati rival

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:52.680
Hostesses, again

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:54.500
But from the back. It changes a bit!

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:03.220
Well, we made 8.12 km in one day

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:05.000
Not so bad. Our feet hurt a little bit

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:06.260
But, it’s not finished ! 

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:10.620
Among the stars of the show, two are missing : the Scrambler and the R1

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:14.220
But Ducati and Yamaha always do things differently

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:19.240
And both brands have chosen to organize their presentation in prestigious Milan locations.

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:21.840
A presentation, it always starts with numbers... 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:25.440
then there are motorcycles 

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:26.400
 speeches 

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:27.980
applause

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:29.780
and sometimes, things like this happen

00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:32.480
Kind of body modern art

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:37.760
And finally, here is the Scrambler

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:39.820
A small roadster with retro looks

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:47.260
powered by a 803 cc air cooled Vtwin wich features 75 hp, fo dry weight of 170 kg

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:53.480
As for the price, depending on the version, it varies between 8590 and € 9990

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.300
As for our national pride, the designer of the new Ducati gem is French! 

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:00.420
His name is Julien Clément.

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:03.680
I made some drawings for the Scrambler project

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:09.460
And they liked them instantly because it was a modern interpretation of the Scrambler

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:13.900
It was a mission they gave you or you had some personnal sketches ?

00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:16.360
I had my own sketches

00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:21.160
and the idea of a modern interpretation of the scrambler born like this

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:23.440
They made differents drawings in the past

00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:29.260
but Ducati liked very much my ideas so they decided to start the project

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:30.660
And now, one very important question

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:34.620
Is it possible to be the Scrambler designer without a beard and a checked shirt ? 

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:37.060
Yes, it’s possible. Because i never had a beard

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:38.960
And because It doesn’t want to grow. 

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:40.980
It’s not a selection criteria ? 
No, it’s not. 

00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:47.960
After each presentation, there's a cocktail

00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:50.580
And there, you try to be well-mannered... 

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:52.660
Well, at Moto Journal, we do what we can

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:56.620
Finally, the last one, the Yamaha conference.

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:01.880
Ho, my phone !

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:04.800
Sometimes, presentations are really selective

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:07.320
Presentations are like clubs 

00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:09.440
But with much more men !

00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:12.140
If you're not on the list, you can't get in

00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:15.480
And you’re  ashamed in front of all your colleagues

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:20.960
After a loooong day, you deserve your reward

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:29.160
To see Valentino Rossi himslef, the Moto GP idol, 9 times world champion, introducing the new R1

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:34.820
And when Rossi explains how he took part to the R1 development

00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:37.740
how he tried to make a machine as close as possible to the M1

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.920
you know that Yamaha has built a real missile. 

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:16.680
200 hp, 199 kg, titanium rods

00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:23.800
magnesium subframe and wheels, aluminum fuel tank, hi-tech electronics... 

00:07:24.300 --> 00:07:26.120
We can’t wait to ride this beast !

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:28.840
But for the moment, it’s time to party ! 

00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:30.800
Another aspect of Milan Motorshow !
