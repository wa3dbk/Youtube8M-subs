00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:41.096
The photo is my creative way.

00:00:41.216 --> 00:00:44.016
The photo is my means for speaking,

00:00:44.136 --> 00:00:45.141
to create,

00:00:45.261 --> 00:00:48.375
to express what I deeply feel.

00:00:48.495 --> 00:00:51.770
Is that I express with colors,

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:53.129
shapes,

00:00:53.249 --> 00:00:54.372
materials.

00:00:54.492 --> 00:01:01.360
I express it, so others have the pleasure to understand what I do.

00:01:06.081 --> 00:01:10.253
What I want to pass as idea, as intention,

00:01:10.373 --> 00:01:14.519
it is to let know and make realize to the spectator,

00:01:14.639 --> 00:01:19.531
that there is an evolution in the paint and the plastic arts.

00:01:19.651 --> 00:01:26.727
That, now, we have new technologies at our disposal.

00:01:26.847 --> 00:01:35.252
That photography must be considered as a  plastic art with its own technologies,

00:01:35.372 --> 00:01:37.736
such as painting art.

00:01:39.792 --> 00:01:44.761
Martine Anciaux has mastered a new grammar of shapes and colors.

00:01:44.881 --> 00:01:47.503
She takes us into a different universe,

00:01:47.623 --> 00:01:49.800
where the photography gets married with the painting.

00:01:50.561 --> 00:01:51.944
Geometric shapes,

00:01:52.064 --> 00:01:53.795
aspects of landscape,

00:01:53.915 --> 00:01:55.178
abstraction ...

00:01:55.298 --> 00:01:59.444
Martine Anciaux was able to bring us a new way of seeing.

00:01:59.564 --> 00:02:04.304
My research was based at beginning on a realistic photography,

00:02:04.424 --> 00:02:10.121
and I started  to think that it was possible to go further, towards abstraction.

00:02:10.241 --> 00:02:14.691
Towards a "photographic abstract paint"

00:02:14.811 --> 00:02:18.183
It was the purpose, the way, of my years of research,

00:02:18.303 --> 00:02:21.244
that I have now reached.

00:02:23.798 --> 00:02:28.814
For me the photography must go further to "transmigrate" towards the  paint,

00:02:28.934 --> 00:02:31.166
even more "transgress" the paint,

00:02:31.286 --> 00:02:35.830
to have its own status and its own originality.

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:38.666
So that the gallery owners,

00:02:38.786 --> 00:02:41.468
the museum world,

00:02:41.588 --> 00:02:43.741
can recognize this new photographic art.

00:02:43.861 --> 00:02:46.601
A new art in the 21st century.

00:02:50.805 --> 00:02:53.092
A new method of photographing,

00:02:53.212 --> 00:02:56.149
but also a new method of painting.

00:02:56.269 --> 00:02:58.566
This is the "photo-paint" of Martine Anciaux...

00:02:58.686 --> 00:03:01.355
A marriage of our century,

00:03:01.475 --> 00:03:06.959
which also allows the technology and aesthetics in intersection.

00:03:08.764 --> 00:03:12.491
Martine Anciaux, offers in this way a new working model,

00:03:12.611 --> 00:03:16.090
which allows to combine paint and photography

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:17.871
in a dimension of osmosis.

00:03:19.278 --> 00:03:20.614
Also, sometimes,

00:03:20.734 --> 00:03:23.110
Martine Anciaux, presents his work on a easel painting,

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:26.228
to accentuate this dimension of his universe ...

00:03:29.197 --> 00:03:31.998
I am a "painter-photographer".

00:03:33.486 --> 00:03:35.596
I handle the color.

00:03:35.716 --> 00:03:37.481
I handle the forms.

00:03:39.583 --> 00:03:44.104
The art of photo actually allows me to paint

00:03:44.224 --> 00:03:49.216
my photographs with digital tools,

00:03:49.336 --> 00:03:53.730
no problem, as a painter uses his brushes.

00:03:55.277 --> 00:03:59.355
I feel myself, as a painter.

00:03:59.475 --> 00:04:00.808
I am a "painter-photographer",

00:04:00.928 --> 00:04:02.668
a "photographer-painter" ...

00:04:04.172 --> 00:04:08.367
This "photo-painting" is called "Wings".

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:13.030
I consider myself as a digital artist,

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:14.928
painter of  numerical.

00:04:17.131 --> 00:04:19.405
We are in a new age.

00:04:21.056 --> 00:04:27.009
We have possibilities to create "photographic-paintings"

00:04:27.129 --> 00:04:28.907
or "photographs-paintings".

00:04:30.979 --> 00:04:32.573
After several years of research,

00:04:32.693 --> 00:04:35.292
Martine Anciaux has mastered a new grammar,

00:04:35.412 --> 00:04:38.409
to apply a new logic in contemporary art.

00:04:41.266 --> 00:04:42.532
From geometries to lyricism,

00:04:42.652 --> 00:04:43.821
shapes and colors,

00:04:44.243 --> 00:04:47.477
is a set of features and lines that Martine Anciaux

00:04:47.597 --> 00:04:49.646
painted with numerical tools.

00:04:49.766 --> 00:04:53.724
In the same way as the painter's brush can go on the canvas.

00:04:53.844 --> 00:04:55.435
Martine Anciaux painted

00:04:55.555 --> 00:04:59.419
with numerical medium new formulations of abstract landscapes ...

00:04:59.539 --> 00:05:02.264
In the night she knows how to create lighting and lights.

00:05:02.384 --> 00:05:04.116
Luminosities

00:05:04.236 --> 00:05:07.631
which can sometimes go beyond the traditional palette of artists ...

00:05:08.944 --> 00:05:09.764
Landscapes,

00:05:10.863 --> 00:05:12.855
brightness, colorful waterfalls,

00:05:12.975 --> 00:05:14.426
abstract lights

00:05:14.546 --> 00:05:17.004
on all graphics and colors registers.

00:05:17.124 --> 00:05:19.207
Martine Anciaux may also evolve in this modalities

00:05:19.327 --> 00:05:21.012
to formulate abstract landscapes.

00:05:22.718 --> 00:05:24.522
A pictorial camera lens,

00:05:25.694 --> 00:05:27.358
exceptional  luminosities,

00:05:28.999 --> 00:05:32.069
label the modernity of new messages and new signs.

00:05:37.619 --> 00:05:45.026
My intention was with the photography to make a painting ...

00:05:45.146 --> 00:05:48.119
When a spectator at present,

00:05:48.239 --> 00:05:49.174
or a visitor

00:05:49.294 --> 00:05:51.460
come to see my photos,

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:53.756
and says to me "What a beautiful painting !"

00:05:53.876 --> 00:05:59.077
I think I succeeded in what I hoped to do.

00:05:59.197 --> 00:06:03.466
Now this technique is a detailed technique.

00:06:03.586 --> 00:06:05.505
Has for many years.

00:06:05.625 --> 00:06:08.545
It was the purpose, the object of my research ...
