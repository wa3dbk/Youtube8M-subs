00:00:03.420 --> 00:00:06.060
[Male voiceover] I think you're born with it, you know?

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:07.489
You've got to love to fly.

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:10.780
It's this love of flight, that really unites us.

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.400
It's actually quite magical when you see

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:16.860
an airplane show up at the gate, because of the number of moving pieces there are 

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:20.280
Fuel trucks hooking up. Lines are getting swapped out. Catering's going.

00:00:20.480 --> 00:00:22.760
You've got ticket agents, you've got baggage coming in

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:25.100
and when it all comes together and the doors are closed

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.040
and you finally push back

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:29.032
It's really neat to see

00:00:29.095 --> 00:00:31.095
[Female voiceover] The job is all about teamwork.

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:34.960
You know, you can't do it on your own. You have to have a team behind you. 

00:00:35.119 --> 00:00:37.119
We depend on each other.

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:39.980
[Pilot voiceover] We work 365 days a year.

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:42.380
We don't shut down. So all of us have had

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:45.580
Christmases away from home, and that's with your family that you miss.

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.520
We've all been there. There's not one person in this business who has not gone through that.

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:53.520
We take our job very seriously every single flight...

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.200
and that doesn't change. Our standards don't change.

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:00.560
We still operate with the same level of integrity. 

00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:04.800
The only thing that's different is that we have this sense of realization that...

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:11.280
...for our passengers, it's that much more important for them to get home for the holidays.

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:18.840
[Female voiceover] You see everyone waiting, you know for their family members, for their relatives...

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:25.480
and everybody is so excited, it's just such a happy time when they reunite with their family.

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.340
[Male voiceover] It can be tough. You miss your family.

00:01:32.379 --> 00:01:34.379
You never get used to it.

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:37.540
[Female voiceover] It's a very satisfying feeling...

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:43.260
...to bring joy and happiness to people.

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.340
[Male voiceover] There is no doubt, when you do meet 

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:49.440
Canadians over the holidays, that are away from home, 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:51.700
You get this sense of... You just want to help.

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:54.172
[Bell ringing]

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.460
We have an announcement.
