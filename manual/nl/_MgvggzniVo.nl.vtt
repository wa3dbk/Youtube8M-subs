00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.000
A car that is unique in design

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
A car that feels great on track and on the open road

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
It used to be a dream for Alfa Romeo

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Now they have the Alfa Romeo 4C!

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.000
The 4C is very important for Alfa Romeo

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
This car is the begin of a new serie Alfa Romeos

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Its total weight is just 895 kilogram

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000
It's shorter than 4 meters long...

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Less than 2 meters wide and and just 118cm tall

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
That's promising!

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Here we are, in the Alfa Romeo 4C

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:10.000
This car is built with an eye on weight savings

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000
As a car manufacturer you can choose to build a car with many hp

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:22.000
But you can also decide, like Alfa Romeo, to build a light weight sportscar

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Like I said; this 4C only weights 895 kilogram

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.000
The power output is 240hp

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000
Coming from the 1750 TBi engine

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000
Which is a four-cilinder turbo engine

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000
Producing 240hp and 350Nm torque

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Thanks to its low weight it goes from 0 to 100 km/h in 4.5 seconds

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000
And its top speed is 258km/h!

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.000
How did they manage to get that low weight?

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:04.000
They started with a carbon fiber monocoque, which is the base of the car

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000
Attached to an aluminum subframe

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:16.000
Almost everything is made from carbon fiber or aluminum

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:24.000
Starting with the monocoque and subframe and built the whole body from aluminum

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:30.000
895kg, to give you an idea ??how light it is:

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.000
A Fiat Panda weights more!

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:44.000
In combination with 240hp you get a HP/weight ratio of less than 4kg per hp!

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000
Alfa Romeo calls it the ''War of weights''

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:57.000
You don't just see feel this car is light, but you also see it

00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:06.000
Everything is done to get this car as light as possible

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:13.000
No big spoilers or other parts that aren't functional

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000
The interior is pretty clean

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000
Just a steering-wheel, flappy paddles

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:25.000
We have AC and a simple radio system and that's it

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.000
This car is made for driving, not more, nothing less

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.000
And after you have driven this car, you are tired!

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000
But that's not that strange..

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:43.000
This car doesn't have power steering and is very pure

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.000
Actually, this car is going back in the past

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:54.000
Nowadays we do have power steering and other features that makes driving easier

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000
But Alfa Romeo doesn't want that

00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:05.000
Their customers want a car that needs your attention, and that's this 4C

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000
So much fun and the specs are great

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000
A light weight car with a good engine...

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:29.000
Should give just as much performance and experience as a car with much hp and a bit more weight

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:34.000
Well, that's the statement

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:40.000
Is it just as sportive as a, for example, Porsche 911?

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.000
Yes it is! This is a spartan and sportive car

00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:52.000
It drives like a rigid sportscar

00:04:52.000 --> 00:05:00.000
And that's what Alfa Romeo wanted; a pure car which is hard to drive

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.000
It is a mid-engined car with rear-wheel drive 

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:10.000
A little heavy on the back and a bit too light on the front

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:20.000
The car is very sensitive for tracks and is searching all the time

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.000
And the engine: it is really alive right behind me

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:30.000
That's just great, 10 points for driving experience!

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000
How is going to buy an Alfa Romeo 4C?

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:53.000
This is a gadget, for clients who already own an Alfa Romeo 8C perhaps

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.000
Very much fun to drive and actually pretty exclusive as well

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:04.000
They are going to build no more than 3500 4C's each year

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:10.000
And that's not because they can't sell more...

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:17.000
But the build of the carbon monocoque is very labor-intensive and expensive

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:23.000
So, only 3500 4C's each year!

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:39.000
Alfa Romeo puts a price tag on this car of �60.000,- and I like that positioning

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:46.000
This car is very sportive, exclusive, sounds great...

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:54.000
A great experience to drive this car... and that for �60.000,-

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:07.000
A really like it so I am going to drive a bit more with a car that is very exciting!

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.000
What a great handling... paddle to to metal!
