00:00:15.357 --> 00:00:18.217
When we drove the new
Peugeot 208 last year, ...

00:00:18.217 --> 00:00:23.339
... I dreamed of a new 208 GTi 
at the end of the video.

00:00:24.033 --> 00:00:30.100
The reason was easy: there was a 205
and its GTi variety. A wonderful car.

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:32.179
Then there was the 206,
which was less.

00:00:32.506 --> 00:00:37.171
I don't want to talk about the 207.
It was too large and heavy.

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:42.890
Suddenly there was the 208. Smaller,
more fun to drive, a sporty steering wheel.

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.131
It just lacks the power you'd want.

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:50.315
Suddenly the 208 GTi concept
was in Paris last year.

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.100
Geneva had the production model,
and now we're driving it.

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:59.223
Peugeot shouts it should
remind us of the 205 GTi.

00:00:59.223 --> 00:01:04.054
"This is the new 205 GTi, with
the same driving experience."

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:09.120
The 205 GTi is known as
the best hot hatch ever.

00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:10.782
Maybe together with the Clio RS.

00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:15.329
So yea, let's try it.

00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:32.148
Peugeot changed a few
things for the GTi.

00:01:32.148 --> 00:01:40.420
The chassis has a 20 mm wider track
at the rear, 10 mm wider at the front, ...

00:01:40.420 --> 00:01:45.403
... which gives it a better handling.
The damper setup has been changed.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:53.005
There's been some design changes: a
spoiler and some kind of diffuser.

00:01:53.005 --> 00:01:56.722
I don't know what else, but the
interior is most striking.

00:01:56.722 --> 00:02:01.500
Sports steering wheel is smaller
compared to the normal 208's.

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.000
That steering wheel
is smaller as well.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.593
Red accents everywhere, with a
transition to the black, ...

00:02:07.593 --> 00:02:12.565
... glossy dashboard, make you feel
like you're driving something special.

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.850
The question remains if it lives up
to the driving characteristics.

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.727
Peugeot shouldn't say
this is the new 205 GTi.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.338
That is impossible. Nowadays, cars
have very different requirements.

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:32.460
The 205 GTi was 1,764 lbs
with 138hp for the 1.9 version.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.210
The weight ratio is different and
it has so much less weight.

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.263
You can't do this anymore in a modern
car because of soundproofing, ...

00:02:42.263 --> 00:02:46.642
... it's stuffed with safety measures
such as airbags and whatever.

00:02:46.642 --> 00:02:50.861
It's not realistic to say
you'll build a new 205 GTi.

00:02:59.517 --> 00:03:03.663
The numbers, which are
important in this type of cars.

00:03:04.088 --> 00:03:06.104
The 208 GTi has 197 hp.

00:03:07.101 --> 00:03:12.168
That's about as much as the
Clio RS and Fiesta ST.

00:03:12.168 --> 00:03:14.600
That story has been told
in last week's test.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:20.600
62 mph in 6.8 secs, which is right in
between the Clio RS and Fiesta ST.

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.390
The top speed is 143 mph,
which you won't drive anyway.

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:35.293
To be honest, tell me it has
158/168 hp and I believe you.

00:03:35.914 --> 00:03:38.558
It doesn't feel very feisty. 

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:45.000
You have to be realistic, and that
hurts as a Peugeot 206 GTi owner.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.011
It's not as good. It's fun to drive,
nothing wrong with that.

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:56.794
It's just not as sharp and
feisty as the Fiesta ST.

00:03:56.794 --> 00:03:59.924
That's a shame, because you
do hope for it in such a car.

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:10.200
What does it cost? 25,695 euros.

00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:13.281
Just as much as the competition.

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:18.370
That buys you a fast yet
comfortable hot hatch.

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:26.524
It's a nice car, but Peugeot shouldn't 
call it the new 205 GTi.

00:04:26.524 --> 00:04:32.702
It just isn't. Stop it. Say: "We've made
a nice, fast hot hatch. A cool car."

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.756
Then no lies have been told.

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:40.208
Don't bring up that old thing. The old
car is great, but it doesn't make it.

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:43.779
I have to admit you're on
the right track, Peugeot.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.766
On the right track. After the 206 GTi
and 207 GTi, this is better.

00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:51.425
But it's no 205 GTi.

00:04:51.928 --> 00:04:56.137
Did I say it's no 205 GTi, Peugeot?
It's no 205 GTi!

00:04:57.100 --> 00:04:59.300
Subs - Maru
It's a nice car, though.

00:04:59.962 --> 00:05:02.400
But no 205 GTi.
