00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Like we promised; we are at Top Marques Monaco 2014

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
A fair with the slogan: ''See it, drive it, buy it''

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.000
There are many manufacturers with extreme products

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000
Like a Veyron tuned by Mansory...

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.000
You don't get it more exreme than this; a Veyron Super Sport is completely custom made by Mansory

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.000
And as you can see, carbon fiber everywhere

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000
This Veyron Linea Vivere is made out of many carbon fiber parts

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:11.000
It is very extreme and risky, but it actually looks good

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.000
wrapping your car is totally hot at the moment

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000
Everyone likes to personlize his car

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000
Mansory does the same but on a different level

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000
This Aventador is totally made out of carbon fiber

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
You can also feel it; this is not a wrap

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:37.000
And that's why this car is so expensive, this Aventador costs +1.000.000,-- Euro

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:42.000
For that price you don't get just a carbon car...

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.000
This Aventador has 1250HP thanks to a V12 Twin Turbo

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.000
Normally, the stands at Top Marques are filled with stands from world wide brands

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
In 2014 we see more local dealerships 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000
Behind me is a McLaren 650S...

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000
I'm not going to tell you anything about it because next week we will drive it!

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:09.000
About a year okay the Arab company W Motors started developping a new hypercar

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:12.000
It has to compete with Koenigsegg and Bugatti

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000
This is the first productionmodel; the Lykan Hypersport

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.000
A car that has to compete with the Agera and the Veyron

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.000
Why? It has 770Hp, 0-100km/h takes 2,8 seconds...

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:30.000
And has a top speed of 390km/h!

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:37.000
The price tag? +- USD 3.4M

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:40.000
That pretty much, but why?

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:47.000
There are a few diamonds incorporated in the headlights...
Extreme? Yes! Ridiculous? Yes!

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:13.000
This is the 4th year that we are here at Top Marques Monaco and each year it is a bit less extreme

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:20.000
Maybe it is the financial crisis, the companies don't believe that this fair will bring them enough profit

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000
Many of these companies choose to take their cars outside

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:32.000
There is a lot of media on the streets of Monaco, it is the place to be to get attention

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:40.000
Top Marques Monaco; a bit less extreme but nevertheless enough nice toys!
