00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Driving the Nissan GT-R gets boring of course.
Especially when it concerns the Switzer P600!

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000
It is going to be fun today!

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Obviously we have a reason to drive this GT-R

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.000
This is the GT-R of www.gtrrijden.nl

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:37.000
So it is possible for you to experience this car by yourself,
you can experience the 618Hp and 750Nm!

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:46.000
I can hear you think; 'what is so special about driving a Nissan?'
Well, it is very special!

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.000
This is way more fun than driving a Ferrari, Porsche or Lamborghini

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Today it is my turn; on the road with the GT-R

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:06.000
And not a stock one... This one is tuned by Switzer

00:02:06.000 --> 00:06:12.000
That means: instead of 480Hp when stock, now 618Hp.
And especially the amount of torque is amazing 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:22.000
In combination with this dual clutch gearbox and the shifting paddles..
It is so easy but so fast!

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000
Back to second gear... I am driving 80km/h now...

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:46.000
This car isn't about emotion, but just technique in its perfection, everything is just right

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:58.000
The power is always there, the 3.8L V6 with two Turbos is always ready.
There is no turbo lag, the power is available from 1000rpm!

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:12.000
To get the most power out of your GT-R you have very much buttons to adjust everything

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:18.000
The most important buttons are the ''R'' buttons

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:26.000
Hold them and everything will bet set to the maximum; the gearbox, the power

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:36.000
The GT-R is a four-wheeldrive and in Race mode the power will be 50/50

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.000
I will show you what it can do!

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.000
Time for a history lesson!

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:07.000
The history goes back to 1969 when Nissan built a Skyline GT-R for the first time

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:14.000
The already had the Skyline, but for the Japanese Motorsport the needed something faster: the GT-R

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:20.000
Till 2002, when the R34 GT-R was still being built

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:28.000
And then Nissan was thinking of something faster and better; a Porsche and Ferrari ''killer''

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:40.000
Nissan designed the R35 GT-R and was a whole new car which wasn't based on the Skyline anymore

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:46.000
And that was a good decision, the R35 GT-R has beaten so much records

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.000
The Nurburgring, Nordschleife; he was faster then a 911 GT2

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:56.000
The called it the ''Porsche-Killer'' but with this Switzer Package it is almost a ''Veyron-Killer''!

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000
They call him Godzilla!

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:16.000
Most of the time the GT-R gets in the news for its speed and other specs

00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:22.000
But almost never it is about the driving, it is so thight to the road.
The steering is a bit heavy but also very accurate.

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:28.000
The handling, it bounces a bit because its stiffness but that's perfect for the track!

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:33.000
The car feels very good, no strange feelings in the corners etc

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:43.000
The four-wheeldrive is good but I would like some more power to the rear wheels for a nice drift once in a while

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:51.000
But in total; I am very satisfied with the GT-R.
It is a very nice experience, especially with this Switzer Package

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:07.000
I am going to have some more fun with the P600 from Switzer!

00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:21.000
Has this video you interested in this GT-R?

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.000
You can experience it yourself, you can drive this GT-R!

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:32.000
Looking for a nice birthday present? Or does your husband deserves a nice experience?

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:45.000
Go to the website www.gtrrijden.nl and I can tell you that this is way more fun than driving a Ferrari or Lamborghini

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:50.000
The Nissan GT-R Switzer P600!
