00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.836
So, McLaren...

00:00:23.906 --> 00:00:29.643
Since the launch of this car I've had
trouble remembering its name.

00:00:31.089 --> 00:00:35.061
It gets more confusing. Officially
it's called the MP4-12C, ...

00:00:35.061 --> 00:00:37.780
but the documents say it's 12C.

00:00:38.110 --> 00:00:43.158
Somehow I thought this car
wouldn't be exciting.

00:00:43.158 --> 00:00:50.065
Nonetheless, this is the latest
version. From 2013, not 2012.

00:00:50.065 --> 00:00:55.332
It has a power upgrade
to make it sharper.

00:00:55.332 --> 00:01:00.270
We get 616 hp, and that engine...

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:08.406
A lot of things make this car, but the
engine makes it a fantastic device.

00:01:09.142 --> 00:01:13.000
3.8-liter V8 and 2 turbos, of course.

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:17.928
616 hp, but the best thing is: ...

00:01:17.928 --> 00:01:24.157
when driving at 2,000 rpm
it's rather docile.

00:01:24.157 --> 00:01:28.627
Not extremely fast, but faster
than anything you've driven before.

00:01:28.627 --> 00:01:34.947
Just not as fast as we,
the cameraman and I, are used to.

00:01:35.445 --> 00:01:38.805
You'll think it's fun,
but not amazing.

00:01:38.805 --> 00:01:47.836
At 3,500 rpm you hear the turbo
spooling and the acceleration begins.

00:01:48.956 --> 00:01:56.456
Where it ends for a turbo diesel,
and for turbo gas engines as well, ...

00:01:57.191 --> 00:01:59.957
the McLaren continues accelerating.

00:01:59.957 --> 00:02:06.351
It does 8,500 rpm max, and within the
last 1,000 it's as if hell breaks lose.

00:02:06.634 --> 00:02:12.135
So extremely powerful.
It's a great build-up of power. 

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.620
If you match the rpm with the
required power, i.e. in a corner, ...

00:02:18.526 --> 00:02:21.161
you'll be able to drive on the limit.

00:02:31.075 --> 00:02:34.650
If I break hard I'll see something fun
in the rearview mirror.

00:02:34.650 --> 00:02:40.463
The Airbrake, a spoiler which goes up
and helps decelerate the car.

00:02:40.706 --> 00:02:45.020
If you go into ABS you won't notice
a difference in the car's handling.

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:49.500
When braking medium hard,
something strange happens. 

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:53.970
As if the wheels block.
It feels like the rear lifts.

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:57.196
I thought it's strange,
but you'll get used to it. 

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.235
This is a car stuffed
with electronics.

00:03:04.235 --> 00:03:10.667
You can be a critic,
but McLaren does it very well.

00:03:10.667 --> 00:03:15.640
Stabilizers, for example. The metal
bars which prevent the car ...

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:19.076
doing this in a corner;
I'm showing it with my head.

00:03:19.076 --> 00:03:23.351
You know, the leaning in corners. You
want it to be as level as possible.

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:33.125
When using rigid bars, the car will
be stiffer, which is sporty. "Sporty."

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:35.140
McLaren, on the other hand, ...

00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:40.788
uses electronically adjusted suspension
to keep it stable.

00:03:41.476 --> 00:03:46.602
You'll see it has a soft suspension
when driving over bumps.

00:03:47.361 --> 00:03:51.700
Until you attack a corner, then
everything will be rigid again.

00:03:51.912 --> 00:03:55.500
Then it's stiff again.
It works brilliantly.

00:03:56.082 --> 00:04:01.059
The performance: unearthly fast. 
It's amazing.

00:04:01.059 --> 00:04:07.843
0-62 mph in 3.1 secs. Within 8.8 secs
you'll reach 124 mph.

00:04:07.843 --> 00:04:14.492
You'll feel like everything goes
too fast when hitting the gas.

00:04:14.492 --> 00:04:19.302
Really too fast.
For the passenger, ...

00:04:19.302 --> 00:04:25.268
but also the driver will think it's
too fast for these conditions.

00:04:30.708 --> 00:04:37.327
Top speed is 207 mph, which is
fast enough for normal use.

00:04:38.257 --> 00:04:45.322
Amazing performance. The power
build-up of the engine is so nice.

00:04:45.322 --> 00:04:53.446
Combined with the rise in rpm and
the turbo, blast it 'til the rev limiter.

00:04:53.735 --> 00:04:57.221
Afterwards, the party
starts all over again.

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:02.426
It just sounds great.
I have to brake, but ...

00:05:02.426 --> 00:05:05.500
there's blipping when downshifting.

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:10.700
A great double clutch gear box
which got faster in the new model.

00:05:11.619 --> 00:05:14.002
From outside it's very loud.

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.008
It's the only thing of which I can
imagine customers to think "well..."

00:05:32.867 --> 00:05:37.800
There's a kind of sports button,
which might make it a bit more docile.

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:40.580
There's a lot of active things,
so this can be added as well.

00:05:42.131 --> 00:05:46.859
This type of car always comes with
a cold shower: the price.

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:56.035
To be exact:
the coupe is 267,764.28 euros.

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:58.332
We'll start saving up.

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:08.100
