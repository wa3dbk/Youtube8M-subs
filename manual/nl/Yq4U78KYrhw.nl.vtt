00:00:12.216 --> 00:00:16.292
Tina Turner and Saddam Hussein have one thing in common..

00:00:16.292 --> 00:00:23.904
They both owned a massive SUV. Not this Range Rover Sport S/C..

00:00:23.904 --> 00:00:33.017
No. This Lamborghini LM002. Believe it or not. This is a Lambo.

00:00:33.999 --> 00:00:36.507
Wow, what machine this is!

00:00:46.194 --> 00:00:52.744
The last picture you'd get in your head hearing the name Lamborghini is this. 

00:00:52.744 --> 00:00:54.944
Compared to this, a truck is a toy. 

00:00:54.944 --> 00:00:59.567
These powerdomes alone look like containers. 

00:01:03.216 --> 00:01:10.839
They say this is the heaviest clutch ever, and I believe that. 

00:01:10.839 --> 00:01:16.079
You must hate traffic jams in this car. 

00:01:20.368 --> 00:01:24.723
But you run straight over everything, so who cares?

00:01:39.217 --> 00:01:44.368
This car weights over 3 tons, but yet it goes from 0 to 100 km/h in less than 8 seconds..

00:01:44.368 --> 00:01:50.137
And over 200 km/h. Killing!

00:01:59.475 --> 00:02:04.238
Aboard the new Range Rover Sport it is clear that things evolved. 

00:02:09.597 --> 00:02:14.530
Of course, the Lambo is from the eighties, this is brand new. 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:18.851
But also compared to the former RaRo Sport, this is a lot better. 

00:02:18.851 --> 00:02:24.114
It is hundreds of kilograms lighter, thanks to aluminium. 

00:02:24.114 --> 00:02:33.565
The suspension improved a lot. It is very sporty for such a big vehicle. 

00:02:51.109 --> 00:02:57.353
All plastic that meets the eye. But it covers a massive V8, supercharged, 510 HP. 

00:02:57.353 --> 00:03:00.357
But look at this. This is an engine!

00:03:00.357 --> 00:03:05.122
The powerdomes aren't just show. The engine wouldn't fit. 

00:03:05.122 --> 00:03:09.136
This atmospheric V12 comes from the Countach.

00:03:09.136 --> 00:03:15.271
Look at this distributor cap with 12 outputs.

00:03:15.951 --> 00:03:19.107
Try to clean these contacts...

00:03:22.617 --> 00:03:28.060
The wheels alone! This car was built for oil sheiks. 

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:30.215
Hey, a David star in the wheel!

00:03:30.215 --> 00:03:33.867
Drum brakes rear. Why use decent brakes on a car this size?

00:03:33.867 --> 00:03:37.624
The tires are huge. But not original. 

00:03:37.624 --> 00:03:42.500
The spare tire is. Pirelli developed it, dedicated to this car. 

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:48.625
Without air, you can do 180 km/h in the sand, on the sides of the tire. 

00:03:48.625 --> 00:03:53.000
Not for sale at you local garage. Every now and then, Pirelli runs a production. 

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.334
If you need a set, you can sign up for 4, paying 10,000 dollars. 

00:04:07.152 --> 00:04:18.778
You get a 5 speed manual transmission, and it takes enormous force to shift gear. 

00:04:21.055 --> 00:04:26.094
Look at my biceps. And my left leg.

00:04:31.086 --> 00:04:39.214
It is very exclusive. Only 300 were ever built. 3 of them are in the Netherlands today. 

00:04:45.704 --> 00:04:52.575
Of course, the LaRo doesn't sound as brute as the Lambo. But this V8 is great as well. 

00:04:52.575 --> 00:05:03.979
What power! 510 HP and 625 Nm. It makes this high rise building fast as a racer. 

00:05:11.188 --> 00:05:13.162
Still, I finish the day in the Lamborghini. 

00:05:13.162 --> 00:05:19.239
The Range is far better, in any perspective. 

00:05:19.239 --> 00:05:26.801
But this Lambo is far more fun, in any perspective.
