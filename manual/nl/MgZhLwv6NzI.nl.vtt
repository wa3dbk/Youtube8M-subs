00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Previously you could order a BMW 3-Series Coupé,
But that is no longer possible

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:57.000
That car is replaced for the BMW 4-Series!

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.000
The first thing you notice are the great lines

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:08.000
The sloping roofline, with this colour, these wheels and the M-Package...

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.000
Today I'll take you with me and the BMW 335i Coupé!

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000
Like I just said; there is no longer a Coupé version of the 3-Series

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:41.000
Nowadays, every Coupé version has an even nember.
Just like all convertibles

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.000
The 1-Series Coupé and Cabriolet will be named the 2-Series

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.000
The 3-Series Coupé and Cabriolet is now named the 4-Series

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:59.000
The 5-Series already had the 6-Series and the 7-Series will never be a Coupé or Cabriolet

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000
You can order a 4-Series from €40.000,-

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:19.000
The 435i with X-Drive and automatic gearbox is available from 64.000,-

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.000
But BMW Nederland took some options for this 435i

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:29.000
This BMW 435i costs €89.000,-

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.000
But it fulfills all your desires

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000
Like I just said is this BMW almost full with options

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:49.000
It has a head-up display, a sliding sunroof, sport seats, a surround-camera system, you name it

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:55.000
One of the first things I noticed was the 'belt-system'

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000
Very useful and you would expect it in a Bentley

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:04.000
The next thing is noticd was the beautiful interiour

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:12.000
Many journalist say that the interiour of the 4-Series is a bit disappointing

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000
Because it looks too much like the interiour of a 3-Series

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:21.000
But I think, why are we complaining about this?

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:30.000
It is very ergonomic, great use of materials and it is focused on the driver..
I don't see the problem!

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000
For example: the M-steeringwheel which feels great

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000
You take place in this car and you don't act like a lazy driver

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.000
You grab the weel and you set your seat in the right position

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.000
You can adjust everything and you are ready for some cornering

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:58.000
The 435i is not the big news; the 4-Series is the news but we already know the 35i engine
0:03:58.000,0:04.02.000
The 3.0 liter inline six-cylinder engine has an output of 306 hp

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.000
In combination with the 8-speed ZF gearbox, which does a great job
0:04:06,000,0:04:12.000
And again: why change it when it is good?

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.000
The only think that slightly disappoints me is the sound...

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.000
I could be a bit louder

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:44.000
The steering is pretty light but not senseless.
It is communicating with the driver

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:50.000
Every day I step in my BMW 1-Series, with rear-wheel drive

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:56.000
And today the 435i with X-Drive, four-wheel drive
0:04:56.000,0:05:02.000,
First I wasn't comfortable with that; a car like this needs rear-wheel drive

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:09.000
The X-Drive system sends 60% to the rear wheels and 40% to the front wheels

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:15.000
When it needs more traction on the front wheels, it will be given

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:21.000
I have to say that the 435i doesn't drive like a car with four-wheel drive

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:26.000
I mean, it drives like a real BMW...

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:33.000
The sporty character with the power on the rear wheels, it still has that feeling and that excites me

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.000
For who is the 4-Series?

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:42.000
I can compare it with the Audi A5 Coupé, but I think that the BMW is more like a drivers-car

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:48.000
Everything is focused on the driver and it is more ergonomic, dynamic and sportier

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000
He also has plenty of room in the rear

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:56.000
The sloping roofline doesn't make you sit unfomfortable in the rear

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000
It also has plenty of room in the trunk

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000
The Audi A5 is a good looking car with a nice interiour...

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:11.000
But I would go for the 4-Series; it is sportier and doesn't like too much like a lease car

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:17.000
Again a succesfull new BMW-Series; the 4-Series!

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.000
It feels premium, drives good and looks very sexy

00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.000
This was a nice pre-dinner but I am waiting for the main course...

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.000
The BMW M4 is coming!
