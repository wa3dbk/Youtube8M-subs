00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.560
I remember that we was just two kids when we meet each other

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:16.220
It was a evening like this, and the time was short

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:18.820
Flat, I remember was raining, nothing going around

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:21.320
We was so close, but ALTHOUGH FAR AWAY

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:24.160
You was thinking that our love is on scale

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:27.040
I was thinking that for me IT ISN'T ANY HOPE

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.560
Everything for us was so strange

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:32.240
You was laughing, and I was writhing lyrics on a bench from park

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:34.820
Even that we was just at begining

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:36.040
I felt that for us

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:37.640
IS NOTHING TO DO

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:40.000
And so easy, the dream was crumbling every day

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:41.660
Remembering how happy I was

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:43.060
DREAMING TO HAVE KIDS

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.420
I was in the 9-th sky then, you remember

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:48.220
When we was spending entire days same like two kids

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:50.800
And like this time pass,  like pass one year

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.120
And when we saw each other

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:53.780
LIKE WE NEVER MEET BEFORE

00:00:53.920 --> 00:00:56.040
A few years pass, you never show up

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:57.100
We did our life

00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:58.971
I WENT WHERE I COULD

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.420
You didn't wanted anymore, you found someone else

00:01:01.540 --> 00:01:04.060
That you was loving him, just playing all the time in his bed

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:06.460
And life for you was so good

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:09.340
Everything was good for you, I wasn't having money even for a chewing gum

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:11.900
But I was watching you all the time from distance with tears in my eyes

00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:13.200
Thinking what to say

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.900
IF YOU APPEAR IN MY FACE

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.680
I remember how I was smiling when I was watching you how beautiful you was

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.100
But I was loosing myself when you was going in his luxury car

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:22.440
I remember how naughty you was

00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:25.200
Even you loved me, quaintly, you wanted to be harpy

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.080
So many tears was falling from my empty eyes

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.860
That you was loving so munch, and us

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.200
We was hiding our love, for no one to know

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:35.860
I wait you home, is my only philosophy

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:38.600
Now, so long time pass, I start to grow

00:01:38.740 --> 00:01:41.100
I start to have some fun, and to forget everything

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.900
I met a girl, we meet and liked each other

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:45.440
We loved, and we did

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:47.034
EVERYTHING WE WANTED

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.520
Now my life is good, I see that she really love me

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:52.080
And I love her, she is making my sunny days

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:54.540
And you, how are you, I heard that he left you

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:57.240
HE LEFT YOU HOME ALONE, HE GOT DRUNK AND LEFT

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.660
And now you regret what you did, but is to late

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.440
What you had, is gone

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:03.000
I WON'T BE THERE

00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:05.620
And I know how you feel, even if I loved you

00:02:05.620 --> 00:02:08.140
I FEEL GREAT WITH MINE,  I DON'T WANT YOU ANYMORE

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:09.500
I was lost, you

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:10.800
YOU CHASED ME

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:13.440
You didn't care then about anything that I wanted to say

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.820
I was you're but you let me go

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:17.180
Nice meeting you

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:19.280
