00:00:21.619 --> 00:00:28.619
in the deep ocean
There are several species of fish

00:00:28.999 --> 00:00:30.279
that man has not yet discovered

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:34.629
of fact to understand the ignorance
depths more pleasantly

00:00:34.629 --> 00:00:41.629
suffice it to say that you have more knowledge
about the moon

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:49.890
that on our own seabed

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:08.019
species that inhabit this mysterious habitat
for the lack of light as a means of survival

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:15.159
and lack of pigmentation
which generated that are transparent

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:27.270
thus no predators detect their prey

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:55.000
ostracods are tiny crustaceans found in the
sea floor

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:16.500
This is a cardinal fish as a defense mechanism
has become transparent and almost impossible

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:23.819
to see in the dark sea

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:31.769
Cardinal to meet with a small ostracod occur
as natural

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:38.769
the bigger eats the smaller
but that's when the ostracod active defense

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:42.280
mechanism, quickly getting rid of the danger

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:46.700
meet again happened

00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:58.700
to be eaten, the ostracod exudes a luminous
substance that reveals the exact location

00:02:59.469 --> 00:03:04.739
of the Cardinal
noticing this, Cardinal quickly spits his

00:03:04.739 --> 00:03:07.430
prey and away before being attacked by some
predator

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.599
certainly a worthy spectacle marine appreciated

00:03:28.599 --> 00:03:35.049
and you if you were a sea creature from the
depths which method you would like to have

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:41.419
defense
