00:00:28.319 --> 00:00:30.259
They call it The Devil's Train

00:00:30.259 --> 00:00:31.349
...Is The Beast...

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:35.100
Freight train migrants now addressed and that runs..

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.280
On the Pacific coast to northern Mexico

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.690
To Pascualito station in Mexicali..

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:41.570
From Chiapas is ...

00:00:41.570 --> 00:00:45.280
The train stops...

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:47.460
up to two or three days ...

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.690
up to two or three days ...

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:52.730
To address the same train or take another

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:54.060
The same driver says...

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:59.200
"Let's wait three days here .." And you expected

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:02.140
Takes a month to get

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:05.340
to Mexicali from Chiapas

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:11.570
Many trains must approach to reach here?
- Fourteen trains

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:15.250
Is the new route that migrants use to violence in Mexico

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:16.700
In the Gulf of Mexico

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:21.550
And in St. Louis, Tamaulipas, Coahuila, Nuevo León ...

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:26.090
That drug traffickers kill, kidnap and force

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:27.210
To be his slaves

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.360
But this new route has a problem ...

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:32.340
Get to hell ...

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:37.480
Cross the Sonoran desert, with temperatures of 160o F

00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:40.140
That's why they call it The Devil's Train ...

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:47.100
How to travel in the desert?

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:54.030
One should take three or four gallons of water ... In order to survive ...  You wet your clothes

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:59.500
- Why wet clothes?

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:00.800
To stand the heat ...

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:02.450
- What about those that do not have water?

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:05.770
- The pass my bad ...
- If can be supported

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:08.899
They must survive ... We helped each

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:15.109
- You die from the heat?
- Some are dehydrated

00:02:15.109 --> 00:02:20.899
You go crazy?

00:02:20.899 --> 00:02:25.219
Many people go crazy ...

00:02:25.219 --> 00:02:26.769
by hunger ...

00:02:26.769 --> 00:02:28.439
for lack of water ...

00:02:28.439 --> 00:02:30.209
And that makes us

00:02:30.209 --> 00:02:31.569
commit crimes

00:02:31.569 --> 00:02:37.299
Matar. You get caught asleep and goes crazy

00:02:37.299 --> 00:02:41.859
Throws you a stone and kills you...

00:02:41.859 --> 00:02:44.539
It is more serious if they are drugged

00:02:44.539 --> 00:02:46.020
Through this route ...

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:49.500
Hundreds of migrants arriving in northern Mexico hoping to cross the border

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:52.139
And coming to the United States

00:02:52.139 --> 00:02:56.099
A border which is now sealed

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:58.309
And crossed by the most dangerous places

00:02:58.309 --> 00:03:05.309
Halfway through the desert,

00:03:05.439 --> 00:03:08.949
Expect an opportunity to cross?

00:03:08.949 --> 00:03:10.599
Yes, but I have to go with someone ...

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:17.599
But nobody wants to try to cross ... by heat

00:03:17.689 --> 00:03:22.159
You feel die here, now in the desert

00:03:22.159 --> 00:03:25.409
I'll be back for November

00:03:25.409 --> 00:03:31.189
Now I will try by Coahuila

00:03:31.189 --> 00:03:32.529
Migrants who can not cross

00:03:32.529 --> 00:03:37.519
who are deported or who are afraid to die

00:03:37.519 --> 00:03:40.879
are doomed to wander the streets of Mexicali

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:44.549
It should take care of cholos and police

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:48.589
The migrants find that cross is suicide ...

00:03:48.589 --> 00:03:49.509
is suicide ...

00:03:49.509 --> 00:03:50.909
And to return back ...

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:52.619
They have another problem ...

00:03:52.619 --> 00:03:57.269
Escape from the city ...
- Here we have a big problem migrants ...

00:03:57.269 --> 00:03:58.909
A homeless will not let us out of here

00:03:58.909 --> 00:03:59.969
the migrants...

00:03:59.969 --> 00:04:02.970
not let us out of here

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:05.169
We board the train back from smuggling

00:04:05.169 --> 00:04:10.479
And Mexico's federal police stopped us. They torture us ...

00:04:10.479 --> 00:04:13.980
"La Policía Federal nos pega una guajolotera"

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:17.419
- And do not let us out of Mexicali ...
- Look, look ...

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:19.689
I broke my hand

00:04:19.689 --> 00:04:24.650
- Record that .. It is very important ...

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:29.349
On board the train. But I want to get out of this place ...

00:04:29.349 --> 00:04:36.349
"Se calientan. Se calientan gacho".

00:04:37.669 --> 00:04:39.190
Every afternoon ...

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:42.699
Migrants try to take the Devil's Train ... Now to return ...

00:04:42.699 --> 00:04:49.699
To the south of Mexico ...

00:05:00.689 --> 00:05:04.559
But the federal police and private guards will not let

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:10.530
And they out of work, unable to afford other transportation

00:05:18.620 --> 00:05:20.809
From Mexicali, Alberto Torres
