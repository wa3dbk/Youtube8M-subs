Recipe - "Bolillo"

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:15.469
Bolillo in Mexico is a popular bread made
out of wheat flour. It is believed that this

00:00:15.469 --> 00:00:18.991
bread was brought by the French during the
eighteenth century. 

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:26.340
This French bread has a crispy crust and a soft crumb and people like it since it was discovered. 

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:32.740
Nowadays mexican bakers name french bread to salty bread like bolillos, teleras and baguettes.

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:39.920
Until 1922 the bakery in Mexico was characterized
by a preponderance of white bread on the shelves of the stores

00:00:40.740 --> 00:00:47.120
From 1923 to 1950, approximately,
began offering confectionery.  

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:55.180
The bakeries were restless. Not liking the bread that was not warm and out of the oven, especially bolillo and telera.

00:00:56.240 --> 00:01:01.570
To face the competition, bakers
began offering warm bolillos , so that people

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:08.560
preferred buying in that bakery than others
and from this time began the custom of remove

00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:13.780
