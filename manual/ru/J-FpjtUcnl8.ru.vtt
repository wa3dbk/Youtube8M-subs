00:00:04.456 --> 00:00:06.226
Pistol round on de_inferno map.

00:00:06.924 --> 00:00:10.446
Let's discuss the attacking - or terrorists' - side.

00:00:11.765 --> 00:00:21.318
I haven't played professionally for over a year, but I've watched a lot of games and came to the following conclusions.

00:00:22.064 --> 00:00:25.470
The effective scheme at match-makings for me is as follows: I send my teammates...

00:00:26.743 --> 00:00:29.788
Wow, he scared me!

00:00:34.032 --> 00:00:36.171
OK, let's continue.

00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:50.251
So I would run along Banana, take the Pillars, shoot at the defence player trying to fire back at me.

00:00:51.114 --> 00:01:02.702
I wasn't able to succed at this at all times, however, if you expect your opponent to show and you sway to the sides, you may be able to do this.

00:01:04.187 --> 00:01:11.880
That's because you have a Glock, so you can practically shoot on the go.

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.110
If there is no one around, you may proceed further.

00:01:16.501 --> 00:01:18.265
The defence player often stays here, in a not quite typical position.

00:01:18.893 --> 00:01:21.049
Not behind the car...

00:01:21.805 --> 00:01:22.946
... or at the gap...

00:01:23.688 --> 00:01:25.426
... but at the window.

00:01:25.924 --> 00:01:28.322
Accordingly, you should expect him to be here, otherwise you risk getting a headshot right away.

00:01:28.889 --> 00:01:35.501
If there is nobody here, you can fire a few bullets at the standard position (the so-called pre-fire).

00:01:36.968 --> 00:01:45.484
So when you chased the defence players away, this means that at least two players are at Plant B.

00:01:46.328 --> 00:01:49.987
You can pull out your knife and run to your teammates.

00:01:50.565 --> 00:01:58.017
And they should do they following: two players rush through Apartments, and another two stay near the House.

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.422
What would I do next?

00:02:03.038 --> 00:02:07.535
I would say, "Let's go!", then I'd jump immediately to take the left corner, while my teammates are taking the right corner.

00:02:08.111 --> 00:02:18.265
This part is really important on de_inferno map, without regard to your weapons (whether it's pistols or Kalashnikovs).

00:02:18.889 --> 00:02:23.704
The exit strategy, when one player takes the left corner, and others take the right one, is very effective.

00:02:24.477 --> 00:02:32.177
The thing is, two or three defence players often wait in ambush here, and it's very successful as well.

00:02:32.877 --> 00:02:39.098
However, it might fail due to the terrorists' well-targeted exit, whether or not under the cover of flashbang.

00:02:40.142 --> 00:02:46.894
The flashbang can help blind your opponents. However, if they are not blinded, they get the info and focus on Center.

00:02:47.405 --> 00:02:54.364
So the exit with shooting can be as effective, because the defence players don't know the exact moment of your appearance.

00:02:55.271 --> 00:02:57.783
So you may come out, take the left corner righ away...

00:02:58.313 --> 00:02:59.765
... and one of your teammates takes the right corner.

00:03:00.218 --> 00:03:03.489
You exchange fire, thus killing two or three defence players at Center.

00:03:03.928 --> 00:03:09.377
If you'd killed two of them, then another one is staying at Pit, and the two or three of you can kill him there.

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:12.315
Then you plant a bomb and play the "2x2" or "3x3" round.

00:03:12.939 --> 00:03:19.905
And this exchange play is the most important thing in Counter Strike.

00:03:21.967 --> 00:03:25.654
Well, that's all concerning pistols here.

00:03:26.031 --> 00:03:27.534
You could just as effectively rush through Apartments.

00:03:29.217 --> 00:03:30.827
It all depends on the level of your shooting.

00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:36.503
Although, I guess my main audience consists of Gold Novas or Silvers.

00:03:37.783 --> 00:03:44.467
However, if you have The Global Elite rank, then rushing through Apartment is not the best idea for you, as your opponents are most likely just as strong.

00:03:45.208 --> 00:03:47.567
They would be prepared to take out rushes and shoot accurately from USPs.

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:49.747
From here...

00:03:50.313 --> 00:03:50.889
...from here...

00:03:51.553 --> 00:03:54.689
Well, I've already made a guide on CT pistol round on de_inferno map.

00:03:55.270 --> 00:04:07.189
However, if you haven't got the highest rank, you can push through any spot with your numbers, as these positions are often guarded by a small number of defence players - one or two.

00:04:08.966 --> 00:04:11.844
These two players are unlikely to shoot you in the head right away.

00:04:12.398 --> 00:04:18.092
So you just come out, make your kills, exchange fire, take the Pit at Plant A, and win the round.

00:04:18.906 --> 00:04:29.373
As for another pistol option: you can go to Plant B together, take Banana just as I've shown you before.

00:04:30.186 --> 00:04:36.875
Before that your teammates should have bought a few smokes to throw them at Help and at Spools.

00:04:38.457 --> 00:04:39.875
And then you can come out and take the round.

00:04:40.718 --> 00:04:42.063
This smoke wouldn't be too bad.

00:04:43.029 --> 00:04:46.029
Well, it's not the best because the defence player can stay here...

00:04:48.678 --> 00:04:50.092
... and kill you from the side.

00:04:50.675 --> 00:04:52.689
So you should always try to aim your smokes accurately.

00:04:54.281 --> 00:04:59.405
Nevertheless, I've shown you how to throw them before, although de_inferno map has changed since then.

00:04:59.802 --> 00:05:04.239
I probably should update the guide.

00:05:05.483 --> 00:05:09.999
I'm throwing the smoke to Spools.

00:05:11.048 --> 00:05:13.078
Well, that wasn't really good, although not the worst.

00:05:13.517 --> 00:05:17.015
It cuts off the Church while enabling the players at Spools to make their kills.

00:05:17.966 --> 00:05:20.940
On the other hand, this smoke will be helpful when you're entering the Plant...

00:05:21.628 --> 00:05:24.374
... and have already killed your opponents here.

00:05:25.498 --> 00:05:28.171
So the helping person would be neutralized.

00:05:29.575 --> 00:05:32.545
So this is all about pistol round on de_inferno map.

00:05:33.271 --> 00:05:43.687
You might also make serious efforts and throw smokes to the Car, under the Smoking Area, and so on.

00:05:44.876 --> 00:05:51.903
However, the main rule of the pistol round on de_inferno is pushing through one of the spots with prevailing numbers.

00:05:53.278 --> 00:05:59.032
The defence players often play out default, so the five of you might encounter only two or three of them.

00:05:59.928 --> 00:06:03.675
Accordingly, your chances for success grow.

00:06:04.342 --> 00:06:09.467
Thus, you can win the round.

00:06:10.202 --> 00:06:13.496
That's it. It was Arseniy "CEH9". Thumbs up.

00:06:14.312 --> 00:06:15.653
Thank you for watching.
