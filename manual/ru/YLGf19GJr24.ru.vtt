00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:13.410
Came into my life,
Shining so bright and

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:14.410
Now, all is right.

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:15.410
My dreams will be heard,
My voice and my words and

00:00:15.410 --> 00:00:16.410
I will rise.

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:17.410
[Припев:]
Cause I have this voice inside

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:18.410
That I don't want to hide
But people told me I can't do it

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:19.410
I know that I'l get through it
I know that I can make it

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:20.410
I'll reach for the stars

00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:21.410
Right from the start,
I felt it in my heart

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:22.410
I knew that deep inside
We'll never be torn apart

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:23.410
And if I dream it
If I believe it

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:24.410
I'll achieve it
I can make it far

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:25.410
Today will be the day,
I am here to stay and

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:26.410
I won't be afraid.

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:27.410
Keep my feet right on the ground, and
I won't lose my sound

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:28.410
No I won't look down.

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:29.410
[Припев:]
Cause I have this voice inside

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:30.410
That I don't want to hide
But people told me I can't do it

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:31.410
I know that I'l get through it
I know that Ii can make it

00:00:31.410 --> 00:01:11.110
I'll reach for the stars

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:12.570
Right from the start,
I felt it in my heart

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:13.740
I knew that deep inside
We'll never be torn apart

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:14.800
And if I dream it
If I believe it

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:15.800
I'll achieve it
I can make it far

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:16.800
Right from the start
Deep in my heart

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:21.560
I knew that i'll go far
Cause music is my love

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:24.247
If I believe it,
I will achieve it

00:01:24.247 --> 00:01:51.530
I can reach the stars.
