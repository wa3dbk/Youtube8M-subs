00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.659
I wrote that

00:00:02.659 --> 00:00:04.210
I liked one tweet from

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:07.779
from Xeo: "This is agony"

00:00:07.779 --> 00:00:09.339
and

00:00:09.339 --> 00:00:11.709
that is agony

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:14.680
that the decisions made so fast

00:00:14.689 --> 00:00:15.500
obviously

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:18.960
hoping for luck

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.829
 so no preparation

00:00:21.829 --> 00:00:24.369
no testing, no thinking

00:00:24.369 --> 00:00:26.380
just like lets take guys

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:28.570
mb it will work, mb not

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:30.779
100% gamble

00:00:30.779 --> 00:00:32.190
so will it work 

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:33.740
or not

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:35.810
as I told I think

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:36.679
that

00:00:36.679 --> 00:00:38.239
will not work

00:00:38.239 --> 00:00:39.260
and thats it

00:00:39.260 --> 00:00:42.720
but what about Slardar Venge?

00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:44.360
wait

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:47.020
you are talking to man who tried

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:49.300
such strategies lots of times

00:00:49.300 --> 00:00:50.950
reminding in M5

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:53.090
we took PGG and Vigoss

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:55.470
simultaneously in team with 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:58.200
same logic

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.270
now like Vova PGG will be cpt

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:04.070
Vigoss will carry with Potm ez

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.980
didnt work

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:08.010
then we collected

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.500
old darer with Artstyle

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:11.720
same, not worked

00:01:11.720 --> 00:01:14.520
Then we tried unstable mix with

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.490
during ti quals, 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:18.420
not worked again

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:20.820
then again

00:01:20.820 --> 00:01:22.950
every time when you want

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.060
to take old famous pplz

00:01:25.060 --> 00:01:25.700
who played long ago

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.650
and like that your team will win immediately

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:29.509
chances

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:30.210
are

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.300
just low

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:34.360
Artem fng what you think

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:39.520
yes 

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:42.290
Overall I think

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:43.900
the same

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:46.160
but i believe

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:48.330
they will play

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:50.490
and try to win and practice

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.810
and make all they could

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:54.369
then will show something

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:56.200
ok, enough this politcoreect answer

00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:57.960
what you personally thinking

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.330
can they?

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:03.590
start will be rough and bad

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:05.640
tbh, hard to take

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.050
man who, I am about Artstyle

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:10.759
I am about Artstyle

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:12.970
from the rumors I heard

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:18.919
man who shined not in best colors

00:02:18.919 --> 00:02:24.169
in the past and smth like that

00:02:24.169 --> 00:02:25.979
start will be not the best

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:28.469
btw meanwhile secret pwned Goomba

00:02:28.469 --> 00:02:30.279
nothing to 

00:02:30.279 --> 00:02:31.139
comment

00:02:31.139 --> 00:02:32.839
just total pwnage

00:02:32.839 --> 00:02:35.529
overall I think

00:02:35.529 --> 00:02:38.059
we all have to go in studanal 

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:41.789
and discuss

00:02:41.789 --> 00:02:42.519
who

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:46.249
where and how yes

00:02:46.249 --> 00:02:48.909
do we have hope for Na`Vi?

00:02:48.909 --> 00:02:49.679
Na`Vi ti5?

00:02:49.679 --> 00:02:52.269
but my tweet that 

00:02:52.269 --> 00:02:54.319
Na`Vi is top1 ti5 

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:56.959
is still legit

00:02:56.959 --> 00:02:58.700
but the problem that

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:00.620
from that roster i was tweeting about

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:03.759
three are already reshuffled (phobos etc)

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:07.659
also wanted to ask

00:03:07.659 --> 00:03:09.799
while are you here

00:03:09.799 --> 00:03:11.229
what about Vanskor, 

00:03:11.229 --> 00:03:14.759
worth to keep him as coach?

00:03:14.759 --> 00:03:17.179
I don't know, if He wants 

00:03:17.179 --> 00:03:19.269
or team wants so coach

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:20.989
will help a bit

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:23.219
this is about how is atmosphere inside team

00:03:23.219 --> 00:03:25.559
inside team

00:03:25.559 --> 00:03:27.509
again, coach is 

00:03:27.509 --> 00:03:30.529
man with beard who seen life

00:03:30.529 --> 00:03:33.959
who will teach young 

00:03:33.959 --> 00:03:37.189
Imagine:Vanskor teaching Artstyle to draft

00:03:37.189 --> 00:03:39.809
and ta ke

00:03:39.809 --> 00:03:42.209
I don't think that young Ivan can teach old Ivan

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:43.400
take Lighofheaven, so 

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:45.359
they  will be 7 in team

00:03:45.359 --> 00:03:46.989
so they will push with quantiti

00:03:46.989 --> 00:03:50.089
manager 8th

00:03:50.089 --> 00:03:54.119
And bring back Axypa

00:03:54.119 --> 00:03:56.969
so, overall when you go full YOLO

00:03:56.969 --> 00:04:00.289
then you can also take Dubas

00:04:00.289 --> 00:04:03.249
at this moment i'm out

00:04:03.249 --> 00:04:05.509
btw, who was at TI 1 

00:04:05.509 --> 00:04:07.619
navi manager? mcdeath

00:04:07.619 --> 00:04:09.269
y McDee

00:04:09.269 --> 00:04:10.330
y

00:04:10.330 --> 00:04:11.520
so

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:13.650
lets bring back McDee too

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:15.800
to work as statist

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:18.640
to make stats etc

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:21.650
yes, you are right thx

00:04:21.650 --> 00:04:23.500
thx for joining giving ur opinion

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:25.410
secret vs goomba finish

00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:29.880
here we have just ownage

00:04:29.889 --> 00:04:31.629
OWNAGE
