00:00:05.741 --> 00:00:07.871
We arrived at the venue, my dear friends.

00:00:10.096 --> 00:00:13.061
Basically it's a rather small venue.

00:00:13.061 --> 00:00:15.137
Well it depends on how you look at it.

00:00:15.137 --> 00:00:21.726
It could be big or it could be small but it should be interesting.

00:00:22.842 --> 00:00:24.590
Flamie and Seized already arrived.

00:00:25.032 --> 00:00:26.578
The guys are ready of course.

00:00:27.692 --> 00:00:31.633
We even have Russian-speaking supporters here.

00:00:34.939 --> 00:00:36.264
It's rather dark here.

00:00:37.051 --> 00:00:40.002
That's why my camera may not be able to handle this darkness.

00:00:40.797 --> 00:00:43.143
But I will try to shoot the best scenes for you...

00:00:43.143 --> 00:00:44.509
Like this one. Oops!

00:00:46.473 --> 00:00:47.324
What's there, Vanya?

00:00:47.324 --> 00:00:48.610
Flipsid3 lost 16-10.

00:00:49.416 --> 00:00:49.837
To Cloud9?

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:50.320
Yes.

00:00:51.222 --> 00:00:53.447
Well, Cloud9 is a rather strong team.

00:00:53.447 --> 00:00:56.838
The American champions, they placed 2nd in ESL ESEA, so everything's fine.

00:00:58.763 --> 00:01:04.012
By the way here comes the Russian-speaking community.

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.678
This is team captain Andrey Blad3, team Flipsid3 captain.

00:01:07.678 --> 00:01:08.390
And this is S1mple.

00:01:09.111 --> 00:01:09.526
Hello.

00:01:09.526 --> 00:01:10.008
Hi.

00:01:12.808 --> 00:01:14.900
They are upset of course, because they just lost.

00:01:16.108 --> 00:01:17.330
It's just natural.

00:01:23.097 --> 00:01:23.831
It's rather noisy here.

00:01:24.337 --> 00:01:32.730
There is reason to use in-ear headphones, the headphones that are put inside ear.

00:01:34.977 --> 00:01:41.177
You can see the light dimming away, but I hope you will be able to see something.

00:01:42.262 --> 00:01:43.691
I think this is one of the organizers,

00:01:43.691 --> 00:01:46.707
guys are talking about which playing venue should they take.

00:01:46.878 --> 00:01:50.870
I think it's the Flipsid3's one. They'll go there.

00:01:50.870 --> 00:01:52.308
This is all falsehood.

00:01:53.317 --> 00:01:55.215
Everything here is a lie, a fake.

00:02:11.664 --> 00:02:13.731
Where would the guys sit? Oh, here it is.

00:02:14.605 --> 00:02:18.559
Here is a small so called scene, the venue of the event,

00:02:21.906 --> 00:02:23.135
where the guys would play.

00:02:23.542 --> 00:02:30.258
In fact the monitors here are ASUS, but they are 120 Hz.

00:02:31.037 --> 00:02:36.482
Yes, they are 120 Hz, because yesterday in gaming zone monitors were 75 or even 60 Hz.

00:02:37.761 --> 00:02:39.250
In this regard the monitors are good.

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:44.557
It's Devilwalk, Luminosity team player.

00:02:48.047 --> 00:02:54.068
In general the venue is good, the tables are good, they are about 1m, maybe more.

00:02:54.792 --> 00:02:55.868
The guys are greeting each other.

00:02:56.927 --> 00:02:57.278
Here they are.

00:03:03.112 --> 00:03:08.855
Here is kind of friendly atmosphere, but inside they are very serious.

00:03:09.221 --> 00:03:13.805
They are thinking only about bad things, how they would put in, put out.

00:03:15.445 --> 00:03:21.521
Just as usual, but on camera, on public they all talk to each other and are happy.

00:03:24.474 --> 00:03:28.970
In fact for the World Championship the scale isn't that great to be honest.

00:03:29.981 --> 00:03:34.181
Their emphasis is probably more on stream picture, on...

00:03:37.595 --> 00:03:39.111
Opps, look who's there.

00:03:39.569 --> 00:03:45.731
Yegor Markelov, Hiko, Hiko... S1mple again and by the way it's Johnta, the coach of the team.

00:03:45.755 --> 00:03:45.989
Hello.

00:03:48.151 --> 00:03:48.379
Hello.

00:03:49.712 --> 00:03:50.145
It's Bondik.

00:03:51.725 --> 00:03:56.056
The emphasis is on picture, on streams, so you should see some quality there.

00:03:56.529 --> 00:03:57.193
Yegor, hello.

00:03:58.193 --> 00:03:58.793
Hi, ceh9.

00:04:04.113 --> 00:04:05.525
We will be live again soon.
