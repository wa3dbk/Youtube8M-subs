ANTRECESSIONARY GRAFFITY

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:06.000
CHALK

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.980
We have used a new tool, new technologies

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:24.220
Street art artist Dscamoe Mr (DSC)

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:28.700
for street art, drawing your own name or name of your team.

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:30.960
Street art artist Tony Stork (Rayons)

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:38.380
We used chalk, forgotten by everybody and somehow not respected, 

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:43.480
but it's also an artistic tool to be used.

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:45.480
 Cool stuff!

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:46.740
Why not? 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:52.600
Cheap, people react absolutely positively.

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:56.060
You can draw almost everywhere.

00:00:56.060 --> 00:01:01.000
Today we were walking around the city - stopped, made some some drawings and nobody told us off. 

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:02.420
So it's cool! 

00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:05.600
People take it normally, nobody get's what's going on. 

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:10.780
So you can do without markers, go and tag...by chalk!

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:18.040
The only negative is limited
range of colors, 

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:22.620
but we have not yet tested the coal. 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:24.600
But we will! 

00:01:24.660 --> 00:01:31.180
Even if you have problems
with the police, the good thing is that you

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:39.240
can quickly wipe your art off and have no
penalty, no police. 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.080
That's all.

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:47.760
I think for summer it's gonna be the best.

00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:54.320
So here's the way in crisis- it's chalk. 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:55.980
Fine!
