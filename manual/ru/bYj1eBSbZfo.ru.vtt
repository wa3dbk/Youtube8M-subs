00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
He amazingly talented in all: armwrestling, bobsleigh, business, science, politics.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.000
This hero's name with a talking Voevoda. He always starts to win.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
In any sport you have to be unique. To 
 be unique you need to be smart. 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:22.000
I did not think that people in the nine 
 months be world champions in a heavyweight.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
The first steps in armwrestling he with coach Kote Razmadze recalls with smile.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000
Other people think of it without shuddeling hard. 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:38.000
I did frame.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Was the top board. 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Armrests was not.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
We fought on this board. Blood stains, leather stranger.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Today he has three world champion status.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Despite this, it is more known as a bobsleigh man.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:57.000
It  offend his.

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
My favorite sport it's arm wrestling.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Bobsleigh classification is the third.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
Judo second and third bobsled.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.000
About his main love he can talk for a long time and inspiration.

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Armwrestling captures (conquers). Here the struggle, but without a fight.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
You can go in a jacket and tie and fight.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Even for a champion in arm wrestling small rewards.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000
Lack of support from government and business.

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000
That's why successful armwrestler Alexey Voevoa once decided to try bobsleigh.

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:40.000
I felt sorry for all the not Olympians who won 
 the world championship and they are nobody needs.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:47.000
I asked what is the bobsledding. Tried, turned. In the end, I'm here.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Here he was the best pusher.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000
But own role in this sport is not very good.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000
Life of pusher in the bobsleigh like...

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.000
Jump into the abyss, to nowhere.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000
Accelerates, run, jump and do not know what's going on, you can not see.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000
The pilot sees through the eyes, but pusher should feel the track.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000
When light hovering or mistaken pilot.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000
Feeling like fall down.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.000
Unpleasant and painful fall.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.000
For inexperienced people arm wrestling and bobsled have nothing to do.

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:33.000
Strong hands, strong legs, strong ligaments, the man is very strong.

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000
power plays an important role 

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000
it has examples

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:46.000
fees were in town

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:53.000
fighting in the cafe showed that no boxers or wrestlers gave us no resistance

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000
guys are so strong that beat all

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000
it bobsledder

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000
Respect bobsleigh

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000
He says that without intelligence and tenacity force useless everywhere

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000
he has enough of this

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.000
so no wonder the fans are waiting for him, 
 not only in the bobsled, but in armwrestling

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.000
His fans remained, waiting for his return

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000
I'll be back. I'll be back someday

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000
I did not go out armwrestling

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000
I'm a fan of Armwrestling

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.000
it's like a cult. if hit, then forever

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.000
Perhaps because of such outstanding personalities arm wrestling rises to new heights

00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.000
and will become an Olympic sport
