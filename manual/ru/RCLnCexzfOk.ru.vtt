Hello, I want to show you Centrifuge.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Centrifuge is light and simple open-source platform for real-time message broadcasting in your web applications.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Here I'll just show it in action, please, read documentation for detail information.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Let's run Centrifuge.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.000
We should run database first. Here I am launching MongoDB, but you can use PostgreSQL too

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Then run Centrifuge instance and go to http://localhost:8000 (default)

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:55.000
This is an administrative web interface where you can create different projects, manage categories and watch events.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:05.000
Now let's send new event into Centrifuge using terminal client which is called Cent.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:15.000
After sending we can see that event in web interface.

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:20.000
Now let's test Centrifuge with external application.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:40.000
We run example app from Centrifuge repository - page with text input, displaying all messages coming.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:50.000
Type something...say "Hello". Press Enter and here we can see that our application received new event with data we just sent,

00:01:50.000 --> 00:02:20.000
Now open another tab to see broadcasting. Type something again. And look - both tabs received new message.

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:32.000
Try again - it works! 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:45.000
Go back to admin web interface. Here we see those three messages in "programming" project. 

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:50.000
Please, read documentation and try it yourself.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000
Feedback is very appreciated, just email me - frvzmb@gmail.com.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.000
Source code can be found on Github.

00:02:55.000 --> 00:03:00.000
Thanks for your time. Good luck!
