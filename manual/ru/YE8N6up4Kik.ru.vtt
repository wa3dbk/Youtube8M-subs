00:00:14.073 --> 00:00:19.998
Hello, dear viewers. This is Arsenuy ìceh9î Trynozhenko with a regular edition of Na`Vi tactics.

00:00:20.232 --> 00:00:23.622
This time I will tell you about the new map ñ de_train.

00:00:23.934 --> 00:00:28.760
Players began playing de_train in official matches recently. De_nuke was replaced with this map.

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.380
This is a great bonus for Na`Vi. Since the map they canít play was removed.

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.860
And the map, which theyíve always been good at since Counter-Strike 1.6, was added.

00:00:37.716 --> 00:00:42.306
Naturally, train was changed and improved balance here.

00:00:42.506 --> 00:00:45.221
In general attack can take here 5-6 rounds.

00:00:45.456 --> 00:00:49.394
The tactics is simple. Any team should be able to apply it.

00:00:49.612 --> 00:00:55.277
Its throwing nades to A plant. The smokes should be thrown directly across the lines.

00:00:55.655 --> 00:01:01.538
Smoke should cover the whole plant. Then you need to move out via the Middle + down ladder.

00:01:01.423 --> 00:01:07.263
I wouldnít suggest the four players moving out together from the Middle, since it seems to me useless.

00:01:07.498 --> 00:01:11.493
I think it is more reasonable to send one guy to assist Zeus, or to go via Alley, or to go to B.

00:01:11.695 --> 00:01:16.753
I think this option is better.

00:01:17.394 --> 00:01:20.609
WellÖ tactics is simple. Watch it yourself and pay attention to the nades.
