00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:16.204
Hello, dear friends. Hereís another edition of Na`Vi tactics. This time weíll speak about Overpass.

00:00:16.204 --> 00:00:24.830
Of all the new maps, i.e. Cache, Cobblestone, Na`Vi has the minimum problems at Overpass. And it is great.

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:33.785
Today weíll study rather simple, yet effective tactics of moving to B plant and pushing from all the sides without weapons.

00:00:33.785 --> 00:00:42.682
The players had only Tec-9 were applied, 1-2 armors, and minimal quantity of nades (only a couple of smokes and flashbangs + Molotov).

00:00:42.682 --> 00:00:48.029
It is rather simple. Smokes should be thrown at Walkway, one smoke must be thrown at the Sniper's Nest.

00:00:48.029 --> 00:00:51.267
It is recommended to throw Molotov cocktail behind the yellow barrels.

00:00:51.267 --> 00:00:56.733
Btw, this time Na`Vi missed as they threw cocktail. However, they showed great individual performance.

00:00:56.733 --> 00:01:00.186
Enjoy the video! Thumbs up!
