I've heard that jamaican black castor
oil<00:01:27.659> I<00:01:28.049> think<00:01:28.259> it<00:01:28.380> is<00:01:28.530> is<00:01:28.740> really<00:01:29.310> really<00:01:29.490> good

but I decided to go with this because it

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.710 
but I decided to go with this because it
was<00:01:31.740> cheaper<00:01:32.189> if<00:01:32.460> you<00:01:32.850> can't<00:01:33.060> find<00:01:33.270> it<00:01:33.390> at<00:01:33.509> your
