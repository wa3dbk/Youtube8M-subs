00:01:35.749 --> 00:01:35.759 
look at the eight inch plate it's 20

00:01:35.759 --> 00:01:39.200 
look at the eight inch plate it's 20
feet<00:01:36.000> high<00:01:37.130> now<00:01:38.130> the<00:01:38.610> pressure<00:01:38.909> per<00:01:39.180> square

feet high now the pressure per square

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:41.889 
feet high now the pressure per square
inch<00:01:39.509> would<00:01:39.780> be<00:01:39.900> the<00:01:40.079> same<00:01:40.380> as<00:01:41.070> the<00:01:41.579> four

00:01:41.889 --> 00:01:41.899 
inch would be the same as the four

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:44.690 
inch would be the same as the four
because<00:01:42.899> we're<00:01:43.110> only<00:01:43.320> measuring<00:01:43.860> a<00:01:44.220> column<00:01:44.640> of

water one square inch 20 feet high this
is<00:01:48.119> very<00:01:48.540> important<00:01:50.000> so<00:01:51.000> whenever<00:01:51.240> you<00:01:51.540> are

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
is very important so whenever you are

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.590 
is very important so whenever you are
doing<00:01:51.630> pressure<00:01:52.079> per<00:01:52.350> square<00:01:52.380> inch<00:01:53.329> the<00:01:54.329> big
