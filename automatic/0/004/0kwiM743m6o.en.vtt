00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:12.700
 hello now this can finally be done 

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:14.920
 leaf video for review for the 

00:00:12.700 --> 00:00:22.779
 foundations of the mecca haj bayrou due 

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:25.660
 soared to use them and above all the 

00:00:22.779 --> 00:00:30.930
 comparison of sardu and foundation of the mac 

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:36.660
 more checks would be the match but ste 

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:49.680
 and the study fax fluid and the collector 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:55.890
 matched this is the corrector this 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:01:02.790
 so then starting from the fact that 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:06.310
 This here it was big and the Irish 37 

00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:10.150
 in the pix fluid study then what do they have 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:15.070
 these two foundations have both 

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:18.070
 a petition with SPF 15 other studies 

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:20.229
 that you imagine what changes because it is 

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:24.210
 suitable for those who have not said it in all e 

00:01:20.229 --> 00:01:27.159
 two have a mat tenut finish 

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:30.340
 only the match master seems to me more 

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:34.290
 suitable for those with normal dry skin 

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:39.630
 maybe a mysterious one is perhaps better 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:43.750
 fluid because it does not contain oils and 

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:47.619
 that is, on the skin it results more 

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:53.530
 opaque in comparison to match the master and the 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:57.479
 fixed width and lunia in my opinion that sin 

00:01:53.530 --> 00:02:02.070
 it can have the fix fluid is the fact that 

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:05.799
 you do n't have a dispenser so a pro must 

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:10.290
 buy took him with the EUR 6 

00:02:05.799 --> 00:02:16.150
 differences would have been an idiot 

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:19.690
 and along with the trust also took the 

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:24.640
 corrector matching you would select 

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:27.250
 like the app this one on bettino that 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:31.110
 I paid 20 euros but it only lasted 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:37.630
 very little on the hand and little the brush 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:41.380
 this one here in 224 this one has spread out 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:44.350
 soft summaries and with this one here 

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:48.400
 behold , I offer them more under the eye and 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:53.010
 in the various points to correct uniform 

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:56.020
 I need marquez of the pimples of 

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:59.110
 anything to reform his 

00:02:56.020 --> 00:03:01.060
 brush is perfect and really enough for me 

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:05.410
 very little product put on the hand and 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:07.690
 then if it will sell as more correct it does 

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:11.110
 miracles even one morning 

00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:15.010
 I woke up closed with a done 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:18.730
 scratch call on the neck however I have to do a 

00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:19.710
 audition so I said no you can 

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:21.820
 to review 

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:23.980
 so nobody got the checker 

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:28.660
 helped himself and he never told me makelele 

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:29.980
 photoshop meaning is disappear and nothing 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:32.230
 so this is really valid 

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:41.460
 corrector one that I repeat is the select 

00:03:32.230 --> 00:03:43.990
 like the app and this fits me 25 instead 

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:45.730
 the collector would still be one too 

00:03:43.990 --> 00:03:49.680
 this week would be the nuance those 

00:03:45.730 --> 00:03:54.010
 eyes that would be luciani 17 you know rome 

00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:59.800
 instead lay the foundation use the 

00:03:54.010 --> 00:04:02.800
 mangoni center but this and I like it for 

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:04.900
 roll out everything but often enel for the 

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:06.310
 track had the sponge the sponge 

00:04:04.900 --> 00:04:09.070
 wet to make a natural effect 

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:11.440
 ascoli clamp when it needs to re 

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:14.319
 conference though all 21 

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:16.449
 mayors master friends that damage textures 

00:04:14.319 --> 00:04:21.220
 in reality however it depends on the 

00:04:16.449 --> 00:04:24.729
 drafting as it is spread and in addition I have seen 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:26.380
 that without putting the cpa translucent ones 

00:04:24.729 --> 00:04:29.139
 transparent to make the most effect 

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:32.139
 even more so you can use the 

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:34.449
 fix plus that I 'm bored 20 centimeters 

00:04:32.139 --> 00:04:37.300
 in short, tifi is fine 

00:04:34.449 --> 00:04:40.150
 and as they say it lasts for eight hours 

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:42.430
 with determination but with perhaps the one with 

00:04:40.150 --> 00:04:43.930
 a booklet a little and maybe fix 

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:47.470
 for a more important evening 

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:53.880
 I don't know if it was a birthday maybe even 

00:04:47.470 --> 00:04:57.370
 in summer even better is the must is 

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:58.300
 at least for me this one uses it together 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:01.030
 to another color 

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:03.389
 the new case we are this summer that 

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:07.990
 now it is still a little clearer 

00:05:03.389 --> 00:05:11.770
 because this is 5.0 here 

00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:15.400
 quite darken their site more 

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:16.690
 in winter maybe and in summer because to me 

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:19.210
 it polishes me a little more 

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:23.349
 here therefore perhaps in the summer the study 

00:05:19.210 --> 00:05:25.419
 pix fluid or better and nothing but well 

00:05:23.349 --> 00:05:29.080
 then I wanted to talk to you about coming there for me 

00:05:25.419 --> 00:05:32.440
 here that I don't have the blush wings of m ma 

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:35.710
 I use the usual one and I feel good about it 

00:05:32.440 --> 00:05:38.919
 so that is why change the signature of 

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:40.690
 car costs a lot of one to use 

00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:42.520
 the one for the brushes that brand 

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:45.990
 free here says I 'm alright even in that 

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:49.330
 of skate sector price quality is 

00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:51.400
 identical if one that then and nothing 

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:53.440
 I hope this very short review at 

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:55.990
 6 fashion sabel ore is coming back sowing 

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:58.960
 I sign very well so nothing next 

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:59.770
 Once let's do a trick maybe 

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:03.780
 an exercise 

00:05:59.770 --> 00:06:03.780
 hello a kiss hello hello
