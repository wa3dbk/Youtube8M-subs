00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
let me introduce the hydro landing net

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.509 
let me introduce the hydro landing net
the<00:00:10.290> latest<00:00:10.620> addition<00:00:11.070> to<00:00:11.099> the<00:00:11.219> track<00:00:11.490> a

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:11.519

okay<00:01:25.330> so<00:01:25.390> what<00:01:25.630> have<00:01:25.720> we<00:01:25.750> got<00:01:25.840> with<00:01:26.080> the<00:01:26.170> hydro

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:26.560 
okay so what have we got with the hydro

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:29.370 
okay so what have we got with the hydro
net<00:01:26.770> well<00:01:26.979> first<00:01:27.250> up<00:01:27.540> 42<00:01:28.540> inch<00:01:28.720> arms<00:01:29.049> now<00:01:29.229> these

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:29.380 
net well first up 42 inch arms now these

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:31.830 
net well first up 42 inch arms now these
are<00:01:29.530> made<00:01:29.650> out<00:01:29.830> of<00:01:29.860> carbon<00:01:30.130> fiber<00:01:30.720> lovely<00:01:31.720> and

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:31.840 
are made out of carbon fiber lovely and

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.930 
are made out of carbon fiber lovely and
thin<00:01:32.080> really<00:01:32.710> strong<00:01:33.010> now<00:01:33.550> down<00:01:33.760> at<00:01:33.850> the

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:33.940

00:01:35.999 --> 00:01:36.009 
spigot end these are actually reinforced

00:01:36.009 --> 00:01:37.859 
spigot end these are actually reinforced
so<00:01:36.670> for<00:01:36.850> extra<00:01:37.150> security

00:01:37.859 --> 00:01:37.869 
so for extra security

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
going to damage your landing that pole

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:52.289 
going to damage your landing that pole
if<00:02:50.769> you're<00:02:50.890> dragging<00:02:51.220> it<00:02:51.310> across<00:02:51.430> gravel<00:02:52.060> and

00:02:52.289 --> 00:02:52.299 
if you're dragging it across gravel and

00:02:52.299 --> 00:02:54.960 
if you're dragging it across gravel and
it<00:02:52.870> also<00:02:53.019> means<00:02:53.410> that<00:02:53.590> the<00:02:54.130> pole<00:02:54.370> when<00:02:54.670> it's<00:02:54.820> in

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970 
it also means that the pole when it's in

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:57.210 
it also means that the pole when it's in
water<00:02:55.150> with<00:02:55.750> a<00:02:55.780> net<00:02:56.019> flow<00:02:56.260> this<00:02:56.769> will<00:02:56.980> float

00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:57.220 
water with a net flow this will float

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:58.620 
water with a net flow this will float
completely<00:02:57.820> so<00:02:57.940> it's<00:02:58.090> great<00:02:58.360> if<00:02:58.390> you're
