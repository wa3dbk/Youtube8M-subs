pin on either side to secure it and it
gets<00:01:58.049> a<00:01:58.140> little<00:01:58.259> peccary<00:01:58.710> right<00:01:58.950> here<00:01:59.189> so<00:01:59.430> I

00:01:59.450 --> 00:01:59.460 
gets a little peccary right here so I

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.580 
gets a little peccary right here so I
just<00:01:59.790> kind<00:02:00.000> of<00:02:00.090> push<00:02:00.299> it<00:02:00.479> under<00:02:00.780> make<00:02:01.380> sure

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590 
just kind of push it under make sure

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.660 
just kind of push it under make sure
it's<00:02:01.740> but<00:02:01.979> it<00:02:02.100> up<00:02:02.250> and<00:02:02.520> then<00:02:02.700> lay<00:02:02.850> it<00:02:02.880> back<00:02:03.119> down

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 
it's but it up and then lay it back down

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:09.380 
it's but it up and then lay it back down
and<00:02:06.290> secure<00:02:07.290> that<00:02:07.439> side<00:02:07.710> also<00:02:08.069> so<00:02:08.819> we<00:02:09.030> have<00:02:09.179> one

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:09.390 
and secure that side also so we have one

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.949 
and secure that side also so we have one
side<00:02:10.220> now<00:02:11.220> we<00:02:11.280> need<00:02:11.580> to<00:02:11.760> do<00:02:11.879> the<00:02:12.030> other<00:02:12.060> side<00:02:12.450> so

00:02:12.949 --> 00:02:12.959 
side now we need to do the other side so

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:13.880 
side now we need to do the other side so
what<00:02:13.170> I<00:02:13.200> do<00:02:13.319> is

00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:29.470 
just like that and again I'm going to

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:33.420 
just like that and again I'm going to
start<00:04:29.710> on<00:04:29.920> the<00:04:30.280> fabric<00:04:31.770> and<00:04:32.770> I'm<00:04:33.130> going<00:04:33.280> to<00:04:33.310> go

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:33.430 
start on the fabric and I'm going to go

00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:49.280 
start on the fabric and I'm going to go
ahead<00:04:33.550> and<00:04:33.790> sew<00:04:33.970> right<00:04:34.180> over<00:04:34.240> that<00:04:45.720> alright

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:49.290 

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:53.520 

so<00:04:50.290> now<00:04:50.440> if<00:04:50.650> we<00:04:50.680> turn<00:04:51.010> this<00:04:51.190> over<00:04:51.930> you<00:04:52.930> can<00:04:53.170> see

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:53.530 
so now if we turn this over you can see

00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:55.830 
so now if we turn this over you can see
how<00:04:54.070> much<00:04:54.220> the<00:04:54.400> zipper<00:04:54.670> is<00:04:54.820> left<00:04:55.090> over<00:04:55.360> here<00:04:55.660> in

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:55.840 
how much the zipper is left over here in

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:58.980 
how much the zipper is left over here in
here<00:04:56.440> if<00:04:56.650> you're<00:04:57.400> sewing<00:04:57.940> super<00:04:58.480> close

00:04:58.980 --> 00:04:58.990 
here if you're sewing super close

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:00.750 
here if you're sewing super close
I<00:04:59.020> would<00:04:59.290> suggest<00:04:59.500> flipping<00:05:00.130> it<00:05:00.250> over<00:05:00.400> and

00:05:00.750 --> 00:05:00.760 
I would suggest flipping it over and

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:02.610 
I would suggest flipping it over and
sewing<00:05:01.120> on<00:05:01.240> this<00:05:01.450> side<00:05:01.720> and<00:05:02.020> then<00:05:02.260> walk<00:05:02.590> your

00:05:02.610 --> 00:05:02.620 
sewing on this side and then walk your

00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:05.010 
sewing on this side and then walk your
needle<00:05:03.310> over<00:05:03.490> these<00:05:03.760> little<00:05:04.090> metal<00:05:04.360> pieces<00:05:04.600> if

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:05.020 
needle over these little metal pieces if

00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:07.830 
needle over these little metal pieces if
you<00:05:05.080> um<00:05:06.040> if<00:05:06.370> your<00:05:06.910> zipper<00:05:06.940> isn't<00:05:07.540> quite<00:05:07.690> as
