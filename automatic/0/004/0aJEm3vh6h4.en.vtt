 shuffled i mean you bet if u 

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:16.310
 you 64-bit system make approximately 

00:03:13.040 --> 00:03:19.670
 2 gigabyte was not fuck 48 megabytes 

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:21.880
 as well as many could not run 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:27.590

00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:09.820
 husky sola 

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:12.250
 that's all the opportunity to run the assembly 

00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:13.060
 on for this I will now launch it 

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:15.340
 show you 

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:19.120
 assembly run quite a long time 

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:22.600
 because the entire 500 megabytes as you 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:27.760
 you know that's pretty but sborochka 

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:30.150

 brief of which forge itself is also one of who 

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:04.530
 understands the assembly can 

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:07.070
 experiment put new 

00:05:04.530 --> 00:05:09.540
 ford is worth something with the last ford 

00:05:07.070 --> 00:05:13.650
 can put a new ford pour all 

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:16.950

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:20.280
 You can of course go to those who 

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:22.200
 a professional then I understand it 

00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:24.720
 I will not give you the finished assembly 

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:27.600
 use fuck mor this type is a pilot 

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:30.960

 I advise you to stand assembly 

00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:43.410
 exactly our dozen 4 bit system 

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:46.409
 since on a 32-bit system stands 

00:05:43.410 --> 00:05:49.139
 java and 32 bit 

00:05:46.409 --> 00:05:52.309
 and you can not more than one gigabyte 

00:05:49.139 --> 00:05:55.720

 Egret either something else 

00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:21.350
 provide a link to the assembly please 

00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:22.610
 my build 

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:26.419
 either us she 

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:28.870

 registers micro materials here itself 

00:06:42.380 --> 00:06:52.390
 client ship errors are not any here 

00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:55.990
 everything will boot up slowly there too 

00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:55.990
 so to speak 

00:06:56.840 --> 00:07:03.729
