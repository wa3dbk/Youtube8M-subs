00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.419
 hello how about ladies and ladies 

00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:05.250
 Welcome to Chris Mania as you can 

00:00:03.419 --> 00:00:06.899
 notice today I bring a new 

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:20.939
 hairstyle but how do I know that does not 

00:00:06.899 --> 00:00:22.500
 it interests you we go to the video hello 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:24.269
 friends it is a pleasure to be greeted and the day 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:25.980
 today pray for a social problem something 

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.090
 that has impacted us since time 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:29.400
 past 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:31.349
 I want to talk about a word cortita 

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.380
 a word only of six letters 

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:36.840
 seven that is the lie according to 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.879
 research I did I found that 

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.320
 the lie is when a person affirms 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:42.180
 something that is not true and obviously 

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:44.040
 being a lie, others do not know that 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:45.840
 is lying and for that reason the 

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:47.280
 people who received the lie were 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.440
 it was as if that lie had been 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.210
 truth I know I am very bad explaining 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.010
 things for that reason I want to talk 

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:54.809
 on some basic points of the 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:58.200
 lie I want to leave something saved in 

00:00:54.809 --> 00:01:00.960
 their hearts the lie affected us 

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:02.970
 enter to enough of the lie dotcom and 

00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:04.050
 they sign I do not know why but I think that 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:05.850
 I had listened to his side 

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:07.530
 ok there are several reasons why 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.900
 people while there are bad lies 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.730
 some that are worse and others that also 

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:13.830
 are worse by the way there are no 

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:16.229
 good lies or the pious ones if 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.270
 there are lies that would save us 

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:20.040
 many problems but still they do not leave 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.780
 of being bad because with time they fall 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.520
 strange consequences for us 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:25.170
 same for that reason today I am going to 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.060
 talk about why humans 

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.740
 we lie number 1 one of the causes 

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.450
 main so beings 

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:32.430
 humans we lie many times is because 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.750
 shame that others realize 

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:36.210
 what do we have that is what 

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.220
 we feel or think that saying the 

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:40.080
 truth the others would laugh at us 

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.479
 and humiliate us and have in a way 

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:44.460
 many times not to say those truths 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.229
 uncomfortable that obviously does not open with 

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:47.640
 they knew however it is necessary to be 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:49.560
 Sincere and request our 

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:51.149
 feelings another reason why the 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.520
 human beings we lie many times is 

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:55.410
 to avoid responsibilities we could 

00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:57.810
 to say that someone tells you Christ you did 

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:59.310
 this and you say the other of the reasons 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:01.710
 for which but as we lie 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.840
 many times it is to impress more 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.590
 when we are boys and girls come 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:06.509
 beautiful 

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:08.099
 to approach us many times 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:09.750
 We are with a group of friends and they 

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:11.280
 they talk about the amazing things that 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:12.629
 they have good cell phones and you 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:14.430
 you say I also have a good cell phone 

00:02:12.629 --> 00:02:16.379
 but I did not wear it, you obviously lied to me 

00:02:14.430 --> 00:02:18.269
 You felt shame, however, I wanted to 

00:02:16.379 --> 00:02:19.920
 to amaze about lying in 

00:02:18.269 --> 00:02:21.720
 our work many times we lie 

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.160
 so that we do not get fired, let's say you 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:25.500
 have left the task of making a 

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.970
 I work for such date or said hour you 

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:29.069
 you do not have the work ready however 

00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:31.170
 when your boss asks you if you have it 

00:02:29.069 --> 00:02:33.840
 ready you say if you 're ready 

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.610
 Completely ready however to the last 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:37.890
 you just finished it and delivered it 

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:39.810
 at the last moment maybe with some 

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:41.430
 errors that you do not notice another reason 

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.709
 for which we lie many times that 

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:45.239
 to avoid problems in relationships 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:49.049
 for example he instructs them some day 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:51.390
 It says where we are, it's not Alberto, it's not 

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:54.390
 are you making the investment and tell me where 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:57.180
 were you this is in the church love 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:58.680
 when in the fight fight you understand me 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:01.049
 you lied and what if you really 

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.700
 you spent all your time with your friends 

00:03:01.049 --> 00:03:04.349
 because women actually men 

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:06.900
 when we are not at home we do not walk with 

00:03:04.349 --> 00:03:08.850
 another actually we occupied that time very 

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:11.160
 apart to use it in very things 

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:13.170
 personal like being with friends 

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:15.120
 football they understood women so no 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:17.640
 believe that when we are late 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:21.440
 we went to visit them is because 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:25.690
 We were with another woman for nothing 

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:25.690
 and they believed it 

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:33.720
 and there are many more reasons why 

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:36.120
 which we lie among them 

00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:38.190
 to lift our ego many times 

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:39.810
 so as not to hurt feelings like 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:41.640
 example many times you are with a 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:43.320
 person unintentionally has it not 

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:45.420
 would you like to estimate your feelings 

00:03:43.320 --> 00:03:47.430
 and you keep saying what you want 

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:48.630
 and nothing else is there to be no feeling 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:50.130
 is one of the reasons why 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:52.890
 we lie is another reason 

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:55.170
 stand out among your group among others 

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:57.090
 things that lie and how 

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:58.920
 end point to finish this video 

00:03:57.090 --> 00:04:00.840
 I want to talk about the main lie 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:03.240
 it is that lie that deceives us 

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:06.610
 ourselves crisis you have no talent 

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:08.959
 and will never achieve anything 

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:11.000
 it's self willy ok 

00:04:08.959 --> 00:04:12.860
 a lie that many do not understand not 

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:14.540
 capture is that when we lie in 

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:16.639
 We are not really lying to 

00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:18.320
 we lie to ourselves 

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:20.269
 same when we exaggerate with the 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:22.430
 lies we are so used to the 

00:04:20.269 --> 00:04:24.440
 lies many times that in the future 

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:26.000
 we stick to those lies and the 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:28.370
 we make it so real that it is very natural 

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.470
 lie however we know that the 

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:32.300
 consequences are going to be strong and it gives us 

00:04:30.470 --> 00:04:35.000
 like that means to lie to us 

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:37.100
 lying not to ourselves does not 

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.050
 directly reflects if they are not those 

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:40.850
 consequences that the mind and the 

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:42.620
 loss of the people we want the 

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:44.570
 loss of our dreams among others 

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:46.430
 things in short friends I want to say is 

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:48.020
 that the lie is horrible and you have to be 

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:49.760
 sincere all the time in that way 

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:51.560
 being sincere we will achieve 

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:53.030
 that more people stay to our 

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:55.070
 side that we can find friends 

00:04:53.030 --> 00:04:56.960
 great and of course get a 

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:58.850
 relationship with a person in the agreement 

00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:00.800
 in love in what I personally attract as 

00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:02.930
 someone who detests the lie and always 

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:04.850
 I try to be honest all the time and 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:06.710
 when I can not be honest I prefer not 

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:08.389
 say nothing I prefer not to answer anything and 

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:10.220
 tell them that I do not want to answer that 

00:05:08.389 --> 00:05:11.540
 question but that's my way of thinking 

00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:15.580
 you who are in 

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:15.580
 in your work in a cyber
