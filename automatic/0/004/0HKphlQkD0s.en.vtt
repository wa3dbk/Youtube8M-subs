from<00:00:32.070> time<00:00:32.340> to<00:00:32.520> time<00:00:32.960> as<00:00:33.960> you<00:00:34.230> can<00:00:34.260> see<00:00:34.649> we<00:00:34.829> have

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
from time to time as you can see we have

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.580 
from time to time as you can see we have
an<00:00:35.130> anthill<00:00:35.520> as<00:00:35.850> well<00:00:36.090> which<00:00:36.840> is<00:00:36.870> always<00:00:37.380> there
