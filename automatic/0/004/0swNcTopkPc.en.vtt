it's<00:02:46.340> really<00:02:46.490> straightforward<00:02:46.880> you<00:02:47.300> don't

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:47.450 
it's really straightforward you don't

00:02:47.450 --> 00:02:49.030 
it's really straightforward you don't
even<00:02:47.570> have<00:02:47.720> to<00:02:47.900> read<00:02:48.080> the<00:02:48.230> manual<00:02:48.530> to<00:02:48.620> get<00:02:48.890> this
