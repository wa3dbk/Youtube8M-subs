in<00:00:03.060> this<00:00:03.480> video<00:00:03.720> I'm<00:00:03.990> just<00:00:04.049> going<00:00:04.230> to<00:00:04.350> show<00:00:04.620> you

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:04.680 
in this video I'm just going to show you

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:07.390 
in this video I'm just going to show you
a<00:00:04.799> cool<00:00:05.190> new<00:00:05.490> little<00:00:05.819> project<00:00:06.299> I'm<00:00:06.450> working<00:00:06.480> on

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:07.400 
a cool new little project I'm working on

00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:10.250 
a cool new little project I'm working on
over<00:00:08.400> here<00:00:08.550> I<00:00:08.610> have<00:00:08.849> the<00:00:08.880> robot<00:00:09.389> alarm<00:00:09.900> clock

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:10.260 
over here I have the robot alarm clock

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:12.200 
over here I have the robot alarm clock
and<00:00:10.590> this<00:00:10.860> looks<00:00:11.099> like<00:00:11.219> a<00:00:11.280> big<00:00:11.550> mess<00:00:11.790> but<00:00:12.059> it

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:12.210 
and this looks like a big mess but it

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.509 
and this looks like a big mess but it
really<00:00:12.389> isn't<00:00:12.599> I<00:00:13.019> have<00:00:13.769> the<00:00:13.889> robot<00:00:14.099> alarm

00:00:14.509 --> 00:00:14.519 
really isn't I have the robot alarm

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:17.870 
really isn't I have the robot alarm
clock<00:00:14.820> hooked<00:00:15.240> up<00:00:15.480> to<00:00:15.809> a<00:00:15.839> wave<00:00:16.650> shield<00:00:17.190> now

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880 
clock hooked up to a wave shield now

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.120 
clock hooked up to a wave shield now
this<00:00:18.060> doesn't<00:00:18.270> look<00:00:18.449> like<00:00:18.510> a<00:00:18.690> shield<00:00:19.170> for<00:00:20.070> the

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130 
this doesn't look like a shield for the

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.400 
this doesn't look like a shield for the
Arduino<00:00:20.699> because<00:00:21.060> usually<00:00:21.750> you<00:00:22.020> would<00:00:22.109> find

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:22.410 
Arduino because usually you would find

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.620 
Arduino because usually you would find
them<00:00:22.529> they<00:00:22.680> look<00:00:22.890> like<00:00:23.100> this<00:00:23.490> and<00:00:23.820> the<00:00:24.269> shield

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:24.630 
them they look like this and the shield

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:26.990 
them they look like this and the shield
just<00:00:24.960> you<00:00:25.590> know<00:00:25.710> that's<00:00:26.099> right<00:00:26.310> on<00:00:26.460> top<00:00:26.699> of<00:00:26.910> a

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:27.000 
just you know that's right on top of a

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:28.849 
just you know that's right on top of a
thing<00:00:27.210> but<00:00:27.390> I<00:00:27.449> hate<00:00:27.539> using<00:00:28.019> these<00:00:28.170> boards<00:00:28.680> for

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
thing but I hate using these boards for

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.790 
thing but I hate using these boards for
a<00:00:28.890> dedicated<00:00:29.189> project<00:00:30.029> like<00:00:30.210> this<00:00:30.410> so<00:00:31.410> what

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:31.800 
a dedicated project like this so what

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:35.150 
a dedicated project like this so what
I've<00:00:31.920> done<00:00:31.949> is<00:00:32.809> made<00:00:33.809> a<00:00:33.840> little<00:00:34.200> standalone

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
I've done is made a little standalone

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.520 
I've done is made a little standalone
Arduino<00:00:35.730> here<00:00:36.030> on<00:00:36.210> its<00:00:36.360> own<00:00:36.600> board<00:00:36.960> right<00:00:37.230> next

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:37.530 
Arduino here on its own board right next

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.350 
Arduino here on its own board right next
to<00:00:37.649> it<00:00:37.770> and<00:00:37.890> hardwired<00:00:38.579> it<00:00:38.820> right<00:00:39.120> to<00:00:39.300> the

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
to it and hardwired it right to the

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:41.810 
to it and hardwired it right to the
shield<00:00:39.780> and<00:00:40.050> what<00:00:40.649> this<00:00:40.800> Arduino<00:00:41.100> does<00:00:41.579> is

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:41.820 
shield and what this Arduino does is

00:00:41.820 --> 00:00:44.660 
shield and what this Arduino does is
just<00:00:42.239> interprets<00:00:43.050> the<00:00:43.290> incoming<00:00:43.800> serial<00:00:44.460> data

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
just interprets the incoming serial data

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:48.560 
just interprets the incoming serial data
to<00:00:45.390> it<00:00:45.600> and<00:00:45.780> then<00:00:46.620> works<00:00:46.950> with<00:00:47.219> that<00:00:47.460> to<00:00:48.390> work

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570 
to it and then works with that to work

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.840 
to it and then works with that to work
with<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:49.020> wave<00:00:49.350> shield<00:00:49.649> and<00:00:49.860> it's<00:00:50.610> pretty

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
with the wave shield and it's pretty

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.850 
with the wave shield and it's pretty
simple<00:00:51.120> you<00:00:51.449> know<00:00:51.629> it<00:00:51.840> just<00:00:51.870> sets<00:00:52.260> up<00:00:52.379> a<00:00:52.500> serial

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:52.860 
simple you know it just sets up a serial

00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:54.260 
simple you know it just sets up a serial
connection<00:00:53.280> it<00:00:53.370> just<00:00:53.579> sits<00:00:53.760> there<00:00:53.850> all<00:00:53.969> day

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
connection it just sits there all day

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:57.709 
connection it just sits there all day
and<00:00:54.420> waits<00:00:54.600> for<00:00:54.719> data<00:00:56.059> the<00:00:57.059> code<00:00:57.270> is<00:00:57.300> super

00:00:57.709 --> 00:00:57.719 
and waits for data the code is super

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:59.779 
and waits for data the code is super
simple<00:00:57.899> button<00:00:58.379> that's<00:00:58.680> the<00:00:58.829> idea<00:00:59.280> of<00:00:59.460> it<00:00:59.609> and

00:00:59.779 --> 00:00:59.789 
simple button that's the idea of it and

00:00:59.789 --> 00:01:02.299 
simple button that's the idea of it and
then<00:01:00.480> that's<00:01:00.690> hooked<00:01:00.960> up<00:01:01.170> to<00:01:01.350> a<00:01:01.379> little<00:01:01.649> op-amp

00:01:02.299 --> 00:01:02.309 
then that's hooked up to a little op-amp

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:05.719 
then that's hooked up to a little op-amp
circuit<00:01:02.460> here<00:01:03.180> with<00:01:03.449> a<00:01:03.719> let<00:01:04.680> me<00:01:04.799> rotate<00:01:05.280> here

00:01:05.719 --> 00:01:05.729 
circuit here with a let me rotate here

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:09.320 
circuit here with a let me rotate here
to<00:01:05.939> a<00:01:06.000> speaker<00:01:06.360> over<00:01:06.570> here<00:01:06.780> and<00:01:08.000> it'll<00:01:09.000> read

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:09.330 
to a speaker over here and it'll read

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:12.340 
to a speaker over here and it'll read
the<00:01:09.479> time<00:01:09.689> and<00:01:10.049> every<00:01:10.860> hour<00:01:10.890> it<00:01:11.369> reads<00:01:11.610> a<00:01:11.760> quote

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:12.350 
the time and every hour it reads a quote

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:15.469 
the time and every hour it reads a quote
I've<00:01:13.350> loaded<00:01:13.619> this<00:01:13.890> up<00:01:14.130> with<00:01:14.479> text-to-speech

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
I've loaded this up with text-to-speech

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:20.990 
I've loaded this up with text-to-speech
data<00:01:16.350> off<00:01:16.860> of<00:01:17.119> a<00:01:18.200> tts<00:01:19.200> lab<00:01:20.159> something<00:01:20.820> there's

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
data off of a tts lab something there's

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.530 
data off of a tts lab something there's
a<00:01:21.090> link<00:01:21.330> to<00:01:21.600> it<00:01:21.780> on<00:01:21.900> a<00:01:22.710> de<00:01:22.950> fruits<00:01:23.280> website<00:01:23.790> but

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
a link to it on a de fruits website but

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:34.219 
a link to it on a de fruits website but
let<00:01:24.720> me<00:01:24.750> show<00:01:25.200> you<00:01:25.229> a<00:01:25.350> demo<00:01:25.799> here<00:01:30.200> I<00:01:33.140> don't<00:01:34.140> know

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
let me show you a demo here I don't know

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:35.600 
let me show you a demo here I don't know
if<00:01:34.290> you<00:01:34.409> could<00:01:34.530> hear<00:01:34.770> that<00:01:34.950> she's<00:01:35.280> hard<00:01:35.549> to

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:35.610 
if you could hear that she's hard to

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:46.700 
if you could hear that she's hard to
understand<00:01:36.570> but<00:01:45.110> she<00:01:46.110> doesn't<00:01:46.380> make<00:01:46.470> much

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:46.710 
understand but she doesn't make much

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:49.429 
understand but she doesn't make much
sense<00:01:46.770> but<00:01:47.280> what's<00:01:47.520> really<00:01:47.729> cool<00:01:48.090> is<00:01:48.149> what<00:01:48.990> is

00:01:49.429 --> 00:01:49.439 
sense but what's really cool is what is

00:01:49.439 --> 00:01:54.050 
sense but what's really cool is what is
when<00:01:50.399> I<00:01:50.430> got<00:01:50.700> her<00:01:50.850> to<00:01:50.970> read<00:01:51.210> the<00:01:51.390> time<00:01:52.399> so<00:01:53.399> let's

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
when I got her to read the time so let's

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.300 
when I got her to read the time so let's
see<00:01:54.240> I<00:01:54.270> have<00:01:54.479> to<00:01:54.600> change<00:01:54.899> the<00:01:55.110> mode<00:01:55.409> to<00:01:55.770> time

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:56.310 
see I have to change the mode to time

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:59.690 
see I have to change the mode to time
talker<00:01:57.320> all<00:01:58.320> right<00:01:58.500> now<00:01:58.710> I'll<00:01:59.189> let<00:01:59.399> her<00:01:59.490> read

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
talker all right now I'll let her read

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:05.340 
talker all right now I'll let her read
the<00:01:59.850> time<00:02:02.869> pretty<00:02:03.869> cool<00:02:04.170> huh

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:05.350 
the time pretty cool huh

00:02:05.350 --> 00:02:07.920 
the time pretty cool huh
let<00:02:06.220> me<00:02:06.369> get<00:02:06.580> the<00:02:06.729> speaker<00:02:07.270> up<00:02:07.420> to<00:02:07.570> the<00:02:07.689> mic

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:07.930 
let me get the speaker up to the mic

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:14.370 
let me get the speaker up to the mic
here<00:02:10.980> 756<00:02:12.030> yeah<00:02:13.030> that's<00:02:13.930> pretty<00:02:14.170> cool

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:14.380 
here 756 yeah that's pretty cool

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:15.809 
here 756 yeah that's pretty cool
especially<00:02:14.530> in<00:02:15.010> the<00:02:15.069> morning<00:02:15.430> when<00:02:15.550> you<00:02:15.670> don't

00:02:15.809 --> 00:02:15.819 
especially in the morning when you don't

00:02:15.819 --> 00:02:19.229 
especially in the morning when you don't
feel<00:02:15.970> like<00:02:16.120> rolling<00:02:16.480> over<00:02:16.630> and<00:02:16.810> oops<00:02:17.650> oh<00:02:18.239> it

00:02:19.229 --> 00:02:19.239 
feel like rolling over and oops oh it

00:02:19.239 --> 00:02:21.540 
feel like rolling over and oops oh it
she<00:02:19.390> does<00:02:19.510> it<00:02:19.690> every<00:02:19.780> minute<00:02:20.050> in<00:02:20.739> the<00:02:21.130> morning

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:21.550 
she does it every minute in the morning

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:24.600 
she does it every minute in the morning
that's<00:02:21.640> really<00:02:22.030> handy<00:02:22.239> because<00:02:23.459> you<00:02:24.459> know<00:02:24.550> you

00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:24.610 
that's really handy because you know you

00:02:24.610 --> 00:02:27.510 
that's really handy because you know you
don't<00:02:24.819> want<00:02:25.030> to<00:02:25.650> look<00:02:26.650> you<00:02:27.010> know<00:02:27.100> roll<00:02:27.310> over

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:27.520 
don't want to look you know roll over

00:02:27.520 --> 00:02:29.550 
don't want to look you know roll over
and<00:02:27.610> look<00:02:27.790> at<00:02:27.880> the<00:02:28.000> time<00:02:28.260> now<00:02:29.260> i'm<00:02:29.350> going<00:02:29.500> to

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:29.560 
and look at the time now i'm going to

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:32.670 
and look at the time now i'm going to
set<00:02:29.709> it<00:02:29.739> up<00:02:29.860> an<00:02:30.010> alarm<00:02:30.280> mode<00:02:30.870> and<00:02:31.870> let<00:02:32.290> me<00:02:32.380> set

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:32.680 
set it up an alarm mode and let me set

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:40.350 
set it up an alarm mode and let me set
the<00:02:32.830> minute<00:02:33.220> here<00:02:33.580> to<00:02:33.790> trigger<00:02:34.270> off<00:02:39.150> time<00:02:40.150> for

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:40.360 
the minute here to trigger off time for

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:44.759 
the minute here to trigger off time for
you<00:02:40.420> to<00:02:40.450> wake<00:02:40.600> up<00:02:41.400> sound<00:02:42.400> momentarily<00:02:43.680> so<00:02:44.680> she

00:02:44.759 --> 00:02:44.769 
you to wake up sound momentarily so she

00:02:44.769 --> 00:02:46.979 
you to wake up sound momentarily so she
does<00:02:45.040> that<00:02:45.370> and<00:02:45.670> now<00:02:45.970> it<00:02:46.150> automatically<00:02:46.690> turns

00:02:46.979 --> 00:02:46.989 
does that and now it automatically turns

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:49.860 
does that and now it automatically turns
on<00:02:47.319> the<00:02:47.590> time<00:02:47.830> talker<00:02:48.220> so<00:02:48.610> she<00:02:48.670> talks<00:02:49.090> every

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:49.870 
on the time talker so she talks every

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:52.500 
on the time talker so she talks every
minute<00:02:50.200> but<00:02:51.190> again<00:02:51.400> this<00:02:51.550> video<00:02:51.760> is<00:02:51.940> just<00:02:52.150> for

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:52.510

00:02:57.870 --> 00:02:57.880 
that for there's the alarm let me turn

00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:00.180 
that for there's the alarm let me turn
that<00:02:57.940> off<00:02:58.299> but<00:02:58.959> yeah<00:02:59.049> this<00:02:59.230> video<00:02:59.530> is<00:02:59.620> just<00:02:59.680> too

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:00.190 
that off but yeah this video is just too

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:03.150 
that off but yeah this video is just too

then i'll leave a link to the shield in

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:08.729 
then i'll leave a link to the shield in
the<00:03:05.620> sidebar<00:03:06.630> the<00:03:07.630> code<00:03:07.840> super<00:03:08.230> easy<00:03:08.380> it<00:03:08.590> comes

00:03:08.729 --> 00:03:08.739 
the sidebar the code super easy it comes

00:03:08.739 --> 00:03:10.830 
the sidebar the code super easy it comes
the<00:03:08.920> ton<00:03:09.190> of<00:03:09.310> examples<00:03:09.880> and<00:03:10.060> what<00:03:10.600> i<00:03:10.630> like

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:10.840 
the ton of examples and what i like

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.630 
the ton of examples and what i like
about<00:03:10.870> this<00:03:11.320> shield<00:03:11.680> better<00:03:12.010> than<00:03:12.250> like<00:03:12.489> an

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:12.640 
about this shield better than like an

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:16.140 
about this shield better than like an
mp3<00:03:13.260> development<00:03:14.260> board<00:03:14.470> from<00:03:15.280> sparkfun<00:03:15.760> is

00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:16.150 
mp3 development board from sparkfun is

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:24.509 
mp3 development board from sparkfun is
that<00:03:16.570> you<00:03:16.720> can<00:03:21.299> here<00:03:22.299> she<00:03:22.510> goes<00:03:22.690> again<00:03:22.720> is<00:03:23.519> that

00:03:24.509 --> 00:03:24.519 
that you can here she goes again is that

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:26.940 
that you can here she goes again is that
with<00:03:25.030> this<00:03:25.239> you<00:03:25.510> can<00:03:25.540> program<00:03:25.930> it<00:03:26.140> to<00:03:26.320> do

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:26.950 
with this you can program it to do

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:29.430 
with this you can program it to do
different<00:03:27.340> things<00:03:27.370> like<00:03:27.840> for<00:03:28.840> example<00:03:28.930> on

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:29.440 
different things like for example on

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.710 
different things like for example on
this<00:03:29.620> board<00:03:30.100> she<00:03:30.579> just<00:03:30.760> sits<00:03:30.970> there<00:03:31.090> i'm

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:31.720 
this board she just sits there i'm

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:34.949 
this board she just sits there i'm
calling<00:03:32.350> her<00:03:32.620> she<00:03:32.890> but<00:03:33.239> the<00:03:34.239> arduino<00:03:34.690> just

00:03:34.949 --> 00:03:34.959 
calling her she but the arduino just

00:03:34.959 --> 00:03:37.140 
calling her she but the arduino just
sits<00:03:35.170> there<00:03:35.290> and<00:03:35.440> waits<00:03:35.890> for<00:03:36.100> serial<00:03:36.730> data<00:03:36.880> to

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:37.150 
sits there and waits for serial data to

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:39.240 
sits there and waits for serial data to
come<00:03:37.329> through<00:03:37.660> and<00:03:37.870> i<00:03:38.019> can<00:03:38.230> actually<00:03:38.680> call<00:03:38.980> out

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:39.250 
come through and i can actually call out

00:03:39.250 --> 00:03:43.560 
come through and i can actually call out
specific<00:03:40.180> files<00:03:41.019> on<00:03:41.380> the<00:03:42.160> SD<00:03:42.340> card<00:03:42.640> and<00:03:43.030> that's

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:43.570 
specific files on the SD card and that's

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:45.599 
specific files on the SD card and that's
what<00:03:43.720> i'm<00:03:43.840> doing<00:03:44.140> here<00:03:44.380> like<00:03:44.709> if<00:03:44.980> it<00:03:45.190> needed<00:03:45.430> to

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:45.609 
what i'm doing here like if it needed to

00:03:45.609 --> 00:03:48.620 
what i'm doing here like if it needed to
read<00:03:45.940> off<00:03:46.090> the<00:03:46.269> time<00:03:46.480> right<00:03:46.780> now<00:03:46.810> which<00:03:47.109> is<00:03:47.280> 758

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:48.630 
read off the time right now which is 758

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:53.520 
read off the time right now which is 758
it<00:03:49.630> would<00:03:50.109> just<00:03:50.260> send<00:03:50.560> a<00:03:50.739> hash<00:03:51.900> 007<00:03:52.900> to<00:03:53.320> call

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:53.530 
it would just send a hash 007 to call

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:59.550 
it would just send a hash 007 to call
out<00:03:53.739> seven<00:03:54.280> and<00:03:54.370> then<00:03:55.150> a<00:03:55.180> hash<00:03:56.910> 55<00:03:57.910> eight<00:03:58.299> or<00:03:59.109> a

00:03:59.550 --> 00:03:59.560 
out seven and then a hash 55 eight or a

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:03.420 
out seven and then a hash 55 eight or a
hash<00:03:59.970> 058<00:04:00.970> it's<00:04:01.600> three<00:04:02.290> character<00:04:02.769> things<00:04:03.250> i

00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:03.430 
hash 058 it's three character things i

00:04:03.430 --> 00:04:04.860 
hash 058 it's three character things i
set<00:04:03.640> up<00:04:03.760> the<00:04:03.850> whole<00:04:03.940> code<00:04:04.239> to<00:04:04.450> work<00:04:04.630> like<00:04:04.840> that

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:04.870 
set up the whole code to work like that

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:07.080 
set up the whole code to work like that
and<00:04:05.260> super<00:04:05.530> cool<00:04:05.739> and<00:04:05.950> the<00:04:06.519> quotes<00:04:06.790> are<00:04:06.970> the

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:07.090 
and super cool and the quotes are the

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:11.309 
and super cool and the quotes are the
same<00:04:07.299> thing<00:04:07.680> it's<00:04:08.680> like<00:04:08.829> a<00:04:08.859> q1<00:04:09.640> q2<00:04:10.060> and<00:04:10.600> all

00:04:11.309 --> 00:04:11.319 
same thing it's like a q1 q2 and all

00:04:11.319 --> 00:04:12.569 
same thing it's like a q1 q2 and all
that<00:04:11.500> but<00:04:11.620> i'll<00:04:11.769> leave<00:04:11.950> a<00:04:11.980> link<00:04:12.040> to<00:04:12.400> that<00:04:12.430> i

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:12.579 
that but i'll leave a link to that i

00:04:12.579 --> 00:04:14.039 
that but i'll leave a link to that i
hope<00:04:12.790> i<00:04:12.910> don't<00:04:13.090> waste<00:04:13.269> too<00:04:13.449> much<00:04:13.600> your<00:04:13.780> time

00:04:14.039 --> 00:04:14.049 
hope i don't waste too much your time

00:04:14.049 --> 00:04:15.990 
hope i don't waste too much your time
with<00:04:14.290> this<00:04:14.380> video<00:04:14.769> but<00:04:15.250> I<00:04:15.280> thought<00:04:15.489> it<00:04:15.940> was

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:16.000 
with this video but I thought it was

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.060 
with this video but I thought it was
pretty<00:04:16.180> cool

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.070 
pretty cool

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:21.140 
pretty cool
