00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:05.750
 Speaking of 

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:14.740
 8 

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:16.379
 It is a portable tank bag etc for the bike 

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:23.269
 Said 

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:23.269
 It is a state that I put in this punk bag if I say what kind of thing 

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:28.440
 Oh dear 

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.890
 It's Tapper 

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:35.130
 Etc and Well has become a state of Tupper 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:36.960
 I have a little bulky Nde antenna was a different type 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:41.200
 In battery-powered 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:43.490
 Switch type with a voltmeter 

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:47.980
 Because 

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:47.980
 Biker with gloved finger 

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:57.370
 One switch while driving on the highway 

00:00:52.210 --> 00:01:01.469
 Power is on and can be turned off with a single switch 

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:05.350
 Since Well etc are good only when you pass through the gate 

00:01:01.469 --> 00:01:09.700
 The power is turned on only when passing the gate, but there is no problem 

00:01:05.350 --> 00:01:10.720
 However, there are differences depending on the model before etc starts up, but it also takes 12 minutes 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:17.860
 Because there is 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:19.270
 Well 12 minutes ago I think that it is a form to put the switch on 12V 8 bottles in one battery 

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:21.320
 But I do 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:22.230
 If it is a battery 

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.020
 that 

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:27.590
 Well well 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:33.259
 Since it has been sold at auction, etc. We Katsui with but a tiny water 

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:35.380
 There are many switches that can not be operated while riding while riding that bike 

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:39.670
 So roughly 

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:41.510
 only about 10 hours from approximately 6 hours at Tsuke' Panashi also Depending on the etc and battery 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:44.630
 Do not have 

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:47.250
 You may not be able to return home 

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:50.000
 That easy 

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.000
 Switch on 

00:01:51.300 --> 00:02:02.760
 Noto you do not know at all it is is to have the battery in I tried to create a type that can be and go 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:04.410
 If Well done many times I think that there is also anxiety that I say I wonder if not squaring with this battery 

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:06.440
 So temporarily 

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:09.830
 Beneath it would put voltmeter 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:15.440
 If you see someone else 's blog 

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:16.490
 4.8 v I hear the Tteyuu was whether also depressed until about I also test 

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.400
 I tried to 

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:23.480
 It was 6.8 for this model 

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:29.420
 It disappeared at 6.8 volts 6.9 Bolter I'd somehow lucky 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:33.250
 So I think that it will move normally even if I go down to about 78 bould, so that key inside 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:38.200
 Because some people are driven by the battery in the holder 

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:41.530
 I think I think that I can not do at all It is also a decrease in that battery Hey that 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:49.300
 It comes to understand by one shot here 

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:52.530
 The state so as to keep much longer Nde form that say kill if it passes Well safe to use 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:52.530
 After all this is 

00:02:53.270 --> 00:03:00.920
 When the battery runs out, it's just a car. Not only that bike but also a car. 

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:04.590
 But 

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:08.540
 If there are those who are wearing shoe Galette 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:12.370
 It is also available once Pradesh Galette 

00:03:08.540 --> 00:03:12.370
 Nde only insertion of Furano line 

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:18.350
 It's here , so just plug in the battery so this plug 

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:22.220
 Saying the 

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:28.610
 If you insert a cigarette plug 

00:03:26.590 --> 00:03:31.900
 12 v 

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:31.900
 It is also possible to go with this 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:35.930
 Oh dear 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:40.180
 On the bike 

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:44.760
 Although I'm a little harsh hope is the type there is no plug-in Shugaretto 

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:44.760
 I think there are some people who are wearing these days 

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.630
 Even if it is not battery, this is probably 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:50.940
 Kess 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:56.630
 Put on 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:59.290
 Nde in ways that say went completely through put in 12 minutes before passing through 

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:59.290
 Probably 

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:06.040
 1 month about is do not you go comfortably because I think that 80 times can be sufficiently passed through 

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:08.849
 Ne 

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.849
 It is such a form 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:14.710
 Oh dear 

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:18.720
 I'm going to make a few pieces so tomorrow 

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:18.720
 I will try running test with this 

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:29.080
 And I try to make such a biker and you are riding a bike 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:33.550
 Why not try to make because I think that some people Tteyuu star 

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:35.639
 It is Table 3 of tank back It is smoking a little bit 

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:35.639
 eh 

00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:39.180
 I wanted 

00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:44.729
 Thank you 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:49.759
 Mature mother 

00:04:44.729 --> 00:04:49.759
 Well put on the tank again from the outside 

00:04:50.020 --> 00:04:58.270
 With the left hand wearing the glove 

00:04:53.449 --> 00:05:02.890
 Simply because it has to be able to put or perfect switch 

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:03.849
 I wonder if it's easy to use as a bike and I tried to make something like this 

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:07.030
 a 

00:05:03.849 --> 00:05:13.890
 If you want to make 

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:13.890
 It is more than please take a look because I think let's hobbling and how to make and stuff
