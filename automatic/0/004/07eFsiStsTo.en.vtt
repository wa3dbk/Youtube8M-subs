left and now the one to the right so
their<00:03:14.430> contours<00:03:15.030> match<00:03:16.220> you<00:03:17.220> have<00:03:17.400> to<00:03:17.549> reverse

00:03:17.979 --> 00:03:17.989 
their contours match you have to reverse

00:03:17.989 --> 00:03:20.840 
their contours match you have to reverse
the<00:03:18.989> paper<00:03:19.200> and<00:03:19.530> repeat<00:03:20.100> the<00:03:20.579> same<00:03:20.790> thing

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:20.850

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:33.300 
now you can see at the base there is a

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:38.650 
now you can see at the base there is a
small<00:03:33.780> hole<00:03:34.140> just<00:03:34.980> like<00:03:35.280> the<00:03:35.520> paper<00:03:36.560> waterbomb

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:38.660
