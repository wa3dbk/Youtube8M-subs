have done that before it's kind of a

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.280 
have done that before it's kind of a
thing<00:01:56.729> that<00:01:56.790> may<00:01:57.149> see<00:01:57.210> like<00:01:57.600> in<00:01:57.810> the<00:01:58.049> Middle

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
thing that may see like in the Middle

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.200 
thing that may see like in the Middle
East<00:01:58.500> you<00:01:58.619> know<00:01:58.710> what<00:01:59.100> fights<00:01:59.399> of<00:01:59.700> this

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
East you know what fights of this

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.649 
East you know what fights of this
next<00:02:00.329> one<00:02:00.540> is<00:02:00.570> is<00:02:00.869> good<00:02:01.229> deed

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:02.659 
next one is is good deed

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:05.349 
next one is is good deed
this<00:02:03.320> is<00:02:03.469> basically<00:02:03.829> when<00:02:04.399> a<00:02:04.429> player<00:02:04.939> calls<00:02:05.240> a

00:02:05.349 --> 00:02:05.359 
this is basically when a player calls a

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:07.510 
this is basically when a player calls a
timeout<00:02:05.600> just<00:02:06.530> so<00:02:06.679> something<00:02:07.069> does<00:02:07.189> not<00:02:07.219> have

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:07.520 
timeout just so something does not have

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.190 
timeout just so something does not have
to<00:02:07.700> a<00:02:07.729> player<00:02:07.999> and<00:02:08.179> actually<00:02:08.479> back<00:02:08.660> in<00:02:08.690> the<00:02:08.929> 90

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:09.200 
to a player and actually back in the 90

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.619 
to a player and actually back in the 90
two<00:02:09.349> finals<00:02:09.830> the<00:02:10.369> Michael<00:02:11.000> Jordan<00:02:11.150> called<00:02:11.510> a

00:02:11.619 --> 00:02:11.629 
two finals the Michael Jordan called a

00:02:11.629 --> 00:02:13.360 
two finals the Michael Jordan called a
timeout<00:02:11.959> so<00:02:12.230> nobody<00:02:12.530> would<00:02:12.650> step<00:02:12.920> on<00:02:13.040> Horace

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370 
timeout so nobody would step on Horace

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:15.759 
timeout so nobody would step on Horace
Grant<00:02:13.580> glasses<00:02:14.209> so<00:02:14.870> he's<00:02:15.049> actually<00:02:15.170> got<00:02:15.410> 100

00:02:15.759 --> 00:02:15.769 
Grant glasses so he's actually got 100

00:02:15.769 --> 00:02:17.800 
Grant glasses so he's actually got 100
of<00:02:15.830> these<00:02:15.920> in<00:02:16.069> this<00:02:16.190> whole<00:02:16.430> career<00:02:16.760> 20<00:02:17.390> LeBron

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:17.810 
of these in this whole career 20 LeBron

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:20.559 
of these in this whole career 20 LeBron
James<00:02:18.110> 71<00:02:18.980> good<00:02:19.280> deeds<00:02:19.519> so<00:02:20.060> LeBron<00:02:20.299> James

00:02:20.559 --> 00:02:20.569 
James 71 good deeds so LeBron James

00:02:20.569 --> 00:02:21.759 
James 71 good deeds so LeBron James
definitely<00:02:20.900> is<00:02:20.959> not<00:02:21.019> far<00:02:21.230> behind<00:02:21.319> and<00:02:21.709> I

00:02:21.759 --> 00:02:21.769 
definitely is not far behind and I

00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:23.020 
definitely is not far behind and I
definitely<00:02:21.980> think<00:02:22.280> they<00:02:22.430> can't<00:02:22.580> catch<00:02:22.730> up<00:02:22.910> to

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:23.030 
definitely think they can't catch up to

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:25.630 
definitely think they can't catch up to
them<00:02:23.120> within<00:02:23.540> the<00:02:23.690> next<00:02:23.840> few<00:02:23.989> seasons<00:02:24.640> and

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:25.640 
them within the next few seasons and

00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.190 
them within the next few seasons and
then<00:02:25.790> you<00:02:25.849> have<00:02:26.000> the<00:02:26.150> metric<00:02:26.569> of<00:02:26.720> a<00:02:26.989> player

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.200 
then you have the metric of a player

00:02:27.200 --> 00:02:29.500 
then you have the metric of a player
jumping<00:02:27.680> so<00:02:27.860> high<00:02:27.890> that<00:02:28.459> they<00:02:28.970> actually<00:02:29.299> get

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 
jumping so high that they actually get

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:30.759 
jumping so high that they actually get
stuck<00:02:29.690> on<00:02:29.810> the<00:02:29.900> backboard<00:02:30.290> you<00:02:30.590> know<00:02:30.680> they

00:02:30.759 --> 00:02:30.769 
stuck on the backboard you know they

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:32.229 
stuck on the backboard you know they
they<00:02:30.920> jump<00:02:31.160> so<00:02:31.489> high<00:02:31.519> in<00:02:31.849> the<00:02:31.940> air<00:02:31.970> because

00:02:32.229 --> 00:02:32.239 
they jump so high in the air because

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:33.910 
they jump so high in the air because
they're<00:02:32.450> vertical<00:02:32.629> is<00:02:32.900> just<00:02:33.080> insanely<00:02:33.500> crazy

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:33.920 
they're vertical is just insanely crazy

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.400 
they're vertical is just insanely crazy
and<00:02:34.340> they<00:02:34.879> jump<00:02:35.299> really<00:02:35.480> high<00:02:35.599> in<00:02:35.930> the<00:02:36.019> egg<00:02:36.230> and

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:36.410 
and they jump really high in the egg and

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:37.780 
and they jump really high in the egg and
actually<00:02:36.650> a<00:02:36.709> fireman<00:02:37.040> has<00:02:37.220> to<00:02:37.340> come<00:02:37.549> with<00:02:37.760> a

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:37.790 
actually a fireman has to come with a

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:39.970 
actually a fireman has to come with a
fire<00:02:38.000> truck<00:02:38.269> and<00:02:38.510> get<00:02:39.290> a<00:02:39.319> ladder<00:02:39.530> and<00:02:39.680> bring

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:51.410 
prime right now so we'll see how we'll

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:53.710 
prime right now so we'll see how we'll
see<00:02:51.500> how<00:02:51.590> he<00:02:51.620> does<00:02:51.739> that<00:02:52.040> going<00:02:52.579> forward<00:02:52.819> now
