just<00:00:18.200> want<00:00:18.349> to<00:00:18.380> show<00:00:18.650> the<00:00:18.860> bar<00:00:19.099> to<00:00:19.369> the<00:00:19.640> people

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:20.029 
just want to show the bar to the people

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:21.820 
just want to show the bar to the people
at<00:00:20.150> home<00:00:20.180> is<00:00:20.570> you<00:00:20.900> can<00:00:21.110> look<00:00:21.200> at<00:00:21.320> this<00:00:21.410> bar<00:00:21.650> this

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:21.830 
at home is you can look at this bar this

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:24.040 
at home is you can look at this bar this
bar<00:00:21.890> as<00:00:22.189> is<00:00:22.400> these<00:00:22.759> quite<00:00:23.000> oddly<00:00:23.270> shapes<00:00:23.750> but

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:24.050 
bar as is these quite oddly shapes but

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:25.480 
bar as is these quite oddly shapes but
it's<00:00:24.169> obvious<00:00:24.439> shaped<00:00:24.680> for<00:00:24.890> a<00:00:24.950> good<00:00:25.130> reason

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:25.490 
it's obvious shaped for a good reason

00:00:25.490 --> 00:00:27.760 
it's obvious shaped for a good reason
and<00:00:25.580> you'll<00:00:25.759> see<00:00:26.029> when<00:00:26.599> Danny<00:00:27.259> actually<00:00:27.470> does

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:27.770 
and you'll see when Danny actually does

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:29.500 
and you'll see when Danny actually does
this<00:00:27.890> exercise<00:00:28.400> before<00:00:28.760> Danny<00:00:28.939> gets<00:00:29.180> going

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:29.510 
this exercise before Danny gets going

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:31.269 
this exercise before Danny gets going
one<00:00:30.109> of<00:00:30.199> the<00:00:30.260> things<00:00:30.439> I<00:00:30.560> like<00:00:30.740> to<00:00:30.949> do<00:00:31.099> with

00:00:31.269 --> 00:00:31.279 
one of the things I like to do with

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:33.340 
one of the things I like to do with
lying<00:00:31.490> tricep<00:00:31.880> extension<00:00:32.510> you<00:00:32.870> know<00:00:32.960> probably

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:33.350 
lying tricep extension you know probably

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:35.470 
lying tricep extension you know probably
80<00:00:33.590> at<00:00:33.800> least<00:00:33.980> 80<00:00:34.160> percent<00:00:34.280> of<00:00:34.550> the<00:00:34.640> time<00:00:34.820> is<00:00:35.150> do

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:35.480 
80 at least 80 percent of the time is do

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:37.150 
80 at least 80 percent of the time is do
putting<00:00:35.809> it<00:00:35.900> on<00:00:35.960> a<00:00:35.989> decline<00:00:36.530> the<00:00:36.710> reason<00:00:37.010> why

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:37.160 
putting it on a decline the reason why

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.189 
putting it on a decline the reason why
we<00:00:37.309> put<00:00:37.489> it<00:00:37.580> on<00:00:37.670> a<00:00:37.699> decline<00:00:38.269> you<00:00:38.750> saw<00:00:38.960> that<00:00:39.080> we

00:00:39.189 --> 00:00:39.199 
we put it on a decline you saw that we

00:00:39.199 --> 00:00:42.189 
we put it on a decline you saw that we
allow<00:00:39.410> for<00:00:39.470> maximal<00:00:40.309> range<00:00:40.879> of<00:00:41.120> motion<00:00:41.600> whilst

00:00:42.189 --> 00:00:42.199 
allow for maximal range of motion whilst

00:00:42.199 --> 00:00:44.200 
allow for maximal range of motion whilst
doing<00:00:42.379> this<00:00:42.559> exercise<00:00:43.100> so<00:00:43.519> if<00:00:43.610> Danny<00:00:43.820> grabs<00:00:44.030> it

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:44.210 
doing this exercise so if Danny grabs it

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:47.340 
doing this exercise so if Danny grabs it
grabs<00:00:44.600> the<00:00:44.720> bar<00:00:44.900> yep<00:00:45.350> and<00:00:45.670> takes<00:00:46.670> it<00:00:46.820> away

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:47.350 
grabs the bar yep and takes it away

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:49.299 
grabs the bar yep and takes it away
we're<00:00:48.350> just<00:00:48.500> getting<00:00:48.710> to<00:00:48.769> demonstrate<00:00:49.280> a

couple begin with and I'll point out
some<00:00:51.470> common<00:00:51.830> errors<00:00:52.190> and<00:00:52.489> pitfalls<00:00:53.089> that<00:00:53.239> a

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:53.510 
some common errors and pitfalls that a

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:55.750 
some common errors and pitfalls that a
lot<00:00:53.659> of<00:00:53.690> people<00:00:53.989> do<00:00:54.140> the<00:00:54.710> beauty<00:00:55.159> of<00:00:55.190> this<00:00:55.489> bar

lot of people do the beauty of this bar

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:57.969 
lot of people do the beauty of this bar
is<00:00:55.970> as<00:00:56.089> Danny<00:00:56.330> does<00:00:56.600> it<00:00:56.750> as<00:00:56.839> you<00:00:56.960> can<00:00:57.140> see<00:00:57.409> it

00:00:57.969 --> 00:00:57.979 
is as Danny does it as you can see it

00:00:57.979 --> 00:01:00.250 
is as Danny does it as you can see it
goes<00:00:58.400> right<00:00:58.610> right<00:00:59.269> into<00:00:59.600> her<00:00:59.750> shoulder<00:00:59.960> now

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:00.260 
goes right right into her shoulder now

goes right right into her shoulder now
back<00:01:00.440> up<00:01:00.650> and<00:01:01.479> exaggerate<00:01:02.479> the<00:01:02.720> range<00:01:02.900> of

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:03.049 
back up and exaggerate the range of

back up and exaggerate the range of
motion<00:01:03.500> for<00:01:03.710> allowing<00:01:04.189> maximal<00:01:04.820> tension

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:05.110 
motion for allowing maximal tension

with<00:01:10.790> a<00:01:10.939> decline<00:01:11.330> it<00:01:11.540> makes<00:01:11.720> it<00:01:11.840> even<00:01:11.960> even

00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:12.530 
with a decline it makes it even even

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:14.620 
with a decline it makes it even even
better<00:01:12.770> now<00:01:13.700> common<00:01:14.060> mistakes<00:01:14.390> that<00:01:14.450> people

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:14.630 
better now common mistakes that people

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:16.450 
better now common mistakes that people
make<00:01:14.900> is<00:01:15.080> she<00:01:15.170> does<00:01:15.350> it<00:01:15.500> she<00:01:15.920> flares<00:01:16.189> out<00:01:16.310> our

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:16.460 
make is she does it she flares out our

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:17.859 
make is she does it she flares out our
elbows<00:01:16.759> just<00:01:16.939> purposely<00:01:17.240> flares<00:01:17.630> that<00:01:17.689> our

00:01:17.859 --> 00:01:17.869 
elbows just purposely flares that our

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:19.389 
elbows just purposely flares that our
elbows<00:01:18.140> a<00:01:18.289> lot<00:01:18.649> of<00:01:18.710> the<00:01:18.770> time<00:01:18.950> people<00:01:18.979> come

00:01:19.389 --> 00:01:19.399 
elbows a lot of the time people come

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:20.770 
elbows a lot of the time people come
past<00:01:19.670> and<00:01:19.939> like<00:01:20.030> oh<00:01:20.149> that's<00:01:20.359> wrong<00:01:20.600> they're

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:20.780 
past and like oh that's wrong they're

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:22.599 
past and like oh that's wrong they're
gonna<00:01:20.869> push<00:01:21.320> the<00:01:21.500> elbows<00:01:21.859> in<00:01:22.039> now<00:01:22.460> you're

00:01:22.599 --> 00:01:22.609 
gonna push the elbows in now you're

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:24.249 
gonna push the elbows in now you're
doing<00:01:23.030> that<00:01:23.329> you<00:01:23.509> can<00:01:23.659> put<00:01:23.780> a<00:01:23.810> lot<00:01:23.929> of<00:01:24.049> tension

00:01:24.249 --> 00:01:24.259 
doing that you can put a lot of tension

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:25.990 
doing that you can put a lot of tension
on<00:01:24.439> the<00:01:24.560> shoulders<00:01:24.979> and<00:01:25.130> on<00:01:25.340> the<00:01:25.460> elbow<00:01:25.820> joint

00:01:25.990 --> 00:01:26.000 
on the shoulders and on the elbow joint

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.639 
on the shoulders and on the elbow joint
itself<00:01:26.420> so<00:01:26.689> I<00:01:26.719> don't<00:01:26.960> recommend<00:01:27.409> doing<00:01:27.439> that

00:01:27.639 --> 00:01:27.649 
itself so I don't recommend doing that

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:29.739 
itself so I don't recommend doing that
if<00:01:28.130> you're<00:01:28.310> training<00:01:28.670> part<00:01:28.909> that<00:01:29.149> does<00:01:29.420> that

00:01:29.739 --> 00:01:29.749 
if you're training part that does that

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:31.719 
if you're training part that does that
just<00:01:30.320> simply<00:01:30.619> instruct<00:01:30.979> them<00:01:31.100> to<00:01:31.249> push<00:01:31.700> their

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:31.729 
just simply instruct them to push their

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:33.669 
just simply instruct them to push their
elbows<00:01:32.210> in<00:01:32.390> now<00:01:32.749> back<00:01:32.990> up<00:01:33.200> to<00:01:33.350> keep<00:01:33.530> the

00:01:33.669 --> 00:01:33.679 
elbows in now back up to keep the

00:01:33.679 --> 00:01:35.349 
elbows in now back up to keep the
tension<00:01:34.039> there<00:01:34.219> now<00:01:34.700> the<00:01:34.759> common<00:01:35.090> mistake

00:01:35.349 --> 00:01:35.359 
tension there now the common mistake

00:01:35.359 --> 00:01:37.810 
tension there now the common mistake
people<00:01:35.390> make<00:01:35.719> is<00:01:36.109> if<00:01:36.259> she<00:01:36.409> pushes<00:01:36.770> forward<00:01:37.159> now

00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:37.820 
people make is if she pushes forward now
