a zone he doesn't communicate and he if

00:02:59.820 --> 00:03:02.000 
a zone he doesn't communicate and he if
you<00:02:59.970> ask<00:03:00.180> karma<00:03:00.600> if<00:03:00.750> you<00:03:00.870> said<00:03:01.050> karma<00:03:01.440> what

that's<00:03:37.170> why<00:03:37.320> they're<00:03:37.530> so<00:03:37.680> good<00:03:37.950> and<00:03:38.190> I<00:03:38.970> think

00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:39.300 
that's why they're so good and I think

00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:41.660 
that's why they're so good and I think
that<00:03:39.570> mr.<00:03:40.440> X<00:03:40.620> somebody<00:03:41.220> on<00:03:41.310> complexity

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670 
that mr. X somebody on complexity

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:43.600 
that mr. X somebody on complexity
recognized<00:03:42.209> that<00:03:42.450> karma<00:03:42.840> likes<00:03:42.989> that<00:03:43.260> and

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:43.610 
recognized that karma likes that and

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:46.610 
recognized that karma likes that and
they<00:03:44.610> decided<00:03:45.030> okay<00:03:45.420> crim<00:03:45.660> six<00:03:45.900> you're<00:03:46.560> gonna

do a lot more communication and

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:50.210 
do a lot more communication and
listening<00:03:48.989> to<00:03:49.019> crim<00:03:49.350> communicate<00:03:49.920> has<00:03:50.040> been

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
listening to crim communicate has been

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.670 
listening to crim communicate has been
great<00:03:50.459> I<00:03:50.640> mean<00:03:50.790> I<00:03:50.820> I'm<00:03:51.120> I've<00:03:51.720> been<00:03:51.959> shocked<00:03:52.320> to

00:03:52.670 --> 00:03:52.680 
great I mean I I'm I've been shocked to

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.070 
great I mean I I'm I've been shocked to
watch<00:03:52.890> the<00:03:53.130> way<00:03:53.250> the<00:03:53.430> crim<00:03:53.670> has<00:03:53.880> changed<00:03:54.600> his

00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:55.080 
watch the way the crim has changed his

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:57.259 
watch the way the crim has changed his
whole<00:03:55.290> play<00:03:55.680> style<00:03:56.040> he's<00:03:56.280> changed<00:03:56.790> how<00:03:57.209> he

00:03:57.259 --> 00:03:57.269 
whole play style he's changed how he

00:03:57.269 --> 00:03:59.300 
whole play style he's changed how he
acted<00:03:57.959> in<00:03:58.140> game<00:03:58.470> and<00:03:58.680> he's<00:03:58.800> really<00:03:58.950> helping

00:03:59.300 --> 00:03:59.310 
acted in game and he's really helping

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:02.479 
acted in game and he's really helping
the<00:03:59.430> team<00:03:59.640> and<00:03:59.850> so<00:04:00.000> I<00:04:00.890> think<00:04:01.890> complexities

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:02.489 
the team and so I think complexities

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:05.300 
the team and so I think complexities
gonna<00:04:02.640> win<00:04:03.050> you<00:04:04.050> know<00:04:04.170> they're<00:04:04.530> they're

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:05.310 
gonna win you know they're they're

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:06.560 
gonna win you know they're they're
becoming<00:04:05.640> the<00:04:05.790> Lakers<00:04:06.090> for<00:04:06.269> everybody

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:06.570 
becoming the Lakers for everybody

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:08.540 
becoming the Lakers for everybody
everybody's<00:04:07.140> villain<00:04:07.470> you<00:04:07.680> know<00:04:07.800> but<00:04:08.010> I<00:04:08.220> think

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:08.550 
everybody's villain you know but I think

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:10.400 
everybody's villain you know but I think
they're<00:04:08.640> gonna<00:04:08.760> win<00:04:08.940> and<00:04:09.150> I<00:04:09.660> think<00:04:09.930> Kersh<00:04:10.110> lv

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:10.410 
they're gonna win and I think Kersh lv

00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:12.020 
they're gonna win and I think Kersh lv
is<00:04:10.530> going<00:04:10.650> to<00:04:10.709> get<00:04:10.769> second<00:04:11.160> because<00:04:11.400> they've

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.030 
is going to get second because they've

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:14.539 
is going to get second because they've
been<00:04:12.060> the<00:04:12.330> most<00:04:12.480> consistent<00:04:12.600> team<00:04:13.320> in<00:04:13.739> second

00:04:14.539 --> 00:04:14.549 
been the most consistent team in second

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:15.979 
been the most consistent team in second
place<00:04:14.700> you<00:04:14.970> know<00:04:15.060> they've<00:04:15.269> they've<00:04:15.660> gotten

00:04:15.979 --> 00:04:15.989 
place you know they've they've gotten

00:04:15.989 --> 00:04:18.440 
place you know they've they've gotten
2nd<00:04:16.350> place<00:04:16.380> in<00:04:16.500> like<00:04:16.799> all<00:04:16.979> of<00:04:17.430> the<00:04:17.519> 2k<00:04:17.880> +<00:04:18.030> 5<00:04:18.209> k

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:18.450 
2nd place in like all of the 2k + 5 k

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:20.060 
2nd place in like all of the 2k + 5 k
series<00:04:18.840> and<00:04:19.049> then<00:04:19.260> they<00:04:19.380> won<00:04:19.590> the<00:04:19.709> last<00:04:19.859> one

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:20.070 
series and then they won the last one

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:23.120 
series and then they won the last one
against<00:04:20.280> optic<00:04:20.669> which<00:04:21.289> it's<00:04:22.289> debatable<00:04:22.830> optic

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.130 
against optic which it's debatable optic

00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:25.190 
against optic which it's debatable optic
shuttle<00:04:23.340> one<00:04:23.520> but<00:04:23.789> you<00:04:23.970> know<00:04:24.090> curse<00:04:24.840> lv<00:04:25.050> i

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:25.200 
shuttle one but you know curse lv i

00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:26.180 
shuttle one but you know curse lv i
think<00:04:25.500> they're<00:04:25.590> going<00:04:25.680> to<00:04:25.740> take<00:04:25.830> second<00:04:26.160> place

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:26.190 
think they're going to take second place

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:27.690 
think they're going to take second place
and<00:04:26.490> then<00:04:26.640> I<00:04:26.729> think<00:04:26.940> TK<00:04:27.240> is<00:04:27.360> going<00:04:27.479> to<00:04:27.539> get

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:27.700 
and then I think TK is going to get

00:04:27.700 --> 00:04:29.880 
and then I think TK is going to get
third<00:04:27.820> because<00:04:28.150> clay<00:04:28.390> sir<00:04:28.570> is<00:04:28.840> going<00:04:29.650> to<00:04:29.740> be

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:29.890 
third because clay sir is going to be

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:34.110 
third because clay sir is going to be
hungry<00:04:30.490> to<00:04:30.520> prove<00:04:30.850> something<00:04:31.330> and<00:04:33.000> TK<00:04:34.000> has

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:34.120 
hungry to prove something and TK has

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:35.520 
hungry to prove something and TK has
always<00:04:34.450> been<00:04:34.600> a<00:04:34.660> great<00:04:34.870> team<00:04:35.110> since<00:04:35.380> they've

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:35.530 
always been a great team since they've

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:36.780 
always been a great team since they've
come<00:04:35.560> together<00:04:35.890> since<00:04:36.280> they<00:04:36.400> got<00:04:36.490> into<00:04:36.730> you

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:36.790 
come together since they got into you

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:38.640 
come together since they got into you
know<00:04:36.880> they<00:04:36.970> picked<00:04:37.180> up<00:04:37.270> Nez<00:04:37.450> low<00:04:37.660> and<00:04:37.930> they've

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:38.650 
know they picked up Nez low and they've

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:40.110

tournament<00:04:40.420> except<00:04:41.260> one<00:04:41.500> I<00:04:41.530> think<00:04:41.800> different

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:42.010 
tournament except one I think different

00:04:42.010 --> 00:04:45.000

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:46.600 
they do on land and how well they do

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:48.390 
they do on land and how well they do
with<00:04:46.780> clay<00:04:46.960> sir<00:04:47.140> and<00:04:47.380> watching<00:04:47.950> some<00:04:48.130> of<00:04:48.160> clays

00:04:48.390 --> 00:04:48.400 
with clay sir and watching some of clays

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:49.710 
with clay sir and watching some of clays
videos<00:04:48.850> and<00:04:49.180> the<00:04:49.240> streams<00:04:49.510> their

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:49.720 
videos and the streams their

00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:51.390 
videos and the streams their
communication<00:04:50.380> it<00:04:50.650> seems<00:04:51.130> like<00:04:51.190> they're

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:51.400 
communication it seems like they're

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:54.060 
communication it seems like they're
still<00:04:51.670> kind<00:04:52.030> of<00:04:52.120> figure<00:04:52.870> out<00:04:53.110> exactly<00:04:53.770> how<00:04:54.010> to

00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:54.070 
still kind of figure out exactly how to

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:00.880 
is going to be real interesting and I

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:02.910 
is going to be real interesting and I
think<00:05:01.210> optic<00:05:01.720> will<00:05:01.930> finish<00:05:02.140> top<00:05:02.380> eight<00:05:02.620> cuz<00:05:02.860> I
