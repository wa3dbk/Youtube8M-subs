00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:09.900 
underneath the crown mold and I'm using

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:11.720 
underneath the crown mold and I'm using
it<00:00:10.139> with<00:00:10.380> a<00:00:10.410> Festool<00:00:11.070> router

dust collection dust extractor on it and
it<00:00:23.460> works<00:00:23.670> great<00:00:23.820> I<00:00:26.510> made<00:00:27.510> up<00:00:27.689> a<00:00:27.810> little

00:00:27.830 --> 00:00:27.840 
it works great I made up a little

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:33.799 
it works great I made up a little
homemade<00:00:28.320> jig<00:00:28.650> that<00:00:30.320> makes<00:00:31.320> the<00:00:32.540> dental<00:00:33.540> part

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809 
homemade jig that makes the dental part

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:37.580 
homemade jig that makes the dental part
of<00:00:33.930> it<00:00:34.079> and<00:00:35.390> I<00:00:36.390> can<00:00:36.960> make<00:00:36.989> one<00:00:37.350> of<00:00:37.380> these<00:00:37.530> in

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
of it and I can make one of these in

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.420 
of it and I can make one of these in
less<00:00:37.980> than<00:00:38.160> 10<00:00:38.399> minutes<00:00:38.930> my<00:00:39.930> Festool<00:00:40.379> tools<00:00:41.219> I

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:41.430 
less than 10 minutes my Festool tools I

00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:42.950 
less than 10 minutes my Festool tools I
can<00:00:41.640> really<00:00:41.850> get<00:00:42.120> this<00:00:42.270> done<00:00:42.329> quickly<00:00:42.930> and

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
can really get this done quickly and

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.250 
can really get this done quickly and
have<00:00:43.170> a<00:00:43.200> beautiful<00:00:44.780> molding<00:00:45.780> put<00:00:45.989> underneath

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
have a beautiful molding put underneath

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:48.400

a<00:00:46.500> nice<00:00:47.039> looking<00:00:47.309> crown<00:00:47.579> molding<00:00:47.910> like<00:00:47.940> that

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:48.410 
a nice looking crown molding like that

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:50.630 
a nice looking crown molding like that
so<00:00:49.410> I'm<00:00:49.559> going<00:00:49.739> to<00:00:49.770> show<00:00:49.980> you<00:00:50.010> how<00:00:50.219> to<00:00:50.280> do<00:00:50.460> this

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:50.640 
so I'm going to show you how to do this

00:00:50.640 --> 00:01:19.800 
so I'm going to show you how to do this
and<00:00:51.920> I<00:00:53.390> hope<00:00:54.390> you<00:00:54.570> like<00:00:54.750> it

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:19.810 

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:22.440 

we're<00:01:20.380> using<00:01:20.619> this<00:01:20.950> jig<00:01:21.250> to<00:01:21.520> cut<00:01:21.760> the<00:01:21.970> grooves

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:22.450 
we're using this jig to cut the grooves

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:25.350 
we're using this jig to cut the grooves
I<00:01:23.010> like<00:01:24.010> to<00:01:24.220> use<00:01:24.369> this<00:01:24.580> best<00:01:24.909> old<00:01:25.119> dust

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:25.360 
I like to use this best old dust

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.420 
I like to use this best old dust
extractor<00:01:25.869> because<00:01:26.350> it<00:01:26.500> pulls<00:01:26.740> the<00:01:26.979> chips<00:01:27.250> out

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:27.430 
extractor because it pulls the chips out

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:29.370 
extractor because it pulls the chips out
of<00:01:27.520> agree<00:01:27.850> with<00:01:27.880> when<00:01:28.330> I<00:01:28.360> set<00:01:28.750> the<00:01:28.960> gig<00:01:29.200> into

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:29.380 
of agree with when I set the gig into

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:30.810 
of agree with when I set the gig into
the<00:01:29.619> next<00:01:29.950> groove

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:30.820 
the next groove

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:32.910 
the next groove
there's<00:01:31.299> nothing<00:01:31.750> there<00:01:31.930> to<00:01:32.140> hold<00:01:32.350> it<00:01:32.500> up<00:01:32.710> and

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:32.920 
there's nothing there to hold it up and

00:01:32.920 --> 00:02:19.090 
there's nothing there to hold it up and
and<00:01:33.220> mess<00:01:33.759> up<00:01:33.970> my<00:01:34.030> cut

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:19.100 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.500 

so<00:02:20.100> I'm<00:02:20.220> going<00:02:20.400> to<00:02:20.460> change<00:02:20.670> the<00:02:21.000> bed<00:02:21.150> in<00:02:21.300> this

00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:21.510 
so I'm going to change the bed in this

00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:23.990 
so I'm going to change the bed in this
and<00:02:21.810> then<00:02:21.960> run<00:02:22.770> an<00:02:22.920> edge<00:02:23.070> along<00:02:23.430> here<00:02:23.820> and

00:02:23.990 --> 00:02:24.000 
and then run an edge along here and

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.780 
and then run an edge along here and
we'll<00:02:24.960> have<00:02:25.170> the<00:02:25.410> molding<00:02:26.100> complete<00:02:26.490> I<00:02:26.520> like

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:26.790 
we'll have the molding complete I like

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:29.420 
we'll have the molding complete I like
the<00:02:26.940> way<00:02:27.060> these<00:02:27.240> change<00:02:27.800> as<00:02:28.800> always<00:02:29.280> you

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
the way these change as always you

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.130 
the way these change as always you
always<00:02:29.460> want<00:02:29.880> to<00:02:29.940> disconnect<00:02:30.420> the<00:02:30.600> power<00:02:30.630> when

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140 
always want to disconnect the power when

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:33.740 
always want to disconnect the power when
you<00:02:31.290> change<00:02:31.590> it<00:02:31.770> bit<00:02:32.100> the<00:02:32.940> next<00:02:33.150> alene<00:02:33.540> turn

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:33.750 
you change it bit the next alene turn

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:34.190 
you change it bit the next alene turn
off

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:34.200 
off

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:44.110 
off
I<00:02:36.920> like<00:02:37.920> the<00:02:38.100> ratcheting<00:02:39.050> design<00:02:40.050> on<00:02:40.320> this

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:49.400 

that's<00:02:45.120> loose<00:02:47.300> really<00:02:48.300> makes<00:02:48.660> changing<00:02:49.170> bits

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:49.410 
that's loose really makes changing bits

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:57.170 
that's loose really makes changing bits
easier<00:02:49.890> and<00:02:50.310> put<00:02:50.640> the<00:02:50.760> edge<00:02:50.910> bit<00:02:51.270> in<00:02:55.970> push<00:02:56.970> this

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
easier and put the edge bit in push this

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:29.089 
easier and put the edge bit in push this
down<00:02:57.920> this<00:02:58.920> way<00:03:14.480> I'll<00:03:15.480> set<00:03:15.780> the<00:03:15.930> depth

00:03:29.089 --> 00:03:29.099 

00:03:29.099 --> 00:03:31.800 

and<00:03:30.099> that's<00:03:30.400> all<00:03:30.579> there<00:03:30.730> is<00:03:30.909> to<00:03:31.150> changing<00:03:31.180> that

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:31.810 
and that's all there is to changing that

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:35.429 
and that's all there is to changing that
bit<00:03:32.069> when<00:03:33.069> you're<00:03:33.599> putting<00:03:34.599> an<00:03:34.689> edge<00:03:34.870> profile

00:03:35.429 --> 00:03:35.439 
bit when you're putting an edge profile

00:03:35.439 --> 00:03:38.880 
bit when you're putting an edge profile
on<00:03:35.769> wood<00:03:36.700> like<00:03:36.939> oak<00:03:37.239> or<00:03:37.540> pretty<00:03:38.379> much<00:03:38.439> anything

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:38.890 
on wood like oak or pretty much anything

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:40.949 
on wood like oak or pretty much anything
I<00:03:39.159> tend<00:03:39.430> to<00:03:39.489> run<00:03:39.730> what<00:03:40.000> they<00:03:40.120> call<00:03:40.299> a<00:03:40.329> climb<00:03:40.659> cut

00:03:40.949 --> 00:03:40.959 
I tend to run what they call a climb cut

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:43.949 
I tend to run what they call a climb cut
your<00:03:41.890> direction<00:03:42.400> of<00:03:42.519> travel<00:03:42.760> should<00:03:43.120> be<00:03:43.329> this

00:03:43.949 --> 00:03:43.959 
your direction of travel should be this

00:03:43.959 --> 00:03:47.970 
your direction of travel should be this
way<00:03:44.459> along<00:03:45.459> a<00:03:45.519> cut<00:03:46.120> but<00:03:46.450> I<00:03:46.629> do<00:03:47.379> a<00:03:47.409> controlled

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:47.980 
way along a cut but I do a controlled

00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:50.520 
way along a cut but I do a controlled
cut<00:03:48.310> backwards<00:03:49.000> because<00:03:49.659> it<00:03:49.840> prevents<00:03:50.349> the

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:50.530 
cut backwards because it prevents the

00:03:50.530 --> 00:04:25.170 
cut backwards because it prevents the
splintering<00:03:51.069> in<00:03:51.310> Terao

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:25.180 

00:04:25.180 --> 00:04:30.960 

a<00:04:27.449> little<00:04:28.449> bit<00:04:28.570> of<00:04:28.690> sanding<00:04:29.370> you<00:04:30.370> have<00:04:30.550> a<00:04:30.639> very

00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:30.970 
a little bit of sanding you have a very

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:34.499 
a little bit of sanding you have a very
nice<00:04:31.210> dental<00:04:31.660> molding<00:04:32.669> you<00:04:33.669> hang<00:04:34.000> that<00:04:34.030> up<00:04:34.240> and

00:04:34.499 --> 00:04:34.509 
nice dental molding you hang that up and

00:04:34.509 --> 00:04:43.920 
nice dental molding you hang that up and
put<00:04:34.690> some<00:04:34.900> crown<00:04:35.139> molding<00:04:35.530> on<00:04:35.650> top<00:04:35.949> of<00:04:36.160> it<00:04:42.930> have

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:43.930 
put some crown molding on top of it have

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:47.580 
put some crown molding on top of it have
a<00:04:43.960> very<00:04:44.289> expensive-looking<00:04:44.919> molding
