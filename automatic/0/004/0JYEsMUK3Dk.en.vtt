00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:16.170 
Bernie Sanders is elected president is

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:18.590 
Bernie Sanders is elected president is
it<00:00:16.500> going<00:00:16.680> to<00:00:16.740> be<00:00:16.949> another<00:00:17.400> four<00:00:18.150> or<00:00:18.180> eight

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:18.600 
it going to be another four or eight

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:21.920 
it going to be another four or eight
years<00:00:18.630> of<00:00:19.410> a<00:00:19.980> do-nothing<00:00:20.490> Congress<00:00:21.330> I<00:00:21.539> think

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
years of a do-nothing Congress I think

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.810 
years of a do-nothing Congress I think
not<00:00:22.140> because<00:00:22.289> Bernie<00:00:22.680> knows<00:00:22.980> how<00:00:23.189> to<00:00:23.250> use<00:00:23.580> the

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
not because Bernie knows how to use the

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.939 
not because Bernie knows how to use the
podium<00:00:24.330> Bernie<00:00:24.689> Bernie<00:00:25.140> knows<00:00:25.410> how<00:00:25.560> to<00:00:25.619> fire

00:00:25.939 --> 00:00:25.949 
podium Bernie Bernie knows how to fire

00:00:25.949 --> 00:00:28.939 
podium Bernie Bernie knows how to fire
people<00:00:26.160> up<00:00:26.519> band<00:00:27.150> and<00:00:27.449> this<00:00:27.750> is<00:00:27.930> what<00:00:28.170> I<00:00:28.380> in<00:00:28.769> my

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:28.949 
people up band and this is what I in my

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:30.410 
people up band and this is what I in my
opinion<00:00:29.220> if<00:00:29.429> there's<00:00:29.609> a<00:00:29.670> failure<00:00:29.880> to<00:00:30.119> the

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420 
opinion if there's a failure to the

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:31.339 
opinion if there's a failure to the
first<00:00:30.630> four<00:00:30.869> years<00:00:31.019> of<00:00:31.140> the<00:00:31.320> Obama

00:00:31.339 --> 00:00:31.349 
first four years of the Obama

00:00:31.349 --> 00:00:33.530 
first four years of the Obama
administration<00:00:32.279> it<00:00:32.669> was<00:00:32.820> the<00:00:32.940> failure<00:00:33.180> of<00:00:33.300> the

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:33.540 
administration it was the failure of the

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:35.060 
administration it was the failure of the
president<00:00:34.020> to<00:00:34.110> use<00:00:34.290> the<00:00:34.440> bully<00:00:34.620> pulpit<00:00:35.010> that

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
president to use the bully pulpit that

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.590 
president to use the bully pulpit that
he<00:00:35.250> had<00:00:35.430> and<00:00:35.850> I<00:00:35.940> think<00:00:36.120> it's<00:00:36.210> cuz<00:00:36.390> he<00:00:36.510> was

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:36.600 
he had and I think it's cuz he was

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.330 
he had and I think it's cuz he was
relatively<00:00:37.079> new<00:00:37.320> to<00:00:37.440> politics<00:00:37.890> he<00:00:38.129> didn't

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:38.340 
relatively new to politics he didn't

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:39.920 
relatively new to politics he didn't
understand<00:00:38.760> how<00:00:38.879> this<00:00:38.969> town<00:00:39.180> works<00:00:39.239> and<00:00:39.750> and

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:39.930 
understand how this town works and and

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.450 
understand how this town works and and
also<00:00:40.230> he<00:00:40.590> had<00:00:40.739> a<00:00:40.770> whole<00:00:40.980> bunch<00:00:41.160> of<00:00:41.280> very

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
also he had a whole bunch of very

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.400 
also he had a whole bunch of very
cautious<00:00:41.940> old<00:00:42.210> Clinton<00:00:42.570> advisors<00:00:43.050> with<00:00:43.260> him

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
cautious old Clinton advisors with him

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.229 
cautious old Clinton advisors with him
and<00:00:43.590> so<00:00:44.040> they<00:00:44.190> and<00:00:44.370> they<00:00:44.520> were<00:00:44.579> looking<00:00:44.789> at<00:00:45.030> his

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
and so they and they were looking at his

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:46.639 
and so they and they were looking at his
reelection<00:00:45.690> and<00:00:46.050> so<00:00:46.170> they<00:00:46.260> were<00:00:46.320> saying<00:00:46.559> like

00:00:46.639 --> 00:00:46.649 
reelection and so they were saying like

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:48.529 
reelection and so they were saying like
don't<00:00:46.710> rock<00:00:47.160> the<00:00:47.190> boat<00:00:47.370> take<00:00:47.789> your<00:00:47.940> first<00:00:48.120> four

00:00:48.529 --> 00:00:48.539 
don't rock the boat take your first four

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.020 
don't rock the boat take your first four
years<00:00:48.750> take<00:00:49.050> it<00:00:49.170> slow<00:00:49.410> and<00:00:49.710> and<00:00:50.520> he<00:00:50.670> followed

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
years take it slow and and he followed

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:52.430 
years take it slow and and he followed
their<00:00:51.210> advice<00:00:51.329> and<00:00:51.570> I<00:00:51.960> think<00:00:52.199> it<00:00:52.289> was<00:00:52.379> a

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:52.440 
their advice and I think it was a

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.860 
their advice and I think it was a

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:54.870

think<00:01:15.450> that<00:01:15.600> Bernie<00:01:15.840> would<00:01:16.200> have<00:01:16.560> an

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:16.710 
think that Bernie would have an

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.710 
think that Bernie would have an
unsuccessful<00:01:17.100> presidents<00:01:17.880> if<00:01:18.000> he<00:01:18.180> had<00:01:18.600> the

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
unsuccessful presidents if he had the

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:20.270 
unsuccessful presidents if he had the
presidency<00:01:19.229> if<00:01:19.290> he<00:01:19.409> was<00:01:19.530> elected<00:01:19.890> I<00:01:20.009> think

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:20.280 
presidency if he was elected I think

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:22.370 
presidency if he was elected I think
that<00:01:20.430> you<00:01:20.700> know<00:01:20.759> there's<00:01:20.970> enough<00:01:21.380> populists

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:22.380 
that you know there's enough populists

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.170 
that you know there's enough populists
push<00:01:22.740> behind<00:01:22.979> him<00:01:23.280> is<00:01:23.460> the<00:01:23.670> same<00:01:23.880> thing<00:01:24.060> with

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180 
push behind him is the same thing with

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.550 
push behind him is the same thing with
the<00:01:24.210> first<00:01:24.479> year<00:01:24.689> you<00:01:24.990> need<00:01:25.170> to<00:01:25.229> study<00:01:25.409> the

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:25.560 
the first year you need to study the

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.980 
the first year you need to study the
first<00:01:25.770> year<00:01:25.950> the<00:01:26.070> FDR<00:01:26.340> presidency<00:01:27.060> and<00:01:27.600> and

00:01:29.749 --> 00:01:29.759 
the best lens to look at that through is

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:31.999 
the best lens to look at that through is
is<00:01:29.970> Frances<00:01:30.420> Perkins<00:01:30.630> though<00:01:31.500> the<00:01:31.740> woman<00:01:31.979> that
