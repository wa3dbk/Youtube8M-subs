00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:35.720
 i 

00:00:41.770 --> 00:00:47.449
 We are only here with Thiaguinho. 

00:00:44.719 --> 00:00:50.570
 Thiaguinho as that was the choice of the 

00:00:47.449 --> 00:00:52.730
 drift when what happened this 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:56.149
 rodrigo that was two years ago me 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:58.220
 I rode a motorcycle, I actually had a 

00:00:56.149 --> 00:01:00.260
 hilux and a pickup truck in the 

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:01.550
 motorcycle racing I played 

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:04.250
 with the car 

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:06.130
 I started to research released the movie the 

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:09.560
 two dangerous film and since then 

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:12.649
 I searched the flu team for training and 

00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:15.800
 I've been drifting for two years. 

00:01:12.649 --> 00:01:19.520
 and the choice of the car as that was 

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:21.800
 from 350 was the first car was the scoreboard 

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:24.259
 official drift was really the 

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.820
 sure that it will really make more 

00:01:24.259 --> 00:01:28.820
 by the lack of the imported car here in the 

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:31.310
 Brazil and the z has a lot of 300 is that Brazil 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:33.710
 and ps I think too much part of the car stops 

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:37.729
 shock since up since the motor encounter 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:40.009
 all international 340 hp first 

00:01:37.729 --> 00:01:42.110
 sucked, did not you do some adapting? 

00:01:40.009 --> 00:01:44.810
 walked the first one sucked and then 

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:47.450
 some adapts exactly the hair 

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:49.970
 inspired, and we did some 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.470
 upgrades in the own aspirated engine 

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:55.670
 get a little stronger 

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:59.690
 now I have a biturbo kit on the grid 

00:01:55.670 --> 00:02:01.729
 with two turbines wheel with 102 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:03.619
 added around 150 horses to 

00:02:01.729 --> 00:02:07.160
 more then the vacuum is around 

00:02:03.619 --> 00:02:09.860
 450 horses bituruna and one more car 

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:12.920
 entered the family but a choice 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:15.470
 difference and the difference between the two 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:18.620
 opposite sides there given in the 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:21.670
 exactly I can go pro japan costs 

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:21.670
 help the show team 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:26.500
 and was looking for another 380g but with 

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:29.800
 the right-hand drive because 

00:02:26.500 --> 00:02:31.030
 I needed a car to train and the 

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:33.160
 We could manage to find the car the way we did. 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:35.500
 I just wish it was not bi turbo 

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:37.360
 and super chardy night on the right side 

00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:40.930
 How did I say a little different from playing? 

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:43.030
 but if you get used to it and the car arrived well 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:45.520
 one month the car arrived was ready and 

00:02:43.030 --> 00:02:48.550
 the debut of the car is today the debut of 

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:49.390
 car that was the debut was nice of a 

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:53.050
 cool 

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:55.030
 I took a little hand from the car, not from 

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:56.410
 banana is cool, you have to take some 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:59.380
 hand because the handbrake and hook 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:03:00.790
 left touch a right wing but ok 

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:02.500
 Good. We'll give it a little more to 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:04.240
 too much to expect the car again 

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:07.660
 future projects plus cars for the 

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:10.720
 family, you own a team today. 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:12.490
 and is bringing more pilots 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:15.670
 are the future projects 

00:03:12.490 --> 00:03:18.760
 if today I have around 4 300 

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:21.010
 often all prepared for use 

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:23.380
 for the practice of drift does not yet have 

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:25.930
 Pilot team am I was given 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:29.560
 left to be able to follow his own 

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:32.590
 way and the idea in the future is to 

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:36.100
 one more pilot to be able to travel 

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:37.930
 to be able to do shows championships in case 

00:03:36.100 --> 00:03:42.480
 badly the other goes well has a structure 

00:03:37.930 --> 00:03:42.480
 cool and spread worldwide 

00:03:46.550 --> 00:03:48.730
 i 

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:11.450
 is
