00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:10.250
 It sounds like a book that Ron is good 

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:17.570
 And say what it 

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:18.170
 If it enters, how to make it make the viewpoint from 360 degrees concentrate on one play 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:24.710

 I was freaking out, but it wasn't 

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:33.900
 Especially this 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:34.820
 It's been a while since I've been hot and you've all come together and I think it's a couple 

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:39.500

 In place 's punishment be agreed in the extra for only 3 seconds 1 cut that there is a way 

00:00:48.530 --> 00:01:00.870
 Though I take a luxury setting by saying so I don't take a set with a set 

00:00:54.810 --> 00:01:06.240
 That's a good name, including how to use another industry cut 

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:08.010
 What does that mean? It's not a narrative in one 3 battles, but in short anything 

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:13.860
 While looking at 

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:14.830
 Naa and make the story of the sweet-chan says that doing N Dhara over looks quite impressive 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:19.990
 Uno is a town 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:23.320
 The debut work of my bindings and my fetish ones also have their imagination of the zeros already before that 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:24.110
 It was such a content that it was the strongest illusion museum for 10 years 

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:28.580
 so 

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:30.290
 I do not want to hits of this in even in Bama-chan Tei Tomino Mr. Ne if Brent or turn a 

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:35.510
 Spear wanted to be something I 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:36.110
 I also feel close to it, because it is Ama-chan, so something like Gundam 

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:40.970
 so 

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:44.100
 If Japan is a great peace in the world or if it is social peace, in the fictional history in the universe century 

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:47.280
 Great wars and exciting things among the great fans 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:52.590
 It's not like I 'm feeling bad, I 'm going to dive in the opposite way like the air 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:56.759
 Ueno flies into space and dives into reality from 2008 in the last few years 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:57.690

 Only Kitasanriku 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:13.989
 The scenery of Kitasanriku which I don't feel is used more and more, and it is said that tourists are actually there 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:15.940
 Selling reading to make something I do not know reality where if no effect until How to go

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:28.600
 Right ? 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:34.210
 Reality to think that something not that Toko of the mall one story kana do I'm not the kind you 

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:35.200
 It is because it has come out to Tokyo in admiration that it is also doing review after all while having a contact with 

00:02:34.210 --> 00:02:35.930
 I will 

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:40.459
 The work itself 

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:46.519
 Kedomo I was afraid or for might Well because I like to allow me Tokyo hate 

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:47.359
 As I thought of that made in the sense that say this or come of the subtlety or 5 ed market Toka ne 30 

00:02:46.519 --> 00:02:54.019
 manufacturing 

00:02:47.359 --> 00:02:55.950
 Tteyuu of it has any, Why It's pleasant So now have seen that now that in 14 Chapter 3 

00:02:54.019 --> 00:03:01.670
 From 13 minutes unexpectedly 

00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:06.470
 It's about to go in, sometimes it's about praising 

00:03:01.670 --> 00:03:12.500
 How to make 25 pieces There is information that says the information in profanity 

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:17.900
 And in doing it still be in the girl steam dew other customers and his friends and summer 

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:19.010
 The fact that you are doing what made it Miyamoto only of Gozaru you of that market talk show 

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:21.660
 In a lifetime Theory 

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:27.420

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:47.709
 I do not do this is the story of Gundam 

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:49.810
 I am inspired by something like Saa and I 'm not a companion , but making an animation here changes something 

00:03:47.709 --> 00:03:52.900
 Is that there? 

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:57.260

 Well not 

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:10.110
 For example, what kind of femininity between encounter rhythm and fiction is if you aim at your eyes 

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:14.670
 Is it montan? 

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:18.870
 Speaking of which this is like when I get bored , but after all I really can be either
