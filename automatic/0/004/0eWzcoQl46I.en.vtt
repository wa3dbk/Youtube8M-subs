lead<00:01:29.250> the<00:01:29.340> belt<00:01:29.550> or<00:01:29.670> something<00:01:29.790> a<00:01:30.030> little<00:01:30.060> bit

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:30.390 
lead the belt or something a little bit

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:39.560 
lead the belt or something a little bit
of<00:01:30.479> splash<00:01:30.630> of<00:01:30.840> color

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:39.570 

00:01:39.570 --> 00:01:41.570
