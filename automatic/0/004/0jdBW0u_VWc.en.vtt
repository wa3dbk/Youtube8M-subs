cheese<00:04:22.870> it'll<00:04:23.290> melt<00:04:23.920> much<00:04:24.310> faster<00:04:25.650> cheese<00:04:27.120> and

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:28.120 
cheese it'll melt much faster cheese and

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:29.760 
cheese it'll melt much faster cheese and
then<00:04:28.750> we<00:04:28.870> go<00:04:29.020> close<00:04:29.350> it

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:29.770 
then we go close it
