 on the road of the alsace balloon 

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:25.980
 in the village of their audience 

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.470
 the small private museum 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:31.619

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:37.309

00:00:37.309 --> 00:00:40.240
 shoemaker at the shoe museum 

00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:43.420
 he used duration in 2002 

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:45.630
 as to henry came because 

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:49.400
 my father was a shoemaker one with a single sewing machine and by others 

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:54.480
 machines no longer towers was done by hand and one day it was in 60 in 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:59.110
 what I had where he was implanted in the aee I was 50 years old 51 years old I got 

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:02.500
 said thin one day I can open a museum I will do it 

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.280
 I really had the ambition to drill steeplechase 

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.280
 and then that here 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.260
 the friends who helped me 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.510
 surrounded by greenhouses gendarmes 

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:16.680
 while the shelves all around absolutely everything 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.609
 the program of shoes and boots of exception 

00:01:19.609 --> 00:01:22.920
 back to novels to repair for the dr 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.680
 every shoe his story an example that luck 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:28.870
 luck but the lands 

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:30.610
 of the French army 

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:35.470
 the first were manufactured after the war of 1870 saladin 2005 93 

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.000
 so that I made myself in 68 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:45.560
 that's the shoes of German alpine hunters 

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.290
 who did what 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:49.790
 with his shoes there 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:52.790
 and that's the nail for germain 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:58.890
 this is the oldest dating from 1860 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.520
 this is a doorway to his success 

00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:05.970
 thanks to the German boot 

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:09.200
 German officers and all these fine fights have been done on 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:10.839
 measure why 

00:02:10.839 --> 00:02:13.379
 because of the calf 

00:02:13.379 --> 00:02:16.379
 henri matÃ©os silva 30 the banda 

00:02:17.929 --> 00:02:19.010
 the shoes 

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.479
 armand fell in when he was little 

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:24.479
 in the blues know that shoemakers all the Swiss roads 

00:02:25.179 --> 00:02:29.549
 it was who motivated him child was to discover how are made the 

00:02:29.549 --> 00:02:30.429
 shoes 

00:02:30.429 --> 00:02:34.599
 quite naturally he then embarked on the design and 

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:35.679
 manufacturing 

00:02:35.679 --> 00:02:38.679
 yes this room is heated to me 

00:02:41.129 --> 00:02:44.229
 There is something else 

00:02:44.229 --> 00:02:47.069
 because right after the war 

00:02:47.069 --> 00:02:48.819
 lack of turns 

00:02:48.819 --> 00:02:51.819
 and during the war ran out of time since yesterday 

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:55.059
 a month I manufactured started to manufacture 

00:02:55.059 --> 00:02:58.379
 shoes like this 

00:02:58.379 --> 00:03:01.379
 it had been done with the banks carrying potash mines 

00:03:01.919 --> 00:03:03.409

00:03:03.409 --> 00:03:04.899

00:03:04.899 --> 00:03:06.229
 it was cheap 

00:03:06.229 --> 00:03:08.289
 but we had to do it because the show 

00:03:08.289 --> 00:03:11.349
 it hurt a meter wide 7 10 meters long 

00:03:11.349 --> 00:03:13.749

00:03:13.749 --> 00:03:15.579
