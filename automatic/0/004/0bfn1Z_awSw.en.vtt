00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520

trouble<00:01:29.640> are<00:01:29.970> you<00:01:30.119> moving<00:01:30.479> forward<00:01:30.990> taking

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:31.740 
trouble are you moving forward taking

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:34.100 
trouble are you moving forward taking
away<00:01:32.190> time<00:01:32.220> because<00:01:33.149> I<00:01:33.270> think<00:01:33.540> it's<00:01:33.720> I<00:01:33.960> think

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
away time because I think it's I think

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:35.660 
away time because I think it's I think
tennis<00:01:34.649> is<00:01:34.770> about<00:01:34.920> two<00:01:35.100> things<00:01:35.369> and<00:01:35.520> that's

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
tennis is about two things and that's

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.389 
tennis is about two things and that's
mainly<00:01:35.910> about<00:01:36.209> taking<00:01:36.509> away<00:01:36.569> time<00:01:36.630> and

00:01:37.389 --> 00:01:37.399 
mainly about taking away time and

00:01:37.399 --> 00:01:39.859 
mainly about taking away time and
creating<00:01:38.399> better<00:01:38.670> and<00:01:39.000> better<00:01:39.179> positioning

00:01:39.859 --> 00:01:39.869 
creating better and better positioning

00:01:39.869 --> 00:01:42.740 
creating better and better positioning
now<00:01:40.670> you<00:01:41.670> could<00:01:41.819> take<00:01:41.970> away<00:01:42.209> time<00:01:42.450> by<00:01:42.690> doing

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
now you could take away time by doing

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.540 
now you could take away time by doing
different<00:01:43.440> things<00:01:43.470> I<00:01:43.800> talked<00:01:44.160> about<00:01:44.250> one

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:44.550 
different things I talked about one

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:46.160 
different things I talked about one
moving<00:01:44.850> up<00:01:45.119> and<00:01:45.330> back<00:01:45.479> you<00:01:45.630> can<00:01:45.780> also<00:01:45.899> take

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
moving up and back you can also take

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:49.010 
moving up and back you can also take
away<00:01:46.259> time<00:01:46.530> by<00:01:47.160> hitting<00:01:47.610> the<00:01:47.819> ball<00:01:47.940> harder<00:01:48.390> you

00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:49.020 
away time by hitting the ball harder you

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:51.169 
away time by hitting the ball harder you
can<00:01:49.229> gain<00:01:49.560> time<00:01:50.009> by<00:01:50.520> hitting<00:01:50.729> the<00:01:50.910> ball<00:01:51.060> with

00:01:51.169 --> 00:01:51.179 
can gain time by hitting the ball with

00:01:51.179 --> 00:01:53.809 
can gain time by hitting the ball with
more<00:01:51.360> spin<00:01:51.780> topspin<00:01:52.590> or<00:01:52.800> under<00:01:53.399> spin<00:01:53.640> I

00:01:53.809 --> 00:01:53.819 
more spin topspin or under spin I

00:01:53.819 --> 00:01:54.859 
more spin topspin or under spin I
understand<00:01:54.300> I'll<00:01:54.420> give<00:01:54.539> you<00:01:54.600> a<00:01:54.660> little<00:01:54.750> bit

00:01:54.859 --> 00:01:54.869 
understand I'll give you a little bit

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.050 
understand I'll give you a little bit
more<00:01:55.050> time<00:01:55.289> than<00:01:55.470> topspin<00:01:55.920> the<00:01:56.160> second<00:01:56.910> thing

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
more time than topspin the second thing

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:59.330 
more time than topspin the second thing
you're<00:01:57.149> looking<00:01:57.270> for<00:01:57.420> is<00:01:57.600> positioning<00:01:58.410> I<00:01:58.560> see

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.340 
you're looking for is positioning I see

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:00.710 
you're looking for is positioning I see
so<00:01:59.580> many<00:01:59.759> players<00:02:00.030> and<00:02:00.330> they're<00:02:00.450> working<00:02:00.690> so

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:00.720 
so many players and they're working so

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.380 
so many players and they're working so
hard<00:02:01.170> to<00:02:01.380> trying<00:02:01.590> to<00:02:01.649> hit<00:02:02.130> a<00:02:02.160> huge<00:02:02.729> forehand

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:03.390 
hard to trying to hit a huge forehand

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:05.150 
hard to trying to hit a huge forehand
but<00:02:03.720> they're<00:02:03.869> ten<00:02:04.110> feet<00:02:04.380> behind<00:02:04.619> the<00:02:04.800> baseline

00:02:05.150 --> 00:02:05.160 
but they're ten feet behind the baseline

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:07.699 
but they're ten feet behind the baseline
so<00:02:05.849> in<00:02:06.030> a<00:02:06.119> sense<00:02:06.360> if<00:02:06.599> you<00:02:07.020> think<00:02:07.050> about<00:02:07.349> it

00:02:07.699 --> 00:02:07.709 
so in a sense if you think about it

00:02:07.709 --> 00:02:09.469 
so in a sense if you think about it
hitting<00:02:08.130> the<00:02:08.220> ball<00:02:08.340> harder<00:02:08.940> with<00:02:09.090> more<00:02:09.240> power

00:02:09.469 --> 00:02:09.479 
hitting the ball harder with more power

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.990 
hitting the ball harder with more power
is<00:02:09.720> taking<00:02:10.020> way<00:02:10.229> time<00:02:10.530> but<00:02:11.130> their<00:02:11.310> positioning

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
is taking way time but their positioning

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.210 
is taking way time but their positioning
is<00:02:12.120> actually<00:02:12.480> giving<00:02:13.170> their<00:02:13.680> opponent<00:02:14.040> time

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:14.220 
is actually giving their opponent time

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:16.070 
is actually giving their opponent time
which<00:02:14.610> neutralizes<00:02:15.180> what<00:02:15.720> they're<00:02:15.840> trying<00:02:16.050> to

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.080 
which neutralizes what they're trying to

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:17.930 
which neutralizes what they're trying to
do<00:02:16.260> and<00:02:16.530> I<00:02:17.130> think<00:02:17.340> a<00:02:17.370> lot<00:02:17.520> of<00:02:17.550> people<00:02:17.819> don't

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:17.940 
do and I think a lot of people don't

00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:19.430 
do and I think a lot of people don't
understand<00:02:18.360> this<00:02:18.480> they're<00:02:18.870> standing<00:02:19.140> further

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:19.440 
understand this they're standing further

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.260 
understand this they're standing further
back<00:02:19.709> hitting<00:02:19.950> the<00:02:20.099> ball<00:02:20.220> bigger<00:02:20.490> and<00:02:20.760> not

00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:21.270 
back hitting the ball bigger and not

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:22.970 
back hitting the ball bigger and not
seeing<00:02:21.630> any<00:02:21.780> gains<00:02:22.230> and<00:02:22.560> what<00:02:22.650> they're<00:02:22.770> trying

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
seeing any gains and what they're trying

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:25.220 
seeing any gains and what they're trying
to<00:02:23.010> do<00:02:23.190> because<00:02:23.670> you're<00:02:24.209> neutralizing<00:02:24.990> it<00:02:25.080> by

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.230 
to do because you're neutralizing it by

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:27.920 
to do because you're neutralizing it by
standing<00:02:25.590> that<00:02:25.770> far<00:02:26.190> back<00:02:26.490> in<00:02:26.819> the<00:02:27.300> behind<00:02:27.870> the

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:27.930 
standing that far back in the behind the

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:30.470 
standing that far back in the behind the
baseline<00:02:28.260> so<00:02:29.190> as<00:02:29.400> you<00:02:29.640> watch<00:02:29.849> this<00:02:30.090> year's

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:30.480 
baseline so as you watch this year's

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:32.000 
baseline so as you watch this year's
Grand<00:02:30.780> Slam<00:02:31.050> I<00:02:31.230> want<00:02:31.440> you<00:02:31.530> to<00:02:31.590> look<00:02:31.680> for<00:02:31.739> two

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
Grand Slam I want you to look for two

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.330 
Grand Slam I want you to look for two
things<00:02:32.280> two<00:02:32.819> things<00:02:33.060> how<00:02:33.709> better<00:02:34.709> players<00:02:35.099> are

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340 
things two things how better players are

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.130 
things two things how better players are
taking<00:02:35.730> away<00:02:35.790> time<00:02:36.150> by<00:02:36.630> either<00:02:36.660> taking<00:02:36.930> the

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:37.140 
taking away time by either taking the

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.110 
taking away time by either taking the
ball<00:02:37.260> earlier<00:02:37.709> on<00:02:37.920> the<00:02:38.130> rise<00:02:38.280> they<00:02:38.819> might<00:02:39.000> take

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:39.120 
ball earlier on the rise they might take

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.270 
ball earlier on the rise they might take
it<00:02:39.180> out<00:02:39.450> of<00:02:39.480> the<00:02:39.690> air<00:02:39.810> a<00:02:40.080> great<00:02:40.650> way<00:02:40.830> of<00:02:40.860> taking

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:41.280 
it out of the air a great way of taking

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:42.920 
it out of the air a great way of taking
away<00:02:41.370> time<00:02:41.640> on<00:02:41.790> grass<00:02:42.000> is<00:02:42.270> serving<00:02:42.780> and

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:42.930 
away time on grass is serving and

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:43.340 
away time on grass is serving and
volleying

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
volleying

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:44.780 
volleying
or<00:02:43.680> your

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:44.790 
or your

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:46.190 
or your
see<00:02:44.969> them<00:02:45.150> having<00:02:45.420> better<00:02:45.599> positioning

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:46.200 
see them having better positioning

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.569 
see them having better positioning
they're<00:02:46.349> playing<00:02:46.560> closer<00:02:46.890> to<00:02:47.099> the<00:02:47.189> baseline

00:02:47.569 --> 00:02:47.579 
they're playing closer to the baseline

00:02:47.579 --> 00:02:49.280 
they're playing closer to the baseline
this<00:02:47.730> is<00:02:47.909> a<00:02:47.939> thing<00:02:48.599> that<00:02:48.629> I<00:02:48.780> saw<00:02:48.930> on<00:02:48.989> the<00:02:49.109> doll

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
this is a thing that I saw on the doll

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:52.550 
this is a thing that I saw on the doll
do<00:02:49.500> a<00:02:49.530> couple<00:02:49.859> years<00:02:50.040> back<00:02:50.219> when<00:02:51.560> people

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
do a couple years back when people

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:53.959 
do a couple years back when people
didn't<00:02:52.739> think<00:02:52.769> he<00:02:52.980> would<00:02:53.129> win<00:02:53.250> on<00:02:53.400> grass

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:53.969 
didn't think he would win on grass

00:02:53.969 --> 00:02:56.119 
didn't think he would win on grass
he<00:02:54.329> learned<00:02:54.629> to<00:02:54.780> take<00:02:55.109> away<00:02:55.319> time<00:02:55.590> by<00:02:55.829> standing

00:02:56.119 --> 00:02:56.129 
he learned to take away time by standing

00:02:56.129 --> 00:02:58.940 
he learned to take away time by standing
closer<00:02:56.519> to<00:02:56.819> the<00:02:56.939> baseline<00:02:57.390> and<00:02:57.599> by<00:02:58.500> doing<00:02:58.799> that

00:02:58.940 --> 00:02:58.950 
closer to the baseline and by doing that

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:01.309 
closer to the baseline and by doing that
his<00:02:59.519> ball<00:02:59.819> became<00:03:00.150> more<00:03:00.450> effective<00:03:00.840> without

00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:01.319 
his ball became more effective without

00:03:01.319 --> 00:03:04.250 
his ball became more effective without
having<00:03:01.590> to<00:03:01.650> do<00:03:01.739> anything<00:03:01.980> else<00:03:02.250> now<00:03:02.909> as<00:03:03.269> you're

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:04.260 
having to do anything else now as you're

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:05.809 
having to do anything else now as you're
watching<00:03:04.439> it<00:03:04.769> I<00:03:04.920> want<00:03:05.250> you<00:03:05.370> to<00:03:05.459> think<00:03:05.579> about

00:03:05.809 --> 00:03:05.819 
watching it I want you to think about

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:07.429 
watching it I want you to think about
what<00:03:06.060> are<00:03:06.150> some<00:03:06.299> ways<00:03:06.420> you<00:03:06.480> can<00:03:06.870> take<00:03:07.200> away

00:03:07.429 --> 00:03:07.439 
what are some ways you can take away

00:03:07.439 --> 00:03:08.960 
what are some ways you can take away
time<00:03:07.620> in<00:03:07.769> your<00:03:07.829> next<00:03:08.010> match<00:03:08.189> whether<00:03:08.819> that

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:08.970 
time in your next match whether that

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:10.339 
time in your next match whether that
means<00:03:09.150> standing<00:03:09.359> a<00:03:09.569> little<00:03:09.780> bit<00:03:09.870> closer<00:03:10.140> to

00:03:10.339 --> 00:03:10.349 
means standing a little bit closer to

00:03:10.349 --> 00:03:12.589 
means standing a little bit closer to
the<00:03:10.470> baseline<00:03:10.889> maybe<00:03:11.670> standing<00:03:12.090> your<00:03:12.239> normal

00:03:12.589 --> 00:03:12.599 
the baseline maybe standing your normal

00:03:12.599 --> 00:03:13.940 
the baseline maybe standing your normal
position<00:03:12.689> on<00:03:13.049> the<00:03:13.170> baseline<00:03:13.530> but<00:03:13.709> when<00:03:13.829> your

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:13.950 
position on the baseline but when your

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:15.020
