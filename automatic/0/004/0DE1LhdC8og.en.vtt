00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.840
 without a doubt the label natural park is 

00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:05.790
 a quality mark for the territory 

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:07.919
 a recognition that also pursues 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:09.179
 the extensive livestock farming in alcalá de 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:11.250
 ebro a producer has launched 

00:00:09.179 --> 00:00:12.660
 a free-range chicken farm that 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:14.639
 distinguishes from industrial ones because 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.900
 they go out every day to graze a 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:17.910
 animal welfare that influences 

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:20.210
 positively in the final quality of 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:20.210
 eggs 

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:28.540
 traditional livestock leads to the 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:30.430
 table the flavors of the field under this 

00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:32.020
 philosophy 'josé miguel' has decided 

00:00:30.430 --> 00:00:34.660
 create a chickens farm 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:36.310
 camperas en alcalá de ebro a type of 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:38.140
 production in which welfare 

00:00:36.310 --> 00:00:40.680
 of the animals to get eggs from 

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:40.680
 high quality 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:44.960
 food that arrives without intermediaries 

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:47.060
 even consumers who appreciate the 

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:50.860
 texture of a protein-rich product 

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:50.860
 and that keeps the flavor of always 

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:01.990
 the egg farm tejero has 

00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:04.860
 8000 square meters where each day 

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:07.450
 walk the 830 chickens of josé-miguel 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:09.190
 that difference with farms with 

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:12.570
 industrial productions where no 

00:01:09.190 --> 00:01:12.570
 they have freedom of movement 

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:19.070
 until here they arrive with 18 weeks of life 

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:21.140
 as veterinarian jesus has supervised 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:23.659
 the first days of these birds in the 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:25.399
 exploitation is in those moments when 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:28.080
 the farmer has to accustom the 

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:29.910
 the plot where they will live 

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.520
 the hens are pretty easy to 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:36.270
 take from the point of view 

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:38.070
 veterinarian have much more care 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:39.450
 especially in the breeding phase until 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:41.160
 that start production in the 

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.740
 first days have to be inside 

00:01:41.160 --> 00:01:46.230
 know the environment they know 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.120
 they find their drinking troughs and 

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:51.330
 especially the nest boxes that is where they go 

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:52.890
 where are they going to put them to find that 

00:01:51.330 --> 00:01:55.260
 find it, find them comfortable 

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.630
 comfortable and when they have 

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:59.580
 started putting the genes 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:02.030
 localized is when they already begin to 

00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:02.030
 be outside 

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:07.070
 of breed is a brown these laying birds 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:09.470
 are the ideal ones for the production of 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:11.330
 eggs the free range hens 

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:13.670
 characterized by having a few cycles of 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:15.800
 natural putting something that gets 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:17.900
 leaving them free to eat and drink 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:20.360
 rest when they want 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:22.579
 in this way they metabolize better 

00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:24.739
 feed based on cereals and grass 

00:02:22.579 --> 00:02:26.629
 from which a natural diet is fed 

00:02:24.739 --> 00:02:28.310
 that affects the taste and quality of 

00:02:26.629 --> 00:02:30.630
 the eggs that every day josé-miguel 

00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:32.520
 picks up with care 

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:33.990
 we proceed to the collection of eggs that 

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:37.410
 It is usually done after eleven and 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:38.820
 mean in the morning is a collection of the 

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:41.600
 particularity is that the manual equipment 

00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:41.600
 it's all stressed 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:47.840
 and right now we are picking 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:50.049
 around 750 eggs that is a 90 91 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.560
 production is a pretty production 

00:02:50.049 --> 00:02:54.959
 Excellent 

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:57.599
 every day they leave this ship of 120 

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:59.610
 square meters an average of 63 dozen 

00:02:57.599 --> 00:03:03.300
 that are deposited in packages of 30 

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:05.580
 units since it launched the 

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:07.349
 project josé-miguel bet on the sale 

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:08.970
 direct on the same farm where 

00:03:07.349 --> 00:03:13.590
 conditioning a store open to 

00:03:08.970 --> 00:03:15.660
 public maría luisa is a neighbor of pedrola 

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:18.420
 and up to here goes assiduously to buy 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:20.400
 a product freshly picked and fresh one 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:22.110
 Proximity relationship between rancher and 

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:25.410
 consumer that is a guarantee of 

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:28.470
 trust that of knowing what you eat and 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:31.380
 where do you eat it that gives total because 

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:33.989
 many times you ate a good egg is 

00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:36.060
 that did not know egg is that apart from 

00:03:33.989 --> 00:03:38.430
 that is more or less cool is that the 

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:40.620
 flavor this has it from ya I tell you about 

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:42.780
 when you ate the eggs that our 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:45.060
 parents had the chickens in the corral 

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:46.970
 that's the feeling that I have so 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:48.910
 except the one that I have 

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:50.800
 ah 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:52.870
 After serving customers sales 

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:54.160
 direct 'josé miguel' moves the rest 

00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:57.100
 from the eggs to the sorting plant 

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:59.110
 to be packed here goes 

00:03:57.100 --> 00:04:00.880
 depositing on a line through the 

00:03:59.110 --> 00:04:04.330
 which discards those that are damaged or 

00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:06.580
 dirty with the help of artificial light 

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:09.460
 then this machine is responsible 

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:10.780
 dividing them by one weight and size 

00:04:09.460 --> 00:04:12.310
 once collected the egg a scale what 

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:14.260
 we have the classification center for 

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:17.049
 Packaging process where the egg passes 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:19.120
 for a camera of mirage and then it goes 

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:22.060
 classified by weight for the injuries that 

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:26.080
 we have here because the size egg 

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:28.480
 with a weight of 63 to 73 grams and eggs 

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:31.320
 that we have here of size m with a weight 

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:33.480
 from 53 to 63 grams 

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:35.710
 is usually the type of egg that 

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:37.660
 they take the chair 

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:39.310
 eggs that are already prepared for 

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:41.200
 pack by dozens with your stamp 

00:04:39.310 --> 00:04:43.720
 corresponding and its date of consumption 

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:45.880
 preferred 28 days after putting 

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:47.560
 José Carlos is president of the 

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:49.990
 professional association of agriculture 

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:51.910
 alternative an organization that bets 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:53.380
 by non-intensive production systems 

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:55.840
 and by short circuits of 

00:04:53.380 --> 00:04:57.580
 marketing a business model 

00:04:55.840 --> 00:04:59.830
 than in other countries like germany or 

00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:02.650
 Denmark is common and involves a 

00:04:59.830 --> 00:05:04.330
 change in consumer mentality that 

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:06.550
 come to buy here to case of 

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:08.050
 josé-miguel, he needs a motivation 

00:05:06.550 --> 00:05:09.970
 special to make that effort of 

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:11.230
 come to buy it or go find it at that 

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:13.210
 small store where it is available 

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:16.810
 but they are usually consumers who 

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:19.030
 they ask a little bit beyond what the 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:21.100
 common consumer no more usual and 

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:22.900
 majority wonder how it will be 

00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:24.670
 produced where does how are the 

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:26.200
 chickens wonders welfare 

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:28.000
 animal wonders about the environment 

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:31.380
 but the truth is that every time there is more 

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.380
 people interested in these issues 

00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:35.470
 something that 'josé miguel' appreciate their 

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:37.840
 clients of the high bank and zaragoza 

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:39.940
 eggs tejero commercializes in a way 

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:41.980
 direct on farm or directly to 

00:05:39.940 --> 00:05:43.590
 domicile 90 percent of your 

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:45.900
 production 

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:47.760
 a protein- rich food that arrives 

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:49.860
 fresh from the field to the table with hardly 

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:52.400
 intermediaries and with all the flavor that 

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:54.650
 bring the free-range chickens 

00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:56.810
 a traditional form of livestock in the 

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:59.660
 that in Aragon at the moment there are only 

00:05:56.810 --> 00:06:01.430
 two holdings initiatives that 

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:03.699
 recover the essence of the ancients 

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:03.699
 corrals
