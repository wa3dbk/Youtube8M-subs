looking<00:01:25.049> at<00:01:25.140> the<00:01:25.229> wrong<00:01:25.380> thing<00:01:25.619> my<00:01:26.009> bad<00:01:26.220> the

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210 
looking at the wrong thing my bad the

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.240 
looking at the wrong thing my bad the
first<00:01:27.479> ability<00:01:27.720> is<00:01:28.110> Zanda<00:01:28.500> movement<00:01:28.890> causing

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
first ability is Zanda movement causing

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.190 
first ability is Zanda movement causing
damage<00:01:29.579> with<00:01:29.759> this<00:01:29.790> weapon<00:01:30.119> increases<00:01:30.810> its

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
damage with this weapon increases its

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.219 
damage with this weapon increases its
stability<00:01:31.590> so<00:01:32.250> the<00:01:33.210> more<00:01:33.420> damage<00:01:33.720> you'll<00:01:34.079> do

00:01:34.219 --> 00:01:34.229 
stability so the more damage you'll do

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:36.109 
stability so the more damage you'll do
into<00:01:34.530> a<00:01:34.590> person<00:01:35.070> the<00:01:35.159> more<00:01:35.280> stable<00:01:35.579> your<00:01:35.909> gun

00:01:51.319 --> 00:01:51.329 
upgrading damage the next ability is

00:01:51.329 --> 00:01:53.840 
upgrading damage the next ability is
lightweight<00:01:52.220> everyone<00:01:53.220> knows<00:01:53.340> what<00:01:53.520> that<00:01:53.579> is

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
lightweight everyone knows what that is

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.270 
lightweight everyone knows what that is
well<00:01:54.420> should<00:01:54.930> know<00:01:55.049> what<00:01:55.259> that<00:01:55.439> is<00:01:55.740> by<00:01:56.070> now<00:01:56.219> you

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:07.330 
so you'll be able to move a little bit
faster<00:02:02.670> around<00:02:03.420> the<00:02:03.869> map<00:02:04.610> and<00:02:05.869> flared<00:02:06.869> magwell

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:07.340 
faster around the map and flared magwell

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.969 
faster around the map and flared magwell
reload<00:02:08.340> this<00:02:08.640> weapon<00:02:09.090> even<00:02:09.300> faster<00:02:10.050> so<00:02:10.440> that's

00:02:10.969 --> 00:02:10.979 
reload this weapon even faster so that's

00:02:10.979 --> 00:02:12.870 
reload this weapon even faster so that's
basically<00:02:11.220> that

00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:12.880 
basically that

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:16.530 
basically that

handling<00:02:24.370> so<00:02:25.360> basically<00:02:26.080> what<00:02:26.350> this<00:02:26.530> does<00:02:26.770> is

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:26.950 
handling so basically what this does is

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.460 
handling so basically what this does is
like<00:02:27.130> if<00:02:27.340> you're<00:02:27.550> if<00:02:27.880> you<00:02:28.240> do<00:02:28.450> like<00:02:28.690> hit<00:02:29.260> some

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:29.470 
like if you're if you do like hit some

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:30.660 
like if you're if you do like hit some
shots<00:02:29.500> on<00:02:29.920> the<00:02:30.010> floor<00:02:30.310> they're<00:02:30.460> going<00:02:30.610> to

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:30.670 
shots on the floor they're going to

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:34.110 
shots on the floor they're going to
rekha<00:02:30.880> see<00:02:31.210> and<00:02:32.550> possibly<00:02:33.550> hit<00:02:33.820> your<00:02:34.000> opponent

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:34.120 
rekha see and possibly hit your opponent

00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:41.690 
rekha see and possibly hit your opponent
and<00:02:35.730> I<00:02:38.310> think<00:02:39.310> I<00:02:39.520> you<00:02:39.580> do<00:02:40.000> get<00:02:40.270> them<00:02:40.590> right

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:41.700 
and I think I you do get them right

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:45.080 
and I think I you do get them right

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:49.680 
groans back in your magazine
occasionally<00:02:46.090> and<00:02:46.920> I<00:02:48.240> think<00:02:49.240> when<00:02:49.390> you<00:02:49.480> do

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:49.690 
occasionally and I think when you do

00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:51.840 
occasionally and I think when you do
shoot<00:02:50.020> them<00:02:50.170> it<00:02:50.470> slows<00:02:50.890> down<00:02:50.920> there<00:02:51.430> what<00:02:51.610> the

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:51.850 
shoot them it slows down there what the

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:55.590 
shoot them it slows down there what the
the<00:02:52.390> enemy's<00:02:52.720> weapon<00:02:53.140> handling<00:02:53.890> so<00:02:54.310> on<00:02:54.520> Utz<00:02:55.150> on

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:55.600 
the enemy's weapon handling so on Utz on

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:59.310 
the enemy's weapon handling so on Utz on
okay<00:02:55.960> pick<00:02:57.150> it's<00:02:58.150> not<00:02:58.270> my<00:02:58.420> favorite<00:02:58.930> but<00:02:58.960> it's
