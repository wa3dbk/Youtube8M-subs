00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.440
 and he is hello everybody 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:08.250
 by force and on account of our day super 

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.900
 the project 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.059
 I really hope that you have not bothered me yet 

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:14.190
 because every day Iâ€™m sure 

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:16.230
 a marathon is not for the faint of heart very 

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:18.090
 great if you go through all these days 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.470
 by me because it is expensive for 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.720
 such a short time 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.730
 see yourself in such bright different 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.430
 images of such different roles 

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.230
 it reveals us some lurking 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.029
 feelings you are no longer afraid to try 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:32.759
 but now I know exactly what I mean. 

00:00:30.029 --> 00:00:34.980
 assistant when I do not want and you know it too 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:36.870
 yes it is important today we are with you 

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:38.940
 try to repeat the image of the beautiful 

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:40.829
 platinum blonde lara stone 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.870
 she could not of course not attract to her 

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:45.030
 attention and focused on 

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:46.320
 her eyes true she used black 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:48.360
 colors in your makeup 

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:50.309
 i made him more everyday more 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.989
 subdued and more suitable under my 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.390
 eye color I really hope that you 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.890
 enjoy this video and let's try 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.930
 All this is repeated Well, as always 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:00:59.670
 starting with foundation today 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:02.039
 our beauty again the main focus 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.930
 accounted for the rest of her eyes 

00:01:02.039 --> 00:01:06.180
 very neutral pastel makeup 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.670
 lip color matt perfect tone and 

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.140
 small face correction to achieve 

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:11.100
 the same result we will 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.650
 use specially designed 

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.520
 for this foundation he is called 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:17.070
 infaillible 

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.570
 and begin to apply on the whole face after 

00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:20.369
 of how we did it we need 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.920
 block with you locally some 

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:24.390
 disadvantages are reddening after acne all 

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:26.070
 that we failed to disguise with 

00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:27.270
 using foundation I will 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:30.030
 use today 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.130
 corrector alliance perfect I put it on 

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:34.590
 all redness leave a little 

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:36.990
 dry out and when shading I'll 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:39.930
 try to focus on the zone 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:42.030
 around the redness to leave more 

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:43.619
 pigment in the very center then if 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:46.259
 proofreader somewhere was not shaded to 

00:01:43.619 --> 00:01:48.689
 At the end we will all block it a little 

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:50.880
 powder but we get the perfect tone 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:53.430
 then we need to brighten the area under 

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:56.640
 With my eyes I want to mix for this today 

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:58.380
 two concealer proofreaders one of them 

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.570
 which we used on the face only in 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:02.700
 lighter shade a second 

00:02:00.570 --> 00:02:04.469
 and this highlighter is called lime 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.509
 can we get more dense 

00:02:04.469 --> 00:02:08.740
 dark circles disguise dedicate this 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:10.300
 zone to align some 

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:12.220
 evenness on the face if there are any 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:14.320
 bags under the eyes for example I'm right on 

00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:16.120
 I put a hand on the corrector and then I mix 

00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:18.160
 doing it with the second one and this again for 

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:19.960
 that our areas under the eyes were in 

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:21.790
 perfect condition as such 

00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:23.580
 intense eye makeup will highlight 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:26.380
 absolutely all the flaws on the face 

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:28.480
 now we go face correction i will 

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:30.370
 use for this matte about on the shadow 

00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:32.560
 how do i do it usually they are in my 100 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:35.020
 sixth shades begin to allocate cheekbones 

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:37.540
 there I spend a clearer intense 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:39.640
 line and that's when I update my face and 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:41.740
 I turn to the temporal zone, I immediately 

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:44.140
 I try to put our say so bar 

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:45.730
 hunter more carefully and immediately 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:47.230
 shade because on this zone 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:50.800
 very likely that 

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:53.230
 bronzer will be visible then we have a little bit 

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:55.360
 take a chin and go to 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:57.220
 blush we hardly need blush on 

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:58.480
 face just put down a couple of accents i 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:00.400
 for this I will use very 

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:03.160
 light gentle tone rouge 

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.820
 I put them in my stock 

00:03:03.160 --> 00:03:06.190
 usually 

00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:07.810
 areas that are under our brows 

00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:10.180
 on the serving bone 

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:12.730
 so I manage to achieve more 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:14.500
 natural blush and if I put on so 

00:03:12.730 --> 00:03:17.020
 as make-up artist advised she is still a point 

00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:20.020
 that's where we have the bulging apple itself 

00:03:17.020 --> 00:03:22.210
 I get somehow not very well 

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:23.740
 now we need to fix all this i 

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:25.810
 I will do with the help powder alliance 

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:28.000
 I will make a perfect powder 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:28.570
 with a brush and I will wet my face a little 

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.940
 by water 

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:33.430
 so our foundation and the whole 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:35.920
 our makeup is better placed on the face and 

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:37.360
 hold on all day we are naturally not 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:39.160
 need an option after a rain on Thursday 

00:03:37.360 --> 00:03:41.950
 so keep the spray bottle on 

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:43.900
 arm distance and try 

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:45.790
 how to get into this sprayed clouds 

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:48.190
 waters so let's now move on to 

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:50.770
 brow I will use brow pencil 

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:52.510
 tests it is always in my shade of the form 

00:03:50.770 --> 00:03:54.970
 draw eyebrow in the direction of growth 

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:59.410
 hairs that is at the bottom of the bottom up 

00:03:54.970 --> 00:04:02.800
 and then as if seeing a pencil to the temple 

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:04.170
 so we do inside a circuit i usually 

00:04:02.800 --> 00:04:07.270
 already build 

00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:10.600
 a clear line then we comb the brow 

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:12.430
 and repeat the same thing with the other now I 

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:14.700
 a little wet the comb in which we 

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:16.950
 is on the back of a pencil 

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:21.030
 I will put on her powder 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:24.120
 shake and comb this way 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:26.580
 that we smooth the contour of the eyebrow and create another 

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:28.650
 more realistic result now 

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:31.110
 go to eye makeup first thing we 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:34.260
 we will use a pencil color rsh 

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:36.360
 and a series of likon and he is in my 100 second 

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:38.460
 shades we will frame the outline of the eye 

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:40.800
 and make out mucous with this 

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:42.050
 pencil with dark eyes you me already 

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:44.730
 have seen and we have already experimented 

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:46.500
 Much as I have bright eyes 

00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:49.050
 I want to try to do everything the same 

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:50.820
 only dense brown matte 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:53.130
 shades and it seemed to me that such 

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:55.140
 makeup option may be someone will 

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:56.970
 more interesting outline which we have 

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:59.100
 formed on the upper eyelid now not 

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:00.960
 makes absolutely no difference because 

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:02.970
 that we will very much shade 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:05.340
 impose there other shades 

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:07.260
 so you can safely hold the curve 

00:05:05.340 --> 00:05:09.120
 line and not worry about it 

00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:11.040
 I bring the line to the inner corner of the eye 

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:14.040
 now the base for our today's 

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:16.320
 make-up ready i will take a square not in 

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:19.860
 shade of e4 and we will use 

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:22.290
 matte brown shade and start 

00:05:19.860 --> 00:05:24.210
 put on all ages shadows in fact 

00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:26.520
 very well pigmented therefore 

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:28.580
 here we will immediately try to draw 

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:31.229
 some more or less clear lines 

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:33.450
 then of course we blend a little bit 

00:05:31.229 --> 00:05:35.490
 then put the shadow on the second eye we 

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:38.300
 go down below and start drawing 

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:41.190
 like an arrow with the same shadows under 

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:43.860
 eye now we need to pull this 

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:46.680
 shade a little to the side and we like 

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:48.120
 continue the line under the eye and bring it up 

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:50.490
 up arrow 

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:52.220
 I would add a little more intensity 

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:55.380
 eye so i will use 

00:05:52.220 --> 00:05:57.930
 superliner smoke &amp; simo brown 

00:05:55.380 --> 00:06:01.260
 shade and start to draw as if 

00:05:57.930 --> 00:06:02.750
 such an arrow with the same shade I will hold 

00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:05.970
 line down 

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:08.610
 lumbar contour pulling the arrow 

00:06:05.970 --> 00:06:11.400
 up well and work well well 

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:12.270
 century this liner slightly raise 

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:15.060
 here is a corner 

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:17.070
 to get more symmetrical makeup 

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:19.680
 I think this makeup is not enough 

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:22.919
 a little golden overheating and i will take 

00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:25.650
 shadow in shade 500 add this shade 

00:06:22.919 --> 00:06:27.900
 in the corners of the eyes it is true then it is all necessary 

00:06:25.650 --> 00:06:29.220
 will shade but what's left 

00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:31.919
 emphasize all this beauty with 

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:33.480
 eye mascara i will use mascara and 

00:06:31.919 --> 00:06:35.850
 false eyelashes wings 

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:37.140
 butterflies called intenza I tell you 

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:39.270
 I have already told about her 

00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:42.990
 teardrop brush due to which 

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:44.550
 You can well lift the corners of the eyes, too 

00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:46.380
 by the way due to its silicone 

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:49.710
 tassels are excellent and shared 

00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:52.320
 cilia and they will not be his glued 

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:53.280
 so you can safely put it in 

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:55.890
 several layers 

00:06:53.280 --> 00:06:57.690
 but the hardest part is behind 

00:06:55.890 --> 00:06:59.910
 to get that beautiful 

00:06:57.690 --> 00:07:02.580
 slightly bleached lip effect i'll 

00:06:59.910 --> 00:07:05.010
 use 631 tint color rish y 

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:07.020
 lipstick cream melting texture and her 

00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:09.090
 very easy to apply on lips 

00:07:07.020 --> 00:07:11.100
 feel comfortable during the day 

00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:13.260
 this is our adaptation today 

00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:15.180
 makeup in shades of brown hope you 

00:07:13.260 --> 00:07:17.220
 liked the idea and liked what I 

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:19.800
 slightly changed the colors to dark and 

00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:21.720
 war paint is nice but 

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:24.000
 the red carpet we while I'm every day with 

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:26.130
 you do not go so perhaps this 

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.780
 make up you more life i need 

00:07:26.130 --> 00:07:29.820
 I want to thank you so much for 

00:07:27.780 --> 00:07:31.890
 comment the most difficult moment 

00:07:29.820 --> 00:07:34.170
 when I have something pestered 

00:07:31.890 --> 00:07:36.360
 and falls out of hand i look in there reading 

00:07:34.170 --> 00:07:37.590
 I apologize for not having time to 

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:39.290
 all comments reply but i
