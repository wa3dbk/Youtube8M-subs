00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:06.150
 148 to which is added almost 8 points 

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:11.280
 than triple and which he would have missed 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:13.410
 it was a nice s.vito 56 because it really 

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:16.560
 that simple milk a forum on the 

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:18.570
 office this wonderful program that has 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.100
 presented on the gladiator's music 

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:23.250
 let's not follow sergei 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:27.599
 voronov fifth after the short program 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:31.740
 sergei voronov who is trained by nikolai 

00:00:27.599 --> 00:00:35.120
 Morozov and silver in national and russia 

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:35.120
 present us with marylin 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:02.690
 quadruple toh the perfect and we are at 4 

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:22.509
 triple assisted the climbed place 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:22.509
 very much but good at holding the finish 

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:38.200
 triple toe double tone loop 

00:01:39.909 --> 00:01:43.740
 there are many triple-tipped pads 

00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:54.220
 and a top is at 0 and these are 

00:01:51.860 --> 00:01:54.220
 points 

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:59.800
 and so the podiums are played there 

00:03:03.390 --> 00:03:09.550
 not well on the triple axel had the 

00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:11.490
 loss of balance on the phase of 

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:14.970
 preparation was already good at 

00:03:11.490 --> 00:03:14.970
 save it almost 

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:23.440
 double flip 

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:38.110
 axel triple bull this can't do it 

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:41.440
 is the third triple toe loop 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:43.420
 here it is that everything goes out 

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:46.470
 but these gentlemen men must learn 

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:46.470
 to count though 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:49.969
 the product 

00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:59.490
 i prosaic 

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:19.300
 because the voronoff as you said 

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:22.000
 they must learn to count and see a 

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:24.700
 another time to appear obviously 

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:27.730
 zero for the combination he couldn't 

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:31.389
 repeat with triple toe loop 

00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:34.960
 here he is togas over even admiration for 

00:05:31.389 --> 00:05:37.270
 what I really call myself when 

00:05:34.960 --> 00:05:39.190
 I commented she called double triple 

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:41.290
 double but see that the technical panel 

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:43.270
 had put a view they went to 

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:45.340
 see him again because maybe they too 

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:47.590
 they wanted to be sure it was 

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:49.900
 triple triple and now they gave it the 

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:52.300
 power in dirt so it goes out of the 

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:56.350
 values â€‹â€‹cannot be entered tolfa 

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:58.300
 out when I say the math of 

00:05:56.350 --> 00:06:01.960
 shoe this is pure mathematics because 

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:03.820
 having to redo the accounts what you do but 

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:06.280
 larch nego which is a triple can not 

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:08.500
 be repeated more than really no more 

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:11.320
 of two triples can be repeated 

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:13.810
 more than twice and if they are repeated 

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:15.700
 they must be in combination then you 

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:18.100
 you can choose two triples as you can 

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:20.080
 repeat if you repeat it must be in 

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:23.440
 combination he having made triple tom 

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:25.390
 tributo loop had already used his own 

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:27.130
 two knifes that he had already put on 

00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:30.729
 in combination he could no longer do it 

00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:32.380
 another and so you know why it comes out 

00:06:30.729 --> 00:06:34.360
 this error because that was the place 

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:36.060
 for the second as the quadruple will be 

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:38.229
 I remove with TNT 

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:41.020
 indeed, quadruple toeop was announced 

00:06:38.229 --> 00:06:43.810
 double toys and he did triple triple 

00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:46.000
 just opened in the combined me not 

00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:46.790
 would have had less had remembering 

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.950
 take it off 

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:53.210
 from the curia this is mathematics though 

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:55.880
 you have to be studying 24 prime you know that 

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:59.570
 I can't stand an error here 

00:06:55.880 --> 00:07:01.940
 triple emergency strategy sure how 

00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:03.410
 just as we see at times 

00:07:01.940 --> 00:07:04.580
 i really change completely 

00:07:03.410 --> 00:07:06.890
 presented programs 

00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:08.720
 yes it's not easy because you have to stay bright 

00:07:06.890 --> 00:07:10.320
 mind you remember what you did 

00:07:08.720 --> 00:07:12.540
 however in short 

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:17.640
 in men it often happens already successful 

00:07:12.540 --> 00:07:22.170
 many times I would say that in short something 

00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:23.640
 that we must remember who we see it for 

00:07:22.170 --> 00:07:25.470
 piece obviously thinks we have 

00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:30.060
 perfectly other because with 

00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:32.400
 that dress I could well do 

00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:33.810
 even being on the podium could go there 

00:07:32.400 --> 00:07:35.480
 very close 

00:07:33.810 --> 00:07:38.760
 and meanwhile it is warming up on the ice 

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:41.070
 javier fernandez javier fernandez that in 

00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:44.100
 second position those wagons are 

00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:47.310
 very important moments for everyone 

00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:50.180
 now no need to do 154 09 to overtake 

00:07:47.310 --> 00:07:51.800
 privacy baer has absolutely 

00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:54.229
 nay , even now not even scoring 

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:56.930
 to go to third place because 131 

00:07:54.229 --> 00:08:00.770
 and 80 take it to the fourth position 

00:07:56.930 --> 00:08:05.150
 he needed 133 51 for at least a 

00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:07.990
 the theme is certain, the top is certain 

00:08:05.150 --> 00:08:12.470
 completely true that are nonetheless 

00:08:07.990 --> 00:08:15.910
 45 points plus a combination element 

00:08:12.470 --> 00:08:15.910
 6 played ten points
