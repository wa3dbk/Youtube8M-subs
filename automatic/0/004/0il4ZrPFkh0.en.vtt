what you can do play is a very important
part<00:02:45.940> of<00:02:46.120> finding<00:02:46.630> out<00:02:46.750> where<00:02:46.989> you<00:02:47.110> fit<00:02:47.140> in<00:02:47.590> in

00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:47.770 
part of finding out where you fit in in

00:02:47.770 --> 00:02:49.380 
part of finding out where you fit in in
the<00:02:48.130> structure<00:02:48.610> in<00:02:48.760> the<00:02:48.820> pack<00:02:48.970> strategy<00:02:49.300> the

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:49.390 
the structure in the pack strategy the

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:51.510 
the structure in the pack strategy the
hierarchy<00:02:49.959> let<00:02:50.530> you<00:02:50.650> know<00:02:50.770> even<00:02:51.070> do<00:02:51.220> it<00:02:51.340> in<00:02:51.400> the

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:51.520 
hierarchy let you know even do it in the

00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:54.780 
hierarchy let you know even do it in the
wild<00:02:51.730> it's<00:02:52.570> not<00:02:52.959> aggressive<00:02:53.230> if<00:02:53.920> it<00:02:54.550> gets<00:02:54.700> a

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:54.790 
wild it's not aggressive if it gets a

00:02:54.790 --> 00:02:55.860 
wild it's not aggressive if it gets a
little<00:02:54.970> bit<00:02:55.209> too<00:02:55.330> out<00:02:55.450> of<00:02:55.480> hand<00:02:55.600> that's

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:55.870 
little bit too out of hand that's

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:57.449 
little bit too out of hand that's
because<00:02:56.200> somebody's<00:02:56.650> overstepping<00:02:57.220> the<00:02:57.430> mark

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:57.459 
because somebody's overstepping the mark

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:00.240 
because somebody's overstepping the mark
and<00:02:57.940> as<00:02:58.030> owner<00:02:58.480> of<00:02:58.810> your<00:02:59.260> dogs<00:02:59.530> you<00:02:59.950> probably

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:00.250 
and as owner of your dogs you probably

00:03:00.250 --> 00:03:02.490 
and as owner of your dogs you probably
know<00:03:00.459> which<00:03:00.670> one<00:03:00.940> of<00:03:01.030> them<00:03:01.180> does<00:03:01.750> tend<00:03:02.140> to<00:03:02.290> do

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:02.500 
know which one of them does tend to do

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.740 
know which one of them does tend to do
that<00:03:02.739> so<00:03:03.130> it's<00:03:03.250> understanding<00:03:03.970> the<00:03:04.330> signals

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:04.750 
that so it's understanding the signals

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:06.840 
that so it's understanding the signals
but<00:03:04.930> also<00:03:05.020> not<00:03:05.770> panicking<00:03:06.280> if<00:03:06.459> your<00:03:06.610> dogs

00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:06.850

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:08.800 
start to make a bit of a noise or you

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:10.620 
start to make a bit of a noise or you
know<00:03:09.010> how<00:03:09.160> to<00:03:09.220> have<00:03:09.370> a<00:03:09.400> grab<00:03:09.730> as<00:03:09.910> gypsy<00:03:10.480> was

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:10.630

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.120 
doing is you just saw so understand the

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:14.610 
doing is you just saw so understand the
difference<00:03:13.450> between<00:03:13.510> aggression<00:03:14.200> and<00:03:14.320> play

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:14.620 
difference between aggression and play

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:16.650
