cameo be salera so is it done in the

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:02.240 
cameo be salera so is it done in the
solar<00:00:56.730> system<00:00:57.440> which<00:00:58.609> have<00:00:59.609> explained<00:01:00.090> is<00:01:01.250> if

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:02.250 
solar system which have explained is if

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:04.660 
solar system which have explained is if
they<00:01:02.430> really<00:01:02.640> basically<00:01:03.180> but<00:01:03.930> what<00:01:04.229> I<00:01:04.260> can

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:04.670 
they really basically but what I can

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.429 
they really basically but what I can
take<00:01:05.670> off<00:01:05.880> the<00:01:05.909> system<00:01:06.390> of<00:01:06.540> the<00:01:06.720> severe<00:01:07.020> system

00:01:07.429 --> 00:01:07.439 
take off the system of the severe system

00:01:07.439 --> 00:01:10.130 
take off the system of the severe system
is<00:01:07.619> its<00:01:08.310> ancient<00:01:08.729> system<00:01:09.479> that's<00:01:09.689> been<00:01:09.810> going

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
is its ancient system that's been going

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.250 
is its ancient system that's been going
for<00:01:10.470> five<00:01:11.220> hundred<00:01:11.400> years<00:01:11.790> or<00:01:11.970> more<00:01:12.080> in<00:01:13.080> the

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
for five hundred years or more in the

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.469 
for five hundred years or more in the
sherry<00:01:13.530> making<00:01:13.920> industry<00:01:14.400> within<00:01:14.700> Spain<00:01:15.119> and

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
sherry making industry within Spain and

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:19.280 
sherry making industry within Spain and
obviously<00:01:16.880> one<00:01:17.880> producers<00:01:18.420> of<00:01:18.570> some<00:01:19.110> of<00:01:19.170> them

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:19.290 
obviously one producers of some of them

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.710 
obviously one producers of some of them
was<00:01:19.409> just<00:01:19.619> taking<00:01:20.189> this<00:01:20.310> system<00:01:20.759> to<00:01:21.270> give<00:01:21.420> more

00:01:21.710 --> 00:01:21.720 
was just taking this system to give more

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.210 
was just taking this system to give more
complex<00:01:22.290> flavors<00:01:22.380> to<00:01:22.830> they're<00:01:22.979> run<00:01:23.189> by

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
complex flavors to they're run by

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.370 
complex flavors to they're run by
putting<00:01:23.790> in<00:01:23.880> four<00:01:24.030> different<00:01:24.380> different

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380 
putting in four different different

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:30.219 
putting in four different different
types<00:01:25.590> of<00:01:25.799> barrels<00:01:26.159> now<00:01:27.380> the<00:01:28.380> factories<00:01:29.009> er

00:01:30.219 --> 00:01:30.229 
types of barrels now the factories er

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:34.789 
types of barrels now the factories er
it's<00:01:31.229> done<00:01:31.770> through<00:01:32.540> they<00:01:33.540> get<00:01:33.720> four<00:01:34.020> barrels

00:01:34.789 --> 00:01:34.799 
it's done through they get four barrels

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:39.410 
it's done through they get four barrels
on<00:01:35.009> the<00:01:35.490> bottom<00:01:35.880> for<00:01:36.540> high<00:01:37.220> you<00:01:38.220> know<00:01:38.400> and<00:01:38.610> what

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:39.420 
on the bottom for high you know and what

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.920 
on the bottom for high you know and what
they<00:01:39.540> do<00:01:39.600> then<00:01:40.020> is<00:01:40.049> they<00:01:41.150> run<00:01:42.150> cascades

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:42.930 
they do then is they run cascades

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.660 
they do then is they run cascades
through<00:01:43.290> the<00:01:43.530> layers<00:01:43.799> of<00:01:43.829> barrels<00:01:44.280> so<00:01:44.399> again

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670 
through the layers of barrels so again

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.060 
through the layers of barrels so again
you<00:01:44.790> put<00:01:44.970> the<00:01:45.030> running<00:01:45.299> at<00:01:45.390> the<00:01:45.479> top<00:01:45.689> it<00:01:46.409> spends

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
you put the running at the top it spends

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.999 
you put the running at the top it spends
a<00:01:47.130> time<00:01:47.369> in<00:01:47.579> turn<00:01:47.790> into<00:01:48.119> the<00:01:48.240> first<00:01:48.450> barrel

00:01:48.999 --> 00:01:49.009 
a time in turn into the first barrel

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:51.830 
a time in turn into the first barrel
they<00:01:50.009> let<00:01:50.250> how<00:01:50.399> proportion<00:01:50.939> of<00:01:51.030> the<00:01:51.180> run<00:01:51.390> into

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:51.840 
they let how proportion of the run into

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:55.399 
they let how proportion of the run into
the<00:01:51.930> second<00:01:52.259> barrel<00:01:52.970> and<00:01:53.970> they<00:01:54.090> just<00:01:54.240> keep<00:01:54.479> let

00:01:55.399 --> 00:01:55.409 
the second barrel and they just keep let

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:57.050 
the second barrel and they just keep let
out<00:01:55.590> a<00:01:55.619> portion<00:01:55.979> into<00:01:56.369> each<00:01:56.610> barrel

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:57.060 
out a portion into each barrel

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.590 
out a portion into each barrel
continuously<00:01:57.960> and<00:01:58.700> aging<00:01:59.700> and<00:01:59.850> it<00:02:00.119> takes<00:02:00.360> on

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
continuously and aging and it takes on

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.399 
continuously and aging and it takes on
flavor<00:02:00.899> from<00:02:01.229> each<00:02:01.380> barrel<00:02:01.860> as<00:02:02.159> it<00:02:02.340> passes<00:02:02.549> and

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:03.409 
flavor from each barrel as it passes and

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:06.590 
flavor from each barrel as it passes and
complexity<00:02:04.409> from<00:02:04.950> the<00:02:05.130> barrels<00:02:05.909> itself<00:02:06.329> and

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600 
complexity from the barrels itself and

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:07.139 
complexity from the barrels itself and
flavor

00:02:07.139 --> 00:02:07.149 
flavor

00:02:07.149 --> 00:02:09.180 
flavor
until<00:02:07.780> they<00:02:07.840> get<00:02:07.960> to<00:02:08.140> the<00:02:08.170> bottom<00:02:08.440> my<00:02:08.709> role<00:02:08.950> now

00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:09.190 
until they get to the bottom my role now

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:13.009 
until they get to the bottom my role now
when<00:02:09.910> it<00:02:10.030> gets<00:02:10.209> to<00:02:10.360> the<00:02:10.479> bottom<00:02:10.690> barrel<00:02:11.580> they

00:02:13.009 --> 00:02:13.019 
when it gets to the bottom barrel they

00:02:13.019 --> 00:02:17.460 
when it gets to the bottom barrel they
take<00:02:14.019> a<00:02:14.349> portion<00:02:15.010> of<00:02:15.250> run<00:02:16.019> from<00:02:17.019> the<00:02:17.200> bottom

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:17.470 
take a portion of run from the bottom

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.190 
take a portion of run from the bottom
barrel<00:02:17.830> and<00:02:18.489> they<00:02:18.610> put<00:02:18.819> it<00:02:18.910> into<00:02:19.030> a<00:02:19.150> perhaps<00:02:19.540> to

00:02:20.190 --> 00:02:20.200 
barrel and they put it into a perhaps to

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:25.110 
barrel and they put it into a perhaps to
mature<00:02:20.790> but<00:02:21.790> what<00:02:22.000> they<00:02:22.090> do<00:02:22.330> is<00:02:23.700> they<00:02:24.700> take<00:02:24.940> the

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:25.120 
mature but what they do is they take the

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.630 
mature but what they do is they take the
mother<00:02:25.360> run<00:02:25.690> which<00:02:26.230> is<00:02:26.440> could<00:02:26.769> be<00:02:26.799> at<00:02:27.010> the<00:02:27.099> 25

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:27.640 
mother run which is could be at the 25

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.479 
mother run which is could be at the 25
year<00:02:27.879> old<00:02:28.260> and<00:02:29.260> they<00:02:29.470> blending<00:02:29.920> high<00:02:30.190> purity

00:02:30.479 --> 00:02:30.489 
year old and they blending high purity

00:02:30.489 --> 00:02:33.360 
year old and they blending high purity
aged<00:02:31.030> ones<00:02:31.599> and<00:02:32.019> then<00:02:32.709> when<00:02:32.860> it<00:02:32.980> received

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370 
aged ones and then when it received

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.970 
aged ones and then when it received
receives<00:02:33.819> the<00:02:34.090> desired<00:02:34.510> maturity<00:02:35.200> they

00:02:35.970 --> 00:02:35.980 
receives the desired maturity they

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:40.170 
receives the desired maturity they
decant<00:02:36.670> it<00:02:36.940> by<00:02:37.470> caste<00:02:38.470> age<00:02:38.769> of<00:02:39.099> one<00:02:39.340> portion<00:02:39.849> in

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:40.180 
decant it by caste age of one portion in
