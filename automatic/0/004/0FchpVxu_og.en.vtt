00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:06.930
 hello to all if the hard drive I am in the company of lucho 

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.729
 of motivation 

00:00:09.729 --> 00:00:14.309
 So here is to make you a little video the first single of a 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:16.349
 video in which meet 

00:00:16.349 --> 00:00:19.720
 d to discern who will leave so what you see here 

00:00:20.419 --> 00:00:22.349
 percent eminem 

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:25.899
 Well, there is simply the bar thanks to a 

00:00:25.899 --> 00:00:29.889
 while some small traps condemine selected candidates - 

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:34.829
 so we showed ourselves less what represents 0 09% max 67 ' 

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:37.970
 so here have thanked m among them about 

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:43.550
 8 8% and so the tfc is in the labeaume that the lab of the server 

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:46.980
 the man who had 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.409
 we are just going very well 

00:00:49.409 --> 00:00:55.269
 one for the will be so it will not be convened we will say that I do not believe 

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:01.960
 city ​​that is practiced at the most disturbing ing that will actually go into 

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.190
 I did not know to believe that 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:07.100
 this is our mine 

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:10.450
 as a matter of fact, when sold 8% 

00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:14.100
 to appreciate the obsidian who needs his help 

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:18.770
 and lyon unfortunately he does not know what to expect seats he goes all 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:22.310
 so just descent this text is what it is and end up in this 

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.200
 labyrinth 

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:28.200
 I will go with him in here so no 

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.410
 in short, he slipped in the face of what is left as long as possible 

00:01:31.979 --> 00:01:34.979
 with this alone the sand surface that you see here 

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:38.650
 and so I even see that it happens pretty much there 

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:41.880
 the most important thing is in this crisis if this 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:45.020
 the the local call 

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:47.770
 this arrest turned 

00:01:47.770 --> 00:01:50.140
 here's the problem 

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:52.960
 versailles 

00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.980
 the torch name that would be nice to them 

00:01:55.980 --> 00:01:58.100
 in one year the system 

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:02.000
 so as an average to the game surface of the sands that we saw where apple in 

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:03.310
 underneath it gives that 

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:07.560
 so that simply rate all the blocks of bags are backed by 

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:08.449
 torches 

00:02:08.449 --> 00:02:12.219
 and just describe no it's thanks to this mud dropped into the water 

00:02:12.219 --> 00:02:16.610
 shop windows at first because you see here and every three months 

00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:21.090
 and at that moment so that the lavia be located above this news 

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:24.090
 disappointment of the material 

00:02:24.609 --> 00:02:26.779
 the player but a little idea 

00:02:26.779 --> 00:02:31.189
 little ones and who's going to be the player so that will fall in the lava and 

00:02:31.189 --> 00:02:33.309
 I will be and so 

00:02:33.309 --> 00:02:36.229
 on my little chair l 

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:38.129
 so here 

00:02:38.129 --> 00:02:41.449
 and there I see more I will watch him die in the lah so here we go 

00:02:42.379 --> 00:02:44.899
 but still 

00:02:44.899 --> 00:02:47.189
 off cac scor 

00:02:47.189 --> 00:02:51.180
 it's extra 14-0 but when you score on this earth 

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:56.009
 16:30 it would be then percent of patients torch 

00:02:57.099 --> 00:02:59.679
 so here is a small delegate 

00:02:59.679 --> 00:03:04.009
 the same everywhere so here is the living room will welcome castrated these 

00:03:04.009 --> 00:03:06.009
 researchers 

00:03:06.009 --> 00:03:09.899
 you are the problem to put the sums undue all the deputies of the 

00:03:09.899 --> 00:03:12.189
 new center nc it was pretty galley 

00:03:12.189 --> 00:03:15.189
 so here we describe the simplest possible 

00:03:18.169 --> 00:03:21.930
 so with this little baby's lay or use guns 

00:03:22.669 --> 00:03:23.769
 it's still more 

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:24.789
 the most expensive 

00:03:24.789 --> 00:03:29.259
 so outside we find ourselves right after a small list 

00:03:29.259 --> 00:03:30.859
 gentleman 

00:03:30.859 --> 00:03:32.939
 so that's the time she 

00:03:32.939 --> 00:03:34.089
 the proof 

00:03:34.089 --> 00:03:37.569
 dijon will only say those server connections and 

00:03:38.879 --> 00:03:42.299
 we find ourselves immediately c once we have conducted% year 

00:03:43.349 --> 00:03:46.209
 here he is at the fixed leg 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:49.209
 So here we are after this little elite 

00:03:50.349 --> 00:03:54.539
 so we finally found a master e of companies adopt the croisette 

00:03:54.539 --> 00:03:57.939
 this is our cowboy and whoever he wants 

00:03:57.939 --> 00:04:01.959
 without a collective stop and so she could make believe that he is happy 

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:03.129
 d 

00:04:03.129 --> 00:04:07.309
 we will make them leave if I had no adhesion is a ringworm difference 

00:04:07.309 --> 00:04:09.419
 of goals of city 2 

00:04:09.419 --> 00:04:10.569
 according to m 

00:04:10.569 --> 00:04:13.469
 this is the goal 

00:04:13.469 --> 00:04:16.469
 go she says it has to work 

00:04:18.719 --> 00:04:19.660
 for some people 

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:22.809
 eli lilly 

00:04:22.809 --> 00:04:25.809
 for gasoline 

00:04:30.379 --> 00:04:31.639
 Maehara 

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:34.639
 in the continuity that will come to his size do 

00:04:35.759 --> 00:04:38.759
 she exists to say 

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:46.110
 13 here 

00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:49.969
 if the conditions to withdraw 10 t he 

00:04:49.969 --> 00:04:51.849
 m 

00:04:51.849 --> 00:04:54.849
 actually entering the labyrinth 

00:04:55.529 --> 00:04:58.379
 very important point so there 

00:04:58.379 --> 00:05:00.610
 it's confirmed he added 

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:02.089
 thank you 

00:05:02.089 --> 00:05:05.180
 to the team it will be reduced 

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:07.559
 parallelism 

00:05:07.559 --> 00:05:10.559
 go learn this done cut 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:14.169
 they will find a message what is it 

00:05:14.169 --> 00:05:16.689
 he had to suspect something 

00:05:16.689 --> 00:05:18.110
 for 100 th 

00:05:18.110 --> 00:05:19.439
 m a thin then 

00:05:19.439 --> 00:05:22.439
 he will choose 

00:05:23.029 --> 00:05:26.029
 14 30 years writing like this at my home 

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:31.610
 if you were there 

00:05:34.889 --> 00:05:36.089
 perhaps 

00:05:36.089 --> 00:05:39.089
 according to the president 

00:05:39.639 --> 00:05:42.639
 it was so it is to enter 

00:05:47.129 --> 00:05:49.430
 what does he have to say what 

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:51.939
 go for years 

00:05:51.939 --> 00:05:54.469
 the american company 

00:05:54.469 --> 00:05:55.360
 we said 

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:56.999
 if we grow 

00:05:56.999 --> 00:05:59.740
 it is reinforced 

00:05:59.740 --> 00:06:01.240
 la France 

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:03.180
 it's a film that strengthens 

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:04.619
 so be careful 

00:06:04.619 --> 00:06:07.619
 alves but not the foot of the letter 

00:06:12.009 --> 00:06:15.009
 that's so we do not know when I go in a small chair 

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:18.460
 to watch how they intend to rally 

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:19.469
 This is not the same 

00:06:19.469 --> 00:06:22.469
 here we identified pity made and without button said 

00:06:24.729 --> 00:06:27.180
 in particular 

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:30.910
 that's what it is for these three Ivorian 

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:33.979
 Conversely 

00:06:33.979 --> 00:06:39.639
 what percentage does she hope to see with the one that does not repeat 

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:42.930
 right lineage 

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:44.819
 % 

00:06:44.819 --> 00:06:49.150
 well ben here is the vermin this episode is over so the lab table 

00:06:50.559 --> 00:06:52.099
 it is a fact 

00:06:52.099 --> 00:06:53.389
 but in the end 

00:06:53.389 --> 00:06:56.389
 a time 

00:06:58.479 --> 00:06:59.340
 Motherfucker 

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:02.800
 al chabaab go we're falling maybe 

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:03.759
 wrongly 

00:07:03.759 --> 00:07:09.500
 so it's not over the January retail sales placed at the bottom 

00:07:09.499 --> 00:07:12.669
 back I can not work you believe it 

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:17.979
 why I should stay there 

00:07:17.979 --> 00:07:19.990
 we can not speak 

00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:23.129
 why here 

00:07:23.129 --> 00:07:24.939
 then m 

00:07:24.939 --> 00:07:30.469
 so flying hours stop to moan a bit in outdoor success like 

00:07:30.469 --> 00:07:33.430
 we never say two without three 

00:07:33.430 --> 00:07:36.430
 percent after the losses he does not panic 

00:07:37.229 --> 00:07:40.319
 my heart goes to his side of camille 

00:07:40.319 --> 00:07:44.259
 so did you like it click on I love my country it's not 

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:47.099
 to post your comment 

00:07:47.099 --> 00:07:50.389
 and then to heal your chain 

00:07:50.389 --> 00:07:53.389
 the word of the end on Oct 6 

00:07:54.699 --> 00:07:56.149
 rock 

00:07:56.149 --> 00:07:57.360
 that people 

00:07:57.360 --> 00:07:58.159
 here 

00:07:58.159 --> 00:08:00.999
 yara next to the lake 

00:08:00.999 --> 00:08:02.610
 let's meet 

00:08:02.610 --> 00:08:05.259
 at a definite next denis 

00:08:05.259 --> 00:08:07.870
 go to tourcoing magnitski is even worse 

00:08:07.870 --> 00:08:09.050
 at the end of the crisis
