00:00:06.499 --> 00:00:10.019
 hello to everyone today in this 

00:00:08.519 --> 00:00:12.450
 video i'm going to show you how 

00:00:10.019 --> 00:00:14.849
 very simply make a saddle for 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.279
 your bike or your mobile is for me 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.109
 it's for mobile is precisely so the 

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:21.390
 first step which is optional well 

00:00:19.109 --> 00:00:24.679
 sure is to recover an old 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:26.150
 the bike and I ask to take 

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:28.349
 the part 

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:30.199
 angela how are we going to be able to do 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:31.969
 melt in a pan very easily 

00:00:30.199 --> 00:00:34.230
 after a few minutes 

00:00:31.969 --> 00:00:35.910
 everything starts to melt it must be well 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:38.149
 sure be on low heat for not the 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:38.149
 burn 

00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:45.329
 Yes 

00:00:43.070 --> 00:00:45.870
 then we will pour the hot gel in 

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.250
 a mold 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.960
 so I took a briefcase 

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.890
 plastic for it to be something 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.890
 Rectangular enough 

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:57.240
 once it's dry the mold is 

00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.760
 very fast and very easy is removed 

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:01.380
 simply our black gel and we 

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.680
 will then be able to use it for the 

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:03.680
 moped 

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:14.110
 so that's what it should give you 

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:16.060
 that a pretty thick plate and a gel 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:18.270
 which will be extremely pleasant for the 

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:18.270
 scene 

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:32.990
 the second step is to make a 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:35.090
 cover for your saddle so fake 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:36.440
 leather and soft foam data this is the 

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:37.970
 white part that you see on the 

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:40.850
 on it so you will start by doing 

00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:42.830
 the entire outline of your saddle so the 

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:44.780
 shape that you desire and separate you 

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:47.840
 in full of small sausages between 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:49.210
 quotes to make it stand out 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.369
 scene 

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:54.880
 then we always make an outline 

00:01:51.369 --> 00:01:57.430
 faux leather and seams 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:59.640
 and behind so that his farm the 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:01:59.640
 saddle 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:03.990
 and 

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:10.440
 once it's done we go back 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:14.360
 cover and that gives us a little insight 

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.360
 what will become of the scene 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:35.280
 it will have to fill 7 inches with 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:37.830
 the foam is why it is necessary that 

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.570
 you did not listen to the desired form 

00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:42.060
 so pieces of foam then me 

00:02:39.570 --> 00:02:43.860
 I had several small ones so I 

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:46.980
 assembled them and with glue 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:49.620
 epoxy it is very resistant it is necessary that 

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:50.850
 it's really thick foam and 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:52.490
 dance 

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:55.970
 finally you will need 

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:58.460
 around your future the one in 

00:02:55.970 --> 00:03:01.040
 plywood or very fine wood 

00:02:58.460 --> 00:03:02.790
 we will start with m the gel in the 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.590
 slipcover 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:06.090
 I 've put the driver's side 

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:08.390
 because I did not have enough to 

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:08.390
 put everywhere 

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:16.450
 reju the foam 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:27.060
 and we finish by putting the piece of 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:29.500
 plywood 

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:32.140
 we will now graffiti the fake leather 

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:33.250
 on the plywood so for that there is 

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:35.860
 a small technique is that it takes 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:37.840
 always put staples 

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:40.330
 the opposite of the one just put 

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:44.340
 that is to say we do the diagonals but 

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:44.340
 also in front of behind etc 

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:10.220
 that's what it looks like a fault all 

00:04:08.990 --> 00:04:12.220
 is of course 

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:12.220
 and 

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:21.760
 but 

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:23.169
 in my moped the tank is under 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:24.970
 saddle that's why I'm going to have to 

00:04:23.169 --> 00:04:26.590
 do something that opens so 

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:29.320
 I realized this part of wood that 

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:31.900
 you see there then the beveled on the 

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:35.729
 board I did that to the French and to the 

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:38.410
 center so gg all emptied to be able 

00:04:35.729 --> 00:04:40.540
 precisely will pass the entrance 

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:42.340
 birth the little hole you see at 

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:44.320
 the back is to put a key is 

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:47.380
 that it can do it but enough 

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:49.240
 just then the four holes are 

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:52.139
 intended to put screws to fix it 

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:52.139
 at the rear luggage rack 

00:04:55.289 --> 00:04:59.699
 in the front I made a hole for the tube 

00:04:57.210 --> 00:05:02.219
 from the old salt and on each side I 

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:04.139
 put some small hinge that we're going 

00:05:02.219 --> 00:05:04.949
 to fix on the appropriate part of 

00:05:04.139 --> 00:05:07.819
 make 

00:05:04.949 --> 00:05:07.819
 the foam part 

00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:16.390
 that's how it should be and 

00:05:12.770 --> 00:05:16.390
 so closed the saddle 

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:21.940
 you have here a brief overview of the 

00:05:20.200 --> 00:05:23.140
 lock that I'm going to put in so 

00:05:21.940 --> 00:05:25.330
 on the other side actually on a small 

00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:27.190
 board that will lock the 

00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:30.300
 upper part so all the holes in 

00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:30.300
 week of course in the luggage park 

00:05:31.569 --> 00:05:34.919
 that's what should look like 

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:41.200
 for the aesthetic side we will paint the 

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:43.240
 wooden part in black us that 

00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:45.630
 would then fit well into 

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:45.630
 the motorcycle 

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:55.340
 that's what the moped looks like and 

00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:57.830
 so I placed 

00:05:55.340 --> 00:06:00.370
 the open stage on to be able to 

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:00.370
 put the vices 

00:06:01.569 --> 00:06:04.919
 the profile is rather successful 

00:06:07.590 --> 00:06:12.060
 to fix them to the luggage rack I was 

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:14.780
 four countries so in the holes is suitable 

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:14.780
 to break through just now 

00:06:17.849 --> 00:06:23.360
 after placing the lock it is enough 

00:06:19.979 --> 00:06:23.360
 to open it by the second 

00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:34.270
 this room is very convenient for 

00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:36.070
 Simply put gas in 

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:37.960
 just plug here 

00:06:36.070 --> 00:06:39.850
 for the lock so you saw the 

00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:40.840
 little look is in doubt on time and he 

00:06:39.850 --> 00:06:44.880
 snaps 

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:44.880
 in a second that is attached to the front 

00:06:47.529 --> 00:06:54.089
 I hope this video will have you 

00:06:50.019 --> 00:06:54.089
 more and do not hesitate to subscribe
