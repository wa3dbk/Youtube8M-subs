zombies<00:00:44.820> ties<00:00:45.300> in<00:00:45.510> with<00:00:45.600> the<00:00:45.719> campaign<00:00:46.230> so

00:00:46.729 --> 00:00:46.739 
zombies ties in with the campaign so

00:00:46.739 --> 00:00:49.389 
zombies ties in with the campaign so
uses<00:00:47.100> a<00:00:47.180> teleporter<00:00:48.180> to<00:00:48.420> go<00:00:48.570> back<00:00:48.840> in<00:00:49.050> time

uses a teleporter to go back in time
Ryan<00:00:50.750> dude<00:00:51.750> oh<00:00:52.280> and<00:00:53.280> then<00:00:53.399> one<00:00:53.520> zombies<00:00:54.210> does

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
Ryan dude oh and then one zombies does

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.209 
Ryan dude oh and then one zombies does
have<00:00:54.809> a<00:00:54.840> dedicated<00:00:55.110> game<00:00:55.649> mode<00:00:55.920> and<00:00:56.100> that's

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
have a dedicated game mode and that's

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.160 
have a dedicated game mode and that's
how<00:00:56.370> you<00:00:56.699> can<00:00:56.820> play<00:00:56.940> as<00:00:57.059> the<00:00:57.149> Fab<00:00:57.360> Four<00:00:57.660> as<00:00:57.840> well

00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.170 
how you can play as the Fab Four as well

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.860 
how you can play as the Fab Four as well
so<00:00:58.770> zombies<00:00:59.219> just<00:00:59.850> ties<00:01:00.059> in<00:01:00.359> a<00:01:00.449> little<00:01:00.690> bit<00:01:00.780> to

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:00.870 
so zombies just ties in a little bit to

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.569 
so zombies just ties in a little bit to
campaign<00:01:01.230> like<00:01:01.410> we<00:01:01.530> have<00:01:01.739> seen<00:01:02.039> thundergun

00:01:02.569 --> 00:01:02.579 
campaign like we have seen thundergun

00:01:02.579 --> 00:01:05.050 
campaign like we have seen thundergun
crossovers<00:01:03.270> in<00:01:03.449> campaign<00:01:03.870> as<00:01:04.140> a<00:01:04.199> ray<00:01:05.010> gun

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:05.060 
crossovers in campaign as a ray gun

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:08.179 
crossovers in campaign as a ray gun
crossover<00:01:06.060> so<00:01:06.450> that<00:01:06.869> that's<00:01:07.229> illogical<00:01:07.650> okay

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
crossover so that that's illogical okay

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:11.060 
crossover so that that's illogical okay
I'm<00:01:08.460> buying<00:01:08.729> and<00:01:09.000> still<00:01:09.409> Ryan<00:01:10.409> find<00:01:10.920> himself

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:11.070 
I'm buying and still Ryan find himself

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.560 
I'm buying and still Ryan find himself
in<00:01:11.280> the<00:01:11.340> year<00:01:11.549> nineteen<00:01:11.580> forty<00:01:12.330> three<00:01:12.450> and

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
in the year nineteen forty three and

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.120 
in the year nineteen forty three and
have<00:01:12.810> to<00:01:12.930> try<00:01:13.140> and<00:01:13.290> change<00:01:13.500> the<00:01:13.619> course<00:01:13.979> of

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:14.130 
have to try and change the course of

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.429 
have to try and change the course of
history<00:01:14.280> so<00:01:15.030> this<00:01:15.210> is<00:01:15.420> how<00:01:15.570> we<00:01:15.630> tie<00:01:15.930> in<00:01:16.140> world

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
history so this is how we tie in world

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.560 
history so this is how we tie in world
at<00:01:16.619> war<00:01:17.159> so<00:01:17.580> we'd<00:01:17.700> have<00:01:17.729> world<00:01:18.060> at<00:01:18.119> war<00:01:18.330> two<00:01:18.540> and

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:18.570 
at war so we'd have world at war two and

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:20.870 
at war so we'd have world at war two and
we<00:01:18.810> get<00:01:18.960> World<00:01:19.170> War<00:01:19.290> two<00:01:19.470> weapons<00:01:19.860> this<00:01:20.549> deals

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
we get World War two weapons this deals

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.940 
we get World War two weapons this deals
with<00:01:21.060> an<00:01:21.150> alternate<00:01:21.689> storyline<00:01:22.140> of<00:01:22.170> origins

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:22.950 
with an alternate storyline of origins

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:25.520 
with an alternate storyline of origins
though<00:01:23.159> Dr<00:01:23.909> Maxis<00:01:24.119> gave<00:01:24.570> the<00:01:24.689> dg2<00:01:25.020> to<00:01:25.409> the

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530 
though Dr Maxis gave the dg2 to the

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.620 
though Dr Maxis gave the dg2 to the
Germans<00:01:25.950> you<00:01:26.159> need<00:01:26.310> to<00:01:26.400> stop<00:01:26.610> that<00:01:26.850> this<00:01:27.450> is

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:27.630 
Germans you need to stop that this is

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:28.969 
Germans you need to stop that this is
where<00:01:27.810> it<00:01:27.930> kind<00:01:28.080> of<00:01:28.200> hurts<00:01:28.380> me<00:01:28.590> I<00:01:28.770> don't

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
where it kind of hurts me I don't

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:31.370 
where it kind of hurts me I don't
there's<00:01:29.130> so<00:01:29.369> much<00:01:29.520> integration<00:01:30.090> zombies<00:01:30.720> that

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380 
there's so much integration zombies that

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.590 
there's so much integration zombies that
I'm<00:01:31.650> like<00:01:31.829> I<00:01:32.040> don't<00:01:32.369> know<00:01:32.700> if<00:01:32.850> I<00:01:32.909> can<00:01:32.970> leave<00:01:33.360> in

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:33.600 
I'm like I don't know if I can leave in

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:36.469 
I'm like I don't know if I can leave in
this<00:01:33.750> campaign<00:01:34.560> but<00:01:34.829> it<00:01:34.920> makes<00:01:35.280> sense<00:01:35.549> the

00:01:36.469 --> 00:01:36.479 
this campaign but it makes sense the

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:40.160 
this campaign but it makes sense the
thing<00:01:36.689> is<00:01:36.720> it<00:01:37.049> makes<00:01:37.290> sense<00:01:37.740> so<00:01:38.220> it<00:01:38.850> hurts<00:01:39.420> but

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:40.170 
thing is it makes sense so it hurts but

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.319 
thing is it makes sense so it hurts but
it's<00:01:40.470> possible<00:01:41.250> that<00:01:41.430> they<00:01:41.850> could<00:01:41.880> go<00:01:42.180> with

00:01:42.319 --> 00:01:42.329 
it's possible that they could go with

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.990 
it's possible that they could go with
that<00:01:42.450> steampunk<00:01:43.049> world<00:01:43.259> war<00:01:43.500> one<00:01:43.829> then<00:01:44.549> you

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
that steampunk world war one then you

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.450 
that steampunk world war one then you
know<00:01:45.119> I<00:01:45.780> mean<00:01:46.259> I<00:01:46.350> guess<00:01:46.590> it<00:01:46.799> wouldn't<00:01:47.040> be<00:01:47.159> based

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
know I mean I guess it wouldn't be based

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.280 
know I mean I guess it wouldn't be based
off<00:01:47.610> the<00:01:47.729> origin<00:01:48.149> setting<00:01:48.420> because<00:01:48.570> Maxis

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:49.290 
off the origin setting because Maxis

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:51.649 
off the origin setting because Maxis
will<00:01:49.439> give<00:01:49.560> the<00:01:49.710> Wunderwaffe<00:01:50.159> to<00:01:50.549> the<00:01:51.149> Germans

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
that would be a different story where he

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:54.889 
that would be a different story where he
didn't<00:01:53.369> die<00:01:53.490> in<00:01:53.520> origins<00:01:54.240> or<00:01:54.420> didn't<00:01:54.689> have<00:01:54.780> his
