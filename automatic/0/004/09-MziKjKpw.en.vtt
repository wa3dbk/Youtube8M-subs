of rapid growth in the skin now this

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:04.969 
of rapid growth in the skin now this
could<00:01:03.719> be<00:01:03.780> due<00:01:04.110> to<00:01:04.140> something<00:01:04.530> we're<00:01:04.830> familiar

00:01:04.969 --> 00:01:04.979 
could be due to something we're familiar

stretched out now the same thing can

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.929 
stretched out now the same thing can
happen<00:01:24.900> in<00:01:25.409> your<00:01:25.439> skin<00:01:26.009> with<00:01:26.220> its<00:01:26.369> elasticity

loses the ability to kind of form back

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.969 
loses the ability to kind of form back
into<00:01:33.270> itself<00:01:33.689> thus<00:01:34.200> causing<00:01:34.590> these<00:01:34.740> stretch

over time they do fade and they lighten
up<00:01:45.390> significantly<00:01:46.229> now<00:01:46.619> I<00:01:46.649> know<00:01:46.829> a<00:01:46.860> lot<00:01:47.040> of<00:01:47.070> you

because<00:01:49.020> I<00:01:49.170> just<00:01:49.409> recently<00:01:49.590> posted<00:01:49.950> a

00:01:50.149 --> 00:01:50.159 
because I just recently posted a

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:51.740 
because I just recently posted a
question<00:01:50.490> on<00:01:50.640> my<00:01:50.670> Facebook<00:01:50.820> page<00:01:51.329> asking

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750 
question on my Facebook page asking

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.990 
question on my Facebook page asking
about<00:01:52.110> this<00:01:52.320> subject<00:01:52.799> and<00:01:52.950> I<00:01:53.549> kind<00:01:53.880> of

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000 
about this subject and I kind of

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.580 
about this subject and I kind of
preempted<00:01:54.600> it<00:01:54.689> with<00:01:54.869> I'm<00:01:55.200> going<00:01:55.409> to<00:01:55.500> do<00:01:55.560> a

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
preempted it with I'm going to do a

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.410 
preempted it with I'm going to do a
video<00:01:55.799> on<00:01:56.159> this<00:01:56.340> and<00:01:56.610> I<00:01:56.640> asked<00:01:56.909> you<00:01:57.000> had<00:01:57.210> them

00:01:57.410 --> 00:01:57.420 
video on this and I asked you had them

00:01:57.420 --> 00:01:59.810 
video on this and I asked you had them
and<00:01:57.600> almost<00:01:57.719> everyone<00:01:58.439> that<00:01:58.680> responded<00:01:59.549> has

00:01:59.810 --> 00:01:59.820 
and almost everyone that responded has

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:01.399 
and almost everyone that responded has
had<00:02:00.119> them<00:02:00.329> there's<00:02:00.509> very<00:02:00.780> few<00:02:00.840> people<00:02:01.200> who

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
had them there's very few people who

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.469 
had them there's very few people who
said<00:02:01.649> I<00:02:01.710> don't<00:02:02.100> have<00:02:02.369> any<00:02:02.610> so<00:02:03.149> this<00:02:03.329> is

00:02:03.469 --> 00:02:03.479 
said I don't have any so this is

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.209 
said I don't have any so this is
something<00:02:03.810> that<00:02:03.840> a<00:02:03.960> lot<00:02:04.020> of<00:02:04.259> people<00:02:04.680> see<00:02:04.950> and

00:02:05.209 --> 00:02:05.219 
something that a lot of people see and

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:07.880 
something that a lot of people see and
the<00:02:05.670> reason<00:02:06.030> being<00:02:06.210> is<00:02:06.509> when<00:02:07.140> people<00:02:07.320> tend<00:02:07.770> to

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
the reason being is when people tend to

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.800 
the reason being is when people tend to
get<00:02:08.009> into<00:02:08.280> weights<00:02:08.550> or<00:02:08.879> training<00:02:09.390> or<00:02:09.509> anything

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:09.810 
get into weights or training or anything

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.110 
get into weights or training or anything
like<00:02:10.170> that<00:02:10.229> or<00:02:10.590> losing<00:02:11.009> weight<00:02:11.039> they<00:02:11.700> tend<00:02:12.000> to

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 
like that or losing weight they tend to

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.320 
like that or losing weight they tend to
go<00:02:12.270> all<00:02:12.510> in

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
go all in

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.060 
go all in
which<00:02:13.540> means<00:02:13.810> they<00:02:13.990> don't<00:02:14.140> have<00:02:14.380> acid<00:02:14.890> they

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:15.070 
which means they don't have acid they

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:16.500 
which means they don't have acid they
put<00:02:15.280> their<00:02:15.430> full<00:02:15.640> attention<00:02:15.760> into<00:02:16.270> it<00:02:16.390> because

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:16.510 
put their full attention into it because

00:02:16.510 --> 00:02:17.880 
put their full attention into it because
they<00:02:16.720> want<00:02:16.930> to<00:02:17.020> see<00:02:17.140> results<00:02:17.290> and<00:02:17.740> that's

00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:17.890 
they want to see results and that's

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:20.100 
they want to see results and that's
great<00:02:18.160> for<00:02:18.370> motivation<00:02:18.850> purposes<00:02:19.300> but<00:02:19.930> in

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:20.110 
great for motivation purposes but in

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:21.900 
great for motivation purposes but in
those<00:02:20.350> cases<00:02:20.740> what<00:02:21.130> you're<00:02:21.310> typically<00:02:21.640> going

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:21.910 
those cases what you're typically going

00:02:21.910 --> 00:02:23.700 
those cases what you're typically going
to<00:02:22.000> see<00:02:22.240> is<00:02:22.390> this<00:02:22.570> rapid<00:02:23.080> growth<00:02:23.110> of<00:02:23.350> new

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:23.710 
to see is this rapid growth of new

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:25.890 
to see is this rapid growth of new
muscle<00:02:24.160> and<00:02:24.340> thus<00:02:24.910> causing<00:02:25.420> some<00:02:25.630> stretch

00:02:25.890 --> 00:02:25.900 
muscle and thus causing some stretch

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:27.990 
muscle and thus causing some stretch
marks<00:02:26.260> or<00:02:26.800> in<00:02:27.040> the<00:02:27.160> past<00:02:27.370> if<00:02:27.610> you<00:02:27.700> put<00:02:27.910> on

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:28.000 
marks or in the past if you put on

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.120 
marks or in the past if you put on
weight<00:02:28.240> really<00:02:28.480> fast<00:02:28.600> or<00:02:29.230> if<00:02:29.830> you<00:02:30.010> were

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.130 
weight really fast or if you were

studies<00:02:55.900> to<00:02:56.200> really<00:02:56.410> prove<00:02:56.680> these<00:02:56.920> things<00:02:57.130> I

00:02:57.390 --> 00:02:57.400 
studies to really prove these things I

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:58.620 
studies to really prove these things I
