00:03:28.509 --> 00:03:28.519 
gold highlights on it and normally I

00:03:28.519 --> 00:03:31.449 
gold highlights on it and normally I
have<00:03:28.880> to<00:03:29.060> say<00:03:29.239> these<00:03:29.450> happens<00:03:30.310> scare<00:03:31.310> me

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:31.459 
have to say these happens scare me

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:33.670 
have to say these happens scare me
because<00:03:31.700> usually<00:03:32.299> they<00:03:33.290> don't<00:03:33.319> have<00:03:33.650> that

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:33.680 
because usually they don't have that

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:37.449 
because usually they don't have that
little<00:03:34.150> point<00:03:35.150> on<00:03:35.389> them<00:03:35.600> like<00:03:35.750> hat<00:03:35.989> pins<00:03:36.230> do<00:03:36.530> or

00:03:37.449 --> 00:03:37.459 
little point on them like hat pins do or

00:03:37.459 --> 00:03:38.920 
little point on them like hat pins do or
they<00:03:37.549> don't<00:03:37.639> have<00:03:37.819> this<00:03:37.940> little<00:03:38.420> stopper<00:03:38.900> on

00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:38.930 
they don't have this little stopper on

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:43.289 
they don't have this little stopper on
them<00:03:39.200> and<00:03:39.970> so<00:03:40.970> my<00:03:41.810> solution<00:03:42.350> after<00:03:42.590> I<00:03:42.769> started

00:03:43.289 --> 00:03:43.299 
them and so my solution after I started

00:03:43.299 --> 00:03:48.250 
them and so my solution after I started
making<00:03:44.299> these<00:03:44.600> because<00:03:44.840> I<00:03:44.900> love<00:03:45.139> them<00:03:45.290> is<00:03:45.470> to<00:03:47.260> 1

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:48.260 
making these because I love them is to 1

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.220 
making these because I love them is to 1
i'm<00:03:48.380> affixing<00:03:48.920> it<00:03:48.980> to<00:03:49.040> a<00:03:49.190> book<00:03:49.430> i<00:03:49.900> end<00:03:50.900> up<00:03:51.019> using

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:51.230 
i'm affixing it to a book i end up using

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:53.890 
i'm affixing it to a book i end up using
a<00:03:51.470> piece<00:03:51.859> of<00:03:51.889> adhesive<00:03:52.160> cork<00:03:52.849> like<00:03:53.569> a<00:03:53.599> little

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:53.900 
a piece of adhesive cork like a little

00:03:53.900 --> 00:03:56.140 
a piece of adhesive cork like a little
tiny<00:03:54.109> square<00:03:54.530> and<00:03:54.799> putting<00:03:55.549> that<00:03:55.670> back<00:03:55.880> behind

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:56.150 
tiny square and putting that back behind

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:59.110 
tiny square and putting that back behind
let's<00:03:56.870> see<00:03:56.930> the<00:03:57.109> flower<00:03:57.349> or<00:03:57.709> i<00:03:57.769> use<00:03:58.280> as<00:03:58.489> odd<00:03:58.730> a

00:03:59.110 --> 00:03:59.120 
let's see the flower or i use as odd a

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:01.270 
let's see the flower or i use as odd a
really<00:03:59.480> thick<00:03:59.720> glue<00:03:59.959> dot<00:04:00.200> and<00:04:00.470> then<00:04:01.099> i<00:04:01.250> just

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:01.280 
really thick glue dot and then i just

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:04.659 
really thick glue dot and then i just
fixed<00:04:01.940> it<00:04:02.269> where<00:04:02.900> I<00:04:02.930> want<00:04:03.349> the<00:04:03.799> tip<00:04:04.040> to<00:04:04.280> go<00:04:04.430> and

00:04:04.659 --> 00:04:04.669 
fixed it where I want the tip to go and

00:04:04.669 --> 00:04:06.370 
fixed it where I want the tip to go and
then<00:04:04.790> I<00:04:04.819> just<00:04:05.060> bury<00:04:05.299> the<00:04:05.389> tip<00:04:05.690> of<00:04:05.810> the<00:04:05.930> pin<00:04:06.169> in

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:06.380 
then I just bury the tip of the pin in

00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:08.890 
then I just bury the tip of the pin in
there<00:04:06.650> I<00:04:06.829> hope<00:04:07.010> that's<00:04:07.160> making<00:04:07.549> sense<00:04:07.849> but<00:04:08.720> my

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:08.900 
there I hope that's making sense but my

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:10.839 
there I hope that's making sense but my
solution<00:04:09.440> for<00:04:09.650> this<00:04:09.799> because<00:04:10.310> this<00:04:10.549> bow<00:04:10.819> is

00:04:10.839 --> 00:04:10.849 
solution for this because this bow is

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:13.990 
solution for this because this bow is
going<00:04:11.329> to<00:04:11.419> be<00:04:11.510> pulled<00:04:11.810> open<00:04:12.040> so<00:04:13.040> Donna<00:04:13.819> Marie

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:14.000 
going to be pulled open so Donna Marie

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.789 
going to be pulled open so Donna Marie
would<00:04:14.209> need<00:04:14.420> to<00:04:14.569> be<00:04:14.930> able<00:04:14.989> to<00:04:15.170> pull<00:04:15.470> this<00:04:15.500> out

00:04:15.789 --> 00:04:15.799 
would need to be able to pull this out

00:04:15.799 --> 00:04:17.319 
would need to be able to pull this out
and<00:04:15.860> then<00:04:16.220> apply<00:04:16.519> it<00:04:16.579> somewhere

00:04:17.319 --> 00:04:17.329 
and then apply it somewhere

00:04:17.329 --> 00:04:21.189 
and then apply it somewhere
to<00:04:17.599> I've<00:04:17.840> made<00:04:18.109> this<00:04:18.259> little<00:04:18.500> stopper<00:04:19.099> and<00:04:20.199> all

00:04:21.189 --> 00:04:21.199 
to I've made this little stopper and all

00:04:21.199 --> 00:04:24.820 
to I've made this little stopper and all
this<00:04:21.409> is<00:04:21.680> is<00:04:22.750> you<00:04:23.750> know<00:04:23.870> when<00:04:24.020> you<00:04:24.139> get<00:04:24.379> these

this is is you know when you get these

00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:28.929 
this is is you know when you get these

pretty<00:04:32.479> dense<00:04:32.840> and<00:04:33.169> I've<00:04:33.469> voice<00:04:33.740> been<00:04:34.039> trying

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:34.250 
pretty dense and I've voice been trying

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:35.709 
pretty dense and I've voice been trying
to<00:04:34.310> figure<00:04:34.400> out<00:04:34.520> what<00:04:35.090> to<00:04:35.150> do<00:04:35.389> with<00:04:35.419> these

00:04:35.709 --> 00:04:35.719 
to figure out what to do with these

00:04:35.719 --> 00:04:37.830 
to figure out what to do with these
things<00:04:36.050> and<00:04:36.349> so<00:04:37.039> I've<00:04:37.159> been<00:04:37.250> using<00:04:37.490> them<00:04:37.729> for

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:37.840 
things and so I've been using them for

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:40.570 
things and so I've been using them for
you<00:04:38.840> know<00:04:38.990> making<00:04:39.469> a<00:04:39.650> big<00:04:39.830> square<00:04:40.099> for<00:04:40.310> the<00:04:40.400> tip

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:40.580 
you know making a big square for the tip

00:04:40.580 --> 00:04:43.929 
you know making a big square for the tip
of<00:04:40.610> my<00:04:41.169> point<00:04:42.169> piercing<00:04:42.889> tool<00:04:43.099> but<00:04:43.550> anyway<00:04:43.879> so

00:04:43.929 --> 00:04:43.939 
of my point piercing tool but anyway so

of my point piercing tool but anyway so
it<00:04:44.449> seems<00:04:44.870> you<00:04:45.020> a<00:04:45.289> good<00:04:45.830> solution<00:04:46.159> for<00:04:46.340> this<00:04:46.610> so

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:47.210

I<00:04:47.240> just<00:04:47.449> cut<00:04:47.599> a<00:04:47.659> really<00:04:48.050> thin<00:04:48.409> piece<00:04:49.189> off<00:04:49.520> and

00:04:50.409 --> 00:04:50.419 
I just cut a really thin piece off and

00:04:50.419 --> 00:04:53.290 
I just cut a really thin piece off and
then<00:04:50.599> just<00:04:50.780> a<00:04:50.900> little<00:04:51.139> tiny<00:04:51.580> edge<00:04:52.580> here<00:04:53.150> with<00:04:53.270> a

00:04:53.290 --> 00:04:53.300 
then just a little tiny edge here with a

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:55.990 
then just a little tiny edge here with a
really<00:04:53.629> light<00:04:54.229> I<00:04:54.440> just<00:04:54.650> used<00:04:54.889> a<00:04:54.979> new<00:04:55.190> exacto

00:04:55.990 --> 00:04:56.000

00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.869 
really light I just used a new exacto
blade<00:04:56.030> it<00:04:56.569> makes<00:04:57.110> a<00:04:57.259> big<00:04:57.379> difference<00:04:57.440> and<00:04:58.129> then

00:04:58.869 --> 00:04:58.879 
blade it makes a big difference and then

00:04:58.879 --> 00:05:02.649 
blade it makes a big difference and then
just<00:04:59.270> put<00:04:59.449> that<00:04:59.629> little<00:05:01.150> little<00:05:02.150> square<00:05:02.629> a

00:05:02.649 --> 00:05:02.659

00:05:02.659 --> 00:05:04.809 
just put that little little square a
little<00:05:03.080> cube<00:05:03.469> on<00:05:03.620> the<00:05:03.740> end<00:05:03.919> so<00:05:04.280> that's<00:05:04.610> easily

00:05:04.809 --> 00:05:04.819

00:05:04.819 --> 00:05:07.149 
little cube on the end so that's easily
able<00:05:05.419> to<00:05:05.780> be<00:05:05.870> pulled<00:05:06.139> off<00:05:06.259> but<00:05:06.620> it's<00:05:07.009> not
