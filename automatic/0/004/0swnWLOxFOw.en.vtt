I'm<00:00:11.130> here<00:00:11.280> today<00:00:11.490> to<00:00:11.550> Don<00:00:11.759> a<00:00:11.849> duct<00:00:12.030> leakage

00:00:12.379 --> 00:00:12.389 
I'm here today to Don a duct leakage

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:15.020 
I'm here today to Don a duct leakage
test<00:00:12.690> is<00:00:13.019> a<00:00:13.110> total<00:00:13.590> duct<00:00:13.740> leakage<00:00:14.130> test<00:00:14.460> and

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
test is a total duct leakage test and

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:15.950 
test is a total duct leakage test and
what<00:00:15.210> we're<00:00:15.330> doing<00:00:15.480> there<00:00:15.570> was<00:00:15.660> a<00:00:15.690> deep

00:00:15.950 --> 00:00:15.960 
what we're doing there was a deep

00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:17.900 
what we're doing there was a deep
pressurizing<00:00:16.619> the<00:00:16.710> ducts<00:00:16.920> and<00:00:17.190> a<00:00:17.520> bit<00:00:17.670> and

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
pressurizing the ducts and a bit and

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:19.460 
pressurizing the ducts and a bit and
advantage<00:00:18.359> of<00:00:18.480> deep<00:00:18.630> pressurizing<00:00:19.230> as<00:00:19.350> it

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
advantage of deep pressurizing as it

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:21.170 
advantage of deep pressurizing as it
holds<00:00:19.859> all<00:00:19.980> the<00:00:20.100> grill<00:00:20.340> masks<00:00:20.580> that<00:00:21.029> we've

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
holds all the grill masks that we've

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.630 
holds all the grill masks that we've
placed<00:00:21.449> on<00:00:21.660> all<00:00:21.840> the<00:00:21.930> supply<00:00:22.320> and<00:00:22.380> returns<00:00:22.830> it

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:23.640 
placed on all the supply and returns it

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.340 
placed on all the supply and returns it
holds<00:00:23.970> it<00:00:24.060> to<00:00:24.269> the<00:00:24.449> register<00:00:24.900> rather<00:00:25.170> than

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
holds it to the register rather than

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:56.050 
holds it to the register rather than
pushing<00:00:25.590> it<00:00:25.800> away

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:56.060 

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:58.430 

we've<00:00:57.060> also<00:00:57.210> opened<00:00:57.660> up<00:00:57.750> the<00:00:57.930> door<00:00:58.140> here<00:00:58.410> that

00:00:58.430 --> 00:00:58.440 
we've also opened up the door here that

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:00.050 
we've also opened up the door here that
will<00:00:58.710> neutralize<00:00:58.860> any<00:00:59.400> pressure<00:00:59.700> difference

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:00.060 
will neutralize any pressure difference

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:01.880 
will neutralize any pressure difference

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
the deal 220 setup we've got the gauge

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.300 
the deal 220 setup we've got the gauge
set<00:01:12.750> up<00:01:12.870> to<00:01:13.290> be<00:01:13.410> your<00:01:13.590> pressure<00:01:13.890> difference

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:14.310 
set up to be your pressure difference

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.010 
set up to be your pressure difference
we're<00:01:15.060> reading<00:01:15.270> the<00:01:15.360> pressure<00:01:15.630> difference

00:01:16.010 --> 00:01:16.020 
we're reading the pressure difference

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:17.690 
we're reading the pressure difference
between<00:01:16.080> the<00:01:16.619> inside<00:01:16.830> of<00:01:17.190> the<00:01:17.250> house<00:01:17.400> that<00:01:17.580> we

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
between the inside of the house that we

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:20.350 
between the inside of the house that we
are<00:01:17.820> right<00:01:18.030> now<00:01:18.240> and<00:01:18.660> the<00:01:18.960> blue<00:01:19.170> tube<00:01:19.440> here

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:20.360 
are right now and the blue tube here

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:24.469 
are right now and the blue tube here
that<00:01:21.360> goes<00:01:21.540> to<00:01:21.570> a<00:01:22.550> return<00:01:23.550> the<00:01:24.119> reason<00:01:24.420> that

00:01:24.469 --> 00:01:24.479 
that goes to a return the reason that

00:01:24.479 --> 00:01:26.300 
that goes to a return the reason that
I've<00:01:24.600> selected<00:01:24.750> a<00:01:25.050> return<00:01:25.380> because<00:01:25.979> it's<00:01:26.220> an

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310 
I've selected a return because it's an

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:27.890 
I've selected a return because it's an
older<00:01:26.640> house<00:01:26.790> when<00:01:27.060> ducts<00:01:27.270> can<00:01:27.450> be<00:01:27.600> quite

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
older house when ducts can be quite

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:29.540 
older house when ducts can be quite
leaky<00:01:28.320> and<00:01:28.710> so<00:01:28.860> I<00:01:28.920> want<00:01:29.100> to<00:01:29.130> make<00:01:29.250> sure<00:01:29.400> that

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:29.550 
leaky and so I want to make sure that

00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:31.760 
leaky and so I want to make sure that
we're<00:01:29.700> getting<00:01:29.930> an<00:01:30.930> accurate<00:01:31.350> pressure

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
we're getting an accurate pressure

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.999 
we're getting an accurate pressure
reading<00:01:33.080> so<00:01:34.080> right<00:01:34.259> now<00:01:34.440> we've<00:01:34.590> got<00:01:34.740> the<00:01:34.860> gauge

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009 
reading so right now we've got the gauge

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.680 
reading so right now we've got the gauge
set<00:01:35.250> up<00:01:35.369> it's<00:01:35.520> on<00:01:35.640> the<00:01:35.790> open<00:01:36.090> range<00:01:36.270> which<00:01:36.570> is

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:36.690 
set up it's on the open range which is

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:38.660 
set up it's on the open range which is
the<00:01:36.810> correct<00:01:37.050> range<00:01:37.350> of<00:01:37.560> the<00:01:37.650> fan<00:01:37.890> we've<00:01:38.520> got

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:38.670 
the correct range of the fan we've got

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:40.580 
the correct range of the fan we've got
your<00:01:38.820> time<00:01:39.030> average<00:01:39.360> in<00:01:39.509> setup<00:01:39.900> and<00:01:40.110> we're

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590 
your time average in setup and we're

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:42.170 
your time average in setup and we're
just<00:01:40.680> going<00:01:40.860> to<00:01:40.950> go<00:01:41.070> ahead<00:01:41.190> and<00:01:41.520> achieve<00:01:41.880> a

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:42.180 
just going to go ahead and achieve a

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.420 
just going to go ahead and achieve a
pressure<00:01:42.450> difference<00:01:42.750> of<00:01:42.990> 25<00:01:43.440> Pascal's<00:01:44.130> and

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:44.430 
pressure difference of 25 Pascal's and

00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:46.190 
pressure difference of 25 Pascal's and
we're<00:01:44.970> going<00:01:45.090> to<00:01:45.119> record<00:01:45.450> the<00:01:45.600> flow<00:01:45.840> at<00:01:45.990> that

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
we're going to record the flow at that

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:53.840 
we're going to record the flow at that
point<00:01:48.530> set<00:01:49.530> pressure<00:01:49.800> 25<00:01:50.430> Pascal's<00:01:50.909> and<00:01:52.850> once

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
point set pressure 25 Pascal's and once

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.190 
point set pressure 25 Pascal's and once
the<00:01:53.970> fans<00:01:54.210> up<00:01:54.390> to<00:01:54.540> that<00:01:54.780> pressure<00:01:55.020> difference

the fans up to that pressure difference

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.800 
the fans up to that pressure difference
of<00:01:55.500> 25<00:01:55.740> Pascal's<00:01:56.370> will<00:01:56.940> record<00:01:57.270> that<00:01:57.330> reading

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:57.810 
of 25 Pascal's will record that reading

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:00.170 
of 25 Pascal's will record that reading
before<00:01:58.770> I<00:01:58.799> made<00:01:59.010> any<00:01:59.159> difficult<00:01:59.640> to<00:01:59.760> reach<00:02:00.000> in
