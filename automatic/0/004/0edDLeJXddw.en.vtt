00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:04.960 
in an F chord you have an F and a and a

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.040 
in an F chord you have an F and a and a
scene<00:02:05.229> and<00:02:05.610> inversion<00:02:06.610> is<00:02:06.789> a<00:02:06.850> different<00:02:07.750> form

00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:08.050 
scene and inversion is a different form

00:02:08.050 --> 00:02:10.020 
scene and inversion is a different form
of<00:02:08.229> this<00:02:08.470> same<00:02:08.830> chord<00:02:09.280> so<00:02:09.460> if<00:02:09.550> you<00:02:09.640> notice<00:02:09.910> on

of this same chord so if you notice on
plane<00:02:10.300> here<00:02:10.630> also<00:02:10.810> an<00:02:11.050> F<00:02:11.230> notice<00:02:11.770> i<00:02:11.950> have<00:02:11.980> an<00:02:12.460> F

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:12.730 
plane here also an F notice i have an F

00:02:12.730 --> 00:02:17.510 
plane here also an F notice i have an F
up<00:02:13.090> top<00:02:13.420> and<00:02:13.690> a<00:02:14.680> and<00:02:15.250> a<00:02:15.730> see<00:02:16.000> here<00:02:16.630> f

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:17.520 
up top and a and a see here f

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:23.120 
up top and a and a see here f
AC<00:02:18.380> here<00:02:19.380> FAC<00:02:20.070> FAC<00:02:21.710> so<00:02:22.710> there's<00:02:22.890> three

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.130 
AC here FAC FAC so there's three

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:25.750 
AC here FAC FAC so there's three
different<00:02:23.490> inversions<00:02:23.850> you<00:02:24.120> can<00:02:24.270> play<00:02:24.450> F<00:02:24.690> in

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:25.760 
different inversions you can play F in

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:27.800 
different inversions you can play F in
ok<00:02:26.760> so<00:02:26.820> that's<00:02:27.090> just<00:02:27.180> a<00:02:27.360> little<00:02:27.480> side<00:02:27.780> note

00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:27.810 
ok so that's just a little side note

00:02:27.810 --> 00:02:30.320 
ok so that's just a little side note
something<00:02:28.290> that<00:02:28.560> you<00:02:28.770> could<00:02:29.040> that<00:02:30.030> could<00:02:30.180> be

something that you could that could be

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:32.960 
something that you could that could be

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:35.850 
and the last chord is a nicely voiced C

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:37.820 
and the last chord is a nicely voiced C
chord<00:02:36.180> that's<00:02:36.780> my<00:02:36.930> favorite<00:02:37.290> court<00:02:37.500> of<00:02:37.620> it<00:02:37.710> all

as I did in my cover break it down into
single<00:03:16.750> notes<00:03:16.930> ok<00:03:17.530> so<00:03:17.590> the<00:03:17.980> B<00:03:18.520> flat<00:03:18.760> D<00:03:20.220> F<00:03:21.220> and<00:03:22.180> C

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
single notes ok so the B flat D F and C

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.350

and if you're feeling risky and you have
nice<00:03:25.600> big<00:03:25.840> hand<00:03:26.140> you<00:03:26.290> can<00:03:26.440> actually<00:03:26.770> throw<00:03:26.890> on

the<00:03:27.190> fifth<00:03:27.430> interval

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:29.770 
the fifth interval

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:31.980 
the fifth interval
in<00:03:30.010> between<00:03:30.580> each<00:03:30.970> of<00:03:31.180> these<00:03:31.300> octaves<00:03:31.720> so<00:03:31.870> the

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:31.990 
in between each of these octaves so the

00:03:31.990 --> 00:03:33.860 
in between each of these octaves so the
fifth<00:03:32.140> interval<00:03:32.470> here<00:03:32.680> for<00:03:32.860> the<00:03:32.920> B<00:03:33.040> flat<00:03:33.250> is<00:03:33.430> f

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870 
fifth interval here for the B flat is f

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:37.790 
fifth interval here for the B flat is f
so<00:03:34.870> that<00:03:35.050> is<00:03:35.170> that<00:03:35.380> one<00:03:35.590> going<00:03:35.890> to<00:03:36.070> the<00:03:36.190> D<00:03:36.310> chord

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:37.800 
so that is that one going to the D chord

00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:40.980 
so that is that one going to the D chord
there's<00:03:38.490> your<00:03:38.640> a<00:03:38.880> and<00:03:39.180> then<00:03:39.390> to<00:03:39.540> F

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:40.990 
there's your a and then to F

00:03:40.990 --> 00:03:43.020 
there's your a and then to F
or<00:03:41.560> the<00:03:41.710> sea<00:03:41.920> in<00:03:42.040> the<00:03:42.070> middle<00:03:42.370> and<00:03:42.430> then<00:03:42.550> to<00:03:42.730> a<00:03:42.760> C

00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:43.030 
or the sea in the middle and then to a C

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:46.200 
or the sea in the middle and then to a C
chord<00:03:43.270> with<00:03:43.720> a<00:03:43.750> G<00:03:44.110> in<00:03:44.230> the<00:03:44.320> middle<00:03:45.030> okay<00:03:46.030> so<00:03:46.090> all

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:46.210 
chord with a G in the middle okay so all

00:03:46.210 --> 00:03:56.550 
chord with a G in the middle okay so all
together<00:03:46.540> you<00:03:46.810> should<00:03:46.840> have<00:03:47.110> this

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:56.560 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:06.330 

so<00:03:57.560> up<00:03:57.680> to<00:03:57.830> tempo<00:03:58.160> it<00:03:58.370> goes

00:04:06.330 --> 00:04:06.340 

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:09.180 

and<00:04:06.430> then<00:04:06.970> that's<00:04:07.239> how<00:04:07.450> the<00:04:07.510> verse<00:04:07.810> goes<00:04:08.190> there

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:09.190 
and then that's how the verse goes there

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:12.089

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:50.560 
secrets of chord piano now let's get

00:04:50.560 --> 00:05:00.379 
secrets of chord piano now let's get
back<00:04:50.770> to<00:04:51.100> the<00:04:51.220> lesson<00:04:51.550> and<00:04:51.810> it<00:04:52.810> goes<00:04:52.960> like<00:04:53.139> this

00:05:00.379 --> 00:05:00.389 

00:05:00.389 --> 00:05:05.129 

okay<00:05:01.389> so<00:05:01.449> slowly<00:05:02.430> you<00:05:03.430> have<00:05:03.580> an<00:05:03.699> a/c<00:05:04.330> to<00:05:04.900> an<00:05:04.990> F

00:05:05.129 --> 00:05:05.139 
okay so slowly you have an a/c to an F

00:05:05.139 --> 00:05:08.100 
okay so slowly you have an a/c to an F
to<00:05:06.130> G<00:05:06.160> and<00:05:06.729> then<00:05:06.820> to<00:05:07.030> an<00:05:07.120> A<00:05:07.330> and<00:05:07.630> then<00:05:08.020> you

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:08.110 
to G and then to an A and then you

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:19.910 
to G and then to an A and then you
repeat<00:05:08.410> so<00:05:08.740> the<00:05:08.979> rhythm<00:05:09.280> would<00:05:09.370> go

00:05:19.910 --> 00:05:19.920 

00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:23.050 

so<00:05:20.520> notice<00:05:20.850> I'm<00:05:21.000> doing<00:05:21.330> this

00:05:23.050 --> 00:05:23.060 
so notice I'm doing this

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:25.530 
so notice I'm doing this
three<00:05:23.930> times<00:05:24.169> one

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:25.540 
three times one

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:27.360 
three times one
jus

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:27.370 
jus

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:28.839 
jus
three

00:05:28.839 --> 00:05:28.849 
three

00:05:28.849 --> 00:05:31.689 
three
and<00:05:28.969> on<00:05:29.629> the<00:05:29.749> fourth<00:05:30.139> one<00:05:30.490> instead<00:05:31.490> of<00:05:31.520> going

00:05:31.689 --> 00:05:31.699 
and on the fourth one instead of going

00:05:31.699 --> 00:05:34.630 
and on the fourth one instead of going
like<00:05:31.939> this<00:05:32.179> I<00:05:32.479> go

00:05:34.630 --> 00:05:34.640 
like this I go

00:05:34.640 --> 00:05:36.500 
like this I go
okay<00:05:35.640> so<00:05:35.700> that's<00:05:36.000> where<00:05:36.180> the<00:05:36.240> switch-up

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:36.510 
okay so that's where the switch-up

00:05:36.510 --> 00:05:40.340 
okay so that's where the switch-up
happens<00:05:36.990> it's<00:05:37.950> a<00:05:38.070> total<00:05:38.400> of<00:05:38.460> four<00:05:38.990> there's<00:05:39.990> one

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:40.350 
happens it's a total of four there's one

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:45.270 
happens it's a total of four there's one
two<00:05:41.600> three<00:05:42.600> and<00:05:42.810> then<00:05:43.140> switch<00:05:43.440> up

00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:45.280 
two three and then switch up

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:47.670 
two three and then switch up
so<00:05:46.060> what<00:05:46.420> you're<00:05:46.540> going<00:05:46.630> to<00:05:46.690> do<00:05:46.930> is<00:05:47.200> you<00:05:47.650> are

00:05:47.670 --> 00:05:47.680 
so what you're going to do is you are

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:49.410 
so what you're going to do is you are
going<00:05:47.830> to<00:05:48.190> do<00:05:48.520> the<00:05:48.639> same<00:05:48.670> chords<00:05:49.180> in<00:05:49.270> your<00:05:49.300> left
