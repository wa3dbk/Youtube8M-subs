for stowaways with her she was pregnant

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:25.980 
for stowaways with her she was pregnant

one of those stowaways with me so who's

00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:27.960 
one of those stowaways with me so who's
over<00:00:26.289> here<00:00:26.560> me<00:00:27.160> so<00:00:27.310> had<00:00:27.490> an<00:00:27.610> accident

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:27.970 
over here me so had an accident

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:30.720 
over here me so had an accident
yesterday<00:00:28.590> she<00:00:29.590> was<00:00:29.740> out<00:00:29.920> on<00:00:30.070> our<00:00:30.220> daily<00:00:30.400> pack

yesterday she was out on our daily pack

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:33.779 
yesterday she was out on our daily pack
walks<00:00:31.030> and<00:00:31.360> I<00:00:31.869> guess<00:00:32.079> her<00:00:32.409> and<00:00:32.789> rattlesnake

00:00:33.779 --> 00:00:33.789 
walks and I guess her and rattlesnake

00:00:33.789 --> 00:00:37.500 
walks and I guess her and rattlesnake
decided<00:00:34.539> to<00:00:34.749> kiss<00:00:35.589> or<00:00:35.890> whatever<00:00:36.399> they<00:00:36.579> did<00:00:36.850> but

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:37.510 
decided to kiss or whatever they did but

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:39.500 
decided to kiss or whatever they did but
the<00:00:37.629> rattlesnake<00:00:38.079> bidder<00:00:38.289> on<00:00:38.379> her<00:00:38.649> face<00:00:38.890> and

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
the rattlesnake bidder on her face and

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:42.270 
the rattlesnake bidder on her face and
so<00:00:40.510> she's<00:00:40.690> recovering<00:00:41.140> from<00:00:41.289> that<00:00:41.379> her<00:00:42.039> face

00:00:42.270 --> 00:00:42.280 
so she's recovering from that her face

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:44.939 
so she's recovering from that her face
right<00:00:42.579> now<00:00:42.609> is<00:00:43.149> swollen<00:00:43.929> about<00:00:44.350> two<00:00:44.589> or<00:00:44.739> three

00:00:44.939 --> 00:00:44.949 
right now is swollen about two or three

00:00:44.949 --> 00:00:46.649 
right now is swollen about two or three
times<00:00:45.219> the<00:00:45.489> size<00:00:45.519> it<00:00:45.909> normally<00:00:46.239> would<00:00:46.420> be

00:00:46.649 --> 00:00:46.659 
times the size it normally would be

00:00:46.659 --> 00:00:48.630 
times the size it normally would be
because<00:00:46.839> of<00:00:47.379> that<00:00:47.559> rattlesnake<00:00:47.890> bite<00:00:48.249> we<00:00:48.460> took

00:00:48.630 --> 00:00:48.640 
because of that rattlesnake bite we took

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.369 
because of that rattlesnake bite we took

00:00:58.529 --> 00:00:58.539 
back here to boxer town because we have

00:00:58.539 --> 00:01:01.529 
back here to boxer town because we have
a<00:00:58.569> holistic<00:00:59.229> treatment<00:00:59.649> we've<00:01:00.549> used<00:01:00.879> on<00:01:01.269> in

00:01:01.529 --> 00:01:01.539 
a holistic treatment we've used on in

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:03.329 
a holistic treatment we've used on in
the<00:01:01.659> past<00:01:01.929> for<00:01:02.350> rattlesnake<00:01:02.829> bites<00:01:03.069> that's

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:03.339 
the past for rattlesnake bites that's

00:01:03.339 --> 00:01:07.260 
the past for rattlesnake bites that's
proven<00:01:03.639> very<00:01:03.819> successful<00:01:04.620> and<00:01:05.620> is<00:01:06.280> less<00:01:06.640> toxic

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:07.270 
proven very successful and is less toxic

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:08.580 
proven very successful and is less toxic
and<00:01:07.450> invasive<00:01:07.900> than<00:01:08.080> some<00:01:08.440> of<00:01:08.500> the

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:08.590 
and invasive than some of the

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:10.530 
and invasive than some of the
contemporary<00:01:08.860> treatments<00:01:09.580> so<00:01:10.150> we<00:01:10.270> believe

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:10.540 
contemporary treatments so we believe

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:12.270 
contemporary treatments so we believe
she's<00:01:10.690> going<00:01:10.840> to<00:01:10.900> make<00:01:10.990> a<00:01:11.020> full<00:01:11.290> recovery<00:01:11.500> this

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:12.280 
she's going to make a full recovery this

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:14.460 
she's going to make a full recovery this
is<00:01:12.460> 24<00:01:12.970> hours<00:01:13.300> after<00:01:13.570> she<00:01:13.810> was<00:01:14.050> bitten<00:01:14.170> by<00:01:14.320> the

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:14.470 
is 24 hours after she was bitten by the

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:16.650 
is 24 hours after she was bitten by the
snake<00:01:14.590> and<00:01:15.100> she's<00:01:15.610> back<00:01:15.820> to<00:01:16.120> being<00:01:16.150> able<00:01:16.600> to

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:16.660 
snake and she's back to being able to

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:18.690 
snake and she's back to being able to
walk<00:01:16.840> just<00:01:17.080> fine<00:01:17.200> her<00:01:17.590> attitude<00:01:18.070> is<00:01:18.100> back<00:01:18.490> to

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:18.700 
walk just fine her attitude is back to

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:22.950 
walk just fine her attitude is back to
normal<00:01:19.080> she's<00:01:20.080> rather<00:01:20.290> happy<00:01:20.800> and<00:01:21.690> other<00:01:22.690> than

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:22.960 
normal she's rather happy and other than

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:25.470 
normal she's rather happy and other than
the<00:01:23.080> swelling<00:01:23.590> which<00:01:23.740> can<00:01:23.950> last<00:01:24.130> up<00:01:24.490> to<00:01:24.520> a<00:01:25.120> week

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:25.480 
the swelling which can last up to a week

00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:29.040 
the swelling which can last up to a week
or<00:01:25.870> more<00:01:26.250> I<00:01:27.250> think<00:01:27.760> her<00:01:27.940> symptoms<00:01:28.270> are<00:01:28.750> getting

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:29.050 
or more I think her symptoms are getting

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:31.470 
or more I think her symptoms are getting
better<00:01:29.170> she<00:01:29.440> had<00:01:29.620> a<00:01:29.650> very<00:01:29.920> fast<00:01:30.400> heartbeat<00:01:30.820> it

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:31.480 
better she had a very fast heartbeat it

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:34.950 
better she had a very fast heartbeat it
was<00:01:31.870> up<00:01:32.380> to<00:01:32.740> around<00:01:33.640> 200<00:01:33.940> beats<00:01:34.300> per<00:01:34.450> minute

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:34.960 
was up to around 200 beats per minute

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:36.630 
was up to around 200 beats per minute
initially<00:01:35.770> it's<00:01:35.950> dropped<00:01:36.190> down<00:01:36.340> to<00:01:36.400> around

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:36.640 
initially it's dropped down to around

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.600 
initially it's dropped down to around
130<00:01:37.630> or<00:01:37.780> so<00:01:37.960> beats<00:01:38.200> per<00:01:38.410> minute<00:01:38.710> now<00:01:38.860> and<00:01:39.490> I'll

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:39.610 
130 or so beats per minute now and I'll

00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:41.190 
130 or so beats per minute now and I'll
probably<00:01:39.760> go<00:01:40.030> a<00:01:40.060> little<00:01:40.300> bit<00:01:40.450> lower<00:01:40.660> Mort<00:01:41.020> in

00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:41.200 
probably go a little bit lower Mort in

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:44.580 
probably go a little bit lower Mort in
the<00:01:41.350> normal<00:01:41.650> range<00:01:41.800> as<00:01:42.100> she<00:01:42.570> recovers<00:01:43.590> from

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:44.590 
the normal range as she recovers from

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:46.500 
the normal range as she recovers from
the<00:01:44.770> toxins<00:01:45.220> from<00:01:45.310> the<00:01:45.400> rattlesnake<00:01:45.880> bite<00:01:46.060> me

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:46.510 
the toxins from the rattlesnake bite me

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:50.130 
the toxins from the rattlesnake bite me
