00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
 Hello my name is Zhenya and with you 

00:00:01.949 --> 00:00:06.960
 Turks skolko today we will cook 

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:09.360
 the easiest pilau and with bulgur 

00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:10.889
 for this we need somewhere dining 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.559
 spoon of butter 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.929
 melt it in the pan when our 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:19.320
 butter melted we add our mound 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:20.539
 and just for a few minutes here 

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.900
 so here it is 

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:27.109
 stir it a little bit as if 

00:00:24.900 --> 00:00:30.000
 would redden 

00:00:27.109 --> 00:00:35.130
 does not leave the pan look for 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:37.050
 You can turn it on in this way 

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:38.000
 small fire and so average even 

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.969
 above the average 

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:45.120
 so this bulgur is coming to 

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:47.430
 any meat dishes to vegetable stews to 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:51.030
 preparing everything very simply very 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.789
 do not rinse it quickly as in 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:59.070
 unlike white rice 

00:00:52.789 --> 00:01:02.489
 so decide here look 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:06.439
 what he already toasty smell 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:09.720
 roasted seeds you can see what he is 

00:01:06.439 --> 00:01:15.320
 becomes so golden crisp 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:15.320
 and it smells really like frying sunflower seeds 

00:01:17.869 --> 00:01:22.340
 the main thing that did not smell palenke 

00:01:23.689 --> 00:01:29.130
 Of course there are different types of it is 

00:01:26.220 --> 00:01:31.860
 can we cook this pilaf we 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.770
 for example, immediately squeezed his sweat 

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:36.930
 add combines then tomato paste and 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:41.880
 after that add 

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:44.520
 directly bulgur but i want you 

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:50.399
 initially now show the easiest 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:52.259
 the way but nonetheless delicious, too, and I 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:56.390
 would say even more useful because 

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:59.930
 in a purse more useful than white rice 

00:01:56.390 --> 00:02:02.700
 if this nutty white rice is good 

00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:04.909
 now that you see him like this 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:08.030
 brown became 

00:02:04.909 --> 00:02:11.209
 Now we will fill all with water 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:14.150
 cover and not to open that 

00:02:11.209 --> 00:02:15.830
 time as the water completely evaporates 

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:19.330
 there is no need to release this steam to 

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:23.000
 she prepared everything well and 

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:27.440
 you can salt now later 

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:29.840
 peasants salute so now i'm already 

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:32.450
 pour water and cover the lid here 

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:37.040
 so much we poured more accurate water 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:38.360
 Now we will cover with a lid and watch on 

00:02:37.040 --> 00:02:41.920
 little fire has become 

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:46.190
 and so that she slowly prepared slowly 

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:50.180
 so do less fire all almost 

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:53.180
 ready and here is our cat pilaf look 

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:57.640

00:02:53.180 --> 00:03:01.549
 minutes with a covered lid and some water here 

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:03.620
