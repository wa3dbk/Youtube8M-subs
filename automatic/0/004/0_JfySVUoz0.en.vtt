where a veteran stadium used to be

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:55.110 
where a veteran stadium used to be
it<00:02:52.720> started<00:02:53.620> out<00:02:53.830> of<00:02:53.860> our<00:02:54.220> sight<00:02:54.550> as<00:02:54.760> it<00:02:54.910> worked

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:55.120 
it started out of our sight as it worked

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:56.640 
it started out of our sight as it worked
its<00:02:55.239> way<00:02:55.450> clockwise<00:02:55.780> around

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.650 
its way clockwise around

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:59.100 
its way clockwise around
we<00:02:57.010> heard<00:02:57.280> it<00:02:57.489> before<00:02:57.640> we<00:02:58.030> saw<00:02:58.300> it<00:02:58.510> and<00:02:58.720> then

00:02:59.100 --> 00:02:59.110 
we heard it before we saw it and then

00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:02.340 
we heard it before we saw it and then
when<00:02:59.230> it<00:02:59.350> came<00:02:59.530> around<00:03:00.450> the<00:03:01.450> dust<00:03:01.750> started<00:03:02.200> to

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:02.350 
when it came around the dust started to

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:04.590 
when it came around the dust started to
to<00:03:02.830> move<00:03:02.980> upward<00:03:03.459> which<00:03:03.640> really<00:03:03.910> kind<00:03:04.450> of

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:04.600 
to move upward which really kind of

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:06.750 
to move upward which really kind of
obscured<00:03:05.140> the<00:03:05.230> view<00:03:05.380> so<00:03:05.830> for<00:03:06.340> I<00:03:06.370> would<00:03:06.730> say

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760 
obscured the view so for I would say

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:08.340 
obscured the view so for I would say
half<00:03:07.239> of<00:03:07.450> the<00:03:07.600> one<00:03:07.810> minute

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:08.350 
half of the one minute

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:10.140 
half of the one minute
we<00:03:08.620> couldn't<00:03:09.010> see<00:03:09.190> anything<00:03:09.459> because<00:03:09.760> of<00:03:09.940> the

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:10.150 
we couldn't see anything because of the

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:12.870 
we couldn't see anything because of the
dust<00:03:10.330> clouds<00:03:10.690> that<00:03:10.959> are<00:03:11.200> now<00:03:11.470> traveling<00:03:12.250> due

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:12.880 
dust clouds that are now traveling due

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:15.090 
dust clouds that are now traveling due
east<00:03:13.239> which<00:03:13.660> is<00:03:13.780> I<00:03:13.900> think<00:03:13.930> exactly<00:03:14.739> what<00:03:14.920> they

00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:15.100 
east which is I think exactly what they

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:17.100 
east which is I think exactly what they
hope<00:03:15.280> for<00:03:15.310> it's<00:03:16.060> going<00:03:16.239> to<00:03:16.330> pass<00:03:16.540> the<00:03:16.750> Holiday

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:17.110 
hope for it's going to pass the Holiday

about this before going on the air we we

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:43.350 
about this before going on the air we we
wondered<00:03:42.340> if<00:03:42.489> we<00:03:42.519> would<00:03:42.820> be<00:03:42.940> able<00:03:43.120> to<00:03:43.180> feel

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:43.360 
wondered if we would be able to feel

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:45.560 
wondered if we would be able to feel
some<00:03:43.630> of<00:03:43.720> the<00:03:43.780> ground<00:03:44.019> vibrations<00:03:44.769> from<00:03:44.920> here

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:45.570 
some of the ground vibrations from here

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:48.750 
some of the ground vibrations from here
and<00:03:46.570> we<00:03:46.720> could<00:03:46.959> and<00:03:47.200> we<00:03:47.230> could<00:03:47.860> but<00:03:48.220> what<00:03:48.640> was

00:03:48.750 --> 00:03:48.760 
and we could and we could but what was

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:49.920 
and we could and we could but what was
it<00:03:48.880> like<00:03:48.970> from<00:03:49.299> where<00:03:49.450> you<00:03:49.660> are<00:03:49.810> because

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:49.930 
it like from where you are because

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:51.750 
it like from where you are because
obviously<00:03:50.170> you're<00:03:50.560> much<00:03:50.709> closer<00:03:51.010> than<00:03:51.160> we<00:03:51.400> are

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:51.760 
obviously you're much closer than we are

00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:53.880 
obviously you're much closer than we are
well<00:03:52.030> you<00:03:52.180> know<00:03:52.299> I'm<00:03:52.600> on<00:03:52.630> a<00:03:52.840> riser<00:03:53.230> which<00:03:53.709> is

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:53.890 
well you know I'm on a riser which is

00:03:53.890 --> 00:03:56.039 
well you know I'm on a riser which is
approximately<00:03:54.250> I<00:03:54.760> say<00:03:55.180> four<00:03:55.510> feet<00:03:55.780> off<00:03:56.019> the

00:03:56.039 --> 00:03:56.049 
approximately I say four feet off the

00:03:56.049 --> 00:03:58.199 
approximately I say four feet off the
ground<00:03:56.470> where<00:03:57.040> all<00:03:57.190> the<00:03:57.340> cameras<00:03:57.820> are<00:03:57.970> and<00:03:58.180> a

00:03:58.199 --> 00:03:58.209 
ground where all the cameras are and a

00:03:58.209 --> 00:03:59.910 
ground where all the cameras are and a
lot<00:03:58.360> of<00:03:58.390> the<00:03:58.570> media<00:03:58.750> standing<00:03:59.320> there<00:03:59.709> was<00:03:59.890> a

00:03:59.910 --> 00:03:59.920 
lot of the media standing there was a

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:02.039 
lot of the media standing there was a
slight<00:04:00.459> vibration<00:04:00.700> but<00:04:01.299> it<00:04:01.360> certainly<00:04:01.630> wasn't

00:04:02.039 --> 00:04:02.049 
slight vibration but it certainly wasn't

00:04:02.049 --> 00:04:04.110 
slight vibration but it certainly wasn't
what<00:04:02.410> I<00:04:02.440> thought<00:04:02.560> it<00:04:03.010> would<00:04:03.130> be<00:04:03.370> I<00:04:03.610> don't<00:04:03.850> know

00:04:04.110 --> 00:04:04.120 
what I thought it would be I don't know

00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:06.630 
what I thought it would be I don't know
the<00:04:04.329> reason<00:04:04.690> for<00:04:04.720> it<00:04:04.989> but<00:04:05.650> uh<00:04:05.680> it<00:04:06.220> wasn't

00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:06.640 
the reason for it but uh it wasn't

00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:08.430 
the reason for it but uh it wasn't
anything<00:04:06.850> dramatic<00:04:07.180> I'll<00:04:07.810> tell<00:04:08.049> you<00:04:08.170> one<00:04:08.350> of

00:04:12.449 --> 00:04:12.459

of<00:04:12.610> a<00:04:13.030> Veterans<00:04:13.630> Stadium<00:04:13.720> that<00:04:14.019> did<00:04:14.350> not<00:04:14.500> fall

00:04:14.819 --> 00:04:14.829 
of a Veterans Stadium that did not fall

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:18.060 
of a Veterans Stadium that did not fall
immediately<00:04:15.699> as<00:04:15.910> the<00:04:16.690> columns<00:04:17.169> went<00:04:17.440> down<00:04:17.709> and

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:18.070 
immediately as the columns went down and

00:04:18.070 --> 00:04:20.009 
immediately as the columns went down and
when<00:04:18.609> it<00:04:18.760> finally<00:04:19.030> did<00:04:19.449> fall

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:20.019 
when it finally did fall

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:21.749 
when it finally did fall
there<00:04:20.380> was<00:04:20.560> a<00:04:20.590> cheer<00:04:20.949> in<00:04:21.099> the<00:04:21.160> crowd<00:04:21.400> almost

00:04:21.749 --> 00:04:21.759 
there was a cheer in the crowd almost

00:04:21.759 --> 00:04:24.120 
there was a cheer in the crowd almost
like<00:04:21.940> a<00:04:21.970> sarcastic<00:04:22.479> cheer<00:04:23.020> as<00:04:23.229> if<00:04:23.650> people<00:04:23.860> were

00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:24.130 
like a sarcastic cheer as if people were

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:26.670 
like a sarcastic cheer as if people were
expecting<00:04:24.669> it<00:04:24.789> not<00:04:24.819> to<00:04:25.240> fall<00:04:25.509> but<00:04:26.110> I<00:04:26.349> guess

00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:26.680 
expecting it not to fall but I guess

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:28.800 
expecting it not to fall but I guess
they<00:04:26.860> did<00:04:27.039> their<00:04:27.190> jobs<00:04:27.520> from<00:04:27.849> from<00:04:28.210> my<00:04:28.389> vantage

believe<00:04:43.930> that<00:04:44.319> actually<00:04:44.500> took<00:04:44.860> 62.5<00:04:45.819> seconds

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:46.360 
believe that actually took 62.5 seconds

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:48.300 
believe that actually took 62.5 seconds
so<00:04:46.479> that<00:04:46.720> was<00:04:47.229> a<00:04:47.259> problem<00:04:47.560> little<00:04:47.919> picky

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:48.310 
so that was a problem little picky

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:52.020 
so that was a problem little picky

seems<00:05:08.860> to<00:05:09.009> be<00:05:09.159> clearing<00:05:09.639> out<00:05:09.880> a<00:05:09.909> lot<00:05:10.270> quicker

00:05:10.529 --> 00:05:10.539

than I thought it would have you know

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:13.589 
than I thought it would have you know
because<00:05:12.520> they<00:05:12.639> were<00:05:12.729> talking<00:05:12.970> about<00:05:13.150> talking
