00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:04.589
 very good to all people how are they today 

00:00:02.969 --> 00:00:07.370
 let's talk about a very special theme 

00:00:04.589 --> 00:00:10.110
 and that asked me a lot of people to search 

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:12.000
 skating kayte or remove or as you want 

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.620
 calling it is one of the most 

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.330
 important that we're going to have to 

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:17.400
 master to strengthen our 

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:18.960
 individual skill this technique is very 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.609
 important at the time of the phase of 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.289
 lines when you have to form as well 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:24.090
 also the team fight to improve 

00:00:22.289 --> 00:00:26.429
 our performance in terms of damage 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.019
 generally and kayte or more recognized 

00:00:26.429 --> 00:00:30.090
 as one of the bases of any of 

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:32.040
 be decent but it really works with 

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.380
 each and every one of the champions and the 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.360
 roles this technique is based on canceling 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.460
 the end of the animation of our car 

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:40.890
 attack once the projectile has already left 

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:42.810
 for without moving and re-attaching another 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:44.760
 auto attack in this way we will be 

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:47.010
 getting many advantages first that 

00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:48.960
 nothing will be moving between basic 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:51.600
 and basic what will give us a 

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:53.490
 extremely useful versatility either 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.930
 when it comes to perceiving a champion like 

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:57.240
 moving away from him hurting him 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.860
 while we go back seconds and what 

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:00.780
 we execute correctly we are 

00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:02.550
 reducing the time between auto attack and 

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:04.199
 auto attack therefore of some 

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.500
 way we are improving our 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:07.360
 attack speed 

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.160
 and as I said earlier we are going to 

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:11.140
 improve the performance of our damage 

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:13.180
 This technique can be carried out 

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:15.160
 two ways the first my favorite is 

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:17.440
 with our desired and beautiful key 

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:19.030
 our will be our best friend 

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:20.590
 here and we will have to 

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:22.660
 put it well if we want to improve 

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:24.250
 our kayte or this beautiful key we 

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:26.680
 grants a new pointer that makes 

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:28.720
 we have less more click and also if it is 

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:30.300
 properly configured we can see 

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:32.290
 the range of our basic attack 

00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:34.000
 first of all what we are going to do is 

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:35.950
 go to the game settings to 

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.350
 interface and there mark the option that says 

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:39.880
 show you the range of auto attacks from 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:41.740
 this way when we press the key 

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:44.229
 let's see the range of our attack 

00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.970
 basic that is extremely useful to the 

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:47.259
 time to get used to our range 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:49.270
 of attack since this is going to 

00:01:47.259 --> 00:01:51.190
 provide a very much perspective 

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:52.750
 better when it comes to online suits to 

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:54.460
 the time to know how much we have to 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:56.110
 approach to hitting and well as 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:56.890
 always be at the limit of our 

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:58.450
 basic attack 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:01:59.649
 well now that we know the range of 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:01.479
 our basic attack is that 

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:03.610
 get used to removing and there are two 

00:02:01.479 --> 00:02:05.890
 ways to do it the easiest is 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:08.259
 touching it and left click on the ground 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:09.910
 with this we're going to get our 

00:02:08.259 --> 00:02:11.490
 champion attack as close as he has 

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:14.370
 within its range up 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:17.250
 target marked then if we move 

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:19.050
 we touch the initiate next to us and 

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:20.730
 we move again we are going to hit what 

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:22.440
 that we have closer this serves to 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.700
 when we are surrounded in fights and 

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.230
 we have to run while you 

00:02:23.700 --> 00:02:27.270
 we hit whatever chases us 

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:28.500
 as well as when we are forming 

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:30.390
 and we want to hit the child though 

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.950
 we have closer the second way that 

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:33.990
 we have with the anh is to use it 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:35.760
 clicking on the mignon or 

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:37.650
 enemy champion we want to hit him 

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:39.330
 it is much easier to use than 

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.340
 right click since the pointer changes and 

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:43.080
 this gives us greater clarity to the 

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.090
 time to see who we select and for 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:46.920
 so perform less more click the 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.990
 second way to perform the search is 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.760
 using the shift by increasing a key 

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:52.140
 to replace this so that it does 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.390
 the shift while we maintain it 

00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:56.250
 pressed and we click right is going to 

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:58.440
 mean the same as we squeeze the aie 

00:02:56.250 --> 00:03:00.060
 let's left click just just 

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:02.130
 The same procedure replaces the 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:03.990
 same step right click we keep 

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:05.670
 tight shift right click for the 

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:07.050
 move right click to move and so 

00:03:05.670 --> 00:03:08.790
 successively as they see on screen 

00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:10.500
 either of these two options is 

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:13.290
 viable and varies depending on our 

00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:15.660
 comfort for me for my taste is a thousand 

00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:17.069
 times better the one that shows the range 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:19.230
 of our auto attack and that 

00:03:17.069 --> 00:03:21.239
 very useful more than anything for when not 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:23.249
 you're one hundred used to the champion that 

00:03:21.239 --> 00:03:24.780
 you are using and to the range of your car 

00:03:23.249 --> 00:03:26.340
 attack you have to keep in mind that this 

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:27.629
 technique is not going to leave us for a day to 

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.760
 another one so we're going to have to 

00:03:27.629 --> 00:03:31.319
 practice it and a lot to start 

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.999
 be effective that when we achieve it 

00:03:31.319 --> 00:03:36.030
 we are going to notice changes really 

00:03:32.999 --> 00:03:37.980
 significant in short people that was all 

00:03:36.030 --> 00:03:39.329
 for today I hope you liked it as 

00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:41.459
 I always say thank you very much to 

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:43.139
 all to see if you have any ideas for 

00:03:41.459 --> 00:03:44.639
 the following two tips with also read 

00:03:43.139 --> 00:03:47.430
 I always comments on 

00:03:44.639 --> 00:03:49.200
 account so if you liked it or you thought 

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:51.060
 useful to share it is the best you can 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:53.489
 do so more people are finding out about 

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:55.560
 all these things and also if what 

00:03:53.489 --> 00:03:57.239
 you make of my social networks that are in 

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:58.829
 the description you will be able to get a 

00:03:57.239 --> 00:04:01.199
 my greeting at the end of some videos 

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:04.770
 so nothing people i am red me 

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:07.530
 dismissal and see you until the next 

00:04:04.770 --> 00:04:11.640
 which is extremely useful now to the 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:14.390
 hour that is extremely useful 

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:14.390
 they pick up
