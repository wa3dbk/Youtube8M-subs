00:00:22.609 --> 00:00:25.189 
bring it these type of questions and
this<00:00:23.609> could<00:00:23.939> turn<00:00:24.090> into<00:00:24.150> a<00:00:24.359> miniseries<00:00:24.660> I'm

00:00:25.189 --> 00:00:25.199 
this could turn into a miniseries I'm

00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:28.099 
this could turn into a miniseries I'm
not<00:00:25.439> sure<00:00:26.150> possibly<00:00:27.150> we'll<00:00:27.300> do<00:00:27.420> one<00:00:27.630> on<00:00:27.869> the

00:00:28.099 --> 00:00:28.109 
not sure possibly we'll do one on the

00:00:28.109 --> 00:00:31.160 
not sure possibly we'll do one on the
taste<00:00:28.670> and<00:00:29.670> then<00:00:29.820> maybe<00:00:30.179> even<00:00:30.449> the<00:00:30.689> earthquake

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
taste and then maybe even the earthquake

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.440 
taste and then maybe even the earthquake
if<00:00:31.500> if<00:00:31.890> and<00:00:32.250> when<00:00:32.399> they<00:00:32.579> use<00:00:32.790> this<00:00:32.969> found<00:00:33.210> for

if if and when they use this found for

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:37.910 
if if and when they use this found for
that<00:00:33.600> um<00:00:34.910> but<00:00:35.910> for<00:00:36.120> poison<00:00:36.750> pretty<00:00:37.620> much

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:37.920 
that um but for poison pretty much

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:40.270 
that um but for poison pretty much
universally<00:00:38.879> we're<00:00:39.120> seeing<00:00:39.390> it<00:00:39.570> brought

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:40.280 
universally we're seeing it brought

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:44.330 
universally we're seeing it brought
regardless<00:00:41.280> of<00:00:41.399> the<00:00:41.520> attack<00:00:41.820> style<00:00:42.149> um<00:00:43.340> haste

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 
regardless of the attack style um haste

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.880 
regardless of the attack style um haste
is<00:00:44.579> not<00:00:44.760> being<00:00:45.030> as<00:00:45.239> used<00:00:45.570> as<00:00:45.750> much<00:00:46.620> as<00:00:46.800> I

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
is not being as used as much as I

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:48.500 
is not being as used as much as I
thought<00:00:47.190> it<00:00:47.340> would<00:00:47.579> and<00:00:47.610> maybe<00:00:48.059> it's<00:00:48.270> just<00:00:48.420> a

00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:48.510 
thought it would and maybe it's just a

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:50.330 
thought it would and maybe it's just a
lot<00:00:48.629> of<00:00:48.690> people<00:00:48.870> don't<00:00:49.020> quite<00:00:49.170> have<00:00:49.469> it<00:00:49.620> yet<00:00:49.829> it

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:50.340 
lot of people don't quite have it yet it

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.540 
lot of people don't quite have it yet it
been<00:00:50.579> the<00:00:50.700> last<00:00:50.910> spell<00:00:51.149> you<00:00:51.300> get<00:00:51.570> but<00:00:52.289> I<00:00:53.070> did

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
been the last spell you get but I did

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:57.590 
been the last spell you get but I did
try<00:00:53.820> it<00:00:53.879> with<00:00:54.210> a<00:00:54.239> lull<00:00:54.809> in<00:00:54.840> attack<00:00:55.199> and<00:00:55.699> it<00:00:56.699> did

00:00:57.590 --> 00:00:57.600 
try it with a lull in attack and it did

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:00.020 
try it with a lull in attack and it did
not<00:00:57.780> work<00:00:58.050> the<00:00:58.079> way<00:00:58.260> I<00:00:58.379> thought<00:00:58.710> it<00:00:58.770> would<00:00:59.070> but

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
not work the way I thought it would but

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.279 
not work the way I thought it would but
that's<00:01:00.149> a<00:01:00.300> that's<00:01:00.539> topic<00:01:00.899> for<00:01:00.989> another<00:01:01.079> video

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
that's a that's topic for another video

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:03.139 
that's a that's topic for another video
we<00:01:01.590> will<00:01:01.739> discuss<00:01:02.100> that<00:01:02.129> I'll<00:01:02.399> probably<00:01:02.699> do

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:03.149 
we will discuss that I'll probably do

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:04.850 
we will discuss that I'll probably do
one<00:01:03.359> on<00:01:03.510> haste<00:01:03.750> but<00:01:03.989> this<00:01:04.110> one's<00:01:04.260> on<00:01:04.409> poison

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
one on haste but this one's on poison

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:06.890 
one on haste but this one's on poison
and<00:01:05.640> I'm<00:01:05.790> seeing<00:01:06.060> it<00:01:06.210> brought<00:01:06.390> pretty<00:01:06.720> much

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:06.900 
and I'm seeing it brought pretty much

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.190 
and I'm seeing it brought pretty much
every<00:01:07.380> attack<00:01:07.710> and<00:01:08.570> you<00:01:09.570> know<00:01:09.689> the<00:01:09.840> obvious

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
every attack and you know the obvious

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.420 
every attack and you know the obvious
question<00:01:10.560> what<00:01:10.710> we<00:01:10.860> thought<00:01:11.070> would<00:01:11.250> happen

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:11.430 
question what we thought would happen

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.969 
question what we thought would happen
immediately<00:01:12.060> is<00:01:12.630> that<00:01:12.990> every<00:01:13.439> plan<00:01:13.710> would

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979 
immediately is that every plan would

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.820 
immediately is that every plan would
switch<00:01:14.220> over<00:01:14.430> to<00:01:14.720> using<00:01:15.720> high<00:01:16.170> HP<00:01:16.380> troops

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:16.830 
switch over to using high HP troops

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.249 
switch over to using high HP troops
troops<00:01:17.400> that<00:01:17.610> the<00:01:18.479> poisons<00:01:18.869> not<00:01:18.960> going<00:01:19.200> to

00:01:19.249 --> 00:01:19.259 
troops that the poisons not going to

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:20.929 
troops that the poisons not going to
take<00:01:19.439> out<00:01:19.619> and<00:01:19.890> you<00:01:20.280> know<00:01:20.369> this<00:01:20.490> fellow<00:01:20.700> alone

00:01:20.929 --> 00:01:20.939 
take out and you know this fellow alone

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:23.060 
take out and you know this fellow alone
will<00:01:21.119> not<00:01:21.240> take<00:01:21.420> it<00:01:21.450> out<00:01:21.600> and<00:01:21.900> that's<00:01:22.860> just

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
will not take it out and that's just

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:25.219 
will not take it out and that's just
simply<00:01:23.280> not<00:01:23.640> been<00:01:23.850> what<00:01:24.030> we've<00:01:24.150> ran<00:01:24.360> into

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229 
simply not been what we've ran into

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.310 
simply not been what we've ran into
in<00:01:25.470> fact<00:01:25.830> most<00:01:26.549> every<00:01:27.479> attack<00:01:27.810> they<00:01:28.080> still

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
in fact most every attack they still

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.630 
in fact most every attack they still
have<00:01:28.470> archers<00:01:28.829> they<00:01:28.950> still<00:01:29.130> have<00:01:29.250> wizards

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640 
have archers they still have wizards

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.190 
have archers they still have wizards
which<00:01:30.090> is<00:01:30.299> things<00:01:30.570> like<00:01:30.750> that<00:01:30.930> that<00:01:31.079> the

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
which is things like that that the

which is things like that that the
poison<00:01:31.740> spell<00:01:31.950> is<00:01:32.130> tremendously<00:01:33.000> effective

poison spell is tremendously effective

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.450 
poison spell is tremendously effective
against<00:01:34.350> if<00:01:34.439> you'll<00:01:34.590> you<00:01:35.040> know<00:01:35.159> you<00:01:35.220> don't

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:00.060 
question was brought up about when they

00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:02.060 
question was brought up about when they
do<00:02:00.119> with<00:02:00.630> link<00:02:00.840> Lance<00:02:01.049> insulin<00:02:01.530> it's<00:02:01.740> going<00:02:01.979> to

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
do with link Lance insulin it's going to

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:04.130 
do with link Lance insulin it's going to
happen<00:02:02.250> the<00:02:02.909> shift<00:02:03.210> will<00:02:03.450> take<00:02:03.630> I<00:02:03.750> guess<00:02:03.930> it'll

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:04.140 
happen the shift will take I guess it'll

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:06.230 
happen the shift will take I guess it'll
trickle<00:02:04.380> down<00:02:04.560> if<00:02:05.490> you're<00:02:05.640> in<00:02:05.729> a<00:02:05.759> high<00:02:05.880> level

00:02:06.230 --> 00:02:06.240 
trickle down if you're in a high level

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.670 
trickle down if you're in a high level
or<00:02:06.360> you're<00:02:06.930> not<00:02:07.049> going<00:02:07.200> to<00:02:07.290> see<00:02:07.439> all<00:02:07.469> that

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:07.680 
or you're not going to see all that

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.499 
or you're not going to see all that
stuff<00:02:07.950> that<00:02:08.280> easy<00:02:08.670> steps<00:02:09.030> take<00:02:09.209> out<00:02:09.360> with<00:02:09.479> a

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509 
stuff that easy steps take out with a

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.660 
stuff that easy steps take out with a
poison<00:02:09.929> in<00:02:10.080> the<00:02:10.200> CC<00:02:10.530> but<00:02:10.739> I<00:02:10.770> still<00:02:11.220> think<00:02:11.520> it's

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:11.670 
poison in the CC but I still think it's

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:12.420 
poison in the CC but I still think it's
worth<00:02:11.849> bringing

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
worth bringing

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:14.369 
worth bringing
and<00:02:13.150> the<00:02:13.239> question<00:02:13.540> arose<00:02:13.780> you<00:02:14.019> know<00:02:14.170> should

00:02:14.379 --> 00:02:18.270 
and the question arose you know should
you<00:02:14.409> go<00:02:14.650> ahead<00:02:14.769> and<00:02:15.040> drop<00:02:15.280> it<00:02:15.489> on<00:02:15.610> the<00:02:17.129> on<00:02:18.129> the

00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:18.280 
you go ahead and drop it on the on the

you go ahead and drop it on the on the
CC<00:02:18.519> troops<00:02:18.670> and<00:02:18.849> just<00:02:18.970> you<00:02:19.120> know<00:02:19.150> give<00:02:19.420> them

skeletons bunching up it again I've seen

00:05:48.700 --> 00:05:50.969 
skeletons bunching up it again I've seen
so<00:05:48.940> many<00:05:49.030> attacks<00:05:49.419> were<00:05:49.630> uh<00:05:49.830> you<00:05:50.830> know<00:05:50.950> a

00:05:50.969 --> 00:05:50.979 
so many attacks were uh you know a

00:05:50.979 --> 00:05:53.339 
so many attacks were uh you know a
skeleton<00:05:51.460> traffic<00:05:51.849> goes<00:05:52.030> to<00:05:52.180> air<00:05:52.300> and<00:05:52.599> those

00:05:53.339 --> 00:05:53.349 
skeleton traffic goes to air and those

00:05:53.349 --> 00:05:55.439 
skeleton traffic goes to air and those
are<00:05:53.470> you<00:05:53.680> know<00:05:53.800> six<00:05:54.130> or<00:05:54.250> seven<00:05:54.520> limbs<00:05:54.729> left<00:05:55.030> but

00:05:55.439 --> 00:05:55.449 
are you know six or seven limbs left but

00:05:55.449 --> 00:05:57.270 
are you know six or seven limbs left but
those<00:05:55.599> skeleton<00:05:56.050> traps<00:05:56.260> just<00:05:56.410> pick<00:05:56.889> a<00:05:56.919> way<00:05:57.130> out

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:57.280 
those skeleton traps just pick a way out

00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:58.950 
those skeleton traps just pick a way out
and<00:05:57.400> pick<00:05:57.580> away<00:05:57.820> at<00:05:57.849> them<00:05:58.090> there's<00:05:58.419> no<00:05:58.660> pup's

00:05:58.950 --> 00:05:58.960 
and pick away at them there's no pup's

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:00.629 
and pick away at them there's no pup's
the<00:05:59.199> Queen's<00:05:59.440> not<00:05:59.590> in<00:05:59.710> the<00:05:59.770> area<00:06:00.099> and<00:06:00.220> it

00:06:00.629 --> 00:06:00.639 
the Queen's not in the area and it

00:06:00.639 --> 00:06:02.310 
the Queen's not in the area and it
pretty<00:06:00.789> much<00:06:00.880> cost<00:06:01.330> someone<00:06:01.720> or<00:06:01.840> three<00:06:02.050> stars

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:02.320 
pretty much cost someone or three stars

00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:04.560 
pretty much cost someone or three stars
so<00:06:02.560> that<00:06:02.800> would<00:06:02.979> be<00:06:03.099> an<00:06:03.220> ideal<00:06:03.699> spot<00:06:04.150> to<00:06:04.300> drop

00:06:04.560 --> 00:06:04.570 
so that would be an ideal spot to drop

00:06:04.570 --> 00:06:07.170 
so that would be an ideal spot to drop
that<00:06:04.750> the<00:06:05.289> spelt<00:06:05.650> that<00:06:05.889> a<00:06:06.070> poison<00:06:06.430> spell<00:06:06.610> being

mean that's awesome you can wipe out all
those<00:06:10.870> air<00:06:11.080> skeletons<00:06:11.590> in<00:06:11.770> just<00:06:12.099> a<00:06:12.220> few

00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:12.370 
those air skeletons in just a few

00:06:12.370 --> 00:06:14.040 
those air skeletons in just a few
seconds<00:06:12.699> again<00:06:12.910> they<00:06:13.000> have<00:06:13.120> so<00:06:13.449> little<00:06:13.720> of<00:06:13.900> hit

see what they're set to if if you can
see<00:06:29.440> but<00:06:30.400> you<00:06:30.430> know<00:06:30.639> even<00:06:30.820> if<00:06:31.060> the<00:06:31.210> attack<00:06:31.539> was

00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:31.870 
see but you know even if the attack was

00:06:31.870 --> 00:06:33.870 
see but you know even if the attack was
a<00:06:31.900> failure<00:06:32.260> a<00:06:32.590> lot<00:06:32.770> of<00:06:32.860> times<00:06:33.039> you<00:06:33.669> know<00:06:33.789> if

00:06:33.870 --> 00:06:33.880 
a failure a lot of times you know if

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:35.100 
a failure a lot of times you know if
you're<00:06:34.000> bringing<00:06:34.270> a<00:06:34.330> hog<00:06:34.630> attack<00:06:34.780> and<00:06:35.050> you

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:35.110 
you're bringing a hog attack and you

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:36.810 
you're bringing a hog attack and you
just<00:06:35.200> didn't<00:06:35.469> see<00:06:35.560> any<00:06:35.740> skeletons<00:06:36.190> the

00:06:36.810 --> 00:06:36.820 
just didn't see any skeletons the

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:38.210 
just didn't see any skeletons the
skeletons<00:06:37.300> were<00:06:37.360> probably<00:06:37.659> set

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:38.220 
skeletons were probably set

00:06:38.220 --> 00:06:40.220 
skeletons were probably set
air<00:06:38.310> so<00:06:38.490> that<00:06:38.640> tips<00:06:38.880> you<00:06:39.030> off<00:06:39.210> to<00:06:39.360> that<00:06:39.510> I'll<00:06:39.960> be

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:41.760 
sure and check it on the replays when

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:43.760 
sure and check it on the replays when
you're<00:06:41.880> going<00:06:42.030> in<00:06:42.300> I<00:06:42.540> think<00:06:43.470> this<00:06:43.620> will

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:43.770 
you're going in I think this will

00:06:43.770 --> 00:06:47.030 
you're going in I think this will
absolutely<00:06:44.630> give<00:06:45.630> you<00:06:45.750> more<00:06:45.990> three<00:06:46.230> stars<00:06:46.500> the

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:47.040 
absolutely give you more three stars the

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:48.560 
absolutely give you more three stars the
the<00:06:47.310> fact<00:06:47.550> that<00:06:47.670> you're<00:06:48.150> going<00:06:48.300> to<00:06:48.360> get

00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:48.570 
the fact that you're going to get

00:06:48.570 --> 00:06:51.290 
the fact that you're going to get
something<00:06:49.110> out<00:06:49.260> of<00:06:49.350> that<00:06:49.500> poison<00:06:49.980> spell<00:06:50.300> no

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:51.300 
something out of that poison spell no

00:06:51.300 --> 00:06:52.820 
something out of that poison spell no
matter<00:06:51.510> which<00:06:51.720> way<00:06:51.900> you<00:06:51.960> slice<00:06:52.200> it<00:06:52.350> if<00:06:52.680> you

00:06:52.820 --> 00:06:52.830 
matter which way you slice it if you

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:55.070 
matter which way you slice it if you
take<00:06:53.070> this<00:06:53.250> approach<00:06:53.430> I<00:06:54.210> think<00:06:54.570> it's<00:06:54.930> really

00:06:55.070 --> 00:06:55.080 
take this approach I think it's really

00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:56.150 
take this approach I think it's really
going<00:06:55.260> to<00:06:55.350> help<00:06:55.470> a<00:06:55.530> lot<00:06:55.650> of<00:06:55.680> people<00:06:55.800> because

00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:56.160
