00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:16.610
 and what's up everyone welcome on 

00:00:14.750 --> 00:00:18.830
 this pod video I hope you 

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:20.689
 be okay you know it's friday 

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:22.340
 and Friday is day two 

00:00:20.689 --> 00:00:24.680
 measures so who finds himself at the tower 

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:25.910
 all right at the bottom of the shed at the 

00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:27.619
 potatoes we do not waste time 

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:30.200
 go see what they live it's gone 

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:32.090
 so already sells two new 

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:33.500
 last dlc equipment so a 

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:35.690
 headphones and a torso we will come back on 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.399
 after that, let's go 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:39.230
 will start with the titan's helmet 

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:41.719
 eternal warrior that gears proposes 

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:43.699
 against 13 strange piece with 69 

00:00:41.719 --> 00:00:45.320
 of intelligence and 58 of discipline that's 

00:00:43.699 --> 00:00:46.820
 not bad but you can taste 

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.320
 this helmet with much more stadiums 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:49.519
 important than this one but really he 

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:51.199
 is not bad like that already 

00:00:49.519 --> 00:00:52.969
 so the energy gain of your super 

00:00:51.199 --> 00:00:54.649
 is improved in case of frags on 

00:00:52.969 --> 00:00:56.989
 targets that are not guardians a 

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:58.370
 stat rather geared towards the pve you 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:01:00.379
 recover life points that you 

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:01.820
 pick up an orb and finally the effects of 

00:01:00.379 --> 00:01:03.920
 boldness adds to london 

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:05.659
 devastating then there really is 

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:07.190
 really a very very good ability 

00:01:05.659 --> 00:01:08.270
 simply because that's me 

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:09.710
 play a lot titan right now i'm going 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:10.400
 show you a little bit you see 

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:12.950
 that in fact you go to your home 

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.060
 boldness and the cost of the poles the cost 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:16.040
 poles that is a very very good 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:17.780
 attack that allows date so roughly from 

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:19.190
 one shot with your melee attack and 

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:20.510
 you have boldness that give you 

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:22.550
 a lot more armor when you 

00:01:20.510 --> 00:01:24.410
 swing your super on the enemies and 

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:26.060
 it's true that in titans we can die 

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:27.680
 quite quickly that we send the super 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:28.940
 and that boldness is really very 

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:31.160
 quickly i play a lot with can 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:32.720
 you say it boldness and really has 

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:33.470
 really an important role a can be 

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:35.000
 in this doctrine 

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:37.460
 so in fact break up lets you all 

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.600
 simply to have boldness and therefore 

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:40.310
 to be able to keep shoulders elbows 

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.500
 it's a very good case that allows you to 

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:44.780
 here is really to be able to keep 

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.860
 two and I really like this helmet in 

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.300
 do I have all the time with really 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:49.460
 I recommend it for lydie time 

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:51.530
 to buy this helmet then for the 

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:53.300
 hunters so the alpa crest the upi 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:55.310
 a wrong is always against 13 piece 

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:57.290
 strange with a lot of force so who 

00:01:55.310 --> 00:01:59.180
 allows to revive the allies more 

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:01.850
 quickly and to bring up 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:03.380
 very very very very very very very 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:05.240
 good abilities forgiveness for osiris 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.800
 increases the ammunition capacity of 

00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:08.509
 weapons and special increases the capacity in 

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.860
 ammunition revolvers we will not get 

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:10.879
 lie one day out of two who plays 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.260
 to the thistle there are many people who 

00:02:10.879 --> 00:02:14.030
 played last words to black raptors 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:16.730
 you have to have more ammo thanks 

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:17.959
 at this torso and of course for the snipers 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:19.159
 shotguns and fusions 

00:02:17.959 --> 00:02:21.079
 also so it's really a very 

00:02:19.159 --> 00:02:22.719
 good time damage he has that strength 

00:02:21.079 --> 00:02:24.590
 would have been very useful and a little bit of 

00:02:22.719 --> 00:02:25.909
 of intelligence and discipline as we 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:27.109
 see it there is pretty much already 

00:02:25.909 --> 00:02:29.359
 frankly I advise you to 

00:02:27.109 --> 00:02:31.189
 osiris then there is the bure of 

00:02:29.359 --> 00:02:32.749
 purifier so always against 13 

00:02:31.189 --> 00:02:33.950
 strange piece so this one I have him 

00:02:32.749 --> 00:02:36.109
 bought I did not have I'm rather 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:38.599
 glad to have found with 85 of 

00:02:36.109 --> 00:02:42.200
 discipline and 79 of strength so really 

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:44.420
 intense with which one must play in 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.159
 radiance with the solar doctrine of 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:48.290
 the organist so if you activate your 

00:02:46.159 --> 00:02:49.219
 alliance being dead that lice 

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:51.379
 are the close enemies 

00:02:49.219 --> 00:02:53.989
 basically it's the same effect as the 

00:02:51.379 --> 00:02:55.489
 114's helmet with titan's bubble 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:57.079
 will dazzle the enemies that's it 

00:02:55.489 --> 00:02:58.549
 gets you out of it and out of 

00:02:57.079 --> 00:03:00.139
 example in osiris to revive them your 

00:02:58.549 --> 00:03:00.799
 allies so it's rather a very good 

00:03:00.139 --> 00:03:02.620
 capacity 

00:03:00.799 --> 00:03:04.670
 it allows to inflict forgiveness of 

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:06.230
 reduce the recovery time of the 

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:07.639
 melee attack that is inflicted on 

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:09.950
 damage using the grenade and to 

00:03:07.639 --> 00:03:11.299
 inversely it allows to recover more 

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:13.219
 quickly the grenade when inflicted 

00:03:11.299 --> 00:03:14.450
 damage with attak 2 but here they are 

00:03:13.219 --> 00:03:14.900
 it is rather a very good time this month 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:16.609
 I will buy 

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:18.290
 I will improve in the next 

00:03:16.609 --> 00:03:19.879
 days people offers us this 

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:21.799
 week the plan refused to merge 

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:23.659
 contradicts this strange piece really 

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:24.590
 I think for those playing in 

00:03:23.659 --> 00:03:26.510
 pvp they know him 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:27.560
 I often kill myself by the plan 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:29.870
 that's what he's really fearsome 

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:31.189
 and now I have trouble with guns 

00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:32.719
 fusion I have trouble adapting to 

00:03:31.189 --> 00:03:34.129
 rifle fusion in pvp 

00:03:32.719 --> 00:03:35.810
 but that's what they really 

00:03:34.129 --> 00:03:37.129
 master these weapons it's really a 

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:38.569
 devastating weapon in pvp 

00:03:37.129 --> 00:03:40.099
 and that's it for the collection I you 

00:03:38.569 --> 00:03:41.810
 always really advise to buy it 

00:03:40.099 --> 00:03:43.549
 as usual the exotic brilliance 

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:45.349
 against this strange piece a year g 

00:03:43.549 --> 00:03:46.849
 exotic against 23 particles of 

00:03:45.349 --> 00:03:47.779
 light for those who do not have enough 

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:51.290
 of jobs they are in my chest 

00:03:47.779 --> 00:03:53.389
 but you can trade here so the 

00:03:51.290 --> 00:03:54.620
 strange pieces against particles a 

00:03:53.389 --> 00:03:57.019
 so two strange pieces against a 

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:58.249
 particle one always have to know it or 

00:03:57.019 --> 00:04:00.290
 to improve this week a lot 

00:03:58.249 --> 00:04:02.510
 faster the rifles pulse the 

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:03.829
 melting rifles and machine guns 

00:04:02.510 --> 00:04:05.959
 so of course for those who take the 

00:04:03.829 --> 00:04:08.180
 plan c do not hesitate to take the small 

00:04:05.959 --> 00:04:09.319
 telemetry that goes well and here you are 

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:11.299
 know that you can improve too 

00:04:09.319 --> 00:04:13.279
 so the sparrows I do them already 

00:04:11.299 --> 00:04:15.379
 with a big sparrow need to buy 

00:04:13.279 --> 00:04:17.180
 a pass too rare a blue passerine is 

00:04:15.379 --> 00:04:18.620
 so at the forefront and you 

00:04:17.180 --> 00:04:20.959
 improve or turn it into legendary 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:22.070
 and a fox that will be faster than 

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:24.350
 sparrow 

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:25.610
 raids makes it the only thing that's 

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:27.680
 that he will not have the little boost with the 

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:29.180
 trigger r 2 where I believe that crb on 

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:30.950
 xbox here he will not have the little boost 

00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:32.510
 so he will not have the speed boost 

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:33.860
 on the other hand it will be less fast but 

00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:36.140
 in pure speed is faster than a 

00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:37.340
 sparrow and as usual 

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:39.320
 for what ammunition they have 

00:04:37.340 --> 00:04:41.330
 had not gone measures five 

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:42.980
 cartridges against a strange coin 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:44.150
 I hope you enjoyed this video 

00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:46.070
 I hope that the inventory of measures 

00:04:44.150 --> 00:04:47.180
 you liked the pals I tell you to very 

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:48.890
 soon take care of yourself and do not hesitate 

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:51.970
 not to like the video as usual 

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:51.970
 you gets off worse
