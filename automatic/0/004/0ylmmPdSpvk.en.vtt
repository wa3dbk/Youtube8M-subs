00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:01.020 
go back to that later position you're

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.029 
go back to that later position you're
going<00:02:01.049> to<00:02:01.200> want<00:02:01.289> to<00:02:01.350> set<00:02:01.530> it<00:02:01.619> to<00:02:01.740> the<00:02:01.860> bottom

00:02:02.029 --> 00:02:02.039 
going to want to set it to the bottom

00:02:02.039 --> 00:02:05.149 
going to want to set it to the bottom
because<00:02:02.729> that's<00:02:02.939> where<00:02:03.420> default<00:02:04.110> the<00:02:04.530> mac<00:02:04.950> one

00:02:05.149 --> 00:02:05.159 
because that's where default the mac one

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:08.660 
because that's where default the mac one
is<00:02:06.439> style<00:02:07.439> we<00:02:07.890> just<00:02:08.069> want<00:02:08.220> to<00:02:08.280> change<00:02:08.519> the

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:08.670 
is style we just want to change the

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.610 
is style we just want to change the
outline<00:02:09.060> color<00:02:09.360> of<00:02:09.630> the<00:02:10.380> labels<00:02:11.220> to<00:02:12.150> white

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:12.620 
outline color of the labels to white

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:18.559 
outline color of the labels to white
you'll<00:02:13.620> see<00:02:13.799> why<00:02:13.980> later<00:02:16.340> behavior<00:02:17.340> I<00:02:17.610> think<00:02:18.390> we

00:02:18.559 --> 00:02:18.569 
you'll see why later behavior I think we

00:02:18.569 --> 00:02:20.479 
you'll see why later behavior I think we
don't<00:02:18.660> need<00:02:18.780> to<00:02:18.870> do<00:02:18.930> anything<00:02:19.110> there<00:02:19.489> just

00:02:20.479 --> 00:02:20.489 
don't need to do anything there just

00:02:20.489 --> 00:02:22.340 
don't need to do anything there just
click<00:02:20.760> ok<00:02:20.970> and<00:02:21.330> that's<00:02:21.959> the<00:02:22.080> basic

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.350 
click ok and that's the basic

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:25.789 
click ok and that's the basic
configuration<00:02:22.799> done<00:02:23.750> this<00:02:24.750> is<00:02:24.959> where<00:02:25.140> your<00:02:25.290> PC
