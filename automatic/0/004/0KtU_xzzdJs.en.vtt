00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.680
 when I finished reading the night or 

00:00:01.890 --> 00:00:07.830
 versed those left behind as the 

00:00:04.680 --> 00:00:11.010
 Original title here in Brazil I went 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:13.530
 running on facebook and I said I could 

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:16.109
 I do not know what to think, I do not know what to feel. 

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.580
 I even understand he got a little friends 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:20.400
 and there were people who thought I loved the 

00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:22.140
 book are people that his future I 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.830
 I do not think either to the side or the 

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.380
 other 

00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:27.449
 It's true that I loved the show that was 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:30.060
 originated from this craft book 

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:34.050
 is also critical of the entire season 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:37.710
 of maximum grade and center but I fear that 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:40.200
 the narrative of perrotta tone is not so 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:42.500
 sharp as that of her relative on TV. 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:42.500
 cable 

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:51.450
 I can not be unfair because the 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.820
 premise is all here 

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:56.340
 three years have passed since a 

00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.580
 terrible incident happened 

00:00:56.340 --> 00:01:00.750
 many people simply 

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:02.160
 They disappeared because it's here. 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.970
 talking to the dependent person 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.190
 booth 

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:07.320
 I'm here to record a video is puff 

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:09.000
 this very crazy person and think it was 

00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:11.950
 a special effect but not me 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.409
 simply disappears 

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:19.509
 and this is very heavy when it happens 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:22.369
 with people you love then a 

00:01:19.509 --> 00:01:23.929
 seriado and the book treatment on mourning 

00:01:22.369 --> 00:01:25.729
 and we will follow up with 

00:01:23.929 --> 00:01:26.600
 characters mainly from the family 

00:01:25.729 --> 00:01:29.240
 gave 

00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.880
 but finally several characters that are 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:34.189
 going through a very deep mourning that 

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:36.979
 It is different even in everything from 

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:38.959
 who lost someone who died but someone 

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:40.280
 who disappeared to speak a little more 

00:01:38.959 --> 00:01:41.329
 about this soon 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:44.360
 the narrative is mainly 

00:01:41.329 --> 00:01:46.159
 inside the fictional city of 6 bolton 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:48.739
 but you can see that the effect was very 

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:50.840
 similar across the planet 

00:01:48.739 --> 00:01:53.479
 so while several people call the 

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:57.649
 sudden departure event does not face 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:59.360
 as a mysterious disappearance and that 

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:00.500
 There are no explanations. 

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:04.700
 scientific 

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:06.619
 many people ignore sins in the 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:08.780
 Europe up in quotation marks because it is not a 

00:02:06.619 --> 00:02:10.489
 Christian design but not 

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:12.500
 but even in the eyes of religions 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:15.230
 many people who have disappeared 

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:17.180
 they were sinners and yet many 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:19.370
 people believe that it was the 

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:21.650
 rapture then they end up 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:24.380
 uniting the various services have cost to 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:26.510
 everyone in here but these 

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:29.120
 people who join these services these 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:30.739
 people who are very religious and who 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:33.980
 with their unshakeable faith believe that 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:35.620
 were abandoned by God so light 

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:40.040
 rain we 're left behind 

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:41.989
 abandoned the rest is seen within the 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:44.209
 narrative in different ways 

00:02:41.989 --> 00:02:47.359
 there are nuances of this narrative 

00:02:44.209 --> 00:02:50.090
 respect but unfortunately here in the book 

00:02:47.359 --> 00:02:52.940
 and this was not very well explored by 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:54.980
 example and review the mid-edson 

00:02:52.940 --> 00:02:57.500
 his job is basically to print 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:03:00.230
 a newspaper with gossip about the 

00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:02.540
 people who disappeared 

00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:04.250
 so he's going to put the whole guy there 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:07.160
 world is saying that only saints but 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:12.290
 betray woman to another air rapist 

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:13.549
 We stole the ball and here in the 

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:15.500
 contrary to the series that has a 

00:03:13.549 --> 00:03:16.489
 participation more active ie 

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.730
 that he 

00:03:16.489 --> 00:03:23.180
 he served only to tip 

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:24.170
 another character and then 

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:26.870
 he simply 

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:29.599
 appears like the people of whom 

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:30.349
 he says newspaper disappeared on departure 

00:03:29.599 --> 00:03:32.390
 sudden 

00:03:30.349 --> 00:03:34.489
 therefore if the presentation of 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:36.440
 characters is awesome 

00:03:34.489 --> 00:03:39.380
 We can not say the same about your 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:41.630
 development, for example at the time of 

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:45.020
 snack that started as mine 

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:47.510
 favorite characters after 50% of the 

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:50.360
 reading I was no longer able to 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:53.060
 woman're finding unbearable understood 

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:55.519
 and more interesting characters like 

00:03:53.060 --> 00:04:00.080
 own this referendum or else the 

00:03:55.519 --> 00:04:02.330
 brothers cough or even a raul off 9 

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:04.280
 who is mentioned at the beginning of 

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:06.350
 book and earns a fucking importance the 

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:09.620
 beginning of the book takes place in our super 

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:11.720
 Are you going to come back later, not this sometimes? 

00:04:09.620 --> 00:04:14.090
 are no longer mentioned and become more 

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:16.280
 characters than 

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:18.290
 disappeared before the game started 

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:20.900
 meanwhile we accompany the mayor 

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:23.389
 kevin wants a boring moralistic channel 

00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:26.180
 his wife who is a fanatic who 

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:27.710
 It looks cool but at the end of the day it 's 

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:30.590
 just a fan 

00:04:27.710 --> 00:04:33.350
 his daughter who looks like one is revolted 

00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:36.440
 loss but is only a teenager without 

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:38.810
 personality and his son who seems to 

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:41.330
 super cool good people the tourist but not 

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:42.500
 end is just in love and doing all 

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:46.729
 cool things 

00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:49.550
 in the name of this platonic passion 

00:04:46.729 --> 00:04:53.270
 I 'm not here to say that reading is 

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:57.560
 tiring stop or any of that knows 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:05:00.250
 I love the creativity of perrotta tone and 

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:03.169
 I must say that I turned the pages 

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:04.100
 eagerly and finished the book wanting 

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:06.140
 more 

00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:09.020
 only you have to explain maybe the 

00:05:06.140 --> 00:05:10.789
 last reason why I stayed one 

00:05:09.020 --> 00:05:12.669
 little dissatisfied with this end 

00:05:10.789 --> 00:05:16.190
 it is important to know the difference 

00:05:12.669 --> 00:05:18.860
 between history and narrative for example 

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:20.930
 everyone knows, but everyone has 

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:22.370
 harry potter full story 17 

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:24.560
 books we have not 

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:26.960
 it would be very long very tiring even 

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:29.000
 if it were not a children's book in 

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:31.900
 no children's series that 

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:34.909
 people have is the narrative about a young man 

00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:35.960
 surpassing and even avenging even death 

00:05:34.909 --> 00:05:37.129
 from parents 

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:39.949
 said that 

00:05:37.129 --> 00:05:41.599
 the book does not tell the full story 

00:05:39.949 --> 00:05:44.659
 Something we always get 

00:05:41.599 --> 00:05:47.209
 summarized to a narrative that serves to 

00:05:44.659 --> 00:05:49.189
 prove a point or demonstrate a point 

00:05:47.209 --> 00:05:51.860
 anything that is so I want 

00:05:49.189 --> 00:05:54.139
 make it clear that I never wanted to know 

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:56.899
 because I like the sudden departure 

00:05:54.139 --> 00:05:58.610
 happened this does not matter to the 

00:05:56.899 --> 00:06:01.669
 narrative of the late show but the 

00:05:58.610 --> 00:06:03.860
 The narrative of the left outs is about how 

00:06:01.669 --> 00:06:07.309
 people deal with pedro and not about 

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:09.529
 why the losses happen then it is not 

00:06:07.309 --> 00:06:11.419
 for lack of this information I already say to 

00:06:09.529 --> 00:06:13.279
 you do not have this information that is not 

00:06:11.419 --> 00:06:13.909
 for her that I was dissatisfied with the 

00:06:13.279 --> 00:06:15.289
 Last 

00:06:13.909 --> 00:06:16.959
 why I was pleased with 

00:06:15.289 --> 00:06:19.939
 the end is that the conclusion is very 

00:06:16.959 --> 00:06:22.189
 simplicity in the face of the general 

00:06:19.939 --> 00:06:24.499
 of the thing is as if the more than 300 

00:06:22.189 --> 00:06:27.289
 pages here would serve only for 

00:06:24.499 --> 00:06:29.360
 mock the sense of human purpose 

00:06:27.289 --> 00:06:32.319
 the characters begin book searching for a 

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:34.849
 sense of purpose that was lost by the 

00:06:32.319 --> 00:06:38.089
 randomness of disappearances and 

00:06:34.849 --> 00:06:40.849
 end up assuming their mediocrity and 

00:06:38.089 --> 00:06:42.409
 abandoning the search or else manufacturing 

00:06:40.849 --> 00:06:44.869
 a sense of purpose that is 

00:06:42.409 --> 00:06:47.539
 completely incoherent 

00:06:44.869 --> 00:06:49.610
 I do not know if I'm happy or sad about 

00:06:47.539 --> 00:06:52.639
 know that this is a single book so 

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:54.979
 without foreseen continuation but it is for these 

00:06:52.639 --> 00:06:56.959
 and others that I admit that really 

00:06:54.979 --> 00:06:59.419
 I liked the show more 

00:06:56.959 --> 00:07:01.429
 long life to the well love that is 

00:06:59.419 --> 00:07:03.679
 producing a beautiful and improved 

00:07:01.429 --> 00:07:05.059
 adaptation and that's what I was more 

00:07:03.679 --> 00:07:07.429
 telling about books literature 

00:07:05.059 --> 00:07:09.289
 stay connected to hair and not 

00:07:07.429 --> 00:07:10.099
 forget to sign up for the channel until 

00:07:09.289 --> 00:07:12.379
 the next 

00:07:10.099 --> 00:07:14.300
 It's the show, it's so cool but so 

00:07:12.379 --> 00:07:15.679
 cool that they even improve a cover of the 

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:17.809
 book is 

00:07:15.679 --> 00:07:19.490
 There were people who listened to 

00:07:17.809 --> 00:07:22.490
 my review so the water was more 

00:07:19.490 --> 00:07:25.610
 on the cover was a warm blue cape 

00:07:22.490 --> 00:07:28.339
 I do not know but it 's the first one is completely 

00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:31.039
 sexist binary and even sexism 

00:07:28.339 --> 00:07:34.869
 owner and I do not know 

00:07:31.039 --> 00:07:34.869
 is so cute in Uncle's Graphic Design 

00:07:36.669 --> 00:07:44.119
 much cooler it will be too he is a 

00:07:39.679 --> 00:07:47.329
 Police officer, it's not like I'm talking either. 

00:07:44.119 --> 00:07:49.159
 evil of the book I think that I like the 

00:07:47.329 --> 00:07:50.900
 The series is very anxious for the second 

00:07:49.159 --> 00:07:52.190
 season is going 

00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:53.449
 I want to buy a book as a 

00:07:52.190 --> 00:07:55.690
 complement that was the same as me 

00:07:53.449 --> 00:07:55.690
 made
