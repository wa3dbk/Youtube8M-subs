you have two ways to do it

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:46.330 
you have two ways to do it
you<00:02:43.130> can<00:02:43.400> select<00:02:43.940> Wi-Fi<00:02:44.360> and<00:02:44.959> then<00:02:45.680> you<00:02:46.130> will

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:46.340 
you can select Wi-Fi and then you will

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:51.070 
you can select Wi-Fi and then you will
see<00:02:46.640> a<00:02:46.670> browser<00:02:47.860> upload<00:02:48.860> file<00:02:49.310> here<00:02:50.270> is<00:02:50.510> the<00:02:50.930> IP

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:51.080 
see a browser upload file here is the IP

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:54.880 
see a browser upload file here is the IP
which<00:02:51.800> you<00:02:51.980> enter<00:02:52.310> in<00:02:52.640> your<00:02:52.700> browser<00:02:53.269> and<00:02:53.890> then

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:54.890 
which you enter in your browser and then

00:02:54.890 --> 00:02:59.920 
which you enter in your browser and then
you<00:02:55.070> will<00:02:55.250> see<00:02:55.519> this<00:02:55.970> upload<00:02:56.660> screen<00:02:57.760> in<00:02:58.930> the

00:02:59.920 --> 00:02:59.930 
you will see this upload screen in the

00:02:59.930 --> 00:03:03.100 
you will see this upload screen in the
screen<00:03:00.260> you<00:03:00.590> can<00:03:00.800> only<00:03:01.010> choose<00:03:01.700> one<00:03:01.760> file<00:03:02.360> for

00:03:03.100 --> 00:03:03.110 
screen you can only choose one file for

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:07.870 
screen you can only choose one file for
upload<00:03:03.290> so<00:03:03.890> it's<00:03:04.100> a<00:03:04.190> bit<00:03:05.470> a<00:03:06.470> bit<00:03:07.010> tricky<00:03:07.580> if<00:03:07.760> you

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:07.880 
upload so it's a bit a bit tricky if you

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:10.090 
upload so it's a bit a bit tricky if you
want<00:03:08.090> to<00:03:08.239> upload<00:03:08.690> more<00:03:09.110> than<00:03:09.290> one<00:03:09.500> song<00:03:09.860> or

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:10.100 
want to upload more than one song or

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:12.130 
want to upload more than one song or
more<00:03:10.340> than<00:03:10.550> let's<00:03:10.970> say<00:03:11.180> five<00:03:11.450> songs<00:03:11.840> so<00:03:12.110> I

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:12.140 
more than let's say five songs so I

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:15.420 
more than let's say five songs so I
prefer<00:03:13.040> another<00:03:13.580> option<00:03:14.150> of<00:03:14.330> uploading<00:03:14.720> files

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:15.430 
prefer another option of uploading files

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:19.270 
prefer another option of uploading files
so<00:03:16.430> we<00:03:16.760> go<00:03:17.000> back<00:03:17.030> to<00:03:17.269> the<00:03:17.569> app<00:03:17.690> here<00:03:18.290> and<00:03:18.440> we

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:19.280 
so we go back to the app here and we

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:22.449 
so we go back to the app here and we
don't<00:03:19.489> select<00:03:19.670> Wi-Fi<00:03:20.060> we<00:03:20.480> select<00:03:20.870> a<00:03:21.140> web<00:03:21.739> DAV

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:22.459 
don't select Wi-Fi we select a web DAV

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:26.830 
don't select Wi-Fi we select a web DAV
and<00:03:22.790> if<00:03:23.570> we<00:03:23.750> have<00:03:23.840> selected<00:03:24.230> web<00:03:24.440> TV<00:03:24.709> we<00:03:25.840> will

00:03:26.830 --> 00:03:26.840 
and if we have selected web TV we will

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:29.199 
and if we have selected web TV we will
need<00:03:27.130> if<00:03:28.130> you're<00:03:28.310> a<00:03:28.340> Windows<00:03:28.820> user<00:03:28.850> I

need if you're a Windows user I

00:03:29.209 --> 00:03:31.449 
need if you're a Windows user I
recommend<00:03:29.810> at<00:03:29.930> least<00:03:30.140> using<00:03:30.470> another<00:03:31.220> app

00:03:31.449 --> 00:03:31.459 
recommend at least using another app

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:33.490 
recommend at least using another app
it's<00:03:31.640> called<00:03:31.700> a<00:03:32.120> carrot<00:03:32.480> theory<00:03:32.989> I<00:03:33.019> will<00:03:33.290> show

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:33.500 
it's called a carrot theory I will show

00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:36.759 
it's called a carrot theory I will show
it<00:03:33.560> in<00:03:34.010> a<00:03:34.130> minute<00:03:34.160> or<00:03:34.940> if<00:03:35.360> you<00:03:35.540> are<00:03:35.900> working<00:03:36.470> on

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:41.090 
a Mac you can just enter the IP again in

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:45.069 
a Mac you can just enter the IP again in
the<00:03:41.530> finder<00:03:42.530> of<00:03:42.560> your<00:03:42.890> Mac<00:03:43.070> and<00:03:43.400> then<00:03:44.209> you<00:03:44.870> will

00:03:45.069 --> 00:03:45.079 
the finder of your Mac and then you will

00:03:45.079 --> 00:03:47.800 
the finder of your Mac and then you will
see<00:03:45.410> that<00:03:45.860> you<00:03:46.010> can<00:03:46.220> just<00:03:46.250> move<00:03:47.120> complete

00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:47.810 
see that you can just move complete

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:51.190 
see that you can just move complete
folders<00:03:48.320> or<00:03:48.739> several<00:03:49.310> files<00:03:49.549> at<00:03:49.760> once<00:03:50.030> to<00:03:50.959> this

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:51.200 
folders or several files at once to this

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:55.270 
folders or several files at once to this
device<00:03:51.590> I<00:03:51.890> will<00:03:52.850> now<00:03:53.000> show<00:03:53.600> to<00:03:53.630> you<00:03:54.280> using

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:55.280 
device I will now show to you using

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:58.780 
device I will now show to you using
Windows<00:03:56.150> and<00:03:56.950> therefore<00:03:57.950> I've<00:03:58.100> downloaded<00:03:58.400> a

00:03:58.780 --> 00:03:58.790 
Windows and therefore I've downloaded a

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:02.110 
Windows and therefore I've downloaded a
program<00:03:59.239> it's<00:03:59.390> called<00:03:59.450> carrot<00:04:00.109> DAV<00:04:01.120> mainly

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:02.120 
program it's called carrot DAV mainly

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:04.690 
program it's called carrot DAV mainly
because<00:04:02.239> the<00:04:02.720> web<00:04:02.989> T<00:04:03.200> AV<00:04:03.500> integration<00:04:03.799> windows

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:04.700 
because the web T AV integration windows

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:08.440 
because the web T AV integration windows
itself<00:04:05.150> is<00:04:05.329> very<00:04:05.600> bad<00:04:05.900> and<00:04:06.489> it's<00:04:07.489> not<00:04:07.700> real<00:04:08.120> fun

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:08.450 
itself is very bad and it's not real fun

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:10.900 
itself is very bad and it's not real fun
using<00:04:09.049> this<00:04:09.260> but<00:04:09.620> with<00:04:09.799> the<00:04:09.950> carrot<00:04:10.280> to<00:04:10.400> AV<00:04:10.700> app

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:10.910 
using this but with the carrot to AV app

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:13.150 
using this but with the carrot to AV app
it's<00:04:11.150> it<00:04:11.720> works<00:04:11.959> a<00:04:12.079> bit<00:04:12.230> similar<00:04:12.440> like<00:04:12.739> using

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:13.160 
it's it works a bit similar like using

00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:16.599 
it's it works a bit similar like using
an<00:04:13.400> FTP<00:04:13.850> server<00:04:14.739> you<00:04:15.739> just<00:04:15.980> connect<00:04:16.310> to<00:04:16.400> your

has<00:04:20.090> given<00:04:20.419> us<00:04:20.890> and<00:04:22.780> yeah<00:04:23.780> and<00:04:23.960> that's<00:04:24.110> it<00:04:24.320> now

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:24.620 
has given us and yeah and that's it now

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:26.590 
has given us and yeah and that's it now
you<00:04:25.160> can<00:04:25.370> hear<00:04:25.550> just<00:04:25.910> from<00:04:26.150> a<00:04:26.270> Windows
