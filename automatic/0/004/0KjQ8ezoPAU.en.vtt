 hello people today I want to show you 

00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:08.639
 how he converts mp4 video files 

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:11.250
 make it with the windows movie maker 

00:00:08.639 --> 00:00:14.790
 Most phones can handle 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:17.940
 or smartphones give yours 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:20.279
 Video files as mp4 from the problem is 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.710
 if he opens windows movie maker 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.619
 you can not mp4 the file 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:27.740
 import 

00:00:24.619 --> 00:00:29.670
 There is a program that is called 

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:32.250
 freemake video converter 

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.500
 this could be anywhere on chip.de or 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:40.520
 download computer picture for free 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:40.520
 Here you can import the file 

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:53.769
 and the program 

00:00:50.350 --> 00:01:01.059
 the video file and you can put it in one 

00:00:53.769 --> 00:01:06.700
 convert another format so here is 

00:01:01.059 --> 00:01:07.890
 your video 1280 x 720 is the 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:11.130
 resolution 

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:14.369
 that is when he clicks convert 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:18.520
 I always take the windows movie 

00:01:14.369 --> 00:01:22.619
 video file there this is the file 

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:22.619
 windows movie maker can best solve 

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:29.330
 then you click on it 

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:31.370
 and then this window opens here 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:34.990
 can you still stand one in which 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:40.180
 quality you want to have your video 

00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:44.119
 I take this 720 that my with 

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:45.979
 1280 x 720 the image resolution is that 

00:01:44.119 --> 00:01:49.070
 I could be different the whole can 

00:01:45.979 --> 00:01:52.670
 also take full hd but I take now 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:54.460
 this hd ready and click on 

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.990
 convert 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:58.840
 that can actually be seconds now 

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:01.280
 last 

00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:02.960
 I shot a short video especially 

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:05.500
 seven seconds that something 

00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:05.500
 goes faster 

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:17.950
 Come on now 

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:15.629
 so when the video is finished converting 

00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:17.610
 Just close me ok 

00:03:15.629 --> 00:03:23.340
 and you could already do that too 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:24.709
 if you have so set 

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:28.980
 that it is the video file on the desktop 

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:33.810
 light it shows this file to that is 

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:38.599
