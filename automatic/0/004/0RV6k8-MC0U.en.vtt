00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.670
 hello in this video would like you 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:07.080
 explain we had to hold right 

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:08.790
 from the beginning very important that you 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.340
 in no way alone 

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:13.259
 The rats are here should 

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:16.590
 keep them at least two therefore 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:18.090
 Of course we will be 3 then we want you 

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:21.240
 consider whether your male or female 

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:23.390
 Both wanted to be able to hold gender 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.500
 Do not hold her together 

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:27.480
 Of course, only if you are uncontrolled 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.949
 wanted to avoid offspring since the 

00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:31.140
 namely females every four days 

00:00:28.949 --> 00:00:33.480
 ready to mate or you call that 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:37.410
 also that they are hotly we can 

00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:39.180
 every 21 days we get a little bit 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:41.520
 now, of course, in the end now 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:43.739
 male or female keep that remains 

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.780
 of course leave it to you because that is 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:48.539
 also a matter of taste 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:49.920
 the humans are he from the essence 

00:00:48.539 --> 00:00:51.539
 a bit quieter and we are 

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:54.930
 become more polluted than the females 

00:00:51.539 --> 00:00:57.980
 the soft bit more agile playful 

00:00:54.930 --> 00:01:00.750
 and also a bit hot 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:02.250
 next, it is also important that 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.500
 you think how much time he has in the 

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:05.760
 we can invest you animals 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.950
 not necessarily twelve hours now 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:11.119
 But meditating employs an hour 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:12.990
 spout the day is minimum in which you 

00:01:11.119 --> 00:01:16.020
 busy and him too 

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:18.180
 Outlet granted to working and 

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:19.740
 These animals walk very well there at night 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:21.659
 are active and if of course in the evening 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.520
 after work comes home 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.979
 the little ones too ready for theirs 

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.810
 casserole for schoolchildren are also here 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:29.820
 not bad because the rats fit 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.829
 Also get on and go to the spout 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:36.350
 enjoy the afternoon when the child 

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:39.540
 comes home we come now to 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:42.210
 feeding it is very much in any case 

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:45.479
 important that you fresh every day 

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:48.030
 water provides how many there where one 

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:50.280
 drinking bottle my come with it all 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:51.570
 clearly that is also guaranteed that the 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.000
 Water is always clean 

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:55.979
 some also use a shell 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.960
 with water as it is not optimal 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:00.030
 ensures that it always stops 

00:01:57.960 --> 00:02:01.480
 clean water is there the little ones 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:04.930
 Also a bit crazy 

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:08.140
 thoben in the cage and the strew could 

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:09.940
 naturally get into the water 

00:02:08.140 --> 00:02:15.010
 and that's why the water is natural 

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:17.920
 I recommend to eat dirty 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:19.930
 in any case, they are fresh every day 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:20.890
 granular food provides that you can 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:22.750
 of course in the torhalle 

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.880
 putting together yours of course 

00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:27.370
 I like it and it is 

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:30.190
 It is important that you have fresh fruit every day 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:32.830
 and vegetables I remove that 

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:36.460
 then six hours because then it is 

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:40.900
 usually not as fresh as that 

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:42.730
 next come medium in the cage because 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:45.100
 Of course , a style has to keep up 

00:02:42.730 --> 00:02:47.800
 It was important for you to have one 

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:50.530
 big cage you can not do that 

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:52.480
 here are two or four animals in this way 

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:56.140
 a hamster deep, I hold so 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:02:58.000
 small, the only one has the end 

00:02:56.140 --> 00:03:00.370
 a lot of things have to move 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.830
 So go several floors 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:05.200
 It is nevertheless important that the cage 

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:10.090
 if you keep two animals that he 

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:12.640
 at least 70 cm high is 45 centimeters 

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:15.910
 wide and 80 cm long 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:19.090
 So that's the minimum for two had 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:20.830
 I hold three had three males 

00:03:19.090 --> 00:03:23.560
 and may one deep down me too 

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:25.420
 accordingly larger but there are 

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.920
 not just one level because 

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:30.100
 the Russians could carry that 

00:03:26.920 --> 00:03:32.260
 You can discover climbing 

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:36.130
 and you have to have one 

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:38.080
 large cage for it have naturally 

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:41.290
 The cage is also important for us 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:43.350
 I cleanse at least once a week 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:47.590
 clean mainzer twice a week 

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:50.560
 remove the stray cleanse too 

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:53.610
 new newspaper snippets ready with it 

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:56.980
 build their mesters the deep me 

00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:58.770
 and then once a month I would give them 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:02.470
 his once completely 

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:03.880
 because very clean animals and rats 

00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:06.550
 Do not like that too much when you do 

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:08.980
 enemy burin stinks so once in 

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:14.350
 month but completely by scrubbing that 

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:16.930
 he would be freed from all things then yes 

00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:19.920
 I say that was the first then 

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:22.770
 key things to rat attitude 

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:25.950
 I hope it helped you further 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:28.420
 and if you all these points now 

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:31.240
 mind and go over food though 

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:33.630
 we are ready for you then you can 

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:36.850
 Get your rats, too 

00:04:33.630 --> 00:04:40.140
 yes we say goodbye and I hope so 

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:40.140
 helped you
