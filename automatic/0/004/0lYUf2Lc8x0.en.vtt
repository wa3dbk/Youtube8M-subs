one of those other maps so I mean it's

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:39.080 
one of those other maps so I mean it's
just<00:04:35.820> on<00:04:36.210> that<00:04:36.770> alone<00:04:37.770> just<00:04:38.130> this<00:04:38.490> particular

00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:39.090 
just on that alone just this particular

feature of this add-on it makes it kind

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:46.760 
feature of this add-on it makes it kind
of<00:04:42.360> worth<00:04:42.620> the<00:04:43.620> money<00:04:43.800> I<00:04:44.100> mean<00:04:44.520> I<00:04:44.550> could<00:04:45.770> the

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:46.770 
of worth the money I mean I could the

00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:51.320 
of worth the money I mean I could the
ability<00:04:47.640> to<00:04:47.850> calculate<00:04:48.270> the<00:04:50.060> you<00:04:51.060> know<00:04:51.180> which

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:51.330 
ability to calculate the you know which

items<00:04:51.510> are<00:04:51.810> profitable<00:04:52.290> craft<00:04:52.740> is<00:04:53.190> nice<00:04:53.490> I

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:53.880 
items are profitable craft is nice I

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:56.810 
items are profitable craft is nice I
mean<00:04:54.510> it<00:04:54.810> saves<00:04:55.020> a<00:04:55.140> lot<00:04:55.230> of<00:04:55.290> time<00:04:55.580> but<00:04:56.580> if

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:56.820 
mean it saves a lot of time but if

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:58.700 
mean it saves a lot of time but if
you've<00:04:57.030> been<00:04:57.210> doing<00:04:57.420> the<00:04:57.510> profession<00:04:58.020> for<00:04:58.650> a

a particular item is profitable or not
to<00:05:03.750> craft<00:05:04.080> in<00:05:04.520> so<00:05:05.520> I<00:05:05.550> mean<00:05:05.790> it<00:05:06.350> but<00:05:07.350> by<00:05:08.070> far<00:05:08.310> this

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:08.610 
to craft in so I mean it but by far this

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:11.720 
to craft in so I mean it but by far this
is<00:05:08.670> the<00:05:08.850> greatest<00:05:09.540> value<00:05:10.050> are<00:05:10.410> the<00:05:11.160> in-game

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:11.730 
is the greatest value are the in-game
