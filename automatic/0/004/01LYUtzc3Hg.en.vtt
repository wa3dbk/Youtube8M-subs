there's there's been there's not one of

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:16.030 
there's there's been there's not one of
those<00:02:14.090> fights<00:02:14.390> where<00:02:14.569> I<00:02:14.629> could<00:02:14.930> have<00:02:15.080> almost

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:16.040 
those fights where I could have almost

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:17.830 
those fights where I could have almost
won<00:02:16.430> it<00:02:16.610> but<00:02:16.819> look<00:02:17.090> that's<00:02:17.300> not<00:02:17.360> good<00:02:17.629> enough

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840
