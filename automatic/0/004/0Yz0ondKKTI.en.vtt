I was just like okay so that happened

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:10.700 
I was just like okay so that happened
and<00:01:08.250> I<00:01:08.850> got<00:01:09.060> over<00:01:09.390> it<00:01:09.420> pretty<00:01:09.540> quickly<00:01:09.869> so<00:01:10.530> it

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:10.710 
and I got over it pretty quickly so it

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.550 
and I got over it pretty quickly so it
was<00:01:10.799> like<00:01:10.979> okay<00:01:11.340> you<00:01:12.210> know<00:01:12.390> I<00:01:12.659> I<00:01:13.140> knew

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:13.560 
was like okay you know I I knew

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:15.080 
was like okay you know I I knew
something<00:01:14.070> like<00:01:14.100> this<00:01:14.220> was<00:01:14.490> going<00:01:14.700> to<00:01:14.880> happen

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:15.090 
something like this was going to happen

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.030 
something like this was going to happen
and<00:01:15.479> I<00:01:15.960> think<00:01:15.990> that<00:01:16.380> is<00:01:16.590> what<00:01:16.799> people

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:17.040 
and I think that is what people

00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:20.539 
and I think that is what people
commented<00:01:17.909> on<00:01:18.030> my<00:01:18.110> video<00:01:19.110> of<00:01:19.560> lush<00:01:20.040> sage<00:01:20.310> like

00:01:20.539 --> 00:01:20.549 
commented on my video of lush sage like

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:24.020 
commented on my video of lush sage like
the<00:01:21.320> second<00:01:22.320> episodes<00:01:22.799> review<00:01:23.189> I<00:01:23.250> think<00:01:23.280> that

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:24.030 
the second episodes review I think that

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.179 
the second episodes review I think that
people<00:01:24.330> say<00:01:24.479> that<00:01:24.659> I<00:01:24.810> would<00:01:24.960> not<00:01:25.170> not<00:01:25.619> like<00:01:25.860> it

00:01:26.179 --> 00:01:26.189 
people say that I would not not like it

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.100 
people say that I would not not like it
anymore<00:01:26.520> after<00:01:26.880> one<00:01:27.270> scene<00:01:27.570> and<00:01:27.600> that's<00:01:27.930> maybe

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:28.110 
anymore after one scene and that's maybe

00:01:28.110 --> 00:01:31.039 
anymore after one scene and that's maybe
this<00:01:28.380> one<00:01:28.650> or<00:01:29.250> maybe<00:01:29.549> it<00:01:29.729> gets<00:01:29.939> worse

00:01:31.039 --> 00:01:31.049 
this one or maybe it gets worse

00:01:31.049 --> 00:01:33.770 
this one or maybe it gets worse
no<00:01:31.979> not<00:01:32.220> worth<00:01:32.460> in<00:01:32.700> a<00:01:32.850> bad<00:01:33.090> way<00:01:33.329> but<00:01:33.390> you<00:01:33.659> know

very cool but yeah anyway he's only
awkward<00:03:07.049> thing<00:03:07.290> in<00:03:07.440> this<00:03:07.650> episode<00:03:08.400> of<00:03:08.580> sexual

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:09.239 
awkward thing in this episode of sexual

00:03:09.239 --> 00:03:11.930 
awkward thing in this episode of sexual
scene<00:03:09.569> but<00:03:10.260> they<00:03:10.680> censor<00:03:11.190> that<00:03:11.310> pretty<00:03:11.670> well

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:11.940 
scene but they censor that pretty well

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:13.970 
scene but they censor that pretty well
and<00:03:12.269> I<00:03:12.390> think<00:03:12.630> they<00:03:12.780> did<00:03:12.840> a<00:03:12.989> good<00:03:13.200> job<00:03:13.260> on<00:03:13.680> it<00:03:13.709> I

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
and I think they did a good job on it I

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:16.460 
and I think they did a good job on it I
think<00:03:14.220> it<00:03:14.340> was<00:03:14.519> there<00:03:15.269> was<00:03:15.420> more<00:03:15.750> in<00:03:15.959> the<00:03:16.079> manga

00:03:16.460 --> 00:03:16.470 
think it was there was more in the manga

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:19.759 
think it was there was more in the manga
