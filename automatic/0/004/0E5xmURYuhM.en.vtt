that concept the other thing that I

that concept the other thing that I
think<00:00:39.180> is<00:00:39.300> very<00:00:39.540> appealing<00:00:39.780> to<00:00:40.200> clinicians

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799

this system is interesting because they

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.980 
this system is interesting because they
come<00:02:03.329> in<00:02:03.479> these<00:02:03.710> easy<00:02:04.710> to<00:02:05.100> dispense<00:02:05.990> syringes

want<00:02:15.590> to<00:02:15.680> preview<00:02:15.920> these<00:02:16.340> in<00:02:16.790> the<00:02:16.970> mouth<00:02:17.150> with

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:17.660 
want to preview these in the mouth with

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:19.750 
want to preview these in the mouth with
your<00:02:17.690> staff<00:02:18.110> trained<00:02:18.920> your<00:02:19.070> assistant

00:02:19.750 --> 00:02:19.760 
your staff trained your assistant

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.060 
your staff trained your assistant
to<00:02:20.000> understand<00:02:20.480> this<00:02:20.720> is<00:02:20.930> that<00:02:21.290> you<00:02:21.680> can<00:02:21.860> see

00:02:22.060 --> 00:02:22.070 
to understand this is that you can see

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:25.030 
to understand this is that you can see
the<00:02:22.600> difficult<00:02:23.830> characteristics<00:02:24.830> between

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:25.040 
the difficult characteristics between

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.390 
the difficult characteristics between
the<00:02:25.370> opaque<00:02:25.700> 1<00:02:26.000> 2<00:02:26.300> 3<00:02:26.540> 4<00:02:26.900> &amp;<00:02:27.050> 5<00:02:27.110> and<00:02:27.560> then<00:02:28.070> you<00:02:28.100> see

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400 
the opaque 1 2 3 4 &amp; 5 and then you see

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:31.000 
the opaque 1 2 3 4 &amp; 5 and then you see
what<00:02:29.180> the<00:02:29.390> translucent<00:02:30.200> shades<00:02:30.440> have<00:02:30.680> and

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.010 
what the translucent shades have and

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.190 
what the translucent shades have and
then<00:02:31.550> they<00:02:31.760> have<00:02:31.940> the<00:02:32.120> flow<00:02:32.330> of<00:02:32.360> all<00:02:32.660> shades<00:02:32.960> as

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:33.200 
then they have the flow of all shades as

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.700 
then they have the flow of all shades as
well<00:02:33.470> as<00:02:33.710> the<00:02:33.950> analogues<00:02:34.960> what<00:02:35.960> I<00:02:35.990> think<00:02:36.470> is<00:02:36.680> a

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:36.710 
well as the analogues what I think is a

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:38.910 
well as the analogues what I think is a
very<00:02:37.100> easy<00:02:37.340> thing<00:02:37.760> to<00:02:37.790> understand<00:02:38.450> is<00:02:38.810> that

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:38.920 
very easy thing to understand is that

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:42.820 
very easy thing to understand is that
after<00:02:39.920> you<00:02:40.070> do<00:02:40.280> your<00:02:40.520> adhesive<00:02:41.150> protocols<00:02:42.020> you

00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:42.830 
after you do your adhesive protocols you

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:45.850 
after you do your adhesive protocols you
pick<00:02:43.130> your<00:02:43.340> best<00:02:43.550> opaque<00:02:44.180> shade<00:02:44.590> for<00:02:45.590> the<00:02:45.620> base

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:45.860 
pick your best opaque shade for the base

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:47.980 
pick your best opaque shade for the base
of<00:02:46.040> the<00:02:46.130> preparation<00:02:46.760> and<00:02:46.940> whether<00:02:47.840> it's

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:47.990 
of the preparation and whether it's

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:50.950 
of the preparation and whether it's
opaque<00:02:48.350> 1<00:02:48.650> opaque<00:02:49.190> to<00:02:49.400> opaque<00:02:49.880> 3<00:02:50.240> you<00:02:50.750> layer

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:50.960 
opaque 1 opaque to opaque 3 you layer

00:02:50.960 --> 00:02:53.200 
opaque 1 opaque to opaque 3 you layer
this<00:02:51.290> up<00:02:51.650> to<00:02:51.800> the<00:02:51.950> dentin<00:02:52.310> enamel<00:02:52.700> Junction

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:53.210 
this up to the dentin enamel Junction

00:02:53.210 --> 00:02:55.480 
this up to the dentin enamel Junction
and<00:02:53.360> then<00:02:53.720> you<00:02:53.900> take<00:02:54.110> a<00:02:54.140> look<00:02:54.440> at<00:02:54.620> it<00:02:54.800> and<00:02:54.920> see

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:55.490 
and then you take a look at it and see

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:57.430 
and then you take a look at it and see
if<00:02:55.700> you<00:02:55.820> like<00:02:56.000> what<00:02:56.330> you<00:02:56.480> see<00:02:56.660> does<00:02:56.870> is<00:02:57.230> the

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:57.440 
if you like what you see does is the

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:00.130 
if you like what you see does is the
color<00:02:57.850> compatible<00:02:58.850> with<00:02:59.150> what<00:02:59.420> you<00:02:59.600> feel<00:02:59.840> will

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:00.140 
color compatible with what you feel will

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:03.610 
color compatible with what you feel will
be<00:03:00.320> the<00:03:00.770> enamel<00:03:01.730> layer<00:03:01.880> if<00:03:02.210> it's<00:03:02.750> the<00:03:02.870> same<00:03:03.110> if

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620 
be the enamel layer if it's the same if

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:05.410 
be the enamel layer if it's the same if
you<00:03:03.830> like<00:03:04.070> what<00:03:04.280> you<00:03:04.400> see<00:03:04.610> then<00:03:05.000> what<00:03:05.240> you

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:05.420 
you like what you see then what you

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:07.960 
you like what you see then what you
would<00:03:05.570> do<00:03:05.780> is<00:03:05.990> put<00:03:06.200> a<00:03:06.230> translucent<00:03:07.100> neutral

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:07.970 
would do is put a translucent neutral

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:10.480 
would do is put a translucent neutral
enamel<00:03:08.660> shade<00:03:08.930> on<00:03:09.170> top<00:03:09.470> and<00:03:09.770> light<00:03:09.980> carrot<00:03:10.340> and

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:10.490 
enamel shade on top and light carrot and

00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:12.460 
enamel shade on top and light carrot and
what<00:03:10.970> you<00:03:11.090> see<00:03:11.270> is<00:03:11.450> what<00:03:11.630> you<00:03:11.690> get<00:03:12.020> it's<00:03:12.260> so

00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:12.470 
what you see is what you get it's so

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:15.580 
what you see is what you get it's so
easy<00:03:12.770> to<00:03:13.070> understand<00:03:13.670> if<00:03:14.480> you<00:03:14.780> want<00:03:15.110> to<00:03:15.260> vary

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:15.590 
easy to understand if you want to vary

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:18.400 
easy to understand if you want to vary
the<00:03:15.860> enamel<00:03:16.400> and<00:03:16.550> change<00:03:17.120> the<00:03:17.420> value<00:03:18.050> of<00:03:18.080> it

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:18.410 
the enamel and change the value of it

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:20.500 
the enamel and change the value of it
you<00:03:18.920> can<00:03:19.160> change<00:03:19.400> it<00:03:19.640> into<00:03:19.820> a<00:03:20.000> a<00:03:20.210> lighter

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:20.510 
you can change it into a a lighter

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:23.650 
you can change it into a a lighter
higher<00:03:21.410> value<00:03:22.010> translucent<00:03:22.910> light<00:03:23.120> to

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:23.660 
higher value translucent light to

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:25.690 
higher value translucent light to
correct<00:03:23.990> it<00:03:24.140> or<00:03:24.290> you<00:03:24.710> can<00:03:24.890> tone<00:03:25.100> it<00:03:25.250> down<00:03:25.400> and

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:25.700 
correct it or you can tone it down and

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:27.360 
correct it or you can tone it down and
lower<00:03:25.910> the<00:03:26.180> value<00:03:26.300> a<00:03:26.570> little<00:03:26.720> bit<00:03:27.020> by<00:03:27.170> using

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:27.370 
lower the value a little bit by using

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:30.280 
lower the value a little bit by using
translucent<00:03:28.370> dark<00:03:28.730> this<00:03:29.360> takes<00:03:29.630> matter<00:03:30.050> of

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:30.290 
translucent dark this takes matter of

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:32.560 
translucent dark this takes matter of
seconds<00:03:30.770> and<00:03:30.980> it's<00:03:31.340> so<00:03:31.520> easy<00:03:31.760> to<00:03:32.060> understand

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:32.570 
seconds and it's so easy to understand

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:34.930 
seconds and it's so easy to understand
it's<00:03:33.230> it's<00:03:33.650> almost<00:03:33.980> too<00:03:34.220> easy<00:03:34.370> for<00:03:34.520> us<00:03:34.790> as

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:34.940 
it's it's almost too easy for us as

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:37.180 
it's it's almost too easy for us as
clinicians<00:03:35.180> to<00:03:35.720> teach<00:03:35.900> this<00:03:36.170> for<00:03:36.620> instance<00:03:36.830> if

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:37.190 
clinicians to teach this for instance if

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:38.440 
clinicians to teach this for instance if
I<00:03:37.340> was<00:03:37.490> going<00:03:37.700> to<00:03:37.730> take<00:03:37.970> some<00:03:38.240> of<00:03:38.270> this

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:38.450 
I was going to take some of this

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:39.880 
I was going to take some of this
material<00:03:38.990> and<00:03:39.110> put<00:03:39.290> it<00:03:39.410> into<00:03:39.710> this<00:03:39.830> little

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:39.890 
material and put it into this little

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:43.240 
material and put it into this little
plastic<00:03:40.490> type<00:03:40.970> a<00:03:41.150> dot<00:03:41.300> model<00:03:42.010> just<00:03:43.010> take<00:03:43.220> a

even<00:03:45.470> have<00:03:45.710> to<00:03:45.830> be<00:03:45.920> a<00:03:45.950> metallic<00:03:46.280> instrument<00:03:46.940> is

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:47.030 
even have to be a metallic instrument is

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:49.450 
even have to be a metallic instrument is
that<00:03:47.600> you<00:03:47.750> get<00:03:47.930> automatically<00:03:48.680> a<00:03:48.830> feel<00:03:49.190> for

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:49.460 
that you get automatically a feel for

00:03:49.460 --> 00:03:51.700 
that you get automatically a feel for
the<00:03:49.580> material<00:03:50.090> right<00:03:50.360> here<00:03:50.390> it<00:03:51.260> just<00:03:51.440> stays

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:51.710 
the material right here it just stays

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:55.450 
the material right here it just stays
where<00:03:51.980> you<00:03:52.100> want<00:03:52.340> it<00:03:52.490> it's<00:03:53.120> very<00:03:53.450> quiet<00:03:54.460> easy

where you want it it's very quiet easy
handling<00:03:56.120> very<00:03:56.750> interesting<00:03:57.320> material<00:03:57.920> and

00:03:58.570 --> 00:03:58.580 
handling very interesting material and

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:00.760 
handling very interesting material and
if<00:03:59.240> you<00:03:59.330> like<00:03:59.540> what<00:03:59.720> you<00:03:59.840> see<00:04:00.020> then<00:04:00.350> what<00:04:00.590> you

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:00.770 
if you like what you see then what you

00:04:00.770 --> 00:04:02.680 
if you like what you see then what you
would<00:04:00.890> do<00:04:01.070> then<00:04:01.280> is<00:04:01.490> take<00:04:01.700> some<00:04:01.970> translucent

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:02.690 
would do then is take some translucent

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:05.280 
would do then is take some translucent
material<00:04:03.110> out<00:04:03.230> and<00:04:03.440> then<00:04:04.130> you<00:04:04.250> just<00:04:04.430> put<00:04:04.640> the

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:05.290 
material out and then you just put the

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:07.780 
material out and then you just put the
enamel<00:04:06.290> system<00:04:06.680> whether<00:04:07.130> you<00:04:07.310> like<00:04:07.460> to<00:04:07.640> use

makes no difference it doesn't stick and

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:13.630 
makes no difference it doesn't stick and
then<00:04:12.050> you<00:04:12.170> see<00:04:12.320> the<00:04:12.500> duality<00:04:13.100> you<00:04:13.130> see<00:04:13.430> two

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:13.640 
then you see the duality you see two

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:16.150 
then you see the duality you see two
different<00:04:13.790> shades<00:04:14.240> it's<00:04:14.990> so<00:04:15.260> the<00:04:15.650> optical

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:16.160 
different shades it's so the optical

00:05:07.020 --> 00:05:07.030 
interesting why would you use a flowable

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:09.810 
interesting why would you use a flowable
opaque<00:05:07.470> well<00:05:08.470> you<00:05:08.950> get<00:05:09.070> into<00:05:09.310> class<00:05:09.520> five

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:09.820 
opaque well you get into class five

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:11.850 
opaque well you get into class five

value<00:05:12.630> we've<00:05:13.630> all<00:05:13.810> seen<00:05:14.050> this<00:05:14.170> as<00:05:14.350> clinicians

00:05:14.670 --> 00:05:14.680 
value we've all seen this as clinicians

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:16.800 
value we've all seen this as clinicians
sometimes<00:05:15.640> after<00:05:16.030> you<00:05:16.120> put<00:05:16.300> your<00:05:16.330> photo<00:05:16.630> a

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:16.810 
sometimes after you put your photo a

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:20.220 
sometimes after you put your photo a

then<00:05:20.860> maybe<00:05:21.130> you<00:05:21.250> can<00:05:21.400> put<00:05:21.550> a<00:05:21.580> little<00:05:21.730> bit<00:05:21.910> of
