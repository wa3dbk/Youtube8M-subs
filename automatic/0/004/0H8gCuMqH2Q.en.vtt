00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:07.150 
final target neutralized let's get out

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:13.380 
final target neutralized let's get out
of<00:01:07.180> here

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:13.390 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:15.540 

let's<00:01:14.020> find<00:01:14.290> a<00:01:14.380> ride<00:01:14.560> and<00:01:14.800> get<00:01:14.950> to<00:01:15.070> the<00:01:15.100> captain

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:15.550 
let's find a ride and get to the captain

let's find a ride and get to the captain
no<00:01:15.850> that'll<00:01:16.210> take<00:01:16.390> too<00:01:16.540> long<00:01:16.690> you<00:01:17.110> have<00:01:17.260> a

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:17.290 
no that'll take too long you have a

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:19.440 
no that'll take too long you have a
better<00:01:17.560> idea<00:01:17.650> there's<00:01:18.430> a<00:01:18.490> teleportation<00:01:19.120> grid

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:19.450 
better idea there's a teleportation grid

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:21.240 
better idea there's a teleportation grid
that<00:01:19.600> runs<00:01:19.840> throughout<00:01:20.140> halo<00:01:20.560> that's<00:01:20.979> how<00:01:21.190> the

00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:21.250 
that runs throughout halo that's how the

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:23.280 
that runs throughout halo that's how the
monitor<00:01:21.610> moves<00:01:21.790> about<00:01:22.000> so<00:01:22.240> good<00:01:22.420> I<00:01:22.720> learned

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:23.290 
monitor moves about so good I learned

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:24.990 
monitor moves about so good I learned
how<00:01:23.470> to<00:01:23.530> tap<00:01:23.800> into<00:01:24.070> the<00:01:24.190> grid<00:01:24.460> when<00:01:24.640> I<00:01:24.670> was<00:01:24.880> in

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:25.000 
how to tap into the grid when I was in

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.060 
how to tap into the grid when I was in
the<00:01:25.060> control<00:01:25.330> center<00:01:25.800> unfortunately<00:01:26.800> each

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:27.070 
the control center unfortunately each

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:29.219 
the control center unfortunately each
jump<00:01:27.490> requires<00:01:27.880> a<00:01:27.970> rather<00:01:28.240> consequential

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:29.229 
jump requires a rather consequential

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:31.890 
jump requires a rather consequential
expenditure<00:01:29.740> of<00:01:29.770> energy<00:01:30.540> something<00:01:31.540> tells<00:01:31.750> me

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:31.900 
expenditure of energy something tells me

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:33.870 
expenditure of energy something tells me
I'm<00:01:32.080> not<00:01:32.259> going<00:01:32.530> to<00:01:32.590> like<00:01:32.770> this<00:01:32.800> but<00:01:33.729> I'm

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:33.880 
I'm not going to like this but I'm

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:35.190 
I'm not going to like this but I'm
pretty<00:01:34.000> sure<00:01:34.150> I<00:01:34.300> can<00:01:34.390> pull<00:01:34.630> it<00:01:34.720> from<00:01:34.840> your<00:01:34.960> suit

00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:35.200 
pretty sure I can pull it from your suit

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:36.510 
pretty sure I can pull it from your suit
without<00:01:35.380> permanently<00:01:35.979> damaging<00:01:36.400> your
