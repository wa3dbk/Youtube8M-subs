00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:15.210 
or a little bit below the ice now you're

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.359 
or a little bit below the ice now you're
going<00:01:15.360> to<00:01:15.420> add<00:01:15.630> the<00:01:16.320> vanilla<00:01:16.470> extract<00:01:16.830> you

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:17.369 
going to add the vanilla extract you

00:01:17.369 --> 00:01:23.480 
going to add the vanilla extract you
over<00:01:17.670> did<00:01:17.820> a<00:01:18.000> teeny<00:01:18.360> tiny<00:01:18.780> bit<00:01:22.310> like<00:01:23.310> this

00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:23.490 
over did a teeny tiny bit like this

00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:27.440 
over did a teeny tiny bit like this
smidgen<00:01:25.430> and<00:01:26.430> that<00:01:26.729> really<00:01:27.000> makes<00:01:27.270> the

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.450 
smidgen and that really makes the

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:28.670 
smidgen and that really makes the
difference<00:01:27.630> it<00:01:27.930> makes<00:01:28.110> it<00:01:28.259> taste<00:01:28.380> really

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:28.680 
difference it makes it taste really

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.770 
difference it makes it taste really
sweet<00:01:28.799> as<00:01:29.369> it<00:01:29.640> like<00:01:29.790> it<00:01:29.970> really<00:01:30.090> makes<00:01:30.360> it<00:01:30.509> feel

00:01:30.770 --> 00:01:30.780 
sweet as it like it really makes it feel

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.200 
sweet as it like it really makes it feel
like<00:01:31.049> an<00:01:31.920> actual<00:01:32.189> milkshake<00:01:32.820> when<00:01:33.000> you<00:01:33.090> have

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:33.210 
like an actual milkshake when you have

00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.660 
like an actual milkshake when you have
the<00:01:33.360> vit<00:01:33.570> vanilla<00:01:34.229> extract<00:01:34.680> so<00:01:35.340> I'm<00:01:35.490> going<00:01:35.640> to

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:35.670 
the vit vanilla extract so I'm going to

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.160 
the vit vanilla extract so I'm going to
put<00:01:35.820> in<00:01:35.939> a<00:01:36.119> little<00:01:36.270> bit<00:01:36.509> well<00:01:36.689> not<00:01:36.840> a<00:01:36.869> little

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:37.170 
put in a little bit well not a little

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:38.300 
put in a little bit well not a little
bit<00:01:37.259> actually<00:01:37.380> it's<00:01:37.740> probably<00:01:37.860> going<00:01:38.130> to<00:01:38.189> be<00:01:38.280> a

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.310 
bit actually it's probably going to be a

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:40.819 
bit actually it's probably going to be a
lot<00:01:38.520> of<00:01:38.549> sugar<00:01:38.850> really<00:01:39.780> shouldn't<00:01:40.290> have<00:01:40.799> a

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
lot of sugar really shouldn't have a

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:43.130 
lot of sugar really shouldn't have a
sweat<00:01:41.159> sugar<00:01:41.490> self<00:01:41.759> you're<00:01:42.659> not<00:01:42.840> supposed<00:01:43.110> to

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:43.140 
sweat sugar self you're not supposed to

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:44.649 
sweat sugar self you're not supposed to
actually<00:01:43.259> we<00:01:43.619> can't<00:01:43.829> have<00:01:44.009> this<00:01:44.189> I'm<00:01:44.399> sorry

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:44.659 
actually we can't have this I'm sorry

00:01:44.659 --> 00:01:48.620 
actually we can't have this I'm sorry
but<00:01:45.659> so<00:01:45.869> I'm<00:01:45.930> just<00:01:46.110> gonna<00:01:46.259> basically<00:01:47.360> cover<00:01:48.360> it

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
but so I'm just gonna basically cover it

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.590 
but so I'm just gonna basically cover it
like<00:01:48.990> if<00:01:49.140> it<00:01:49.259> or<00:01:49.409> snow<00:01:49.710> like<00:01:49.979> that<00:01:50.420> see<00:01:51.420> that's

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
like if it or snow like that see that's

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:54.740 
like if it or snow like that see that's
quite<00:01:52.079> a<00:01:52.200> bit<00:01:52.439> of<00:01:52.560> sugar<00:01:52.970> section<00:01:53.970> probably

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750 
quite a bit of sugar section probably

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:57.440 
quite a bit of sugar section probably
too<00:01:54.930> much<00:01:55.520> so<00:01:56.520> now<00:01:56.640> we're<00:01:56.820> just<00:01:56.850> gonna<00:01:57.030> blend

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
too much so now we're just gonna blend

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.080 
too much so now we're just gonna blend
all<00:01:57.750> this<00:01:57.990> together<00:01:58.259> and<00:01:58.590> I<00:01:59.399> don't<00:01:59.880> know<00:01:59.969> how

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090 
all this together and I don't know how

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:01.760 
all this together and I don't know how
much<00:02:00.240> how<00:02:00.540> many<00:02:00.750> times<00:02:01.200> is<00:02:01.320> in<00:02:01.439> this<00:02:01.590> I<00:02:01.710> don't

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
much how many times is in this I don't

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.410 
much how many times is in this I don't
really<00:02:01.920> check<00:02:02.250> my<00:02:02.460> hires<00:02:02.700> but<00:02:02.880> if

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:03.420 
really check my hires but if

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.030 
really check my hires but if
measure<00:02:03.630> things<00:02:03.960> carefully<00:02:04.200> you<00:02:04.530> can<00:02:04.710> dine<00:02:04.860> it

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:05.040 
measure things carefully you can dine it

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.089 
measure things carefully you can dine it
and<00:02:05.250> know<00:02:05.340> okay<00:02:06.299> so<00:02:06.570> now<00:02:06.869> let's<00:02:07.500> put<00:02:07.680> it<00:02:07.799> in<00:02:07.950> the

00:02:08.089 --> 00:02:08.099 
and know okay so now let's put it in the

00:02:08.099 --> 00:02:09.550 
and know okay so now let's put it in the
blend<00:02:08.340> blend

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:09.560 
blend blend

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.920 
blend blend
mm-hmm<00:02:10.560> do<00:02:11.039> so<00:02:11.520> this<00:02:11.880> is<00:02:12.000> our<00:02:12.150> blender

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:12.930 
mm-hmm do so this is our blender

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:17.570 
mm-hmm do so this is our blender
it's<00:02:13.230> a<00:02:13.920> ninja<00:02:14.880> blender<00:02:16.310> didn't<00:02:17.310> use<00:02:17.400> any

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580 
it's a ninja blender didn't use any

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.070 
it's a ninja blender didn't use any
blender<00:02:17.940> that<00:02:18.090> you<00:02:18.209> had<00:02:18.390> that<00:02:18.690> you<00:02:18.750> really

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080 
blender that you had that you really

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.110 
blender that you had that you really
need<00:02:19.200> to<00:02:19.230> get<00:02:19.440> the<00:02:19.590> ice<00:02:19.770> to<00:02:20.069> be<00:02:20.190> fire<00:02:20.550> to<00:02:20.790> ground

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
need to get the ice to be fire to ground

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.030 
need to get the ice to be fire to ground
so<00:02:21.510> it's<00:02:21.660> kind<00:02:21.959> of<00:02:22.020> like<00:02:22.200> a<00:02:22.230> slushy<00:02:22.620> or<00:02:22.800> like

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:23.040 
so it's kind of like a slushy or like

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:25.370 
so it's kind of like a slushy or like
snow<00:02:23.400> consistency<00:02:24.239> so<00:02:24.720> the<00:02:25.020> better<00:02:25.200> the

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
snow consistency so the better the

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.979 
snow consistency so the better the
blender<00:02:25.709> the<00:02:25.860> tougher<00:02:26.310> it<00:02:26.400> is<00:02:26.520> the<00:02:26.670> better<00:02:26.989> for

00:02:27.979 --> 00:02:27.989 
blender the tougher it is the better for

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:36.500 
blender the tougher it is the better for
everything<00:02:28.500> in<00:02:33.080> and<00:02:34.489> then<00:02:35.489> that<00:02:35.970> you're<00:02:36.239> going

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
everything in and then that you're going

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:39.350 
everything in and then that you're going
to<00:02:36.540> have<00:02:36.810> to<00:02:37.050> blend<00:02:37.370> for<00:02:38.370> a<00:02:38.580> really<00:02:39.330> really

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:39.360 
to have to blend for a really really

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.170 
to have to blend for a really really
really<00:02:40.080> long<00:02:40.260> time<00:02:40.580> you<00:02:41.580> think<00:02:41.819> you're<00:02:42.030> done

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:42.180 
really long time you think you're done

00:02:42.180 --> 00:03:04.240 
really long time you think you're done
blending<00:02:42.480> you're<00:02:43.110> not<00:02:43.319> just<00:02:44.220> keep<00:02:44.370> going

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:04.250 

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:08.000 

and<00:03:05.720> that's<00:03:06.720> it<00:03:06.959> basically<00:03:07.200> keep<00:03:07.709> blending

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:08.010 
and that's it basically keep blending

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:10.009 
and that's it basically keep blending
until<00:03:08.519> you<00:03:08.849> can't<00:03:09.120> even<00:03:09.390> hear<00:03:09.690> the<00:03:09.870> ice

00:03:10.009 --> 00:03:10.019 
until you can't even hear the ice

00:03:10.019 --> 00:03:12.050 
until you can't even hear the ice
anymore<00:03:10.470> see<00:03:11.280> look<00:03:11.430> at<00:03:11.519> what<00:03:11.670> it<00:03:11.760> looks<00:03:11.910> like

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.060 
anymore see look at what it looks like

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:14.900

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:14.910 
it looks almost like ice cream and then

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:16.430 
it looks almost like ice cream and then
that<00:03:15.150> is<00:03:15.330> it<00:03:15.510> that's<00:03:15.750> how<00:03:15.930> you<00:03:15.959> make<00:03:16.290> a
