that you know within my own community

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.570 
that you know within my own community
sometimes<00:01:09.840> there's<00:01:10.140> people<00:01:10.439> that<00:01:10.470> that<00:01:11.010> don't

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:11.580 
sometimes there's people that that don't

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:14.179 
sometimes there's people that that don't
have<00:01:12.000> the<00:01:12.869> sense<00:01:13.049> of<00:01:13.260> humor<00:01:13.680> that<00:01:13.710> you<00:01:14.070> would

00:01:14.179 --> 00:01:14.189 
have the sense of humor that you would

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:16.340 
have the sense of humor that you would
hope<00:01:14.340> that<00:01:14.369> they<00:01:14.640> would<00:01:15.140> sometimes<00:01:16.140> that's<00:01:16.290> a

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350 
hope that they would sometimes that's a

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:18.200 
hope that they would sometimes that's a
cultural<00:01:16.799> thing<00:01:16.830> I<00:01:17.250> think<00:01:17.670> that<00:01:17.880> sometimes

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.210 
cultural thing I think that sometimes

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:20.440 
cultural thing I think that sometimes
people<00:01:18.479> that<00:01:19.140> come<00:01:19.350> from<00:01:19.560> the<00:01:19.830> Middle<00:01:20.040> East

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:20.450 
people that come from the Middle East

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:23.450 
people that come from the Middle East
where<00:01:21.450> respect<00:01:21.960> is<00:01:22.170> a<00:01:22.229> big<00:01:22.470> thing<00:01:22.710> you're<00:01:23.009> not

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:23.460 
where respect is a big thing you're not

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:24.770 
where respect is a big thing you're not
supposed<00:01:23.700> to<00:01:23.729> make<00:01:23.880> fun<00:01:24.030> of<00:01:24.090> certain<00:01:24.360> things

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780 
supposed to make fun of certain things

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:27.320 
supposed to make fun of certain things
and<00:01:24.990> certain<00:01:25.049> people<00:01:25.409> but<00:01:26.100> in<00:01:26.189> America<00:01:26.330> you're

00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:27.330 
and certain people but in America you're

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:28.999 
and certain people but in America you're
supposed<00:01:27.509> to<00:01:27.600> go<00:01:27.750> after<00:01:27.869> everybody<00:01:28.380> so<00:01:28.979> I

00:01:28.999 --> 00:01:29.009 
supposed to go after everybody so I

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.609 
supposed to go after everybody so I
think<00:01:29.100> sometimes<00:01:29.610> that<00:01:29.729> creates<00:01:30.479> a<00:01:31.229> little

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
think sometimes that creates a little

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.050 
think sometimes that creates a little
bit<00:01:31.710> of<00:01:31.829> a<00:01:31.920> problem<00:01:32.159> when<00:01:32.520> you<00:01:32.850> have<00:01:32.880> people

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
bit of a problem when you have people

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:34.100 
bit of a problem when you have people
from<00:01:33.210> your<00:01:33.360> own<00:01:33.509> background<00:01:33.900> they<00:01:33.990> get

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:34.110 
from your own background they get

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.170 
from your own background they get
offended<00:01:34.350> at<00:01:34.619> certain<00:01:34.860> jokes<00:01:35.100> and<00:01:35.369> I<00:01:35.909> think

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
offended at certain jokes and I think

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.330 
offended at certain jokes and I think
that<00:01:36.360> in<00:01:36.479> America<00:01:36.720> the<00:01:36.990> Americans<00:01:37.470> that<00:01:37.710> maybe

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:38.340 
that in America the Americans that maybe

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.590 
that in America the Americans that maybe
sometimes<00:01:38.640> I<00:01:40.700> would<00:01:41.700> say<00:01:41.820> the<00:01:41.939> Americans<00:01:42.030> that

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:42.600 
sometimes I would say the Americans that

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:48.170 
sometimes I would say the Americans that
that<00:01:42.869> that<00:01:43.590> see<00:01:44.280> my<00:01:45.180> shows<00:01:46.610> sometimes<00:01:47.610> a<00:01:47.850> shock

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:48.180 
that that see my shows sometimes a shock

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.249 
that that see my shows sometimes a shock
that<00:01:48.420> the<00:01:48.540> fact<00:01:48.780> that<00:01:48.869> there's<00:01:49.110> actually

00:01:49.249 --> 00:01:49.259 
that the fact that there's actually

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:51.380 
that the fact that there's actually
humor<00:01:50.220> in<00:01:50.310> our<00:01:50.460> culture's<00:01:50.850> a<00:01:50.880> lot<00:01:51.180> of<00:01:51.240> times

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:52.880 
humor in our culture's a lot of times
Americans<00:01:51.780> don't<00:01:51.840> even<00:01:52.049> know<00:01:52.229> that<00:01:52.470> people

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:52.890

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060 
hoping that with as the as the internet

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:20.660 
hoping that with as the as the internet
brings<00:02:18.060> more<00:02:18.569> and<00:02:18.720> more<00:02:18.840> people<00:02:19.040> into<00:02:20.040> the

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:20.670 
brings more and more people into the

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:25.430 
brings more and more people into the
conversation<00:02:21.350> that<00:02:22.790> the<00:02:23.790> that<00:02:24.300> that<00:02:25.020> people

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440 
conversation that the that that people

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:27.080 
conversation that the that that people
are<00:02:25.560> more<00:02:25.770> open<00:02:25.800> minded<00:02:26.430> with<00:02:26.610> things<00:02:26.850> it's

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.090 
are more open minded with things it's

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:28.010 
are more open minded with things it's
almost<00:02:27.300> like<00:02:27.480> I'm<00:02:27.660> just<00:02:27.810> having<00:02:27.959> this

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:28.020 
almost like I'm just having this

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:28.970 
almost like I'm just having this
conversation<00:02:28.230> with<00:02:28.470> somebody<00:02:28.590> else<00:02:28.830> right

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:28.980 
conversation with somebody else right

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:31.850 
conversation with somebody else right
now<00:02:29.010> it<00:02:29.250> feels<00:02:29.280> like<00:02:30.080> definitely<00:02:31.080> America<00:02:31.680> is

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:31.860 
now it feels like definitely America is

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.280 
now it feels like definitely America is
becoming<00:02:32.069> more<00:02:32.459> and<00:02:32.519> more<00:02:32.640> diverse<00:02:33.000> and<00:02:33.959> I

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:34.290 
becoming more and more diverse and I

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:38.150 
becoming more and more diverse and I
think<00:02:34.680> that<00:02:35.040> it's<00:02:35.340> hard<00:02:35.970> for<00:02:36.390> people<00:02:37.019> to<00:02:37.620> try

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160 
think that it's hard for people to try

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.330 
think that it's hard for people to try
and<00:02:38.790> maintain<00:02:39.360> an<00:02:39.900> old-school<00:02:40.680> conservative

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:41.340 
and maintain an old-school conservative

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:43.690 
and maintain an old-school conservative
mentality<00:02:41.940> on<00:02:42.030> anything<00:02:42.450> whether<00:02:42.780> it's

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
mentality on anything whether it's

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:48.830 
mentality on anything whether it's
people's<00:02:44.700> sexuality<00:02:45.390> or<00:02:45.420> race<00:02:47.060> immigration<00:02:48.060> a

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:48.840 
people's sexuality or race immigration a

00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.150 
people's sexuality or race immigration a
lot<00:02:49.230> of<00:02:49.319> these<00:02:49.410> things<00:02:49.470> so<00:02:49.739> I<00:02:49.769> think<00:02:49.890> that<00:02:50.040> I

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:50.160 
lot of these things so I think that I

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.190 
lot of these things so I think that I
hope<00:02:50.610> I'm<00:02:50.910> very<00:02:51.090> hopeful<00:02:51.360> that<00:02:51.450> the<00:02:51.630> future<00:02:52.019> is
