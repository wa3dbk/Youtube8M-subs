00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:11.050 
you see a large screen it's 3.0 inch

00:01:11.050 --> 00:01:15.210 
you see a large screen it's 3.0 inch
duck<00:01:11.560> to<00:01:11.830> WVGA<00:01:12.640> screen<00:01:13.090> and<00:01:14.040> color<00:01:15.040> is

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:15.220 
duck to WVGA screen and color is

00:01:15.220 --> 00:01:19.289 
duck to WVGA screen and color is
excellent<00:01:15.850> as<00:01:15.940> well<00:01:17.340> so<00:01:18.340> if<00:01:18.640> I<00:01:18.790> go<00:01:18.969> into<00:01:19.119> the

00:01:19.289 --> 00:01:19.299 
excellent as well so if I go into the

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:22.760 
excellent as well so if I go into the
menu<00:01:19.450> you<00:01:19.810> can<00:01:19.930> have<00:01:20.049> a<00:01:20.079> look

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:22.770 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:24.830 

so<00:01:23.250> the<00:01:23.400> menu<00:01:23.549> it's<00:01:23.850> just<00:01:24.060> the<00:01:24.240> list<00:01:24.450> manual

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:24.840 
so the menu it's just the list manual

00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.840 
so the menu it's just the list manual
but<00:01:24.960> of<00:01:25.020> course<00:01:25.290> you<00:01:25.439> can<00:01:25.619> also<00:01:25.890> download<00:01:26.399> or

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:26.850 
but of course you can also download or

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.120 
but of course you can also download or
customize<00:01:27.329> your<00:01:27.540> menu<00:01:27.869> in<00:01:28.470> whichever<00:01:28.770> way<00:01:29.070> you

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:29.130 
customize your menu in whichever way you

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.530 
customize your menu in whichever way you
like<00:01:29.549> I<00:01:29.869> would<00:01:30.869> like<00:01:30.990> to<00:01:31.140> show<00:01:31.320> you<00:01:31.350> the<00:01:32.540> music

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
like I would like to show you the music

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:46.430 
like I would like to show you the music
manual

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:46.440 

00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:50.760 

so<00:01:47.440> as<00:01:47.500> you<00:01:47.619> can<00:01:47.710> see<00:01:47.770> there's<00:01:48.159> a<00:01:48.340> nice<00:01:49.770> visual

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:50.770 
so as you can see there's a nice visual

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:54.240 
so as you can see there's a nice visual
effect<00:01:52.170> but<00:01:53.170> I<00:01:53.200> just<00:01:53.470> like<00:01:53.590> most<00:01:53.830> Japanese

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:54.250 
effect but I just like most Japanese

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:56.070 
effect but I just like most Japanese
phones<00:01:54.549> to<00:01:54.970> sound<00:01:55.270> coming<00:01:55.600> out<00:01:55.750> from<00:01:55.960> the

00:01:56.070 --> 00:01:56.080 
phones to sound coming out from the

00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:58.410 
phones to sound coming out from the
grills<00:01:56.500> is<00:01:56.619> not<00:01:56.770> very<00:01:56.950> loud<00:01:57.190> I<00:01:57.700> guess<00:01:57.970> it<00:01:58.300> might

00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:58.420 
grills is not very loud I guess it might

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:00.210 
grills is not very loud I guess it might
be<00:01:58.450> rude<00:01:58.780> to<00:01:59.380> have<00:01:59.530> brain<00:01:59.830> phones<00:02:00.040> that<00:02:00.130> are

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:00.220 
be rude to have brain phones that are

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:04.710 
be rude to have brain phones that are
too<00:02:00.430> loud<00:02:00.580> in<00:02:00.820> a<00:02:00.850> way

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:04.720 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:16.370 

so<00:02:05.720> I<00:02:05.750> know<00:02:06.140> I<00:02:06.170> would<00:02:06.500> just<00:02:06.680> start<00:02:07.159> the<00:02:07.280> camera

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:16.380 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:18.830 

so<00:02:16.920> the<00:02:17.130> sooner<00:02:17.490> th<00:02:17.850> way<00:02:18.030> lights<00:02:18.270> up<00:02:18.480> as<00:02:18.630> well

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
so the sooner th way lights up as well

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:27.610 
so the sooner th way lights up as well
and<00:02:19.850> you'll<00:02:20.850> be<00:02:21.090> able<00:02:21.150> to<00:02:21.360> see<00:02:21.570> how<00:02:21.780> I<00:02:21.810> use

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:27.620 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:31.470 

so<00:02:28.620> this<00:02:28.799> is<00:02:28.920> actually<00:02:29.040> an<00:02:29.370> optical<00:02:29.549> zoom

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:31.480 
so this is actually an optical zoom

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:39.100 
so this is actually an optical zoom
and<00:02:31.900> try<00:02:32.080> to<00:02:32.140> focus

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110 

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:41.140 

since<00:02:39.740> you<00:02:39.830> can<00:02:39.980> see<00:02:40.160> the<00:02:40.280> focusing<00:02:40.730> speed<00:02:40.970> is

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:41.150 
since you can see the focusing speed is

00:02:41.150 --> 00:02:43.780 
since you can see the focusing speed is
not<00:02:41.300> very<00:02:41.570> fast<00:02:41.900> it<00:02:42.170> takes<00:02:42.350> about<00:02:42.470> a<00:02:42.890> second<00:02:43.580> or

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:43.790 
not very fast it takes about a second or

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:45.490 
not very fast it takes about a second or
two<00:02:43.850> seconds<00:02:44.390> to<00:02:44.570> focus<00:02:44.960> and<00:02:45.140> then<00:02:45.230> another

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:45.500 
two seconds to focus and then another

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:58.300 
two seconds to focus and then another
second<00:02:45.890> to<00:02:45.920> say

00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.310 

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:01.260 

this<00:02:59.030> is<00:02:59.150> how<00:02:59.330> the<00:02:59.390> camera<00:03:00.200> menu<00:03:00.410> looks<00:03:00.710> like

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:01.270 
this is how the camera menu looks like

00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:04.950 
this is how the camera menu looks like
so<00:03:02.270> just<00:03:02.510> like<00:03:02.660> close<00:03:02.840> look<00:03:03.080> at<00:03:03.230> the<00:03:03.320> keypad

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:04.960 
so just like close look at the keypad

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:08.950 
so just like close look at the keypad
essentially<00:03:05.960> not<00:03:06.770> flat<00:03:07.190> at<00:03:07.430> all<00:03:07.550> and<00:03:08.540> the<00:03:08.720> keys

00:03:08.950 --> 00:03:08.960 
essentially not flat at all and the keys

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:12.880 
essentially not flat at all and the keys
are<00:03:08.990> well<00:03:09.590> spaced<00:03:10.660> and<00:03:11.660> here's<00:03:12.080> the<00:03:12.380> Jacques

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:12.890 
are well spaced and here's the Jacques

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:16.440 
are well spaced and here's the Jacques
bow<00:03:13.130> at<00:03:13.460> the<00:03:13.580> center

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:16.450 

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:18.060 

you<00:03:16.900> can<00:03:17.050> see<00:03:17.230> how<00:03:17.350> it<00:03:17.470> interacts<00:03:17.830> with<00:03:17.980> the

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:18.070 
you can see how it interacts with the

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:23.580 
you can see how it interacts with the
manual<00:03:19.920> typical<00:03:20.920> its<00:03:21.100> manual<00:03:21.520> then

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:23.590 
manual typical its manual then

00:03:23.590 --> 00:03:26.790 
manual typical its manual then
we'd<00:03:24.160> be<00:03:24.250> just<00:03:24.459> sliding<00:03:25.300> down<00:03:25.510> and<00:03:25.840> you<00:03:26.319> push

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:26.800 
we'd be just sliding down and you push

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:30.720 
we'd be just sliding down and you push
in<00:03:27.069> to<00:03:27.520> select<00:03:29.220> actually<00:03:30.220> works<00:03:30.400> pretty<00:03:30.489> well

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:30.730 
in to select actually works pretty well

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:32.820 
in to select actually works pretty well
just<00:03:31.540> that<00:03:31.690> the<00:03:31.810> menu<00:03:32.020> is<00:03:32.140> not<00:03:32.349> the<00:03:32.650> most

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:32.830 
just that the menu is not the most

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:36.830 
just that the menu is not the most
attractive<00:03:33.400> in<00:03:33.489> the<00:03:33.610> 905<00:03:34.180> I<00:03:34.239> series<00:03:34.900> and

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:36.840 
attractive in the 905 I series and

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:46.720 
attractive in the 905 I series and
button<00:03:37.840> response<00:03:38.290> is<00:03:38.530> also<00:03:38.770> not<00:03:39.640> the<00:03:39.819> best

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:46.730 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:50.210 

anyway<00:03:47.730> the<00:03:47.849> menu<00:03:48.150> of<00:03:48.420> the<00:03:48.720> NTT<00:03:49.620> DoCoMo<00:03:49.980> phones

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
anyway the menu of the NTT DoCoMo phones

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:52.550 
anyway the menu of the NTT DoCoMo phones
is<00:03:50.430> very<00:03:51.030> different<00:03:51.420> from<00:03:51.599> Softbank<00:03:52.290> phones

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:52.560 
is very different from Softbank phones

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:55.130 
is very different from Softbank phones
and<00:03:52.830> a<00:03:53.010> UK<00:03:53.340> DDI<00:03:53.580> phones<00:03:54.000> so<00:03:54.810> it<00:03:55.019> would

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:55.140 
and a UK DDI phones so it would

00:03:55.140 --> 00:04:09.559 
and a UK DDI phones so it would
definitely<00:03:55.470> take<00:03:55.620> some<00:03:55.830> time<00:03:56.069> to<00:03:56.220> get<00:03:56.340> used

00:04:09.559 --> 00:04:09.569 

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:11.629
