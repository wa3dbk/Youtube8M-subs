00:00:09.080 --> 00:00:15.230
 hello dear students, I'm fine, I'm 

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:19.189
 teacher rita and I'm going to build with 

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:25.270
 You even to the origami edition for that. 

00:00:19.189 --> 00:00:25.270
 People are going to need some squares. 

00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:35.090
 cases and 64 and fold the sheet in half 

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:40.010
 by the media crisis or to unite two sides 

00:00:35.090 --> 00:00:43.659
 Opposites with shishin fold sheet week and 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:43.659
 joins the two opposite sides 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:50.360
 It's ready, it 's fine. 

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:54.339
 We want to mark the bond here in the middle. 

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.339
 to bingo well mark said 

00:00:54.549 --> 00:01:02.809
 that's how we 're going to put a vertex 

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:07.490
 until that bond that we have just 

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:11.030
 being that angle here but already 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:13.130
 feel the vertex look good from Brazil 

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:17.120
 we will not join the old ones until the bond 

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:25.850
 that we just did, remembering well 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:31.010
 right this angle that will be ours 

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:34.630
 Let's unfold and join this side is 

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:34.630
 this bond that we just made 

00:01:35.110 --> 00:01:44.200
 to take care of and overcome the blockade 

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:44.200
 Sunday top looks good. 

00:01:53.790 --> 00:02:01.180
 we'll unfold and do the same 

00:01:56.860 --> 00:02:03.520
 thing to another there and have fun at that 

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:05.289
 the first bond we make the Pope and 

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:22.030
 have fun on that first link 

00:02:05.289 --> 00:02:26.190
 that we made to the first bank of 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:31.030
 breast milk to fold and mark the last 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:33.310
 so here to this last rich man that we 

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:38.709
 we just did it again we're not 

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:44.140
 repeating the steps and there on our sheet 

00:02:38.709 --> 00:02:47.920
 of paper to be filled with marquinhos and 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:52.230
 so we have here an angle 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.230
 divided in three parts here also 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:05.950
 continuing we will bend this side and 

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:08.500
 this side also that first part 

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:14.380
 We made the wine reminds us 

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:23.859
 will have and this format here ok let's go 

00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:26.290
 then double up to teach him grandson and 

00:03:23.859 --> 00:03:29.590
 to notice that we get a little tip 

00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:32.709
 here also from this point we 

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:36.519
 we need to bend that little bit 

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:39.549
 important double that bridge it 

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:41.319
 done let's turn again let's go grams 

00:03:39.549 --> 00:03:44.760
 folding kakÃ¡ 

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:48.370
 we are building the pockets 

00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:51.250
 let's remember once and now let's go 

00:03:48.370 --> 00:03:53.859
 doubling again like I said I 'll just go 

00:03:51.250 --> 00:03:56.560
 are you seeing that pocket that we 

00:03:53.859 --> 00:04:00.920
 we need to put this triangle inside 

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:05.440
 in this pocket this one of the brown and 

00:04:00.920 --> 00:04:09.290
 in the middle boy that quite right 

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:10.970
 Let's put it inside that good we know. 

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:17.840
 how important is it to make bric 

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:20.359
 people lose and put in the pocket of the jacket 

00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:39.200
 now we have an equilateral triangle 

00:04:20.359 --> 00:04:41.870
 with three good lashes i2 hello 

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:44.870
 after we make the triangle 

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:48.950
 we need to make the fittings 

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:52.610
 to join the triangles to form the 

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:56.690
 tetra is how to do this performance is good 

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:59.600
 we took a sheet of square paper 

00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:02.000
 the same size as that original sheet 

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:06.680
 that we did 

00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:11.289
 the triangle and we will divide but all 

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:15.680
 half actresses in four parts with 

00:05:11.289 --> 00:05:19.690
 folding perpendicular thing opening and 

00:05:15.680 --> 00:05:19.690
 folding the other measure frictions 

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:28.010
 we need to cut these 14 adds that 

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:28.940
 we now get four squares 

00:05:28.010 --> 00:05:33.250
 huh 

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:33.250
 flowers are not in the box so come on 

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:41.620
 we stay by andrezinho 

00:05:55.550 --> 00:06:00.090
 so we're left with four 

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:03.180
 Let's pick up little squares. 

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:09.090
 of these squares to double again the 

00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:16.740
 media crisis once you charge collect the 

00:06:09.090 --> 00:06:19.169
 other media trios unite the four 

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:24.960
 vertices at the meeting point of the media 

00:06:19.169 --> 00:06:36.840
 actresses and is well dobradinho not join 

00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:40.040
 very well 3 fold and now we 

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:40.040
 let's fold love 

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:53.820
 we have here our box with 4 

00:06:51.419 --> 00:06:56.580
 triangles and 6 inserts we go 

00:06:53.820 --> 00:07:00.539
 start setting up our foot for her 

00:06:56.580 --> 00:07:03.479
 14 years until then was the fifth in 

00:07:00.539 --> 00:07:05.970
 triangle and neither falls 

00:07:03.479 --> 00:07:12.450
 we will join another triangle by 

00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:18.110
 fitting and proceed similarly to the 

00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:18.110
 other triangles and incarnates 

00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:31.610
 note that the fittings enter the 

00:07:26.910 --> 00:07:31.610
 nice things we made ourselves 

00:07:32.510 --> 00:07:49.260
 evolving the easy of our trailer and in the 

00:07:41.490 --> 00:07:52.880
 last fitting easily last ready 

00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:52.880
 it is not in our time with him 

00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:58.770
 fraternal hugs
