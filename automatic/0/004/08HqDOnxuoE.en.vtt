00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:12.250 
considered a left-field choice

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:14.220 
considered a left-field choice
especially<00:02:13.150> when<00:02:13.420> I<00:02:13.480> was<00:02:13.599> announced<00:02:14.019> which

with what he's the massing for Catwoman

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:47.309 
with what he's the massing for Catwoman
I'm<00:02:45.579> sure<00:02:45.760> that<00:02:45.970> since<00:02:46.690> he's<00:02:46.900> so<00:02:47.110> particular

00:02:47.309 --> 00:02:47.319

most reasonable choice for Catwoman

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.650 
most reasonable choice for Catwoman

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:36.280 
like she's got that badass in her but

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:37.680 
like she's got that badass in her but
she<00:04:36.400> seems<00:04:36.580> a<00:04:36.639> little<00:04:36.760> too<00:04:36.910> soft<00:04:37.180> soaking<00:04:37.570> for

me<00:04:37.810> which<00:04:38.410> depending<00:04:38.979> on<00:04:39.070> Nolan's<00:04:39.460> vision

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:39.850 
me which depending on Nolan's vision

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:41.820 
me which depending on Nolan's vision
obviously<00:04:40.570> could<00:04:40.810> that<00:04:41.050> could<00:04:41.229> work<00:04:41.410> for<00:04:41.470> it

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:41.830 
obviously could that could work for it

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:44.300 
obviously could that could work for it
but<00:04:42.550> again<00:04:43.060> I<00:04:43.090> just<00:04:43.330> don't<00:04:43.510> think<00:04:43.660> she's<00:04:43.780> got

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:44.310 
but again I just don't think she's got

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:46.650 
but again I just don't think she's got
now<00:04:45.310> that<00:04:45.460> I<00:04:45.490> just<00:04:45.700> can't<00:04:45.850> picture<00:04:46.180> it<00:04:46.389> and<00:04:46.630> I

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:46.660 
now that I just can't picture it and I

00:04:46.660 --> 00:04:48.330 
now that I just can't picture it and I
think<00:04:46.870> that's<00:04:47.020> key<00:04:47.290> thing<00:04:47.560> and<00:04:47.830> out<00:04:48.070> of<00:04:48.190> all

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:48.340 
think that's key thing and out of all

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:49.680 
think that's key thing and out of all
the<00:04:48.490> six<00:04:48.729> I<00:04:48.910> think<00:04:49.120> Anne<00:04:49.240> Hathaway's

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:49.690 
the six I think Anne Hathaway's

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:51.870 
the six I think Anne Hathaway's
definitely<00:04:50.200> the<00:04:50.860> most<00:04:51.010> reasonable<00:04:51.400> choice

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:51.880 
definitely the most reasonable choice

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:54.510 
definitely the most reasonable choice
and<00:04:52.229> I'm<00:04:53.229> excited<00:04:53.560> to<00:04:53.770> see<00:04:53.800> what<00:04:54.039> his<00:04:54.160> take<00:04:54.190> on

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:54.520 
and I'm excited to see what his take on

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:57.510 
and I'm excited to see what his take on
the<00:04:54.580> infamous<00:04:55.360> cat<00:04:55.600> burglar<00:04:55.990> is<00:04:56.169> and<00:04:56.520> just

the infamous cat burglar is and just

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:58.950 
the infamous cat burglar is and just
considering<00:04:57.970> how<00:04:58.090> he's<00:04:58.120> reworked<00:04:58.630> all<00:04:58.810> these

00:04:58.950 --> 00:04:58.960 
considering how he's reworked all these

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:00.659

some<00:06:03.770> piece<00:06:03.889> of<00:06:03.919> like<00:06:04.160> CGI<00:06:04.550> or<00:06:05.110> no<00:06:06.110> prosthetic

some piece of like CGI or no prosthetic

00:06:06.710 --> 00:06:08.740 
some piece of like CGI or no prosthetic
application<00:06:07.280> which<00:06:07.880> considering<00:06:08.509> the<00:06:08.630> way

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:08.750 
application which considering the way

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:11.260

realistic take on it I really don't

00:06:13.340 --> 00:06:15.700

think<00:06:13.669> CGI<00:06:14.449> is<00:06:14.599> going<00:06:14.930> to<00:06:14.990> be<00:06:15.080> used<00:06:15.319> because

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:15.710 
think CGI is going to be used because

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:17.920 
think CGI is going to be used because
you<00:06:16.009> sneeze<00:06:16.370> every<00:06:17.000> time<00:06:17.270> he<00:06:17.389> had<00:06:17.479> used<00:06:17.720> it<00:06:17.870> in

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:17.930 
you sneeze every time he had used it in

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:19.060 
you sneeze every time he had used it in
the<00:06:17.990> other<00:06:18.110> two<00:06:18.229> films<00:06:18.530> it's<00:06:18.680> been<00:06:18.860> done

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:19.070 
the other two films it's been done

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:20.740 
the other two films it's been done
pretty<00:06:19.280> well<00:06:19.340> and<00:06:19.759> pretty<00:06:20.030> subtly<00:06:20.539> and

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:20.750 
pretty well and pretty subtly and

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:22.649 
pretty well and pretty subtly and
usually<00:06:21.560> for<00:06:21.740> things<00:06:21.919> that<00:06:22.009> you<00:06:22.190> know

00:06:22.649 --> 00:06:22.659 
usually for things that you know

00:06:22.659 --> 00:06:24.700 
usually for things that you know
there'll<00:06:23.659> be<00:06:23.690> a<00:06:24.020> much<00:06:24.440> bigger<00:06:24.620> understanding

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:24.710 
there'll be a much bigger understanding

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:27.100 
there'll be a much bigger understanding
like<00:06:25.430> the<00:06:25.580> UH<00:06:25.610> the<00:06:26.060> helicopter<00:06:26.539> trip<00:06:26.720> wire<00:06:26.930> and

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:27.110 
like the UH the helicopter trip wire and

00:06:27.110 --> 00:06:28.450 
like the UH the helicopter trip wire and
dark<00:06:27.289> night<00:06:27.470> and<00:06:27.650> whatnot<00:06:27.979> and<00:06:28.159> I<00:06:28.250> think

00:06:28.450 --> 00:06:28.460 
dark night and whatnot and I think

00:06:28.460 --> 00:06:30.490 
dark night and whatnot and I think
prosthetics<00:06:29.030> would<00:06:29.180> just<00:06:29.360> I<00:06:29.539> think<00:06:30.229> that

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:30.500 
prosthetics would just I think that

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:32.050 
prosthetics would just I think that
would<00:06:30.590> push<00:06:30.770> it<00:06:30.889> to<00:06:31.009> a<00:06:31.039> silly<00:06:31.370> level<00:06:31.759> almost

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:32.060 
would push it to a silly level almost

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:35.890 
would push it to a silly level almost
like<00:06:32.419> the<00:06:33.250> mr.<00:06:34.250> Hyde<00:06:34.460> prosthetics<00:06:35.120> from

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:35.900 
like the mr. Hyde prosthetics from

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:37.450 
like the mr. Hyde prosthetics from

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:44.080 
like damn this is silly as and it's
just<00:06:42.289> I<00:06:42.469> think<00:06:42.650> that<00:06:43.159> with<00:06:43.430> the<00:06:43.460> world<00:06:43.699> that<00:06:43.880> no

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:44.090 
just I think that with the world that no

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:46.839 
just I think that with the world that no
one's<00:06:44.240> created<00:06:44.690> it<00:06:45.409> would<00:06:45.650> not<00:06:46.039> work<00:06:46.430> and

00:06:46.839 --> 00:06:46.849 
one's created it would not work and

00:06:46.849 --> 00:06:48.879 
one's created it would not work and
that's<00:06:46.969> just<00:06:47.210> my<00:06:47.330> opinion<00:06:47.360> and<00:06:48.139> I<00:06:48.469> think<00:06:48.710> that

00:06:48.879 --> 00:06:48.889 
that's just my opinion and I think that

00:06:48.889 --> 00:06:50.890 
that's just my opinion and I think that
