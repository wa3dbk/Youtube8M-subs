so<00:00:09.059> we've<00:00:09.570> taken<00:00:09.750> this<00:00:10.080> monitor<00:00:10.530> that<00:00:10.710> they

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:11.120 
so we've taken this monitor that they

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:14.450 
so we've taken this monitor that they
serve<00:00:12.120> the<00:00:12.240> affordable<00:00:12.889> 799<00:00:13.889> price<00:00:14.130> point

would<00:00:14.580> be<00:00:14.820> made<00:00:15.059> two<00:00:15.299> iterations<00:00:15.809> of<00:00:16.049> it<00:00:16.109> so<00:00:16.320> we

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:16.410 
would be made two iterations of it so we

00:00:16.410 --> 00:00:19.370 
would be made two iterations of it so we
have<00:00:16.590> certain<00:00:16.980> proline<00:00:17.810> $7.99<00:00:18.810> and<00:00:19.109> then<00:00:19.260> we

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:19.380 
have certain proline $7.99 and then we

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:22.460 
have certain proline $7.99 and then we
have<00:00:19.590> our<00:00:19.980> think<00:00:20.460> vision<00:00:20.820> 28<00:00:21.720> smart<00:00:22.109> display

want to I'll actually cycle through and

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:58.389 
want to I'll actually cycle through and
move<00:00:56.399> off<00:00:56.640> the<00:00:56.789> display<00:00:56.940> or<00:00:57.420> it<00:00:57.510> over<00:00:57.809> to

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:22.789 
know so that's why we're calling in a
smart<00:02:20.760> display<00:02:21.120> because<00:02:21.900> it<00:02:22.019> gives<00:02:22.230> you<00:02:22.440> that

00:02:22.789 --> 00:02:22.799 
smart display because it gives you that

00:02:22.799 --> 00:02:25.729 
smart display because it gives you that
capability<00:02:23.340> of<00:02:23.970> you're<00:02:24.599> using<00:02:24.870> the<00:02:25.080> using<00:02:25.560> the

00:02:25.729 --> 00:02:25.739 
capability of you're using the using the

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:27.199 
capability of you're using the using the
device<00:02:26.010> after<00:02:26.280> you<00:02:26.610> don't<00:02:26.790> collect<00:02:26.940> all<00:02:27.180> of

00:02:27.199 --> 00:02:27.209 
device after you don't collect all of

00:02:27.209 --> 00:02:28.880 
device after you don't collect all of
your<00:02:27.299> peripherals<00:02:27.930> from<00:02:28.110> it<00:02:28.230> how<00:02:28.739> much

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:28.890 
your peripherals from it how much

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.160 
your peripherals from it how much
storage<00:02:29.130> is<00:02:29.370> on<00:02:29.459> internally<00:02:30.060> so<00:02:30.510> it's<00:02:30.690> a<00:02:30.780> 32

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:31.170 
storage is on internally so it's a 32

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:34.309 
storage is on internally so it's a 32
gig<00:02:31.849> flip<00:02:32.849> print<00:02:33.090> but<00:02:33.239> I<00:02:33.330> can<00:02:33.510> hang<00:02:34.019> off<00:02:34.170> the

00:02:34.309 --> 00:02:34.319 
gig flip print but I can hang off the

00:02:34.319 --> 00:02:36.020 
gig flip print but I can hang off the
USB<00:02:34.590> I<00:02:34.769> can<00:02:34.980> you<00:02:35.160> know<00:02:35.459> if<00:02:35.489> I'm<00:02:35.700> gonna<00:02:35.849> give

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
USB I can you know if I'm gonna give

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:38.509 
USB I can you know if I'm gonna give
harsh<00:02:36.269> or<00:02:36.630> extreme<00:02:37.080> content<00:02:37.739> movies<00:02:38.099> music

00:02:38.509 --> 00:02:38.519 
harsh or extreme content movies music

00:02:38.519 --> 00:02:39.199 
harsh or extreme content movies music
doesn't<00:02:38.670> really<00:02:38.849> matter

00:02:39.199 --> 00:02:39.209 
doesn't really matter

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:41.740 
doesn't really matter
yeah<00:02:39.420> because<00:02:40.140> we<00:02:40.290> have<00:02:40.440> multiple<00:02:40.680> inputs

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750 
yeah because we have multiple inputs

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:44.000 
yeah because we have multiple inputs
beside<00:02:42.750> we<00:02:42.930> have<00:02:43.049> noise<00:02:43.260> bees<00:02:43.530> and<00:02:43.799> we've<00:02:43.890> had

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.010 
beside we have noise bees and we've had

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:46.550 
beside we have noise bees and we've had
multiple<00:02:44.250> HTM<00:02:44.910> eyes<00:02:45.000> and<00:02:45.299> display<00:02:45.569> ports<00:02:45.930> off

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:46.560 
multiple HTM eyes and display ports off

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.710 
multiple HTM eyes and display ports off
to<00:02:46.829> the<00:02:46.920> side<00:02:47.099> as<00:02:47.280> well<00:02:47.400> so<00:02:47.459> you<00:02:47.790> can<00:02:47.910> put<00:02:48.690> your

00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:48.720 
to the side as well so you can put your

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:52.550 
to the side as well so you can put your
ps4<00:02:49.140> are<00:02:49.590> your<00:02:50.010> Xbox<00:02:50.489> one<00:02:50.900> other<00:02:51.900> computers

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:52.560 
ps4 are your Xbox one other computers

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.680 
ps4 are your Xbox one other computers
and<00:02:52.980> I'm<00:02:53.160> running<00:02:53.280> DisplayPort<00:02:53.940> in<00:02:54.090> off<00:02:54.329> of

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
and I'm running DisplayPort in off of

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:57.800 
and I'm running DisplayPort in off of
the<00:02:54.780> x1<00:02:55.079> carbon<00:02:56.000> multiple<00:02:57.000> USB<00:02:57.239> is<00:02:57.510> off<00:02:57.690> the

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:57.810 
the x1 carbon multiple USB is off the

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.500 
the x1 carbon multiple USB is off the
side<00:02:57.959> as<00:02:58.170> well<00:02:58.319> so<00:02:58.620> you<00:02:58.739> really<00:02:58.950> have<00:02:59.130> sort<00:02:59.340> of

00:02:59.500 --> 00:02:59.510 
side as well so you really have sort of

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:01.849 
side as well so you really have sort of
you<00:03:00.510> open<00:03:00.780> it<00:03:00.870> up<00:03:00.959> to<00:03:01.079> whatever<00:03:01.230> you<00:03:01.410> want<00:03:01.650> at

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:01.859 
you open it up to whatever you want at

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:02.830 
you open it up to whatever you want at
that<00:03:01.980> point

00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:02.840 
that point

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:04.869 
that point
so<00:03:03.080> if<00:03:03.140> you<00:03:03.260> have<00:03:03.530> something<00:03:04.190> hanging<00:03:04.489> off<00:03:04.730> the

00:03:04.869 --> 00:03:04.879 
so if you have something hanging off the

00:03:04.879 --> 00:03:07.030 
so if you have something hanging off the
USBs<00:03:05.330> they're<00:03:05.599> accessible<00:03:05.930> too

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:07.040 
USBs they're accessible too

00:03:07.040 --> 00:03:10.090 
USBs they're accessible too
