00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:51.909 
countries it firms up the flesh holds it
together<00:02:50.900> so<00:02:51.230> a<00:02:51.260> piece<00:02:51.439> of<00:02:51.469> fish<00:02:51.680> like<00:02:51.889> that

00:02:51.909 --> 00:02:51.919 
together so a piece of fish like that

00:02:51.919 --> 00:02:53.890 
together so a piece of fish like that
will<00:02:52.159> just<00:02:52.340> kind<00:02:52.819> of<00:02:52.909> berry<00:02:53.180> in<00:02:53.329> salt<00:02:53.599> for<00:02:53.780> 10

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:53.900 
will just kind of berry in salt for 10

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:55.420 
will just kind of berry in salt for 10
minutes<00:02:54.079> rinse<00:02:54.409> it<00:02:54.709> and<00:02:54.799> it<00:02:55.129> kind<00:02:55.280> of<00:02:55.310> really

00:02:55.420 --> 00:02:55.430 
minutes rinse it and it kind of really

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:56.589 
minutes rinse it and it kind of really
holds<00:02:55.699> together<00:02:55.819> how<00:02:56.060> big<00:02:56.239> the<00:02:56.299> pieces<00:02:56.569> that

00:02:56.589 --> 00:02:56.599 
holds together how big the pieces that

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:57.970 
holds together how big the pieces that
we<00:02:56.750> look<00:02:56.900> at<00:02:56.989> like<00:02:57.079> focus<00:02:57.349> like<00:02:57.469> that's<00:02:57.829> like

00:02:57.970 --> 00:02:57.980 
we look at like focus like that's like

00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:00.459 
we look at like focus like that's like
that's<00:02:58.040> almost<00:02:58.519> 4<00:02:58.730> ounces<00:02:58.939> yeah<00:02:59.719> so<00:03:00.260> again

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:00.469 
that's almost 4 ounces yeah so again

00:03:00.469 --> 00:03:03.610 
that's almost 4 ounces yeah so again
summer<00:03:00.739> smaller<00:03:01.669> portions<00:03:02.109> so<00:03:03.109> as<00:03:03.260> that<00:03:03.409> as

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620 
summer smaller portions so as that as

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:05.879 
summer smaller portions so as that as
that<00:03:03.859> fish<00:03:04.189> cooks<00:03:04.489> we're<00:03:04.639> actually<00:03:04.730> going<00:03:05.000> to

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:05.889 
that fish cooks we're actually going to

00:03:05.889 --> 00:03:08.080 
that fish cooks we're actually going to
put<00:03:06.889> on<00:03:07.010> the<00:03:07.129> plate<00:03:07.310> we<00:03:07.430> made<00:03:07.579> a<00:03:07.609> little<00:03:07.730> corn

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:08.090 
put on the plate we made a little corn

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:09.129 
put on the plate we made a little corn
pudding<00:03:08.269> so<00:03:08.540> this<00:03:08.659> is<00:03:08.750> kind<00:03:08.900> of<00:03:08.959> interesting

00:03:09.129 --> 00:03:09.139 
pudding so this is kind of interesting

00:03:09.139 --> 00:03:12.069 
pudding so this is kind of interesting
it's<00:03:09.500> simply<00:03:09.769> corn<00:03:10.010> juice<00:03:10.419> that<00:03:11.419> we<00:03:11.569> bring<00:03:12.019> to

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:12.079 
it's simply corn juice that we bring to

00:03:12.079 --> 00:03:13.750 
it's simply corn juice that we bring to
a<00:03:12.230> boil<00:03:12.439> and<00:03:12.620> the<00:03:12.709> natural<00:03:12.859> starch<00:03:13.280> is<00:03:13.430> thicken

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:13.760 
a boil and the natural starch is thicken

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:15.640 
a boil and the natural starch is thicken
so<00:03:14.180> all<00:03:14.329> that<00:03:14.540> is<00:03:14.569> is<00:03:14.870> corn<00:03:15.109> juice<00:03:15.260> you<00:03:15.409> can't

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:15.650 
so all that is is corn juice you can't

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:16.750 
so all that is is corn juice you can't
you<00:03:15.829> can't<00:03:16.069> finish<00:03:16.250> with<00:03:16.459> a<00:03:16.489> little<00:03:16.609> bit<00:03:16.699> of

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:16.760 
you can't finish with a little bit of

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.520 
you can't finish with a little bit of
butter<00:03:16.939> but<00:03:17.449> as<00:03:17.540> pure<00:03:17.780> corn<00:03:17.989> juice<00:03:18.169> kind<00:03:18.470> of

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.530 
butter but as pure corn juice kind of

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:20.020 
butter but as pure corn juice kind of
cook<00:03:18.739> down<00:03:18.889> and<00:03:19.220> it<00:03:19.519> kind<00:03:19.669> of<00:03:19.699> gives<00:03:19.790> you<00:03:19.909> that

00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:20.030 
cook down and it kind of gives you that

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:22.240 
cook down and it kind of gives you that
nice<00:03:20.239> nice<00:03:20.599> sort<00:03:21.409> of<00:03:21.439> luxurious<00:03:21.650> texture

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.250 
nice nice sort of luxurious texture

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:23.619 
nice nice sort of luxurious texture
without<00:03:22.400> any<00:03:22.699> fat<00:03:22.909> how<00:03:23.150> long<00:03:23.299> did<00:03:23.389> you<00:03:23.479> have<00:03:23.540> to

00:03:23.619 --> 00:03:23.629 
without any fat how long did you have to

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:25.420 
without any fat how long did you have to
simmer<00:03:23.870> for<00:03:24.049> really<00:03:24.349> until<00:03:24.680> it<00:03:24.889> depends<00:03:25.400> on

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:25.430 
simmer for really until it depends on

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:26.530 
simmer for really until it depends on
the<00:03:25.489> corn<00:03:25.729> really<00:03:25.909> depends<00:03:26.150> on<00:03:26.209> the<00:03:26.269> sugar

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:26.540 
the corn really depends on the sugar

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:27.939 
the corn really depends on the sugar
content<00:03:26.689> in<00:03:27.049> the<00:03:27.109> starch<00:03:27.319> content<00:03:27.530> but<00:03:27.799> pretty

00:03:27.939 --> 00:03:27.949 
content in the starch content but pretty

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:29.409 
content in the starch content but pretty
much<00:03:28.009> until<00:03:28.370> it<00:03:28.489> thickens<00:03:28.609> once<00:03:29.000> the<00:03:29.090> thickens

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:29.419
