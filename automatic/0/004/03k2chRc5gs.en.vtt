00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:47.760 
the United States yes how do they have a

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.400 
the United States yes how do they have a
worse<00:00:48.149> reputation<00:00:48.829> than<00:00:49.829> out<00:00:50.070> then<00:00:50.670> then<00:00:51.239> like

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:51.410 
worse reputation than out then then like

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:54.889 
worse reputation than out then then like
MIT<00:00:52.410> and<00:00:52.770> stand<00:00:53.039> well<00:00:53.510> so<00:00:54.510> it<00:00:54.570> could<00:00:54.750> be<00:00:54.780> that

00:00:54.889 --> 00:00:54.899 
MIT and stand well so it could be that

00:00:54.899 --> 00:00:57.470 
MIT and stand well so it could be that
maybe<00:00:55.440> MIT<00:00:56.190> is<00:00:56.610> getting<00:00:56.910> a<00:00:56.940> lot<00:00:57.059> of<00:00:57.090> credit<00:00:57.449> for

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
maybe MIT is getting a lot of credit for

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.529 
maybe MIT is getting a lot of credit for
like<00:00:57.870> their<00:00:58.280> studies<00:00:59.280> they<00:00:59.579> do<00:00:59.640> or<00:01:00.180> something
