00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.959
 they have been buried here for several 

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:06.150
 dozens of times at the lake sea ​​eye 

00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:08.780
 favorite object diving Kazan 

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:11.160
 extreme cold water 

00:00:08.780 --> 00:00:12.330
 sheer walls that is a diver if u 

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.639
 him something suddenly happens 

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:19.140
 he has nothing to cling to 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:20.640
 get up and there on the bottom 

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.500
 that is, this responsible wall is all up 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:25.400
 the very bottom, all problems should be solved 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:29.039
 there is deeper than 15 meters already complete darkness 

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:30.449
 that is, there are only lanterns and it happens 

00:00:29.039 --> 00:00:32.340
 all problems with visibility that is in 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.079
 different seasons 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.820
 there may be dependent on bathing 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:38.940
 maybe it depends on rain 

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.450
 from melt water is very different 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:42.030
 see 

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:43.590
 for it happened that visibility is so 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:45.719
 bad so what is the computer to mask 

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.270
 bring it and not see that in itself 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:49.140
 the lake there is very interesting beautiful 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:50.670
 walls 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.739
 responsible walls with interesting 

00:00:50.670 --> 00:01:00.840
 there is a relief there somewhere 

00:00:54.739 --> 00:01:03.180
 small burial here such here itself 

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.640
 by itself alone lake depth 

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.920
 then the first step to the verge spoke 

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:11.640
 already 30 meters such a sheer glass 

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:14.159
 then it goes beyond and another 13 meters 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:15.869
 into a glass with a diameter of about 15 meters 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:17.750
 which are these 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.790
 Christmas trees known to all 

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:24.150
 one tree on top was on 

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:25.920
 depth of 38 meters work at a depth of 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.290
 pitch dark at a little 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.360
 above zero such diving is more like 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.490
 on a journey into space and it feels 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.110
 already in preparation for the dive 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:36.090
 not to freeze under diving 

00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:38.759
 a suit is put on a warm suit and 

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:40.229
 wool socks balloon flippers mask helmet 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.329
 cargo belt gloves 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:44.549
 total equipment weight about thirty 

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:46.590
 kilos meanwhile ashore 

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:49.009
 gawkers are gathering locals from 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:53.009
 visiting people to look at the eighth wonder of the world 

00:01:49.009 --> 00:01:55.259
 Now here is the dirty and not knowing 

00:01:53.009 --> 00:01:57.240
 compare uhhh serve already save us and 

00:01:55.259 --> 00:01:57.719
 although it comes from here with the nearest 

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:00.810
 the villages 

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:04.740
 overeating left heard of course pressed 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:08.550
 beautiful but the fact that she became less of a game 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:11.069
 a dream and then we are sadly experiencing like so 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:13.739
 such a miracle may disappear 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:15.299
 beauty because however, not all 

00:02:13.739 --> 00:02:15.870
 share these quivering feelings for 

00:02:15.299 --> 00:02:17.700
 to nature 

00:02:15.870 --> 00:02:19.319
 most come to the lake to relax 

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:22.049
 and leaves behind the real ones 

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:23.939
 landfills before plunging into 

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:25.079
 water would be nice to get here 

00:02:23.939 --> 00:02:26.519
 divers turned to help 

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:28.560
 professional climbers 

00:02:26.519 --> 00:02:30.540
 water level drops weekly 

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.180
 locals speak since march the water is gone 

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:36.120
 12 meters causes shallowing until 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:38.819
 clear however the most obvious assumption 

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:40.169
 lack of flood this year by 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:41.969
 approximate data Mari 

00:02:40.169 --> 00:02:44.219
 exploration depths of sea lake 

00:02:41.969 --> 00:02:46.230
 the eye is now just over 36 

00:02:44.219 --> 00:02:47.909
 after a few minutes Kazan 

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:50.400
 divers will begin their dive and 

00:02:47.909 --> 00:02:52.500
 check it out their equipment allows 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:55.260
 sink to a depth of forty three 

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:56.790
 meters of diving on the lake sea eye 

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:58.709
 exciting procedures are recognized 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:00.419
 divers pond constantly 

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:02.969
 makes surprises and freelance 

00:03:00.419 --> 00:03:05.129
 situations after 26 minutes divers 

00:03:02.969 --> 00:03:07.379
 appear on the surface turned out to be without 

00:03:05.129 --> 00:03:10.219
 Adventure has not been, and this time all 

00:03:07.379 --> 00:03:11.340
 Equally had to make a lake gift 

00:03:10.219 --> 00:03:18.479
 the form 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:21.949
 1st st and it is given immediately because of the hands 

00:03:18.479 --> 00:03:26.220
 we all released here came out to 15 meters 

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:30.060
 visibility of the order of a meter after 15 meters 

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:33.269
 dropping a lot thirty three meters but 

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:35.819
 visibility was 15-20 centimeters 

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:38.090
 the bottom relief remains the same that is 

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:41.209
 and it turns out the lake was 43 meters 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:44.099
 about ten meters down here 

00:03:41.209 --> 00:03:46.859
 only when visibility improves 

00:03:44.099 --> 00:03:47.639
 You can go to study the walls most likely 

00:03:46.859 --> 00:03:49.769
 it's some kind of 

00:03:47.639 --> 00:03:53.639
 side siphon opened through which 

00:03:49.769 --> 00:03:54.139
 water is leaving the next or any heart 

00:03:53.639 --> 00:03:56.579
 loto 

00:03:54.139 --> 00:03:58.620
 it is now clear exactly the bottom of the lake is not 

00:03:56.579 --> 00:04:00.750
 changed through the opening gap 

00:03:58.620 --> 00:04:04.109
 the principle of communicating vessels lake 

00:04:00.750 --> 00:04:05.969
 go to the level of the neighboring reservoirs here 

00:04:04.109 --> 00:04:07.859
 this twig divers just raised 

00:04:05.969 --> 00:04:09.629
 from the depths of the sea eye lake and she 

00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:12.120
 is a reliable confirmation 

00:04:09.629 --> 00:04:14.419
 long-standing legends about what is at the bottom of the lake 

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:16.859
 so far there are three ate 

00:04:14.419 --> 00:04:19.139
 the lake sea eye according to scientists not 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:21.150
 more than 60 years among karst dips 

00:04:19.139 --> 00:04:23.909
 most of which are our republic 

00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:24.389
 over 20,000 years old it is just starting its 

00:04:23.909 --> 00:04:26.310
 pharma 

00:04:24.389 --> 00:04:28.379
 not well then what will happen to him 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:32.150
 further traced and show or skills
