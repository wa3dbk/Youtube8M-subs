00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.560
 alpha is considered one of the most 

00:00:02.429 --> 00:00:07.410
 important and promising forages 

00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:09.929
 today and stands out for its high 

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.660
 nutritive value and production efficiency 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:15.690
 dairy in Argentina and Uruguay is 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:18.350
 cultivated with good results so the 

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:20.939
 santa clara cooperative and emater ascar 

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:23.340
 encouraged the use of forage 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:26.430
 between assisted milk producers 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:28.410
 in the Rio Grande do Sul the good 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:32.040
 and productivity gains 

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:40.020
 exceeded expectations 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:42.899
 the spring and autumn critical periods 

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.660
 for milk production is the so-called 

00:00:42.899 --> 00:00:47.670
 empty forage season when we do not 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:50.100
 we have pastures, that is when we 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:52.680
 we harvest our crops 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.500
 grains and until the implantation of 

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:57.899
 we got an a with the 

00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:00.239
 our diminished passages to supply 

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.730
 nutritional deficiency without the 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:05.519
 increase in cost of production due to the 

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:08.549
 concentrates six producers of 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:11.640
 and are using alpha one 

00:01:08.549 --> 00:01:13.740
 perennial forage direct passage or 

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:16.409
 nintendo pretty much the opposite of 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:19.799
 other threads that all sound 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:21.479
 itu winter 160 it has that 

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.939
 24 month pass is very 

00:01:21.479 --> 00:01:26.970
 pasture is for this and other reasons that 

00:01:23.939 --> 00:01:29.880
 alpha traditionally used as 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:32.159
 hay in the feeding of horses comes 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:34.950
 conquering the milk producers of the 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:38.490
 due to its high nutritional value 

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:41.670
 which influences productivity, it is 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:43.790
 considered the queen of fodder 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:47.610
 we need more and more 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:49.350
 good passages and alpha it stands out 

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:53.850
 that at that point we'll coming 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:56.909
 on analysis leave with more than 25% of 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:02:00.090
 this producer and implemented 

00:01:56.909 --> 00:02:02.670
 alpha 2 years are imagine more 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:05.369
 property without this food as 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:08.220
 he has little land he needs to get 

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:11.129
 the maximum yield per area, which 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.780
 has been achieved with perennial forage 

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:15.750
 the offer of tickets 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:16.920
 even quality milk production 

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:19.350
 grow up 

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:21.930
 each cow there was an increase of 4 liter 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:25.350
 a day then seeing my first 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:27.300
 being small with the increase of these 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:28.920
 without the fake on the day how to support me 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:31.980
 but I think it made me unfeasible 

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:34.590
 such as 20 lactating animals 

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:37.440
 increase in production reaches 80 liters 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:40.410
 of milk per day and with a production 

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:42.239
 higher and a smaller expenditure is more 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:45.239
 money for the producer 

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:47.340
 I see alpha today as in a lot 

00:02:45.239 --> 00:02:49.890
 important in the sustainability of the 

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:52.590
 product of milk production of the 

00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:55.530
 today reached high productivity one 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:59.040
 good digestibility by reducing the cost and 

00:02:55.530 --> 00:03:01.590
 improving health to illuminate that of our 

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:03.420
 herd in the mountain range 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:05.730
 farmers are using the 

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:09.000
 creole variety that showed good 

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:11.190
 adaptation to climate and soil in 

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:14.400
 soil fertility in our region 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:16.440
 here with one working with limestone and 

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.060
 chemical fertilizer in fifa comes very 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:21.180
 There are no secrets about it. 

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:22.829
 long time i have that the intruder will take 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:23.760
 An excited account renato has a solo 

00:03:22.829 --> 00:03:27.510
 adjusted 

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:29.810
 having the analysis is and each type before 

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:34.260
 implement the analysis 

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:37.260
 alpha takes over and is barbado has well 

00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:38.160
 managed a planting can last up to eight 

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.230
 years 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:42.750
 despite the initial cost of implantation 

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:45.510
 of alpha being greater than that of other 

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:47.910
 long- term species, this cost and 

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:50.940
 diluted since the forage requires 

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:53.880
 only annual maintenance and no planting 

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:56.549
 on down family property but the 

00:03:53.880 --> 00:04:00.120
 two hectares of alfalfa are divided 

00:03:56.549 --> 00:04:02.790
 in 20 and I had to shepherd one hour 

00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:05.340
 at ease in this green capetine is 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:07.080
 sufficient for the 20 animals to be 

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:09.600
 satiated right? 

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:13.980
 area it only comes back when the passage 

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:15.930
 are established 78 times per year 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:18.900
 in winter a little less because of that 

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:20.489
 the because of the cold it grows delay 

00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:23.520
 more to grow and in the summer a little 

00:04:20.489 --> 00:04:25.170
 but then the appropriate time for the 

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:27.300
 lino stitches before and began to 

00:04:25.170 --> 00:04:30.180
 blooming higher yield at this stage 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:32.450
 thus rising 15 cm to about 10 

00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:35.190
 she has a bigger one and sprouts afterwards too 

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:37.680
 to take no risk with a 

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:40.740
 possible drought with the farmer 

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:42.780
 invested in irrigation irrigation 

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:45.630
 never have moisture in the soil. 

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:46.710
 her growth so I'm never without 

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:49.770
 alpha 

00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:50.580
 mauro also uses the do in the form of 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:53.850
 hay 

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:56.970
 already this other producer prefers to cut and 

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:59.850
 provide green mass in the trough with a 

00:04:56.970 --> 00:05:02.880
 area of two hectares rogÃ©rio 

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:05.580
 every day just the exact amount for 

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:07.800
 feed the 23 animals 

00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:12.360
 Why did you opt for this form of use? 

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:15.810
 her to give more income and for 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:18.419
 shops eat better because it has earned pastas 

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:20.730
 floor has quite hysterical and so 

00:05:18.419 --> 00:05:23.910
 put animals and what you do to 

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:26.100
 The cup bet was a chemical donation one 

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:27.000
 little of the liquid manure I 'm lucky 

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:29.820
 they produce them 

00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:32.940
 for rogÃ©rio alfa is synonymous with 

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:35.760
 dairy productivity protein and 

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:40.169
 yields around one and a half pounds 

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:43.590
 per square meter per cut himself gives in 

00:05:40.169 --> 00:05:47.100
 around 12 to 15 thousand kilos per hectare 

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:49.020
 she wakes up is considered an income 

00:05:47.100 --> 00:05:52.560
 good, very good, you 're crazy 

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:55.110
 few postings of income is very 

00:05:52.560 --> 00:05:57.960
 good is a food that stands out by the 

00:05:55.110 --> 00:06:00.229
 quality is enough in the production of 

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:00.229
 milk
