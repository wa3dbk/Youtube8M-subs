 very good everyone missed me xd me 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:54.100
 I already felt lonely without you well xd 

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:56.379
 guys today I bring you a little 

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:59.350
 How to enlarge the buttons to the tutorial 

00:00:56.379 --> 00:01:01.900
 drastik emulator for android d &amp; s 

00:00:59.350 --> 00:01:04.030
 It's already the third time that someone makes me 

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:06.700
 this question and I think it's good to explain 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:08.530
 how can we do this first of all 

00:01:06.700 --> 00:01:10.690
 I want to clarify that we are not going to enlarge 

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:12.909
 the buttons literally what we will do 

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:14.920
 is to increase the reaction range of each 

00:01:12.909 --> 00:01:17.770
 button when pressing them although we have 

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:19.600
 sunk a little away from your position of 

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:21.580
 this way we can have a better 

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:23.440
 gaming experience without having to 

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:25.870
 fail to sink a button 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:28.090
 ok first we open the emulator and a 

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:30.430
 game to experience then we put 

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:32.770
 the options of the emulator we are going 

00:01:30.430 --> 00:01:34.780
 where it says options then we give to 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:36.580
 virtual gain peace and there will appear 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:38.350
 many lower options 

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:40.540
 a little bit and these should appear 

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:43.090
 blue meters by default I think that they 

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:45.130
 must appear in one I have it in two 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:48.160
 because there is my right range for the 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:50.680
 buttons This is according to taste you 

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:52.420
 they move it according to their preferences they go 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:54.460
 increasing or decreasing the 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:56.680
 blue indicators and back 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:59.110
 until returning to the game and going to try 

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:01.750
 see how the buttons react and 

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:04.240
 alright guys that would be all it's nothing 

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:06.670
 complicated I hope it helps them 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:09.250
 this little guy we see in the 

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:11.110
 next by the way down here is the 

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:13.210
 emulator link just in case not 

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:17.070
 you have and I have also left the link of the 

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:17.070
 game that I used to experience
