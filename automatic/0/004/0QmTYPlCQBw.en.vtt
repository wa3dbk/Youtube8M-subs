 about 5 millimeters thick 

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:41.230

 Y 

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:29.729
 once you cut all the caps 

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:32.400
 take them to the slopes at least 20 

00:04:29.729 --> 00:04:34.639
 minutes like this when the kitchens do not lose 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.639
 the shape 

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:49.180

00:05:18.390 --> 00:05:23.820
 for the armed we spread the covers with 

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:26.010
 pastry milk candy do not use the 

00:05:23.820 --> 00:05:28.590
 common because when you bite him he must 

00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:31.390
