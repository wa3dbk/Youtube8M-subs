00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:00.820 
you don't like the hair tie but i think

00:01:00.820 --> 00:01:02.970 
you don't like the hair tie but i think
the<00:01:00.910> hair<00:01:01.180> tie<00:01:01.329> is<00:01:01.390> just<00:01:01.660> easy<00:01:01.870> and<00:01:02.200> if<00:01:02.380> you're

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:02.980 
the hair tie is just easy and if you're

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:05.480

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:05.490 
in a hurry you used to use that and then

00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:07.950 
in a hurry you used to use that and then
you<00:01:06.490> could<00:01:06.610> keep<00:01:06.759> the<00:01:06.850> bangs<00:01:07.090> up<00:01:07.360> or<00:01:07.630> whatever

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:07.960 
you could keep the bangs up or whatever

00:01:07.960 --> 00:01:11.039 
you could keep the bangs up or whatever
but<00:01:08.229> i<00:01:08.380> like<00:01:08.620> them<00:01:08.799> down<00:01:09.430> like<00:01:09.670> this<00:01:09.909> and<00:01:10.150> you

hair<00:01:18.640> but<00:01:19.000> you<00:01:19.180> didn't<00:01:19.540> go<00:01:19.720> through<00:01:19.900> jual<00:01:20.530> and

00:01:20.969 --> 00:01:20.979 
hair but you didn't go through jual and

00:01:20.979 --> 00:01:22.980 
hair but you didn't go through jual and
then<00:01:21.700> the<00:01:21.820> second<00:01:22.119> hairstyle<00:01:22.270> is<00:01:22.600> really<00:01:22.810> easy

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:22.990 
then the second hairstyle is really easy

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:25.200 
then the second hairstyle is really easy
just<00:01:23.290> take<00:01:23.470> a<00:01:23.530> headband<00:01:23.950> and<00:01:24.280> put<00:01:24.909> it<00:01:25.000> in

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:25.210 
just take a headband and put it in

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:26.580 
just take a headband and put it in
because<00:01:25.450> there's<00:01:25.659> not<00:01:25.750> much<00:01:25.900> to<00:01:26.049> do<00:01:26.229> a<00:01:26.260> short

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:26.590 
because there's not much to do a short

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:28.920 
because there's not much to do a short
hair<00:01:26.799> but<00:01:27.549> giving<00:01:27.940> a<00:01:28.000> cute<00:01:28.270> headband<00:01:28.720> just

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:28.930 
hair but giving a cute headband just

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:30.710 
hair but giving a cute headband just
makes<00:01:29.110> it<00:01:29.229> look<00:01:29.290> like<00:01:29.619> you've<00:01:29.770> done<00:01:29.799> something

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720 
makes it look like you've done something

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.940 
makes it look like you've done something
so<00:01:31.720> it<00:01:31.780> does<00:01:31.900> really<00:01:32.049> match<00:01:32.260> my<00:01:32.380> outfit<00:01:32.740> but<00:01:32.890> i
