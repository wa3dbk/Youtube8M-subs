them stick but now they have these new
wooden<00:02:59.900> ones<00:03:00.110> so<00:03:00.290> when<00:03:00.380> you<00:03:00.470> shoot<00:03:00.769> it<00:03:00.940> it

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:01.940 
wooden ones so when you shoot it it

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:04.509 
wooden ones so when you shoot it it
clicks<00:03:02.300> it<00:03:02.620> so<00:03:03.620> that'd<00:03:03.860> be<00:03:03.980> really<00:03:04.130> good<00:03:04.340> for

00:03:04.509 --> 00:03:04.519 
clicks it so that'd be really good for

00:03:04.519 --> 00:03:06.370 
clicks it so that'd be really good for
certain<00:03:04.850> custom<00:03:05.209> maps<00:03:05.480> for<00:03:05.720> certain<00:03:05.989> traps

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:06.380 
certain custom maps for certain traps

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:08.979 
certain custom maps for certain traps
that<00:03:06.650> goes<00:03:06.860> along<00:03:07.040> with<00:03:07.250> the<00:03:07.750> with<00:03:08.750> the<00:03:08.780> new

00:03:08.979 --> 00:03:08.989 
that goes along with the with the new

00:03:08.989 --> 00:03:11.920 
that goes along with the with the new
traps<00:03:09.290> they<00:03:09.470> have<00:03:09.650> with<00:03:09.890> the<00:03:09.980> trip<00:03:10.190> wires<00:03:10.930> so

00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:11.930 
traps they have with the trip wires so

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:14.110 
traps they have with the trip wires so
um<00:03:12.170> just<00:03:13.069> I<00:03:13.190> think<00:03:13.459> that's<00:03:13.610> just<00:03:13.790> about<00:03:13.940> it

00:03:14.110 --> 00:03:14.120
