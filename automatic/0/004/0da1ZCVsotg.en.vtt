00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.320
 Welcome to this is iphone 'user 

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:14.790
 dotcom and today I'm going to explain to you 

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.570
 very easy tutorial remember that this 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.860
 page you are going to see tutorials 

00:00:17.570 --> 00:00:21.689
 product reviews and so on of everything 

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:24.240
 what has to do with the 

00:00:21.689 --> 00:00:27.060
 bitten manzanita let's see something very 

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:30.060
 simple that is how to free the memory 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:31.680
 ram of a brand many times we start 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:33.840
 to open programs and open programs and 

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:36.600
 you close them and there are many things left 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.579
 there in memory that does not have why 

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.070
 be there and maybe the 

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:42.629
 memory has 2 gigs or has 4 gigs and 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.090
 is using very heavy programs 

00:00:42.629 --> 00:00:47.519
 maybe to edit video or something to say 

00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.769
 then the memory begins to fill up and 

00:00:47.519 --> 00:00:51.059
 you do not know where there are so many things 

00:00:49.769 --> 00:00:53.870
 if you have all the applications 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:56.730
 closed good in the app store there 

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:58.170
 several applications that can do 

00:00:56.730 --> 00:01:00.329
 this but find a very easy way 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:03.359
 that you have it there on your computer 

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:05.749
 in your mac and I'll show you how to 

00:01:03.359 --> 00:01:05.749
 make 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:15.390
 ok it's very simple you good start to 

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:19.850
 open applications maybe open is 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:23.460
 also this April find the app store 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:25.050
 the web of c's and its memory begins to 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.660
 fill up and fill up here let's see 

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:31.350
 how much memory does this computer have 

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:35.120
 it has six and eight gigs of memory in 

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:38.510
 this moment they have free 6 15 

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:39.860
 this is because I just made this will 

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:42.530
 I'm going to explain it from the I just 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:45.410
 do about 5 minutes ago then the 

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:48.080
 memory is already how it is like who says 

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:49.790
 inch what we 're going to do and already 

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:50.810
 is released but I will teach you 

00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:52.700
 how to do it 

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.690
 let's see probably going to lower a 

00:01:52.700 --> 00:01:56.330
 little bit of this, all the 

00:01:53.690 --> 00:02:00.650
 applications are open right now 

00:01:56.330 --> 00:02:04.340
 the free disk 6 gb 8 simply 

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:05.990
 they come here they end there are people who do not 

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:07.610
 like to use the terminal do not fear 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:09.569
 the terminal if you know that the cav 

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:11.999
 do 

00:02:09.569 --> 00:02:13.859
 open finished the terminal and simply 

00:02:11.999 --> 00:02:16.530
 they put on their axis 

00:02:13.859 --> 00:02:20.990
 so that this 

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:20.990
 really why you too 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:28.170
 says free 

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:31.080
 you have the process and it's probably going to 

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:34.290
 release a little as I told you 

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:36.180
 released 632 is not much because I just 

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.620
 to do it but try to do it yourself and 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:41.020
 This will give you an account the first time 

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:45.730
 who says it was like 

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:48.670
 I was not as in English as 4 thread 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:51.970
 and says that or how in like the 6 was a lot 

00:02:48.670 --> 00:02:53.740
 what released this simply for 

00:02:51.970 --> 00:02:59.320
 eliminate your memory 

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:59.320
 open terminal put for heretic 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:03.129
 it's going to free it totally for free 

00:03:01.599 --> 00:03:04.420
 they have to buy any application and 

00:03:03.129 --> 00:03:08.140
 download it 

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:11.129
 this was spread the dotcom and god 

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:11.129
 bless you very much
