the<00:00:01.770> fastest<00:00:02.429> way<00:00:03.230> even<00:00:04.230> though<00:00:04.350> I<00:00:04.380> wish<00:00:04.680> some

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:04.980 
the fastest way even though I wish some

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:06.829 
the fastest way even though I wish some
time<00:00:05.160> the<00:00:05.370> beginning<00:00:05.700> of<00:00:05.819> stuff<00:00:06.600> like<00:00:06.810> that

00:00:06.829 --> 00:00:06.839

00:00:06.839 --> 00:00:10.129 
time the beginning of stuff like that
but<00:00:08.120> knowing<00:00:09.120> where<00:00:09.240> everything<00:00:09.420> is<00:00:09.929> should

00:00:10.129 --> 00:00:10.139 
but knowing where everything is should

00:00:10.139 --> 00:00:12.290 
but knowing where everything is should
be<00:00:10.260> a<00:00:10.290> massive<00:00:10.800> help<00:00:11.010> and<00:00:11.639> I<00:00:11.759> should<00:00:11.940> still<00:00:12.150> be

00:00:12.290 --> 00:00:12.300 
be a massive help and I should still be

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:14.330 
be a massive help and I should still be
able<00:00:12.330> to<00:00:12.660> do<00:00:12.840> this<00:00:13.049> without<00:00:13.259> Michael<00:00:13.889> grumpy

we don't even need to waste time with
consoling<00:00:19.800> there<00:00:23.359> so<00:00:24.359> anyway<00:00:24.660> I'm<00:00:24.869> still

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109

katamari which is xbox game and I got

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.740 
katamari which is xbox game and I got
kind<00:00:38.129> of<00:00:38.280> a<00:00:38.399> negative<00:00:38.640> reaction<00:00:39.030> first<00:00:39.480> time<00:00:39.660> I

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:39.750 
kind of a negative reaction first time I

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:42.950 
kind of a negative reaction first time I
suggested<00:00:40.290> such<00:00:40.559> but<00:00:40.890> I<00:00:41.450> don't<00:00:42.450> think<00:00:42.719> it<00:00:42.840> is

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
suggested such but I don't think it is

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.380 
suggested such but I don't think it is
the<00:00:43.079> most<00:00:43.230> hardcore<00:00:43.770> violence<00:00:44.700> oriented

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
the most hardcore violence oriented

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:47.479 
the most hardcore violence oriented

catamaran<00:00:49.890> been<00:00:50.160> on<00:00:50.250> a<00:00:50.280> Nintendo<00:00:50.489> console<00:00:53.270> not

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:54.270 
catamaran been on a Nintendo console not

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:56.689 
catamaran been on a Nintendo console not
browner<00:00:54.690> metal<00:00:55.050> gear<00:00:55.260> solid<00:00:55.559> or<00:00:55.949> both<00:00:56.160> so<00:00:56.670> I

00:00:56.689 --> 00:00:56.699 
browner metal gear solid or both so I

00:00:56.699 --> 00:00:58.400 
browner metal gear solid or both so I
have<00:00:57.059> no<00:00:57.239> idea<00:00:57.449> what<00:00:57.570> that<00:00:57.600> new<00:00:57.809> ones<00:00:58.020> doing<00:00:58.230> on

00:00:58.400 --> 00:00:58.410 
have no idea what that new ones doing on

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:01.670 
have no idea what that new ones doing on
the<00:00:58.500> ps3<00:00:58.770> I<00:00:59.780> think<00:01:00.780> they<00:01:00.870> just<00:01:00.899> like<00:01:01.289> look<00:01:01.590> at

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680 
the ps3 I think they just like look at

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.080 
the ps3 I think they just like look at
the<00:01:01.829> existing<00:01:02.250> consciousness<00:01:02.760> on<00:01:02.940> the

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:03.090 
the existing consciousness on the

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.240 
the existing consciousness on the
absolute<00:01:03.480> worst<00:01:03.719> one<00:01:04.049> I<00:01:04.080> guess<00:01:04.290> the<00:01:04.500> ps2<00:01:05.010> was

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
absolute worst one I guess the ps2 was

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.010 
absolute worst one I guess the ps2 was
probably<00:01:05.580> the<00:01:05.760> most<00:01:06.090> fitting<00:01:06.479> when<00:01:06.689> it<00:01:06.780> was<00:01:06.900> on

00:01:07.010 --> 00:01:07.020 
probably the most fitting when it was on

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:12.740 
probably the most fitting when it was on
but<00:01:08.600> and<00:01:09.600> the<00:01:10.439> tree<00:01:10.830> of<00:01:11.450> don't<00:01:12.450> know<00:01:12.570> what<00:01:12.720> I

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
but and the tree of don't know what I

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:18.289 
but and the tree of don't know what I
want<00:01:12.930> to<00:01:12.990> call<00:01:13.170> it<00:01:13.200> free<00:01:15.380> Viva<00:01:16.380> miata<00:01:16.920> era<00:01:17.340> xbox

want to call it free Viva miata era xbox

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:21.800 
want to call it free Viva miata era xbox
360<00:01:18.960> it<00:01:19.049> did<00:01:19.170> not<00:01:19.320> really<00:01:19.619> along<00:01:20.189> there<00:01:20.490> and<00:01:20.939> it

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
360 it did not really along there and it

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.740 
360 it did not really along there and it
most<00:01:22.080> certainly<00:01:22.350> did<00:01:22.710> not<00:01:22.770> belong<00:01:23.310> on<00:01:23.670> the<00:01:24.450> ps3

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
most certainly did not belong on the ps3

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:31.069 
most certainly did not belong on the ps3
ever<00:01:25.970> it's<00:01:26.970> not<00:01:27.119> HD<00:01:27.420> or<00:01:28.549> dumb<00:01:29.600> I'm<00:01:30.600> pretty<00:01:30.900> sure

00:01:31.069 --> 00:01:31.079 
ever it's not HD or dumb I'm pretty sure

00:01:31.079 --> 00:01:35.370 
ever it's not HD or dumb I'm pretty sure
those<00:01:31.290> are<00:01:31.439> the<00:01:31.610> armature<00:01:32.610> ps3<00:01:33.180> games

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:35.380 
those are the armature ps3 games

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:39.240 
those are the armature ps3 games
there<00:01:36.070> we<00:01:36.250> go<00:01:36.840> and<00:01:37.840> that's<00:01:38.289> like<00:01:38.530> often<00:01:38.860> some

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:39.250 
there we go and that's like often some

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:42.959 
there we go and that's like often some
obscure<00:01:39.820> area<00:01:40.180> isn't<00:01:40.360> it<00:01:40.570> I<00:01:41.610> assume<00:01:42.610> this<00:01:42.759> guy

00:01:42.959 --> 00:01:42.969 
obscure area isn't it I assume this guy

00:01:42.969 --> 00:01:45.120 
obscure area isn't it I assume this guy
gives<00:01:43.270> you<00:01:43.360> a<00:01:43.450> one-off<00:01:43.869> or<00:01:44.079> maybe<00:01:44.380> he's<00:01:44.710> home

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.130 
gives you a one-off or maybe he's home

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:47.160 
gives you a one-off or maybe he's home
to<00:01:45.430> one<00:01:45.549> of<00:01:45.579> the<00:01:45.670> other<00:01:45.759> special<00:01:46.450> stage<00:01:46.750> blue

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:47.170 
to one of the other special stage blue

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:48.749 
to one of the other special stage blue
coins<00:01:47.500> I<00:01:47.770> kind<00:01:48.039> of<00:01:48.100> doubt<00:01:48.250> it<00:01:48.429> but<00:01:48.490> that<00:01:48.640> would

00:01:48.749 --> 00:01:48.759 
coins I kind of doubt it but that would

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:50.880 
coins I kind of doubt it but that would
be<00:01:48.789> nice<00:01:49.140> get<00:01:50.140> something<00:01:50.500> out<00:01:50.590> of<00:01:50.619> the<00:01:50.740> way<00:01:50.860> I

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:50.890 
be nice get something out of the way I

00:01:50.890 --> 00:01:52.889 
be nice get something out of the way I
guess<00:01:51.219> this<00:01:51.369> is<00:01:51.520> a<00:01:51.610> ten-point<00:01:52.149> part<00:01:52.390> no<00:01:52.600> woman

00:01:52.889 --> 00:01:52.899 
guess this is a ten-point part no woman

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:56.700 
guess this is a ten-point part no woman
