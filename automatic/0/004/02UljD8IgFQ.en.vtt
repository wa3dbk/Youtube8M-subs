 round 

00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:21.670
 see 

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:28.420
 and something else this game for me is already 

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:30.550
 practically gained because they have 

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:36.640
 zero cards 

00:06:30.550 --> 00:06:41.380
 then my turn I'm going to put here the 

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:43.570
 letter and I will spend another gain of 3 more 

00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:45.910
 here I have the cars that I change to 

00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:48.940
 score for him to collect but in this 

00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:52.150
 if I do not need it because the letters 

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:55.530
 He's at zero so I'm going to go and he's 

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:55.530
 There will not be any more cards. 

00:06:58.050 --> 00:07:04.259
 This is it, people did not serve him. 

00:07:01.139 --> 00:07:08.900
 No problem, it 's very easy there. 

00:07:04.259 --> 00:07:08.900
