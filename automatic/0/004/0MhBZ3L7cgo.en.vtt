we will move this review along so it is

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:02.840 
we will move this review along so it is
a<00:02:00.360> I<00:02:00.990> don't<00:02:01.619> want<00:02:01.740> to<00:02:01.800> say<00:02:01.920> it's<00:02:02.070> a<00:02:02.130> silicone

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:02.850 
a I don't want to say it's a silicone

00:02:02.850 --> 00:02:07.870 
a I don't want to say it's a silicone
case<00:02:03.210> but<00:02:03.479> it<00:02:03.600> is<00:02:03.750> a<00:02:03.800> softer<00:02:04.880> TPU<00:02:05.899> style<00:02:06.899> case

00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:07.880 
case but it is a softer TPU style case

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.570 
case but it is a softer TPU style case
silicone<00:02:08.880> in<00:02:09.090> my<00:02:09.239> opinion<00:02:09.979> it<00:02:10.979> really<00:02:11.310> feels

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
silicone in my opinion it really feels

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.000 
silicone in my opinion it really feels
like<00:02:11.700> it's<00:02:11.940> gonna<00:02:12.120> be<00:02:12.360> a<00:02:12.390> lint<00:02:13.380> magnet<00:02:13.860> and

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:14.010 
like it's gonna be a lint magnet and

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:16.310 
like it's gonna be a lint magnet and
this<00:02:14.280> is<00:02:14.519> not<00:02:14.880> so<00:02:15.330> as<00:02:15.480> you<00:02:15.660> guys<00:02:15.810> can<00:02:16.019> see<00:02:16.080> it's

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:16.320 
this is not so as you guys can see it's

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:19.940 
this is not so as you guys can see it's
got<00:02:16.470> a<00:02:16.500> nice<00:02:16.739> matte<00:02:17.310> finish<00:02:17.450> on<00:02:18.500> the<00:02:19.500> inside

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
got a nice matte finish on the inside

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.039 
got a nice matte finish on the inside
really<00:02:20.519> smooth<00:02:21.000> and<00:02:21.299> it's<00:02:21.450> very<00:02:21.720> very

00:02:22.039 --> 00:02:22.049 
really smooth and it's very very

00:02:22.049 --> 00:02:25.430 
really smooth and it's very very
flexible<00:02:22.760> so<00:02:23.760> let's<00:02:24.450> get<00:02:24.630> the<00:02:24.840> phone<00:02:25.080> right

00:02:25.430 --> 00:02:25.440
