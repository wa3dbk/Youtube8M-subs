scientists<00:00:24.630> finally<00:00:25.019> figured<00:00:25.500> out<00:00:25.560> that<00:00:25.619> dogs

00:00:26.089 --> 00:00:26.099 
scientists finally figured out that dogs

scientists finally figured out that dogs
can<00:00:26.490> sense<00:00:26.789> the<00:00:27.060> Earth's<00:00:27.240> magnetic<00:00:27.960> field<00:00:28.289> and

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560 
can sense the Earth's magnetic field and

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.679 
can sense the Earth's magnetic field and
they<00:00:29.220> prefer<00:00:29.580> to<00:00:29.699> poop<00:00:29.910> in<00:00:30.000> alignment<00:00:30.390> with
