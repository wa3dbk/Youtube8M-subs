of course global warming is a is a

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:56.060 
of course global warming is a is a
concern<00:01:52.740> you<00:01:53.430> know<00:01:53.580> if<00:01:54.510> it<00:01:54.750> was<00:01:54.900> it<00:01:55.200> was<00:01:55.860> too

00:01:58.880 --> 00:01:58.890 
cold then plants wouldn't live they

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.860 
cold then plants wouldn't live they
would<00:01:59.040> freeze<00:01:59.310> over<00:01:59.340> I<00:01:59.820> think<00:02:00.300> global<00:02:00.600> warming

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:00.870
