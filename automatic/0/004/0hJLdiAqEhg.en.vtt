00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:54.450 
shadows applied we can apply the

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:57.260 
shadows applied we can apply the
highlighting<00:03:55.260> with<00:03:55.470> white<00:03:55.920> in<00:03:56.700> the<00:03:56.850> opposite

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:57.270 
highlighting with white in the opposite

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:59.810 
highlighting with white in the opposite
areas<00:03:57.690> we<00:03:57.870> apply<00:03:58.200> the<00:03:58.340> shadows<00:03:59.340> just<00:03:59.370> to

00:03:59.810 --> 00:03:59.820 
areas we apply the shadows just to

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:02.810 
areas we apply the shadows just to
create<00:04:00.000> more<00:04:00.090> intensity<00:04:01.080> of<00:04:02.070> course<00:04:02.340> you<00:04:02.640> can

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:02.820 
create more intensity of course you can

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:06.890 
create more intensity of course you can
use<00:04:03.060> any<00:04:03.480> type<00:04:03.870> of<00:04:03.900> Prai<00:04:04.530> heaven<00:04:05.040> hand<00:04:05.900> and

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:06.900 
use any type of Prai heaven hand and

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:08.930 
use any type of Prai heaven hand and
then<00:04:07.530> we<00:04:07.650> can<00:04:07.830> I<00:04:07.860> give<00:04:08.190> a<00:04:08.370> little<00:04:08.550> more

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:08.940 
then we can I give a little more

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:10.670 
then we can I give a little more
intensity<00:04:09.540> by<00:04:09.780> applying<00:04:10.080> a<00:04:10.290> little<00:04:10.440> bit<00:04:10.560> of

00:04:10.670 --> 00:04:10.680 
intensity by applying a little bit of

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.530 
intensity by applying a little bit of
black<00:04:11.010> in<00:04:11.070> some<00:04:11.430> areas<00:04:11.790> like<00:04:11.820> the<00:04:12.150> hosts<00:04:12.360> of

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:12.540 
black in some areas like the hosts of

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:15.050 
black in some areas like the hosts of
the<00:04:12.600> cheeks<00:04:12.960> and<00:04:13.170> the<00:04:13.290> inner<00:04:13.470> poor<00:04:13.860> all<00:04:14.430> that

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:15.060 
the cheeks and the inner poor all that

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:18.289 
the cheeks and the inner poor all that
here<00:04:15.330> an<00:04:15.480> area<00:04:15.870> and<00:04:16.430> we<00:04:17.430> also<00:04:17.459> gonna<00:04:17.940> start

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:18.299 
here an area and we also gonna start

00:04:18.299 --> 00:04:20.990 
here an area and we also gonna start
creating<00:04:18.660> a<00:04:18.810> little<00:04:19.109> bit<00:04:19.260> like<00:04:19.640> dark<00:04:20.640> circle

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
creating a little bit like dark circle

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.300 
creating a little bit like dark circle
effects<00:04:21.510> and<00:04:21.690> infected<00:04:22.230> effect<00:04:22.650> with<00:04:22.920> a<00:04:22.950> pink

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:23.310 
effects and infected effect with a pink

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:25.700 
effects and infected effect with a pink
and<00:04:23.490> red<00:04:24.270> around<00:04:24.750> the<00:04:24.870> eyes<00:04:24.990> and<00:04:25.320> the<00:04:25.440> tudor

00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:25.710 
and red around the eyes and the tudor

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:29.150 
and red around the eyes and the tudor
area<00:04:26.810> you<00:04:27.810> could<00:04:27.990> also<00:04:28.200> intensify<00:04:28.860> a<00:04:28.890> little

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:29.160 
area you could also intensify a little

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:31.190 
area you could also intensify a little
bit<00:04:29.250> a<00:04:29.520> little<00:04:29.670> bit<00:04:29.850> their<00:04:30.120> shadows<00:04:30.570> off<00:04:30.900> your

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:31.200 
bit a little bit their shadows off your

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:33.320 
bit a little bit their shadows off your
face<00:04:31.470> look<00:04:31.770> the<00:04:32.070> marks<00:04:32.400> that<00:04:32.460> i've<00:04:32.670> done<00:04:32.850> and

face look the marks that i've done and

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:37.760 
face look the marks that i've done and
just<00:04:33.360> just<00:04:33.900> blend<00:04:34.230> it<00:04:34.470> really<00:04:34.890> nicely<00:04:35.250> i<00:04:36.530> use<00:04:37.530> a

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:37.770 
just just blend it really nicely i use a

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:40.130 
just just blend it really nicely i use a
bigger<00:04:38.100> brush<00:04:38.370> a<00:04:38.520> foundation<00:04:39.300> brush<00:04:39.419> to<00:04:39.750> blend

00:04:40.130 --> 00:04:40.140 
bigger brush a foundation brush to blend

00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:42.860 
bigger brush a foundation brush to blend
it<00:04:40.380> and<00:04:40.650> look<00:04:40.980> more<00:04:41.250> natural<00:04:41.700> and<00:04:41.880> then<00:04:42.750> I'm

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:10.570 
of the depth that we created we went to

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:13.710 
of the depth that we created we went to
this<00:05:10.690> tapeless<00:05:11.110> part<00:05:11.440> take<00:05:12.100> lash<00:05:12.790> glue<00:05:12.970> or<00:05:13.300> the

00:05:38.010 --> 00:05:38.020 
to stick on the staplers add a little

00:05:38.020 --> 00:05:40.350 
to stick on the staplers add a little
