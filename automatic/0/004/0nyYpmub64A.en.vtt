00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:07.529
 if we ancestors start saying this 

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:08.970
 also will be about privacy is also 

00:00:07.529 --> 00:00:10.320
 will be about a very very personal life 

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:14.240
 because my parents are people 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:16.440
 intelligent and they are not always right 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:18.180
 appreciate what is happening show business 

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.930
 not very difficult for them to explain ours with you 

00:00:18.180 --> 00:00:21.600
 laws 

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:23.760
 but for example what you tell them 

00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.470
 seem unfair because they 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:28.859
 I think that I am a good clever smart kind 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:31.140
 very good daughter of the country without parents 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:33.989
 I think that no other but it brought me 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:37.410
 who does not really respect your children you 

00:00:33.989 --> 00:00:40.739
 respect your swami I think that he 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:43.350
 the best boy on the planet is not me 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:46.140
 I have the right to be proud of your brothers 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.910
 there are children that is you have nephews 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.469
 we assumed that I have brothers 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:51.510
 Well, I read cyprus 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:54.390
 zhenechka everything you can read in 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:56.010
 open spaces of this great garbage I would on 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:57.930
 your place rechecked somehow 

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:00.500
 differently for an officer if i try 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:04.199
 it made the skills try there 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:06.420
 brothers musician level remove this 

00:01:04.199 --> 00:01:08.460
 question I would answer the court in the affirmative 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:10.710
 only if I knew exactly how my dad 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:12.750
 had fun in my youth 

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:14.580
 so no one is asking this question 

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:18.420
 recommends answering approve ie 

00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:20.670
 having a twin brother 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.390
 first time I hear a large group 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.509
 in contact with 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:26.060
 the writings are not my apparently group because 

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:29.579
 that recently one of my fans 

00:01:26.060 --> 00:01:31.439
 boasted that she killed 68 clones 

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:32.670
 in contact Lenn nameday can be you 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.470
 hit one of them 

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.030
 killed it means she wrote rock 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:41.009
 guys i'm a representative of england on not 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:41.670
 Do you want to get out and they cleaned away 68 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:43.799
 cleared out 

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:45.689
 because so many 

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:49.290
 face as you say celestron 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:50.579
 just analysis we start it is possible to understand 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:52.470
 then you have people on it 

00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:53.729
 gathered fans not only antiphants 

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:55.649
 there are antiformat 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.509
 here and you will be pleased as a person 

00:01:55.649 --> 00:02:01.110
 I would negatively relate to you 

00:01:57.509 --> 00:02:03.600
 I will talk about where did you get so long ago 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:05.009
 I know that I have my books 

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.329
 sold in popular departments 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.920
 psychology therefore some 

00:02:06.329 --> 00:02:08.539
 psychological skills and experience I have 

00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:11.450
 there is 

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:13.129
 so antifanaty indulges in the fact that 

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.659
 choose for example the dirtiest or 

00:02:13.129 --> 00:02:16.609
 Are the most deceitful the most critical 

00:02:14.659 --> 00:02:17.840
 Materials about me my exactly 50 

00:02:16.609 --> 00:02:20.150
 percent the remaining five percent 

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.609
 true but very important to know what it is 

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:24.230
 half true and here they raise 

00:02:22.609 --> 00:02:26.510
 indexing of these materials so that when 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:28.400
 finishing off any man with lazy Lenin 

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:31.790
 popped up at that minute till dirty 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:33.639
 the information is therefore not politically correct son 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:38.180
 known intent 

00:02:33.639 --> 00:02:39.639
 ironic but without sarcasm biased but 

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:43.099
 honestly 

00:02:39.639 --> 00:02:47.000
