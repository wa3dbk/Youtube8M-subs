of Dirk getting caught in a cage which
isn't<00:03:06.830> really<00:03:07.100> worth<00:03:07.220> mentioning<00:03:08.050> the<00:03:09.050> Black

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 
spikes and then hit right once more here

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:28.810

00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:31.250 
have to be really quick away from the

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:41.530 
have to be really quick away from the
fire<00:03:31.489> down<00:03:32.480> and<00:03:33.459> I<00:03:34.459> was<00:03:34.610> too<00:03:34.790> slow

00:03:41.530 --> 00:03:41.540 

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:43.030 

let's<00:03:42.540> try<00:03:42.630> that<00:03:42.750> again

00:03:43.030 --> 00:03:43.040 
let's try that again

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:54.080 
let's try that again
way<00:03:44.040> down<00:03:44.850> up<00:03:45.540> left<00:03:49.310> I<00:03:52.040> hate<00:03:53.040> that<00:03:53.220> room<00:03:53.490> that

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:54.090 
way down up left I hate that room that

00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:57.010 
way down up left I hate that room that
down<00:03:54.330> and<00:03:54.480> then<00:03:54.600> off<00:03:54.780> has<00:03:54.990> to<00:03:55.110> be<00:03:55.200> really<00:03:55.590> fast

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:57.020 
down and then off has to be really fast

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:00.890 
down and then off has to be really fast
and<00:03:58.020> this<00:03:58.380> is<00:03:58.470> a<00:03:58.500> new<00:03:58.650> level<00:03:58.800> set<00:03:59.480> this<00:04:00.480> sword

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:00.900 
and this is a new level set this sword

00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:06.470 
and this is a new level set this sword
right<00:04:01.290> at<00:04:01.350> the<00:04:01.410> beginning<00:04:01.709> is<00:04:01.920> tricky<00:04:05.480> but

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:06.480 
right at the beginning is tricky but

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:08.199 
right at the beginning is tricky but
after<00:04:06.810> that<00:04:06.930> this<00:04:07.110> room<00:04:07.290> is<00:04:07.410> pretty<00:04:07.530> easy

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:08.209 
after that this room is pretty easy

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:13.550 
after that this room is pretty easy
every<00:04:09.209> other<00:04:09.300> move<00:04:09.600> is<00:04:11.060> up<00:04:12.230> except<00:04:13.230> when<00:04:13.470> you

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:13.560 
every other move is up except when you

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:14.720 
every other move is up except when you
fucked<00:04:13.800> up<00:04:13.920> like<00:04:14.070> I<00:04:14.190> did<00:04:14.340> there

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:14.730 
fucked up like I did there

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:18.560 
fucked up like I did there
I<00:04:14.760> hit<00:04:15.480> it<00:04:15.510> too<00:04:15.660> early<00:04:17.030> and<00:04:18.030> here's<00:04:18.419> the

00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:18.570 
I hit it too early and here's the

00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:20.390 
I hit it too early and here's the
crumbling<00:04:18.959> bone<00:04:19.200> the<00:04:19.410> sequence<00:04:19.829> they<00:04:20.250> took

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 
crumbling bone the sequence they took

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:21.770 
crumbling bone the sequence they took
out<00:04:20.549> all<00:04:20.700> the<00:04:20.790> resurrections<00:04:21.390> for<00:04:21.630> some

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:21.780 
out all the resurrections for some

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:24.500 
out all the resurrections for some
reason<00:04:22.079> but<00:04:22.700> they<00:04:23.700> kept<00:04:23.850> the<00:04:23.970> crumbling<00:04:24.270> bones

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:24.510 
reason but they kept the crumbling bones

00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:29.659 
reason but they kept the crumbling bones
in<00:04:27.050> okay<00:04:28.050> since<00:04:28.500> this<00:04:29.220> isn't<00:04:29.400> really<00:04:29.580> a

00:04:29.659 --> 00:04:29.669 
in okay since this isn't really a

00:04:29.669 --> 00:04:43.810 
in okay since this isn't really a
repeating<00:04:31.250> let's<00:04:32.250> try<00:04:32.400> this<00:04:32.460> again<00:04:37.729> okay<00:04:40.460> huh

00:04:43.810 --> 00:04:43.820 

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:46.190 

this<00:04:44.820> don't<00:04:45.150> hit<00:04:45.330> it<00:04:45.360> too<00:04:45.570> early<00:04:45.630> and<00:04:46.110> you're

00:04:46.190 --> 00:04:46.200 
this don't hit it too early and you're

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:53.150 
this don't hit it too early and you're
fine<00:04:51.110> the<00:04:52.110> mud<00:04:52.290> men<00:04:52.440> are<00:04:52.680> completely

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:53.160 
fine the mud men are completely

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:54.710 
fine the mud men are completely
invincible<00:04:53.490> this<00:04:53.940> was<00:04:54.060> kept<00:04:54.270> up<00:04:54.419> during<00:04:54.570> the

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:54.720 
invincible this was kept up during the

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:56.540 
invincible this was kept up during the
short<00:04:54.930> run<00:04:55.050> cartoon<00:04:55.500> as<00:04:55.710> well<00:04:55.890> they<00:04:56.490> were

00:04:56.540 --> 00:04:56.550 
short run cartoon as well they were

00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:59.779 
short run cartoon as well they were
invincible<00:04:56.820> there<00:04:57.210> I<00:04:58.460> think<00:04:59.460> I'm<00:04:59.550> getting

00:04:59.779 --> 00:04:59.789 
invincible there I think I'm getting

00:04:59.789 --> 00:05:08.510 
invincible there I think I'm getting
close<00:04:59.820> to<00:05:00.120> the<00:05:00.210> end<00:05:01.789> this<00:05:02.789> one<00:05:03.090> I<00:05:07.340> moved<00:05:08.340> to

00:05:08.510 --> 00:05:08.520 
close to the end this one I moved to

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:18.280 
close to the end this one I moved to
early<00:05:08.729> again<00:05:08.970> dammit<00:05:09.470> I'm<00:05:10.470> getting<00:05:10.710> jumpy

00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:18.290 

00:05:18.290 --> 00:05:20.330 

note<00:05:19.290> that<00:05:19.320> this<00:05:19.530> game<00:05:19.680> actually<00:05:19.830> does<00:05:20.100> get

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:20.340 
note that this game actually does get

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:25.100 
note that this game actually does get
harder<00:05:20.790> as<00:05:20.910> you<00:05:21.030> get<00:05:21.150> further<00:05:21.300> into<00:05:21.660> it<00:05:24.110> the

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:25.110 
harder as you get further into it the

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:26.780 
harder as you get further into it the
timing<00:05:25.500> for<00:05:25.620> that<00:05:25.680> last<00:05:25.950> moves<00:05:26.250> there<00:05:26.430> as<00:05:26.550> make

00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:26.790 
timing for that last moves there as make

00:05:26.790 --> 00:05:28.070 
timing for that last moves there as make
sure<00:05:26.910> you<00:05:27.000> move<00:05:27.150> all<00:05:27.300> the<00:05:27.360> geyser<00:05:27.570> is<00:05:27.810> down

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:28.080 
sure you move all the geyser is down

00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:31.010 
sure you move all the geyser is down
that<00:05:28.650> should<00:05:29.040> be<00:05:29.130> fairly<00:05:29.370> obvious<00:05:29.820> and<00:05:30.020> the

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:31.020 
that should be fairly obvious and the

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:35.900 
that should be fairly obvious and the
river<00:05:31.230> sequence<00:05:34.190> may<00:05:35.190> actually<00:05:35.310> cut<00:05:35.640> a<00:05:35.670> part

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:35.910 
river sequence may actually cut a part

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:37.490 
river sequence may actually cut a part
of<00:05:36.000> this<00:05:36.120> out<00:05:36.330> there<00:05:36.570> was<00:05:36.660> a<00:05:36.690> boulder<00:05:37.110> sequence

00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:37.500 
of this out there was a boulder sequence

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:39.500 
of this out there was a boulder sequence
before<00:05:37.650> the<00:05:37.890> rapids<00:05:38.280> here<00:05:38.910> you<00:05:39.030> sit<00:05:39.240> off<00:05:39.360> when

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:39.510 
before the rapids here you sit off when

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:47.170 
before the rapids here you sit off when
you<00:05:39.570> get<00:05:39.690> into<00:05:39.780> a<00:05:39.870> lighter<00:05:40.080> water<00:05:41.750> easy<00:05:42.750> enough

00:05:47.170 --> 00:05:47.180 

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:49.820 

and<00:05:48.180> then<00:05:48.300> the<00:05:48.420> next<00:05:48.570> world<00:05:48.930> the<00:05:49.320> whirlpools

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:49.830 
and then the next world the whirlpools

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:53.800 
and then the next world the whirlpools
this<00:05:50.010> just<00:05:50.220> move<00:05:50.610> away<00:05:50.880> from<00:05:51.330> the<00:05:51.420> whirlpool

00:05:53.800 --> 00:05:53.810 

00:05:53.810 --> 00:05:57.980 

which<00:05:54.810> is<00:05:55.050> pretty<00:05:55.740> boring<00:05:56.420> and<00:05:57.420> then<00:05:57.660> after

00:05:57.980 --> 00:05:57.990 
which is pretty boring and then after

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:02.500 
which is pretty boring and then after
the<00:05:58.080> whirlpools<00:05:58.500> there<00:05:58.770> is<00:05:58.860> one<00:05:59.100> last<00:05:59.340> move

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:02.510 

00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:12.879 

which<00:06:03.510> is<00:06:03.860> grab<00:06:04.860> the<00:06:05.010> chain

00:06:12.879 --> 00:06:12.889 

00:06:12.889 --> 00:06:16.330 

and<00:06:13.639> guess<00:06:13.939> what<00:06:14.180> goons<00:06:14.860> you've<00:06:15.860> made<00:06:16.099> it<00:06:16.219> to

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:16.340 
and guess what goons you've made it to

00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:17.409 
and guess what goons you've made it to
the<00:06:16.430> dragon's<00:06:16.879> lair
