00:00:22.480 --> 00:00:27.070
 hello good I am the priest n4 and with this 

00:00:25.090 --> 00:00:29.080
 I'm going to show you how to make a video 

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:32.050
 pendrive that speaks with which we can 

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:35.050
 install windows xp on our machine 

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:37.230
 no need to use any CD or 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:37.230
 DVD 

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:43.090
 and we go to google 

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:48.680
 browser 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:53.680
 and we put 

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:53.680
 and download windows flash 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:57.489
 that is going to be the program that we are going to 

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:57.489
 use 

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:06.190
 completely free 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:06.190
 in Spanish 

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:11.220
 well, we download 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:17.670
 and here instead of giving the download 

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:20.070
 free of softonic we give here 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.020
 below it puts you alternative download of 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:25.430
 windows flash 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:28.280
 that if we give to the other will not want 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:30.500
 install a bar until they get 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:33.130
 here in the browser and it bothers me 

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:33.130
 quite the truth 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:36.480
 we accept 

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.470
 branch that is downloaded 

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:49.470
 and well this we are going to close it 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.170
 on desk 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:11.490
 with all that in the description of the video 

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:15.330
 leave the links 

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:17.790
 that are needed to download it for 

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:20.360
 that you do not have to go around 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.360
 looking for him 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:27.100
 we will use this and in my case I 

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:29.260
 I use daemon tools and then 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:33.840
 mount the image 

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:36.790
 of windows well we have this ready 

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:40.410
 we go to the folder where it has been 

00:02:36.790 --> 00:02:42.630
 saved open container folder 

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:44.960
 and here we have it, let's get it out here 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:44.960
 outside 

00:02:45.970 --> 00:02:50.860
 and good 

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:50.860
 we unpack it 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:57.540
 here in extract in novi cut 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:03:01.590
 how old is a folder with the same 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:04.290
 name where inside we will have all 

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:07.730
 these files 

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:12.409
 and here below windsurfing the 

00:03:07.730 --> 00:03:12.409
 we execute and here we have it 

00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:23.990
 and now you put 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:27.340
 we give you next 

00:03:23.990 --> 00:03:27.340
 we accept the terms 

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:45.800
 also and here if we give advanced 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:58.120
 we can disable this option 

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:58.120
 that I do not think it's necessary for anything 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:01.760
 and we give next 

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:11.510
 here as you see we do not have everything in English 

00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:13.879
 that is easy to change 

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:15.180
 look here where he puts the language here 

00:04:13.879 --> 00:04:17.780
 down 

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:20.060
 we click and here 

00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:23.570
 we have a little eyelash where we get 

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:24.560
 all the languages available for this 

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:28.410
 Program 

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:31.140
 we look for traditional spanish pandas 

00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:35.150
 Castilians and we give you to apply 

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:35.150
 then we are ok 

00:04:36.249 --> 00:04:41.830
 and we already have our program 

00:04:38.789 --> 00:04:45.510
 completely in Spanish 

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:50.350
 and where he puts homework in the kind of tasks 

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:53.910
 here as in my case we are going to make a 

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:56.290
 pendrive you talk with a windows xp 

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:58.440
 we puncture this that in fact brings it 

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:59.860
 default 

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:03.990
 Y 

00:04:59.860 --> 00:05:03.990
 we are here in the tic this 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:13.150
 we give it to next one we will leave this 

00:05:08.629 --> 00:05:15.650
 window where the route will go where 

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:18.550
 we have saved the image made of 

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:18.550
 OS 

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:25.730
 we look for it in the folder where 

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:28.700
 have kept me in this case what 

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:32.590
 I have mounted a virtual unit with 

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:35.140
 daemon tour I will also put it 

00:05:32.590 --> 00:05:37.840
 the link in the description so that the 

00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:40.180
 downloads if you do not have to do it 

00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:43.320
 so you can also 

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:43.320
 It can be done through 

00:05:44.139 --> 00:05:50.050
 we go more normalitos with decompress the 

00:05:47.740 --> 00:05:53.039
 image made with the winrar and put it in 

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:53.039
 a folder is also worth 

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:56.700
 h 

00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:06.400
 we accept and open and the usb drive 

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:06.400
 Well, we're going to team 

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:16.500
 removable disk drive f 

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:20.850
 will already have 4 GB so the space 

00:06:16.500 --> 00:06:23.070
 enough since the image made from here 

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:25.830
 worried 

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:28.350
 at less than 700 megabytes 

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:30.860
 that is important that you always do 

00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:34.300
 with a pendrive 

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:34.300
 they connected enough 

00:06:34.370 --> 00:06:40.040
 here we accept all the terms of the 

00:06:36.650 --> 00:06:43.100
 agreements and we continue we get this 

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:45.080
 message warning message where we 

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:46.460
 indicates that formatting will erase all 

00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:49.520
 data of the destination unit that is 

00:06:46.460 --> 00:06:51.760
 our pendrive will stay clean or 

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:53.600
 if you want to save some file 

00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:57.960
 important because he has forgotten 

00:06:53.600 --> 00:07:01.340
 take a folder on our computer 

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:01.340
 before doing this operation 

00:07:01.449 --> 00:07:08.440
 and ready 

00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:08.440
 and well here we give ok 

00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:15.310
 and it starts 

00:07:13.090 --> 00:07:18.449
 the program 

00:07:15.310 --> 00:07:20.460
 to transfer the data of 

00:07:18.449 --> 00:07:22.999
 of the operating system within our 

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:22.999
 pendrive 

00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:28.870
 well then once the 

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:31.050
 file transfer 

00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:35.290
 we have practically finished 

00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:36.730
 we give next comes this window we 

00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:38.830
 warns that some computers 

00:07:36.730 --> 00:07:41.800
 especially older ones that 

00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:43.350
 You can not be bootable of 

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:45.270
 flash 

00:07:43.350 --> 00:07:47.750
 and nothing 

00:07:45.270 --> 00:07:50.660
 we left the program 

00:07:47.750 --> 00:07:52.600
 and we go to the computer and 

00:07:50.660 --> 00:07:55.169
 we check if the files are 

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:58.310
 effectively here they are 

00:07:55.169 --> 00:08:01.160
 and good you are 

00:07:58.310 --> 00:08:03.410
 up here we get that's all I hope 

00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:06.590
 that you liked it has been of 

00:08:03.410 --> 00:08:09.130
 utility and nothing a like if you want and 

00:08:06.590 --> 00:08:09.130
 until next time
