00:03:16.580 --> 00:03:20.650 
movie so this is my Vietnam movie kind
of<00:03:16.700> you<00:03:17.120> know<00:03:18.490> yeah<00:03:19.490> this<00:03:19.730> takes<00:03:20.000> it<00:03:20.330> to<00:03:20.630> a

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:20.660 
of you know yeah this takes it to a

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:24.810 
of you know yeah this takes it to a
whole<00:03:20.780> a<00:03:21.580> whole<00:03:22.810> new<00:03:23.810> level

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:24.820 
whole a whole new level

00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:30.040 
whole a whole new level
with<00:03:25.820> the<00:03:25.970> black<00:03:26.180> ops<00:03:26.450> and<00:03:28.030> it<00:03:29.030> is<00:03:29.180> more<00:03:29.480> it's<00:03:29.930> a

00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:30.050 
with the black ops and it is more it's a

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:34.330 
with the black ops and it is more it's a
more<00:03:30.260> sophisticated<00:03:30.590> game<00:03:31.250> I<00:03:31.460> think<00:03:33.160> it's<00:03:34.160> a

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:34.340 
more sophisticated game I think it's a

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:39.460 
more sophisticated game I think it's a
labyrinth<00:03:34.820> of<00:03:35.680> a<00:03:36.680> story<00:03:37.010> I<00:03:37.870> mean<00:03:38.870> it<00:03:39.020> and<00:03:39.140> doing

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:39.470 
labyrinth of a story I mean it and doing

00:03:39.470 --> 00:03:41.350 
labyrinth of a story I mean it and doing
it<00:03:39.560> and<00:03:39.710> I'm<00:03:39.830> not<00:03:40.280> sure<00:03:40.490> the<00:03:40.700> outcome<00:03:41.090> they've

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:41.360 
it and I'm not sure the outcome they've

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:43.840 
it and I'm not sure the outcome they've
tried<00:03:41.570> to<00:03:41.630> it<00:03:41.810> matrix<00:03:42.370> explained<00:03:43.370> it<00:03:43.550> to<00:03:43.580> me

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:43.850 
tried to it matrix explained it to me

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:47.590 
tried to it matrix explained it to me
and<00:03:44.060> it's<00:03:44.270> and<00:03:44.600> it's<00:03:44.720> it's<00:03:45.260> very<00:03:45.620> very<00:03:46.600> it's

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:47.600 
and it's and it's it's very very it's

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:52.270 
and it's and it's it's very very it's
not<00:03:47.630> confusing<00:03:48.260> it's<00:03:48.620> just<00:03:48.830> it's<00:03:49.280> complex<00:03:51.280> but

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:52.280 
not confusing it's just it's complex but

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:57.370 
not confusing it's just it's complex but
I<00:03:52.340> think<00:03:52.430> that<00:03:52.880> the<00:03:52.970> players<00:03:53.800> are<00:03:56.380> becoming

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:57.380 
I think that the players are becoming

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:03.850 
I think that the players are becoming
more<00:03:57.650> sophisticated<00:04:00.400> and<00:04:02.530> at<00:04:03.530> a<00:04:03.560> young<00:04:03.650> age

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:03.860 
more sophisticated and at a young age

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:08.410 
more sophisticated and at a young age
and<00:04:04.430> I<00:04:05.090> think<00:04:05.360> that<00:04:05.540> they<00:04:05.660> demand<00:04:07.060> they<00:04:08.060> demand

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:08.420 
and I think that they demand they demand

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:11.420 
and I think that they demand they demand
more<00:04:08.660> from<00:04:08.720> the<00:04:09.050> game

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.430 

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:15.720 

with<00:04:12.430> this<00:04:12.580> new<00:04:13.260> Call<00:04:14.260> of<00:04:14.290> Duty<00:04:14.740> they've<00:04:15.490> upped

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:15.730 
with this new Call of Duty they've upped

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:18.510 
with this new Call of Duty they've upped
the<00:04:15.850> ante<00:04:16.240> our<00:04:16.840> thinking<00:04:17.290> both<00:04:17.500> in<00:04:17.920> both<00:04:18.160> the

00:04:18.510 --> 00:04:18.520 
the ante our thinking both in both the

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:22.530 
the ante our thinking both in both the
narrative<00:04:19.000> the<00:04:19.570> story<00:04:19.600> and<00:04:20.640> and<00:04:21.640> also

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:22.540 
narrative the story and and also

00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:26.610 
narrative the story and and also
graphics<00:04:23.110> a<00:04:23.430> little<00:04:24.430> I've<00:04:24.790> seen<00:04:25.030> of<00:04:25.180> it<00:04:25.300> it<00:04:25.960> it

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:26.620 
graphics a little I've seen of it it it

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:31.790 
graphics a little I've seen of it it it
it's<00:04:27.490> it's<00:04:27.790> advanced<00:04:28.980> since<00:04:29.980> the<00:04:30.220> last<00:04:30.430> one

00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:31.800 
it's it's advanced since the last one

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:35.100 
it's it's advanced since the last one
and<00:04:32.800> the<00:04:33.280> story<00:04:33.580> is<00:04:33.850> and<00:04:34.150> the<00:04:34.300> story<00:04:34.570> is<00:04:34.810> as<00:04:35.080> I

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:35.110 
and the story is and the story is as I

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:37.650 
and the story is and the story is as I
say<00:04:35.380> it's<00:04:35.590> complex<00:04:36.100> but<00:04:36.370> it's<00:04:36.550> it's<00:04:36.820> very<00:04:36.910> it's

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:37.660 
say it's complex but it's it's very it's

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:40.159 
say it's complex but it's it's very it's
very<00:04:38.020> compelling

00:04:40.159 --> 00:04:40.169 
very compelling

00:04:40.169 --> 00:04:43.730 
very compelling
I<00:04:40.490> think<00:04:41.490> it's<00:04:41.610> great<00:04:41.789> to<00:04:42.029> be<00:04:42.150> down<00:04:42.749> in<00:04:43.050> in<00:04:43.469> in

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:43.740 
I think it's great to be down in in in

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:47.899 
I think it's great to be down in in in
in<00:04:44.189> the<00:04:44.699> jungle<00:04:46.189> but<00:04:47.189> this<00:04:47.310> has<00:04:47.460> got<00:04:47.610> twists

00:04:47.899 --> 00:04:47.909 
in the jungle but this has got twists

work and with something like Call of

00:06:46.540 --> 00:06:49.950

Duty<00:06:46.890> its<00:06:47.890> it<00:06:48.370> has<00:06:48.640> a<00:06:48.670> prestige<00:06:49.210> to<00:06:49.600> it

Duty its it has a prestige to it

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:54.000 
Duty its it has a prestige to it
a<00:06:50.610> pedigree<00:06:51.610> and<00:06:52.060> it's<00:06:52.930> interesting<00:06:53.290> work<00:06:53.710> and

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:54.010 
a pedigree and it's interesting work and

00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:56.960 
a pedigree and it's interesting work and
now<00:06:54.970> you've<00:06:55.150> been<00:06:55.360> one<00:06:55.570> of<00:06:55.600> the<00:06:55.900> first

00:06:56.960 --> 00:06:56.970 
now you've been one of the first

00:06:56.970 --> 00:06:59.400 
now you've been one of the first
certainly<00:06:57.970> to<00:06:58.300> sort<00:06:58.540> of<00:06:58.570> push<00:06:58.810> the<00:06:58.990> boat<00:06:59.170> out<00:06:59.350> a

00:06:59.400 --> 00:06:59.410 
certainly to sort of push the boat out a

00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:03.780 
certainly to sort of push the boat out a
little<00:06:59.680> there<00:07:01.260> and<00:07:02.260> I<00:07:03.040> think<00:07:03.280> it<00:07:03.400> helps

00:07:03.780 --> 00:07:03.790 
little there and I think it helps

00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:07.920 
little there and I think it helps
because<00:07:04.860> in<00:07:05.860> the<00:07:06.010> influence<00:07:06.520> is<00:07:06.760> what<00:07:07.720> other

00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:07.930 
because in the influence is what other

00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:10.410 
because in the influence is what other
actors<00:07:08.350> do<00:07:08.530> because<00:07:09.000> because<00:07:10.000> they<00:07:10.120> get<00:07:10.240> off

00:07:10.410 --> 00:07:10.420 
actors do because because they get off

00:07:10.420 --> 00:07:12.480 
actors do because because they get off
at<00:07:10.600> these<00:07:10.780> things<00:07:11.020> and<00:07:11.410> they<00:07:11.890> look<00:07:12.190> and<00:07:12.370> they

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:12.490 
at these things and they look and they

00:07:12.490 --> 00:07:14.700 
at these things and they look and they
think<00:07:12.760> well<00:07:12.970> you<00:07:13.150> know<00:07:13.180> if<00:07:13.930> Gary<00:07:14.230> Oldman's
