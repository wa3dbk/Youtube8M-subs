00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:22.850 
up these walls

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:25.250 
up these walls
and<00:01:23.850> getting<00:01:24.270> ready<00:01:24.420> to<00:01:24.570> transport<00:01:25.020> this

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:25.260 
and getting ready to transport this

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:28.580 
and getting ready to transport this
thing<00:01:25.470> so<00:01:26.660> we<00:01:27.660> got<00:01:27.810> the<00:01:27.930> trailer<00:01:28.140> all<00:01:28.350> weighed

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.340 
thing so we got the trailer all weighed
out<00:01:28.770> I<00:01:28.800> think<00:01:29.040> it's<00:01:29.610> gonna<00:01:29.880> be<00:01:30.150> just<00:01:31.050> under<00:01:31.230> the

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:33.260 
out I think it's gonna be just under the
weight<00:01:31.620> I<00:01:31.650> think<00:01:31.920> it's<00:01:32.070> gonna<00:01:32.190> be<00:01:32.400> about<00:01:32.490> five

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270 
weight I think it's gonna be about five

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.720 
weight I think it's gonna be about five
thousand<00:01:33.720> pound<00:01:33.870> load<00:01:34.220> which<00:01:35.220> actually<00:01:35.610> isn't

couple of doors back there I got to put
on<00:02:07.130> again<00:02:08.390> there's<00:02:09.390> gonna<00:02:09.479> be<00:02:09.660> a<00:02:09.690> lot<00:02:09.899> of

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:09.989 
on again there's gonna be a lot of

00:02:09.989 --> 00:02:14.530 
on again there's gonna be a lot of
weight<00:02:10.170> on<00:02:10.290> this<00:02:10.440> truck<00:02:11.750> I<00:02:12.750> think<00:02:13.350> it'll<00:02:13.470> do<00:02:13.650> it

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:14.540 
weight on this truck I think it'll do it

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.760 
weight on this truck I think it'll do it
still<00:02:15.540> a<00:02:15.600> little<00:02:15.630> nervous<00:02:15.900> about<00:02:16.230> it<00:02:16.410> but<00:02:16.650> I

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:16.770 
still a little nervous about it but I

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:18.979 
still a little nervous about it but I
think<00:02:17.060> this<00:02:18.060> is<00:02:18.180> the<00:02:18.300> basic<00:02:18.570> with<00:02:18.720> the<00:02:18.750> last

00:02:18.979 --> 00:02:18.989 
think this is the basic with the last

00:02:18.989 --> 00:02:21.350 
think this is the basic with the last
step<00:02:19.260> right<00:02:19.470> here<00:02:19.530> so<00:02:20.070> I'm<00:02:20.970> gonna<00:02:21.120> put<00:02:21.330> some
