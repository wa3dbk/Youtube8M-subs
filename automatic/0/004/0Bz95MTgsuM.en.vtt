going<00:01:09.180> to<00:01:09.270> the<00:01:09.390> event<00:01:09.600> we<00:01:09.960> had<00:01:10.080> a<00:01:10.110> pretty<00:01:10.500> good

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
going to the event we had a pretty good

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:12.500 
going to the event we had a pretty good
games<00:01:10.920> just<00:01:11.159> prior<00:01:11.340> to<00:01:11.369> this<00:01:11.670> and<00:01:12.000> have<00:01:12.360> some

games just prior to this and have some

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.810 
games just prior to this and have some
screams<00:01:12.869> sure<00:01:13.229> we<00:01:13.439> didn't<00:01:14.010> necessarily<00:01:14.100> know

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:14.820 
screams sure we didn't necessarily know

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.149 
screams sure we didn't necessarily know
like<00:01:15.479> what<00:01:15.750> we<00:01:15.900> kind<00:01:16.470> of<00:01:16.500> strategies<00:01:16.950> we're

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
like what we kind of strategies we're

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:18.710 
like what we kind of strategies we're
going<00:01:17.310> to<00:01:17.369> go<00:01:17.490> for<00:01:17.759> and<00:01:17.909> stuff<00:01:18.060> like<00:01:18.210> that<00:01:18.270> but

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:18.720 
going to go for and stuff like that but

00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:22.429 
going to go for and stuff like that but
I<00:01:19.549> just<00:01:20.549> think<00:01:20.670> we<00:01:21.000> kind<00:01:21.180> of<00:01:21.210> failed<00:01:21.600> play<00:01:22.200> wise

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439 
I just think we kind of failed play wise

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:24.679 
I just think we kind of failed play wise
we<00:01:22.950> had<00:01:23.130> we<00:01:23.430> had<00:01:23.460> our<00:01:23.640> heroes<00:01:24.090> who<00:01:24.330> had<00:01:24.479> all<00:01:24.600> the

00:01:24.679 --> 00:01:24.689 
we had we had our heroes who had all the

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:26.990 
we had we had our heroes who had all the
stuff<00:01:24.900> but<00:01:25.080> it<00:01:25.200> we<00:01:25.259> just<00:01:25.290> didn't<00:01:25.740> play<00:01:26.000> play

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:27.000 
stuff but it we just didn't play play

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:28.730 
stuff but it we just didn't play play
good<00:01:27.180> enough<00:01:27.360> okay<00:01:28.080> so<00:01:28.259> you<00:01:28.350> think<00:01:28.530> it<00:01:28.619> was

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
good enough okay so you think it was

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.090 
good enough okay so you think it was
preparation<00:01:29.430> or<00:01:29.700> do<00:01:30.030> you<00:01:30.119> think<00:01:30.180> it<00:01:30.420> was<00:01:30.570> just

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:31.100 
preparation or do you think it was just

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:34.520 
preparation or do you think it was just
well<00:01:32.100> I<00:01:32.130> don't<00:01:32.250> know<00:01:32.369> like<00:01:32.670> we<00:01:32.970> kind<00:01:33.150> of<00:01:33.270> got<00:01:34.020> to
