I've seen it in the basement photo
engineering<00:00:11.340> for<00:00:11.550> years<00:00:12.030> I<00:00:12.710> asked<00:00:13.710> about

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:13.769 
engineering for years I asked about

00:00:13.769 --> 00:00:17.210 
engineering for years I asked about
using<00:00:14.250> it<00:00:14.700> I<00:00:15.000> want<00:00:15.839> and<00:00:16.109> you<00:00:16.199> know<00:00:16.350> I<00:00:16.379> can<00:00:16.949> see

using it I want and you know I can see

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:19.040 
using it I want and you know I can see
how<00:00:17.970> this<00:00:18.180> could<00:00:18.390> work

00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:19.050 
how this could work

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:21.970 
how this could work
we<00:00:19.410> can<00:00:19.619> work<00:00:19.980> with<00:00:20.010> predators<00:00:20.760> with<00:00:21.000> this

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:21.980 
we can work with predators with this

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:25.609 
we can work with predators with this
we're<00:00:22.980> gonna<00:00:23.070> go<00:00:23.250> try<00:00:23.519> to<00:00:23.550> see<00:00:23.850> these<00:00:24.029> Cubs<00:00:24.619> and

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619 
we're gonna go try to see these Cubs and

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:28.009 
we're gonna go try to see these Cubs and
use<00:00:25.980> the<00:00:26.279> remote<00:00:26.939> car<00:00:27.300> because<00:00:27.779> they're

00:00:28.009 --> 00:00:28.019 
use the remote car because they're

00:00:28.019 --> 00:00:31.160 
use the remote car because they're
hanging<00:00:28.320> around<00:00:28.560> the<00:00:28.650> road<00:00:28.920> and<00:00:29.400> this<00:00:29.609> one<00:00:30.170> dry

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.170 
hanging around the road and this one dry

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.110 
hanging around the road and this one dry
riverbed<00:00:31.769> area<00:00:32.099> that<00:00:32.309> we<00:00:32.399> could<00:00:32.579> run<00:00:32.759> the<00:00:32.880> car

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:33.120

down I felt that this would be an

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:40.400 
down I felt that this would be an
opportunity<00:00:37.860> to<00:00:38.360> get<00:00:39.360> different<00:00:39.899> pictures

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:40.410 
opportunity to get different pictures
