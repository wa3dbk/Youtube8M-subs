00:00:11.299 --> 00:00:11.309 
is what it might look like and how well

00:00:11.309 --> 00:00:13.070 
is what it might look like and how well
it<00:00:11.460> might<00:00:11.610> work<00:00:11.790> after<00:00:12.179> a<00:00:12.210> few<00:00:12.480> months<00:00:12.630> of<00:00:12.809> use

00:00:13.070 --> 00:00:13.080 
it might work after a few months of use

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:15.169 
it might work after a few months of use
and<00:00:13.320> possibly<00:00:13.980> abuse<00:00:14.429> so<00:00:14.610> we<00:00:14.730> came<00:00:14.910> up<00:00:14.940> with<00:00:15.059> a

00:00:15.169 --> 00:00:15.179 
and possibly abuse so we came up with a

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:18.050 
and possibly abuse so we came up with a
few<00:00:15.360> tests<00:00:15.719> for<00:00:15.900> it<00:00:15.990> and<00:00:16.170> for<00:00:16.890> starters<00:00:17.340> we're

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:18.060 
few tests for it and for starters we're

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:19.670 
few tests for it and for starters we're
going<00:00:18.150> to<00:00:18.240> see<00:00:18.420> how<00:00:18.600> scratch<00:00:18.990> resistant<00:00:19.560> the

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:19.680 
going to see how scratch resistant the

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.590 
going to see how scratch resistant the
screen<00:00:19.980> is<00:00:20.160> so<00:00:20.340> we've<00:00:20.490> got<00:00:20.670> some<00:00:20.880> keys<00:00:21.150> here

00:00:21.590 --> 00:00:21.600 
screen is so we've got some keys here

screen is so we've got some keys here
just<00:00:22.230> going<00:00:22.320> to<00:00:22.410> drop<00:00:22.590> them<00:00:22.769> in<00:00:22.830> a<00:00:22.859> bag<00:00:23.100> like

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:23.310 
just going to drop them in a bag like

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:28.160 
just going to drop them in a bag like
this<00:00:23.369> and<00:00:23.820> oops<00:00:24.529> see<00:00:25.529> what<00:00:25.680> happens<00:00:27.019> so<00:00:28.019> we're

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
this and oops see what happens so we're

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.630 
this and oops see what happens so we're
just<00:00:28.199> going<00:00:28.380> to<00:00:28.439> give<00:00:28.619> this<00:00:28.740> a<00:00:28.920> few<00:00:29.130> shakes<00:00:29.400> in

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:29.640 
just going to give this a few shakes in

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:31.429 
just going to give this a few shakes in
the<00:00:29.730> bag<00:00:29.970> with<00:00:30.240> the<00:00:30.269> keys<00:00:30.599> to<00:00:30.869> simulate<00:00:31.320> it

00:00:31.429 --> 00:00:31.439 
the bag with the keys to simulate it

00:00:31.439 --> 00:00:42.049 
the bag with the keys to simulate it
being<00:00:31.619> in<00:00:31.769> your<00:00:31.859> pocket<00:00:40.520> it's<00:00:41.520> holding<00:00:41.940> up

00:00:42.049 --> 00:00:42.059 
being in your pocket it's holding up

00:00:42.059 --> 00:00:43.220 
being in your pocket it's holding up
pretty<00:00:42.300> well<00:00:42.420> I<00:00:42.600> think<00:00:42.719> we<00:00:42.960> might<00:00:43.110> actually

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:43.230 
pretty well I think we might actually

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:45.770 
pretty well I think we might actually
have<00:00:43.739> to<00:00:43.890> apply<00:00:44.550> a<00:00:44.579> little<00:00:44.910> pressure<00:00:45.059> you<00:00:45.600> want

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
have to apply a little pressure you want

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:47.420 
have to apply a little pressure you want
to<00:00:45.840> inspect<00:00:46.230> I<00:00:46.469> don't<00:00:46.649> I<00:00:46.829> don't<00:00:46.860> really<00:00:47.129> see<00:00:47.250> a

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:47.430 
to inspect I don't I don't really see a

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:49.639 
to inspect I don't I don't really see a
scratch<00:00:47.850> on<00:00:48.090> there<00:00:48.390> so<00:00:49.020> we've<00:00:49.230> given<00:00:49.469> the

00:00:49.639 --> 00:00:49.649 
scratch on there so we've given the

00:00:49.649 --> 00:00:52.490 
scratch on there so we've given the
iphone<00:00:50.039> about<00:00:50.370> 30<00:00:51.120> to<00:00:51.329> 40<00:00:51.660> shakes<00:00:51.960> in<00:00:52.199> the<00:00:52.320> bag

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
iphone about 30 to 40 shakes in the bag

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:54.950 
iphone about 30 to 40 shakes in the bag
and<00:00:52.770> so<00:00:52.949> far<00:00:53.129> the<00:00:53.280> screen<00:00:53.520> is<00:00:53.670> held<00:00:54.090> up<00:00:54.270> well<00:00:54.510> no

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:54.960 
and so far the screen is held up well no

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:57.619 
and so far the screen is held up well no
noticeable<00:00:55.739> scratches<00:00:55.860> but<00:00:56.550> so<00:00:57.480> we're<00:00:57.600> just

00:00:59.150 --> 00:00:59.160 
going to give it a little pressure what

00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:00.650 
going to give it a little pressure what
might<00:00:59.340> happen<00:00:59.760> if<00:00:59.879> you<00:00:59.910> had<00:01:00.180> it<00:01:00.359> in<00:01:00.510> your
