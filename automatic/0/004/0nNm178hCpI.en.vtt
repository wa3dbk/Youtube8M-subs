00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:44.920
 Silly girl 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:47.240
 this is not your world! 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:49.460
 Silly girl 

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:52.190
 this is not your show! 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.270
 So please eclipse 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:56.920
 and disappear from my street! 

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:03.140
 Silly girl 

00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:05.660
 you would need humor 

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:07.720
 Silly girl 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:10.450
 certainly you have a lot of imagination! 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.950
 but this is not your dream: 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.250
 it's music, not a TV show! 

00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:39.750
 You should stop! 

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.220
 look at yourself ... 

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:44.010
 and think ... 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:46.570
 "Who I am?" 

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:49.500
 But in the meantime, 

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:53.180
 I believe that... 

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:56.030
 I'll denounce you! 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.250
 Silly girl 

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:18.620
 don't be sad today ... 

00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:20.670
 Tomorrow, I'm sure, 

00:02:21.180 --> 00:02:23.570
 you will sing "Heidy"! 

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:26.600
 but now look at the stars: 

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:29.910
 they say you will work in a coffee bar! 

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:34.480
 You should stop 

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:36.760
 Look at yourself 

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:41.420
 And to think, "Who am I?" 

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.910
 But in the meantime, 

00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.120
 I believe that.... 

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:50.810
 I'll denounce you! 

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:10.920
 Why 

00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:13.180
 we think that music 

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:17.230
 be the most beautiful thing in our life! 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:19.690
 Instead you ... 

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:24.620
 you think it's like a TV show 

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:27.140
 Where everything is a game! 

00:03:45.890 --> 00:03:47.580
 Why 

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:49.890
 we think that music 

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:54.160
 be the most beautiful thing in our life ... 

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:56.620
 Instead you ... 

00:03:56.820 --> 00:04:01.120
 you think it's like a TV show 

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:03.670
 Where everything is a game! 

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:26.140
 Music was our dream 

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:31.150
 And now we don't want to put our feet on the ground anymore! 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:34.620
 But before leaving 

00:04:35.010 --> 00:04:40.680
 We think that... 

00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:45.190
 ... WE WILL DENOUNCE YOU!
