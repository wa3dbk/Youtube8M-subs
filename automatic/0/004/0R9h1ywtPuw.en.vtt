00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.360
 it is one of wicho garcia of sea ​​of ​​glasses 

00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:09.630
 a lot on the team 

00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:12.660
 the country of the team of the south of the country 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:15.209
 for all the people of Arequipa you left 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:18.000
 the whole team because I am but it is 

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:20.250
 like so much time to make the decision 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.800
 to stand in front of the jury and say I 

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.090
 I can do a lot of good because good 

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.700
 I 'm always a very shy person 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:30.450
 whenever I saw the program I said 

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:36.270
 I can be there but I was not born 

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:41.160
 courage has its name but that root 

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:43.380
 That Wilson Says Hears I'm Good To 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.750
 from my illness and then because 

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:49.440
 I believe that sea ​​of ​​glasses is a band 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:52.110
 very very good and if all successful and 

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.160
 you need a good tribute although there is 

00:00:52.110 --> 00:00:57.000
 various position 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:59.600
 wicho garcía that will seat us one day 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.469
 let's remember the original 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.469
 I told myself 

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:12.830
 and ready to listen to the sea 

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:12.830
 of drinks like you wicho garcía 

00:01:19.300 --> 00:01:23.760
 I'm much garcía 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:03.189
 in spending Christmas 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:10.640
 i 

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:26.550
 a time when I 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.930
 it's mine 

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:42.620
 d 

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.620
 and so 

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:08.280
 Amen 

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:30.650
 can not drag 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.340
 my life 

00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:38.320
 how long is a year 

00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:42.980
 how much two lives weigh 

00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:55.230
 and such 

00:04:00.349 --> 00:04:03.349
 inspiring 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:24.570
 far from me 

00:04:31.139 --> 00:04:33.560
 father 

00:04:49.810 --> 00:04:52.680
 And I found 

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:56.740
 wicho garcía thank you very much to the group 

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:58.300
 that accompanies it steps forward by 

00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:01.240
 favor 

00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:04.199
 let me tell you as a particular side 

00:06:01.240 --> 00:06:04.199
 today we hear more 

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:09.680
 my opinion does not count what counts is what 

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:11.660
 what are you going to say 

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:13.670
 katia palm that at the time the 

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:16.160
 we hear 

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:19.070
 I know 

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:21.700
 a bit difficult is this because I thought 

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:25.090
 that you looked ready 

00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:29.100
 for this for this stage prepares 

00:06:25.090 --> 00:06:31.720
 little more but I think we're a little 

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:34.330
 fallen a little worse because I 'm going to 

00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:38.949
 say why 

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:42.370
 very low voice power or you have 

00:06:38.949 --> 00:06:44.919
 that get similar to Wilson and not what 

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:47.800
 you have achieved this time in the jumps by 

00:06:44.919 --> 00:06:51.430
 there we found you a little bit like 

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:56.490
 but it's still very much in the grave 

00:06:51.430 --> 00:06:59.020
 you are lousy you disappear and detuned 

00:06:56.490 --> 00:07:02.169
 totally detuned 

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:04.419
 not only do you have to be the physicist 

00:07:02.169 --> 00:07:06.639
 because if you are physically you think 

00:07:04.419 --> 00:07:11.319
 but the voice we have to see marc of 

00:07:06.639 --> 00:07:13.860
 glasses or in general to 8 garcía and no 

00:07:11.319 --> 00:07:13.860
 they are achieving it 

00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:18.310
 but my role 

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:22.439
 But actually 

00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:28.910
 world 

00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:31.190
 but I ask you I know for a good thing 

00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:33.920
 because I am an actress I ask you to study 

00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:36.110
 a little more to hui cho like the way 

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:38.900
 vibrato because the staging is 

00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:41.300
 such does not move much he so you 

00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:42.920
 I wish good luck for the next one to 

00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:47.110
 the next one sung in truth with wave 

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:47.110
 with wave thank you very much thank you
