we're walking in again and the wall
makes<00:01:04.140> its<00:01:04.320> way<00:01:04.379> out<00:01:04.799> there<00:01:06.320> so<00:01:13.760> little<00:01:14.840> well

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
makes its way out there so little well

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.340 
makes its way out there so little well
and<00:01:16.290> rafters<00:01:17.189> are<00:01:17.400> shorted<00:01:17.729> down<00:01:18.110> and<00:01:19.110> I<00:01:19.229> was

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:19.350 
and rafters are shorted down and I was

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.499 
and rafters are shorted down and I was
high<00:01:20.540> because<00:01:21.540> the<00:01:21.960> upstairs<00:01:22.939> roof<00:01:23.939> takes<00:01:24.299> up

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
high because the upstairs roof takes up

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:32.760 
high because the upstairs roof takes up
a<00:01:24.600> lot<00:01:24.750> of<00:01:24.780> room

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:32.770 

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:35.380 

and<00:01:33.770> someone<00:01:34.220> might<00:01:34.340> walk<00:01:34.610> in<00:01:34.820> here<00:01:35.150> well<00:01:35.300> I'm

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:35.390 
and someone might walk in here well I'm

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:36.400 
and someone might walk in here well I'm
taking<00:01:35.630> a<00:01:35.690> video<00:01:35.780> and<00:01:35.960> that'd<00:01:36.050> be<00:01:36.080> kind<00:01:36.380> of

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:36.410 
taking a video and that'd be kind of

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:37.150 
taking a video and that'd be kind of
awkward

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:37.160 
awkward

00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:42.010 
awkward
so<00:01:37.910> let's<00:01:38.090> hurry<00:01:38.300> out<00:01:38.390> through<00:01:38.600> here<00:01:41.020> stairs

00:01:42.010 --> 00:01:42.020 
so let's hurry out through here stairs

00:01:42.020 --> 00:01:44.260 
so let's hurry out through here stairs
again<00:01:42.380> taking<00:01:42.950> up<00:01:43.070> a<00:01:43.250> lot<00:01:43.430> of<00:01:43.460> room<00:01:43.729> I<00:01:43.940> think<00:01:44.000> it

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:44.270 
again taking up a lot of room I think it

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:46.960 
again taking up a lot of room I think it
could<00:01:44.390> be<00:01:44.420> done<00:01:44.690> better<00:01:44.900> if<00:01:45.170> it<00:01:45.260> was<00:01:45.940> you<00:01:46.940> know

00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:46.970 
could be done better if it was you know

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:50.320 
could be done better if it was you know
made<00:01:47.479> us<00:01:47.600> made<00:01:47.960> a<00:01:47.990> screw<00:01:48.760> scared<00:01:49.760> staircase<00:01:50.300> a

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:50.330 
made us made a screw scared staircase a

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:52.770 
made us made a screw scared staircase a
spiral<00:01:50.810> staircase<00:01:51.050> or<00:01:51.500> something<00:01:51.770> like<00:01:51.890> that

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:52.780 
spiral staircase or something like that

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:56.230 
spiral staircase or something like that
so<00:01:53.780> here's<00:01:54.020> this<00:01:54.290> this<00:01:54.590> is<00:01:54.860> like<00:01:55.010> more<00:01:56.000> of<00:01:56.060> a

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:56.240 
so here's this this is like more of a

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.280 
so here's this this is like more of a
loft<00:01:56.570> kind<00:01:57.020> of<00:01:57.080> thing<00:01:57.260> like<00:01:59.110> that's<00:02:00.110> pretty

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:00.290 
loft kind of thing like that's pretty

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:05.740 
loft kind of thing like that's pretty
small<00:02:03.340> so<00:02:04.340> it's<00:02:04.490> like<00:02:04.610> just<00:02:04.850> one<00:02:05.210> room<00:02:05.540> you

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:05.750 
small so it's like just one room you

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:07.450 
small so it's like just one room you
could<00:02:06.020> split<00:02:06.259> this<00:02:06.410> into<00:02:06.649> two<00:02:06.830> rooms<00:02:07.009> easily

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:07.460 
could split this into two rooms easily

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:11.460 
could split this into two rooms easily
but<00:02:08.440> wouldn't<00:02:09.440> be<00:02:09.790> awesome<00:02:10.790> by<00:02:10.910> any<00:02:11.120> means

00:02:11.460 --> 00:02:11.470 
but wouldn't be awesome by any means

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:15.940 
but wouldn't be awesome by any means
come<00:02:12.470> up<00:02:12.560> there<00:02:12.890> and<00:02:13.870> then<00:02:14.870> separate<00:02:15.800> those

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
come up there and then separate those

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:17.500 
come up there and then separate those
two<00:02:15.980> windows<00:02:16.340> out<00:02:16.580> for<00:02:16.790> a<00:02:16.820> wall<00:02:17.030> going<00:02:17.239> down

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510 
two windows out for a wall going down

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:19.420 
two windows out for a wall going down
and<00:02:18.320> you<00:02:18.470> have<00:02:18.650> a<00:02:18.680> little<00:02:18.950> hallway<00:02:19.100> here

00:02:19.420 --> 00:02:19.430 
and you have a little hallway here

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:22.570 
and you have a little hallway here
access<00:02:20.180> into<00:02:20.450> two<00:02:20.630> pocket<00:02:21.020> doors<00:02:21.250> be<00:02:22.250> pretty

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:22.580 
access into two pocket doors be pretty

00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:26.140 
access into two pocket doors be pretty
much<00:02:22.750> submarine<00:02:23.750> style
