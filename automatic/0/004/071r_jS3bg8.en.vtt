00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:28.610 
me various clips from it so I can

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:34.580 
me various clips from it so I can
preview<00:03:29.150> it<00:03:29.330> quite<00:03:29.690> nicely<00:03:30.140> that<00:03:30.530> way

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:34.590 

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:37.650 

I'm<00:03:35.590> now<00:03:35.830> going<00:03:36.010> to<00:03:36.100> perform<00:03:36.700> some<00:03:37.000> bulk

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:37.660 
I'm now going to perform some bulk

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:40.020 
I'm now going to perform some bulk
actions<00:03:38.140> with<00:03:38.620> a<00:03:38.650> media<00:03:39.010> store<00:03:39.250> so<00:03:39.700> if<00:03:39.790> I<00:03:39.880> let

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:40.030 
actions with a media store so if I let

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:41.910 
actions with a media store so if I let
the<00:03:40.150> select<00:03:40.450> these<00:03:40.600> five<00:03:40.960> images<00:03:41.470> and<00:03:41.710> click
