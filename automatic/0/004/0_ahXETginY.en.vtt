00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:19.130 
you do some parts of the story and then

you<00:00:19.320> see<00:00:19.500> this<00:00:19.680> gate<00:00:19.890> and<00:00:19.920> you<00:00:20.160> say<00:00:20.369> boy<00:00:21.150> I<00:00:21.180> sure

00:00:21.529 --> 00:00:21.539 
you see this gate and you say boy I sure

00:00:21.539 --> 00:00:22.910 
you see this gate and you say boy I sure
would<00:00:21.750> like<00:00:21.869> to<00:00:21.930> be<00:00:22.080> on<00:00:22.289> the<00:00:22.410> other<00:00:22.560> side<00:00:22.800> of

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
would like to be on the other side of

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.529 
would like to be on the other side of
this<00:00:23.010> gate<00:00:23.279> so<00:00:23.519> I<00:00:23.580> could<00:00:23.789> keep<00:00:23.939> going<00:00:24.000> and

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539 
this gate so I could keep going and

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.689 
this gate so I could keep going and
sometimes<00:00:25.410> you<00:00:25.740> might<00:00:25.859> even<00:00:25.920> think<00:00:26.160> hey<00:00:26.550> is

00:00:26.689 --> 00:00:26.699 
sometimes you might even think hey is

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:28.070 
sometimes you might even think hey is
the<00:00:26.849> game<00:00:27.029> bugged<00:00:27.330> out<00:00:27.570> because<00:00:27.750> I<00:00:27.810> did<00:00:27.960> the

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:28.080 
the game bugged out because I did the

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:29.509 
the game bugged out because I did the
story<00:00:28.260> piece<00:00:28.529> that's<00:00:28.740> right<00:00:28.920> down<00:00:29.099> there<00:00:29.369> it

00:00:29.509 --> 00:00:29.519 
story piece that's right down there it

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:30.859 
story piece that's right down there it
kind<00:00:29.849> of<00:00:29.910> seems<00:00:30.150> like<00:00:30.210> maybe<00:00:30.420> this<00:00:30.689> gate

00:00:30.859 --> 00:00:30.869 
kind of seems like maybe this gate

00:00:30.869 --> 00:00:33.290 
kind of seems like maybe this gate
should<00:00:31.080> open<00:00:31.380> so<00:00:31.529> I<00:00:31.560> could<00:00:31.679> continue<00:00:32.070> on<00:00:32.399> I'll

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:33.300 
should open so I could continue on I'll

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.850 
should open so I could continue on I'll
have<00:00:33.390> good<00:00:33.570> news<00:00:33.780> and<00:00:33.809> bad<00:00:34.079> news<00:00:34.140> good<00:00:34.620> news<00:00:34.739> is

00:00:34.850 --> 00:00:34.860 
have good news and bad news good news is

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:36.200 
have good news and bad news good news is
I<00:00:34.950> could<00:00:35.130> show<00:00:35.309> you<00:00:35.340> what<00:00:35.489> you<00:00:35.730> need<00:00:35.760> to<00:00:35.940> do

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:36.210 
I could show you what you need to do

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:38.150 
I could show you what you need to do
here<00:00:36.510> the<00:00:36.719> bad<00:00:36.870> news<00:00:37.140> is<00:00:37.320> that<00:00:37.440> it's<00:00:37.620> not<00:00:37.710> go

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160 
here the bad news is that it's not go

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:40.280 
here the bad news is that it's not go
through<00:00:38.370> that<00:00:38.489> gate<00:00:38.550> instead<00:00:39.329> it's<00:00:39.629> run<00:00:40.260> a

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
through that gate instead it's run a

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:43.400 
through that gate instead it's run a
very<00:00:40.739> long<00:00:41.190> way<00:00:41.550> around<00:00:42.120> to<00:00:42.750> get<00:00:42.899> to<00:00:42.960> where<00:00:43.230> you

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410 
very long way around to get to where you

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.590 
very long way around to get to where you
need<00:00:43.440> to<00:00:43.620> go<00:00:43.890> and<00:00:44.370> I'm<00:00:45.090> not<00:00:45.239> going<00:00:45.360> to<00:00:45.420> I'm

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
need to go and I'm not going to I'm

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.569 
need to go and I'm not going to I'm
going<00:00:45.629> to<00:00:45.750> really<00:00:46.530> speed<00:00:46.829> this<00:00:47.010> video<00:00:47.309> up

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
going to really speed this video up

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:50.180 
going to really speed this video up
because<00:00:48.149> it's<00:00:48.780> really<00:00:49.050> just<00:00:49.200> a<00:00:49.620> lot<00:00:49.920> of

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:50.190 
because it's really just a lot of

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.130 
because it's really just a lot of
running<00:00:50.850> and<00:00:51.059> fighting<00:00:51.510> and<00:00:51.750> then<00:00:51.870> running

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:52.140 
running and fighting and then running

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:53.540 
running and fighting and then running
and<00:00:52.410> then<00:00:52.590> fighting<00:00:52.890> and<00:00:53.160> then<00:00:53.250> running<00:00:53.430> and

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:53.550 
and then fighting and then running and

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:56.439 
and then fighting and then running and
then<00:00:53.699> fighting<00:00:54.379> one<00:00:55.379> thing<00:00:55.500> to<00:00:55.590> note<00:00:55.770> is<00:00:55.980> that

00:00:56.439 --> 00:00:56.449 
then fighting one thing to note is that

00:00:56.449 --> 00:01:01.279 
then fighting one thing to note is that
once<00:00:57.449> you<00:00:57.570> get<00:00:57.780> into<00:00:58.520> the<00:00:59.520> in<00:00:59.969> got<00:01:00.329> processing

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
once you get into the in got processing

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:02.930 
once you get into the in got processing
I'm<00:01:01.410> probably<00:01:01.710> not<00:01:02.039> saying<00:01:02.340> that<00:01:02.489> word<00:01:02.699> right

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
I'm probably not saying that word right

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.820 
I'm probably not saying that word right
once<00:01:03.690> you<00:01:03.750> get<00:01:03.960> into<00:01:04.110> that<00:01:04.290> section<00:01:04.589> there'll

00:01:04.820 --> 00:01:04.830 
once you get into that section there'll

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:06.230 
once you get into that section there'll
be<00:01:04.920> a<00:01:05.040> few<00:01:05.280> places<00:01:05.460> where<00:01:05.610> the<00:01:05.850> doors<00:01:06.090> are

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.240 
be a few places where the doors are

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.929 
be a few places where the doors are
closed<00:01:06.570> when<00:01:06.810> you<00:01:06.840> walk<00:01:07.110> in<00:01:07.439> and<00:01:07.710> you<00:01:08.430> need<00:01:08.610> to

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
closed when you walk in and you need to

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:12.560 
closed when you walk in and you need to
fight<00:01:09.720> guys<00:01:10.260> until<00:01:11.189> the<00:01:11.670> doors<00:01:11.909> open<00:01:12.420> so

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:12.570 
fight guys until the doors open so

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.060 
fight guys until the doors open so
there's<00:01:12.750> no<00:01:12.900> indication<00:01:13.380> that<00:01:13.680> they're<00:01:13.860> going

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:14.070 
there's no indication that they're going

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.880 
there's no indication that they're going
to<00:01:14.280> open<00:01:14.400> there's<00:01:14.760> no<00:01:14.880> indication<00:01:15.470> that<00:01:16.470> you

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890 
to open there's no indication that you

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.160 
to open there's no indication that you
need<00:01:17.040> to<00:01:17.159> kill<00:01:17.369> certain<00:01:18.150> guys<00:01:18.390> to<00:01:18.750> get<00:01:18.900> them<00:01:19.020> to

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:19.170 
need to kill certain guys to get them to

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:20.690 
need to kill certain guys to get them to
open<00:01:19.200> but<00:01:19.619> if<00:01:19.710> you<00:01:19.830> just<00:01:20.009> fight<00:01:20.220> around<00:01:20.520> long

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:20.700 
open but if you just fight around long

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.850 
open but if you just fight around long
enough<00:01:20.729> those<00:01:21.210> those<00:01:21.570> gates<00:01:21.990> will<00:01:22.290> finally

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
enough those those gates will finally

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:29.240 
enough those those gates will finally
open<00:01:23.009> and<00:01:27.110> as<00:01:28.110> I<00:01:28.259> turn<00:01:28.530> on<00:01:28.680> this<00:01:28.799> to<00:01:28.920> that<00:01:29.040> gate

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
open and as I turn on this to that gate

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.429 
open and as I turn on this to that gate
right<00:01:29.400> there<00:01:29.460> that<00:01:30.420> gate<00:01:30.750> would<00:01:30.869> normally<00:01:31.290> be

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:31.439 
right there that gate would normally be

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:32.990 
right there that gate would normally be
closed<00:01:31.740> but<00:01:31.979> I<00:01:32.100> had<00:01:32.189> already<00:01:32.340> kind<00:01:32.640> of<00:01:32.700> cleared

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
closed but I had already kind of cleared

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.370 
closed but I had already kind of cleared
out<00:01:33.150> all<00:01:33.180> of<00:01:33.390> the<00:01:33.600> dudes<00:01:33.840> that<00:01:33.990> were<00:01:34.170> in<00:01:34.259> the

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:34.380 
out all of the dudes that were in the

00:01:34.380 --> 00:01:40.429 
out all of the dudes that were in the
way<00:01:37.820> so<00:01:38.820> now<00:01:39.180> we're<00:01:39.479> running<00:01:39.990> and<00:01:40.229> fighting

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439 
way so now we're running and fighting

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:42.200 
way so now we're running and fighting
and<00:01:40.740> running<00:01:40.860> and<00:01:41.159> fighting<00:01:41.310> mostly<00:01:41.909> running

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:42.210 
and running and fighting mostly running

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.539 
and running and fighting mostly running
at<00:01:42.420> this<00:01:42.540> point<00:01:42.630> and<00:01:43.079> I'll<00:01:43.770> pop<00:01:44.040> the<00:01:44.220> map<00:01:44.369> here

00:01:44.539 --> 00:01:44.549 
at this point and I'll pop the map here

00:01:44.549 --> 00:01:46.399 
at this point and I'll pop the map here
you<00:01:44.820> can<00:01:44.939> see<00:01:45.149> we<00:01:45.329> just<00:01:45.479> kind<00:01:45.630> of<00:01:45.689> did<00:01:45.930> a<00:01:45.960> loop

00:01:46.399 --> 00:01:46.409 
you can see we just kind of did a loop

00:01:46.409 --> 00:01:53.640 
you can see we just kind of did a loop
around<00:01:46.649> there

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:53.650 

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:57.760 

so<00:01:54.970> down<00:01:55.970> in<00:01:56.119> here<00:01:56.270> there's<00:01:56.450> a<00:01:56.509> cave<00:01:56.930> that<00:01:57.590> you

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:57.770 
so down in here there's a cave that you

00:01:57.770 --> 00:01:59.380 
so down in here there's a cave that you
can<00:01:57.890> kind<00:01:58.070> of<00:01:58.159> see<00:01:58.369> that<00:01:58.549> I'm<00:01:58.640> looking<00:01:58.790> at<00:01:59.030> that

00:01:59.380 --> 00:01:59.390 
can kind of see that I'm looking at that

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:01.330 
can kind of see that I'm looking at that
has<00:02:00.080> a<00:02:00.110> couple<00:02:00.380> spiders<00:02:00.680> in<00:02:00.799> it<00:02:00.830> if<00:02:01.040> you<00:02:01.070> run

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:01.340 
has a couple spiders in it if you run

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:02.920 
has a couple spiders in it if you run
around<00:02:01.460> here<00:02:01.670> to<00:02:01.880> the<00:02:01.909> side<00:02:02.240> sometimes<00:02:02.780> you

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:02.930 
around here to the side sometimes you

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:04.630 
around here to the side sometimes you
can<00:02:03.080> avoid<00:02:03.380> them<00:02:03.530> and<00:02:03.770> usually<00:02:04.100> even<00:02:04.490> if<00:02:04.549> you

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.640 
can avoid them and usually even if you

00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.899 
can avoid them and usually even if you
don't<00:02:04.850> avoid<00:02:05.119> them<00:02:05.299> you<00:02:06.080> can<00:02:06.430> outrun<00:02:07.430> them<00:02:07.729> and

00:02:07.899 --> 00:02:07.909 
don't avoid them you can outrun them and

don't avoid them you can outrun them and
they'll<00:02:08.000> leash<00:02:08.800> and<00:02:09.800> then<00:02:09.920> you<00:02:09.979> come<00:02:10.130> into

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310
