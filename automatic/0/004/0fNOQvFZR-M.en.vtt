00:03:57.099 --> 00:03:57.109 
some with really good formulation and

00:03:57.109 --> 00:04:00.250 
some with really good formulation and
others<00:03:57.380> with<00:03:57.530> really<00:03:57.799> bad<00:03:57.950> and<00:03:58.390> the<00:03:59.390> 147<00:04:00.170> is

00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:00.260

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:02.400 
others with really bad and the 147 is
the<00:04:00.380> example<00:04:00.650> of<00:04:00.799> the<00:04:00.920> bad<00:04:01.070> it's<00:04:01.340> chalky<00:04:01.880> it

00:04:02.400 --> 00:04:02.410 
the example of the bad it's chalky it

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:04.780 
the example of the bad it's chalky it
looks<00:04:03.410> awful<00:04:03.829> on<00:04:03.859> the<00:04:03.920> lips<00:04:04.160> it's<00:04:04.370> too<00:04:04.579> matte

looks awful on the lips it's too matte

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:08.170 
looks awful on the lips it's too matte
and<00:04:05.200> I've<00:04:06.200> tried<00:04:07.070> again<00:04:07.370> to<00:04:07.670> use<00:04:07.790> it<00:04:08.000> with

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:08.180 
and I've tried again to use it with

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:10.870 
and I've tried again to use it with
glosses<00:04:08.630> but<00:04:08.980> it's<00:04:09.980> just<00:04:10.130> too<00:04:10.280> much<00:04:10.400> hard<00:04:10.670> work

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:10.880 
glosses but it's just too much hard work

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:12.250 
glosses but it's just too much hard work
you<00:04:11.299> know<00:04:11.420> you'd<00:04:11.540> rather<00:04:11.600> have<00:04:11.989> something

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:12.260 
you know you'd rather have something

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:15.759 
you know you'd rather have something
that<00:04:12.560> works<00:04:12.769> as<00:04:13.390> Lorraine<00:04:14.390> Stanek<00:04:14.810> would<00:04:15.470> say

00:04:15.759 --> 00:04:15.769 
that works as Lorraine Stanek would say

00:04:15.769 --> 00:04:16.560 
that works as Lorraine Stanek would say

and the reason I bought these was so on

00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:42.390 
and the reason I bought these was so on
days<00:05:40.870> in<00:05:41.050> days<00:05:41.320> like<00:05:41.530> college<00:05:41.830> I<00:05:41.950> mean<00:05:42.100> I<00:05:42.250> got

00:05:42.390 --> 00:05:42.400 
days in days like college I mean I got

00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:45.300 
days in days like college I mean I got
these<00:05:42.550> I<00:05:42.850> think<00:05:43.720> literally<00:05:44.350> before<00:05:45.130> I'm

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:45.310 
these I think literally before I'm

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:47.940 
these I think literally before I'm
starting<00:05:45.730> college<00:05:45.910> I<00:05:46.500> wanted<00:05:47.500> something<00:05:47.740> a

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:47.950 
starting college I wanted something a

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:50.070 
starting college I wanted something a
bit<00:05:48.070> less<00:05:48.190> harsh<00:05:48.520> than<00:05:48.670> black<00:05:49.150> but<00:05:49.870> still

00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:50.080 
bit less harsh than black but still

00:05:50.080 --> 00:05:52.140 
bit less harsh than black but still
interesting<00:05:50.710> and<00:05:50.920> I<00:05:51.460> thought<00:05:51.670> that<00:05:51.880> both

00:05:52.140 --> 00:05:52.150 
interesting and I thought that both

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:54.960 
interesting and I thought that both
colors<00:05:52.570> would<00:05:53.130> complement<00:05:54.130> my<00:05:54.220> eye<00:05:54.250> color<00:05:54.640> so

00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:54.970 
colors would complement my eye color so

00:05:54.970 --> 00:05:58.350 
colors would complement my eye color so
this<00:05:55.840> kind<00:05:56.140> of<00:05:56.230> burgundy<00:05:56.980> color<00:05:57.220> would<00:05:57.430> bring

00:05:58.350 --> 00:05:58.360 
this kind of burgundy color would bring

00:05:58.360 --> 00:05:59.850 
this kind of burgundy color would bring
out<00:05:58.480> the<00:05:58.660> hazel<00:05:59.020> in<00:05:59.110> my<00:05:59.230> eyes<00:05:59.410> and<00:05:59.680> then<00:05:59.770> the

00:05:59.850 --> 00:05:59.860 
out the hazel in my eyes and then the

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:03.140 
out the hazel in my eyes and then the
blue<00:06:00.070> would<00:06:00.250> kind<00:06:00.550> of<00:06:00.750> brighten<00:06:01.750> my<00:06:01.780> eyes<00:06:02.010> but

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:03.150 
blue would kind of brighten my eyes but

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:06.030 
blue would kind of brighten my eyes but
neither<00:06:04.150> of<00:06:04.390> the<00:06:04.510> colors<00:06:04.840> stays<00:06:05.770> on<00:06:05.950> my

00:06:06.030 --> 00:06:06.040 
neither of the colors stays on my

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:08.820 
neither of the colors stays on my
waterline<00:06:06.400> they<00:06:06.640> don't<00:06:06.790> show<00:06:06.970> up<00:06:07.150> and<00:06:07.410> for<00:06:08.410> 16

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:08.830 
waterline they don't show up and for 16

00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:11.310 
waterline they don't show up and for 16
pounds<00:06:09.280> or<00:06:09.400> 12<00:06:09.670> pounds<00:06:10.080> whatever<00:06:11.080> they<00:06:11.290> are

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:11.320 
pounds or 12 pounds whatever they are

00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:14.340 
pounds or 12 pounds whatever they are
each<00:06:11.710> that<00:06:12.550> was<00:06:12.760> real<00:06:13.420> real<00:06:13.870> waste<00:06:14.140> of<00:06:14.290> money

00:06:14.340 --> 00:06:14.350 
each that was real real waste of money

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:15.630 
each that was real real waste of money
and<00:06:14.500> they<00:06:14.650> literally<00:06:14.890> just<00:06:15.010> sit<00:06:15.250> there<00:06:15.430> and

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:15.640 
and they literally just sit there and

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:18.090 
and they literally just sit there and
yeah<00:06:16.600> I<00:06:16.630> mean<00:06:16.870> I<00:06:16.960> could<00:06:17.170> use<00:06:17.200> them<00:06:17.560> to<00:06:17.590> line<00:06:17.890> my

00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:18.100 
yeah I mean I could use them to line my

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:21.540 
yeah I mean I could use them to line my
lower<00:06:19.060> lash<00:06:19.330> line<00:06:19.500> but<00:06:20.500> I'm<00:06:20.800> not<00:06:21.040> someone<00:06:21.310> who

00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:21.550 
lower lash line but I'm not someone who

00:06:21.550 --> 00:06:24.840 
lower lash line but I'm not someone who

little bit

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:26.800 
little bit
because<00:06:25.699> they're<00:06:25.820> a<00:06:25.850> bit<00:06:26.000> softer<00:06:26.389> than<00:06:26.419> coals

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:26.810 
because they're a bit softer than coals

00:06:26.810 --> 00:06:30.879 
because they're a bit softer than coals
