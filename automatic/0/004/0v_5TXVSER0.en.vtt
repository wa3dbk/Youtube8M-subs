00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.770 
and you've got a bit more space none of
us<00:01:49.619> slept<00:01:49.740> at<00:01:50.009> all<00:01:50.310> and<00:01:50.729> in<00:01:50.850> fact<00:01:50.970> I<00:01:51.240> think<00:01:51.330> if

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:51.780 
us slept at all and in fact I think if

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:54.050

we<00:01:51.899> did<00:01:52.050> it<00:01:52.140> again<00:01:52.200> we<00:01:52.920> might<00:01:53.100> go<00:01:53.280> to<00:01:53.310> Paris<00:01:53.729> and

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
we did it again we might go to Paris and

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.270 
we did it again we might go to Paris and
