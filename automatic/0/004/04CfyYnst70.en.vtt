radical Germany Republic well i just
sold<00:00:54.410> Travis<00:00:54.800> we<00:00:55.129> didn't<00:00:55.340> have<00:00:55.489> you<00:00:55.760> know<00:00:55.850> we

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:56.120 
sold Travis we didn't have you know we

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.479 
sold Travis we didn't have you know we
would<00:00:56.270> have<00:00:56.480> our<00:00:57.140> wait<00:00:57.680> at<00:00:57.829> the<00:00:57.860> airport<00:00:58.039> so<00:00:58.460> we

00:00:58.479 --> 00:00:58.489 
would have our wait at the airport so we

00:00:58.489 --> 00:01:00.330 
would have our wait at the airport so we
couldn't<00:00:58.820> get<00:00:58.910> a<00:00:58.969> bigger<00:00:59.660> than<00:00:59.780> ghetto<00:00:59.899> gold

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:00.340 
couldn't get a bigger than ghetto gold

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:02.410 
couldn't get a bigger than ghetto gold
that's<00:01:01.340> why<00:01:01.520> we<00:01:01.670> didn't<00:01:01.820> get<00:01:01.910> a<00:01:01.969> gold<00:01:02.180> because

00:01:02.410 --> 00:01:02.420 
that's why we didn't get a gold because

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:06.670 
that's why we didn't get a gold because
we<00:01:02.570> would<00:01:02.719> have<00:01:03.250> more<00:01:04.250> weight<00:01:04.699> on<00:01:05.390> the<00:01:06.289> airport

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:06.680 
we would have more weight on the airport

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.830 
we would have more weight on the airport
so<00:01:06.950> how<00:01:07.460> hard<00:01:07.760> is<00:01:08.000> it<00:01:08.060> as<00:01:08.299> a<00:01:08.330> member<00:01:08.720> of<00:01:08.810> the

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:08.840 
so how hard is it as a member of the

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.120 
so how hard is it as a member of the
Czech<00:01:09.080> Republic<00:01:09.110> how<00:01:09.500> hard<00:01:09.770> is<00:01:09.890> that<00:01:09.920> the

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:10.130 
Czech Republic how hard is that the

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:14.370 
Czech Republic how hard is that the
acceptance<00:01:10.640> robach<00:01:11.000> disparity<00:01:11.869> I<00:01:12.640> don't<00:01:13.640> care

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:14.380 
acceptance robach disparity I don't care

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:18.100 
acceptance robach disparity I don't care
let's<00:01:15.380> talk<00:01:16.240> it's<00:01:17.240> bigger<00:01:17.540> for<00:01:17.600> them<00:01:17.930> there

let's talk it's bigger for them there
for<00:01:18.229> us<00:01:18.409> I<00:01:18.790> think<00:01:19.790> the<00:01:19.939> boys<00:01:20.570> are<00:01:20.780> a<00:01:20.840> little

00:01:20.859 --> 00:01:20.869 
for us I think the boys are a little

00:01:20.869 --> 00:01:23.200 
for us I think the boys are a little
timid<00:01:21.259> a<00:01:21.439> by<00:01:21.680> the<00:01:21.740> the<00:01:22.189> crowd<00:01:22.520> factor<00:01:23.030> but<00:01:23.119> i

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:23.210 
timid a by the the crowd factor but i

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:24.640 
timid a by the the crowd factor but i
think<00:01:23.420> i<00:01:23.509> think<00:01:23.780> the<00:01:23.930> point<00:01:23.960> pretty<00:01:24.350> well<00:01:24.500> it's

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:24.650
