00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:02.690 
stitches together and continue knitting

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:06.990 
stitches together and continue knitting
to<00:03:03.230> the<00:03:03.319> end<00:03:03.440> of<00:03:03.500> the<00:03:03.560> row

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:07.000 

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.880 

and<00:03:08.000> it<00:03:08.090> was<00:03:08.209> your<00:03:08.269> first<00:03:08.510> decrease<00:03:08.890> the

and it was your first decrease the
stitch<00:03:10.129> marker<00:03:10.310> helps<00:03:10.910> to<00:03:11.620> keep<00:03:12.620> your

00:03:12.759 --> 00:03:12.769 
stitch marker helps to keep your

00:03:12.769 --> 00:03:14.740 
stitch marker helps to keep your
placements<00:03:13.370> so<00:03:13.459> you<00:03:13.519> know<00:03:13.760> where<00:03:14.090> to<00:03:14.390> decrease

00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:14.750 
placements so you know where to decrease

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:17.259 
placements so you know where to decrease
so<00:03:14.959> you<00:03:14.989> don't<00:03:15.200> have<00:03:15.379> to<00:03:15.560> count<00:03:16.060> your<00:03:17.060> stitches

00:03:17.259 --> 00:03:17.269 
so you don't have to count your stitches

00:03:17.269 --> 00:03:19.119 
so you don't have to count your stitches
all<00:03:17.780> the<00:03:17.870> time<00:03:18.049> so<00:03:18.379> you<00:03:18.440> know<00:03:18.650> it's<00:03:18.859> going<00:03:19.040> to

00:03:19.119 --> 00:03:19.129 
all the time so you know it's going to

00:03:19.129 --> 00:03:21.069 
all the time so you know it's going to
be<00:03:19.190> two<00:03:19.579> before<00:03:19.879> the<00:03:20.030> stitch<00:03:20.209> marker<00:03:20.420> and<00:03:20.870> then

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:03.990 

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:07.010 

and<00:04:04.910> then<00:04:05.910> I'm<00:04:06.030> going<00:04:06.210> to<00:04:06.270> purl<00:04:06.540> these<00:04:06.750> two

you'll<00:04:53.440> be<00:04:53.560> decreasing<00:04:53.950> in<00:04:54.280> this<00:04:54.400> manner

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:54.610 
you'll be decreasing in this manner

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:56.700 
you'll be decreasing in this manner
