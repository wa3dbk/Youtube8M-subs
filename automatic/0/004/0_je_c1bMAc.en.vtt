 there is 

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:07.110
 this is a sauce as if it were a 

00:01:04.449 --> 00:01:07.110
 guacamole 

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:15.020

00:01:21.229 --> 00:01:26.380
 dos chiles juárez - and if they do not find 

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:27.860
 in chile cuaresmeño can be chile 

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:29.300
 serrano 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.720
 well we finished on behalf of our 

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:33.270
 Boys 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:36.680
 the number of chilies is a quarter and 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:39.340
 she is going to add oil 

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:43.060
 see the amount of oil 

00:01:39.340 --> 00:01:46.710
 so almost to be covered speaks very 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:46.710
 I am very credit very slowly 

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:52.420
 well we learned it at the fire here 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:54.940
 you have to know the chiles that 

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:58.420
 you have to know the chiles 

00:01:54.940 --> 00:02:01.470
 we leave them in medium flame 

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:03.780
 low and medium flame to hold on 

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:06.840
 good 

00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.429
 the chilies are washed and dried very 

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.729
 well so that it does not go to splash with the 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.729
 oil 

00:02:11.660 --> 00:02:17.360
 but today we are going to leave them for a little while 

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:21.190
 when they start to start cooking they leave 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.190
 to be white so hard solitos 

00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:26.860
 already when they are soft favorites are 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:30.150
 a few hours let's leave a quick and if 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:30.150
 I want to return the wounds 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:34.879
 after a few minutes of having the 

00:02:32.659 --> 00:02:37.459
 chiles in the oil that already changed from 

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:39.639
 Color so we're going to let him leave 

00:02:37.459 --> 00:02:39.639
 to turn off 

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:48.190
 once we 're off we're going to 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:50.220
 add in the blender glass well 

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:53.640
 how hot they are 

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:55.970
 and this oil that's left over we're going to 

00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:55.970
 empty 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:01.600
 let's empty a little bit 

00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:05.070
 well, I almost added it all 

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:07.570
 and we are going to liquefy it very well without counting 

00:03:05.070 --> 00:03:09.900
 the salt is the amount that you 

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:09.900
 want 

00:03:10.210 --> 00:03:15.540
 and once liquefied that's how it is 

00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:18.560
 our tasty sauce 

00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:20.810
 It looks like a guacamole 

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:23.530
 to this and we already emptied it to our 

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:23.530
 container 

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:28.530
 and that's how our tasty remains 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:31.799
 little sauce does not appear a guacamole 

00:03:28.530 --> 00:03:33.390
