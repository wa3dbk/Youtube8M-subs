government<00:00:31.550> then<00:00:31.970> we<00:00:32.000> take<00:00:32.210> all<00:00:32.360> that

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:32.390 
government then we take all that

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:33.459 
government then we take all that
information<00:00:32.989> we<00:00:33.079> put<00:00:33.200> it<00:00:33.289> into<00:00:33.379> a

00:00:33.459 --> 00:00:33.469 
information we put it into a

00:00:33.469 --> 00:00:35.410 
information we put it into a
supercomputer<00:00:33.860> which<00:00:34.460> is<00:00:34.579> a<00:00:34.730> machine<00:00:35.180> that

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:35.420 
supercomputer which is a machine that

00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:37.360 
supercomputer which is a machine that
calculates<00:00:36.140> from<00:00:36.440> the<00:00:36.530> observation<00:00:37.190> and

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:37.370 
calculates from the observation and

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:39.220 
calculates from the observation and
predicts<00:00:37.970> what's<00:00:38.180> gonna<00:00:38.300> happen<00:00:38.570> next<00:00:38.840> and

predicts what's gonna happen next and

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:41.530 
predicts what's gonna happen next and
from<00:00:40.010> that<00:00:40.280> we<00:00:40.430> have<00:00:40.579> forecasts<00:00:41.150> that<00:00:41.239> go<00:00:41.390> from

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:41.540 
from that we have forecasts that go from

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:43.330 
from that we have forecasts that go from
the<00:00:41.630> next<00:00:41.930> few<00:00:42.079> hours<00:00:42.110> to<00:00:42.710> the<00:00:42.800> next<00:00:42.860> few<00:00:43.100> days

the next few hours to the next few days

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:45.580 
the next few hours to the next few days
indeed<00:00:43.700> to<00:00:43.850> the<00:00:43.910> next<00:00:44.060> few<00:00:44.210> weeks<00:00:44.440> how<00:00:45.440> it

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:45.590 
indeed to the next few weeks how it

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:47.139 
indeed to the next few weeks how it
produce<00:00:45.920> services<00:00:46.399> and<00:00:46.550> products<00:00:46.880> from<00:00:46.940> that

00:00:47.139 --> 00:00:47.149 
produce services and products from that

00:00:47.149 --> 00:00:49.060 
produce services and products from that
well<00:00:47.329> that<00:00:47.360> goes<00:00:47.600> the<00:00:47.720> operation<00:00:48.260> center<00:00:48.710> the

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:49.070 
well that goes the operation center the

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:50.740 
well that goes the operation center the
operation<00:00:49.489> stone<00:00:49.700> said<00:00:49.880> we<00:00:49.940> have<00:00:50.090> forecasters

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:50.750 
operation stone said we have forecasters

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:52.510 
operation stone said we have forecasters
who<00:00:51.050> gather<00:00:51.350> information<00:00:51.770> interpret

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:52.520 
who gather information interpret

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.549 
who gather information interpret
information<00:00:52.670> deliver<00:00:53.510> warnings<00:00:54.050> and<00:00:54.320> vice

00:00:54.549 --> 00:00:54.559 
information deliver warnings and vice

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:56.350 
information deliver warnings and vice
and<00:00:54.920> a<00:00:55.010> key<00:00:55.190> thing<00:00:55.370> about<00:00:55.430> this<00:00:55.730> is<00:00:55.880> one<00:00:56.090> size

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:56.360 
and a key thing about this is one size

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:57.160 
and a key thing about this is one size
does<00:00:56.570> not<00:00:56.600> fit<00:00:56.780> all

00:00:57.160 --> 00:00:57.170 
does not fit all

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.130 
does not fit all
so<00:00:58.100> for<00:00:58.430> someone<00:00:58.700> who<00:00:58.910> is<00:00:59.120> elderly<00:00:59.450> in<00:00:59.809> a<00:00:59.899> home

00:01:00.130 --> 00:01:00.140 
so for someone who is elderly in a home

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:01.569 
so for someone who is elderly in a home
probably<00:01:00.710> needs<00:01:00.860> a<00:01:00.920> different<00:01:01.040> way<00:01:01.309> to<00:01:01.370> be

00:01:01.569 --> 00:01:01.579 
probably needs a different way to be

00:01:01.579 --> 00:01:03.190 
probably needs a different way to be
communicating<00:01:02.239> the<00:01:02.329> warrant<00:01:02.660> or<00:01:02.809> impeding

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:03.200 
communicating the warrant or impeding

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:04.929 
communicating the warrant or impeding
bad<00:01:03.350> weather<00:01:03.559> then<00:01:03.950> say<00:01:04.129> an<00:01:04.430> owner<00:01:04.759> of<00:01:04.790> a

00:01:04.929 --> 00:01:04.939 
bad weather then say an owner of a

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:06.130 
bad weather then say an owner of a
critical<00:01:05.299> infrastructure<00:01:05.689> like<00:01:05.869> a<00:01:05.899> power

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:06.140 
critical infrastructure like a power

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:08.260 
critical infrastructure like a power
grid<00:01:06.490> interpretation<00:01:07.490> by<00:01:07.610> the<00:01:07.670> human<00:01:08.149> is

00:01:08.260 --> 00:01:08.270 
grid interpretation by the human is

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:09.429 
grid interpretation by the human is
actually<00:01:08.630> critical<00:01:09.049> in<00:01:09.139> the<00:01:09.229> four-cross

00:01:09.429 --> 00:01:09.439 
actually critical in the four-cross

00:01:09.439 --> 00:01:12.669 
actually critical in the four-cross
process<00:01:10.450> the<00:01:11.450> ultimate<00:01:11.780> person<00:01:12.109> in<00:01:12.229> charge<00:01:12.380> is
