00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:41.220 
take two strands and then you just twist
it<00:02:39.040> around<00:02:39.329> and<00:02:40.329> that's<00:02:40.480> all<00:02:40.659> there<00:02:40.780> is<00:02:40.900> to<00:02:41.079> it

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:41.230 
it around and that's all there is to it

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:46.080 
it around and that's all there is to it
and<00:02:41.760> when<00:02:42.760> I<00:02:42.790> twist<00:02:43.209> I<00:02:44.280> pull<00:02:45.280> it<00:02:45.519> a<00:02:45.609> little<00:02:45.819> bit

00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:46.090 
and when I twist I pull it a little bit

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:48.509 
and when I twist I pull it a little bit
so<00:02:46.389> that<00:02:46.419> it<00:02:46.689> sits<00:02:46.959> tight<00:02:47.260> and<00:02:47.919> I<00:02:48.220> don't<00:02:48.280> mean

00:02:48.509 --> 00:02:48.519 
so that it sits tight and I don't mean

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:51.390 
so that it sits tight and I don't mean
tight<00:02:48.790> at<00:02:49.000> the<00:02:49.180> roots<00:02:49.930> I<00:02:50.109> just<00:02:50.409> mean<00:02:50.650> that<00:02:50.889> the

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:51.400 
tight at the roots I just mean that the

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:53.490 
tight at the roots I just mean that the
curl<00:02:51.730> itself<00:02:52.150> is<00:02:52.389> tight<00:02:52.689> so<00:02:53.109> then<00:02:53.260> when<00:02:53.470> you

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:53.500 
curl itself is tight so then when you

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:57.839 
curl itself is tight so then when you
untwist<00:02:54.159> it<00:02:54.340> later<00:02:54.909> I<00:02:55.859> it's<00:02:56.859> more<00:02:57.099> defined<00:02:57.549> and

00:02:57.839 --> 00:02:57.849 
untwist it later I it's more defined and

00:02:57.849 --> 00:02:59.970 
untwist it later I it's more defined and
that's<00:02:58.689> why<00:02:58.870> I<00:02:58.930> use<00:02:59.139> the<00:02:59.260> aloe<00:02:59.439> vera<00:02:59.650> gel

00:02:59.970 --> 00:02:59.980 
that's why I use the aloe vera gel

00:02:59.980 --> 00:03:02.599 
that's why I use the aloe vera gel
because<00:03:00.189> the<00:03:00.430> aloe<00:03:00.609> vera<00:03:00.730> gel<00:03:01.239> makes<00:03:01.930> it<00:03:02.169> more

00:03:02.599 --> 00:03:02.609 
because the aloe vera gel makes it more

00:03:02.609 --> 00:03:06.000 
because the aloe vera gel makes it more
makes<00:03:03.609> the<00:03:03.760> curls<00:03:04.000> more<00:03:04.269> defined<00:03:04.689> and<00:03:05.010> you

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:06.010 
makes the curls more defined and you

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:07.920 
makes the curls more defined and you
just<00:03:06.189> proceed<00:03:06.370> like<00:03:06.819> this<00:03:07.030> and<00:03:07.750> you<00:03:07.870> just

00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:07.930 
just proceed like this and you just

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:10.649 
just proceed like this and you just
twist<00:03:08.230> and<00:03:08.709> twist<00:03:08.919> and<00:03:09.189> twist<00:03:09.359> takes<00:03:10.359> about<00:03:10.510> a

00:03:10.649 --> 00:03:10.659 
twist and twist and twist takes about a

00:03:10.659 --> 00:03:13.050 
twist and twist and twist takes about a
couple<00:03:10.750> hours<00:03:11.409> so<00:03:11.799> you<00:03:12.430> know<00:03:12.549> have<00:03:12.730> a<00:03:12.790> good

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 
couple hours so you know have a good

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:16.619 
couple hours so you know have a good
movie<00:03:13.840> to<00:03:13.959> watch<00:03:13.989> or<00:03:14.650> some<00:03:15.579> good<00:03:15.940> music<00:03:16.299> to

00:03:16.619 --> 00:03:16.629 
movie to watch or some good music to

00:03:16.629 --> 00:03:20.670 
movie to watch or some good music to
listen<00:03:16.780> to<00:03:16.979> so<00:03:17.979> I'll<00:03:18.579> do<00:03:18.849> that<00:03:18.879> and<00:03:19.359> then<00:03:19.680> I'll

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:20.680 
listen to so I'll do that and then I'll

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.069 
listen to so I'll do that and then I'll
come<00:03:20.889> back<00:03:20.919> when<00:03:21.430> I<00:03:21.790> have<00:03:22.269> the<00:03:22.419> final<00:03:22.690> results

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:23.079 
come back when I have the final results

00:03:23.079 --> 00:03:26.550 
come back when I have the final results
so<00:03:23.379> you<00:03:23.799> can<00:03:24.250> see<00:03:24.599> what<00:03:25.599> they<00:03:25.900> look<00:03:26.049> like<00:03:26.079> and

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:26.560 
so you can see what they look like and

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.409 
so you can see what they look like and
the<00:03:27.370> important<00:03:27.729> thing<00:03:27.879> too<00:03:28.030> is<00:03:28.180> when<00:03:28.299> you

00:03:28.409 --> 00:03:28.419 
the important thing too is when you

00:03:28.419 --> 00:03:30.300 
the important thing too is when you
twist<00:03:28.629> just<00:03:29.530> to<00:03:29.590> make<00:03:29.739> sure<00:03:29.859> that<00:03:30.010> you<00:03:30.129> twist

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:30.310 
twist just to make sure that you twist

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:33.780 
twist just to make sure that you twist
all<00:03:30.579> the<00:03:30.609> way<00:03:30.879> down<00:03:31.120> to<00:03:31.329> the<00:03:31.449> end<00:03:32.549> so<00:03:33.549> that<00:03:33.609> the

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:33.790 
all the way down to the end so that the

00:03:33.790 --> 00:03:40.229 
all the way down to the end so that the
ends<00:03:34.000> are<00:03:34.090> closed<00:03:36.720> like<00:03:37.720> this<00:03:37.959> and<00:03:39.239> that's

00:03:40.229 --> 00:03:40.239 
ends are closed like this and that's

00:03:40.239 --> 00:03:44.400 
ends are closed like this and that's
your<00:03:40.389> twist<00:03:40.680> okay<00:03:41.680> see<00:03:42.280> you<00:03:42.340> soon
