00:00:57.979 --> 00:00:57.989 
what I'm going to do is I'm going to

00:00:57.989 --> 00:01:00.920 
what I'm going to do is I'm going to
move<00:00:58.170> the<00:00:58.320> bucket<00:00:58.649> under<00:00:58.949> a<00:00:59.809> little<00:01:00.809> bit

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
move the bucket under a little bit

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.570 
move the bucket under a little bit
better<00:01:01.850> visuals<00:01:02.989> visualization<00:01:03.989> here<00:01:04.580> and

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
better visuals visualization here and

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:11.270 
better visuals visualization here and
just<00:01:06.450> take<00:01:06.630> a<00:01:06.659> simple<00:01:06.960> screwdriver<00:01:09.890> and<00:01:10.890> just

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280 
just take a simple screwdriver and just

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.320 
just take a simple screwdriver and just
open<00:01:11.939> that<00:01:12.150> up<00:01:13.250> you<00:01:14.250> could<00:01:14.400> probably<00:01:14.640> use<00:01:15.119> your

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:15.330 
open that up you could probably use your

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:21.380 
open that up you could probably use your
fingers<00:01:15.750> as<00:01:15.960> well<00:01:19.250> you<00:01:20.250> can<00:01:20.400> work<00:01:20.640> it<00:01:20.820> up<00:01:21.030> like

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390 
fingers as well you can work it up like

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:22.749 
fingers as well you can work it up like
that

00:01:22.749 --> 00:01:22.759 
that

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:27.920 
that
now<00:01:23.759> if<00:01:23.880> you<00:01:23.970> think<00:01:24.240> you've<00:01:24.420> got<00:01:24.659> it<00:01:26.750> you<00:01:27.750> can

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:27.930 
now if you think you've got it you can

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:32.899 
now if you think you've got it you can
actually<00:01:28.110> open<00:01:30.740> it<00:01:31.740> up<00:01:31.950> a<00:01:32.189> little<00:01:32.549> bit

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:32.909 
actually open it up a little bit

00:01:32.909 --> 00:01:45.190 
actually open it up a little bit
difficult

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:45.200 

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:48.260 

and<00:01:46.200> this<00:01:46.500> may<00:01:46.740> not<00:01:46.950> be<00:01:47.100> the<00:01:47.280> best<00:01:47.430> tool<00:01:47.760> for<00:01:47.790> it

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:48.270 
and this may not be the best tool for it

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.060 
and this may not be the best tool for it
but<00:01:49.970> if<00:01:50.970> you<00:01:51.150> can<00:01:51.330> get<00:01:52.200> it<00:01:52.290> right<00:01:52.770> between

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:53.070 
but if you can get it right between

00:01:53.070 --> 00:02:01.490 
but if you can get it right between
there<00:01:53.900> and<00:01:54.900> then<00:01:55.050> just<00:01:55.260> pry<00:01:55.560> it<00:01:55.620> open<00:02:00.320> there<00:02:01.320> we

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:01.500 
there and then just pry it open there we

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.680 
there and then just pry it open there we
go<00:02:01.680> I<00:02:02.420> get<00:02:03.420> a<00:02:03.450> little<00:02:03.990> more<00:02:04.110> leverage<00:02:04.470> on<00:02:04.830> it

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:05.690 
go I get a little more leverage on it

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:07.970 
go I get a little more leverage on it
should<00:02:06.690> be<00:02:06.750> able<00:02:06.930> to<00:02:07.050> open<00:02:07.410> it<00:02:07.500> up<00:02:07.590> all<00:02:07.800> the<00:02:07.830> way

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:07.980 
should be able to open it up all the way

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:13.880 
should be able to open it up all the way
and<00:02:10.010> we're<00:02:11.010> going<00:02:11.220> to<00:02:11.280> let<00:02:11.460> it<00:02:11.490> drain<00:02:11.880> here<00:02:12.890> and

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:13.890 
and we're going to let it drain here and

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:19.220 
and we're going to let it drain here and
there<00:02:14.760> should<00:02:14.970> be<00:02:15.180> almost<00:02:16.080> a<00:02:16.290> hundred<00:02:16.440> CCS

00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:19.230 
there should be almost a hundred CCS

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:24.970 
there should be almost a hundred CCS
within<00:02:19.710> the<00:02:19.800> system<00:02:21.620> as<00:02:22.620> the<00:02:23.010> light<00:02:23.310> goes<00:02:23.610> on

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
within the system as the light goes on

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:29.530 
within the system as the light goes on
and<00:02:25.980> I<00:02:26.370> went<00:02:26.520> ahead<00:02:26.670> and<00:02:26.820> made<00:02:26.940> this<00:02:27.270> video<00:02:27.570> for

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:29.540 
and I went ahead and made this video for

00:02:29.540 --> 00:02:32.450 
and I went ahead and made this video for
YouTube<00:02:30.540> since<00:02:30.900> I<00:02:31.200> try<00:02:31.560> to<00:02:31.620> look<00:02:31.860> this<00:02:32.040> morning

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:32.460 
YouTube since I try to look this morning

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:37.420 
YouTube since I try to look this morning
and<00:02:32.610> no<00:02:32.730> one<00:02:32.940> had<00:02:33.320> this<00:02:34.320> on<00:02:34.680> YouTube<00:02:35.490> as<00:02:35.670> of<00:02:35.850> yet

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:37.430 
and no one had this on YouTube as of yet

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:39.830 
and no one had this on YouTube as of yet
even<00:02:38.430> a<00:02:38.490> physician<00:02:38.970> can<00:02:39.180> figure<00:02:39.390> out<00:02:39.510> how<00:02:39.780> to

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
even a physician can figure out how to

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:44.600 
even a physician can figure out how to
do<00:02:40.020> this<00:02:41.150> have<00:02:42.150> a<00:02:42.180> good<00:02:42.360> day
