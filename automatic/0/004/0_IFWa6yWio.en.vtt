00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:10.110 
hi guys its wife so in this tutorial I'm

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:11.629 
hi guys its wife so in this tutorial I'm
going<00:00:10.320> to<00:00:10.410> show<00:00:10.469> you<00:00:10.650> how<00:00:10.860> to<00:00:10.920> cut<00:00:11.219> a<00:00:11.250> section

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
going to show you how to cut a section

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:14.959 
going to show you how to cut a section
through<00:00:12.269> a<00:00:12.300> building<00:00:12.780> or<00:00:13.410> a<00:00:13.469> structure<00:00:13.980> so

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
through a building or a structure so

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:19.460 
through a building or a structure so
here<00:00:15.719> I<00:00:15.839> have<00:00:15.960> a<00:00:16.199> prior<00:00:16.980> made<00:00:17.400> model<00:00:18.380> which<00:00:19.380> is

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
here I have a prior made model which is

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.759 
here I have a prior made model which is
quite<00:00:19.710> simple<00:00:20.060> so<00:00:21.060> basically<00:00:21.750> it<00:00:22.710> is

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
quite simple so basically it is

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:26.890 
quite simple so basically it is
comprised<00:00:23.310> of<00:00:23.519> two<00:00:23.580> elements<00:00:24.330> one<00:00:24.750> is<00:00:25.039> the

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:26.900 
comprised of two elements one is the

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:29.720 
comprised of two elements one is the
panels<00:00:27.900> the<00:00:28.109> glass<00:00:28.349> panels<00:00:28.800> and<00:00:28.949> another<00:00:29.519> one

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:29.730 
panels the glass panels and another one

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:33.440 
panels the glass panels and another one
is<00:00:30.269> the<00:00:30.510> structure<00:00:31.019> all<00:00:31.920> right<00:00:32.210> so<00:00:33.210> it's<00:00:33.360> a

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
is the structure all right so it's a

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:35.959 
is the structure all right so it's a
tubular<00:00:33.809> section<00:00:34.590> structure<00:00:35.070> we<00:00:35.640> are<00:00:35.670> used

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969 
tubular section structure we are used

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.250 
tubular section structure we are used
sweep<00:00:36.270> is<00:00:36.540> easy<00:00:37.110> cylinder<00:00:38.010> and<00:00:39.170> okay<00:00:40.170> I'm

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
sweep is easy cylinder and okay I'm

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:41.479 
sweep is easy cylinder and okay I'm
going<00:00:40.379> to<00:00:40.440> cut<00:00:40.649> through<00:00:40.800> the<00:00:40.920> section<00:00:41.309> of<00:00:41.399> this

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:41.489 
going to cut through the section of this

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.350 
going to cut through the section of this
building<00:00:42.230> the<00:00:43.230> way<00:00:43.379> to<00:00:43.440> the<00:00:43.649> weighted<00:00:43.920> by<00:00:44.100> you

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:44.360 
building the way to the weighted by you

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:47.119 
building the way to the weighted by you
collecting<00:00:45.360> all<00:00:45.600> the<00:00:45.870> elements<00:00:46.410> in<00:00:46.559> this<00:00:46.860> case

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
collecting all the elements in this case

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.220 
collecting all the elements in this case
two<00:00:47.489> of<00:00:47.520> the<00:00:47.670> elements<00:00:48.270> the<00:00:48.539> structure<00:00:49.050> and

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
two of the elements the structure and

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.680 
two of the elements the structure and
the<00:00:49.350> panels<00:00:49.800> and<00:00:50.010> then<00:00:50.760> I'm<00:00:50.879> going<00:00:51.210> to<00:00:51.329> modify

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:51.690 
the panels and then I'm going to modify

00:00:51.690 --> 00:00:55.340 
the panels and then I'm going to modify
a<00:00:51.840> list<00:00:52.140> and<00:00:53.120> I'm<00:00:54.120> going<00:00:54.180> to<00:00:54.510> apply<00:00:54.780> a<00:00:55.050> modifier

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
a list and I'm going to apply a modifier

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.470 
a list and I'm going to apply a modifier
car<00:00:55.829> flies<00:00:57.410> basically<00:00:58.410> that's<00:00:58.620> what<00:00:58.710> it<00:00:58.770> does

00:00:59.470 --> 00:00:59.480 
car flies basically that's what it does

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:02.619 
car flies basically that's what it does
slices<00:01:00.480> things<00:01:00.719> up<00:01:00.930> so<00:01:01.620> when<00:01:01.800> I<00:01:01.829> put<00:01:02.070> slides

00:01:02.619 --> 00:01:02.629 
slices things up so when I put slides

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:04.729 
slices things up so when I put slides
there's<00:01:03.629> going<00:01:03.719> to<00:01:03.780> be<00:01:03.840> a<00:01:03.930> plane<00:01:04.350> on<00:01:04.710> my

00:01:04.729 --> 00:01:04.739 
there's going to be a plane on my

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.910 
there's going to be a plane on my
building<00:01:05.460> here<00:01:05.729> so<00:01:06.659> this<00:01:07.350> plane<00:01:07.830> is<00:01:08.070> actually

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:09.920 
building here so this plane is actually

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:15.560 
building here so this plane is actually
the<00:01:10.920> cut<00:01:11.189> section<00:01:11.460> or<00:01:11.840> the<00:01:12.840> knife<00:01:13.049> I<00:01:13.820> mean<00:01:14.820> so

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
the cut section or the knife I mean so

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.859 
the cut section or the knife I mean so
okay<00:01:16.409> the<00:01:16.979> way<00:01:17.130> to<00:01:17.189> adjust<00:01:17.490> the<00:01:18.090> position<00:01:18.750> of

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869 
okay the way to adjust the position of

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:22.130 
okay the way to adjust the position of
this<00:01:19.080> section<00:01:20.040> is<00:01:20.220> by<00:01:20.850> going<00:01:21.659> into<00:01:21.869> your

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.140 
this section is by going into your

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.039 
this section is by going into your
modifier<00:01:22.590> tab<00:01:22.830> and<00:01:23.159> open<00:01:23.670> up<00:01:23.970> your<00:01:24.030> slice<00:01:24.479> the

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:27.049 

00:01:27.049 --> 00:01:31.160 

modifier<00:01:28.369> click<00:01:29.369> slice<00:01:29.880> plane<00:01:30.210> and<00:01:30.570> now<00:01:31.110> you

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:31.170 
modifier click slice plane and now you

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:38.450 
modifier click slice plane and now you
can<00:01:31.619> move<00:01:32.340> about<00:01:36.170> alright<00:01:37.170> so<00:01:37.770> what<00:01:38.310> I'm<00:01:38.369> going

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
can move about alright so what I'm going

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.880 
can move about alright so what I'm going
to<00:01:38.520> do<00:01:38.640> here<00:01:38.909> is<00:01:39.000> I'm<00:01:39.150> going<00:01:39.329> to<00:01:39.450> flip<00:01:40.439> it<00:01:40.560> I'm

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:40.890 
to do here is I'm going to flip it I'm

00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.310 
to do here is I'm going to flip it I'm
going<00:01:41.189> to<00:01:41.250> flip<00:01:41.610> at<00:01:41.790> 90<00:01:42.150> degrees<00:01:42.509> towards<00:01:43.140> this

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:43.320 
going to flip at 90 degrees towards this

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:45.710 
going to flip at 90 degrees towards this
side<00:01:43.619> so<00:01:44.369> that<00:01:44.399> I<00:01:44.520> can<00:01:44.729> cut<00:01:45.060> half<00:01:45.329> a<00:01:45.360> building

00:01:45.710 --> 00:01:45.720 
side so that I can cut half a building

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:51.460 
side so that I can cut half a building
so<00:01:46.649> I<00:01:47.189> have<00:01:47.369> to<00:01:47.549> use<00:01:47.990> rotate<00:01:48.990> in<00:01:49.290> this<00:01:49.470> case<00:01:49.740> and

00:01:51.460 --> 00:01:51.470 
so I have to use rotate in this case and

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:53.719 
so I have to use rotate in this case and
when<00:01:52.470> you<00:01:52.560> right-click<00:01:52.740> here<00:01:53.189> and<00:01:53.490> I'm<00:01:53.610> just

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:53.729 
when you right-click here and I'm just

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:58.749 
when you right-click here and I'm just
going<00:01:53.850> to<00:01:53.909> put<00:01:54.090> 90<00:01:54.509> degrees<00:01:54.930> in<00:01:55.229> the<00:01:55.409> z-axis<00:01:55.829> Oh

00:01:58.749 --> 00:01:58.759 

00:01:58.759 --> 00:02:05.320 

wrong<00:01:59.759> exit<00:02:00.299> then<00:02:00.509> maybe<00:02:01.229> move<00:02:01.860> Y<00:02:02.490> axis

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:05.330 

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:15.890 

happening<00:02:11.270> maybe<00:02:12.270> it's<00:02:12.930> in<00:02:13.200> the<00:02:13.290> x-axis<00:02:14.900> all

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
happening maybe it's in the x-axis all

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:16.870 
happening maybe it's in the x-axis all
right<00:02:16.110> now<00:02:16.319> mine

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:16.880 
right now mine

right now mine
maybe<00:02:17.880> you<00:02:18.000> think<00:02:18.209> this<00:02:21.050> turn<00:02:22.050> from<00:02:22.380> here<00:02:34.760> so<00:02:35.760> I

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:36.269 
maybe you think this turn from here so I

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:39.920 
maybe you think this turn from here so I
want<00:02:36.480> to<00:02:36.540> put<00:02:36.660> in<00:02:36.810> 90<00:02:37.110> degrees<00:02:37.470> here<00:02:38.810> all<00:02:39.810> right

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:39.930 
want to put in 90 degrees here all right

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:41.080 
want to put in 90 degrees here all right

00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:02.810 
okay now I have this set of options here

00:03:02.810 --> 00:03:05.449 
okay now I have this set of options here
so<00:03:03.810> I'm<00:03:04.200> going<00:03:04.410> to<00:03:04.470> choose<00:03:04.680> either<00:03:04.890> remove<00:03:05.340> the

00:03:05.449 --> 00:03:05.459 
so I'm going to choose either remove the

00:03:05.459 --> 00:03:08.810 
so I'm going to choose either remove the
top<00:03:05.670> or<00:03:06.510> even<00:03:06.569> bottom<00:03:07.319> in<00:03:07.890> this<00:03:08.340> case<00:03:08.400> I<00:03:08.610> want

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:08.820 
top or even bottom in this case I want

00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:10.310 
top or even bottom in this case I want
to<00:03:08.880> use<00:03:08.970> remove<00:03:09.269> drop<00:03:09.480> so<00:03:09.630> that<00:03:09.660> we<00:03:09.870> can<00:03:10.049> see

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:10.320 
to use remove drop so that we can see

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:13.220 
to use remove drop so that we can see
the<00:03:10.680> interior<00:03:10.980> from<00:03:11.340> this<00:03:11.640> view<00:03:11.880> and<00:03:12.390> I<00:03:13.200> can

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230 
the interior from this view and I can

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:16.670 
the interior from this view and I can
see<00:03:13.829> I<00:03:14.100> can<00:03:14.190> also<00:03:14.489> move<00:03:14.760> it<00:03:14.940> or<00:03:15.320> after<00:03:16.320> I<00:03:16.380> slice

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:16.680 
see I can also move it or after I slice

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:20.000 
see I can also move it or after I slice
it<00:03:16.920> I<00:03:17.070> can<00:03:17.340> move<00:03:17.489> the<00:03:17.700> plane<00:03:17.940> so<00:03:18.750> when<00:03:19.380> I<00:03:19.709> move

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:20.010 
it I can move the plane so when I move

00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:27.620 
it I can move the plane so when I move
it<00:03:21.769> same<00:03:22.769> I<00:03:22.890> move<00:03:23.040> it<00:03:23.190> to<00:03:23.579> the<00:03:23.670> side<00:03:23.850> you<00:03:24.470> see<00:03:26.630> it

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630 
it same I move it to the side you see it

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:33.259 
it same I move it to the side you see it
follows<00:03:27.810> this<00:03:28.799> slice<00:03:29.130> section<00:03:30.380> all<00:03:31.380> right<00:03:32.269> so

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:33.269 
follows this slice section all right so

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:35.210 
follows this slice section all right so
I<00:03:33.299> think<00:03:33.420> this<00:03:33.600> move<00:03:33.870> it<00:03:34.019> and<00:03:34.170> I<00:03:34.350> want<00:03:34.620> to<00:03:34.920> maybe

00:03:35.210 --> 00:03:35.220 
I think this move it and I want to maybe

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.729 
I think this move it and I want to maybe
in<00:03:35.459> between<00:03:35.549> put<00:03:36.030> it<00:03:36.150> somewhere<00:03:36.360> II<00:03:36.739> and

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:37.739 
in between put it somewhere II and

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:40.340 
in between put it somewhere II and
that's<00:03:38.489> it<00:03:38.670> basically<00:03:39.299> I've<00:03:39.780> just<00:03:39.810> got<00:03:40.320> a

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:40.350

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:45.350 
put in the Lighting's and this model so

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:59.010 
put in the Lighting's and this model so
let's<00:03:46.350> render<00:03:46.650> it<00:03:46.859> and<00:03:46.950> see<00:03:47.220> how<00:03:47.519> it<00:03:47.670> goes
