 me when I started I good I had 10 

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:31.320
 years ago and I started with a topic that 

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:34.320
 it was for marc I was born but 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:37.710
 internationally he would be 11 years old 

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:40.140
 10 years when I recorded my first album and 

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:41.940

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:46.170

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:54.240
 I started with novels and with my first album 

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:56.460
 that was what I have a fault 

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:59.140
 song that helped me 

00:00:56.460 --> 00:01:01.750
 Central America that I had as a child 

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:03.909
 had a lot of success and so a 

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:06.009
 little by little but partying in america is 

00:01:03.909 --> 00:01:07.810
 can you say that party in america was 

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:08.770
 more international show a little 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:11.500
 of fiesta de america 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:15.600
 they run bad times you already know for 

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:15.600
 me the one that regulates 

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:25.650
 yes 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:27.920
 by the usual dance in the 

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:31.970
 scenario always with topics like that 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:35.220
 rhythm and with themes that have this good 

00:01:31.970 --> 00:01:36.990
 rhythm always the skeleton has been 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:41.730
 moved there has always been a rise 

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:42.750
 of skeleton and it's the combination I think 

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:46.770
 that 's what I've done, not the 

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:49.070
 said movement comes crazy 

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.070
 kid 

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:54.060
 they die and die the skeleton
