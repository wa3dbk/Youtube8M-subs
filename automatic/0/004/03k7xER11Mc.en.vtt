the corner by the way oh he was just
waiting<00:03:59.350> for<00:03:59.560> my<00:03:59.920> kind<00:04:00.160> of<00:04:00.220> right<00:04:00.400> we<00:04:00.520> started

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:00.820 
waiting for my kind of right we started

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:03.090 
waiting for my kind of right we started
spreading<00:04:01.210> when<00:04:02.050> you<00:04:02.110> turn<00:04:02.230> corners<00:04:02.530> and<00:04:02.890> you

00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:03.100 
spreading when you turn corners and you

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:04.710 
spreading when you turn corners and you
like<00:04:03.280> it's<00:04:03.490> a<00:04:03.550> high<00:04:03.700> probability<00:04:03.910> that<00:04:04.240> might

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:04.720 
like it's a high probability that might

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:06.540 
like it's a high probability that might
be<00:04:04.870> there<00:04:05.050> it's<00:04:05.650> gonna<00:04:05.740> be<00:04:05.890> good<00:04:06.040> time<00:04:06.250> it<00:04:06.430> that

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:06.550 
be there it's gonna be good time it that

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:07.980 
be there it's gonna be good time it that
you're<00:04:06.670> kind<00:04:06.790> of<00:04:06.910> in<00:04:07.090> the<00:04:07.180> motion<00:04:07.540> of<00:04:07.720> laying

00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:07.990 
you're kind of in the motion of laying

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:10.080 
you're kind of in the motion of laying
down<00:04:08.200> while<00:04:08.590> you're<00:04:08.800> turning<00:04:09.010> the<00:04:09.250> corner<00:04:09.430> no

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:10.090 
down while you're turning the corner no

00:04:10.090 --> 00:04:11.790 
down while you're turning the corner no
it's<00:04:10.270> just<00:04:10.360> harder<00:04:10.660> for<00:04:10.690> enemies<00:04:11.350> to<00:04:11.500> hear<00:04:11.680> you

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:11.800 
it's just harder for enemies to hear you

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:15.720 
it's just harder for enemies to hear you
so<00:04:12.580> there's<00:04:12.760> a<00:04:12.820> nice<00:04:12.970> little<00:04:13.180> tip<00:04:13.660> there<00:04:14.730> now

let's do this check behind their lot of

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:32.880 
let's do this check behind their lot of
people<00:04:30.130> go<00:04:30.250> behind<00:04:30.760> that<00:04:30.910> red<00:04:31.060> crate<00:04:31.890> so

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:32.890 
people go behind that red crate so

00:04:32.890 --> 00:04:38.490
