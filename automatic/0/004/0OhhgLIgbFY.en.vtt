00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:06.950
 only one question today 

00:00:05.479 --> 00:00:09.440
 it is to know precisely if this new 

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:11.539
 super mario bros or love york the new 

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:13.639
 super mario bros that had been proposed 

00:00:11.539 --> 00:00:15.680
 on wii who had himself is 

00:00:13.639 --> 00:00:18.199
 obviously the adaptation of a concept 

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:20.090
 find on ds so when mario get 

00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:22.690
 cannibalize what remains to him 

00:00:20.090 --> 00:00:22.690
 that is the question 

00:00:56.770 --> 00:01:00.920
 take a few moments to emphasize 

00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:02.690
 the evidence me I have nothing against mario 

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.640
 at the base I like mario I play at 

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:06.409
 his adventures since 1900 and a few and 

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:07.520
 here we could say that I am a 

00:01:06.409 --> 00:01:09.200
 satisfied customer since the end of 

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.610
 80s I know that some of the 

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.800
 products in which one puts to sell 

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:14.330
 volume is not for me I have not 

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:16.009
 want to see olympics I have not 

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:17.960
 want to talk about the milers I have not 

00:01:16.009 --> 00:01:19.610
 want all this what I would like is 

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.050
 play a good game mario and I do not 

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:22.970
 do not really understand the craze 

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:23.659
 that people have for new super mario 

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:26.119
 bros 

00:01:23.659 --> 00:01:28.220
 this series that goes backwards by doing 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:30.200
 all this he was able to do 

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:30.530
 before a mario but we have a little less 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.590
 well 

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:35.270
 I think the level design of this new 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:36.950
 super mario bros on wii is one thing 

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:38.479
 pretty amazing but that's good this is 

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:40.160
 not exactly the same physics as 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:41.660
 the one we had at the time on nes that 

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.280
 nothing can really match the 

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:45.259
 sensation that had been enjoined 

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:47.360
 game there and that if the level design is said 

00:01:45.259 --> 00:01:48.770
 to have no idea of â€‹â€‹game design 

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:50.210
 that they just decided to put 

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:52.250
 screws in the middle of the damn platform 

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:53.780
 in order to have her like on the challenge 

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:55.130
 why will I ever tire of playing 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.380
 so I know there are people who 

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:58.880
 love this game they're right it's 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:00.590
 exactly what they had 

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:02.869
 wanted to have, that is, a 

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.820
 since it engages both of you 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:05.990
 been proposed on wii and it does not matter 

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:07.250
 if you want to play that it's 

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:08.660
 very well myself I bought the game 

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.399
 I played with pleasure it's not a 

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:12.380
 bad game just it's not a 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:15.709
 as good a game as the previous one on wii 

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:17.780
 or even any of the mario 

00:02:15.709 --> 00:02:19.130
 canonical output in 2d on the consoles 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.870
 traditional and it's not a 

00:02:19.130 --> 00:02:22.459
 just not notice if what I 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:24.950
 you do is is just to say this 

00:02:22.459 --> 00:02:27.560
 what is the point of always doing the 

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:29.120
 same thing forgetting what makes the 

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:31.250
 strength of some of the moments he 

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:32.600
 is question in this type of work here 

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:34.910
 is not necessarily about 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:36.709
 simply make a system of 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:38.690
 creation level there is no question of 

00:02:36.709 --> 00:02:41.120
 make the level editor profitable and not 

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:42.680
 it should be question of trying 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.540
 to offer something new and 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:46.340
 certainly new super mario bros is 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.650
 the admission of a failure his kind in the 

00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:50.090
 style oh no good it's very hard 

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.200
 to do a super mario galaxy it's very 

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:53.060
 hard to make a masterpiece hours this 

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:54.980
 that we made a spell to do a rather 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:56.090
 very good game every year because good 

00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:57.709
 we need your money 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:58.579
 we do not know exactly why they 

00:02:57.709 --> 00:03:00.650
 need our money there is a 

00:02:58.579 --> 00:03:02.239
 time when Mario was totally capable 

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:03.799
 to not be the hero of completeness 

00:03:02.239 --> 00:03:05.870
 nintendo games it was called down 

00:03:03.799 --> 00:03:06.980
 have the opportunity to have multiple 

00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:08.900
 strings to his bow 

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:10.250
 but now it's a past and ben 

00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:12.110
 it's a nintendo wii game and ten 

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:13.670
 groups number 4 ie the 

00:03:12.110 --> 00:03:14.870
 wonderful company that worked at 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:15.409
 masterpieces like big green 

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:17.030
 academy 

00:03:15.409 --> 00:03:18.590
 by the way, the guy who worked on this 

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:21.379
 game at the base it's a title that produces 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:23.629
 not hiroyuki kimura who worked on 

00:03:21.379 --> 00:03:25.700
 bigben academy or april 6 tifo who 

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:28.790
 obviously the English equivalent of wever 

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:30.650
 and 64 who went out to your house there are also 

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:32.239
 the help of takashi tezuka the creator of 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:33.530
 devil world a big fan of lord of the 

00:03:32.239 --> 00:03:35.989
 rings it is not interesting to know 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:38.030
 but it's a small facto ide and 

00:03:35.989 --> 00:03:39.379
 led by masataka takemoto who has 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:41.090
 worked on flash focus you know 

00:03:39.379 --> 00:03:42.680
 it's the game on nintendo ds that was 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:45.200
 supposed to improve your vision in 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:46.849
 looking at the screen of the nintendo ds you 

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:48.739
 know both screens with the resolution 

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:50.030
 for it is also all that it was supposed 

00:03:48.739 --> 00:03:51.739
 improve your visual acuity 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:53.299
 what can I tell you about this 

00:03:51.739 --> 00:03:55.489
 game that does not do simultaneously 

00:03:53.299 --> 00:03:57.890
 pastistic and illusory in ability 

00:03:55.489 --> 00:03:59.959
 possible that nintendo has to do a good 

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:00.709
 game in 2d already notice concern that is 

00:03:59.959 --> 00:04:02.299
 rather positive 

00:04:00.709 --> 00:04:03.709
 they went from miyamoto they have 

00:04:02.299 --> 00:04:04.760
 makes a pretty good game 

00:04:03.709 --> 00:04:06.440
 the fact that he did not really 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:07.819
 of interest for me certainly rests 

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:10.459
 on the fact that I played at first or 

00:04:07.819 --> 00:04:11.930
 second to third round a world 2 

00:04:10.459 --> 00:04:13.790
 whoever was with yoshi's island at 

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:16.010
 game with logic and that I came from 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:17.150
 end the game on wii that seemed to me 

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:18.829
 a little better in terms of not 

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:20.329
 would the end level with 6 

00:04:18.829 --> 00:04:22.160
 billion times better than anything 

00:04:20.329 --> 00:04:24.050
 is offered here and that I know well 

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:25.729
 that the team produced this game were 

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:26.990
 tired of having worked on a game 

00:04:25.729 --> 00:04:28.220
 on which they are given thoroughly it is 

00:04:26.990 --> 00:04:30.289
 to say a new super mario bros who 

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:33.229
 was out on wii who so good after 

00:04:30.289 --> 00:04:35.780
 have carried the 3d engine to 1080p 

00:04:33.229 --> 00:04:37.310
 or maybe even 720p all over there my 

00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:39.169
 god we're tired we're just going 

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:40.760
 monetize the level editor so 

00:04:39.169 --> 00:04:42.710
 some will say yes but there is a level 

00:04:40.760 --> 00:04:44.000
 Van Gogh dangerous guy or questions 

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:45.560
 with the wengen level eh ben i have 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:47.000
 just tell you this if you do not 

00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:48.470
 do not know who van gogh and you have 

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.300
 need nintendo to discover it by 

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:52.220
 you can just as easily give up 

00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:54.470
 the question here you think frankly 

00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:56.090
 this is a tribute to van gogh main 

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:58.010
 to watch them an episode of doctor who 

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:59.389
 you will be surprised because he knows 

00:04:58.010 --> 00:05:01.400
 to make a tribute to van gogh and that that 

00:04:59.389 --> 00:05:02.930
 it's just a prostitution of one of 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:05.090
 greatest painters that has ever been 

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:06.620
 created by humans in order to be able to see 

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:08.300
 things with his eyes simply 

00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:10.280
 to see typing a ti buzzer in the 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:11.599
 background in a task shale style it's 

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:13.160
 still pretty peyrard when there 

00:05:11.599 --> 00:05:15.110
 think so it's not a bad game 

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:17.060
 but we're not going to say it's a 

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:18.500
 classic or that anyone else 

00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:20.000
 will particularly remember with 

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:23.500
 a lot of affection it's just 

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.500
 a new super mario bros more
