00:01:55.900 --> 00:01:55.910 
to actually sync up correctly so I can

00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:57.310 
to actually sync up correctly so I can
settle<00:01:56.060> with<00:01:56.240> three<00:01:56.420> bars<00:01:56.600> over<00:01:56.870> here<00:01:57.050> because

00:01:57.310 --> 00:01:57.320 
settle with three bars over here because

00:01:57.320 --> 00:01:58.630 
settle with three bars over here because
the<00:01:57.410> signal<00:01:57.710> is<00:01:57.740> actually<00:01:58.010> really<00:01:58.370> strong

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640 
the signal is actually really strong

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.370 
the signal is actually really strong
downstairs<00:01:59.270> where<00:01:59.750> it<00:01:59.810> used<00:01:59.960> to<00:02:00.050> be<00:02:00.140> really

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:00.380 
downstairs where it used to be really

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:02.920
