00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:34.730
 ponies characteristic of which is 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:36.840

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.040
 propaganda of all the best 

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.200
 as a new subculture it has no 

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.300
 value systems and certain 

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:48.149
 ideology for armor characteristic 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:51.449

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:08.970
 creativity is creative like so many 

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.220
 other subcultures are divided into canonical 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.770
 and economically canonical this next 

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.320
 law and certain rules among 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:17.970
 armor a lot of good musicians singers and 

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:19.740
 writers main types of creativity 

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:22.619
 is fan art 

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:24.850
 video cutting various fan fiction or 

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:27.670
 fan fiction 

00:01:24.850 --> 00:01:30.729
 breathe not criticism subculture 

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:32.729
 verge subculture is being criticized 

00:01:30.729 --> 00:01:36.640
 based on that adult 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:39.280
 can not watch cartoons unfortunately it 

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:42.630
 stereotypes and nothing to do with it 

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:45.130
 can not critics believe that adults 

00:01:42.630 --> 00:01:45.729
 watching this show see years for 

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:48.490
 girls 

00:01:45.729 --> 00:01:51.640
 are mentally underdeveloped people 

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:54.729
 I personally think that they are wrong themselves 

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:57.220
 hotel reservation critics restrained and it is very 

00:01:54.729 --> 00:02:01.990
 right they don't go into conflict either 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:03.850
 ignores altogether until correct 

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:05.679
 argue that adults who 

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:08.739
 watching may little pony have any 

00:02:05.679 --> 00:02:10.989
 deviations is master krok it's just 

00:02:08.739 --> 00:02:12.910
 nonsense even the creators themselves stated that 

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:15.010
 This cartoon is designed not only for 

00:02:12.910 --> 00:02:17.530
 children but for adults there are 

00:02:15.010 --> 00:02:20.010
 humor which is suitable for little ones 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:22.510
 children and big children and adults 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:23.590
 there are references to different films and 

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:27.130
 mythology 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:29.079
 which is typical for children conclusion 

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:31.570
 armor is not yet formed 

00:02:29.079 --> 00:02:34.030
 subculture that does not have its 

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:35.860
 ideology and armor systems applies in 

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.720
 mostly people who watch given 

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:40.120

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:46.450
 quite intelligible but I grew up on 

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:51.250
 Soviet music I watched them for a long time 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:53.200
