00:00:08.469 --> 00:00:12.920
 it's a strong symbol on the construction site 

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:14.570
 schuman bridge the crane that will serve to 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:16.789
 build the two piles of the bridge was 

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:18.440
 erected in the middle of the saone the two 

00:00:16.789 --> 00:00:20.420
 parts of the arrow were assembled 

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:23.060
 on the shore before being hoisted above 

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:28.939
 the gillet pier is attached to the fus de la 

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:31.220
 crane a spectacular operation conducted 

00:00:28.939 --> 00:00:32.599
 under the gaze of many passersby is 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:33.280
 impressive yes the material is your 

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:35.480
 car 

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:36.650
 he said it's mostly people 

00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:38.750
 it's spectacular 

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:43.989
 not spectacular scolded work 

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:43.989
 the water and work not so simple as that 

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:56.070
 placed between the two banks of the Saone 

00:00:54.180 --> 00:00:57.870
 the crane will achieve both 

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.250
 the central pile of the bridge is the one that 

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:01.530
 will support the works on the wharf 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.170
 gillet the craft so a sacred span 

00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.940
 60 meters very exactly seen from the 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.750
 cockpit it's rather 

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:08.610
 impressive 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:10.830
 the first big one we will say is the 

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:12.869
 only one in the water and then and 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:16.440
 then the 60-meter boom quite enough 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:19.409
 quite long but otherwise it's 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:21.720
 big like the others the peculiarity 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:23.820
 the crane was so it was plunged 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.590
 in the saÃ´ne it was therefore necessary to study the 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:27.630
 river bed to find the 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.039
 best solution to secure the set 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.580
 it's about four tubes that are 

00:01:29.039 --> 00:01:35.980
 beaten with a hammer and then we are 

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:37.720
 came to style c4 c4 pole with 

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:39.910
 a welded mechanics that we can see just 

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:42.040
 at the water's edge and on which we are 

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:44.200
 came then to lay the foundation of the 

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:45.790
 crane with celestial concrete finally last 

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:47.440
 advantage of these cranes on the water she 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:48.880
 will allow navigation on 

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:51.100
 continue during the construction 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:53.140
 an imperative and given the number 

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:55.210
 important barge on the saÃ´ne there are 

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:56.350
 had a whole exchange and a work in 

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:58.900
 upstream that was done with the 

00:01:56.350 --> 00:02:00.430
 sailors to precisely position themselves 

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:02.530
 on the places they are the least 

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:06.730
 penalizing possible for navigation 

00:02:02.530 --> 00:02:08.230
 and that allow barges and all 

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:10.390
 the all the boats that 

00:02:08.230 --> 00:02:12.600
 are navigating the area to circulate in 

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:12.600
 security 

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:19.049
 the crane will be used throughout 

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:20.909
 civil engineering phase of the yard goes so 

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:24.439
 reigned supreme over the area 

00:02:20.909 --> 00:02:24.439
 until autumn 2013
