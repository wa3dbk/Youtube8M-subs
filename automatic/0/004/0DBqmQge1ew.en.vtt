00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:01.499
 so just 

00:00:01.499 --> 00:00:03.470
 and what else 

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:05.740
 our 

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:07.580
 in a statement vinsky 

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:09.420
 in the region, Russian scientists conducted an analysis 

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:11.479
 discontinued foreign 

00:00:11.479 --> 00:00:13.309
 that is, that is 

00:00:13.309 --> 00:00:16.079
 criminals all consider the system everything 

00:00:16.079 --> 00:00:18.320
 us good step 4 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:22.130
 attracted and the collection of man passes itar 

00:00:22.130 --> 00:00:23.249
 tass 

00:00:23.249 --> 00:00:24.689
 learn space guest 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.739
 about this i urge 

00:00:26.739 --> 00:00:28.719
 that's exactly physical vseredine 

00:00:28.719 --> 00:00:31.709
 tap and there is an incredible scientific discovery 

00:00:31.709 --> 00:00:34.059
 because after 20 summer tires in the sky it 

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:36.330
 already the second new comet in six months 

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:39.180
 and because youtube opened the second comet here 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:41.470
 same scientists that their first in the pictures 

00:00:41.470 --> 00:00:44.650
 the discovery she ended up basically so 

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:46.190
 in general, what is left 

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:48.510
 it was immediately clear that this is why 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:49.360
 unusually 

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.800
 that is, the micron is more like 30 and 

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.400
 clearly visible on the graphic center 

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.750
 orbit comet yellow red circle 

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:56.609
 underground 

00:00:56.609 --> 00:00:58.569
 non-hazardous heavenly body 

00:00:58.569 --> 00:01:00.010
 periodically close to the ground 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:02.489
 how at such a moment bright guests 

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.500
 missed network cisco pamir incomprehensible 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.100
 but almost out of Russian 

00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:09.070
 investigators caught her tail it's more 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:10.120
 failures 

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:12.790
 and if it is so then it is explained as 

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:14.730
 in the sense that 

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:17.330
 investigation is ongoing 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:20.150
 deals with these guys who 

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:21.120
 replay 

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:22.960
 sometimes scientists are considered 

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:24.530
 achievements of their colleagues in the Internet 

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:26.860
 discovery is like the north like life itself 

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:28.650
 greenery is hard to imagine but still 

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:29.990
 two years ago he worked as an agent 

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:31.119
 real estate 

00:01:31.119 --> 00:01:33.049
 and colleagues from childhood dreamed even without 

00:01:33.049 --> 00:01:34.500
 astronomical advance 

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:36.670
 now a hobby has become a matter of life and a new 

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:38.140
 page of Russian science 

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:40.240
 half a year ago, Leonid Yelenin found his 

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:42.170
 first to the metro last time before it 

00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.090
 the comet was found generally crippled 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:46.110
 soviet union with the collapse of which 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.550
 turned and observatory 

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:49.450
 scattered around the countries collection system 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:51.580
 there is no more information in addition 

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:53.680
 this moment the technique is outdated at once 

00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:55.760
 space burst digital cameras 

00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:57.830
 at that moment of decay there was a transition in 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:59.520
 the whole world and then the records fall 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:00.690
 cameras 

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:03.040
 on the side two hundred hops was just 

00:02:03.040 --> 00:02:05.660
 two or three reactor start ups 

00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:07.450
 that is, at the start of the kostroma my wife 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:08.949
 died 

00:02:08.949 --> 00:02:11.479
 overnight the main work of scientists on 

00:02:11.479 --> 00:02:13.469
 stars do not look sable landed 

00:02:13.469 --> 00:02:15.129
 observe space junk and 

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:16.959
 satellites but the staff decided and 

00:02:16.959 --> 00:02:19.429
 suzy for time is enough for science when we 

00:02:19.429 --> 00:02:20.739
 giving cosmetics motor 

00:02:20.739 --> 00:02:22.409
 everyone understands what's funny what is simple 

00:02:22.409 --> 00:02:23.410
 thrown away 

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:25.040
 but to prevent this from happening we now 

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.310
 we plan to conduct swaps large base 

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:29.550
 data here and snapshots virtually 

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.590
 something such tactics allowed for 

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:33.969
 20 night sky attentive rush 

00:02:33.969 --> 00:02:35.819
 it certainly looks more interesting 

00:02:35.819 --> 00:02:38.100
 look here with the naked eye 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:39.980
 two months later, the Lenin Committee can 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:42.010
 will see even without binoculars so 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:44.540
 close to the ground she will win don't miss 

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:46.140
 next time you don't have to pay
