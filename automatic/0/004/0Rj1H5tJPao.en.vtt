 used touring car see here 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:21.630
 winner of the previous years and they can 

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.390
 maybe the last year 

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:27.779
 into it dear audience as schumacher 

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:30.240

 we see the swedish rickard 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:44.250

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:47.820
 this competition and here we see 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:49.170
 david coulthard from the UK has 

00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:52.530
 a man who is certainly one of the 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:55.309
 main competitors for video here in 

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.309

 when i say a spanish participant 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:08.310
 then I should rather say 

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.350
 the spanish participant of yes 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:13.189

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:22.079
 and had this race before here 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:24.500
 not just an outsider role 

00:01:22.079 --> 00:01:24.500
 play 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.170
 the starting positions certainly 

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.240

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:59.210
 there beat struck with track record 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:03.240
