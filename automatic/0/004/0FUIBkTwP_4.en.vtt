struggling but by the final test the
turnaround<00:00:23.460> was<00:00:23.760> obvious<00:00:24.240> Ross<00:00:24.600> said<00:00:24.900> to<00:00:25.019> us

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
turnaround was obvious Ross said to us

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.290 
turnaround was obvious Ross said to us
in<00:00:25.350> the<00:00:25.439> beginning<00:00:25.740> he<00:00:26.039> was<00:00:26.130> like<00:00:26.369> guys<00:00:26.880> it's

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300 
in the beginning he was like guys it's

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:28.910 
in the beginning he was like guys it's
going<00:00:27.539> to<00:00:27.630> be<00:00:27.750> a<00:00:27.779> very<00:00:28.019> slow<00:00:28.199> start<00:00:28.529> because

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:28.920 
going to be a very slow start because

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.529 
going to be a very slow start because
they<00:00:29.010> were<00:00:29.189> gonna<00:00:29.340> work<00:00:29.550> on<00:00:29.760> reliability<00:00:30.420> and

00:00:30.529 --> 00:00:30.539 
they were gonna work on reliability and

00:00:30.539 --> 00:00:32.179 
they were gonna work on reliability and
everything<00:00:30.929> and<00:00:31.080> then<00:00:31.199> we're<00:00:31.710> gonna<00:00:31.830> put<00:00:32.099> on

00:00:32.179 --> 00:00:32.189 
everything and then we're gonna put on

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:33.889 
everything and then we're gonna put on
performance<00:00:32.669> again<00:00:32.940> there<00:00:33.360> was<00:00:33.510> a<00:00:33.540> lot<00:00:33.750> of

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
performance again there was a lot of

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:35.870 
performance again there was a lot of
work<00:00:34.050> to<00:00:34.200> do<00:00:34.350> over<00:00:34.500> the<00:00:34.800> winter<00:00:35.130> a<00:00:35.309> lot<00:00:35.610> of<00:00:35.730> work

00:00:35.870 --> 00:00:35.880 
work to do over the winter a lot of work

work to do over the winter a lot of work
to<00:00:36.030> do<00:00:36.120> over<00:00:36.300> those<00:00:36.450> tests<00:00:36.750> but<00:00:36.989> none<00:00:37.620> of<00:00:37.739> it

00:00:37.819 --> 00:00:37.829 
to do over those tests but none of it

00:00:37.829 --> 00:00:40.010 
to do over those tests but none of it
was<00:00:37.980> was<00:00:38.520> different<00:00:39.329> than<00:00:39.420> what<00:00:39.480> we<00:00:39.660> would

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:40.020 
was was different than what we would

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.860 
was was different than what we would
plan<00:00:40.290> we<00:00:40.800> had<00:00:40.980> a<00:00:41.010> good<00:00:41.670> preparation<00:00:41.969> for<00:00:42.329> the

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
plan we had a good preparation for the

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.290 
plan we had a good preparation for the
car<00:00:43.079> that<00:00:43.110> first<00:00:43.980> variety<00:00:44.190> obviously<00:00:45.000> was<00:00:45.270> the

00:00:45.290 --> 00:00:45.300 
car that first variety obviously was the

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.060 
car that first variety obviously was the
real<00:00:45.750> ability<00:00:47.360> you<00:00:48.360> start<00:00:48.719> to<00:00:48.899> think<00:00:49.829> okay

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
real ability you start to think okay

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.500 
real ability you start to think okay
well<00:00:50.460> can<00:00:50.640> you<00:00:50.730> just<00:00:50.760> please<00:00:51.120> put<00:00:51.360> on<00:00:51.420> some

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:51.510 
well can you just please put on some

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.250 
well can you just please put on some
performance<00:00:52.140> now

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:53.260 
performance now

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:56.940 
performance now
the<00:00:53.830> car<00:00:54.070> had<00:00:54.550> been<00:00:54.580> predicted<00:00:55.510> to<00:00:56.410> be<00:00:56.530> exactly

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:56.950 
the car had been predicted to be exactly

the car had been predicted to be exactly
where<00:00:57.220> it<00:00:57.370> was<00:00:57.490> in<00:00:57.640> Barcelona<00:00:57.820> and<00:00:58.420> that's<00:00:59.050> the

00:00:59.300 --> 00:00:59.310 
where it was in Barcelona and that's the

00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:04.170 
where it was in Barcelona and that's the
positive<00:01:02.220> weakness<00:01:03.220> last<00:01:03.460> year<00:01:03.700> that<00:01:03.880> during

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:04.180 
positive weakness last year that during

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:06.570 
positive weakness last year that during
the<00:01:04.420> year<00:01:04.660> our<00:01:04.989> development<00:01:05.590> was<00:01:05.740> was<00:01:06.370> lacking

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:06.580 
the year our development was was lacking

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:08.670 
the year our development was was lacking
a<00:01:06.790> bit<00:01:06.840> last<00:01:07.840> year<00:01:08.050> we<00:01:08.110> have<00:01:08.230> some<00:01:08.380> trouble

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:08.680 
a bit last year we have some trouble

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:10.530 
a bit last year we have some trouble
with<00:01:08.980> predicting<00:01:09.550> where<00:01:09.760> we<00:01:10.090> wanted<00:01:10.360> to<00:01:10.420> be

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:10.540 
with predicting where we wanted to be

00:01:10.540 --> 00:01:13.160 
with predicting where we wanted to be
and<00:01:10.870> achieving<00:01:11.410> this<00:01:11.560> now<00:01:12.280> when<00:01:12.670> they<00:01:12.820> say

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
and achieving this now when they say

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.090 
and achieving this now when they say
we're<00:01:14.170> gonna<00:01:14.290> put<00:01:14.380> six<00:01:14.740> tenths<00:01:14.979> of

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:15.100 
we're gonna put six tenths of

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:16.530 
we're gonna put six tenths of
performance<00:01:15.610> on<00:01:15.700> the<00:01:15.729> car<00:01:15.970> with<00:01:16.150> this<00:01:16.270> in<00:01:16.420> this

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:16.540 
performance on the car with this in this

00:01:16.540 --> 00:01:18.960 
performance on the car with this in this
bit<00:01:16.950> whereas<00:01:17.950> last<00:01:18.160> year<00:01:18.340> often<00:01:18.729> that

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:18.970 
bit whereas last year often that

00:01:18.970 --> 00:01:20.280 
bit whereas last year often that
wouldn't<00:01:19.210> be<00:01:19.510> the<00:01:19.630> case<00:01:19.750> because<00:01:20.050> there<00:01:20.200> would

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:20.290 
wouldn't be the case because there would

00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:21.630 
wouldn't be the case because there would
be<00:01:20.320> various<00:01:20.770> problems<00:01:21.130> and<00:01:21.340> things<00:01:21.490> like<00:01:21.580> that

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:21.640 
be various problems and things like that

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:23.940 
be various problems and things like that
in<00:01:21.880> this<00:01:22.030> winter<00:01:22.240> it<00:01:22.900> went<00:01:23.080> on<00:01:23.170> the<00:01:23.200> car<00:01:23.470> and<00:01:23.680> it

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:23.950 
in this winter it went on the car and it

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:29.340 
in this winter it went on the car and it
was<00:01:24.040> a<00:01:24.100> 6/10<00:01:25.619> it's<00:01:27.180> exciting<00:01:28.180> for<00:01:28.780> us<00:01:28.810> to

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:29.350 
was a 6/10 it's exciting for us to

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:31.890 
was a 6/10 it's exciting for us to
follow<00:01:29.950> our<00:01:30.310> predictions<00:01:31.000> and<00:01:31.240> actually

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:31.900 
follow our predictions and actually

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:35.649 
follow our predictions and actually
match<00:01:32.350> them<00:01:32.650> and<00:01:32.860> put<00:01:33.700> them<00:01:33.820> into<00:01:33.940> left<00:01:34.180> hands

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:35.659 
match them and put them into left hands

00:01:35.659 --> 00:01:37.600 
match them and put them into left hands
we<00:01:36.170> know<00:01:36.320> from<00:01:36.470> the<00:01:36.619> very<00:01:36.740> first<00:01:37.010> race<00:01:37.280> how<00:01:37.549> are

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:37.610 
we know from the very first race how are

00:01:37.610 --> 00:01:40.030 
we know from the very first race how are
we<00:01:37.700> going<00:01:37.850> to<00:01:37.939> work<00:01:38.509> with<00:01:38.720> the<00:01:38.780> drivers<00:01:39.200> I<00:01:39.470> mean

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:40.040 
we going to work with the drivers I mean

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:41.410 
we going to work with the drivers I mean
Michael<00:01:40.340> very<00:01:40.520> well<00:01:40.670> but<00:01:40.820> of<00:01:40.939> course<00:01:41.090> the<00:01:41.210> team

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:41.420 
Michael very well but of course the team

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.270 
Michael very well but of course the team
didn't<00:01:41.780> this<00:01:42.110> year<00:01:42.320> compared<00:01:42.680> to<00:01:42.710> last<00:01:42.799> year

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:43.280 
didn't this year compared to last year

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:46.060 
didn't this year compared to last year
it's<00:01:43.880> a<00:01:44.060> big<00:01:44.930> difference<00:01:45.320> because<00:01:45.470> I<00:01:45.650> just

00:01:46.060 --> 00:01:46.070 
it's a big difference because I just

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:48.010 
it's a big difference because I just
arrived<00:01:46.369> and<00:01:46.520> I<00:01:46.580> know<00:01:46.640> immediately<00:01:46.820> who<00:01:47.690> is

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:48.020 
arrived and I know immediately who is
