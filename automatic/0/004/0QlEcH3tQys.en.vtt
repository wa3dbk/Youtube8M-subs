00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:09.660 
hello and welcome to this tutorial in

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.629 
hello and welcome to this tutorial in
this<00:00:09.960> video<00:00:10.500> we<00:00:10.889> are<00:00:10.920> you<00:00:11.010> going<00:00:11.219> to<00:00:11.370> be<00:00:11.460> making

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639 
this video we are you going to be making

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:14.570 
this video we are you going to be making
hook<00:00:12.120> covers<00:00:12.660> or<00:00:12.809> pencil<00:00:13.260> grips<00:00:13.580> they're

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:14.580 
hook covers or pencil grips they're

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:17.359 
hook covers or pencil grips they're
basically<00:00:14.969> the<00:00:15.090> same<00:00:15.240> design<00:00:15.949> one's<00:00:16.949> just<00:00:17.250> a

00:00:17.359 --> 00:00:17.369 
basically the same design one's just a

00:00:17.369 --> 00:00:19.970 
basically the same design one's just a
bit<00:00:17.520> longer<00:00:17.930> as<00:00:18.930> you<00:00:19.230> can<00:00:19.380> see<00:00:19.590> i<00:00:19.619> have<00:00:19.710> two

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:19.980 
bit longer as you can see i have two

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:25.100 
bit longer as you can see i have two
examples<00:00:20.609> here<00:00:22.700> this<00:00:23.700> is<00:00:23.820> really<00:00:24.480> easy<00:00:24.720> and

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:25.110 
examples here this is really easy and

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:27.740 
examples here this is really easy and
straightforward<00:00:25.500> thing<00:00:26.370> to<00:00:26.550> make<00:00:26.730> but<00:00:27.720> the

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:27.750 
straightforward thing to make but the

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:31.550 
straightforward thing to make but the
downside<00:00:28.050> is<00:00:28.710> it<00:00:28.950> uses<00:00:29.370> loads<00:00:29.700> of<00:00:29.940> bands<00:00:30.560> so

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:31.560 
downside is it uses loads of bands so

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.650 
downside is it uses loads of bands so
make<00:00:31.710> sure<00:00:31.740> you<00:00:32.039> have<00:00:32.189> enough<00:00:32.510> to<00:00:33.510> make

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:33.660 
make sure you have enough to make

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:37.330 
make sure you have enough to make
something<00:00:33.899> about<00:00:34.140> this<00:00:34.410> size<00:00:34.940> it<00:00:35.940> uses<00:00:36.360> around

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:37.340 
something about this size it uses around

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:40.250 
something about this size it uses around
145<00:00:38.390> so<00:00:39.390> as<00:00:39.450> you<00:00:39.540> can<00:00:39.660> see<00:00:39.810> it<00:00:39.900> won't<00:00:40.050> come

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
145 so as you can see it won't come

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.310 
145 so as you can see it won't come
cheap<00:00:40.620> but<00:00:40.920> I<00:00:41.760> advise<00:00:42.390> that<00:00:42.750> years<00:00:43.020> are<00:00:43.140> quite

00:00:43.310 --> 00:00:43.320 
cheap but I advise that years are quite

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.840 
cheap but I advise that years are quite
low<00:00:43.530> quality<00:00:43.920> balusters<00:00:44.489> they're<00:00:44.610> not<00:00:44.700> going

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850 
low quality balusters they're not going

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.840 
low quality balusters they're not going
to<00:00:44.940> stretch<00:00:45.360> that<00:00:45.660> much<00:00:45.899> if<00:00:46.260> they<00:00:46.440> snap<00:00:46.850> at

00:00:47.840 --> 00:00:47.850 
to stretch that much if they snap at

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:49.580 
to stretch that much if they snap at
some<00:00:48.120> point<00:00:48.420> struct<00:00:48.810> videos<00:00:49.110> not<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.380> end<00:00:49.500> of

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
some point struct videos not the end of

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:52.549 
some point struct videos not the end of
the<00:00:49.649> world<00:00:49.829> so<00:00:50.489> yeah<00:00:50.730> I<00:00:50.970> i<00:00:51.600> was<00:00:51.899> doing<00:00:52.140> out<00:00:52.260> i<00:00:52.290> am

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
the world so yeah I i was doing out i am

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.120 
the world so yeah I i was doing out i am
using<00:00:52.800> cheaper<00:00:53.190> bands<00:00:53.520> for<00:00:53.850> this<00:00:53.940> video<00:00:55.130> ok

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:56.130 
using cheaper bands for this video ok

00:00:56.130 --> 00:00:58.910 
using cheaper bands for this video ok
the<00:00:56.340> other<00:00:56.520> thing<00:00:56.730> i<00:00:57.030> need<00:00:57.210> to<00:00:57.390> note<00:00:57.719> is<00:00:58.050> that

00:00:58.910 --> 00:00:58.920 
the other thing i need to note is that

00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.110 
the other thing i need to note is that
i'm<00:00:59.160> going<00:00:59.370> to<00:00:59.520> be<00:00:59.610> doing<00:00:59.730> this<00:00:59.850> on<00:01:00.090> the

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.120 
i'm going to be doing this on the

00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.619 
i'm going to be doing this on the
rainbow<00:01:00.420> loom<00:01:00.630> and<00:01:01.640> on<00:01:02.640> the<00:01:02.850> rainbow<00:01:03.000> loom<00:01:03.180> it

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629 
rainbow loom and on the rainbow loom it

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.370 
rainbow loom and on the rainbow loom it
can<00:01:04.290> come<00:01:04.469> apart<00:01:04.799> into<00:01:05.009> three<00:01:05.280> sections

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:06.380 
can come apart into three sections

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.050 
can come apart into three sections
however<00:01:07.380> i<00:01:07.439> know<00:01:07.500> in<00:01:07.799> with<00:01:08.340> other<00:01:08.460> lunes<00:01:08.759> is

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:09.060 
however i know in with other lunes is

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.289 
however i know in with other lunes is
not<00:01:09.360> only<00:01:09.840> the<00:01:10.109> case<00:01:10.639> it<00:01:11.639> doesn't<00:01:12.060> really

00:01:12.289 --> 00:01:12.299 
not only the case it doesn't really

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.779 
not only the case it doesn't really
matter<00:01:12.979> because<00:01:13.979> we're<00:01:14.219> only<00:01:14.369> going<00:01:14.549> to<00:01:14.700> be

00:01:14.779 --> 00:01:14.789 
matter because we're only going to be

00:01:14.789 --> 00:01:17.569 
matter because we're only going to be
using<00:01:14.819> tiny<00:01:15.420> bit<00:01:15.689> of<00:01:15.899> it<00:01:16.079> and<00:01:16.289> it's<00:01:16.649> a<00:01:17.340> little

00:01:17.569 --> 00:01:17.579 
using tiny bit of it and it's a little

00:01:17.579 --> 00:01:19.940 
using tiny bit of it and it's a little
easier<00:01:17.819> if<00:01:18.179> you<00:01:18.539> can<00:01:18.749> remove<00:01:18.959> middle<00:01:19.469> section

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:19.950 
easier if you can remove middle section

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.129 
easier if you can remove middle section
of<00:01:20.069> your<00:01:20.249> loan<00:01:20.459> but<00:01:21.299> however<00:01:21.509> not<00:01:21.749> the<00:01:21.899> end<00:01:22.049> of

00:01:22.129 --> 00:01:22.139 
of your loan but however not the end of

00:01:22.139 --> 00:01:26.629 
of your loan but however not the end of
the<00:01:22.200> world<00:01:22.700> if<00:01:23.700> you<00:01:24.299> can't<00:01:24.859> ok<00:01:25.859> we<00:01:26.219> are<00:01:26.310> now

00:01:26.629 --> 00:01:26.639 
the world if you can't ok we are now

00:01:26.639 --> 00:01:31.249 
the world if you can't ok we are now
going<00:01:26.670> to<00:01:27.179> begin<00:01:27.539> the<00:01:27.689> tutorial<00:01:29.869> ok<00:01:30.869> me<00:01:31.109> now

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
going to begin the tutorial ok me now

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:32.809 
going to begin the tutorial ok me now
i'm<00:01:31.350> going<00:01:31.529> to<00:01:31.679> do<00:01:31.799> the<00:01:31.950> bit<00:01:32.130> when<00:01:32.310> you<00:01:32.429> lay<00:01:32.639> the

00:01:32.809 --> 00:01:32.819 
i'm going to do the bit when you lay the

00:01:32.819 --> 00:01:36.080 
i'm going to do the bit when you lay the
band's<00:01:32.999> out<00:01:33.359> as<00:01:33.959> i've<00:01:34.829> mentioned<00:01:34.859> already<00:01:35.520> if

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:36.090 
band's out as i've mentioned already if

00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:38.989 
band's out as i've mentioned already if
you<00:01:36.359> can<00:01:36.799> remove<00:01:37.799> the<00:01:38.009> middle<00:01:38.340> section<00:01:38.880> off

00:01:38.989 --> 00:01:38.999 
you can remove the middle section off

00:01:38.999 --> 00:01:42.109 
you can remove the middle section off
your<00:01:39.209> loan<00:01:39.359> and<00:01:39.689> as<00:01:39.990> I<00:01:40.020> also<00:01:40.439> said<00:01:40.649> already<00:01:41.119> if

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
your loan and as I also said already if

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:43.819 
your loan and as I also said already if
you<00:01:42.329> can't<00:01:42.749> is<00:01:43.079> not<00:01:43.229> the<00:01:43.380> end<00:01:43.469> of<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:43.649> world

00:01:43.819 --> 00:01:43.829 
you can't is not the end of the world

00:01:43.829 --> 00:01:48.589 
you can't is not the end of the world
you<00:01:44.659> need<00:01:45.659> to<00:01:46.200> set<00:01:46.889> up<00:01:47.069> your<00:01:47.219> loom<00:01:47.429> again<00:01:48.419> if

00:01:48.589 --> 00:01:48.599 
you need to set up your loom again if

00:01:48.599 --> 00:01:52.010 
you need to set up your loom again if
you<00:01:48.749> can<00:01:49.049> in<00:01:49.859> the<00:01:50.219> configuration<00:01:50.869> so<00:01:51.869> they're

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
you can in the configuration so they're

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.649 
you can in the configuration so they're
all<00:01:52.169> in<00:01:52.319> line<00:01:52.349> with<00:01:52.829> each<00:01:52.979> other<00:01:53.249> as<00:01:54.090> to<00:01:54.569> like

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:54.659 
all in line with each other as to like

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.469 
all in line with each other as to like
not<00:01:54.719> in<00:01:55.200> line<00:01:55.619> again<00:01:56.609> it<00:01:57.060> doesn't<00:01:57.270> really

00:01:57.469 --> 00:01:57.479 
not in line again it doesn't really

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.139 
not in line again it doesn't really
matter<00:01:57.749> that<00:01:57.990> much<00:01:58.169> but<00:01:59.099> it<00:01:59.340> is<00:01:59.520> easier<00:01:59.849> to<00:01:59.909> do

00:02:00.139 --> 00:02:00.149 
matter that much but it is easier to do

00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:03.859 
matter that much but it is easier to do
it<00:02:00.270> like<00:02:00.389> this<00:02:00.630> for<00:02:01.789> this<00:02:02.789> design<00:02:03.270> you<00:02:03.599> only

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
it like this for this design you only

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.809 
it like this for this design you only
are<00:02:04.139> going<00:02:04.319> to<00:02:04.469> use<00:02:04.560> four<00:02:04.889> pegs<00:02:05.189> so<00:02:05.549> I'm<00:02:05.609> only

00:02:05.809 --> 00:02:05.819 
are going to use four pegs so I'm only

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:09.999 
are going to use four pegs so I'm only
going<00:02:06.149> to<00:02:06.509> use<00:02:06.539> these<00:02:07.109> for<00:02:07.560> to<00:02:08.550> do<00:02:08.670> our<00:02:08.819> design

00:02:09.999 --> 00:02:10.009 
going to use these for to do our design

00:02:10.009 --> 00:02:14.870 
going to use these for to do our design
all<00:02:11.009> right<00:02:11.340> the<00:02:12.300> first<00:02:12.510> thing<00:02:13.050> we<00:02:13.410> do<00:02:13.620> is<00:02:13.920> get<00:02:14.850> a

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:14.880 
all right the first thing we do is get a

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:17.790 
all right the first thing we do is get a
band<00:02:16.400> twister

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:17.800 
band twister

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.960 
band twister
in<00:02:18.670> a<00:02:18.790> figure<00:02:19.120> of<00:02:19.150> eight<00:02:19.420> and<00:02:20.370> put<00:02:21.370> it<00:02:21.610> so<00:02:21.850> it

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:21.970 
in a figure of eight and put it so it

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:26.610 
in a figure of eight and put it so it
goes<00:02:22.150> from<00:02:22.240> here<00:02:22.570> to<00:02:22.600> here<00:02:23.760> we<00:02:24.760> then<00:02:25.620> get

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:26.620 
goes from here to here we then get

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.670 
goes from here to here we then get
another<00:02:27.040> band<00:02:27.810> twist<00:02:28.810> it<00:02:29.080> in<00:02:29.200> a<00:02:29.290> figure<00:02:29.650> of

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:29.680 
another band twist it in a figure of

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.080 
another band twist it in a figure of
eight<00:02:29.920> and<00:02:30.790> push<00:02:31.420> you<00:02:31.540> from<00:02:31.660> here<00:02:31.930> to<00:02:32.140> here

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:33.090 
eight and push you from here to here

00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:42.630 
eight and push you from here to here
then<00:02:34.090> another<00:02:36.720> from<00:02:37.720> here<00:02:38.470> to<00:02:38.650> here<00:02:39.690> and<00:02:41.640> a

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:42.640 
then another from here to here and a

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:47.040 
then another from here to here and a
last<00:02:43.390> one<00:02:44.040> from<00:02:45.040> here<00:02:45.280> to<00:02:45.490> here<00:02:46.050> there's

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:47.050 
last one from here to here there's

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:49.140 
last one from here to here there's
little<00:02:47.710> right<00:02:47.860> what<00:02:48.040> we<00:02:48.160> do<00:02:48.310> when<00:02:48.490> we<00:02:48.670> first

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:49.150 
little right what we do when we first

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:52.260 
little right what we do when we first
start<00:02:49.450> making<00:02:49.750> a<00:02:49.840> fishtail<00:02:51.090> obviously<00:02:52.090> this

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:52.270 
start making a fishtail obviously this

00:02:52.270 --> 00:02:56.040 
start making a fishtail obviously this
is<00:02:52.450> in<00:02:52.600> for<00:02:52.960> as<00:02:53.290> to<00:02:53.800> just<00:02:54.040> one<00:02:54.340> twist<00:02:54.840> you<00:02:55.840> will

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:56.050 
is in for as to just one twist you will

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:57.720 
is in for as to just one twist you will
notice<00:02:56.290> that<00:02:56.680> it's<00:02:56.830> very<00:02:57.040> similar<00:02:57.340> to<00:02:57.550> a

00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:57.730 
notice that it's very similar to a

00:02:57.730 --> 00:03:01.130 
notice that it's very similar to a
fishtail<00:02:58.240> as<00:02:59.020> we<00:02:59.410> go<00:02:59.530> throughout<00:02:59.800> the<00:02:59.950> pattern

00:03:01.130 --> 00:03:01.140 
fishtail as we go throughout the pattern

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:04.170 
fishtail as we go throughout the pattern
remember<00:03:02.140> the<00:03:02.950> way<00:03:03.130> we're<00:03:03.340> working<00:03:03.520> is<00:03:04.000> from

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:04.180 
remember the way we're working is from

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:08.790 
remember the way we're working is from
here<00:03:04.750> to<00:03:05.110> here<00:03:05.770> to<00:03:06.460> here<00:03:06.490> to<00:03:06.790> here<00:03:07.590> you<00:03:08.590> never

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:08.800 
here to here to here to here you never

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:10.860 
here to here to here to here you never
change<00:03:09.160> direction<00:03:09.550> or<00:03:10.120> it<00:03:10.360> will<00:03:10.480> go<00:03:10.630> really

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:10.870 
change direction or it will go really

00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:13.740 
change direction or it will go really
wrong<00:03:11.170> trust<00:03:11.710> me<00:03:11.950> I<00:03:12.300> can<00:03:13.300> we<00:03:13.360> then<00:03:13.390> get<00:03:13.630> the

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:07.900 
step of our design we're then going to

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:12.390 
step of our design we're then going to
begin<00:04:08.170> the<00:04:08.350> hooking<00:04:09.959> do<00:04:10.959> you<00:04:11.080> see<00:04:11.500> those<00:04:12.010> two

00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:15.100 
bands at the bottom we're going to hook

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:18.509 
bands at the bottom we're going to hook
those<00:04:15.400> over<00:04:15.820> the<00:04:16.090> top<00:04:16.269> of<00:04:16.299> this<00:04:16.540> peg<00:04:17.190> with<00:04:18.190> most

00:04:18.509 --> 00:04:18.519 
those over the top of this peg with most

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:22.350 
those over the top of this peg with most
designs<00:04:19.140> you<00:04:20.140> pull<00:04:20.500> them<00:04:20.709> back<00:04:20.950> and<00:04:21.400> hook<00:04:21.669> with

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:22.360 
designs you pull them back and hook with

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:25.740 
designs you pull them back and hook with
this<00:04:22.570> one<00:04:23.010> we<00:04:24.010> just<00:04:24.520> going<00:04:24.880> to<00:04:24.970> hook<00:04:25.330> from<00:04:25.570> the

00:04:25.740 --> 00:04:25.750 
this one we just going to hook from the

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:29.250 
this one we just going to hook from the
bottom<00:04:26.110> here<00:04:26.880> okay<00:04:27.880> so<00:04:27.940> we<00:04:28.180> get<00:04:28.330> the<00:04:28.479> bottom<00:04:28.960> 2

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:29.260 
bottom here okay so we get the bottom 2

00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:55.800 
can see get the next bottom too so the

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:59.600 
can see get the next bottom too so the
two<00:04:55.980> pale<00:04:56.370> lilac<00:04:56.730> ones<00:04:57.210> in<00:04:57.420> my<00:04:57.570> case<00:04:58.190> hook<00:04:59.190> them

00:04:59.600 --> 00:04:59.610 
two pale lilac ones in my case hook them

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:03.590 
two pale lilac ones in my case hook them
over<00:05:00.360> and<00:05:00.510> let<00:05:00.690> go<00:05:01.790> then<00:05:02.790> this<00:05:03.210> is<00:05:03.300> quite<00:05:03.570> a

00:05:03.590 --> 00:05:03.600 
over and let go then this is quite a

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:06.170 
over and let go then this is quite a
treat<00:05:03.990> film<00:05:04.440> and<00:05:05.250> try<00:05:05.430> and<00:05:05.490> hold<00:05:05.700> it<00:05:05.880> at<00:05:06.000> a<00:05:06.060> good

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:06.180 
treat film and try and hold it at a good

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:09.760 
treat film and try and hold it at a good
angle<00:05:06.950> then<00:05:07.950> the<00:05:08.130> next<00:05:08.280> two<00:05:08.610> powerful<00:05:08.880> ones

00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:09.770 
angle then the next two powerful ones

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:14.720 
angle then the next two powerful ones
you<00:05:10.770> left<00:05:10.950> over<00:05:11.990> then<00:05:12.990> we<00:05:13.230> hook<00:05:13.500> the<00:05:13.770> last<00:05:14.250> two

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:14.730 
you left over then we hook the last two

00:05:14.730 --> 00:05:19.220 
you left over then we hook the last two
purple<00:05:15.120> ones<00:05:15.270> and<00:05:15.830> lift<00:05:16.830> over<00:05:17.900> this<00:05:18.900> is<00:05:19.110> the

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:19.230 
purple ones and lift over this is the

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:22.550 
purple ones and lift over this is the
basic<00:05:19.560> principle<00:05:20.520> of<00:05:20.610> the<00:05:20.820> design<00:05:21.380> so<00:05:22.380> if<00:05:22.440> you

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:22.560 
basic principle of the design so if you

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:25.730 
basic principle of the design so if you
can<00:05:22.710> do<00:05:22.890> this<00:05:23.570> this<00:05:24.570> will<00:05:24.780> hopefully<00:05:24.990> work<00:05:25.380> for

00:05:25.730 --> 00:05:25.740 
can do this this will hopefully work for

00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:28.970 
can do this this will hopefully work for
you<00:05:26.150> then<00:05:27.150> we<00:05:27.270> will<00:05:27.480> put<00:05:27.720> these<00:05:28.140> down<00:05:28.500> just

00:05:28.970 --> 00:05:28.980 
you then we will put these down just

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:33.010 
you then we will put these down just
make<00:05:29.070> a<00:05:29.250> bit<00:05:29.460> simpler<00:05:30.500> now<00:05:31.500> like<00:05:32.130> a<00:05:32.160> fishtail

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:33.020 
make a bit simpler now like a fishtail

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:36.890 
make a bit simpler now like a fishtail
you<00:05:34.020> want<00:05:34.230> street<00:05:34.590> light<00:05:35.130> layer<00:05:35.490> oh<00:05:35.700> its<00:05:36.630> kind

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:36.900 
you want street light layer oh its kind

00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:39.470 
you want street light layer oh its kind
to<00:05:36.960> only<00:05:37.230> two<00:05:37.590> bands<00:05:38.040> of<00:05:38.160> H<00:05:38.340> but<00:05:38.790> we<00:05:38.880> want<00:05:39.060> three

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:39.480 
to only two bands of H but we want three

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:44.030 
to only two bands of H but we want three
kind<00:05:39.840> of<00:05:39.990> you<00:05:40.080> know<00:05:40.310> layers<00:05:41.310> of<00:05:41.970> each<00:05:42.180> color<00:05:43.040> on

00:05:44.030 --> 00:05:44.040 
kind of you know layers of each color on

00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:46.570 
kind of you know layers of each color on
each<00:05:44.190> peg<00:05:44.550> so<00:05:44.970> off<00:05:45.150> as<00:05:45.450> we<00:05:45.600> just<00:05:45.750> take<00:05:45.930> them<00:05:46.020> off

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:46.580 
each peg so off as we just take them off

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:51.050 
each peg so off as we just take them off
you<00:05:47.580> put<00:05:47.940> more<00:05:48.180> on<00:05:48.240> from<00:05:48.780> here<00:05:48.990> to<00:05:49.200> here<00:05:50.060> here

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:51.060 
you put more on from here to here here

00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:57.560 
you put more on from here to here here
to<00:05:51.270> hair<00:05:52.400> here<00:05:53.400> the<00:05:53.670> hair<00:05:53.940> and<00:05:55.130> lastly<00:05:56.510> go<00:05:57.510> to

00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:57.570 
to hair here the hair and lastly go to

00:05:57.570 --> 00:06:00.680 
to hair here the hair and lastly go to
hair<00:05:58.050> I<00:05:58.580> bet<00:05:59.580> you<00:05:59.700> can<00:05:59.850> probably<00:06:00.060> guess<00:06:00.180> ready

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:00.690 
hair I bet you can probably guess ready

00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:03.860 
hair I bet you can probably guess ready
what<00:06:00.990> we<00:06:01.110> going<00:06:01.320> to<00:06:01.500> do<00:06:01.680> next<00:06:02.360> hook<00:06:03.360> the<00:06:03.390> bottom

two this time deep purple bands pull
them<00:06:07.770> back<00:06:08.270> lift<00:06:09.270> them<00:06:09.480> over<00:06:09.630> the<00:06:10.140> peg<00:06:10.410> and<00:06:10.740> let

00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:11.730 
them back lift them over the peg and let

00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:17.630 
them back lift them over the peg and let
go<00:06:12.740> now<00:06:13.740> the<00:06:13.800> two<00:06:14.250> powerful<00:06:14.520> bantam<00:06:15.120> here<00:06:16.640> over

00:06:17.630 --> 00:06:17.640 
go now the two powerful bantam here over

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:22.360 
go now the two powerful bantam here over
let<00:06:18.480> go<00:06:19.220> now<00:06:20.220> so<00:06:21.030> I<00:06:21.060> always<00:06:21.390> turn<00:06:21.630> this<00:06:21.900> a<00:06:21.960> bit

00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:22.370 
let go now so I always turn this a bit

00:06:22.370 --> 00:06:25.460 
let go now so I always turn this a bit
so<00:06:23.370> I<00:06:23.430> can<00:06:23.520> see<00:06:23.910> now<00:06:24.120> sorry<00:06:24.780> guys<00:06:25.050> this

so I can see now sorry guys this
probably<00:06:25.890> the<00:06:26.040> bad<00:06:26.190> angle<00:06:26.810> it's<00:06:27.810> just<00:06:28.050> so<00:06:28.170> I

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:28.230 
probably the bad angle it's just so I

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:30.290 
probably the bad angle it's just so I
can<00:06:28.320> do<00:06:28.650> it<00:06:28.860> yes<00:06:29.070> more<00:06:29.460> one<00:06:29.640> moving<00:06:30.000> the<00:06:30.120> Loom

00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:30.300 
can do it yes more one moving the Loom

00:06:30.300 --> 00:06:31.910 
can do it yes more one moving the Loom
around<00:06:30.330> a<00:06:30.750> bit<00:06:30.930> so<00:06:31.200> it<00:06:31.260> might<00:06:31.440> be<00:06:31.560> quite

00:06:31.910 --> 00:06:31.920 
around a bit so it might be quite

00:06:31.920 --> 00:06:36.560 
around a bit so it might be quite
horrible<00:06:32.550> to<00:06:33.120> film<00:06:33.420> but<00:06:33.930> yeah<00:06:35.000> left<00:06:36.000> over

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:36.570 
horrible to film but yeah left over

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:39.590 
horrible to film but yeah left over
hopefully<00:06:37.440> we'll<00:06:37.680> right<00:06:38.240> here<00:06:39.240> we<00:06:39.300> get<00:06:39.450> the

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:39.600 
hopefully we'll right here we get the

00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:41.600 
hopefully we'll right here we get the
last<00:06:39.870> two<00:06:40.260> purples

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:41.610 
last two purples

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:46.470 
last two purples
over<00:06:42.610> and<00:06:42.820> let<00:06:43.060> go<00:06:44.070> now<00:06:45.070> we<00:06:45.130> just<00:06:45.610> repeat<00:06:46.090> this

00:06:46.470 --> 00:06:46.480 
over and let go now we just repeat this

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:50.550 
over and let go now we just repeat this
again<00:06:47.470> and<00:06:47.890> again<00:06:48.010> and<00:06:48.340> again<00:06:48.640> and<00:06:49.380> to<00:06:50.380> begin
