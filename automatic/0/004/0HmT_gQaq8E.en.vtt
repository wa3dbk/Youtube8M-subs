00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:04.700
 very good of all we are in the jump 

00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:07.399
 of stain and we will need to be the 

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:09.889
 manufacturers people also here there are 

00:00:07.399 --> 00:00:13.669
 one as you are looking under the arch 

00:00:09.889 --> 00:00:15.850
 there's another one here to the right of wentz 

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:18.370
 there's another one over here 

00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:22.120
 There is one in our beloved and beloved puzzle 

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:23.490
 and another dad's surf in the puzzle what 

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:27.930
 I'm going to do 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:27.930
 good or not depends on the peaks 

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:35.350
 let's go coupling and from there we're going to 

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:39.940
 put him through all 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:48.670
 very band raptors 

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:50.170
 If I take the puzzle, I can leave it for the 

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:51.850
 final because you already know that you have the 

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:54.760
 puzzle 

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:57.309
 and engraver on top of the scavenger 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:59.260
 except possibly puzzles 

00:00:57.309 --> 00:01:01.320
 come out in the second part since the other 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:04.970
 I went out the first time 

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:04.970
 although it is only to advance a little bit more 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:10.320
 a tangle of resurgence that has been 

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:10.320
 of talgo 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:18.200
 I am 

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:26.609
 they are a little cantinas to be one 

00:01:22.659 --> 00:01:26.609
 Once just taking affection 

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:37.659
 Local here is mineral so the 

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:37.659
 love to the perfect 

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:44.100
 because time that 

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:45.350
 I regret I did not know us as we 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:48.230
 is it so 

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:51.960
 intelligent we could not know it is that 

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:53.750
 there are people that in a few seconds those 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.040
 points 

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.360
 and the mouse over you do not get the 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.000
 statistics like to me for example 

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:02.870
 I do not leave the clan either because in this 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.870
 they are doing nothing 

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:09.010
 positions to statistics do you have in 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:09.010
 the world is one played the rule 

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:15.940
 sooner rather than later I hope because that 

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:18.940
 it makes us collect less than 

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:18.940
 Mites 

00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:23.950
 a moral issue I do not know if it has been so many 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:25.900
 server changes I've done is you have 

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:30.720
 gone crazy but well there I have 

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:30.720
 I really would have it because they are crafts 

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:36.930
 of collector as interested 

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:38.370
 but good you do not have anything good because 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:41.930
 it is quite noticeable when picking up 

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:41.930
 gold xxi things like that 

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.460
 are videos with here is the pain and 

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:51.410
 tracing 1 you have to the right of 

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:51.410
 wentz and we're looking at dad 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:00.209
 he pays without lending, he is not 

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:08.310
 the fixed site I do not know always and walter the 

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:08.310
 puzzle 50 because you do not pay is always 

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:15.020
 now feel rotation to leave me wrong 

00:03:10.709 --> 00:03:18.370
 it is not but it does not happen 

00:03:15.020 --> 00:03:18.370
 here is the pay 

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:26.260
 let's say to the puzzle 

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:30.530
 to see what would happen if the above 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:30.530
 speaks 

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:42.990
 look no longer worth 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:46.350
 to below payment on those looking from 

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:46.350
 the doors 

00:03:46.890 --> 00:03:53.270
 in the goal will be a while 

00:03:51.569 --> 00:03:58.180
 Georgians 

00:03:53.270 --> 00:04:01.420
 although he was always just annoyed 

00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:01.420
 because there is no 

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:08.680
 so not fair 

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:14.380
 Attentively to the cascade of form 

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:19.859
 make motive 

00:04:16.850 --> 00:04:25.510
 not like before you try dead 

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:28.570
 it's worth once we're here 

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:31.920
 and a question of knowing in which part of the 

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:31.920
 jump to move 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:37.120
 starts in the same 

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:39.650
 although the routes are several and I think 

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:42.070
 is in the same place, not yes 

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:45.860
 on the same sites for 

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:49.200
 it puts me down that it's perfect 

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:51.090
 - jump these are the jump 

00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:53.690
 march now I'm going for the phones 

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:53.690
 askartza
