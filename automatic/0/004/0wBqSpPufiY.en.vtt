00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:38.590
 Today, Maria Paula sends us 

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:40.390
 ecuador and says well hello I'm from ecuador and 

00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:42.490
 I've always liked the world of 

00:00:40.390 --> 00:00:45.250
 makeup but I think it's not possible 

00:00:42.490 --> 00:00:46.920
 for women who do not have contacts or 

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:49.930
 relationship with the world of entertainment 

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:53.440
 to work or become as 

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:55.719
 you say successful make-up artists 

00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:58.449
 Well Maria Paula, I'm very happy 

00:00:55.719 --> 00:01:00.010
 write to us and I'm also glad that we 

00:00:58.449 --> 00:01:03.730
 You will leave your comment because I should 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:05.740
 tell you that I understand you and that it is possible 

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:08.380
 that many makeup lovers 

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:10.420
 The same thing happens to you and they think 

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:13.060
 in this way since the schools 

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:16.450
 traditional makeup do not teach 

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:19.780
 generate opportunities for their students and if 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:21.340
 you see it from that perspective you are right 

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.979
 if you only do a makeup course 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:27.909
 where you learn some techniques and you 

00:01:23.979 --> 00:01:29.800
 training there it ends I agree that 

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:32.590
 think in this way that you think that 

00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:35.560
 You can not go far but if I tell you 

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:38.319
 in your makeup we do not think like we 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:40.390
 beyond because it really interests us and 

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:42.819
 We are committed that our 

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:45.159
 students are make-up artists in active 

00:01:42.819 --> 00:01:46.380
 successful make-up artists as I like 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:48.540
 tell 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:51.450
 and what would you say to me 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:52.770
 what would you think if I told you that the head of 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.050
 makeup team of one of the 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.330
 most famous programs of ecuador was 

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:59.730
 student of your doctor or that schools 

00:01:57.330 --> 00:02:02.700
 of makeup that exist today in ecuador 

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:04.500
 are of students of your americas would you follow 

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.440
 thinking that you have to have 

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:08.429
 unknown to reach your goals 

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:10.730
 you would still believe that the world of 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:12.960
 makeup is for a handful of chosen 

00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:15.210
 I made my career as a make-up artist 

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:17.820

00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:20.700

 known and without any kind of 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:27.060
