remember if i actually did the routine
and<00:04:02.790> that<00:04:02.910> one<00:04:03.060> or<00:04:03.269> not<00:04:03.450> but<00:04:03.810> anyways<00:04:04.580> so

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:05.580 
and that one or not but anyways so

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:07.610 
and that one or not but anyways so
that's<00:04:05.760> where<00:04:06.000> you<00:04:06.060> can<00:04:06.239> see<00:04:06.450> that<00:04:06.480> so<00:04:07.350> as<00:04:07.590> far

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:07.620 
that's where you can see that so as far

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:10.190 
that's where you can see that so as far
as<00:04:07.860> bronzers<00:04:08.550> go<00:04:08.820> i'm<00:04:09.090> still<00:04:09.690> using<00:04:09.959> the

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:10.200 
as bronzers go i'm still using the

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.110 
as bronzers go i'm still using the
Browns<00:04:10.440> booster<00:04:10.950> by<00:04:11.130> physicians<00:04:11.430> formula

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:12.120 
Browns booster by physicians formula

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:15.740 
Browns booster by physicians formula
this<00:04:12.840> gives<00:04:13.110> you<00:04:13.230> a<00:04:13.290> good<00:04:13.650> amount<00:04:14.580> of<00:04:14.940> shine<00:04:15.300> or

00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:15.750 
this gives you a good amount of shine or

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:17.560 
this gives you a good amount of shine or
shimmer<00:04:16.080> i<00:04:16.200> guess<00:04:16.530> because<00:04:16.680> china<00:04:17.070> isn't

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:17.570 
shimmer i guess because china isn't

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:18.850 
shimmer i guess because china isn't
good<00:04:17.690> when<00:04:17.900> you<00:04:17.990> have<00:04:18.020> oily<00:04:18.290> skin<00:04:18.500> especially
