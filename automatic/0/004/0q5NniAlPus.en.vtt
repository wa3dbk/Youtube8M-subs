second volley but this time accounting
for<00:00:35.520> the<00:00:35.610> inertia<00:00:35.940> it'll<00:00:36.809> take<00:00:36.960> some<00:00:37.110> practice

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:37.590 
for the inertia it'll take some practice

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:38.869

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:40.590 
inertia but once you get it down you

inertia but once you get it down you
should<00:00:40.920> be<00:00:40.980> much<00:00:41.160> more<00:00:41.309> accurate<00:00:41.820> and

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
should be much more accurate and

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:43.940 
should be much more accurate and
confident<00:00:42.390> that<00:00:42.510> you'll<00:00:42.690> hit<00:00:42.840> the<00:00:42.960> target<00:00:43.320> I'm

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:43.950 
confident that you'll hit the target I'm

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.200 
confident that you'll hit the target I'm
going<00:00:44.160> to<00:00:44.219> show<00:00:44.309> you<00:00:44.370> a<00:00:44.430> clip<00:00:44.579> of<00:00:44.700> gameplay<00:00:45.030> of

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:49.140 
it back a second time with narration

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:59.630 
it back a second time with narration
walking<00:00:49.710> through<00:00:49.860> my<00:00:50.010> mindset

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:01.640 

if<00:01:00.120> you<00:01:00.300> look<00:01:00.480> at<00:01:00.570> the<00:01:00.630> clip<00:01:00.840> you<00:01:01.110> can<00:01:01.290> see<00:01:01.500> that

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:01.650 
if you look at the clip you can see that

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:03.590 
if you look at the clip you can see that
I<00:01:01.680> acquire<00:01:02.070> my<00:01:02.250> target<00:01:02.640> take<00:01:03.090> an<00:01:03.210> educated

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:03.600 
I acquire my target take an educated

00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.420 
I acquire my target take an educated
guess<00:01:03.750> on<00:01:04.170> where<00:01:04.410> the<00:01:04.590> rocket<00:01:04.920> will<00:01:05.070> go<00:01:05.220> and

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
guess on where the rocket will go and

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:08.030 
guess on where the rocket will go and
volley<00:01:05.910> it<00:01:06.630> misses<00:01:06.990> the<00:01:07.140> target<00:01:07.290> I<00:01:07.590> then

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:08.040 
volley it misses the target I then

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.250 
volley it misses the target I then
proceed<00:01:08.460> to<00:01:08.490> adjust<00:01:09.000> my<00:01:09.150> aim<00:01:09.330> accounting<00:01:10.050> for

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
proceed to adjust my aim accounting for

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.140 
proceed to adjust my aim accounting for
the<00:01:10.350> inertia<00:01:10.650> and<00:01:11.010> get<00:01:11.340> a<00:01:11.370> direct<00:01:11.580> hit<00:01:11.910> on<00:01:11.970> the
