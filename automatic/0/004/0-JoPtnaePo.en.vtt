00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:20.380
 I bought from the cone version 

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:23.260
 it goes from 100 cm so a meter has it 

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:25.060
 paid on amazon for 227 euros 

00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:27.970
 there is also the 80 centimeter version 

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:30.279
 which costs 213 euros so for one 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:31.990
 difference of about 10 euros preferred 

00:00:30.279 --> 00:00:34.780
 the longest one 

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:37.870
 then the slider is supplied with one 

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:42.489
 very practical case that this one 

00:00:37.870 --> 00:00:48.760
 you see it is padded so also a lot 

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:50.950
 sure now let's see in detail the 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:53.489
 features of the slider and those 

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:57.250
 of its components 

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:59.860
 then the slider has numerous holes 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:01.570
 either that three eighths and quarter 

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:04.720
 in this case then you can mount the 

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:07.330
 tripods both in the center of the slider and 

00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:09.970
 on the sides of the slider then another 

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:13.479
 bubble slider feature of 

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:15.310
 alignment is the compass even if not 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:15.970
 I know how useful the compass is 

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:18.459
 on the star 

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:22.060
 now let's see the components of the 

00:01:18.459 --> 00:01:25.360
 slider then the slider comes with 

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:28.569
 two rubber cleaning accessories 

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:31.229
 of the slider itself so you want 

00:01:28.569 --> 00:01:34.240
 these accessories in turned style is 

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:36.520
 skid to clean the to clean from 

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:37.880
 then he has other essential accessories 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:39.920
 are the 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:44.030
 the supports are supplied even if of 

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:46.460
 case as the slider then these 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.509
 are the supports and are fitted to the 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:51.020
 sides of the slider 

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:54.619
 now I'll show you how you can 

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:57.860
 note that there are two holes ai sia dal 

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:59.329
 side than the other then the holes then 

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:02.869
 do not kiss with these vines of the 

00:01:59.329 --> 00:02:08.149
 support and you hook the screw e 

00:02:02.869 --> 00:02:10.880
 turn this this wheel this 

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:13.160
 support is not well welded to the slider e 

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:15.200
 it moves you can also the slider will be 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.900
 unstable so the shooting is bad 

00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:20.510
 and you can also set the opening of 

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:24.670
 these of these let's call them feet 

00:02:20.510 --> 00:02:27.739
 turn the wheel and you can mini adjust 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:32.140
 another feature of the slider 

00:02:27.739 --> 00:02:34.610
 they are also the holes with a quarter hook 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:36.980
 on the extremes these holes that allow 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:39.140
 to hook up the magic cards and then to 

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:41.569
 mount both LED panels on the slider 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:42.680
 as well as the microphones and is one 

00:02:41.569 --> 00:02:45.859
 feature that to me personally 

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:47.420
 really like it here to mount it on 

00:02:45.859 --> 00:02:50.709
 any type of surface can 

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:50.709
 can also be mounted on a tripod 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:01.379
 and this then and here he mounted it 

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:05.549
 on this three feet but still 5.5 

00:03:01.379 --> 00:03:09.390
 liter this is turning the crank 

00:03:05.549 --> 00:03:11.909
 you can keep it sias firm then stable 

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:15.349
 both may be avoided by precisely the movement 

00:03:11.909 --> 00:03:15.349
 so look for these two movements 

00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:23.400
 I recommend buying a head 

00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:25.739
 fluid of any brand is fine from 

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:30.379
 be able to mount on the slider so as to 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:30.379
 be able to obtain various movements 

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:37.829
 ok now as you can see beyond that 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:40.439
 type of movement that movement 

00:03:37.829 --> 00:03:43.530
 basic of the slider you can move 

00:03:40.439 --> 00:03:49.739
 you can also use the fluid head 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:52.519
 this movement is also doing 

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:55.260
 all the movements that you like most 

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:59.760
 you can also understand why I have 

00:03:55.260 --> 00:04:02.120
 purchased test three feet and head e 

00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:04.139
 fluid head and separately why 

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:07.290
 understand well that if you buy a 

00:04:04.139 --> 00:04:09.000
 tripods all in one piece you can't 

00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:11.310
 have this type of asset and therefore 

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:14.419
 you lose the movement you get with 

00:04:11.310 --> 00:04:17.070
 head plus more briefs 

00:04:14.419 --> 00:04:19.530
 as you also know in video making is 

00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:21.209
 recommended to use fixed focal length lenses 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:23.699
 then those that are called slow 

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:26.039
 primary then when you have this type 

00:04:23.699 --> 00:04:29.130
 of lenses it is not possible to do that is 

00:04:26.039 --> 00:04:32.120
 zooming that the glaze and then the slider 

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:32.120
 can allow you to do 

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:46.720
 to this also another way of mounting 

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:48.730
 the slider that is instead of using a 

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:51.820
 only between the feet in the middle of the sleigh 

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:53.980
 mounted two at the ends and is 

00:04:51.820 --> 00:04:54.640
 definitely much more stable to hold 

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:57.250
 the slider 

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:59.590
 now let's see some of the movement that 

00:04:57.250 --> 00:05:08.430
 which allows us to do this writing 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:08.430
 those the movement is very very fluid 

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:23.440
 I'm up to now to show you in short 

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:25.490
 the features of this slider 

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:27.230
 got this on the fluid head 

00:05:25.490 --> 00:05:29.360
 digital camera 

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:31.430
 actually however in all the tests you have 

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:33.410
 net the canon 60d was used then i 

00:05:31.430 --> 00:05:35.780
 various goals that I will then put in 

00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:38.210
 description for this review 

00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:39.650
 we're done don't miss the next one 

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:42.370
 video next week always 

00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:42.370
 then 

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:52.240
 to forced labor 

00:05:48.830 --> 00:05:52.240
 you risk pushing everyone 

00:05:57.250 --> 00:06:00.490
 a thriller 

00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:12.410
 see you at the band you were 66 

00:06:10.110 --> 00:06:12.410
 why
