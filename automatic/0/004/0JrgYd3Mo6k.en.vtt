00:00:21.759 --> 00:00:27.460
 big enough here we see it 

00:00:24.429 --> 00:00:30.579
 plus this quick setting is really 

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:32.829
 the router is configured very quickly mrs 

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:35.790

00:00:32.829 --> 00:00:38.170
 connect up to two aisitives 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:42.909
 Here is such a model are progressing 

00:00:38.170 --> 00:00:47.559
 Russian providers he supports 

00:00:42.909 --> 00:00:48.729
 like mako and 100k minus 8 here we see 

00:00:47.559 --> 00:00:51.910

00:00:48.729 --> 00:00:53.109
 how to configure and distribution 

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:54.670
 access speed 

00:00:53.109 --> 00:00:57.609
 five devices work fine 

00:00:54.670 --> 00:01:00.370
 practically without great loss of speed 

00:00:57.609 --> 00:01:03.030
 this is a very big plus here we open 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:07.410
 box here we will drive and 

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.410
 English user manual 

00:01:08.399 --> 00:01:14.670
 language 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.670
 here he is a router 

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:20.320
 This is how it should look like. 

00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:25.570
 very nice circle around here 

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:28.630
 The material here is this indicator of such 

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:32.050
 as well as in all routers from these sides 

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:32.650
 there is nothing behind we see mount on 

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:39.160
 the wall 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:40.740
 and here we see a button for the antenna 

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:45.700
 although rss 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:48.010
 shutdown charging for the internet and 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:51.490
 connect the computer to this button 

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:54.190
 quick setup and beating port yuesby 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:56.940
 we can connect flash drives all printers 

00:01:54.190 --> 00:01:59.860
 so that comes with it 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:00.550
 so here is an adapter or I don't know what 

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:04.150
 it is 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:07.210
 and to make it easier to shove him 

00:02:04.150 --> 00:02:13.830
 stick all sorts who is so well here 

00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:13.830
 card antenna turns it on here and 

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:21.970
 like this way it looks like this 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:24.720
 so look further, we see only 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:27.640
 which we can connect to the computer and 

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:31.690

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:33.850
 router from 800 to 1800 rubles for these 

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:36.400
 money is very good company advise everyone 

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:39.910

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:43.420
 speed loss that 's all subscribe 

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:45.959
