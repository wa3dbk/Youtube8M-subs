00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:03.170
 or the one that most friend throw to the iphone 

00:00:01.969 --> 00:00:05.210
 Welcome back to our channel 

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:06.259
 dedicated to the apple world in this short 

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:09.019
 video we are going to show you how 

00:00:06.259 --> 00:00:11.510
 rearrange the icons that have to 

00:00:09.019 --> 00:00:13.190
 see with the option to share in 

00:00:11.510 --> 00:00:16.070
 our iphone in this case with the 

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:17.900
 iphone with the operating system ios 8 and 

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:20.089
 later show in detail that 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:22.400
 I'm talking but before we invite you 

00:00:20.089 --> 00:00:24.109
 to subscribe to your channel will give 

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:25.970
 click below says subscribe those 

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:26.659
 I bring subscription is completely 

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:28.880
 free 

00:00:26.659 --> 00:00:30.109
 in this way they can be aware of 

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:33.380
 all audios and frequent 

00:00:30.109 --> 00:00:34.820
 comments or suggestions then each 

00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:36.590
 time we're going to share for example 

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:38.300
 a photo we must enter the option of 

00:00:36.590 --> 00:00:40.730
 share and within this option of 

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:43.100
 share we can use there is a can 

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:44.540
 have a large list of applications and 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.670
 very probably the one we use the most 

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:49.140
 until the end then this what 

00:00:46.670 --> 00:00:51.120
 let's teach them to reorganize 

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:52.620
 and then we are going to enter any 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.420
 application that allows us to use the 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.220
 option to share for example the one of 

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:58.500
 the photos we enter here in the gallery 

00:00:56.220 --> 00:01:01.290
 and we say to any photo for example 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:04.019
 this one if I want to share this photo 

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:05.820
 obviously if we are on an iphone or 

00:01:04.019 --> 00:01:07.619
 any device we will press that with 

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:09.450
 this icon on the left is 

00:01:07.619 --> 00:01:12.180
 shares with the centers add 

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.770
 favorites and with the one on the right it 

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:16.500
 erase enter with the one on the left 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.330
 to share and here are the 

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.539
 applications that allow you to share it 

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:23.910
 For example, go through Facebook 

00:01:21.539 --> 00:01:26.280
 twitter flickr 

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:28.320
 we could have a lot also if 

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.910
 we would like to suddenly flicker 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:31.800
 it was first because it 's the one 

00:01:29.910 --> 00:01:34.200
 we like it better because this is what we are going 

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:36.390
 to teach him how to do it is very easy 

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.670
 simple we just make a finger the 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.830
 flickr button we give you the button 

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:43.970
 sunk with the finger pressed and then 

00:01:40.830 --> 00:01:47.100
 we are moving it towards the 

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:48.180
 left or where we want to go 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:50.100
 be 

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:53.130
 let's say that this phone add it to 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:55.560
 a person who uses flickr more and 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.880
 we are a user that we like 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.310
 share more through twitter 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:01.710
 so what we do can we carry 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:03.150
 be flickr for the right or bring the 

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:04.670
 twitter for the left 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:06.600
 we have the twitter for the left 

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:09.890
 we leave the button a god on the 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:12.890
 twitter and we move it and we move it 

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:12.890
 toward 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:19.049
 to the left so easy we can 

00:02:16.019 --> 00:02:20.040
 reorganize these sharing icons in 

00:02:19.049 --> 00:02:22.439
 the case that we would like 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:25.079
 definitely eliminate the freak air 

00:02:22.439 --> 00:02:27.480
 let's go in here where it says more and 

00:02:25.079 --> 00:02:30.629
 here where flicker says we deactivate it 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:32.549
 and ready if we want to take the facebook 

00:02:30.629 --> 00:02:34.980
 it was like up 

00:02:32.549 --> 00:02:37.139
 we left the button sunk here and ready 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:40.349
 this is the easy way to do it 

00:02:37.139 --> 00:02:43.049
 we give ok and as you can see facebook 

00:02:40.349 --> 00:02:45.359
 it was first publish was eliminated and 

00:02:43.049 --> 00:02:46.500
 is already budgeted for this video 

00:02:45.359 --> 00:02:48.389
