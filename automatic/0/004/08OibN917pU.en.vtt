 make medical landing chocolate 

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:30.590
 resistance 

00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:40.070
 for me my trees when I walk here I 

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:41.690
 I feel something delicate I come to talk 

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:43.850
 with them 

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:46.699
 I feel I tell you that the day you no longer 

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:47.860
 I'm maybe my children are going to 

00:00:46.699 --> 00:00:50.480
 give 

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:54.320
 to destroy 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:58.450
 but as long as I and God give me 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:58.450
 I tell you, that's my dream 

00:01:03.299 --> 00:01:09.700
 this grain in the 19th century there were 1,800 

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:12.670
 hectares 

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:14.320
 a year ago there were four after the 

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:18.850
 decline of oil and people do not 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:20.470
 wants to live here wants easy money 

00:01:18.850 --> 00:01:23.350
 You not want to go cultivated not want 

00:01:20.470 --> 00:01:26.590
 harvest the youth represents poverty 

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:28.480
 cocoa and being indigenous they do not 

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:30.790
 they want 

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:31.810
 make people who have money with 

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:34.780
 Petroleum 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:39.250
 cocoa keeps us and have grown 

00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:42.070
 grieving children and coughing and cutting copayment 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:44.410
 there I will die with that coast of sowing 

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:46.750
 cocoa in seeds so that the chocolate 

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:50.820
 represents not only the possibility 

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:53.070
 of flavor and agriculture but 

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:55.800
 the approach to wealth and 

00:01:53.070 --> 00:01:58.500
 poverty of a willing spirit we are 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:00.870
 the country or the place that gave him the 

00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.170
 chocolate to the planet to the world but 

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:05.479
 us two 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:07.729
 yes we did that with such a pleasure 

00:02:05.479 --> 00:02:10.000
 extraordinary that we can do 

00:02:07.729 --> 00:02:10.000
 comments 

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:25.140
 I think that in our country there are great 

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:28.840
 spaces of culture and history and 

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:31.270
 we need to be able to collaborate with those 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.780
 places those spaces and we have to 

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:36.480
 take actions 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:39.360
 what do you call this chocolate for its 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:42.290
 nature and for its agriculture is the 

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.290
 squirrel eats it 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:50.600
 the squirrel eats it and takes out the seed 

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:53.520
 there is a lot but we do not kill them because 

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:56.340
 Well, they also have the right 

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:59.340
 to eat 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:01.850
 we want to live also in the 

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:06.790
 animals we want 

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:06.790
 a noble and exuberant chocolate 

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:17.370
 it's not a treat is this is eating with 

00:03:13.959 --> 00:03:17.370
 more chocolate spirituality 

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:23.240
 it was the chocolate that made us brothers 

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:26.000
 genetically of the planet in our 

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:28.280
 genetic we carry that memory maybe we 

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.890
 we have forgotten in the mind but I think that 

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:32.660
 when we do not eat this in Mexico the 

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:35.170
 Mexicans are able to get excited 

00:03:32.660 --> 00:03:35.170
 for this 

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:42.260
 that will be yours when I no longer 

00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:42.260
 this 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:48.220
 you will also end up because 

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:48.220
 he will not see us defend
