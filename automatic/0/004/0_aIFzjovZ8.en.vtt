00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:04.410 
in step 5 on page 21 17 we're going to

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:08.709 
in step 5 on page 21 17 we're going to
install<00:00:04.859> the<00:00:05.220> steps<00:00:05.790> that<00:00:06.089> we<00:00:06.180> just<00:00:06.210> created

00:00:08.709 --> 00:00:08.719 
install the steps that we just created

00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:11.570 
install the steps that we just created
starting<00:00:09.719> with<00:00:09.929> the<00:00:10.139> narrow<00:00:10.860> one<00:00:11.190> the<00:00:11.429> one

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:11.580 
starting with the narrow one the one

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:14.720 
starting with the narrow one the one
that<00:00:11.730> we<00:00:11.880> trimmed<00:00:12.540> on<00:00:12.780> the<00:00:12.900> face<00:00:13.250> will<00:00:14.250> install

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:14.730 
that we trimmed on the face will install

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:18.620 
that we trimmed on the face will install
that<00:00:15.139> against<00:00:16.139> the<00:00:16.379> rib<00:00:16.650> and<00:00:16.859> the<00:00:17.850> pre-drilled

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:18.630 
that against the rib and the pre-drilled

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:21.920 
that against the rib and the pre-drilled
holes<00:00:19.820> will<00:00:20.820> line<00:00:20.850> up<00:00:21.060> with<00:00:21.330> the<00:00:21.420> pre-drilled

00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:21.930 
holes will line up with the pre-drilled

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.929 
holes will line up with the pre-drilled
holes<00:00:22.230> in<00:00:22.590> the<00:00:22.650> rib<00:00:23.010> and<00:00:23.279> we'll<00:00:23.369> slide<00:00:23.670> this

00:00:23.929 --> 00:00:23.939 
holes in the rib and we'll slide this

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:27.439 
holes in the rib and we'll slide this
down<00:00:24.619> and<00:00:25.619> what<00:00:26.519> we're<00:00:26.640> going<00:00:26.730> to<00:00:26.820> do<00:00:27.029> then<00:00:27.269> is

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:27.449 
down and what we're going to do then is

00:00:27.449 --> 00:00:30.439 
down and what we're going to do then is
match<00:00:27.750> drill<00:00:28.199> the<00:00:28.859> pre-drilled<00:00:29.310> holes<00:00:29.699> in<00:00:29.970> the

00:00:30.439 --> 00:00:30.449 
match drill the pre-drilled holes in the

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.639 
match drill the pre-drilled holes in the
front<00:00:30.660> of<00:00:30.750> the<00:00:30.840> bulkhead<00:00:31.250> into<00:00:33.140> the<00:00:34.140> face<00:00:34.410> over

00:00:34.639 --> 00:00:34.649 
front of the bulkhead into the face over

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:52.560 
front of the bulkhead into the face over
here<00:00:34.800> so<00:00:35.219> click<00:00:35.550> this<00:00:35.880> in<00:00:36.059> place

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:52.570 

00:00:52.570 --> 00:00:56.940 

and<00:00:53.250> we'll<00:00:54.250> repeat<00:00:54.610> this<00:00:54.850> operation<00:00:55.060> for<00:00:55.960> the

00:00:56.940 --> 00:00:56.950 
and we'll repeat this operation for the

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:08.310 
and we'll repeat this operation for the
other<00:00:57.160> side

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:08.320 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:11.130 

in<00:01:08.590> step<00:01:09.490> six<00:01:09.880> we're<00:01:10.210> going<00:01:10.390> to<00:01:10.479> be<00:01:10.570> lining<00:01:10.900> up

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:11.140 
in step six we're going to be lining up

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:13.890 
in step six we're going to be lining up
and<00:01:11.350> attaching<00:01:11.950> our<00:01:12.220> step<00:01:12.729> this<00:01:13.210> is<00:01:13.270> a<00:01:13.420> steel

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:13.900 
and attaching our step this is a steel

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:18.469 
and attaching our step this is a steel
part<00:01:14.320> and<00:01:14.560> it<00:01:15.490> has<00:01:15.729> two<00:01:16.479> quarter<00:01:17.410> inch<00:01:17.440> holes

00:01:18.469 --> 00:01:18.479 
part and it has two quarter inch holes

00:01:18.479 --> 00:01:23.820 
part and it has two quarter inch holes
now<00:01:19.479> this<00:01:19.780> will<00:01:19.990> end<00:01:20.200> up<00:01:20.410> going<00:01:20.860> in<00:01:21.450> this<00:01:22.830> area

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:23.830 
now this will end up going in this area

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:27.540 
now this will end up going in this area
so<00:01:24.820> step<00:01:25.360> six<00:01:25.390> will<00:01:25.840> have<00:01:26.080> us<00:01:26.290> drill<00:01:26.740> this

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:27.550 
so step six will have us drill this

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:30.600 
so step six will have us drill this
bottom<00:01:28.030> hole<00:01:28.300> to<00:01:28.690> a<00:01:28.720> quarter<00:01:29.229> inch<00:01:29.460> because<00:01:30.460> in

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:30.610 
bottom hole to a quarter inch because in

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:32.400 
bottom hole to a quarter inch because in
the<00:01:30.729> next<00:01:30.910> step<00:01:31.090> then<00:01:31.450> we<00:01:31.600> want<00:01:31.780> to<00:01:31.840> bolt<00:01:32.140> this

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:32.410 
the next step then we want to bolt this

00:01:32.410 --> 00:01:36.480 
the next step then we want to bolt this
up<00:01:32.770> using<00:01:33.670> the<00:01:33.940> quarter<00:01:34.240> inch<00:01:34.420> hole<00:01:35.220> right<00:01:36.220> in

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:36.490 
up using the quarter inch hole right in

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:40.100 
up using the quarter inch hole right in
this<00:01:36.640> location<00:01:37.090> here<00:01:38.220> now<00:01:39.220> we<00:01:39.310> can<00:01:39.580> take<00:01:39.820> the

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:40.110 
this location here now we can take the

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:47.550 
this location here now we can take the
quarter<00:01:41.110> inch<00:01:41.289> bolt<00:01:45.869> and<00:01:46.869> we're<00:01:47.380> going<00:01:47.530> to

00:01:47.550 --> 00:01:47.560 
quarter inch bolt and we're going to

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:57.930 
quarter inch bolt and we're going to
temporarily<00:01:49.530> bolt<00:01:50.530> this<00:01:50.770> in<00:01:51.009> place<00:01:56.820> so<00:01:57.820> in

00:01:57.930 --> 00:01:57.940 
temporarily bolt this in place so in

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:01.170 
temporarily bolt this in place so in
step<00:01:58.210> seven<00:01:58.660> we<00:01:58.899> temporarily<00:01:59.320> bolt<00:01:59.920> the<00:02:00.910> step

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:01.180 
step seven we temporarily bolt the step

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:03.660 
step seven we temporarily bolt the step
in<00:02:01.330> place<00:02:01.539> through<00:02:01.869> the<00:02:01.899> hole<00:02:02.200> now<00:02:03.130> on<00:02:03.280> step

00:02:03.660 --> 00:02:03.670 
in place through the hole now on step

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:08.580 
in place through the hole now on step
eight<00:02:04.110> we<00:02:05.110> want<00:02:05.350> to<00:02:05.500> position<00:02:05.680> this<00:02:07.380> so<00:02:08.380> that

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:08.590 
eight we want to position this so that

00:02:08.590 --> 00:02:12.060 
eight we want to position this so that
this<00:02:08.800> top<00:02:09.250> is<00:02:09.780> even<00:02:10.780> or<00:02:10.929> below<00:02:11.350> to<00:02:11.410> be<00:02:11.739> safe

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:12.070 
this top is even or below to be safe

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:14.460 
this top is even or below to be safe
than<00:02:13.000> the<00:02:13.239> start<00:02:13.540> of<00:02:13.660> the<00:02:13.750> radius<00:02:14.170> of<00:02:14.380> the

than the start of the radius of the
corner<00:02:14.860> here<00:02:15.130> so<00:02:15.160> once<00:02:15.580> we<00:02:15.760> locate<00:02:15.970> this<00:02:16.480> we

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:17.080 
corner here so once we locate this we

00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:19.259 
corner here so once we locate this we
can<00:02:17.230> clamp<00:02:17.530> it<00:02:17.650> in<00:02:17.799> place<00:02:17.830> and<00:02:18.370> then<00:02:18.970> match

00:02:19.259 --> 00:02:19.269 
can clamp it in place and then match

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:22.080 
can clamp it in place and then match
drill<00:02:19.660> the<00:02:19.810> quarter<00:02:20.110> inch<00:02:20.290> hole<00:02:20.620> through<00:02:21.580> the

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:35.640 
now I can use a punch to help locate the
hole<00:02:33.690> so<00:02:34.690> I<00:02:34.720> don't<00:02:34.930> have<00:02:35.079> to<00:02:35.200> drill<00:02:35.470> the

00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:35.650 
hole so I don't have to drill the

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:39.870 
hole so I don't have to drill the
quarter<00:02:35.980> inch<00:02:36.540> right<00:02:37.540> off<00:02:37.720> the<00:02:37.959> bat<00:02:38.700> and<00:02:39.700> I'll
