00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.460
 Hello, we are all here with the 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:23.800
 product specialist smooths 

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:25.840
 arancibia and today we are going to review the 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:29.560
 new top of line side by side daily 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:31.240
 with compressor line technology what 

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:33.490
 first I want to ask you what is 

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:35.320
 means this label that we see in 

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:37.270
 practically all refrigerators 

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:39.100
 I know it has something to do with the 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:41.140
 energy but 

00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:43.390
 It seems a little complex to understand 

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:44.859
 simple view for any user which 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:47.680
 also what I would say to know about 

00:00:44.859 --> 00:00:49.059
 this label this label serves as 

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:50.530
 this to look at what the topic is 

00:00:49.059 --> 00:00:52.120
 energetic the refrigerator how much 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:54.640
 consumes a refrigerator and what 

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:56.260
 classification has a classification is 

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.909
 the most efficient you can find 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.409
 therefore you have to look at the 

00:00:57.909 --> 00:01:01.629
 classification that has in this case a 

00:00:59.409 --> 00:01:04.210
 refrigerator plus more with a consumption 

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:06.280
 of 2007 and all that provides the 

00:01:04.210 --> 00:01:08.470
 net capacity to have the refrigerator 

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:10.840
 that you have also specified here 

00:01:08.470 --> 00:01:13.479
 He has also seen us in that he is 

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:15.460
 with this refrigerator has this new 

00:01:13.479 --> 00:01:17.020
 technology alain the compressor that I know 

00:01:15.460 --> 00:01:19.990
 what is it about 

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:21.729
 because the doctor what's new is not 

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:23.649
 linear compressors the new technology 

00:01:21.729 --> 00:01:25.300
 that brings the book to refrigerators 

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:27.130
 of this year therefore all the 

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:29.229
 linear compressor refrigerators go to 

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:30.670
 have four great features that 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:32.380
 they are going to keep your food 

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:34.149
 cool longer they have an engine 

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:37.360
 silent therefore no noise 

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:39.759
 they have a very low energy consumption 

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:41.170
 they are all refrigerators plus more than 

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:43.090
 save up to 80 percent of 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:46.479
 consumer energy 

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:49.630
 and it comes with 10 years guarantee time 

00:01:46.479 --> 00:01:52.270
 entering fully to this specifically 

00:01:49.630 --> 00:01:55.509
 this side by side the first thing that calls 

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:58.240
 my attention is this screen with many 

00:01:55.509 --> 00:02:01.179
 buttons and many possibilities has 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.649
 five functions in the first you what 

00:02:01.179 --> 00:02:04.659
 does is express crisis and means the 

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:06.609
 cold shock if you for example want 

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:08.170
 that the ice is made faster or you put 

00:02:06.609 --> 00:02:10.989
 something and you want it to freeze as much 

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:12.670
 possible fast you tighten this button and what 

00:02:10.989 --> 00:02:14.620
 what it does is that it shoots a 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:17.230
 super powerful fluted and also at 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:19.989
 press it for three seconds what 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:21.700
 happens is that the panel with the 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:23.140
 padlock button of the freezer what you 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:25.150
 does is regulate the temperatures of the 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:27.040
 freezer and with the one that says refrigerator 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:29.349
 regular temperature on the side of the 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:32.140
 refrigerator and here are the options 

00:02:29.349 --> 00:02:35.590
 for you to choose what is ice and afp 

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:38.560
 or water and this is the filter light 

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:41.769
 and this is let's say here that it seems like 

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:43.930
 a safe as something already that is 

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:46.000
 try that I represent is like the last 

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:47.920
 attribute that you have in the refrigerator to 

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.470
 the coolers the jee that is called 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:53.230
 humbert is aggravated by a bar the grace 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:55.480
 that press the button and go directly 

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:57.459
 to the port where you keep liquids and 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:03:00.790
 so you do not open the door to the refrigerator and 

00:02:57.459 --> 00:03:02.540
 consume even less in the perfect center 

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:05.390
 the fridge 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:09.319
 what is it that we could highlight I see that 

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:11.719
 they have many compartments this is the 

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:13.599
 back side true of the combat both 

00:03:11.719 --> 00:03:16.430
 the door as the refrigerator bottom 

00:03:13.599 --> 00:03:19.430
 It has the multiair flo and the system 

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:21.409
 door cooling that throw frozen air from 

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:23.000
 the two parties get also you 

00:03:21.409 --> 00:03:24.590
 helps to maintain the temperature better 

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.090
 inside the refrigerator and to keep 

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:28.700
 better food thank you very much 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:30.530
