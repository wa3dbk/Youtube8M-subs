00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:34.820
 You can put dollars on this in the room 

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.820

 water reservoir 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:53.490

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:58.850
 so I thought it was funny to be like this 

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.850
 to make 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.360
 yes you can but also this idea you must again 

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:09.170
 be improved but be changed 

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:09.170
 the beginning is there 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:17.900
 ok pour the coffee 

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:35.540
 so let me lay again just once again 

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:35.540
 let's see 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:41.900
 I now take the lid off 

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.900
 it is actually 

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:53.850
 bottom lint the case can so there 

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:57.480
 is not a zone so this push button what 

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:59.970
 you actually put your doorbell on you 

00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:06.480

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:14.000
 that to it 

00:03:22.959 --> 00:03:25.959
 assemble 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:37.550
 so a woman say the coffee can be full 

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:41.239
 if my coffee is running it will be you 

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:44.750
 by wanting sensors and goes 

00:03:41.239 --> 00:03:48.250
 so you give a signal one 

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:48.250

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:51.540
