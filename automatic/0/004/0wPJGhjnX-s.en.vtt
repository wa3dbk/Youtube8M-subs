peonies is actually give them support
we're<00:01:23.259> so<00:01:23.439> top-heavy<00:01:23.950> that<00:01:24.549> those<00:01:24.670> big<00:01:24.880> blooms

00:01:25.169 --> 00:01:25.179 
we're so top-heavy that those big blooms

00:01:25.179 --> 00:01:27.389 
we're so top-heavy that those big blooms
will<00:01:25.359> actually<00:01:25.689> make<00:01:25.869> them<00:01:25.990> fall<00:01:26.229> over<00:01:26.679> so<00:01:27.249> get

00:01:27.389 --> 00:01:27.399 
will actually make them fall over so get

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:30.600 
will actually make them fall over so get
put<00:01:27.639> a<00:01:27.670> peony<00:01:27.969> cage<00:01:28.359> around<00:01:28.539> it

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:30.610 
put a peony cage around it

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:33.730 
put a peony cage around it
put<00:01:31.610> it<00:01:31.730> down<00:01:31.760> around<00:01:32.060> the<00:01:32.390> plant<00:01:32.750> early

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:33.740 
put it down around the plant early

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:35.710 
put it down around the plant early
enough<00:01:33.980> in<00:01:34.160> the<00:01:34.280> spring<00:01:34.640> so<00:01:35.210> as<00:01:35.360> the<00:01:35.480> plant

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:35.720 
enough in the spring so as the plant

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:38.410 
enough in the spring so as the plant
grows<00:01:35.810> up<00:01:36.230> it'll<00:01:36.800> grow<00:01:37.010> through<00:01:37.430> it<00:01:37.670> if<00:01:38.300> you

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:38.420 
grows up it'll grow through it if you

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:41.380 
grows up it'll grow through it if you
try<00:01:38.630> to<00:01:38.690> put<00:01:38.990> a<00:01:39.020> big<00:01:39.260> peony<00:01:40.030> around<00:01:41.030> in<00:01:41.210> here

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:41.390 
try to put a big peony around in here

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:43.060 
try to put a big peony around in here
you<00:01:41.480> can<00:01:41.630> actually<00:01:41.810> damage<00:01:42.260> a<00:01:42.560> lot<00:01:42.710> of<00:01:42.770> the

you can actually damage a lot of the

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:46.030 
you can actually damage a lot of the
foliage<00:01:43.520> or<00:01:43.790> the<00:01:44.240> stalks<00:01:44.510> itself<00:01:45.140> so<00:01:45.740> let<00:01:45.920> the

foliage or the stalks itself so let the
plant<00:01:46.280> actually<00:01:46.430> naturally<00:01:47.210> grow<00:01:47.450> around<00:01:47.660> the

00:01:47.920 --> 00:01:47.930 
plant actually naturally grow around the

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:52.420
