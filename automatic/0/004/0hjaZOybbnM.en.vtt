in<00:00:47.520> the<00:00:47.610> main<00:00:47.789> tank<00:00:48.230> and<00:00:49.230> what<00:00:49.350> this

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530 
in the main tank and what this

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:51.709 
in the main tank and what this
encourages<00:00:50.160> is<00:00:50.399> next<00:00:50.789> time<00:00:50.969> she<00:00:51.180> holds<00:00:51.570> there

00:00:51.709 --> 00:00:51.719 
encourages is next time she holds there

00:02:04.789 --> 00:02:04.799 
chin and that's the color of the fry so

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:07.870 
chin and that's the color of the fry so

a chin will also change colour as well

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:12.350 
a chin will also change colour as well

so she should be spitting in the main

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.850 
so she should be spitting in the main
tank<00:02:12.660> probably<00:02:12.960> in<00:02:13.110> a<00:02:13.170> couple<00:02:13.320> of<00:02:13.440> days<00:02:13.620> and

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:13.860 
tank probably in a couple of days and

00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:15.940 
tank probably in a couple of days and
I'll<00:02:13.950> try<00:02:14.190> my<00:02:14.220> best<00:02:14.370> to<00:02:14.790> see<00:02:14.940> if<00:02:15.060> I<00:02:15.180> can<00:02:15.390> get<00:02:15.600> a

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 
I'll try my best to see if I can get a
