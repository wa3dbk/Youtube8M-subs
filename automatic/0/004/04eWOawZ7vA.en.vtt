we weren't combining food incorrectly we

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:28.190 
we weren't combining food incorrectly we
were<00:02:25.680> on<00:02:25.830> point<00:02:26.069> now<00:02:26.340> at<00:02:26.610> one<00:02:26.819> time<00:02:27.060> right<00:02:27.690> but

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:28.200 
were on point now at one time right but

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.140 
were on point now at one time right but
then<00:02:28.349> we<00:02:28.500> had<00:02:28.680> this<00:02:28.860> incursion<00:02:29.370> with<00:02:29.760> another

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:30.150 
then we had this incursion with another

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.930 
then we had this incursion with another
people's<00:02:30.599> diet<00:02:31.099> which<00:02:32.099> was<00:02:32.280> the<00:02:32.430> starch<00:02:32.730> and

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:32.940 
people's diet which was the starch and

00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:34.670 
people's diet which was the starch and
fats<00:02:33.209> in<00:02:33.420> a<00:02:33.480> diet<00:02:33.840> which<00:02:34.110> we<00:02:34.290> will<00:02:34.409> put<00:02:34.560> on

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:34.680 
fats in a diet which we will put on

00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.979 
fats in a diet which we will put on
doing<00:02:35.040> colonialism<00:02:35.790> and<00:02:35.909> slavery<00:02:36.209> and<00:02:36.599> that's

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:36.989 
doing colonialism and slavery and that's

00:02:36.989 --> 00:02:38.569 
doing colonialism and slavery and that's
when<00:02:37.260> everything<00:02:37.409> started<00:02:38.099> turning<00:02:38.459> around

00:02:38.569 --> 00:02:38.579 
when everything started turning around

00:02:38.579 --> 00:02:40.399 
when everything started turning around
that's<00:02:39.090> when<00:02:39.239> we<00:02:39.360> got<00:02:39.510> into<00:02:39.690> prolapsed<00:02:40.290> uterus

00:02:40.399 --> 00:02:40.409 
that's when we got into prolapsed uterus

00:02:40.409 --> 00:02:42.710 
that's when we got into prolapsed uterus
that's<00:02:41.010> what<00:02:41.220> we<00:02:41.310> got<00:02:41.489> into<00:02:41.730> fibroid<00:02:42.329> tumors

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
that's what we got into fibroid tumors

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.030 
that's what we got into fibroid tumors
that's<00:02:42.959> when<00:02:43.079> we<00:02:43.170> got<00:02:43.319> into<00:02:43.530> infertility

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:44.040 
that's when we got into infertility

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:47.960 
that's when we got into infertility
would<00:02:45.000> that<00:02:45.180> starts<00:02:45.629> in<00:02:45.840> a<00:02:45.870> diet<00:02:46.700> right<00:02:47.700> and

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:47.970 
would that starts in a diet right and

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:50.300 
would that starts in a diet right and
and<00:02:48.299> that<00:02:48.480> also<00:02:48.660> leads<00:02:49.049> me<00:02:49.319> to<00:02:49.349> this<00:02:49.650> part<00:02:49.980> too

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
and that also leads me to this part too

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:53.030 
and that also leads me to this part too
when<00:02:50.519> we<00:02:50.609> think<00:02:50.819> about<00:02:50.989> slavery<00:02:51.989> and<00:02:52.739> we<00:02:52.829> think

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:53.040 
when we think about slavery and we think

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:55.460 
when we think about slavery and we think
about<00:02:53.280> how<00:02:53.489> we<00:02:53.549> were<00:02:54.120> served<00:02:54.569> or<00:02:54.959> how<00:02:55.079> what<00:02:55.319> we

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:55.470 
about how we were served or how what we

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:58.069 
about how we were served or how what we
could<00:02:55.680> gather<00:02:55.829> were<00:02:56.220> the<00:02:56.400> leftovers<00:02:57.209> all<00:02:57.780> of

00:02:58.069 --> 00:02:58.079 
could gather were the leftovers all of

00:02:58.079 --> 00:03:00.259 
could gather were the leftovers all of
that<00:02:58.260> wasn't<00:02:58.680> bad<00:02:58.829> but<00:02:59.159> a<00:02:59.190> great<00:02:59.549> part<00:02:59.909> of<00:03:00.150> it

00:03:00.259 --> 00:03:00.269 
that wasn't bad but a great part of it

00:03:00.269 --> 00:03:01.699 
that wasn't bad but a great part of it
was<00:03:00.480> particularly<00:03:01.200> when<00:03:01.319> you<00:03:01.409> think<00:03:01.650> about

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
was particularly when you think about

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:04.130 
was particularly when you think about
certain<00:03:02.310> meats<00:03:02.609> can<00:03:02.909> you<00:03:03.060> explain<00:03:03.870> a<00:03:03.930> little

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:04.140 
certain meats can you explain a little

00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:05.420 
certain meats can you explain a little
bit<00:03:04.319> about<00:03:04.379> that<00:03:04.890> like<00:03:05.010> when<00:03:05.159> you<00:03:05.250> think<00:03:05.400> about

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:05.430 
bit about that like when you think about

00:03:05.430 --> 00:03:07.819 
bit about that like when you think about
things<00:03:05.849> like<00:03:05.970> chitterlings<00:03:06.690> and<00:03:07.109> and<00:03:07.530> and

00:03:07.819 --> 00:03:07.829 
things like chitterlings and and and

00:03:07.829 --> 00:03:10.640 
things like chitterlings and and and
other<00:03:08.129> body<00:03:08.879> parts<00:03:09.000> of<00:03:09.540> animals<00:03:10.019> that<00:03:10.200> we<00:03:10.409> ate

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:10.650 
other body parts of animals that we ate

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:12.080 
other body parts of animals that we ate
because<00:03:10.859> we<00:03:11.190> couldn't<00:03:11.459> get<00:03:11.609> into<00:03:11.760> the<00:03:11.909> big

00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:12.090 
because we couldn't get into the big

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:15.470 
because we couldn't get into the big
house<00:03:12.299> to<00:03:12.510> eat<00:03:12.629> other<00:03:12.810> foods<00:03:13.170> uh-huh<00:03:13.909> well<00:03:14.909> you

have to understand that people were just
