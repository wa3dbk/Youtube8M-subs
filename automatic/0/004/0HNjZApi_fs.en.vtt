Hercules<00:00:07.710> are<00:00:08.040> asked<00:00:08.880> of<00:00:09.090> a<00:00:09.240> placed<00:00:10.010> semi<00:00:11.010> near

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
Hercules are asked of a placed semi near

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.700 
Hercules are asked of a placed semi near
the<00:00:11.700> muscles<00:00:12.030> were<00:00:12.210> aiming<00:00:12.360> to<00:00:12.690> collect<00:00:13.080> we're

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:13.710 
the muscles were aiming to collect we're

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.099 
the muscles were aiming to collect we're
going<00:00:13.889> to<00:00:13.950> capture<00:00:14.280> some<00:00:14.700> of<00:00:14.790> the<00:00:15.109> seawater

00:00:16.099 --> 00:00:16.109 
going to capture some of the seawater

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:19.250 
going to capture some of the seawater
that's<00:00:16.680> near<00:00:17.220> those<00:00:17.460> animals<00:00:18.210> implicated<00:00:19.080> the

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260 
that's near those animals implicated the

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:20.529 
that's near those animals implicated the
bacteria

00:00:20.529 --> 00:00:20.539 
bacteria

00:00:20.539 --> 00:00:22.990 
bacteria
with<00:00:20.689> seawater<00:00:21.439> well<00:00:22.160> there<00:00:22.310> you<00:00:22.400> are<00:00:22.429> folks

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:23.000 
with seawater well there you are folks

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.419 
with seawater well there you are folks
that's<00:00:23.150> good<00:00:23.359> Reuben<00:00:23.689> okay<00:00:24.619> so<00:00:25.099> what<00:00:25.279> we're

00:00:25.419 --> 00:00:25.429 
that's good Reuben okay so what we're

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:27.669 
that's good Reuben okay so what we're
doing<00:00:25.460> with<00:00:25.789> that<00:00:26.149> pump<00:00:26.570> is<00:00:26.899> pumping<00:00:27.199> the

00:00:27.669 --> 00:00:27.679 
doing with that pump is pumping the

00:00:27.679 --> 00:00:31.540 
doing with that pump is pumping the
surrounding<00:00:28.399> seawater<00:00:28.699> and<00:00:29.679> looking<00:00:30.679> if<00:00:30.949> we

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:31.550 
surrounding seawater and looking if we

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:33.670 
surrounding seawater and looking if we
can<00:00:31.789> find<00:00:32.059> the<00:00:32.329> signals<00:00:32.809> that<00:00:32.989> are<00:00:33.110> in<00:00:33.500> the

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:33.680 
can find the signals that are in the

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:37.119 
can find the signals that are in the
muscles<00:00:34.160> in<00:00:34.519> the<00:00:34.579> surrounding<00:00:35.570> seawater<00:00:36.129> the

00:00:37.119 --> 00:00:37.129 
muscles in the surrounding seawater the

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:39.130 
muscles in the surrounding seawater the
question<00:00:37.640> we<00:00:37.790> want<00:00:37.940> to<00:00:38.149> know<00:00:38.269> is<00:00:38.600> do<00:00:38.930> the

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:39.140 
question we want to know is do the

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:41.049 
question we want to know is do the
muscles<00:00:39.530> take<00:00:39.860> up<00:00:40.070> their<00:00:40.309> symbionts

00:00:41.049 --> 00:00:41.059 
muscles take up their symbionts

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:44.020 
muscles take up their symbionts
from<00:00:41.269> the<00:00:41.420> surrounding<00:00:41.960> seawater<00:00:42.260> or<00:00:42.890> do<00:00:43.850> they

00:00:44.020 --> 00:00:44.030 
from the surrounding seawater or do they

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:45.759 
from the surrounding seawater or do they
take<00:00:44.300> them<00:00:44.479> up<00:00:44.600> from<00:00:44.839> the<00:00:44.930> muscles<00:00:45.379> to<00:00:45.739> the

00:00:45.759 --> 00:00:45.769 
take them up from the muscles to the

00:00:45.769 --> 00:00:48.430 
take them up from the muscles to the
right<00:00:46.010> and<00:00:46.250> left<00:00:46.430> of<00:00:46.640> them<00:00:46.760> I<00:00:47.000> got<00:00:47.690> some<00:00:47.960> looks

00:00:48.430 --> 00:00:48.440 
right and left of them I got some looks

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:50.290 
right and left of them I got some looks
like<00:00:48.620> a<00:00:48.649> little<00:00:48.860> in<00:00:49.070> entities<00:00:49.489> or<00:00:49.699> flytrap

00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:50.300 
like a little in entities or flytrap

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:52.679 
like a little in entities or flytrap
dust<00:00:50.570> mites<00:00:50.930> have<00:00:51.170> bunch<00:00:51.469> of<00:00:51.649> muscles<00:00:52.100> on

00:00:52.679 --> 00:00:52.689 
dust mites have bunch of muscles on

00:00:52.689 --> 00:00:55.590 
dust mites have bunch of muscles on
somebody<00:00:53.689> could<00:00:53.930> must<00:00:54.259> be<00:00:54.500> a<00:00:54.530> marker<00:00:55.009> that<00:00:55.040> was

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:55.600 
somebody could must be a marker that was

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:58.270 
somebody could must be a marker that was
that<00:00:56.600> was<00:00:56.780> dropped<00:00:57.019> in<00:00:57.350> it's<00:00:57.799> just<00:00:57.890> floating

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:20.330 
some of those with the mussels we're

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:24.010 
some of those with the mussels we're
going<00:01:20.450> to<00:01:20.540> get<00:01:20.600> slimed<00:01:21.020> on<00:01:21.380> the<00:01:21.500> service<00:01:23.020> funny

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.020 
going to get slimed on the service funny

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:25.390 
going to get slimed on the service funny
is<00:01:24.170> that<00:01:24.200> like<00:01:24.530> you're<00:01:24.710> going<00:01:24.979> in<00:01:25.100> the<00:01:25.190> water

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:25.400 
is that like you're going in the water

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:31.240 
is that like you're going in the water
but<00:01:26.030> you're<00:01:26.210> in<00:01:26.330> the<00:01:26.360> water<00:01:29.710> yes<00:01:30.710> I'm<00:01:30.979> at<00:01:31.220> the

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:31.250 
but you're in the water yes I'm at the

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:34.120 
but you're in the water yes I'm at the
Bryant<00:01:32.180> pool<00:01:32.420> is<00:01:32.780> three<00:01:33.259> to<00:01:33.410> five<00:01:33.590> times<00:01:33.890> more

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:34.130 
Bryant pool is three to five times more

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:36.550 
Bryant pool is three to five times more
saltier<00:01:35.060> I<00:01:35.300> believe<00:01:35.750> that<00:01:36.110> the<00:01:36.229> surrounding

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:36.560 
saltier I believe that the surrounding

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.609 
saltier I believe that the surrounding
ocean<00:01:37.160> water<00:01:37.790> and<00:01:38.720> because<00:01:39.380> of<00:01:39.410> the

00:01:39.609 --> 00:01:39.619 
ocean water and because of the

00:01:39.619 --> 00:01:41.290 
ocean water and because of the
difference<00:01:40.009> in<00:01:40.130> the<00:01:40.190> salinity<00:01:40.580> the<00:01:41.030> two

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:41.300 
difference in the salinity the two

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.330 
difference in the salinity the two
bodies<00:01:41.899> of<00:01:41.930> water<00:01:42.110> aren't<00:01:42.680> really<00:01:42.950> going<00:01:43.160> to

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:43.340 
bodies of water aren't really going to

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:45.160 
bodies of water aren't really going to
mix<00:01:43.610> you're<00:01:44.330> looking<00:01:44.600> right<00:01:44.750> through<00:01:45.050> the

00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:45.170 
mix you're looking right through the

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:49.150 
mix you're looking right through the
brine<00:01:46.509> absolutely<00:01:47.509> where<00:01:48.380> that<00:01:48.560> bright<00:01:48.860> brown

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:49.160 
brine absolutely where that bright brown

00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:55.109 
brine absolutely where that bright brown
stops<00:01:51.430> that<00:01:52.430> is<00:01:52.729> cool

00:01:55.109 --> 00:01:55.119 
stops that is cool

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:57.850 
stops that is cool
see<00:01:56.119> we<00:01:56.210> got<00:01:56.330> good<00:01:56.899> numbers<00:01:57.350> right<00:01:57.560> in<00:01:57.710> that

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:57.860 
see we got good numbers right in that

00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:01.990 
see we got good numbers right in that
area<00:01:57.920> right<00:01:58.280> there<00:02:00.369> making<00:02:01.369> waves<00:02:01.670> in<00:02:01.880> the

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:02.000 
area right there making waves in the

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.020 
area right there making waves in the
brunt<00:02:02.890> Brian<00:02:03.890> coming<00:02:04.250> up<00:02:04.340> yeah<00:02:04.520> that's<00:02:04.550> a<00:02:04.789> real

yeah<00:02:42.420> they<00:02:42.660> I<00:02:42.840> think<00:02:43.290> well<00:02:43.830> would<00:02:44.310> we<00:02:44.340> assume

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:45.230 
yeah they I think well would we assume

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:49.910 
yeah they I think well would we assume
we<00:02:46.230> could<00:02:46.440> zoom<00:02:46.470> in<00:02:46.830> and<00:02:47.580> see<00:02:48.020> look<00:02:49.020> at<00:02:49.110> that

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:49.920 
we could zoom in and see look at that

00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.880 
we could zoom in and see look at that
one<00:02:50.850> fish<00:02:51.090> looks<00:02:51.330> like<00:02:51.390> it's<00:02:51.630> been<00:02:51.780> brined<00:02:52.080> go

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
one fish looks like it's been brined go

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:57.170 
one fish looks like it's been brined go
into<00:02:53.130> the<00:02:53.220> rights<00:02:53.430> not<00:02:54.090> feeling<00:02:54.630> well<00:02:56.180> you

00:02:57.170 --> 00:02:57.180 
into the rights not feeling well you

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:59.060 
into the rights not feeling well you
want<00:02:57.900> to<00:02:58.019> zoom<00:02:58.140> in<00:02:58.320> right<00:02:58.470> over<00:02:58.530> the<00:02:58.830> front<00:02:58.950> of

00:02:59.060 --> 00:02:59.070 
want to zoom in right over the front of

00:02:59.070 --> 00:03:00.729 
want to zoom in right over the front of
the<00:02:59.160> basket<00:02:59.340> see<00:03:00.060> what<00:03:00.209> that<00:03:00.360> is

00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:00.739 
the basket see what that is

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:05.780 
the basket see what that is
sure<00:03:01.739> go<00:03:01.980> ahead<00:03:02.660> no<00:03:03.660> those<00:03:04.080> are<00:03:04.319> snails<00:03:04.760> okay

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:05.790 
sure go ahead no those are snails okay

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:08.930 
sure go ahead no those are snails okay
so<00:03:06.360> we'll<00:03:06.630> let<00:03:07.080> some<00:03:07.410> back<00:03:08.010> up<00:03:08.280> a<00:03:08.430> little<00:03:08.640> bit

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:08.940 
so we'll let some back up a little bit

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:11.030 
so we'll let some back up a little bit
and<00:03:09.180> look<00:03:09.540> and<00:03:09.870> then<00:03:10.140> we're<00:03:10.380> going<00:03:10.620> to<00:03:10.769> a

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:11.040 
and look and then we're going to a

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.640 
and look and then we're going to a
lateral<00:03:11.459> right<00:03:11.910> of<00:03:12.390> you<00:03:12.870> know<00:03:13.050> three<00:03:13.440> or<00:03:13.620> four

00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:13.650 
lateral right of you know three or four

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:16.070 
lateral right of you know three or four
meters<00:03:14.069> and<00:03:14.370> take<00:03:14.489> a<00:03:14.519> look<00:03:14.760> there<00:03:15.060> I<00:03:15.269> think<00:03:15.989> we

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:16.080 
meters and take a look there I think we

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:18.220 
meters and take a look there I think we
were<00:03:16.260> getting<00:03:16.830> into<00:03:17.100> some<00:03:17.340> better<00:03:17.550> territory

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:18.230 
were getting into some better territory

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:24.319 
were getting into some better territory
we've<00:03:19.230> gotten<00:03:19.620> out<00:03:19.739> of<00:03:19.769> it<00:03:19.980> now<00:03:23.120> so<00:03:24.120> we<00:03:24.209> got

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:24.329 
we've gotten out of it now so we got

00:03:24.329 --> 00:03:26.600 
we've gotten out of it now so we got
some<00:03:24.510> big<00:03:24.900> old<00:03:25.260> thumbs<00:03:25.650> tube<00:03:25.980> worms<00:03:26.250> here

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:26.610 
some big old thumbs tube worms here

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:29.180 
some big old thumbs tube worms here
Harry<00:03:27.269> each<00:03:27.720> of<00:03:27.989> those<00:03:28.110> have<00:03:28.440> thousands<00:03:29.100> of

Harry each of those have thousands of
individuals<00:03:29.790> and<00:03:30.060> that<00:03:30.360> are<00:03:30.840> hundreds<00:03:31.560> those

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:32.400 
individuals and that are hundreds those

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:35.840 
individuals and that are hundreds those
are<00:03:32.640> two<00:03:32.820> worms<00:03:33.150> five<00:03:34.310> hundreds<00:03:35.310> of<00:03:35.430> years<00:03:35.549> old

00:03:37.699 --> 00:03:37.709 
some of those do you think those are

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:39.500 
some of those do you think those are
little<00:03:37.890> bits<00:03:38.549> that<00:03:38.670> have<00:03:38.760> been<00:03:38.910> bitten<00:03:39.180> out<00:03:39.329> of

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510 
little bits that have been bitten out of

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:42.470 
little bits that have been bitten out of
it<00:03:39.600> by<00:03:40.260> predators<00:03:40.950> see<00:03:41.610> there's<00:03:42.030> a<00:03:42.090> lot<00:03:42.299> of

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
it by predators see there's a lot of

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.509 
it by predators see there's a lot of
guys<00:03:42.630> that<00:03:42.870> come<00:03:43.049> and<00:03:43.260> snip<00:03:43.560> it<00:03:43.739> and<00:03:43.860> that's

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:44.519 
guys that come and snip it and that's

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:48.650 
guys that come and snip it and that's
why<00:03:44.700> it<00:03:44.760> goes<00:03:44.940> back<00:03:45.150> inside<00:03:45.480> is<00:03:45.690> -<00:03:47.239> if<00:03:48.239> you<00:03:48.450> pull

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:48.660 
why it goes back inside is - if you pull

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:50.960 
why it goes back inside is - if you pull
it<00:03:48.690> out<00:03:48.930> of<00:03:48.989> the<00:03:49.290> alarm<00:03:49.530> it'd<00:03:50.250> be<00:03:50.430> a<00:03:50.459> long<00:03:50.640> thing
