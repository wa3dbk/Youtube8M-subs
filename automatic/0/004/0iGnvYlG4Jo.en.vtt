00:03:15.010 --> 00:03:17.789 
that's amazing and this right here is
CCAP<00:03:15.489> last<00:03:15.700> um<00:03:16.000> this<00:03:16.750> was<00:03:17.290> recommended<00:03:17.769> by

00:03:17.789 --> 00:03:17.799

CCAP last um this was recommended by
lisa<00:03:18.130> eldridge<00:03:18.459> and<00:03:18.760> of<00:03:18.910> course<00:03:19.090> i<00:03:19.180> had<00:03:19.299> to<00:03:19.390> get

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:19.540 
lisa eldridge and of course i had to get

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:22.280 
lisa eldridge and of course i had to get
it<00:03:19.660> it's<00:03:19.840> actually<00:03:20.260> uh<00:03:20.620> I<00:03:21.130> think<00:03:21.459> like<00:03:21.640> a<00:03:21.730> post

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:22.290 
it it's actually uh I think like a post

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:27.120 
it it's actually uh I think like a post
treatment<00:03:24.090> gel<00:03:25.090> it's<00:03:25.570> really<00:03:26.350> silicone<00:03:27.010> he

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:27.130 
treatment gel it's really silicone he

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:29.670 
treatment gel it's really silicone he
actually<00:03:27.250> feels<00:03:27.579> like<00:03:27.790> it<00:03:28.359> is<00:03:28.420> the<00:03:29.109> epidermal

00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:29.680 
actually feels like it is the epidermal

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.259 
actually feels like it is the epidermal
recovery<00:03:30.100> accelerator<00:03:30.579> so<00:03:30.700> I<00:03:30.730> think<00:03:30.850> it's<00:03:31.120> for

00:03:31.259 --> 00:03:31.269 
recovery accelerator so I think it's for

00:03:31.269 --> 00:03:32.580 
recovery accelerator so I think it's for
people<00:03:31.420> who<00:03:31.600> have<00:03:31.840> like<00:03:31.989> chemical<00:03:32.380> peels

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590 
people who have like chemical peels

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:34.110 
people who have like chemical peels
whatnot<00:03:32.950> but<00:03:33.340> I've<00:03:33.489> actually<00:03:33.519> been<00:03:33.790> using

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.120 
whatnot but I've actually been using

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:35.490 
whatnot but I've actually been using
that<00:03:34.239> as<00:03:34.359> my<00:03:34.390> daytime<00:03:34.780> moisturizer<00:03:35.049> and<00:03:35.440> I

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:35.500 
that as my daytime moisturizer and I

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:36.930 
that as my daytime moisturizer and I
really<00:03:35.799> like<00:03:35.980> it<00:03:36.130> because<00:03:36.190> it<00:03:36.400> soaks<00:03:36.609> right<00:03:36.730> in

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:36.940 
really like it because it soaks right in

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:38.789 
really like it because it soaks right in
and<00:03:37.150> doesn't<00:03:37.329> leave<00:03:37.690> me<00:03:37.959> shiny<00:03:38.290> or<00:03:38.470> anything

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.759 
bit sticky so I try not use every day
but<00:03:48.489> I<00:03:48.910> don't<00:03:49.870> I<00:03:50.019> can't<00:03:50.049> really<00:03:50.320> say<00:03:50.560> how<00:03:50.709> the

00:03:50.759 --> 00:03:50.769 
but I don't I can't really say how the

00:03:50.769 --> 00:03:53.180 
but I don't I can't really say how the
results<00:03:51.400> are<00:03:51.519> just<00:03:51.670> because<00:03:51.910> I'm<00:03:52.420> 22<00:03:52.900> and<00:03:52.930> I

00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:53.190 
results are just because I'm 22 and I

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:55.949 
results are just because I'm 22 and I
don't<00:03:54.190> it's<00:03:54.790> mostly<00:03:55.150> preventative<00:03:55.750> so<00:03:55.900> I

00:03:55.949 --> 00:03:55.959 
don't it's mostly preventative so I

00:03:55.959 --> 00:03:57.270 
don't it's mostly preventative so I
guess<00:03:56.170> I'll<00:03:56.530> never<00:03:56.560> know<00:03:56.799> if<00:03:56.950> it<00:03:57.040> worked<00:03:57.190> or

00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:57.280
