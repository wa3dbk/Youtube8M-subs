00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:17.330 
feature I have no idea what that's for
but<00:01:15.990> let's<00:01:16.470> think<00:01:16.530> they<00:01:16.710> were<00:01:16.770> thinking<00:01:16.950> of<00:01:17.220> it

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:17.340 
but let's think they were thinking of it

00:01:17.340 --> 00:01:19.429 
but let's think they were thinking of it
so<00:01:17.580> they<00:01:18.240> put<00:01:18.420> some<00:01:18.540> effort<00:01:18.659> into<00:01:18.900> this<00:01:19.049> jacket

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
so they put some effort into this jacket

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:20.960 
so they put some effort into this jacket
like<00:01:19.770> I<00:01:19.799> mountain<00:01:20.159> hardwear<00:01:20.460> jackets<00:01:20.880> it
