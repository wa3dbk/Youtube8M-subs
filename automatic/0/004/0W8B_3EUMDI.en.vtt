Pacquiao is done in the welterweight
division<00:02:44.750> so<00:02:45.590> top-ranked<00:02:46.300> appears<00:02:47.300> to<00:02:47.570> be

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:48.340 
division so top-ranked appears to be

division so top-ranked appears to be
sinking<00:02:49.340> you<00:02:49.850> know<00:02:49.970> well<00:02:50.180> HBO<00:02:50.660> will<00:02:51.020> the<00:02:51.800> only

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
sinking you know well HBO will the only

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:54.580 
sinking you know well HBO will the only
benefit<00:02:52.430> is<00:02:52.580> they<00:02:53.180> have<00:02:53.390> HBO's<00:02:53.930> full<00:02:54.320> backing

00:02:54.580 --> 00:02:54.590 
benefit is they have HBO's full backing

00:02:54.590 --> 00:02:57.610 
benefit is they have HBO's full backing
now<00:02:54.980> because<00:02:55.940> golden<00:02:56.330> boy<00:02:56.480> has<00:02:56.930> jump<00:02:57.350> ship

00:02:57.610 --> 00:02:57.620 
now because golden boy has jump ship

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:01.240 
now because golden boy has jump ship
right<00:02:58.870> they've<00:02:59.870> jumped<00:03:00.290> shut<00:03:00.590> the<00:03:00.740> show<00:03:00.950> time

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:01.250 
right they've jumped shut the show time

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:06.699 
right they've jumped shut the show time
and<00:03:01.690> it's<00:03:02.690> very<00:03:03.910> smart<00:03:04.910> that<00:03:05.540> HBO<00:03:06.050> walked<00:03:06.440> in

00:03:06.699 --> 00:03:06.709 
and it's very smart that HBO walked in

00:03:06.709 --> 00:03:09.610 
and it's very smart that HBO walked in
adrien<00:03:07.220> broner<00:03:07.490> while<00:03:08.390> they<00:03:08.660> could<00:03:09.020> they

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:09.620 
adrien broner while they could they

00:03:09.620 --> 00:03:12.280 
adrien broner while they could they
locked<00:03:09.950> Adrien<00:03:10.610> Broner<00:03:10.880> into<00:03:11.270> a<00:03:11.300> massive<00:03:12.050> deal

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:12.290 
locked Adrien Broner into a massive deal

00:03:12.290 --> 00:03:15.910 
locked Adrien Broner into a massive deal
that<00:03:13.250> will<00:03:14.209> keep<00:03:14.510> him<00:03:14.570> on<00:03:14.870> HBO<00:03:15.320> for<00:03:15.650> a<00:03:15.709> very

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:15.920 
that will keep him on HBO for a very

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:17.920 
that will keep him on HBO for a very
long<00:03:16.160> time<00:03:16.390> because<00:03:17.390> that's<00:03:17.780> really

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:17.930 
long time because that's really

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:20.470 
long time because that's really
literally<00:03:18.380> the<00:03:18.590> next<00:03:18.739> best<00:03:19.040> guy<00:03:19.310> and<00:03:19.580> they're

has six fights in the contract uh I
can't<00:04:33.670> even<00:04:33.910> think<00:04:34.150> of<00:04:34.330> six<00:04:34.630> fighters<00:04:35.550> that

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:36.550 
can't even think of six fighters that

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:38.460 
can't even think of six fighters that
are<00:04:36.610> worthy<00:04:37.240> of<00:04:37.450> fighting<00:04:37.900> mayweather<00:04:38.080> at

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:38.470 
are worthy of fighting mayweather at

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:40.530 
are worthy of fighting mayweather at
this<00:04:38.620> point<00:04:38.920> even<00:04:39.520> on<00:04:39.790> the<00:04:39.940> come-up<00:04:40.180> like

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:40.540 
this point even on the come-up like

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:45.240 
this point even on the come-up like
who's<00:04:40.750> there<00:04:41.730> Guerrero<00:04:43.380> perhaps<00:04:44.380> a<00:04:44.590> Martinez

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:45.250 
who's there Guerrero perhaps a Martinez

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:51.090 
who's there Guerrero perhaps a Martinez
if<00:04:45.550> he's<00:04:46.420> not<00:04:46.450> locked<00:04:46.870> up<00:04:47.080> with<00:04:47.260> HBO<00:04:47.680> I<00:04:50.100> when

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:51.100 
if he's not locked up with HBO I when

00:04:51.100 --> 00:04:53.310 
if he's not locked up with HBO I when
Timothy<00:04:51.370> Bradley<00:04:51.820> perhaps<00:04:52.660> Timothy<00:04:53.140> Bradley

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:53.320 
Timothy Bradley perhaps Timothy Bradley

00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:58.970 
Timothy Bradley perhaps Timothy Bradley
when<00:04:53.740> he<00:04:53.830> leaves<00:04:54.070> top-ranked<00:04:55.230> 30<00:04:56.610> golden<00:04:57.610> boys

00:04:58.970 --> 00:04:58.980 
when he leaves top-ranked 30 golden boys

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:00.780 
when he leaves top-ranked 30 golden boys
golden<00:04:59.980> boy<00:05:00.130> doesn't<00:05:00.430> have<00:05:00.550> too<00:05:00.760> many

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:00.790 
golden boy doesn't have too many

00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:03.690 
golden boy doesn't have too many
welterweights<00:05:01.510> now<00:05:01.810> so<00:05:02.740> it's<00:05:02.980> really<00:05:03.100> hard<00:05:03.520> to

00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:03.700 
welterweights now so it's really hard to

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:06.360 
welterweights now so it's really hard to
see<00:05:03.880> Mayweather<00:05:04.540> fighting<00:05:05.230> six<00:05:05.590> times<00:05:05.890> and

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:06.370 
see Mayweather fighting six times and

00:05:06.370 --> 00:05:08.130 
see Mayweather fighting six times and
not<00:05:07.060> moving<00:05:07.300> up<00:05:07.570> to<00:05:07.690> the<00:05:07.720> middleweight
