 this we include antutu benchmark 

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:34.050
 the result is about 15,000 im home it 

00:00:31.769 --> 00:00:38.010
 because he has a turbo processor bath 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:41.190
 with a frequency of 1500 megahertz 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:47.989
 very interesting to compare with you this one 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:50.610
 smartphone with this iphone here found 

00:00:47.989 --> 00:00:52.829
 An article in which all these parameters and 

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:56.239
 smartphone listed meaning 

00:00:52.829 --> 00:00:59.010
 Fifth iPhone Well, the article is called

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:02.850
 customized best smartphone of summer recognized 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:06.600
 iphone 5 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:09.350
 Well, you see here are such photos 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:12.360
 happy people are placed with iphone 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:16.680
 let's look at this happiness and 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:18.920
 compare it in detail with the smartphone zp980 

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:22.590
 2 to 32 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:23.310
 so start ios operating systems 

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:28.670
 vs 

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:31.560
 android well there is no point in comparing 

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:34.829
 in ios operating system as it is known 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:38.729
 even widgets so no processor in this 

00:01:34.829 --> 00:01:40.799
 on 5 apple a6 1200 megahertz there 

00:01:38.729 --> 00:01:46.610
 dual-core processor and something on it 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:50.360
 for 1200, respectively, we have 4 cores and 

00:01:46.610 --> 00:01:53.340
 500 million megahertz is twice as good 

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:58.939
 so one memory iPhone 

00:01:53.340 --> 00:02:03.420
 gigabytes we look at our memory 

00:01:58.939 --> 00:02:06.580
 here it is ozu available 1600 

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:09.610
 1968 megabytes that is two gigabytes 

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:14.110
 RAM is twice as much 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:16.690
 flash iphone of 32 and here 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:22.090
 flash memory is also 30 from free 

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:27.040
 left after the system 27 gigabytes here 

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:30.450
 iphone equality screen 4 inches here y 

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.450
 we are five inches 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:38.160
 so we go further on chambers 

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:48.930
 so on cameras so cameras iphone 8 we 

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:53.310
 12 6 see this here new main and 

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:55.170
 frontal iphone 13 here write 8 but 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:58.050
 quite possibly this approximation 5 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:03:01.890
 megapixels guaranteed that is 

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:06.180
 here we also overtook two to three times 

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:09.300
 so iphone battery thousand 400 milliamp 

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:14.720
 hours only 5 iphone 

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:18.420
 yes here we have a battery for 2000 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:21.180
 milliamper hours smartphone more and 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:26.190
 more battery here it is 

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:29.180
 battery so give a voiced price tag 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:32.340
 iPhone 5 27 thousand rubles 

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:33.600
 our smartphone is twice cheaper 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:37.410
 despite the fact that all of him 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:40.130
 performance is twice as good thanks 

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:40.130
 for your attention
