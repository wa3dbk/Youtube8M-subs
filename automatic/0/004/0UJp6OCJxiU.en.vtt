00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.440
 recently our team showed the 

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:07.080
 work of a family here in the interior 

00:00:04.440 --> 00:00:09.240
 of pellets that grow strawberry 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:11.610
 and in the municipality of turúçú we 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:14.460
 we were on a field day that shows 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:18.680
 other form of early cultivation of this 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:18.680
 fruit growing outside the soil 

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:33.410
 the national capital of red pepper 

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:35.450
 are the few sweetening their production 

00:00:33.410 --> 00:00:40.660
 are 11 hectares of strawberry planting 

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:44.000
 with more than 400 thousand feet of fruit 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:46.790
 turuçú wanted to diversify the production 

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:51.379
 was based on the pepper give more option 

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:53.239
 to consumers and also to producers 

00:00:51.379 --> 00:00:56.059
 the strawberry was chosen to work 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:57.050
 in parallel with the pepper and to help 

00:00:56.059 --> 00:00:59.629
 in production 

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:02.360
 turuçú prefecture created a law of 

00:00:59.629 --> 00:01:04.699
 strawberry incentive not this law to 

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:08.270
 created in 2010 that the hangu promoter 

00:01:04.699 --> 00:01:12.080
 a 100% purchase incentive law 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:15.350
 of the change in the year and they pay us 80% 

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:19.000
 the following year with 20 per cent 

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:21.560
 subsidy from the city hall 

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:25.010
 together with the growth in production of 

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:27.740
 strawberry came the technology a novelty 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:30.850
 in cultivating the planting off the ground 

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:33.800
 also called systems and microphone 

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:35.450
 which the technique is being developed in 

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:40.460
 a partnership with embrapa clima 

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:43.220
 to help producers 

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:46.280
 The great advantage of this system is that 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:48.850
 producer using appropriate varieties 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.990
 for the system it can produce 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:53.780
 outside the normal season of the season 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:56.300
 which normally starts 

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:58.750
 end of spring of our region and he 

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:01.670
 with this system can produce a 

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:03.050
 period advancing in the months of January 

00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:05.750
 February March 

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:09.440
 the implementation of this system has high 

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:12.230
 investment cost is worth the 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:15.379
 strawberry on changes out of the soil produces 

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:18.230
 whole year or quality fruit 

00:02:15.379 --> 00:02:21.860
 In addition, the use of agrochemicals is 

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:24.140
 reduced when you bring a strawberry to 

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:25.970
 off the ground the need to have a 

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:27.709
 support for the plant 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:30.379
 in this specific case it is used 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:32.470
 basically a mixture of bark of 

00:02:30.379 --> 00:02:35.510
 charcoal rice with organic matter 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:37.550
 strawberry is one of the species that have 

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:40.160
 pest sensitivity 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:43.280
 deployed outside the ground, the risk 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:46.180
 the substrate protects the foot that can last 

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:46.180
 up to three years 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:53.550
 to perform the strawberry technique outside 

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:55.500
 of the soil and also the work of 

00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:58.470
 producers in the municipality of tururu south 

00:02:55.500 --> 00:03:02.280
 a field day was held 

00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:05.130
 more than 170 people attended the 

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:07.530
 opening was in the city gymnasium and soon 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:10.410
 then the participants went in two 

00:03:07.530 --> 00:03:14.300
 properties to accompany in practice the 

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:14.300
 strawberry production off the ground 

00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:22.620
 our team accompanied the group in 

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:25.320
 property of his family who 

00:03:22.620 --> 00:03:27.960
 implemented this year the cultivation of strawberry 

00:03:25.320 --> 00:03:30.240
 off the ground already accustomed to 

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:32.460
 traditional production of the fruit they 

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:36.440
 presented the differences between the two 

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:44.460
 types of crop in this crop of 2013 

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:47.820
 have less than half of October 

00:03:44.460 --> 00:03:50.220
 until now four pesticide application 

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:54.750
 the other conventional professional already 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:57.060
 we did is done weekly were 

00:03:54.750 --> 00:04:00.450
 Two thousand seedlings planted at the end of May 

00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:03.020
 in two months they produced 300 kilos 

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:03.020
 Of Strawberry 

00:04:09.310 --> 00:04:13.480
 to learn new techniques and acquire 

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:15.730
 knowledge 

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:19.269
 a group moved from porto vera cruz 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:21.940
 until turuçú to participate in that day of 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:23.410
 field both fetch the information from the 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:25.780
 best possible 

00:04:23.410 --> 00:04:29.490
 We're starting too. 

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:31.960
 first year of existence the single group 

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:34.650
 andré gossain information to the 

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:34.650
 get better 

00:04:40.490 --> 00:04:46.380
 Mars is only 22 years was 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:48.750
 responsible for the implementation of the 

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:49.770
 off the ground on his property. 

00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:52.470
 family 

00:04:49.770 --> 00:04:54.920
 care with the whole plantation and made 

00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:54.920
 by him 

00:04:55.500 --> 00:05:02.100
 the young producer who served as an example 

00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:05.130
 as many people as producers 

00:05:02.100 --> 00:05:07.850
 group of porto vera cruz and residents of 

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:11.000
 everything south and of many other cities 

00:05:07.850 --> 00:05:13.920
 spoke of his experience and his 

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.660
 expects an installation of the cultivation of 

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:19.130
 strawberries off the ground 

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:21.990
 the expectation is to achieve 

00:05:19.130 --> 00:05:26.100
 the same amount to the other solanum 

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:29.490
 is achieving the quantity 

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:31.320
 produced at the time out to have a good 

00:05:29.490 --> 00:05:34.170
 profit 

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:36.540
 the other now at peak production will go 

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:39.140
 have to sell it all at a price well 

00:05:36.540 --> 00:05:39.140
 reduced
