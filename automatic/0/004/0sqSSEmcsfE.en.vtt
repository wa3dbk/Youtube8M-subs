00:00:01.399 --> 00:00:04.399
 more accurate 

00:00:10.689 --> 00:00:12.279
 the day after the 7 

00:00:12.279 --> 00:00:15.669
 Klaus Allofs Managing Director Sporting Director of Werder Bremen 

00:00:15.669 --> 00:00:18.599
 but after a talk show in the Autostadt Wolfsburg 

00:00:18.599 --> 00:00:21.230
 because together with 

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:22.730
 the combination of 

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:26.960
 For over eleven years way as with coach Schaaf the success duo of the league 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:31.860
 only in the afternoon not really the round was totally messed up so 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:34.720
 Bad was just in his term 

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:37.720
 his wife Catherine have to deliver Guttenberg 

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:41.440
 on the part of the simultaneous runners 

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:46.290
 I can say that quite open otherwise I will not find it difficult Vale 

00:00:46.829 --> 00:00:49.500
 that also belongs to you never 

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.270
 at both times in which it runs well to Werder Bremen than today 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:55.930
 but of course in times that you are not so good 

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:59.600
 and Zurich wife there is also always clarification the company can sometimes 

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:02.200
 Admit that things do not work that way, you might as well 

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.490
 maybe wrong in his decision or so for me personally 

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.210
 it does not matter 

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:10.830
 but after the game against Hoffenheim must be small-small from the heart 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.700
 Of course, forrester wave tri points had more in the account 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:17.840
 and because it also makes the work easier 

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:21.770
 Of course, having a sense of achievement can be a lot better life especially if 

00:01:21.770 --> 00:01:23.450
 you had half a year behind you 

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:28.210
 Memleben many things have been questioned and before then also players 

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:29.350
 but also percent 

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:31.560
 almost the whole environment so a little doubt 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:32.990
 to do that 

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:37.040
 Such Thater, of course, very good and especially if they are so then 

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:37.920
 come 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:40.900
 in the 7 8 6 minute then take the equalizer and then in injury time 

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:45.490
 because you did not give up because you're on the color act then that 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:48.470
 To score the goal of course that was kind of 

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:51.950
 Percent dramaturgy ago that was of course something special and 

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:55.729
 Percent year has ensured many reliefs throughout the environment 

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.030
 then they have a star slightly different than about cheering as guest 

00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:01.300
 his 

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:05.280
 Bitburg issue little opportunity that must say but because what say something 

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:08.990
 One of the best team numbers has its products learn the team one 

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:11.990
 Scooters Â«They see the biggest problems also say it's the defense 

00:02:13.659 --> 00:02:14.630
 an important role 

00:02:14.630 --> 00:02:17.600
 should Pizarro have missed us in the front area more splendid modern 

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.799
 Breakthrough power lost in midfield, we also had back 

00:02:20.799 --> 00:02:24.370
 by the fact that Mehsud just could not be implemented that way but 

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:27.459
 the problems but also in the defensive area what so that just by 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:29.759
 the little bit except from Naldo again 

00:02:29.759 --> 00:02:32.239
 that's hacked there too 

00:02:32.239 --> 00:02:35.840
 at 9 o'clock already since then in all parts of the team Las are then 

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:38.819
 The results are not such a big surprise 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:43.289
 No Master Team out what was missing the mission message Laufbereitschaft 

00:02:43.289 --> 00:02:44.290
 So he has super 

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:48.269
 Hints from the back saw Rheinhessen had my Klatt and that there 

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:52.370
 not everything so completely "The will of the citizens would become complaints 

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:54.429
 minimal things the 

00:02:54.429 --> 00:02:57.859
 for him that was ten songs that's maybe one or two percent 

00:02:58.979 --> 00:03:03.339
 because you are less new or or less than in use 

00:03:03.339 --> 00:03:05.680
 Normally, or maybe as the competition and 

00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.709
 that is sometimes not so perceive "was 

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:11.009
 and for luck that has become like a thread through our games 

00:03:11.009 --> 00:03:13.670
 Life does not pull that unconditional will 

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:15.219
 showed me this 

00:03:15.219 --> 00:03:19.299
 Percent that willingness to go to the limit forever and percent 

00:03:19.299 --> 00:03:20.759
 Percent at all 

00:03:20.759 --> 00:03:23.459
 Class that now shows a team like Dortmund for example 

00:03:23.459 --> 00:03:27.209
 first and foremost, they come from their irrepressible commitment that everyone for the 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:31.239
 There is another and that has been missing in many games and is falling right now 

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:36.189
 the example percent against Hoffmann shows how important that is to succeed 

00:03:36.189 --> 00:03:39.409
 That is the basis that is the basis for playing good football 

00:03:39.409 --> 00:03:39.959
 can 

00:03:39.959 --> 00:03:41.750
 the Dyson Ball and then 

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:45.019
 one looks at the other a new tool striking at the end 

00:03:45.019 --> 00:03:46.469
 Helau maybe both 

00:03:46.469 --> 00:03:49.640
 Dell or Euro or no one is running 

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:53.230
 Son and in the Eifel it is so that you are not in the beginning but that both 

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:54.359
 Devices are running 

00:03:54.359 --> 00:03:56.750
 it's these small differences that are easy then 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:58.110
 Import percent 

00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:01.930
 keep on running and then percent too soon lead to that one 

00:04:02.719 --> 00:04:06.469
 The herd from the back leads, too, can combine great for year as well 

00:04:06.469 --> 00:04:10.090
 Unity represents that it was still possible to better compensate customers 

00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:14.959
 it was the fact that we should do it for Hertha should be a joke 

00:04:14.959 --> 00:04:17.169
 the potential in this team is 

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:18.009
 the 4th 

00:04:18.009 --> 00:04:21.479
 convinced that the players too 

00:04:21.479 --> 00:04:25.210
 wanting to accomplish these things that she may well be on that herself 

00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:29.039
 not so realized in the past that are this percent 

00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:30.439
 this learning phase 

00:04:30.439 --> 00:04:32.830
 who have now understood it 

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:36.030
 Sound then but also the hope that we hurt less 

00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:38.569
 Finn should have it all together then they would be 

00:04:38.569 --> 00:04:42.349
 Successful games that is not a question because then we just put this class in ours 

00:04:42.349 --> 00:04:45.349
 Have team he already started on 1 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:48.039
 yes this is not that hard anymore 

00:04:48.039 --> 00:04:49.630
 that will probably be the euro 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:52.060
 9 90 commander water raises to be great Dortmund
