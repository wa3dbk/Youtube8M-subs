00:00:05.599 --> 00:00:05.609 
make some sleeves false sleeves because

00:00:05.609 --> 00:00:08.540 
make some sleeves false sleeves because

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:10.400 
my own slaves are always so ruined so I
thought<00:00:08.910> what<00:00:09.120> I<00:00:09.179> would<00:00:09.240> do<00:00:09.570> is<00:00:09.780> look<00:00:09.960> for<00:00:10.019> some

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:10.410 
thought what I would do is look for some

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:14.150 
thought what I would do is look for some
nice<00:00:10.620> sleeves<00:00:12.290> that<00:00:13.290> would<00:00:13.469> go<00:00:13.620> with<00:00:13.799> things<00:00:14.009> I

00:00:14.150 --> 00:00:14.160 
nice sleeves that would go with things I
