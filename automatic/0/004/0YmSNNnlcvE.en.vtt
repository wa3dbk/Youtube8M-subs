00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:18.480
 welcome to automoto tip like 

00:00:16.109 --> 00:00:21.210
 it's in the fabulous landscapes of the north 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:24.210
 west of norway on the road that 

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:26.039
 along the ocean that bentley presents us 

00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.929
 its new continental gt 

00:00:26.039 --> 00:00:29.640
 when we say new it's actually 

00:00:27.929 --> 00:00:31.890
 simply a restyling with new 

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:33.329
 new front face that 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.600
 gives us a little more sitting on the 

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:36.930
 road 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:39.570
 this model retains a totally design 

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.100
 timeless that is made to last well 

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.460
 obviously it's a model that has been 

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:46.380
 launched in 2003 on the basis of France 

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:49.410
 going gun fight years so we 

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:52.080
 always the choice between the fabulous w12 

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:55.890
 6 liters with for main 

00:00:52.080 --> 00:00:58.770
 mechanical evolutions a passage of 575 

00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:01.410
 horses at 5,190 horses and small 

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:03.300
 evolutions a decline in consumption of 

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.939
 5% purely symbolic 

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.750
 thanks to the cutting of six of the twelve 

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:08.970
 cylinder 

00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.450
 we will now see what that 

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.450
 give driving 

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:27.630
 versatility that's really what 

00:01:25.620 --> 00:01:30.990
 most characterizes this bentley 

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:32.300
 continental gt and gtc to know that it's 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.340
 a car that knows how to do everything 

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:37.410
 we can imagine a rich owner 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.840
 who had all the cars the most 

00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:42.330
 fabulous creation that after having 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:44.960
 everything tried will largely be content with 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:47.040
 the continental is a four places 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:51.420
 comfortable as it should be 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:54.480
 any bentley extremely powerful and 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:55.560
 great on the road as far as 

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:57.060
 of course she is a 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:00.300
 4 wheel drive transmission 

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:02.190
 permanent a car that knows everything 

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:03.360
 to do that is delicious to drive in 

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:05.100
 shouting as we do in this 

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.170
 moment but who is quite capable 

00:02:05.100 --> 00:02:08.570
 to hold the dragee high to some 

00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:11.820
 much more sporty models 

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:13.830
 thanks to its transmission and its 

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:16.020
 outstanding performance when we 

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:18.240
 knows its weight over two tons 3 

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.709
 these are the limits of the car 

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.990
 she's obviously not as old a 

00:02:19.709 --> 00:02:25.130
 little sportswoman and that's absolutely everything 

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:27.320
 do and always in the distinction 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:29.790
 typical non british 

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:31.320
 needless to say, comfort is in 

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:34.019
 relationship with the standing of the car 

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:35.630
 controlled suspension with 4 modes of the most 

00:02:34.019 --> 00:02:38.459
 comfortable to the firmest 

00:02:35.630 --> 00:02:40.260
 the finish is obviously and 

00:02:38.459 --> 00:02:40.530
 luckily I was going to say at this level 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:43.290
 of price 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:45.480
 irreproachable with the highest leather 

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:48.000
 of the current automotive market 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.630
 woodwork that can be as 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.660
 replaced by two 

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:56.460
 of the rattle's aluminum a real 

00:02:52.660 --> 00:02:56.460
 gt as we dream
