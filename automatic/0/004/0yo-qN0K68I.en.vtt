00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
or climate change is the cause so what's

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.840 
or climate change is the cause so what's
the<00:02:15.930> verdict<00:02:16.320> it's<00:02:16.980> not<00:02:17.280> necessary<00:02:17.700> the

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:17.850 
the verdict it's not necessary the

the verdict it's not necessary the
warming<00:02:18.330> of<00:02:18.450> the<00:02:18.480> ocean<00:02:18.870> it's<00:02:19.019> the<00:02:19.200> pattern<00:02:19.530> of

warming of the ocean it's the pattern of

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.790 
warming of the ocean it's the pattern of
