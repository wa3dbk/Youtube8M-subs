00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:15.570
 my name is guilda i am 22 years old 

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:18.869
 I was born in Naples and I am a girl 

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:22.020
 introverted and silent I love art 

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:23.580
 as a maximum expression through it 

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:24.630
 I can express my world 

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:27.720
 inner 

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:30.480
 I believe that an image succeeds in 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:34.559
 express much more than they can 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:36.900
 the words through the details yes 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:38.790
 communicates the truth of things are 

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:40.410
 practically raised in the atelier of 

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:43.020
 my mother with 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:45.840
 do not open her uncle a painter aunt 

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:48.870
 therefore sculptor had always been 

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:51.120
 stimulated creatively and it was almost 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:54.030
 natural that I should undertake this 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:56.309
 kind of street even though I have to admit 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:58.559
 that life by creative dwarfs is easy 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.519
 from small safe with my mother during 

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:04.040
 the week of 

00:01:00.519 --> 00:01:06.560
 I remember one afternoon in the afternoons 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.990
 in which he passes here and there a group of 

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:11.810
 aluminum guys get out 

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:13.840
 from the institute I remember having suffered 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:17.479
 understood that this was my place e 

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:19.940
 had transmitted a lot of energy into 

00:01:17.479 --> 00:01:23.090
 truth I have a lot of difficulty with everything 

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:26.299
 what the mac discipline I do with 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:27.799
 the pindarici between projects and others 

00:01:26.299 --> 00:01:31.159
 It was very difficult for me and 

00:01:27.799 --> 00:01:33.319
 get used to the exams marangoni method 

00:01:31.159 --> 00:01:36.800
 the deadlines of the 

00:01:33.319 --> 00:01:37.310
 deliveries, however, and want to be able then there 

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:39.860
 succeeds 

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:42.229
 all the marangoni students remember 

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:44.600
 of institute for the sleepless nights 

00:01:42.229 --> 00:01:45.679
 tendonitis and alcohol association from 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.500
 button 

00:01:45.679 --> 00:01:51.710
 unfortunately it is so and serves a lot is a 

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:54.110
 educational training method teaches you 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:55.610
 that fashion is above all sacrifice 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:57.920
 I would like you to expect the 

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:01.350
 concept of seasonality 

00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:05.009
 how to say a living closet made of 

00:02:01.350 --> 00:02:06.810
 timeless garments without season that 

00:02:05.009 --> 00:02:07.979
 does not follow any of the trends 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:09.720
 current 

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:11.780
 I realize that it could be from 

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:14.790
 commercial point of view a very idea 

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:16.800
 however, bankruptcy if I close the 

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.330
 eyes just imagine a future not 

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.720
 Too far 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.760
 I imagine 

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.400
 that black of not being able to save the 

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:25.420
 own clothes from a printer to from 

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:27.340
 home 

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:30.900
 therefore we will all become eight producers 

00:02:27.340 --> 00:02:30.900
 of our needs 

00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:38.050
 imagine a cool pair piston 

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:41.440
 of shoes is up to the mold maybe a 

00:02:38.050 --> 00:02:44.560
 payment with 3d houses what the figure is 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:46.870
 of design and promote short I had 

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:48.760
 the opportunity to present mine 

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:51.610
 collection during london fashion 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:54.310
 week last June and that was 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:57.340
 my first catwalk the adrenaline 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:03:00.420
 indus press the fear of failure 

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:02.950
 they were the masters but in the end 

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:05.920
 the excitement and joy of living that 

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:08.380
 unique moment they won on everything is 

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:10.180
 a unique experience that I hope to 

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:12.420
 repeat as soon as possible 

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:16.660
 currently working with a creative team 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:20.370
 very stimulating if they see growth 

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:24.400
 continuous stylistic and artistic growth 

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:26.140
 I learn many teachings I believe of 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.610
 having to learn a lot more to 

00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:29.530
 achieve the goals that I have 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:32.740
 also because I really am 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:36.790
 high correlate to capture something to go 

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:38.500
 besides enriching a space 

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:41.410
 this is the case of horror vacui that 

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:43.750
 defines an artistic trend from which 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:46.060
 the one from which I took inspiration for 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:48.970
 this collection is one 

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:52.630
 occupied and enriched space 

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:55.240
 from details to minimum details 

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:58.470
 the collection starts from the idea 

00:03:55.240 --> 00:04:02.770
 to give freedom opportunities to 

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:06.760
 evoke distant times 

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:09.730
 this also thanks to the fabrics they have 

00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:13.390
 the vintage style of the upholstery of the 

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:15.700
 grandma evoke me and many memories for the 

00:04:13.390 --> 00:04:17.890
 shapes the silhouettes are always 

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:20.109
 influenced by the sport for which the 

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:23.800
 comfort for me is a component 

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:26.330
 all of these derive from this 

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:29.509
 over volumes 

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:33.969
 as a man yes because my woman is one 

00:04:29.509 --> 00:04:37.800
 woman or man a little sensual woman 

00:04:33.969 --> 00:04:40.450
 all the garments were built 

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:43.510
 modeling mind speaking not 

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:48.180
 correctly they are all imola all 

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:48.180
 draperies for which they are not replicated
