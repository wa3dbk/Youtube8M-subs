00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:06.240
 and that can my friends as they walk I am 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:09.570
 talent and I bring you a new glitch of 

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:12.360
 infinite money the way alone way 

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:13.709
 unlimited and very good money that are going to 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:15.660
 have you because I was 

00:00:13.709 --> 00:00:17.400
 asking blacks and about talent that in 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.980
 said again so slow on the internet 

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.840
 so good to start stage and my 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.000
 leagues we will have to move the car that 

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:25.230
 let's start in this video I'm going to 

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.150
 use my environment ok 

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:29.580
 so they go as my surroundings I change it 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:31.590
 of position and I will send it to the party 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:33.600
 which is close to the mechanic's wall 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.760
 ok the car we're going to want to lynch 

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.109
 in this case I see that environment is going to 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.820
 be in this position here 

00:00:37.109 --> 00:00:40.499
 obligatorily that is here in my 

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:42.719
 video this is to make it more 

00:00:40.499 --> 00:00:44.309
 easy to of this force that then 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.019
 simply move in the car what 

00:00:44.309 --> 00:00:48.359
 next thing we're going to do is we're going 

00:00:46.019 --> 00:00:49.980
 to buy a car that does not 

00:00:48.359 --> 00:00:51.989
 we are going to buy they are not going to spend anything of 

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.159
 money so do not worry they're going to 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.440
 grab any car that you 

00:00:53.159 --> 00:00:56.819
 They want as rebel grabbed because 

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:59.840
 it is custom but it can grab 

00:00:56.819 --> 00:01:01.970
 Any car you want 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:04.129
 once they grasp they simply choose 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:05.540
 the color and we give you buy and here this 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:07.490
 it's very important to get there they have to 

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:10.190
 have two garages if you do not have 

00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:12.470
 two garages have to have the only 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:14.060
 garage that have completely full ok 

00:01:12.470 --> 00:01:16.460
 but you have two garages like me 

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:18.260
 simply when I tell you which ones 

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:20.540
 they see that the garage what they want is going to 

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:22.040
 move this toolbox and here 

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:24.320
 It's very funny because they will have to 

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:27.260
 move the toolbox so 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:28.430
 that they reach the environment of this 

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:30.680
 toolbox have to go up 

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:32.660
 the environment and they will push with the box 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:34.190
 of tools in your environment this is 

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:35.720
 thank you very much there is once the 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:38.030
 grab in the joke you just have to 

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:39.770
 move the pse around the part of the 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:42.399
 blue circle hortales bonds not like 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:42.399
 where is it 

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:53.200
 very well once after 

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:55.080
 entered with the box and sayÃ¡n the 

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:57.100
 battler will have to stay 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:58.240
 exactly as I am 

00:01:57.100 --> 00:02:00.040
 putting staying 

00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.080
 obviously not the same but good to see it on 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:04.240
 point is that the box must be 

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:06.700
 covering the door and the blue dot must 

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:08.770
 to be there ok the box covering a 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:10.750
 door is extremely important and that we 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:12.850
 we can grab the blue dot like 

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:15.040
 you can see when you chop it and to 

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:17.110
 get into the car we will go up later 

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:19.780
 then we 're going to teleport the 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:21.880
 bug well we're going to give it and then 

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:23.800
 then to the right ok and then later to the 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:25.150
 right as we're going to see what is going to 

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:27.459
 get it right as you can see what I do 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:29.080
 pause there is something that hurts me and it is 

00:02:27.459 --> 00:02:30.880
 watching my background monkey that plaster that 

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.980
 say they're wrong we 're going to do it 

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:34.720
 fast very fast and then then to the 

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:36.400
 right here you can see how it is no longer seen 

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:38.530
 my monkey or that a monkey is no longer seen 

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:39.970
 background that means that glitch already 

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:41.560
 we did some levels correctly 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:43.390
 when you no longer see your monkey the background that 

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:45.910
 yes that is correct the only thing that there is 

00:02:43.390 --> 00:02:48.250
 what to do now is replace the link 

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:49.930
 we're just going to duplicate for any other 

00:02:48.250 --> 00:02:51.920
 car that you do not want in this 

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:54.230
 I do not want the motorcycle 

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:56.239
 so let's double see it as 

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:58.250
 this duplicated the environment and my surroundings 

00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:00.200
 until the bottom is still there and its surroundings 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:02.060
 it's still there to the bottom that the only thing 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:03.739
 what you have to do now is give it go and 

00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:06.050
 as you can see here we are in our 

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:07.640
 environments we simply accelerate it to 

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:10.040
 leave the garage and we would be 

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:12.230
 duplicating our car so this is 

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.910
 extremely easy my lives the only thing that 

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:16.220
 must be done now is to handle the 

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:18.680
 antros customs and you do not have to be marked 

00:03:16.220 --> 00:03:20.450
 the mechanic or do anything like that so 

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:22.430
 As we sell we will enter with our 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:24.319
 vehicle and we will sell it is 

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:26.720
 extremely easy extremely simple 

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:28.400
 more complicated part would be to move the box 

00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:30.110
 in opposition but it can be a bit 

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.970
 fun if the war or any 

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:34.310
 wave so we're going to sell it and they're going 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:37.100
 to give 194 thousand I hope you liked it 

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:38.840
 I serve you friends and use it I am 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:41.920
 talent subscribe leave your like and we 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:41.920
 we see in the following video 

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:46.060
