there's well my wires are going through

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.470 
there's well my wires are going through
down<00:00:35.190> into<00:00:35.489> the<00:00:35.550> bottom<00:00:35.820> we're<00:00:35.910> going<00:00:36.090> to<00:00:36.180> be

00:00:36.470 --> 00:00:36.480 
down into the bottom we're going to be

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.490 
down into the bottom we're going to be
doing<00:00:36.630> all<00:00:36.809> my<00:00:36.930> connecting<00:00:37.410> and<00:00:38.660> this<00:00:39.660> wire

is the one that's going to be going down

00:00:52.379 --> 00:00:57.260 
is the one that's going to be going down
to<00:00:52.860> my<00:00:53.070> transducer<00:00:53.969> the<00:00:55.699> part<00:00:56.699> on<00:00:56.879> it<00:00:57.000> was<00:00:57.090> too

00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:57.270 
to my transducer the part on it was too

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:58.670 
to my transducer the part on it was too
big<00:00:57.449> for<00:00:57.510> me<00:00:57.780> to<00:00:57.899> run<00:00:58.079> through<00:00:58.350> with<00:00:58.500> my

00:00:58.670 --> 00:00:58.680 
big for me to run through with my

00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:00.260 
big for me to run through with my
regular<00:00:58.829> wire<00:00:59.219> England<00:00:59.640> so<00:00:59.789> I<00:00:59.850> just<00:01:00.030> had<00:01:00.149> to

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
regular wire England so I just had to

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.680 
regular wire England so I just had to
run<00:01:00.390> it<00:01:00.539> over<00:01:00.750> the<00:01:00.870> top<00:01:01.079> for<00:01:01.320> now<00:01:02.449> then<00:01:03.449> you<00:01:03.539> got

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:03.690 
run it over the top for now then you got

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:06.649 
run it over the top for now then you got
this<00:01:03.840> T<00:01:04.170> piece<00:01:04.470> here<00:01:04.799> you<00:01:05.010> have<00:01:05.640> to<00:01:05.909> have<00:01:05.939> this

00:01:06.649 --> 00:01:06.659 
this T piece here you have to have this

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:10.270 
this T piece here you have to have this
connector<00:01:07.490> or<00:01:08.490> else<00:01:08.610> it<00:01:08.760> will<00:01:08.909> not<00:01:09.150> work<00:01:09.360> so

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:10.280 
connector or else it will not work so

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:13.160 
connector or else it will not work so
one<00:01:11.280> of<00:01:11.310> the<00:01:11.549> pieces<00:01:11.760> is<00:01:12.150> going<00:01:12.420> to<00:01:12.540> go<00:01:12.689> off<00:01:12.869> to

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:13.170 
one of the pieces is going to go off to

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.710 
one of the pieces is going to go off to
just<00:01:13.979> a<00:01:14.100> short<00:01:14.369> little<00:01:14.549> pigtail<00:01:15.060> that<00:01:15.600> will

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:15.720 
just a short little pigtail that will

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:19.310 
just a short little pigtail that will
connect<00:01:16.020> into<00:01:16.439> the<00:01:16.470> back<00:01:16.710> of<00:01:16.740> the<00:01:17.250> GPS<00:01:17.939> or<00:01:18.450> back

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320 
connect into the back of the GPS or back

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:22.460 
connect into the back of the GPS or back
of<00:01:19.500> the<00:01:19.560> unit<00:01:20.210> then<00:01:21.210> this<00:01:21.570> piece<00:01:21.840> here<00:01:22.320> this

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
of the unit then this piece here this

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:26.649 
of the unit then this piece here this
wire<00:01:23.100> is<00:01:23.400> going<00:01:23.820> to<00:01:23.909> go<00:01:24.479> to<00:01:24.540> the<00:01:25.110> actual

00:01:26.649 --> 00:01:26.659 
wire is going to go to the actual

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:31.520 
wire is going to go to the actual
antenna<00:01:28.729> which<00:01:29.729> it's<00:01:30.420> it<00:01:30.930> does<00:01:31.229> I<00:01:31.500> just

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:31.530 
antenna which it's it does I just

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:33.140 
antenna which it's it does I just
already<00:01:31.920> have<00:01:32.130> it<00:01:32.280> routed<00:01:32.430> down<00:01:32.790> through<00:01:33.119> I

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:33.150 
already have it routed down through I

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:34.700 
already have it routed down through I
just<00:01:33.450> thought<00:01:33.630> about<00:01:33.659> making<00:01:34.110> this<00:01:34.200> video<00:01:34.500> now

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
just thought about making this video now

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.480 
just thought about making this video now
so<00:01:35.070> anyway<00:01:36.000> this<00:01:36.840> one<00:01:37.170> here<00:01:37.740> is<00:01:37.890> the<00:01:38.340> one

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
so anyway this one here is the one

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.450 
so anyway this one here is the one
that's<00:01:38.670> going<00:01:38.850> to<00:01:38.939> be<00:01:39.030> doing<00:01:39.270> all<00:01:39.509> of<00:01:39.689> your

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:40.460 
that's going to be doing all of your

00:01:40.460 --> 00:01:47.149 
that's going to be doing all of your
power<00:01:41.810> to<00:01:42.810> the<00:01:44.509> actual<00:01:45.509> unit<00:01:45.930> to<00:01:46.590> the<00:01:46.710> antenna

00:01:47.149 --> 00:01:47.159 
power to the actual unit to the antenna

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.039 
power to the actual unit to the antenna
and<00:01:47.549> it's<00:01:48.060> going<00:01:48.210> to<00:01:48.270> be<00:01:48.360> doing<00:01:48.509> all<00:01:48.720> of<00:01:48.780> the

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.049 
and it's going to be doing all of the

00:01:49.049 --> 00:01:51.590 
and it's going to be doing all of the
system<00:01:49.560> stuff<00:01:49.860> so<00:01:50.159> that<00:01:51.060> one's<00:01:51.299> the<00:01:51.450> one

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:51.600 
system stuff so that one's the one

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:52.910 
system stuff so that one's the one
that's<00:01:51.780> going<00:01:51.899> to<00:01:51.960> be<00:01:52.020> running<00:01:52.229> the<00:01:52.380> power<00:01:52.590> and

00:01:52.910 --> 00:01:52.920 
that's going to be running the power and

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.460 
that's going to be running the power and
I<00:01:52.979> already<00:01:53.460> ran<00:01:53.640> power<00:01:53.939> down<00:01:54.390> through<00:01:54.869> there

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
I already ran power down through there

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.999 
I already ran power down through there
and<00:01:56.329> over<00:01:57.329> to<00:01:58.110> here<00:01:58.380> which<00:01:58.590> is<00:01:58.740> where<00:01:58.890> my

00:01:58.999 --> 00:01:59.009 
and over to here which is where my

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:01.280 
and over to here which is where my
stereo<00:01:59.460> is<00:01:59.700> if<00:02:00.090> you<00:02:00.479> can<00:02:00.600> see<00:02:00.810> the<00:02:00.960> red<00:02:01.259> and

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:01.290 
stereo is if you can see the red and

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:04.190 
stereo is if you can see the red and
black<00:02:01.530> wire<00:02:01.829> there<00:02:02.159> with<00:02:02.490> the<00:02:02.909> fuse<00:02:03.750> attached

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:20.900 
from my battery there so what I'm going
to<00:02:18.600> do<00:02:18.840> is<00:02:19.020> I'm<00:02:19.200> going<00:02:19.230> to<00:02:19.590> cut<00:02:19.860> the<00:02:20.190> white<00:02:20.610> and

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 
to do is I'm going to cut the white and

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:23.810 
to do is I'm going to cut the white and
the<00:02:21.030> brown<00:02:21.210> wire<00:02:21.800> electrical<00:02:22.800> tape<00:02:22.980> for<00:02:23.520> wires

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:23.820 
the brown wire electrical tape for wires

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:26.000 
the brown wire electrical tape for wires
to<00:02:24.360> that<00:02:24.540> one<00:02:24.720> so<00:02:24.930> that<00:02:25.080> I've<00:02:25.170> got<00:02:25.200> ground<00:02:25.680> and

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.010 
to that one so that I've got ground and

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.240 
to that one so that I've got ground and
power<00:02:26.370> for<00:02:26.910> both<00:02:26.940> and<00:02:27.710> then<00:02:28.710> I'll<00:02:28.830> be<00:02:28.980> able<00:02:29.070> to

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:29.250 
power for both and then I'll be able to

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:31.730 
power for both and then I'll be able to
do<00:02:29.430> my<00:02:29.580> connections<00:02:30.120> at<00:02:30.300> that<00:02:30.480> time<00:02:30.780> they

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:31.740 
do my connections at that time they

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:34.160 
do my connections at that time they
recommend<00:02:32.280> not<00:02:32.490> connecting<00:02:33.210> the<00:02:33.390> same<00:02:33.660> power

00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:34.170 
recommend not connecting the same power

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:37.610 
recommend not connecting the same power
and<00:02:34.560> ground<00:02:34.860> for<00:02:35.640> the<00:02:35.790> GPS<00:02:36.300> that's<00:02:37.200> also

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:37.620 
and ground for the GPS that's also

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.680 
and ground for the GPS that's also
running<00:02:37.830> the<00:02:38.040> depth<00:02:38.310> finder<00:02:38.670> power<00:02:38.880> because

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690 
running the depth finder power because

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.530 
running the depth finder power because
of<00:02:39.720> interference<00:02:40.130> so<00:02:41.130> I<00:02:41.390> would<00:02:42.390> recommend

00:02:42.530 --> 00:02:42.540 
of interference so I would recommend

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.600 
of interference so I would recommend
doing<00:02:43.020> that<00:02:43.320> they<00:02:43.620> also<00:02:43.770> say<00:02:44.190> that<00:02:44.220> if<00:02:44.460> you're

00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:44.610 
doing that they also say that if you're

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:46.430 
doing that they also say that if you're
running<00:02:44.700> it<00:02:44.940> along<00:02:45.030> stereo<00:02:45.630> wires<00:02:45.900> that<00:02:46.260> could

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:46.440 
running it along stereo wires that could

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:48.320 
running it along stereo wires that could
mess<00:02:46.650> it<00:02:46.800> up<00:02:46.890> too<00:02:47.130> so<00:02:47.400> I<00:02:47.640> don't<00:02:47.910> know<00:02:48.150> we'll<00:02:48.300> see

00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:48.330 
mess it up too so I don't know we'll see

00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:49.280 
mess it up too so I don't know we'll see
what<00:02:48.630> happens

00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:49.290 
what happens

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:51.440 
what happens
but<00:02:50.010> anyhow<00:02:50.460> I'm<00:02:50.730> going<00:02:50.940> to<00:02:51.000> go<00:02:51.120> ahead<00:02:51.180> and<00:02:51.360> get

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:51.450 
but anyhow I'm going to go ahead and get

00:02:51.450 --> 00:02:53.180 
but anyhow I'm going to go ahead and get
started<00:02:51.600> with<00:02:51.930> that<00:02:51.960> and<00:02:52.620> Alysha<00:02:52.890> know<00:02:53.010> how<00:02:53.130> it

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:53.190 
started with that and Alysha know how it

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:58.670 
started with that and Alysha know how it
goes<00:02:53.370> okay<00:02:55.880> youtubers<00:02:56.900> what<00:02:57.900> I've<00:02:58.080> done<00:02:58.380> here

00:02:58.670 --> 00:02:58.680 
goes okay youtubers what I've done here

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:00.350 
goes okay youtubers what I've done here
is<00:02:58.830> I<00:02:58.980> went<00:02:59.130> ahead<00:02:59.220> and<00:02:59.400> took<00:02:59.670> that<00:02:59.910> main<00:03:00.120> wire

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:00.360 
is I went ahead and took that main wire

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.190 
is I went ahead and took that main wire
out<00:03:00.630> just<00:03:00.930> to<00:03:01.050> give<00:03:01.230> you<00:03:01.320> a<00:03:01.380> better<00:03:01.530> look<00:03:01.860> at<00:03:02.100> it

the blue yellow and orange are other
data<00:03:25.620> wires<00:03:26.180> you<00:03:27.180> can<00:03:27.360> hook<00:03:28.050> this<00:03:28.320> one<00:03:28.560> up<00:03:28.740> so

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:28.980 
data wires you can hook this one up so

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:30.740 
data wires you can hook this one up so
that<00:03:29.100> you<00:03:29.160> can<00:03:29.340> see<00:03:29.520> where<00:03:29.760> your<00:03:29.880> gas<00:03:30.090> gauge<00:03:30.390> is

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:30.750 
that you can see where your gas gauge is

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:36.260 
that you can see where your gas gauge is
and<00:03:31.310> also<00:03:34.160> speed<00:03:35.160> they<00:03:35.670> got<00:03:35.820> a<00:03:35.850> little<00:03:36.090> thing

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:36.270 
and also speed they got a little thing

00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:37.460 
and also speed they got a little thing
that<00:03:36.330> you<00:03:36.510> can<00:03:36.690> put<00:03:36.870> down<00:03:36.990> there<00:03:37.170> by<00:03:37.290> your

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
that you can put down there by your

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:40.310 
that you can put down there by your
transducer<00:03:38.130> but<00:03:38.910> anyway<00:03:39.300> in<00:03:39.510> my<00:03:39.690> manual<00:03:39.930> that

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:40.320 
transducer but anyway in my manual that

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.050 
transducer but anyway in my manual that
shows<00:03:40.590> me<00:03:40.830> all<00:03:40.950> these<00:03:41.130> different<00:03:41.550> things<00:03:41.610> so

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:42.060 
shows me all these different things so

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:43.160 
shows me all these different things so
you'll<00:03:42.270> probably<00:03:42.450> want<00:03:42.720> to<00:03:42.810> go<00:03:42.930> to<00:03:42.990> your

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:43.170 
you'll probably want to go to your

00:03:43.170 --> 00:03:44.840 
you'll probably want to go to your
manual<00:03:43.410> just<00:03:43.830> to<00:03:44.010> double-check<00:03:44.340> make<00:03:44.700> sure

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:44.850 
manual just to double-check make sure

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:47.500 
manual just to double-check make sure
you're<00:03:45.000> not<00:03:45.120> hooking<00:03:45.360> wires<00:03:45.630> up<00:03:46.320> that<00:03:46.950> are

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:47.510 
you're not hooking wires up that are

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:49.730 
you're not hooking wires up that are
correct<00:03:48.510> for<00:03:48.600> mine<00:03:48.930> but<00:03:49.140> not<00:03:49.290> correct<00:03:49.650> for

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:49.740 
correct for mine but not correct for

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:52.220 
correct for mine but not correct for
yours<00:03:50.070> I<00:03:50.510> went<00:03:51.510> ahead<00:03:51.570> and<00:03:51.810> pulled<00:03:52.020> these

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:52.230 
yours I went ahead and pulled these

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:55.970 
yours I went ahead and pulled these
wires<00:03:52.560> through<00:03:53.660> these<00:03:54.660> are<00:03:54.810> actually<00:03:55.290> trailer

00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:55.980 
wires through these are actually trailer

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:57.949 
wires through these are actually trailer
light<00:03:56.190> wires<00:03:56.490> that<00:03:57.030> I've<00:03:57.180> used<00:03:57.390> but<00:03:57.690> it's<00:03:57.870> a

00:03:57.949 --> 00:03:57.959 
light wires that I've used but it's a

00:03:57.959 --> 00:03:59.810 
light wires that I've used but it's a
low<00:03:58.110> voltage<00:03:58.530> wire<00:03:58.770> so<00:03:59.130> it<00:03:59.280> should<00:03:59.580> work<00:03:59.760> just

00:03:59.810 --> 00:03:59.820 
low voltage wire so it should work just

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:03.020 
low voltage wire so it should work just
fine<00:04:00.120> I<00:04:00.270> was<00:04:00.510> using<00:04:00.660> that<00:04:00.900> before<00:04:01.230> and<00:04:01.760> as<00:04:02.760> you

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
fine I was using that before and as you

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:05.090 
fine I was using that before and as you
can<00:04:03.120> see<00:04:03.300> I've<00:04:03.420> got<00:04:03.600> two<00:04:03.900> Browns<00:04:04.200> a<00:04:04.530> yellow<00:04:04.830> and

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:05.100 
can see I've got two Browns a yellow and

00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:06.650 
can see I've got two Browns a yellow and
a<00:04:05.130> green<00:04:05.160> so<00:04:05.700> I'm<00:04:05.790> going<00:04:06.000> to<00:04:06.060> go<00:04:06.180> ahead<00:04:06.300> and<00:04:06.510> use

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:06.660 
a green so I'm going to go ahead and use

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:09.320 
a green so I'm going to go ahead and use
the<00:04:07.020> two<00:04:07.830> brown<00:04:08.070> wires<00:04:08.340> as<00:04:08.640> ground<00:04:08.940> wires<00:04:09.180> just

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:09.330 
the two brown wires as ground wires just

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:13.090 
the two brown wires as ground wires just
to<00:04:09.720> keep<00:04:09.840> everything<00:04:10.200> organized

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:13.100 

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:15.940 

all<00:04:14.000> right<00:04:14.270> so<00:04:14.570> I<00:04:14.600> went<00:04:14.810> ahead<00:04:14.990> made<00:04:15.710> all<00:04:15.920> of

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:15.950 
all right so I went ahead made all of

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:24.620 
electrical tape you can pick this up at

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:26.800 
electrical tape you can pick this up at
any<00:04:24.710> hardware<00:04:24.950> store<00:04:25.430> and<00:04:26.030> I<00:04:26.300> just<00:04:26.330> brushed

any hardware store and I just brushed

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:28.420 
any hardware store and I just brushed
that<00:04:26.930> around<00:04:27.320> the<00:04:27.440> connection<00:04:27.890> to<00:04:27.980> make<00:04:28.130> sure

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:28.430 
that around the connection to make sure

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:29.680 
that around the connection to make sure
that<00:04:28.670> I'm<00:04:28.790> not<00:04:28.820> going<00:04:29.060> to<00:04:29.150> get<00:04:29.300> any<00:04:29.450> moisture

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:29.690

in there or anything like that that

00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:35.470 
in there or anything like that that
could<00:04:32.240> create<00:04:32.480> corrosion<00:04:33.850> it<00:04:34.850> helps<00:04:35.210> a<00:04:35.300> lot

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:35.480 
could create corrosion it helps a lot

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:37.030 
could create corrosion it helps a lot
especially<00:04:35.690> if<00:04:36.080> you're<00:04:36.200> on<00:04:36.260> a<00:04:36.320> boat<00:04:36.650> because

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:41.380 
getting wet on the boat all I got left
to<00:04:39.950> do<00:04:40.070> is<00:04:40.100> just<00:04:40.250> mount<00:04:40.700> the<00:04:40.850> antenna<00:04:40.940> I've

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:41.390 
to do is just mount the antenna I've

00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:43.080 
to do is just mount the antenna I've
already<00:04:41.660> connected<00:04:42.170> to<00:04:42.320> the<00:04:42.410> battery<00:04:42.740> and

00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:43.090 
already connected to the battery and

00:04:43.090 --> 00:04:45.520 
already connected to the battery and
then<00:04:44.090> just<00:04:44.450> make<00:04:44.660> sure<00:04:44.870> that<00:04:44.900> everything

00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:45.530 
then just make sure that everything

00:04:45.530 --> 00:04:47.980 
then just make sure that everything
powers<00:04:45.950> up<00:04:46.160> correctly<00:04:46.670> so<00:04:47.420> if<00:04:47.540> you<00:04:47.690> have<00:04:47.810> any

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:47.990 
powers up correctly so if you have any

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:49.390 
powers up correctly so if you have any
other<00:04:48.170> questions<00:04:48.680> you<00:04:49.010> know<00:04:49.100> you<00:04:49.190> can<00:04:49.310> go
