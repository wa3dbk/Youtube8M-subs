00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:09.710
 did you have something nice on Saturday? 

00:00:07.700 --> 00:00:13.490
 well, all guys from my singing 

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:15.050
 troopers are dead so not really if 

00:00:13.490 --> 00:00:17.269
 You're taking a book from accounting 

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:19.340
 Date certainly asks you question why question 

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:21.400
 I do not mean to shy or too 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:21.400
 scared 

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:29.410
 he has a wrong 1 

00:00:26.750 --> 00:00:29.410
 no he did `nt 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:39.180
 I'm at fourth humans too 

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:41.760
 Protect Captain to a better world 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:44.030
 you sometimes have to create the old one 

00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:47.379
 to destroy 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:47.379
 and that creates enemies 

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:54.219
 Are you ready to show the world how? 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:57.320
 they really are 

00:00:54.219 --> 00:01:01.650
 Look out of the window to know her 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:04.910
 the rules of the game gas war 

00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:04.910
 A single step is enough 

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:11.430
 eliminate many threats before it 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:12.630
 ever thought I thought that 

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.180
 punishment comes only after the 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:16.130
 crime 

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:17.930
 Shield takes the world as it is not 

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:21.940
 as we wish 

00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:21.940
 that is not freedom that is fear 

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:29.009
 you have to keep both eyes open 

00:01:25.619 --> 00:01:31.759
 before we start anybody 

00:01:29.009 --> 00:01:31.759
 rising up 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.440
 her work was a gift for her 

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:41.110
 mankind 

00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:44.910
 they shaped the century 

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:44.910
 they have to die again 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:55.780
 it's your turn 

00:01:52.510 --> 00:01:55.780
 it starts
