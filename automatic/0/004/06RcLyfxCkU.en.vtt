00:00:08.889 --> 00:00:13.610
 johann Taddigs now quite normal then 

00:00:11.509 --> 00:00:14.780
 again via call of duty fans hit in 

00:00:13.610 --> 00:00:16.039
 This is the new one today 

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:17.930
 small guns drc what we get 

00:00:16.039 --> 00:00:20.210
 something will reward the championship 

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:22.250
 personalization spec that is now too 

00:00:20.210 --> 00:00:23.750
 already for xbox live I believe since two 

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:24.260
 or three days available I know 

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:25.940
 not exactly 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.110
 and we also have a little trailer 

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:28.670
 get to see the looks now 

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:30.980
 the background that they are in the whole 

00:00:28.670 --> 00:00:31.910
 game quasi So what you look like already 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:33.500
 on the name recognize this 

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:35.120
 Personalization spec is oriented 

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:36.530
 almost to the call of duty championship 

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:38.420
 So that 's almost the motto of this 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:39.290
 Personalization spex and you see 

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:40.910
 times as always at the 

00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:42.829
 Personalization Spex a new weapon 

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:44.420
 camouflage as well as a new existential idea 

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:46.820
 a new calling card and then 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:49.460
 crosshairs so we retracted crosses 

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:50.930
 quasi and yes these weapons camouflage is 

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.520
 now quite golden so the people 

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:54.290
 I also think she looks pretty golden 

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.970
 a bit more golden than the normal one 

00:00:54.290 --> 00:00:57.739
 golden flags how to unlock 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:59.690
 I think I'm pretty pretty 

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:02.149
 cool so it reminds me 

00:00:59.690 --> 00:01:03.620
 a bit of the gold idea of â€‹â€‹politics 

00:01:02.149 --> 00:01:05.510
 great that we did not like it 

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:07.240
 So that's a nice gold 

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:09.650
 Variant but I am from the color ago 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:10.460
 but she shines a lot more so me 

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:12.530
 italy place looks definitely 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.659
 pretty cool out then there are still so 

00:01:12.530 --> 00:01:15.530
 small silver star pattern while the 

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:18.140
 makes that I also find something else 

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:19.670
 nobler still a little cooler so I think 

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:21.860
 this pretty cool that on the weapon 

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:23.210
 on the exer skeleton I find her so yes 

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:25.790
 also ok but I will 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:27.500
 on the weapon something better on the 

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:28.970
 ex is now you can see she has too 

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.200
 almost the same color and then it is 

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:33.020
 again this call of duty 

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.460
 championship in the symbol on it looks yes 

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.140
 Definitely pretty cool then 

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:37.250
 you still get a calling card 

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.200
 I do not think so mega right now 

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:41.689
 spectacular but there you can stop 

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.790
 to get at the crosshairs you get 

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:45.320
 Amazon I honestly do not know what 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:47.390
 It looks completely like a stroke 

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:49.610
 then you get such a star and 

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:51.710
 then another aviv in the crosshairs 

00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:53.390
 yes these are all things again 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:54.770
 which are not so useful but stop 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:56.659
 maybe it's funny 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:59.000
 play and this personalization 

00:01:56.659 --> 00:02:00.770
 pack costs 399 then we have too 

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.110
 others have with this little the rca 

00:02:00.770 --> 00:02:05.180
 we have more small dlc features 

00:02:03.110 --> 00:02:06.439
 get added once 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:08.750
 can you still look for 1 399 

00:02:06.439 --> 00:02:11.630
 buy that 120 more places at the 

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:13.120
 away so equipment the quasi has so 

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:15.700
 these things always hit those things 

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:18.040
 that there are about 120 places more 

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:19.180
 Yes, that is sometimes completely 

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:20.560
 useful if you have it all full 

00:02:19.180 --> 00:02:22.110
 but I think you can anyway the 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.769
 all right what you do not need so 

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:25.750
 I do not need that now 

00:02:23.769 --> 00:02:27.250
 absolutely and a big 99 yes too 

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:28.450
 some money but as I said is yours 

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:28.840
 decision so you can do like 

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:30.970
 you want 

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:33.129
 and then there is another for 1 99 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:34.599
 m extra creative class so that 

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:36.940
 We can still make more classes 

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:38.290
 then you can class 50 in total 

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:39.730
 So that's definitely the case 

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:41.440
 A lot around that was also in 

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:43.420
 black ops 2 I think so patched 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.790
 That's definitely what I am 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:47.709
 always buy me so yes because I always 

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:49.450
 good if you have more classes but 

00:02:47.709 --> 00:02:50.859
 can also be that in the classes 

00:02:49.450 --> 00:02:52.150
 be happy when you prestige me 

00:02:50.859 --> 00:02:54.129
 then always have ffh class rule 

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:55.150
 class and so on so you can 

00:02:54.129 --> 00:02:56.709
 We always write that you are from these 

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:57.609
 deals the stuff so you 'd think me 

00:02:56.709 --> 00:03:00.010
 me as I said in any case the 

00:02:57.609 --> 00:03:01.629
 buy creative class lotz and also that 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.980
 the personalization spec which the 

00:03:01.629 --> 00:03:04.930
 Camouflage really cool 

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:06.430
 and then you have it for virtually every one of us 

00:03:04.930 --> 00:03:07.900
 weapon freely switched so weapons 

00:03:06.430 --> 00:03:08.920
 that you do not play that often and where you 

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:10.629
 still no good camouflage for 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:12.519
 has unlocked then you have virtually 

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:13.780
 already a pretty cool golden one 

00:03:12.519 --> 00:03:14.470
 Camouflage for that I really think 

00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:15.970
 Pretty cool 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:18.099
 so as I said write me with it 

00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:19.030
 your opinion so that was it but now 

00:03:18.099 --> 00:03:20.349
 video if you liked what 

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:23.579
 yourself a thumbs upwards and 

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:23.579
 the resulting skin purely wanted
