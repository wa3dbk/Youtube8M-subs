tricks it looks so beautiful especially
when<00:00:30.759> you<00:00:30.880> have<00:00:31.029> tails<00:00:31.360> your<00:00:31.899> boy<00:00:33.360> ok<00:00:34.360> let's

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:34.780 
when you have tails your boy ok let's

when you have tails your boy ok let's
start<00:00:35.079> the<00:00:35.170> lesson<00:00:35.530> I<00:00:36.360> mentioned<00:00:37.360> the<00:00:37.840> three

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:38.140 
start the lesson I mentioned the three

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:41.190 
start the lesson I mentioned the three
between<00:00:38.680> is<00:00:39.520> called<00:00:40.000> a<00:00:40.239> three-peat<00:00:40.809> Queen

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:41.200 
between is called a three-peat Queen

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:44.430 
between is called a three-peat Queen
because<00:00:42.129> you've<00:00:42.460> got<00:00:42.640> three<00:00:43.210> turns<00:00:43.660> of<00:00:44.379> the

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:44.440 
because you've got three turns of the

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.029 
because you've got three turns of the
poise<00:00:44.860> each<00:00:45.399> side<00:00:45.969> of<00:00:46.239> you<00:00:46.739> so<00:00:47.739> for<00:00:47.949> example

00:00:48.029 --> 00:00:48.039 
poise each side of you so for example

00:00:48.039 --> 00:00:52.950 
poise each side of you so for example
the<00:00:48.820> white<00:00:49.089> boy<00:00:49.620> will<00:00:50.620> turn<00:00:50.949> twice<00:00:51.850> this<00:00:52.600> side

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:52.960 
the white boy will turn twice this side

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.180 
the white boy will turn twice this side
and<00:00:53.320> the<00:00:54.249> pink<00:00:54.519> one<00:00:54.789> will<00:00:55.359> turn<00:00:55.629> once<00:00:56.190> totaling

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:57.190 
and the pink one will turn once totaling

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:59.549 
and the pink one will turn once totaling
three<00:00:57.519> and<00:00:58.480> it's<00:00:58.600> the<00:00:58.749> opposite<00:00:59.260> the<00:00:59.409> other

00:00:59.549 --> 00:00:59.559 
three and it's the opposite the other

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:03.840 
three and it's the opposite the other
side<00:00:59.859> so<00:01:00.609> the<00:01:00.850> pink<00:01:01.239> will<00:01:02.140> turn<00:01:02.440> twice<00:01:02.920> this

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:03.850 
side so the pink will turn twice this

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:09.930 
side so the pink will turn twice this
side<00:01:04.150> and<00:01:04.480> the<00:01:05.199> white<00:01:05.970> just<00:01:06.970> the<00:01:07.180> one<00:01:07.770> ok<00:01:08.940> we're

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:09.940 
side and the white just the one ok we're

side and the white just the one ok we're
going<00:01:10.090> to<00:01:10.210> get<00:01:10.270> one<00:01:10.479> point<00:01:10.780> going<00:01:11.050> at<00:01:11.260> a<00:01:11.380> time

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:11.620 
going to get one point going at a time

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:13.800 
going to get one point going at a time
so<00:01:12.340> the<00:01:12.520> other<00:01:12.640> one<00:01:12.850> we're<00:01:13.120> going<00:01:13.240> to<00:01:13.300> wind<00:01:13.540> up

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:37.520 
doing that quite natural that you don't

00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:40.130 
doing that quite natural that you don't
need<00:02:37.610> to<00:02:37.730> think<00:02:37.940> too<00:02:38.330> much

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
need to think too much

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.870 
need to think too much
and<00:02:40.230> then<00:02:40.350> you<00:02:40.470> can<00:02:40.650> try<00:02:40.890> on<00:02:41.580> the<00:02:41.880> other<00:02:41.910> hand

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:43.880 
and then you can try on the other hand

and then you can try on the other hand
like<00:02:44.450> that<00:02:44.750> one<00:02:44.990> up<00:02:45.170> behind<00:02:46.010> you<00:02:52.780> two<00:02:53.780> turns

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:54.110 
like that one up behind you two turns

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:58.610 
like that one up behind you two turns
this<00:02:54.500> side<00:02:55.090> one<00:02:56.090> turn<00:02:56.420> that<00:02:56.660> side

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
this side one turn that side

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:06.150 
this side one turn that side
