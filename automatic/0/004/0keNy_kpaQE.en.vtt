00:00:03.340 --> 00:00:05.610
 In this case, I will tell you about 

00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:07.480
 the multimedia features of this 

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:09.730
 the most interesting part is the second 

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:13.060
 video review and so what we have here is about us 

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:15.840
 there is almost everything you need but in 

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:16.880
 first this is musical 

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.940
 the player is if the radio score 

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:21.930
 there are also video players and 

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.339
 so forth however nightingales 

00:00:24.339 --> 00:00:26.399
 will be held in Vladivostok Ukraine 

00:00:26.399 --> 00:00:28.419
 and connect the headset to connect 

00:00:28.419 --> 00:00:31.419
 headset and launch rockets 

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.450
 Here is such a thing about the fact that nothing else 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:36.980
 no, you can turn over 

00:00:36.980 --> 00:00:39.980
 radio stations like this 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:44.190
 there are small settings but again 

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:47.770
 for this, however, you can configure and 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:49.600
 disable whose weight 

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.570
 that's actually nothing more than anyone 

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:54.170
 on the other hand, there must not be any 

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:55.470
 i.e 

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:57.840
 during the music player music 

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:00.630
 the player here is absolutely standard nothing 

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:03.770
 new should not your added 

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:05.360
 no record, we don't need 

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.840
 but unfortunately for some reason not 

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:09.940
 P 

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:12.260
 couldn't scan map 

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:15.010
 I do not know the memory for what reason 

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:16.830
 memory card have music 

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:18.920
 compositions of new why so 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:21.900
 not scanned therefore 

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:24.439
 take advantage of the assets in fire 

00:01:24.439 --> 00:01:27.710
 called and here let's say some 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:30.540
 melodies 

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.549
 Nigeria national team portrait of a lady gaga 

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:35.710
 barbie sentence just at me 

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:38.430
 so just a memory card on which 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:39.950
 back in spring 

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:41.970
 everything is standard 

00:01:41.970 --> 00:01:45.090
 so loudly loudly loudly loudness and 

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:48.580
 go 

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:51.490
 if so let's say relatively large 

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:54.570
 of them are very nice to sit on cisco cisco nexus 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:55.750
 one 

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.750
 itar tass 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:07.120
 but 

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:09.590
 usually in similar devices and very 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:11.300
 expensive set 

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.770
 dynamics of the brake but MSK squeaks critics 

00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:16.040
 which only the sound incomprehensible rents 

00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:18.900
 easyjet dynamo pretty good until 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:21.790
 know how to listen to at least some melodies 

00:02:21.790 --> 00:02:24.790
 which is 1000 m here 

00:02:41.299 --> 00:02:44.469
 dollars a nice short sound so 

00:02:44.469 --> 00:02:48.459
 now see the video video here m m 

00:02:48.459 --> 00:02:51.559
 the place of my book about special action movies 

00:02:51.559 --> 00:02:54.680
 recorded plot in public naumov 

00:02:55.429 --> 00:02:58.589
 Viktor Ivanovich compared with the forecast 

00:02:58.589 --> 00:03:01.589
 stable 

00:03:19.449 --> 00:03:23.649
 standard video 320 240 he pulls and more 

00:03:23.649 --> 00:03:24.959
 permissions 

00:03:24.959 --> 00:03:28.499
 but I don't think it makes sense 

00:03:28.499 --> 00:03:30.959
 the phone concluded the expert 

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:32.759
 it's hard not to see a little bit now 

00:03:32.759 --> 00:03:34.359
 will find 

00:03:34.359 --> 00:03:37.359
 but this video does not play 

00:03:38.260 --> 00:03:40.909
 it's just unbelievable 

00:03:40.909 --> 00:03:45.449
 further well yes it is very big trouble he 

00:03:45.449 --> 00:03:47.339
 argue out 

00:03:47.339 --> 00:03:48.929
 and more roddick 

00:03:48.929 --> 00:03:51.949
 so thats what 3 3 4 

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:58.049
 these tenge 

00:04:00.919 --> 00:04:04.129
 in Odessa is very scary completion of communication 

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:06.590
 so here is also a good form of a thought already 

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:08.840
 let's see 

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:11.840
 more permissions 9 

00:04:25.849 --> 00:04:27.289
 these 

00:04:27.289 --> 00:04:30.289
 m 

00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:38.560
 congress in general we can say that he 

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:40.570
 not bad that the sun loses 

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:43.570
 video files but the size is 640 by 480 

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:47.199
 other oak but already lag on all the same smaller 

00:04:47.199 --> 00:04:49.990
 the completion of what is started is possible 

00:04:49.990 --> 00:04:53.520
 small such freezes and so 

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:55.449
 further and so on 

00:04:55.449 --> 00:04:58.650
 but what can I say that I'm not bad 

00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:01.790
 there is no standard connector in which 

00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:03.960
 radio there is music 

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:08.000
 The player is there is a price of 6 

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:10.400
 thousand rubles with connection and there is 

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:13.720
 there is but again we were told that his 

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:15.840
 closest competitor side if u 

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:18.150
 competitor can be called 

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:21.340
 and father's officer is not as 10 as I remember 

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:24.660
 or well, in short, what is 

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:27.130
 the nearest one will cost 7 1 8 

00:05:27.130 --> 00:05:30.180
 thousand rubles and now but you have to take it into account 

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:31.789
 again, you need to unlock 

00:05:31.789 --> 00:05:33.979
 unlock in any way 

00:05:33.979 --> 00:05:36.719
 besides the keys 

00:05:36.719 --> 00:05:39.689
 but we must bear in mind that there is a Wi-Fi 

00:05:39.689 --> 00:05:44.049
 here there are such spartak i eat at 

00:05:44.049 --> 00:05:45.919
 total percent all the most necessary 

00:05:45.919 --> 00:05:50.549
 needs think here is clear so stone with 

00:05:50.549 --> 00:05:51.870
 my point of view 

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:55.669
 give for your money well, just fine everything 

00:05:55.669 --> 00:05:57.729
 Thank you all for now since
