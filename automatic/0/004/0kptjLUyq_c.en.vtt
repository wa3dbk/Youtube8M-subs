00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:33.610 
sensor and what it's got is it's got a

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:36.270 
sensor and what it's got is it's got a
power<00:00:34.000> this<00:00:34.930> comes<00:00:35.230> from<00:00:35.350> the<00:00:35.500> accessory<00:00:36.070> or

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:36.280 
power this comes from the accessory or

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.880 
power this comes from the accessory or
the<00:00:36.370> 12<00:00:36.640> volt<00:00:36.880> rail<00:00:37.090> in<00:00:37.480> your<00:00:37.600> car<00:00:37.809> there's<00:00:38.770> a

00:00:38.880 --> 00:00:38.890 
the 12 volt rail in your car there's a

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:41.190 
the 12 volt rail in your car there's a
ground<00:00:39.190> which<00:00:39.790> obviously<00:00:40.270> gets<00:00:40.690> grounded<00:00:41.079> to

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:41.200 
ground which obviously gets grounded to

00:00:41.200 --> 00:00:43.380 
ground which obviously gets grounded to
the<00:00:41.320> chassis<00:00:41.559> or<00:00:42.040> wherever<00:00:42.550> the<00:00:42.850> return<00:00:43.120> path

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:43.390 
the chassis or wherever the return path

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:46.470 
the chassis or wherever the return path
is<00:00:43.629> and<00:00:43.870> then<00:00:44.800> there's<00:00:45.010> two<00:00:45.370> black<00:00:45.820> wires<00:00:46.059> here

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:46.480 
is and then there's two black wires here

00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:48.900 
is and then there's two black wires here
this<00:00:46.749> goes<00:00:46.989> to<00:00:47.230> a<00:00:47.260> heater<00:00:47.589> simulator<00:00:48.219> so<00:00:48.820> in

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:48.910 
this goes to a heater simulator so in

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:51.029 
this goes to a heater simulator so in
case<00:00:49.059> you<00:00:49.179> have<00:00:49.300> a<00:00:49.329> heated<00:00:49.719> o2<00:00:49.870> sensor<00:00:50.649> then

00:00:51.029 --> 00:00:51.039 
case you have a heated o2 sensor then

00:00:51.039 --> 00:00:53.729 
case you have a heated o2 sensor then
this<00:00:51.760> will<00:00:51.999> take<00:00:52.210> care<00:00:52.359> of<00:00:52.480> that<00:00:52.570> as<00:00:52.780> well<00:00:52.960> so

00:00:53.729 --> 00:00:53.739 
this will take care of that as well so

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:55.889 
this will take care of that as well so
it<00:00:54.039> does<00:00:54.280> both<00:00:54.460> passive<00:00:54.999> and<00:00:55.179> heated<00:00:55.570> o2

00:00:55.889 --> 00:00:55.899 
it does both passive and heated o2

00:00:55.899 --> 00:00:58.049 
it does both passive and heated o2
sensors<00:00:56.320> in<00:00:56.499> the<00:00:56.589> same<00:00:56.800> package<00:00:57.070> which<00:00:57.850> is<00:00:58.030> a

00:00:58.049 --> 00:00:58.059 
sensors in the same package which is a

00:00:58.059 --> 00:00:59.759 
sensors in the same package which is a
lot<00:00:58.210> more<00:00:58.390> convenient<00:00:58.780> than<00:00:59.079> other<00:00:59.230> options

00:00:59.759 --> 00:00:59.769 
lot more convenient than other options

00:00:59.769 --> 00:01:01.470 
lot more convenient than other options
which<00:01:00.069> you<00:01:00.100> would<00:01:00.339> have<00:01:00.489> to<00:01:00.609> buy<00:01:00.760> two<00:01:00.819> discreet

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:01.480 
which you would have to buy two discreet

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:05.610 
which you would have to buy two discreet
packages<00:01:02.050> for<00:01:03.120> the<00:01:04.120> signal<00:01:04.600> lines<00:01:04.809> there<00:01:05.290> are

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:05.620 
packages for the signal lines there are

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:08.670 
packages for the signal lines there are
a<00:01:05.680> blue<00:01:06.430> and<00:01:06.640> a<00:01:06.700> white<00:01:06.880> line<00:01:07.240> this<00:01:07.750> is<00:01:08.020> blue<00:01:08.530> and

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:08.680 
a blue and a white line this is blue and

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.210 
a blue and a white line this is blue and
white<00:01:08.860> because<00:01:09.190> I<00:01:09.970> Drive<00:01:10.570> a<00:01:10.600> WRX<00:01:11.470> and<00:01:11.770> these

white because I Drive a WRX and these

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:14.820 
white because I Drive a WRX and these
are<00:01:12.370> the<00:01:12.460> colors<00:01:12.640> in<00:01:12.970> my<00:01:13.090> other<00:01:13.270> three<00:01:13.450> WRX<00:01:14.080> so

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:14.830 
are the colors in my other three WRX so

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:16.800 
are the colors in my other three WRX so
the<00:01:14.950> signal<00:01:15.340> line<00:01:15.520> is<00:01:15.790> the<00:01:16.000> blue<00:01:16.210> line<00:01:16.479> then

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:16.810 
the signal line is the blue line then

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:19.980 
the signal line is the blue line then
the<00:01:17.130> the<00:01:18.130> ground<00:01:18.430> reference<00:01:18.759> is<00:01:19.299> the<00:01:19.780> white

00:01:19.980 --> 00:01:19.990 
the the ground reference is the white

00:01:19.990 --> 00:01:22.319 
the the ground reference is the white
line<00:01:20.259> here<00:01:20.290> and<00:01:20.799> the<00:01:21.579> signal<00:01:21.880> that<00:01:21.969> comes<00:01:22.119> out

00:01:22.319 --> 00:01:22.329 
line here and the signal that comes out

00:01:22.329 --> 00:01:25.230 
line here and the signal that comes out
of<00:01:22.360> the<00:01:22.630> mimics<00:01:23.049> vo2<00:01:23.590> sensor<00:01:24.100> signal<00:01:24.549> that<00:01:25.119> you

00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:25.240 
of the mimics vo2 sensor signal that you

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:27.179 
of the mimics vo2 sensor signal that you
would<00:01:25.360> see<00:01:25.600> and<00:01:25.899> expect<00:01:26.380> in<00:01:26.619> a<00:01:26.740> normally

00:01:27.179 --> 00:01:27.189 
would see and expect in a normally

00:01:27.189 --> 00:01:31.350 
would see and expect in a normally
operating<00:01:28.049> obd2<00:01:29.049> system<00:01:29.909> without<00:01:30.909> a<00:01:30.939> turbo

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:31.360 
operating obd2 system without a turbo

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.289 
operating obd2 system without a turbo
back<00:01:31.630> or<00:01:32.020> without<00:01:32.280> an<00:01:33.280> exhaust<00:01:33.640> system<00:01:33.759> put<00:01:34.180> on

00:01:34.289 --> 00:01:34.299 
back or without an exhaust system put on

00:01:34.299 --> 00:01:36.630 
back or without an exhaust system put on
the<00:01:34.420> car<00:01:34.630> so<00:01:35.289> let's<00:01:35.439> take<00:01:35.680> a<00:01:35.710> look<00:01:35.920> at<00:01:36.159> what<00:01:36.399> the

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:36.640 
the car so let's take a look at what the

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:38.880 
the car so let's take a look at what the
signal<00:01:37.450> looks<00:01:37.600> like<00:01:37.840> coming<00:01:38.170> out<00:01:38.320> of<00:01:38.469> this<00:01:38.619> so

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:38.890 
signal looks like coming out of this so

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:40.080 
signal looks like coming out of this so
that<00:01:39.039> you<00:01:39.130> have<00:01:39.280> a<00:01:39.310> feel<00:01:39.579> for<00:01:39.610> what<00:01:39.939> it's

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:40.090 
that you have a feel for what it's

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:41.940 
that you have a feel for what it's
actually<00:01:40.240> doing<00:01:40.780> and<00:01:40.960> then<00:01:41.439> I'll<00:01:41.560> explain<00:01:41.890> a

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:41.950 
actually doing and then I'll explain a

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:43.920 
actually doing and then I'll explain a
little<00:01:42.039> bit<00:01:42.310> about<00:01:42.460> how<00:01:42.880> the<00:01:42.939> oxygen<00:01:43.270> sensors

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:43.930 
little bit about how the oxygen sensors

00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:47.130 
little bit about how the oxygen sensors
working<00:01:44.200> and<00:01:44.619> what<00:01:44.890> this<00:01:45.039> does<00:01:45.340> to<00:01:46.140> replace

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:47.140 
working and what this does to replace

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.679 
working and what this does to replace
the<00:01:47.350> oxygen<00:01:47.439> sensor<00:01:48.159> with<00:01:48.820> respect<00:01:49.270> to<00:01:49.509> the

00:01:49.679 --> 00:01:49.689 
the oxygen sensor with respect to the

00:01:49.689 --> 00:01:54.569 
the oxygen sensor with respect to the
ECU<00:01:50.350> in<00:01:50.590> the<00:01:50.680> car<00:01:52.140> okay<00:01:53.140> so<00:01:53.740> I'm<00:01:54.039> going<00:01:54.310> to<00:01:54.340> hook

00:01:54.569 --> 00:01:54.579 
ECU in the car okay so I'm going to hook

00:01:54.579 --> 00:01:57.060 
ECU in the car okay so I'm going to hook
up<00:01:54.789> now<00:01:55.030> to<00:01:55.090> the<00:01:55.659> reference<00:01:56.380> which<00:01:56.740> is<00:01:56.770> the

00:01:57.060 --> 00:01:57.070 
up now to the reference which is the

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:00.539 
up now to the reference which is the
white<00:01:57.250> on<00:01:57.520> this<00:01:57.840> and<00:01:58.840> the<00:01:59.590> blue<00:01:59.799> which<00:02:00.189> is<00:02:00.219> the

00:02:00.539 --> 00:02:00.549 
white on this and the blue which is the

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:03.510 
white on this and the blue which is the
signal<00:02:01.439> and<00:02:02.439> we're<00:02:02.770> going<00:02:02.890> to<00:02:02.950> take<00:02:03.100> a<00:02:03.130> look<00:02:03.399> at

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:03.520 
signal and we're going to take a look at

00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:04.859 
signal and we're going to take a look at
what<00:02:03.640> this<00:02:03.789> looks<00:02:03.850> like<00:02:04.179> over<00:02:04.630> on<00:02:04.719> the

00:02:04.859 --> 00:02:04.869 
what this looks like over on the

00:02:04.869 --> 00:02:10.740 
what this looks like over on the
oscilloscope<00:02:08.640> so<00:02:09.640> we'll<00:02:10.119> be<00:02:10.240> looking<00:02:10.390> at<00:02:10.690> what

00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:10.750 
oscilloscope so we'll be looking at what

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:13.320 
oscilloscope so we'll be looking at what
the<00:02:11.040> ECU<00:02:12.040> is<00:02:12.250> actually<00:02:12.580> seeing<00:02:12.880> from<00:02:13.120> this

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
the ECU is actually seeing from this

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:15.510 
the ECU is actually seeing from this
thing<00:02:13.600> and<00:02:13.960> then<00:02:14.200> you'll<00:02:14.380> understand<00:02:14.890> what

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:15.520 
thing and then you'll understand what

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:17.970 
thing and then you'll understand what
it's<00:02:15.640> doing<00:02:16.000> so<00:02:16.320> more<00:02:17.320> comfortable<00:02:17.740> without

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:17.980 
it's doing so more comfortable without

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:19.710 
it's doing so more comfortable without
to<00:02:18.160> work<00:02:18.280> so<00:02:18.460> what<00:02:18.670> we're<00:02:18.910> looking<00:02:18.940> at<00:02:19.330> here<00:02:19.600> on

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:19.720 
to work so what we're looking at here on

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:21.479 
to work so what we're looking at here on
the<00:02:19.810> oscilloscope<00:02:20.230> is<00:02:20.680> we're<00:02:21.040> looking<00:02:21.099> at<00:02:21.370> the

00:02:21.479 --> 00:02:21.489 
the oscilloscope is we're looking at the

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:24.630 
the oscilloscope is we're looking at the
output<00:02:21.909> of<00:02:21.940> that<00:02:22.330> circuit<00:02:23.129> the<00:02:24.129> output<00:02:24.459> of<00:02:24.519> the

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:24.640 
output of that circuit the output of the

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:25.300 
output of that circuit the output of the
signal

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
signal

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:29.170 
signal
and<00:02:25.550> you<00:02:26.480> can<00:02:26.660> see<00:02:26.840> it<00:02:26.990> goes<00:02:27.230> from<00:02:28.180> between

00:02:29.170 --> 00:02:29.180 
and you can see it goes from between

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.770 
and you can see it goes from between
zero<00:02:29.510> in<00:02:29.870> about<00:02:30.530> 28<00:02:31.010> volts<00:02:31.520> or<00:02:31.730> 0.9<00:02:32.180> volts<00:02:32.209> and

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:32.780 
zero in about 28 volts or 0.9 volts and

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.830 
zero in about 28 volts or 0.9 volts and
this<00:02:33.740> really<00:02:34.220> mimics<00:02:34.610> the<00:02:34.880> zero<00:02:35.150> crossings

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
this really mimics the zero crossings

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.690 
this really mimics the zero crossings
that<00:02:36.050> you'll<00:02:36.170> see<00:02:36.410> in<00:02:36.560> an<00:02:36.680> oxygen<00:02:37.190> sensor<00:02:37.370> you

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
that you'll see in an oxygen sensor you

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.610 
that you'll see in an oxygen sensor you
can<00:02:37.850> see<00:02:38.000> you<00:02:38.090> got<00:02:38.240> you<00:02:38.690> have<00:02:38.840> the<00:02:38.990> zero<00:02:39.230> right

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:39.620 
can see you got you have the zero right

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.440 
can see you got you have the zero right
here<00:02:39.920> which<00:02:40.130> is<00:02:40.310> the<00:02:40.490> trigger<00:02:40.760> on<00:02:40.850> my<00:02:41.120> scope

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450 
here which is the trigger on my scope

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:45.790 
here which is the trigger on my scope
but<00:02:42.319> this<00:02:43.250> is<00:02:43.550> a<00:02:43.580> simulating<00:02:44.500> basically<00:02:45.500> where

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:45.800 
but this is a simulating basically where

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:49.420 
but this is a simulating basically where
the<00:02:45.950> zero<00:02:46.220> would<00:02:46.459> be<00:02:47.290> as<00:02:48.290> far<00:02:48.560> as<00:02:48.739> the<00:02:48.920> ECU<00:02:49.370> is

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:49.430 
the zero would be as far as the ECU is

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:51.820 
the zero would be as far as the ECU is
concerned<00:02:49.880> what<00:02:50.209> the<00:02:50.330> ECU<00:02:50.660> is<00:02:50.690> doing<00:02:51.260> with

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:51.830 
concerned what the ECU is doing with

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:53.770 
concerned what the ECU is doing with
this<00:02:52.010> rear<00:02:52.220> oxygen<00:02:52.760> sensors<00:02:53.150> it's<00:02:53.390> counting

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780 
this rear oxygen sensors it's counting

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:56.260 
this rear oxygen sensors it's counting
the<00:02:53.900> zero<00:02:54.140> crossings<00:02:54.860> and<00:02:55.100> it<00:02:55.550> expects<00:02:56.150> these

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:56.270 
the zero crossings and it expects these

00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:58.600 
the zero crossings and it expects these
zero<00:02:56.600> crossings<00:02:57.260> where<00:02:57.560> this<00:02:57.739> line<00:02:58.040> goes<00:02:58.370> up

00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:58.610 
zero crossings where this line goes up

00:02:58.610 --> 00:03:03.400 
zero crossings where this line goes up
in<00:02:58.850> the<00:02:58.970> signal<00:02:59.360> it<00:02:59.570> expects<00:03:00.410> that<00:03:00.650> to<00:03:00.980> be<00:03:01.660> at<00:03:02.660> a

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:03.410 
in the signal it expects that to be at a

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:05.830 
in the signal it expects that to be at a
lower<00:03:03.830> frequency<00:03:04.160> than<00:03:04.730> the<00:03:05.209> front<00:03:05.450> o<00:03:05.600> two

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:05.840 
lower frequency than the front o two

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.140 
lower frequency than the front o two
sensor<00:03:06.260> so<00:03:06.739> it<00:03:06.890> compares<00:03:07.310> the<00:03:07.550> two<00:03:07.580> it<00:03:07.970> does

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:08.150 
sensor so it compares the two it does

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:10.660 
sensor so it compares the two it does
zero<00:03:08.870> crossing<00:03:09.440> counts<00:03:09.830> and<00:03:10.010> then<00:03:10.250> compares

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:10.670 
zero crossing counts and then compares

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:13.270 
zero crossing counts and then compares
them<00:03:10.940> to<00:03:11.120> identify<00:03:11.989> which<00:03:12.260> is<00:03:12.410> greater<00:03:12.739> in<00:03:13.100> the

00:03:13.270 --> 00:03:13.280 
them to identify which is greater in the

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.490 
them to identify which is greater in the
rear<00:03:13.459> should<00:03:13.760> be<00:03:13.880> of<00:03:14.060> less<00:03:14.510> than<00:03:14.930> the<00:03:15.170> front

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:15.500 
rear should be of less than the front

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:20.430 
rear should be of less than the front
the<00:03:16.250> suspects<00:03:17.000> and<00:03:17.180> no<00:03:17.480> three<00:03:18.200> WRX<00:03:19.010> wagon<00:03:19.670> and

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:20.440 
the suspects and no three WRX wagon and

00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:23.199 
the suspects and no three WRX wagon and
I<00:03:21.440> do<00:03:21.709> a<00:03:21.800> whole<00:03:22.069> lotta<00:03:22.280> off-roading<00:03:22.790> in<00:03:23.060> this

00:03:23.199 --> 00:03:23.209 
I do a whole lotta off-roading in this

00:03:23.209 --> 00:03:26.259 
I do a whole lotta off-roading in this
thing<00:03:23.480> you<00:03:23.900> know<00:03:24.080> so<00:03:24.590> I've<00:03:25.550> got<00:03:25.790> to<00:03:25.940> have<00:03:25.970> my

00:03:26.259 --> 00:03:26.269 
thing you know so I've got to have my

00:03:26.269 --> 00:03:29.500 
thing you know so I've got to have my
other<00:03:26.450> two<00:03:26.660> sensor<00:03:27.110> simulator<00:03:27.350> and<00:03:28.269> I'm<00:03:29.269> gonna

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:29.510 
other two sensor simulator and I'm gonna

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:31.120 
other two sensor simulator and I'm gonna
try<00:03:29.780> and<00:03:29.959> take<00:03:30.110> a<00:03:30.170> look<00:03:30.410> at<00:03:30.530> it<00:03:30.650> right<00:03:30.769> here<00:03:30.829> in

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:31.130 
try and take a look at it right here in

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:33.039 
try and take a look at it right here in
the<00:03:31.220> dark<00:03:31.430> before<00:03:31.700> I<00:03:31.880> start<00:03:32.209> the<00:03:32.329> car<00:03:32.360> it's<00:03:32.840> a

00:03:33.039 --> 00:03:33.049 
the dark before I start the car it's a

00:03:33.049 --> 00:03:35.350 
the dark before I start the car it's a
little<00:03:33.290> dim<00:03:33.560> but<00:03:34.459> you<00:03:34.579> can<00:03:34.730> see<00:03:34.910> it<00:03:35.000> there<00:03:35.209> on

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:35.360 
little dim but you can see it there on

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:36.940 
little dim but you can see it there on
the<00:03:35.390> floor<00:03:35.720> I<00:03:36.019> pulled<00:03:36.470> it<00:03:36.560> in<00:03:36.680> through<00:03:36.860> the

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:36.950 
the floor I pulled it in through the

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:39.880 
the floor I pulled it in through the
firewall<00:03:37.489> so<00:03:38.030> that<00:03:38.440> it<00:03:39.440> didn't<00:03:39.769> need

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:39.890 
firewall so that it didn't need

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:42.069 
firewall so that it didn't need
passenger<00:03:40.430> cabin<00:03:40.880> so<00:03:41.420> that<00:03:41.450> we<00:03:41.660> can<00:03:41.810> take<00:03:41.959> an

00:03:42.069 --> 00:03:42.079 
passenger cabin so that we can take an

00:03:42.079 --> 00:03:44.470 
passenger cabin so that we can take an
easy<00:03:42.290> look<00:03:42.530> at<00:03:42.739> it<00:03:42.890> but<00:03:43.100> usually<00:03:43.280> it's<00:03:44.120> sitting

00:03:44.470 --> 00:03:44.480 
easy look at it but usually it's sitting

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:45.910 
easy look at it but usually it's sitting
underneath<00:03:44.750> the<00:03:44.989> hood<00:03:45.140> so<00:03:45.440> I'll<00:03:45.530> start<00:03:45.829> the

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:45.920 
underneath the hood so I'll start the

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:55.820 
underneath the hood so I'll start the
car

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:55.830 

00:03:55.830 --> 00:03:59.540 

well<00:03:56.370> that's<00:03:57.120> pretty<00:03:57.330> neat<00:03:57.930> but<00:03:58.800> what<00:03:59.190> mixin

00:03:59.540 --> 00:03:59.550 
well that's pretty neat but what mixin

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:02.380 
well that's pretty neat but what mixin
must<00:03:59.790> needs<00:04:00.060> is<00:04:00.330> the<00:04:00.450> fact<00:04:00.690> that<00:04:00.780> it<00:04:00.990> has<00:04:01.170> these

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:02.390 
must needs is the fact that it has these

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:06.260 
must needs is the fact that it has these
8200<00:04:03.390> K<00:04:03.690> white<00:04:04.110> LEDs<00:04:04.680> that's<00:04:05.430> two<00:04:05.730> of<00:04:05.760> them<00:04:06.060> in

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:06.270 
8200 K white LEDs that's two of them in

00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:08.630 
8200 K white LEDs that's two of them in
one<00:04:06.510> of<00:04:06.600> the<00:04:06.720> Blake's<00:04:07.020> and<00:04:07.320> we<00:04:08.100> also<00:04:08.280> have<00:04:08.610> a

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:08.640 
one of the Blake's and we also have a

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:11.450 
one of the Blake's and we also have a
very<00:04:09.570> important<00:04:10.080> feature<00:04:10.260> of<00:04:10.620> having<00:04:10.890> an<00:04:11.160> o2
