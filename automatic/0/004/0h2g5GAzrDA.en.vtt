00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:39.800 
charge from the balance plug and it

00:01:39.800 --> 00:01:42.340 
charge from the balance plug and it
cleans<00:01:40.040> up<00:01:40.220> the<00:01:40.370> inside<00:01:40.730> of<00:01:40.880> the<00:01:41.030> radio<00:01:41.350> just

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:43.430 
mean positive and negative and what I'm
gonna<00:02:39.310> do<00:02:39.519> is<00:02:39.760> just<00:02:40.440> connect<00:02:41.440> it<00:02:41.590> like<00:02:41.819> that

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:43.440 
gonna do is just connect it like that

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:50.640 
gonna do is just connect it like that
and<00:02:44.730> then<00:02:46.260> this<00:02:47.260> will<00:02:47.560> plug<00:02:47.829> in<00:02:48.069> like<00:02:48.579> so<00:02:49.650> and

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:50.650 
and then this will plug in like so and

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:54.629 
and then this will plug in like so and
it<00:02:50.920> should<00:02:51.190> not<00:02:52.030> about<00:02:52.329> power<00:02:53.109> the<00:02:53.290> radio<00:02:53.709> so

00:02:54.629 --> 00:02:54.639 
it should not about power the radio so

00:02:54.639 --> 00:02:56.089 
it should not about power the radio so
right<00:02:54.849> now<00:02:55.000> I'm<00:02:55.150> gonna<00:02:55.269> do<00:02:55.480> that

00:02:56.089 --> 00:02:56.099 
right now I'm gonna do that

00:02:56.099 --> 00:02:59.369 
right now I'm gonna do that
okay<00:02:57.099> so<00:02:57.970> we<00:02:58.420> get<00:02:58.540> everything<00:02:58.720> hooked<00:02:58.989> up<00:02:59.200> and

00:02:59.369 --> 00:02:59.379 
okay so we get everything hooked up and

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:02.280 
okay so we get everything hooked up and
everything<00:02:59.650> connected<00:02:59.829> I<00:03:00.780> had<00:03:01.780> to<00:03:01.870> remove<00:03:02.109> the

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
everything connected I had to remove the

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:04.369 
everything connected I had to remove the
piece<00:03:02.470> of<00:03:02.500> foam<00:03:02.829> that's<00:03:03.069> on<00:03:03.190> the<00:03:03.280> bottom<00:03:03.579> there

00:03:04.369 --> 00:03:04.379 
piece of foam that's on the bottom there

00:03:04.379 --> 00:03:06.569 
piece of foam that's on the bottom there
because<00:03:05.379> of<00:03:05.530> the<00:03:05.650> thickness<00:03:06.010> of<00:03:06.129> the<00:03:06.250> battery

00:03:06.569 --> 00:03:06.579 
because of the thickness of the battery

00:03:06.579 --> 00:03:08.250 
because of the thickness of the battery
I'm<00:03:07.000> not<00:03:07.209> gonna<00:03:07.359> cut<00:03:07.599> that<00:03:07.750> I'm<00:03:07.870> gonna<00:03:07.989> save

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:08.260 
I'm not gonna cut that I'm gonna save

00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:11.309 
I'm not gonna cut that I'm gonna save
that<00:03:08.579> but<00:03:09.579> I'm<00:03:10.209> just<00:03:10.359> gonna<00:03:10.569> put<00:03:10.930> the<00:03:11.019> water<00:03:11.200> is

00:03:11.309 --> 00:03:11.319 
that but I'm just gonna put the water is

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:13.199 
that but I'm just gonna put the water is
down<00:03:11.470> here<00:03:11.739> and<00:03:12.159> the<00:03:12.340> back<00:03:12.519> should<00:03:12.790> slide<00:03:13.060> on

00:03:13.199 --> 00:03:13.209 
down here and the back should slide on

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:19.830 
down here and the back should slide on
without<00:03:13.359> any<00:03:13.659> problems<00:03:14.079> okay<00:03:18.329> so<00:03:19.329> the<00:03:19.599> backs

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:19.840 
without any problems okay so the backs

00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:29.369 
without any problems okay so the backs
on<00:03:24.989> turn<00:03:25.989> the<00:03:26.109> sign<00:03:26.349> we<00:03:26.590> should<00:03:26.829> be<00:03:27.900> 8.4<00:03:28.900> volts

00:03:29.369 --> 00:03:29.379 
on turn the sign we should be 8.4 volts

00:03:29.379 --> 00:03:42.080 
on turn the sign we should be 8.4 volts
which<00:03:29.620> will<00:03:29.829> be<00:03:29.949> a<00:03:29.980> fully<00:03:30.370> charged

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:42.090 

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:46.409 

okay<00:03:43.199> so<00:03:44.199> we<00:03:44.379> had<00:03:44.500> of<00:03:44.590> 8.3<00:03:45.090> which<00:03:46.090> was<00:03:46.239> right

00:03:46.409 --> 00:03:46.419 
okay so we had of 8.3 which was right

00:03:46.419 --> 00:03:49.159 
okay so we had of 8.3 which was right
around<00:03:46.510> where<00:03:46.959> we're<00:03:47.109> supposed<00:03:47.199> to<00:03:47.410> be<00:03:47.470> of<00:03:48.010> 8.4

00:03:49.159 --> 00:03:49.169 
around where we're supposed to be of 8.4

00:03:49.169 --> 00:03:51.659 
around where we're supposed to be of 8.4
and<00:03:50.169> it<00:03:50.530> looks<00:03:50.680> like<00:03:50.769> it's<00:03:50.949> reading<00:03:51.220> just<00:03:51.430> fine

00:03:51.659 --> 00:03:51.669 
and it looks like it's reading just fine

00:03:51.669 --> 00:03:53.129 
and it looks like it's reading just fine
fully<00:03:51.970> charged<00:03:52.299> that's<00:03:52.569> the<00:03:52.660> highest<00:03:52.840> I've

00:03:53.129 --> 00:03:53.139 
fully charged that's the highest I've

00:03:53.139 --> 00:03:56.129 
fully charged that's the highest I've
ever<00:03:53.290> seen<00:03:53.500> the<00:03:53.680> battery<00:03:54.280> indicator<00:03:54.489> go<00:03:55.139> so

00:03:56.129 --> 00:03:56.139 
ever seen the battery indicator go so

00:03:56.139 --> 00:04:00.170 
ever seen the battery indicator go so
what<00:03:56.260> I'm<00:03:56.349> gonna<00:03:56.440> do<00:03:56.650> is<00:03:56.859> turn<00:03:57.129> this<00:03:57.250> off

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:07.289

we're<00:04:23.380> going<00:04:23.500> to<00:04:23.560> change<00:04:23.830> this

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:24.880 
we're going to change this

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:30.090 
we're going to change this
-<00:04:25.450> let's<00:04:26.170> say<00:04:27.960> change<00:04:28.960> this<00:04:29.140> to<00:04:29.350> seven<00:04:29.800> point

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:30.100 
- let's say change this to seven point

00:04:30.100 --> 00:04:35.370 
- let's say change this to seven point
four<00:04:32.520> five<00:04:33.520> to<00:04:33.730> six<00:04:34.060> is<00:04:34.240> a<00:04:34.270> heist<00:04:34.570> it'll<00:04:35.230> go

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:35.380 
four five to six is a heist it'll go

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:37.640 
four five to six is a heist it'll go
let's<00:04:35.620> see<00:04:35.740> if<00:04:35.830> we<00:04:35.890> can<00:04:36.010> change<00:04:36.220> this<00:04:36.370> to<00:04:36.430> lipo

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:37.650 
let's see if we can change this to lipo

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:39.000 
let's see if we can change this to lipo
well<00:04:38.650> there<00:04:38.770> we<00:04:38.860> go

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:39.010 
well there we go

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:40.680 
well there we go
six<00:04:39.310> point<00:04:39.520> four<00:04:39.730> I'll<00:04:39.970> actually<00:04:40.210> crank<00:04:40.540> that

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:40.690 
six point four I'll actually crank that

00:04:40.690 --> 00:04:43.590 
six point four I'll actually crank that
up<00:04:40.750> a<00:04:40.930> little<00:04:41.020> bit<00:04:41.170> if<00:04:41.290> it<00:04:41.410> lets<00:04:41.590> me<00:04:42.360> six<00:04:43.360> point

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:43.600 
up a little bit if it lets me six point

00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:47.190 
up a little bit if it lets me six point
six<00:04:43.930> that<00:04:44.470> would<00:04:44.620> be<00:04:44.770> about<00:04:45.720> 3.3<00:04:46.720> volts<00:04:47.050> per

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:47.200 
six that would be about 3.3 volts per

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:55.680 
six that would be about 3.3 volts per
cell<00:04:48.390> that's<00:04:49.390> pretty<00:04:49.630> good<00:04:54.390> and<00:04:55.390> then<00:04:55.600> we're

00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:55.690 
cell that's pretty good and then we're

00:04:55.690 --> 00:05:03.990 
cell that's pretty good and then we're
gonna<00:04:55.780> hit<00:04:55.960> next<00:04:59.040> and<00:05:00.040> back<00:05:00.370> to<00:05:00.550> list<00:05:02.820> go<00:05:03.820> back

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:04.000 
gonna hit next and back to list go back

00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:10.470 
gonna hit next and back to list go back
and<00:05:04.120> make<00:05:04.210> sure<00:05:04.240> it<00:05:04.450> saved<00:05:04.690> it<00:05:06.300> we<00:05:07.300> did<00:05:09.480> thanks

00:05:10.470 --> 00:05:10.480 
and make sure it saved it we did thanks

00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:15.840 
and make sure it saved it we did thanks
to<00:05:10.510> the<00:05:10.600> main<00:05:10.720> screen<00:05:10.990> and<00:05:13.440> that's<00:05:14.440> it<00:05:14.680> so<00:05:15.670> we

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:15.850 
to the main screen and that's it so we

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:21.390 
to the main screen and that's it so we
just<00:05:15.880> converted<00:05:17.250> our<00:05:18.250> dx8<00:05:18.910> over<00:05:19.360> to<00:05:19.600> a<00:05:20.400> much

00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:21.400 
just converted our dx8 over to a much

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:23.750 
just converted our dx8 over to a much
much<00:05:22.120> cheaper

00:05:23.750 --> 00:05:23.760 
much cheaper

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:27.090 
much cheaper
