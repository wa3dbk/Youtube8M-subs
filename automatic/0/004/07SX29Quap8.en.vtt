00:00:00.009 --> 00:00:03.090
 we'll play a release I guess you're relatively disappointed the 

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:03.500
 better 

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:06.670
 a first half already give us credit transfers 

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:08.719
 yes we assume it would be unless 

00:00:08.719 --> 00:00:12.119
 1- because on the one hand we are no longer in the race but that would be almost 

00:00:12.119 --> 00:00:15.660
 secondary one must first think you just tell guillaume who has him 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:19.119
 still suffered a pretty big shock that is currently in the hospital 

00:00:20.089 --> 00:00:21.789
 but if we feared a little bit 

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:26.119
 the shock with deduced side effects a little titan bet 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:29.439
 time finally when it turns out this morning for now we can also a little 

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:33.120
 little less disturbing than it could be at the time of the shock there I wait 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.690
 a little bit of fresh news his wife went to see 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:37.480
 the hospital so we will know 

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:41.740
 by getting as close as you can how to put the roads 

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:46.950
 and then if we consider a vacation especially robien 6% and all 

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.360
 operations and made mans not there little news including a small hour 

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:54.880
 what really happened to complain that he was serene about the 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:56.080
 track 

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:58.640
 swift in trouble some bridges% 

00:00:58.640 --> 00:01:01.130
 the first fall that took him 

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:04.530
 just before percent were still not a little annoying 

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:07.020
 mechanically speaking we had to change a lot of things in front of 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:10.460
 behind a little bit everywhere hegenheim in contact our part after 

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:14.790
 the best a rare motorcycle mount this way one is always very careful and 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.800
 then there is not really a siding but I wanted him to tell me why 

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:21.330
 wait a little bit he had a little worry so at the entrance of the green turn 

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:25.310
 which caused him a little bit of taking the the aisles and in 

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.470
 back on the track and that's not it happened as it should have 

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:31.370
 so it's a little bit silly the web is a little bit everything 

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:32.480
 stupid 

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:35.070
 urko a lot more silly and then and then following 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:36.330
 and less funny 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:39.550
 the rest we are certainly for this second act in the cap 

00:01:40.490 --> 00:01:43.360
 for now we thought a little full powers a little bit how we 

00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:46.849
 also makes it funny to see what he does not want to be able to do 

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:51.220
 and then considering all this to the motorcycle rider a little bit of worry 

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:53.130
 of her right now it's a bit difficult 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:56.630
 he will consider the rest of the season also be overcome I am motivated 

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:59.660
 we are always happy that everything is going well for the state 

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:03.480
 for men after the restaurant we get to find the motivation and then 

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:07.350
 if all this is well together so much good track in the seat continue 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.990
 ferrals of plate maybe suzuka and make the whole season a little 

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:13.549
 prognosis for the race 

00:02:13.549 --> 00:02:16.089
 when I think that his ancestor 

00:02:16.089 --> 00:02:19.589
 a bad language I think the year the positions how this 

00:02:19.589 --> 00:02:23.339
 to establish a little bit I say not aware in the routine a household 

00:02:23.339 --> 00:02:26.069
 believe immediately the center-forward laon-zola a little 

00:02:26.069 --> 00:02:29.810
 this is one of the small worries of heating and therefore of the motor heater the a11 

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:31.469
 priori it's going well 

00:02:31.469 --> 00:02:35.009
 I should touch wood jail when we say that of my bike I do not like it 

00:02:35.009 --> 00:02:38.179
 but the mayor labellers during the requested flights he has almost established 

00:02:38.819 --> 00:02:43.039
 at least in the role of dude plateau except incident except man I 

00:02:43.039 --> 00:02:46.039
 think it'll stay like this 

00:02:51.069 --> 00:02:52.219
 the best way to move forward
