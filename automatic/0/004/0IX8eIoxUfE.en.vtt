00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.289
 supported devices and so now 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.410

 try to upgrade to windows 10 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.489
 put on your smartphone and see 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:45.739
 what's the result well and actually 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:45.739
 that's about it today and will be discussed 

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:59.030
 the first thing I strongly recommend to you 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:01.430
 do before installing windows 10 

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:03.769
 update is a backup of your smartphone 

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:06.340
 save all important and necessary data 

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:08.540
 before you install anything 

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:12.049
 copy everything you need to do 

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:14.299
 backup and only after that 

00:01:12.049 --> 00:01:16.580
 start installing windows 10 

00:01:14.299 --> 00:01:19.759
 before installing windows 10 strongly 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:21.950
 it is recommended to charge the smartphone yes yes to 

00:01:19.759 --> 00:01:22.490
 stop up to 100 percent either charge and 

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.130
 at least 

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:27.619
 over 50 percent and leave on 

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:29.780
 charging so what do we need to 

00:01:27.619 --> 00:01:31.990
 install windows 10 on your smartphone well 

00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:34.220
 Firstly of course the update and 

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:36.080
 ability to install windows 10 on your 

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:37.850
 smartphone should be a complete list 

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:41.330
 supported devices you can find 

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:41.929
 on microsoft site but i think i will post 

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:46.119

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:54.250
 entering the store and looking for an application 

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:56.450

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:01.250
 Mac users launched the so-called 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:03.440

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:09.020
 I already told the laptop now 

00:02:07.179 --> 00:02:11.599
 there is a similar program for 

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:13.900
 smartphones and let's install the right one 

00:02:11.599 --> 00:02:13.900

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:27.370
 that will make you and so we download 

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:28.750
 application install it and after 

00:02:27.370 --> 00:02:29.410
 installation we will need to this 

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:32.020
 attachment 

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:34.150

 installed windows insider additionally 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:44.739
 and so to get the preview version 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:47.940
 windows 10 for smartphones we need 

00:02:44.739 --> 00:02:47.940
 hit the gas while you loved 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:56.420
 next we will need to select a cycle 

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:58.459
 get updates insider words 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:03:01.040
 slow update cycle that is 

00:02:58.459 --> 00:03:06.440
 getting a more stable build either 

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:09.530
 insider fast well choose a word and click 

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:10.880
 further and we need to confirm our 

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:12.770
 consent you must understand that 

00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:15.850
 installing windows 10 is enough 

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:20.180
 risky system is still extremely raw this 

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:25.670
 assembly for it is not even complete 

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:29.300
 beta so you need to understand the whole 

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:32.050
 liability and possible risks and so 

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:32.050
 everything cool 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:38.180
 windows insider wrote us that everything 

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:42.519
 done and it will overload our 

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:45.230
 the device and so the smartphone rebooted 

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:48.410
 Now we go to the construction site and check 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:50.890

 during the installation of updates and receiving

 installation generally need to understand that 

00:05:33.009 --> 00:05:38.800
 the process is not fast and probably in an hour 

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:40.659
 may not be able to do everything in it 

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:42.520
 time your smartphone may be unavailable 

00:05:40.659 --> 00:05:46.539
 for calls so keep in mind that 

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:47.860

00:05:46.539 --> 00:05:49.300
 be late at night 

00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:52.930

 suddenly somewhere to run so no one will 

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:57.069

00:06:19.180 --> 00:06:22.480
 installing update winter enough 

00:06:20.890 --> 00:06:24.700
 much time since only 

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:28.300
 preparing to install it took somewhere 

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:28.990
 20 minutes well, now almost remains 

00:06:28.300 --> 00:06:31.210
 a little bit 

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:33.960

00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:43.690
 Immediately an update came to windows 10 

00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:48.910
 technical preview 

00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:51.250
 we installed it and everything is ready like this 

00:06:48.910 --> 00:06:53.190
 Now the desktop system looks 

00:06:51.250 --> 00:06:57.520
 changed a little 

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:58.740
 The list of applications is also several 

00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:00.640
 has changed 

00:06:58.740 --> 00:07:03.700
 something will probably be up to 

00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:06.220
 installed over time have flown away 

00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:08.350
 password and immediately after installing these 

00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:12.190
 things will have to be restored and so 

00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:16.210
 network fe connected some applications 

00:07:12.190 --> 00:07:19.500
 until there is a general difference 

00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:23.700
 innovations can already be seen 

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:27.400
 for example an updated notification center 

00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:29.770
 updated application list and so 

00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:31.510

00:07:29.770 --> 00:07:32.710
