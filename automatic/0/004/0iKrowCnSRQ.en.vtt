00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:09.270 
you open up minecraft the microbe java

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:12.890 
you open up minecraft the microbe java
file<00:03:09.620> would<00:03:10.620> an<00:03:10.920> archive<00:03:11.880> program<00:03:12.450> program

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:12.900 
file would an archive program program

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.860 
file would an archive program program
like<00:03:13.380> winrar<00:03:14.840> once<00:03:15.840> you<00:03:15.990> have<00:03:16.110> done<00:03:16.290> that

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:17.870 
like winrar once you have done that

00:03:17.870 --> 00:03:21.740 
like winrar once you have done that
first<00:03:18.870> thing<00:03:19.459> you<00:03:20.459> have<00:03:20.640> to<00:03:20.790> do<00:03:21.030> is<00:03:21.209> to<00:03:21.390> delete

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750 
first thing you have to do is to delete

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:25.790 
first thing you have to do is to delete
the<00:03:22.020> meta-inf<00:03:22.489> folder<00:03:24.200> so<00:03:25.200> you<00:03:25.260> delete<00:03:25.590> that

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:25.800 
the meta-inf folder so you delete that

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:28.759 
the meta-inf folder so you delete that
and<00:03:26.040> once<00:03:26.670> you<00:03:26.820> have<00:03:26.940> done<00:03:27.090> that<00:03:27.320> you<00:03:28.320> have<00:03:28.560> all

00:03:28.759 --> 00:03:28.769 
and once you have done that you have all

00:03:28.769 --> 00:03:34.370 
and once you have done that you have all
of<00:03:28.800> these<00:03:29.100> help<00:03:29.940> define<00:03:30.390> files<00:03:30.930> and<00:03:32.989> you<00:03:33.989> drag

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:34.380 
of these help define files and you drag

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:40.910 
of these help define files and you drag
them<00:03:34.620> into<00:03:34.920> here<00:03:36.800> okay<00:03:37.800> so<00:03:39.320> once<00:03:40.320> that<00:03:40.440> is<00:03:40.890> done

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:40.920 
them into here okay so once that is done

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:50.479 
them into here okay so once that is done
you<00:03:43.250> have<00:03:44.250> to<00:03:44.610> run<00:03:45.500> this<00:03:48.230> program<00:03:49.230> here<00:03:49.680> the

00:03:50.479 --> 00:03:50.489 
you have to run this program here the

00:03:50.489 --> 00:03:53.930 
you have to run this program here the
installer<00:03:51.709> but<00:03:52.709> before<00:03:53.280> you<00:03:53.580> run<00:03:53.790> the

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:53.940 
installer but before you run the

00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:55.699 
installer but before you run the
installer<00:03:54.239> it's<00:03:54.540> very<00:03:54.870> important<00:03:55.470> that<00:03:55.560> you

00:03:55.699 --> 00:03:55.709 
installer it's very important that you

00:03:55.709 --> 00:03:58.160 
installer it's very important that you
don't<00:03:56.040> have<00:03:56.220> minecraft<00:03:56.580> open<00:03:57.209> anywhere<00:03:57.660> not

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:58.170 
don't have minecraft open anywhere not

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:01.280 
don't have minecraft open anywhere not
even<00:03:58.230> this<00:03:58.680> window<00:03:59.280> here<00:03:59.780> so<00:04:00.780> then<00:04:00.959> you<00:04:01.080> run

00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:01.290 
even this window here so then you run

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:09.740 
even this window here so then you run
the<00:04:01.440> installer<00:04:03.260> and<00:04:07.730> you<00:04:08.730> if<00:04:09.330> you<00:04:09.540> have<00:04:09.720> a

00:04:09.740 --> 00:04:09.750 
the installer and you if you have a

00:04:09.750 --> 00:04:11.630 
the installer and you if you have a
custom<00:04:10.470> location<00:04:10.920> you<00:04:11.040> can<00:04:11.160> browse<00:04:11.400> to<00:04:11.610> that

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:11.640 
custom location you can browse to that

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:15.470 
custom location you can browse to that
or<00:04:12.600> else<00:04:12.720> you<00:04:12.959> just<00:04:13.400> hit<00:04:14.400> the<00:04:14.610> install<00:04:15.120> mods

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:15.480 
or else you just hit the install mods

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:20.719 
or else you just hit the install mods
and<00:04:16.910> it<00:04:17.910> should<00:04:18.120> be<00:04:18.299> working<00:04:19.519> once<00:04:20.519> its

00:04:20.719 --> 00:04:20.729 
and it should be working once its

00:04:20.729 --> 00:04:24.080 
and it should be working once its
installed<00:04:20.970> you<00:04:21.720> go<00:04:21.900> back<00:04:22.260> here<00:04:22.620> and<00:04:22.860> go<00:04:23.669> to<00:04:23.729> the

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:24.090 
installed you go back here and go to the

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:27.170 
installed you go back here and go to the
shader<00:04:24.900> you<00:04:25.140> downloaded<00:04:25.849> here<00:04:26.849> is<00:04:27.060> the

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.180 
shader you downloaded here is the

00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:32.540 
shader you downloaded here is the
default<00:04:27.570> shader<00:04:29.240> so<00:04:30.240> go<00:04:31.140> to<00:04:31.200> this<00:04:31.530> folder<00:04:31.770> here

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:32.550 
default shader so go to this folder here

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:34.730 
default shader so go to this folder here
and<00:04:32.640> you'll<00:04:33.060> have<00:04:33.210> these<00:04:33.420> files<00:04:33.660> so<00:04:34.500> once

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:34.740 
and you'll have these files so once

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:38.210 
and you'll have these files so once
again<00:04:34.890> we<00:04:35.370> open<00:04:35.700> up<00:04:35.790> the<00:04:36.120> minecraft<00:04:36.980> yawa<00:04:37.980> file

00:04:38.210 --> 00:04:38.220 
again we open up the minecraft yawa file

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:47.410 
again we open up the minecraft yawa file
and<00:04:41.360> once<00:04:42.360> you<00:04:42.540> have<00:04:42.690> installed<00:04:42.900> it<00:04:43.880> with<00:04:44.880> this

00:04:47.410 --> 00:04:47.420 

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:50.090 

installer<00:04:48.420> earlier<00:04:48.990> you<00:04:49.740> should<00:04:49.920> have<00:04:50.070> a

00:04:50.090 --> 00:04:50.100 
installer earlier you should have a

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:55.070 
installer earlier you should have a
folder<00:04:50.430> called<00:04:50.910> shaders<00:04:52.220> but<00:04:53.660> since<00:04:54.660> I<00:04:54.780> didn't

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:55.080 
folder called shaders but since I didn't

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:56.870 
folder called shaders but since I didn't
do<00:04:55.200> that<00:04:55.350> in<00:04:55.590> this<00:04:56.010> tutorial<00:04:56.220> I'll<00:04:56.700> just

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:56.880 
do that in this tutorial I'll just

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:01.550 
do that in this tutorial I'll just
create<00:04:57.300> a<00:04:57.330> folder<00:04:57.720> called<00:04:59.330> shaders<00:05:00.560> you

00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:01.560 
create a folder called shaders you

00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:03.740 
create a folder called shaders you
should<00:05:01.740> have<00:05:01.890> won<00:05:02.100> by<00:05:02.280> default<00:05:02.340> now<00:05:02.760> so<00:05:03.480> you<00:05:03.540> go

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:03.750 
should have won by default now so you go

00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:06.770 
should have won by default now so you go
into<00:05:03.990> the<00:05:04.140> shader<00:05:04.380> stroller<00:05:05.480> take<00:05:06.480> all<00:05:06.660> these

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:06.780 
into the shader stroller take all these

00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:09.280 
into the shader stroller take all these
files<00:05:07.110> and<00:05:07.560> you<00:05:07.650> drag<00:05:07.920> them<00:05:08.070> into<00:05:08.250> here<00:05:08.580> okay

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:09.290 
files and you drag them into here okay

00:05:09.290 --> 00:05:13.790 
files and you drag them into here okay
simple<00:05:10.290> as<00:05:10.380> that<00:05:10.410> now<00:05:12.170> you<00:05:13.170> close<00:05:13.440> everything

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:13.800 
simple as that now you close everything

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:19.720 
simple as that now you close everything
down<00:05:13.950> and<00:05:16.940> your<00:05:17.940> game<00:05:18.150> should<00:05:18.480> look<00:05:18.690> like<00:05:18.720> this

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:19.730 
down and your game should look like this

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:22.970 
down and your game should look like this
if<00:05:20.730> you<00:05:20.880> are<00:05:20.940> successful<00:05:21.330> it's<00:05:22.290> really<00:05:22.650> really
