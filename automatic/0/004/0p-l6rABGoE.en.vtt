00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:36.440
 Let's start with the video and me 

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:38.870
 wish you to be completely black 

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:40.610
 Let's start with the make up 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:43.100
 the make-up lasts especially long 

00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:45.230
 I set the timer on the t zone and 

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:47.210
 here I use a matchbox case 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:48.949
 on such a celebration many photos determined 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:51.219
 I'm using one here 

00:00:48.949 --> 00:00:53.359
 Foundation with a particularly low 

00:00:51.219 --> 00:00:55.070
 sun protection factor and the defended 

00:00:53.359 --> 00:00:57.760
 then with such a kabuki brush on the 

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:57.760
 whole face 

00:00:58.629 --> 00:01:03.019
 Spring is called hay fever for 

00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:05.149
 my eyes, I use the rings 

00:01:03.019 --> 00:01:06.619
 concealer of maybelline the distributing 

00:01:05.149 --> 00:01:09.130
 I then under my eye and knock 

00:01:06.619 --> 00:01:09.130
 the good one 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:14.390
 for the redness in the rest of the face 

00:01:12.829 --> 00:01:16.310
 I use the fit nikosia of 

00:01:14.390 --> 00:01:20.020
 maybelline and that defended around the 

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:20.020
 nose around and around the mouth 

00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:26.760
 so that the excess fat absorbed 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.620
 is here namely a cosmetic towel and 

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:30.810
 dab my whole face off and you 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:32.970
 See how much really on the team 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.770
 is left over and you need it all 

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:36.479
 not then I take such a whole 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.580
 slightly covering powder with it all 

00:01:36.479 --> 00:01:41.240
 is really fixed and everything 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:43.220
 his place remains 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:45.860
 I take my control here 

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:49.189
 absolute favorite contoured of nothing 

00:01:45.860 --> 00:01:52.430
 I control my cheek with my chin 

00:01:49.189 --> 00:01:54.080
 pine and so on and blinds that 

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:58.189
 Of course then it well from 

00:01:54.080 --> 00:02:00.289
 no tapes sees'm my eyebrows 

00:01:58.189 --> 00:02:02.600
 I mean my favorite eyebrow pencil 

00:02:00.289 --> 00:02:05.210
 anastasia and as you can see 

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:07.640
 I have a relatively straight eyebrow shape 

00:02:05.210 --> 00:02:09.050
 and I just like that and that 

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:11.890
 Of course I do other eyebrows 

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:11.890
 again after 

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:18.730
 so that the eyes look bigger nude 

00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.690
 make a kajal pencil and wear it 

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:21.690
 the waterline 

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.950
 for the also make-up I use here 

00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:27.840
 a brown credit shadow me 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:30.840
 with such a fluffy brush in mine 

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:33.360
 rent give that blinded well and wear 

00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.560
 something else and then my eye on one 

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.480
 palette I take one here 

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.040
 rose-colored throne that kind of 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:40.440
 shimmers and carry that on the 

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:42.930
 movable lid on and something in the 

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:45.090
 angle the button white i use 

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.829
 then to marry my eyebrows 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:49.200
 then I take a matte brown 

00:02:46.829 --> 00:02:50.879
 do to emphasize the dearest and one 

00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:53.390
 matt black eyeshadow around the whole 

00:02:50.879 --> 00:02:53.390
 to intensify 

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:03.209
 as an eyeliner I use one here 

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:04.890
 black marker pen eyeliner and rings 

00:03:03.209 --> 00:03:07.159
 that at the end of the eye a bit more 

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:07.159
 on 

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:16.300
 As a mascara I use super at the moment 

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:17.019
 like the init elbe intense mascara of 

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:18.610
 chanel 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:20.349
 unfortunately I have only one sample here because 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:22.810
 the original size is really expensive but 

00:03:20.349 --> 00:03:25.330
 as you can see it does that for so long 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:27.550
 and tight eyelashes and make love 

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:29.260
 the result with the oscar success only 

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:30.940
 too bad that it is so expensive that me 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.830
 you can just buy like that 

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:34.720
 I use a lipliner for the lips 

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:36.489
 from essens and that then applies to the 

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:38.680
 whole lip, too, just keeps longer 

00:03:36.489 --> 00:03:40.840
 and i think i also like the color 

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:42.220
 totally great for a bit more fresh 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:44.349
 face I use this one for 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:45.579
 thread calm current and then highlight me 

00:03:44.349 --> 00:03:47.860
 cheeks still with the mary lou 

00:03:45.579 --> 00:03:50.220
 minister and the plane fan brush 

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:55.079
 can you see the glos 

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:55.079
 this is what the finished make-up looks like 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:07.439
 Let's get to the nails here 

00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:09.540
 I use a base coat of 

00:04:07.439 --> 00:04:11.519
 p2 then I use a blue tone 

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:14.590
 from p2 and I carry that in two 

00:04:11.519 --> 00:04:16.540
 stratified on that completely covered 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:18.639
 and as overflow I use one here 

00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:20.410
 Essens really great 

00:04:18.639 --> 00:04:23.650
 looks and nails really nice 

00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:25.720
 looks shiny 

00:04:23.650 --> 00:04:27.330

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:30.040
