00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:08.160
 hello I am tamgho terminals 

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:09.480
 photography since we undertook 

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.050
 our journey on the basics of the 

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:11.910
 photography 

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.459
 we saw how the three factors 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.049
 what are the shutter iso and 

00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:17.550
 opening the lens you 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:20.099
 allow to obtain an exhibition 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.900
 correct we also saw that 

00:00:20.099 --> 00:00:23.910
 obtaining a correct exposure 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:27.179
 does not do everything in photography and 

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:29.189
 that thanks to the creative aspects of 

00:00:27.179 --> 00:00:31.050
 example the opening of the lens 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:33.930
 you had the opportunity to donate 

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:36.510
 volume of power about you that you 

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:38.129
 photograph well today I you 

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:41.550
 proposes to see the creative aspect of a 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:44.219
 other factor that is the shutter in 

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:45.870
 shutter effect is a very factor 

00:00:44.219 --> 00:00:47.699
 interesting not only she you 

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:48.870
 allows you to adapt to a situation 

00:00:47.699 --> 00:00:50.579
 given 

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.870
 in case you photograph a 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.609
 where there is not enough light 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.309
 so you need a long 

00:00:53.609 --> 00:00:58.590
 exposure or if you take a 

00:00:56.309 --> 00:01:00.750
 photo in the middle of the day 

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:02.370
 at noon for example where you have a lot 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.920
 too much light at that time you 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:06.630
 reduce your shutter speed while 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:08.369
 this is part of the basics of 

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.860
 the shutter nevertheless there is one aspect 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:14.040
 more interesting that is the aspect 

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:15.509
 creative shutter the creative aspect 

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.090
 shutter allows you to inject 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:20.189
 of movement in your photograph or 

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:21.299
 good to freeze a moment then you 

00:01:20.189 --> 00:01:23.460
 go tell me yes anyway the 

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:25.320
 photography is neither more nor less 

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:29.130
 that capture a moment so like this 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.689
 is not a film it's inevitably a 

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:34.320
 unique moment frozen in time 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:36.689
 yes you would be right nevertheless if I 

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:39.360
 you said that photography or 

00:01:36.689 --> 00:01:41.280
 allows with the help of the shutter 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:43.200
 show you things that even your 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.630
 eyes and your brain does not you 

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:47.820
 not allow and for that I will you 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:50.159
 offers a little experience to do in 

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.439
 from home everything I have 

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:57.830
 with me today is my device 

00:01:52.439 --> 00:01:59.039
 my canon 60d hand lens 1 18 135 mm 

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:03.789
 [Applause] 

00:01:59.039 --> 00:02:05.140
 show a desk lamp foot one that 

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:09.700
 is stronger than the other is the pure 

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:11.290
 chance and make it less golden factors 

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:13.420
 you can very well use a sheet 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:17.110
 white or yellow cloth any 

00:02:13.420 --> 00:02:20.380
 fund that makes people think 

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:22.690
 light then not very glamorous I 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:26.110
 admit I have some cardboard boxes 

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:28.810
 here to help me pick up the scene a 

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:30.040
 small tray that goes into the oven 

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:32.470
 usually in which I put a 

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:34.239
 little water and bone a vulgar bag 

00:02:32.470 --> 00:02:37.090
 plastic in which to gier I put a 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:38.890
 little water I used a needle for 

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:41.319
 to make a little hole the purpose of 

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:46.480
 experience is disgusting will fall 

00:02:41.319 --> 00:02:49.329
 in the dish make waves in the water 

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:51.420
 and we will capture the movement of 

00:02:49.329 --> 00:02:54.069
 this little drop of water that meets 

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:54.700
 the rest of the water you will tell me 

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:57.010
 very much needed 

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:59.290
 you can see the mussels very well 

00:02:57.010 --> 00:03:01.060
 ermo and all that is not worth it yes 

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:03.250
 but what you do not see is 

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:05.620
 what happens at the moment of impact 

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:07.180
 the bounce of the droplet and that's it 

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:10.269
 we will try to capture today 

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:11.319
 so to do that because there is no 

00:03:10.269 --> 00:03:14.560
 a lot of light 

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:16.120
 here I was forced to ride my iso to 

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:18.220
 about mid May we'll see it's going 

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:20.560
 maybe it's going to be varied in this 

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:22.840
 regarding the speed of the shutter 

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:25.600
 since I'm going to use my flash on 

00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:27.880
 little flash pop that ensures the device 

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:29.709
 I'm going to the maximum speed that I 

00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:33.100
 can on most devices 

00:03:29.709 --> 00:03:34.480
 it's 250th two seconds beyond that 

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:36.430
 you will not be able to use your flash 

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:38.650
 we can see that in an episode 

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:43.120
 next to explain why there is 

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:45.220
 7 this limit, then a 250th and in that 

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:47.290
 about my goal 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:50.709
 I chose that goal because I 

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:53.319
 will summarize a little bit about the water and I'm going 

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:55.359
 get an opening to the biggest 

00:03:53.319 --> 00:03:58.120
 around 5.6 which should 

00:03:55.359 --> 00:04:00.160
 match what you have so I 

00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:02.709
 propose you to start we will take 

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:05.520
 several exhibitions will review some 

00:04:02.709 --> 00:04:08.160
 after the others what we get and 

00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:09.660
 and we 'll talk again after I've kept 

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.440
 the same exposure parameters for 

00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:12.600
 all these catches 

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:14.880
 that is an iso 20000 an opening 

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:18.000
 from a goal to 5.6 and a speed 

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:19.470
 shutter at a 250th of a second this 

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.030
 that I need to tell you here is that 

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:22.770
 the difficulty is not so much in 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:26.310
 obtaining a correct exposure 

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:28.260
 but rather in capturing the moment when 

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:29.730
 the drop of water meets the water that is 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:31.650
 found in the dish because it is not 

00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:33.480
 very easy and for each of these 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:36.300
 pictures there it took me about 4 as 

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:38.580
 a photo before obtaining a photo 

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:41.250
 interesting an interesting take 

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:43.590
 what I hope you will notice is 

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:46.920
 color reflections in water, 

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:49.050
 yellow-gold side and also amber mark 

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:52.500
 it all comes from the 

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:54.210
 brightness that reflected on my fake 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:56.940
 and you remember I would have used a 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:58.350
 golden background so that's why we have this 

00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:01.250
 kind of light but you could have 

00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:04.730
 choose a different fund and 

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:07.560
 influence the atmosphere of your 

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:09.630
 photograph you will surely notice 

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:11.970
 that there is a little bit of noise in his 

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:14.010
 photos and this just comes from my 

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:15.600
 value let's say that's pretty high and the 

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:17.880
 little light that is in the 

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:20.100
 seine and I would have hoped to have 

00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:22.860
 photos a little more enlightened then they 

00:05:20.100 --> 00:05:25.230
 are still well exposed but she 

00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:26.700
 lacks a little bit of light in my opinion 

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:29.130
 so what do you think 

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:31.350
 not bad at all no who would have believed in 

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:33.060
 looking at his exhibits they had 

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:34.860
 been taken from my attic 

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:36.750
 I hope you found all that 

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:38.940
 interesting there is more information 

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:39.960
 on my blog as usual and in 

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:41.280
 waiting next time these 

00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:44.660
 terminals that tell you if you like 

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:44.660
 what you see captured
