pencils on like pens and a lot of the
other<00:00:37.020> writing<00:00:37.350> utensils<00:00:37.950> that<00:00:37.980> you<00:00:38.190> have<00:00:38.340> is

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550 
other writing utensils that you have is

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:40.369 
other writing utensils that you have is
that<00:00:38.879> they<00:00:39.030> get<00:00:39.180> shorter<00:00:39.600> as<00:00:39.780> you<00:00:39.930> use<00:00:40.170> them

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
that they get shorter as you use them

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:41.900 
that they get shorter as you use them
you<00:00:40.440> know<00:00:40.590> you<00:00:40.649> sharpen<00:00:41.100> them<00:00:41.250> they<00:00:41.399> get<00:00:41.550> a<00:00:41.610> lot

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:41.910 
you know you sharpen them they get a lot

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:44.180 
you know you sharpen them they get a lot
smaller<00:00:42.300> than<00:00:42.690> the<00:00:42.870> original<00:00:43.379> you<00:00:43.829> know<00:00:43.950> size

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
smaller than the original you know size

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.190 
smaller than the original you know size
that<00:00:44.489> you<00:00:44.520> originally<00:00:44.820> get<00:00:45.239> them<00:00:45.420> at<00:00:45.570> so<00:00:46.050> the

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
that you originally get them at so the

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:47.299 
that you originally get them at so the
interesting<00:00:46.410> thing<00:00:46.710> we're<00:00:46.829> going<00:00:46.980> to<00:00:47.039> do<00:00:47.160> is

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309 
interesting thing we're going to do is

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:48.440 
interesting thing we're going to do is
we're<00:00:47.399> actually<00:00:47.489> going<00:00:47.700> to<00:00:47.789> make<00:00:47.940> our<00:00:48.059> pencil

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
we're actually going to make our pencil

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:49.790 
we're actually going to make our pencil
case<00:00:48.660> vertically<00:00:49.289> here<00:00:49.469> and<00:00:49.559> we're<00:00:49.649> going<00:00:49.739> to

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
case vertically here and we're going to

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:50.959 
case vertically here and we're going to
make<00:00:49.860> it<00:00:50.039> a<00:00:50.100> little<00:00:50.190> bit<00:00:50.340> shorter<00:00:50.730> than<00:00:50.789> the

00:00:50.959 --> 00:00:50.969 
make it a little bit shorter than the

00:00:50.969 --> 00:00:52.639 
make it a little bit shorter than the
pencils<00:00:51.390> themselves<00:00:51.899> so<00:00:52.020> that<00:00:52.050> you<00:00:52.320> can<00:00:52.440> kind

00:00:52.639 --> 00:00:52.649 
pencils themselves so that you can kind

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:55.130 
pencils themselves so that you can kind
of<00:00:52.710> see<00:00:52.770> which<00:00:53.579> pencils<00:00:54.059> are<00:00:54.149> in<00:00:54.270> there<00:00:54.510> and<00:00:54.809> we

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:55.140 
of see which pencils are in there and we

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.510 
of see which pencils are in there and we
don't<00:00:55.199> want<00:00:55.289> to<00:00:55.440> make<00:00:55.530> it<00:00:55.649> the<00:00:55.739> entire<00:00:56.280> length

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:56.520 
don't want to make it the entire length

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:57.740 
don't want to make it the entire length
otherwise<00:00:56.969> you<00:00:57.180> know<00:00:57.270> it<00:00:57.300> can<00:00:57.420> be<00:00:57.510> a<00:00:57.600> little

00:00:57.740 --> 00:00:57.750 
otherwise you know it can be a little

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:00.260 
otherwise you know it can be a little
bit<00:00:57.930> difficult<00:00:58.079> to<00:00:58.440> see<00:00:58.710> and<00:00:58.980> you<00:00:59.820> know<00:00:59.879> where

00:01:00.260 --> 00:01:00.270 
bit difficult to see and you know where

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:01.189 
bit difficult to see and you know where
they<00:01:00.359> are<00:01:00.390> and<00:01:00.570> they're<00:01:00.660> just<00:01:00.870> going<00:01:01.020> to<00:01:01.079> get

00:01:01.189 --> 00:01:01.199 
they are and they're just going to get

00:01:01.199 --> 00:01:02.689 
they are and they're just going to get
shorter<00:01:01.590> from<00:01:01.770> there<00:01:01.920> as<00:01:02.070> you<00:01:02.160> sharpen<00:01:02.579> them

00:01:02.689 --> 00:01:02.699 
shorter from there as you sharpen them

00:01:02.699 --> 00:01:04.789 
shorter from there as you sharpen them
so<00:01:02.879> I<00:01:03.059> about<00:01:03.480> four<00:01:03.719> inches<00:01:03.989> of<00:01:04.049> tape<00:01:04.320> here<00:01:04.559> that

00:01:04.789 --> 00:01:04.799 
so I about four inches of tape here that

00:01:04.799 --> 00:01:07.700 
so I about four inches of tape here that
are<00:01:04.979> five<00:01:05.309> and<00:01:05.489> a<00:01:05.519> quarter<00:01:05.820> inches<00:01:06.000> long<00:01:06.710> I'm

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:07.710 
are five and a quarter inches long I'm

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.130 
are five and a quarter inches long I'm
going<00:01:07.860> to<00:01:07.950> take<00:01:08.040> my<00:01:08.189> first<00:01:08.460> two<00:01:08.909> and<00:01:09.299> stick

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:10.140 
going to take my first two and stick

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.170 
going to take my first two and stick
them<00:01:10.260> together<00:01:10.460> and<00:01:11.460> I<00:01:11.549> have<00:01:11.729> them<00:01:11.880> set<00:01:12.150> up

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:12.180 
them together and I have them set up

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.520 
them together and I have them set up
vertically<00:01:12.689> because<00:01:12.810> that's<00:01:13.170> the<00:01:13.320> way<00:01:13.350> I'm

00:01:13.520 --> 00:01:13.530 
vertically because that's the way I'm

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.149 
vertically because that's the way I'm
going<00:01:13.740> to<00:01:14.070> be<00:01:14.689> eventually<00:01:15.689> laying<00:01:16.530> them<00:01:16.799> here

00:01:17.149 --> 00:01:17.159 
going to be eventually laying them here

00:01:17.159 --> 00:01:18.980 
going to be eventually laying them here
so<00:01:17.460> I<00:01:17.490> have<00:01:17.970> my<00:01:18.150> first<00:01:18.360> two<00:01:18.630> stuck<00:01:18.840> together

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:18.990 
so I have my first two stuck together

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:22.550 
so I have my first two stuck together
going<00:01:19.799> to<00:01:19.890> take<00:01:20.070> my<00:01:20.340> third<00:01:20.700> one<00:01:21.229> going<00:01:22.229> to<00:01:22.350> line

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:22.560 
going to take my third one going to line

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.530 
going to take my third one going to line
it<00:01:22.590> up<00:01:22.830> on<00:01:23.009> my<00:01:23.159> cutting<00:01:23.520> mat<00:01:23.820> there<00:01:24.150> and<00:01:24.420> I'm

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:24.540 
it up on my cutting mat there and I'm

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:26.749 
it up on my cutting mat there and I'm
probably<00:01:24.930> going<00:01:25.229> to<00:01:25.590> stick<00:01:26.070> it<00:01:26.250> so<00:01:26.430> that<00:01:26.610> i

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
probably going to stick it so that i

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:30.260 
probably going to stick it so that i
have<00:01:27.030> a<00:01:27.330> total<00:01:27.799> width<00:01:28.799> about<00:01:29.579> two<00:01:29.970> and<00:01:30.150> a<00:01:30.240> half

00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:30.270 
have a total width about two and a half

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.929 
have a total width about two and a half
inches<00:01:30.869> maybe<00:01:31.439> a<00:01:31.560> little<00:01:31.890> bit<00:01:32.130> over<00:01:32.400> that<00:01:32.610> so

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939 
inches maybe a little bit over that so

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:35.480 
inches maybe a little bit over that so
two<00:01:33.030> and<00:01:33.390> three-quarter<00:01:33.900> inches<00:01:34.340> there's<00:01:35.340> my

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:35.490 
two and three-quarter inches there's my

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.310 
two and three-quarter inches there's my
third<00:01:35.759> piece<00:01:36.000> going<00:01:36.420> to<00:01:36.509> take<00:01:36.659> my<00:01:36.840> fourth

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:37.320 
third piece going to take my fourth

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:39.620 
third piece going to take my fourth
piece<00:01:37.619> and<00:01:38.040> that's<00:01:38.880> going<00:01:39.119> to<00:01:39.180> come<00:01:39.329> up<00:01:39.479> the

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
piece and that's going to come up the

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.380 
piece and that's going to come up the
rest<00:01:39.810> of<00:01:39.930> the<00:01:39.990> sticky<00:01:40.350> side<00:01:40.560> and<00:01:41.030> now<00:01:42.030> what<00:01:42.299> I'm

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
rest of the sticky side and now what I'm

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:45.020 
rest of the sticky side and now what I'm
going<00:01:42.600> to<00:01:42.720> do<00:01:43.020> is<00:01:43.380> cut<00:01:44.070> out<00:01:44.189> for<00:01:44.490> more<00:01:44.700> strips

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
going to do is cut out for more strips

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.090 
going to do is cut out for more strips
for<00:01:45.299> more<00:01:45.509> identical<00:01:45.899> strips<00:01:46.470> and<00:01:46.740> I'm<00:01:46.829> going

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
for more identical strips and I'm going

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:48.679 
for more identical strips and I'm going
to<00:01:47.159> make<00:01:47.430> a<00:01:47.460> sheet<00:01:47.820> of<00:01:47.850> tape<00:01:48.119> that's<00:01:48.299> exactly

00:01:48.679 --> 00:01:48.689 
to make a sheet of tape that's exactly

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:50.270 
to make a sheet of tape that's exactly
the<00:01:48.840> same<00:01:49.020> size<00:01:49.259> as<00:01:49.470> that<00:01:49.500> so<00:01:49.860> just<00:01:49.979> repeat

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
the same size as that so just repeat

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:53.120 
the same size as that so just repeat
this<00:01:50.460> step<00:01:50.700> over<00:01:51.000> again<00:01:51.380> so<00:01:52.380> there<00:01:52.740> I<00:01:52.770> have<00:01:53.009> my

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130 
this step over again so there I have my

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.530 
this step over again so there I have my
two<00:01:53.189> pieces<00:01:53.729> they're<00:01:53.880> trimmed<00:01:54.210> they<00:01:54.390> are

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:54.540 
two pieces they're trimmed they are

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.389 
two pieces they're trimmed they are
ready<00:01:54.840> to<00:01:55.049> go<00:01:55.229> so<00:01:55.470> I'm<00:01:55.590> going<00:01:55.829> to<00:01:55.920> do<00:01:56.070> now<00:01:56.219> is

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
ready to go so I'm going to do now is

ready to go so I'm going to do now is
when<00:01:56.549> I<00:01:56.579> cut<00:01:56.759> out<00:01:56.880> one<00:01:57.090> strip<00:01:57.299> of<00:01:57.390> tape<00:01:57.509> that's

00:01:57.709 --> 00:01:57.719 
when I cut out one strip of tape that's

00:01:57.719 --> 00:01:59.870 
when I cut out one strip of tape that's
the<00:01:58.020> height<00:01:58.350> of<00:01:58.500> the<00:01:58.890> two<00:01:59.250> strips<00:01:59.520> here<00:01:59.700> and

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
the height of the two strips here and

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:01.550 
the height of the two strips here and
then<00:02:00.270> one<00:02:00.479> that<00:02:00.719> is<00:02:00.840> the<00:02:01.049> length<00:02:01.259> of<00:02:01.439> the

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560

00:02:07.819 --> 00:02:07.829 
directly in half just to save a little

00:02:07.829 --> 00:02:10.729 
directly in half just to save a little
bit<00:02:07.950> on<00:02:08.160> tape<00:02:08.539> going<00:02:09.539> to<00:02:09.810> stick<00:02:10.259> them<00:02:10.410> directly

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:10.739 
bit on tape going to stick them directly

00:02:10.739 --> 00:02:12.440 
bit on tape going to stick them directly
on<00:02:10.979> top<00:02:11.160> of<00:02:11.370> each<00:02:11.459> other

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:12.450 
on top of each other

00:02:12.450 --> 00:02:15.589 
on top of each other
and<00:02:12.540> then<00:02:13.110> I'm<00:02:13.290> going<00:02:13.680> to<00:02:14.330> very<00:02:15.330> carefully

00:02:15.589 --> 00:02:15.599 
and then I'm going to very carefully

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:18.770 
and then I'm going to very carefully
just<00:02:16.140> a<00:02:16.290> seal<00:02:16.650> up<00:02:16.830> the<00:02:16.950> side<00:02:17.190> here<00:02:17.660> flip<00:02:18.660> the

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:18.780 
just a seal up the side here flip the

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:22.220 
just a seal up the side here flip the
whole<00:02:18.900> thing<00:02:19.170> over<00:02:19.379> and<00:02:20.209> then<00:02:21.209> peel<00:02:21.900> it<00:02:22.050> over

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:22.230 
whole thing over and then peel it over

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:24.140 
whole thing over and then peel it over
like<00:02:22.349> this<00:02:22.560> then<00:02:23.550> I'm<00:02:23.610> going<00:02:23.700> to<00:02:23.790> go<00:02:23.910> to<00:02:23.970> the

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
like this then I'm going to go to the

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.750 
like this then I'm going to go to the
other<00:02:24.239> side<00:02:24.540> and<00:02:24.989> I'm<00:02:25.440> going<00:02:25.890> to<00:02:26.129> do<00:02:26.310> the<00:02:26.489> exact

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:26.760 
other side and I'm going to do the exact

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.420 
other side and I'm going to do the exact
same<00:02:26.790> thing<00:02:27.390> so<00:02:28.170> happened<00:02:28.530> on<00:02:28.590> outside<00:02:28.980> half

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:29.430 
same thing so happened on outside half

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:31.790 
same thing so happened on outside half
of<00:02:29.610> it<00:02:29.700> on<00:02:29.790> this<00:02:29.940> side<00:02:30.620> nothing<00:02:31.620> too

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:31.800 
of it on this side nothing too

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:34.759 
of it on this side nothing too
complicated<00:02:32.280> here<00:02:32.760> I<00:02:33.360> take<00:02:34.080> my<00:02:34.200> last<00:02:34.440> piece

00:02:34.759 --> 00:02:34.769 
complicated here I take my last piece

00:02:34.769 --> 00:02:37.160 
complicated here I take my last piece
and<00:02:35.069> that's<00:02:35.250> simply<00:02:35.519> going<00:02:36.030> to<00:02:36.450> seal<00:02:36.870> up<00:02:37.050> the

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:37.170 
and that's simply going to seal up the

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.729 
and that's simply going to seal up the
bottom<00:02:37.500> here<00:02:37.910> flip<00:02:38.910> it<00:02:39.030> over<00:02:39.150> and<00:02:39.450> boom<00:02:40.290> so<00:02:40.590> now

00:02:40.729 --> 00:02:40.739 
bottom here flip it over and boom so now

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:43.449 
bottom here flip it over and boom so now
we<00:02:40.799> have<00:02:40.920> a<00:02:41.099> nice<00:02:41.430> pouch<00:02:41.819> to<00:02:42.180> put<00:02:42.510> our<00:02:42.780> pencil

we have a nice pouch to put our pencil
vessels<00:02:44.459> here<00:02:44.670> but<00:02:44.970> we<00:02:45.209> were<00:02:45.360> not<00:02:45.510> done<00:02:45.750> yet<00:02:45.780> we

00:02:46.009 --> 00:02:46.019 
vessels here but we were not done yet we

00:02:46.019 --> 00:02:47.870 
vessels here but we were not done yet we
actually<00:02:46.319> have<00:02:46.440> have<00:02:46.860> to<00:02:46.980> put<00:02:47.130> into<00:02:47.340> a<00:02:47.370> flap<00:02:47.640> or

attach<00:02:57.420> it<00:02:57.599> on<00:02:57.690> the<00:02:57.810> front<00:02:58.110> so<00:02:58.260> I<00:02:58.319> cut<00:02:58.590> out<00:02:58.620> for

00:02:59.089 --> 00:02:59.099 
attach it on the front so I cut out for

00:02:59.099 --> 00:03:00.710 
attach it on the front so I cut out for
more<00:02:59.310> strips<00:02:59.549> of<00:02:59.700> tape<00:02:59.819> that<00:03:00.120> are<00:03:00.269> seven

more strips of tape that are seven

00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.900 
more strips of tape that are seven
inches<00:03:01.049> long<00:03:01.380> and<00:03:01.709> the<00:03:02.130> reason<00:03:02.430> why<00:03:02.549> I<00:03:02.579> cut

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:02.910 
inches long and the reason why I cut

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:04.610 
inches long and the reason why I cut
them<00:03:03.000> out<00:03:03.090> so<00:03:03.329> long<00:03:03.569> as<00:03:03.780> that<00:03:03.810> I<00:03:04.110> just<00:03:04.410> want<00:03:04.590> to

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:04.620 
them out so long as that I just want to

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:06.680 
them out so long as that I just want to
make<00:03:04.709> sure<00:03:04.769> that<00:03:05.010> they're<00:03:05.310> able<00:03:05.459> to<00:03:05.730> kind<00:03:06.660> of

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:06.690 
make sure that they're able to kind of

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:08.360 
make sure that they're able to kind of
wrap<00:03:06.870> all<00:03:07.110> the<00:03:07.230> way<00:03:07.260> around<00:03:07.319> the<00:03:07.650> pencils<00:03:08.099> and

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.370 
wrap all the way around the pencils and

00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:10.729 
wrap all the way around the pencils and
go<00:03:09.090> all<00:03:09.269> the<00:03:09.390> way<00:03:09.420> to<00:03:09.540> the<00:03:09.750> front<00:03:09.959> here<00:03:10.380> you

00:03:10.729 --> 00:03:10.739 
go all the way to the front here you

00:03:10.739 --> 00:03:11.900 
go all the way to the front here you
might<00:03:10.950> have<00:03:11.099> to<00:03:11.280> make<00:03:11.459> it<00:03:11.610> a<00:03:11.640> little<00:03:11.730> bit

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:11.910 
might have to make it a little bit

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:13.309 
might have to make it a little bit
larger<00:03:12.209> depending<00:03:12.450> on<00:03:12.660> you<00:03:12.780> know<00:03:13.019> if<00:03:13.200> your

00:03:13.309 --> 00:03:13.319 
larger depending on you know if your

00:03:13.319 --> 00:03:14.990 
larger depending on you know if your
pencils<00:03:13.739> are<00:03:13.860> really<00:03:14.190> new<00:03:14.430> that's<00:03:14.819> when

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:15.000 
pencils are really new that's when

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.190 
pencils are really new that's when
they're<00:03:15.120> going<00:03:15.239> to<00:03:15.329> be<00:03:15.450> you<00:03:15.569> know<00:03:15.660> the<00:03:15.690> longest

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:16.200 
they're going to be you know the longest

00:03:16.200 --> 00:03:18.559 
they're going to be you know the longest
of<00:03:16.319> course<00:03:16.560> so<00:03:17.310> I'm<00:03:17.400> going<00:03:17.730> to<00:03:17.760> make<00:03:18.269> sure<00:03:18.420> this

00:03:18.559 --> 00:03:18.569 
of course so I'm going to make sure this

00:03:18.569 --> 00:03:20.930 
of course so I'm going to make sure this
is<00:03:18.750> the<00:03:18.780> same<00:03:19.049> size<00:03:19.410> I<00:03:19.829> can<00:03:20.370> probably<00:03:20.639> just<00:03:20.760> use

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940 
is the same size I can probably just use

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:22.550 
is the same size I can probably just use
my<00:03:21.120> cutting<00:03:21.450> mat<00:03:21.569> once<00:03:21.780> again<00:03:22.109> because<00:03:22.410> I<00:03:22.500> know

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560 
my cutting mat once again because I know

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.309 
my cutting mat once again because I know
the<00:03:22.769> measurements<00:03:23.130> it's<00:03:24.060> about<00:03:24.150> two<00:03:24.900> and

00:03:25.309 --> 00:03:25.319 
the measurements it's about two and

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:28.879 
the measurements it's about two and
three-quarter<00:03:25.950> inches<00:03:26.069> and<00:03:27.560> then<00:03:28.560> I'm<00:03:28.799> going

we're going to do is fold this piece
down<00:04:11.609> the<00:04:12.209> obviously<00:04:12.690> the<00:04:12.840> longest<00:04:13.260> pencil

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:13.620 
down the obviously the longest pencil

00:04:13.620 --> 00:04:15.349 
down the obviously the longest pencil
will<00:04:13.859> prevent<00:04:14.280> it<00:04:14.459> from<00:04:14.639> you<00:04:14.790> know<00:04:14.910> going<00:04:15.120> any
