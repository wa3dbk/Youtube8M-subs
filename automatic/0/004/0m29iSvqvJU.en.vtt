00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:58.239
 It cost not to get to where I am right now 

00:00:54.610 --> 00:01:00.879
 and well, this one is inspired by my life 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:03.790
 and he is very father he regulated the truth that 

00:01:00.879 --> 00:01:06.490
 my respect for stops for compositions 

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:07.930
 the regulo is heavy 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:10.299
 if we look there then we have to 

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:13.869
 put pictures with those from the record if 

00:01:10.299 --> 00:01:17.909
 all of them to change boxer 

00:01:13.869 --> 00:01:17.909
 to sing to deliver something as Oscar did 

00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:24.610
 I do not do not think if they fix my voice the same and 

00:01:21.010 --> 00:01:27.840
 yes but it's not my profession, not what it is 

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:31.300
 boxing I mine and we'll see later 

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:33.760
 he has suffered some controversial decisions 

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:35.410
 of these two years that have passed and a lot 

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:38.290
 people say so boxing is 

00:01:35.410 --> 00:01:40.060
 sold what do you think of that good for the 

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:42.160
 People who know me know how to have 

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:44.080
 seas know under boxing knows that 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:46.420
 always that action that under is going to give 

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:49.300
 acting there he does not care if he goes to 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:50.920

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:52.200
 that people are happy s that 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.810
 night 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:57.000
 I'm trying to come back now so 

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:59.520
 to the time from before not boxing with what 

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.130
 better fight with the champions and give 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.720
 the people the action you want to see 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:07.660
 in an interview a few months ago 

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:10.000
 they said that the cinnamon fight you thought 

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:12.670
 which is very fast for him in his career 

00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:15.220
 and many critics said he had 

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:17.580
 you have to go to the canaero because race 

00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:19.260
 who thinks this after 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:21.300
 The only thing I can tell you is that 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.250
 clear my heart my country is with the 

00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.810
 canelo with mexico not obviously but 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:28.530
 we are talking and they made me an 

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:30.810
 As an amateur, do not ask about the little or 

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.250
 Boxing much I know were my 

00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:34.140
 thoughts people can say 

00:02:32.250 --> 00:02:36.030
 different everyone has their favorites 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:38.790
 obviously when I fight I do not all the 

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.980
 world is going to me I do another one to the other 

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:43.230
 another rival maybe not so everyone 

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:45.360
 he has his opinions and mine as he can 

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:48.540
 that I was inclined to mayweather 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:50.820
 the style of course is that it is the 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:53.460
 experience has shown it with great 

00:02:50.820 --> 00:02:54.630
 antalya dores canelo if it is the first 

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:57.720
 time you are going to face a big 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:03:00.690
 pound-for-pound and would therefore mayweather 

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:02.610
 and his infinite fight against a champion and 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:04.950
 against a fighter of the cinnamon level 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:07.230
 when this fight that follows more for you 

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:09.330
 For me, well, I 'm looking for you 

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:11.190
 new challenges maybe to get on another 

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:13.680
 category and look for another championship my 

00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:15.230
 fourth world championship to my short 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:18.440
 age and 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:21.170
 nothing to take advantage of this time right now 

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:23.629
 that everyone is watching me and nothing 

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:26.330
 I strive to make an effort to strengthen my body 

00:03:23.629 --> 00:03:28.640
 strive in my profession and give the 

00:03:26.330 --> 00:03:30.280
 people see that there are other other 

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:32.799
 opportunity not here there are other things 

00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:36.980
 retire from boxing and search and follow 

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:38.989
 giving noises either as a promoter and 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:41.299
 be as a singer either as whatever 

00:03:38.989 --> 00:03:43.250
