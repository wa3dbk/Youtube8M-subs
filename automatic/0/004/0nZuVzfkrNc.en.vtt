00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:38.190 
close range firefight and I'm glad that

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:39.560 
close range firefight and I'm glad that
they<00:00:38.370> do<00:00:38.430> since<00:00:38.940> this<00:00:39.059> is<00:00:39.180> the<00:00:39.210> way<00:00:39.420> they

00:00:39.560 --> 00:00:39.570 
they do since this is the way they

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.440 
they do since this is the way they
should<00:00:39.629> have<00:00:39.930> always<00:00:40.320> been<00:00:40.559> I<00:00:40.940> like<00:00:41.940> using<00:00:42.180> the

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:42.450 
should have always been I like using the

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.420 
should have always been I like using the
870<00:00:43.110> now<00:00:43.260> since<00:00:43.620> the<00:00:43.770> glitch<00:00:44.040> where<00:00:44.309> your

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:44.430 
870 now since the glitch where your

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:46.190 
870 now since the glitch where your
crosshair<00:00:45.030> would<00:00:45.210> disappear<00:00:45.629> is<00:00:45.719> now<00:00:45.870> fixed

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:46.200 
crosshair would disappear is now fixed

00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:49.069 
crosshair would disappear is now fixed
it's<00:00:46.980> also<00:00:47.160> really<00:00:47.489> consistent<00:00:48.239> however<00:00:48.539> the

00:00:49.069 --> 00:00:49.079 
it's also really consistent however the

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:50.810 
it's also really consistent however the
only<00:00:49.110> downside<00:00:49.800> with<00:00:50.010> that<00:00:50.129> gun<00:00:50.309> for<00:00:50.340> me<00:00:50.640> is

00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:50.820 
only downside with that gun for me is

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.520 
only downside with that gun for me is
that<00:00:51.059> if<00:00:51.239> you<00:00:51.360> were<00:00:51.480> to<00:00:51.510> miss<00:00:51.780> one<00:00:52.050> shot<00:00:52.320> with

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
that if you were to miss one shot with

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.760 
that if you were to miss one shot with
it<00:00:52.559> you<00:00:53.280> were<00:00:53.399> pretty<00:00:53.579> much<00:00:53.820> dead<00:00:54.350> the<00:00:55.350> m1014

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
it you were pretty much dead the m1014

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.459 
it you were pretty much dead the m1014
endow<00:00:56.579> have<00:00:56.879> also<00:00:57.270> been<00:00:57.449> buffed<00:00:57.750> but<00:00:58.350> the

00:00:58.459 --> 00:00:58.469 
endow have also been buffed but the

00:00:58.469 --> 00:01:00.170 
endow have also been buffed but the
range<00:00:58.710> in<00:00:58.859> recoil<00:00:59.250> have<00:00:59.460> turned<00:00:59.730> me<00:00:59.850> off<00:00:59.879> from

00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:00.180 
range in recoil have turned me off from

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.500 
range in recoil have turned me off from
using<00:01:00.539> them<00:01:00.660> so<00:01:01.550> basically<00:01:02.550> my<00:01:02.579> go-to<00:01:02.940> shotgun

00:01:03.500 --> 00:01:03.510 
using them so basically my go-to shotgun

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.649 
using them so basically my go-to shotgun
