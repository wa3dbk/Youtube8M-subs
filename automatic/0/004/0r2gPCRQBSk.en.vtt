00:00:16.309 --> 00:00:20.500
 voting results won leaflets view 

00:00:22.310 --> 00:00:26.390
 you know it turned out that among ours 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:27.439
 viewers a considerable number of fans 

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:29.419
 video games 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:31.939
 that is why we decided to touch upon such 

00:00:29.419 --> 00:00:34.100
 exciting topic like fighting today 

00:00:31.939 --> 00:00:36.680
 we'll try to choose one of the two 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:38.620
 mortal kombat or TNT ken that translated 

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:41.360
 from Japanese means iron fist 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:44.629
 japanese fighting produced company 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:48.230
 to us namely, Katsuhiro Harada 1 Series 

00:00:44.629 --> 00:00:50.089
 came out in 1994 at first it was possible 

00:00:48.230 --> 00:00:51.980
 play on the arcade machines and on 

00:00:50.089 --> 00:00:54.949
 first playstation at the moment 

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:57.890
 released six parts two tournaments and already 

00:00:54.949 --> 00:01:00.199
 Announced new seventh third third 

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:02.720
 the fourth and fifth of the stepina are 

00:01:00.199 --> 00:01:08.270
 the most popular based on the game was 

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:10.100
 three films created the first part 

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:12.409
 deadly battle and came out in 90 second 

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:14.509
 but to many of our subscribers will be 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:16.490
 curious to hear about how to play were 

00:01:14.509 --> 00:01:18.770
 issued various series and comics 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:22.119
 movies about the deadly battle everyone knows 

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:22.119
 who grew up in the 90s 

00:01:24.710 --> 00:01:29.960
 and now let's consider 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:32.060
 feature of games not presented 

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:34.670
 more than 40 characters for every taste 

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:36.740
 among them there are both animals and people 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:38.990
 but in mortal kombat more heroes 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:41.119
 More precisely more than 60 and although at first 

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:43.520
 the creators were engaged in repainting 

00:01:41.119 --> 00:01:45.530
 characters later for each was 

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:47.780
 developed a unique combat design 

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:49.220
 style and ability to me primarily in 

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:51.380
 tak don't like an interesting storyline 

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:53.479
 line and elaborated biographies 

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:55.490
 characters mortal kombat certainly not 

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:57.649
 inferior in this aspect and in some 

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:59.750
 parts of the series the player can dive into 

00:01:57.649 --> 00:02:01.850
 peace be to them in conquest mode and explicit 

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.380
 advantage of tag on is that on 

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:05.780
 each player's limb 

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:06.920
 a separate button is fixed about this 

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:08.600
 you can still argue 

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.759
 but the lack of blood in Japanese 

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:12.800
 fighting games are great in my opinion 

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:15.170
 omission mortal kombat opposite 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:19.120
 renowned for the high level of violence that 

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:19.120
 only worth all beloved fatalities 

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:24.230
 I am not a fan of excessive manifestation 

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:26.060
 violence in games but still can't 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:27.620
 disagree that lack of blood in 

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:30.260
 such a fighting game as an iron fist 

00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:32.329
 looks at least absurd and everything 

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:34.220
 I will remind you that even the creator and the Moscow Ring Road 

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:35.900
 begged the Japanese game okay bye 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:37.250
 some still cannot come to terms with 

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.470
 so that you are ken in all respects 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:40.790
 favor I propose a thief 

00:02:39.470 --> 00:02:43.190
 vote in our group vkontakte 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:47.090
