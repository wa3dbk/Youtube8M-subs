 unusual 

00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:21.960
 www 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:22.759
 Score 

00:01:22.759 --> 00:01:24.490
 few states 

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:26.990
 the club that is 

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:30.210
 the page I had 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.909
 if you are hired from 

00:01:31.909 --> 00:01:35.200
 this in the head of rivaling the game site in the other sites that you put 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:40.399
 the mite and on the aneel blog nothing whatever that happens in the male tournaments already 

00:01:40.399 --> 00:01:43.890
 I'll have a plane later with us. 

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.250
 accumulations of 10 or more people not learning to play there you spoke 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:51.560
 of this game called texas 

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.420
 the only club 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.400
 this is the great wall of defense but there are others to another action that are well 

00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.320
 less popular beach 

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:03.450
 but to play but little closed of medical ethics 

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:07.110
 state agency 

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:10.940
 the reason why we do not play we have few people selling cytotec fazoli 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.540
 much more dynamic the amount of information that exists in each wheel of 

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:18.830
 bet the bertin the first three cards then opened the package every 

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:21.509
 used the 5th card at the table that makes 

00:02:21.509 --> 00:02:24.989
 there each of the stages that a round after try a lot more dynamic and 

00:02:24.989 --> 00:02:25.769
 there is a lot more 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:28.899
 ability to generate information for those who are sitting at the table 

00:02:28.899 --> 00:02:30.089
 therefore 

00:02:30.089 --> 00:02:34.129
 I happen to have told you the previous block of pattern reads 

00:02:34.129 --> 00:02:37.489
 ethical thing than a little closed in ct is a kind of information for 

00:02:37.489 --> 00:02:41.949
 How many catu your opponent change in this one of 5 when you are looking for the exchange and the one 

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:44.449
 really matter question 

00:02:44.449 --> 00:02:48.889
 possible if we asked to get to know the illinois to print a lot because it is 

00:02:48.889 --> 00:02:52.209
 very little amount of information ti if I happen I will leave 

00:02:52.209 --> 00:02:56.420
 the less amount of information but the single command factor called strong 

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:57.829
 but it was this 

00:02:57.829 --> 00:02:59.929
 so much so that in a poker tournament on time 

00:02:59.929 --> 00:03:03.259
 The better the more tight the tournament structure is you 

00:03:03.259 --> 00:03:06.809
 receives a few chips but was very high but luck goes 

00:03:07.319 --> 00:03:10.649
 will appear the more those who get the harder you can work 

00:03:10.649 --> 00:03:12.809
 these chips in a more 

00:03:12.809 --> 00:03:17.679
 qualitative - the society that you like to have been luckier than today 

00:03:17.679 --> 00:03:19.409
 already been playing 

00:03:19.409 --> 00:03:22.049
 played 

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:23.689
 Prats and Sincere 

00:03:23.689 --> 00:03:25.779
 all that can happen the pack 

00:03:25.779 --> 00:03:29.099
 I already passed it is all possible combinations was already 

00:03:30.009 --> 00:03:33.190
 I already lost the court on the court, just like Dinho. 

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:34.180
 I won 

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:37.099
 and to the account of everything else his neck 

00:03:37.099 --> 00:03:40.439
