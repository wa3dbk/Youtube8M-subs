interactive<00:00:05.250> violin<00:00:05.640> can<00:00:05.880> mean<00:00:06.090> different

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:06.390 
interactive violin can mean different

00:00:06.390 --> 00:00:08.750 
interactive violin can mean different
things<00:00:06.540> to<00:00:06.810> different<00:00:06.899> people<00:00:07.200> but<00:00:07.610> the<00:00:08.610> way<00:00:08.730> I

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:08.760 
things to different people but the way I

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.590 
things to different people but the way I
use<00:00:09.980> that<00:00:10.980> notion<00:00:11.280> is<00:00:11.730> that<00:00:11.760> I<00:00:12.059> work<00:00:12.270> with<00:00:12.330> the

00:00:12.590 --> 00:00:12.600 
use that notion is that I work with the

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:15.020 
use that notion is that I work with the
violin<00:00:12.990> bow<00:00:13.200> itself<00:00:13.590> so<00:00:13.980> the<00:00:14.160> violin<00:00:14.490> bow<00:00:14.699> in

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
violin bow itself so the violin bow in

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:18.019 
violin bow itself so the violin bow in
its<00:00:15.900> basic<00:00:16.080> vanilla<00:00:16.470> state<00:00:17.039> is<00:00:17.279> the<00:00:17.550> engine

00:00:18.019 --> 00:00:18.029 
its basic vanilla state is the engine

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.410 
its basic vanilla state is the engine
which<00:00:18.240> powers<00:00:18.570> the<00:00:18.869> violin<00:00:19.560> and<00:00:20.190> but<00:00:21.119> by

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:21.420 
which powers the violin and but by

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:24.769 
which powers the violin and but by
measuring<00:00:21.929> the<00:00:22.289> violin<00:00:22.890> bow<00:00:23.339> its<00:00:24.210> movement

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
measuring the violin bow its movement

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:27.529 
measuring the violin bow its movement
its<00:00:24.990> speed<00:00:25.259> of<00:00:25.410> movement<00:00:25.589> it's<00:00:26.150> bo<00:00:27.150> pressure

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
its speed of movement it's bo pressure

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.409 
its speed of movement it's bo pressure
its<00:00:28.019> relationship<00:00:28.259> in<00:00:29.220> distance<00:00:29.730> to<00:00:30.390> the

00:00:30.409 --> 00:00:30.419 
its relationship in distance to the

00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:32.600 
its relationship in distance to the
violin<00:00:30.900> and<00:00:31.109> all<00:00:31.199> these<00:00:31.320> other<00:00:31.619> things<00:00:32.250> which

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:32.610 
violin and all these other things which

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.280 
violin and all these other things which
you<00:00:32.700> can<00:00:32.850> measure<00:00:33.000> now<00:00:33.270> I<00:00:33.540> can<00:00:34.020> use<00:00:34.140> this

00:00:34.280 --> 00:00:34.290 
you can measure now I can use this

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.279 
you can measure now I can use this
information<00:00:34.590> to<00:00:35.280> drive<00:00:36.120> a<00:00:36.360> computer<00:00:36.899> system

00:00:37.279 --> 00:00:37.289 
information to drive a computer system

00:00:37.289 --> 00:00:39.500 
information to drive a computer system
so<00:00:38.010> the<00:00:38.309> violin<00:00:38.730> at<00:00:39.000> the<00:00:39.090> same<00:00:39.270> time<00:00:39.449> as

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:39.510 
so the violin at the same time as

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:41.450 
so the violin at the same time as
driving<00:00:39.870> the<00:00:40.050> violin<00:00:40.440> can<00:00:40.800> be<00:00:40.980> driving

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:41.460 
driving the violin can be driving

00:00:41.460 --> 00:01:07.760 
driving the violin can be driving
another<00:00:42.359> method<00:00:43.350> of<00:00:43.680> making<00:00:43.949> music<00:01:06.770> the

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
another method of making music the

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.500 
another method of making music the
configuration<00:01:08.550> tonight<00:01:08.910> it's<00:01:09.330> very

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:09.510 
configuration tonight it's very

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:11.470 
configuration tonight it's very
experimental<00:01:10.170> because<00:01:10.830> it's<00:01:11.070> a<00:01:11.220> new

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:11.480 
experimental because it's a new

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:16.270 
experimental because it's a new
interactive<00:01:12.480> bow<00:01:12.930> it's<00:01:13.410> called<00:01:13.680> a<00:01:13.740> cable<00:01:14.250> and

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:16.280 
interactive bow it's called a cable and

00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:19.700 
interactive bow it's called a cable and
to<00:01:17.280> be<00:01:17.430> a<00:01:17.670> little<00:01:17.880> bit<00:01:18.000> technical<00:01:18.300> it's<00:01:18.900> in<00:01:19.290> in

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:19.710 
to be a little bit technical it's in in

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.800 
to be a little bit technical it's in in
the<00:01:20.010> front<00:01:20.340> of<00:01:20.460> the<00:01:20.550> bow<00:01:20.700> the<00:01:20.970> bit<00:01:21.600> where<00:01:21.780> you

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:21.810 
the front of the bow the bit where you

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:23.600 
the front of the bow the bit where you
hold<00:01:22.140> the<00:01:22.380> hold<00:01:22.590> it<00:01:22.770> there<00:01:23.280> are<00:01:23.430> some

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
hold the hold it there are some

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:25.640 
hold the hold it there are some
accelerometers<00:01:24.030> which<00:01:24.720> measure<00:01:25.020> movement

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:25.650 
accelerometers which measure movement

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:28.550 
accelerometers which measure movement
speed<00:01:25.980> of<00:01:26.100> movement<00:01:26.250> there's<00:01:27.060> a<00:01:27.180> sensor<00:01:27.960> in<00:01:28.110> in

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
speed of movement there's a sensor in in

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.830 
speed of movement there's a sensor in in
the<00:01:28.740> hair<00:01:29.010> itself<00:01:29.190> and<00:01:29.730> there<00:01:30.510> are<00:01:30.600> sensors

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:30.840 
the hair itself and there are sensors

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:33.530 
the hair itself and there are sensors
right<00:01:31.290> the<00:01:31.470> way<00:01:31.590> up<00:01:31.770> leave<00:01:32.250> the<00:01:32.610> the<00:01:32.880> what<00:01:33.300> was

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
right the way up leave the the what was

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.470 
right the way up leave the the what was
the<00:01:33.750> wood<00:01:33.960> of<00:01:34.080> the<00:01:34.200> boat<00:01:34.410> this<00:01:34.620> is<00:01:34.740> a<00:01:34.820> 505<00:01:35.820> glass

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:36.480 
the wood of the boat this is a 505 glass

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:39.650 
the wood of the boat this is a 505 glass
520<00:01:37.080> an<00:01:37.740> insight<00:01:38.130> that<00:01:38.310> is<00:01:38.400> an<00:01:38.550> aerial<00:01:39.000> so<00:01:39.570> the

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:39.660 
520 an insight that is an aerial so the

00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:41.210 
520 an insight that is an aerial so the
whole<00:01:39.810> thing<00:01:39.840> is<00:01:40.110> measured<00:01:40.680> basically

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
whole thing is measured basically

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:43.390 
whole thing is measured basically
everything<00:01:41.550> it<00:01:41.640> does<00:01:41.670> is<00:01:41.970> being<00:01:42.210> measured

00:01:43.390 --> 00:01:43.400 
everything it does is being measured

00:01:43.400 --> 00:02:05.580 
everything it does is being measured
into<00:01:44.000> ones<00:01:44.270> and<00:01:44.450> zeros

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:05.590 

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:08.859 

most<00:02:06.590> Muslim<00:02:07.220> is<00:02:07.340> it<00:02:07.490> that<00:02:07.610> I<00:02:07.670> make<00:02:07.970> is<00:02:08.210> does

00:02:08.859 --> 00:02:08.869 
most Muslim is it that I make is does

00:02:08.869 --> 00:02:11.890 
most Muslim is it that I make is does
demand<00:02:09.280> attention<00:02:10.280> so<00:02:11.150> you<00:02:11.210> have<00:02:11.510> to<00:02:11.660> sort<00:02:11.810> of

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:11.900 
demand attention so you have to sort of

00:02:11.900 --> 00:02:14.250 
demand attention so you have to sort of
sit<00:02:12.170> there<00:02:12.380> and<00:02:12.560> use<00:02:12.830> the<00:02:12.860> ears<00:02:13.250> in<00:02:13.520> a<00:02:13.610> kind<00:02:13.820> of

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:14.260 
sit there and use the ears in a kind of

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:17.110 
sit there and use the ears in a kind of
positive<00:02:15.260> way<00:02:15.950> to<00:02:16.010> actually<00:02:16.490> sort<00:02:16.790> of<00:02:16.820> you

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:17.120 
positive way to actually sort of you

00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:19.690 
positive way to actually sort of you
have<00:02:17.210> to<00:02:17.330> go<00:02:17.480> to<00:02:17.540> the<00:02:17.810> music<00:02:17.990> it's<00:02:18.380> like<00:02:18.700> it's

00:02:19.690 --> 00:02:19.700 
have to go to the music it's like it's

00:02:19.700 --> 00:02:22.210 
have to go to the music it's like it's
often<00:02:20.060> complex<00:02:20.450> not<00:02:21.080> always<00:02:21.410> some<00:02:21.830> music<00:02:22.160> is

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.220 
often complex not always some music is

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:23.650 
often complex not always some music is
all<00:02:22.310> so<00:02:22.460> simple<00:02:22.730> that<00:02:22.910> I<00:02:23.090> do<00:02:23.150> I<00:02:23.420> mean<00:02:23.570> the

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:23.660 
all so simple that I do I mean the

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:26.230 
all so simple that I do I mean the
surface<00:02:24.080> tension<00:02:24.950> of<00:02:25.010> it<00:02:25.160> is<00:02:25.280> simple<00:02:25.670> but

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:26.240 
surface tension of it is simple but

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:27.580 
surface tension of it is simple but
other<00:02:26.420> music<00:02:26.810> like<00:02:26.990> the<00:02:27.140> stuff<00:02:27.350> that<00:02:27.500> I'm

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:27.590 
other music like the stuff that I'm

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:29.500 
other music like the stuff that I'm
doing<00:02:27.620> with<00:02:27.890> this<00:02:27.980> interactive<00:02:28.400> oak<00:02:28.550> can<00:02:29.000> can

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:29.510 
doing with this interactive oak can can

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:31.390 
doing with this interactive oak can can
be<00:02:29.630> quite<00:02:29.810> complex<00:02:30.200> I<00:02:30.440> like<00:02:30.680> prospects<00:02:31.160> things

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:31.400 
be quite complex I like prospects things

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.070 
be quite complex I like prospects things
we<00:02:31.730> live<00:02:31.940> in<00:02:32.030> a<00:02:32.090> complex<00:02:32.270> world<00:02:32.660> if<00:02:32.840> you<00:02:32.930> don't

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:33.080 
we live in a complex world if you don't

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:34.750 
we live in a complex world if you don't
like<00:02:33.470> complexity<00:02:34.100> will<00:02:34.280> you<00:02:34.400> shouldn't<00:02:34.670> be

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
like complexity will you shouldn't be

00:02:34.760 --> 00:03:43.080 
like complexity will you shouldn't be
alive<00:02:34.940> today<00:02:35.180> you<00:02:35.330> should

00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:43.090 

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:45.870 

so<00:03:44.090> after<00:03:44.300> this<00:03:44.390> I'm<00:03:44.600> playing<00:03:44.870> next<00:03:45.260> in

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:45.880 
so after this I'm playing next in

00:03:45.880 --> 00:03:48.670 
so after this I'm playing next in
Tasmania<00:03:46.880> and<00:03:47.090> Hobart<00:03:47.780> for<00:03:48.110> the<00:03:48.170> Mona<00:03:48.440> FOMA

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:48.680 
Tasmania and Hobart for the Mona FOMA

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:51.760
