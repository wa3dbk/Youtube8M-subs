00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
 hello to all guys and well found by 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.670
 francesco siciliano the new noob's 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.830
 iphoneitalia.com web corner we have 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.960
 as always to discover some 

00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:11.400
 trick on our devices 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.380
 in this case we are going to see in 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:16.170
 this episode how do you figure out how many 

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:19.880
 cellular data are consuming which 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.880
 applications so let's start right away 

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:34.170
 then if we want to know what are the 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:36.480
 applications that consume more data 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.160
 cell phone maybe to reduce i 

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.350
 consumption to fit into ours 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.810
 monthly offer we can do so 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.860
 very simple from our system 

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:48.540
 cooperative then dario and let's go into 

00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:51.030
 settings as we do in short of 

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:53.070
 usual in this kind of troupe of 

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:55.230
 in short, a column that shows some 

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:57.980
 let's go into the section 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:01:01.560
 mobile and from here we will have available 

00:00:57.980 --> 00:01:03.150
 all our applications here 

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:05.309
 I had already shown this menu for 

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:07.440
 enable disable the cellular network 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:09.060
 for certain applications then if 

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:11.610
 I don't want to use the cellular network 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:13.740
 for example facebook I decide not to 

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:15.509
 use it and so on 

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.899
 instead from here I show you also that 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:20.940
 we can see how much we have consumed 

00:01:17.899 --> 00:01:22.410
 of this network of our network 

00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:25.110
 mobile for these applications 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:26.670
 obviously these are all statistics 

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.190
 that I've never reset since January 21st 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:32.429
 2015 and are statistics that concern 

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:34.679
 obviously only the use under the network 

00:01:32.429 --> 00:01:37.470
 cellular because obviously under the net 

00:01:34.679 --> 00:01:38.970
 wifi does not count this data 

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:41.280
 then here we find out for example that good 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.770
 step has consumed me 5 mediaset that 

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:45.390
 amazon and consumed 30 27 that app store e 

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.100
 he even consumed a jig and 1 

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.300
 in short, in this way we can understand 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.890
 what are the applications maybe from 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:52.050
 use less under cellular network 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.640
 to be included in our offer e 

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:55.560
 wanting as I had already shown you 

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:57.569
 in another in another noob's corner 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:02:01.140
 also go to disable the network 

00:01:57.569 --> 00:02:02.429
 cell phone for that kind of word 

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.349
 application we can also see 

00:02:02.429 --> 00:02:06.720
 how much they have consumed the apps since 

00:02:04.349 --> 00:02:08.130
 we have uninstalled and how much not 

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.259
 consumed system services going 

00:02:08.130 --> 00:02:12.660
 also to read what the services of 

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:14.610
 system that consumed certain 

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:17.520
 things and then of course we can reset 

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:19.290
 statistics to resume from scratch goes 

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.150
 good guys with this episode of 

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:22.770
 noob's corner we finished 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:23.370
 thank you for watching this 

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:24.660
 video

 we will meet again with the next episodes 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.870
 with all the tricks the tips for 

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:29.640
 make best use of the iPhone

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:39.140
