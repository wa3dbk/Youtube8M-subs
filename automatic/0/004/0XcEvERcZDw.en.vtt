00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049 
FPS so that's exactly what you would

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:43.190 
FPS so that's exactly what you would
want<00:01:40.290> for<00:01:40.740> a<00:01:40.799> side<00:01:41.369> arm<00:01:41.400> because<00:01:42.060> 320<00:01:42.750> FPS<00:01:42.840> is

00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:43.200 
want for a side arm because 320 FPS is

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.080 
want for a side arm because 320 FPS is
good<00:01:43.439> it's<00:01:44.070> completely<00:01:44.520> metal<00:01:44.790> which<00:01:44.880> means

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:45.090 
good it's completely metal which means

00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.240 
good it's completely metal which means
it's<00:01:45.299> going<00:01:45.390> to<00:01:45.479> be<00:01:45.570> pretty<00:01:45.659> hard<00:01:45.899> to<00:01:45.960> break

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:46.250 
it's going to be pretty hard to break

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:48.859 
it's going to be pretty hard to break
spring<00:01:47.250> they<00:01:47.790> don't<00:01:47.970> have<00:01:48.090> many<00:01:48.270> parts<00:01:48.630> that

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
spring they don't have many parts that

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.810 
spring they don't have many parts that
do<00:01:49.049> break<00:01:49.350> so<00:01:49.710> yeah<00:01:49.920> that<00:01:50.189> would<00:01:50.280> be<00:01:50.310> a<00:01:50.399> really

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:50.820 
do break so yeah that would be a really
