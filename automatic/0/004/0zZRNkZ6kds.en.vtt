okay<00:00:06.299> here's<00:00:06.540> a<00:00:06.600> quick<00:00:06.899> pitch<00:00:07.170> this<00:00:07.799> is<00:00:08.040> a<00:00:08.719> DD

00:00:09.709 --> 00:00:09.719 
okay here's a quick pitch this is a DD

00:00:09.719 --> 00:00:13.160 
okay here's a quick pitch this is a DD
tarps<00:00:10.700> DD<00:00:11.700> hammocks<00:00:12.150> I<00:00:12.300> guess<00:00:12.509> makes<00:00:12.750> us<00:00:12.960> their

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
tarps DD hammocks I guess makes us their

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.750 
tarps DD hammocks I guess makes us their
large<00:00:13.559> tarp<00:00:14.130> 4<00:00:15.000> meters<00:00:15.360> by<00:00:15.540> 4<00:00:15.839> meters<00:00:16.230> so

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:16.760 
large tarp 4 meters by 4 meters so

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:19.550 
large tarp 4 meters by 4 meters so
here's<00:00:17.760> a<00:00:17.880> quick<00:00:18.359> pitch<00:00:18.630> with<00:00:18.930> it<00:00:19.109> I've<00:00:19.529> just

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:19.560 
here's a quick pitch with it I've just

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.560 
here's a quick pitch with it I've just
been<00:00:19.770> playing<00:00:20.130> around<00:00:20.310> today<00:00:20.760> with<00:00:21.000> them<00:00:21.240> it's

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:21.570 
been playing around today with them it's

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:23.029 
been playing around today with them it's
a<00:00:21.660> much<00:00:21.810> bigger<00:00:22.080> tarp<00:00:22.439> that<00:00:22.500> I'm<00:00:22.740> used<00:00:22.949> to

00:00:23.029 --> 00:00:23.039 
a much bigger tarp that I'm used to

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:25.340 
a much bigger tarp that I'm used to
using<00:00:23.279> so<00:00:24.269> I<00:00:24.300> was<00:00:24.510> just<00:00:24.539> playing<00:00:24.960> around<00:00:25.109> with

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:25.350 
using so I was just playing around with

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:28.359 
using so I was just playing around with
a<00:00:25.439> bunch<00:00:25.590> of<00:00:25.740> different<00:00:26.039> pitches<00:00:26.279> for<00:00:26.730> it<00:00:26.910> and

00:00:28.359 --> 00:00:28.369 
a bunch of different pitches for it and

00:00:28.369 --> 00:00:32.089 
a bunch of different pitches for it and
you<00:00:29.369> can<00:00:29.580> build<00:00:29.730> a<00:00:30.859> significantly<00:00:31.859> more

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
you can build a significantly more

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.940 
you can build a significantly more
substantial<00:00:32.850> shelter<00:00:33.630> with<00:00:33.840> it<00:00:34.020> so<00:00:34.380> the

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:34.950 
substantial shelter with it so the

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:36.620 
substantial shelter with it so the
design<00:00:35.160> that<00:00:35.489> I've<00:00:35.610> come<00:00:36.030> up<00:00:36.090> with<00:00:36.239> that<00:00:36.540> I

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630 
design that I've come up with that I

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.780 
design that I've come up with that I
kind<00:00:36.870> of<00:00:36.899> like<00:00:37.079> the<00:00:37.260> most<00:00:37.559> is<00:00:37.920> so<00:00:38.520> I<00:00:38.550> basically

00:00:38.780 --> 00:00:38.790 
kind of like the most is so I basically

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.299 
kind of like the most is so I basically
take<00:00:39.300> one<00:00:39.540> half<00:00:39.780> of<00:00:39.899> the<00:00:39.960> tarp<00:00:40.260> and<00:00:40.649> use<00:00:40.890> it<00:00:41.129> as

00:00:41.299 --> 00:00:41.309 
take one half of the tarp and use it as

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:44.450 
take one half of the tarp and use it as
the<00:00:41.760> floor<00:00:42.090> and<00:00:42.480> then<00:00:43.230> the<00:00:43.710> second<00:00:44.160> half<00:00:44.309> of

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:44.460 
the floor and then the second half of

00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:47.600 
the floor and then the second half of
the<00:00:44.550> tarp<00:00:44.760> I<00:00:44.940> pull<00:00:45.539> fold<00:00:46.140> over<00:00:46.379> and<00:00:46.800> then<00:00:47.340> guy

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:47.610 
the tarp I pull fold over and then guy

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:49.549 
the tarp I pull fold over and then guy
it<00:00:47.670> up<00:00:47.969> by<00:00:48.239> the<00:00:48.300> tie<00:00:48.780> up<00:00:48.960> points<00:00:49.320> on<00:00:49.440> the

00:00:49.549 --> 00:00:49.559 
it up by the tie up points on the

00:00:49.559 --> 00:00:52.549 
it up by the tie up points on the
ridgeline<00:00:49.739> and<00:00:50.420> basically<00:00:51.420> make<00:00:51.719> a<00:00:51.750> nice

00:00:52.549 --> 00:00:52.559 
ridgeline and basically make a nice

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.160 
ridgeline and basically make a nice
shelter<00:00:52.829> with<00:00:53.160> a<00:00:53.190> floor<00:00:53.550> or<00:00:53.579> so<00:00:54.000> it's<00:00:54.870> similar

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:55.170 
shelter with a floor or so it's similar

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.920 
shelter with a floor or so it's similar
to<00:00:55.320> a<00:00:55.530> plow<00:00:55.829> point<00:00:56.190> but<00:00:56.640> you<00:00:56.760> can<00:00:56.940> see<00:00:57.210> I've<00:00:57.870> got

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:57.930 
to a plow point but you can see I've got

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.250 
to a plow point but you can see I've got
a<00:00:58.170> floor<00:00:58.530> in<00:00:58.770> the<00:00:58.890> entire<00:00:59.219> shelter<00:00:59.820> and<00:01:00.629> it's

00:01:01.250 --> 00:01:01.260 
a floor in the entire shelter and it's

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:06.880 
a floor in the entire shelter and it's
pretty<00:01:01.469> good<00:01:01.710> size<00:01:02.090> I'm<00:01:03.090> gonna<00:01:03.589> go<00:01:04.589> in<00:01:04.799> it<00:01:04.830> I

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:06.890 
pretty good size I'm gonna go in it I

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:09.679 
pretty good size I'm gonna go in it I
don't<00:01:07.890> know<00:01:08.010> when<00:01:08.220> you<00:01:08.369> this<00:01:08.549> is<00:01:08.729> coming<00:01:09.600> on

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
don't know when you this is coming on

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:14.480 
don't know when you this is coming on
the<00:01:09.780> freaking<00:01:10.049> camera<00:01:10.200> or<00:01:10.530> not<00:01:10.710> but<00:01:13.490> basically

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
the freaking camera or not but basically

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:17.420 
the freaking camera or not but basically
I'm<00:01:14.760> laying<00:01:15.060> in<00:01:15.240> here<00:01:15.390> diagonal<00:01:16.080> and<00:01:16.320> I've<00:01:17.220> got

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:17.430 
I'm laying in here diagonal and I've got

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:20.090 
I'm laying in here diagonal and I've got
plenty<00:01:17.700> of<00:01:17.790> room<00:01:18.119> so<00:01:18.960> I<00:01:18.990> could<00:01:19.320> have<00:01:19.530> a<00:01:19.619> little

00:01:20.090 --> 00:01:20.100 
plenty of room so I could have a little

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:21.859 
plenty of room so I could have a little
bit<00:01:20.280> of<00:01:20.310> a<00:01:20.430> fire<00:01:20.670> out<00:01:20.939> the<00:01:21.090> front<00:01:21.330> of<00:01:21.390> this<00:01:21.570> and

00:01:21.859 --> 00:01:21.869 
bit of a fire out the front of this and

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.730 
bit of a fire out the front of this and
I<00:01:23.180> think<00:01:24.180> it'd<00:01:24.270> be<00:01:24.390> a<00:01:24.420> pretty<00:01:25.200> decent<00:01:25.650> little

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
I think it'd be a pretty decent little

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:29.030 
I think it'd be a pretty decent little
shelter<00:01:26.220> so<00:01:26.750> this<00:01:27.750> is<00:01:27.780> like<00:01:28.259> I<00:01:28.320> said<00:01:28.680> the<00:01:28.829> first

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:29.040 
shelter so this is like I said the first

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:30.230 
shelter so this is like I said the first
time<00:01:29.250> I've<00:01:29.400> really<00:01:29.430> been<00:01:29.759> playing<00:01:30.060> around

00:01:30.230 --> 00:01:30.240 
time I've really been playing around

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:32.960 
time I've really been playing around
with<00:01:30.420> this<00:01:30.570> bigger<00:01:30.869> tarp<00:01:31.259> so<00:01:31.650> I<00:01:31.920> am<00:01:32.400> going<00:01:32.670> to

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
with this bigger tarp so I am going to

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.899 
with this bigger tarp so I am going to
try<00:01:33.750> an<00:01:33.869> overnighter<00:01:34.409> and<00:01:34.740> I<00:01:34.799> think<00:01:35.040> I'll<00:01:35.250> try

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
try an overnighter and I think I'll try

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.670 
try an overnighter and I think I'll try
this<00:01:35.970> pitch<00:01:36.360> a<00:01:36.509> couple<00:01:36.810> of<00:01:36.900> times<00:01:37.049> and<00:01:37.320> see<00:01:37.530> how

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:37.680 
this pitch a couple of times and see how

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:43.069 
this pitch a couple of times and see how
it<00:01:37.799> works<00:01:40.880> do<00:01:41.880> a<00:01:41.909> little<00:01:42.090> walk<00:01:42.360> around<00:01:42.390> on<00:01:42.899> it

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:43.079 
it works do a little walk around on it

00:01:43.079 --> 00:01:48.080 
it works do a little walk around on it
this<00:01:43.530> is<00:01:43.740> the<00:01:43.950> front<00:01:44.250> of<00:01:44.399> the<00:01:44.460> shelter<00:01:44.640> I<00:01:47.090> think

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:48.090 
this is the front of the shelter I think

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:49.580 
this is the front of the shelter I think
this<00:01:48.240> is<00:01:48.299> showing<00:01:48.630> up<00:01:48.869> you<00:01:49.049> can<00:01:49.229> see<00:01:49.439> I've

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
this is showing up you can see I've

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:52.069 
this is showing up you can see I've
folded<00:01:49.890> over<00:01:50.159> half<00:01:50.520> of<00:01:50.670> the<00:01:50.759> tarp<00:01:51.030> and<00:01:51.689> doubled

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:52.079 
folded over half of the tarp and doubled

00:01:52.079 --> 00:01:53.780 
folded over half of the tarp and doubled
it<00:01:52.170> back<00:01:52.320> under<00:01:52.710> and<00:01:52.740> it's<00:01:52.979> become<00:01:53.340> the<00:01:53.490> floor

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
it back under and it's become the floor

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.830 
it back under and it's become the floor
in<00:01:54.030> there<00:01:55.790> basically<00:01:56.790> tying<00:01:57.210> off<00:01:57.450> from<00:01:57.689> the

00:01:57.830 --> 00:01:57.840 
in there basically tying off from the

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:04.660 
in there basically tying off from the
ridge<00:01:58.049> line<00:02:00.469> to<00:02:01.469> get<00:02:01.619> my<00:02:01.680> height<00:02:02.100> and<00:02:02.630> then

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 
ridge line to get my height and then

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.030 
ridge line to get my height and then
kind<00:02:05.450> of<00:02:05.509> use<00:02:05.689> some<00:02:05.869> rocks<00:02:06.140> to<00:02:06.470> stake<00:02:06.680> out<00:02:06.890> the

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:07.040 
kind of use some rocks to stake out the

00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:12.820 
kind of use some rocks to stake out the
corners<00:02:08.619> and<00:02:09.619> I<00:02:10.069> carry<00:02:10.399> six<00:02:11.360> titanium<00:02:11.900> pegs<00:02:12.440> in

00:02:12.820 --> 00:02:12.830 
corners and I carry six titanium pegs in

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:19.870 
corners and I carry six titanium pegs in
my<00:02:13.090> inch<00:02:14.090> pack<00:02:14.420> so<00:02:18.130> but<00:02:19.130> it's<00:02:19.250> fairly<00:02:19.489> tight

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:19.880
