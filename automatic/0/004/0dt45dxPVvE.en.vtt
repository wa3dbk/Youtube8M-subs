00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:26.460
 eight centimeters 11 14 to 17 

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:29.369
 centimeters here are such a plate 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.380
 up to 17 centimeters that is, here it is 

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:34.170
 here plastinochka 

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:35.010
 11 centimeters long by 4 such 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.340
 large 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:44.899
 the LED let's open let's see they 

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:47.640
 very simple all done here 

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:52.140
 here are two ordinary metal 

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:56.809
 aluminum one plate and the second one 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:58.309
 two plates go to them like that 

00:00:56.809 --> 00:01:02.480
 stickies 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:06.840
 cut cut by level length 

00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:09.570
 this plate and you can stick it somewhere 

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:14.189
 holding tight enough water not 

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:17.720
 afraid of everything here is hermetically done to 

00:01:14.189 --> 00:01:20.549
 the same manufacturer gives practically what 

00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:22.860
 this construction see how it is here 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:28.140
 soldered or how is it done here 

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:30.720
 She does not get water there so now 

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:33.780
 I just want to see how it is 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:36.390
 bright lights because I say it again 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:40.110
 manufacturer and seller writes that very 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:41.159
 bright lighting on quite bright then 

00:01:40.110 --> 00:01:43.499
 there is 

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:45.630
 see of course the car will be far away 

00:01:43.499 --> 00:01:47.969
 we all understand that this is certainly a collective farm 

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:49.859
 this is not state running lights 

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:51.450
 where made to steal beautifully neat 

00:01:49.859 --> 00:01:56.149
 to every car 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:59.520
 but for lack of any lights at all 

00:01:56.149 --> 00:02:01.859
 you can do with this here option for 

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:04.709
 400 rubles to make running lights than 

00:02:01.859 --> 00:02:07.369
 let's burn xenon and biksenon and so 

00:02:04.709 --> 00:02:10.349
 further there is one of the options 

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:13.250
 but now we will see how much 

00:02:10.349 --> 00:02:17.129
 bright do not burn 

00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:19.260
 if here I see that the design is not 

00:02:17.129 --> 00:02:20.730
 very strong here so that's even possible 

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:22.890
 say hiley yes that's just 

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:25.349
 wires so here he sticks out under 

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:28.140
 Cable here can certainly fill 

00:02:25.349 --> 00:02:34.140
 sealant to generally ships moisture not 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:36.150
 I fell so I have here such here 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.870
 the device i made is unpretentious for 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:40.170
 checks 

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:44.180
 here you can see it 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:48.420
 here is the glow 

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:50.819
 This is the glow this strip gives 

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:53.250
 Enough, see, see, yes, enough 

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:55.230
 anchor here and so they of course she will 

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:57.120
 if you connect and from on the machine from 

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:59.669
 battery it will burn enough 

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:03.750
 bright you see for yourself I don't know passes 

00:02:59.669 --> 00:03:06.030
 is there a camcorder but i'm telling you that here 

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:10.380
 very bright glow here at the maximum 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:11.690
 made maxi you that is illuminates very 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:03:14.310
 OK 

00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:17.700
 up to 100 bytes can be seen of course enough 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:22.310
 far is the glow so 1 we have 

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:28.739

00:03:28.739 --> 00:03:38.269
 Works it is clear here please do on 

00:03:34.139 --> 00:03:42.419
 maximum brightness everything burns functioning 

00:03:38.269 --> 00:03:44.970
 so that if someone is interested here 

00:03:42.419 --> 00:03:49.019
