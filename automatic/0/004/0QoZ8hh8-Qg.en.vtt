00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:10.740
 Hello good day 

00:00:08.849 --> 00:00:12.960
 it is still raining a lot in the south of 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.269
 Brazil and in the west of Amazonia on 

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:17.760
 June 2005 tries loaded clouds 

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:20.279
 they should cause thunderstorms with high winds 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:22.410
 strong this afternoon in those regions 

00:00:20.279 --> 00:00:24.330
 The reason for all this rain is 

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.189
 transport of hot and humid air into 

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:28.680
 to these areas 

00:00:26.189 --> 00:00:30.810
 in a few days the accumulated rainfall should 

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.399
 exceed the average expected for the whole 

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:34.829
 month which increases the risk of flooding 

00:00:32.399 --> 00:00:36.630
 and also from floods 

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.070
 already in the northeast of the country and in 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:40.890
 amazon the scenario is completely 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:43.140
 different the time it is dry without 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:46.050
 possibility of rain the drought already lasts 

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:48.719
 months in some regions and we will have more 

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:51.600
 a hot day in Brazil today is hot 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:54.230
 of more than 30 degrees in much of the country 

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:56.760
 although we are already close to winter 

00:00:54.230 --> 00:00:59.489
 this weather forecast you can 

00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.350
 see in 2050 the emission of effect gases 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:03.570
 keep changing the climate in the 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.790
 brazil change specialists 

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:08.340
 that extreme events 

00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:10.950
 how heavy rains could become 

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.869
 more common in the next decades but 

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:15.540
 now in 2014 

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:18.270
 We're already missing events with 

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:20.549
 This one at the end of southern Brazil was 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.610
 affected by heavy rainfall in the 

00:01:20.549 --> 00:01:25.890
 of paraná 150 cities entered state 

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:28.590
 emergency three decreed calamity 

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.780
 in just three days rained the 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.119
 triple the historical average of the month 

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:35.549
 eleven people died houses and bridges 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:37.229
 were dragged by rain and many 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:40.829
 they lost everything they had 

00:01:37.229 --> 00:01:42.899
 the loss was millions of dollars 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:45.509
 average temperature in brazil also 

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:47.159
 has risen in the last century 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:49.890
 for specialists, the increase was 

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:51.390
 about one degree of the scenarios estimates 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.820
 that in the coming decades 

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:54.960
 this increase exceeds 4 degrees in the 

00:01:53.820 --> 00:01:56.579
 Brazil 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:58.740
 I talked to the researcher and 

00:01:56.579 --> 00:02:01.500
 José María Marengo on the impacts 

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.840
 of climate change in Brazil 

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:05.790
 hello teacher we see that has some 

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.890
 expected impacts some events 

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.729
 for Brazil, which would be 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.959
 these events 

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:15.849
 the tropical basically all of brazil 

00:02:12.959 --> 00:02:18.010
 to temperature increases at the end of 

00:02:15.849 --> 00:02:19.030
 century we can exceed 4 degrees 

00:02:18.010 --> 00:02:21.849
 centigrade 

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:24.819
 jean terms of rain the pattern changes one 

00:02:21.849 --> 00:02:27.280
 projections show a reduction of 

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:31.390
 rainfall in the eastern Amazon and in the 

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:33.780
 and rising rainfall in the west of 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:35.980
 amazon and in the extreme south of brazil 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:39.060
 because we are already seeing this type 

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:41.409
 event here occur the events one 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:43.840
 the result of global warming 

00:02:41.409 --> 00:02:46.959
 global warming and the championship bi and 

00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:49.090
 all this and murderers and paulo not only the 

00:02:46.959 --> 00:02:51.400
 Brasilia and the teacher took it. 

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:53.879
 It means we have to act now. 

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:56.980
 not to win in the area in the future 

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:59.349
 Yes, exactly the answer has to be 

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:01.750
 immediate in the coming decades have to 

00:02:59.349 --> 00:03:03.400
 reach an international type agreement 

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:05.379
 kyoto protocol 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:08.019
 if you touch the graces and do this 

00:03:05.379 --> 00:03:10.650
 because reducing emissions is the only 

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:13.299
 way we can reduce the 

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:16.959
 reduce the impacts on the population but 

00:03:13.299 --> 00:03:18.819
 this is something that escapes the climate that has 

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:20.799
 what to be more with to govern themselves agreements 

00:03:18.819 --> 00:03:22.780
 and this has to be a 

00:03:20.799 --> 00:03:25.599
 commitment made by otherwise 

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:26.769
 to fix the teacher thank you later 

00:03:25.599 --> 00:03:29.880
 by the crisis 

00:03:26.769 --> 00:03:29.880
 Only I thank you

 even the death of these motorcycles 

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:56.390
 maybe global including cm x crazy
