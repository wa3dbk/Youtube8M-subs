the mid-face is an area that's often

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:07.760 
the mid-face is an area that's often
overlooked<00:00:06.390> in<00:00:06.509> facial<00:00:06.690> rejuvenation<00:00:07.020> and

there's a lot of approaches through
rejuvenating<00:00:09.630> the<00:00:09.660> mid-face<00:00:10.110> everything

00:00:10.669 --> 00:00:10.679 
rejuvenating the mid-face everything

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:12.499 
rejuvenating the mid-face everything
from<00:00:10.950> filling<00:00:11.280> the<00:00:11.370> nasolabial<00:00:11.730> fold<00:00:12.210> in

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
from filling the nasolabial fold in

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:13.850 
from filling the nasolabial fold in
which<00:00:12.690> the<00:00:12.809> filler<00:00:13.019> companies<00:00:13.410> really<00:00:13.620> like

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:13.860 
which the filler companies really like

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:16.670 
which the filler companies really like
to<00:00:14.009> advertise<00:00:14.280> to<00:00:14.730> lifting<00:00:15.660> that<00:00:15.809> area<00:00:16.139> the

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:16.680 
to advertise to lifting that area the

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:18.380 
to advertise to lifting that area the
mid-face<00:00:17.039> lies<00:00:17.340> between<00:00:17.640> the<00:00:17.850> corner<00:00:18.270> of<00:00:18.300> the

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390 
mid-face lies between the corner of the

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:19.939 
mid-face lies between the corner of the
eye<00:00:18.600> and<00:00:18.960> the<00:00:19.020> corner<00:00:19.320> of<00:00:19.350> the<00:00:19.439> mouth<00:00:19.500> it

eye and the corner of the mouth it

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:23.240 
eye and the corner of the mouth it
includes<00:00:20.340> the<00:00:20.490> nasolabial<00:00:20.970> fold<00:00:21.480> so<00:00:22.250> one

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.250 
includes the nasolabial fold so one

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.310 
includes the nasolabial fold so one
approach<00:00:23.369> that<00:00:23.789> rejuvenating<00:00:24.689> this<00:00:24.810> area<00:00:25.140> is

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
approach that rejuvenating this area is

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.560 
approach that rejuvenating this area is
to<00:00:25.500> fill<00:00:25.740> the<00:00:25.890> nasolabial<00:00:26.250> fold<00:00:26.760> the<00:00:27.180> problem

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
to fill the nasolabial fold the problem

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:29.300 
to fill the nasolabial fold the problem
is<00:00:27.689> that's<00:00:27.930> not<00:00:28.109> a<00:00:28.140> totally<00:00:28.529> natural<00:00:28.710> approach

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:29.310 
is that's not a totally natural approach

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:31.580 
is that's not a totally natural approach
because<00:00:30.000> the<00:00:30.119> nasolabial<00:00:30.539> fold<00:00:30.960> exists

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
because the nasolabial fold exists

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:32.959 
because the nasolabial fold exists
because<00:00:31.800> there's<00:00:32.099> actually<00:00:32.399> two<00:00:32.550> muscles

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
because there's actually two muscles

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.000 
because there's actually two muscles
that<00:00:33.090> run<00:00:33.239> from<00:00:33.480> the<00:00:33.630> corner<00:00:33.840> up<00:00:34.410> here<00:00:34.590> all

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:35.010 
that run from the corner up here all

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:37.220 
that run from the corner up here all
which<00:00:35.340> is<00:00:35.550> to<00:00:35.910> the<00:00:35.940> skin<00:00:36.329> in<00:00:36.480> that<00:00:36.540> area<00:00:36.630> and

00:00:37.220 --> 00:00:37.230 
which is to the skin in that area and

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:38.840 
which is to the skin in that area and
when<00:00:37.350> you<00:00:37.440> smile<00:00:37.739> it<00:00:37.980> pulls<00:00:38.250> up<00:00:38.399> the<00:00:38.430> corner<00:00:38.820> of

00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:38.850 
when you smile it pulls up the corner of

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:40.369 
when you smile it pulls up the corner of
your<00:00:38.940> mouth<00:00:39.059> so<00:00:39.780> if<00:00:39.870> you<00:00:39.960> look<00:00:40.200> at<00:00:40.350> a

00:00:40.369 --> 00:00:40.379 
your mouth so if you look at a

00:00:40.379 --> 00:00:41.959 
your mouth so if you look at a
three-year-old<00:00:40.950> they<00:00:41.309> have<00:00:41.489> a<00:00:41.520> nasal<00:00:41.760> a

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
three-year-old they have a nasal a

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:44.180 
three-year-old they have a nasal a
beautiful<00:00:42.390> and<00:00:42.570> exists<00:00:43.050> throughout<00:00:43.320> life<00:00:43.620> the

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:44.190 
beautiful and exists throughout life the

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:45.889 
beautiful and exists throughout life the
other<00:00:44.370> kosher<00:00:44.820> rejuvenating<00:00:45.480> the<00:00:45.510> mid-face

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:45.899 
other kosher rejuvenating the mid-face

00:00:45.899 --> 00:00:48.440 
other kosher rejuvenating the mid-face
is<00:00:46.110> to<00:00:46.260> lift<00:00:46.500> that<00:00:46.649> area<00:00:46.980> well<00:00:47.520> it<00:00:47.969> isn't<00:00:48.180> that

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
is to lift that area well it isn't that

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.840 
is to lift that area well it isn't that
the<00:00:48.539> mid-face<00:00:48.840> fell<00:00:49.260> the<00:00:49.739> reality<00:00:50.250> is<00:00:50.399> what

00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:50.850 
the mid-face fell the reality is what

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.060 
the mid-face fell the reality is what
happens<00:00:51.210> is<00:00:51.420> the<00:00:51.510> mid-face<00:00:51.719> deflate<00:00:52.350> so<00:00:52.949> if

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
happens is the mid-face deflate so if

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.619 
happens is the mid-face deflate so if
you<00:00:53.160> think<00:00:53.430> of<00:00:53.550> a<00:00:53.610> youthful<00:00:54.030> face<00:00:54.239> is<00:00:54.420> more

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
you think of a youthful face is more

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.660 
you think of a youthful face is more
like<00:00:54.809> a<00:00:54.840> grape<00:00:55.199> what<00:00:55.770> happens<00:00:56.160> is<00:00:56.280> that<00:00:56.309> great

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:56.670 
like a grape what happens is that great

00:00:56.670 --> 00:00:58.490 
like a grape what happens is that great
losses<00:00:56.879> volume<00:00:57.480> and<00:00:57.719> becomes<00:00:58.020> more<00:00:58.289> like<00:00:58.469> a

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
losses volume and becomes more like a

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.069 
losses volume and becomes more like a
raisin<00:00:58.800> so<00:00:59.550> if<00:00:59.670> you<00:00:59.789> pull<00:01:00.059> that<00:01:00.420> raisin<00:01:00.840> tight

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079 
raisin so if you pull that raisin tight

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.750 
raisin so if you pull that raisin tight
you<00:01:01.590> don't<00:01:01.739> get<00:01:01.890> a<00:01:01.949> great<00:01:02.129> you<00:01:02.370> just<00:01:02.430> get<00:01:02.730> a

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
you don't get a great you just get a

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.479 
you don't get a great you just get a
tight<00:01:03.000> looking<00:01:03.449> raise<00:01:03.629> it<00:01:03.809> and<00:01:03.989> so<00:01:04.680> to<00:01:05.129> truly

00:01:05.479 --> 00:01:05.489 
tight looking raise it and so to truly

00:01:05.489 --> 00:01:07.670 
tight looking raise it and so to truly
rejuvenate<00:01:06.030> the<00:01:06.180> mid-face<00:01:06.540> is<00:01:06.930> to<00:01:07.170> Reval<00:01:07.530> you

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:07.680 
rejuvenate the mid-face is to Reval you

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.370 
rejuvenate the mid-face is to Reval you
mais<00:01:07.860> the<00:01:08.070> mid-face<00:01:08.430> in<00:01:09.000> my<00:01:09.119> opinion<00:01:09.390> the<00:01:09.750> best

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380 
mais the mid-face in my opinion the best

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.109 
mais the mid-face in my opinion the best
way<00:01:10.590> to<00:01:10.650> rejuvenate<00:01:10.799> the<00:01:11.250> mid-face<00:01:11.640> is<00:01:11.939> to

00:01:12.109 --> 00:01:12.119 
way to rejuvenate the mid-face is to

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.330 
way to rejuvenate the mid-face is to
remit<00:01:12.420> face<00:01:12.630> implant<00:01:13.170> it's<00:01:13.470> a<00:01:13.590> soft<00:01:13.830> implant

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
remit face implant it's a soft implant

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:16.240 
remit face implant it's a soft implant
that's<00:01:14.760> placed<00:01:15.030> into<00:01:15.570> the<00:01:15.689> mouth<00:01:15.900> and

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:16.250 
that's placed into the mouth and

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:18.770 
that's placed into the mouth and
anchored<00:01:17.250> right<00:01:17.400> up<00:01:17.580> against<00:01:17.939> the<00:01:17.970> bone<00:01:18.210> now

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:18.780 
anchored right up against the bone now

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.080 
anchored right up against the bone now
once<00:01:19.080> it's<00:01:19.259> healed<00:01:19.530> it's<00:01:20.040> sealed<00:01:20.729> right<00:01:20.939> up

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:21.090 
once it's healed it's sealed right up

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.090 
once it's healed it's sealed right up
against<00:01:21.420> the<00:01:21.479> bone<00:01:21.720> so<00:01:22.170> even<00:01:22.470> if<00:01:22.560> you<00:01:22.680> feel<00:01:22.920> the

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:23.100 
against the bone so even if you feel the

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.130 
against the bone so even if you feel the
cheek<00:01:23.369> and<00:01:23.640> help<00:01:24.119> aid<00:01:24.299> firmly<00:01:24.600> you'll<00:01:24.900> never

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:25.140 
cheek and help aid firmly you'll never

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.469 
cheek and help aid firmly you'll never
feel<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:25.530> implant<00:01:25.860> and<00:01:26.159> the<00:01:26.850> best<00:01:27.000> part<00:01:27.150> of

00:01:27.469 --> 00:01:27.479 
feel the implant and the best part of

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:29.149 
feel the implant and the best part of
this<00:01:27.659> is<00:01:27.900> it's<00:01:28.170> a<00:01:28.290> totally<00:01:28.680> predictable

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
this is it's a totally predictable

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:31.190 
this is it's a totally predictable
solution<00:01:29.700> to<00:01:29.820> the<00:01:29.909> mid-face<00:01:30.270> you<00:01:30.869> pick<00:01:31.079> the

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.200 
solution to the mid-face you pick the

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:32.990 
solution to the mid-face you pick the
size<00:01:31.380> beforehand<00:01:32.070> you<00:01:32.400> can<00:01:32.549> even<00:01:32.640> pick<00:01:32.880> the

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:33.000 
size beforehand you can even pick the

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.450 
size beforehand you can even pick the
size<00:01:33.180> intraoperatively<00:01:33.810> and<00:01:34.470> that's<00:01:35.250> the

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460 
size intraoperatively and that's the

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:36.920 
size intraoperatively and that's the
size<00:01:35.640> that<00:01:35.790> you're<00:01:35.939> going<00:01:36.090> to<00:01:36.150> get<00:01:36.390> once<00:01:36.750> it's

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:36.930 
size that you're going to get once it's
