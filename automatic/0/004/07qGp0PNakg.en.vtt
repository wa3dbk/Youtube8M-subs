my<00:00:04.259> smoke<00:00:04.620> detectors<00:00:05.190> why<00:00:05.790> not<00:00:06.180> smoke

00:00:06.470 --> 00:00:06.480 
my smoke detectors why not smoke

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:08.299 
my smoke detectors why not smoke
detectors<00:00:06.990> that's<00:00:07.200> really<00:00:07.560> the<00:00:07.649> case<00:00:07.799> why

00:00:08.299 --> 00:00:08.309 
detectors that's really the case why

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:09.919 
detectors that's really the case why
hasn't<00:00:08.790> there<00:00:08.880> been<00:00:08.940> any<00:00:09.240> innovation<00:00:09.719> since

00:00:09.919 --> 00:00:09.929 
hasn't there been any innovation since

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:12.020 
hasn't there been any innovation since
the<00:00:10.139> 70s<00:00:10.740> and<00:00:10.889> smoke<00:00:11.130> detectors<00:00:11.580> as<00:00:11.700> far<00:00:11.849> as<00:00:11.969> I

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:12.030 
the 70s and smoke detectors as far as I

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:13.640 
the 70s and smoke detectors as far as I
can<00:00:12.090> tell<00:00:12.300> they<00:00:12.599> look<00:00:12.809> basically<00:00:13.049> the<00:00:13.469> same

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650

00:00:15.020 --> 00:00:15.030 
they do basically the same thing and

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:16.670 
they do basically the same thing and
they<00:00:15.299> annoy<00:00:15.599> you<00:00:15.660> the<00:00:15.990> same<00:00:16.230> as<00:00:16.379> they<00:00:16.470> did<00:00:16.650> in

you look at these things and a product

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.429 
you look at these things and a product
that's<00:00:26.550> mandated<00:00:27.119> by<00:00:27.269> in<00:00:27.510> every<00:00:27.930> single<00:00:28.199> state

in the Union and you have to have three
or<00:00:31.529> four<00:00:31.769> of<00:00:31.920> these<00:00:32.040> per<00:00:32.430> home<00:00:32.669> at<00:00:32.880> least

minimally<00:00:33.480> why<00:00:34.440> hasn't<00:00:35.040> there<00:00:35.160> been<00:00:35.219> more

00:00:35.569 --> 00:00:35.579 
minimally why hasn't there been more

00:00:35.579 --> 00:00:37.700 
minimally why hasn't there been more
innovation<00:00:36.090> in<00:00:36.180> this<00:00:36.329> area<00:00:36.480> why<00:00:37.170> hasn't<00:00:37.620> there

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:37.710 
innovation in this area why hasn't there

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:39.020 
innovation in this area why hasn't there
been<00:00:37.770> something<00:00:38.190> that<00:00:38.309> doesn't<00:00:38.670> wake<00:00:38.820> you<00:00:39.000> up

00:00:39.020 --> 00:00:39.030

in the middle of the night when the

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:40.819 
in the middle of the night when the
battery<00:00:40.350> is<00:00:40.379> low

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
battery is low

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.520 
battery is low
it<00:00:41.280> just<00:00:41.610> seemed<00:00:41.820> totally<00:00:42.210> obvious<00:00:42.360> to<00:00:42.629> us<00:00:42.719> can

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:43.530 
it just seemed totally obvious to us can

00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:45.560 
it just seemed totally obvious to us can

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
actually in 90 countries where we don't

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.010 
actually in 90 countries where we don't
even<00:00:56.550> sell<00:00:56.879> they're<00:00:57.180> less<00:00:57.480> Nest<00:00:57.870> Learning

00:00:58.010 --> 00:00:58.020 
even sell they're less Nest Learning

so<00:00:58.980> people<00:00:59.190> either<00:00:59.640> come<00:01:00.000> to<00:01:00.030> the<00:01:00.180> US<00:01:00.449> and<00:01:00.629> take

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
and the iPhone days the early days when

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:11.359 
and the iPhone days the early days when
they<00:01:10.590> weren't<00:01:10.799> available<00:01:10.979> in<00:01:11.220> those

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:19.890 
mean it's just still a little bit

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:21.620 
mean it's just still a little bit
unimaginable<00:01:20.430> to<00:01:20.549> me<00:01:20.640> to<00:01:20.820> compare<00:01:21.180> such<00:01:21.600> a

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630 
unimaginable to me to compare such a

00:01:21.630 --> 00:01:24.109 
unimaginable to me to compare such a
device<00:01:21.960> is<00:01:22.590> it<00:01:22.799> that<00:01:22.979> is<00:01:23.159> it<00:01:23.430> that<00:01:23.460> exciting<00:01:24.000> to

case of the the CEO detector and the

00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:38.180 
case of the the CEO detector and the
thermostat<00:04:36.030> what<00:04:36.479> happens<00:04:36.900> is<00:04:37.110> the<00:04:37.800> number

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:38.190 
thermostat what happens is the number

00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:41.330 
thermostat what happens is the number
one<00:04:38.370> cause<00:04:38.610> of<00:04:38.810> CEO<00:04:39.810> leaks<00:04:40.169> in<00:04:40.440> a<00:04:40.500> home<00:04:40.740> are<00:04:40.949> due

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:41.340 
one cause of CEO leaks in a home are due

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:43.520 
one cause of CEO leaks in a home are due
to<00:04:41.520> faulty<00:04:41.820> furnaces<00:04:42.539> something<00:04:43.169> is<00:04:43.289> broken

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:43.530 
to faulty furnaces something is broken

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:45.649 
to faulty furnaces something is broken
in<00:04:43.710> the<00:04:43.800> furnace<00:04:44.159> and<00:04:44.280> CEO<00:04:44.909> is<00:04:45.090> leaking<00:04:45.479> into

00:04:45.649 --> 00:04:45.659 
in the furnace and CEO is leaking into

00:04:45.659 --> 00:04:49.550 
in the furnace and CEO is leaking into
the<00:04:45.810> home<00:04:46.759> so<00:04:47.759> what<00:04:48.300> nest<00:04:48.539> protect<00:04:48.960> does<00:04:49.169> is<00:04:49.409> if

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:49.560 
the home so what nest protect does is if

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:53.960 
the home so what nest protect does is if
it<00:04:49.680> detects<00:04:50.250> a<00:04:50.659> co<00:04:51.659> leak<00:04:52.169> it<00:04:52.440> tells<00:04:53.340> a<00:04:53.580> nest

00:04:53.960 --> 00:04:53.970 
it detects a co leak it tells a nest

00:04:53.970 --> 00:04:56.210 
it detects a co leak it tells a nest
thermostat<00:04:54.509> in<00:04:54.659> the<00:04:54.750> same<00:04:54.930> home<00:04:55.169> to<00:04:55.620> turn<00:04:55.919> off

00:04:56.210 --> 00:04:56.220 
thermostat in the same home to turn off

00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:58.939 
thermostat in the same home to turn off
so<00:04:56.940> hopefully<00:04:57.599> we<00:04:57.810> get<00:04:57.930> the<00:04:58.110> number<00:04:58.470> one<00:04:58.650> leak

00:04:58.939 --> 00:04:58.949 
so hopefully we get the number one leak

00:04:58.949 --> 00:05:01.490 
so hopefully we get the number one leak
source<00:04:59.699> of<00:04:59.880> the<00:04:59.970> leak<00:05:00.150> in<00:05:00.330> the<00:05:00.690> home<00:05:00.840> shut<00:05:01.320> off

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:01.500 
source of the leak in the home shut off

00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:03.529 
source of the leak in the home shut off
