to<00:00:21.530> hold<00:00:21.650> back<00:00:21.860> the<00:00:22.130> filter<00:00:22.520> pad<00:00:22.730> we're<00:00:23.150> also

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:23.300 
to hold back the filter pad we're also

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.150 
to hold back the filter pad we're also
going<00:00:23.450> to<00:00:23.510> throw<00:00:23.630> that<00:00:23.810> in<00:00:23.990> there<00:00:24.170> this<00:00:25.040> is

obviously<00:00:57.979> that's<00:00:58.159> going<00:00:58.339> to<00:00:58.399> go<00:00:58.489> into<00:00:58.699> the

00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:58.850 
obviously that's going to go into the

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:01.989 
obviously that's going to go into the
other<00:00:58.969> right<00:00:59.390> these<00:01:00.379> pads<00:01:00.710> are<00:01:00.949> roughly<00:01:01.550> by<00:01:01.670> a

little<00:01:02.359> over<00:01:02.539> ten<00:01:02.719> bucks<00:01:02.989> for<00:01:03.109> six<00:01:03.440> of<00:01:03.559> them<00:01:03.739> so

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:04.010 
little over ten bucks for six of them so

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:04.930 
little over ten bucks for six of them so
it's<00:01:04.190> only<00:01:04.250> going<00:01:04.400> to<00:01:04.460> have<00:01:04.580> about<00:01:04.610> two

00:01:04.930 --> 00:01:04.940 
it's only going to have about two

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:07.870 
it's only going to have about two
dollars<00:01:05.110> to<00:01:06.110> your<00:01:06.260> total<00:01:06.680> batch<00:01:06.950> it's<00:01:07.550> got

great quality to it it's definitely

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:15.969 
great quality to it it's definitely

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:15.979 
cheaper than the pump filters the turbo

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:17.380 
cheaper than the pump filters the turbo
jet<00:01:16.100> and<00:01:16.430> the<00:01:16.490> super<00:01:16.850> jet<00:01:17.030> which<00:01:17.149> are<00:01:17.299> also

does<00:01:23.780> great<00:01:24.380> job<00:01:24.680> just<00:01:24.950> takes<00:01:25.189> a<00:01:25.490> bit<00:01:25.729> longer

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:25.930 
does great job just takes a bit longer

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:28.149 
does great job just takes a bit longer
but<00:01:26.930> I'm<00:01:27.049> to<00:01:27.140> say<00:01:27.289> how<00:01:27.439> long<00:01:27.619> it<00:01:27.799> takes<00:01:28.009> to

00:01:28.149 --> 00:01:28.159 
but I'm to say how long it takes to

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:30.069 
but I'm to say how long it takes to
filter<00:01:28.549> six<00:01:28.820> gallons<00:01:29.240> of<00:01:29.420> some<00:01:29.600> Concord<00:01:30.049> grape

filter six gallons of some Concord grape

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:35.219 
filter six gallons of some Concord grape

00:01:49.209 --> 00:01:49.219 
fibers to end up in your wine so we need

00:01:49.219 --> 00:01:51.340

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:16.490 
this is going to be pretty stable while

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:18.070 
this is going to be pretty stable while
this<00:05:16.669> is<00:05:16.789> all<00:05:16.910> going<00:05:16.970> down<00:05:17.419> I'm<00:05:17.780> going<00:05:17.840> to<00:05:17.990> do

this is all going down I'm going to do

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:19.300 
this is all going down I'm going to do
that<00:05:18.199> right<00:05:18.380> now<00:05:18.440> because<00:05:18.680> that's<00:05:18.979> actually

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:19.310 
that right now because that's actually

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:23.830 
that right now because that's actually
not<00:05:19.639> very<00:05:19.669> stable<00:05:20.060> at<00:05:20.330> the<00:05:20.389> moment<00:05:22.660> to<00:05:23.660> move

00:05:23.830 --> 00:05:23.840 
not very stable at the moment to move

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:33.550
