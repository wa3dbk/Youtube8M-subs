00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:02.550 
example of how I just I edited out the

00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.270 
example of how I just I edited out the
video<00:01:02.820> to<00:01:02.910> just<00:01:03.420> show<00:01:03.629> my<00:01:03.870> gameplay<00:01:04.379> and<00:01:04.680> then

00:01:05.270 --> 00:01:05.280 
video to just show my gameplay and then

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:07.520 
video to just show my gameplay and then
because<00:01:05.700> the<00:01:06.000> theater<00:01:06.600> mode<00:01:06.750> currently

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:07.530 
because the theater mode currently

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.630 
because the theater mode currently
anyway<00:01:07.860> doesn't<00:01:08.130> show<00:01:08.659> killcams<00:01:09.979> I<00:01:10.979> went<00:01:11.520> into

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:11.640 
anyway doesn't show killcams I went into

theater<00:01:11.970> mode<00:01:12.090> and<00:01:12.330> I<00:01:12.360> just<00:01:12.600> kind<00:01:12.750> of<00:01:12.780> showed

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:12.960 
theater mode and I just kind of showed

00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:14.210 
theater mode and I just kind of showed
it<00:01:13.080> from<00:01:13.200> different<00:01:13.350> points<00:01:13.619> of<00:01:13.799> view<00:01:13.979> so

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
it from different points of view so

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.039 
it from different points of view so
that's<00:01:14.430> what<00:01:14.610> I'm<00:01:14.700> doing<00:01:14.729> here<00:01:15.210> so<00:01:15.689> instead<00:01:15.990> of

00:01:16.039 --> 00:01:16.049 
that's what I'm doing here so instead of

00:01:16.049 --> 00:01:19.760 
that's what I'm doing here so instead of
this<00:01:16.259> being<00:01:17.090> you<00:01:18.090> know<00:01:18.210> 12<00:01:18.479> 15<00:01:18.960> minute<00:01:19.200> search

I think it is and I think it it

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:54.030 
I think it is and I think it it
artificially<00:02:51.490> pumps<00:02:51.910> up<00:02:52.090> your<00:02:52.690> kill<00:02:53.680> streak

and your KD and obviously that's the

00:02:57.220 --> 00:02:59.880 
and your KD and obviously that's the
goal<00:02:57.430> but<00:02:58.210> then<00:02:58.420> when<00:02:58.750> I<00:02:58.780> have<00:02:59.140> an<00:02:59.440> honest

00:02:59.880 --> 00:02:59.890

something<00:03:28.540> kind<00:03:28.690> of<00:03:28.720> weird<00:03:28.780> here<00:03:29.200> I<00:03:29.350> know<00:03:29.650> is

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:29.950 
something kind of weird here I know is

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:31.229 
something kind of weird here I know is
coming<00:03:30.160> from<00:03:30.220> this<00:03:30.400> direction<00:03:30.459> so<00:03:30.820> I<00:03:30.970> get<00:03:31.150> on

00:03:31.229 --> 00:03:31.239 
coming from this direction so I get on

00:03:31.239 --> 00:03:33.030 
coming from this direction so I get on
the<00:03:31.360> ground<00:03:31.540> and<00:03:31.989> I<00:03:32.320> just<00:03:32.560> kind<00:03:32.739> of<00:03:32.769> forget

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:33.040 
the ground and I just kind of forget

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:34.350 
the ground and I just kind of forget
that<00:03:33.250> this<00:03:33.370> thing<00:03:33.550> is<00:03:33.580> going<00:03:33.760> to<00:03:33.820> obscure<00:03:34.239> the

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:34.360 
that this thing is going to obscure the

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:38.580 
that this thing is going to obscure the
view<00:03:34.650> and<00:03:35.650> it<00:03:36.220> gets<00:03:36.340> in<00:03:36.519> the<00:03:36.550> way<00:03:36.730> and<00:03:37.440> you<00:03:38.440> know

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:38.590 
view and it gets in the way and you know

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:40.590 
view and it gets in the way and you know
who<00:03:39.430> knows<00:03:39.489> maybe<00:03:40.030> I<00:03:40.150> would<00:03:40.300> have<00:03:40.330> got<00:03:40.570> him

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:40.600 
who knows maybe I would have got him

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:42.390 
who knows maybe I would have got him
maybe<00:03:40.959> I<00:03:41.050> wouldn't<00:03:41.350> know<00:03:41.440> but<00:03:41.920> that<00:03:42.100> really

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:42.400 
maybe I wouldn't know but that really

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.160 
maybe I wouldn't know but that really
was<00:03:43.180> not<00:03:43.330> the<00:03:43.540> bright<00:03:43.810> the<00:03:44.110> best<00:03:44.380> move<00:03:44.620> for<00:03:45.280> me

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:46.170 
was not the bright the best move for me

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:52.320 
was not the bright the best move for me
so<00:03:47.170> there<00:03:47.350> is<00:03:47.380> an<00:03:47.620> interview<00:03:48.100> um<00:03:51.269> the<00:03:52.269> other

00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:52.330 
so there is an interview um the other

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:53.580 
so there is an interview um the other
thing<00:03:52.480> that<00:03:52.630> I've<00:03:52.840> been<00:03:52.930> doing<00:03:53.050> in<00:03:53.260> Search<00:03:53.470> and

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:53.590 
thing that I've been doing in Search and

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:54.900 
thing that I've been doing in Search and
Destroy<00:03:53.620> and<00:03:54.040> I<00:03:54.100> never<00:03:54.280> did<00:03:54.459> this<00:03:54.550> in<00:03:54.700> modern

00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:54.910 
Destroy and I never did this in modern

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:57.360 
Destroy and I never did this in modern
warfare<00:03:55.060> 2<00:03:55.420> and<00:03:56.260> I<00:03:56.470> think<00:03:56.709> this<00:03:56.860> game<00:03:57.100> lends

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:57.370 
warfare 2 and I think this game lends

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:59.580 
warfare 2 and I think this game lends
itself<00:03:57.730> to<00:03:57.850> it<00:03:58.120> is<00:03:58.300> that<00:03:58.510> this<00:03:59.080> is<00:03:59.170> based<00:03:59.440> on

00:03:59.580 --> 00:03:59.590 
itself to it is that this is based on

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:01.440 
itself to it is that this is based on
watching<00:03:59.980> a<00:04:00.040> bunch<00:04:00.190> of<00:04:00.280> extras<00:04:00.640> videos<00:04:01.120> and

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:01.450 
watching a bunch of extras videos and

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:03.600 
watching a bunch of extras videos and
his<00:04:02.080> search<00:04:02.350> and<00:04:02.530> destroy<00:04:02.650> technique<00:04:03.220> and<00:04:03.459> he

00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:03.610 
his search and destroy technique and he

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:08.460 
his search and destroy technique and he
rushes<00:04:04.390> a<00:04:04.420> lot<00:04:04.660> and<00:04:05.640> I<00:04:06.840> started<00:04:07.840> doing<00:04:07.930> it<00:04:08.200> and

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:08.470 
rushes a lot and I started doing it and

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:10.260 
rushes a lot and I started doing it and
typically<00:04:09.190> what<00:04:09.400> I<00:04:09.460> do

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:10.270 
typically what I do

00:04:10.270 --> 00:04:13.020 
typically what I do
is<00:04:10.360> in<00:04:10.720> a<00:04:10.810> lot<00:04:10.930> of<00:04:10.990> games<00:04:11.260> is<00:04:11.590> all<00:04:11.950> rush<00:04:12.220> maybe

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:13.030 
is in a lot of games is all rush maybe

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:16.290 
is in a lot of games is all rush maybe
the<00:04:13.270> first<00:04:14.280> few<00:04:15.280> minutes<00:04:15.430> of<00:04:15.670> the<00:04:15.820> game<00:04:15.850> and

00:04:16.290 --> 00:04:16.300 
the first few minutes of the game and

00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:19.590 
the first few minutes of the game and
then<00:04:17.110> I'll<00:04:17.230> switch<00:04:17.530> to<00:04:17.560> a<00:04:18.370> slightly<00:04:19.300> more

00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:19.600 
then I'll switch to a slightly more

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:21.780 
then I'll switch to a slightly more
defensive<00:04:20.320> class<00:04:20.620> like<00:04:20.920> an<00:04:21.130> assault<00:04:21.700> rifle

00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:21.790 
defensive class like an assault rifle

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:25.530 
defensive class like an assault rifle
and<00:04:22.380> then<00:04:23.380> I'll<00:04:23.590> move<00:04:23.880> ultimately<00:04:24.880> to<00:04:25.300> maybe

00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:25.540 
and then I'll move ultimately to maybe

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:28.950 
and then I'll move ultimately to maybe
something<00:04:26.260> really<00:04:26.500> stealthy<00:04:27.720> because<00:04:28.720> I<00:04:28.750> know

00:04:28.950 --> 00:04:28.960 
something really stealthy because I know

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:32.970 
something really stealthy because I know
from<00:04:29.230> my<00:04:29.290> own<00:04:29.440> gameplay<00:04:30.570> if<00:04:31.570> I<00:04:32.080> rush<00:04:32.470> and<00:04:32.770> I<00:04:32.830> get

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:32.980 
from my own gameplay if I rush and I get

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:34.560 
from my own gameplay if I rush and I get
that<00:04:33.010> adrenaline<00:04:33.340> going<00:04:33.880> and<00:04:34.150> I<00:04:34.240> just<00:04:34.390> keep

00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:34.570 
that adrenaline going and I just keep

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:35.700 
that adrenaline going and I just keep
running<00:04:34.720> and<00:04:34.930> running<00:04:34.990> running<00:04:35.320> I<00:04:35.470> start

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:35.710 
running and running running I start

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:37.230 
running and running running I start
making<00:04:35.800> mistakes<00:04:36.070> and<00:04:36.550> I<00:04:36.670> keep<00:04:36.850> thinking<00:04:37.210> that

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:37.240 
making mistakes and I keep thinking that

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:38.880 
making mistakes and I keep thinking that
I<00:04:37.360> can<00:04:37.540> make<00:04:37.660> up<00:04:37.690> for<00:04:37.810> if<00:04:38.080> I<00:04:38.200> just<00:04:38.410> rush<00:04:38.560> in<00:04:38.710> some

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:38.890 
I can make up for if I just rush in some

00:04:38.890 --> 00:04:40.800 
I can make up for if I just rush in some
more<00:04:39.100> and<00:04:39.370> I<00:04:39.790> really<00:04:40.060> just<00:04:40.240> need<00:04:40.390> to<00:04:40.420> slow<00:04:40.780> down

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:40.810 
more and I really just need to slow down

00:04:40.810 --> 00:04:43.380 
more and I really just need to slow down
a<00:04:41.410> little<00:04:41.890> bit<00:04:42.130> and<00:04:42.370> get<00:04:42.580> a<00:04:42.610> little<00:04:42.910> smarter

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:43.390 
a little bit and get a little smarter

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:46.230 
a little bit and get a little smarter
towards<00:04:43.750> the<00:04:43.870> end<00:04:44.020> of<00:04:44.350> the<00:04:44.620> game<00:04:44.890> I<00:04:45.340> don't<00:04:46.180> know

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:46.240 
towards the end of the game I don't know

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:49.110 
towards the end of the game I don't know
it<00:04:46.900> seems<00:04:47.080> to<00:04:47.200> work<00:04:47.320> for<00:04:47.500> me<00:04:47.680> do<00:04:48.430> you<00:04:48.580> have

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:49.120 
it seems to work for me do you have

00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:51.540 
it seems to work for me do you have
techniques<00:04:49.960> like<00:04:50.170> that<00:04:50.410> where<00:04:50.680> you<00:04:51.010> play

00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:51.550 
techniques like that where you play

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:53.010 
techniques like that where you play
differently<00:04:52.150> at<00:04:52.360> the<00:04:52.450> beginning<00:04:52.870> the<00:04:52.990> middle

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:53.020 
differently at the beginning the middle

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:55.950 
differently at the beginning the middle
and<00:04:53.260> the<00:04:53.380> end<00:04:53.410> of<00:04:53.590> the<00:04:53.680> game<00:04:54.510> and<00:04:55.510> what<00:04:55.840> are

00:04:55.950 --> 00:04:55.960 
and the end of the game and what are

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:58.770 
and the end of the game and what are
those<00:04:56.110> techniques<00:04:56.640> is<00:04:57.640> it<00:04:57.820> different<00:04:58.180> now<00:04:58.210> for

00:04:58.770 --> 00:04:58.780 
those techniques is it different now for

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:02.870 
those techniques is it different now for
for<00:04:59.650> black<00:05:00.130> ops<00:05:00.310> than<00:05:00.670> want<00:05:01.240> to<00:05:01.300> work<00:05:01.420> for<00:05:01.540> two

00:05:02.870 --> 00:05:02.880 
for black ops than want to work for two

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:05.970 
for black ops than want to work for two
you<00:05:03.880> know<00:05:04.000> I<00:05:04.180> just<00:05:04.330> kept<00:05:04.750> pushing<00:05:05.260> it<00:05:05.530> and<00:05:05.710> and

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:05.980 
you know I just kept pushing it and and

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:10.380 
you know I just kept pushing it and and
I<00:05:06.040> do<00:05:06.100> this<00:05:06.340> on<00:05:06.490> a<00:05:06.520> lot<00:05:06.730> of<00:05:06.880> game<00:05:07.030> modes<00:05:09.390> and

00:05:10.380 --> 00:05:10.390 
I do this on a lot of game modes and

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:11.970 
I do this on a lot of game modes and
I've<00:05:10.930> been<00:05:11.140> finding<00:05:11.380> some<00:05:11.650> interesting

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:11.980 
I've been finding some interesting

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:13.470 
I've been finding some interesting
opening<00:05:12.310> round<00:05:12.520> so<00:05:12.760> I<00:05:12.820> usually<00:05:13.120> run<00:05:13.270> with<00:05:13.450> a

00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:13.480 
opening round so I usually run with a

00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:19.350 
opening round so I usually run with a
marathon<00:05:15.660> lightweight<00:05:16.660> class<00:05:18.150> just<00:05:19.150> for<00:05:19.210> that

00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:19.360 
marathon lightweight class just for that

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:21.570 
marathon lightweight class just for that
first<00:05:19.750> a<00:05:20.050> couple<00:05:20.440> of<00:05:20.560> a<00:05:20.590> class<00:05:20.860> or<00:05:21.070> two<00:05:21.100> just

00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:21.580 
first a couple of a class or two just

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:23.790 
first a couple of a class or two just
for<00:05:21.850> doing<00:05:22.060> that<00:05:22.180> and<00:05:22.420> then<00:05:23.140> I<00:05:23.170> have<00:05:23.440> like<00:05:23.770> I

00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:23.800 
for doing that and then I have like I

00:05:23.800 --> 00:05:25.440 
for doing that and then I have like I
said<00:05:24.100> the<00:05:24.250> typical<00:05:24.670> classes<00:05:25.060> that<00:05:25.210> I<00:05:25.270> might

00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:25.450 
said the typical classes that I might

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:27.240 
said the typical classes that I might
run<00:05:25.810> in<00:05:25.990> any<00:05:26.140> game<00:05:26.320> in<00:05:26.500> the<00:05:26.560> mood<00:05:26.770> for<00:05:27.160> the

00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:27.250 
run in any game in the mood for the

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:29.040 
run in any game in the mood for the
middle<00:05:27.520> and<00:05:27.670> then<00:05:28.090> I<00:05:28.150> have<00:05:28.360> some<00:05:28.540> sort<00:05:28.690> of<00:05:28.750> self

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:29.050 
middle and then I have some sort of self

00:05:29.050 --> 00:05:30.570 
middle and then I have some sort of self
classes<00:05:29.440> at<00:05:29.560> the<00:05:29.590> end<00:05:29.800> here<00:05:30.010> I've<00:05:30.130> got<00:05:30.160> a<00:05:30.310> cell

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:30.580 
classes at the end here I've got a cell

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:32.730 
classes at the end here I've got a cell
class<00:05:30.820> that<00:05:31.180> I<00:05:31.390> pretty<00:05:31.870> much<00:05:31.990> run<00:05:32.290> just<00:05:32.620> for

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:32.740 
class that I pretty much run just for

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:35.850 
class that I pretty much run just for
search<00:05:32.980> and<00:05:33.070> destroy<00:05:33.780> so<00:05:34.780> again<00:05:35.260> let<00:05:35.740> me<00:05:35.770> know
