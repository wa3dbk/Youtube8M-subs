me therefore I am out of his line of
fire<00:01:47.820> and<00:01:48.149> as<00:01:48.840> he<00:01:49.110> will<00:01:49.290> be<00:01:49.439> reacting<00:01:49.920> a<00:01:50.009> little

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:50.220 
fire and as he will be reacting a little

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:52.190 
fire and as he will be reacting a little
slower<00:01:50.430> than<00:01:50.670> you<00:01:50.850> do<00:01:51.060> he<00:01:51.659> will<00:01:51.840> be<00:01:51.960> slowly

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200 
slower than you do he will be slowly

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.050 
slower than you do he will be slowly
getting<00:01:52.590> closer<00:01:52.799> to<00:01:53.070> you<00:01:53.220> and<00:01:53.430> there<00:01:53.880> will<00:01:54.030> be

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.060 
getting closer to you and there will be

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.209 
getting closer to you and there will be
a<00:01:54.240> point<00:01:54.630> where<00:01:55.079> he<00:01:55.170> actually<00:01:55.320> overshoots<00:01:56.009> you

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
a point where he actually overshoots you

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.069 
a point where he actually overshoots you
that<00:01:56.729> will<00:01:56.880> be<00:01:57.000> your<00:01:57.149> chance<00:01:57.450> to<00:01:57.659> finish<00:01:57.840> him

00:01:58.069 --> 00:01:58.079 
that will be your chance to finish him

00:01:58.079 --> 00:01:59.870 
that will be your chance to finish him
off<00:01:58.229> this<00:01:58.829> can<00:01:59.040> actually<00:01:59.159> take<00:01:59.579> a<00:01:59.610> while<00:01:59.850> if

00:01:59.870 --> 00:01:59.880 
off this can actually take a while if

00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.090 
off this can actually take a while if
the<00:02:00.240> enemy<00:02:00.570> is<00:02:00.719> a<00:02:00.750> good<00:02:00.990> pilot<00:02:01.380> but<00:02:01.770> it<00:02:01.920> will

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100 
the enemy is a good pilot but it will
