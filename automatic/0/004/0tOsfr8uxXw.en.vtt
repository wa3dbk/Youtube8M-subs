no free IP I IPA app which bugger so I
found<00:00:38.730> an<00:00:38.879> alternative<00:00:39.120> after<00:00:39.780> a<00:00:39.809> lot<00:00:40.050> of

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
found an alternative after a lot of

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.470 
found an alternative after a lot of
mistakes<00:00:40.590> made<00:00:41.250> a<00:00:41.280> lot<00:00:41.520> i've<00:00:41.610> got<00:00:41.820> a<00:00:41.850> crushed<00:00:42.300> a

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969 
few times always have to restore it by

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:47.479 
few times always have to restore it by
fixed<00:00:45.329> it<00:00:45.680> delete<00:00:46.680> a<00:00:46.710> lot<00:00:46.920> of<00:00:46.980> stuff<00:00:47.219> and

fixed it delete a lot of stuff and

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:51.979 
fixed it delete a lot of stuff and
messed<00:00:47.820> around<00:00:47.969> finally<00:00:48.930> a<00:00:49.910> effective<00:00:50.989> safe

00:00:51.979 --> 00:00:51.989 
messed around finally a effective safe

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:55.490 
messed around finally a effective safe
way<00:00:52.860> of<00:00:52.890> getting<00:00:53.550> free<00:00:53.789> apps<00:00:53.969> and<00:00:54.420> so<00:00:55.379> it's

00:00:55.490 --> 00:00:55.500 
way of getting free apps and so it's

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.450 
way of getting free apps and so it's
called<00:00:55.649> at<00:00:55.800> V<00:00:56.070> V<00:00:56.280> and<00:00:57.440> V<00:00:58.440> share<00:00:58.770> is<00:00:59.010> that<00:00:59.039> trap

00:00:59.450 --> 00:00:59.460 
called at V V and V share is that trap

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.939 
called at V V and V share is that trap
itself<00:01:00.440> so<00:01:01.440> basically<00:01:01.829> for<00:01:02.660> app<00:01:03.660> VV<00:01:04.350> you<00:01:04.799> need

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949 
itself so basically for app VV you need

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:08.539 
itself so basically for app VV you need
to<00:01:05.100> install<00:01:05.309> a<00:01:06.290> repo<00:01:07.290> on<00:01:07.530> your<00:01:07.740> iPod<00:01:08.189> under

00:01:08.539 --> 00:01:08.549 
to install a repo on your iPod under
