for<00:00:21.600> 2015<00:00:22.320> north<00:00:23.250> kiteboarding<00:00:23.820> is

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:24.060 
for 2015 north kiteboarding is

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:27.529 
for 2015 north kiteboarding is
introducing<00:00:24.750> our<00:00:25.039> compact<00:00:26.039> surf<00:00:26.400> concept<00:00:27.119> so

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
introducing our compact surf concept so

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:30.620 
introducing our compact surf concept so
the<00:00:27.840> CSC<00:00:28.470> concept<00:00:29.189> as<00:00:29.429> the<00:00:29.490> name<00:00:29.820> suggests<00:00:30.090> is

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:30.630 
the CSC concept as the name suggests is

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.770 
the CSC concept as the name suggests is
all<00:00:31.560> about<00:00:31.769> having<00:00:31.949> a<00:00:32.130> more<00:00:32.399> compact<00:00:33.000> board<00:00:33.420> so

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:33.780 
all about having a more compact board so

00:00:33.780 --> 00:00:36.920 
all about having a more compact board so
shorter<00:00:34.290> more<00:00:34.950> parallel<00:00:35.430> rails<00:00:35.750> and<00:00:36.750> this

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
shorter more parallel rails and this

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:37.970 
shorter more parallel rails and this
comes<00:00:37.140> with<00:00:37.260> a<00:00:37.320> number<00:00:37.680> of<00:00:37.829> different

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
comes with a number of different

00:00:37.980 --> 00:01:00.180 
comes with a number of different
performance<00:00:38.700> benefits

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:00.190 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:02.680 

so<00:01:01.190> the<00:01:01.310> main<00:01:01.460> thing<00:01:01.700> you'll<00:01:01.880> notice<00:01:02.120> when<00:01:02.660> you

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:02.690 
so the main thing you'll notice when you

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:04.660 
so the main thing you'll notice when you
first<00:01:03.020> jump<00:01:03.260> on<00:01:03.440> one<00:01:03.590> of<00:01:03.620> these<00:01:03.740> boards<00:01:03.950> is<00:01:04.280> how

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:04.670 
first jump on one of these boards is how

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.570 
first jump on one of these boards is how
easy<00:01:05.059> they<00:01:05.300> are<00:01:05.330> to<00:01:05.480> ride<00:01:06.280> being<00:01:07.280> if<00:01:07.430> they're

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:07.580 
easy they are to ride being if they're

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:09.850 
easy they are to ride being if they're
so<00:01:07.760> straight<00:01:08.630> and<00:01:08.810> parallel<00:01:08.990> and<00:01:09.500> outline

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:09.860 
so straight and parallel and outline

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:11.830 
so straight and parallel and outline
they're<00:01:10.400> really<00:01:10.729> fast<00:01:11.000> and<00:01:11.330> they're<00:01:11.510> really

00:01:11.830 --> 00:01:11.840 
they're really fast and they're really

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:13.930 
they're really fast and they're really
stable<00:01:12.380> especially<00:01:12.530> through<00:01:13.100> chopped<00:01:13.400> going

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:13.940 
stable especially through chopped going

00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:15.969 
stable especially through chopped going
full<00:01:14.180> speed<00:01:14.540> as<00:01:14.810> you<00:01:15.200> do<00:01:15.350> when<00:01:15.500> you're<00:01:15.650> kiting

00:01:15.969 --> 00:01:15.979 
full speed as you do when you're kiting

00:01:15.979 --> 00:01:18.280 
full speed as you do when you're kiting
these<00:01:16.760> words<00:01:17.060> are<00:01:17.180> much<00:01:17.390> more<00:01:17.600> stable<00:01:17.720> than<00:01:18.170> a

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:18.290 
these words are much more stable than a

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:20.200 
these words are much more stable than a
traditional<00:01:19.070> sort<00:01:19.580> of<00:01:19.610> short<00:01:19.850> board<00:01:20.000> design

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:20.210 
traditional sort of short board design

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:23.160 
traditional sort of short board design
that<00:01:20.360> has<00:01:20.450> a<00:01:20.479> lot<00:01:20.780> more<00:01:20.810> curve<00:01:21.350> in<00:01:21.530> the<00:01:21.619> outline

00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:23.170 
that has a lot more curve in the outline

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:26.109 
that has a lot more curve in the outline
other<00:01:24.170> benefits<00:01:24.680> of<00:01:24.800> this<00:01:25.130> design<00:01:25.490> obviously

00:01:26.109 --> 00:01:26.119 
other benefits of this design obviously

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:28.780 
other benefits of this design obviously
is<00:01:26.180> that<00:01:26.300> it's<00:01:26.450> so<00:01:26.660> short<00:01:27.110> and<00:01:27.320> compact<00:01:27.790> these

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:28.790 
is that it's so short and compact these

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:30.670 
is that it's so short and compact these
words<00:01:29.090> are<00:01:29.210> great<00:01:29.660> for<00:01:30.020> doing<00:01:30.110> aerial

00:01:30.670 --> 00:01:30.680 
words are great for doing aerial

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:32.530 
words are great for doing aerial
maneuvers<00:01:31.100> all<00:01:31.430> the<00:01:31.550> new<00:01:31.700> school<00:01:32.030> on<00:01:32.240> shore

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:32.540 
maneuvers all the new school on shore

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:33.910 
maneuvers all the new school on shore
stuff<00:01:32.810> the<00:01:32.990> team<00:01:33.140> writers<00:01:33.440> have<00:01:33.560> really<00:01:33.800> been

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:33.920 
stuff the team writers have really been

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.490 
stuff the team writers have really been
loving<00:01:34.070> these<00:01:34.340> boards<00:01:34.700> because<00:01:35.509> you<00:01:36.050> have<00:01:36.229> so

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:36.500 
loving these boards because you have so

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:37.749 
loving these boards because you have so
much<00:01:36.590> less<00:01:36.860> swing<00:01:37.070> weight<00:01:37.130> up<00:01:37.430> here<00:01:37.580> in<00:01:37.640> the

00:01:37.749 --> 00:01:37.759 
much less swing weight up here in the

00:01:37.759 --> 00:01:39.460 
much less swing weight up here in the
nose<00:01:37.940> that's<00:01:38.240> that's<00:01:38.690> throwing<00:01:38.990> you<00:01:39.110> off<00:01:39.140> and

00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:39.470 
nose that's that's throwing you off and

00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:40.749 
nose that's that's throwing you off and
creating<00:01:39.830> windage<00:01:40.160> in<00:01:40.310> the<00:01:40.399> middle<00:01:40.580> of<00:01:40.670> your

00:01:40.749 --> 00:01:40.759 
creating windage in the middle of your

00:01:40.759 --> 00:01:44.440 
creating windage in the middle of your
tricks<00:01:41.090> and<00:01:42.430> having<00:01:43.430> the<00:01:43.880> board<00:01:44.149> sort<00:01:44.360> of

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:44.450 
tricks and having the board sort of

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.450 
tricks and having the board sort of
compact<00:01:44.899> and<00:01:45.320> all<00:01:45.560> that<00:01:45.770> all<00:01:45.920> that<00:01:45.979> volume

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:46.460 
compact and all that all that volume

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:49.200 
compact and all that all that volume
sort<00:01:46.790> of<00:01:46.880> between<00:01:47.180> your<00:01:47.690> center<00:01:48.020> of<00:01:48.050> gravity

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:49.210 
sort of between your center of gravity

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:51.999 
sort of between your center of gravity
really<00:01:50.210> allows<00:01:50.479> you<00:01:50.690> to<00:01:50.869> sort<00:01:51.560> of<00:01:51.649> dominate

00:01:51.999 --> 00:01:52.009 
really allows you to sort of dominate

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:53.920 
really allows you to sort of dominate
the<00:01:52.160> board<00:01:52.399> and<00:01:52.700> gives<00:01:53.060> you<00:01:53.180> a<00:01:53.210> ton<00:01:53.479> of<00:01:53.539> control

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:53.930 
the board and gives you a ton of control

00:01:53.930 --> 00:02:13.000 
the board and gives you a ton of control
through<00:01:54.259> your<00:01:54.380> manoeuvres

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:15.140 

so<00:02:14.010> one<00:02:14.310> of<00:02:14.340> the<00:02:14.460> first<00:02:14.610> things<00:02:14.910> you'll<00:02:15.060> notice

00:02:15.140 --> 00:02:15.150 
so one of the first things you'll notice

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:17.330 
so one of the first things you'll notice
when<00:02:15.570> you<00:02:15.660> jump<00:02:15.930> on<00:02:16.080> one<00:02:16.260> of<00:02:16.290> these<00:02:16.470> new<00:02:16.740> CFC

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:17.340 
when you jump on one of these new CFC

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:19.340 
when you jump on one of these new CFC
boards<00:02:17.640> is<00:02:17.820> how<00:02:18.270> stable<00:02:18.750> they<00:02:19.020> are<00:02:19.140> through

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:19.350 
boards is how stable they are through

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:21.320 
boards is how stable they are through
the<00:02:19.470> chop<00:02:19.700> because<00:02:20.700> they<00:02:21.000> have<00:02:21.090> such<00:02:21.300> a

00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:21.330 
the chop because they have such a

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.570 
the chop because they have such a
parallel<00:02:21.870> outline<00:02:22.230> there<00:02:22.680> they're<00:02:23.160> really

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:23.580 
parallel outline there they're really

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:25.100 
parallel outline there they're really
settled<00:02:24.000> they<00:02:24.240> don't<00:02:24.420> bounce<00:02:24.540> around<00:02:24.780> a<00:02:25.080> lot

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110 
settled they don't bounce around a lot

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.170 
settled they don't bounce around a lot
and<00:02:25.440> they're<00:02:25.950> really<00:02:26.190> fast<00:02:26.550> you<00:02:26.910> don't<00:02:27.000> have

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180 
and they're really fast you don't have

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:28.670 
and they're really fast you don't have
as<00:02:27.270> much<00:02:27.450> water<00:02:27.690> wrapping<00:02:28.200> around<00:02:28.320> the<00:02:28.500> curve

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680 
as much water wrapping around the curve

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.050 
as much water wrapping around the curve
of<00:02:28.800> the<00:02:28.860> board<00:02:29.070> to<00:02:29.130> slow<00:02:29.370> it<00:02:29.490> down<00:02:29.520> so<00:02:29.700> they're

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
of the board to slow it down so they're

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.000 
of the board to slow it down so they're
really<00:02:30.270> efficient<00:02:30.840> and<00:02:30.990> carry<00:02:31.320> speed<00:02:31.620> really

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.010 
really efficient and carry speed really

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.100 
really efficient and carry speed really
well<00:02:32.160> through<00:02:32.340> your<00:02:32.370> turns<00:02:32.700> and<00:02:33.000> and<00:02:33.150> track

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:34.110 
well through your turns and and track

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:35.600 
well through your turns and and track
and<00:02:34.380> are<00:02:34.470> really<00:02:34.650> positive<00:02:34.920> on<00:02:35.340> the<00:02:35.430> wave

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:35.610 
and are really positive on the wave

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:37.580 
and are really positive on the wave
we've<00:02:36.540> also<00:02:36.660> gotten<00:02:36.930> really<00:02:37.230> good<00:02:37.380> feedback

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
we've also gotten really good feedback

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.970 
we've also gotten really good feedback
from<00:02:37.950> riders<00:02:38.450> using<00:02:39.450> these<00:02:39.630> boards<00:02:39.990> in<00:02:40.290> sort

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:40.980 
from riders using these boards in sort

00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:43.070 
from riders using these boards in sort
of<00:02:41.070> onshore<00:02:41.840> conditions<00:02:42.840> where<00:02:42.990> they're

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:43.080 
of onshore conditions where they're

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:44.750 
of onshore conditions where they're
doing<00:02:43.260> a<00:02:43.290> lot<00:02:43.410> of<00:02:43.440> aerial<00:02:43.800> maneuvers<00:02:44.190> less
