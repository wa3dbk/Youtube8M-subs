 the benefits of magnesium chloride 

00:00:01.879 --> 00:00:06.560
 properties how to consume it 

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:09.360
 contraindications and side effects 

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:12.360
 Magnesium chloride has varied 

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:15.030
 effects on the body helps clean 

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:17.210
 the blood dissolves deposits of 

00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:20.820
 cholesterol in the blood vessels 

00:00:17.210 --> 00:00:23.850
 activates the immune system benefits the 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:25.920
 manufacture of antibodies properties 

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:26.970
 causes the activation of vitamins 

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.250
 enzymes 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:31.710
 helps to form bone structures and 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:33.770
 dental proteins and antibodies is 

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:36.200
 antistress antithrombotic 

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:39.750
 anti-inflammatory and cardioprotective 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:42.000
 actions on our body possesses a 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:43.440
 fixing action on calcium what 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.289
 help in the treatments of 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.270
 osteoporosis acts on the correct 

00:00:46.289 --> 00:00:50.100
 transmission of nerve impulses and 

00:00:48.270 --> 00:00:51.989
 favors the breakdown of molecules 

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:55.140
 glucose in the muscles for creation 

00:00:51.989 --> 00:00:57.289
 of light energy negative action to 

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:59.969
 balance the central nervous system 

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:01.739
 the disorders due to lack of 

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:03.780
 magnesium are abundant and those who 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.090
 suffer from stress problems or commit 

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.600
 excess of sugar alcohol and drugs already 

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:10.110
 that he 

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:11.909
 and magnesium in large quantities increases 

00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:13.770
 the secretion of bile which helps the 

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:16.770
 fat digestion and elimination of 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.690
 toxic waste for being a regulator 

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:20.310
 primary of electrical activities 

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:22.770
 acts in numerous reactions 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.590
 metabolic when we lack 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:28.560
 we feel tired depressed without encouragement 

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:30.630
 annoyed and annoyed by all 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.880
 magnesium participates in the activation of 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:34.770
 more than 300 enzymes and other agents 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:36.840
 body chemicals active at 

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.970
 vitamins bay has a paramount role in 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.300
 protein synthesis excitability 

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:43.740
 of the muscles and release of energy 

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:46.020
 is located mainly in the 

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:48.869
 mitochondria energetic center of the 

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:51.060
 cells as you should see their great 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.800
 importance for metabolism does 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:55.800
 necessary for multiple processes 

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:57.630
 biological is why this mineral 

00:01:55.800 --> 00:02:01.110
 is concentrated in the heart liver 

00:01:57.630 --> 00:02:03.240
 brain and kidneys its absence produces 

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:04.970
 emotional instability increase and 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:07.280
 decreased reflexes 

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:09.780
 uncoordinated muscular apathy 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:13.260
 constipation premenstrual problems is 

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:16.700
 lack of appetite nausea vomiting diarrhea 

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:18.900
 tremors osteoporosis caries rheumatism 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.879
 bone decalcification in addition to its 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:23.909
 lack affects the possibility of 

00:02:20.879 --> 00:02:25.739
 suffering a heart attack for diabetics is 

00:02:23.909 --> 00:02:27.720
 impossible to control the levels of 

00:02:25.739 --> 00:02:29.750
 blood sugar if you do not have a 

00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:32.819
 adequate level of magnesium in the body 

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:34.500
 the list of benefits is huge so 

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:36.599
 that it has been determined that his presence 

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:39.569
 in the daily diet is absolutely 

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:41.489
 necessary of what we eat only 30 

00:02:39.569 --> 00:02:43.200
 at 40 percent is absorbed by 

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:45.720
 our body and the refining of 

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:48.540
 food as well as its cooking produces 

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:50.510
 a great loss of mineral for being a 

00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:52.440
 chemical compound is not exempt from 

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.450
 contraindications that should be had in 

00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:56.579
 account to avoid side effects 

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:58.859
 Magnesium chloride is 

00:02:56.579 --> 00:03:02.010
 contraindicated in case of diarrhea and 

00:02:58.859 --> 00:03:03.959
 kidney failure preparing for 

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:06.030
 its consumption is done in a way 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:08.459
 easy you should first boil a 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:10.319
 liter of water and let it cool then 

00:03:08.459 --> 00:03:12.450
 dissolve 30 grams of chloride 

00:03:10.319 --> 00:03:14.310
 magnesium in the water mixes with a 

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:17.190
 wooden spoon and gets into bottle 

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:19.710
 of glass according to the doctors there is 

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:21.750
 consume it after 40 years 

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:24.900
 when it is assimilated less through the 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:26.460
 food these are some foods 

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:28.740
 which are high in magnesium 

00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:30.600
 amount of magnesium expressed in 

00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:33.540
 milligrams per 100 grams of 

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:40.800
 food from largest to smallest pipes

 white 160 pistachio 158 chocolate 100 y 

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:59.580
 you consume magnesium chloride for 

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:01.410
 treat or prevent some kind of 

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:04.080
 diseases or to improve your health 

00:04:01.410 --> 00:04:07.530
 what is your experience with chloride 

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:09.480
 Magnesium in any case is important 

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:11.190
 that you consult with your doctor and in case 

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:12.540
 that I told you only to acquire 

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:15.300
 products with controls 

00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:17.100
 corresponding if you liked the 

00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:19.980
 information of the video you can give to the 

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:24.230
 finger point pointing up thank you 

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:24.230
 for your attention you have a good day
