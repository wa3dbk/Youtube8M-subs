00:03:47.849 --> 00:03:50.180 
sad quite frustrating because Kat this
Captain<00:03:48.180> Rex<00:03:48.360> phase<00:03:48.599> one<00:03:48.840> an<00:03:49.709> older<00:03:50.010> figure

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190 
Captain Rex phase one an older figure

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:52.369 
Captain Rex phase one an older figure
has<00:03:50.549> more<00:03:51.269> articulation<00:03:51.750> than<00:03:52.049> a<00:03:52.080> newer

00:03:52.369 --> 00:03:52.379 
has more articulation than a newer

00:03:52.379 --> 00:03:54.589 
has more articulation than a newer
figure<00:03:52.830> so<00:03:53.400> that<00:03:53.700> is<00:03:54.000> quite<00:03:54.420> disappointing

00:03:54.589 --> 00:03:54.599 
figure so that is quite disappointing

00:03:54.599 --> 00:03:56.780 
figure so that is quite disappointing
from<00:03:55.110> Hasbro<00:03:55.500> that<00:03:55.980> they're<00:03:56.189> beginning<00:03:56.370> to<00:03:56.580> do

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:56.790 
from Hasbro that they're beginning to do

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:00.589 
from Hasbro that they're beginning to do
that<00:03:57.980> yeah<00:03:58.980> this<00:03:59.280> is<00:03:59.430> definitely<00:03:59.700> his<00:04:00.030> sad

00:04:00.589 --> 00:04:00.599 
that yeah this is definitely his sad

know I mean it's a great looking figure
no<00:05:14.160> doubt<00:05:14.430> but<00:05:15.090> it's<00:05:15.660> just<00:05:15.810> the<00:05:15.960> articulation

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:16.500 
no doubt but it's just the articulation

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:20.060 
no doubt but it's just the articulation

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:51.110 
all work so but still you know it's a
cool<00:05:48.870> figure<00:05:49.050> just<00:05:49.590> not<00:05:49.770> the<00:05:50.040> articulation<00:05:50.970> is

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:51.120 
cool figure just not the articulation is

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:52.850 
cool figure just not the articulation is
definitely<00:05:51.660> definitely<00:05:52.050> lacking<00:05:52.530> it's<00:05:52.710> like

00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:52.860 
definitely definitely lacking it's like

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:54.440 
definitely definitely lacking it's like
they're<00:05:53.010> going<00:05:53.340> backwards<00:05:53.820> instead<00:05:54.030> of<00:05:54.240> going

00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:54.450 
they're going backwards instead of going

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:57.170 
they're going backwards instead of going
forwards<00:05:55.010> the<00:05:56.010> aswel<00:05:56.700> definitely<00:05:57.030> should<00:05:57.150> not

00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:57.180 
forwards the aswel definitely should not

00:05:57.180 --> 00:05:59.510 
forwards the aswel definitely should not
have<00:05:57.540> cut<00:05:58.050> out<00:05:58.169> on<00:05:58.320> the<00:05:58.470> knee<00:05:58.650> articulation<00:05:58.830> I

00:05:59.510 --> 00:05:59.520 
have cut out on the knee articulation I

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:01.790 
have cut out on the knee articulation I
mean<00:06:00.510> of<00:06:00.810> course<00:06:00.840> yeah<00:06:01.350> the<00:06:01.530> risks

00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:01.800 
mean of course yeah the risks

00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:03.350 
mean of course yeah the risks
articulation<00:06:02.370> is<00:06:02.490> sorely<00:06:02.730> lacking<00:06:02.850> as<00:06:03.180> well

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:03.360 
articulation is sorely lacking as well

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:06.230 
articulation is sorely lacking as well
but<00:06:03.570> you<00:06:03.750> know<00:06:04.340> it's<00:06:05.340> just<00:06:05.520> that's<00:06:06.060> just

00:06:06.230 --> 00:06:06.240 
but you know it's just that's just

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:08.540 
but you know it's just that's just
really<00:06:06.960> sad<00:06:07.080> so<00:06:07.590> anyway<00:06:07.980> here's<00:06:08.130> the<00:06:08.250> firing

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:08.550 
really sad so anyway here's the firing

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:10.880 
really sad so anyway here's the firing
missile<00:06:08.790> launcher<00:06:09.180> you<00:06:09.750> just<00:06:09.960> put<00:06:10.530> lock<00:06:10.710> in

00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:10.890 
missile launcher you just put lock in

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:12.770 
missile launcher you just put lock in
the<00:06:10.980> missile<00:06:11.250> and<00:06:11.430> flick<00:06:11.700> the<00:06:11.970> missile<00:06:12.480> under

00:06:12.770 --> 00:06:12.780 
the missile and flick the missile under

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:14.960 
the missile and flick the missile under
in<00:06:12.870> the<00:06:12.960> bottom<00:06:13.230> or<00:06:13.770> no<00:06:13.919> there's<00:06:14.550> a<00:06:14.610> button<00:06:14.850> up

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:14.970 
in the bottom or no there's a button up

00:06:14.970 --> 00:06:18.020 
in the bottom or no there's a button up
here<00:06:15.210> you<00:06:15.660> just<00:06:15.720> press<00:06:15.990> and<00:06:16.290> fire<00:06:16.740> so<00:06:17.250> there

00:06:18.020 --> 00:06:18.030 
here you just press and fire so there

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:20.180 
here you just press and fire so there
you<00:06:18.150> go<00:06:18.300> it's<00:06:18.630> gimmicky<00:06:19.380> yes<00:06:19.590> but<00:06:19.860> you<00:06:20.070> know

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:20.190 
you go it's gimmicky yes but you know

00:06:20.190 --> 00:06:21.200 
you go it's gimmicky yes but you know
I'm<00:06:20.250> not<00:06:20.370> really<00:06:20.550> going<00:06:20.789> for<00:06:20.880> that<00:06:20.970> it's<00:06:21.150> the

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:21.210 
I'm not really going for that it's the

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:22.700 
I'm not really going for that it's the
blaster<00:06:21.479> pistols<00:06:21.750> I<00:06:21.810> care<00:06:22.020> about

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:22.710 
blaster pistols I care about

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:24.350 
blaster pistols I care about
and<00:06:23.070> he<00:06:23.190> does<00:06:23.310> have<00:06:23.430> a<00:06:23.520> Peggle<00:06:23.850> here<00:06:24.060> so<00:06:24.240> the

00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:24.360 
and he does have a Peggle here so the

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:26.680 
and he does have a Peggle here so the
jetpack<00:06:24.690> will<00:06:24.840> probably<00:06:25.140> fit<00:06:25.410> but<00:06:26.220> you<00:06:26.460> know

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:26.690 
jetpack will probably fit but you know

00:06:26.690 --> 00:06:29.300 
jetpack will probably fit but you know
yeah<00:06:27.690> it's<00:06:27.840> still<00:06:27.960> a<00:06:28.020> good<00:06:28.200> figure<00:06:28.380> definitely

00:06:29.300 --> 00:06:29.310 
yeah it's still a good figure definitely

00:06:29.310 --> 00:06:30.380 
yeah it's still a good figure definitely
worth<00:06:29.430> adding<00:06:29.610> to<00:06:29.790> your<00:06:29.820> collection<00:06:30.030> but

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:30.390 
worth adding to your collection but

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:32.180 
worth adding to your collection but
you're<00:06:31.050> just<00:06:31.290> don't<00:06:31.590> be<00:06:31.680> surprised<00:06:32.040> because

00:06:32.180 --> 00:06:32.190 
you're just don't be surprised because

00:06:32.190 --> 00:06:35.000 
you're just don't be surprised because
there's<00:06:32.580> lacking<00:06:33.390> articulation<00:06:34.020> that's<00:06:34.800> just

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:35.010 
there's lacking articulation that's just

00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:39.140 
there's lacking articulation that's just
-<00:06:35.880> so<00:06:36.120> I<00:06:36.330> gave<00:06:37.050> this<00:06:37.200> a<00:06:37.260> 3<00:06:37.590> out<00:06:37.620> of<00:06:37.770> 5<00:06:38.150> clone

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:39.150 
- so I gave this a 3 out of 5 clone

00:06:39.150 --> 00:06:41.840 
- so I gave this a 3 out of 5 clone
trooper<00:06:39.420> bucket<00:06:39.780> helmets<00:06:40.110> so<00:06:40.890> anyway<00:06:41.550> I'll<00:06:41.760> be

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:41.850 
trooper bucket helmets so anyway I'll be

00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:45.380 
trooper bucket helmets so anyway I'll be
doing<00:06:42.150> a<00:06:42.210> separate<00:06:42.450> video<00:06:42.600> comparing
