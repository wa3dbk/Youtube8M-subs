hooked<00:00:08.250> up<00:00:08.400> to<00:00:08.580> it<00:00:09.440> about<00:00:10.440> 40<00:00:11.070> degrees<00:00:11.219> out<00:00:11.730> 45

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:12.170 
hooked up to it about 40 degrees out 45

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:23.349 
hooked up to it about 40 degrees out 45
maybe<00:00:13.170> I<00:00:16.910> installed<00:00:17.910> a<00:00:20.449> ported<00:00:21.449> out<00:00:21.660> 49<00:00:22.529> cc

00:00:23.349 --> 00:00:23.359 
maybe I installed a ported out 49 cc

00:00:23.359 --> 00:00:28.820 
maybe I installed a ported out 49 cc
cylinder<00:00:26.930> and<00:00:27.930> replace<00:00:28.260> of<00:00:28.439> the<00:00:28.529> stock

00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:28.830 
cylinder and replace of the stock

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.720 
cylinder and replace of the stock
cylinders

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:32.730 

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:34.670 

a<00:00:32.850> lot<00:00:33.600> bigger<00:00:33.780> because<00:00:34.020> they<00:00:34.200> got<00:00:34.320> like<00:00:34.649> a

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:34.680 
a lot bigger because they got like a

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.500 
a lot bigger because they got like a
heat<00:00:34.980> sink<00:00:35.250> or<00:00:35.460> something<00:00:35.760> on<00:00:35.850> top<00:00:36.059> of<00:00:36.120> them

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:38.510 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:41.740 

look<00:00:39.510> cooler<00:00:39.870> than<00:00:40.020> the<00:00:40.290> new<00:00:41.129> one<00:00:41.370> but

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:41.750 
look cooler than the new one but

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:51.460 
look cooler than the new one but
whatever<00:00:45.829> hold<00:00:47.329> back

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:51.470 

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:58.810 

on<00:00:52.010> this<00:00:52.220> side<00:00:52.489> also<00:00:52.760> and<00:00:55.630> installed<00:00:56.630> a<00:00:57.820> gas

00:00:58.810 --> 00:00:58.820 
on this side also and installed a gas

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:04.420 
on this side also and installed a gas
shutoff<00:00:59.630> valve<00:01:01.150> because<00:01:02.440> it<00:01:03.440> is<00:01:03.710> leaking<00:01:03.950> gas

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:04.430 
shutoff valve because it is leaking gas

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:09.310 
shutoff valve because it is leaking gas
into<00:01:04.910> the<00:01:05.000> cylinder<00:01:07.270> so<00:01:08.270> just<00:01:08.780> got<00:01:08.930> a<00:01:08.960> brand

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:09.320 
into the cylinder so just got a brand

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:21.820 
into the cylinder so just got a brand
new<00:01:09.790> carburetor<00:01:10.790> on<00:01:11.090> it<00:01:18.310> so<00:01:20.500> but<00:01:21.500> for<00:01:21.619> some

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:21.830 
new carburetor on it so but for some

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:25.000 
new carburetor on it so but for some
reason

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:25.010 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:31.820 

to<00:01:26.010> prime<00:01:26.310> this<00:01:29.540> it<00:01:30.540> flows<00:01:30.840> out<00:01:31.080> onto<00:01:31.470> the<00:01:31.590> top

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:31.830 
to prime this it flows out onto the top

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:38.570 
to prime this it flows out onto the top
of<00:01:32.009> the<00:01:32.070> motor<00:01:35.150> to<00:01:36.150> prime<00:01:36.420> the<00:01:36.600> carb<00:01:36.900> I<00:01:37.580> don't

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:38.580 
of the motor to prime the carb I don't

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:41.450 
of the motor to prime the carb I don't
understand<00:01:39.030> why<00:01:39.210> but<00:01:39.979> it's<00:01:40.979> supposed<00:01:41.220> to<00:01:41.310> go

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:41.460 
understand why but it's supposed to go

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.520 
understand why but it's supposed to go
to<00:01:41.520> the<00:01:41.700> back<00:01:41.909> inside<00:01:42.300> the<00:01:42.450> tank<00:01:42.720> but<00:01:43.050> there's

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:43.530 
to the back inside the tank but there's

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:53.690 
to the back inside the tank but there's
no<00:01:43.680> for<00:01:44.250> anything<00:01:45.320> so<00:01:47.869> put<00:01:48.869> it<00:01:48.960> on<00:01:49.049> choke<00:01:52.700> the

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
no for anything so put it on choke the

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.669 
no for anything so put it on choke the
pool<00:01:53.940> starts<00:01:54.180> to<00:01:54.390> jump<00:01:54.630> on<00:01:54.869> this<00:01:55.110> and<00:01:55.470> the

00:01:55.669 --> 00:01:55.679 
pool starts to jump on this and the

00:01:55.679 --> 00:02:00.499 
pool starts to jump on this and the
battery<00:01:56.369> is<00:01:56.520> too<00:01:56.970> so<00:01:58.670> don't<00:01:59.670> have<00:01:59.820> to<00:01:59.910> do<00:02:00.030> so<00:02:00.270> at

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
battery is too so don't have to do so at

00:02:00.509 --> 00:03:13.850 
battery is too so don't have to do so at
the<00:02:00.600> same<00:02:00.810> time

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:13.860 

00:03:13.860 --> 00:05:20.730 

yeah<00:03:14.860> it's<00:03:15.010> cold<00:03:15.370> one<00:03:15.550> out

00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:20.740 

00:05:20.740 --> 00:05:23.740
