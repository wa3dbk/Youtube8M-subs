00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:21.210 
construction there is a config file and

00:03:21.210 --> 00:03:26.870 
construction there is a config file and
the<00:03:21.920> from<00:03:22.920> red<00:03:23.100> power<00:03:23.340> and<00:03:24.380> then<00:03:25.670> at<00:03:26.670> this

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:26.880 
the from red power and then at this

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:30.190 
the from red power and then at this
