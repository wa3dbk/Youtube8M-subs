in<00:00:06.870> this<00:00:07.650> video<00:00:07.920> I<00:00:08.250> will<00:00:08.309> be<00:00:08.550> going<00:00:08.700> over<00:00:08.820> the

00:00:09.379 --> 00:00:09.389 
in this video I will be going over the

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:12.709 
in this video I will be going over the
new<00:00:09.660> turntable<00:00:10.110> plus<00:00:10.790> options<00:00:11.790> found<00:00:12.480> in

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:12.719 
new turntable plus options found in

00:00:12.719 --> 00:00:16.850 
new turntable plus options found in
ZBrush<00:00:13.580> so<00:00:14.580> I<00:00:14.610> have<00:00:14.820> loaded<00:00:15.180> my<00:00:15.510> demo<00:00:15.990> head<00:00:16.260> on

00:00:16.850 --> 00:00:16.860 
ZBrush so I have loaded my demo head on

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:19.460 
ZBrush so I have loaded my demo head on
in<00:00:17.460> my<00:00:17.789> movie<00:00:18.150> palette<00:00:18.510> which<00:00:18.720> i'm<00:00:18.960> going<00:00:19.170> to

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470 
in my movie palette which i'm going to

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.759 
in my movie palette which i'm going to
put<00:00:19.920> over<00:00:20.010> to<00:00:20.279> my<00:00:20.430> right<00:00:20.670> shelf<00:00:21.570> here<00:00:21.960> we<00:00:22.619> have

00:00:22.759 --> 00:00:22.769 
put over to my right shelf here we have

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:24.769 
put over to my right shelf here we have
our<00:00:22.830> turntable<00:00:23.220> plus<00:00:23.789> options<00:00:24.390> that<00:00:24.630> have<00:00:24.720> a

00:00:24.769 --> 00:00:24.779 
our turntable plus options that have a

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:29.269 
our turntable plus options that have a
start<00:00:25.199> a<00:00:25.439> mid<00:00:26.369> n<00:00:26.640> a<00:00:27.390> stop<00:00:27.689> point<00:00:28.050> we<00:00:28.859> also<00:00:29.039> have

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
start a mid n a stop point we also have

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:33.590 
start a mid n a stop point we also have
a<00:00:29.310> render<00:00:29.789> movie<00:00:30.150> and<00:00:30.390> a<00:00:31.199> save<00:00:31.679> and<00:00:31.890> load<00:00:32.600> so

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
a render movie and a save and load so

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.040 
a render movie and a save and load so
using<00:00:34.020> my<00:00:34.200> demo<00:00:34.590> head<00:00:34.890> i'm<00:00:35.220> going<00:00:35.970> to<00:00:36.120> evaluate

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:37.050 
using my demo head i'm going to evaluate

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.950 
using my demo head i'm going to evaluate
my<00:00:37.320> start<00:00:37.590> point<00:00:38.040> so<00:00:38.850> we're<00:00:39.270> going<00:00:39.420> to<00:00:39.629> scale

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:39.960 
my start point so we're going to scale

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.200 
my start point so we're going to scale
him<00:00:40.260> down<00:00:40.559> and<00:00:40.800> put<00:00:40.829> him<00:00:41.370> in<00:00:41.489> the<00:00:41.579> top<00:00:41.760> left

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:42.210 
him down and put him in the top left

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:45.139 
him down and put him in the top left
corner<00:00:42.510> which<00:00:43.289> will<00:00:43.440> be<00:00:43.530> my<00:00:43.680> start<00:00:43.949> point<00:00:44.250> my

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:05.220 
a scaling from left to right so when I

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:08.360 
a scaling from left to right so when I
click<00:01:05.309> on<00:01:05.610> my<00:01:05.850> render<00:01:06.210> movie<00:01:06.630> options<00:01:07.590> pop<00:01:08.340> up

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:08.370 
click on my render movie options pop up

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:12.110 
click on my render movie options pop up
I<00:01:08.820> have<00:01:09.570> my<00:01:09.720> lair<00:01:09.930> intensity<00:01:10.530> HD<00:01:11.370> geometry<00:01:11.940> an

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:12.120 
I have my lair intensity HD geometry an

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:14.240 
I have my lair intensity HD geometry an
image<00:01:12.450> sequence<00:01:12.840> alpha<00:01:13.260> sequence<00:01:13.650> any<00:01:14.040> depth

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:14.250 
image sequence alpha sequence any depth

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.670 
image sequence alpha sequence any depth
sequence<00:01:14.730> along<00:01:15.600> with<00:01:15.810> disabled<00:01:16.380> movie

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
sequence along with disabled movie

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:20.330 
sequence along with disabled movie
recording<00:01:18.080> so<00:01:19.080> my<00:01:19.260> lair<00:01:19.470> intensity<00:01:19.980> will<00:01:20.160> now

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340 
recording so my lair intensity will now

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.770 
recording so my lair intensity will now
allow<00:01:20.520> me<00:01:20.700> to<00:01:20.960> render<00:01:21.960> out<00:01:22.140> a<00:01:22.170> turntable

00:01:23.770 --> 00:01:23.780 
allow me to render out a turntable

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.740 
allow me to render out a turntable
showing<00:01:24.890> 0<00:01:25.890> to<00:01:26.160> 1<00:01:26.310> intensity<00:01:26.850> of<00:01:26.970> only<00:01:27.210> the

selected<00:01:28.190> layer<00:01:29.420> you<00:01:30.420> can<00:01:30.450> also<00:01:30.780> render<00:01:31.410> out

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
selected layer you can also render out

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:34.340 
selected layer you can also render out

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:38.460 
well we also can now render out an image

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.820

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:07.999 
where would I like to save my image
files<00:02:06.030> so<00:02:06.870> you<00:02:06.960> notice<00:02:07.200> it<00:02:07.290> is<00:02:07.410> pre<00:02:07.680> labeled

00:02:07.999 --> 00:02:08.009

image with four zeros I'm going to

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:14.479 
image with four zeros I'm going to
change<00:02:10.800> my<00:02:10.950> last<00:02:11.459> 0<00:02:11.790> to<00:02:11.849> 1<00:02:12.270> so<00:02:12.950> that<00:02:13.950> when<00:02:14.220> we

00:02:14.479 --> 00:02:14.489 
change my last 0 to 1 so that when we

00:02:14.489 --> 00:02:19.700 
change my last 0 to 1 so that when we
