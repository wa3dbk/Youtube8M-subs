00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.180
 all right 

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:21.250
 hello hello world and welcome to another 

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:23.439
 video of filters wins 21 and them 

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:27.039
 I bring another white game 2 now 

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:29.739
 playing with the 50 gold dcr this is right here 

00:00:27.039 --> 00:00:31.419
 the golden camouflage makes it a 

00:00:29.739 --> 00:00:32.800
 week how much you take me out is 

00:00:31.419 --> 00:00:35.290
 partisan in changing of team deathmatch 

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:38.470
 it's pretty good, obviously not 

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:39.730
 to judge whether you are good or not but 

00:00:38.470 --> 00:00:42.430
 for me it's pretty good to do 

00:00:39.730 --> 00:00:43.809
 with sniper and good is a game 

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:46.269
 moved as you already know that to me 

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:48.760
 I like it to be movidita not to change and that 

00:00:46.269 --> 00:00:50.590
 which obviously says the prejudice that 

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:52.180
 haiti is with is nobody but I 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:53.350
 is changing not in corner is it 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:56.140
 pulling out this streak because it's me 

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:59.260
 changing not quite all over the map 

00:00:56.140 --> 00:01:01.420
 as it says it's a map that capable that 

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:03.039
 many say good you get or in those 

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:05.050
 airplanes that I'm aiming now or in 

00:01:03.039 --> 00:01:07.060
 this corner and do not move more with him 

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:09.910
 but good I move and it's good 

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:12.280
 then be well done since I am 

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:14.890
 can give a few little tips not for 

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:16.690
 those clubs, I'm not going to 

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:19.450
 do nothing I will not say they are loops 

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:21.340
 but able that they want to start how 

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:22.600
 clean better how to be a good 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:24.400
 sniper 

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:26.920
 how to do all that quiz theme 

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:29.409
 cops and I do not look for pge and infinities of 

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:33.009
 shocks and tweets of what Wednesday 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:35.320
 you want there but obviously I'm not so 

00:01:33.009 --> 00:01:37.270
 Obviously it costs me with the ping 

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:38.890
 but I think something is the departure of 

00:01:37.270 --> 00:01:41.500
 one cuesco think sexy things there that 

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:43.240
 some like there's then do not know 

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:46.000
 go but hey then these tips 

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:48.880
 that I'm going to give obviously do not think that 

00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.770
 see in this video weekly on the 

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:56.440
 track eyes and you will get a trick 

00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:59.560
 367 20 you do not see cop of whatever and kill 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:01.569
 they make a triple no but they will do 

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:04.090
 a little better is able I am going to give 

00:02:01.569 --> 00:02:05.470
 as guidelines to configure or how are you going to 

00:02:04.090 --> 00:02:07.450
 the one like that that then we go full 

00:02:05.470 --> 00:02:09.970
 not because the video and cortito being 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:11.019
 tempts male configuration puts 

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:12.940
 of the class what would become the 

00:02:11.019 --> 00:02:15.190
 creation I use now secondary school 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:17.380
 the sale and 13 ere but also serves as 

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:19.060
 the cap that is a very good weapon 

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:19.989
 secondary very good the second time is 

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:21.940
 very important in a sniper 

00:02:19.989 --> 00:02:23.230
 although able that I want to go through the 

00:02:21.940 --> 00:02:25.209
 balls the high school is not very 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.860
 important after the gusts 

00:02:25.209 --> 00:02:27.880
 that does not matter much that capable that what 

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:31.120
 what if the tube 

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:33.130
 that if they see section t2 it looks a lot if 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:36.220
 they are good and they reach the asad also 

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:38.200
 obviously later what would come to be 

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:39.610
 The advantages use light weight for 

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.770
 move more agile 

00:02:39.610 --> 00:02:44.350
 then agile hands just to 

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:46.510
 change faster from high school and in 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:48.640
 The third advantage can recommend 

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:51.790
 both use dexterity and tactics more 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:54.100
 tactical mask because good both 

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:55.470
 together they serve each one separately in 

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:57.760
 any kind of serves very much 

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:59.770
 then what would become of the weapon in 

00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:02.050
 yes the advantage of the accessories 

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:04.810
 simple that depends on each weapon I 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:07.510
 I'm currently using the dcr and the 

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:09.430
 barista obviously we will like it a lot 

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:11.950
 more because the relationship with the ballista is 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:14.980
 of love-hate because it reminds me of l 11 

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:17.860
 I think it was called without getting wet 3 but without 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:19.930
 mark as a liner then 2900's 

00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:21.670
 heat it up and it happened to me and it changed me I say no 

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:23.620
 I know until bcr I do not wear clothes for the egg 

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:26.200
 but anyway then what comes to be 

00:03:23.620 --> 00:03:28.120
 capable configuration 

00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:29.260
 the class would already be that after the 

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:31.180
 setting here so that the 

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:32.890
 sensitivity that someone does not know very well 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:35.560
 that's what I'm talking about obviously I started 

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:38.080
 I play despite I'm not a player 

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:39.760
 consoles for them that dejuan pc the 

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:42.580
 configuration I believe sensitivity is of 

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:45.220
 0 to 30 and its margin of 0 30 are taken to 

00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:49.090
 the configuration I currently believe that 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:52.420
 I have it in 22 with something 22 I think more or 

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:54.430
 least to make a being a good 

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:56.110
 sniper and have more agility the 

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:59.440
 I recommend myself from 20 up 

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:01.480
 obviously that already a lot of ciro 25 

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:03.310
 up 30 thousand pesos because 30 is 

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:05.769
 for that which is with the straits and 

00:04:03.310 --> 00:04:08.140
 beating enrique lara but I say it is 

00:04:05.769 --> 00:04:11.230
 able that a 25 already exaggerates enough 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:13.810
 psychic so that in 2025 to start and 

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:16.180
 grab the wave is good that serves 

00:04:13.810 --> 00:04:19.600
 rather for what would be fisco nose 

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:23.200
 cop and good infinity of other things not 

00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:24.610
 is another thing that capable that serves you the 

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:27.470
 mouse 

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:31.640
 they must have configured to keep the 

00:04:27.470 --> 00:04:34.340
 point if you click and it gets 

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:36.020
 looks at it and when the click is released it 

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:38.540
 the look comes out because it's configured by 

00:04:36.020 --> 00:04:40.220
 default that I click is put 

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:42.650
 Look at her and click again to 

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:44.960
 take it out like it costs a lot of time 

00:04:42.650 --> 00:04:47.630
 and it takes away times for reaction and 

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:48.740
 countless issues that bring me 

00:04:47.630 --> 00:04:52.120
 problems here so that you have left 

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:56.030
 more like that but I'll leave it like that 

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:58.640
 so what else do the tactics that 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:05:01.070
 I have the ability to start with the quiz 

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:04.190
 as you see the four 

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:07.100
 little dots or lines that appear to you 

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:09.740
 they help or if they see them well that's useful for 

00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:11.390
 that the horizontal ones will give you more or 

00:05:09.740 --> 00:05:14.240
 minus the height at which the bullet will go 

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:17.780
 and the verticals rather direct you 

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:19.990
 to which I refer rather 

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:22.850
 as we can in a 360 degree turn 

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:26.690
 where she danced that helps us more 

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:28.310
 well in the quisco that good to all we 

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:30.320
 like to crunch obviously then 

00:05:28.310 --> 00:05:32.960
 what they have to try to do is 

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:35.389
 fix the enemy the most to the center 

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:36.770
 possible of those four sights for 

00:05:35.389 --> 00:05:38.330
 make sure that the bullet is capable of 

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:40.400
 hit like for example there's injustice you 

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:42.560
 hit justito because because the center 

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:44.660
 the mile is also the track shot 

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:46.340
 since it is devastating you aim 

00:05:44.660 --> 00:05:47.660
 drag the look and then hit him I think 

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:50.090
 which is called if I'm not sure I 

00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:51.740
 name I do not have much idea is more or 

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:54.230
 less of the same here is there that 

00:05:51.740 --> 00:05:56.990
 It influences more a small notion of how 

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:59.450
 you know the map I do not know to them to 

00:05:56.990 --> 00:06:02.690
 you point then to know by 

00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:04.100
 where the fool comes the enemy and you 

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:07.040
 I already talked there they can point you 

00:06:04.100 --> 00:06:09.830
 dragging the weapon and going to hog it and 

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:13.490
 well there are countless other kilos 

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:16.040
 also not after we can say the 

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:19.160
 tactics that I have if you are able to 

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:21.050
 are just beginning is when you 

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:22.460
 turn a corner and if it seems like a 

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:24.289
 enemy that the most common 

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:26.180
 and under the sniper not the encounter 

00:06:24.289 --> 00:06:30.069
 body to body then I that you 

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:30.069
 I recommend you do is grab 

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:34.990
 and obviously having a little bit of calm down 

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:37.610
 you know you are running and folding 

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:40.250
 stop running to at least have 

00:06:37.610 --> 00:06:42.940
 a time to come is to prevent that 

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:46.820
 regret as they say the saying then 

00:06:42.940 --> 00:06:49.310
 you double and when the 

00:06:46.820 --> 00:06:51.470
 crazy you shoot right away is 

00:06:49.310 --> 00:06:55.130
 making us as a quiz with what most 

00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:56.510
 like but they shoot with the 

00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:57.830
 finger that would be the one that is at 

00:06:56.510 --> 00:06:59.660
 insulting side enjoys with him and he 

00:06:57.830 --> 00:07:01.460
 squeeze the o with and christie throws the 

00:06:59.660 --> 00:07:05.840
 authors 

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:08.030
 press 1 2 1 to change directly 

00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:09.740
 to the second secondary alarm and now 

00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:11.930
 have secured here at least if not 

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:12.949
 they gave him they are not going to be able to kill you they are going to 

00:07:11.930 --> 00:07:15.680
 have a chance to kill him with the 

00:07:12.949 --> 00:07:16.699
 This is called secondary tactic 

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:19.039
 start 

00:07:16.699 --> 00:07:20.930
 obviously he wants to make whiskey 

00:07:19.039 --> 00:07:23.180
 with quickoffice or is at the beginning 

00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:25.400
 it costs and obviously capable that to me more 

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:26.930
 with pin I think you will have been given 

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:29.750
 account in the game there are many times 

00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:31.310
 that he pointed and scored late because what 

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:33.620
 happens and there I'm just pointing 

00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:36.590
 those influences a lot on the subject of 

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:38.780
 ping also influences is something that I here 

00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:41.660
 for example heat red horribly already 

00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:43.639
 the game is ending does not kill me 

00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:45.139
 but well I hope thanks to a series of 

00:07:43.639 --> 00:07:47.330
 Please sign boards are 

00:07:45.139 --> 00:07:49.669
 it goes on like that was if they are not 

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:50.960
 subscribe if I obviously said like pongan 

00:07:49.669 --> 00:07:53.780
 in favorites and there they have the last 

00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:55.880
 death what is that gold that but other 

00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:58.699
 Sometimes another cute part starting a 25 8 

00:07:55.880 --> 00:08:00.319
 the sword with 240,000 and well I hope that 

00:07:58.699 --> 00:08:02.710
 you liked it until the next 

00:08:00.319 --> 00:08:02.710
 charito
