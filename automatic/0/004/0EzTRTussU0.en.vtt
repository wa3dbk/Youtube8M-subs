as<00:00:01.079> you<00:00:01.260> may<00:00:01.439> know<00:00:01.469> from<00:00:01.709> my<00:00:02.159> previous<00:00:02.720> videos

00:00:03.710 --> 00:00:03.720 
as you may know from my previous videos

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:06.550 
as you may know from my previous videos
that<00:00:04.200> I<00:00:04.230> believe<00:00:04.710> that<00:00:04.740> the<00:00:05.130> first<00:00:05.520> seal<00:00:06.060> of

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:06.560 
that I believe that the first seal of

00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:08.650 
that I believe that the first seal of
revelation<00:00:07.560> has<00:00:07.710> already<00:00:07.980> been<00:00:08.309> opened

00:00:08.650 --> 00:00:08.660 
revelation has already been opened

00:00:08.660 --> 00:00:10.580 
revelation has already been opened
indicating<00:00:09.660> that<00:00:09.750> we've<00:00:09.900> entered<00:00:10.230> into<00:00:10.500> the

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:10.590 
indicating that we've entered into the

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.320 
indicating that we've entered into the
time<00:00:10.830> of<00:00:11.010> the<00:00:11.099> end<00:00:11.250> and<00:00:11.490> the<00:00:11.580> last<00:00:11.820> generation

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:12.330 
time of the end and the last generation

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:14.959 
time of the end and the last generation
I<00:00:12.809> also<00:00:13.679> believe<00:00:14.190> that<00:00:14.219> we're<00:00:14.549> at<00:00:14.639> a<00:00:14.670> point

00:00:14.959 --> 00:00:14.969 
I also believe that we're at a point

00:00:14.969 --> 00:00:16.970 
I also believe that we're at a point
where<00:00:15.150> the<00:00:15.450> second<00:00:15.929> seal<00:00:16.170> may<00:00:16.470> be<00:00:16.529> open<00:00:16.949> very

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980 
where the second seal may be open very

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:20.210 
where the second seal may be open very

00:00:56.779 --> 00:00:56.789 
it it doesn't require a biblical scholar

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:00.319

a great philosopher or somebody special

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.799 
a great philosopher or somebody special
as<00:01:00.719> a<00:01:00.780> matter<00:01:01.230> of<00:01:01.379> fact<00:01:01.730> the<00:01:02.730> Bible<00:01:03.000> is<00:01:03.539> written

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
as a matter of fact the Bible is written

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:08.200 
as a matter of fact the Bible is written
for<00:01:04.229> the<00:01:04.320> common<00:01:04.830> man<00:01:04.860> for<00:01:05.820> the<00:01:06.270> people<00:01:06.780> of<00:01:06.930> God

for the common man for the people of God

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:11.480 
for the common man for the people of God
so<00:01:09.210> if<00:01:09.450> we<00:01:09.479> can<00:01:09.840> accept<00:01:10.350> what<00:01:10.619> the<00:01:10.740> Bible<00:01:11.159> says

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:11.490 
so if we can accept what the Bible says

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:14.660 
so if we can accept what the Bible says
the<00:01:12.479> prophecy<00:01:12.930> is<00:01:13.500> history<00:01:14.250> written<00:01:14.460> in

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:22.670 
advance and that the Bible can be read
and<00:01:19.560> understood<00:01:20.490> by<00:01:20.909> the<00:01:20.970> people<00:01:21.090> of<00:01:21.450> God<00:01:21.720> then

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:22.680 
and understood by the people of God then

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:24.590 
and understood by the people of God then
