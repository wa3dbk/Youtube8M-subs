00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:26.520
 to increase heat transfer efficiency 

00:03:24.990 --> 00:03:28.680
 used four copper thermal 

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:30.450
 tubes with a diameter of 6 millimeters to 

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.920
 Unfortunately, they are not covered with a layer of nickel 

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:33.870
 which prevents oxidation 

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:35.070
 copper that in the future may negatively 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:37.200
 affect cooling performance 

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:39.090
 herewith the contact of the heat pipes with 

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:41.310
 copper base and radiator fins 

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:43.410

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:53.730
 rises 

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:55.380
 so you should be careful when 

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:57.780
 removing the video card immediately after 

00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:59.160
