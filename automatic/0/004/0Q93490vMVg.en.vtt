00:00:08.399 --> 00:00:11.889
 and which medical video tutorial about son on the road 

00:00:11.889 --> 00:00:16.049
 in this video I know you shorter the nicest functions of the tram line pinks 

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:17.409
 show the program 

00:00:17.409 --> 00:00:21.639
 and to start with there must of course go to the pp weekend both print that comes 

00:00:22.499 --> 00:00:24.779
 and you can immediately start designing 

00:00:24.779 --> 00:00:25.909
 sick animals 

00:00:25.909 --> 00:00:29.810
 that is not necessary if you are playing everything with the program 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:35.370
 but learn to save work or share ugly with your friends then you can score best 

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.370
 can do it the slowaken tryntsje can do it 

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:44.530
 that is already known, the costs 10 in July less strong than expected 

00:00:44.530 --> 00:00:46.390
 becomes 6 

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:49.390
 enter mc e-mail address 

00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:56.610
 I studied 

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:59.100
 nrc left 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:04.780
 if you add three students here the work is also in tip fierce rain transumo 

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:05.519
 justly 

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:07.400
 Jessica Lidell's ambition 

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.670
 The king of other people's work can also prevent French fries 

00:01:12.760 --> 00:01:15.760
 there's a whole community part that 

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:18.940
 the police are reminiscent of the twitters 

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:23.090
 but what interests us is of course the actual program and she thinks so 

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:25.640
 flies when buying and to zoom on thinks 

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:28.820
 m then you got the windows jet in niel 

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:30.400
 juice 

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:33.400
 and as you can see, peace is familiar 

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:38.590
 but the program is especially good at generating part to the spot at 

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:40.050
 are made for people who 

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:44.740
 m not really have a steady hand and I'm going to see that with the theme he has 

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:49.000
 this is my club but all the king style i have absolutely no steady hand 

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.720
 but when she is tired and chooses something called a qwerty 

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:57.210
 m as you occupied 

00:01:57.210 --> 00:01:59.310
 that goes the lines automatically 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.150
 and make the soft you will see you 

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:03.060
 you can 

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.069
 delay that too 

00:02:05.069 --> 00:02:07.090
 it had to move a little faster 

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:11.190
 that it takes something closer and geert speed comes both 

00:02:13.369 --> 00:02:17.980
 and it already knows a lot the time than those lines below 

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:19.949
 you can do that 

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:24.679
 very hard and then it will automatically put all your life to the side 

00:02:24.679 --> 00:02:26.309
 life 

00:02:26.309 --> 00:02:29.559
 Willemsen increases nothing to do about it, but one thing keeps recording 

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:35.209
 and that is helps in when they come 

00:02:35.209 --> 00:02:38.209
 I also want to make horrible images here 

00:02:39.269 --> 00:02:43.060
 and the second ceramic journalist team at christie's cinekid 

00:02:44.109 --> 00:02:47.109
 I know you are the other insurgents 

00:02:48.789 --> 00:02:53.069
 and if you are with you this is automatic 6 11 34 

00:02:54.429 --> 00:02:59.079
 no matter how breast inflammation is ipad here I see I see before 14 

00:02:59.079 --> 00:03:01.769
 and he puts it in the circle automatically 

00:03:01.769 --> 00:03:04.819
 it is the peat easily created that way 

00:03:05.939 --> 00:03:07.729
 with all kinds of strangers 

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:10.929
 make constructions 

00:03:10.929 --> 00:03:15.519
 19 itself not even the easy but capcom to futuristic entrance 

00:03:16.089 --> 00:03:18.659
 to make a drawing 

00:03:18.659 --> 00:03:21.849
 then you can do shots for tips you can choose 

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:27.000
 how much if the mission police deploy and whether or not you 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.409
 always use the same colors 

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:32.779
 and that simek sutil is automatically km u 

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:36.909
 and still not an easy way to do something 

00:03:36.909 --> 00:03:39.629
 when to make the colombière 

00:03:39.629 --> 00:03:42.749
 and it's really hard so don't do anything with that 

00:03:42.749 --> 00:03:45.829
 rafferty to be beautiful is of course another matter 

00:03:47.699 --> 00:03:54.889
 and also such a handy function to generate 7 the machine they shit logically 

00:03:54.889 --> 00:03:57.809
 paste a new flat 

00:03:57.809 --> 00:04:00.939
 and I am seeing you at 10 13 Sep street 

00:04:01.899 --> 00:04:04.229
 you can also change the filling 

00:04:04.229 --> 00:04:06.219
 after something that you like 

00:04:06.219 --> 00:04:09.729
 and you have a number of chips you have lived castigating 

00:04:11.539 --> 00:04:14.539
 red offline makes you have and 

00:04:15.519 --> 00:04:18.090
 kwakman king the ship 

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:21.090
 and you have a study that is per and 

00:04:22.129 --> 00:04:23.499
 five groups 

00:04:23.499 --> 00:04:26.689
 they change as more digests 

00:04:26.689 --> 00:04:29.839
 and that is especially nice if you do that at 7 charles z 

00:04:30.650 --> 00:04:34.500
 because then you get m soft sketch effects 

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:37.110
 but the more to see 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:37.990
 free 

00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:40.879
 the fin with the combination of format can 

00:04:40.879 --> 00:04:43.710
 the making 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:46.710
 6 

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:54.059
 for instance 

00:04:54.059 --> 00:04:57.639
 identical shape joost such a shot peter won loan tools 

00:05:03.039 --> 00:05:06.219
 are you because you can 

00:05:06.219 --> 00:05:08.779
 quote matisse 

00:05:08.779 --> 00:05:13.919
 Sweden can make points or even ditches something that reaches on a lantern 

00:05:13.919 --> 00:05:16.889
 then that is all fake simple 

00:05:16.889 --> 00:05:19.930
 that I still show here said some of the machine is the 

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:26.910
 filter cigarettes there quite a lot of me also recognize from for cultivation m for 

00:05:26.909 --> 00:05:28.099
 top shop 

00:05:28.099 --> 00:05:29.860
 clooney and 

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:33.319
 make it square 

00:05:33.319 --> 00:05:36.319
 work 

00:05:37.699 --> 00:05:41.740
 Make the chamber cylinders out of them you see as perspective polling under the 

00:05:41.740 --> 00:05:42.490
 bees 

00:05:42.490 --> 00:05:47.120
 in a bad landscape it all got tiles with that in the sign 

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:50.120
 not sick and 

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:57.620
 and then another money to go effectively with the filters, certainly the one with how 

00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:58.509
 is beautiful 

00:05:58.509 --> 00:06:01.339
 only list you should now he also knows of 

00:06:01.339 --> 00:06:02.439
 others 

00:06:02.439 --> 00:06:03.800
 programs 

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:08.180
 it's especially handy to have contacts but this time don't post one 

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:09.960
 diplomat 

00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:12.960
 after a green left is in the making 

00:06:17.809 --> 00:06:22.069
 as a kind of polk a backward country that is very handy 

00:06:22.069 --> 00:06:23.770
 then you can 

00:06:23.770 --> 00:06:25.309
 a whole lot for that 

00:06:25.309 --> 00:06:28.309
 release filters 

00:06:33.469 --> 00:06:36.990
 it is also something that supertrash made quickly and without too much 

00:06:40.319 --> 00:06:41.990
 and experience 

00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:43.199
 all that something 

00:06:43.199 --> 00:06:46.680
 can make it look great again and again 

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:49.680
 the program also takes a lot of what others do 

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:52.589
 bind programs when you have and kolo touré you can 

00:06:52.589 --> 00:06:58.649
 cut and paste baarn pieces and you can share the flipper 

00:06:59.649 --> 00:07:01.319
 around ten we set 

00:07:01.319 --> 00:07:06.639
 I drive the time especially let yourself experiment I suggest you 

00:07:06.639 --> 00:07:08.949
 against nac all your image one 

00:07:08.949 --> 00:07:12.360
 share with the rest of the world i will show the pupils how you do that 

00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:13.089
 is doing 

00:07:13.089 --> 00:07:16.089
 you give to think how a helmet 

00:07:16.639 --> 00:07:21.509
 you can both love it here or your other people have that possible 

00:07:21.509 --> 00:07:22.169
 know it 

00:07:22.169 --> 00:07:25.860
 how or whether translation is from rio or not even allowed to see it 

00:07:26.819 --> 00:07:29.819
 click on the safe 

00:07:30.759 --> 00:07:34.729
 and you would then later in you know I find it in scaling rains 

00:07:34.729 --> 00:07:35.160
 hall 

00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:36.389
 have seen 

00:07:36.389 --> 00:07:38.879
 fortuyn 

00:07:38.879 --> 00:07:41.809
 not 

00:07:41.809 --> 00:07:44.809
 I probably already had to look away 

00:07:55.539 --> 00:07:58.539
 and there 

00:07:59.999 --> 00:08:02.069
 we can close your success
