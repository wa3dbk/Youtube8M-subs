00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:17.910
 hello everyone and welcome to a new 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:21.119
 episode of marvel ajax adventures and 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.740
 I now we're going to the big final 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:26.990
 last one who dreams to complete 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.990
 absolutely special operation 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:33.610
 or if 

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:37.620
 although we are going to be happy against what 

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:37.620
 which is actually Valkyrie 

00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:45.910
 and well we have that is a strategist 

00:00:46.999 --> 00:00:51.920
 so we need spies 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:57.250
 and well I think that just like in the 

00:00:54.880 --> 00:01:00.520
 previous we are going to use the nocturnal and 

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:02.440
 is not no to any and this 

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:04.900
 mandatorily so let's use 

00:01:02.440 --> 00:01:07.900
 better to spider-man why because 

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:09.610
 spider-man sees himself and also 

00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:13.210
 has this apart from its counterattack 

00:01:09.610 --> 00:01:16.550
 He said when he counterattacks he puts it 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:19.100
 put enemy status on the web 

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:22.190
 and that will give us an advantage when we 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:24.170
 touch us we can not use this the 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:26.270
 third skill of spider-man for 

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:29.120
 cause more damage while the enemy is 

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:31.700
 found on the web instead of spider 

00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:35.670
 man if you do not have him 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:37.900
 could you use 

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:42.280
 for example 

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:44.860
 when it is in phase it does a lot of damage 

00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.600
 if you use the second round is the 

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:48.759
 movement seems to me I do not know when very 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.020
 ok but yes but there is also very 

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:52.930
 good when it is in phase 

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:55.539
 you use you use phase and with that goals 

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:58.799
 the damage good I'm also going to 

00:01:55.539 --> 00:01:58.799
 turn into a spy 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:05.360
 very well and once 

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:23.250
 ok again it's going slow on this 

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:26.470
 well as I said there is 

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:31.830
 counterattack places the enemy in the 

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:31.830
 fabric and already with that I have some window 

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:40.060
 this is not for nothing 

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:46.870
 well then there is the meaning of 

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:46.870
 nest 

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:52.550
 and as an enemy you are already in the 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:54.510
 good cloth first to know who you 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:58.990
 play this time 

00:02:54.510 --> 00:03:02.490
 of May ok gave me to see the samples 

00:02:58.990 --> 00:03:06.620
 has been taken such purpose 

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:09.879
 moving with hair all right 

00:03:06.620 --> 00:03:09.879
 molting kick 

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:16.670
 after that 

00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:18.830
 and it seems that he wants to disappear 

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:22.820
 illusion but good no matter we're going to 

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:25.970
 win anyway critical winds 

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:27.770
 double critical winds if they did not have the 

00:03:25.970 --> 00:03:31.590
 fabric would probably do much less 

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:34.470
 damage and the type would be going 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:37.129
 if not that very low it would be a damage 

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:37.129
 normal 

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:41.720
 today we are going to use the spear the mini spear 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:50.920
 good just for an attack does not matter 

00:03:48.069 --> 00:03:54.100
 good what imbalance removes all 

00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:57.660
 the effects of counterattack 

00:03:54.100 --> 00:04:01.610
 ok they do not have any bus 

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:01.610
 grants yellow virgilio 

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:09.549
 grant the allies go down because 

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:12.280
 still did not play doctor valqui life 

00:04:09.549 --> 00:04:14.489
 something that does not serve me much 

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:14.489
 let say 

00:04:14.590 --> 00:04:20.799
 and it was that it was 

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:20.799
 more acid defense 

00:04:21.770 --> 00:04:26.090
 although I believe that everyone can stand me 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:32.430
 we can use this to decrease its 

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:32.430
 defending 

00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:41.660
 where can 

00:04:43.820 --> 00:04:49.180
 mother this is pretty 

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:53.370
 everything is signed shows that you are 

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:56.520
 running a normal because I think it's 

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:59.960
 thing of the game not of my computer good 

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:03.870
 again we have the Valkyrie 

00:04:59.960 --> 00:05:07.590
 drawing that on the cloth 

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:10.560
 so let's go again to use wave 

00:05:07.590 --> 00:05:14.570
 cobweb to cause more damage there is 

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:14.570
 critical critical winds 

00:05:14.800 --> 00:05:20.250
 a simple combo of spider-man 

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:30.030
 what when I wait for you to hear me the 

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:30.030
 voice and associate it very short 

00:05:30.689 --> 00:05:35.809
 although it is again on the web 

00:05:33.089 --> 00:05:35.809
 the lion you're worth 

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:42.350
 not that simple this is all 

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:42.350
 extremely easy 

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:49.879
 really this special operation is not 

00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:49.879
 understands like a story in it 

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:54.190
 A) Yes 

00:05:54.830 --> 00:06:00.150
 very well give me points please I need 

00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:04.920
 points points 

00:06:00.150 --> 00:06:04.920
 it takes me half 

00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:11.080
 nothing more because what I did 

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:14.810
 more because my throat hurts if not 

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:19.870
 I would be saying that of things 

00:06:14.810 --> 00:06:19.870
 good magic and this mission completed 

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:24.940
 almost two stars 

00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:30.230
 and well I think that's it and everything with this 

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:33.200
 we have completed the special operation 

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:35.540
 I can rest calmly knowing 

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:37.660
 that patient the special operation for 

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:40.660
 at least once 

00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:43.270
 and well then I think that's all 

00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:45.940
 we will see you in the next episode where 

00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:48.010
 we will continue with the story mode 

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:50.080
 we will continue with chapter 10 so 

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:53.850
 we'll see you in another episode of marvel 

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:53.850
 Ajax skills until then
