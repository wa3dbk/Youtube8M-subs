00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.979
 besides youtube is very sensitive 

00:01:05.059 --> 00:01:09.970
 lately with everything you can not put 

00:01:06.979 --> 00:01:09.970
 practically nothing 

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.580
 we start dominating 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:26.500
 This is the best bryant I've seen 

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:26.500
 in what we call the species are four 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:35.020
 I wanted to get some better there is an xbox 

00:01:32.619 --> 00:01:37.290
 which is that it's amazing compared to 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:37.290
 this 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:41.060
 the cooperator 

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.730
 I like black screen that is not 

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.390
 nothing 

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:53.390

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:58.320

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:27.549
 account 11 

00:02:31.459 --> 00:02:35.269

00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:59.510

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:06.100
 I have not put managers for a 

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:08.800
 reason I think that 

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:11.300
 they will not be there 

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.560
 surely good not the authority is not going 

00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:14.569
 to be in favor of bryant to which lópez 

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:17.590
 It was thought languages 

00:03:14.569 --> 00:03:17.590
 Of course 

00:03:18.660 --> 00:03:25.730

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.730
 go 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:31.110

00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:33.710
 strings what is what I've been trying 

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:33.710

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:56.280
 there we are 

00:04:03.330 --> 00:04:10.630
 is that I have 

00:04:07.610 --> 00:04:10.630

00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:28.160
 and such a vitro 

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:31.310
 is that he stood in the middle and he has made me 

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:32.790
 it took half an hour for a damn imbecile 

00:04:31.310 --> 00:04:35.570

00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:57.229

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:57.229
 base and it has made me laugh 

00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:01.400
