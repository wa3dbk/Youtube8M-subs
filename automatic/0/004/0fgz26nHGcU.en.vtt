animations basically up to now when

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:27.279 
animations basically up to now when
we've<00:00:25.160> use<00:00:25.939> actions<00:00:26.420> to<00:00:26.660> the<00:00:26.929> same<00:00:27.080> user

00:00:27.279 --> 00:00:27.289 
we've use actions to the same user

they've<00:00:28.580> been<00:00:28.910> very<00:00:28.970> boring<00:00:29.630> if<00:00:29.960> they<00:00:30.169> moved

00:00:30.579 --> 00:00:30.589 
they've been very boring if they moved

00:00:30.589 --> 00:00:32.589 
they've been very boring if they moved
at<00:00:30.800> a<00:00:30.830> constant<00:00:31.279> speed<00:00:31.460> for<00:00:31.970> right<00:00:32.150> or<00:00:32.390> they

00:00:32.589 --> 00:00:32.599 
at a constant speed for right or they

00:00:32.599 --> 00:00:34.930 
at a constant speed for right or they
don't<00:00:32.870> whatever<00:00:33.170> they've<00:00:33.530> been<00:00:33.710> doing<00:00:33.920> at<00:00:34.850> a

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:34.940 
don't whatever they've been doing at a

00:00:34.940 --> 00:00:36.819 
don't whatever they've been doing at a
constant<00:00:35.420> speed<00:00:35.600> so<00:00:36.230> what<00:00:36.379> we're<00:00:36.469> going<00:00:36.590> to<00:00:36.649> do

00:00:36.819 --> 00:00:36.829 
constant speed so what we're going to do

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:40.360 
constant speed so what we're going to do
we<00:00:37.039> need<00:00:37.340> some<00:00:37.629> animations<00:00:38.629> so<00:00:39.289> they<00:00:40.129> look<00:00:40.309> a

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:40.370 
we need some animations so they look a

00:00:40.370 --> 00:00:41.950 
we need some animations so they look a
bit<00:00:40.399> more<00:00:40.699> dynamic<00:00:40.940> and<00:00:41.420> how<00:00:41.480> they<00:00:41.809> actually

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:41.960 
bit more dynamic and how they actually

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:43.660 
bit more dynamic and how they actually
look<00:00:42.320> in<00:00:42.620> real<00:00:43.160> games

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:43.670 
look in real games

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:45.790 
look in real games
so<00:00:44.360> let's<00:00:44.570> go<00:00:44.840> ahead<00:00:44.989> and<00:00:45.170> open<00:00:45.440> up<00:00:45.620> our

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:45.800 
so let's go ahead and open up our

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:55.080 
so let's go ahead and open up our
project<00:00:52.899> now<00:00:53.899> you<00:00:53.960> just<00:00:54.230> want<00:00:54.379> to<00:00:54.410> go<00:00:54.559> to<00:00:54.590> your

00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:55.090 
project now you just want to go to your

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:59.610 
project now you just want to go to your
hello<00:00:56.090> world<00:00:56.180> scene<00:00:56.660> dot<00:00:56.870> cpp<00:00:57.850> yes<00:00:58.850> i'm<00:00:59.239> gonna

00:00:59.610 --> 00:00:59.620 
hello world scene dot cpp yes i'm gonna

00:00:59.620 --> 00:01:03.660 
hello world scene dot cpp yes i'm gonna
understand<00:01:00.620> a<00:01:00.739> little<00:01:00.920> bit<00:01:01.719> and<00:01:02.719> just<00:01:03.199> below

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:03.670 
understand a little bit and just below

00:01:03.670 --> 00:01:08.530 
understand a little bit and just below
add<00:01:04.670> in<00:01:05.030> your<00:01:05.239> sprite<00:01:06.460> will<00:01:07.460> create<00:01:08.030> an<00:01:08.180> action

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:08.540 
add in your sprite will create an action

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:13.630 
add in your sprite will create an action
called<00:01:08.840> auto<00:01:10.840> action<00:01:11.840> equals<00:01:12.530> mu<00:01:12.920> boy<00:01:13.220> so<00:01:13.490> it's

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:13.640 
called auto action equals mu boy so it's

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.929 
called auto action equals mu boy so it's
going<00:01:13.759> to<00:01:14.060> move<00:01:14.240> by<00:01:14.479> action<00:01:15.310> create<00:01:16.310> some

00:01:16.929 --> 00:01:16.939 
going to move by action create some

00:01:16.939 --> 00:01:19.090 
going to move by action create some
unsafe<00:01:17.630> reset<00:01:18.290> bones

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:19.100 
unsafe reset bones

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:21.460 
unsafe reset bones
we're<00:01:19.729> going<00:01:19.850> to<00:01:19.909> make<00:01:20.060> a<00:01:20.090> move<00:01:20.720> a<00:01:20.750> hundred

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:21.470 
we're going to make a move a hundred

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:24.270 
we're going to make a move a hundred
pixels<00:01:21.770> to<00:01:22.159> the<00:01:22.189> right<00:01:22.280> and<00:01:22.820> zero<00:01:23.119> pixels<00:01:23.329> up

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:24.280 
pixels to the right and zero pixels up

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:28.330 
pixels to the right and zero pixels up
and<00:01:25.869> we're<00:01:26.869> going<00:01:26.990> to<00:01:27.049> run<00:01:27.229> this<00:01:27.320> action<00:01:27.799> moist

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.340 
and we're going to run this action moist

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.510 
and we're going to run this action moist
boy<00:01:29.380> run<00:01:30.380> action<00:01:30.650> but<00:01:31.189> instead<00:01:31.340> it<00:01:31.490> just

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:31.520 
boy run action but instead it just

00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.179 
boy run action but instead it just
pouring<00:01:32.000> action<00:01:32.869> here<00:01:33.170> what<00:01:33.829> were<00:01:33.950> actually

00:01:34.179 --> 00:01:34.189 
pouring action here what were actually

00:01:34.189 --> 00:01:36.249 
pouring action here what were actually
going<00:01:34.549> to<00:01:34.640> do<00:01:34.759> is<00:01:35.119> going<00:01:35.450> to<00:01:35.540> put<00:01:36.079> our

00:01:36.249 --> 00:01:36.259 
going to do is going to put our

00:01:36.259 --> 00:01:38.319 
going to do is going to put our
animation<00:01:37.130> here<00:01:37.369> for<00:01:37.820> that<00:01:37.970> we're<00:01:38.149> going<00:01:38.270> to

00:01:38.319 --> 00:01:38.329 
animation here for that we're going to

00:01:38.329 --> 00:01:45.789 
animation here for that we're going to
do<00:01:38.479> ease<00:01:40.750> elastic<00:01:42.640> in<00:01:43.640> and<00:01:44.439> that's<00:01:45.439> the<00:01:45.530> one

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:45.799 
do ease elastic in and that's the one

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:49.749 
do ease elastic in and that's the one
colon<00:01:46.460> colon<00:01:47.049> create<00:01:48.049> i<00:01:48.320> specify<00:01:49.040> the<00:01:49.100> action

00:01:49.749 --> 00:01:49.759 
colon colon create i specify the action

00:01:49.759 --> 00:01:52.959 
colon colon create i specify the action
so<00:01:50.450> the<00:01:50.840> action<00:01:51.229> obviously<00:01:51.380> is<00:01:52.009> called<00:01:52.759> is

00:01:52.959 --> 00:01:52.969 
so the action obviously is called is

00:01:52.969 --> 00:01:54.609 
so the action obviously is called is
called<00:01:53.240> action<00:01:53.390> and<00:01:53.719> how<00:01:53.930> long<00:01:54.170> you<00:01:54.290> want<00:01:54.500> this

00:01:54.609 --> 00:01:54.619 
called action and how long you want this

00:01:54.619 --> 00:01:56.830 
called action and how long you want this
to<00:01:54.799> take<00:01:54.979> when<00:01:55.250> put<00:01:55.520> zero<00:01:56.000> point<00:01:56.270> five<00:01:56.450> for<00:01:56.719> the

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:56.840 
to take when put zero point five for the

00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:00.850 
to take when put zero point five for the
actual<00:01:57.350> easy<00:01:57.979> last<00:01:58.280> in/out<00:01:59.259> semicolon<00:02:00.259> and

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:00.860 
actual easy last in/out semicolon and

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:02.709 
actual easy last in/out semicolon and
now<00:02:01.039> when<00:02:01.250> we<00:02:01.369> run<00:02:01.549> it<00:02:01.700> you'll<00:02:01.909> see<00:02:02.210> what<00:02:02.509> this

00:02:02.709 --> 00:02:02.719 
now when we run it you'll see what this

00:02:02.719 --> 00:02:04.170 
now when we run it you'll see what this
earth<00:02:03.020> yes

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:04.180 
earth yes

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:09.010 
earth yes
in<00:02:05.180> second<00:02:06.189> it<00:02:07.189> should<00:02:07.369> be<00:02:07.430> a<00:02:07.549> low<00:02:07.789> cliff<00:02:08.090> a<00:02:08.300> now

00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:09.020 
in second it should be a low cliff a now

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:14.140 
in second it should be a low cliff a now
we're<00:02:09.259> ready<00:02:09.470> to<00:02:09.560> run<00:02:12.490> this<00:02:13.490> isn't<00:02:13.820> the<00:02:13.970> only

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:14.150 
we're ready to run this isn't the only

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:15.500 
we're ready to run this isn't the only
animation<00:02:14.750> that's

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:15.510 
animation that's

00:02:15.510 --> 00:02:18.080 
animation that's
