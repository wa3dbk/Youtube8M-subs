some work but you never get any kind of
nasty<00:01:41.649> kickback<00:01:42.630> there<00:01:43.630> are<00:01:43.720> never<00:01:43.840> any<00:01:43.960> kind

00:01:44.279 --> 00:01:44.289 
nasty kickback there are never any kind

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:49.200 
of sharp edges
it's<00:01:47.200> just<00:01:47.440> a<00:01:47.560> lovely<00:01:47.860> flow<00:01:48.760> of<00:01:49.060> information

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:49.210 
it's just a lovely flow of information

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:52.200 
it's just a lovely flow of information
that<00:01:49.810> comes<00:01:50.050> active<00:01:50.380> through<00:01:50.590> this<00:01:51.210> equally

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:52.210 
that comes active through this equally

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:54.090 
that comes active through this equally
lovely<00:01:52.510> rim<00:01:52.930> I<00:01:53.200> think<00:01:53.680> it's<00:01:53.800> one<00:01:53.920> of<00:01:53.950> the

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.100 
lovely rim I think it's one of the

00:01:54.100 --> 00:01:58.890 
lovely rim I think it's one of the
nicest<00:01:55.020> steering<00:01:56.020> systems<00:01:56.500> I<00:01:57.600> guess<00:01:58.600> on<00:01:58.750> any

00:01:58.890 --> 00:01:58.900 
nicest steering systems I guess on any

00:01:58.900 --> 00:02:00.390 
nicest steering systems I guess on any
car<00:01:59.230> I've<00:01:59.380> ever<00:01:59.410> driven<00:01:59.680> really<00:02:00.100> but

00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:00.400 
car I've ever driven really but

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.450 
car I've ever driven really but
certainly<00:02:00.790> probably<00:02:01.360> the<00:02:01.840> nicest<00:02:02.050> of<00:02:02.680> any<00:02:03.190> mom

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:03.460 
certainly probably the nicest of any mom

00:02:03.460 --> 00:02:07.470 
certainly probably the nicest of any mom
sports<00:02:03.820> car<00:02:04.150> I<00:02:05.370> think<00:02:06.370> possibly<00:02:06.760> even<00:02:07.180> better

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:07.480 
sports car I think possibly even better

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:10.050 
sports car I think possibly even better
than<00:02:07.690> the<00:02:07.780> steering<00:02:08.340> is<00:02:09.340> the<00:02:09.550> way<00:02:09.640> it<00:02:09.760> stops

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:10.060 
than the steering is the way it stops

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:12.600 
than the steering is the way it stops
but<00:02:10.600> now<00:02:10.690> I<00:02:10.720> don't<00:02:10.869> just<00:02:11.320> mean<00:02:11.590> the<00:02:11.980> power<00:02:12.310> of

00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:12.610 
but now I don't just mean the power of

00:02:12.610 --> 00:02:15.030 
but now I don't just mean the power of
the<00:02:12.730> brakes<00:02:12.990> there<00:02:13.990> are<00:02:14.110> many<00:02:14.260> cars<00:02:14.560> here<00:02:14.860> that

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.040 
the brakes there are many cars here that

00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:17.100 
the brakes there are many cars here that
have<00:02:15.220> a<00:02:15.430> hugely<00:02:15.910> powerful<00:02:16.210> brakes<00:02:16.690> and<00:02:17.020> which

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:17.110 
have a hugely powerful brakes and which

00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:18.840 
have a hugely powerful brakes and which
I<00:02:17.200> have<00:02:17.290> to<00:02:17.380> stop<00:02:17.650> very<00:02:18.010> well<00:02:18.250> if<00:02:18.490> you<00:02:18.580> really

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:18.850 
I have to stop very well if you really

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:21.420 
I have to stop very well if you really
stand<00:02:19.210> in<00:02:19.330> the<00:02:19.390> middle<00:02:19.570> pedal<00:02:19.950> well<00:02:20.950> this<00:02:21.160> car

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 
stand in the middle pedal well this car

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:24.150 
stand in the middle pedal well this car
also<00:02:21.880> adds<00:02:22.120> to<00:02:22.240> that<00:02:22.360> is<00:02:23.020> this<00:02:23.200> incredible

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:24.160 
also adds to that is this incredible

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:27.240 
also adds to that is this incredible
stability<00:02:24.400> over<00:02:25.000> the<00:02:25.120> bumps<00:02:25.450> and<00:02:26.130> around<00:02:27.130> the

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.250 
stability over the bumps and around the

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:30.190 
stability over the bumps and around the
canvas<00:02:27.520> that<00:02:27.850> there<00:02:28.000> are<00:02:28.150> a<00:02:28.180> good<00:02:28.450> width

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:30.200 
canvas that there are a good width

00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:32.320 
canvas that there are a good width
you<00:02:30.770> enter<00:02:31.010> a<00:02:31.069> braking<00:02:31.489> area<00:02:31.640> you<00:02:31.940> just<00:02:32.120> think

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:32.330 
you enter a braking area you just think

00:02:32.330 --> 00:02:33.970 
you enter a braking area you just think
what

00:02:33.970 --> 00:02:33.980 
what

00:02:33.980 --> 00:02:35.860 
what
I'm<00:02:34.430> going<00:02:34.670> to<00:02:34.730> stop<00:02:34.970> all<00:02:35.330> right<00:02:35.420> and<00:02:35.660> the

00:02:35.860 --> 00:02:35.870 
I'm going to stop all right and the
