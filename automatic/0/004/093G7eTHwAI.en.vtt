00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:46.950 
you see the let's see where the pumping

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:50.500 
you see the let's see where the pumping
is<00:00:47.070> not<00:00:47.250> coming<00:00:47.580> out<00:00:47.700> sufficiently<00:00:48.360> look

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:50.510 
is not coming out sufficiently look

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:35.680 

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:38.400 

there<00:01:36.550> it<00:01:36.670> is<00:01:36.760> guys<00:01:37.060> that<00:01:37.420> is<00:01:37.630> a<00:01:37.660> chemtrail

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:38.410 
there it is guys that is a chemtrail

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:42.380 
there it is guys that is a chemtrail
Rowland<00:01:39.600> there<00:01:40.600> it<00:01:40.720> is<00:01:40.840> my<00:01:41.110> friend

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:42.390 
Rowland there it is my friend

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:44.730 
Rowland there it is my friend
that<00:01:43.390> is<00:01:43.630> the<00:01:43.780> chemtrail<00:01:44.260> now<00:01:44.440> that<00:01:44.620> will<00:01:44.710> be

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:44.740 
that is the chemtrail now that will be

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:47.370 
that is the chemtrail now that will be
there<00:01:45.130> for<00:01:45.460> like<00:01:45.610> an<00:01:45.760> hour<00:01:46.030> hour<00:01:46.570> and<00:01:47.020> a<00:01:47.170> half

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:47.380 
there for like an hour hour and a half

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:50.670 
there for like an hour hour and a half
maybe<00:01:47.800> three<00:01:48.130> hours<00:01:48.910> as<00:01:49.630> it<00:01:49.810> slowly<00:01:50.260> just

00:01:50.670 --> 00:01:50.680 
maybe three hours as it slowly just

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:52.490 
maybe three hours as it slowly just
breaks<00:01:51.040> up

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
breaks up

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.620 
breaks up
and<00:01:52.860> disperses<00:01:53.580> into<00:01:53.760> the<00:01:53.970> atmosphere<00:01:54.120> that

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:54.630 
and disperses into the atmosphere that

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:56.030 
and disperses into the atmosphere that
you<00:01:54.660> can<00:01:54.900> see<00:01:55.080> there<00:01:55.290> it's<00:01:55.440> just<00:01:55.620> beginning<00:01:55.920> to

00:01:56.030 --> 00:01:56.040 
you can see there it's just beginning to

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:03.930 
you can see there it's just beginning to
disperse

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:03.940 

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:06.069 

take

00:02:06.069 --> 00:02:06.079 
take

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:10.630 
take
chemtrails<00:02:06.649> in<00:02:07.159> Phuket<00:02:08.769> caught<00:02:09.769> on<00:02:09.979> tape<00:02:10.280> at

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
chemtrails in Phuket caught on tape at

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:17.559 
chemtrails in Phuket caught on tape at
last<00:02:14.349> there<00:02:15.349> it<00:02:15.560> is

00:02:17.559 --> 00:02:17.569 
last there it is

00:02:17.569 --> 00:02:19.509 
last there it is
it's<00:02:18.019> not<00:02:18.170> a<00:02:18.200> controller<00:02:18.830> that<00:02:19.189> should<00:02:19.400> be

00:02:19.509 --> 00:02:19.519 
it's not a controller that should be

00:02:19.519 --> 00:02:21.100 
it's not a controller that should be
gone<00:02:19.700> now<00:02:19.970> if<00:02:20.030> that<00:02:20.239> was<00:02:20.360> water<00:02:20.599> vapor<00:02:20.930> that

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:21.110 
gone now if that was water vapor that

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:22.660 
gone now if that was water vapor that
would<00:02:21.409> have<00:02:21.560> dispersed<00:02:22.099> in<00:02:22.340> the<00:02:22.430> heat<00:02:22.640> and

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:22.670 
would have dispersed in the heat and

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:26.380 
would have dispersed in the heat and
disappeared<00:02:23.890> this<00:02:24.890> is<00:02:25.069> not<00:02:25.250> dispersing<00:02:26.060> at

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:26.390 
disappeared this is not dispersing at

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:33.320 
disappeared this is not dispersing at
all<00:02:28.000> it's<00:02:29.000> just<00:02:29.390> spreading

00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:33.330 

00:02:33.330 --> 00:02:35.870 

here<00:02:33.900> it<00:02:34.050> is<00:02:34.310> that<00:02:35.310> you<00:02:35.370> can<00:02:35.520> see<00:02:35.700> what

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880 
here it is that you can see what

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.670 
here it is that you can see what
finished<00:02:36.270> it<00:02:36.450> turned<00:02:36.720> on<00:02:36.840> turned<00:02:37.440> it<00:02:37.560> on<00:02:37.620> a

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680 
finished it turned on turned it on a

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:44.180 
finished it turned on turned it on a
little<00:02:37.920> bit<00:02:38.070> more<00:02:39.170> and<00:02:40.170> God<00:02:42.800> okay<00:02:43.800> here<00:02:44.040> we<00:02:44.160> are

again ler something unusual here look
can<00:02:46.680> you<00:02:46.710> see<00:02:46.980> the<00:02:47.100> shadow<00:02:47.430> of<00:02:47.730> the<00:02:47.880> chemtrail

00:02:48.470 --> 00:02:48.480 
can you see the shadow of the chemtrail

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.140 
can you see the shadow of the chemtrail
four<00:02:49.260> minutes<00:02:49.530> later<00:02:49.770> three<00:02:50.490> to<00:02:50.700> four<00:02:50.940> minutes

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150 
four minutes later three to four minutes

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:55.160 
four minutes later three to four minutes
later<00:02:52.400> on<00:02:53.400> the<00:02:53.460> actual<00:02:54.210> cloud<00:02:54.570> let<00:02:54.870> you<00:02:54.960> see

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170 
later on the actual cloud let you see

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:58.700 
later on the actual cloud let you see
that<00:02:55.380> look<00:02:55.740> you<00:02:55.980> see<00:02:56.190> the<00:02:56.310> actual<00:02:57.710> reflection

00:02:58.700 --> 00:02:58.710 
that look you see the actual reflection

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:00.830 
that look you see the actual reflection
of<00:02:58.860> the<00:02:58.980> chemtrail<00:02:59.550> on<00:02:59.790> the<00:02:59.940> cloudlet<00:03:00.510> look<00:03:00.690> at

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:00.840 
of the chemtrail on the cloudlet look at

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.670 
of the chemtrail on the cloudlet look at
that<00:03:02.630> see<00:03:03.630> look<00:03:03.780> comes<00:03:04.020> right<00:03:04.260> the<00:03:04.290> way<00:03:04.470> from

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:04.680 
that see look comes right the way from

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:05.960 
that see look comes right the way from
over<00:03:04.830> there<00:03:05.040> look<00:03:05.310> there's<00:03:05.520> a<00:03:05.610> counter<00:03:05.940> that

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
over there look there's a counter that

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.150 
over there look there's a counter that
must<00:03:06.360> be<00:03:06.420> that's<00:03:06.720> obviously<00:03:07.080> much<00:03:07.470> older<00:03:08.010> than

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:08.160 
must be that's obviously much older than

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:09.710 
must be that's obviously much older than
the<00:03:08.310> one<00:03:08.340> we're<00:03:08.640> looking<00:03:08.910> at<00:03:09.030> now<00:03:09.210> that<00:03:09.240> it's

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:09.720 
the one we're looking at now that it's

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.380 
the one we're looking at now that it's
still<00:03:10.020> there<00:03:10.350> you<00:03:10.620> can<00:03:11.400> almost<00:03:11.640> see<00:03:12.030> it<00:03:12.120> going

00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:12.390 
still there you can almost see it going

00:03:12.390 --> 00:03:17.180 
still there you can almost see it going
right<00:03:12.750> through<00:03:12.780> the<00:03:13.230> cloud<00:03:13.530> and<00:03:15.890> there<00:03:16.890> look

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:17.190 
right through the cloud and there look

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:21.890 
right through the cloud and there look
at<00:03:17.340> that<00:03:17.520> shadow<00:03:17.930> what<00:03:18.930> is<00:03:19.230> that<00:03:19.530> stuff<00:03:20.900> hey

at that shadow what is that stuff hey

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:24.230 
at that shadow what is that stuff hey
that<00:03:22.350> can<00:03:22.530> reflect<00:03:22.860> so<00:03:23.370> highly<00:03:23.820> on<00:03:23.940> to<00:03:24.120> the

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:24.240 
that can reflect so highly on to the

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:29.330 
that can reflect so highly on to the
shed<00:03:24.480> on<00:03:24.720> to<00:03:24.870> the<00:03:24.990> cloud<00:03:25.200> underneath<00:03:28.100> what<00:03:29.100> is

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
shed on to the cloud underneath what is

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:32.270 
shed on to the cloud underneath what is
it<00:03:29.670> what's<00:03:30.300> in<00:03:30.510> it

00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:32.280 
it what's in it

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:37.640

we don't know but look this is now four
five<00:03:38.070> minutes<00:03:38.310> later<00:03:38.730> than<00:03:39.120> it<00:03:39.240> laughter<00:03:39.570> the

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:45.420 
if anything it looks more solid than

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:47.930 
if anything it looks more solid than
when<00:03:45.570> it<00:03:45.660> was<00:03:45.720> sprayed<00:03:46.140> ler<00:03:46.700> look<00:03:47.700> at<00:03:47.820> that

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 
shadow look at that it just goes to show

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.170 
shadow look at that it just goes to show
you<00:03:58.620> that<00:03:59.190> the<00:03:59.280> shadow<00:03:59.490> is<00:03:59.610> that<00:03:59.820> the<00:03:59.910> plane

00:04:00.170 --> 00:04:00.180 
you that the shadow is that the plane

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:01.790 
you that the shadow is that the plane
cutting<00:04:00.660> through<00:04:00.900> the<00:04:01.020> cloud<00:04:01.320> it<00:04:01.530> could<00:04:01.710> have

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:01.800 
cutting through the cloud it could have

00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:02.960 
cutting through the cloud it could have
been<00:04:01.920> the<00:04:02.070> plane<00:04:02.280> cutting<00:04:02.640> through<00:04:02.850> the

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:02.970 
been the plane cutting through the

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:06.290 
been the plane cutting through the
clouds<00:04:03.270> yeah<00:04:03.660> yeah<00:04:04.670> well<00:04:05.670> it<00:04:05.760> could<00:04:05.940> just<00:04:06.090> be

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:06.300 
clouds yeah yeah well it could just be

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:08.000 
clouds yeah yeah well it could just be
the<00:04:06.450> shadow<00:04:06.690> because<00:04:07.020> it<00:04:07.140> seems<00:04:07.380> to<00:04:07.530> mimic<00:04:07.890> the

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.010 
the shadow because it seems to mimic the

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:10.310 
the shadow because it seems to mimic the
chemtrails<00:04:08.550> so<00:04:08.820> so<00:04:09.240> specifically<00:04:09.870> almost

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:10.320 
chemtrails so so specifically almost

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:16.560 
chemtrails so so specifically almost
parallel<00:04:12.320> who<00:04:13.320> knows

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:16.570 

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:21.380 

something<00:04:17.380> ain't<00:04:17.530> right<00:04:17.710> that<00:04:18.310> is<00:04:19.300> for<00:04:19.870> sure

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:21.390 
something ain't right that is for sure

00:04:21.390 --> 00:04:25.800 
something ain't right that is for sure
look<00:04:22.390> at<00:04:22.510> it<00:04:22.630> it's<00:04:22.990> not<00:04:23.200> going<00:04:23.590> away<00:04:24.810> stays

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:25.810 
look at it it's not going away stays

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:31.170 
look at it it's not going away stays
there<00:04:26.140> for<00:04:26.670> hours<00:04:29.460> okay<00:04:30.460> let's<00:04:30.700> come<00:04:30.850> back<00:04:30.880> in

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:31.180 
there for hours okay let's come back in

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:35.370 
there for hours okay let's come back in
a<00:04:31.270> bit<00:04:31.590> and<00:04:32.590> see<00:04:32.770> if<00:04:32.860> it's<00:04:32.980> still<00:04:33.190> it<00:04:34.020> well<00:04:35.020> it's

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:35.380 
a bit and see if it's still it well it's

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:39.750 
a bit and see if it's still it well it's
been<00:04:35.710> exactly<00:04:36.240> 15<00:04:37.240> minutes<00:04:37.660> now<00:04:38.430> and<00:04:39.430> it's

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:39.760 
been exactly 15 minutes now and it's

00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:48.820 
been exactly 15 minutes now and it's
just<00:04:40.090> all<00:04:40.470> clouds

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:48.830 

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:51.480 

I<00:04:48.920> don't<00:04:49.520> think<00:04:49.580> it's<00:04:49.940> dispersed<00:04:50.480> at<00:04:50.720> all<00:04:50.870> but

00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:51.490 
I don't think it's dispersed at all but

00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:54.130 
I don't think it's dispersed at all but
there's<00:04:52.490> just<00:04:52.700> nothing<00:04:53.270> but<00:04:53.450> clouds<00:04:53.690> now

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:54.140 
there's just nothing but clouds now

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:55.860 
there's just nothing but clouds now
maybe<00:04:54.470> they'd<00:04:54.680> come<00:04:54.950> anyway

00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:55.870 
maybe they'd come anyway

00:04:55.870 --> 00:05:01.810 
maybe they'd come anyway
maybe<00:04:56.870> not<00:04:57.380> tough<00:04:57.860> to<00:04:58.220> say<00:05:00.580> okay<00:05:01.580> it's<00:05:01.760> about

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:01.820 
maybe not tough to say okay it's about

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:09.130 
maybe not tough to say okay it's about
an<00:05:02.030> hour<00:05:02.270> later<00:05:03.880> and<00:05:04.880> as<00:05:05.030> you<00:05:05.300> can<00:05:05.510> see<00:05:08.140> there

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:09.140 
an hour later and as you can see there

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:13.150 
an hour later and as you can see there
it<00:05:09.290> is<00:05:09.380> right<00:05:09.740> there<00:05:11.560> it<00:05:12.560> hasn't<00:05:13.010> gone

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:13.160 
it is right there it hasn't gone

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:15.420 
it is right there it hasn't gone
anywhere<00:05:13.640> it's<00:05:13.820> just<00:05:13.910> sitting<00:05:14.090> in<00:05:14.510> the<00:05:14.600> sky

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:15.430 
anywhere it's just sitting in the sky

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:22.080 
anywhere it's just sitting in the sky
you<00:05:16.430> see<00:05:16.490> the<00:05:16.760> skies<00:05:17.000> change

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:22.090 

00:05:22.090 --> 00:05:30.420 

so<00:05:22.690> the<00:05:22.840> line<00:05:23.050> hasn't<00:05:26.400> see<00:05:27.400> you<00:05:27.460> there

00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:30.430 

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:35.470 

directly<00:05:31.430> underneath<00:05:31.730> the<00:05:32.030> clouds<00:05:34.300> what<00:05:35.300> is

00:05:35.470 --> 00:05:35.480 
directly underneath the clouds what is

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:39.239 
directly underneath the clouds what is
it

00:05:39.239 --> 00:05:39.249 

00:05:39.249 --> 00:05:44.210 

just<00:05:39.849> sits<00:05:40.179> there

00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:46.470 
have no idea what that is you can see a

00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:48.110 
have no idea what that is you can see a
pattern<00:05:46.740> in<00:05:46.950> it<00:05:47.130> look<00:05:47.280> like<00:05:47.310> it's<00:05:47.880> being

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:48.120 
pattern in it look like it's being

00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:58.340 
pattern in it look like it's being
humped<00:05:54.350> cilia<00:05:56.690> chemtrails<00:05:57.690> well<00:05:58.050> are<00:05:58.200> they

00:05:58.340 --> 00:05:58.350 
humped cilia chemtrails well are they

00:05:58.350 --> 00:06:00.740 
humped cilia chemtrails well are they
what's<00:05:58.620> in<00:05:58.830> them<00:05:58.980> no<00:05:59.610> idea<00:06:00.000> does<00:06:00.270> anybody<00:06:00.510> even
