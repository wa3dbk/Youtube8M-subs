 and the one who is a brown people a complaint 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:30.449

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:35.070
 havan lipsticks of this color trend line 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:38.070
 is that the packaging of it dirty tone of the know 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:42.329
 what they do is what they did in this 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:45.140
 The packaging that the button ends up 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:48.989
 without this transparent part 

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:54.719
 ends up smearing the complaint I see 

00:00:48.989 --> 00:01:00.379
 many girls doing it is not just me or 

00:00:54.719 --> 00:01:00.379
 the brown so pretty 

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:33.650
 Hey, how is it? It's not beautiful, now. 

00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:36.980
 I 'll wear this one here I violet 

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:42.350
 trend it is also moisturizing and also 

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:49.640
 have faith pps that uses as he is people 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:52.730
 packaging also contaminates all 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:57.580
 lipsticks of this line cuts the indy are 

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:57.580
 so the whole packaging 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:25.769
 He remembers that lilac lipstick if 

00:02:22.739 --> 00:02:30.739
 collection summer collection 

00:02:25.769 --> 00:02:34.730
 past the bright lilac 

00:02:30.739 --> 00:02:37.709
 but it's a tone like that a little bit more 

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:41.910
 I think it's more closed while you file 

00:02:37.709 --> 00:02:46.190
 while bright lilac is more open 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:46.190
 I'll show the bright side to you. 

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:59.250
 which is the difference between them seem 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:03:04.980
 more equal there is no difference that it is 

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:10.940
 It is clearer that it is more 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:10.940
 packing your grandmother have to see this to him 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:34.120
 So these are the lipsticks I have. 

00:03:30.310 --> 00:03:37.210
 but the button to go out to try is if 

00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:39.010
 You want snow, god, so I 

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:42.220
 experimenting button 

00:03:39.010 --> 00:03:44.590
 I decided to open this space here for this 

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:49.240

00:03:44.590 --> 00:03:51.400
