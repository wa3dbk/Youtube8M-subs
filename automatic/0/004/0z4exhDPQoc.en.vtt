only need to know five of them and here
they<00:00:20.010> are<00:00:20.039> it's<00:00:21.029> in<00:00:21.119> the<00:00:21.240> key<00:00:21.420> of<00:00:21.539> E<00:00:21.660> flat<00:00:21.689> and

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
they are it's in the key of E flat and

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.310 
they are it's in the key of E flat and
the<00:00:22.980> first<00:00:23.220> chord<00:00:23.640> is<00:00:23.820> going<00:00:24.300> to<00:00:24.539> be<00:00:24.660> a<00:00:24.689> C<00:00:25.050> minor

00:00:25.310 --> 00:00:25.320 
the first chord is going to be a C minor

00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:33.319 
the first chord is going to be a C minor
that's<00:00:25.830> made<00:00:26.160> up<00:00:26.310> of<00:00:26.460> C<00:00:26.849> E<00:00:27.230> flat<00:00:29.480> mg<00:00:32.270> for<00:00:33.270> the

00:00:33.319 --> 00:00:33.329 
that's made up of C E flat mg for the

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:34.880 
that's made up of C E flat mg for the
next<00:00:33.630> chord<00:00:33.930> you're<00:00:34.320> just<00:00:34.559> going<00:00:34.710> to<00:00:34.739> move

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:34.890 
next chord you're just going to move

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:38.900 
next chord you're just going to move
each<00:00:35.160> note<00:00:35.489> down<00:00:36.469> to<00:00:37.469> half<00:00:37.739> steps<00:00:38.100> or<00:00:38.430> a<00:00:38.640> whole

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
each note down to half steps or a whole

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:46.240

step<00:00:39.270> to<00:00:39.719> a<00:00:39.750> B<00:00:40.079> flat<00:00:40.379> chord<00:00:40.410> that's<00:00:41.160> B<00:00:41.610> flat<00:00:42.110> D<00:00:43.110> F

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:46.250 

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:48.709 

then<00:00:47.250> you're<00:00:47.399> going<00:00:47.579> to<00:00:47.640> play<00:00:47.850> an<00:00:48.120> E<00:00:48.510> flat

00:00:48.709 --> 00:00:48.719 
then you're going to play an E flat

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:51.350 
then you're going to play an E flat
chord<00:00:49.260> and<00:00:49.590> if<00:00:50.100> you<00:00:50.219> look<00:00:50.430> on<00:00:50.610> the<00:00:50.730> second<00:00:51.180> line

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360 
chord and if you look on the second line

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.060 
chord and if you look on the second line
there<00:00:51.690> you<00:00:51.840> will<00:00:51.960> see<00:00:52.260> this<00:00:52.590> is<00:00:52.770> a<00:00:52.800> quick

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:53.070 
there you will see this is a quick

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.459 
there you will see this is a quick
theory<00:00:53.460> lesson<00:00:53.850> that<00:00:54.360> the<00:00:54.480> e<00:00:54.510> flat<00:00:54.989> chord<00:00:55.320> is

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
theory lesson that the e flat chord is

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:59.840 
theory lesson that the e flat chord is
spelled<00:00:55.770> a<00:00:56.039> flat<00:00:56.520> G<00:00:56.820> and<00:00:57.539> B<00:00:57.570> flat<00:00:58.520> but<00:00:59.520> we're

00:00:59.840 --> 00:00:59.850 
spelled a flat G and B flat but we're

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.220 
spelled a flat G and B flat but we're
not<00:01:00.000> going<00:01:00.149> to<00:01:00.210> play<00:01:00.390> the<00:01:00.570> chord<00:01:00.840> in<00:01:01.050> root

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:01.230 
not going to play the chord in root

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:05.570 
not going to play the chord in root
position<00:01:01.699> that<00:01:02.699> would<00:01:02.879> sound<00:01:03.149> like<00:01:03.470> this<00:01:04.580> or

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:05.580 
position that would sound like this or

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:07.680 
position that would sound like this or
this

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:07.690 
this

00:01:07.690 --> 00:01:10.740 
this
this<00:01:08.320> court<00:01:08.710> is<00:01:08.950> in<00:01:09.280> the<00:01:09.670> second<00:01:10.360> inversion

00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:10.750 
this court is in the second inversion

00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:13.020 
this court is in the second inversion
the<00:01:11.140> first<00:01:11.380> inversion<00:01:11.740> would<00:01:12.280> be<00:01:12.430> with<00:01:12.610> the<00:01:12.760> G

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:13.030 
the first inversion would be with the G

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:15.750 
the first inversion would be with the G
on<00:01:13.210> the<00:01:13.330> bottom<00:01:13.690> this<00:01:14.200> inversion<00:01:15.010> has<00:01:15.400> to<00:01:15.610> be

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:15.760 
on the bottom this inversion has to be

00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:20.550 
on the bottom this inversion has to be
flat<00:01:16.350> so<00:01:17.350> it's<00:01:17.470> B<00:01:17.680> flat<00:01:17.980> E<00:01:18.220> flat<00:01:18.310> G<00:01:19.320> still<00:01:20.320> an<00:01:20.440> E

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:20.560 
flat so it's B flat E flat G still an E

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:22.200 
flat so it's B flat E flat G still an E
flat<00:01:20.770> chord<00:01:21.130> it's<00:01:21.400> just<00:01:21.610> going<00:01:21.730> to<00:01:21.790> be<00:01:21.910> played

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:22.210 
flat chord it's just going to be played

00:01:22.210 --> 00:01:25.110 
flat chord it's just going to be played
the<00:01:23.020> second<00:01:23.470> inversion<00:01:23.770> the<00:01:24.370> next<00:01:24.670> chord<00:01:24.940> that

00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:25.120 
the second inversion the next chord that

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:29.160 
the second inversion the next chord that
happens<00:01:25.540> is<00:01:25.750> the<00:01:25.900> a<00:01:25.930> flat<00:01:26.560> which<00:01:27.370> is<00:01:27.550> a<00:01:27.700> flat<00:01:28.270> C

00:01:29.160 --> 00:01:29.170 
happens is the a flat which is a flat C

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:33.930 
happens is the a flat which is a flat C
flat<00:01:30.120> and<00:01:31.470> then<00:01:32.470> the<00:01:32.560> last<00:01:32.800> chord<00:01:33.220> is<00:01:33.370> an<00:01:33.760> F

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:33.940 
flat and then the last chord is an F

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:36.600 
flat and then the last chord is an F
minor<00:01:34.300> chord<00:01:34.720> and<00:01:34.960> again<00:01:35.440> as<00:01:35.710> in<00:01:36.250> the<00:01:36.340> case<00:01:36.580> of

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:36.610 
minor chord and again as in the case of

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:38.460 
minor chord and again as in the case of
the<00:01:36.850> E<00:01:36.880> flat<00:01:37.000> chord<00:01:37.690> you<00:01:37.840> still<00:01:38.080> have<00:01:38.320> the

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:38.470 
the E flat chord you still have the

00:01:38.470 --> 00:01:41.280 
the E flat chord you still have the
notes<00:01:38.710> F<00:01:38.950> a<00:01:39.400> flat<00:01:40.030> and<00:01:40.300> C<00:01:40.570> but<00:01:40.810> they<00:01:40.960> are<00:01:41.080> in<00:01:41.170> the

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:41.290 
notes F a flat and C but they are in the

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:45.720 
notes F a flat and C but they are in the
second<00:01:41.830> inversion<00:01:42.660> with<00:01:43.660> C<00:01:44.080> on<00:01:44.350> the<00:01:44.620> bottom<00:01:44.980> so

00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:45.730 
second inversion with C on the bottom so

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:48.150 
second inversion with C on the bottom so
there<00:01:45.910> you<00:01:46.060> have<00:01:46.090> the<00:01:46.390> five<00:01:46.660> chords<00:01:47.260> for<00:01:47.830> just

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:48.160 
there you have the five chords for just

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:50.760 
there you have the five chords for just
can't<00:01:48.550> get<00:01:48.880> enough<00:01:49.110> now<00:01:50.110> let's<00:01:50.380> look<00:01:50.530> at<00:01:50.650> the

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:50.770 
can't get enough now let's look at the

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:55.830 
can't get enough now let's look at the
music<00:01:51.160> just<00:01:52.950> one<00:01:53.950> quick<00:01:54.250> note<00:01:54.280> we're<00:01:55.180> in<00:01:55.300> 4/4

00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:55.840 
music just one quick note we're in 4/4

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:58.380 
music just one quick note we're in 4/4
time<00:01:55.870> that<00:01:56.710> just<00:01:56.920> means<00:01:57.250> that<00:01:57.430> we've<00:01:58.120> grouped

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:58.390 
time that just means that we've grouped

00:01:58.390 --> 00:02:00.420 
time that just means that we've grouped
the<00:01:58.600> beats<00:01:58.840> in<00:01:59.050> groups<00:01:59.440> of<00:01:59.590> four<00:01:59.860> that<00:02:00.220> as<00:02:00.400> a

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:00.430 
the beats in groups of four that as a

00:02:00.430 --> 00:02:02.880 
the beats in groups of four that as a
measure<00:02:00.790> has<00:02:01.150> four<00:02:01.450> beats<00:02:01.720> in<00:02:01.900> it<00:02:02.050> the<00:02:02.500> quarter

00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:02.890 
measure has four beats in it the quarter

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:04.620 
measure has four beats in it the quarter
note<00:02:03.070> gets<00:02:03.250> one<00:02:03.460> beat<00:02:03.670> so<00:02:04.360> we're<00:02:04.479> going<00:02:04.570> to

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.630 
note gets one beat so we're going to

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:13.500 
note gets one beat so we're going to
play<00:02:04.870> one<00:02:05.110> chord<00:02:05.590> per<00:02:06.370> beat

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.510 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:39.210 

you

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.220 

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:41.680 

you<00:02:40.220> probably<00:02:40.430> noticed<00:02:41.030> that<00:02:41.090> I<00:02:41.210> didn't<00:02:41.570> play

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:41.690 
you probably noticed that I didn't play

00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:44.020 
you probably noticed that I didn't play
the<00:02:41.840> left<00:02:42.020> hand<00:02:42.320> and<00:02:43.160> if<00:02:43.280> you<00:02:43.370> listened<00:02:43.640> to<00:02:43.670> the

song<00:02:44.870> the<00:02:45.200> mp3<00:02:46.130> you<00:02:46.940> won't<00:02:47.150> hear<00:02:47.300> the<00:02:47.450> left

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:47.600 
song the mp3 you won't hear the left

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.350
