00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:01.550 

all<00:00:00.630> right<00:00:00.870> so<00:00:00.989> I<00:00:01.050> thought<00:00:01.199> I'd<00:00:01.290> just<00:00:01.380> do<00:00:01.530> a

00:00:01.550 --> 00:00:01.560 
all right so I thought I'd just do a

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:04.400 
all right so I thought I'd just do a
quick<00:00:01.829> update<00:00:02.120> I<00:00:03.120> haven't<00:00:03.720> gotten<00:00:04.080> too<00:00:04.380> far

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:04.410 
quick update I haven't gotten too far

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:06.230 
quick update I haven't gotten too far
yet<00:00:05.009> because<00:00:05.580> I've<00:00:05.670> been<00:00:05.790> really<00:00:05.940> busy<00:00:06.060> with

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:06.240 
yet because I've been really busy with

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.140 
yet because I've been really busy with
school<00:00:06.390> stuff<00:00:06.960> we<00:00:07.589> got<00:00:07.770> two<00:00:08.340> reports<00:00:08.760> due<00:00:09.000> this

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:09.150 
school stuff we got two reports due this

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.990 
school stuff we got two reports due this
week<00:00:09.389> in<00:00:09.570> a<00:00:09.660> lab<00:00:09.870> and<00:00:10.260> I've<00:00:11.040> had<00:00:11.190> a<00:00:11.219> couple<00:00:11.940> of

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:12.000 
week in a lab and I've had a couple of

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.419 
week in a lab and I've had a couple of
close<00:00:12.179> you<00:00:12.360> tests<00:00:13.259> of<00:00:13.349> the<00:00:13.559> week<00:00:13.679> before<00:00:13.889> so

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
close you tests of the week before so

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:17.900 
close you tests of the week before so
I've<00:00:15.120> been<00:00:15.240> pretty<00:00:15.480> tied<00:00:15.750> up<00:00:15.929> but<00:00:16.460> yeah<00:00:17.460> so<00:00:17.699> far

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:17.910 
I've been pretty tied up but yeah so far

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:23.390 
I've been pretty tied up but yeah so far
I've<00:00:18.029> determined<00:00:18.300> that<00:00:18.630> either<00:00:22.160> 24/7<00:00:23.160> DM

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
I've determined that either 24/7 DM

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.050 
I've determined that either 24/7 DM
power<00:00:23.640> cow<00:00:23.970> cells<00:00:24.390> will<00:00:24.570> fit<00:00:24.750> maybe<00:00:25.050> even<00:00:25.350> 25

00:00:26.050 --> 00:00:26.060 
power cow cells will fit maybe even 25

00:00:26.060 --> 00:00:32.089 
power cow cells will fit maybe even 25
would<00:00:27.060> be<00:00:27.119> nice<00:00:27.420> in<00:00:27.689> series<00:00:28.050> and<00:00:29.060> or<00:00:30.529> the<00:00:31.529> 100

00:00:32.089 --> 00:00:32.099 
would be nice in series and or the 100

00:00:32.099 --> 00:00:34.610 
would be nice in series and or the 100
amp<00:00:32.250> hour<00:00:32.489> GBS<00:00:33.000> cells<00:00:33.300> will<00:00:33.480> fit<00:00:33.690> but<00:00:33.870> only<00:00:34.170> 22

00:00:34.610 --> 00:00:34.620 
amp hour GBS cells will fit but only 22

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:38.389 
amp hour GBS cells will fit but only 22
will<00:00:34.950> fit<00:00:36.050> in<00:00:37.050> order<00:00:37.290> to<00:00:37.410> fit<00:00:37.559> 24<00:00:38.070> and<00:00:38.219> pretty

00:00:38.389 --> 00:00:38.399 
will fit in order to fit 24 and pretty

00:00:38.399 --> 00:00:41.119 
will fit in order to fit 24 and pretty
much<00:00:38.520> be<00:00:38.730> a<00:00:38.760> miracle<00:00:39.030> so<00:00:39.540> I<00:00:39.780> think<00:00:40.050> 22<00:00:40.649> is

00:00:41.119 --> 00:00:41.129 
much be a miracle so I think 22 is

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:43.190 
much be a miracle so I think 22 is
paranal<00:00:41.670> that'll<00:00:41.910> fit<00:00:42.059> in<00:00:42.180> that<00:00:42.300> one<00:00:42.480> but<00:00:43.079> with

00:00:43.190 --> 00:00:43.200 
paranal that'll fit in that one but with

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.410 
paranal that'll fit in that one but with
the<00:00:43.290> cattle<00:00:43.620> cells<00:00:43.770> I<00:00:43.920> think<00:00:44.129> 24<00:00:45.120> could<00:00:45.270> fit

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:45.420 
the cattle cells I think 24 could fit

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:47.540 
the cattle cells I think 24 could fit
pretty<00:00:45.539> easily<00:00:45.780> so<00:00:46.140> yeah<00:00:47.010> I've<00:00:47.129> been

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:47.550 
pretty easily so yeah I've been

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.910 
pretty easily so yeah I've been
contacting<00:00:48.149> a<00:00:48.210> few<00:00:48.390> manufacturers<00:00:49.020> but<00:00:49.680> about

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:49.920 
contacting a few manufacturers but about

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:52.250 
contacting a few manufacturers but about
the<00:00:50.100> cells<00:00:50.309> and<00:00:50.600> no<00:00:51.600> one's<00:00:51.750> got<00:00:51.899> back<00:00:52.079> to<00:00:52.199> me

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:52.260 
the cells and no one's got back to me

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:54.799 
the cells and no one's got back to me
yet<00:00:52.469> so<00:00:52.879> but<00:00:53.879> yeah<00:00:54.120> hasn't<00:00:54.420> even<00:00:54.510> been<00:00:54.660> a<00:00:54.719> day

00:00:54.799 --> 00:00:54.809 
yet so but yeah hasn't even been a day

00:00:54.809 --> 00:00:57.729 
yet so but yeah hasn't even been a day
so<00:00:55.020> I've<00:00:55.620> contacted<00:00:55.980> three<00:00:56.460> distributors<00:00:57.210> so

00:00:57.729 --> 00:00:57.739 
so I've contacted three distributors so

00:00:57.739 --> 00:01:00.319 
so I've contacted three distributors so
hopefully<00:00:58.739> uh<00:00:58.770> I'll<00:00:59.309> hear<00:00:59.520> back<00:00:59.699> from<00:00:59.730> someone

00:01:00.319 --> 00:01:00.329 
hopefully uh I'll hear back from someone

00:01:00.329 --> 00:01:03.560 
hopefully uh I'll hear back from someone
and<00:01:00.629> I'll<00:01:01.260> make<00:01:01.440> a<00:01:01.469> choice<00:01:01.770> right<00:01:02.699> now<00:01:03.270> I'm

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:03.570 
and I'll make a choice right now I'm

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.289 
and I'll make a choice right now I'm
hoping<00:01:03.899> for<00:01:04.290> the<00:01:04.439> the<00:01:05.430> cow<00:01:05.610> cells<00:01:06.000> actually

00:01:06.289 --> 00:01:06.299 
hoping for the the cow cells actually

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:10.190 
hoping for the the cow cells actually
because<00:01:07.490> the<00:01:08.490> the<00:01:09.150> voltage<00:01:09.330> will<00:01:09.810> be<00:01:09.990> higher

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:10.200 
because the the voltage will be higher

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.130 
because the the voltage will be higher
so<00:01:11.189> I<00:01:11.250> can<00:01:11.280> get<00:01:11.549> so<00:01:12.510> the<00:01:12.600> motor<00:01:12.780> will<00:01:12.840> spin<00:01:13.020> a

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:13.140 
so I can get so the motor will spin a

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.679 
so I can get so the motor will spin a
little<00:01:13.229> faster<00:01:13.770> that'll<00:01:13.979> be<00:01:14.040> nice<00:01:14.250> but<00:01:15.210> the

00:01:15.679 --> 00:01:15.689 
little faster that'll be nice but the

00:01:15.689 --> 00:01:18.440 
little faster that'll be nice but the
GBS<00:01:16.049> cells<00:01:16.320> would<00:01:16.560> hold<00:01:16.799> more<00:01:17.430> energy<00:01:17.820> this

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
GBS cells would hold more energy this

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.020 
GBS cells would hold more energy this
would<00:01:18.689> be<00:01:18.890> both<00:01:19.890> seven<00:01:20.340> killing<00:01:20.610> hours<00:01:20.850> and

00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:21.030 
would be both seven killing hours and

00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:23.810 
would be both seven killing hours and
this<00:01:21.119> would<00:01:21.270> be<00:01:21.920> five<00:01:22.920> point<00:01:23.220> six<00:01:23.490> kilowatt

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
this would be five point six kilowatt

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.730 
this would be five point six kilowatt
hours<00:01:24.150> so<00:01:24.900> a<00:01:24.960> good<00:01:25.110> thing<00:01:25.259> is<00:01:25.380> that<00:01:25.530> I<00:01:25.560> can

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:25.740 
hours so a good thing is that I can

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:28.969 
hours so a good thing is that I can
actually<00:01:25.830> fit<00:01:26.100> in<00:01:26.220> more<00:01:27.740> energy<00:01:28.740> than<00:01:28.860> I

00:01:28.969 --> 00:01:28.979 
actually fit in more energy than I

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:30.080 
actually fit in more energy than I
thought<00:01:29.130> I<00:01:29.189> could<00:01:29.280> originally<00:01:29.880> I<00:01:29.909> was

00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:30.090 
thought I could originally I was

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:31.249 
thought I could originally I was
thinking<00:01:30.390> I'd<00:01:30.509> only<00:01:30.659> be<00:01:30.810> able<00:01:30.869> to<00:01:30.960> fit<00:01:31.140> in

00:01:31.249 --> 00:01:31.259 
thinking I'd only be able to fit in

00:01:31.259 --> 00:01:34.130 
thinking I'd only be able to fit in
about<00:01:31.820> four<00:01:32.820> point<00:01:33.030> six<00:01:33.210> kilowatt<00:01:33.540> hours<00:01:33.869> so

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.140 
about four point six kilowatt hours so

00:01:34.140 --> 00:01:37.010 
about four point six kilowatt hours so
the<00:01:34.770> fact<00:01:34.950> that<00:01:35.009> I<00:01:35.100> can<00:01:35.250> fit<00:01:35.689> more<00:01:36.689> than<00:01:36.840> five

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
the fact that I can fit more than five

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.130 
the fact that I can fit more than five
killers<00:01:37.439> in<00:01:37.740> is<00:01:37.860> really<00:01:38.340> good<00:01:38.549> so<00:01:38.960> yeah<00:01:39.960> well

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:40.140 
killers in is really good so yeah well

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:43.550 
killers in is really good so yeah well
I'll<00:01:40.500> update<00:01:40.829> you<00:01:41.070> guys<00:01:41.509> when<00:01:42.509> more<00:01:43.350> stuff

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:43.560 
I'll update you guys when more stuff

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:46.340 
I'll update you guys when more stuff
gets<00:01:43.770> done<00:01:43.860> I'm<00:01:44.220> still<00:01:44.610> I<00:01:45.450> haven't<00:01:46.020> really<00:01:46.170> got

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
gets done I'm still I haven't really got

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:47.810 
gets done I'm still I haven't really got
much<00:01:46.380> further<00:01:46.799> than<00:01:46.950> the<00:01:47.070> be<00:01:47.189> messy<00:01:47.399> X<00:01:47.640> I've

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
much further than the be messy X I've

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:50.690 
much further than the be messy X I've
been<00:01:47.939> so<00:01:48.210> busy<00:01:48.360> so<00:01:48.689> tied<00:01:48.899> up<00:01:49.110> so<00:01:49.460> but<00:01:50.460> I'll<00:01:50.579> get

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:50.700 
been so busy so tied up so but I'll get

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:53.690 
been so busy so tied up so but I'll get
around<00:01:50.880> to<00:01:51.030> it<00:01:51.180> and<00:01:52.130> you'll<00:01:53.130> get<00:01:53.280> finished<00:01:53.490> up

00:01:53.690 --> 00:01:53.700 
around to it and you'll get finished up

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:55.580 
around to it and you'll get finished up
I'm<00:01:53.970> sure<00:01:54.149> once<00:01:54.659> those<00:01:54.840> batteries<00:01:55.200> get<00:01:55.320> in<00:01:55.439> you

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
I'm sure once those batteries get in you

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.550 
I'm sure once those batteries get in you
will<00:01:55.740> everything<00:01:57.140> project<00:01:58.140> will<00:01:58.229> move<00:01:58.320> really

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560
