00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.850
 we are in minecraft 1.8 

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:09.090
 let's see a mod 

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:11.580
 this weekend has touched another 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:16.350
 gardening weekend that is a 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:18.960
 area of â€‹â€‹a just template really 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:21.390
 but before I get to tell you it's already 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.369
 open the third channel the third channel 

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:27.020
 where today he has already begun to climb 3 

00:00:23.369 --> 00:00:29.690
 mandy cut what you have in the description 

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:30.980
 in case you want to throw them out there 

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:33.440
 back and every time it's pretty 

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:36.200
 cool but the question is that now 

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:38.930
 we have to be here seeds of 

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:40.400
 experience that is how would be surrounded by 

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:44.829
 gold 

00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:46.600
 and we can plant where we plant it 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:48.850
 try for nothing 

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:52.739
 just over here I'm going to do it big 

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:52.739
 stop let's plant here 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:58.989
 and the seed is of experience 

00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:02.089
 you will imagine what it does and what it gives us 

00:00:58.989 --> 00:01:03.559
 it gives us experience simply os 

00:01:02.089 --> 00:01:04.909
 experience recipes is chiquis 

00:01:03.559 --> 00:01:08.350
 taxis the issue is that we can 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:08.350
 make us another pretty big song 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:15.560
 let's do it over here 

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:15.560
 today is the real weekend 

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:27.200
 here in fact yesterday morning at dawn today 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:29.240
 in the early morning I have also raised a 

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:31.759
 blog in that third channel explaining how 

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:33.560
 country and such I'm excited enough illusion 

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:36.760
 mine over here is starting to grow the 

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:40.030
 let's use the boni milk directly 

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:44.950
 so the plant is not grown so it is 

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:48.640
 grown up this is pretty cool if you 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:50.710
 we break in fact I'm going to get like this if 

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:53.160
 we break it this time it has given us two 

00:01:50.710 --> 00:01:53.160
 seeds 

00:01:53.659 --> 00:01:59.119
 this has not given us any that is the 

00:01:56.090 --> 00:02:00.890
 subject then what the author says in the 

00:01:59.119 --> 00:02:05.140
 link is that you have to have some 

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:05.140
 tool with fortune 3 

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:11.690
 with fortune 3 fortune fortune fortune 

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:11.690
 for what I'm testing 

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:19.530
 it will become more a single 

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:20.310
 I do not see shooting in the author says that 

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.660
 that we have to have a tool 

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:24.390
 with luck to give us more 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:27.000
 seeds supposed because there are times that 

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:29.520
 they give us directly but as there are other 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.460
 that of normal yes that they have given us 

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:34.800
 you are watching only 3 

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:36.690
 it's worth family being bars of gold 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:38.430
 I guess and another little thing is that to not 

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:39.970
 break the plant we can use the 

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:42.010
 scissors 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:44.140
 then they will say that I have water 

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:46.440
 like the one of the sheep that we click 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:46.440
 straight 

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:51.610
 we remove the orbs 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:55.080
 for this if you have a plantation 

00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:56.610
 great this is great just 

00:02:55.080 --> 00:03:00.890
 look at how much experience like that in a 

00:02:56.610 --> 00:03:00.890
 I ratico a ratico in a moment 

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:10.530
 at the interest level of superchulo party 

00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:10.530
 check it out 

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:17.849
 they are not stepping on it or they are breaking 

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:21.750
 bad little interruptions but like 

00:03:17.849 --> 00:03:24.450
 you see the author says that the 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:27.450
 the villagers break the sixth and yes that is 

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:32.520
 truth at first it seems that to some 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:35.460
 they do not like the upper floor 

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:37.230
 the mirage and brutes 

00:03:35.460 --> 00:03:39.270
 on top of that is that they do not step on it 

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:41.540
 they break directly because they do not like the 

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:41.540
 plant 

00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:45.640
 A) Yes 

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:59.180
 but the villagers hate him to death 

00:03:56.580 --> 00:03:59.180
 good 

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:06.150
 that they do not like I do not like that plant 

00:04:01.530 --> 00:04:09.500
 but the description is for 1.8 yes 

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:09.500
 I was happy etc as always 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:14.540
 bye
