00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:07.069
 hi little people, how are you there? 

00:00:03.230 --> 00:00:09.350
 to see I will comment on this video is 

00:00:07.069 --> 00:00:10.780
 practically improvised I did not have it 

00:00:09.350 --> 00:00:14.410
 thought-out 

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:17.250
 something rather curious has happened to me and 

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:19.599
 I want to share it with you you will see 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:21.130
 I'm going to risk saying that the book 

00:00:19.599 --> 00:00:23.919
 I discovered it in quotes 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:26.410
 because I have not seen good I have 

00:00:23.919 --> 00:00:30.070
 discovered I just want to say why not 

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:32.439
 I've seen no video of anyone teaching 

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:33.850
 this has happened to me by chance and what 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:36.460
 I'm going to record precisely for 

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:39.460
 share it you will see how you see I have 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:42.250
 put the dragon armor not 

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:44.249
 well I bought the house of loneliness 

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:47.949
 the three-story mansion there 

00:00:44.249 --> 00:00:50.530
 free with the ship you know everything I speak 

00:00:47.949 --> 00:00:53.019
 very quick to put money in a chest for 

00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:55.870
 I did not take it off etc etc it came out 

00:00:53.019 --> 00:00:58.239
 practically free furnished whole and 

00:00:55.870 --> 00:01:00.190
 in the lower part of the house we have two 

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:03.609
 mannequins to put our armors 

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:06.490
 Well, as you can see there is another 

00:01:03.609 --> 00:01:09.520
 dragon I only had one that is the one that 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:11.420
 I have put you commented I was wearing 

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:13.850
 a steel armor 

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:18.229
 normal nordic armor so to speak 

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:20.780
 as improved to 900 defense I think that 

00:01:18.229 --> 00:01:23.780
 I put it and you remember if you go over 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:25.670
 the 600 and all the armors for in 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.649
 the same damage then took that then 

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:29.460
 to appear more than little great purpose 

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:32.520
 paranoia mine 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:34.290
 what is going on as he was wearing 

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:36.810
 that I left in these two dummies the 

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.940
 of briqa and those of dragon to decorate the 

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.700
 because they are the most beautiful and 

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:43.800
 visually or the best then what 

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:46.930
 is what happens it has given me the things of 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:50.680
 improve a bit more the dragon 

00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:53.800
 and by removing me from doing or leaving it in 

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:56.250
 a chest and take from the mannequin the 

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:58.780
 dragon to wear it and improve it 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:01.330
 It turns out that when I return to the house I 

00:01:58.780 --> 00:02:03.130
 I find that there is another replica 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:06.340
 of the dragon armor what is the 

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:08.720
 difference that mine as you can see 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:12.920
 here the legend is improved 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:16.520
 is worth and also the defense index and 

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:17.780
 sorry as the camera too this 

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:21.520
 2050 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:21.520
 since 2000 65 

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:27.940
 Well, the difference is that the 

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.470
 replication is normal, the 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:32.440
 legend 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:35.800
 and it also does not weigh or is a replica 

00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:37.420
 that does not weigh it I do not know how it is 

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:42.270
 seeing this I'm going to put it like that so 

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:44.950
 it looks better I'm wearing 384 now 

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:47.460
 460 pesos, then you will see that 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:47.460
 does not increase 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:56.830
 once seen good increases there is a 

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:59.500
 misery from 84 to 99 is pretty absurd 

00:02:56.830 --> 00:03:04.040
 as you see I can keep running normal 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:06.000
 so what I'm going to do is get out of 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:08.580
 here 

00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:11.210
 and re-enter the house when 

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:14.220
 I go back into the house there will be 

00:03:11.210 --> 00:03:17.310
 recharged another dragon armor and so on 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:20.610
 we can be indefinitely what is the 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:23.790
 obvious advantage that this has then that 

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:26.510
 you can make the armor that you want 

00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:28.760
 the number of times you want 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:30.650
 I do not know what may happen to you 

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:33.439
 you are wrong when it comes to charming 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:35.209
 armor and now you want to make another 

00:03:33.439 --> 00:03:37.819
 new in conditions with the 

00:03:35.209 --> 00:03:39.920
 adequate enchantment or whatever and 

00:03:37.819 --> 00:03:41.840
 you have to take many materials to 

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:44.780
 return to manufacture lara because it does not 

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:47.510
 lack you come here to the house of solitude 

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:50.030
 I do not know I do not know if all the 

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:51.409
 houses that have mannequin this is the 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:54.109
 only new so I bought myself 

00:03:51.409 --> 00:03:55.700
 after the white race so 

00:03:54.109 --> 00:03:56.720
 I speak in view of this which is what 

00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:00.710
 I have 

00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:04.520
 that is basically you come here 

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:07.640
 would gain the armor on the mannequin's 

00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:11.060
 You take her out of the house and 

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:13.280
 converted and will be recharged is already 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:15.440
 now you can throw the one that has been worth 

00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:17.600
 for the enchantment to sell it and put you 

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:19.850
 the other the improvement is that it is the only 

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:21.950
 you are going to have to do or go to 

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:23.480
 have to spend ebony ingots or 

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:26.150
 those of dragon what he asks of each 

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:28.130
 armor to improve it and that 's it 

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:30.950
 quite cheaper that you have to 

00:04:28.130 --> 00:04:32.400
 be making of the armor itself 

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:34.470
 again 

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:36.430
 so now you are going to check it in a 

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:38.660
 I go back down 

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:45.190
 from rl 3 

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:45.190
 so so we have these as you see 

00:04:45.289 --> 00:04:50.599
 arrived or here you will have the gloves of 

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:53.149
 legend that the one that I have equipped and this 

00:04:50.599 --> 00:04:55.880
 of replication that would be the normal fixed the 

00:04:53.149 --> 00:04:58.460
 difference of improvement like this 

00:04:55.880 --> 00:05:00.860
 and also because of the fact that it does not weigh 

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:04.700
 well do not weigh in quotes you see 

00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:08.780
 wear now 399 

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:10.610
 now increased to 414 only that is 

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:12.490
 that very little and so you can continue 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:17.300
 indefinitely 

00:05:12.490 --> 00:05:18.950
 go steps in order that this was what you 

00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:21.700
 I wanted to teach what he has discovered this way 

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:25.900
 accident and I found it quite useful 

00:05:21.700 --> 00:05:29.080
 I'm in the 1.5 update 

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:31.810
 that is technically up to the last 

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:33.300
 this is still a book 

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:36.520
 better for the next one they fix it 

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:39.729
 exploited now that you can see anything 

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:42.090
 plus a saludito and soon I hope 

00:05:39.729 --> 00:05:42.090
 what you liked
