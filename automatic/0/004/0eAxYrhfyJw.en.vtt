00:01:26.470 --> 00:01:26.480 
technology it saves that right to the

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:29.140 
technology it saves that right to the
SSD<00:01:27.470> so<00:01:27.890> would<00:01:28.280> we<00:01:28.370> have<00:01:28.490> in<00:01:28.580> terms<00:01:28.700> of<00:01:28.850> sensors

00:01:29.140 --> 00:01:29.150 
SSD so would we have in terms of sensors

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:30.910 
SSD so would we have in terms of sensors
up<00:01:29.270> top<00:01:29.480> to<00:01:29.660> make<00:01:29.960> that<00:01:30.110> happen<00:01:30.230> it's<00:01:30.590> just<00:01:30.650> a

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:30.920 
up top to make that happen it's just a

00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:32.320 
up top to make that happen it's just a
couple<00:01:31.160> of<00:01:31.310> cameras<00:01:31.610> pointing<00:01:31.940> down<00:01:32.090> that's

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:32.330 
couple of cameras pointing down that's

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:33.550 
couple of cameras pointing down that's
right<00:01:32.540> we've<00:01:32.660> got<00:01:32.780> cameras<00:01:33.110> pointing<00:01:33.440> down

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:33.560 
right we've got cameras pointing down

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:34.960 
right we've got cameras pointing down
that<00:01:33.800> are<00:01:33.890> calibrated<00:01:34.400> specifically<00:01:34.820> to

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:34.970 
that are calibrated specifically to

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:36.100 
that are calibrated specifically to
catch<00:01:35.120> what<00:01:35.330> we've<00:01:35.450> got<00:01:35.600> going<00:01:35.720> on<00:01:35.930> in<00:01:36.050> these

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:36.110 
catch what we've got going on in these

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:37.540 
catch what we've got going on in these
two<00:01:36.200> separate<00:01:36.530> pages<00:01:36.740> and<00:01:37.100> then<00:01:37.430> ultimately

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:37.550 
two separate pages and then ultimately

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:39.070 
two separate pages and then ultimately
you<00:01:37.910> get<00:01:38.000> those<00:01:38.180> together<00:01:38.330> with<00:01:38.720> the<00:01:38.780> monitor

00:01:39.070 --> 00:01:39.080 
you get those together with the monitor

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:41.110 
you get those together with the monitor
all<00:01:39.440> right<00:01:39.530> what's<00:01:39.980> the<00:01:40.130> the<00:01:40.490> general<00:01:40.850> size<00:01:41.090> I

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:41.120 
all right what's the the general size I

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:42.640 
all right what's the the general size I
mean<00:01:41.360> we<00:01:41.420> can<00:01:41.540> see<00:01:41.750> in<00:01:41.960> general<00:01:42.140> it's<00:01:42.380> it's<00:01:42.590> a

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:42.650 
mean we can see in general it's it's a

00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:44.200 
mean we can see in general it's it's a
fairly<00:01:42.890> large<00:01:43.130> book<00:01:43.430> but<00:01:43.580> what's<00:01:43.910> the<00:01:43.970> maximum

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:44.210 
fairly large book but what's the maximum

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:45.970 
fairly large book but what's the maximum
size<00:01:44.480> evoke<00:01:44.780> you<00:01:44.900> can<00:01:45.080> do<00:01:45.410> here<00:01:45.590> you<00:01:45.860> know

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:45.980 
size evoke you can do here you know

00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:47.260 
size evoke you can do here you know
that's<00:01:46.190> a<00:01:46.280> great<00:01:46.460> question<00:01:46.550> I<00:01:47.000> don't<00:01:47.150> actually

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:47.270 
that's a great question I don't actually

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:48.790 
that's a great question I don't actually
know<00:01:47.450> the<00:01:47.480> maximum<00:01:47.930> size<00:01:48.080> off<00:01:48.260> the<00:01:48.380> top<00:01:48.530> of<00:01:48.560> my

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:48.800 
know the maximum size off the top of my

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:50.200 
know the maximum size off the top of my
head<00:01:49.040> but<00:01:49.159> we've<00:01:49.310> got<00:01:49.430> very<00:01:49.610> large<00:01:49.820> tabletop

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:50.210 
head but we've got very large tabletop

00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:51.610 
head but we've got very large tabletop
books<00:01:50.510> and<00:01:50.720> that<00:01:50.840> will<00:01:51.020> actually<00:01:51.290> work<00:01:51.409> as

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:51.620 
books and that will actually work as

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:53.740 
books and that will actually work as
well<00:01:51.800> about<00:01:52.490> this<00:01:52.820> big<00:01:53.090> good<00:01:53.270> looks<00:01:53.450> like<00:01:53.510> that

00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:53.750 
well about this big good looks like that

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:55.210 
well about this big good looks like that
so<00:01:53.870> that<00:01:53.990> will<00:01:54.140> work<00:01:54.170> absolutely<00:01:54.440> fine<00:01:54.830> and

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:55.220 
so that will work absolutely fine and

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:58.630 
so that will work absolutely fine and
this<00:01:55.700> is<00:01:55.820> a<00:01:55.850> good<00:01:56.060> one<00:01:56.180> too<00:01:56.360> of<00:01:56.830> course<00:01:57.830> the

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640 
this is a good one too of course the

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.899 
this is a good one too of course the
issue<00:01:58.760> of<00:01:59.180> of<00:01:59.990> coffee<00:02:00.710> right<00:02:00.980> you<00:02:01.190> probably

00:02:01.899 --> 00:02:01.909 
issue of of coffee right you probably

00:02:01.909 --> 00:02:03.310 
issue of of coffee right you probably
don't<00:02:02.120> want<00:02:02.270> to<00:02:02.330> be<00:02:02.390> doing<00:02:02.960> this<00:02:03.080> and<00:02:03.200> then

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:03.320 
don't want to be doing this and then

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:04.930 
don't want to be doing this and then
sending<00:02:03.590> it<00:02:03.650> all<00:02:03.770> up<00:02:03.890> in<00:02:04.010> an<00:02:04.100> attic<00:02:04.400> or<00:02:04.670> no<00:02:04.850> of

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:04.940 
sending it all up in an attic or no of

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:06.190 
sending it all up in an attic or no of
course<00:02:05.180> not<00:02:05.360> this<00:02:05.510> is<00:02:05.690> all<00:02:05.780> about<00:02:05.930> your

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:07.700 
library that you've already grown so I'm

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:08.830 
library that you've already grown so I'm
right<00:02:07.909> you've<00:02:08.119> already<00:02:08.269> purchased<00:02:08.509> your

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:10.550 
books it's basically fair use you've

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:12.070 
books it's basically fair use you've
already<00:02:10.700> you<00:02:11.090> own<00:02:11.239> the<00:02:11.390> technology<00:02:11.510> so<00:02:11.989> you

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:12.080 
already you own the technology so you

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:13.110 
already you own the technology so you
just<00:02:12.230> basically<00:02:12.349> moving<00:02:12.709> into

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.120 
just basically moving into

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:14.790 
just basically moving into
yeah<00:02:13.360> everybody<00:02:13.989> has<00:02:14.050> a<00:02:14.170> bunch<00:02:14.410> of<00:02:14.530> books<00:02:14.650> that

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 
yeah everybody has a bunch of books that

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.559 
yeah everybody has a bunch of books that
are<00:02:14.890> out<00:02:14.980> of<00:02:15.069> print<00:02:15.310> or<00:02:15.550> whatever<00:02:15.819> and<00:02:16.120> you<00:02:16.330> may

00:02:16.559 --> 00:02:16.569 
are out of print or whatever and you may

00:02:16.569 --> 00:02:17.820 
are out of print or whatever and you may
want<00:02:16.750> to<00:02:16.810> read<00:02:16.989> them<00:02:17.110> without<00:02:17.200> carting<00:02:17.739> them

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:17.830 
want to read them without carting them

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:19.320 
want to read them without carting them
around<00:02:17.980> and<00:02:18.160> potentially<00:02:18.580> damaging<00:02:18.970> they're

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:19.330 
around and potentially damaging they're

00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:20.940 
around and potentially damaging they're
rare<00:02:19.510> so<00:02:19.870> that's<00:02:20.200> exactly<00:02:20.560> right

00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:20.950 
rare so that's exactly right

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:22.350 
rare so that's exactly right
all<00:02:21.099> right<00:02:21.220> so<00:02:21.430> how<00:02:21.730> much<00:02:21.790> is<00:02:22.030> this<00:02:22.150> and

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:22.360 
all right so how much is this and

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:23.970

00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:23.980 
whenever we can be able to get this this

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:25.290 
whenever we can be able to get this this
will<00:02:24.160> be<00:02:24.250> out<00:02:24.370> a<00:02:24.400> little<00:02:24.550> bit<00:02:24.760> later<00:02:24.910> this<00:02:25.060> year
