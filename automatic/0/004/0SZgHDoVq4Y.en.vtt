00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:05.819
 20 and today we are back with another 

00:00:03.659 --> 00:00:07.470
 tutorial good morning is not a tutorial 

00:00:05.819 --> 00:00:12.120
 it's like a mod 

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:13.500
 it's a personalized content with and I think 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.139
 that in the first each a video 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.960
 personalized content so we're going to 

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:21.420
 start the installation goes after 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.090
 than what those who do not know how 

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.340
 install custom content 

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.470
 you can see that the notification that the 

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.609
 wave 

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:34.399
 always returned annotation can go with what 

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:37.340
 let's see what this does 

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:44.300
 personalized content that what it does 

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:47.770
 is to have 1,017 created color shades of 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:51.520
 skin is 

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:54.580
 a lot or are they are millions and color and 

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:57.850
 skin there are a lot there are some that already 

00:00:54.580 --> 00:01:01.269
 they are like means that 

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:04.030
 we would not like it but there are others who like 

00:01:01.269 --> 00:01:06.790
 they are not in the game something more realistic 

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:11.770
 not that the game is not there 

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:14.110
 we can use and they look good so let's go 

00:01:11.770 --> 00:01:16.980
 to start this with cassidy and with the link 

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:19.280
 we are in home 

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:23.250
 these are the instructions now as 

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:26.580
 for how to use it what you have to do 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:29.730
 it's good they're going to select the sim what 

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:32.880
 they have here they select it and they select 

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:35.550
 face and go to face 

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:37.710
 faces and skin tones 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:40.680
 it does not matter that they have selected 

00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:43.290
 any skin return go to details 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.240
 skin and now yes they have the mode 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:48.360
 well installed they have to appear here 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:50.100
 this bar that you can click here 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:52.950
 that we have all these colors well what 

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:55.890
 use but here there are not 1017 no but 

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:58.770
 if for example I put this yellow not 

00:01:55.890 --> 00:02:00.960
 This is very good and a lot of good all 

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:04.140
 this skin color 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:06.270
 I put this yellow and I come back to face and 

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:07.540
 skin tones because we are in details 

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:10.720
 of skin 

00:02:07.540 --> 00:02:12.340
 and post Any choice ar 

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:15.910
 of these this is changing different 

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:18.130
 tones so the truth are always 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:21.280
 very much the work they did 

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:23.230
 with this because doing all this for 

00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:26.420
 every so to see what does not take up much 

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:28.590
 space the mode then it 's very good 

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:30.690
 the personalized content 

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:34.860
 we have a lot of everyone we were leaving 

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:37.920
 for example let's go to a celestial we can 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:40.019
 choose any skin tone here and 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:43.019
 always the blues and the greens go to 

00:02:40.019 --> 00:02:45.480
 change a little more than us by 

00:02:43.019 --> 00:02:49.080
 example this common green like a blue 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:53.480
 more water what you do not have to see is not 

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:53.480
 compatible like that because we put it 

00:02:53.750 --> 00:03:00.810
 it was a problem with before 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:03.690
 I kept putting these the 

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:06.330
 the moles did not let me put I do not know 

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:08.630
 why it was not but it seems that now 

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:12.090
 it works so great 

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:16.129
 let's see if we choose 

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:16.129
 everything is perfect 

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:24.390
 walks also with makeup can use 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:26.819
 of all are very good 

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:28.150
 so well I think that would be all 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:30.819
 for today 

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:33.819
 I hope you liked this 

00:03:30.819 --> 00:03:37.030
 personalized content and good if it is 

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:39.189
 that they liked leaves with huge like and not 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:41.860
 I know why I'm saying this let's go 

00:03:39.189 --> 00:03:43.480
 the good installation this is the 

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:46.780
 installation what they have to do 

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:48.640
 first of all it is to enter the page that 

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:50.200
 happens to the description that is this is 

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:52.329
 always experience 

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:56.049
 some should already know it because they are 

00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:58.810
 very good has content bases 

00:03:56.049 --> 00:04:00.310
 custom and good content as 

00:03:58.810 --> 00:04:02.920
 is these would be all the colors this 

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:04.780
 I love everything 

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:08.890
 practically 

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:14.050
 it almost says 1710 skin colors what 

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:17.650
 says every tone because there are 17 I do not know is 

00:04:14.050 --> 00:04:19.989
 very complicated here is everything 

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:22.810
 tells you how to use the two I already 

00:04:19.989 --> 00:04:25.150
 I explained and he said something about the 

00:04:22.810 --> 00:04:26.500
 genetic but I did not understand very well how 

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:29.160
 who are working on that in the 

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:29.160
 gene for 

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:35.680
 so that the children when they are born are born 

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:38.320
 with the same skin color and all that 

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:40.360
 then it also works for boy not 

00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:41.449
 forget to tell them it works for all 

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:43.580
 ages 

00:04:41.449 --> 00:04:47.509
 so good they have to go down here 

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:51.830
 where they see these orange things and they come 

00:04:47.509 --> 00:04:56.949
 to this 15 95 -jorge there is 995 this 

00:04:51.830 --> 00:05:00.409

00:05:00.409 --> 00:05:06.350
 press on the simplifies 

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:09.680
 the link is mediafire 2 mb / s not 

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:11.310
 weighs nothing and you lower them in two seconds 

00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:13.700
 already 

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:18.730
 just out of the blue 

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:23.420
 when they already have they are going to come to downloads 

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:26.810
 and already have it here we are going to take it here 

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:29.900

00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:33.050
 electronic arts go to the sims four and 

00:05:29.900 --> 00:05:36.020
