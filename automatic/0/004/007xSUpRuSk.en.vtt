00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:13.170 
game i do you think we performed I think

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.200 
game i do you think we performed I think
we<00:00:13.259> perform<00:00:13.620> the<00:00:13.710> right<00:00:13.889> but<00:00:14.280> on<00:00:14.460> I<00:00:14.820> think<00:00:15.150> we

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:15.210 
we perform the right but on I think we

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:17.689 
we perform the right but on I think we
could<00:00:15.330> have<00:00:15.420> done<00:00:15.540> better<00:00:15.719> but<00:00:16.710> what<00:00:16.920> on<00:00:17.130> the

00:00:17.689 --> 00:00:17.699 
could have done better but what on the

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:19.849 
could have done better but what on the
court<00:00:17.970> to<00:00:18.119> our<00:00:18.210> and<00:00:18.510> red<00:00:18.779> card<00:00:19.020> I<00:00:19.230> thought<00:00:19.740> as

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:19.859 
court to our and red card I thought as

00:00:19.859 --> 00:00:21.170 
court to our and red card I thought as
he<00:00:20.010> was<00:00:20.189> plainly<00:00:20.369> months<00:00:20.760> so<00:00:20.850> I<00:00:20.880> didn't<00:00:21.119> think

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180 
he was plainly months so I didn't think

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.929 
he was plainly months so I didn't think
that<00:00:21.330> was<00:00:21.420> a<00:00:21.480> red<00:00:21.600> card<00:00:21.840> but<00:00:22.590> ya<00:00:22.800> fer<00:00:23.310> Peter<00:00:23.699> ref

00:00:40.280 --> 00:00:40.290 
on yeah the game was dull and I don't

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:41.510 
on yeah the game was dull and I don't
know<00:00:40.350> you<00:00:40.469> just<00:00:40.620> didn't<00:00:40.829> have<00:00:40.950> much<00:00:41.129> taste<00:00:41.340> to

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
know you just didn't have much taste to

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:43.670 
know you just didn't have much taste to
it<00:00:41.550> today<00:00:41.760> how<00:00:42.329> are<00:00:42.450> you<00:00:42.570> I<00:00:42.809> think<00:00:43.290> they<00:00:43.469> didn't

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680 
it today how are you I think they didn't

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.830 
it today how are you I think they didn't
play<00:00:43.800> as<00:00:44.100> I<00:00:44.450> thought<00:00:45.450> they<00:00:45.570> were<00:00:45.629> going<00:00:45.780> to

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:45.840 
play as I thought they were going to

00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:47.180 
play as I thought they were going to
play<00:00:46.020> because<00:00:46.200> I<00:00:46.469> think<00:00:46.829> he's<00:00:46.920> going<00:00:47.070> to<00:00:47.129> be

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
play because I think he's going to be

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.670 
play because I think he's going to be
easy<00:00:47.520> wing<00:00:47.789> you<00:00:48.090> three<00:00:48.420> points<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:49.289> problem

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:49.680 
easy wing you three points the problem

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.619 
easy wing you three points the problem
was<00:00:49.800> like<00:00:50.070> the<00:00:50.370> defense<00:00:50.730> was<00:00:50.879> not<00:00:51.090> like<00:00:51.300> that

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
was like the defense was not like that

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:53.630 
was like the defense was not like that
great<00:00:51.930> I<00:00:52.170> thought<00:00:52.800> the<00:00:53.010> attacking<00:00:53.250> was<00:00:53.520> like

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:53.640 
great I thought the attacking was like

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:56.270 
great I thought the attacking was like
all<00:00:53.850> right<00:00:53.910> but<00:00:54.629> as<00:00:54.809> soon<00:00:54.960> as<00:00:55.140> like<00:00:55.379> Coulthard

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:56.280 
all right but as soon as like Coulthard

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.340 
all right but as soon as like Coulthard
that<00:00:56.489> the<00:00:56.610> the<00:00:57.059> player<00:00:57.270> the<00:00:57.690> goalkeeper<00:00:58.170> came

00:00:58.340 --> 00:00:58.350 
that the the player the goalkeeper came

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.279 
that the the player the goalkeeper came
off<00:00:58.500> a<00:00:58.739> game<00:00:59.070> red<00:00:59.309> card<00:00:59.579> just<00:01:00.210> one<00:01:00.390> that<00:01:01.109> the

00:01:01.279 --> 00:01:01.289 
off a game red card just one that the

00:01:01.289 --> 00:01:02.959 
off a game red card just one that the
defense<00:01:01.559> was<00:01:01.710> all<00:01:01.920> over<00:01:02.129> the<00:01:02.219> place<00:01:02.430> I<00:01:02.730> didn't

00:01:02.959 --> 00:01:02.969 
defense was all over the place I didn't

00:01:02.969 --> 00:01:04.759 
defense was all over the place I didn't
really<00:01:03.059> think<00:01:03.239> they'll<00:01:03.600> go<00:01:04.260> on<00:01:04.290> point<00:01:04.650> today

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769 
really think they'll go on point today

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:07.039 
really think they'll go on point today

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:36.240 
today and as a so I think there's always

00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:39.590 
today and as a so I think there's always
top<00:01:36.420> drawer<00:01:36.630> in<00:01:36.900> it<00:01:37.070> yes<00:01:38.070> well<00:01:38.670> I'm<00:01:38.850> from<00:01:39.360> now

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:39.600 
top drawer in it yes well I'm from now

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.870 
top drawer in it yes well I'm from now
you<00:01:39.960> know<00:01:40.049> we<00:01:40.170> got<00:01:40.200> sitting<00:01:40.560> next<00:01:40.680> you<00:01:41.009> feel

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:41.880 
you know we got sitting next you feel

00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.359 
you know we got sitting next you feel
will<00:01:42.630> be<00:01:42.720> able<00:01:42.810> to<00:01:42.930> improve<00:01:43.350> you<00:01:44.250> know

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
will be able to improve you know

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:46.190 
will be able to improve you know
bouncing<00:01:44.729> off<00:01:44.850> this<00:01:45.000> or<00:01:45.299> two<00:01:45.420> to<00:01:45.600> draw<00:01:45.869> do<00:01:46.140> you

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:46.200 
bouncing off this or two to draw do you

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.139 
bouncing off this or two to draw do you
think<00:01:46.439> the<00:01:46.979> intensity<00:01:47.430> is<00:01:47.520> there<00:01:47.729> considering

00:01:48.139 --> 00:01:48.149 
think the intensity is there considering

00:01:48.149 --> 00:01:49.730 
think the intensity is there considering
preseason<00:01:48.689> we<00:01:48.899> were<00:01:49.020> a<00:01:49.049> bit<00:01:49.170> flat<00:01:49.500> do<00:01:49.649> you

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
preseason we were a bit flat do you

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.260 
preseason we were a bit flat do you
think<00:01:49.920> now<00:01:50.100> we've<00:01:50.340> got<00:01:50.520> that<00:01:50.640> intensity<00:01:51.090> back

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
think now we've got that intensity back

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.960 
think now we've got that intensity back
yeah<00:01:51.780> I'm<00:01:51.960> not<00:01:52.140> feud<00:01:52.409> of<00:01:52.470> silly<00:01:52.710> at<00:01:52.860> all<00:01:53.040> um<00:01:53.250> I

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:53.970 
yeah I'm not feud of silly at all um I

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:55.429 
yeah I'm not feud of silly at all um I
don't<00:01:54.420> think<00:01:54.570> they've<00:01:54.810> improved<00:01:55.170> that<00:01:55.409> much

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
don't think they've improved that much

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.399 
don't think they've improved that much
apart<00:01:55.979> from<00:01:56.159> delfin<00:01:56.549> sterling<00:01:56.969> but<00:01:57.540> on<00:01:57.750> the

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409 
apart from delfin sterling but on the

00:01:58.409 --> 00:02:00.700 
apart from delfin sterling but on the
squad<00:01:58.649> is<00:01:58.680> pretty<00:01:58.950> much<00:01:59.040> the<00:01:59.100> same<00:01:59.369> so<00:02:00.270> yeah<00:02:00.450> um

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:00.710 
squad is pretty much the same so yeah um

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:03.109 
squad is pretty much the same so yeah um
you<00:02:01.710> know<00:02:01.860> I'm<00:02:02.100> not<00:02:02.310> I'm<00:02:02.430> not<00:02:02.460> food<00:02:02.759> of<00:02:02.880> them<00:02:03.000> at

00:02:03.109 --> 00:02:03.119 
you know I'm not I'm not food of them at

00:02:03.119 --> 00:02:04.700 
you know I'm not I'm not food of them at
all<00:02:03.299> I<00:02:03.479> think<00:02:03.780> we<00:02:03.840> should<00:02:03.869> we<00:02:04.409> should<00:02:04.439> be

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:04.710 
all I think we should we should be

00:02:04.710 --> 00:02:06.950 
all I think we should we should be
better<00:02:04.979> soon

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:06.960 
better soon

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:10.010 
better soon
now<00:02:07.799> I<00:02:07.830> think<00:02:08.160> like<00:02:08.399> like<00:02:08.850> the<00:02:09.090> keyboard<00:02:09.569> and

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020 
now I think like like the keyboard and

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:12.410 
now I think like like the keyboard and
you'll<00:02:10.289> go<00:02:10.790> basically<00:02:11.790> I<00:02:11.819> think<00:02:12.120> it's<00:02:12.330> going

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:12.420 
you'll go basically I think it's going

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:14.120 
you'll go basically I think it's going
to<00:02:12.510> be<00:02:12.600> a<00:02:12.660> store<00:02:13.260> a<00:02:13.290> bit<00:02:13.500> of<00:02:13.590> a<00:02:13.650> problem<00:02:13.860> cause

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.130 
to be a store a bit of a problem cause

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:16.490 
to be a store a bit of a problem cause
cities<00:02:14.430> like<00:02:14.880> the<00:02:15.090> fence<00:02:15.870> and<00:02:16.050> before<00:02:16.380> the

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:16.500 
cities like the fence and before the

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.650 
cities like the fence and before the
strike<00:02:16.709> is<00:02:16.890> it<00:02:17.120> decently<00:02:18.120> compared<00:02:18.420> to<00:02:18.540> our

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:18.660 
strike is it decently compared to our

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.600 
strike is it decently compared to our
spot<00:02:18.930> you<00:02:19.290> need<00:02:19.410> to<00:02:19.500> improve<00:02:19.620> on<00:02:19.920> a<00:02:19.950> few<00:02:20.310> stops

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
spot you need to improve on a few stops

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.820 
spot you need to improve on a few stops
