you<00:00:32.850> know<00:00:32.880> what<00:00:33.180> kind<00:00:33.450> to<00:00:33.690> buy<00:00:33.890> this<00:00:34.890> kind<00:00:35.280> of

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
you know what kind to buy this kind of

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:38.600 
you know what kind to buy this kind of
salt<00:00:35.730> is<00:00:35.969> cheaper<00:00:36.420> and<00:00:36.860> it's<00:00:37.860> more<00:00:38.100> available

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:38.610 
salt is cheaper and it's more available

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.209 
salt is cheaper and it's more available
so<00:00:38.820> this<00:00:39.450> has<00:00:39.660> no<00:00:39.870> additives<00:00:40.410> in<00:00:40.559> it<00:00:40.800> and<00:00:41.010> what

00:00:41.209 --> 00:00:41.219 
so this has no additives in it and what

00:00:41.219 --> 00:00:42.799 
so this has no additives in it and what
we're<00:00:41.370> going<00:00:41.520> to<00:00:41.550> show<00:00:41.850> you<00:00:41.879> is<00:00:42.239> how<00:00:42.390> easy<00:00:42.660> it

00:00:42.799 --> 00:00:42.809 
we're going to show you is how easy it

00:00:42.809 --> 00:00:45.770 
we're going to show you is how easy it
is<00:00:43.020> to<00:00:43.739> add<00:00:43.890> the<00:00:44.160> salt<00:00:44.399> now<00:00:44.670> this<00:00:45.329> stuff<00:00:45.539> does

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
is to add the salt now this stuff does

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:50.090 
is to add the salt now this stuff does
weigh<00:00:46.020> a<00:00:46.050> little<00:00:46.289> bit<00:00:46.789> weighs<00:00:47.789> 40<00:00:48.180> pounds<00:00:49.100> so

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:50.100 
weigh a little bit weighs 40 pounds so

00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:52.790 
weigh a little bit weighs 40 pounds so
it's<00:00:50.219> not<00:00:50.430> lightweight<00:00:51.320> but<00:00:52.320> it's<00:00:52.590> fairly

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:52.800 
it's not lightweight but it's fairly

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:55.430 
it's not lightweight but it's fairly
easy<00:00:53.010> to<00:00:53.309> pick<00:00:53.489> up<00:00:53.640> and<00:00:53.820> dump<00:00:54.050> so<00:00:55.050> what<00:00:55.170> you<00:00:55.289> do

this<00:01:22.980> is<00:01:23.130> an<00:01:23.250> older<00:01:23.520> system<00:01:23.940> so<00:01:24.120> don't<00:01:24.150> judge

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:24.510 
this is an older system so don't judge

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:26.900 
this is an older system so don't judge
okay<00:01:24.840> she<00:01:25.380> just<00:01:25.500> installed<00:01:26.040> this<00:01:26.280> this

years<00:01:28.410> and<00:01:28.860> it's<00:01:29.820> been<00:01:29.970> added<00:01:30.180> salt<00:01:30.480> to

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:30.600 
years and it's been added salt to

years and it's been added salt to
periodically<00:01:31.290> this<00:01:32.070> is<00:01:32.250> about<00:01:32.490> as<00:01:32.610> high<00:01:32.790> as

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
periodically this is about as high as

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.390 
periodically this is about as high as
you<00:01:33.150> want<00:01:33.330> to<00:01:33.570> get<00:01:33.780> the<00:01:33.960> salt<00:01:34.170> level<00:01:34.560> because

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:35.400 
you want to get the salt level because

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.000 
you want to get the salt level because
if<00:01:35.520> it<00:01:35.640> goes<00:01:35.760> much<00:01:36.030> higher<00:01:36.090> it<00:01:37.080> will<00:01:37.290> cause<00:01:37.980> it

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:38.010 
if it goes much higher it will cause it

00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:40.100 
if it goes much higher it will cause it
to<00:01:38.190> become<00:01:38.520> impacted<00:01:39.330> and<00:01:39.510> it<00:01:39.690> could<00:01:39.870> stop

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
content and then it has a cartridge

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:15.290 
content and then it has a cartridge
filter<00:02:12.690> for<00:02:13.320> sediment<00:02:13.770> control<00:02:14.160> so<00:02:15.120> this

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:15.300 
filter for sediment control so this

00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:18.800 
filter for sediment control so this
system<00:02:15.540> is<00:02:15.840> a<00:02:15.900> basic<00:02:16.410> iron<00:02:17.250> removal<00:02:17.810> technique

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:18.810 
system is a basic iron removal technique

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.110 
system is a basic iron removal technique
that<00:02:19.019> we've<00:02:19.170> been<00:02:19.470> using<00:02:19.709> for<00:02:19.860> years<00:02:20.120> the

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
that we've been using for years the

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.970 
that we've been using for years the
water<00:02:21.390> has<00:02:24.140> enough<00:02:25.140> iron<00:02:25.410> in<00:02:25.650> it<00:02:25.769> that<00:02:25.890> it

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:25.980 
water has enough iron in it that it

00:02:25.980 --> 00:02:29.660 
water has enough iron in it that it
would<00:02:26.040> cause<00:02:26.250> stain<00:02:26.640> in<00:02:26.940> the<00:02:27.600> toilets<00:02:28.050> and<00:02:28.670> the

00:02:29.660 --> 00:02:29.670 
would cause stain in the toilets and the

00:02:29.670 --> 00:02:32.810 
would cause stain in the toilets and the
taste<00:02:29.970> would<00:02:30.239> be<00:02:30.420> terrible<00:02:31.260> so<00:02:32.070> by<00:02:32.220> using<00:02:32.459> this

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:32.820 
taste would be terrible so by using this

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:37.070 
taste would be terrible so by using this
it<00:02:33.030> makes<00:02:33.810> the<00:02:33.989> water<00:02:34.140> more<00:02:34.680> pleasant<00:02:35.690> I<00:02:36.690> hope

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.080 
it makes the water more pleasant I hope

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:38.900 
it makes the water more pleasant I hope
this<00:02:37.230> is<00:02:37.380> helped<00:02:37.650> and<00:02:37.800> showing<00:02:38.130> how<00:02:38.550> to<00:02:38.610> add

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:38.910 
this is helped and showing how to add

00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:42.200 
this is helped and showing how to add
salt<00:02:39.239> to<00:02:39.630> a<00:02:39.660> water<00:02:39.930> softener
