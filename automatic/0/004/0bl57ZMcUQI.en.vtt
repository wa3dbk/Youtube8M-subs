00:01:30.989 --> 00:01:30.999 
up way every night just wasn't ideal and

00:01:30.999 --> 00:01:33.940 
up way every night just wasn't ideal and
I<00:01:31.999> just<00:01:32.719> couldn't<00:01:32.899> see<00:01:33.109> myself<00:01:33.140> doing<00:01:33.679> that

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:36.740 
for the next 30 to four years so I

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:39.190

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:39.200 
thought nursing was actually pretty

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.789 
thought nursing was actually pretty
similar<00:01:39.829> to<00:01:40.100> waitressing<00:01:40.729> to<00:01:41.090> me<00:01:41.679> because<00:01:42.679> it

00:01:42.789 --> 00:01:42.799 
similar to waitressing to me because it

00:01:42.799 --> 00:01:45.099

career<00:01:58.850> that<00:01:59.749> had<00:02:00.079> to<00:02:00.170> do<00:02:00.259> with<00:02:00.289> nursing<00:02:00.710> so<00:02:01.130> I

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:01.460 
career that had to do with nursing so I

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.399 
career that had to do with nursing so I
without<00:02:02.209> thinking<00:02:02.630> about<00:02:02.749> it<00:02:02.840> too<00:02:02.959> much<00:02:03.259> I

00:02:03.399 --> 00:02:03.409 
without thinking about it too much I

00:02:03.409 --> 00:02:05.109 
without thinking about it too much I
just<00:02:03.439> said<00:02:03.829> you<00:02:04.159> know<00:02:04.189> I'm<00:02:04.459> just<00:02:04.549> gonna<00:02:04.729> try<00:02:05.060> it

00:02:05.109 --> 00:02:05.119 
just said you know I'm just gonna try it

00:02:05.119 --> 00:02:08.440 
just said you know I'm just gonna try it
and<00:02:05.829> had<00:02:06.829> I<00:02:06.859> really<00:02:07.340> known<00:02:07.520> how<00:02:07.670> hard<00:02:07.999> it<00:02:08.119> was<00:02:08.209> I

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:08.450 
and had I really known how hard it was I

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:10.630 
and had I really known how hard it was I
probably<00:02:08.660> would<00:02:09.080> have<00:02:09.170> rethought<00:02:09.319> about<00:02:09.530> it<00:02:09.920> I

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:10.640 
probably would have rethought about it I

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:13.120 
probably would have rethought about it I
didn't<00:02:10.819> realize<00:02:11.420> how<00:02:12.200> hard<00:02:12.500> nursing<00:02:12.860> school

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:13.130 
didn't realize how hard nursing school

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:14.740 
didn't realize how hard nursing school
was<00:02:13.280> and<00:02:13.640> how<00:02:13.790> hard<00:02:14.060> the<00:02:14.180> prerequisite

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:14.750 
was and how hard the prerequisite

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:16.840 
was and how hard the prerequisite
classes<00:02:14.930> were<00:02:15.230> I<00:02:15.380> had<00:02:15.560> no<00:02:15.770> idea<00:02:16.040> the<00:02:16.819> other

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:16.850 
classes were I had no idea the other

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:18.460 
classes were I had no idea the other
thing<00:02:17.270> that<00:02:17.300> I<00:02:17.480> really<00:02:17.510> liked<00:02:17.930> about<00:02:18.020> nursing

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470 
thing that I really liked about nursing

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:20.650 
thing that I really liked about nursing
was<00:02:18.680> that<00:02:18.830> it<00:02:19.010> was<00:02:19.100> three<00:02:19.490> days<00:02:19.910> a<00:02:19.940> week<00:02:20.180> I

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:20.660 
was that it was three days a week I

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:24.040 
was that it was three days a week I
could<00:02:21.319> not<00:02:21.500> get<00:02:21.680> over<00:02:21.709> that<00:02:22.069> three<00:02:22.819> days<00:02:23.030> on<00:02:23.390> in

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:24.050 
could not get over that three days on in

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:27.010 
could not get over that three days on in
four<00:02:24.410> days<00:02:24.620> off<00:02:24.830> so<00:02:25.370> the<00:02:26.030> way<00:02:26.180> I<00:02:26.209> saw<00:02:26.569> nursing

00:02:27.010 --> 00:02:27.020 
four days off so the way I saw nursing

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:29.740 
four days off so the way I saw nursing
was<00:02:27.260> well<00:02:27.680> I<00:02:27.709> could<00:02:28.070> do<00:02:28.190> this<00:02:28.430> um<00:02:28.730> you<00:02:29.630> know

00:02:29.740 --> 00:02:29.750 
was well I could do this um you know

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.240 
was well I could do this um you know
this<00:02:29.990> could<00:02:30.170> be<00:02:30.290> like<00:02:30.500> my<00:02:30.709> bread<00:02:31.070> and<00:02:31.100> butter

00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:31.250 
this could be like my bread and butter

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.430 
this could be like my bread and butter
and<00:02:31.790> I<00:02:32.570> could<00:02:32.750> do<00:02:32.810> something<00:02:33.110> else<00:02:33.260> on<00:02:33.350> the

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:33.440 
and I could do something else on the

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.830 
and I could do something else on the
side<00:02:33.680> because<00:02:34.070> I<00:02:34.580> have<00:02:34.910> actually<00:02:35.390> more<00:02:35.600> days

00:02:35.830 --> 00:02:35.840 
side because I have actually more days

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:39.040 
side because I have actually more days
off<00:02:36.080> than<00:02:36.440> I<00:02:36.680> would<00:02:36.830> be<00:02:36.950> working<00:02:37.180> so<00:02:38.180> that<00:02:38.750> was

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:39.050 
off than I would be working so that was

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:40.240 
off than I would be working so that was
something<00:02:39.350> that<00:02:39.380> I<00:02:39.530> really<00:02:39.620> thought<00:02:40.069> was

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:40.250 
something that I really thought was

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:43.150 
something that I really thought was
amazing<00:02:40.459> and<00:02:40.970> I<00:02:41.690> still<00:02:42.080> think<00:02:42.319> is<00:02:42.410> amazing<00:02:42.890> I

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:43.160 
amazing and I still think is amazing I

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:45.340 
amazing and I still think is amazing I
mean<00:02:43.850> I<00:02:44.090> know<00:02:44.239> a<00:02:44.420> lot<00:02:44.510> of<00:02:44.720> nurses<00:02:45.050> that<00:02:45.200> work

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:45.350 
mean I know a lot of nurses that work

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:47.620 
mean I know a lot of nurses that work
for<00:02:45.650> days<00:02:45.860> not<00:02:46.459> every<00:02:46.760> week<00:02:46.940> but<00:02:46.970> like<00:02:47.330> some

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:47.630 
for days not every week but like some

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:50.080 
for days not every week but like some
weeks<00:02:47.840> and<00:02:48.110> it's<00:02:48.380> not<00:02:48.980> that<00:02:49.130> hard<00:02:49.370> though<00:02:49.760> and

00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:50.090 
weeks and it's not that hard though and

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:52.479 
weeks and it's not that hard though and
that<00:02:50.120> extra<00:02:50.810> day<00:02:50.930> is<00:02:51.080> a<00:02:51.110> time<00:02:51.320> and<00:02:51.470> a<00:02:51.530> half<00:02:51.650> so<00:02:51.980> I

00:02:52.479 --> 00:02:52.489 
that extra day is a time and a half so I

00:02:52.489 --> 00:02:54.340 
that extra day is a time and a half so I
just<00:02:52.940> saw<00:02:53.120> a<00:02:53.150> lot<00:02:53.360> of<00:02:53.480> flexibility<00:02:54.019> with<00:02:54.110> it

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:54.350 
just saw a lot of flexibility with it

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:56.500 
just saw a lot of flexibility with it
and<00:02:54.530> I<00:02:54.620> still<00:02:54.950> see<00:02:55.130> a<00:02:55.370> lot<00:02:55.610> of<00:02:55.640> flexibility

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:56.510 
and I still see a lot of flexibility

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:58.810 
and I still see a lot of flexibility
with<00:02:56.630> it<00:02:56.870> the<00:02:57.830> other<00:02:58.040> thing<00:02:58.310> that<00:02:58.340> I<00:02:58.489> really

00:02:58.810 --> 00:02:58.820 
with it the other thing that I really

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:00.729 
with it the other thing that I really
liked<00:02:59.030> was<00:02:59.209> the<00:02:59.239> outlook<00:02:59.900> of<00:03:00.080> Nursing<00:03:00.500> the

00:03:00.729 --> 00:03:00.739 
liked was the outlook of Nursing the

00:03:00.739 --> 00:03:03.190 
liked was the outlook of Nursing the
outlook<00:03:01.580> compared<00:03:01.970> to<00:03:02.090> other<00:03:02.239> jobs<00:03:02.540> seems<00:03:03.050> a

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:03.200 
outlook compared to other jobs seems a

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.560 
outlook compared to other jobs seems a
lot<00:03:03.380> more<00:03:03.530> promising<00:03:04.100> I<00:03:04.340> still<00:03:05.300> think<00:03:05.510> about

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:05.570 
lot more promising I still think about

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:08.710 
lot more promising I still think about
it<00:03:05.840> today<00:03:05.989> and<00:03:06.670> even<00:03:07.670> though<00:03:07.700> there<00:03:08.090> are<00:03:08.269> some

00:03:08.710 --> 00:03:08.720 
it today and even though there are some

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.720 
it today and even though there are some
people<00:03:09.410> that<00:03:09.440> are<00:03:09.590> saying<00:03:09.950> that<00:03:10.190> nursing<00:03:10.610> is

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:10.730 
people that are saying that nursing is

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:12.970 
people that are saying that nursing is
slowing<00:03:11.150> down<00:03:11.300> a<00:03:11.360> bit<00:03:11.480> I<00:03:11.870> don't<00:03:12.230> think<00:03:12.769> that

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:12.980 
slowing down a bit I don't think that

00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:15.580 
slowing down a bit I don't think that
that<00:03:13.130> is<00:03:13.370> going<00:03:13.640> to<00:03:13.850> be<00:03:14.030> forever<00:03:14.420> because<00:03:15.380> we

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:15.590 
that is going to be forever because we

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:18.280 
that is going to be forever because we
have<00:03:15.769> the<00:03:16.010> baby<00:03:16.220> boomer<00:03:16.820> generation<00:03:16.930> that<00:03:17.930> you

00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:18.290 
have the baby boomer generation that you

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:20.410 
have the baby boomer generation that you
know<00:03:18.650> in<00:03:18.829> the<00:03:18.920> next<00:03:19.190> 20<00:03:19.489> to<00:03:19.610> 30<00:03:19.820> years<00:03:20.150> it's

00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:20.420 
know in the next 20 to 30 years it's

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:22.569 
know in the next 20 to 30 years it's
going<00:03:20.570> to<00:03:20.810> need<00:03:20.900> a<00:03:20.959> lot<00:03:21.380> of<00:03:21.410> care<00:03:21.799> actually

00:03:22.569 --> 00:03:22.579 
going to need a lot of care actually

00:03:22.579 --> 00:03:25.000 
going to need a lot of care actually
probably<00:03:22.730> the<00:03:22.910> next<00:03:23.120> ten<00:03:23.239> years<00:03:23.440> and<00:03:24.440> so<00:03:24.980> I

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.010 
probably the next ten years and so I

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:28.270 
probably the next ten years and so I
really<00:03:25.640> see<00:03:26.060> health<00:03:26.510> care<00:03:26.840> as<00:03:27.079> being<00:03:27.470> one<00:03:28.250> of

00:03:28.270 --> 00:03:28.280 
really see health care as being one of

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.400 
really see health care as being one of
the<00:03:28.430> safest<00:03:29.180> routes<00:03:29.540> I<00:03:29.750> mean<00:03:29.900> nothing's<00:03:30.170> safe

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:30.410 
the safest routes I mean nothing's safe

00:03:30.410 --> 00:03:32.380 
the safest routes I mean nothing's safe
nowadays<00:03:30.769> but<00:03:30.950> one<00:03:31.070> of<00:03:31.130> the<00:03:31.340> safest<00:03:32.239> and<00:03:32.299> most

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:32.390 
nowadays but one of the safest and most

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:35.229 
nowadays but one of the safest and most
secure<00:03:32.540> routes<00:03:33.079> that<00:03:33.290> you<00:03:33.410> could<00:03:33.590> take<00:03:34.239> so

00:03:35.229 --> 00:03:35.239 
secure routes that you could take so

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:37.600 
secure routes that you could take so
that<00:03:35.690> was<00:03:36.230> another<00:03:36.440> thing<00:03:36.560> job<00:03:36.860> security<00:03:37.280> was

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:37.610 
that was another thing job security was

00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:39.310 
that was another thing job security was
definitely<00:03:38.329> up<00:03:38.540> there<00:03:38.600> I<00:03:38.870> mean<00:03:39.049> you<00:03:39.110> want<00:03:39.290> to

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:39.320
