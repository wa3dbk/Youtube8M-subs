a good game plan they ran the ball
successfully<00:01:41.640> that's<00:01:42.119> what<00:01:42.329> got<00:01:42.509> them<00:01:42.689> to<00:01:42.869> win

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990

in<00:01:43.110> this<00:01:43.200> game<00:01:43.439> to<00:01:43.649> be<00:01:43.680> ultimately<00:01:44.189> because

00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:44.520 
in this game to be ultimately because

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:46.760 
in this game to be ultimately because
the<00:01:44.549> Saints<00:01:45.000> are<00:01:45.119> a<00:01:45.180> team<00:01:45.840> that<00:01:45.869> just<00:01:46.409> doesn't

00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:46.770 
the Saints are a team that just doesn't

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:48.050 
the Saints are a team that just doesn't
know<00:01:46.950> how<00:01:47.070> to<00:01:47.100> run<00:01:47.280> the<00:01:47.369> football<00:01:47.549> and<00:01:47.729> see<00:01:47.909> if

know how to run the football and see if

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.359 
know how to run the football and see if
I<00:01:48.149> mean<00:01:48.329> this<00:01:48.780> is<00:01:48.990> not<00:01:49.200> even<00:01:49.320> close<00:01:49.860> to<00:01:49.920> the<00:01:50.189> way

00:01:50.359 --> 00:01:50.369 
I mean this is not even close to the way

00:01:50.369 --> 00:01:51.469 
I mean this is not even close to the way
they<00:01:50.520> used<00:01:50.700> to<00:01:50.729> be<00:01:50.880> able<00:01:50.939> to<00:01:51.060> run<00:01:51.180> the<00:01:51.299> football

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990 
not because they don't have the

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:06.050 
not because they don't have the
offensive<00:02:04.409> line<00:02:04.590> for<00:02:04.950> it<00:02:05.070> because<00:02:05.820> they<00:02:05.939> don't

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:06.060 
offensive line for it because they don't

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.969

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
don't have faith in the run and for that

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:12.080 
don't have faith in the run and for that
reason<00:02:11.370> they<00:02:11.580> don't<00:02:11.640> trust

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:12.090 
reason they don't trust

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.850

00:05:29.760 --> 00:05:29.770 
is the best this is this what I find

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:31.080 
is the best this is this what I find
mind-blowing<00:05:30.550> to<00:05:30.699> me

00:05:31.080 --> 00:05:31.090 
mind-blowing to me

00:05:31.090 --> 00:05:34.680 
mind-blowing to me
this<00:05:31.630> is<00:05:31.990> the<00:05:32.289> best<00:05:32.650> the<00:05:33.430> Saints<00:05:33.909> defense<00:05:34.120> has

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:34.690 
this is the best the Saints defense has

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:39.330 
this is the best the Saints defense has
looked<00:05:35.139> I<00:05:35.500> think<00:05:36.220> in<00:05:36.430> the<00:05:36.880> Drew<00:05:37.240> Brees<00:05:37.690> era<00:05:38.340> to

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:39.340 
looked I think in the Drew Brees era to

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:43.260 
looked I think in the Drew Brees era to
me<00:05:39.580> and<00:05:39.909> yet<00:05:40.659> still<00:05:41.560> they're<00:05:42.159> not<00:05:42.190> good<00:05:43.000> enough

00:05:43.260 --> 00:05:43.270 
me and yet still they're not good enough

00:05:43.270 --> 00:05:45.510 
me and yet still they're not good enough
for<00:05:43.990> some<00:05:44.320> reason<00:05:44.680> the<00:05:44.800> offense<00:05:45.340> is<00:05:45.490> not

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:45.520 
for some reason the offense is not

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:48.180 
for some reason the offense is not
consistent<00:05:46.389> enough<00:05:46.780> they're<00:05:47.289> not<00:05:47.650> good

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:48.190 
consistent enough they're not good

00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:50.879 
consistent enough they're not good
enough<00:05:48.490> on<00:05:48.729> offense<00:05:49.180> why<00:05:49.449> I<00:05:49.479> don't<00:05:50.110> know<00:05:50.260> you

00:05:50.879 --> 00:05:50.889 
enough on offense why I don't know you

00:05:50.889 --> 00:05:52.320 
enough on offense why I don't know you
could<00:05:51.039> say<00:05:51.220> maybe<00:05:51.430> they<00:05:51.669> don't<00:05:51.789> run<00:05:52.030> the<00:05:52.150> ball

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:52.330
