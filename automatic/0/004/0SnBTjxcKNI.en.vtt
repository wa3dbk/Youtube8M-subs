wires and so let's get started okay I've

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:19.740 
wires and so let's get started okay I've
gone<00:01:18.520> ahead<00:01:18.700> and<00:01:18.820> cut<00:01:19.060> a<00:01:19.119> length<00:01:19.390> of<00:01:19.540> wire

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:19.750 
gone ahead and cut a length of wire

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:23.130 
gone ahead and cut a length of wire
about<00:01:20.170> five<00:01:20.530> inches<00:01:20.920> long<00:01:21.780> we're<00:01:22.780> going<00:01:22.990> to

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:23.140 
about five inches long we're going to

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:27.450 
about five inches long we're going to
start<00:01:23.439> with<00:01:23.799> a<00:01:24.689> loop<00:01:25.689> at<00:01:26.170> the<00:01:26.229> end<00:01:26.530> of<00:01:26.860> our<00:01:26.979> ring

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:27.460 
start with a loop at the end of our ring

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:30.569 
start with a loop at the end of our ring
like<00:01:28.270> that<00:01:29.430> honey

00:01:30.569 --> 00:01:30.579 
like that honey

00:01:30.579 --> 00:01:33.690 
like that honey
then<00:01:30.850> we're<00:01:31.060> going<00:01:31.210> to<00:01:31.299> use<00:01:31.390> the<00:01:31.720> marker<00:01:32.700> we're

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:33.700 
then we're going to use the marker we're

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:39.700 
then we're going to use the marker we're
going<00:01:33.939> to<00:01:34.060> bring<00:01:34.240> this<00:01:34.479> around<00:01:34.659> like<00:01:35.439> that

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:39.710 

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:41.950 

I<00:01:39.740> want<00:01:40.400> a<00:01:40.490> teardrop<00:01:40.970> shape<00:01:41.300> so<00:01:41.660> we're<00:01:41.810> not

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:41.960 
I want a teardrop shape so we're not

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:44.920 
I want a teardrop shape so we're not
going<00:01:42.350> to<00:01:42.380> tighten<00:01:42.980> it<00:01:43.250> up<00:01:43.690> really<00:01:44.690> tight

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:44.930 
going to tighten it up really tight

00:01:44.930 --> 00:01:46.330 
going to tighten it up really tight
there<00:01:45.230> we're<00:01:45.380> going<00:01:45.560> to<00:01:45.650> leave<00:01:45.830> that<00:01:45.860> little

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:46.340 
there we're going to leave that little

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:53.230 
there we're going to leave that little
bit<00:01:46.460> of<00:01:46.550> space<00:01:48.340> and<00:01:51.400> going<00:01:52.400> to<00:01:52.670> wind<00:01:52.940> this

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:53.240 
bit of space and going to wind this

00:01:53.240 --> 00:02:03.820 
bit of space and going to wind this
around<00:01:53.750> a<00:01:59.350> couple<00:02:00.350> of<00:02:00.500> times<00:02:01.180> okay<00:02:02.590> so<00:02:03.590> now<00:02:03.770> we

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:03.830 
around a couple of times okay so now we

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:07.090 
around a couple of times okay so now we
can<00:02:04.040> take<00:02:04.220> it<00:02:04.370> off<00:02:04.520> of<00:02:04.730> the<00:02:04.880> marker<00:02:05.860> and<00:02:06.860> here's

00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:07.100 
can take it off of the marker and here's

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:11.470 
can take it off of the marker and here's
what<00:02:07.280> it<00:02:07.370> looks<00:02:07.610> like<00:02:10.090> so<00:02:11.090> we're<00:02:11.240> going<00:02:11.390> to

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.480 
what it looks like so we're going to

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:14.920 
what it looks like so we're going to
tighten<00:02:11.870> up<00:02:11.930> this<00:02:12.290> ring<00:02:13.600> and<00:02:14.600> we're<00:02:14.690> going<00:02:14.870> to

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:14.930 
tighten up this ring and we're going to

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:20.590 
tighten up this ring and we're going to
turn<00:02:15.200> it<00:02:15.380> down<00:02:17.950> into<00:02:18.950> the<00:02:19.310> center<00:02:19.550> of<00:02:20.360> our

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:20.600 
turn it down into the center of our

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:28.030 
turn it down into the center of our
earring<00:02:22.000> so<00:02:23.000> that's<00:02:23.300> how<00:02:23.540> it<00:02:23.660> looks<00:02:25.630> okay<00:02:27.040> so

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:28.040 
earring so that's how it looks okay so

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:29.580 
earring so that's how it looks okay so
we're<00:02:28.160> going<00:02:28.280> to<00:02:28.370> make<00:02:28.490> another<00:02:28.730> loop<00:02:28.970> here

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:29.590 
we're going to make another loop here

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:32.080 
we're going to make another loop here
and<00:02:30.590> we<00:02:30.710> know<00:02:30.890> we<00:02:31.040> need<00:02:31.160> to<00:02:31.250> put<00:02:31.400> a<00:02:31.430> half<00:02:31.670> an

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.090 
and we know we need to put a half an

00:02:32.090 --> 00:02:35.560 
and we know we need to put a half an
inch<00:02:32.240> of<00:02:32.600> wire<00:02:32.840> so<00:02:33.470> we<00:02:33.680> can<00:02:33.800> go<00:02:34.100> ahead<00:02:34.190> and<00:02:34.610> trim

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:35.570 
inch of wire so we can go ahead and trim

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:45.540 
inch of wire so we can go ahead and trim
this<00:02:35.600> wire<00:02:36.730> to<00:02:37.730> one<00:02:37.940> half<00:02:38.180> inch<00:02:40.630> like<00:02:41.630> that

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:45.550 

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:51.840 

and<00:02:46.090> we're<00:02:46.210> going<00:02:46.420> to<00:02:46.480> make<00:02:46.690> a<00:02:46.930> loop<00:02:50.640> turn<00:02:51.640> it

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:51.850 
and we're going to make a loop turn it

00:02:51.850 --> 00:03:00.090 
and we're going to make a loop turn it
this<00:02:52.000> way<00:02:52.180> of<00:02:52.480> easier<00:02:54.270> make<00:02:55.270> our<00:02:55.600> loop<00:02:59.100> like

00:03:00.090 --> 00:03:00.100 
this way of easier make our loop like

00:03:00.100 --> 00:03:03.900 
this way of easier make our loop like
that<00:03:01.470> and<00:03:02.470> then<00:03:02.830> we're<00:03:03.010> going<00:03:03.190> to<00:03:03.280> position

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:03.910 
that and then we're going to position

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:10.410 
that and then we're going to position
that<00:03:04.120> loop<00:03:04.390> down<00:03:05.970> inside<00:03:08.970> and<00:03:09.970> we're<00:03:10.120> going<00:03:10.360> to

00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:10.420 
that loop down inside and we're going to

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:17.130 
that loop down inside and we're going to
turn<00:03:10.750> it<00:03:10.990> a<00:03:11.700> half<00:03:12.700> a<00:03:12.730> turn<00:03:15.780> and<00:03:16.780> that's<00:03:16.990> what

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:17.140 
turn it a half a turn and that's what

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:24.410 
turn it a half a turn and that's what
we're<00:03:17.260> going<00:03:17.470> to<00:03:17.620> hook<00:03:17.770> our<00:03:18.070> scroll<00:03:18.550> to

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.420 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:29.180 

okay<00:03:26.959> so<00:03:27.959> this<00:03:28.080> is<00:03:28.290> how<00:03:28.440> it<00:03:28.590> looks<00:03:28.800> at<00:03:29.010> this

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190 
okay so this is how it looks at this

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:32.690 
okay so this is how it looks at this
stage<00:03:29.780> we've<00:03:30.780> made<00:03:31.260> the<00:03:31.470> top<00:03:31.709> loop<00:03:31.980> we're

00:03:32.690 --> 00:03:32.700 
stage we've made the top loop we're

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:34.130 
stage we've made the top loop we're
straighten<00:03:33.150> that<00:03:33.209> out<00:03:33.270> after<00:03:33.840> a<00:03:33.870> while

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140 
straighten that out after a while

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:37.400 
straighten that out after a while
straighten<00:03:34.650> it<00:03:34.709> out<00:03:34.830> now<00:03:35.989> we've<00:03:36.989> made<00:03:37.260> our

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:37.410 
straighten it out now we've made our

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:40.220 
straighten it out now we've made our
first<00:03:37.680> our<00:03:38.099> loop<00:03:38.340> then<00:03:39.209> we<00:03:39.540> brought<00:03:39.989> this

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:40.230 
first our loop then we brought this

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:42.830 
first our loop then we brought this
around<00:03:40.530> the<00:03:40.620> black<00:03:40.830> marker<00:03:41.370> and<00:03:42.180> we<00:03:42.330> called<00:03:42.660> it

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
around the black marker and we called it

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:45.920 
around the black marker and we called it
around<00:03:43.110> the<00:03:43.380> base<00:03:43.560> here<00:03:44.450> went<00:03:45.450> brought<00:03:45.720> it

00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:45.930 
around the base here went brought it

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:48.770 
around the base here went brought it
down<00:03:46.110> into<00:03:46.560> the<00:03:46.680> middle<00:03:46.980> we<00:03:47.940> made<00:03:48.180> a<00:03:48.209> loop<00:03:48.540> in

00:03:48.770 --> 00:03:48.780 
down into the middle we made a loop in

00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:51.680 
down into the middle we made a loop in
the<00:03:48.810> middle<00:03:49.230> and<00:03:49.560> that's<00:03:50.519> all<00:03:50.970> we<00:03:51.180> need<00:03:51.390> for

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:51.690 
the middle and that's all we need for

00:03:51.690 --> 00:03:56.120 
the middle and that's all we need for
the<00:03:52.670> tear<00:03:53.670> drop<00:03:53.940> section<00:03:54.590> so<00:03:55.590> now<00:03:55.620> we're<00:03:55.980> going

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:56.130 
the tear drop section so now we're going

00:03:56.130 --> 00:04:00.759 
the tear drop section so now we're going
to<00:03:56.280> make<00:03:56.610> the<00:03:57.450> scroll<00:03:58.580> so<00:03:59.580> to<00:03:59.640> make<00:03:59.880> the<00:04:00.030> scroll

00:04:00.759 --> 00:04:00.769 
to make the scroll so to make the scroll

00:04:00.769 --> 00:04:03.470 
to make the scroll so to make the scroll
you<00:04:01.769> probably<00:04:02.310> only<00:04:02.580> need<00:04:02.730> an<00:04:03.060> inch<00:04:03.239> or<00:04:03.450> so

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:03.480 
you probably only need an inch or so

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:07.220 
you probably only need an inch or so
wire<00:04:03.989> but<00:04:04.380> it<00:04:05.220> makes<00:04:05.459> it<00:04:05.670> difficult<00:04:05.880> to<00:04:06.230> find

00:04:07.220 --> 00:04:07.230 
wire but it makes it difficult to find

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:09.410 
wire but it makes it difficult to find
it<00:04:07.500> if<00:04:07.650> you<00:04:07.680> don't<00:04:08.069> have<00:04:08.340> a<00:04:08.370> piece<00:04:08.880> to<00:04:09.060> hold<00:04:09.239> on

00:04:09.410 --> 00:04:09.420 
it if you don't have a piece to hold on

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:11.420 
it if you don't have a piece to hold on
to<00:04:09.630> so<00:04:09.780> I've<00:04:09.930> got<00:04:10.140> about<00:04:10.530> a<00:04:10.890> three<00:04:11.250> inch

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:11.430 
to so I've got about a three inch

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:14.210 
to so I've got about a three inch
section<00:04:12.299> here<00:04:12.630> so<00:04:13.620> we're<00:04:13.769> going<00:04:13.920> to<00:04:14.010> make<00:04:14.160> a

00:04:14.210 --> 00:04:14.220 
section here so we're going to make a

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:19.550 
section here so we're going to make a
circle<00:04:14.790> a<00:04:15.000> tight<00:04:15.950> little<00:04:16.950> circle<00:04:18.260> all<00:04:19.260> the<00:04:19.290> way

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:19.560 
circle a tight little circle all the way

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:25.100 
circle a tight little circle all the way
till<00:04:19.979> it<00:04:20.100> touches<00:04:20.989> the<00:04:21.989> other<00:04:22.019> side<00:04:22.880> and<00:04:24.110> then

00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:25.110 
till it touches the other side and then

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:27.230 
till it touches the other side and then
we're<00:04:25.290> going<00:04:25.470> to<00:04:25.620> wind<00:04:26.310> it<00:04:26.639> but<00:04:26.880> we're<00:04:27.060> going

00:04:27.230 --> 00:04:27.240 
we're going to wind it but we're going

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.740 
we're going to wind it but we're going
to<00:04:27.360> wind<00:04:27.750> it<00:04:28.130> loosely<00:04:29.130> so<00:04:30.000> let<00:04:30.120> me<00:04:30.240> get<00:04:30.419> the

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:30.750 
to wind it loosely so let me get the

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:35.900 
to wind it loosely so let me get the
pliers<00:04:32.690> so<00:04:33.690> we<00:04:34.680> want<00:04:34.919> to<00:04:35.070> loop<00:04:35.280> but<00:04:35.610> we<00:04:35.729> don't

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:35.910 
pliers so we want to loop but we don't

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:37.940 
pliers so we want to loop but we don't
want<00:04:36.060> it<00:04:36.150> to<00:04:36.240> be<00:04:36.360> tight<00:04:36.930> so<00:04:37.229> we're<00:04:37.470> just<00:04:37.500> going

00:04:37.940 --> 00:04:37.950 
want it to be tight so we're just going

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:45.310 
want it to be tight so we're just going
to<00:04:39.350> find<00:04:40.350> it<00:04:41.180> until<00:04:42.180> it<00:04:42.330> looks<00:04:42.570> like<00:04:42.690> that<00:04:44.270> okay

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:45.320 
to find it until it looks like that okay

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:48.200 
to find it until it looks like that okay
so<00:04:46.320> now<00:04:46.530> we<00:04:46.590> want<00:04:46.919> it<00:04:46.950> to<00:04:47.100> be<00:04:47.220> an<00:04:47.310> S<00:04:47.550> shape<00:04:47.880> so

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:48.210 
so now we want it to be an S shape so

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:50.920 
so now we want it to be an S shape so
we're<00:04:48.360> going<00:04:48.510> to<00:04:48.600> go<00:04:48.750> in<00:04:48.990> the<00:04:49.169> other<00:04:49.440> direction

00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:50.930 
we're going to go in the other direction

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:53.300 
we're going to go in the other direction
and<00:04:51.930> we're<00:04:52.200> going<00:04:52.440> to<00:04:52.560> bring<00:04:52.770> this<00:04:53.039> right

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:53.310 
and we're going to bring this right

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:57.680 
and we're going to bring this right
around<00:04:54.210> like<00:04:54.780> that<00:04:55.220> we're<00:04:56.220> going<00:04:56.580> to<00:04:56.729> form<00:04:57.450> a

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:57.690 
around like that we're going to form a

00:04:57.690 --> 00:05:03.860 
around like that we're going to form a
loop<00:04:58.020> at<00:04:58.890> this<00:04:59.220> end<00:04:59.490> like<00:05:00.240> that<00:05:01.130> okay<00:05:02.570> so<00:05:03.570> it's

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:03.870 
loop at this end like that okay so it's

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:05.810 
loop at this end like that okay so it's
like<00:05:04.110> an<00:05:04.260> S<00:05:04.410> this<00:05:04.620> is<00:05:04.770> the<00:05:04.950> first<00:05:05.190> look<00:05:05.430> we<00:05:05.640> made

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:05.820 
like an S this is the first look we made

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:08.120 
like an S this is the first look we made
then<00:05:06.180> we<00:05:06.330> brought<00:05:06.660> it<00:05:06.840> around<00:05:06.960> and<00:05:07.470> made

00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:08.130 
then we brought it around and made

00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:10.880 
then we brought it around and made
another<00:05:08.400> loop<00:05:08.700> so<00:05:09.630> now<00:05:09.810> we<00:05:09.870> can<00:05:10.229> just<00:05:10.260> trim<00:05:10.860> off

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:10.890 
another loop so now we can just trim off

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:17.140 
another loop so now we can just trim off
the<00:05:11.220> extra<00:05:13.250> just<00:05:14.250> cut<00:05:14.520> it<00:05:14.669> off

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:17.150 

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:22.760 

and<00:05:19.220> bring<00:05:20.220> our<00:05:20.400> loop<00:05:20.699> closed<00:05:21.240> again<00:05:21.770> like

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:22.770 
and bring our loop closed again like

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:26.059 
and bring our loop closed again like
that<00:05:23.720> so<00:05:24.720> now<00:05:24.900> we're<00:05:25.080> going<00:05:25.229> to<00:05:25.349> attach<00:05:25.530> or

00:05:26.059 --> 00:05:26.069 
that so now we're going to attach or

00:05:26.069 --> 00:05:29.600 
that so now we're going to attach or
going<00:05:26.250> to<00:05:26.310> open<00:05:26.639> that<00:05:26.849> and<00:05:28.340> we're<00:05:29.340> going<00:05:29.580> to

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:29.610 
going to open that and we're going to

00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:34.129 
going to open that and we're going to
attach<00:05:29.789> it<00:05:30.000> to<00:05:30.800> that<00:05:31.800> ring<00:05:32.659> that<00:05:33.659> we<00:05:33.870> made

00:05:34.129 --> 00:05:34.139 
attach it to that ring that we made

00:05:34.139 --> 00:05:39.920 
attach it to that ring that we made
inside<00:05:35.060> of<00:05:36.060> our<00:05:36.300> teardrop<00:05:36.930> shape<00:05:38.870> I'm<00:05:39.870> going

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:39.930 
inside of our teardrop shape I'm going

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:47.960 
inside of our teardrop shape I'm going
to<00:05:40.199> close<00:05:40.440> it<00:05:40.500> up<00:05:40.919> and<00:05:44.720> there<00:05:45.720> you<00:05:45.750> go<00:05:46.819> so<00:05:47.819> then

00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:47.970 
to close it up and there you go so then

00:05:47.970 --> 00:05:49.939 
to close it up and there you go so then
we're<00:05:48.120> going<00:05:48.360> to<00:05:48.479> attach<00:05:48.780> that<00:05:49.139> to<00:05:49.530> an<00:05:49.650> ear

00:05:49.939 --> 00:05:49.949 
we're going to attach that to an ear

00:05:49.949 --> 00:05:54.260 
we're going to attach that to an ear
