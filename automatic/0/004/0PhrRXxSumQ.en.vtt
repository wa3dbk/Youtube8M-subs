 zastelli 

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.310
 something 

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:35.690
 about 

00:03:51.980 --> 00:03:53.980
 but 

00:03:56.170 --> 00:03:59.170
 was 

00:04:32.760 --> 00:04:40.780
 infected when the song started 

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:42.540
 that but the guys were able to do it 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:44.800
 in its own way with humor 

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:47.320
 the only thing that dmitry is slightly 

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:49.630
 looks weaker in my opinion 

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:57.700
 but in general the performances are very cool 

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:58.930
 I wipe Constantin first of all I 

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:02.200
 should note 

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:04.590
 anatolia layer which is declared on my 

00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:07.150
 view without unconditional rod and this 

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:09.820
 groups a person who is equally this 

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:16.810
 is strong in completely different genres and 

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:21.280
 It is surprisingly wonderful 

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:24.490
 It seems to me that Grisha is reincarnating and he 

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:27.250
 Okinawa shows that a person is flexible and 

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:27.810
 in the good sense of the word ready for 

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:32.140
 everything 

00:05:27.810 --> 00:05:34.690
 that's where we are 

00:05:32.140 --> 00:05:39.520
 I see some such doubts seem to me 

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:42.330
 In general, where it has brought it whether he does 

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:45.670
 what is needed or is it not at all therefore 

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:49.270
 feeling not quite homogeneous thanks 

00:05:45.670 --> 00:05:51.070

00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:54.010

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:58.040

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:15.260

 weak link you are not afraid that here 

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:35.090

00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:37.100
