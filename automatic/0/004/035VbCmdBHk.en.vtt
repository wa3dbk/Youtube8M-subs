00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:11.670
 hello everybody here reginaldo ferreira 

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.910
 director of nautical ati and fall marini 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:16.260
 I'm recording this tip here today. 

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.020
 Paradise 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:22.590
 I'm here at the meeting of the 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:26.010
 waters where the paraná river is born 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:29.330
 it is formed by the paranaíba river that makes 

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:34.500
 border with Mato Grosso do Sul and mines 

00:00:29.330 --> 00:00:35.700
 formed by the rio grande são paulo and 

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.960
 mines 

00:00:35.700 --> 00:00:45.300
 the zero mark the reason 

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:47.430
 today after leaving the place until 

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.010
 further 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:52.020
 we did not have a lot of gas 

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:54.480
 so today 's tip is for you 

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:58.410
 mainly that it is beginner to stay 

00:00:54.480 --> 00:01:01.859
 attentive to this detail advice if you 

00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:04.860
 there is an outboard a tank 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:08.760
 separate as is a tank built into the 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:11.040
 Hulk how are the boats you carry 

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:14.549
 in case your fuel tank is 

00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:19.080
 plus a separate 10-liter flask 

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:22.350
 including two-stroke gasoline or oil 

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:25.470
 also that it will only temper there in the case of 

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:27.360
 to use because this gallon gasoline 

00:01:25.470 --> 00:01:31.170
 it will have greater durability 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:33.810
 if you do not temper it, it only happens with 

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:35.400
 your engine tank when you reach the 

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:36.780
 maximum in the middle of the tank that gives you 

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.880
 see in visual 

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.409
 You have to return to your destination. 

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:42.920
 always remembering that you have a 

00:01:40.409 --> 00:01:47.340
 reserve another 10 liters in that gallon 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:50.399
 or else if you go too far leads 

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:55.560
 two gas tanks is normally 

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:55.979
 you put 20 liters or 18 liters in the 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.009
 tank 

00:01:55.979 --> 00:02:01.560
 Are you going to leave in one way? 

00:01:59.009 --> 00:02:03.090
 the one you're going to start sailing and 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.640
 in the tank you probably will 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:08.160
 return you to fill completely with 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:09.539
 25 liters of gasoline or is over 

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.160
 that first tank you will have 

00:02:09.539 --> 00:02:13.440
 always that reserve 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:17.400
 if anything happens 

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:18.750
 the second tank in the case of speedboat 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.980
 the tanks are built-in 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:24.780
 Ideally you should use a maximum of one third 

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:26.100
 of tank capacity 

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.990
 unless you have 

00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:30.150
 transporting gasoline that is already 

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:31.950
 getting something a little riskier is 

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:35.550
 carry a larger boat you 

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:37.710
 gas in the basement, and then the 

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:39.720
 ideal and usually the boats already 

00:02:37.710 --> 00:02:41.640
 comes with a large tank 

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:44.520
 so the tip is as ideal as you are 

00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:46.290
 maximum of one third of the 

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:48.090
 tank capacity 

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:50.160
 for you to have a sufficient reserve 

00:02:48.090 --> 00:02:53.400
 to come back and this is very important 

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:55.890
 people because it is not uncommon to have 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.030
 who is adrift and for lack of 

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:59.010
 fuel 

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:01.500
 always remembering that it usually returns 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:03.990
 in the afternoon near dusk 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.040
 then it is the time that your 

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:07.560
 fuel 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:10.320
 in case you have not attempted to 

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.340
 this is what he will usually be 

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:14.130
 ending 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:15.120
 there is more this tip as always 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:17.730
 did you like it 

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:20.700
 so on my youtube channel right above 

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:22.470
 you will see not only this one as you already 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:24.420
 saw as several other 

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:25.800
 boat navigation and leave your 

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:29.450
 comment below 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:29.450
 thanks then until the next
