peanut<00:00:03.929> butter<00:00:03.990> in<00:00:04.200> a<00:00:04.440> sealed<00:00:04.890> test<00:00:05.250> tube<00:00:05.460> and

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:05.670 
peanut butter in a sealed test tube and

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:09.110 
peanut butter in a sealed test tube and
superheat<00:00:06.359> it<00:00:07.220> the<00:00:08.220> ingredients<00:00:08.519> of<00:00:09.030> this

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120 
superheat it the ingredients of this

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:13.640 
superheat it the ingredients of this
peanut<00:00:09.389> butter<00:00:09.450> are<00:00:09.889> peanuts<00:00:11.210> sugar<00:00:12.380> palm<00:00:13.380> oil

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:13.650 
peanut butter are peanuts sugar palm oil

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:18.650 
peanut butter are peanuts sugar palm oil
and<00:00:13.980> contains<00:00:14.910> 2%<00:00:15.269> or<00:00:15.900> less<00:00:15.929> of<00:00:16.410> salt<00:00:16.920> and<00:00:17.660> then

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:18.660 
and contains 2% or less of salt and then

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:21.800 
and contains 2% or less of salt and then
molasses<00:00:19.560> is<00:00:19.890> the<00:00:20.039> last<00:00:20.279> ingredient<00:00:20.660> so<00:00:21.660> what

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:21.810 
molasses is the last ingredient so what

00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.390 
molasses is the last ingredient so what
we're<00:00:21.930> doing<00:00:21.960> here<00:00:22.230> is<00:00:22.560> converting<00:00:23.039> the<00:00:23.160> heat

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
we're doing here is converting the heat

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.529 
we're doing here is converting the heat
from<00:00:23.580> the<00:00:23.730> flame<00:00:24.140> into<00:00:25.140> potential<00:00:25.980> energy

00:00:26.529 --> 00:00:26.539 
from the flame into potential energy

00:00:26.539 --> 00:00:29.439 
from the flame into potential energy
it's<00:00:27.539> kind<00:00:27.869> of<00:00:27.930> like<00:00:28.199> compressing<00:00:29.160> a<00:00:29.279> spring

00:00:29.439 --> 00:00:29.449 
it's kind of like compressing a spring

00:00:29.449 --> 00:00:32.780 
it's kind of like compressing a spring
to<00:00:30.449> the<00:00:30.570> point<00:00:30.900> where<00:00:31.520> something<00:00:32.520> just

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:32.790 
to the point where something just

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:37.010 
to the point where something just
finally<00:00:33.180> gives<00:00:34.610> the<00:00:35.610> glass<00:00:35.880> test-tube<00:00:36.540> can

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:37.020 
finally gives the glass test-tube can

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:38.450 
finally gives the glass test-tube can
only<00:00:37.260> withstand<00:00:37.500> so<00:00:37.920> much<00:00:38.070> pressure<00:00:38.340> so

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
only withstand so much pressure so

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:41.150 
only withstand so much pressure so
either<00:00:38.790> the<00:00:39.059> glass<00:00:39.750> will<00:00:40.079> break<00:00:40.290> or<00:00:40.710> rupture

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
either the glass will break or rupture

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.229 
either the glass will break or rupture
or<00:00:41.340> the<00:00:41.879> plug<00:00:42.510> will<00:00:42.750> blow<00:00:42.960> out<00:00:43.820> the<00:00:44.820> peanut

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
or the plug will blow out the peanut

several hundred degrees it can't

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.680 
several hundred degrees it can't
vaporize<00:00:50.489> because<00:00:50.910> it's<00:00:51.059> in<00:00:51.180> a<00:00:51.210> sealed

will<00:00:58.829> want<00:00:59.070> to<00:00:59.190> flash<00:00:59.940> and<00:01:00.379> expand<00:01:01.379> and

will want to flash and expand and

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:05.270 
will want to flash and expand and
vaporize<00:01:03.500> so<00:01:04.500> we're<00:01:04.619> gonna<00:01:04.710> speed<00:01:05.100> up<00:01:05.129> the
