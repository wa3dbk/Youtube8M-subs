 It's funny I though I at all forms 

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:15.569
 But it looks quite like a bucket seat 

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:17.230
 Is that gold behind the case of the Impreza 

00:04:15.569 --> 00:04:20.890

 If you look at it from inside , you can see something 

00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:01.889
 It looks like this from inside 

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:04.520
 It feels like it has already been spread 

00:05:01.889 --> 00:05:04.520
