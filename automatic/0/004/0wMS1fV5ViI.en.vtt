00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:39.670 
through those so starting off with a
little<00:05:10.199> bit<00:05:10.320> of<00:05:10.500> a<00:05:10.590> bridge<00:05:10.770> kind<00:05:11.070> of<00:05:11.190> stuff

little<00:06:05.080> bit<00:06:05.260> let's<00:06:05.500> see<00:06:05.650> how<00:06:05.740> that<00:06:05.890> sounds<00:06:13.260> so

00:06:14.250 --> 00:06:14.260 
little bit let's see how that sounds so

00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:15.630 
little bit let's see how that sounds so
you<00:06:14.350> can<00:06:14.380> hear<00:06:14.530> it<00:06:14.800> kind<00:06:14.950> of<00:06:15.100> keeps<00:06:15.400> its

00:06:15.630 --> 00:06:15.640 
you can hear it kind of keeps its

00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:17.700 
you can hear it kind of keeps its
tightness<00:06:16.180> but<00:06:16.510> sort<00:06:16.960> of<00:06:17.020> the<00:06:17.080> tops<00:06:17.440> come
