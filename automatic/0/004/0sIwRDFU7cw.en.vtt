00:00:37.639 --> 00:00:37.649

00:00:40.819 --> 00:00:40.829 
impossible because every game just has

00:00:40.829 --> 00:00:43.069 
impossible because every game just has
either<00:00:40.980> a<00:00:41.100> good<00:00:41.430> feel<00:00:41.700> to<00:00:41.730> it<00:00:41.940> or<00:00:42.239> you<00:00:42.960> know<00:00:43.050> a

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
either a good feel to it or you know a

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:44.690 
either a good feel to it or you know a
bad<00:00:43.379> feel<00:00:43.770> and<00:00:44.070> everyone<00:00:44.370> has<00:00:44.520> their<00:00:44.670> own

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:44.700 
bad feel and everyone has their own

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.490 
bad feel and everyone has their own
opinion<00:00:44.789> I<00:00:45.239> mean<00:00:45.390> I<00:00:45.420> might<00:00:45.690> like<00:00:45.960> a<00:00:45.989> game<00:00:46.289> you

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:48.390 
might dislike a game but until you

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:50.240 
might dislike a game but until you
actually<00:00:48.420> play<00:00:49.140> it<00:00:49.289> it<00:00:49.410> is<00:00:49.559> pretty<00:00:49.770> hard<00:00:50.070> to

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 
actually play it it is pretty hard to

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.580

for a lot of people who have been
playing<00:01:46.290> call<00:01:46.530> of<00:01:46.560> duty<00:01:46.680> for<00:01:47.070> a<00:01:47.100> very<00:01:47.340> very

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
playing call of duty for a very very

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.639 
playing call of duty for a very very
long<00:01:47.729> time<00:01:47.939> they<00:01:48.509> do<00:01:48.570> want<00:01:48.990> change<00:01:49.320> and<00:01:49.560> we've

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649 
long time they do want change and we've

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.530 
long time they do want change and we've
always<00:01:49.890> been<00:01:50.220> asking<00:01:50.759> for<00:01:50.939> change<00:01:51.180> or<00:01:51.360> a<00:01:51.390> lot

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
always been asking for change or a lot

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:53.780 
always been asking for change or a lot
of<00:01:51.659> us<00:01:51.750> have<00:01:51.960> and<00:01:52.259> you<00:01:53.100> know<00:01:53.130> I'm<00:01:53.399> a<00:01:53.430> little<00:01:53.610> bit

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
of us have and you know I'm a little bit

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.580 
of us have and you know I'm a little bit
nervous<00:01:53.939> because<00:01:54.270> they<00:01:54.659> finally<00:01:55.170> gave<00:01:55.380> us

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:55.590 
nervous because they finally gave us

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.109 
nervous because they finally gave us
change<00:01:55.950> and<00:01:56.280> I<00:01:56.340> think<00:01:56.640> they<00:01:56.759> might<00:01:56.939> get<00:01:57.060> a

00:01:57.109 --> 00:01:57.119 
change and I think they might get a

00:01:57.119 --> 00:01:58.490 
change and I think they might get a
little<00:01:57.299> bit<00:01:57.479> of<00:01:57.509> hate<00:01:57.750> for<00:01:57.930> that<00:01:58.049> because<00:01:58.259> you

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:58.500 
little bit of hate for that because you

00:01:58.500 --> 00:01:59.990 
little bit of hate for that because you
know<00:01:58.530> some<00:01:58.829> people<00:01:59.070> don't<00:01:59.100> like<00:01:59.340> change<00:01:59.670> some

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
know some people don't like change some

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:02.420 
know some people don't like change some
people<00:02:00.240> do<00:02:00.420> but<00:02:00.990> for<00:02:01.170> myself<00:02:01.290> I<00:02:01.649> am<00:02:01.890> excited

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:02.430 
people do but for myself I am excited

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.219 
people do but for myself I am excited
about<00:02:02.490> this<00:02:02.880> change<00:02:03.119> I<00:02:03.329> don't<00:02:03.630> think<00:02:04.049> this

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:04.229 
about this change I don't think this

00:02:04.229 --> 00:02:06.410 
about this change I don't think this
change<00:02:04.590> will<00:02:04.860> be<00:02:05.040> bad<00:02:05.250> if<00:02:05.939> you<00:02:06.090> guys<00:02:06.240> have

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:06.420 
change will be bad if you guys have

00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:08.389 
change will be bad if you guys have
played<00:02:06.570> titanfall<00:02:07.049> of<00:02:07.320> the<00:02:07.439> jumping<00:02:08.009> and<00:02:08.190> that

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:33.670 
wondering what I think about that now

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:35.610 
wondering what I think about that now
this<00:02:33.940> is<00:02:34.150> almost<00:02:34.540> impossible<00:02:34.750> to<00:02:35.290> talk<00:02:35.440> about

00:02:35.610 --> 00:02:35.620 
this is almost impossible to talk about

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:38.520 
this is almost impossible to talk about
until<00:02:36.010> we<00:02:36.100> actually<00:02:36.280> play<00:02:36.730> it<00:02:36.880> um<00:02:37.120> it's<00:02:38.080> hard

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.530 
until we actually play it um it's hard

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:40.680 
until we actually play it um it's hard
to<00:02:38.650> say<00:02:38.860> i'm<00:02:39.100> hoping<00:02:39.850> trickshotting<00:02:40.540> is

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:40.690 
to say i'm hoping trickshotting is

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:41.880 
to say i'm hoping trickshotting is
pretty<00:02:40.870> good<00:02:41.020> in<00:02:41.140> this<00:02:41.230> game<00:02:41.440> because<00:02:41.590> there

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:41.890 
pretty good in this game because there

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:44.730 
pretty good in this game because there

for the game without playing and it's
very<00:04:11.890> challenging<00:04:12.130> to<00:04:12.550> tell<00:04:12.820> but<00:04:13.390> I<00:04:13.810> honestly

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:14.440 
very challenging to tell but I honestly

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:16.949 
very challenging to tell but I honestly
think<00:04:14.650> it's<00:04:14.770> gonna<00:04:14.950> be<00:04:15.010> a<00:04:15.160> good<00:04:15.400> game<00:04:15.610> um<00:04:15.959> but

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:16.959 
think it's gonna be a good game um but

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:19.320 
think it's gonna be a good game um but
again<00:04:17.230> it<00:04:17.680> is<00:04:17.830> very<00:04:18.160> very<00:04:18.250> hard<00:04:18.760> to<00:04:18.880> tell<00:04:19.090> this

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:19.330 
again it is very very hard to tell this

00:04:19.330 --> 00:04:21.420 
again it is very very hard to tell this
early<00:04:19.810> when<00:04:19.959> we've<00:04:20.080> only<00:04:20.230> seen<00:04:20.560> a<00:04:20.620> trailer<00:04:20.980> but

00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:21.430 
early when we've only seen a trailer but

00:04:21.430 --> 00:04:25.240 
early when we've only seen a trailer but
it<00:04:22.000> does<00:04:22.419> look<00:04:22.450> cool<00:04:22.990> it<00:04:23.320> it<00:04:24.070> does<00:04:24.490> look<00:04:24.520> crazy

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:25.250 
it does look cool it it does look crazy

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:27.190 
it does look cool it it does look crazy
