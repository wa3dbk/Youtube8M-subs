00:00:00.629 --> 00:00:03.629
 In the coming four days, den bos will be dominated by equestrian sports 

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:09.590
 in the brabanthal the child for the 41st time indoor brabant place the participants 

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:13.150
 jumping and dressage championships were already busy today 

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:14.009
 train 

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:17.939
 the final of the dressage world championships takes place on Saturday afternoon 

00:00:17.939 --> 00:00:21.029
 That was very exciting because we all know how to get the advance 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:22.329
 Olympic Games 

00:00:22.329 --> 00:00:25.299
 we all have top but still several people actually want to be here 

00:00:25.299 --> 00:00:25.869
 to win 

00:00:25.869 --> 00:00:30.089
 to issue a permanent calling card for what the Hong Kong ultimately is because 

00:00:30.089 --> 00:00:32.250
 pair the canon queen the quake 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:33.630
 and so to there 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.520
 we are definitely at the forefront 

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:39.200
 It is also interesting for horsemen to trot up in the woods 

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:40.010
 but Merelbeke 

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:43.840
 final in den bosch is always something special, we notice the four audiences 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:44.430
 here 

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:49.020
 and they are real horse people so the top of the dressage riders contraband 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.170
 forest to ride a world cup final here you can name a few 

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.590
 but of course the richest are happily a crack of a percent 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.120
 because that is our classic favorite, but imke schellekens 

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:04.000
 Bartels is also great on the road to ride in the medals 

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.850
 And the big rival is it you choose to see German again always in den 

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:11.090
 bosch is his media will definitely try to ride like the one once 

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:15.360
 one of the Dutch participants in the newspaper trud morals ii 

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:16.700
 toughest classic test 

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.280
 is alex from silfhout 

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:22.340
 with his horse drugs being considerably less capable of being 28th in the world ranking 

00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:24.480
 Products 

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:25.680
 year before 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.560
 I think about forty 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:29.470
 40 45 

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:32.280
 it's really not easy scores 

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:35.280
 Statements from childhood actually had it go with this 

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:38.780
 that is very nice about it 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:42.160
 dealing with animals and you can always improve this 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:46.470
 and if you have good things about it if you are a few times too mediocre but the 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:49.860
 way of speaking then you can always improve something so that it still 

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:50.610
 again 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.610
 it still comes out better 

00:01:54.430 --> 00:01:55.150
 the wood fascinating
