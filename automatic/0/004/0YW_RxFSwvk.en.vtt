the box right there as you can see these
a<00:00:41.640> little<00:00:42.270> bit<00:00:42.420> of<00:00:42.540> history<00:00:42.899> on<00:00:42.989> these<00:00:43.170> these

00:00:43.459 --> 00:00:43.469 
a little bit of history on these these

00:00:43.469 --> 00:00:47.240 
a little bit of history on these these
were<00:00:43.620> the<00:00:43.800> first<00:00:44.070> coaches<00:00:44.960> made<00:00:45.960> of<00:00:46.500> basically

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
were the first coaches made of basically

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.430 
were the first coaches made of basically
majority<00:00:47.760> of<00:00:47.850> it<00:00:48.030> was<00:00:48.210> plastic<00:00:48.899> rather<00:00:49.110> than

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:49.440 
majority of it was plastic rather than

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.220 
majority of it was plastic rather than
wood<00:00:50.030> so<00:00:51.030> that's<00:00:51.210> kind<00:00:51.449> of<00:00:51.480> interesting<00:00:51.629> to

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
wood so that's kind of interesting to

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:55.610 
wood so that's kind of interesting to
know<00:00:52.430> which<00:00:53.430> is<00:00:53.579> not<00:00:54.320> necessarily<00:00:55.320> like<00:00:55.559> but

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:55.620 
know which is not necessarily like but

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.020 
know which is not necessarily like but
for<00:00:55.829> these<00:00:56.100> models<00:00:56.430> they<00:00:56.610> were<00:00:56.670> just<00:00:56.879> very

00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:57.030 
for these models they were just very

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.819 
for these models they were just very
interesting<00:00:57.629> you<00:00:57.719> know<00:00:57.809> I<00:00:57.840> think<00:00:57.989> bass<00:00:58.469> is<00:00:58.710> the

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
interesting you know I think bass is the

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:00.740 
interesting you know I think bass is the
only<00:00:59.129> part<00:00:59.399> that's<00:00:59.460> wood<00:01:00.000> on<00:01:00.239> here<00:01:00.539> that<00:01:00.570> you

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750 
only part that's wood on here that you

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:02.660 
only part that's wood on here that you

first<00:03:36.830> year<00:03:37.130> let<00:03:37.430> me<00:03:37.520> see<00:03:37.610> if<00:03:37.700> I<00:03:37.730> can<00:03:37.880> zoom<00:03:38.030> in

00:03:38.229 --> 00:03:38.239 
first year let me see if I can zoom in

00:03:38.239 --> 00:03:40.960 
first year let me see if I can zoom in
yeah<00:03:38.570> cuz<00:03:38.870> these<00:03:39.020> are<00:03:39.170> dated<00:03:39.440> 97<00:03:40.430> the<00:03:40.730> box

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:40.970 
yeah cuz these are dated 97 the box

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:43.600 
yeah cuz these are dated 97 the box
which<00:03:41.180> is<00:03:41.209> the<00:03:41.450> first<00:03:41.690> year<00:03:41.900> but<00:03:42.560> um<00:03:42.830> the<00:03:43.400> first

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:43.610 
which is the first year but um the first

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:45.550 
which is the first year but um the first
year<00:03:43.850> that<00:03:43.880> a<00:03:44.360> lot<00:03:44.630> of<00:03:44.720> people<00:03:44.930> would<00:03:45.140> go<00:03:45.290> off

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:45.560 
year that a lot of people would go off

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:46.720 
year that a lot of people would go off
of<00:03:45.770> and<00:03:45.890> sorry<00:03:46.070> you<00:03:46.220> probably<00:03:46.250> can't<00:03:46.610> read

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:46.730 
of and sorry you probably can't read

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:49.360 
of and sorry you probably can't read
that's<00:03:46.910> kind<00:03:47.090> of<00:03:47.120> blurry<00:03:47.300> is<00:03:47.510> the<00:03:48.370> catalog

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.370 
that's kind of blurry is the catalog

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:51.070 
that's kind of blurry is the catalog
date<00:03:49.670> and<00:03:49.910> I<00:03:49.970> think<00:03:50.209> these<00:03:50.360> were<00:03:50.540> issued<00:03:50.930> as

00:03:51.070 --> 00:03:51.080 
date and I think these were issued as

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:54.550 
date and I think these were issued as
new<00:03:51.320> and<00:03:51.620> the<00:03:52.070> 1998<00:03:52.760> catalog<00:03:53.420> so<00:03:53.780> that's<00:03:54.410> how<00:03:54.530> a

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:54.560 
new and the 1998 catalog so that's how a

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:56.050 
new and the 1998 catalog so that's how a
lot<00:03:54.770> of<00:03:54.800> the<00:03:55.010> collectors<00:03:55.310> would<00:03:55.610> say<00:03:55.820> even

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:56.060 
lot of the collectors would say even

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:59.620 
lot of the collectors would say even
though<00:03:56.239> the<00:03:56.360> box<00:03:56.540> is<00:03:56.750> dated<00:03:57.020> 97<00:03:58.120> the<00:03:59.120> actual

00:03:59.620 --> 00:03:59.630 
though the box is dated 97 the actual

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:01.810 
though the box is dated 97 the actual
trains<00:04:00.470> were<00:04:00.709> released<00:04:01.070> in<00:04:01.310> the<00:04:01.430> fiscal<00:04:01.760> year

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:01.820 
trains were released in the fiscal year

00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:03.820 
trains were released in the fiscal year
of<00:04:01.940> 98<00:04:02.420> so<00:04:02.870> that's<00:04:03.230> kind<00:04:03.470> of<00:04:03.500> how<00:04:03.620> that<00:04:03.650> works

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:03.830 
of 98 so that's kind of how that works

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:06.610 
of 98 so that's kind of how that works

00:04:28.159 --> 00:04:28.169 
I guess as a kid I thought they were

00:04:28.169 --> 00:04:29.689 
I guess as a kid I thought they were
kind<00:04:28.380> of<00:04:28.410> cool<00:04:28.560> as<00:04:28.740> a<00:04:28.830> kid<00:04:29.010> I<00:04:29.040> never<00:04:29.310> did<00:04:29.550> own
