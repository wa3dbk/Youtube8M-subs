flour cake flour is a lot lighter and

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:56.550 
flour cake flour is a lot lighter and
then<00:01:54.100> I'm<00:01:54.580> going<00:01:54.850> to<00:01:54.970> put<00:01:55.540> 1/2<00:01:56.050> a<00:01:56.200> cup<00:01:56.350> of<00:01:56.410> sugar

flour sifted together now this is the
next<00:02:00.670> most<00:02:01.180> important<00:02:01.810> step<00:02:02.050> this<00:02:02.410> is<00:02:02.470> the<00:02:02.680> one

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950 
next most important step this is the one

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:06.240 
next most important step this is the one
that<00:02:03.160> always<00:02:03.850> is<00:02:04.180> a<00:02:04.210> little<00:02:04.570> bit<00:02:04.720> intimidating

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:06.250

we have dozen eggs between you left on
that<00:02:08.710> move<00:02:08.920> temperature<00:02:09.580> because<00:02:10.390> it's

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:10.570 
that move temperature because it's

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:12.000 
that move temperature because it's
important<00:02:11.200> to<00:02:11.290> get<00:02:11.410> them<00:02:11.650> to<00:02:11.830> room

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.010 
important to get them to room

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:14.040

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390 
between do it with temperature so what's

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:21.660 
between do it with temperature so what's
our<00:02:19.540> next<00:02:19.720> step<00:02:20.290> the<00:02:20.830> next<00:02:20.860> step<00:02:21.190> is<00:02:21.490> we're

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:21.670 
our next step the next step is we're

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:24.380 
our next step the next step is we're
going<00:02:21.880> to<00:02:22.000> beat<00:02:22.240> the<00:02:22.450> egg<00:02:22.630> whites<00:02:22.960> okay<00:02:23.710> and<00:02:24.040> so

we're going to beat the egg whites for

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:41.240 
we're going to beat the egg whites for
about<00:02:28.240> one<00:02:28.480> minute

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:41.250 

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.670 

okay<00:02:41.460> next<00:02:42.030> thing<00:02:42.240> we're<00:02:42.420> going<00:02:42.660> to<00:02:42.780> do<00:02:43.050> is<00:02:43.320> it
