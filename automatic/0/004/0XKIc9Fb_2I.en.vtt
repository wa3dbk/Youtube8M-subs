00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.960
 very good girls very good guys 

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:06.450
 feed what are you waiting for 

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:10.099
 you are all very well today is comment 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:13.860
 concise brief news but about 

00:00:10.099 --> 00:00:16.020
 underground cities really exist 

00:00:13.860 --> 00:00:19.700
 have really existed for example from the 

00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:23.800
 World War II were created 

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:28.760
 underground cities to be able to like 

00:00:23.800 --> 00:00:31.460
 say it protect yourself from those attacks today 

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:34.100
 they have found a city 

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:36.110
 underground other than what I said is 

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:39.430
 just wanted to put an example of 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:42.800
 that there are underground cities 

00:00:39.430 --> 00:00:45.660
 secret in the caves of it now in 

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:49.079
 India turns out that 

00:00:45.660 --> 00:00:52.710
 when the investigating guys have gone 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:55.080
 to this population in india have 

00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:58.080
 found solid evidence and that there 

00:00:55.080 --> 00:01:01.200
 a hidden underground space hidden in 

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:02.910
 those caves have commented that there is a 

00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:05.210
 tunnel more than 40 feet deep 

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:08.640
 which gives a right angle angle turn 

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:10.560
 to advance to the subsoil no one knows what 

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:14.190
 is inside 

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:17.670
 after that because it turns out that tudela 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:20.040
 it narrows and it is impossible for beings 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.410
 humans can pass through it there are 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:23.940
 a small rectangular opening and what 

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:26.119
 who comment is that there are openings 

00:01:23.940 --> 00:01:29.409
 rectangular only big enough 

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:32.200
 for a 10- year-old boy to enter 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:33.969
 since humans to beings 

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:36.310
 human adults out there can not 

00:01:33.969 --> 00:01:39.670
 accede but neither of coña 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:41.320
 but what they ask us now what 

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:44.409
 they ask here is it really was 

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:48.070
 designed for humans 

00:01:44.409 --> 00:01:50.470
 they always take out that little bottle 

00:01:48.070 --> 00:01:52.869
 they also comment that there is another passage 

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:55.659
 hidden in these caves that moves 

00:01:52.869 --> 00:01:59.020
 So narrow that you can not go anymore 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:02:01.720
 away and they throw the question of 

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:04.179
 where these tunnels lead who has 

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:06.789
 could use these passages because what 

00:02:04.179 --> 00:02:11.080
 what they say is that they are like 

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:14.110
 like the earth like it's brown 

00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:16.540
 that people have passed by you know that 

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:18.910
 when you spend many times on a path 

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:20.100
 For example, it is a road with 

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:22.980
 grass 

00:02:20.100 --> 00:02:25.350
 that herb is going to be treated and he arrives 

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.390
 a moment where you spend that 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:30.270
 grass no longer grows or by in the past 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:32.190
 so many times that grass does not grow anymore 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:33.780
 more or less is this but with the 

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:36.090
 direction of the earth when you think 

00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:39.210
 of some land is often pressed 

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:42.360
 and it shows that you have gone through another 

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:45.750
 question they raise is how can they 

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:48.060
 dig such tight passages if 

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:52.080
 in humans they can not even 

00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:54.630
 pass through them here I leave you to 

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:57.540
 the description a video in which then 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:03:00.930
 lasts 10 minutes 19 minutes heme here 

00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:03.810
 there that they comment on about the small 

00:03:00.930 --> 00:03:07.710
 city ​​that is below him hour of 

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:09.960
 cry and I do not know how to look for you 

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:12.060
 feet to the cat 

00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:13.950
 I sent you this news because many 

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:18.180
 Sometimes I think 

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:20.280
 and it makes me a little bit like a 

00:03:18.180 --> 00:03:22.500
 little bit beyond you part times me 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:27.260
 has become totally skeptical there 

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:30.090
 tunnels there are cities as they call 

00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:31.739
 underground cities that have really 

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:34.200
 been created or by the erosion of 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:36.390
 water or else anything has not 

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:39.450
 been need labor work 

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:43.780
 of man or manpower of others 

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:47.079
 galaxies, but I leave the video 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:48.870
 I'm interested in the report, it's great if 

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:52.530
 is in English 

00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:54.330
 is an important fact and I hope that it 

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:56.220
 have interested this news a little kiss to 

00:03:54.330 --> 00:04:00.140
 everyone and see you in other languages of 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:00.140
 this channel until the next ciao
