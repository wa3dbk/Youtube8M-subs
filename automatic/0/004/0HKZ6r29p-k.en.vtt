00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:03.750 
okay just thought I'd show a quick piece

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:05.960 
okay just thought I'd show a quick piece
of<00:00:03.899> video<00:00:04.110> it's<00:00:05.009> currently<00:00:05.339> making<00:00:05.670> the<00:00:05.730> mold

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:05.970 
of video it's currently making the mold

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.440 
of video it's currently making the mold
for<00:00:06.509> the<00:00:06.750> embryo<00:00:07.230> and<00:00:08.000> as<00:00:09.000> you<00:00:09.090> can<00:00:09.179> see<00:00:09.330> the

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.450 
for the embryo and as you can see the

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:11.690 
for the embryo and as you can see the
sculpture<00:00:09.809> has<00:00:09.929> a<00:00:09.990> clay<00:00:10.469> wall<00:00:10.769> around<00:00:11.550> the

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
sculpture has a clay wall around the

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:14.419 
sculpture has a clay wall around the
exterior<00:00:12.500> the<00:00:13.500> other<00:00:13.650> desert<00:00:13.950> is<00:00:14.070> to<00:00:14.190> provide

00:00:14.419 --> 00:00:14.429 
exterior the other desert is to provide

00:00:14.429 --> 00:00:16.220 
exterior the other desert is to provide
a<00:00:14.490> year<00:00:14.849> separation<00:00:15.389> for<00:00:15.630> the<00:00:15.690> two<00:00:15.809> halves<00:00:16.109> of

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230 
a year separation for the two halves of

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:17.510 
a year separation for the two halves of
the<00:00:16.289> mold<00:00:16.350> and<00:00:16.740> be<00:00:16.890> one<00:00:17.039> on<00:00:17.100> the<00:00:17.160> front<00:00:17.369> and<00:00:17.460> one

00:00:17.510 --> 00:00:17.520 
the mold and be one on the front and one

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.029 
the mold and be one on the front and one
on<00:00:17.609> the<00:00:17.699> back<00:00:18.140> as<00:00:19.140> you<00:00:19.199> can<00:00:19.320> see<00:00:19.470> up<00:00:19.560> here<00:00:19.590> I'm

00:00:20.029 --> 00:00:20.039 
on the back as you can see up here I'm

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.060 
on the back as you can see up here I'm
just<00:00:20.220> doing<00:00:20.609> a<00:00:20.640> bit<00:00:20.760> of<00:00:20.820> a<00:00:20.880> test<00:00:21.119> this<00:00:21.990> new<00:00:22.289> fix

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:23.070 
just doing a bit of a test this new fix

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:25.250 
just doing a bit of a test this new fix
of<00:00:23.189> tropic<00:00:23.490> risen<00:00:24.060> paste<00:00:24.359> as<00:00:24.840> it's<00:00:25.019> called

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260 
of tropic risen paste as it's called

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:26.390 
of tropic risen paste as it's called
it's<00:00:25.439> just<00:00:25.560> basically<00:00:25.769> just<00:00:25.980> quite<00:00:26.160> a<00:00:26.189> thick

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:26.400 
it's just basically just quite a thick

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:27.859 
it's just basically just quite a thick
resin<00:00:26.849> that<00:00:26.910> you<00:00:27.029> can<00:00:27.150> paste<00:00:27.359> over<00:00:27.660> the<00:00:27.750> ear

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:27.869 
resin that you can paste over the ear

00:00:27.869 --> 00:00:30.740 
resin that you can paste over the ear
model<00:00:28.640> when<00:00:29.640> it's<00:00:29.789> hard<00:00:29.970> not<00:00:30.179> sick<00:00:30.390> gives<00:00:30.599> the

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750 
model when it's hard not sick gives the

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:37.970 
model when it's hard not sick gives the
impression<00:00:30.960> of<00:00:31.380> the<00:00:32.189> sculpture<00:00:36.920> okay<00:00:37.920> so

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
impression of the sculpture okay so

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.100 
impression of the sculpture okay so
we're<00:00:38.250> just<00:00:38.280> applying<00:00:38.610> the<00:00:38.910> arising<00:00:39.390> coating

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.110 
we're just applying the arising coating

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:42.709 
we're just applying the arising coating
here<00:00:40.230> with<00:00:40.350> a<00:00:40.410> brush<00:00:41.000> and<00:00:42.000> just<00:00:42.180> making<00:00:42.540> sure

00:00:42.709 --> 00:00:42.719 
here with a brush and just making sure

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.250 
here with a brush and just making sure
that<00:00:42.750> it's<00:00:42.989> kind<00:00:43.230> of<00:00:43.290> good<00:00:43.440> I<00:00:43.469> even<00:00:44.570> layer<00:00:45.570> over

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:46.260 
that it's kind of good I even layer over

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:49.750 
that it's kind of good I even layer over
all<00:00:46.350> of<00:00:46.530> the<00:00:46.649> sculpture

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:49.760 

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.740 

okay<00:00:50.760> so<00:00:50.820> we've<00:00:51.270> now<00:00:51.449> applied<00:00:52.050> the<00:00:52.829> layout<00:00:53.460> of

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:53.750 
okay so we've now applied the layout of

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:56.630 
okay so we've now applied the layout of
gel<00:00:54.750> missing<00:00:55.199> after<00:00:55.620> there<00:00:55.980> it<00:00:56.160> is<00:00:56.309> nice<00:00:56.489> and

00:00:56.630 --> 00:00:56.640 
gel missing after there it is nice and

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.549 
gel missing after there it is nice and
hot<00:00:56.850> well<00:00:57.270> now<00:00:57.449> doing<00:00:57.780> is<00:00:57.870> laminating<00:00:58.469> the

00:00:58.549 --> 00:00:58.559 
hot well now doing is laminating the

00:00:58.559 --> 00:01:00.410 
hot well now doing is laminating the
whole<00:00:58.710> thing<00:00:58.980> with<00:00:59.160> some<00:00:59.340> glass<00:00:59.579> fiber<00:01:00.000> and

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
whole thing with some glass fiber and

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:01.760 
whole thing with some glass fiber and
all<00:01:00.570> that<00:01:00.719> involves<00:01:01.109> is<00:01:01.230> pretty<00:01:01.469> good<00:01:01.590> fire

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:01.770 
all that involves is pretty good fire

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.369 
all that involves is pretty good fire
going<00:01:01.800> like<00:01:02.100> that<00:01:02.129> then<00:01:03.120> giving<00:01:04.019> in<00:01:04.110> a<00:01:04.170> layer

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:04.379 
going like that then giving in a layer

00:01:04.379 --> 00:01:11.780 
going like that then giving in a layer
of<00:01:04.769> Britain<00:01:07.880> now<00:01:08.880> what<00:01:09.180> happens<00:01:09.510> is<00:01:09.689> the<00:01:10.790> resin

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
of Britain now what happens is the resin

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.760 
of Britain now what happens is the resin
climate<00:01:12.180> dissolves<00:01:12.720> the<00:01:13.939> glass<00:01:14.939> fiber<00:01:15.619> and<00:01:16.619> it

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:16.770 
climate dissolves the glass fiber and it

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.260 
climate dissolves the glass fiber and it
become<00:01:16.950> a<00:01:16.979> little<00:01:17.070> quite<00:01:17.280> a<00:01:17.310> gooey<00:01:17.610> is<00:01:17.970> into

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
become a little quite a gooey is into

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.030 
become a little quite a gooey is into
down<00:01:18.479> there<00:01:18.689> and<00:01:19.680> that'll<00:01:19.890> eventually

00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:20.040 
down there and that'll eventually

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.520 
down there and that'll eventually
hardened<00:01:20.580> into<00:01:20.759> a<00:01:20.939> nice<00:01:21.689> hard<00:01:21.960> case<00:01:22.259> which

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:22.530 
hardened into a nice hard case which

00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:25.249 
hardened into a nice hard case which
will<00:01:22.650> give<00:01:22.770> support<00:01:22.920> to<00:01:23.250> the<00:01:23.900> to<00:01:24.900> the<00:01:25.020> way<00:01:25.140> I've

00:01:25.249 --> 00:01:25.259 
will give support to the to the way I've

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:28.730 
will give support to the to the way I've
sorted<00:01:25.619> on<00:01:25.680> there<00:01:27.200> okay<00:01:28.200> so<00:01:28.470> as<00:01:28.530> you<00:01:28.560> can<00:01:28.619> see

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
sorted on there okay so as you can see

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.460 
sorted on there okay so as you can see
over<00:01:29.070> now<00:01:29.520> to<00:01:29.579> turn<00:01:29.850> the<00:01:30.030> sculpture<00:01:30.540> over<00:01:30.810> and

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:31.470 
over now to turn the sculpture over and

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.740 
over now to turn the sculpture over and
I'm<00:01:31.680> just<00:01:31.829> removing<00:01:32.189> the<00:01:32.549> clay<00:01:32.820> wall<00:01:33.119> which<00:01:33.509> we

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:33.750 
I'm just removing the clay wall which we

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.510 
I'm just removing the clay wall which we
originally<00:01:34.320> added<00:01:35.060> to<00:01:36.060> reveal<00:01:36.360> the<00:01:36.630> resin

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:37.520 
originally added to reveal the resin

00:01:37.520 --> 00:01:40.999 
originally added to reveal the resin
case<00:01:38.930> okay<00:01:39.930> so<00:01:39.990> we've<00:01:40.200> now<00:01:40.320> cleaned<00:01:40.740> off<00:01:40.950> the

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009 
case okay so we've now cleaned off the

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:41.899 
case okay so we've now cleaned off the
clay<00:01:41.400> wall

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
clay wall

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:44.060 
clay wall
as<00:01:42.509> you<00:01:42.630> can<00:01:42.689> see<00:01:42.810> can<00:01:42.960> now<00:01:43.049> see<00:01:43.110> leave<00:01:43.380> back<00:01:43.920> at

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:44.070 
as you can see can now see leave back at

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.850 
as you can see can now see leave back at
the<00:01:44.159> fiberglass<00:01:44.520> case<00:01:45.380> what<00:01:46.380> we're<00:01:46.500> gonna<00:01:46.619> do

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:46.860 
the fiberglass case what we're gonna do

00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.999 
the fiberglass case what we're gonna do
now<00:01:47.159> is<00:01:47.189> actually<00:01:47.790> take<00:01:48.360> some<00:01:48.689> Vaseline<00:01:49.560> and

00:01:49.999 --> 00:01:50.009 
now is actually take some Vaseline and

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:54.109 
now is actually take some Vaseline and
apply<00:01:50.340> that<00:01:50.369> to<00:01:50.909> the<00:01:51.750> edges<00:01:52.229> of<00:01:52.259> case<00:01:52.939> and<00:01:53.939> what

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
apply that to the edges of case and what

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.389 
apply that to the edges of case and what
this<00:01:54.240> does<00:01:54.450> is<00:01:54.750> act<00:01:55.020> as<00:01:55.259> AI<00:01:55.409> separating<00:01:55.979> agents

00:01:56.389 --> 00:01:56.399 
this does is act as AI separating agents

00:01:56.399 --> 00:01:58.160 
this does is act as AI separating agents
this<00:01:56.939> will<00:01:57.149> just<00:01:57.329> stop<00:01:57.630> the<00:01:57.750> two<00:01:57.899> sides

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
this will just stop the two sides

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.709 
this will just stop the two sides
sticking<00:01:58.619> together<00:01:58.770> and<00:01:59.420> give<00:02:00.420> us<00:02:00.509> a

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719 
sticking together and give us a

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:02.359 
sticking together and give us a
two-piece<00:02:01.290> mold<00:02:01.320> and<00:02:01.680> we<00:02:01.740> can<00:02:01.860> then<00:02:01.950> put<00:02:02.100> part

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:02.369 
two-piece mold and we can then put part

00:02:02.369 --> 00:02:04.660 
two-piece mold and we can then put part
and<00:02:02.610> fill<00:02:03.119> with<00:02:03.329> silicon

00:02:04.660 --> 00:02:04.670 
and fill with silicon

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.969 
and fill with silicon
okay<00:02:05.670> so<00:02:05.729> we've<00:02:05.969> now<00:02:06.060> added<00:02:06.270> a<00:02:06.540> layer<00:02:06.810> of<00:02:06.990> fixed

00:02:07.969 --> 00:02:07.979 
okay so we've now added a layer of fixed

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:10.100 
okay so we've now added a layer of fixed
tropic<00:02:08.280> resin<00:02:08.610> to<00:02:08.729> the<00:02:08.849> back<00:02:09.060> of<00:02:09.360> the<00:02:09.629> Mont

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:10.110 
tropic resin to the back of the Mont

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.960 
tropic resin to the back of the Mont
which<00:02:10.770> is<00:02:10.950> now<00:02:11.129> nice<00:02:11.700> and<00:02:11.940> hard

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:12.970 
which is now nice and hard

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:15.180 
which is now nice and hard
and<00:02:13.150> what<00:02:14.020> we're<00:02:14.170> going<00:02:14.290> to<00:02:14.350> do<00:02:14.530> now<00:02:14.770> is<00:02:14.980> we're

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.190 
and what we're going to do now is we're

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:16.920 
and what we're going to do now is we're
just<00:02:15.340> preparing<00:02:15.490> to<00:02:16.180> laminate<00:02:16.660> the<00:02:16.720> whole

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:16.930 
just preparing to laminate the whole

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:18.600 
just preparing to laminate the whole
thing<00:02:17.200> with<00:02:17.410> some<00:02:17.590> more<00:02:17.740> glass<00:02:17.950> fiber<00:02:18.250> to<00:02:18.460> give

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:18.610 
thing with some more glass fiber to give

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:22.950 
thing with some more glass fiber to give
a<00:02:18.700> bit<00:02:18.850> of<00:02:18.880> strength<00:02:21.540> okay<00:02:22.540> so<00:02:22.600> we<00:02:22.780> now<00:02:22.840> have<00:02:22.930> a

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:22.960 
a bit of strength okay so we now have a

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:26.370 
a bit of strength okay so we now have a
finished<00:02:23.200> mold<00:02:24.150> both<00:02:25.150> halves<00:02:25.480> there's<00:02:26.260> the

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:26.380 
finished mold both halves there's the

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:28.770 
finished mold both halves there's the
back<00:02:26.530> off<00:02:26.740> and<00:02:27.730> I've<00:02:28.030> just<00:02:28.180> cleaned<00:02:28.420> the<00:02:28.540> edges

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:28.780 
back off and I've just cleaned the edges

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:30.930 
back off and I've just cleaned the edges
up<00:02:28.930> slightly<00:02:29.200> with<00:02:29.320> a<00:02:29.440> dremel<00:02:29.710> you<00:02:30.640> do<00:02:30.790> get

00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:30.940 
up slightly with a dremel you do get

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.120 
up slightly with a dremel you do get
requests<00:02:31.390> sharp<00:02:32.080> spikes<00:02:32.500> sometimes<00:02:32.950> where

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:33.130 
requests sharp spikes sometimes where

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:34.740 
requests sharp spikes sometimes where
there<00:02:33.220> isn't<00:02:33.370> now<00:02:33.910> I<00:02:33.940> want<00:02:34.150> to<00:02:34.210> try<00:02:34.360> and<00:02:34.480> do<00:02:34.570> now

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:34.750 
there isn't now I want to try and do now

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:36.180 
there isn't now I want to try and do now
is<00:02:34.930> literally<00:02:35.200> just<00:02:35.260> crack<00:02:35.560> it<00:02:35.590> open<00:02:35.800> and<00:02:36.130> that

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:36.190 
is literally just crack it open and that

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:37.620 
is literally just crack it open and that
really<00:02:36.400> involves<00:02:36.640> just<00:02:36.970> driving<00:02:37.420> a

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:37.630 
really involves just driving a

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:39.630 
really involves just driving a
screwdriver<00:02:38.410> between<00:02:38.680> two<00:02:39.010> layers<00:02:39.190> and

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:39.640 
screwdriver between two layers and

00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.450 
screwdriver between two layers and
slowly<00:02:40.210> prizing<00:02:40.720> it<00:02:40.810> apart<00:02:41.160> so<00:02:42.160> you<00:02:42.250> can<00:02:42.280> see

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:42.460 
slowly prizing it apart so you can see

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:44.160 
slowly prizing it apart so you can see
the<00:02:42.520> mold<00:02:42.730> slowly<00:02:43.180> coming<00:02:43.480> up<00:02:43.600> pop<00:02:43.780> it's<00:02:44.140> just

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170 
the mold slowly coming up pop it's just

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:45.840 
the mold slowly coming up pop it's just
really<00:02:44.410> questioned<00:02:44.800> now<00:02:44.920> slowly<00:02:45.310> easing<00:02:45.760> it

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:45.850 
really questioned now slowly easing it

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:48.690 
really questioned now slowly easing it
out<00:02:46.030> obviously<00:02:46.990> the<00:02:47.170> sculpture<00:02:47.770> gets

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:48.700 
out obviously the sculpture gets

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:50.490 
out obviously the sculpture gets
destroyed<00:02:49.120> the<00:02:49.660> process<00:02:50.050> of<00:02:50.170> putting<00:02:50.350> our

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.500 
destroyed the process of putting our

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:52.620 
destroyed the process of putting our
partner<00:02:50.950> over<00:02:51.790> this<00:02:52.000> point<00:02:52.330> we're<00:02:52.570> gonna

00:02:52.620 --> 00:02:52.630 
partner over this point we're gonna

00:02:52.630 --> 00:02:53.850 
partner over this point we're gonna
clear<00:02:52.960> it<00:02:52.990> out<00:02:53.230> and<00:02:53.440> then<00:02:53.530> through<00:02:53.710> the

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:53.860 
clear it out and then through the

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:57.330 
clear it out and then through the
interior<00:02:54.310> here<00:02:54.580> with<00:02:55.270> silicone<00:02:56.130> okay<00:02:57.130> so<00:02:57.190> what

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:57.340 
interior here with silicone okay so what

00:02:57.340 --> 00:02:59.580 
interior here with silicone okay so what
we're<00:02:57.460> doing<00:02:57.610> now<00:02:57.730> just<00:02:58.030> laying<00:02:58.300> a<00:02:58.630> layer<00:02:59.350> of

00:02:59.580 --> 00:02:59.590 
we're doing now just laying a layer of

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:02.760 
we're doing now just laying a layer of
clay<00:03:00.010> on<00:03:00.250> the<00:03:00.340> inside<00:03:00.640> of<00:03:00.670> the<00:03:01.000> mold<00:03:01.770> here's

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:02.770 
clay on the inside of the mold here's

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:04.320 
clay on the inside of the mold here's
one<00:03:02.980> of<00:03:03.070> the<00:03:03.130> empty<00:03:03.430> ones<00:03:03.610> I've<00:03:03.760> cleaned<00:03:04.090> most

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:04.330 
one of the empty ones I've cleaned most

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:06.480 
one of the empty ones I've cleaned most
of<00:03:04.540> the<00:03:04.600> sculpture<00:03:05.350> as<00:03:05.500> of<00:03:05.680> now<00:03:06.280> what<00:03:06.400> we're

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:06.490 
of the sculpture as of now what we're

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:09.240 
of the sculpture as of now what we're
going<00:03:06.580> to<00:03:06.640> do<00:03:06.820> is<00:03:07.150> once<00:03:07.990> the<00:03:08.200> wall<00:03:08.500> is<00:03:08.530> put<00:03:09.100> on

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250 
going to do is once the wall is put on

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:10.530 
going to do is once the wall is put on
both<00:03:09.400> sides<00:03:09.640> and<00:03:09.790> molding<00:03:10.180> and<00:03:10.270> put<00:03:10.450> them

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540 
both sides and molding and put them

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.900 
both sides and molding and put them
together<00:03:10.660> then<00:03:11.380> put<00:03:11.410> something<00:03:11.950> an<00:03:12.100> expanding

00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:12.910 
together then put something an expanding

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:15.660 
together then put something an expanding
foam<00:03:13.210> to<00:03:14.110> fill<00:03:14.470> the<00:03:14.620> cavity<00:03:15.070> and<00:03:15.340> what<00:03:15.490> that'll

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:15.670 
foam to fill the cavity and what that'll

00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:18.720 
foam to fill the cavity and what that'll
do<00:03:15.850> is<00:03:15.880> create<00:03:16.330> a<00:03:16.360> core<00:03:16.720> for<00:03:17.290> me<00:03:17.320> main<00:03:17.730> main

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:18.730 
do is create a core for me main main

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:20.840 
do is create a core for me main main
puppet<00:03:19.150> which<00:03:19.959> will<00:03:20.110> then<00:03:20.230> be<00:03:20.320> covered<00:03:20.500> in<00:03:20.709> the

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:20.850 
puppet which will then be covered in the

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:24.060 
puppet which will then be covered in the
translucent<00:03:21.850> silicon<00:03:22.680> okay<00:03:23.680> so<00:03:23.739> here's<00:03:24.040> the

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:24.070 
translucent silicon okay so here's the

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:27.420 
translucent silicon okay so here's the
foam<00:03:24.880> core<00:03:25.330> interior<00:03:26.080> which<00:03:27.040> I've<00:03:27.250> just

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:27.430 
foam core interior which I've just

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:30.060 
foam core interior which I've just
pulled<00:03:27.670> out<00:03:27.880> on<00:03:28.000> the<00:03:28.060> mold<00:03:28.290> you<00:03:29.290> can<00:03:29.650> see<00:03:29.890> we

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:30.070 
pulled out on the mold you can see we

00:03:30.070 --> 00:03:33.390 
pulled out on the mold you can see we
clay<00:03:30.610> wore<00:03:31.150> just<00:03:31.780> down<00:03:32.050> here<00:03:32.080> and<00:03:32.950> here's<00:03:33.190> the

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
clay wore just down here and here's the

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.640 
clay wore just down here and here's the
phone<00:03:34.000> which<00:03:34.209> is<00:03:34.390> smaller<00:03:34.780> than<00:03:34.870> the<00:03:35.140> actual

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:35.650 
phone which is smaller than the actual

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:38.729 
phone which is smaller than the actual
sculpture<00:03:36.100> and<00:03:36.730> will<00:03:37.030> sit<00:03:37.300> inside<00:03:37.690> and<00:03:38.530> see

00:03:38.729 --> 00:03:38.739 
sculpture and will sit inside and see

00:03:38.739 --> 00:03:40.260 
sculpture and will sit inside and see
there's<00:03:38.950> the<00:03:39.070> metal<00:03:39.400> beam<00:03:39.640> there<00:03:39.940> which<00:03:40.090> will

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:40.270 
there's the metal beam there which will

00:03:40.270 --> 00:03:44.340 
there's the metal beam there which will
give<00:03:40.420> it<00:03:40.570> a<00:03:40.980> loud<00:03:41.980> to<00:03:42.160> flex<00:03:42.510> because<00:03:43.510> cut<00:03:43.930> quite

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:44.350 
give it a loud to flex because cut quite

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:46.470 
give it a loud to flex because cut quite
a<00:03:44.410> large<00:03:44.560> air<00:03:44.860> bubble<00:03:45.250> here<00:03:45.519> but<00:03:45.970> when<00:03:46.390> you

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:46.480 
a large air bubble here but when you

00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.240 
a large air bubble here but when you
rotate<00:03:46.810> some<00:03:47.019> of<00:03:47.080> the<00:03:47.140> excess<00:03:47.769> foam<00:03:48.040> which

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:48.250 
rotate some of the excess foam which

00:03:48.250 --> 00:03:51.180 
rotate some of the excess foam which
just<00:03:48.489> blows<00:03:48.760> it<00:03:48.940> out<00:03:49.030> mold<00:03:49.330> here<00:03:49.769> just<00:03:50.769> build

00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:51.190 
just blows it out mold here just build

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:59.790 
just blows it out mold here just build
that<00:03:51.250> up<00:03:51.459> so<00:03:51.700> it's<00:03:51.820> actually<00:03:52.150> filled<00:03:52.390> in

00:03:59.790 --> 00:03:59.800 

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:02.410 

okay<00:04:00.800> so<00:04:00.860> here's<00:04:01.130> just<00:04:01.340> a<00:04:01.490> few<00:04:01.760> shots<00:04:02.090> of<00:04:02.270> the

00:04:02.410 --> 00:04:02.420 
okay so here's just a few shots of the

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:04.570 
okay so here's just a few shots of the
back<00:04:02.660> of<00:04:02.870> the<00:04:02.960> mold<00:04:03.230> basically<00:04:03.860> the<00:04:04.130> silicon

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:04.580 
back of the mold basically the silicon

00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:06.490 
back of the mold basically the silicon
is<00:04:04.700> going<00:04:04.910> to<00:04:05.030> be<00:04:05.150> poured<00:04:05.510> in<00:04:05.690> through<00:04:05.750> here

00:04:06.490 --> 00:04:06.500 
is going to be poured in through here

00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:08.350 
is going to be poured in through here
and<00:04:06.560> here<00:04:06.710> I<00:04:07.100> basically<00:04:07.430> cut<00:04:07.850> these<00:04:08.000> at<00:04:08.300> the

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:08.360 
and here I basically cut these at the

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:09.790 
and here I basically cut these at the
highest<00:04:08.600> point<00:04:08.900> of<00:04:09.110> the<00:04:09.170> mold<00:04:09.470> when<00:04:09.650> it's

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:09.800 
highest point of the mold when it's

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:11.110 
highest point of the mold when it's
language<00:04:10.100> is<00:04:10.160> front<00:04:10.460> so<00:04:10.730> that<00:04:10.880> when<00:04:11.000> they're

00:04:11.110 --> 00:04:11.120 
language is front so that when they're

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:12.910 
language is front so that when they're
selling<00:04:11.330> its<00:04:11.450> poured<00:04:11.720> in<00:04:11.840> it<00:04:12.020> will<00:04:12.500> just<00:04:12.620> pour

00:04:12.910 --> 00:04:12.920 
selling its poured in it will just pour

00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:16.780 
selling its poured in it will just pour
through<00:04:13.610> the<00:04:13.760> whole<00:04:13.910> mold<00:04:15.310> okay<00:04:16.310> so<00:04:16.370> you<00:04:16.610> just

00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:16.790 
through the whole mold okay so you just

00:04:16.790 --> 00:04:19.390 
through the whole mold okay so you just
crack<00:04:17.030> the<00:04:17.120> mold<00:04:17.360> open<00:04:17.830> so<00:04:18.830> far<00:04:19.130> it's<00:04:19.310> looking

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:19.400 
crack the mold open so far it's looking

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:24.010 
crack the mold open so far it's looking
quite<00:04:19.970> good<00:04:20.170> back<00:04:21.170> of<00:04:21.320> the<00:04:21.380> head<00:04:21.940> the<00:04:23.020> silicon

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:24.020 
quite good back of the head the silicon

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:27.450 
quite good back of the head the silicon
doesn't<00:04:24.290> appear<00:04:24.470> to<00:04:24.500> have<00:04:24.620> covered<00:04:25.100> the<00:04:25.250> foam

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:27.460 
doesn't appear to have covered the foam

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:30.520 
doesn't appear to have covered the foam
core<00:04:28.460> it's<00:04:29.090> not<00:04:29.300> entirely<00:04:29.750> problems<00:04:30.200> we<00:04:30.410> can

00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:30.530 
core it's not entirely problems we can

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:32.170 
core it's not entirely problems we can
just<00:04:30.710> cast<00:04:30.890> a<00:04:31.070> small<00:04:31.280> section<00:04:31.640> of<00:04:31.700> the<00:04:31.790> back

00:04:32.170 --> 00:04:32.180 
just cast a small section of the back

00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:36.250 
just cast a small section of the back
head<00:04:32.450> and<00:04:32.630> then<00:04:32.750> glue<00:04:33.290> that<00:04:33.440> on<00:04:34.030> so<00:04:35.030> I'm<00:04:35.930> going

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:36.260 
head and then glue that on so I'm going

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:38.800 
head and then glue that on so I'm going
to<00:04:36.290> now<00:04:36.560> try<00:04:37.340> and<00:04:37.670> pull<00:04:38.210> the<00:04:38.360> rest<00:04:38.480> of<00:04:38.600> it<00:04:38.690> out

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:38.810 
to now try and pull the rest of it out

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:40.330 
to now try and pull the rest of it out
and<00:04:39.140> hopefully<00:04:39.350> the<00:04:39.620> front<00:04:39.890> of<00:04:39.950> the<00:04:40.010> mold<00:04:40.160> will

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:40.340 
and hopefully the front of the mold will

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:56.020 
and hopefully the front of the mold will
be<00:04:40.460> a<00:04:40.490> will<00:04:41.450> be<00:04:41.600> fine

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:56.030 

00:04:56.030 --> 00:04:59.899 

okay<00:04:57.030> here's<00:04:57.240> a<00:04:57.330> few<00:04:57.479> shots<00:04:57.750> of<00:04:58.020> the<00:04:58.909> the

00:04:59.899 --> 00:04:59.909 
okay here's a few shots of the the

00:04:59.909 --> 00:05:04.899 
okay here's a few shots of the the
puppet<00:05:00.270> being<00:05:00.449> painted

00:05:04.899 --> 00:05:04.909 

00:05:04.909 --> 00:05:07.219 

because<00:05:05.909> here's<00:05:06.180> the<00:05:06.240> finished<00:05:06.629> puppet<00:05:06.930> after

00:05:07.219 --> 00:05:07.229 
because here's the finished puppet after

00:05:07.229 --> 00:05:11.029 
because here's the finished puppet after
painting<00:05:08.569> painting<00:05:09.569> was<00:05:09.780> a<00:05:09.919> bit<00:05:10.919> more

00:05:11.029 --> 00:05:11.039 
painting painting was a bit more

00:05:11.039 --> 00:05:12.020 
painting painting was a bit more
difficult<00:05:11.400> than<00:05:11.430> I<00:05:11.580> thought<00:05:11.699> it<00:05:11.849> would<00:05:11.940> be

00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:12.030 
difficult than I thought it would be

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:15.200 
difficult than I thought it would be
actually<00:05:12.300> and<00:05:13.009> I<00:05:14.009> wasn't<00:05:14.610> entirely<00:05:14.970> happy

00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:15.210 
actually and I wasn't entirely happy

00:05:15.210 --> 00:05:17.689 
actually and I wasn't entirely happy
with<00:05:15.360> the<00:05:15.449> finished<00:05:15.720> result<00:05:16.050> however<00:05:16.530> it<00:05:17.460> does

00:05:17.689 --> 00:05:17.699 
with the finished result however it does

00:05:17.699 --> 00:05:19.279 
with the finished result however it does
seem<00:05:17.909> to<00:05:17.940> photograph<00:05:18.509> and<00:05:18.690> film<00:05:18.720> quite<00:05:19.050> well

00:05:19.279 --> 00:05:19.289 
seem to photograph and film quite well

00:05:19.289 --> 00:05:22.839 
seem to photograph and film quite well
so<00:05:20.069> I<00:05:20.930> think<00:05:21.930> it's<00:05:22.050> not<00:05:22.169> too<00:05:22.259> bad<00:05:22.470> in<00:05:22.650> the<00:05:22.740> end

00:05:22.839 --> 00:05:22.849 
so I think it's not too bad in the end

00:05:22.849 --> 00:05:25.159 
so I think it's not too bad in the end
as<00:05:23.849> you<00:05:23.940> can<00:05:24.030> see<00:05:24.180> I've<00:05:24.300> punched<00:05:24.750> a<00:05:24.870> little<00:05:25.050> bit

00:05:25.159 --> 00:05:25.169 
as you can see I've punched a little bit

00:05:25.169 --> 00:05:28.730 
as you can see I've punched a little bit
hair<00:05:25.470> into<00:05:25.770> the<00:05:25.830> head<00:05:25.979> as<00:05:26.129> well<00:05:27.409> the<00:05:28.409> idea<00:05:28.650> for

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:28.740 
hair into the head as well the idea for

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:30.379 
hair into the head as well the idea for
the<00:05:28.830> thing<00:05:28.979> cortisol<00:05:29.460> being<00:05:29.669> a<00:05:29.759> test<00:05:29.940> tube<00:05:30.210> or

00:05:30.379 --> 00:05:30.389 
the thing cortisol being a test tube or

00:05:30.389 --> 00:05:31.790 
the thing cortisol being a test tube or
a<00:05:30.449> kind<00:05:30.599> of<00:05:30.659> a<00:05:30.719> large<00:05:30.900> glass<00:05:31.169> beaker<00:05:31.500> filled

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:31.800 
a kind of a large glass beaker filled

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:33.499 
a kind of a large glass beaker filled
with<00:05:31.979> fluid<00:05:32.340> so<00:05:32.909> I'm<00:05:32.969> kind<00:05:33.150> of<00:05:33.180> hoping<00:05:33.330> that

00:05:33.499 --> 00:05:33.509 
with fluid so I'm kind of hoping that

00:05:33.509 --> 00:05:36.140 
with fluid so I'm kind of hoping that
the<00:05:33.750> the<00:05:34.139> hair<00:05:34.349> will<00:05:34.560> wave<00:05:35.460> as<00:05:35.759> the<00:05:35.879> fluid

00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:36.150 
the the hair will wave as the fluid

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:39.979 
the the hair will wave as the fluid
moves<00:05:36.300> around<00:05:36.479> doing<00:05:37.379> it<00:05:37.469> quite<00:05:37.620> cool<00:05:37.800> look
