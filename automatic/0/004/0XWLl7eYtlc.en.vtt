00:00:03.589 --> 00:00:10.230
 I have been doing for over three and a half years 

00:00:06.509 --> 00:00:11.250
 videos for youtube have almost 6000 videos 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.099
 uploaded 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.260
 but in a white t-shirt you have 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:18.060
 I never saw why I did this 

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:20.400
 t-shirt and where did I wear it anyway 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:23.039
 I have the experience in this loaded 

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:25.590
 raider unboxing video have fun here 

00:00:23.039 --> 00:00:27.210
 So the trader boxer had to start 

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.710
 first say that I quite there 

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:31.320
 heavy 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:33.570
 what the fuck i'm scary 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:35.640
 curious what's in there is a box 

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.860
 I do not know what's in there, yes one 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:40.739
 crate packed with gaming merge and 

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:46.530
 carbon I'm awesome 

00:00:40.739 --> 00:00:49.680
 an audi some guests went on 

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.879
 first traders ticker okay that is 

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.270
 maybe not so exciting now 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:01:00.559
 but we'll put it aside 

00:00:53.270 --> 00:01:05.850
 so amelie oliwa king belongs 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:09.720
 amazing spiderman comic the latest 

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:11.970
 adventure of the new york avant crawler 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:14.070
 the first edition of this spiderman 

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.710
 magazine of this comic I have to 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:19.290
 admit I was never a big comic reader 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.850
 the only thing I ever did and that 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.070
 've also read very intense was micky 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:25.080
 mouse staples otherwise if you as the 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.210
 So comic can mean so in this 

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:28.829
 heft milieu one would say but you 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:30.150
 unfortunately I get never really read 

00:01:28.829 --> 00:01:31.560
 which I really regret because the 

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:34.560
 I should always be very good 

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:37.200
 but at least always quite big heard 

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:38.159
 this this comic when we definitely 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.509
 give it a try 

00:01:38.159 --> 00:01:45.689
 I'll just have a quick look 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:47.369
 whether the whether the quality of the staple 

00:01:45.689 --> 00:01:52.580
 at least in a proper way 

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:57.710
 Constitution is very good 

00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:59.690
 smells of paper so a spiderman 

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:01.100
 comic book very cool 

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:02.450
 that is not so bad 

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:04.520
 then you continue to look my eye 

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:12.010
 Immediately sees another spiderman 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:15.410
 equipment with a cup 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:17.210
 that's the hammer that's there 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:20.810
 all trader that's great, I have 

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:22.640
 me even this little doll and 

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:25.820
 Now I have you a lot 

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:29.350
 better oho 

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:31.340
 that looks aha has one 

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:33.530
 spiderman cup 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:38.390
 that makes some games here or we 

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:38.780
 no doubt better say a good one 

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:42.200
 morning 

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:45.200
 drink was very cool so there marvel 

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:45.860
 Officially, everything is very close to the 

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:47.840
 I like it 

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:52.270
 then we continue to look at one I have 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.270
 here's a little sticker and 

00:02:53.260 --> 00:03:04.280
 then we have one more here 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:06.350
 fat one a superman well you you can 

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:09.290
 Sometimes you can see a patch 

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:12.350
 somehow she can live it, too 

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:14.540
 Doing this looks like glue 

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:17.480
 but this is my super person 

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:19.100
 so nice as well then always times 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:20.480
 again you have big out yes you want 

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:22.040
 sure know what the big stuff here 

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:24.560
 then start so that I would 

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:26.480
 say we start off in turn, 

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:28.660
 something easier to come after that comes 

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:35.269
 I wanted to say that it was difficult 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:39.140
 pop heroes from the dc universe such a 

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:40.910
 figure of flash look that's nice 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:43.130
 it is also something more going 

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:45.230
 to my meat in green lantern moment 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:47.600
 So that's a whole collection of too 

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:48.560
 give me nothing at all 

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:51.080
 I have not realized that before 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:51.880
 But there are but we will see the same 

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:55.630
 take a look 

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:55.630
 a flash figure 

00:03:58.659 --> 00:04:03.980
 I've already got that in my hand 

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:07.129
 know you want me to just look 

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:08.930
 that cool or a little flash 

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:12.530
 figurine that is guaranteed to open up well 

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:15.260
 the fridge and you can see the So yes 

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:18.199
 even with moving barren head no me 

00:04:15.260 --> 00:04:19.449
 Do not want to be on the closet why not 

00:04:18.199 --> 00:04:22.400
 where else are we going? 

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:25.250
 well, good meat is not so much 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:31.520
 crawl but the figure in itself right 

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:33.289
 cool that look here fans so then 

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:44.000
 let's see what my neck I looked 

00:04:33.289 --> 00:04:48.080
 something you are so hard memory 

00:04:44.000 --> 00:05:06.349
 I really have free 

00:04:48.080 --> 00:05:10.130
 but certainly with what an ada 

00:05:06.349 --> 00:05:12.620
 Fucking motive I'm afraid that he will 

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:14.150
 have seen something better in the intro 

00:05:12.620 --> 00:05:15.320
 because I already know like me 

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:18.740
 make my and raw 

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:20.840
 but this is really big 

00:05:18.740 --> 00:05:24.710

 But you are a bastard 

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:41.810
 So you already see in which direction 

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:43.340
 This package is for nerds just that 

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:45.860
 right almost perfect and here we have 

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:51.110

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:58.070
