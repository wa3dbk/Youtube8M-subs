00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:16.619
 hello and welcome to the 

00:00:12.249 --> 00:00:19.390
 advent calendar to number 6 on day 0 6 

00:00:16.619 --> 00:00:22.769
 and 2 has the nikolaus and I have mine 

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:32.110
 a grid too good and that's the dax 

00:00:22.769 --> 00:00:34.090
 Hello old face and it is 

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:37.079
 nikolaus but the nikolaus has, of course 

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:39.700
 spoils the gifts to distribute 

00:00:37.079 --> 00:00:43.149
 that's why we said okay we have 

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:45.190
 not the reindeer but still should 

00:00:43.149 --> 00:00:47.890
 the children get their presents 

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:50.230
 would say just without hesitation 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:51.340
 Let's look at the gifts or yes you 

00:00:50.230 --> 00:00:52.750
 do yours i have my friend 

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:54.390
 beginning from left to right 

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:59.340
 Once again, there are the words 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:01:01.660
 keyboard so today 

00:00:59.340 --> 00:01:04.090
 I think we can do it differently 

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:06.369
 There are no five homes to distribute 

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:08.350
 There are four houses and there are five 

00:01:06.369 --> 00:01:10.720
 objects once a child gets two 

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:13.090
 things that is no problem is the 

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:15.790
 Nicholas had been valid or that 

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:23.460
 chin has behaved well once there's 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:23.460
 keyboard became the town hall 351 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:34.600
 to the medion extreme desktop now 

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:36.310
 No tags said I do not have a brand 

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:39.250
 because I take out now or exactly 

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:41.979
 then you can take everything and you have to 

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:45.969
 then in her house is one is one 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:47.079
 hiding or not hiding that 

00:01:45.969 --> 00:01:48.310
 Let's hope you do not believe you 

00:01:47.079 --> 00:01:49.509
 to find you we are natural 

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:52.329
 also labeled with minecraft and 

00:01:49.509 --> 00:01:54.719
 terracina and yes I would say 

00:01:52.329 --> 00:01:54.719
 we 

00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:58.360
 China would have to if you want one 

00:01:57.189 --> 00:02:00.549
 get small advantage and back there 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:02.380
 go on it then you go have you ever 

00:02:00.549 --> 00:02:03.909
 the ladder and i can ok the people ok 

00:02:02.380 --> 00:02:06.490
 comes in three's going on you're ready yes 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:09.039
 Do you have all the gifts here, yes, normal 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:10.869
 Are you ready to do the gifts and 

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:20.250
 for every case I want to be here 

00:02:10.869 --> 00:02:20.250
 a good preparation is yes 32 10 

00:02:27.989 --> 00:02:43.690
 And these parts are not exactly that 

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.430
 what I thought something in there too 

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:47.110
 exactly 

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.650
 to hold a muslim to the screen 

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:49.840
 stick 

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:58.209
 Oh I have to do what I help her 

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:59.739
 Of course, what else do you want with it? 

00:02:58.209 --> 00:03:04.500
 first jump'n'run I have so totally 

00:02:59.739 --> 00:03:12.250
 failed no no there is not one 

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:14.769
 I really have the wrong place 

00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:16.230
 I sell three times an old one I sell 

00:03:14.769 --> 00:03:18.370
 hh 

00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:28.049
 but now I have a good chance 

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:28.049
 because here because we have been bad 

00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:34.450
 possible is possible 

00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:38.440
 the jump is feasible even believes 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:40.350
 not the problem is me 

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:42.610
 probably die soon 

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:45.520
 are not you hungry or something like that ? 

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:47.770
 but may do the wrong thing 

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:49.150
 until now, there is still if I am there now 

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:50.610
 then I'll fly down the back 

00:03:49.150 --> 00:03:56.020
 do not fight back 

00:03:50.610 --> 00:04:03.970
 ok how is that supposed to go see there 

00:03:56.020 --> 00:04:07.270
 it applications simplify service easy 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:09.670
 not right but it is possible 

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:11.710
 you have to stop it because you heard that next door 

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:14.760
 you could have left here so we 

00:04:11.710 --> 00:04:14.760
 could have tried that 

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:26.620
 I'm not dead when that shit jaja 

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:30.120
 I have two hearts 

00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:30.120
 if you are good then I won 

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:34.810
 distributed daily from 

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:38.520
 but I find a profession that the nikolaus 

00:04:34.810 --> 00:04:38.520
 did not distribute his gifts 

00:04:45.900 --> 00:05:00.040
 I was thinking of doing something in there exactly 

00:04:48.730 --> 00:05:04.180
 something in here I 'm waiting for that 

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:05.889
 chance I'm somehow always 

00:05:04.180 --> 00:05:12.280
 always that golden one 

00:05:05.889 --> 00:05:14.499
 this just okay okay you are okay 

00:05:12.280 --> 00:05:16.509
 that's going to be difficult now when I do that 

00:05:14.499 --> 00:05:20.590
 catch up with what I do I want too 

00:05:16.509 --> 00:05:24.360
 times davos would have that now too 

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:31.979
 hard but I try the world too 

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:35.370
 I'll get it soon 

00:05:31.979 --> 00:05:37.749
 have me one 

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:40.509
 as much time must I must also 

00:05:37.749 --> 00:05:44.319
 somehow be white then come on as 

00:05:40.509 --> 00:05:45.729
 white comes out down here only 

00:05:44.319 --> 00:05:47.319
 hin that all that now as 

00:05:45.729 --> 00:05:49.199
 understanding competition or that's how it is 

00:05:47.319 --> 00:05:51.550
 none of that is just so much fun 

00:05:49.199 --> 00:05:53.199
 is now clear advent calendar I am yes 

00:05:51.550 --> 00:05:53.759
 even to hospitable I will also not 

00:05:53.199 --> 00:05:58.750
 stay 

00:05:53.759 --> 00:06:01.569
 that's exactly what an advent calendar is 

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:03.999
 of course on my channel so always 

00:06:01.569 --> 00:06:05.589
 every advent comes after all else 

00:06:03.999 --> 00:06:07.419
 you can easily get other videos 

00:06:05.589 --> 00:06:09.099
 let's drop by so that's exactly me 

00:06:07.419 --> 00:06:10.689
 make it into a joke in the kitchen 

00:06:09.099 --> 00:06:13.779
 I do not know where I need is long 

00:06:10.689 --> 00:06:15.250
 the problem actually not here 

00:06:13.779 --> 00:06:17.099
 that is the good i have one 

00:06:15.250 --> 00:06:20.169
 friend instructed to build that 

00:06:17.099 --> 00:06:20.620
 so if I needed that now 

00:06:20.169 --> 00:06:26.370
 then better 

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:26.370
 yes, yes, I did it 

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:42.410
 so now I have all of you handed out 

00:06:37.970 --> 00:06:43.699
 do not really have no no I know 

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:50.539
 not whether what I now the last 

00:06:43.699 --> 00:06:52.520
 but I should not make any gifts 

00:06:50.539 --> 00:06:57.440
 and i take the extra time and one like that 

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:59.050
 Armor simply win everyone 

00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:02.030

00:06:59.050 --> 00:07:03.680

00:07:02.030 --> 00:07:05.630
 such just entertained or 

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:07.039
 let's show that darwins did not learn 

00:07:05.630 --> 00:07:08.900
 just have to do with giveaways 

00:07:07.039 --> 00:07:09.440
 but simply human too 

00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:11.990
 demonstrate 

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:14.360
 then i would say thanks for looking 

00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:17.449

00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:18.860
