00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
 Hello everyone I am elÃ­as 368 

00:00:02.850 --> 00:00:06.359
 I bring this video and this time you are 

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:08.250
 watching in the background the gameplay shown in 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:10.740
 the microsoft conference of this 3 

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.900
 2014 and it's about call of duty advanced 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:15.540
 quarter how good they have let me climb 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:16.650
 also because several highlights of everything 

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.449
 what was shown more or less 

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:21.480
 showed about 10 

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:23.670
 minutes and this video, I've summarized it 

00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:25.529
 so to speak in about 4 minutes and 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.359
 medium I think it does not come in fact so 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:29.429
 well I will explain several details 

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:32.309
 of one of a very exclusive event to which 

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:35.070
 I was only attended by about 15 people and 

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:37.680
 it was an event in a hotel you will see 

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.360
 in a blog that I imagine I'll upload today 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:41.700
 or tomorrow I do not know I do not know when I'll upload it 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.860
 but hey it was at the ritz carlton hotel 

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:45.600
 which is one of the best hotels here 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:48.510
 in the angels was in a suite in the 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:52.140
 last floor and well they taught us 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:53.969
 in a room there was a television of no 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.770
 I know how many inches would be but it was very 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:57.570
 very large with a home system has 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.670
 also to be able to hear well the 

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:01.890
 sound and we saw a mission that apparently 

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:03.989
 I from what I've seen on the internet and 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:05.700
 others talking to him with angel still do not know 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:06.540
 has shown vale I saw a mission which 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:09.180
 they leave me 

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:11.550
 what happened but they do not let me show you 

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:13.830
 the mission as such the mission in particular 

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:16.710
 was developing in Bulgaria if not 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:18.540
 I remember bad and good was that 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:20.580
 we would go running next to one 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:23.250
 of our colleagues we are in total 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:24.810
 four people and good one of them 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:26.550
 are we evidently so 

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:28.410
 We were with a running partner 

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:31.050
 because we were being chased by a helicopter 

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:33.720
 firing us good signaling us with 

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:35.850
 the focus and firing us with bullets 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:38.310
 of apparently quite caliber because 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.320
 there would be gaps even on the ground like this 

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:42.330
 how good the mission was that 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:45.180
 we had to escape from that helicopter 

00:01:42.330 --> 00:01:47.190
 then we had to overcome certain 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.900
 stealth testing so to speak and 

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:52.110
 finally we met with our 

00:01:48.900 --> 00:01:54.180
 two other partners in that game play are 

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.820
 I could use invisibility 

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:57.690
 also good invisibility the 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:59.729
 truth is that it was quite important 

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:00.960
 because being secretive because I had to 

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.720
 become invisible when you went to 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:06.390
 chase the enemies to be able to 

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:07.950
 kill them in the back and so on 

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.470
 good to me that mission the truth is that 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:12.010
 I really liked this you are 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:13.870
 watching now too 

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:15.760
 pretty well I think it was developing 

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:18.519
 in new york 'if I remember correctly and 

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.530
 Well the truth I wanted to share with 

00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:21.700
 you more than anything to open a 

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:23.379
 small debate also in the 

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.760
 comments and tell me that you are 

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:26.890
 appearing everything you are seeing 

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.150
 about the game and how are you doing 

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:29.140
 seeing in the title probably I 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:30.760
 I imagine that I will have put something of 

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:32.860
 multiplayer details because then good 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:35.709
 because in that very exclusive event 

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:37.269
 which I was able to attend also saw a 

00:02:35.709 --> 00:02:40.629
 little of multiplayer a game 

00:02:37.269 --> 00:02:43.209
 private among the co-founders of 

00:02:40.629 --> 00:02:44.709
 slate gamer games apparently and good that 

00:02:43.209 --> 00:02:46.540
 they explained to us that the experience 

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:49.989
 multiplayer was going to change completely 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:52.590
 thanks to all the type of jumps and good 

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:55.599
 super super speed so to speak 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:57.909
 instant those little impulses towards 

00:02:55.599 --> 00:03:00.010
 the sides and forward and towards 

00:02:57.909 --> 00:03:01.359
 back and well then that changed the 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:02.859
 experience because then because 

00:03:01.359 --> 00:03:05.409
 example we could pursue a 

00:03:02.859 --> 00:03:07.569
 person and get ahead of him 

00:03:05.409 --> 00:03:09.519
 thanks to a jump and an impulse towards 

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:11.109
 forward are not small things that are going to 

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:12.819
 change everything that comes 

00:03:11.109 --> 00:03:14.799
 being the idea that we have of call of 

00:03:12.819 --> 00:03:17.109
 duty and also something that I liked 

00:03:14.799 --> 00:03:17.710
 very much is that we are going to have a 

00:03:17.109 --> 00:03:19.230
 screen 

00:03:17.710 --> 00:03:23.320
 much cleaner as you are seeing 

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:26.530
 Well, no hd appears right now 

00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:29.530
 but I saw it or I saw the game with 

00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:31.630
 everything that comes with being the good the 

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:33.670
 game as such, and the truth is that it was 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:35.410
 very very clean because well the 

00:03:33.670 --> 00:03:38.410
 confundadores also of esles gamer 

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:39.820
 game they say it could be something similar to 

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:41.560
 what a soldier can see with a 

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:43.780
 google glass is a small information 

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:45.310
 and it looks a lot like dead space by 

00:03:43.780 --> 00:03:47.410
 so say it not if you want to compare it with 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:49.630
 some game then we could decide that 

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:51.820
 the screen is as clean as that 

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:53.950
 I play so nothing more to me the 

00:03:51.820 --> 00:03:57.370
 theme of jumps and other good can 

00:03:53.950 --> 00:03:58.960
 seem a bit may scare a bit in 

00:03:57.370 --> 00:04:00.460
 a principle but I'm liking the 

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:02.320
 idea so I'm seeing little by little 

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:03.580
 so you can not tell me anything in the 

00:04:02.320 --> 00:04:05.950
 comments that is appearing on 

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:07.900
 game you can always discuss with respect 

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:09.400
 please insult us among you and 

00:04:07.900 --> 00:04:10.840
 nothing like that and nothing like always 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:12.370
 like and favorites if you have spent 

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:14.560
 well can you follow me on twitter on 

00:04:12.370 --> 00:04:17.799
 facebook subscribe if you are not and without 

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:20.609
 nothing more to say says goodbye 360 

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:20.609
 until next time
