00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:50.490 
apps like this help us visualize and I

00:01:50.490 --> 00:01:52.490 
apps like this help us visualize and I
think<00:01:50.880> players<00:01:51.090> learn<00:01:51.390> in<00:01:51.780> so<00:01:52.170> many<00:01:52.290> different

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
think players learn in so many different

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.499 
think players learn in so many different
ways<00:01:52.680> the<00:01:53.070> best<00:01:53.250> way<00:01:53.369> we<00:01:53.520> find<00:01:53.790> is<00:01:53.970> visualizing

00:01:54.499 --> 00:01:54.509 
ways the best way we find is visualizing

00:01:54.509 --> 00:01:56.690 
ways the best way we find is visualizing
so<00:01:55.110> I<00:01:55.170> wheel<00:01:55.290> shoulder<00:01:55.740> shoulder<00:01:56.490> what<00:01:56.579> we're
