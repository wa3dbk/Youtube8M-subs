00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:13.270
 Personal speech the G8 is ridiculous person 

00:00:12.219 --> 00:00:15.670
 Special 

00:00:13.270 --> 00:00:17.320
 alina which was first put into 

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:20.019
 medicine a fuck 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:23.080
 I think, yes, it was only that I chose more 

00:00:20.019 --> 00:00:26.349
 resistance first state with if had 

00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:28.749
 Something like that from kurt. 

00:00:26.349 --> 00:00:30.550
 motivated to do something 

00:00:28.749 --> 00:00:31.660
 different to get to the first 

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:34.870
 place 

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:37.449
 I think that 's the question of what the 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:40.570
 own season hit the course next 

00:00:37.449 --> 00:00:42.760
 and did not pass first and you see the 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:43.809
 as investments and I and your 

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.940
 family 

00:00:43.809 --> 00:00:49.390
 this for me and I think for many 

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:51.280
 people is a big motivation photo of 

00:00:49.390 --> 00:00:52.960
 your family is making an effort and 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:55.960
 had to give something in return is 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.769
 so not that I had but I felt 

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.840
 best 

00:00:56.769 --> 00:01:01.510
 another thing that is very asked 

00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:04.059
 It is also the question of the routine if 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:06.610
 a routine that followed day by day 

00:01:04.059 --> 00:01:09.730
 It was for my routine, it was very 

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:12.250
 important and I think she gives you a 

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:14.830
 discipline not only in the state but in everything 

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:17.530
 sleeping issue that had a schedule 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:19.960
 like sleeping eight hours a day 

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:23.050
 Another important thing for me is 

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:26.410
 had a method as he wished and studied 

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:29.050
 night everything you wrote down that in 

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:31.960
 up to eg course and be a studio 

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:34.720
 is the good part of the kings one of the notebooks 

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:37.420
 and are very organized. 

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:39.400
 but with what you are remarkable had a fear 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:42.730
 going out at night or just jotting down 

00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:44.440
 the way she speaks and she speaks 

00:01:42.730 --> 00:01:46.480
 precisely this matter but I guess 

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:48.730
 cool but I tried to keep a 

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:50.590
 sequence was already set in the story 

00:01:48.730 --> 00:01:53.860
 I would not let go to see the 

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:56.500
 process was daniel back 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:59.260
 It was when people asked me who 

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:03.730
 did and it's harder to do that time 

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:05.800
 of surgery enter this subject city 

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:08.890
 the wording for example the model 

00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:11.290
 always at the time of writing 

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:14.620
 if you had a son or daughter who will 

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:17.230
 do enem and if you had little time 

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:19.930
 to leave are the main focus is 

00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:23.400
 this team's after-sales window will be 

00:02:19.930 --> 00:02:23.400
 big what would this rabbit
