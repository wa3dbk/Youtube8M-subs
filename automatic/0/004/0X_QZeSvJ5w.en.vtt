you throttle on the on the remote the

00:00:58.109 --> 00:01:00.619 
you throttle on the on the remote the

00:01:00.619 --> 00:01:00.629

weighing 55 grams in total obviously

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:07.760 
weighing 55 grams in total obviously
they<00:01:06.330> don't<00:01:06.450> like<00:01:06.659> to<00:01:06.810> fly<00:01:06.990> in<00:01:07.020> too<00:01:07.320> much<00:01:07.439> wind

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
they don't like to fly in too much wind

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:09.679 
they don't like to fly in too much wind
so<00:01:08.250> they're<00:01:08.400> designed<00:01:08.700> for<00:01:08.790> a<00:01:08.939> really<00:01:09.479> calm

00:01:09.679 --> 00:01:09.689 
so they're designed for a really calm

00:01:09.689 --> 00:01:11.660 
so they're designed for a really calm
day<00:01:09.930> or<00:01:10.200> even<00:01:10.650> indoor<00:01:11.100> flying<00:01:11.369> if<00:01:11.549> you're

day or even indoor flying if you're

00:01:11.670 --> 00:01:13.910 
day or even indoor flying if you're
lucky<00:01:11.790> enough<00:01:11.939> to<00:01:12.210> have<00:01:12.270> a<00:01:12.330> big<00:01:12.540> space<00:01:12.920> these

00:01:39.890 --> 00:01:39.900 
on open throttle with these so that's

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:41.539
