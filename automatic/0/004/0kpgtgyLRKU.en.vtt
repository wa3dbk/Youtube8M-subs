all right so here we have completed a
very<00:00:03.360> simple<00:00:03.720> application<00:00:04.069> we've<00:00:05.069> got<00:00:05.250> a

00:00:05.269 --> 00:00:05.279 
very simple application we've got a

00:00:05.279 --> 00:00:07.970 
very simple application we've got a
button<00:00:05.549> we<00:00:06.390> click<00:00:06.629> that<00:00:06.750> button<00:00:07.049> and<00:00:07.830> it

00:00:07.970 --> 00:00:07.980 
button we click that button and it

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:09.980 
button we click that button and it
changes<00:00:08.280> the<00:00:08.490> label<00:00:08.880> we've<00:00:09.120> added<00:00:09.330> at<00:00:09.540> some

00:00:09.980 --> 00:00:09.990 
changes the label we've added at some

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:12.919 
changes the label we've added at some
simple<00:00:10.679> ActionScript<00:00:11.509> the<00:00:12.509> next<00:00:12.690> thing<00:00:12.809> we

00:00:12.919 --> 00:00:12.929 
simple ActionScript the next thing we

00:00:12.929 --> 00:00:16.310 
simple ActionScript the next thing we
want<00:00:12.960> to<00:00:13.110> do<00:00:13.259> is<00:00:13.500> we<00:00:14.070> want<00:00:14.340> to<00:00:14.610> run<00:00:15.540> this<00:00:15.750> on<00:00:16.109> the

00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:16.320 
want to do is we want to run this on the

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:18.500 
want to do is we want to run this on the
desktop<00:00:16.740> and<00:00:16.980> we<00:00:17.609> want<00:00:17.789> to<00:00:17.850> see<00:00:18.000> how<00:00:18.180> it<00:00:18.300> looks

00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:18.510 
desktop and we want to see how it looks

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.420 
desktop and we want to see how it looks
before<00:00:18.900> we<00:00:18.990> put<00:00:19.170> it<00:00:19.230> onto<00:00:19.350> the<00:00:19.529> device<00:00:19.619> so

00:00:20.420 --> 00:00:20.430 
before we put it onto the device so

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:22.010 
before we put it onto the device so
we're<00:00:20.640> going<00:00:20.820> to<00:00:20.939> look<00:00:21.300> at<00:00:21.480> what<00:00:21.779> they<00:00:21.900> call

apps running in your project you have it

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.240 
apps running in your project you have it
listed<00:00:48.840> here<00:00:49.320> they<00:00:49.590> would<00:00:49.710> show<00:00:49.860> up<00:00:49.890> here<00:00:50.190> as

we're<00:00:53.160> doing<00:00:53.190> is<00:00:53.699> telling<00:00:54.030> a<00:00:54.870> Flash<00:00:55.530> Builder

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:55.770 
we're doing is telling a Flash Builder

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:58.819 
we're doing is telling a Flash Builder
how<00:00:56.219> we<00:00:56.280> want<00:00:56.699> it<00:00:56.820> to<00:00:57.030> run<00:00:57.600> this<00:00:57.989> app<00:00:58.230> and<00:00:58.530> it's

00:00:58.819 --> 00:00:58.829 
how we want it to run this app and it's

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:02.209 
how we want it to run this app and it's
running<00:00:59.579> this<00:00:59.820> particular<00:01:00.390> EM<00:01:01.199> XML<00:01:01.590> file<00:01:01.829> on

this platform and we want it to run on

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.070 
this platform and we want it to run on
the<00:01:05.580> desktop<00:01:06.030> so<00:01:06.659> we're<00:01:06.750> going<00:01:06.840> to<00:01:06.900> go<00:01:06.990> ahead

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:07.080 
the desktop so we're going to go ahead

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:09.440 
the desktop so we're going to go ahead
and<00:01:07.500> it<00:01:08.369> wants<00:01:08.640> us<00:01:08.729> we<00:01:08.939> want<00:01:09.090> to<00:01:09.150> choose<00:01:09.420> a

and it wants us we want to choose a
device<00:01:09.780> to<00:01:10.350> simulate<00:01:10.770> so<00:01:11.310> I'm<00:01:11.430> going<00:01:11.580> to

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
device to simulate so I'm going to

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:14.030 
device to simulate so I'm going to
simulate<00:01:11.850> the<00:01:12.180> Motorola<00:01:12.659> Droid<00:01:12.869> 2<00:01:13.470> which<00:01:13.860> is

00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:14.040 
simulate the Motorola Droid 2 which is

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:19.030 
simulate the Motorola Droid 2 which is
the<00:01:14.850> one<00:01:15.000> that<00:01:15.090> I<00:01:15.150> have<00:01:15.450> and<00:01:16.820> under<00:01:17.820> configure

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:19.040 
the one that I have and under configure

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.120 
the one that I have and under configure
there<00:01:20.040> are<00:01:20.580> a<00:01:20.850> whole<00:01:21.180> list<00:01:21.570> of<00:01:22.130> possible

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:23.130 
there are a whole list of possible

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.880 
there are a whole list of possible
devices<00:01:23.700> and<00:01:24.060> these<00:01:24.270> are<00:01:24.450> things<00:01:24.630> that<00:01:24.890> are

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:25.890 
devices and these are things that are

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:28.219 
devices and these are things that are
included<00:01:26.400> here<00:01:26.549> you<00:01:26.610> can<00:01:26.880> obviously<00:01:27.479> add<00:01:27.960> your

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229 
included here you can obviously add your

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:31.819 
included here you can obviously add your
own<00:01:28.939> notice<00:01:29.939> that<00:01:30.119> we<00:01:30.240> have<00:01:30.390> the<00:01:30.570> platform<00:01:30.829> the

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
own notice that we have the platform the

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:34.880 
own notice that we have the platform the
full<00:01:32.220> screen<00:01:32.490> size<00:01:32.820> usable<00:01:33.390> skies<00:01:33.689> all<00:01:34.500> sorts

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890 
full screen size usable skies all sorts

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:37.609 
full screen size usable skies all sorts
of<00:01:35.009> information<00:01:35.579> and<00:01:35.790> so<00:01:36.299> we<00:01:37.020> here<00:01:37.259> we<00:01:37.380> have

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
of information and so we here we have

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.819 
of information and so we here we have
the<00:01:38.100> pixels<00:01:38.729> per<00:01:38.909> inch<00:01:38.960> that<00:01:39.960> allows<00:01:40.530> us<00:01:40.560> to

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
the pixels per inch that allows us to

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:44.210 
the pixels per inch that allows us to
the<00:01:41.400> density<00:01:41.970> that<00:01:42.780> we<00:01:42.960> talked<00:01:43.320> about<00:01:43.470> and<00:01:43.860> so

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:44.220 
the density that we talked about and so

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.830 
the density that we talked about and so
this<00:01:44.430> is<00:01:44.579> stuff<00:01:45.210> that<00:01:45.240> you<00:01:45.390> can<00:01:45.509> go<00:01:45.600> ahead<00:01:45.720> and

00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:45.840 
this is stuff that you can go ahead and

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.090 
this is stuff that you can go ahead and
create<00:01:46.850> to<00:01:47.850> facilitate<00:01:48.979> simulating<00:01:49.979> the

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:50.100 
create to facilitate simulating the

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:51.660 
create to facilitate simulating the
devices

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:51.670 
devices

00:01:51.670 --> 00:01:55.050 
devices
so<00:01:52.270> we've<00:01:52.810> got<00:01:53.050> the<00:01:53.170> Motorola<00:01:53.530> Droid<00:01:53.590> 2<00:01:54.070> and<00:01:54.550> at

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:55.060 
so we've got the Motorola Droid 2 and at

00:01:55.060 --> 00:01:56.310 
so we've got the Motorola Droid 2 and at
this<00:01:55.150> point<00:01:55.420> we're<00:01:55.630> gonna<00:01:55.690> go<00:01:55.930> ahead<00:01:56.110> and

00:01:56.310 --> 00:01:56.320 
this point we're gonna go ahead and

00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:59.550 
this point we're gonna go ahead and
choose<00:01:56.500> run<00:01:57.870> now<00:01:58.870> what<00:01:59.020> it<00:01:59.110> does<00:01:59.260> is<00:01:59.440> it

00:01:59.550 --> 00:01:59.560 
choose run now what it does is it

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:03.359 
choose run now what it does is it
launches<00:02:00.010> the<00:02:00.640> ADL<00:02:01.390> which<00:02:01.630> is<00:02:01.869> the<00:02:02.250> what<00:02:03.250> is

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:03.369 
launches the ADL which is the what is

00:02:03.369 --> 00:02:05.180 
launches the ADL which is the what is
that<00:02:03.580> what<00:02:04.060> is<00:02:04.090> the<00:02:04.300> ADL

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:05.190 
that what is the ADL

00:02:05.190 --> 00:02:08.760 
that what is the ADL
it's<00:02:06.190> the<00:02:06.400> ADL<00:02:06.790> well<00:02:07.119> of<00:02:07.210> course<00:02:07.240> I<00:02:07.840> believe

00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:08.770 
it's the ADL well of course I believe

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:13.370 
it's the ADL well of course I believe
it's<00:02:09.250> what<00:02:09.580> is<00:02:09.700> it<00:02:09.729> the<00:02:10.030> Arnold<00:02:11.550> development

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380 
it's what is it the Arnold development

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:19.949 
it's what is it the Arnold development
library<00:02:15.209> no<00:02:16.209> I<00:02:16.240> know<00:02:16.810> it's<00:02:17.170> gotta<00:02:17.380> be<00:02:18.959> Apple

00:02:19.949 --> 00:02:19.959 
library no I know it's gotta be Apple

00:02:19.959 --> 00:02:22.770 
library no I know it's gotta be Apple
doesn't<00:02:20.440> like<00:02:21.040> you<00:02:21.340> know<00:02:22.000> there's<00:02:22.390> just<00:02:22.630> too

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780 
doesn't like you know there's just too

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:27.020 
doesn't like you know there's just too
many<00:02:22.900> words<00:02:23.260> I<00:02:24.120> think<00:02:25.120> it's<00:02:25.239> the<00:02:25.360> air<00:02:25.890> debug

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:27.030 
many words I think it's the air debug

00:02:27.030 --> 00:02:30.060 
many words I think it's the air debug
launcher<00:02:28.110> yeah<00:02:29.110> yeah<00:02:29.380> I<00:02:29.410> think<00:02:29.620> that's<00:02:29.920> what

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:30.070 
launcher yeah yeah I think that's what

00:02:30.070 --> 00:02:30.420 
launcher yeah yeah I think that's what
it<00:02:30.160> is

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:30.430 
it is

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:33.810 
it is
what<00:02:30.910> does<00:02:31.030> it<00:02:31.120> says<00:02:31.239> debug<00:02:31.830> all<00:02:32.830> right<00:02:32.980> so<00:02:33.700> we

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:33.820 
what does it says debug all right so we

00:02:33.820 --> 00:02:35.250 
what does it says debug all right so we
have<00:02:34.120> our<00:02:34.269> button<00:02:34.450> now<00:02:34.660> what<00:02:34.840> did<00:02:34.959> remember

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260 
have our button now what did remember

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.550 
have our button now what did remember
what<00:02:35.500> we<00:02:35.620> said<00:02:35.890> we<00:02:36.459> click<00:02:36.670> the<00:02:36.820> button

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:37.560 
what we said we click the button

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:42.449 
what we said we click the button
hey<00:02:38.560> hey<00:02:38.769> Brad<00:02:39.550> what's<00:02:39.910> up<00:02:40.150> oh<00:02:41.340> look<00:02:42.340> at<00:02:42.430> that

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:42.459 
hey hey Brad what's up oh look at that

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:43.759 
hey hey Brad what's up oh look at that
see<00:02:42.730> I<00:02:42.820> spelled<00:02:43.150> it<00:02:43.239> wrong

00:02:43.759 --> 00:02:43.769 
see I spelled it wrong

00:02:43.769 --> 00:02:47.280 
see I spelled it wrong
obviously<00:02:44.769> I<00:02:45.220> don't<00:02:46.150> have<00:02:46.239> enough<00:02:46.510> use<00:02:46.840> cuz

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:47.290 
obviously I don't have enough use cuz

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:52.400 
obviously I don't have enough use cuz
that's<00:02:47.739> was<00:02:48.160> up<00:02:49.260> what<00:02:50.260> we<00:02:50.380> want<00:02:50.560> is<00:02:50.680> was<00:02:50.860> uh

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410 
that's was up what we want is was uh

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:54.180 
that's was up what we want is was uh
well<00:02:53.410> we<00:02:53.500> can<00:02:53.620> fix<00:02:53.769> that

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:54.190 
well we can fix that

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:57.509 
well we can fix that
notice<00:02:55.150> here<00:02:55.709> we<00:02:56.709> do<00:02:56.890> have<00:02:57.010> some<00:02:57.220> things<00:02:57.400> we

00:02:57.509 --> 00:02:57.519 
notice here we do have some things we

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:01.819 
notice here we do have some things we
can<00:02:57.670> simulate<00:02:58.570> so<00:02:58.989> if<00:02:59.140> we<00:02:59.380> rotate<00:03:00.010> left<00:03:00.579> or

00:03:01.819 --> 00:03:01.829 
can simulate so if we rotate left or

00:03:01.829 --> 00:03:04.860 
can simulate so if we rotate left or
rotate<00:03:02.829> right<00:03:03.269> it'll<00:03:04.269> change<00:03:04.480> the<00:03:04.600> landscape

00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:04.870 
rotate right it'll change the landscape

00:03:04.870 --> 00:03:07.229 
rotate right it'll change the landscape
also<00:03:05.440> we<00:03:05.560> can<00:03:05.680> simulate<00:03:05.950> the<00:03:06.370> back<00:03:06.610> button<00:03:07.030> the

00:03:07.229 --> 00:03:07.239 
also we can simulate the back button the

00:03:07.239 --> 00:03:09.750 
also we can simulate the back button the
menu<00:03:07.480> button<00:03:07.810> search<00:03:08.320> button<00:03:08.680> that<00:03:09.519> way<00:03:09.700> you

00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:09.760 
menu button search button that way you

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.660 
menu button search button that way you
kind<00:03:10.090> of<00:03:10.209> test<00:03:10.450> your<00:03:11.079> code<00:03:11.260> but<00:03:11.950> again<00:03:12.190> what

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:12.670 
kind of test your code but again what

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:13.920 
kind of test your code but again what
you're<00:03:12.820> doing<00:03:13.150> is<00:03:13.299> running<00:03:13.510> it<00:03:13.720> on<00:03:13.810> the

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:13.930 
you're doing is running it on the

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:15.330 
you're doing is running it on the
desktop<00:03:14.320> and<00:03:14.530> you're<00:03:14.650> just<00:03:14.890> kind<00:03:15.190> of

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:15.340 
desktop and you're just kind of

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:18.060 
desktop and you're just kind of
simulating<00:03:15.970> it<00:03:16.060> and<00:03:16.269> it<00:03:16.810> does<00:03:17.140> not<00:03:17.170> make<00:03:17.860> up

00:03:18.060 --> 00:03:18.070 
simulating it and it does not make up

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:20.009 
simulating it and it does not make up
for<00:03:18.100> having<00:03:18.400> on<00:03:18.700> a<00:03:18.730> real<00:03:19.030> device<00:03:19.239> so<00:03:19.690> keep<00:03:19.870> that

00:03:20.009 --> 00:03:20.019 
for having on a real device so keep that

00:03:20.019 --> 00:03:21.330 
for having on a real device so keep that
in<00:03:20.079> mind<00:03:20.200> you<00:03:20.440> really<00:03:20.530> want<00:03:20.920> to<00:03:20.980> have<00:03:21.100> it<00:03:21.220> on<00:03:21.280> a

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:21.340 
in mind you really want to have it on a

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:24.630 
in mind you really want to have it on a
device<00:03:21.640> all<00:03:22.630> right<00:03:22.780> go<00:03:22.930> ahead<00:03:22.959> and<00:03:23.140> click<00:03:23.640> that

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:24.640 
device all right go ahead and click that

00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:27.330 
device all right go ahead and click that
and<00:03:24.700> close<00:03:25.180> it<00:03:25.390> now<00:03:25.890> what<00:03:26.890> we've<00:03:27.040> done<00:03:27.190> is
