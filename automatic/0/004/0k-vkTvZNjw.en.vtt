the reason but three I mean well I
couldn't<00:01:39.960> get<00:01:40.289> out<00:01:40.380> of<00:01:40.560> the<00:01:40.649> tidal<00:01:41.130> wave<00:01:41.280> with

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
couldn't get out of the tidal wave with

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:43.580 
couldn't get out of the tidal wave with
the<00:01:41.880> breath<00:01:42.720> going<00:01:43.080> and<00:01:43.229> wipe<00:01:43.380> the<00:01:43.530> entire

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:43.590 
the breath going and wipe the entire

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:52.240 
the breath going and wipe the entire
rate<00:01:44.039> or<00:01:48.409> so<00:01:49.409> all<00:01:49.649> right<00:01:49.740> watch<00:01:50.130> out<00:01:50.340> tight

00:01:52.240 --> 00:01:52.250 
rate or so all right watch out tight

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:57.520 
rate or so all right watch out tight
what<00:01:53.250> you<00:01:53.369> died<00:01:55.159> way<00:01:56.159> too<00:01:56.190> early

doing a necrotic breath on the tidal
wave<00:02:00.929> uh<00:02:01.399> I<00:02:02.399> could<00:02:02.700> move<00:02:03.390> to<00:02:03.569> get<00:02:03.720> out<00:02:03.929> the

00:02:04.399 --> 00:02:04.409 
wave uh I could move to get out the

00:02:04.409 --> 00:02:06.680 
wave uh I could move to get out the
section<00:02:05.069> if<00:02:05.429> he's<00:02:05.610> breathing<00:02:05.880> through<00:02:06.630> the

00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:06.690 
section if he's breathing through the

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:09.109 
section if he's breathing through the
direction<00:02:07.110> of<00:02:07.140> the<00:02:08.100> wave<00:02:08.489> didn't<00:02:08.880> go<00:02:08.970> the

00:02:09.109 --> 00:02:09.119 
direction of the wave didn't go the

00:02:09.119 --> 00:02:11.300 
direction of the wave didn't go the
other<00:02:09.209> way<00:02:09.330> no<00:02:10.049> you<00:02:10.110> don't<00:02:10.380> move<00:02:10.739> either<00:02:11.009> way

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:11.310 
other way no you don't move either way

other way no you don't move either way
you<00:02:11.370> move<00:02:11.700> back<00:02:12.030> it<00:02:12.660> wasn't<00:02:12.989> a<00:02:13.140> win-win

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:13.500 
you move back it wasn't a win-win

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:15.650 
you move back it wasn't a win-win
situation<00:02:13.680> Beach<00:02:14.310> on<00:02:14.519> that<00:02:14.700> one<00:02:14.850> you<00:02:15.299> could

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:15.660 
situation Beach on that one you could

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:17.240 
situation Beach on that one you could
have<00:02:15.810> not<00:02:16.019> gone<00:02:16.230> in<00:02:16.410> by<00:02:16.530> the<00:02:16.590> way<00:02:16.769> if<00:02:17.040> you<00:02:17.130> have

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:17.250 
have not gone in by the way if you have

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:18.860 
have not gone in by the way if you have
moved<00:02:17.489> away<00:02:17.610> the<00:02:18.060> same<00:02:18.360> direction<00:02:18.510> the<00:02:18.750> wave

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:18.870 
moved away the same direction the wave

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:22.970 
moved away the same direction the wave
move<00:02:21.109> biggest<00:02:22.109> people<00:02:22.200> would<00:02:22.380> get<00:02:22.500> that<00:02:22.709> gives

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:22.980 
move biggest people would get that gives

00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:24.650 
move biggest people would get that gives
people<00:02:23.100> time<00:02:23.220> to<00:02:23.370> get<00:02:23.549> out<00:02:23.700> of<00:02:23.820> breath<00:02:24.209> range

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:24.660 
people time to get out of breath range

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.150 
people time to get out of breath range
and<00:02:24.989> then<00:02:25.079> you<00:02:25.200> would<00:02:25.320> ever<00:02:25.440> see<00:02:25.560> many<00:02:26.070> people

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:26.160
