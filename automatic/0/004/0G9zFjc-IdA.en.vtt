00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:09.960
 dekra is an international one 

00:00:07.639 --> 00:00:12.259
 audit organizations since 1925 

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:14.160
 since its founding in berlin around the 

00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:17.430
 technical safety of vehicles 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.460
 takes care of and dekra academy part area 

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:22.910
 the group is forming today 

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:25.170
 fleet manager and also motorists 

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:27.510
 my name is program 

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.880
 driving instructor 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.590
 trainer at dekra mainly 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:35.790
 I train safety and 

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:37.530
 economy over roads to 

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:40.140
 At the beginning of the test, I was actually very 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:42.090
 very skeptical because I have 7.2 liters 

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:43.290
 average consumption at my 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:45.390
 actually already on 

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.719
 Excellent value as a reference value 

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:50.399
 But court had after this short 

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:54.559
 I became a better test phase 

00:00:50.399 --> 00:00:57.390
 instructed and now I'm fine 

00:00:54.559 --> 00:01:01.070
 almost even two liters of 1 8-liter 

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:05.100
 Saved by the extension 

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:08.189
 optimized by whether you drive 360 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:13.080
 and i had to rejoice anja i am proud 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:15.390
 on what I found most important was 

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:16.650
 actually always the hints in the and 

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:18.420
 There is one distance 

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.450
 speed limit because then 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:22.710
 So you could really do his driving style 

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:24.960
 looking ahead accordingly 

00:01:22.710 --> 00:01:26.340
 so you do not adapt 

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.159
 only the environment through less 

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:30.990
 fuel consumption but also that 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:34.100
 vehicle brakes are swung 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:36.720
 ton on but after the test I am of it 

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:39.000
 so convinced that if the 

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:41.340
 360 can continue to use 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.920
 because that's really the optimum thing 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:46.200
 I ask for myself so far 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:48.950
 I drove out and I want that 

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.950
 also maintained 

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.610
 for fleets is likely 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:56.890
 be interesting that both the driver 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:58.360
 and the fleet manager together 

00:01:56.890 --> 00:02:00.729
 The data can look and together 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:01.170
 working on optimization potential 

00:02:00.729 --> 00:02:03.220
 can 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:06.490
 normally everyone would have to 

00:02:03.220 --> 00:02:09.659
 Fleet manager say comes at the new car 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:09.659
 renounced the navi of the tree
