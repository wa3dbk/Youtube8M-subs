when<00:02:48.180> they<00:02:48.299> come<00:02:48.480> up<00:02:48.689> now<00:02:49.560> you<00:02:49.620> will<00:02:49.859> save<00:02:50.099> a

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.250 
when they come up now you will save a

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:51.830 
when they come up now you will save a
truckload<00:02:50.609> of<00:02:50.849> money<00:02:51.120> if<00:02:51.299> you<00:02:51.389> decide<00:02:51.689> to

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:51.840 
truckload of money if you decide to

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.119 
truckload of money if you decide to
build<00:02:52.019> and<00:02:52.349> so<00:02:52.470> that's<00:02:52.620> kind<00:02:52.859> of<00:02:52.889> what<00:02:53.040> this

00:02:53.119 --> 00:02:53.129 
build and so that's kind of what this

00:02:53.129 --> 00:02:55.250 
build and so that's kind of what this
video<00:02:53.430> is<00:02:53.489> addressing<00:02:54.480> is<00:02:54.750> it<00:02:55.049> worth<00:02:55.200> buying

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.260 
video is addressing is it worth buying

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.409 
video is addressing is it worth buying
or<00:02:55.859> not<00:02:55.919> well<00:02:56.280> it<00:02:56.340> depends<00:02:56.700> on<00:02:56.849> buying<00:02:57.299> her

00:02:57.409 --> 00:02:57.419 
or not well it depends on buying her

00:02:57.419 --> 00:02:59.300 
or not well it depends on buying her
building<00:02:57.750> it<00:02:57.930> depends<00:02:58.560> on<00:02:58.680> the<00:02:58.829> person<00:02:59.219> you

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
building it depends on the person you

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.849 
building it depends on the person you
are<00:02:59.810> personally<00:03:00.810> I<00:03:00.959> think<00:03:01.049> everybody<00:03:01.769> should

00:03:01.849 --> 00:03:01.859 
are personally I think everybody should

00:03:01.859 --> 00:03:03.589 
are personally I think everybody should
build<00:03:02.189> a<00:03:02.310> computer<00:03:02.579> at<00:03:02.790> least<00:03:02.969> one<00:03:03.209> time<00:03:03.419> in

00:03:03.589 --> 00:03:03.599 
build a computer at least one time in

00:03:03.599 --> 00:03:05.300 
build a computer at least one time in
their<00:03:03.719> lives<00:03:03.900> because<00:03:04.290> it<00:03:04.650> is<00:03:04.769> a<00:03:04.799> fun<00:03:05.129> and

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:05.310 
their lives because it is a fun and

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:07.699 
their lives because it is a fun and
rewarding<00:03:05.489> experience<00:03:06.419> and<00:03:06.659> I<00:03:07.379> think<00:03:07.560> once

00:03:07.699 --> 00:03:07.709 
rewarding experience and I think once

00:03:07.709 --> 00:03:09.319 
rewarding experience and I think once
you've<00:03:07.829> done<00:03:08.040> it<00:03:08.159> once<00:03:08.370> you<00:03:08.760> realize<00:03:09.180> how<00:03:09.299> easy

00:03:09.319 --> 00:03:09.329 
you've done it once you realize how easy

00:03:09.329 --> 00:03:12.140 
you've done it once you realize how easy
it<00:03:09.810> is<00:03:09.900> to<00:03:09.959> do<00:03:10.230> it<00:03:10.379> plenty<00:03:11.370> of<00:03:11.459> resources<00:03:11.790> out

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
it is to do it plenty of resources out

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.449 
it is to do it plenty of resources out
there<00:03:12.209> on<00:03:12.540> how<00:03:12.659> to<00:03:12.719> build<00:03:12.900> a<00:03:13.079> computer<00:03:13.459> plenty

00:03:16.129 --> 00:03:16.139 
of places to research how to do certain

00:03:16.139 --> 00:03:18.349 
of places to research how to do certain
things<00:03:16.319> and<00:03:16.889> for<00:03:17.370> the<00:03:17.459> most<00:03:17.609> part<00:03:17.760> computers

00:03:18.349 --> 00:03:18.359

things and for the most part computers
really<00:03:18.750> once<00:03:18.959> you've<00:03:19.079> picked<00:03:19.319> out<00:03:19.530> the

really once you've picked out the

00:03:19.739 --> 00:03:21.849 
really once you've picked out the
hardware<00:03:20.010> bought<00:03:20.430> it<00:03:20.579> they<00:03:20.909> go<00:03:21.060> together<00:03:21.209> like

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:21.859 
hardware bought it they go together like

00:03:21.859 --> 00:03:24.589 
hardware bought it they go together like
easier<00:03:22.859> than<00:03:23.040> Legos<00:03:23.459> like<00:03:23.940> everything<00:03:24.389> only

00:03:24.589 --> 00:03:24.599 
easier than Legos like everything only

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:27.020 
easier than Legos like everything only

with manuals they all come with guides

00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:41.809 
with manuals they all come with guides
it'll<00:03:39.930> be<00:03:39.989> a<00:03:40.019> learning<00:03:40.260> experience<00:03:40.500> he<00:03:41.040> s<00:03:41.220> the

00:03:41.809 --> 00:03:41.819 
it'll be a learning experience he s the

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:42.830 
it'll be a learning experience he s the
hardest<00:03:42.180> parts<00:03:42.359> probably<00:03:42.599> going<00:03:42.720> to<00:03:42.780> be

00:03:42.830 --> 00:03:42.840 
hardest parts probably going to be

00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.539 
hardest parts probably going to be
installing<00:03:43.019> the<00:03:43.259> processor<00:03:43.979> and<00:03:44.129> anymore

00:03:44.539 --> 00:03:44.549 
installing the processor and anymore

00:03:44.549 --> 00:03:46.789 
installing the processor and anymore
they've<00:03:44.879> pretty<00:03:45.599> much<00:03:45.689> streamlined<00:03:46.530> that

00:03:46.789 --> 00:03:46.799 
they've pretty much streamlined that

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:48.830 
they've pretty much streamlined that
whole<00:03:46.979> process<00:03:47.359> so<00:03:48.359> that's<00:03:48.509> all<00:03:48.659> there<00:03:48.810> is

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:48.840 
whole process so that's all there is

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:50.860 
whole process so that's all there is
this<00:03:49.049> video<00:03:49.319> yes<00:03:49.650> I'd<00:03:49.859> say<00:03:49.889> it<00:03:50.159> is<00:03:50.250> extremely

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:50.870 
this video yes I'd say it is extremely

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:53.719 
this video yes I'd say it is extremely
it<00:03:51.870> is<00:03:52.049> much<00:03:52.259> better<00:03:52.290> to<00:03:52.650> build<00:03:53.009> than<00:03:53.340> it<00:03:53.459> is<00:03:53.579> to

00:03:53.719 --> 00:03:53.729 
it is much better to build than it is to

00:03:53.729 --> 00:03:55.189 
it is much better to build than it is to
buy<00:03:53.909> but<00:03:54.239> that<00:03:54.389> really<00:03:54.509> kind<00:03:54.720> of<00:03:54.840> depends<00:03:55.139> on

00:03:55.189 --> 00:03:55.199 
buy but that really kind of depends on

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:57.649 
buy but that really kind of depends on
the<00:03:55.319> person<00:03:55.680> you<00:03:55.769> are<00:03:55.799> so<00:03:56.280> I<00:03:56.549> got<00:03:57.060> that<00:03:57.209> typical

00:03:57.649 --> 00:03:57.659 
the person you are so I got that typical

00:03:57.659 --> 00:04:01.069 
the person you are so I got that typical
IT<00:03:57.840> answer<00:03:58.319> yes<00:03:58.560> but<00:03:58.769> no<00:03:59.030> is<00:04:00.030> it<00:04:00.120> a<00:04:00.299> which<00:04:00.900> one's

00:04:01.069 --> 00:04:01.079 
IT answer yes but no is it a which one's

00:04:01.079 --> 00:04:03.920 
IT answer yes but no is it a which one's
better<00:04:01.290> yes<00:04:01.799> I<00:04:02.269> mean<00:04:03.269> it<00:04:03.359> really<00:04:03.479> depends<00:04:03.870> on

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930 
better yes I mean it really depends on

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:05.839 
better yes I mean it really depends on
who<00:04:04.049> you<00:04:04.169> are<00:04:04.349> what<00:04:04.560> you<00:04:04.650> want<00:04:04.829> to<00:04:04.919> do<00:04:05.040> I<00:04:05.250> always

who you are what you want to do I always
opt<00:04:06.120> for<00:04:06.299> building<00:04:06.629> because<00:04:06.959> there's<00:04:07.199> just<00:04:07.259> a

00:04:07.429 --> 00:04:07.439 
opt for building because there's just a

00:04:07.439 --> 00:04:09.890 
opt for building because there's just a
lot<00:04:07.590> more<00:04:07.650> benefits<00:04:08.340> in<00:04:08.489> my<00:04:08.639> opinion<00:04:08.909> so

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:09.900 
lot more benefits in my opinion so
