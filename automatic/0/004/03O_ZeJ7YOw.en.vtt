00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:19.830
 Hello everyone today in the tips section on 

00:00:19.110 --> 00:00:22.740
 everyday 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:25.550
 super advice on how to feel the broadest 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:29.580
 muscles when you perform pulling 

00:00:25.550 --> 00:00:32.610
 either the upper block to the chest so and 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:36.059
 behind the head the main mistake which 

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:38.670
 do it all wrong and self 

00:00:36.059 --> 00:00:41.010
 performing movements first need 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:43.559
 perform the movement of the elbows as if you 

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:46.140
 sandwiched between two planes I'm about it 

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:48.510
 always say no swinging 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:52.309
 Thorson here such here when people almost 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:54.629
 don't lie horizontally it's all nonsense 

00:00:52.309 --> 00:00:56.519
 which has nothing to do with 

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:59.070
 pumping your widest muscles 

00:00:56.519 --> 00:01:01.799
 to feel and to really 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:04.409
 it is necessary to pump over the broadest muscles 

00:01:01.799 --> 00:01:07.530
 perform the whole movement elbows dropping 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:11.130
 elbows are clearly down bringing the shoulder blades together a 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:13.530
 now look and that you are nowhere else 

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:17.430
 won't see how to learn to feel it 

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:21.270
 perfect movement we look for it to us 

00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:25.320
 need to lie on the floor raise your hands 

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:27.570
 up and now imagine that you either 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:31.679
 hold the crossbar or hold 

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:33.539
 for the handle of the upper block and see 

00:01:31.679 --> 00:01:37.530
 we bring the shoulder blades together 

00:01:33.539 --> 00:01:39.170
 lowering your elbows down try and you 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.840
 feel that you are a lifetime 

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:45.600
 trained wrong here 

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:49.159
 just reducing shovels and dropping your elbows down 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:51.920
 you will feel how your work 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:55.469
 the broadest muscles 

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:57.390
 practice at home for a day or two a week 

00:01:55.469 --> 00:02:00.569
 how much will you need for that 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:03.240
 so that the body remembers and learns 

00:02:00.569 --> 00:02:05.159
 correct execution of movements all 

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:05.500
 the rest will only take your 

00:02:05.159 --> 00:02:09.930
 time 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:09.930
 on forces wasted bye
