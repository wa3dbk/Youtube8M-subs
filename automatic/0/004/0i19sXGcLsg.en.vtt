expected<00:00:48.480> anything<00:00:48.690> it<00:00:48.960> could<00:00:49.800> have<00:00:49.920> been<00:00:50.010> a

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:50.070 
expected anything it could have been a

00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:52.520 
expected anything it could have been a
draw<00:00:50.309> but<00:00:50.489> we<00:00:51.270> win<00:00:51.449> our<00:00:51.570> next<00:00:51.690> game<00:00:51.960> nothing<00:00:52.379> at
