00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:04.950 
open it to look at the screen anyway so

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:06.440 
open it to look at the screen anyway so
it<00:02:05.220> shouldn't<00:02:05.550> matter<00:02:05.640> but<00:02:05.940> it's<00:02:06.090> just<00:02:06.270> one

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:06.450 
it shouldn't matter but it's just one

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:08.359 
it shouldn't matter but it's just one
annoying<00:02:06.900> extra<00:02:07.350> step<00:02:07.710> that<00:02:07.740> I<00:02:07.950> have<00:02:08.099> to<00:02:08.250> do

00:02:08.359 --> 00:02:08.369 
annoying extra step that I have to do

00:02:08.369 --> 00:02:10.759 
annoying extra step that I have to do
each<00:02:08.550> time<00:02:08.909> as<00:02:09.149> you<00:02:09.720> see<00:02:09.899> here<00:02:10.110> the<00:02:10.259> camera<00:02:10.619> is

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:10.769 
each time as you see here the camera is

00:02:10.769 --> 00:02:13.580 
each time as you see here the camera is
fully<00:02:11.099> accessible<00:02:11.459> but<00:02:12.269> you<00:02:12.780> cannot<00:02:13.079> shut<00:02:13.379> the

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:13.590

good in the hand feel personally only

00:02:55.739 --> 00:02:57.259 
good in the hand feel personally only

00:02:57.259 --> 00:02:57.269

just<00:03:05.519> a<00:03:05.579> little<00:03:05.819> bit<00:03:05.970> too<00:03:06.090> difficult<00:03:06.569> it

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:06.720 
just a little bit too difficult it

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.539 
just a little bit too difficult it
should<00:03:06.900> be<00:03:07.079> a<00:03:07.109> lot<00:03:07.200> easier<00:03:07.560> than<00:03:07.859> what<00:03:08.190> you<00:03:08.340> see

00:03:08.539 --> 00:03:08.549 
should be a lot easier than what you see

00:03:08.549 --> 00:03:10.430 
should be a lot easier than what you see
in<00:03:08.700> the<00:03:08.819> video<00:03:09.120> but<00:03:09.450> it<00:03:09.659> took<00:03:09.840> me<00:03:09.900> a<00:03:10.079> little<00:03:10.319> bit

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:10.440 
in the video but it took me a little bit

00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:12.500 
in the video but it took me a little bit
of<00:03:10.620> time<00:03:11.190> and<00:03:11.489> a<00:03:11.519> little<00:03:11.639> bit<00:03:11.849> of<00:03:11.940> effort<00:03:12.269> just

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:12.510 
of time and a little bit of effort just

00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:14.360 
of time and a little bit of effort just
to<00:03:12.629> remove<00:03:12.959> it<00:03:13.109> from<00:03:13.230> the<00:03:13.319> plastic<00:03:13.829> material

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:14.370 
to remove it from the plastic material

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:16.640 
to remove it from the plastic material

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650 
within the portfolio style case itself I

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:18.229 
within the portfolio style case itself I
actually<00:03:17.129> thought<00:03:17.489> I<00:03:17.549> was<00:03:17.700> going<00:03:17.879> to<00:03:18.030> damage
