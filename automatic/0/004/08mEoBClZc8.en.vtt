00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:07.200
 hello I am today with Pauline 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.910
 gilbert laboratories 

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.679
 so ladies you have all 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.660
 necessarily a nail file in your 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:14.639
 bathroom but did you choose 

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.609
 the one that fits your type 

00:00:14.639 --> 00:00:19.650
 nails for that Pauline explains to you 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:21.990
 how to choose your nail file 

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.820
 look good there are different types 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.680
 nail gym is sometimes difficult 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.390
 to find it and so I'm going to 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:29.970
 explain how to choose it well 

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:34.770
 according to his type of nails he exists 

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:38.010
 files so like these 

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:39.809
 Antwerp limes have a finer grain more 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.030
 sweet so they are perfectly 

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:44.940
 suitable for nail care 

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:48.450
 natural and fine they have the advantage 

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:50.340
 to be almost indestructible just 

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:53.129
 clean them with water and soap 

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:55.530
 to reuse them indefinitely then 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:56.940
 you have the cardboard files it's the 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.440
 more prevalent the one you go 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.350
 find it easier 

00:00:58.440 --> 00:01:03.989
 they usually have to face a phase 

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:07.049
 with thicker grains to give 

00:01:03.989 --> 00:01:09.869
 the shape and shorten the nail and a 

00:01:07.049 --> 00:01:12.600
 phase with finer grains for the 

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:15.150
 finishes this line can be used 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:16.290
 on natural nails and also on 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.580
 false nails 

00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.500
 the only drawback is that they 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:20.880
 suck faster and need to be 

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.979
 changed regularly 

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.340
 the third major category of lyme 

00:01:22.979 --> 00:01:28.799
 are the metal files 

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:30.689
 Selim are harder and more aggressive 

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:33.479
 so they really have to be reserved for 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:36.450
 false nails they are not recommended for 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:39.390
 natural nails with this type of lyme 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:41.250
 you risk damaging your nails and he 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:43.950
 risk of eventually splitting up to 

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:47.100
 reserve for false nails in gel or 

00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:49.680
 acrylic always limay the nail in the 

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:52.320
 same meaning from the outside towards 

00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:54.840
 inside the shadow and also for 

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.689
 the feet specifically always the 

00:01:54.840 --> 00:02:01.070
 file in a square shape to avoid 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:01.070
 ingrown toenails
