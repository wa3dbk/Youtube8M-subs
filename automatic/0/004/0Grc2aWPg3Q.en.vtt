00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:10.080
 two 

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:11.849
 killer instinct one of the games of 

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.099
 most popular fight of the middle of the 

00:00:11.849 --> 00:00:15.869
 decade of the 90 reappears after more than 

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:19.550
 a decade of absence the new console 

00:00:15.869 --> 00:00:19.550
 from microsoft the xbox one 

00:00:25.850 --> 00:00:29.390
 The first thing we tell you about is 

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:31.520
 that it is a game that has been 

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:33.470
 released in digital format on xbox live 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:35.690
 following it is a system of certain form 

00:00:33.470 --> 00:00:38.510
 very similar to a free to play post 

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:40.430
 that your download is free is possible 

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:42.230
 play without any limitation to all your 

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:44.720
 game modes including multiplayer 

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:48.100
 online although we will only have 

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:48.100
 a single fighter to choose 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:58.120
 in this sense it includes the title of 

00:00:55.780 --> 00:01:00.160
 moment 6 characters although soon 

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:03.489
 will add another 2 thus making a total 

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:05.170
 of 8 having to pay 499 euros for 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:06.729
 every new additional fighter that 

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:08.979
 we want to unlock but also 

00:01:06.729 --> 00:01:13.540
 we can get all of them from one 

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:15.790
 once for 19.99 euros plus paying 39 

00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:17.619
 with 99 euros we would buy all the 

00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:20.200
 content of the game what covers 

00:01:17.619 --> 00:01:22.119
 characters costumes accessories and even 

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:25.149
 the arcade version of killer style 

00:01:22.119 --> 00:01:27.039
 original of the year 1994 so it 

00:01:25.149 --> 00:01:30.929
 I could say that the latter is the 

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:30.929
 authentic price of the complete game 

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:33.570
 do not 

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:39.380
 in relation to all this, it should be noted that 

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:41.570
 when playing we will be rewarded with a 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:43.369
 currency called killer points so 

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:44.869
 that with patience most of the 

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:47.060
 contents we will also be able to 

00:01:44.869 --> 00:01:48.920
 unlock without having to spend our 

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:50.689
 money in the game although this only 

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:52.610
 affects objects such as clothing 

00:01:50.689 --> 00:01:54.890
 accessory scenarios and other elements 

00:01:52.610 --> 00:01:56.570
 secondary since the fighters yes 

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:58.729
 you will always have to buy it with money 

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:00.649
 real except for the first of them 

00:01:58.729 --> 00:02:02.299
 that as we have advanced is the 

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:04.810
 unique gift that is given to us 

00:02:02.299 --> 00:02:04.810
 free 

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:13.160
 for its part with regard to the 

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:15.110
 modalities of game we will have three 

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:16.730
 options from which to choose the mode 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:19.190
 confrontation where we will dispute 

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:21.200
 individual battles either against a 

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:23.209
 friend from the same console or against the 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:24.860
 cpu or survival mode in which 

00:02:23.209 --> 00:02:26.900
 we have to endure as much as possible 

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.549
 defeating an opponent after another and 

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:30.620
 course the online mode in which 

00:02:28.549 --> 00:02:33.489
 we can challenge other players around 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:33.489
 the world through the internet 

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:45.470
 besides the game also lets them play 

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:46.640
 in the mode by me and in the mode 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:48.680
 training in which we can 

00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:50.390
 learn and practice the attacks of 

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.000
 characters and perfect our 

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:54.010
 technique 

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:55.990
 it has been announced that later on 

00:02:54.010 --> 00:02:57.330
 they will add other game modes like 

00:02:55.990 --> 00:03:01.890
 the arcade mode which inexplicably 

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:01.890
 it has not been included in the launch 

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:08.489
 sending the gameplay of this is 

00:03:06.659 --> 00:03:10.470
 keeps faithful to the spirit of killer and 

00:03:08.489 --> 00:03:12.239
 sting with a mechanics of the 

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:14.099
 fighting games in two dimensions of 

00:03:12.239 --> 00:03:15.569
 yesteryear but now everything is shown in 

00:03:14.099 --> 00:03:18.299
 three dimensions with a large 

00:03:15.569 --> 00:03:19.980
 visual spectacularity is a title 

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:22.019
 accessible from the beginning but very 

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:24.360
 deep in your combat system where 

00:03:22.019 --> 00:03:26.400
 the sweeps are not missing the grabs the 

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:28.290
 ultra combos or the breakers combos so 

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.970
 characteristic of the saga as well as 

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:31.769
 some new features like the new ones 

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:33.599
 shadow attacks which are 

00:03:31.769 --> 00:03:35.640
 Improved versions of the attacks 

00:03:33.599 --> 00:03:37.709
 specials that we can execute according to 

00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:39.930
 let's fill in the corresponding 

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:42.030
 energy bar or moving that 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:44.069
 for 15 seconds will allow us 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:46.609
 unleash a special skill for each 

00:03:44.069 --> 00:03:46.609
 fighter 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:55.540
 I think not 

00:03:56.730 --> 00:04:00.360
 passing the graphic section the game 

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:02.700
 it stands out above all for the great speed 

00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:04.920
 of the combats having these in all 

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:07.519
 moment an image rate of 60 

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:07.519
 frames per second 

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:15.730
 will show us some very solid characters 

00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:17.830
 and pretty well modeled whose bodies 

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:19.810
 are affected by lighting in 

00:04:17.830 --> 00:04:21.760
 real - time life too many 

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:23.290
 personalization objects with which 

00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:25.960
 modify the appearance of the fighters 

00:04:23.290 --> 00:04:27.580
 which we could be acquiring with 

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:31.290
 the killers as we get from 

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:31.290
 reward behind each combat 

00:04:31.969 --> 00:04:36.319
 For their part, the stadiums also have 

00:04:34.369 --> 00:04:38.569
 a good level of detail having six 

00:04:36.319 --> 00:04:41.289
 arenas of battle to choose one for 

00:04:38.569 --> 00:04:41.289
 each character 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.960
 the main negative point that we can 

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:51.850
 to blame him is that these are not 

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:53.620
 interactive, always staying in a 

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:56.080
 second plane what must be added that 

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:58.230
 the game is not shown at 1080p so 

00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:01.330
 native having to settle for 

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:03.040
 720p and a subsequent scaling something that 

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:06.930
 does not fit too much in a console 

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:06.930
 new generation as xbox web 

00:05:16.389 --> 00:05:20.810
 in summary killer instinct is a great 

00:05:19.069 --> 00:05:22.940
 fighting game that will definitely like to 

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:25.190
 the fans of the genre being one of 

00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:27.050
 the most expected returns and if you have 

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:29.210
 to pay to be able to get all the 

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:31.280
 party at its price of 20 euros for the 

00:05:29.210 --> 00:05:32.840
 Full pack of wrestlers is pretty 

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:34.759
 correct since that would be the cost 

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:38.349
 approximate of what is usually worth some 

00:05:34.759 --> 00:05:38.349
 of the games of xbox live arcade 

00:05:44.889 --> 00:05:48.639
 although on the negative side it has 

00:05:46.719 --> 00:05:50.620
 seemed too inconspicuous in terms of 

00:05:48.639 --> 00:05:52.659
 your content options since by 

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:54.610
 now and only six characters with whom 

00:05:52.659 --> 00:05:56.770
 play more two that are coming and 

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:58.419
 It also has little variety of modes of 

00:05:56.770 --> 00:06:00.639
 game so we will have to wait for that 

00:05:58.419 --> 00:06:02.770
 they are periodically launching new 

00:06:00.639 --> 00:06:04.659
 contents and more fighters with whom 

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:07.979
 gradually expanding iran 

00:06:04.659 --> 00:06:07.979
 title chances
