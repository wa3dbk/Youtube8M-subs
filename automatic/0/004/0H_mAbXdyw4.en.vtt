00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:53.449
 I gave his eyes the essential if they act well below the 

00:00:53.449 --> 00:00:56.229
 minimum inhibitory concentration of the concentration in new

00:01:02.449 --> 00:01:05.880
 Spokane antibiotics they were more than sensitive it's a bad cap 

00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:06.570
 Boundary

 the season is not programmed it's not easy 

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:30.440
 I'm still going to take a step in the field I told you about his 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.909

 to know more or less 

00:02:41.729 --> 00:02:43.679

 really interested in buying books 

00:02:57.519 --> 00:03:00.459
 and then when I saw the extraordinary results that's for sure 

00:03:00.459 --> 00:03:02.939
 the whole family because I started using them but really 

00:03:02.939 --> 00:03:06.139
 in small dose of inhalation diffusion and this case

 gaetan interested in music such as the only thing that worked 

00:03:10.839 --> 00:03:15.509
 So we decided to do a training and after% and I thought

 this is great you really need to know that it exists 

00:03:18.869 --> 00:03:21.949
 and that's why I'm trying to do workshops in general what is 

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:24.739
 what we do when we compare our child who would fall 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:28.409
 necessary that the knees bah one cleans the flashing rock but a

00:03:45.569 --> 00:03:48.319
 when one is accessible to all homes whose holes in all 

00:03:48.319 --> 00:03:51.819
 shops in all pharmacies and in most pharmacies people 

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:55.089
 buy but do not know how to use them in case of accident 

00:03:55.089 --> 00:03:56.089
 spectacular 

00:03:56.089 --> 00:03:59.809
 but from the moment we know how to use them and we know these 

00:03:59.809 --> 00:04:03.459
 Famous precautions for use and naproxen reprieve and the results are 

00:04:03.459 --> 00:04:06.519
 not extraordinary

 but everyone can have the axé and salute but the essential 

00:04:33.189 --> 00:04:35.349
 it's really extraordinary 

00:04:35.349 --> 00:04:37.099
 16% 

00:04:37.099 --> 00:04:39.719
