00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
aspects to leave that's in my opinion

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.270 
aspects to leave that's in my opinion
one<00:00:51.510> of<00:00:51.570> the<00:00:51.660> reasons<00:00:52.110> why<00:00:52.440> it's<00:00:52.649> so<00:00:52.800> much<00:00:52.980> fun

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:53.280 
one of the reasons why it's so much fun

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.279 
one of the reasons why it's so much fun
in<00:00:53.610> lane<00:00:53.879> for<00:00:54.059> example<00:00:54.510> you<00:00:54.539> have<00:00:54.809> to<00:00:55.079> think

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289 
in lane for example you have to think

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:57.410 
in lane for example you have to think
about<00:00:55.410> getting<00:00:55.559> CS<00:00:56.129> you<00:00:56.579> have<00:00:56.789> to<00:00:57.030> watch<00:00:57.210> the

enemy laner you have to watch the map
while<00:00:59.520> also<00:00:59.760> trying<00:00:59.940> to<00:01:00.210> harass<00:01:00.390> as<00:01:00.690> much<00:01:00.870> as

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.900 
while also trying to harass as much as
possible<00:01:01.260> now<00:01:01.980> that's<00:01:02.160> a<00:01:02.280> lot<00:01:02.460> to<00:01:02.489> think<00:01:02.640> about

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:02.910 
possible now that's a lot to think about

00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:05.329 
possible now that's a lot to think about
for<00:01:03.090> anyone<00:01:03.719> but<00:01:04.049> if<00:01:04.260> you<00:01:04.470> mean<00:01:04.680> a<00:01:04.710> champion

00:01:05.329 --> 00:01:05.339 
for anyone but if you mean a champion

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:07.280 
for anyone but if you mean a champion
then<00:01:05.700> you<00:01:05.939> know<00:01:06.180> exactly<00:01:06.510> how<00:01:06.900> much<00:01:07.020> damage

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:07.290 
then you know exactly how much damage

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.859 
then you know exactly how much damage
they<00:01:07.590> do<00:01:07.650> and<00:01:08.100> how<00:01:08.130> their<00:01:08.880> spells<00:01:09.150> work<00:01:09.450> so<00:01:09.810> you

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
they do and how their spells work so you

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.469 
they do and how their spells work so you
have<00:01:10.229> to<00:01:10.380> think<00:01:10.530> less<00:01:10.860> about<00:01:10.920> CS<00:01:11.549> and<00:01:11.820> harass

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479 
have to think less about CS and harass

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.270 
have to think less about CS and harass
and<00:01:12.810> you<00:01:13.020> can<00:01:13.140> focus<00:01:13.350> more<00:01:13.799> on<00:01:13.860> the<00:01:14.100> other

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:14.280 
and you can focus more on the other

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.920 
and you can focus more on the other
things<00:01:14.610> now<00:01:15.210> that<00:01:15.360> is<00:01:15.450> one<00:01:15.600> of<00:01:15.689> the<00:01:15.750> biggest

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
things now that is one of the biggest

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.690 
things now that is one of the biggest
things<00:01:16.320> you<00:01:16.799> don't<00:01:17.070> have<00:01:17.220> to<00:01:17.369> worry<00:01:17.549> about

00:01:17.690 --> 00:01:17.700 
things you don't have to worry about

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:19.490 
things you don't have to worry about
thinking<00:01:18.299> how<00:01:18.509> to<00:01:18.570> pull<00:01:18.930> off<00:01:19.049> your<00:01:19.080> spell

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500

thinking how to pull off your spell
rotation<00:01:20.100> or<00:01:20.310> something<00:01:20.670> like<00:01:20.759> that<00:01:20.820> because

00:01:21.289 --> 00:01:21.299 
rotation or something like that because

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.420 
rotation or something like that because
you've<00:01:21.630> done<00:01:21.659> it<00:01:21.840> so<00:01:22.200> many<00:01:22.229> times<00:01:22.409> before<00:01:22.890> and

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
you've done it so many times before and

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.670 
you've done it so many times before and
it's<00:01:23.700> now<00:01:23.880> habit<00:01:24.299> this<00:01:24.840> is<00:01:24.990> more<00:01:25.200> important

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:25.680 
it's now habit this is more important

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:27.080 
it's now habit this is more important
when<00:01:25.920> you're<00:01:26.040> actually<00:01:26.189> fighting<00:01:26.610> someone<00:01:26.939> as

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:27.090 
when you're actually fighting someone as

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:29.300 
when you're actually fighting someone as

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:29.310 
well so watch is flash by double lift

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:31.640 
well so watch is flash by double lift
it's<00:01:29.640> literally<00:01:30.030> less<00:01:30.390> than<00:01:30.420> a<00:01:30.659> second<00:01:31.110> after

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:31.650 
it's literally less than a second after

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.440 
it's literally less than a second after
he's<00:01:31.829> used<00:01:32.130> his<00:01:32.250> abilities<00:01:32.850> and<00:01:33.119> killed

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
he's used his abilities and killed

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.840 
he's used his abilities and killed
someone<00:01:33.840> and<00:01:34.049> no<00:01:34.650> I'm<00:01:34.799> not<00:01:34.829> saying<00:01:35.280> that<00:01:35.430> mania

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:35.850 
someone and no I'm not saying that mania

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:37.640 
someone and no I'm not saying that mania
champion<00:01:36.390> will<00:01:36.570> let<00:01:36.720> you<00:01:36.840> suddenly<00:01:37.200> pull<00:01:37.470> that

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:37.650 
champion will let you suddenly pull that

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.499 
champion will let you suddenly pull that
up<00:01:37.799> if<00:01:38.340> you're<00:01:38.460> not<00:01:38.579> thinking<00:01:39.030> about<00:01:39.360> your

00:01:39.499 --> 00:01:39.509 
up if you're not thinking about your

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:41.899 
up if you're not thinking about your
champion<00:01:40.049> or<00:01:40.259> whether<00:01:40.799> that<00:01:40.920> last<00:01:41.400> bell<00:01:41.729> is

00:01:41.899 --> 00:01:41.909 
champion or whether that last bell is

00:01:41.909 --> 00:01:43.670 
champion or whether that last bell is
going<00:01:42.090> to<00:01:42.150> kill<00:01:42.390> someone<00:01:42.689> then<00:01:43.140> you<00:01:43.259> can<00:01:43.409> think

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680 
going to kill someone then you can think

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:45.170 
going to kill someone then you can think
about<00:01:43.829> the<00:01:44.100> hope<00:01:44.310> that<00:01:44.520> you<00:01:44.640> need<00:01:44.820> to<00:01:44.970> dodge

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
about the hope that you need to dodge

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.090 
about the hope that you need to dodge
and<00:01:45.479> it's<00:01:45.930> just<00:01:46.140> more<00:01:46.409> likely<00:01:46.770> to<00:01:46.950> actually

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:47.100 
and it's just more likely to actually

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:49.580 
and it's just more likely to actually
happen<00:01:47.520> now<00:01:48.240> the<00:01:48.299> other<00:01:48.450> thing<00:01:48.570> and<00:01:49.020> possibly

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:49.590 
happen now the other thing and possibly

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.139 
happen now the other thing and possibly
the<00:01:49.740> bigger<00:01:49.950> thing<00:01:50.040> that<00:01:50.490> comes<00:01:50.700> from<00:01:50.850> playing

00:01:51.139 --> 00:01:51.149 
the bigger thing that comes from playing

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:53.420 
the bigger thing that comes from playing
a<00:01:51.270> champion<00:01:51.689> so<00:01:52.049> much<00:01:52.290> as<00:01:52.560> you<00:01:52.890> learn<00:01:53.070> exactly

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:53.430 
a champion so much as you learn exactly

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:55.850 
a champion so much as you learn exactly
how<00:01:53.850> much<00:01:54.149> damage<00:01:54.420> you<00:01:54.750> do<00:01:54.960> and<00:01:55.290> you<00:01:55.409> can<00:01:55.590> take

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:55.860 
how much damage you do and you can take

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.280 
how much damage you do and you can take
now<00:01:56.399> this<00:01:56.549> sounds<00:01:56.759> really<00:01:57.060> dumb<00:01:57.329> and<00:01:57.630> it's<00:01:58.170> not

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:58.290 
now this sounds really dumb and it's not

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:00.200 
now this sounds really dumb and it's not
something<00:01:58.500> you<00:01:58.979> really<00:01:59.009> notice<00:01:59.369> until<00:01:59.850> you

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210 
something you really notice until you

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:01.639 
something you really notice until you
play<00:02:00.420> against<00:02:00.659> someone<00:02:00.960> who<00:02:01.140> remains<00:02:01.409> that

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
play against someone who remains that

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:03.560 
play against someone who remains that
champion<00:02:02.159> they'll<00:02:02.640> be<00:02:02.729> able<00:02:02.850> to<00:02:02.969> find<00:02:03.240> kills

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:03.570 
champion they'll be able to find kills

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.109 
champion they'll be able to find kills
often<00:02:04.259> just<00:02:04.560> solo<00:02:04.920> efforts<00:02:05.310> on<00:02:05.460> their<00:02:05.640> own<00:02:05.820> on

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
often just solo efforts on their own on

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.300 
often just solo efforts on their own on
the<00:02:06.360> outside<00:02:06.780> of<00:02:06.990> fights<00:02:07.229> or<00:02:07.530> in<00:02:07.799> lane<00:02:08.009> because

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310 
the outside of fights or in lane because

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:09.290 
the outside of fights or in lane because
they<00:02:08.610> know<00:02:08.789> it

00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:09.300 
they know it

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.120 
they know it
see<00:02:09.479> what<00:02:09.690> they<00:02:09.840> can<00:02:09.900> do<00:02:10.260> and<00:02:10.500> how<00:02:10.770> much<00:02:10.920> damage

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.130 
see what they can do and how much damage

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:13.340 
see what they can do and how much damage
they<00:02:11.400> can<00:02:11.460> do<00:02:11.760> you'll<00:02:12.360> see<00:02:12.510> this<00:02:12.690> a<00:02:12.840> lot<00:02:12.900> when

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
they can do you'll see this a lot when

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.050 
they can do you'll see this a lot when
you<00:02:13.590> kind<00:02:13.800> of<00:02:13.890> learn<00:02:14.040> a<00:02:14.100> new<00:02:14.220> champion<00:02:14.730> you're

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:15.060 
you kind of learn a new champion you're

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:17.090 
you kind of learn a new champion you're
going<00:02:15.270> to<00:02:15.330> die<00:02:15.570> a<00:02:15.870> lot<00:02:16.260> and<00:02:16.560> that's<00:02:16.770> mainly

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:17.100 
going to die a lot and that's mainly

00:02:17.100 --> 00:02:19.250 
going to die a lot and that's mainly
just<00:02:17.400> from<00:02:17.640> testing<00:02:18.030> or<00:02:18.120> damage<00:02:18.480> you'll<00:02:18.930> fight

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
just from testing or damage you'll fight

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:20.960 
just from testing or damage you'll fight
figure<00:02:19.800> out<00:02:19.860> what<00:02:20.100> works<00:02:20.370> and<00:02:20.670> what<00:02:20.820> doesn't

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:20.970 
figure out what works and what doesn't

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.390 
figure out what works and what doesn't
and<00:02:21.450> then<00:02:21.900> you<00:02:22.050> know<00:02:22.230> when<00:02:22.470> you<00:02:22.590> can<00:02:22.920> and<00:02:23.220> can't

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400 
and then you know when you can and can't

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.370 
and then you know when you can and can't
pick<00:02:23.700> fights<00:02:23.940> this<00:02:24.510> might<00:02:24.810> not<00:02:24.930> seem<00:02:25.140> like<00:02:25.200> a

00:02:25.370 --> 00:02:25.380 
pick fights this might not seem like a

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.680 
pick fights this might not seem like a
big<00:02:25.500> deal<00:02:25.680> but<00:02:26.070> honestly<00:02:26.790> it's<00:02:27.210> often<00:02:27.660> the

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690 
big deal but honestly it's often the

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:29.360 
big deal but honestly it's often the
difference<00:02:28.140> between<00:02:28.530> going<00:02:28.650> even<00:02:29.190> and

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:29.370 
difference between going even and

00:02:29.370 --> 00:02:31.340 
difference between going even and
winning<00:02:29.970> your<00:02:30.090> lane<00:02:30.330> now<00:02:30.930> when<00:02:31.080> I<00:02:31.110> did

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:31.350 
winning your lane now when I did

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:33.560 
winning your lane now when I did
coaching<00:02:31.740> sessions<00:02:32.190> or<00:02:32.430> I<00:02:32.490> go<00:02:32.940> over<00:02:33.090> people<00:02:33.480> to

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:33.570 
coaching sessions or I go over people to

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:35.420 
coaching sessions or I go over people to
replace<00:02:33.960> this<00:02:34.230> is<00:02:34.410> the<00:02:34.500> biggest<00:02:34.770> thing<00:02:35.190> that<00:02:35.220> I

00:02:35.420 --> 00:02:35.430 
replace this is the biggest thing that I

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.580 
replace this is the biggest thing that I
noticed<00:02:35.880> so<00:02:36.330> I'm<00:02:36.480> seeing<00:02:36.750> you<00:02:36.870> thinking<00:02:37.350> I

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590 
noticed so I'm seeing you thinking I

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:39.290 
noticed so I'm seeing you thinking I
know<00:02:37.770> that<00:02:38.130> you<00:02:38.220> have<00:02:38.400> enough<00:02:38.580> damage<00:02:38.940> to<00:02:39.090> kill

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:39.300 
know that you have enough damage to kill

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.120 
know that you have enough damage to kill
them<00:02:39.450> right<00:02:39.480> there<00:02:39.810> where<00:02:40.200> is<00:02:40.350> it<00:02:40.530> the<00:02:40.650> person

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
them right there where is it the person

00:02:41.130 --> 00:02:43.040 
them right there where is it the person
i'm<00:02:41.310> watching<00:02:41.730> you're<00:02:41.880> sinking<00:02:42.360> I<00:02:42.630> don't<00:02:42.960> know

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.050 
i'm watching you're sinking I don't know

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.020 
i'm watching you're sinking I don't know
whether<00:02:43.230> I<00:02:43.320> can<00:02:43.410> kill<00:02:43.890> them<00:02:44.040> or<00:02:44.190> not<00:02:44.340> so<00:02:44.700> it's

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
whether I can kill them or not so it's

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:46.880 
whether I can kill them or not so it's
probably<00:02:45.300> just<00:02:45.630> safer<00:02:46.080> for<00:02:46.320> me<00:02:46.350> to<00:02:46.590> farm

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890 
probably just safer for me to farm

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:48.680 
probably just safer for me to farm
nothing<00:02:47.580> is<00:02:47.700> pretty<00:02:47.940> much<00:02:48.150> down<00:02:48.540> to

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
nothing is pretty much down to

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.050 
nothing is pretty much down to
experience<00:02:49.200> like<00:02:49.380> that's<00:02:49.680> all<00:02:49.920> it<00:02:50.220> is<00:02:50.250> i<00:02:50.670> paid

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:51.060 
experience like that's all it is i paid

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:52.880 
experience like that's all it is i paid
the<00:02:51.150> champion<00:02:51.540> more<00:02:51.780> than<00:02:51.930> they<00:02:52.080> have<00:02:52.380> so<00:02:52.680> i

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:52.890 
the champion more than they have so i

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:54.650 
the champion more than they have so i
know<00:02:53.190> for<00:02:53.400> sure<00:02:53.610> where<00:02:53.970> is<00:02:54.060> the<00:02:54.180> person<00:02:54.540> i'm

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:54.660 
know for sure where is the person i'm

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:56.420 
know for sure where is the person i'm
watching<00:02:55.050> dozen<00:02:55.470> so<00:02:55.980> when<00:02:56.130> you<00:02:56.220> make<00:02:56.400> a

00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:56.430 
watching dozen so when you make a

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:58.790 
watching dozen so when you make a
champion<00:02:56.820> it<00:02:57.300> basically<00:02:57.600> fixes<00:02:58.320> this<00:02:58.500> whole

00:02:58.790 --> 00:02:58.800 
champion it basically fixes this whole

00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:00.560 
champion it basically fixes this whole
problem<00:02:59.130> because<00:02:59.730> you're<00:03:00.000> playing<00:03:00.420> the

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:00.570 
problem because you're playing the

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:02.360 
problem because you're playing the
champions<00:03:00.990> so<00:03:01.260> much<00:03:01.500> that<00:03:01.860> you<00:03:02.100> gain<00:03:02.340> that

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
champions so much that you gain that

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:04.340 
champions so much that you gain that
experience<00:03:02.610> you<00:03:03.090> need<00:03:03.270> much<00:03:03.630> quicker<00:03:03.930> than<00:03:04.290> if

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:04.350 
experience you need much quicker than if

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:06.080 
experience you need much quicker than if
you<00:03:04.530> pay<00:03:04.710> a<00:03:04.740> bunch<00:03:05.130> of<00:03:05.310> different<00:03:05.430> champions

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:06.090 
you pay a bunch of different champions

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:08.180 
you pay a bunch of different champions
so<00:03:06.780> they<00:03:06.900> come<00:03:07.080> as<00:03:07.170> the<00:03:07.260> waterworks<00:03:07.770> and<00:03:08.010> now

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:08.190 
so they come as the waterworks and now

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.010 
so they come as the waterworks and now
going<00:03:08.430> to<00:03:08.520> be<00:03:08.580> going<00:03:08.730> over<00:03:09.000> how<00:03:09.210> it<00:03:09.570> works<00:03:09.780> and

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:10.020 
going to be going over how it works and

00:03:10.020 --> 00:03:11.750 
going to be going over how it works and
there<00:03:10.230> are<00:03:10.350> really<00:03:10.500> two<00:03:10.620> things<00:03:10.950> that<00:03:11.430> i<00:03:11.580> want

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760 
there are really two things that i want

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.580 
there are really two things that i want
to<00:03:11.820> point<00:03:12.000> out<00:03:12.270> that<00:03:12.510> are<00:03:12.690> really<00:03:13.050> important

00:03:13.580 --> 00:03:13.590 
to point out that are really important

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:15.920 
to point out that are really important
in<00:03:13.739> solo<00:03:14.070> queue<00:03:14.340> and<00:03:14.640> kind<00:03:15.000> of<00:03:15.090> reinforce<00:03:15.660> this

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
in solo queue and kind of reinforce this

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:18.050 
in solo queue and kind of reinforce this
whole<00:03:16.170> I<00:03:16.200> did<00:03:16.560> it<00:03:16.709> now<00:03:17.010> first<00:03:17.280> of<00:03:17.489> the<00:03:17.730> person

00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:21.450 
mean that role and they probably won't

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.270

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:39.840 
played so many games on pain that I can

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:41.510 
played so many games on pain that I can
sometimes<00:03:40.260> win<00:03:40.440> my<00:03:40.590> lane<00:03:40.800> when<00:03:41.130> I<00:03:41.160> really

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:41.520 
sometimes win my lane when I really

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:43.490 
sometimes win my lane when I really
shouldn't<00:03:41.910> just<00:03:42.239> because<00:03:42.570> I<00:03:42.750> know<00:03:42.900> the<00:03:43.170> exact

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:43.500 
shouldn't just because I know the exact

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:45.870 
trades that I can take and how to create

myself<00:03:48.270> far<00:03:48.780> the<00:03:49.290> point<00:03:49.560> is<00:03:49.770> that<00:03:49.800> if<00:03:50.400> you

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:50.670 
myself far the point is that if you

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:52.130 
myself far the point is that if you
become<00:03:51.030> good<00:03:51.239> enough<00:03:51.540> on<00:03:51.750> your<00:03:51.930> chosen

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:52.140 
become good enough on your chosen

00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:54.170 
become good enough on your chosen
champion<00:03:52.530> then<00:03:53.070> it<00:03:53.340> doesn't<00:03:53.580> matter<00:03:53.730> if

00:03:54.170 --> 00:03:54.180 
champion then it doesn't matter if

00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:55.940 
champion then it doesn't matter if
someone<00:03:54.480> picked<00:03:54.750> something<00:03:54.989> to<00:03:55.380> county<00:03:55.800> you

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:55.950 
someone picked something to county you

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:57.380 
someone picked something to county you
because<00:03:56.340> you<00:03:56.550> will<00:03:56.730> have<00:03:56.760> learned<00:03:57.030> how<00:03:57.330> to

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:57.390 
because you will have learned how to

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:59.479 
because you will have learned how to
play<00:03:57.540> that<00:03:57.720> matchup<00:03:58.050> and<00:03:58.440> win<00:03:58.650> the<00:03:59.160> second

00:03:59.479 --> 00:03:59.489 
play that matchup and win the second

00:03:59.489 --> 00:04:01.430 
play that matchup and win the second
thing<00:03:59.730> is<00:03:59.970> that<00:04:00.300> it's<00:04:00.570> not<00:04:00.780> enough<00:04:01.020> to<00:04:01.050> go<00:04:01.260> even

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:01.440 
thing is that it's not enough to go even

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:03.620 
thing is that it's not enough to go even
in<00:04:01.709> your<00:04:01.860> lane<00:04:02.040> you<00:04:02.280> have<00:04:02.550> to<00:04:02.760> win<00:04:02.940> you<00:04:03.300> have<00:04:03.570> to

00:04:03.620 --> 00:04:03.630 
in your lane you have to win you have to

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:05.270 
in your lane you have to win you have to
assume<00:04:04.170> that<00:04:04.380> your<00:04:04.470> teammates<00:04:04.890> will<00:04:05.100> lose

assume that your teammates will lose
their<00:04:05.430> lanes<00:04:05.640> and<00:04:05.880> you'll<00:04:06.120> have<00:04:06.269> to<00:04:06.450> carry<00:04:06.720> the

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:06.870 
their lanes and you'll have to carry the

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:08.720 
their lanes and you'll have to carry the
game<00:04:07.080> if<00:04:07.590> you're<00:04:07.830> playing<00:04:08.010> a<00:04:08.160> champion<00:04:08.580> that

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:10.440 
you aren't that familiar on then you'll

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:12.100
