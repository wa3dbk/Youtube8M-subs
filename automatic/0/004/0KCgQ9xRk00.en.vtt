00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:52.970 
wanting to be a hero and I think and

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:01.310 

yes<00:00:59.460> and<00:00:59.760> that<00:00:59.969> and<00:01:00.210> this<00:01:00.390> year<00:01:00.660> we<00:01:01.110> deal<00:01:01.289> with

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:01.320 
yes and that and this year we deal with

00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:05.030 
yes and that and this year we deal with
that<00:01:01.590> very<00:01:01.940> concept<00:01:03.470> yeah<00:01:04.470> I<00:01:04.650> mean<00:01:04.799> the<00:01:04.920> only

00:01:05.030 --> 00:01:05.040 
that very concept yeah I mean the only

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.260 
that very concept yeah I mean the only
way<00:01:05.190> to<00:01:05.250> sort<00:01:05.460> of<00:01:05.549> deal<00:01:05.700> with<00:01:05.729> that<00:01:05.909> kind<00:01:06.240> of

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:06.270 
way to sort of deal with that kind of

00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:08.390 
way to sort of deal with that kind of
stuff<00:01:06.450> is<00:01:06.600> I<00:01:06.630> think<00:01:07.049> dramatize<00:01:07.950> it<00:01:08.159> and<00:01:08.280> deal

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 
stuff is I think dramatize it and deal

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:10.609 
stuff is I think dramatize it and deal
with<00:01:08.430> it<00:01:08.640> head-on<00:01:08.790> and<00:01:09.180> so<00:01:09.479> we<00:01:10.380> deal<00:01:10.590> with

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
with it head-on and so we deal with

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:14.940 
with it head-on and so we deal with
those<00:01:10.830> things<00:01:11.130> this<00:01:11.280> year

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:14.950

however<00:01:57.200> you<00:01:57.290> want<00:01:57.440> to<00:01:57.500> sort<00:01:57.620> of<00:01:57.740> say<00:01:57.920> that<00:01:58.760> he

00:01:58.840 --> 00:01:58.850 
however you want to sort of say that he

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:00.310 
however you want to sort of say that he
had<00:01:58.970> to<00:01:59.090> be<00:01:59.180> come<00:01:59.360> on<00:01:59.510> the<00:01:59.600> island<00:01:59.900> to<00:01:59.990> survive

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:00.320 
had to be come on the island to survive

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.440 
had to be come on the island to survive
he's<00:02:01.220> hopefully<00:02:01.580> becoming<00:02:01.850> I<00:02:02.000> think<00:02:02.210> more

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:02.450 
he's hopefully becoming I think more

00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:07.390 
he's hopefully becoming I think more
human<00:02:03.410> again<00:02:03.650> here<00:02:04.180> and<00:02:05.180> and<00:02:05.480> so<00:02:06.100> we<00:02:07.100> play<00:02:07.250> with

00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:07.400 
human again here and and so we play with

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.960 
human again here and and so we play with
that<00:02:07.430> a<00:02:07.550> little<00:02:07.640> bit

00:02:10.960 --> 00:02:10.970 

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:13.540 

our<00:02:11.840> intention<00:02:12.830> was<00:02:12.950> always<00:02:13.070> to<00:02:13.220> start

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:13.550 
our intention was always to start

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:15.760 
our intention was always to start
however<00:02:13.910> many<00:02:14.240> feet<00:02:14.510> back<00:02:14.750> from<00:02:15.170> the<00:02:15.470> comic

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:15.770 
however many feet back from the comic

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:18.690 
however many feet back from the comic
book<00:02:15.950> and<00:02:16.190> then<00:02:16.550> to<00:02:16.700> work<00:02:16.850> our<00:02:17.030> way<00:02:17.180> toward<00:02:17.510> it

00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:18.700 
book and then to work our way toward it

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:21.550 
book and then to work our way toward it
sometimes<00:02:19.700> I<00:02:19.880> think<00:02:19.940> it'll<00:02:20.750> be<00:02:20.870> two<00:02:21.380> steps

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:21.560 
sometimes I think it'll be two steps

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:23.560 
sometimes I think it'll be two steps
forward<00:02:21.800> one<00:02:22.130> step<00:02:22.190> back<00:02:22.580> and<00:02:22.820> I<00:02:22.880> think<00:02:23.090> people

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:23.570 
forward one step back and I think people

00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:25.900 
forward one step back and I think people
may<00:02:23.810> say<00:02:24.080> oh<00:02:24.380> wait<00:02:25.010> a<00:02:25.070> second<00:02:25.490> you<00:02:25.580> turned<00:02:25.790> them

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:25.910 
may say oh wait a second you turned them

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:27.040 
may say oh wait a second you turned them
this<00:02:26.060> way<00:02:26.210> and<00:02:26.240> now<00:02:26.600> you're<00:02:26.750> turning<00:02:26.870> them

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:27.050 
this way and now you're turning them

00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:28.420 
this way and now you're turning them
back<00:02:27.080> that<00:02:27.380> way<00:02:27.560> what<00:02:27.800> are<00:02:27.830> you<00:02:27.920> doing<00:02:28.250> you

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430 
back that way what are you doing you

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.460 
back that way what are you doing you
know<00:02:28.460> and<00:02:28.970> hopefully<00:02:29.450> we<00:02:29.600> we<00:02:29.870> twist<00:02:30.170> and<00:02:30.290> turn

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 
know and hopefully we we twist and turn

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:32.410 
know and hopefully we we twist and turn
enough<00:02:30.890> to<00:02:31.070> keep<00:02:31.190> everybody<00:02:31.490> engaged<00:02:32.060> and

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420 
enough to keep everybody engaged and

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:35.710 
enough to keep everybody engaged and
interested<00:02:33.760> so<00:02:34.760> I<00:02:35.090> mean<00:02:35.510> there's<00:02:35.660> definitely

00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:35.720 
interested so I mean there's definitely

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:38.050 
interested so I mean there's definitely
choices<00:02:36.620> we<00:02:36.740> make<00:02:36.920> on<00:02:37.100> the<00:02:37.130> show<00:02:37.370> that<00:02:37.640> are<00:02:37.790> in

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:13.130 
the same time too right because he's not

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:15.610

yet the character the Deathstroke that
we<00:03:15.710> know<00:03:15.860> in<00:03:16.100> the<00:03:16.160> comic<00:03:16.430> books<00:03:16.990> and<00:03:17.990> so<00:03:18.710> I<00:03:19.520> mean

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:19.910 
we know in the comic books and so I mean

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:22.240 
we know in the comic books and so I mean
he<00:03:20.060> has<00:03:20.090> that<00:03:20.780> fire<00:03:21.050> inside<00:03:21.290> him<00:03:21.620> which

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.250 
he has that fire inside him which

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:24.430 
he has that fire inside him which
hopefully<00:03:22.490> this<00:03:22.760> year<00:03:22.910> we're<00:03:23.270> able<00:03:23.330> to<00:03:23.600> do

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:24.440 
hopefully this year we're able to do

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:28.059 
hopefully this year we're able to do
some<00:03:24.590> cool<00:03:24.770> stuff

00:03:28.059 --> 00:03:28.069 

00:03:28.069 --> 00:03:33.009 

I<00:03:28.390> mean<00:03:29.390> the<00:03:29.480> thing<00:03:29.659> I<00:03:29.780> always<00:03:29.810> say<00:03:31.629> yes<00:03:32.629> and<00:03:32.900> no

00:03:33.009 --> 00:03:33.019 
I mean the thing I always say yes and no

00:03:33.019 --> 00:03:34.179 
I mean the thing I always say yes and no
I<00:03:33.049> mean<00:03:33.379> I<00:03:33.439> think<00:03:33.499> they're<00:03:33.769> obviously<00:03:34.099> very

00:03:34.179 --> 00:03:34.189 
I mean I think they're obviously very

00:03:34.189 --> 00:03:35.860 
I mean I think they're obviously very
cautious<00:03:34.790> about<00:03:34.879> how<00:03:35.150> they<00:03:35.359> do<00:03:35.420> that

00:03:35.860 --> 00:03:35.870 
cautious about how they do that

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:37.479 
cautious about how they do that
and<00:03:36.290> that's<00:03:36.439> more<00:03:36.650> their<00:03:36.859> decision<00:03:37.280> than<00:03:37.400> it

00:03:37.479 --> 00:03:37.489 
and that's more their decision than it

00:03:37.489 --> 00:03:39.759 
and that's more their decision than it
is<00:03:37.579> ours<00:03:37.790> but<00:03:38.450> we<00:03:38.629> do<00:03:38.900> feel<00:03:39.260> the<00:03:39.530> weight<00:03:39.739> and

00:03:39.759 --> 00:03:39.769 
is ours but we do feel the weight and

00:03:39.769 --> 00:03:43.270 
is ours but we do feel the weight and
the<00:03:40.040> responsibility<00:03:40.959> and<00:03:41.959> the<00:03:42.170> excitement<00:03:42.980> of

00:03:43.270 --> 00:03:43.280 
the responsibility and the excitement of

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:46.000 
the responsibility and the excitement of
being<00:03:43.959> sort<00:03:44.959> of<00:03:45.019> the<00:03:45.139> DC<00:03:45.439> Universe<00:03:45.469> on

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:46.010 
being sort of the DC Universe on

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:49.720 
being sort of the DC Universe on
television<00:03:46.579> you<00:03:47.329> know<00:03:47.480> and<00:03:48.189> you<00:03:49.189> know<00:03:49.280> and<00:03:49.549> so

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:49.730 
television you know and you know and so

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:52.479 
television you know and you know and so
I<00:03:50.359> think<00:03:51.079> probably<00:03:51.469> in<00:03:51.769> that<00:03:51.889> regard<00:03:52.219> is<00:03:52.370> the

00:03:52.479 --> 00:03:52.489 
I think probably in that regard is the

00:03:52.489 --> 00:03:54.039 
I think probably in that regard is the
show<00:03:52.639> hopefully<00:03:53.150> the<00:03:53.209> show<00:03:53.450> continues<00:03:53.930> to

00:03:54.039 --> 00:03:54.049 
show hopefully the show continues to
