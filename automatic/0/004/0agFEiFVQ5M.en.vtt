00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:14.160
 namely with my eyeshadow base of 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.960

 then you come to the part where i 

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.920
 show step by step how i am mine 

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.390
 eyebrows draw the power of 

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:31.830
 my cookies actually if you want to be older 

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.540
 just seem like a lot of dark colors 

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:35.760
 finally using for one too 

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:37.559
 dark mysterious look go and 

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:39.989
 to speak to my eyeshadow food truck 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:42.149
 Use the he feels has eye primer in it 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.579
 smokey from church of those that bring 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:47.430
 collin in old via a point on the eyes 

00:00:44.579 --> 00:00:49.379
 void namely for mail and wx 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:51.870
 jumbo pencil in the inner corner of the eye and 

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:53.520
 also because there go the lighter color and 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:55.710
 I blend this with my finger 

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:57.360
 he thought it was boring primer too 

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:59.309
 I really love deep in the outer corners 

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.809
 and I wanted it to go over in the mail 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:01.859
 but not too much there i go over and the 

00:01:00.809 --> 00:01:03.809
 micro shadow 

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:05.729
 in white fang make up store and with that 

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:07.560
 I am going to put the light color in one 

00:01:05.729 --> 00:01:08.520
 eye look because he was still pretty intense and 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:10.439
 getting dark 

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:12.630
 it really is a refreshing touch because 

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.820
 I also use the matte gray from the 

00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:17.640
 uhm natural palette of sleek that goes 

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:20.009
 next to the white eye shadow hand 

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.869
 in addition, the dark gray comes from and 

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:23.820
 why x-and that trend i'll just be in one again 

00:01:21.869 --> 00:01:25.979
 mark on the eyelid and I try 

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:28.680
 a bit there with the matte gray what the 

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:31.110
 fade out of the smoke and fire palette 

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:32.850
 I use the silver dark one there 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.920
 gray eye shadow but with an extreme amount 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.659
 glitter and it goes in the old fi 

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.610
 because you come in with so many dark colors 

00:01:36.659 --> 00:01:40.140
 the bear bed therefore remains in between 

00:01:38.610 --> 00:01:42.180
 blend and because of this it is a lot 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:44.189
 easier to get a nice smokey effect 

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.930
 and I do that again now 

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:47.579
 I did apply the plant to you and that is 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.220
 it is you on the brow bone and I go 

00:01:47.579 --> 00:01:51.869
 also a dark black in the old fi 

00:01:50.220 --> 00:01:53.729
 and apply under the eye 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:55.439
 my foundation and trust not yet 

00:01:53.729 --> 00:01:57.540
 affixed which only does after the dark 

00:01:55.439 --> 00:01:58.110
 color the spot the blend blend blend blend 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.290
 blend 

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:03.930
 some more more some more the 

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.670
 dark gray with glitter in it goes on 

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:08.490
 the eyelid then a bit in the 

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:10.350
 outer corner and in the old fi make in 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:12.120
 a kind of severin and this remains me 

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:14.310
 know that it must be beautiful 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:16.140
 surrender for a large part 

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.820
 So I now turn to the foundation I 

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:19.350
 use the press child foundation french 

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:21.720
 that contour here minus my eyebrows 

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:22.620
 he seems to agree with this so us un so 

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.570
 You can also simply use a concealer 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:26.430
 I use this to date 

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:28.320
 not necessary then it largely becomes us 

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:30.270
 all means black eye shadow tempur 

00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:32.400
 I got this off with her and hurt coffee 

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:34.800
 al pressed powder mainly among the 

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:36.180
 eyes and then I get the 

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.500
 surplus rest and away with the 

00:02:36.180 --> 00:02:42.810
 powder brush and then I put immediately 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:44.760
 my cheeks and we switch to the 

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.410
 eyes and for that I use a tease 

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:48.690
 black eye pencil and then I go kind 

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:50.489
 make dark of my eyelashes 

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:51.989
 back align ocher yellow paper thin 

00:02:50.489 --> 00:02:53.610
 along my eyelashes 

00:02:51.989 --> 00:02:55.739
 and then I immediately fill my waterline 

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:58.380
 in and also the lower lashes I take 

00:02:55.739 --> 00:03:00.690
 with it it becomes the good you of ties matte 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:02.910
 eye shadow and with that I go the line 

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:04.650
 above the eyelashes fade 

00:03:02.910 --> 00:03:06.690
 it is actually the einem 

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.280
 also the basis for your fake eyelashes and also 

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:09.959
 to make it the wesley is darker 

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:11.880
 namely in the outer corners 

00:03:09.959 --> 00:03:14.160
 now hope under the eye for the eye shadow 

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:16.019
 and an eye pencils who knows you there 

00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.280
 to fade 

00:03:16.019 --> 00:03:19.860
 I now pack with a dark gray 

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.600
 eye shadow the shape of her eyes kasmi 

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:23.430
 and actually slightly above the willemsen 

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:25.920
 corner of the eye because this makes it something 

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:27.450
 more intense and what you will be won on 

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.950
 somehow older and now 

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:31.170
 I also blend again then I use 

00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:34.970
 the fake eyelashes that are from ebay and the 

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:34.970
 expensive olive oil with village tone 

00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:39.150
 brought the glasses my eyelashes asked us 

00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:41.220
 I do why I wanted to learn from 

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:43.380
 the hema and that's what the fake eyelashes are about 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:45.090
 I have my tutorial for the fake eyelashes 

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:46.590
 so click on my eyelashes and then you come 

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:48.180
 and I will leave here again 

00:03:46.590 --> 00:03:49.650
 step by step see how to fake eyelashes 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:51.209
 can apply 

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:53.220
 our corner of the eye there is quite intense 

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:55.590
 I use the fog that minute 

00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:56.460
 lines int or a 010 and with that back 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:57.990
 just my 

00:03:56.460 --> 00:04:00.090
 and one that goes over another 

00:03:57.990 --> 00:04:02.280
 cord lipgloss from and why it's not 

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:04.740
 real darling a bit at the top 

00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:08.480
 off the turbo and then I use the 

00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:08.480
 and where x frosted per 

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:13.920
 next to a fake eyelashes that new left the 

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:16.440
 dark color and also use with 

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:18.270
 tempo jay lines black first and with that 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:21.120
 I'm going to make that in the corner winx and me 

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:23.700
 draw a line from my top edge 

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:25.260
 down from my eye and then I pull 

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:27.420
 bring him in but I do 

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:29.880
 a kind of thicker line and let me 

00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:31.680
 that fade away or actually blend in 

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:33.810
 you make my eyelashes and tour de 

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:35.580
 also older and for that I go well and 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:37.260
 solid contours as I always get 

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:39.330
 and that is what I mean by the and 

00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:41.580
 where x plus a cold and and and google 

00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:43.230
 plus and I put my cheekbones on and on 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:44.610
 I really gotta do the demo I think 

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:45.810
 without going along with the song because on that 

00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:49.280
 moment was listened there of course 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:49.280
 I listen to an apple of course 

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:56.010
 blush used to draw soft peachy color 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:58.230
 and it is 004 

00:04:56.010 --> 00:05:00.450
 from nettles the sticker continued to win 

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:01.920
 actually already off my hand and stir 

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:03.840
 I put a finger in it and that sounds whole 

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:06.390
 dirty and then I blend a little with my 

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:06.900
 fingers and then I blur it 

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:09.420
 my 

00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:11.190
 apples from my cheeks and that's it and 

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:12.360
 so you can look older with makeup you 

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:13.080
 does not have to take on so much 

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:14.880
 bring 

00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:16.710
 but just go for dark colors and 

00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:18.660
 I always want to combine fake eyelashes with 

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:20.310
 a good incentive in your legs because then
