00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:03.900
 the wings of airplanes for little support needed to get us 

00:00:03.899 --> 00:00:08.109
 for your site they are designed to be very strong and very light 

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:12.599
 produced, there is a strategic balance of production methods 

00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:16.119
 the old guard and high tech computer-aided design 

00:00:24.669 --> 00:00:28.710
 the structure of being made of three main components elongate in the 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.010
 back the long one on the main and the vegetables 

00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:36.050
 the memories are made of aeronautical aluminum it is resistant to 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:39.890
 corrosion resistance and has high tensile strength 

00:00:39.890 --> 00:00:44.130
 extreme wind 'a computer-created stamp machine has a cure 

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:47.109
 small holes so that in 27 control positions 

00:00:47.109 --> 00:00:50.480
 it also stacks larger funds to reduce overall weight 

00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:54.580
 the employees part connectors called strange micro boards 

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:57.580
 vegetables 

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:05.410
 the healing home now goes through an array of metal and rubber forming 

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.799
 a prey between the rigor in the application and of 50 tons of pressure 

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:14.860
 punching until it is in the matrix format 

00:01:27.010 --> 00:01:30.440
 using a grinder the employees leave the sharp edges 

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:34.960
 left behind by the stamping process then remove the plastic film that 

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.820
 protected the ribs from scratches 

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:40.820
 vandinho 

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:46.590
 the factory use the same process to build the main stringer the 

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:49.780
 drugstores went through the whole of Asia 

00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:50.860
 I will 

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:55.910
 you need even more pressure this time 222 tons to bend on the stringers 

00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:00.900
 in the right format this is because this year - three times thicker than that 

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:03.740
 used for figures 

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:04.760
 4 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:10.040
 to make sure they aligned adventures perfectly to check 

00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:12.680
 if the employees inserts in staples in the stringer 

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:17.670
 they keep the ribs in the opposite position they pierce the hot tubs manually 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:22.510
 by accidents larger pianists sharp edges with a thinning drill 

00:02:25.639 --> 00:02:31.790
 this not using a pistol should avoid pneumatics in a bar support them 

00:02:31.789 --> 00:02:34.599
 attach the following to the main spar 

00:02:34.599 --> 00:02:37.599
 Rafa 

00:02:42.009 --> 00:02:45.009
 I 

00:02:46.439 --> 00:02:50.340
 with the lower dam resistance is required for some of the more 

00:02:50.339 --> 00:02:51.729
 affected 

00:02:51.729 --> 00:02:52.680
 sa 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:58.189
 I am the structure of the completed aircraft is now put into a 

00:02:58.189 --> 00:03:01.459
 where you will receive an aluminum cover called 

00:03:01.459 --> 00:03:04.459
 house cover 

00:03:06.929 --> 00:03:10.359
 the employees use a great disservice to position the cover 

00:03:10.359 --> 00:03:13.359
 superior in the structure of the airplane 

00:03:15.159 --> 00:03:18.869
 they use the same procedure for the nose of the heart attack mouth 

00:03:30.059 --> 00:03:33.749
 once everything is tired the staff repeat set that 

00:03:33.749 --> 00:03:36.749
 permanently 

00:03:38.549 --> 00:03:42.510
 meanwhile the welders fuse the fuel tank of the action using 

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:46.480
 Argon gas torch containing less contaminants than the torch 

00:03:46.479 --> 00:03:49.479
 typical acetylene 

00:03:51.399 --> 00:03:55.769
 they box-high here in the city chamber then they learn using tapes of 

00:03:55.769 --> 00:03:58.769
 steel railings 

00:04:04.129 --> 00:04:08.010
 now they position the tank cover plate and create screw 

00:04:08.010 --> 00:04:11.010
 nasa 

00:04:11.659 --> 00:04:15.189
 these funds are for the fuel hoses and control cable that 

00:04:15.189 --> 00:04:18.189
 pass through the whole length of the race 

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:28.340
 robin pointed up to docked via screwed in race 

00:04:29.129 --> 00:04:32.460
 it is made of a composite fiber glass and plastic net 

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:41.940
 but the completion is now ready to be screwed into the fuselage of the airplane 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:46.379
 the fees only just eighty pounds but for sure 

00:04:46.379 --> 00:04:49.379
 it's not a pity because it's about force 

00:04:51.059 --> 00:04:55.020
 to be able to exist to almost two and a half tons of wind pressure
