information<00:00:19.140> and<00:00:19.770> explain<00:00:20.189> how<00:00:20.490> we're

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:20.789 
information and explain how we're

00:00:20.789 --> 00:00:23.810 
information and explain how we're
actually<00:00:20.970> able<00:00:21.449> to<00:00:22.080> eat<00:00:22.380> carbohydrates<00:00:23.070> at

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820 
actually able to eat carbohydrates at

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:27.970 
actually able to eat carbohydrates at
night<00:00:24.210> time<00:00:24.510> and<00:00:25.039> optimize<00:00:26.039> fat<00:00:26.910> loss<00:00:27.150> and

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:27.980 
night time and optimize fat loss and

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:30.800 
night time and optimize fat loss and
optimize<00:00:28.980> muscle<00:00:29.550> growth<00:00:29.789> at<00:00:30.119> the<00:00:30.359> same<00:00:30.570> time

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:30.810 
optimize muscle growth at the same time

00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.440 
optimize muscle growth at the same time
so<00:00:31.740> the<00:00:32.369> topic<00:00:32.730> today<00:00:32.850> is<00:00:33.320> carb<00:00:34.320> backloading

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:35.450 
so the topic today is carb backloading

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:39.819 
so the topic today is carb backloading
so<00:00:36.450> carb<00:00:36.930> backloading<00:00:37.309> is<00:00:38.309> a<00:00:38.370> unique<00:00:39.300> and

00:00:39.819 --> 00:00:39.829 
so carb backloading is a unique and

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:42.650 
so carb backloading is a unique and
strategic<00:00:40.829> style<00:00:41.190> of<00:00:41.579> nutrition<00:00:42.360> and

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:42.660 
strategic style of nutrition and

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:45.229 
strategic style of nutrition and
nutrient<00:00:43.230> and<00:00:43.350> food<00:00:43.559> intake<00:00:44.160> that<00:00:45.030> was

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239 
nutrient and food intake that was

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.240 
nutrient and food intake that was
discovered<00:00:45.660> by<00:00:45.809> a<00:00:45.960> physicist<00:00:46.590> named<00:00:46.950> John

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
discovered by a physicist named John

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.580 
discovered by a physicist named John
Keifer<00:00:47.789> and<00:00:48.120> carb<00:00:49.020> backloading

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:49.590 
Keifer and carb backloading

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:53.330 
Keifer and carb backloading
all<00:00:49.739> revolves<00:00:50.489> around<00:00:50.870> insulin<00:00:51.870> and<00:00:52.340> the

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:53.340 
all revolves around insulin and the

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.000 
all revolves around insulin and the
delivery<00:00:54.000> of<00:00:54.360> nutrients<00:00:55.110> into<00:00:55.350> muscle<00:00:55.829> tissue

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:56.010 
delivery of nutrients into muscle tissue

00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:58.729 
delivery of nutrients into muscle tissue
and<00:00:56.489> or<00:00:57.329> into<00:00:57.690> fat<00:00:57.870> tissue<00:00:58.140> and<00:00:58.500> it<00:00:58.559> all

00:00:58.729 --> 00:00:58.739 
and or into fat tissue and it all

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:00.880 
and or into fat tissue and it all
affects<00:00:59.100> how<00:00:59.969> we're<00:01:00.149> able<00:01:00.300> to<00:01:00.600> control

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:00.890 
affects how we're able to control

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:03.229 
affects how we're able to control
whether<00:01:01.890> or<00:01:01.980> not<00:01:02.129> we're<00:01:02.370> building<00:01:02.699> muscle<00:01:03.030> or

00:01:03.229 --> 00:01:03.239 
whether or not we're building muscle or

00:01:03.239 --> 00:01:06.410 
whether or not we're building muscle or
causing<00:01:04.019> our<00:01:04.140> own<00:01:04.290> fat<00:01:04.530> tissue<00:01:04.769> to<00:01:05.070> shrink<00:01:05.430> so

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
causing our own fat tissue to shrink so

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.870 
causing our own fat tissue to shrink so
here's<00:01:07.200> how<00:01:07.380> we<00:01:07.439> do<00:01:07.740> carb<00:01:08.130> backloading<00:01:08.340> it's

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:08.880 
here's how we do carb backloading it's

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.000 
here's how we do carb backloading it's
really<00:01:09.210> easy<00:01:09.420> to<00:01:09.600> do<00:01:09.840> I<00:01:10.110> will<00:01:10.619> also<00:01:10.860> explain

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010 
really easy to do I will also explain

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.820 
really easy to do I will also explain
how<00:01:11.580> and<00:01:11.820> why<00:01:11.850> it's<00:01:12.270> actually<00:01:13.229> just<00:01:13.439> so<00:01:13.710> much

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:13.830 
how and why it's actually just so much

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.640 
how and why it's actually just so much
more<00:01:14.070> effective<00:01:14.610> than<00:01:15.210> the<00:01:15.240> normal<00:01:16.049> style<00:01:16.350> of

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:16.650 
more effective than the normal style of

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:18.890 
more effective than the normal style of
nutrition<00:01:17.130> that<00:01:17.310> we're<00:01:17.580> all<00:01:17.700> so<00:01:17.939> used<00:01:18.150> to<00:01:18.330> when

00:01:18.890 --> 00:01:18.900 
nutrition that we're all so used to when

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.210 
nutrition that we're all so used to when
it<00:01:19.020> comes<00:01:19.140> to<00:01:19.439> thinking<00:01:19.799> that<00:01:19.920> we're<00:01:20.070> eating

00:01:20.210 --> 00:01:20.220 
it comes to thinking that we're eating

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:23.149 
it comes to thinking that we're eating
clean<00:01:20.610> and<00:01:20.880> eating<00:01:21.150> healthy<00:01:21.450> so<00:01:22.380> here's<00:01:23.009> how

00:01:23.149 --> 00:01:23.159 
clean and eating healthy so here's how

00:01:23.159 --> 00:01:26.020 
clean and eating healthy so here's how
we<00:01:23.220> do<00:01:23.369> carb<00:01:23.640> backloading<00:01:23.840> we<00:01:24.840> actually<00:01:25.320> skip

00:01:26.020 --> 00:01:26.030 
we do carb backloading we actually skip

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.840 
we do carb backloading we actually skip
breakfast<00:01:27.380> so<00:01:28.380> then<00:01:28.590> we<00:01:28.740> have<00:01:28.920> five<00:01:29.460> meals

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:29.850 
breakfast so then we have five meals

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.819 
breakfast so then we have five meals
total<00:01:30.329> for<00:01:30.630> the<00:01:30.869> rest<00:01:31.079> of<00:01:31.229> the<00:01:31.350> day<00:01:31.500> and

00:01:31.819 --> 00:01:31.829 
total for the rest of the day and

00:01:31.829 --> 00:01:33.710 
total for the rest of the day and
they're<00:01:32.369> all<00:01:32.520> roughly<00:01:32.880> spaced<00:01:33.240> out<00:01:33.450> about

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
they're all roughly spaced out about

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:34.700 
they're all roughly spaced out about
every<00:01:33.990> three<00:01:34.320> hours

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:34.710 
every three hours

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:38.569 
every three hours
so<00:01:35.520> our<00:01:36.150> first<00:01:37.049> three<00:01:37.320> meals<00:01:37.560> of<00:01:37.829> the<00:01:37.860> day<00:01:37.950> are

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579 
so our first three meals of the day are

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:41.600 
so our first three meals of the day are
going<00:01:38.820> to<00:01:38.880> be<00:01:39.030> proteins<00:01:40.220> vegetables<00:01:41.220> and

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:41.610 
going to be proteins vegetables and

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.870 
going to be proteins vegetables and
healthy<00:01:42.450> fats<00:01:43.220> so<00:01:44.220> that's<00:01:44.460> what<00:01:44.610> we're<00:01:44.729> doing

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:44.880 
healthy fats so that's what we're doing

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:46.340 
healthy fats so that's what we're doing
for<00:01:44.909> our<00:01:45.060> first<00:01:45.390> three<00:01:45.720> meals<00:01:45.899> of<00:01:46.110> the<00:01:46.200> day

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:46.350 
for our first three meals of the day

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:47.810 
for our first three meals of the day
that<00:01:46.619> are<00:01:46.649> all<00:01:46.829> spaced<00:01:47.189> out<00:01:47.340> about<00:01:47.610> every

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
that are all spaced out about every

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:48.620 
that are all spaced out about every
three<00:01:48.030> hours

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
three hours

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:51.289 
three hours
now<00:01:49.200> our<00:01:49.530> last<00:01:49.799> two<00:01:50.159> meals<00:01:50.340> of<00:01:50.579> the<00:01:50.610> day<00:01:50.729> are

00:01:51.289 --> 00:01:51.299 
now our last two meals of the day are

00:01:51.299 --> 00:01:54.289 
now our last two meals of the day are
gonna<00:01:51.479> be<00:01:51.689> dinner<00:01:52.020> and<00:01:52.610> finally<00:01:53.610> before<00:01:53.759> bed<00:01:54.090> a

00:01:54.289 --> 00:01:54.299 
gonna be dinner and finally before bed a

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:56.630 
gonna be dinner and finally before bed a
protein<00:01:54.780> shake<00:01:54.810> now<00:01:55.680> in<00:01:55.950> those<00:01:56.189> last<00:01:56.399> two

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
protein shake now in those last two

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.899 
protein shake now in those last two
meals<00:01:56.899> we're<00:01:57.899> gonna<00:01:58.350> load<00:01:58.680> up<00:01:58.920> on<00:01:59.250> high

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
meals we're gonna load up on high

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:03.440 
meals we're gonna load up on high
glycemic<00:02:00.240> carbohydrates<00:02:01.310> so<00:02:02.310> at<00:02:02.759> night<00:02:03.180> time

00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:03.450 
glycemic carbohydrates so at night time

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.830 
glycemic carbohydrates so at night time
the<00:02:03.990> fun<00:02:04.259> begins<00:02:04.710> with<00:02:04.979> the<00:02:05.070> carbs<00:02:05.460> so<00:02:06.450> now

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:06.840 
the fun begins with the carbs so now

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:09.080 
the fun begins with the carbs so now
here's<00:02:07.829> how<00:02:08.039> caramel

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
here's how caramel

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.240 
here's how caramel
our<00:02:09.149> back<00:02:09.330> loading<00:02:09.629> works<00:02:10.140> so<00:02:10.619> essentially

00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:11.250 
our back loading works so essentially

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:13.309 
our back loading works so essentially
throughout<00:02:11.790> the<00:02:11.970> whole<00:02:12.150> day<00:02:12.390> we're<00:02:12.989> putting

00:02:13.309 --> 00:02:13.319 
throughout the whole day we're putting

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:15.890 
throughout the whole day we're putting
our<00:02:13.440> bodies<00:02:13.590> in<00:02:14.069> a<00:02:14.220> pedo<00:02:14.550> genic<00:02:15.150> state<00:02:15.450> or<00:02:15.840> a

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900 
our bodies in a pedo genic state or a

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.550 
our bodies in a pedo genic state or a
state<00:02:16.140> of<00:02:16.680> ketosis<00:02:17.450> so<00:02:18.450> what<00:02:18.959> that<00:02:19.050> means<00:02:19.290> is

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560 
state of ketosis so what that means is

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:22.850 
state of ketosis so what that means is
that<00:02:19.590> we're<00:02:20.040> in<00:02:20.069> a<00:02:20.250> carb<00:02:20.730> deprived<00:02:21.510> State<00:02:22.110> now

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:22.860 
that we're in a carb deprived State now

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:25.009 
that we're in a carb deprived State now
what<00:02:23.010> happens<00:02:23.340> is<00:02:23.580> when<00:02:24.150> our<00:02:24.209> body<00:02:24.480> gets<00:02:24.780> used

00:02:25.009 --> 00:02:25.019 
what happens is when our body gets used

00:02:25.019 --> 00:02:27.559 
what happens is when our body gets used
to<00:02:25.319> not<00:02:25.530> getting<00:02:25.730> carbohydrates<00:02:26.730> what<00:02:27.480> will

00:02:27.559 --> 00:02:27.569 
to not getting carbohydrates what will

00:02:27.569 --> 00:02:30.350 
to not getting carbohydrates what will
happen<00:02:27.930> is<00:02:28.170> that<00:02:28.230> in<00:02:29.099> our<00:02:29.310> liver<00:02:29.610> we<00:02:29.819> start<00:02:30.150> to

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:30.360 
happen is that in our liver we start to

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.780 
happen is that in our liver we start to
produce<00:02:30.599> ketones<00:02:31.500> and<00:02:31.950> when<00:02:32.430> we<00:02:32.519> produce

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:32.790 
produce ketones and when we produce

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:36.320 
produce ketones and when we produce
ketones<00:02:33.480> our<00:02:34.140> body<00:02:34.379> starts<00:02:34.860> to<00:02:35.099> burn<00:02:35.580> ketones

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:36.330 
ketones our body starts to burn ketones

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.570 
ketones our body starts to burn ketones
for<00:02:36.480> energy<00:02:36.989> and<00:02:37.200> then<00:02:37.290> we<00:02:37.470> start<00:02:37.830> to<00:02:38.040> actually

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:38.580 
for energy and then we start to actually

00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:42.710 
for energy and then we start to actually
burn<00:02:39.209> our<00:02:39.569> own<00:02:39.989> body<00:02:40.500> fat<00:02:40.830> for<00:02:41.190> energy<00:02:41.720> so

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720 
burn our own body fat for energy so

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.839 
burn our own body fat for energy so
that's<00:02:43.650> we're<00:02:43.890> doing<00:02:43.920> that<00:02:44.400> throughout<00:02:44.670> the

00:02:44.839 --> 00:02:44.849 
that's we're doing that throughout the

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:47.240 
that's we're doing that throughout the
whole<00:02:44.940> day<00:02:45.269> to<00:02:45.810> optimize<00:02:46.410> fat<00:02:46.709> loss<00:02:46.920> we're

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:47.250 
whole day to optimize fat loss we're

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.100 
whole day to optimize fat loss we're
putting<00:02:47.519> our<00:02:47.640> bodies<00:02:47.760> in<00:02:48.060> a<00:02:48.150> ketogenic<00:02:48.810> state

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:49.110 
putting our bodies in a ketogenic state

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:52.759 
putting our bodies in a ketogenic state
or<00:02:49.769> carb<00:02:50.370> deprived<00:02:50.790> state<00:02:51.150> and<00:02:51.510> then<00:02:52.380> a<00:02:52.410> night

00:02:52.759 --> 00:02:52.769 
or carb deprived state and then a night

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:55.369 
or carb deprived state and then a night
time<00:02:52.980> is<00:02:53.190> when<00:02:53.370> we<00:02:53.519> have<00:02:53.760> high<00:02:54.450> sugar<00:02:54.870> carbs

00:02:55.369 --> 00:02:55.379 
time is when we have high sugar carbs

00:02:55.379 --> 00:03:00.770 
time is when we have high sugar carbs
now<00:02:56.690> this<00:02:57.690> all<00:02:57.959> affects<00:02:58.379> our<00:02:58.700> insulin<00:02:59.700> and<00:02:59.940> the

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:00.780 
now this all affects our insulin and the

00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:02.449 
now this all affects our insulin and the
effect<00:03:01.170> that<00:03:01.319> insulin<00:03:01.650> has<00:03:01.769> on<00:03:02.010> delivering

00:03:02.449 --> 00:03:02.459 
effect that insulin has on delivering

00:03:02.459 --> 00:03:05.559 
effect that insulin has on delivering
nutrients<00:03:03.000> into<00:03:03.150> muscle<00:03:03.629> or<00:03:03.870> to<00:03:04.349> batis<00:03:04.739> you<00:03:04.890> so

00:03:05.559 --> 00:03:05.569 
nutrients into muscle or to batis you so

00:03:05.569 --> 00:03:08.420 
nutrients into muscle or to batis you so
with<00:03:06.569> insulin<00:03:07.140> it's<00:03:07.349> the<00:03:07.590> nutrient<00:03:08.129> delivery

00:03:08.420 --> 00:03:08.430 
with insulin it's the nutrient delivery

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.580 
with insulin it's the nutrient delivery
hormone<00:03:09.180> so<00:03:09.480> it<00:03:09.810> can<00:03:10.019> actually<00:03:10.170> deliver

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:10.590 
hormone so it can actually deliver

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.319 
hormone so it can actually deliver
nutrients<00:03:11.129> into<00:03:11.250> our<00:03:11.430> muscle<00:03:11.760> tissue<00:03:11.940> and

00:03:12.319 --> 00:03:12.329 
nutrients into our muscle tissue and

00:03:12.329 --> 00:03:13.879 
nutrients into our muscle tissue and
affect<00:03:12.690> whether<00:03:13.079> or<00:03:13.230> not<00:03:13.290> our<00:03:13.440> muscle<00:03:13.739> tissue

00:03:13.879 --> 00:03:13.889 
affect whether or not our muscle tissue

00:03:13.889 --> 00:03:16.789 
affect whether or not our muscle tissue
grows<00:03:14.310> or<00:03:14.819> shrinks<00:03:14.900> but<00:03:15.900> it<00:03:16.170> can<00:03:16.290> also<00:03:16.440> do<00:03:16.680> the

00:03:16.789 --> 00:03:16.799 
grows or shrinks but it can also do the

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:19.280 
grows or shrinks but it can also do the
same<00:03:16.829> thing<00:03:17.310> with<00:03:17.850> our<00:03:17.880> fat<00:03:18.239> tissue<00:03:18.290> insulin

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:19.290 
same thing with our fat tissue insulin

00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:21.080 
same thing with our fat tissue insulin
will<00:03:19.470> deliver<00:03:19.799> nutrients<00:03:20.430> into<00:03:20.609> our<00:03:20.819> fat

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:21.090 
will deliver nutrients into our fat

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.090 
will deliver nutrients into our fat
tissue<00:03:21.120> and<00:03:21.780> can<00:03:22.290> make<00:03:22.410> our<00:03:22.530> batch<00:03:22.709> you<00:03:22.920> should

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:23.100 
tissue and can make our batch you should

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:24.800 
tissue and can make our batch you should
grow<00:03:23.340> or<00:03:23.970> can<00:03:24.150> also<00:03:24.209> make<00:03:24.480> our<00:03:24.599> fat<00:03:24.780> tissue

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:24.810 
grow or can also make our fat tissue

00:03:24.810 --> 00:03:27.080 
grow or can also make our fat tissue
shrink<00:03:25.470> so<00:03:25.980> we<00:03:26.160> want<00:03:26.340> our<00:03:26.400> fat<00:03:26.579> tissue<00:03:26.609> to

00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:27.090 
shrink so we want our fat tissue to

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:28.550 
shrink so we want our fat tissue to
shrink<00:03:27.389> and<00:03:27.569> we<00:03:27.630> want<00:03:27.810> our<00:03:27.840> muscles<00:03:28.200> to<00:03:28.440> grow

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:28.560 
shrink and we want our muscles to grow

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.949 
shrink and we want our muscles to grow
and<00:03:28.980> that's<00:03:29.400> how<00:03:29.639> we're<00:03:29.910> that's<00:03:30.630> how<00:03:30.780> we're

00:03:30.949 --> 00:03:30.959 
and that's how we're that's how we're

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:34.490 
and that's how we're that's how we're
gonna<00:03:31.079> apply<00:03:31.650> carb<00:03:32.160> backloading<00:03:32.540> so<00:03:33.540> what's

00:03:34.490 --> 00:03:34.500 
gonna apply carb backloading so what's

00:03:34.500 --> 00:03:35.870 
gonna apply carb backloading so what's
important<00:03:34.859> to<00:03:34.920> understand<00:03:35.280> about<00:03:35.370> insulin

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880 
important to understand about insulin

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:37.729 
important to understand about insulin
when<00:03:36.450> it<00:03:36.569> comes<00:03:36.780> to<00:03:37.049> fat<00:03:37.230> burning<00:03:37.560> and<00:03:37.650> muscle

00:03:37.729 --> 00:03:37.739 
when it comes to fat burning and muscle

00:03:37.739 --> 00:03:40.009 
when it comes to fat burning and muscle
growth<00:03:38.099> is<00:03:38.400> that<00:03:38.880> are<00:03:39.239> especially<00:03:39.540> with<00:03:39.810> fat

00:03:40.009 --> 00:03:40.019 
growth is that are especially with fat

00:03:40.019 --> 00:03:42.979 
growth is that are especially with fat
burning<00:03:40.410> when<00:03:41.160> insulin<00:03:41.700> is<00:03:42.030> present<00:03:42.750> in<00:03:42.900> our

00:03:42.979 --> 00:03:42.989 
burning when insulin is present in our

00:03:42.989 --> 00:03:46.610 
burning when insulin is present in our
blood<00:03:43.319> it's<00:03:43.950> very<00:03:44.639> difficult<00:03:45.419> to<00:03:45.900> burn<00:03:46.139> body

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:46.620 
blood it's very difficult to burn body

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:50.659 
blood it's very difficult to burn body
fat<00:03:46.849> but<00:03:47.849> when<00:03:48.060> insulin<00:03:48.660> is<00:03:48.870> low<00:03:48.930> or<00:03:49.919> not

00:03:50.659 --> 00:03:50.669 
fat but when insulin is low or not

00:03:50.669 --> 00:03:53.629 
fat but when insulin is low or not
present<00:03:51.180> in<00:03:51.329> our<00:03:51.419> blood<00:03:51.690> our<00:03:52.109> fat<00:03:53.099> burning<00:03:53.489> is

00:03:53.629 --> 00:03:53.639 
present in our blood our fat burning is

00:03:53.639 --> 00:03:55.879 
present in our blood our fat burning is
amped<00:03:54.150> up<00:03:54.239> and<00:03:54.450> elevated<00:03:55.169> and<00:03:55.349> fired<00:03:55.680> up

00:03:55.879 --> 00:03:55.889 
amped up and elevated and fired up

00:03:55.889 --> 00:03:58.550 
amped up and elevated and fired up
through<00:03:56.099> the<00:03:56.160> roof<00:03:56.340> so<00:03:57.180> anytime<00:03:57.720> we<00:03:57.930> eat<00:03:58.260> any

00:03:58.550 --> 00:03:58.560 
through the roof so anytime we eat any

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.379 
through the roof so anytime we eat any
kind<00:03:58.950> of<00:03:59.040> carbohydrates<00:03:59.669> especially<00:04:00.239> during

00:04:00.379 --> 00:04:00.389 
kind of carbohydrates especially during

00:04:00.389 --> 00:04:03.020 
kind of carbohydrates especially during
the<00:04:00.540> daytime<00:04:00.870> and<00:04:01.200> I<00:04:02.099> mean<00:04:02.310> like<00:04:02.489> any<00:04:02.700> carbs

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:03.030 
the daytime and I mean like any carbs

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:05.330 
the daytime and I mean like any carbs
like<00:04:03.239> for<00:04:03.989> example<00:04:04.049> healthy<00:04:04.680> carbohydrates

00:04:05.330 --> 00:04:05.340 
like for example healthy carbohydrates

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:07.520 
like for example healthy carbohydrates
complex<00:04:05.819> carbohydrates<00:04:06.510> like<00:04:06.599> brown<00:04:06.959> rice<00:04:07.260> or

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:07.530 
complex carbohydrates like brown rice or

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:08.300 
complex carbohydrates like brown rice or
Vogt<00:04:07.829> meal

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:08.310 
Vogt meal

00:04:08.310 --> 00:04:10.580 
Vogt meal
well<00:04:08.790> that<00:04:09.359> brown<00:04:09.569> rice<00:04:09.810> or<00:04:09.959> that<00:04:10.109> oatmeal<00:04:10.260> is

00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:10.590 
well that brown rice or that oatmeal is

00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:13.240 
well that brown rice or that oatmeal is
gonna<00:04:10.799> cause<00:04:11.010> a<00:04:11.040> spike<00:04:11.579> in<00:04:11.760> our<00:04:11.880> insulin

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:13.250 
gonna cause a spike in our insulin

00:04:13.250 --> 00:04:15.040 
gonna cause a spike in our insulin
that<00:04:13.880> means<00:04:14.120> that<00:04:14.420> it's<00:04:14.570> gonna<00:04:14.630> be<00:04:14.840> a<00:04:14.870> lot

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:15.050 
that means that it's gonna be a lot

00:04:15.050 --> 00:04:17.530 
that means that it's gonna be a lot
harder<00:04:15.080> to<00:04:15.620> burn<00:04:16.070> body<00:04:16.489> fat<00:04:16.610> instead<00:04:17.209> our

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:17.540 
harder to burn body fat instead our

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:19.300 
harder to burn body fat instead our
body's<00:04:17.780> gonna<00:04:17.959> happen<00:04:18.260> to<00:04:18.320> burn<00:04:18.530> those<00:04:18.769> carbs

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:19.310 
body's gonna happen to burn those carbs

00:04:19.310 --> 00:04:21.460 
body's gonna happen to burn those carbs
as<00:04:19.489> an<00:04:19.610> energy<00:04:19.940> source<00:04:20.180> and<00:04:20.540> we<00:04:21.170> don't<00:04:21.320> want

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:21.470 
as an energy source and we don't want

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:23.230 
as an energy source and we don't want
that<00:04:21.620> we<00:04:21.829> want<00:04:21.859> to<00:04:22.070> burn<00:04:22.220> fat<00:04:22.580> as<00:04:22.790> an<00:04:22.940> energy

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:23.240 
that we want to burn fat as an energy

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:25.240 
that we want to burn fat as an energy
source<00:04:23.270> and<00:04:23.750> not<00:04:24.140> have<00:04:24.740> to<00:04:24.890> worry<00:04:25.100> about

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:25.250 
source and not have to worry about

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:29.340 
source and not have to worry about
burning<00:04:25.940> carbs<00:04:26.600> so<00:04:27.410> with<00:04:28.310> carb<00:04:28.940> backloading

00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:29.350 
burning carbs so with carb backloading

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:31.690 
burning carbs so with carb backloading
we<00:04:30.350> don't<00:04:30.680> have<00:04:30.860> any<00:04:31.070> carbohydrates

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:31.700 
we don't have any carbohydrates

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:33.370 
we don't have any carbohydrates
throughout<00:04:31.970> the<00:04:32.090> day<00:04:32.270> so<00:04:32.330> that<00:04:32.840> that<00:04:33.020> way<00:04:33.200> we

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:33.380 
throughout the day so that that way we

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:35.440 
throughout the day so that that way we
keep<00:04:33.590> our<00:04:33.800> insulin<00:04:34.310> levels<00:04:34.580> low<00:04:34.820> and<00:04:35.180> that

00:04:35.440 --> 00:04:35.450 
keep our insulin levels low and that

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:37.180 
keep our insulin levels low and that
keeps<00:04:35.720> us<00:04:35.930> at<00:04:36.110> an<00:04:36.230> elevated<00:04:36.650> fat-burning

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:37.190 
keeps us at an elevated fat-burning

00:04:37.190 --> 00:04:40.450 
keeps us at an elevated fat-burning
state<00:04:37.520> throughout<00:04:37.850> the<00:04:38.030> whole<00:04:38.180> day<00:04:39.400> okay<00:04:40.400> so

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:40.460 
state throughout the whole day okay so

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:43.210 
state throughout the whole day okay so
now<00:04:40.730> at<00:04:41.000> night<00:04:41.300> time<00:04:41.600> like<00:04:42.140> I<00:04:42.230> said<00:04:42.260> this<00:04:42.950> is

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:43.220 
now at night time like I said this is

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:46.120 
now at night time like I said this is
when<00:04:43.490> the<00:04:44.030> fun<00:04:44.270> begins<00:04:44.350> where<00:04:45.350> we<00:04:45.620> can<00:04:45.980> have

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:46.130 
when the fun begins where we can have

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:48.130 
when the fun begins where we can have
carbohydrates<00:04:46.970> now<00:04:47.510> it<00:04:47.630> depends<00:04:47.870> on<00:04:47.990> our

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:48.140 
carbohydrates now it depends on our

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:49.570 
carbohydrates now it depends on our
schedule<00:04:48.590> it<00:04:48.710> depends<00:04:48.980> on<00:04:49.040> what<00:04:49.160> time<00:04:49.340> we<00:04:49.400> wake

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:49.580 
schedule it depends on what time we wake

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:51.340 
schedule it depends on what time we wake
up<00:04:49.760> what<00:04:50.000> time<00:04:50.150> we<00:04:50.240> go<00:04:50.330> to<00:04:50.390> bed<00:04:50.540> at<00:04:50.690> night<00:04:50.840> but

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:51.350 
up what time we go to bed at night but

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:53.230 
up what time we go to bed at night but
generally<00:04:51.890> based<00:04:52.430> off<00:04:52.670> kind<00:04:53.000> of<00:04:53.030> like<00:04:53.150> an

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:53.240 
generally based off kind of like an

00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:55.720 
generally based off kind of like an
average<00:04:53.420> daily<00:04:53.870> schedule<00:04:54.440> usually<00:04:55.010> around<00:04:55.280> 6

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:55.730 
average daily schedule usually around 6

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:58.210 
average daily schedule usually around 6
o'clock<00:04:55.970> or<00:04:56.120> so<00:04:56.450> and<00:04:56.780> then<00:04:57.230> past<00:04:57.620> that<00:04:57.770> all<00:04:58.130> the

00:04:58.210 --> 00:04:58.220 
o'clock or so and then past that all the

00:04:58.220 --> 00:04:59.410 
o'clock or so and then past that all the
times<00:04:58.460> that<00:04:58.610> we<00:04:58.820> can<00:04:58.940> have<00:04:59.060> our<00:04:59.090> first

00:04:59.410 --> 00:04:59.420 
times that we can have our first

00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:02.830 
times that we can have our first
carbohydrate<00:05:00.320> meal<00:05:00.560> so<00:05:01.310> now<00:05:01.910> at<00:05:02.300> night<00:05:02.570> time

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:02.840 
carbohydrate meal so now at night time

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:05.920 
carbohydrate meal so now at night time
this<00:05:03.500> is<00:05:03.680> all<00:05:03.860> gonna<00:05:04.700> affect<00:05:05.150> muscle<00:05:05.630> growth

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:05.930 
this is all gonna affect muscle growth

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:09.100 
this is all gonna affect muscle growth
yeah<00:05:06.290> so<00:05:07.070> at<00:05:07.490> night<00:05:07.760> time<00:05:08.030> we<00:05:08.660> need<00:05:08.840> for<00:05:09.080> sure

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:09.110 
yeah so at night time we need for sure

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:11.110 
yeah so at night time we need for sure
protein<00:05:09.650> for<00:05:09.980> our<00:05:10.130> first<00:05:10.460> of<00:05:10.790> two

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:11.120 
protein for our first of two

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:13.090 
protein for our first of two
carbohydrate<00:05:11.750> meals<00:05:11.960> so<00:05:12.350> we<00:05:12.470> can<00:05:12.860> have<00:05:12.950> any

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:13.100 
carbohydrate meals so we can have any

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:15.090 
carbohydrate meals so we can have any
protein<00:05:13.370> source<00:05:13.760> chicken<00:05:14.330> lean<00:05:14.750> ground<00:05:14.930> beef

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:15.100 
protein source chicken lean ground beef

00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:19.630 
protein source chicken lean ground beef
steak<00:05:17.320> ground<00:05:18.320> turkey<00:05:18.500> any<00:05:18.830> kind<00:05:19.070> of<00:05:19.100> any<00:05:19.430> kind

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:19.640 
steak ground turkey any kind of any kind

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:21.909 
steak ground turkey any kind of any kind
of<00:05:19.669> protein<00:05:20.090> and<00:05:20.470> high<00:05:21.470> glycemic

00:05:21.909 --> 00:05:21.919 
of protein and high glycemic

00:05:21.919 --> 00:05:25.750 
of protein and high glycemic
carbohydrates<00:05:23.080> so<00:05:24.080> we<00:05:24.860> don't<00:05:25.040> want<00:05:25.220> complex

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:25.760 
carbohydrates so we don't want complex

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:27.490 
carbohydrates so we don't want complex
carbohydrates<00:05:26.419> at<00:05:26.600> night<00:05:26.780> time<00:05:27.020> and<00:05:27.230> the

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:27.500 
carbohydrates at night time and the

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:30.340 
carbohydrates at night time and the
reason<00:05:27.770> why<00:05:27.919> we<00:05:28.130> don't<00:05:28.340> want<00:05:28.729> to<00:05:29.090> be<00:05:29.750> healthier

00:05:30.340 --> 00:05:30.350 
reason why we don't want to be healthier

00:05:30.350 --> 00:05:32.890 
reason why we don't want to be healthier
with<00:05:30.560> our<00:05:30.710> carbs<00:05:31.100> at<00:05:31.280> night<00:05:31.310> is<00:05:31.790> because<00:05:32.330> if<00:05:32.780> we

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:32.900 
with our carbs at night is because if we

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:35.590 
with our carbs at night is because if we
were<00:05:33.050> to<00:05:33.169> choose<00:05:33.410> oatmeal<00:05:33.979> or<00:05:34.460> brown<00:05:34.850> rice<00:05:35.210> at

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:35.600 
were to choose oatmeal or brown rice at

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:37.780 
were to choose oatmeal or brown rice at
nighttime<00:05:36.140> as<00:05:36.710> our<00:05:36.919> carbohydrate<00:05:37.490> source

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:37.790 
nighttime as our carbohydrate source

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:40.750 
nighttime as our carbohydrate source
those<00:05:38.690> types<00:05:38.930> of<00:05:39.020> carbohydrates<00:05:39.320> digest<00:05:40.220> too

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:40.760 
those types of carbohydrates digest too

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:43.840 
those types of carbohydrates digest too
slow<00:05:41.240> so<00:05:41.600> it<00:05:42.290> causes<00:05:42.650> a<00:05:42.740> spike<00:05:43.070> in<00:05:43.250> our<00:05:43.370> insulin

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:43.850 
slow so it causes a spike in our insulin

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:46.360 
slow so it causes a spike in our insulin
but<00:05:44.390> it<00:05:44.510> gives<00:05:44.750> insulin<00:05:45.320> levels<00:05:45.620> sustained<00:05:46.130> in

00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:46.370 
but it gives insulin levels sustained in

00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:48.610 
but it gives insulin levels sustained in
our<00:05:46.490> body<00:05:46.700> for<00:05:47.000> several<00:05:47.390> hours<00:05:47.479> we<00:05:48.320> don't<00:05:48.410> want

00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:48.620 
our body for several hours we don't want

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:50.800 
our body for several hours we don't want
that<00:05:48.770> because<00:05:49.310> when<00:05:49.700> insulin<00:05:50.090> is<00:05:50.300> present<00:05:50.750> in

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:50.810 
that because when insulin is present in

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:53.890 
that because when insulin is present in
the<00:05:50.900> blood<00:05:51.110> it's<00:05:51.830> harder<00:05:52.340> to<00:05:52.430> burn<00:05:52.580> fat<00:05:52.940> so<00:05:53.390> we

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:53.900 
the blood it's harder to burn fat so we

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:55.930 
the blood it's harder to burn fat so we
want<00:05:54.050> a<00:05:54.110> quick<00:05:54.410> spike<00:05:54.770> of<00:05:54.950> insulin<00:05:55.340> to<00:05:55.460> shuttle

00:05:55.930 --> 00:05:55.940 
want a quick spike of insulin to shuttle

00:05:55.940 --> 00:05:57.580 
want a quick spike of insulin to shuttle
and<00:05:56.060> deliver<00:05:56.360> nutrients<00:05:56.930> into<00:05:57.110> our<00:05:57.290> muscle

00:05:57.580 --> 00:05:57.590 
and deliver nutrients into our muscle

00:05:57.590 --> 00:06:00.040 
and deliver nutrients into our muscle
tissue<00:05:57.800> but<00:05:58.580> then<00:05:58.820> we<00:05:59.240> want<00:05:59.450> our<00:05:59.540> blood<00:05:59.750> sugar

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:00.050 
tissue but then we want our blood sugar

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:02.980 
tissue but then we want our blood sugar
levels<00:06:00.500> and<00:06:00.650> our<00:06:01.180> insulin<00:06:02.180> to<00:06:02.390> return<00:06:02.810> to

00:06:02.980 --> 00:06:02.990 
levels and our insulin to return to

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:05.050 
levels and our insulin to return to
normal<00:06:03.110> and<00:06:03.470> clear<00:06:03.770> our<00:06:03.890> blood<00:06:04.130> stream<00:06:04.250> so

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:05.060 
normal and clear our blood stream so

00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:07.360 
normal and clear our blood stream so
that<00:06:05.090> way<00:06:05.450> we're<00:06:05.630> back<00:06:05.960> to<00:06:06.650> a<00:06:06.680> fat-burning

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:07.370 
that way we're back to a fat-burning

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:10.750 
that way we're back to a fat-burning
state<00:06:07.760> so<00:06:08.660> we<00:06:08.840> need<00:06:09.020> high<00:06:09.560> glycemic<00:06:09.830> or<00:06:10.400> high

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:10.760 
state so we need high glycemic or high

00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:13.210 
state so we need high glycemic or high
sugar<00:06:11.180> high<00:06:11.210> starts<00:06:11.870> carbs<00:06:12.290> that<00:06:12.770> digest

00:06:13.210 --> 00:06:13.220 
sugar high starts carbs that digest

00:06:13.220 --> 00:06:15.070 
sugar high starts carbs that digest
really<00:06:13.490> quick<00:06:13.729> that<00:06:14.300> are<00:06:14.450> in<00:06:14.570> our<00:06:14.660> system

00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:15.080 
really quick that are in our system

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:15.710 
really quick that are in our system
falling<00:06:15.410> about

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:15.720 
falling about

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:18.890 
falling about
our<00:06:15.810> and<00:06:16.170> then<00:06:16.590> we<00:06:17.010> go<00:06:17.130> back<00:06:17.310> to<00:06:17.460> normal<00:06:17.640> so<00:06:18.510> we

00:06:18.890 --> 00:06:18.900 
our and then we go back to normal so we

00:06:18.900 --> 00:06:22.220 
our and then we go back to normal so we
need<00:06:19.290> white<00:06:19.890> rice<00:06:20.100> we<00:06:20.790> need<00:06:20.820> white<00:06:21.330> pasta<00:06:21.570> we

donut it's an ice cream yeah we want
that<00:06:43.230> kind<00:06:43.560> of<00:06:43.650> carbohydrate<00:06:44.430> at<00:06:44.580> nighttime

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:45.150 
that kind of carbohydrate at nighttime

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:48.050 
that kind of carbohydrate at nighttime
sounds<00:06:45.570> crazy<00:06:46.020> but<00:06:46.770> it's<00:06:47.010> smart<00:06:47.400> because

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:48.060 
sounds crazy but it's smart because

00:06:48.060 --> 00:06:51.380 
sounds crazy but it's smart because
those<00:06:48.720> types<00:06:48.930> of<00:06:49.140> carbs<00:06:49.560> they<00:06:50.160> digest<00:06:51.090> quick

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:51.390 
those types of carbs they digest quick

00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:53.300 
those types of carbs they digest quick
they're<00:06:51.690> only<00:06:51.840> in<00:06:52.050> our<00:06:52.110> body<00:06:52.290> for<00:06:52.470> an<00:06:52.560> hour<00:06:52.710> we

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:53.310 
they're only in our body for an hour we

00:06:53.310 --> 00:06:55.400 
they're only in our body for an hour we
get<00:06:53.490> a<00:06:53.520> quick<00:06:53.790> spike<00:06:54.120> in<00:06:54.270> insulin<00:06:54.420> quick

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:55.410 
get a quick spike in insulin quick

00:06:55.410 --> 00:06:57.170 
get a quick spike in insulin quick
delivery<00:06:55.800> of<00:06:56.010> nutrients<00:06:56.490> into<00:06:56.670> our<00:06:56.850> muscle

00:06:57.170 --> 00:06:57.180 
delivery of nutrients into our muscle

00:06:57.180 --> 00:07:00.080 
delivery of nutrients into our muscle
tissue<00:06:57.360> and<00:06:57.810> then<00:06:58.320> after<00:06:58.650> an<00:06:58.980> hour<00:06:59.160> our<00:06:59.580> blood

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:00.090 
tissue and then after an hour our blood

00:07:00.090 --> 00:07:01.640 
tissue and then after an hour our blood
sugar<00:07:00.120> levels<00:07:00.720> return<00:07:01.020> to<00:07:01.050> normal<00:07:01.140> and

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:01.650 
sugar levels return to normal and

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:05.000 
sugar levels return to normal and
insulin<00:07:02.400> is<00:07:02.490> gone<00:07:02.730> so<00:07:03.390> now<00:07:03.660> here<00:07:03.930> we<00:07:04.050> are<00:07:04.080> back

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:05.010 
insulin is gone so now here we are back

00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:07.340 
insulin is gone so now here we are back
to<00:07:05.340> this<00:07:05.490> enhanced<00:07:06.060> fat-burning<00:07:06.510> stage<00:07:06.960> and

00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:07.350 
to this enhanced fat-burning stage and

00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:09.680 
to this enhanced fat-burning stage and
we<00:07:07.740> have<00:07:07.890> those<00:07:08.070> carbs<00:07:08.610> that<00:07:09.150> affect<00:07:09.510> muscle

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:09.690 
we have those carbs that affect muscle

00:07:09.690 --> 00:07:13.390 
we have those carbs that affect muscle
growth<00:07:10.020> and<00:07:10.320> are<00:07:10.980> there<00:07:11.280> for<00:07:11.550> the<00:07:11.610> next<00:07:11.760> day<00:07:12.030> so

00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:13.400 
growth and are there for the next day so

00:07:13.400 --> 00:07:15.920 
growth and are there for the next day so
essentially<00:07:14.400> that's<00:07:14.580> carb<00:07:14.910> back<00:07:15.120> loading<00:07:15.150> or

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:15.930 
essentially that's carb back loading or

00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:17.960 
essentially that's carb back loading or
ketogenic<00:07:16.650> throughout<00:07:16.890> the<00:07:17.010> day<00:07:17.190> burning<00:07:17.550> fat

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:17.970 
ketogenic throughout the day burning fat

00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:21.140 
ketogenic throughout the day burning fat
all<00:07:18.330> day<00:07:18.570> long<00:07:18.810> and<00:07:19.770> burning<00:07:20.160> our<00:07:20.220> own<00:07:20.490> fat<00:07:20.880> as

00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:21.150 
all day long and burning our own fat as

00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:23.030 
all day long and burning our own fat as
an<00:07:21.330> energy<00:07:21.630> source<00:07:21.660> rather<00:07:22.200> than<00:07:22.470> carbs<00:07:22.800> as<00:07:22.950> an

00:07:23.030 --> 00:07:23.040 
an energy source rather than carbs as an

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:25.250 
an energy source rather than carbs as an
energy<00:07:23.340> source<00:07:23.370> we're<00:07:24.330> loading<00:07:24.630> up<00:07:24.810> on<00:07:25.020> high

00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:25.260 
energy source we're loading up on high

00:07:25.260 --> 00:07:27.200 
energy source we're loading up on high
starch<00:07:25.620> carbs<00:07:25.980> at<00:07:26.130> night<00:07:26.160> to<00:07:26.700> get<00:07:26.880> quick

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:27.210 
starch carbs at night to get quick

00:07:27.210 --> 00:07:29.120 
starch carbs at night to get quick
nutrient<00:07:27.690> delivering<00:07:28.080> the<00:07:28.169> muscles<00:07:28.530> and<00:07:28.800> to

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:29.130 
nutrient delivering the muscles and to

00:07:29.130 --> 00:07:30.740 
nutrient delivering the muscles and to
have<00:07:29.250> our<00:07:29.370> insulin<00:07:29.880> go<00:07:30.030> back<00:07:30.210> to<00:07:30.360> normal

00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:30.750 
have our insulin go back to normal

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:34.190 
have our insulin go back to normal
so<00:07:31.110> we<00:07:31.380> return<00:07:31.979> to<00:07:32.790> this<00:07:33.090> enhanced<00:07:33.990> back

00:07:34.190 --> 00:07:34.200 
so we return to this enhanced back

00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:36.800 
so we return to this enhanced back
burning<00:07:34.560> state<00:07:34.830> so<00:07:35.610> hopefully<00:07:36.060> that<00:07:36.210> helps<00:07:36.540> if

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:36.810 
burning state so hopefully that helps if
