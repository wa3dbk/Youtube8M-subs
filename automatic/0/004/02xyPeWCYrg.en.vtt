in<00:00:04.140> this<00:00:04.710> lesson<00:00:04.980> we're<00:00:05.279> going<00:00:05.460> to<00:00:05.730> look<00:00:06.149> at

00:00:06.349 --> 00:00:06.359 
in this lesson we're going to look at

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:08.930 
in this lesson we're going to look at
how<00:00:06.479> to<00:00:06.540> create<00:00:06.990> some<00:00:07.290> simple<00:00:07.560> motion<00:00:08.190> but

00:00:08.930 --> 00:00:08.940 
how to create some simple motion but

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:10.330 
how to create some simple motion but
we're<00:00:09.120> not<00:00:09.270> going<00:00:09.570> to<00:00:09.690> use<00:00:09.870> the<00:00:10.049> entire

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:10.340 
we're not going to use the entire

00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:12.499 
we're not going to use the entire
motorcycle<00:00:11.340> assembly<00:00:11.820> we're<00:00:12.000> just<00:00:12.179> going<00:00:12.389> to

00:00:12.499 --> 00:00:12.509 
motorcycle assembly we're just going to

00:00:12.509 --> 00:00:15.160 
motorcycle assembly we're just going to
take<00:00:12.719> the<00:00:12.870> fork<00:00:13.170> so<00:00:13.769> click<00:00:14.280> on<00:00:14.429> the<00:00:14.580> fork<00:00:14.880> and

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:15.170 
take the fork so click on the fork and

00:00:15.170 --> 00:00:18.920 
take the fork so click on the fork and
click<00:00:16.170> the<00:00:16.439> open<00:00:16.800> assembly<00:00:17.130> icon<00:00:18.060> and<00:00:18.330> then

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:18.930 
click the open assembly icon and then

00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:21.710 
click the open assembly icon and then
click<00:00:19.290> the<00:00:19.590> animation<00:00:19.980> tab<00:00:20.609> at<00:00:20.880> the<00:00:21.180> bottom<00:00:21.570> of

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720 
click the animation tab at the bottom of

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.320 
click the animation tab at the bottom of
the<00:00:22.050> feature<00:00:22.289> manager<00:00:22.850> the<00:00:23.850> first<00:00:23.880> type<00:00:24.300> of

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:24.330 
the feature manager the first type of

00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:26.570 
the feature manager the first type of
motion<00:00:24.900> that<00:00:25.019> we<00:00:25.140> want<00:00:25.380> to<00:00:25.529> create<00:00:25.769> is<00:00:26.100> we<00:00:26.400> want

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:26.580 
motion that we want to create is we want

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:28.849 
motion that we want to create is we want
to<00:00:26.699> drive<00:00:27.090> the<00:00:27.420> front<00:00:27.599> wheel<00:00:27.900> to<00:00:28.230> spin<00:00:28.439> and

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859 
to drive the front wheel to spin and

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:31.420 
to drive the front wheel to spin and
we're<00:00:29.490> going<00:00:29.730> to<00:00:29.849> use<00:00:29.939> a<00:00:29.970> motor<00:00:30.420> to<00:00:30.840> do<00:00:30.990> that

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:31.430 
we're going to use a motor to do that

00:00:31.430 --> 00:00:34.369 
we're going to use a motor to do that
motor<00:00:32.430> is<00:00:32.640> going<00:00:32.940> to<00:00:33.180> first<00:00:33.690> allow<00:00:33.989> us<00:00:34.170> to

00:00:34.369 --> 00:00:34.379 
motor is going to first allow us to

00:00:34.379 --> 00:00:37.160 
motor is going to first allow us to
specify<00:00:34.800> a<00:00:35.340> rotary<00:00:35.760> motor<00:00:36.089> or<00:00:36.420> a<00:00:36.449> linear<00:00:36.960> motor

00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:37.170 
specify a rotary motor or a linear motor

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.799 
specify a rotary motor or a linear motor
and<00:00:37.559> we'll<00:00:37.890> stick<00:00:38.220> with<00:00:38.250> a<00:00:38.430> rotary<00:00:38.850> motor<00:00:39.180> then

00:00:39.799 --> 00:00:39.809 
and we'll stick with a rotary motor then

00:00:39.809 --> 00:00:42.950 
and we'll stick with a rotary motor then
the<00:00:39.989> motor<00:00:40.229> location<00:00:41.040> we'll<00:00:41.909> zoom<00:00:42.360> in<00:00:42.629> and

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:42.960 
the motor location we'll zoom in and

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.850 
the motor location we'll zoom in and
select<00:00:43.799> the<00:00:44.339> inside<00:00:45.210> diameter<00:00:45.510> of<00:00:45.900> the<00:00:46.409> front

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:46.860 
select the inside diameter of the front

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.329 
select the inside diameter of the front
cub<00:00:47.159> and<00:00:48.500> SolidWorks<00:00:49.500> establishes<00:00:50.309> a

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:50.339 
cub and SolidWorks establishes a

00:00:50.339 --> 00:00:52.939 
cub and SolidWorks establishes a
rotation<00:00:51.269> direction<00:00:51.449> and<00:00:52.019> that's<00:00:52.320> great<00:00:52.619> if

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
rotation direction and that's great if

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.100 
rotation direction and that's great if
we<00:00:53.070> didn't<00:00:53.309> like<00:00:53.489> that<00:00:53.519> we<00:00:54.059> pivot<00:00:54.659> that<00:00:54.869> the

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:55.110 
we didn't like that we pivot that the

00:00:55.110 --> 00:00:58.250 
we didn't like that we pivot that the
other<00:00:55.260> way<00:00:55.470> and<00:00:55.799> now<00:00:56.729> SolidWorks<00:00:57.390> wants<00:00:57.900> us<00:00:58.049> to

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260 
other way and now SolidWorks wants us to

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.609 
other way and now SolidWorks wants us to
establish<00:00:58.589> a<00:00:59.390> fixed<00:01:00.390> part<00:01:00.690> in<00:01:00.989> the<00:01:01.110> background

00:01:01.609 --> 00:01:01.619 
establish a fixed part in the background

00:01:01.619 --> 00:01:05.440 
establish a fixed part in the background
so<00:01:01.920> this<00:01:02.489> would<00:01:02.790> be<00:01:03.030> if<00:01:03.269> we<00:01:03.449> use<00:01:03.689> our<00:01:03.900> tree<00:01:04.369> the

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:05.450 
so this would be if we use our tree the

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:08.050 
so this would be if we use our tree the
motorcycle<00:01:06.450> tree<00:01:06.720> bottom

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:08.060 
motorcycle tree bottom

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.649 
motorcycle tree bottom
and<00:01:08.170> from<00:01:09.170> here<00:01:09.500> constant<00:01:10.159> speed<00:01:10.460> at<00:01:10.759> 100<00:01:11.540> rpm

00:01:11.649 --> 00:01:11.659 
and from here constant speed at 100 rpm

00:01:11.659 --> 00:01:14.170 
and from here constant speed at 100 rpm
that<00:01:12.350> will<00:01:12.829> be<00:01:12.920> fine<00:01:13.189> just<00:01:13.220> enough<00:01:13.820> to<00:01:13.970> show

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:14.180 
that will be fine just enough to show

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:16.719 
that will be fine just enough to show
the<00:01:14.570> wheels<00:01:14.810> spinning<00:01:15.259> around<00:01:15.500> so<00:01:16.340> now<00:01:16.520> we've

00:01:16.719 --> 00:01:16.729 
the wheels spinning around so now we've

00:01:16.729 --> 00:01:20.350 
the wheels spinning around so now we've
got<00:01:16.939> a<00:01:16.970> time<00:01:17.360> frame<00:01:17.780> of<00:01:18.049> 5<00:01:18.890> seconds<00:01:19.430> that<00:01:20.180> the

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:20.360 
got a time frame of 5 seconds that the

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.319 
got a time frame of 5 seconds that the
motor<00:01:20.600> is<00:01:20.750> running<00:01:21.369> so<00:01:22.369> let's<00:01:22.549> click<00:01:23.000> on<00:01:23.180> the

00:01:23.319 --> 00:01:23.329 
motor is running so let's click on the

00:01:23.329 --> 00:01:26.200 
motor is running so let's click on the
calculate<00:01:24.020> button<00:01:24.049> and<00:01:25.060> SolidWorks

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:26.210 
calculate button and SolidWorks

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:29.050 
calculate button and SolidWorks
calculates<00:01:27.020> the<00:01:27.259> motion<00:01:27.619> of<00:01:27.770> the<00:01:27.860> wheel<00:01:28.070> it

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:29.060 
calculates the motion of the wheel it

00:01:29.060 --> 00:01:31.749 
calculates the motion of the wheel it
looks<00:01:29.390> like<00:01:29.600> the<00:01:29.810> brake<00:01:30.110> disc<00:01:30.470> is<00:01:30.829> rotating

00:01:31.749 --> 00:01:31.759 
looks like the brake disc is rotating

00:01:31.759 --> 00:01:34.840 
looks like the brake disc is rotating
backwards<00:01:32.000> but<00:01:32.990> that's<00:01:33.020> just<00:01:33.619> an<00:01:33.860> illusion<00:01:34.159> so

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:34.850 
backwards but that's just an illusion so

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:36.700 
backwards but that's just an illusion so
the<00:01:35.000> next<00:01:35.210> type<00:01:35.479> of<00:01:35.509> motion<00:01:36.110> that<00:01:36.289> we<00:01:36.409> want<00:01:36.619> to

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:36.710 
the next type of motion that we want to

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:40.139 
the next type of motion that we want to
create<00:01:37.039> is<00:01:37.340> the<00:01:38.090> linkage<00:01:38.960> moving<00:01:39.649> up<00:01:39.799> and<00:01:39.950> down

00:01:40.139 --> 00:01:40.149 
create is the linkage moving up and down

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:44.199 
create is the linkage moving up and down
so<00:01:41.149> let's<00:01:41.390> move<00:01:41.600> this<00:01:41.869> time<00:01:42.229> bar<00:01:42.590> back<00:01:43.100> to<00:01:43.429> the

00:01:44.199 --> 00:01:44.209 
so let's move this time bar back to the

00:01:44.209 --> 00:01:49.090 
so let's move this time bar back to the
1<00:01:44.509> second<00:01:45.110> mark<00:01:45.590> and<00:01:46.299> zoom<00:01:47.299> in<00:01:47.649> grab<00:01:48.649> a<00:01:48.679> face<00:01:49.069> of

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:49.100 
1 second mark and zoom in grab a face of

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:54.240 
1 second mark and zoom in grab a face of
our<00:01:49.490> linkage<00:01:50.270> and<00:01:50.630> pull<00:01:51.470> it<00:01:51.619> down

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:54.250 

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:58.710 

move<00:01:54.730> to<00:01:55.270> the<00:01:55.420> two<00:01:55.600> second<00:01:56.080> mark<00:01:56.110> and<00:01:57.540> push<00:01:58.540> it

00:01:58.710 --> 00:01:58.720 
move to the two second mark and push it

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.520 
move to the two second mark and push it
up<00:01:58.870> slightly<00:01:59.520> three<00:02:00.520> second<00:02:00.940> mark

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
up slightly three second mark

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:06.109 
up slightly three second mark
pull<00:02:02.530> it<00:02:02.710> down<00:02:03.150> four<00:02:04.150> second<00:02:04.600> mark

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
pull it down four second mark

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:08.160 
pull it down four second mark
pull<00:02:06.750> it<00:02:06.899> up

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:08.170 
pull it up

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:11.490 
pull it up
and<00:02:08.259> the<00:02:09.160> five-second<00:02:09.940> mark<00:02:10.020> will<00:02:11.020> just<00:02:11.319> let

00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:11.500 
and the five-second mark will just let

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:12.449 
and the five-second mark will just let
it<00:02:11.620> be<00:02:11.800> right<00:02:12.040> there

00:02:12.449 --> 00:02:12.459 
it be right there

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:15.720 
it be right there
so<00:02:13.360> let's<00:02:13.930> now<00:02:14.170> click<00:02:14.500> the<00:02:14.680> calculate<00:02:14.920> again

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:15.730 
so let's now click the calculate again

00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:19.080 
so let's now click the calculate again
and<00:02:16.000> we<00:02:16.959> see<00:02:17.200> SolidWorks<00:02:17.980> going<00:02:18.730> through<00:02:18.970> the

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.090 
and we see SolidWorks going through the

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:21.730 
and we see SolidWorks going through the
motion<00:02:19.510> that<00:02:19.780> we've<00:02:20.260> assigned

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:21.740 
motion that we've assigned

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:25.060 
motion that we've assigned
then<00:02:22.430> go<00:02:23.090> through<00:02:23.360> and<00:02:23.660> delete<00:02:24.440> the<00:02:24.740> gray

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:25.070 
then go through and delete the gray

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:27.700 
then go through and delete the gray
marks<00:02:25.940> these<00:02:26.330> are<00:02:26.630> marks<00:02:27.230> that<00:02:27.380> are<00:02:27.440> being

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:27.710 
marks these are marks that are being

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:30.700 
marks these are marks that are being
imposed<00:02:28.250> on<00:02:28.670> the<00:02:28.970> motion<00:02:29.630> of<00:02:29.750> the<00:02:29.810> linkage<00:02:30.350> by

00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:30.710 
imposed on the motion of the linkage by

00:02:30.710 --> 00:02:32.980 
imposed on the motion of the linkage by
the<00:02:30.770> motion<00:02:31.640> of<00:02:31.760> the<00:02:31.910> wheel<00:02:32.150> so<00:02:32.540> let's<00:02:32.810> go

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:32.990 
the motion of the wheel so let's go

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:35.559 
the motion of the wheel so let's go
through<00:02:33.230> and<00:02:33.440> recalculate

00:02:35.559 --> 00:02:35.569 
through and recalculate

00:02:35.569 --> 00:02:37.869 
through and recalculate
and<00:02:35.659> notice<00:02:36.469> now<00:02:36.650> the<00:02:36.709> motion<00:02:37.189> is<00:02:37.519> somewhat

00:02:37.869 --> 00:02:37.879 
and notice now the motion is somewhat

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:41.050 
and notice now the motion is somewhat
smoother<00:02:38.590> the<00:02:39.590> mark<00:02:39.829> at<00:02:39.980> the<00:02:40.129> end<00:02:40.159> at<00:02:40.700> the<00:02:40.760> four

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:41.060 
smoother the mark at the end at the four

00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:43.899 
smoother the mark at the end at the four
second<00:02:41.480> mark<00:02:41.689> is<00:02:41.900> red<00:02:42.349> so<00:02:42.920> let's<00:02:43.219> delete<00:02:43.549> that

00:02:43.899 --> 00:02:43.909 
second mark is red so let's delete that

00:02:43.909 --> 00:02:46.059 
second mark is red so let's delete that
mark<00:02:44.209> click<00:02:44.659> on<00:02:44.840> it<00:02:44.989> and<00:02:45.109> press<00:02:45.170> the<00:02:45.769> lead<00:02:45.920> on

00:02:46.059 --> 00:02:46.069 
mark click on it and press the lead on

00:02:46.069 --> 00:02:48.879 
mark click on it and press the lead on
the<00:02:46.159> keyboard<00:02:46.549> then<00:02:47.319> reposition<00:02:48.319> the<00:02:48.620> time

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:48.889 
the keyboard then reposition the time

00:02:48.889 --> 00:02:51.330 
the keyboard then reposition the time
bar<00:02:49.189> to<00:02:49.489> four<00:02:49.790> seconds

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:51.340 
bar to four seconds

00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:54.839 
bar to four seconds
and<00:02:52.230> should<00:02:53.230> be<00:02:53.410> able<00:02:53.590> to<00:02:53.769> go<00:02:54.340> through<00:02:54.610> this

00:02:54.839 --> 00:02:54.849 
and should be able to go through this

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:57.520 
and should be able to go through this
with<00:02:55.180> the<00:02:55.300> time-bar<00:02:55.840> only

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:57.530 
with the time-bar only

00:02:57.530 --> 00:03:01.600 
with the time-bar only
that<00:02:58.340> seems<00:02:58.670> to<00:02:58.819> be<00:02:58.850> correct<00:02:59.800> so<00:03:00.800> let's<00:03:01.190> hit

00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:01.610 
that seems to be correct so let's hit

00:03:01.610 --> 00:03:08.089 
that seems to be correct so let's hit
the<00:03:01.730> recalculate

00:03:08.089 --> 00:03:08.099 

00:03:08.099 --> 00:03:13.089 

all<00:03:08.700> right<00:03:08.939> so<00:03:09.689> now<00:03:10.189> reset<00:03:11.189> the<00:03:11.340> four<00:03:11.579> seconds

00:03:13.089 --> 00:03:13.099 
all right so now reset the four seconds

00:03:13.099 --> 00:03:15.809 
all right so now reset the four seconds
zoom<00:03:14.099> in<00:03:14.310> here

00:03:15.809 --> 00:03:15.819 
zoom in here

00:03:15.819 --> 00:03:18.460 
zoom in here
push<00:03:16.569> this<00:03:16.840> up

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:18.470 
push this up

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:22.470 
push this up
and<00:03:18.560> then<00:03:19.250> recalculate

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:22.480 

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:23.970 

pull<00:03:23.230> it<00:03:23.379> back<00:03:23.410> to<00:03:23.770> the

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
pull it back to the

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:25.520 
pull it back to the
getting

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:25.530 
getting

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:30.630 
getting
and<00:03:25.620> play<00:03:26.610> from<00:03:26.850> start

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:30.640 

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:32.850 

so<00:03:31.150> we<00:03:31.300> get<00:03:31.450> the<00:03:31.600> motion<00:03:32.020> of<00:03:32.140> the<00:03:32.230> wheel<00:03:32.440> going

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:32.860 
so we get the motion of the wheel going

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:35.010 
so we get the motion of the wheel going
up<00:03:32.980> and<00:03:33.220> down<00:03:33.400> and<00:03:33.730> the<00:03:34.210> wheels<00:03:34.390> spinning<00:03:34.780> at

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:35.020 
up and down and the wheels spinning at

00:03:35.020 --> 00:03:37.680 
up and down and the wheels spinning at
the<00:03:35.140> same<00:03:35.350> time
