00:04:01.879 --> 00:04:04.339 

this<00:04:02.879> becomes<00:04:03.209> frame<00:04:03.540> bore<00:04:03.840> but<00:04:04.049> he's

00:04:04.339 --> 00:04:04.349 
this becomes frame bore but he's

00:04:04.349 --> 00:04:08.630 
this becomes frame bore but he's
thinking<00:04:04.769> maximum<00:04:06.409> 73<00:04:07.409> just<00:04:07.980> that<00:04:08.159> red<00:04:08.430> that's

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:08.640 
thinking maximum 73 just that red that's

00:04:08.640 --> 00:04:12.099 
thinking maximum 73 just that red that's
slightly<00:04:09.239> awkward<00:04:09.360> next<00:04:09.840> to<00:04:09.900> the<00:04:10.019> pink<00:04:10.200> there

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:12.109 
slightly awkward next to the pink there

00:04:12.109 --> 00:04:15.349 
slightly awkward next to the pink there

00:04:16.939 --> 00:04:16.949 
history in the last of those was made by

00:04:16.949 --> 00:04:18.469 
history in the last of those was made by
Stephen<00:04:17.370> Hendry<00:04:17.609> at<00:04:17.729> the<00:04:17.789> Welsh<00:04:17.970> Open<00:04:18.389> and

00:04:18.469 --> 00:04:18.479 
Stephen Hendry at the Welsh Open and

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:20.810 
Stephen Hendry at the Welsh Open and
that<00:04:18.630> meant<00:04:18.870> that<00:04:19.049> he<00:04:19.650> had<00:04:19.919> tied<00:04:20.190> O'Sullivan

00:04:20.810 --> 00:04:20.820 
that meant that he had tied O'Sullivan

00:04:20.820 --> 00:04:22.580 
that meant that he had tied O'Sullivan
once<00:04:21.539> again<00:04:21.750> at<00:04:21.840> the<00:04:21.930> top<00:04:22.079> of<00:04:22.199> the<00:04:22.259> list<00:04:22.380> of<00:04:22.530> a

once again at the top of the list of a

00:04:22.590 --> 00:04:25.670 
once again at the top of the list of a
10<00:04:22.889> each<00:04:23.070> so<00:04:23.910> this<00:04:24.060> would<00:04:24.300> be<00:04:24.570> for<00:04:25.229> O'Sullivan

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:25.680 
10 each so this would be for O'Sullivan

00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:28.340 
10 each so this would be for O'Sullivan
to<00:04:26.240> retake<00:04:27.240> the<00:04:27.570> lead<00:04:27.600> in<00:04:27.960> that<00:04:28.020> particular
