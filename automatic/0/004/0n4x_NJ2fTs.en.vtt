00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:05.720
 greetings youtubers as you can see in the 

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:08.029
 description or in the title of the video 

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:11.419
 here I bring you this monopoly game 

00:00:08.029 --> 00:00:13.809
 in Spanish so you can enjoy them from 

00:00:11.419 --> 00:00:13.809
 your computer 

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:19.370
 I will do two servers in this case 

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:21.060
 it will be a mediafire 

00:00:19.370 --> 00:00:24.840
 mega 

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:26.369
 in the case of mediafire to host it 

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:29.160
 I'll put in this file that if you open it 

00:00:26.369 --> 00:00:33.150
 so you throw away some error this is for 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.350
 that half fire does not recognize it and what 

00:00:33.150 --> 00:00:38.090
 only you have to do if you're going to 

00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:38.090
 since mediafire is to put point 

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:46.280
 sorry to put weird point 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:49.050
 and ready yachts was a file that you can 

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:51.379
 unzip after these you open the 

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.379
 hedge 

00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:56.530
 you open the hedge and follow is the typical 

00:00:54.760 --> 00:00:58.250
 installation that right now you will be 

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:00.890
 seeing 

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:03.250
 well let's try the game to see 

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:03.250
 How are you 

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:08.310
 well this is the game running 

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:11.470
 this is the game 

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.420
 I understand that this game was 

00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:17.300
 launched in 2003 although there may be 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.760
 see some 

00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:21.470
 one that another year 2012 but I think that with 

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:23.690
 the 2013 so whatever the 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:25.010
 I bring a new fun and the best 

00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:26.870
 of all this in Spanish these are the 

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:28.640
 options excuse me I did not know the 

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:30.700
 part of the bottom is that I do not want to put it 

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:33.549
 in full screen mode 

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:35.200
 here you can change the resolution and the 

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:37.899
 sound effects if you want it to come out 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.429
 If everything is good then it has the mode 

00:01:37.899 --> 00:01:41.920
 teacher that would be little by little 

00:01:39.429 --> 00:01:43.689
 teaching you how to play monopoly and 

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:46.420
 the play method now if you already have 

00:01:43.689 --> 00:01:49.619
 knowledge then more here you can choose 

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:51.819
 how many players want to play 

00:01:49.619 --> 00:01:53.259
 you just add a player like 

00:01:51.819 --> 00:01:55.119
 can see here to the maximum they are four 

00:01:53.259 --> 00:01:57.640
 because they would have to play all in one 

00:01:55.119 --> 00:02:00.429
 same computer and this is something that does not 

00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:02.289
 I see very favorable but good here if 

00:02:00.429 --> 00:02:05.090
 clique until it is activated again 

00:02:02.289 --> 00:02:07.189
 artificial intelligence and choose it 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:09.289
 the difficulty then in the intelligence 

00:02:07.189 --> 00:02:11.390
 artificial is the machine like so 

00:02:09.289 --> 00:02:13.840
 say it to compete against you if you give 

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:16.870
 click on 

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.340
 on the card as it changes the card and the 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:20.709
 light dice is an option that you 

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:24.160
 I recommend that you read is like 

00:02:20.709 --> 00:02:25.810
 save you giving less clicks and all that and 

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:28.030
 As you can see here you can choose 

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:30.890
 any environment of your whim and I 

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:32.870
 I chose this one because I like it a lot 

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:34.910
 in the rules where you can modify them 

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:37.010
 some like the money that starts 

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:40.610
 the money when you go through go and all the 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:42.220
 thing and let's play briefly a 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:44.350
 bit 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:46.600
 As you can see, this interface is 

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:49.240
 all here well sit down there is no one 

00:02:46.600 --> 00:02:50.830
 but here it tells you if you want to play with 

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:54.270
 tutorials let's say yes to 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:57.660
 to see how it looks at the first 

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:59.760
 ok typical thing in this case click 

00:02:57.660 --> 00:03:02.610
 you move agitated agitas as you can 

00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:05.030
 listen to the sound too and now 

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:05.030
 loose 

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:15.030
 and each card has its animation 

00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:17.209
 I'm visiting so it will not happen to me 

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:17.209
 nothing 

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:24.920
 here is an abbreviation of 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:27.710
 the properties as you can see well I 

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:29.720
 I can slide to the other properties and 

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:31.370
 if I click on one I can see the 

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:33.320
 information if you have any owner and 

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:35.870
 everything else because that was all 

00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:38.420

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:40.220
