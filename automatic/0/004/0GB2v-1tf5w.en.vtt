00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:05.540
 we are the next generation mobility 

00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:08.389
 for our software flitzer we test 

00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:10.219
 all e vehicles on the tüv süd market 

00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:12.079
 is our partner and checks that 

00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:14.599
 charging behavior and the ranges of the 

00:00:12.079 --> 00:00:16.400
 vehicles are in our test 

00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:18.320
 on the other hand the driving characteristics and the 

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:21.289
 user-friendliness at the center 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:23.539
 today we are stuck at the ndr and we 

00:00:21.289 --> 00:00:25.640
 test the model s two and a half years 

00:00:23.539 --> 00:00:26.660
 drive long for the tesla roadster and 

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:28.220
 finally it is there 

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:31.220
 we are the first, the ground s 

00:00:28.220 --> 00:00:32.989
 may in germany , the countries from 

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:34.550
 until recently bethesda worked and 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:36.829
 the happy driver will be the same 

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:38.870
 what are your feelings my feelings 

00:00:36.829 --> 00:00:41.930
 I have a red card and you 

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:44.780
 so have a black because of that 

00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:46.760
 the key in your hand and we will 

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:49.250
 Like this piece of jewelery rise and 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:52.780
 the old long-awaited welfare enterprise 

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:52.780
 That worked 

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:07.640
 so what we see is ever off 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.640
 finest 

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.600
 The car has no heads of the car 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:16.200
 just a gigantic understand display 

00:01:12.600 --> 00:01:18.030
 it's just fun to do that right now 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.409
 can not even turn on in the 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:23.009
 inner all I have to do is 

00:01:19.409 --> 00:01:25.640
 just step on the brake and 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:25.640
 Nuance Dragon 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:44.660
 he is a sensational road situation 

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:46.600
 tremendously handy is the reaction 

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:49.640
 just that the spectacular one 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:52.460
 I get a feedback immediately 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:54.710
 press the gas and the car moves 

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:56.420
 So it feels amazing 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:58.010
 handy for that it is quite a 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.619
 big car is what you actually get here 

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:02.180
 So experiencing is a vehicle 

00:02:00.619 --> 00:02:03.650
 not just as an electric vehicle 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:06.380
 clearly convinced but actually 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:08.570
 overall an incredibly good one 

00:02:06.380 --> 00:02:10.369
 vehicle is so there is hardly a car 

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:15.890
 that I've ever driven what in 

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:18.320
 In terms of handling dynamics 

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:19.040
 actually this is the water 

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:21.140
 can reach 

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:23.750
 the noise is so easy 

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:25.730
 extremely elegant extremely pleasant no 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:30.350
 can no noise vibrations 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:31.670
 I think the associations of the electric 

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:32.450
 Drives are so warm 

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:36.730
 have to wear 

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:36.730
 this car proves that will be really good 

00:02:36.880 --> 00:02:43.040
 when the tell us what they think of marcels 

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:44.750
 for that it is sensational yes that 

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:46.810
 is a car that is a good car and 

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:50.950
 It's a car I want to have 

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:54.799
 drives itself gigantically well dynamically 

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:58.670
 energetic insane smoothness that 

00:02:54.799 --> 00:03:00.080
 perfect car now I've also 

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:01.100
 behind tax countries briefly gave me the 

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:03.530
 given and i am natural 

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:04.940
 Immediately it got into the mouth and that 

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:06.860
 what no one knows I have first 

00:03:04.940 --> 00:03:08.480
 created my own passengers 

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:09.890
 that means everything to me 

00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:10.850
 we will now make my name 

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:14.150
 saved 

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:15.410
 luckily nobody of tesla knows that 

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:16.910
 can now different formats here 

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:18.620
 I could be nice here now 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:20.000
 understand everything so I can you mine 

00:03:18.620 --> 00:03:20.510
 units how far I drive 

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.799
 can 

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:24.650
 I might still find a few apps 

00:03:21.799 --> 00:03:26.299
 download homelink let's see what that 

00:03:24.650 --> 00:03:30.799
 is probably the loading platzer 

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:33.250
 do we now sometimes directly ngm munich 

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:36.560
 then we find each other again and again 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:38.450
 munich so what else do we have 

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:40.790
 so we headlines okay so I can 

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:42.230
 lights adjust parking off so we 

00:03:40.790 --> 00:03:44.209
 can here with this display our 

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:44.989
 light and make it true 

00:03:44.209 --> 00:03:46.700
 agility 

00:03:44.989 --> 00:03:48.630
 there is no button to the light 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:51.190
 can make out 

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:53.560
 Okay we have to do it then we do it 

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:55.600
 parking lights on again and do it 

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:58.060
 dear arminia in the back seat 

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:59.740
 sits and films a bit warmer 9 32 

00:03:58.060 --> 00:04:00.690
 but a good team at this 

00:03:59.740 --> 00:04:02.590
 newspaper 

00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:07.210
 I like would also somehow a 

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:14.770
 have fun here is on it 

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:17.230
 made super good that the people of 

00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:19.420
 tesla not at all because they yes we have 

00:04:17.230 --> 00:04:21.130
 out of it about minus five degrees but that 

00:04:19.420 --> 00:04:24.220
 sunroof work is impeccable 

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:27.760
 let's set up from 74 to 80 percent to 

00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:33.520
 provisionally goes and it should again 

00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:34.930
 Too great that's the first time it happens 

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:39.160
 I almost do without a club 

00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:41.170
 More fun driving display car is 

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:45.700
 synonymous useful if you raise the display 

00:04:41.170 --> 00:04:47.080
 tune beautiful trip gates nobody wants to see 

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:50.350
 Andy just drove dead 

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:51.220
 energy consumption at 540 km 12 6 

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:53.050
 kilowatt hours 

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:54.730
 we can do that at tesla on 100 

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:57.370
 kilometer if we are very very efficient 

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:59.050
 drive it more than twice as 

00:04:57.370 --> 00:05:00.580
 inefficiently run as we we do 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:03.400
 really long-range or reddy's 

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:08.110
 drive yes the average consumption is 

00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:11.590
 at 312 watt hours, that's 31 kilowatts 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:12.970
 Of course that's 100 kilometers 

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:14.590
 is already crisp but we have too 

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:16.060
 The car is almost as good as fun 

00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:20.320
 accelerates like our tesla the 

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:21.640
 By the way, there is front and I completely 

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:22.750
 honestly , we hardly expect that 

00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:24.760
 get this vehicle 

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:26.770
 there you can see how ours 

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:29.470
 Energy consumption was several times 

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:30.880
 out of the standard standard of the display 

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:34.090
 but not at Landis driving not 

00:05:30.880 --> 00:05:36.390
 in the middle we see the range 

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:38.500
 this is probably not a touch or 

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:39.490
 is actually the dare I thought 

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:41.470
 I do not remember the key exactly 

00:05:39.490 --> 00:05:43.630
 Below is the key is not here 

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:45.480
 in the vehicle accordingly I can 

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:47.770
 not start now 

00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:48.880
 They sit outside and grin because they are 

00:05:47.770 --> 00:05:50.920
 namely the key to 

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:54.180
 but no matter we pretend that 

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:54.180
 whole car 

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:03.300
 So the model it is almost like a 

00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:04.860
 iphone on four wheels so I still have 

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:07.290
 Never had so much fun in so long 

00:06:04.860 --> 00:06:10.260
 to start a car against dennis 

00:06:07.290 --> 00:06:11.160
 as with the model s this is the absolute 

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:12.990
 madness 

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:14.190
 the driving behavior we just by the 

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:16.320
 Unfortunately I am able to experience rallying 

00:06:14.190 --> 00:06:17.580
 not driven yet but good 

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:20.550
 the backseat has already been noticed for 

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:22.830
 power in the tuesday and so the dare 

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:25.230
 will be great absolute madness 

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:27.240
 I'm afraid that people often times 

00:06:25.230 --> 00:06:29.400
 A traffic light will stay sting where they are 

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:30.930
 actually someone should drive over 

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:33.360
 play around that on the display 

00:06:30.930 --> 00:06:35.720
 but the thing is real 

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:35.720
 plan occurs
