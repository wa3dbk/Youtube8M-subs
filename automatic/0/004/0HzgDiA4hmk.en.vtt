make that a kind of parallelogram and as
the<00:00:20.760> side<00:00:21.029> a<00:00:21.060> slice<00:00:21.420> of<00:00:21.449> the<00:00:21.600> cake<00:00:21.779> facing<00:00:22.260> you

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:22.730 
the side a slice of the cake facing you

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:25.130 
the side a slice of the cake facing you
and<00:00:23.730> this<00:00:23.850> is<00:00:24.000> the<00:00:24.119> top<00:00:24.330> of<00:00:24.359> the<00:00:24.510> cake<00:00:24.840> which<00:00:25.109> is

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140 
and this is the top of the cake which is

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.160 
and this is the top of the cake which is
going<00:00:25.380> to<00:00:25.470> curve<00:00:25.890> around<00:00:26.279> there<00:00:26.880> so<00:00:27.330> a<00:00:27.630> bit

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:28.170 
going to curve around there so a bit

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.990 
going to curve around there so a bit
like<00:00:28.199> a<00:00:28.349> piece<00:00:28.590> of<00:00:28.619> cheese<00:00:29.039> you're<00:00:29.820> going<00:00:29.939> to

things<00:00:49.680> on<00:00:49.980> the<00:00:50.129> top<00:00:50.309> of<00:00:50.430> it<00:00:51.230> now<00:00:52.640> come<00:00:53.640> here

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940 
things on the top of it now come here

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:57.950 
things on the top of it now come here
and<00:00:54.149> we'll<00:00:54.620> draw<00:00:55.620> that<00:00:55.860> sort<00:00:56.280> of<00:00:56.430> nuts<00:00:57.360> bits

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
and we'll draw that sort of nuts bits

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.910 
and we'll draw that sort of nuts bits
some<00:00:58.500> will<00:00:58.739> be<00:00:58.859> sticking<00:00:59.280> up<00:00:59.489> on<00:00:59.789> the<00:00:59.910> top<00:01:00.920> like

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:01.920 
some will be sticking up on the top like

00:01:01.920 --> 00:01:06.109 
some will be sticking up on the top like
that<00:01:01.949> and<00:01:02.460> then<00:01:04.280> this<00:01:05.280> will<00:01:05.460> be<00:01:05.610> the<00:01:05.880> kind<00:01:06.030> of

00:01:06.109 --> 00:01:06.119 
that and then this will be the kind of

00:01:06.119 --> 00:01:10.609 
that and then this will be the kind of
frosting<00:01:06.570> around<00:01:06.689> the<00:01:06.930> edge<00:01:07.189> and<00:01:08.990> here<00:01:09.990> where

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:10.619 
frosting around the edge and here where

00:01:10.619 --> 00:01:13.100 
frosting around the edge and here where
it<00:01:10.770> joins<00:01:11.159> the<00:01:11.400> cakes<00:01:11.760> can<00:01:12.000> be<00:01:12.150> quite<00:01:12.390> crumbly

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:13.110 
it joins the cakes can be quite crumbly

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.840 
it joins the cakes can be quite crumbly
and<00:01:14.030> the<00:01:15.030> cake<00:01:15.240> will<00:01:15.420> come<00:01:15.600> in<00:01:15.810> slightly<00:01:16.439> there

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:16.850 
and the cake will come in slightly there

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:21.580 
and the cake will come in slightly there
and<00:01:17.850> again<00:01:18.450> we<00:01:18.600> want<00:01:18.780> a<00:01:18.869> crumbly<00:01:19.380> kind<00:01:19.680> of<00:01:19.799> edge

00:01:21.580 --> 00:01:21.590 
and again we want a crumbly kind of edge

00:01:21.590 --> 00:01:25.340 
and again we want a crumbly kind of edge
like<00:01:22.590> that<00:01:22.619> I'm<00:01:23.580> coming<00:01:23.850> down<00:01:24.119> here<00:01:24.659> and<00:01:24.869> the

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030 
it jam and this will be quite crumbly

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:43.100 
it jam and this will be quite crumbly
like<00:01:39.299> that<00:01:40.400> we're<00:01:41.400> gonna<00:01:41.549> have<00:01:41.880> more<00:01:42.630> bits<00:01:42.930> of

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:43.110 
like that we're gonna have more bits of

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.730 
like that we're gonna have more bits of
chopped<00:01:43.530> walnuts<00:01:43.979> or<00:01:44.220> whatever<00:01:44.850> they<00:01:45.060> are

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740 
chopped walnuts or whatever they are

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:49.700 
chopped walnuts or whatever they are
coming<00:01:46.740> along<00:01:46.920> there<00:01:47.220> like<00:01:47.520> that<00:01:48.110> and<00:01:49.110> you<00:01:49.530> can

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:49.710 
coming along there like that and you can

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.550 
coming along there like that and you can
put<00:01:49.860> some<00:01:50.040> more<00:01:50.070> in<00:01:50.659> and<00:01:51.659> they<00:01:52.170> might<00:01:52.380> need<00:01:52.500> a

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:52.560 
put some more in and they might need a

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:55.190 
put some more in and they might need a
little<00:01:52.799> bit<00:01:52.920> of<00:01:53.299> shading<00:01:54.299> or<00:01:54.689> something<00:01:55.049> like

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
little bit of shading or something like

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:58.630 
little bit of shading or something like
that<00:01:55.259> just<00:01:55.439> to<00:01:56.149> make<00:01:57.149> them<00:01:57.360> look<00:01:57.570> more<00:01:57.630> obvious

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640 
that just to make them look more obvious

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:02.240 
that just to make them look more obvious
when<00:01:59.640> you<00:01:59.790> are<00:01:59.909> sure<00:02:00.299> it<00:02:00.570> is<00:02:00.689> dry<00:02:01.049> erase<00:02:02.009> the

00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.250 
when you are sure it is dry erase the

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:06.499 
when you are sure it is dry erase the
pencil<00:02:02.460> lines<00:02:03.060> and<00:02:03.659> it<00:02:04.560> can<00:02:04.790> put<00:02:05.790> the<00:02:05.909> jam<00:02:06.210> in

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509 
pencil lines and it can put the jam in

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:12.140 
pencil lines and it can put the jam in
quite<00:02:06.810> dark<00:02:07.550> Jam<00:02:08.550> jelly<00:02:09.830> and<00:02:10.830> then<00:02:11.819> the<00:02:11.940> cake

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:12.150 
quite dark Jam jelly and then the cake

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:13.340 
quite dark Jam jelly and then the cake
itself<00:02:12.569> is<00:02:12.810> going<00:02:13.020> to<00:02:13.080> be

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:13.350 
itself is going to be

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:17.210 
itself is going to be
very<00:02:14.600> crumbly<00:02:15.600> and<00:02:15.630> spotty<00:02:16.320> so<00:02:16.710> we<00:02:16.860> can<00:02:17.040> just

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.220 
very crumbly and spotty so we can just

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.640 
very crumbly and spotty so we can just
put<00:02:17.430> in<00:02:17.610> hundreds<00:02:18.150> and<00:02:18.240> hundreds<00:02:18.570> of<00:02:18.660> dots

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:21.650 

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:23.750 

obviously<00:02:22.650> that<00:02:22.800> was<00:02:22.950> speeded<00:02:23.340> up<00:02:23.460> but<00:02:23.670> he

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:23.760 
obviously that was speeded up but he
