00:00:27.429 --> 00:00:27.439 

00:00:27.439 --> 00:00:30.080 

and<00:00:28.439> that's<00:00:28.680> how<00:00:28.830> you<00:00:28.949> break<00:00:29.130> up<00:00:29.369> the<00:00:29.490> tile<00:00:29.789> you

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079 
and break it up that way but either way

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:35.660 
and break it up that way but either way
the<00:00:34.290> bags<00:00:34.530> or<00:00:34.710> the<00:00:34.739> carpet<00:00:35.190> will<00:00:35.340> keep<00:00:35.520> your

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
the bags or the carpet will keep your

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:37.970 
the bags or the carpet will keep your
tile<00:00:35.910> from<00:00:36.149> flying<00:00:36.420> everywhere<00:00:36.809> now<00:00:37.680> you<00:00:37.739> can

00:00:37.970 --> 00:00:37.980 
tile from flying everywhere now you can

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.590 
tile from flying everywhere now you can
see<00:00:38.250> that<00:00:38.430> we<00:00:38.520> have<00:00:38.700> a<00:00:38.730> lot<00:00:38.969> of<00:00:39.000> different

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:39.600 
see that we have a lot of different

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.510 
see that we have a lot of different
sizes<00:00:39.840> and<00:00:40.200> shapes<00:00:40.260> and<00:00:40.739> this<00:00:41.129> is<00:00:41.309> really

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:41.520 
sizes and shapes and this is really

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:44.680 
sizes and shapes and this is really
going<00:00:41.760> to<00:00:41.879> help<00:00:42.000> the<00:00:42.120> backsplash<00:00:42.629> look<00:00:42.930> nice

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:44.690 
going to help the backsplash look nice

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:47.209 
going to help the backsplash look nice
before<00:00:45.690> you<00:00:45.780> put<00:00:45.960> your<00:00:46.050> broken<00:00:46.379> pieces<00:00:46.620> on<00:00:46.950> you

00:00:47.209 --> 00:00:47.219 
before you put your broken pieces on you

00:00:47.219 --> 00:00:48.770 
before you put your broken pieces on you
want<00:00:47.399> to<00:00:47.460> start<00:00:47.700> with<00:00:47.760> water<00:00:48.059> tiles<00:00:48.360> and<00:00:48.690> you

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:48.780 
want to start with water tiles and you

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.299 
want to start with water tiles and you
can<00:00:48.840> buy<00:00:49.079> the<00:00:49.140> borders<00:00:49.530> at<00:00:49.680> the<00:00:49.800> same<00:00:50.039> time

00:00:50.299 --> 00:00:50.309 
can buy the borders at the same time

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:52.279 
can buy the borders at the same time
that<00:00:50.489> you<00:00:50.550> do<00:00:50.700> your<00:00:50.850> regular<00:00:51.000> tile<00:00:51.510> now<00:00:52.199> the

00:00:52.279 --> 00:00:52.289 
that you do your regular tile now the

00:00:52.289 --> 00:00:53.600 
that you do your regular tile now the
reason<00:00:52.649> that<00:00:52.739> you<00:00:52.860> want<00:00:53.010> to<00:00:53.070> put<00:00:53.190> a<00:00:53.219> border<00:00:53.579> on

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
reason that you want to put a border on

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.010 
reason that you want to put a border on
is<00:00:53.940> because<00:00:54.210> you<00:00:54.300> can<00:00:54.449> see<00:00:54.660> this<00:00:54.780> has<00:00:54.989> a

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020 
is because you can see this has a

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:56.600 
is because you can see this has a
rounded<00:00:55.500> finished<00:00:55.920> edge<00:00:56.160> called<00:00:56.489> a

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:56.610 
rounded finished edge called a

00:00:56.610 --> 00:00:58.760 
rounded finished edge called a
bull-nosed<00:00:57.090> edge<00:00:57.300> so<00:00:57.930> when<00:00:58.050> you<00:00:58.170> put<00:00:58.410> this<00:00:58.530> up

00:00:58.760 --> 00:00:58.770 
bull-nosed edge so when you put this up

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.020 
bull-nosed edge so when you put this up
there<00:00:58.800> around<00:00:59.190> your<00:00:59.309> border<00:00:59.699> it's<00:00:59.789> going<00:00:59.940> to

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
there around your border it's going to

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.180 
there around your border it's going to
look<00:01:00.149> really<00:01:00.210> nice<00:01:00.690> if<00:01:01.410> you<00:01:01.590> just<00:01:01.770> used<00:01:02.039> your

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
look really nice if you just used your

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.579 
look really nice if you just used your
broken<00:01:02.609> pieces<00:01:02.879> for<00:01:03.270> the<00:01:03.329> border<00:01:03.719> you'd<00:01:04.379> see

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
broken pieces for the border you'd see

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.200 
broken pieces for the border you'd see
the<00:01:04.710> unfinished<00:01:05.070> edge<00:01:05.489> and<00:01:05.790> that's<00:01:05.850> not<00:01:06.060> going

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:06.210 
the unfinished edge and that's not going

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:07.850 
the unfinished edge and that's not going
to<00:01:06.299> look<00:01:06.479> quite<00:01:06.659> as<00:01:06.869> nice<00:01:07.020> as<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:07.350> border<00:01:07.680> will

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860 
to look quite as nice as the border will

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.010 
to look quite as nice as the border will
now<00:01:08.490> since<00:01:08.760> our<00:01:08.880> backsplash<00:01:09.240> is<00:01:09.540> gray<00:01:09.810> we

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020 
now since our backsplash is gray we

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.780 
now since our backsplash is gray we
chose<00:01:10.320> black<00:01:10.680> to<00:01:10.950> really<00:01:11.220> highlight<00:01:11.490> an

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:11.790 
chose black to really highlight an

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.120 
chose black to really highlight an

border<00:01:34.650> that<00:01:34.770> you'll<00:01:34.890> be<00:01:34.979> placing<00:01:35.400> the<00:01:35.490> tile

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:39.110 

00:01:39.110 --> 00:01:41.210 

I'm<00:01:40.110> going<00:01:40.320> to<00:01:40.409> start<00:01:40.619> with<00:01:40.710> this<00:01:40.799> corner

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
I'm going to start with this corner

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:42.530 
I'm going to start with this corner
piece<00:01:41.430> and<00:01:41.670> as<00:01:41.729> you<00:01:41.820> can<00:01:41.970> see<00:01:42.240> it<00:01:42.360> has<00:01:42.509> a

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:42.540 
piece and as you can see it has a

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.990 
piece and as you can see it has a
finished<00:01:42.960> edge<00:01:43.170> on<00:01:43.409> both<00:01:43.649> sides<00:01:44.009> so<00:01:44.880> this

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:45.000 
finished edge on both sides so this

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.810 
finished edge on both sides so this
piece<00:01:45.270> goes<00:01:45.540> right<00:01:45.899> there<00:01:46.490> and<00:01:47.490> then<00:01:47.610> I'm<00:01:47.700> just

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:47.820 
piece goes right there and then I'm just

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:49.940 
piece goes right there and then I'm just
going<00:01:47.970> to<00:01:48.030> work<00:01:48.210> my<00:01:48.420> way<00:01:48.450> down<00:01:48.619> now<00:01:49.619> it's<00:01:49.770> not

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:49.950 
going to work my way down now it's not

00:01:49.950 --> 00:01:52.399 
going to work my way down now it's not
going<00:01:50.159> to<00:01:50.250> be<00:01:50.340> necessary<00:01:51.090> to<00:01:51.689> run<00:01:51.899> this<00:01:52.020> border

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:52.409 
going to be necessary to run this border

00:01:52.409 --> 00:01:53.749 
going to be necessary to run this border
all<00:01:52.590> the<00:01:52.619> way<00:01:52.829> to<00:01:52.890> the<00:01:53.070> wall<00:01:53.280> since<00:01:53.610> the

00:01:53.749 --> 00:01:53.759 
all the way to the wall since the

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:55.130 
all the way to the wall since the
cabinet<00:01:54.149> is<00:01:54.210> going<00:01:54.240> to<00:01:54.479> cover<00:01:54.689> it<00:01:54.840> up<00:01:54.990> I'm

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:55.140 
cabinet is going to cover it up I'm

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:58.249 
cabinet is going to cover it up I'm
going<00:01:55.320> to<00:01:55.470> stop<00:01:56.460> right<00:01:56.729> here<00:01:57.090> and<00:01:57.270> I'm<00:01:58.049> leaving

going to stop right here and I'm leaving
about<00:01:58.860> an<00:01:59.189> eighth<00:01:59.700> of<00:01:59.850> an<00:02:00.000> inch<00:02:00.149> gap<00:02:00.509> in

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:00.750 
about an eighth of an inch gap in

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:02.630 
about an eighth of an inch gap in
between<00:02:00.869> so<00:02:01.469> I'll<00:02:01.590> have<00:02:01.770> space<00:02:02.070> for<00:02:02.100> a<00:02:02.369> grout

00:02:02.630 --> 00:02:02.640 
between so I'll have space for a grout

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:09.199 
between so I'll have space for a grout
line<00:02:03.500> cut<00:02:04.500> another<00:02:04.710> piece<00:02:05.070> here<00:02:07.910> just<00:02:08.910> put<00:02:09.090> the

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:09.209 
line cut another piece here just put the

00:02:09.209 --> 00:02:11.119 
line cut another piece here just put the
border<00:02:09.569> in<00:02:09.720> each<00:02:09.989> small<00:02:10.410> space<00:02:10.739> that<00:02:10.979> you're

00:02:11.119 --> 00:02:11.129 
border in each small space that you're

00:02:11.129 --> 00:02:13.630 
border in each small space that you're
working<00:02:11.310> on

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:13.640 

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.950 

now<00:02:14.640> the<00:02:14.700> reason<00:02:15.150> that<00:02:15.240> you<00:02:15.360> want<00:02:15.510> to<00:02:15.600> work<00:02:15.750> in

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:15.960 
now the reason that you want to work in

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.110 
now the reason that you want to work in
a<00:02:16.050> small<00:02:16.230> area<00:02:16.740> is<00:02:17.069> because<00:02:17.490> remember<00:02:17.640> you're

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:18.120 
a small area is because remember you're

00:02:18.120 --> 00:02:20.780 
a small area is because remember you're
adding<00:02:18.510> mastic<00:02:18.930> for<00:02:19.140> your<00:02:19.260> tiles<00:02:19.740> and<00:02:20.130> if<00:02:20.640> you

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:20.790 
adding mastic for your tiles and if you

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:22.490 
adding mastic for your tiles and if you
spread<00:02:21.060> the<00:02:21.240> mastic<00:02:21.630> over<00:02:21.900> a<00:02:21.930> larger<00:02:22.319> area

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:22.500 
spread the mastic over a larger area

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.380 
spread the mastic over a larger area
especially<00:02:23.069> since<00:02:23.730> you're<00:02:23.850> using<00:02:24.060> smaller

00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:24.390 
especially since you're using smaller

00:02:24.390 --> 00:02:26.900 
especially since you're using smaller
pieces<00:02:24.870> of<00:02:25.080> tile<00:02:25.440> domestic<00:02:26.340> would<00:02:26.490> dry<00:02:26.730> out

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:26.910 
pieces of tile domestic would dry out

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:28.250 
pieces of tile domestic would dry out
before<00:02:27.090> you'd<00:02:27.390> have<00:02:27.540> time<00:02:27.720> to<00:02:27.840> get<00:02:27.930> all<00:02:27.990> of<00:02:28.170> the

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:28.260 
before you'd have time to get all of the

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:33.050 
before you'd have time to get all of the
tile<00:02:28.530> installed<00:02:31.250> all<00:02:32.250> right<00:02:32.400> now<00:02:32.550> I<00:02:32.610> have<00:02:32.730> all

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:33.060 
tile installed all right now I have all

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:34.790 
tile installed all right now I have all
of<00:02:33.090> the<00:02:33.270> title<00:02:33.630> broken<00:02:33.959> up<00:02:34.080> and<00:02:34.230> separated<00:02:34.709> by

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:34.800 
of the title broken up and separated by

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:35.360 
of the title broken up and separated by
color

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:35.370 
color

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:37.010 
color
now<00:02:35.550> comes<00:02:35.820> the<00:02:35.880> fun<00:02:36.120> part<00:02:36.330> putting<00:02:36.690> these<00:02:36.840> on

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:37.020 
now comes the fun part putting these on

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.080 
now comes the fun part putting these on
and<00:02:37.740> because<00:02:38.130> these<00:02:38.310> aren't<00:02:38.550> all<00:02:38.760> the<00:02:39.060> same

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.090 
and because these aren't all the same

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:41.810 
and because these aren't all the same
shape<00:02:39.810> this<00:02:40.709> is<00:02:40.890> where<00:02:41.070> you<00:02:41.160> can<00:02:41.340> create<00:02:41.489> any

00:02:41.810 --> 00:02:41.820 
shape this is where you can create any

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:43.400 
shape this is where you can create any
kind<00:02:41.910> of<00:02:42.150> look<00:02:42.450> or<00:02:42.720> pattern<00:02:43.140> that<00:02:43.290> you're

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:43.410 
kind of look or pattern that you're

00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:46.540 
kind of look or pattern that you're
after<00:02:43.620> so<00:02:44.580> I'm<00:02:44.670> just<00:02:44.910> using<00:02:45.120> my<00:02:45.330> three<00:02:45.750> colors

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:46.550 
after so I'm just using my three colors

00:02:46.550 --> 00:02:53.080 
after so I'm just using my three colors
do<00:02:47.550> kind<00:02:47.820> of<00:02:47.850> a<00:02:47.970> squiggly<00:02:48.390> effect<00:02:48.900> I<00:02:49.020> think

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:55.430 

when<00:02:54.090> you're<00:02:54.209> putting<00:02:54.390> your<00:02:54.510> tiles<00:02:54.959> up<00:02:55.140> here's

00:02:55.430 --> 00:02:55.440 
when you're putting your tiles up here's

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:56.509 
when you're putting your tiles up here's
something<00:02:55.769> I<00:02:55.860> need<00:02:56.070> to<00:02:56.100> warn<00:02:56.370> you<00:02:56.459> about

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:58.530 
because these are broken pieces you

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.470 
because these are broken pieces you
might<00:02:58.769> have<00:02:59.010> some<00:02:59.190> sharp<00:02:59.489> edges<00:02:59.700> or<00:03:00.060> jagged

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:00.480 
might have some sharp edges or jagged

00:03:00.480 --> 00:03:02.360 
might have some sharp edges or jagged
edges<00:03:00.660> all<00:03:01.320> you<00:03:01.470> need<00:03:01.620> to<00:03:01.709> do<00:03:01.830> to<00:03:01.950> solve<00:03:02.190> that

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:02.370 
edges all you need to do to solve that

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:05.960 
edges all you need to do to solve that
problem<00:03:02.430> is<00:03:02.850> take<00:03:03.030> a<00:03:03.060> piece<00:03:03.330> of<00:03:03.480> sandpaper<00:03:04.970> and

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:05.970 
problem is take a piece of sandpaper and

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:08.150 
problem is take a piece of sandpaper and
just<00:03:06.030> smooth<00:03:06.510> that<00:03:06.540> down<00:03:07.050> there<00:03:07.650> that<00:03:07.830> feels<00:03:08.070> a

just smooth that down there that feels a
lot<00:03:08.310> better<00:03:08.580> that<00:03:09.360> way<00:03:09.480> once<00:03:09.750> you<00:03:09.900> get<00:03:10.050> this

00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:10.170 
lot better that way once you get this
