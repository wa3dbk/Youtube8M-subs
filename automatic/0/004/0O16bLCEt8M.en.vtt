00:00:06.859 --> 00:00:12.240
 hello today I want to show you the set 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:12.809
 kitchen knives steak from the company 

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:14.549
 etc. 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.310
 we start of course creates 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:18.680
 gift box packaging yes and in 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.660
 In principle, this set is 

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:22.230
 gift and in my opinion as 

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.710
 gift 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:29.250
 he is very very good but the company 

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:31.980
 derbin released a box of walnut 

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:36.989
 trees with landing nests 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:38.670
 under every knife also every knife goes in 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:39.300
 separate here such here cellophane 

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.090
 small bag 

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:43.170
 I have taken off all the knives now 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.980
 but one to 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:50.280
 show you this nuance to 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:54.840
 also here the derbent company gives its 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:58.739
 recommendation not to wash in a typewriter that is 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:03.890
 manually wash these knives here but 

00:00:58.739 --> 00:01:07.080
 actually referring to the knives themselves means 

00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:09.630
 Adelburn company produces knives for 

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:12.570
 steaks 5 options given 

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:15.119
 set includes four knives and all of them 

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:17.280
 made in different just the same 

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:19.350
 options that is the handle of knives 

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:22.080
 depending on the version may 

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:24.240
 made from my black card 

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:27.540
 rosewood wood 

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:30.090
 and also from the horn of a buffalo 

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:32.850
 8 cards are issued or that is 

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:34.409
 canvas mykarta as you can see in 

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.600
 This is the mix version 

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:41.030
 just four are presented 

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:42.710
 options materials stick certainly 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:46.380
 such an approach 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:47.130
 suitable for people who take knives 

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.200
 for the soul 

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:51.869
 that is, you can take the mood 

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:54.600
 different handle material 

00:01:51.869 --> 00:01:57.390
 although by themselves knives of course she 

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.740
 logically but logical but not in terms of 

00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:03.960
 the fact that they are all equipped with blades 

00:01:59.740 --> 00:02:05.380
 martin stainless steel them 

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:08.770
 4613 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:12.069
 hardness 54 56 units threshold full of a 

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:13.900
 booking all these knives 2 and 1 

00:02:12.069 --> 00:02:18.090
 millimeter I managed to measure about 

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:21.489
 A note of only 0 1 millimeter 

00:02:18.090 --> 00:02:24.790
 Of course, with such a reduction and thickness 

00:02:21.489 --> 00:02:27.519
 on the butt and high descents knives 

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:29.470
 cut the tip of the knife very well 

00:02:27.519 --> 00:02:32.380
 slightly elevated relatively common 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:35.049
 knife lines and also narrow enough it 

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:37.750
 specificity of steak knives 

00:02:35.049 --> 00:02:40.390
 necessary to fit 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:44.140
 to slip between any bones 

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:45.700
 there is or but more delicate cut when 

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:48.730
 separating meat from bone 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:50.650
 so you can do well worth it 

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:53.190
 note that these knives are suitable for both 

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:56.260
 cutting raw meat also for 

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:57.940
 butchering the finished meat but first 

00:02:56.260 --> 00:02:59.799
 all probably ready for 

00:02:57.940 --> 00:03:03.400
 some kind of festive table for special 

00:02:59.799 --> 00:03:07.600
 the event concentrated all these knives 

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:10.780
 under the scheme full tank i.e. shank 

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:14.100
 blade continues along its entire length 

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:17.019
 handle that provides additional 

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:18.579
 reliability of the design of this knife 

00:03:17.019 --> 00:03:20.680
 worth noting that they have 

00:03:18.579 --> 00:03:24.100
 subfinger stop under the index finger 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:26.859
 in order not to come off and some 

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:30.069
 with some kind of force on the cutting edge 

00:03:26.859 --> 00:03:32.350
 the cutting edge is slightly smaller than the length 

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:37.030
 the blade here there is a little bit not 

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:39.489
 sharpened part regarding fastening 

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:44.410
 mounting here's the handle im something you can 

00:03:39.489 --> 00:03:45.160
 see that it is made of five such 

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:48.639
 bolts 

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:50.260
 they are designed 

00:03:48.639 --> 00:03:54.069
 that is, not 

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:56.980
 and somehow there is absolutely primitive yes 

00:03:54.069 --> 00:04:00.000
 performed on indium not interesting with different 

00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:03.000
 planting diameter but in general 

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:06.370
 it is clear that the design of the knife is very 

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.560
 seriously worked especially worth it 

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:12.190
 note that the knives 

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:15.819
 different polishing and if some 

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:16.690
 knives are made in such a matt 

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:20.739
 option 

00:04:16.690 --> 00:04:23.260
 then some polished in brilliance given 

00:04:20.739 --> 00:04:27.720
 case, I'm going to show you the difference in 

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:31.120
 blades and handles of these knives 

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:34.750
 that is, of course, the mood is very 

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:37.240
 interesting you can pick up his knives for 

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:39.220
 steak fits comfortably in the hilt 

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:41.680
 the knife is long enough it allows 

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:42.789
 use multiple arms independently 

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:47.760
 from length 

00:04:42.789 --> 00:04:51.070
 palm person who uses it 

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:54.280
 handy them in such a gift box 

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:57.039
 also store finishing 

00:04:54.280 --> 00:05:02.470
 blades are great and some kind of claim 

00:04:57.039 --> 00:05:05.320
 I do not have them if you compare the knife on 

00:05:02.470 --> 00:05:09.220
 example with a similar blade length 

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:14.789
 also ra pro we can see what is 

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:18.580
 the difference in the length of the handle steak knife 

00:05:14.789 --> 00:05:21.669
 quite long over 25 centimeters and 

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:25.599
 I see the length of the blade, that is, somewhere around 250 2 

00:05:21.669 --> 00:05:28.289
 millimeter around 13 centimeters length 

00:05:25.599 --> 00:05:30.520
 cutting edge blade length 

00:05:28.289 --> 00:05:32.490
 slightly shorter respectively length 

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:42.169
 cutting edge 

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:46.610
 regarding the weight of these knives then by weight 

00:05:42.169 --> 00:05:50.779
 it is 98 grams but depending on the version 

00:05:46.610 --> 00:06:01.849
 performance their weight is slightly different 

00:05:50.779 --> 00:06:03.830
 that is, 86 grams 90 grams and 91 grams 

00:06:01.849 --> 00:06:07.249
 in general, I understand that 

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:09.499
 the difference is in the material of the handle 

00:06:07.249 --> 00:06:13.029
 which affects in this case 

00:06:09.499 --> 00:06:16.389
 canopy because the general characteristics by 

00:06:13.029 --> 00:06:19.189
 blades they are similar 

00:06:16.389 --> 00:06:21.110
 Many thanks to the company to knit hands for 

00:06:19.189 --> 00:06:26.199
 providing knife data for review 

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:26.199
 thanks to my viewers for watching bye
