00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.549
 I must say that I am not happy with the result 

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:13.759
 more degree 

00:00:05.549 --> 00:00:16.230
 The game suited me 2 forced replacements 

00:00:13.759 --> 00:00:17.300
 pleasant player base who are not here 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:22.230
 arrived 

00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:24.150
 for this game too much but also 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:28.590
 important factor there is a good game 

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:31.679
 opponent for your team i'm watching me 

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:35.399
 I think this is one of the best teams 

00:00:31.679 --> 00:00:38.940
 game quality and therefore draw 

00:00:35.399 --> 00:00:44.010
 such a game, well, let's say not directly with not 

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:46.430
 poor result thanks please 

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:46.430
 question 

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:56.780
 yes absolutely forced replacements yet 

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:59.440
 question thank you please let 

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:59.440
 actively loves 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:11.620
 we do not have the most Mikhalev 2 innings 

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.950
 which came out a replacement in order to 

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:17.050
 strengthen the game but the output mikhaleva in the 

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:19.530
 situations you still had a forced replacement 

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:23.440
 maybe he is not quite ready yet to play 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:27.370
 so much time has not yet entered into our 

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:33.340
 game so i will say yes please dominated 

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:37.420
 is on the 20th the number of kozin 

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:40.000
 then than in the second half I would not 

00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:42.160
 said here know how the question is emotion 

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.190
 when the missed goal comes to the acuna 

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:47.140
 when you need something to rebuild 

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:47.710
 I will not say that we are 20 minutes past 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:51.310
 lost 

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:53.770
 No, but emotions were beyond that and even 

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:56.530
 the goalkeeper radio ball lost it three times 

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:58.360
 it is wrong I want to me 

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:01.680
 there was a more experienced team so far she 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:01.680
 this leg is nervous 

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:08.899
 dozens of 11 on the basis of matches it is there 

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:12.170
 leaves happy or 

00:02:08.899 --> 00:02:13.670
 weave away from that one 

00:02:12.170 --> 00:02:16.000
 unequivocally unhappy 

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:19.520
 we must dominate and must play 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.770
 but I got what I found out 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:26.950
 the results of the remaining matches as if they 

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:26.950
 we are satisfied we have not lost our positions
