00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:17.310
 So he explores the start and gives today 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.480
 there is a new part of the series as because 

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:21.900
 I better in black ops 2 

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:23.760
 I know sometimes march expect that 

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.380
 now the new series with analytics 

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:27.510
 but this is currently in the 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.070
 holiday and thus right now also one 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.070
 video just thinks I do 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:32.279
 it's still a video and you get better 

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:35.190
 exactly 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:38.160
 So catch tolerate at times you see 

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:39.989
 here grad gameplay is on meltdown the 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:46.770
 Great as I will use if I am 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:49.879
 do not see who the bmw 7 switch 4321 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:52.620
 so you look great is like always 

00:00:49.879 --> 00:00:55.289
 completely normal I have now Baumann 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.940
 standard runway at the beginning said that 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:58.500
 Because of the weapon have extreme conditions 

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:01.800
 we at the 47 

00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:02.760
 say sweet blanket as usual 

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:04.229
 just always do it 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.760
 this is not left or right 

00:01:04.229 --> 00:01:08.430
 looked but direct stop she means 

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:11.820
 4 broken in but not good anyway 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:14.960
 I was not 

00:01:11.820 --> 00:01:18.299
 You see how I do now 

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:20.070
 All the tips is in the right game 

00:01:18.299 --> 00:01:22.700
 not a perfect gameplay now 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:25.350
 but see it later 

00:01:22.700 --> 00:01:27.560
 you'll have to look at it then 

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.939
 now probably already see here 

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:33.720
 I'm dying now, I do not know why 

00:01:29.939 --> 00:01:36.150
 the lawyer has his own paunsdorf absolutely 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:39.770
 important to be dead but well 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:42.509
 you can not do nothing nothing 

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:44.280
 Generally easy to say here is that 

00:01:42.509 --> 00:01:48.960
 of course in the gameplay the lobby as 

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:50.040
 but extremely bad was I think think 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.040
 stop these walks as well 

00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.659
 otherwise open and then 

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:56.040
 can you see how I am 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:57.540
 Move around because here is here 

00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:00.000
 the team chef would find here yes 

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.560
 no herter flags and you have to stop 

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.570
 Nice estimate can already estimate 

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:06.409
 like the sports are already 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:06.409
 extreme important 

00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:13.910
 have now made an error one 

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:18.170
 shot but luckily yes it is 

00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:19.970
 songs and knocks on the weapon around it 

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:22.130
 no idea why he did it 

00:02:19.970 --> 00:02:24.980
 I have a drone right up there and that 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:27.710
 sailors long run hotels is now the 

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:28.730
 total falls in principle as you can see 

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:30.170
 first what i have done i have 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:32.390
 seen the tip goes outside wants 

00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:34.130
 he wants to run abdallah 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:35.480
 I just want to disappoint then the 

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:37.580
 normal way to buy so I have like that 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.890
 this made the fall around the corner that 

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:42.280
 he just around the outside killing me whole 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:44.420
 demonstrate 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:49.520
 Here you see good and my team 

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:50.060
 nachgerückt and kreuzau these cards that 

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:54.110
 1 

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:57.560
 my team has moved on and on 

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:59.510
 other side opponents like me and stop 

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:03.650
 explained to the people standing up 

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:07.550
 it's always up there from new patch 4.1 

00:03:03.650 --> 00:03:09.200
 Do everything yourself because you see 

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:11.630
 they also blackbird I have now 

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.700
 not activated simply for the reason 

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:16.390
 because he is just control activated and 

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:23.090
 Therefore, he can be his way practitioner 

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:24.530
 finally quite logically yes not here 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:28.310
 so save a bit are the people 

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:30.799
 of it also always keeps around so yourself 

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:35.299
 the amount still seen therefore already before 

00:03:30.799 --> 00:03:37.820
 Part time I make sure that he 

00:03:35.299 --> 00:03:38.480
 front adversary and from the stop directly 

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:40.700
 killed 

00:03:38.480 --> 00:03:43.010
 he had no chance we want now 

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:45.110
 a city nobody knows 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:48.560
 more so I see that his comes up 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:50.110
 shoot very dignified and now wanted 

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:52.519
 am in front of the type-I somehow so 

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:54.049
 shot but he looks like that 

00:03:52.519 --> 00:03:56.500
 really bad student wanted 

00:03:54.049 --> 00:04:01.910
 expect and I had no cent 

00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:05.780
 Nevertheless , it passes us by and loads you 

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:07.910
 since my skin glued and do that 

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:10.010
 which is so accurate on all g8 and orbital 

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:11.920
 hate you have to stop me so always 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:16.750
 all bottles of wine 

00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:19.269
 you 've got 2 against 1 2 against you 

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:22.900
 fighters they are already disadvantageous that 

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:25.240
 if a 1941 is up too so must 

00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:30.190
 Be careful that you always have one 

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:31.930
 bit just so on are exactly fits 

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:34.120
 wanted to recycle now went 

00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:36.790
 not you have the two opponents of 

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:41.860
 We did not want to chance them now 

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:43.210
 Here's an animated look I see 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:46.000
 now hold the orbital became the people 

00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:47.680
 there are always mistakes I made 

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.229
 just run down here and 

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:53.470
 can tell the people for which he 

00:04:50.229 --> 00:04:55.870
 but after yannick but super secure 

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:58.150
 actually made an error because I 

00:04:55.870 --> 00:04:59.590
 here, for example, the people here 

00:04:58.150 --> 00:05:00.040
 but I can not clarify 

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:04.090
 made 

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:06.910
 Now I have a little ammo it was 

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:08.110
 bad are the stupid mistakes but you 

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:08.800
 also has good gameplay where to show 

00:05:08.110 --> 00:05:10.960
 makes mistakes 

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:13.300
 you see hardly any shows yet 

00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:15.040
 and according to these opponents, sport shooting 

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:17.770
 the ba forum and people see mine 

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:19.840
 red dot I have no more ritual her 

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:24.100
 passes so somehow lay the front 

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:26.950
 yours and the right he kills 

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:29.440
 not that was maybe michaels for 

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:30.600
 nuclear so what no plan is today what 

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:33.010
 accompanied 

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:33.700
 it assured my thing to Delbrück 

00:05:33.010 --> 00:05:35.680
 tear 

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:41.190
 I think I'll have it again soon 

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:41.190
 Although I already know what diligent current yes 

00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:46.090
 really hott but may well I hope 

00:05:44.410 --> 00:05:47.680
 I could show you here somewhere like 

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:50.440
 in the game 

00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:54.520
 I was always in motion I have these 

00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:56.169
 somehow in nou camp and japan theirs 

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:58.750
 is considered as in my consideration 

00:05:56.169 --> 00:06:03.550
 death reported and died but 

00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:05.260
 Well, I hope you liked it 

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:09.220
 thumbs up if you liked it 

00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:11.260
