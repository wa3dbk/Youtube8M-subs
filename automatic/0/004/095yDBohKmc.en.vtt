now<00:01:09.330> I<00:01:09.360> do<00:01:09.510> tend<00:01:09.900> to<00:01:09.990> assume<00:01:10.290> that<00:01:10.500> most<00:01:10.560> of<00:01:10.740> my

00:01:10.789 --> 00:01:10.799 
now I do tend to assume that most of my

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.200 
now I do tend to assume that most of my
viewers<00:01:11.040> are<00:01:11.070> at<00:01:11.250> least<00:01:11.520> as<00:01:11.729> much<00:01:11.850> of<00:01:12.000> a<00:01:12.090> nerd

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
viewers are at least as much of a nerd

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:14.210 
viewers are at least as much of a nerd
as<00:01:12.420> I<00:01:12.540> am<00:01:12.720> and<00:01:12.990> I<00:01:13.320> use<00:01:13.470> that<00:01:13.500> word<00:01:13.710> in<00:01:14.040> like

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:14.220 
as I am and I use that word in like

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.219 
as I am and I use that word in like
every<00:01:14.850> video<00:01:15.030> so<00:01:15.270> I<00:01:15.540> guess<00:01:15.750> it's<00:01:15.900> kind<00:01:16.140> of

00:01:16.219 --> 00:01:16.229 
every video so I guess it's kind of

00:01:16.229 --> 00:01:17.510 
every video so I guess it's kind of
important<00:01:16.590> that<00:01:16.680> you<00:01:16.740> know<00:01:16.830> what<00:01:16.920> it<00:01:17.009> means<00:01:17.189> so

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
important that you know what it means so

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:18.890 
important that you know what it means so
I'm<00:01:17.790> just<00:01:18.000> gonna<00:01:18.119> lay<00:01:18.210> down<00:01:18.240> the<00:01:18.420> basics<00:01:18.810> or

that's<00:01:42.030> kibble<00:01:42.479> for<00:01:43.729> example<00:01:44.729> Mixmaster<00:01:45.720> is

00:01:45.889 --> 00:01:45.899 
that's kibble for example Mixmaster is

freaking<00:01:46.470> south-central<00:01:47.280> kibble<00:01:47.970> I<00:01:48.149> mean<00:01:48.570> the

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:48.630 
freaking south-central kibble I mean the

00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:50.389 
freaking south-central kibble I mean the
pipes<00:01:48.899> in<00:01:49.140> the<00:01:49.229> wheels<00:01:49.439> they're<00:01:49.799> not<00:01:50.009> kibble

00:01:50.389 --> 00:01:50.399 
pipes in the wheels they're not kibble

00:01:50.399 --> 00:01:52.010 
pipes in the wheels they're not kibble
because<00:01:50.670> they<00:01:51.060> work<00:01:51.299> with<00:01:51.329> the<00:01:51.540> design<00:01:51.840> they

00:01:52.010 --> 00:01:52.020 
because they work with the design they

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:53.780 
because they work with the design they
give<00:01:52.170> him<00:01:52.229> his<00:01:52.380> look<00:01:52.619> the<00:01:53.189> bits<00:01:53.369> of<00:01:53.460> the<00:01:53.549> drum

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
give him his look the bits of the drum

00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:55.670 
give him his look the bits of the drum
hanging<00:01:54.030> off<00:01:54.119> his<00:01:54.240> arm<00:01:54.420> those<00:01:54.750> I<00:01:54.990> wouldn't<00:01:55.290> say

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:55.680 
hanging off his arm those I wouldn't say

00:01:55.680 --> 00:01:57.969 
hanging off his arm those I wouldn't say
they<00:01:55.920> were<00:01:55.950> kibble<00:01:56.430> but<00:01:56.939> these<00:01:57.119> bits

00:01:57.969 --> 00:01:57.979 
they were kibble but these bits

00:01:57.979 --> 00:02:00.590 
they were kibble but these bits
definitely<00:01:58.979> kibble<00:01:59.369> they're<00:01:59.939> just<00:02:00.149> there

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:00.600 
definitely kibble they're just there

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.060 
definitely kibble they're just there
they<00:02:00.990> don't<00:02:01.110> look<00:02:01.439> any<00:02:01.619> good<00:02:01.710> and<00:02:01.950> they<00:02:02.009> don't

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:02.070 
they don't look any good and they don't

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.980

budget<00:02:08.099> constraints<00:02:08.670> or<00:02:08.789> just<00:02:09.300> laziness<00:02:09.810> but

00:02:10.279 --> 00:02:10.289 
budget constraints or just laziness but

00:02:10.289 --> 00:02:11.330 
budget constraints or just laziness but
the<00:02:10.379> designers<00:02:10.739> couldn't<00:02:10.979> think<00:02:11.039> of<00:02:11.190> anything

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:11.340 
the designers couldn't think of anything

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:12.650 
the designers couldn't think of anything
cool<00:02:11.610> to<00:02:11.730> do<00:02:11.849> with<00:02:11.970> it<00:02:12.060> so<00:02:12.150> they<00:02:12.270> just<00:02:12.420> slapped

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:12.660 
cool to do with it so they just slapped

00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:13.640 
cool to do with it so they just slapped
it<00:02:12.750> on<00:02:12.810> his<00:02:12.930> butt

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:13.650 
it on his butt

obviously<00:02:14.650> different<00:02:15.400> people<00:02:15.640> have

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:15.790 
obviously different people have

00:02:15.790 --> 00:02:17.010 
obviously different people have
different<00:02:15.819> standards<00:02:16.300> as<00:02:16.599> to<00:02:16.630> what<00:02:16.870> they

00:02:17.010 --> 00:02:17.020 
different standards as to what they

00:02:17.020 --> 00:02:18.839 
different standards as to what they
consider<00:02:17.410> to<00:02:17.500> be<00:02:17.620> kibble<00:02:18.069> I<00:02:18.250> mean<00:02:18.580> if<00:02:18.670> we<00:02:18.760> have

00:02:18.839 --> 00:02:18.849 
consider to be kibble I mean if we have

00:02:18.849 --> 00:02:20.430 
consider to be kibble I mean if we have
a<00:02:18.880> look<00:02:19.030> at<00:02:19.090> bulkhead<00:02:19.540> these<00:02:19.840> bits<00:02:20.050> up<00:02:20.200> here

00:02:20.430 --> 00:02:20.440 
a look at bulkhead these bits up here

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.890 
a look at bulkhead these bits up here
these<00:02:20.680> are<00:02:20.830> kind<00:02:20.980> of<00:02:21.069> borderline<00:02:21.580> I<00:02:22.000> wouldn't

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:22.900 
these are kind of borderline I wouldn't

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.290 
these are kind of borderline I wouldn't
say<00:02:23.080> their<00:02:23.290> kibble<00:02:23.530> because<00:02:23.890> I<00:02:23.980> like<00:02:24.250> them<00:02:24.550> but

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:25.300 
say their kibble because I like them but

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:27.150 
say their kibble because I like them but
some<00:02:25.569> folks<00:02:25.810> would<00:02:26.230> say<00:02:26.260> that<00:02:26.650> cable<00:02:26.890> because

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:27.160 
some folks would say that cable because

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:29.010 
some folks would say that cable because
they<00:02:27.280> don't<00:02:27.459> really<00:02:27.550> go<00:02:27.880> anywhere<00:02:28.180> but<00:02:28.780> these

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:29.020 
they don't really go anywhere but these

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:30.290 
they don't really go anywhere but these
ones<00:02:29.200> here
