better<00:01:09.630> made<00:01:09.869> it's<00:01:10.770> all<00:01:11.340> plastic<00:01:11.909> except<00:01:12.240> for

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360 
better made it's all plastic except for

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:13.789 
better made it's all plastic except for
this<00:01:12.479> basically<00:01:12.900> nuts<00:01:13.260> and<00:01:13.409> bolts<00:01:13.650> or

00:01:13.789 --> 00:01:13.799 
this basically nuts and bolts or

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:16.130 
this basically nuts and bolts or
anything<00:01:13.979> is<00:01:14.189> metal<00:01:14.540> which<00:01:15.540> was<00:01:15.840> the<00:01:15.930> same

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140 
anything is metal which was the same

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:22.039 
anything is metal which was the same
thing<00:01:16.320> the<00:01:16.470> last<00:01:16.590> one<00:01:17.090> little<00:01:18.090> tanks<00:01:19.310> I<00:01:21.049> didn't

00:01:22.039 --> 00:01:22.049 
thing the last one little tanks I didn't

00:01:22.049 --> 00:01:23.210 
thing the last one little tanks I didn't
really<00:01:22.229> expect<00:01:22.500> anything<00:01:22.770> different<00:01:22.890> that

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
really expect anything different that

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.330 
really expect anything different that
way<00:01:23.549> the<00:01:24.000> last<00:01:24.180> ones<00:01:24.479> that<00:01:24.570> way<00:01:24.860> but<00:01:25.860> for<00:01:26.009> 60

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:26.340 
way the last ones that way but for 60

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:27.350 
way the last ones that way but for 60
bucks<00:01:26.460> I<00:01:26.670> just<00:01:26.820> think<00:01:27.000> they<00:01:27.090> could<00:01:27.270> have

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360 
bucks I just think they could have

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.899 
bucks I just think they could have
really<00:01:27.600> done<00:01:27.750> a<00:01:27.780> better<00:01:27.930> job<00:01:28.080> and<00:01:28.790> put<00:01:29.790> out<00:01:29.880> a

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:29.909 
really done a better job and put out a

00:01:29.909 --> 00:01:34.670 
really done a better job and put out a
better<00:01:30.540> product<00:01:32.180> cars<00:01:33.180> okay<00:01:33.750> I<00:01:33.780> guess<00:01:34.229> and<00:01:34.590> I

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:34.680 
better product cars okay I guess and I

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:37.249 
better product cars okay I guess and I
know<00:01:35.119> everything<00:01:36.119> look<00:01:36.329> how<00:01:36.450> little<00:01:36.689> it<00:01:36.900> is<00:01:36.930> I

00:01:37.249 --> 00:01:37.259 
know everything look how little it is I

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:39.649 
know everything look how little it is I
really<00:01:37.560> expected<00:01:38.549> something<00:01:38.939> bigger<00:01:39.360> than

00:01:39.649 --> 00:01:39.659 
really expected something bigger than

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:45.020 
really expected something bigger than
that<00:01:42.619> you<00:01:43.619> know<00:01:43.740> at<00:01:43.829> least<00:01:44.040> leave<00:01:44.280> about<00:01:44.759> five

00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.030 
that you know at least leave about five

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.060 
that you know at least leave about five
more<00:01:45.210> inches<00:01:45.360> bigger<00:01:45.750> that<00:01:46.619> didn't<00:01:46.950> sound

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
more inches bigger that didn't sound

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.370 
more inches bigger that didn't sound
good<00:01:47.310> but<00:01:47.520> anyway<00:01:47.850> you<00:01:48.479> know<00:01:48.570> from<00:01:49.020> side<00:01:49.350> to

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:49.380 
good but anyway you know from side to

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:54.200 
good but anyway you know from side to
side<00:01:50.360> it's<00:01:51.360> just<00:01:51.840> not<00:01:52.200> what<00:01:52.470> I<00:01:52.500> expected<00:01:53.210> the

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
side it's just not what I expected the

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.700 
side it's just not what I expected the
pieces<00:01:54.689> are<00:01:55.020> not<00:01:55.290> that<00:01:55.560> great<00:01:57.079> 72<00:01:58.079> onions<00:01:58.560> by

00:01:58.700 --> 00:01:58.710 
pieces are not that great 72 onions by

00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:01.130 
pieces are not that great 72 onions by
the<00:01:58.770> way<00:01:58.950> I<00:01:58.979> did<00:01:59.310> not<00:01:59.340> get<00:01:59.610> America's<00:02:00.060> look<00:02:00.960> I'm

00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:01.140 
the way I did not get America's look I'm

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:09.219 
the way I did not get America's look I'm
manly<00:02:01.409> she<00:02:01.770> looks<00:02:02.009> um<00:02:03.979> just<00:02:04.979> kind<00:02:05.159> of<00:02:06.110> butch

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:11.320 

I<00:02:09.259> know<00:02:09.679> they're<00:02:10.070> just<00:02:10.100> a<00:02:10.340> little<00:02:10.399> tiny<00:02:10.759> pieces

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:11.330 
I know they're just a little tiny pieces

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:13.090 
I know they're just a little tiny pieces
of<00:02:11.450> plastic<00:02:11.960> I<00:02:12.350> think<00:02:12.410> they<00:02:12.710> could<00:02:12.890> have<00:02:12.980> done

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:13.100 
of plastic I think they could have done

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.660 
of plastic I think they could have done
a<00:02:13.130> better<00:02:13.220> job<00:02:13.460> of<00:02:13.730> designing<00:02:14.320> the<00:02:15.320> pieces<00:02:15.830> it

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:16.670 
a better job of designing the pieces it

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:18.300 
a better job of designing the pieces it
wasn't<00:02:16.970> hard<00:02:17.090> to<00:02:17.210> put<00:02:17.390> together<00:02:17.480> really<00:02:18.170> a

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:18.310 
wasn't hard to put together really a

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.880 
wasn't hard to put together really a
little<00:02:19.310> irritating<00:02:19.970> now<00:02:20.120> and<00:02:20.300> then<00:02:20.420> but

00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:20.890 
little irritating now and then but

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:24.490 
little irritating now and then but
nothing<00:02:21.890> bad<00:02:22.070> and<00:02:22.640> I<00:02:23.150> didn't<00:02:23.960> rage<00:02:24.140> or

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500 
nothing bad and I didn't rage or

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:25.380 
nothing bad and I didn't rage or
anything

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:25.390 
anything

00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:29.800 
anything
the<00:02:26.390> guns<00:02:26.720> are<00:02:27.050> you<00:02:27.830> know<00:02:27.950> kind<00:02:28.280> of<00:02:28.810> chintzy

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:29.810 
the guns are you know kind of chintzy

00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:32.290 
the guns are you know kind of chintzy
but<00:02:30.200> the<00:02:30.290> last<00:02:30.410> ones<00:02:30.650> were<00:02:30.770> too<00:02:31.010> I<00:02:31.370> guess<00:02:31.910> I<00:02:32.150> was

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:32.300 
but the last ones were too I guess I was
