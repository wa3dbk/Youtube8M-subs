think it was reflected properly on

00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:14.630 
think it was reflected properly on
television<00:03:12.870> how<00:03:13.320> big<00:03:13.620> a<00:03:13.650> shot<00:03:13.950> that<00:03:14.160> was<00:03:14.370> and

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:14.640 
television how big a shot that was and

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.120 
television how big a shot that was and
how<00:03:15.150> that<00:03:15.360> affected<00:03:15.810> you<00:03:15.989> it<00:03:16.320> was<00:03:16.470> a<00:03:16.500> hard<00:03:16.770> shot

how that affected you it was a hard shot
and<00:03:17.430> was<00:03:17.670> in<00:03:17.790> a<00:03:17.850> very<00:03:18.060> vulnerable<00:03:18.300> area

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:19.110 
and was in a very vulnerable area

00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:21.050 
and was in a very vulnerable area
there's<00:03:19.560> a<00:03:19.709> reason<00:03:20.130> why<00:03:20.250> there's<00:03:20.520> no<00:03:20.730> such

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:21.060 
there's a reason why there's no such

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:23.120 
there's a reason why there's no such
thing<00:03:21.090> allowed<00:03:21.600> is<00:03:21.810> rapid<00:03:22.170> punching<00:03:22.590> well<00:03:22.980> you

helper<00:03:25.770> shot<00:03:26.010> there<00:03:26.280> and<00:03:26.510> for<00:03:27.510> a<00:03:27.540> moment<00:03:27.780> there

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:28.110 
helper shot there and for a moment there

00:03:28.110 --> 00:03:30.590 
helper shot there and for a moment there
it<00:03:28.560> looked<00:03:28.980> like<00:03:29.160> we<00:03:29.640> always<00:03:29.790> say<00:03:29.910> in<00:03:30.150> boxing

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:30.600 
it looked like we always say in boxing

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.199 
it looked like we always say in boxing
same<00:03:30.840> as<00:03:30.989> a<00:03:31.110> hero<00:03:31.709> and<00:03:31.920> coward<00:03:31.950> in<00:03:32.370> the<00:03:32.459> war<00:03:32.640> the

00:03:33.199 --> 00:03:33.209 
same as a hero and coward in the war the

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:35.090 
same as a hero and coward in the war the
difference<00:03:33.660> is<00:03:33.840> in<00:03:33.989> what<00:03:34.170> they<00:03:34.320> do<00:03:34.380> now<00:03:34.890> what

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:35.100 
difference is in what they do now what

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:37.820 
difference is in what they do now what
they<00:03:35.220> feel<00:03:35.519> the<00:03:36.269> hill<00:03:36.480> feels<00:03:36.900> not<00:03:37.380> sure<00:03:37.769> of

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:37.830 
they feel the hill feels not sure of

00:03:37.830 --> 00:03:40.040 
they feel the hill feels not sure of
himself<00:03:38.040> but<00:03:38.730> he<00:03:38.850> makes<00:03:39.030> a<00:03:39.150> decision<00:03:39.300> to<00:03:39.750> do<00:03:39.900> it

00:03:40.040 --> 00:03:40.050 
himself but he makes a decision to do it

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:42.380 
himself but he makes a decision to do it
that's<00:03:40.830> what<00:03:41.070> counts<00:03:41.280> it<00:03:41.820> looked<00:03:42.120> for<00:03:42.360> a

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:42.390 
that's what counts it looked for a

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:44.690
