him<00:00:37.280> at<00:00:38.280> this<00:00:38.489> point<00:00:38.790> I<00:00:39.000> noticed<00:00:39.870> that<00:00:40.050> both<00:00:40.200> of

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:40.260 
him at this point I noticed that both of

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:43.990 
him at this point I noticed that both of
the<00:00:40.530> 10<00:00:40.710> nines<00:00:41.100> were<00:00:41.399> flying<00:00:41.700> in<00:00:42.090> as<00:00:42.360> well<00:00:42.719> so

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:44.000 
the 10 nines were flying in as well so

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.240 
the 10 nines were flying in as well so
it's<00:00:45.000> two-on-two<00:00:45.780> but<00:00:46.379> we<00:00:46.530> knew<00:00:46.800> that<00:00:46.829> there

00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:47.250 
it's two-on-two but we knew that there

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.400 
it's two-on-two but we knew that there
was<00:00:47.430> another<00:00:47.760> enemy<00:00:48.059> plane<00:00:48.480> in<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:48.870> area<00:00:49.260> as

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410 
was another enemy plane in the area as

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:51.319 
was another enemy plane in the area as
well<00:00:49.559> a<00:00:49.620> focke-wulf<00:00:50.010> but<00:00:50.940> we<00:00:51.059> didn't<00:00:51.239> know

00:00:51.319 --> 00:00:51.329 
well a focke-wulf but we didn't know

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:52.939 
well a focke-wulf but we didn't know
exactly<00:00:51.420> where<00:00:51.930> so<00:00:52.469> you<00:00:52.530> deal<00:00:52.710> with<00:00:52.860> the

00:00:52.939 --> 00:00:52.949 
exactly where so you deal with the

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:56.750 
exactly where so you deal with the
problem<00:00:53.280> that's<00:00:53.399> in<00:00:53.610> front<00:00:53.730> of<00:00:53.910> you<00:00:55.340> my<00:00:56.340> aim

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
problem that's in front of you my aim

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:59.569 
problem that's in front of you my aim
was<00:00:56.789> to<00:00:57.420> get<00:00:57.660> on<00:00:57.809> the<00:00:57.930> six<00:00:58.230> of<00:00:58.440> this<00:00:58.710> mig-3<00:00:59.309> and

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
was to get on the six of this mig-3 and

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.880 
was to get on the six of this mig-3 and
be<00:00:59.760> his<00:01:00.000> wingman<00:01:00.359> so<00:01:00.719> I<00:01:00.750> got<00:01:01.170> as<00:01:01.440> much<00:01:01.590> altitude

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 
be his wingman so I got as much altitude

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:04.490 
be his wingman so I got as much altitude
as<00:01:02.399> I<00:01:02.520> felt<00:01:02.699> I<00:01:02.879> needed<00:01:02.940> and<00:01:03.449> just<00:01:04.170> kept<00:01:04.409> a

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
as I felt I needed and just kept a

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:07.160 
as I felt I needed and just kept a
little<00:01:04.619> bit<00:01:04.830> behind<00:01:05.189> him<00:01:05.309> to<00:01:05.670> observe<00:01:06.170> now

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:07.170 
little bit behind him to observe now

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.780 
little bit behind him to observe now
you'll<00:01:07.290> see<00:01:07.350> he<00:01:07.710> goes<00:01:07.860> through<00:01:08.130> on<00:01:08.280> his<00:01:08.400> attack

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790 
you'll see he goes through on his attack

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.850 
you'll see he goes through on his attack
run<00:01:09.060> he<00:01:09.510> wasn't<00:01:09.780> very<00:01:09.869> successful<00:01:10.170> I<00:01:10.650> don't

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.860 
run he wasn't very successful I don't

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:12.920 
run he wasn't very successful I don't
think<00:01:11.010> he<00:01:11.130> landed<00:01:11.400> any<00:01:11.580> hits<00:01:11.909> but<00:01:12.119> he

00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:12.930 
think he landed any hits but he

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:15.560 
think he landed any hits but he
definitely<00:01:13.250> succeeded<00:01:14.250> in<00:01:14.580> snagging<00:01:15.150> one<00:01:15.420> of

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570 
definitely succeeded in snagging one of

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:18.170 
definitely succeeded in snagging one of
those<00:01:15.720> 109s<00:01:16.500> he<00:01:16.680> got<00:01:16.830> one<00:01:17.009> very<00:01:17.610> firmly<00:01:17.909> on<00:01:18.150> his

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180 
those 109s he got one very firmly on his

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.899 
those 109s he got one very firmly on his
tail<00:01:18.509> and<00:01:18.780> my<00:01:19.680> initial<00:01:20.009> instinct<00:01:20.520> to<00:01:20.640> go<00:01:20.759> after

00:01:20.899 --> 00:01:20.909 
tail and my initial instinct to go after

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.850 
tail and my initial instinct to go after
the<00:01:21.090> other<00:01:21.270> one<00:01:21.479> was<00:01:22.049> curtailed<00:01:22.439> in<00:01:22.770> the

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:22.860 
the other one was curtailed in the

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.700 
the other one was curtailed in the
interest<00:01:23.220> of<00:01:23.369> keeping<00:01:23.549> mr.<00:01:24.119> mig-3<00:01:24.689> alive<00:01:25.140> for

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:25.710 
interest of keeping mr. mig-3 alive for

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:29.600 
interest of keeping mr. mig-3 alive for
as<00:01:25.799> long<00:01:25.890> as<00:01:26.009> possible<00:01:27.979> this<00:01:28.979> is<00:01:29.100> one<00:01:29.280> thing<00:01:29.460> I

00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:29.610 
as long as possible this is one thing I

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.700 
as long as possible this is one thing I
happen<00:01:29.880> to<00:01:29.909> love<00:01:30.150> about<00:01:30.299> the<00:01:30.570> la-5<00:01:30.810> is<00:01:31.290> it<00:01:31.500> is

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:31.710 
happen to love about the la-5 is it is

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:34.280 
happen to love about the la-5 is it is
definitely<00:01:32.369> good<00:01:32.579> at<00:01:32.759> turning<00:01:33.049> certainly<00:01:34.049> it

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
definitely good at turning certainly it

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.980 
definitely good at turning certainly it
is<00:01:34.320> able<00:01:34.740> to<00:01:34.890> turn<00:01:35.070> inside<00:01:35.579> the<00:01:35.820> 109<00:01:36.360> @<00:01:36.810> it's

00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:36.990 
is able to turn inside the 109 @ it's

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.010 
is able to turn inside the 109 @ it's
sort<00:01:37.200> of<00:01:37.290> ideal<00:01:37.619> altitude<00:01:38.659> this<00:01:39.659> is<00:01:39.780> a<00:01:39.810> mid

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
sort of ideal altitude this is a mid

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.980 
sort of ideal altitude this is a mid
altitude<00:01:40.439> flight<00:01:40.790> so<00:01:41.790> I<00:01:41.820> go<00:01:42.060> in<00:01:42.090> on<00:01:42.360> this<00:01:42.390> 109

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990 
altitude flight so I go in on this 109

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:46.910 
altitude flight so I go in on this 109
as<00:01:43.259> he<00:01:43.530> goes<00:01:43.799> in<00:01:44.009> on<00:01:44.189> the<00:01:44.310> make<00:01:44.520> three<00:01:45.920> any

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:46.920 
as he goes in on the make three any

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:48.410 
as he goes in on the make three any
other<00:01:47.130> plane<00:01:47.430> I<00:01:47.640> would<00:01:47.880> not<00:01:48.030> be<00:01:48.149> able<00:01:48.240> to

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420 
other plane I would not be able to

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.600 
other plane I would not be able to
manage<00:01:49.140> this<00:01:49.350> with<00:01:49.560> combat<00:01:49.860> flaps<00:01:50.100> i<00:01:50.310> managed

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610 
manage this with combat flaps i managed

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:52.670 
manage this with combat flaps i managed
to<00:01:50.640> come<00:01:50.820> around<00:01:50.909> inside<00:01:51.450> of<00:01:51.659> him<00:01:51.810> and<00:01:52.020> I've

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
to come around inside of him and I've

on the tail of the 190 that was chasing

00:02:46.730 --> 00:02:49.960 
on the tail of the 190 that was chasing
the<00:02:46.849> mig<00:02:47.030> and<00:02:47.799> tried<00:02:48.799> to<00:02:48.980> snipe<00:02:49.250> away<00:02:49.579> at<00:02:49.760> him

the mig and tried to snipe away at him
this<00:02:50.209> is<00:02:50.329> a<00:02:50.360> problem<00:02:50.569> with<00:02:50.780> those<00:02:51.250> 20<00:02:52.250> metal

00:02:52.449 --> 00:02:52.459

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090 
of ammunition so you can't just spray

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:47.060 
turning into his attacks he would have

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:49.199 
turning into his attacks he would have
whittled<00:03:47.359> me<00:03:47.540> down<00:03:47.750> i'm<00:03:47.989> pretty<00:03:48.230> sure<00:03:48.500> because

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:49.209 
whittled me down i'm pretty sure because

00:03:49.209 --> 00:03:51.940 
whittled me down i'm pretty sure because
