 When I was just a little girl 

00:00:11.905 --> 00:00:18.573
 I asked my mother: What am I going to be? 

00:00:18.573 --> 00:00:21.238
 Am I going to be pretty? 

00:00:21.238 --> 00:00:23.783
 Am I going to be rich? 

00:00:23.783 --> 00:00:28.287
 Here is what she told me: 

00:00:28.287 --> 00:00:32.344
 What will be will be!! 

00:00:32.344 --> 00:00:37.283
 What will be, will be 

00:00:37.283 --> 00:00:42.014
 The future is not ours to see 

00:00:42.014 --> 00:00:47.014
 What will be will be 

00:00:47.014 --> 00:00:53.533
 What will be will be 

00:00:53.533 --> 00:00:58.456
 When I was just a little boy 

00:00:58.456 --> 00:01:04.906
 I asked my mother: What am I going to be? 

00:01:04.906 --> 00:01:07.576
 Am I going to be handsome? 

00:01:07.576 --> 00:01:10.117
 I'll be rich? 

00:01:10.117 --> 00:01:14.410
 Here is what she told me: 

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:18.542
 What will be will be 

00:01:18.542 --> 00:01:23.854
 What will be, will be 

00:01:23.854 --> 00:01:28.290
 The future is not ours to see 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.959
 What will be will be 

00:01:52.367 --> 00:01:56.367
 Life appears with differences, but the best care is to be assured from the beginning. - subtitles by opmalzahn.-
