00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160 
we're going to see it in between its

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:43.910 
we're going to see it in between its
usual<00:00:41.700> june-july<00:00:41.940> date<00:00:42.600> in<00:00:43.050> between<00:00:43.590> the

usual june-july date in between the
September<00:00:45.020> Apple<00:00:46.020> music<00:00:46.170> japan<00:00:46.469> and<00:00:46.739> I<00:00:46.770> think

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
we're to see it somewhere there call it

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:54.619 
we're to see it somewhere there call it
round<00:00:49.200> um<00:00:50.120> like<00:00:51.120> August<00:00:51.660> you<00:00:52.610> know<00:00:53.610> we<00:00:54.420> might

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:54.629 
round um like August you know we might

00:00:54.629 --> 00:00:56.930 
round um like August you know we might
see<00:00:54.960> a<00:00:54.989> little<00:00:55.110> bit<00:00:55.410> later<00:00:55.620> I<00:00:55.920> believe<00:00:56.399> usually

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:56.940 
see a little bit later I believe usually

00:00:56.940 --> 00:01:00.020 
see a little bit later I believe usually
they<00:00:57.090> do<00:00:57.149> announce<00:00:57.780> the<00:00:58.050> iphone<00:00:58.410> and<00:00:59.129> Jimmy

00:01:00.020 --> 00:01:00.030 
they do announce the iphone and Jimmy

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.070 
they do announce the iphone and Jimmy
but<00:01:00.960> with<00:01:01.469> the<00:01:01.620> wdc<00:01:02.370> they<00:01:02.910> on<00:01:03.180> the<00:01:03.690> apples

00:01:04.070 --> 00:01:04.080 
but with the wdc they on the apples

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.600 
but with the wdc they on the apples
homepage<00:01:04.530> and<00:01:04.830> ever<00:01:04.979> they<00:01:05.159> were<00:01:05.280> announcing

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:05.610 
homepage and ever they were announcing

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:06.950 
homepage and ever they were announcing
it<00:01:05.790> they<00:01:06.150> didn't<00:01:06.360> say<00:01:06.479> anything<00:01:06.510> about

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
it they didn't say anything about

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.170 
it they didn't say anything about
talking<00:01:07.470> about<00:01:07.650> harder<00:01:08.070> all<00:01:08.430> I<00:01:08.490> said<00:01:08.880> that<00:01:09.060> was

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
talking about harder all I said that was

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.260 
talking about harder all I said that was
going<00:01:09.390> to<00:01:09.420> be<00:01:09.479> the<00:01:09.659> future<00:01:09.900> of<00:01:10.140> mac<00:01:10.560> and<00:01:10.799> iOS<00:01:11.310> so

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270 
going to be the future of mac and iOS so

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:13.700 
going to be the future of mac and iOS so
we<00:01:12.840> don't<00:01:12.960> know<00:01:13.140> if<00:01:13.170> this<00:01:13.290> is<00:01:13.380> going<00:01:13.560> to<00:01:13.650> be

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:13.710 
we don't know if this is going to be

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.190 
we don't know if this is going to be
Harvey<00:01:14.220> related<00:01:14.640> actually<00:01:15.299> usually<00:01:15.540> does<00:01:15.930> say

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:16.200 
Harvey related actually usually does say

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.050 
Harvey related actually usually does say
no<00:01:16.500> we're<00:01:16.799> in<00:01:16.830> a<00:01:17.009> taco<00:01:17.250> I<00:01:17.729> let<00:01:18.509> me<00:01:18.600> go

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:19.060 
no we're in a taco I let me go

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:22.620

see we didn't see that this year so that

00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:24.480 
see we didn't see that this year so that
might<00:01:22.869> have<00:01:22.960> been<00:01:23.020> because<00:01:23.229> of<00:01:23.470> their<00:01:23.890> push

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:24.490 
might have been because of their push

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:26.670 
might have been because of their push
back<00:01:24.729> release<00:01:25.149> date<00:01:25.420> they<00:01:26.079> couldn't<00:01:26.380> you<00:01:26.530> have

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:26.680 
back release date they couldn't you have

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:28.560 
back release date they couldn't you have
just<00:01:26.770> forgot<00:01:27.310> about<00:01:27.340> that<00:01:27.579> just<00:01:28.030> decide<00:01:28.509> to

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:28.570 
just forgot about that just decide to

00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:30.960 
just forgot about that just decide to
put<00:01:28.780> it<00:01:28.869> in<00:01:28.960> there<00:01:29.140> we<00:01:29.920> really<00:01:30.189> don't<00:01:30.280> know<00:01:30.490> but

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:30.970 
put it in there we really don't know but

00:01:30.970 --> 00:01:34.950 
put it in there we really don't know but
I<00:01:31.180> do<00:01:31.840> not<00:01:32.020> see<00:01:32.409> the<00:01:32.890> iphone<00:01:33.250> 5<00:01:33.490> pain<00:01:33.789> debut<00:01:34.360> at

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:34.960 
I do not see the iphone 5 pain debut at

00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:39.359 
I do not see the iphone 5 pain debut at
all<00:01:35.200> NW<00:01:36.159> wdc<00:01:36.399> so<00:01:37.090> I<00:01:37.179> out<00:01:37.390> there<00:01:37.710> so<00:01:38.710> processor

00:01:39.359 --> 00:01:39.369 
all NW wdc so I out there so processor

00:01:39.369 --> 00:01:41.639 
all NW wdc so I out there so processor
and<00:01:39.670> ram<00:01:40.000> um<00:01:40.360> I<00:01:40.840> think<00:01:40.869> that<00:01:41.229> we'll<00:01:41.409> need<00:01:41.470> to

00:01:41.639 --> 00:01:41.649 
and ram um I think that we'll need to

00:01:41.649 --> 00:01:43.980 
and ram um I think that we'll need to
step<00:01:41.920> it<00:01:42.070> up<00:01:42.159> again<00:01:42.670> this<00:01:42.850> year<00:01:42.909> the<00:01:43.479> a4<00:01:43.960> chip

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:43.990 
step it up again this year the a4 chip

00:01:43.990 --> 00:01:46.499 
step it up again this year the a4 chip
was<00:01:44.439> really<00:01:44.829> good<00:01:45.070> but<00:01:45.729> I<00:01:45.909> think<00:01:46.149> that<00:01:46.329> with

00:01:46.499 --> 00:01:46.509 
was really good but I think that with

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:48.210 
was really good but I think that with
all<00:01:46.659> these<00:01:46.810> dual<00:01:47.079> core<00:01:47.409> smart<00:01:47.799> phones<00:01:48.009> out

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:48.220 
all these dual core smart phones out

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:51.180 
all these dual core smart phones out
there<00:01:48.250> on<00:01:48.670> that<00:01:48.990> you<00:01:49.990> know<00:01:50.020> a<00:01:50.110> police<00:01:50.590> get<00:01:50.950> out

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:51.190 
there on that you know a police get out

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:53.460 
there on that you know a police get out
there<00:01:51.520> with<00:01:51.549> the<00:01:51.819> dual-core<00:01:52.270> chip<00:01:52.330> so<00:01:53.110> I<00:01:53.140> see

00:01:53.460 --> 00:01:53.470 
there with the dual-core chip so I see

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:57.960 
there with the dual-core chip so I see
the<00:01:53.619> uncle<00:01:54.340> 85<00:01:54.759> um<00:01:55.440> really<00:01:56.440> fast<00:01:56.860> you<00:01:57.549> know<00:01:57.670> one

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:57.970 
the uncle 85 um really fast you know one

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:01.050 
the uncle 85 um really fast you know one
gigahertz<00:01:58.590> they<00:01:59.590> might<00:01:59.799> underclock<00:02:00.310> it<00:02:00.520> but

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:01.060 
gigahertz they might underclock it but

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:05.070 
gigahertz they might underclock it but
it<00:02:01.240> is<00:02:01.390> a<00:02:01.630> dual-core<00:02:02.140> chip<00:02:03.240> also<00:02:04.240> for<00:02:04.479> a<00:02:04.539> ram<00:02:04.750> I

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:05.080 
it is a dual-core chip also for a ram I

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:09.120 
it is a dual-core chip also for a ram I
i<00:02:05.649> can<00:02:05.979> see<00:02:06.689> improvement<00:02:07.689> may<00:02:07.810> be<00:02:07.840> like<00:02:08.170> 768

00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:09.130 
i can see improvement may be like 768

00:02:09.130 --> 00:02:12.479 
i can see improvement may be like 768
maybe<00:02:09.910> even<00:02:10.360> a<00:02:10.569> gigabyte<00:02:11.110> we'll<00:02:12.010> see<00:02:12.250> how<00:02:12.430> that

00:02:12.479 --> 00:02:12.489 
maybe even a gigabyte we'll see how that

00:02:12.489 --> 00:02:14.850 
maybe even a gigabyte we'll see how that
works<00:02:12.700> out<00:02:13.110> I've<00:02:14.110> just<00:02:14.170> had<00:02:14.560> some<00:02:14.739> more

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:14.860 
works out I've just had some more

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:17.630 
works out I've just had some more
processing<00:02:15.489> power<00:02:15.519> really<00:02:16.090> but<00:02:16.840> we'll<00:02:17.080> see

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
processing power really but we'll see

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:23.130 
processing power really but we'll see
all<00:02:18.640> the<00:02:19.090> hotel<00:02:19.560> also<00:02:20.730> the<00:02:21.730> a5<00:02:22.150> chip<00:02:22.450> does<00:02:22.780> come

00:02:23.130 --> 00:02:23.140 
all the hotel also the a5 chip does come

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:26.250 
all the hotel also the a5 chip does come
better<00:02:23.820> graphics<00:02:24.820> this<00:02:25.390> came<00:02:25.630> with<00:02:25.660> the<00:02:25.870> ipad

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:26.260 
better graphics this came with the ipad

00:02:26.260 --> 00:02:28.920 
better graphics this came with the ipad
2<00:02:26.500> when<00:02:27.400> you<00:02:27.459> have<00:02:27.609> to<00:02:27.730> paint<00:02:28.000> into<00:02:28.510> graphics

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:28.930 
2 when you have to paint into graphics

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:30.870 
2 when you have to paint into graphics
we<00:02:29.410> actually<00:02:29.709> did<00:02:29.920> see<00:02:30.160> something<00:02:30.400> around

00:02:30.870 --> 00:02:30.880 
we actually did see something around

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:34.819 
we actually did see something around
eight<00:02:31.239> times<00:02:31.660> so<00:02:32.440> we<00:02:33.100> will<00:02:33.310> see<00:02:33.640> most<00:02:34.390> likely

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:34.829 
eight times so we will see most likely

00:02:34.829 --> 00:02:37.440 
eight times so we will see most likely
same<00:02:35.829> thing<00:02:36.130> as<00:02:36.310> long<00:02:36.489> as<00:02:36.700> Apple<00:02:37.030> uses

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:37.450 
same thing as long as Apple uses

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:39.599 
same thing as long as Apple uses
basically<00:02:37.930> the<00:02:38.079> same<00:02:38.260> a5<00:02:38.739> chip<00:02:39.069> we'll

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:39.609 
basically the same a5 chip we'll

00:02:39.609 --> 00:02:42.539 
basically the same a5 chip we'll
probably<00:02:39.730> see<00:02:40.060> a<00:02:40.090> lot<00:02:40.209> better<00:02:40.780> crags<00:02:41.549> why

00:02:42.539 --> 00:02:42.549 
probably see a lot better crags why

00:02:42.549 --> 00:02:44.039 
probably see a lot better crags why
don't<00:02:42.700> you<00:02:42.760> plug<00:02:42.940> in<00:02:43.150> saying<00:02:43.510> that<00:02:43.810> there's

00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:44.049 
don't you plug in saying that there's

00:02:44.049 --> 00:02:47.729 
don't you plug in saying that there's
going<00:02:44.170> to<00:02:44.260> be<00:02:44.319> a<00:02:44.410> better<00:02:45.329> at<00:02:46.329> least<00:02:46.600> a<00:02:46.900> larger

00:02:47.729 --> 00:02:47.739 
going to be a better at least a larger

00:02:47.739 --> 00:02:51.090 
going to be a better at least a larger

screen<00:02:54.440> wasn't<00:02:54.980> really<00:02:55.670> small<00:02:56.150> at<00:02:56.330> all<00:02:56.450> but

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:57.080 
screen wasn't really small at all but

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:59.110

you know with all these big folks coming
out<00:02:59.180> you<00:02:59.269> know<00:02:59.390> like<00:02:59.510> the<00:02:59.629> evo<00:02:59.989> it's<00:03:00.200> not<00:03:00.379> about

00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:00.620 
out you know like the evo it's not about

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:03.530 
all these really big Android phones the

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:05.890 
all these really big Android phones the
iphone<00:03:03.920> screen<00:03:04.640> is<00:03:04.670> going<00:03:05.120> to<00:03:05.209> look<00:03:05.390> even<00:03:05.629> a

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:05.900 
iphone screen is going to look even a

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:08.589 
iphone screen is going to look even a
little<00:03:06.110> bit<00:03:06.200> small<00:03:06.830> I<00:03:07.250> think<00:03:08.060> that<00:03:08.120> apple<00:03:08.510> will

00:03:08.589 --> 00:03:08.599 
little bit small I think that apple will

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:12.339 
little bit small I think that apple will
put<00:03:09.319> the<00:03:09.440> screen<00:03:09.709> edge<00:03:10.640> of<00:03:10.849> the<00:03:10.970> edge<00:03:11.090> but<00:03:12.049> I

00:03:12.339 --> 00:03:12.349 
put the screen edge of the edge but I

00:03:12.349 --> 00:03:14.289 
put the screen edge of the edge but I
was<00:03:12.769> looking<00:03:12.980> I<00:03:13.099> phone<00:03:13.430> that<00:03:13.700> came<00:03:13.849> quite

00:03:14.289 --> 00:03:14.299 
was looking I phone that came quite

00:03:14.299 --> 00:03:16.180 
was looking I phone that came quite
lumina<00:03:14.750> I<00:03:14.780> don't<00:03:15.019> really<00:03:15.110> see<00:03:15.200> them<00:03:15.620> changing

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:16.190 
lumina I don't really see them changing

00:03:16.190 --> 00:03:18.520 
lumina I don't really see them changing
the<00:03:16.310> resolution<00:03:16.489> of<00:03:16.910> the<00:03:17.030> phone<00:03:17.530> especially

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:18.530 
the resolution of the phone especially

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:20.080 
the resolution of the phone especially
because<00:03:18.799> all<00:03:19.040> the<00:03:19.160> apps<00:03:19.340> are<00:03:19.790> going<00:03:19.819> to<00:03:20.030> you

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:20.090 
because all the apps are going to you

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:22.000 
because all the apps are going to you
know<00:03:20.269> not<00:03:20.810> look<00:03:21.140> as<00:03:21.290> good<00:03:21.530> and<00:03:21.739> if<00:03:21.829> they're

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.010 
know not look as good and if they're

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:25.000 
know not look as good and if they're
stretched<00:03:22.370> out<00:03:22.640> so<00:03:23.269> I<00:03:23.299> see<00:03:23.659> a<00:03:23.930> bigger<00:03:24.379> iphone

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.010 
stretched out so I see a bigger iphone

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:26.860 
stretched out so I see a bigger iphone
this<00:03:25.280> year's<00:03:25.610> for<00:03:25.849> this<00:03:25.879> is<00:03:26.060> a<00:03:26.120> design<00:03:26.450> because

00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:26.870 
this year's for this is a design because

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:29.050 
this year's for this is a design because
this<00:03:27.049> is<00:03:27.319> going<00:03:27.530> to<00:03:27.650> be<00:03:27.769> a<00:03:27.980> minor<00:03:28.370> improvement

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:29.060 
this is going to be a minor improvement

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:31.720 
this is going to be a minor improvement
for<00:03:29.239> the<00:03:29.329> iphone<00:03:29.660> 4<00:03:30.079> I<00:03:30.349> think<00:03:31.340> we're<00:03:31.489> going<00:03:31.610> to

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:31.730 
for the iphone 4 I think we're going to

00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:34.300 
for the iphone 4 I think we're going to
see<00:03:31.760> basically<00:03:32.359> the<00:03:32.510> same<00:03:32.690> design<00:03:33.310> obviously

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:34.310 
see basically the same design obviously

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:37.599 
see basically the same design obviously
a<00:03:34.340> quill<00:03:34.760> will<00:03:35.209> fix<00:03:36.019> the<00:03:36.230> antenna<00:03:36.349> issue<00:03:36.829> but<00:03:37.549> a

00:03:37.599 --> 00:03:37.609 
a quill will fix the antenna issue but a

00:03:37.609 --> 00:03:38.860 
a quill will fix the antenna issue but a
lot<00:03:37.760> of<00:03:37.790> people<00:03:37.849> in<00:03:38.150> saying<00:03:38.480> you<00:03:38.629> know<00:03:38.690> there's

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:38.870 
lot of people in saying you know there's

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:40.960 
lot of people in saying you know there's
going<00:03:38.989> to<00:03:39.079> be<00:03:39.109> a<00:03:39.170> chrome<00:03:39.470> back<00:03:39.680> or<00:03:39.859> something<00:03:39.980> I

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:40.970 
going to be a chrome back or something I

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:42.729 
going to be a chrome back or something I
don't<00:03:41.629> really<00:03:41.780> see<00:03:41.900> that<00:03:42.140> I<00:03:42.470> think<00:03:42.650> they

00:03:42.729 --> 00:03:42.739 
don't really see that I think they

00:03:42.739 --> 00:03:44.440 
don't really see that I think they
really<00:03:43.099> liked<00:03:43.310> the<00:03:43.549> idea<00:03:43.670> of<00:03:43.910> having<00:03:44.120> the

00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:44.450 
really liked the idea of having the

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:46.839 
really liked the idea of having the
engine<00:03:44.750> on<00:03:44.900> the<00:03:45.079> outside<00:03:45.470> personally<00:03:46.250> I<00:03:46.430> liked

00:03:46.839 --> 00:03:46.849 
engine on the outside personally I liked

00:03:46.849 --> 00:03:50.140 
engine on the outside personally I liked
the<00:03:47.030> idea<00:03:47.209> is<00:03:47.870> saved<00:03:48.200> a<00:03:48.319> lot<00:03:48.500> of<00:03:48.560> space<00:03:49.150> they

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:50.150 
the idea is saved a lot of space they

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:52.330 
the idea is saved a lot of space they
can<00:03:50.299> just<00:03:50.510> fix<00:03:50.780> that<00:03:51.019> up<00:03:51.230> then<00:03:51.739> if<00:03:52.010> it

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:52.340 
can just fix that up then if it

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:54.130 
can just fix that up then if it
shouldn't<00:03:52.700> work<00:03:52.790> you<00:03:53.060> know<00:03:53.180> fantastically

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:54.140 
shouldn't work you know fantastically

00:03:54.140 --> 00:03:56.770 
shouldn't work you know fantastically
and<00:03:54.379> you<00:03:55.099> know<00:03:55.250> if<00:03:55.549> they<00:03:55.849> if<00:03:56.299> they<00:03:56.480> can<00:03:56.660> do<00:03:56.750> that

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:56.780 
and you know if they if they can do that

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:59.979 
and you know if they if they can do that
that'd<00:03:57.500> be<00:03:57.530> great<00:03:58.090> we<00:03:59.090> might<00:03:59.299> even<00:03:59.329> see<00:03:59.599> we

00:03:59.979 --> 00:03:59.989 
that'd be great we might even see we

00:03:59.989 --> 00:04:02.920 
that'd be great we might even see we
might<00:04:00.169> see<00:04:00.500> the<00:04:00.680> iphone<00:04:01.069> 5<00:04:01.730> which<00:04:02.389> you<00:04:02.720> know<00:04:02.810> we

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:02.930 
might see the iphone 5 which you know we

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:04.210 
might see the iphone 5 which you know we
don't<00:04:02.989> know<00:04:03.139> that's<00:04:03.349> gonna<00:04:03.620> be<00:04:03.739> called<00:04:03.980> by<00:04:04.160> the

00:04:04.210 --> 00:04:04.220 
don't know that's gonna be called by the

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:07.300 
don't know that's gonna be called by the
way<00:04:04.400> get<00:04:05.239> a<00:04:05.269> little<00:04:05.660> bit<00:04:05.810> thinner<00:04:06.109> I<00:04:06.440> believe

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:07.310 
way get a little bit thinner I believe

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:09.190 
way get a little bit thinner I believe
there<00:04:07.489> is<00:04:07.940> a<00:04:07.970> smartphone<00:04:08.569> or<00:04:08.690> true<00:04:08.810> that<00:04:08.989> did

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:09.200 
there is a smartphone or true that did

00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:12.569 
there is a smartphone or true that did
beat<00:04:09.440> the<00:04:09.560> iphone<00:04:09.919> as<00:04:10.160> far<00:04:10.609> as<00:04:10.880> its<00:04:11.410> thickness

00:04:12.569 --> 00:04:12.579 
beat the iphone as far as its thickness

00:04:12.579 --> 00:04:15.819 
beat the iphone as far as its thickness
but<00:04:13.579> I<00:04:13.639> think<00:04:13.970> we<00:04:14.090> will<00:04:14.269> see<00:04:14.569> a<00:04:14.870> thin<00:04:15.620> your

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:15.829 
but I think we will see a thin your

00:04:15.829 --> 00:04:20.009 
but I think we will see a thin your
iphone<00:04:16.250> 5<00:04:17.560> now<00:04:18.560> on<00:04:18.799> to<00:04:19.039> the<00:04:19.160> cameras

00:04:20.009 --> 00:04:20.019 
iphone 5 now on to the cameras

00:04:20.019 --> 00:04:22.779 
iphone 5 now on to the cameras
personally<00:04:21.019> I<00:04:21.139> see<00:04:21.470> a<00:04:21.500> much<00:04:21.950> better<00:04:22.220> camera<00:04:22.639> I

00:04:22.779 --> 00:04:22.789 
personally I see a much better camera I

00:04:22.789 --> 00:04:24.450 
personally I see a much better camera I
think<00:04:23.060> apple<00:04:23.389> will<00:04:23.419> increase

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:24.460 
think apple will increase

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:26.879 
think apple will increase
pixel<00:04:24.940> camera<00:04:25.150> as<00:04:25.389> well<00:04:25.449> as<00:04:26.319> the<00:04:26.500> lines<00:04:26.710> of

00:04:26.879 --> 00:04:26.889

00:04:29.129 --> 00:04:29.139 
resolution for the camera on the back

00:04:29.139 --> 00:04:31.680 
resolution for the camera on the back
facing<00:04:29.650> but<00:04:30.340> also<00:04:30.639> in<00:04:30.970> the<00:04:31.060> front<00:04:31.300> facing

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:31.690

00:04:36.659 --> 00:04:36.669 
imacs the 720p front-facing camera I

00:04:36.669 --> 00:04:39.059 
imacs the 720p front-facing camera I
don't<00:04:37.389> think<00:04:37.690> we're<00:04:37.810> going<00:04:37.900> to<00:04:37.990> see<00:04:38.020> 720p<00:04:38.860> on<00:04:39.039> a

00:04:39.059 --> 00:04:39.069 
don't think we're going to see 720p on a

00:04:39.069 --> 00:04:42.180 
don't think we're going to see 720p on a
front<00:04:39.490> facing<00:04:39.729> camera<00:04:40.180> quite<00:04:40.509> yet<00:04:41.190> appleton

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:42.190 
front facing camera quite yet appleton

00:04:42.190 --> 00:04:44.550 
front facing camera quite yet appleton
still<00:04:42.520> just<00:04:43.030> surprised<00:04:43.569> us<00:04:43.900> right<00:04:44.110> there<00:04:44.380> I

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:44.560 
still just surprised us right there I

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:46.800 
still just surprised us right there I
think<00:04:45.099> we<00:04:45.190> will<00:04:45.340> see<00:04:45.550> a<00:04:45.580> much<00:04:46.030> better<00:04:46.330> camera

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:46.810 
think we will see a much better camera

00:04:46.810 --> 00:04:48.839 
think we will see a much better camera
there<00:04:46.990> all<00:04:47.380> right<00:04:47.560> now<00:04:47.710> it's<00:04:47.860> vga<00:04:48.430> and<00:04:48.460> that's

00:04:48.839 --> 00:04:48.849 
there all right now it's vga and that's

00:04:48.849 --> 00:04:52.230 
there all right now it's vga and that's
not<00:04:49.300> really<00:04:49.770> the<00:04:50.770> greatest<00:04:51.009> resolution<00:04:51.759> out

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:52.240 
not really the greatest resolution out

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:54.870 
not really the greatest resolution out
there<00:04:52.720> i<00:04:52.960> think<00:04:53.710> i'm<00:04:53.860> gonna<00:04:54.160> do<00:04:54.250> a<00:04:54.280> lot<00:04:54.639> better

00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:54.880 
there i think i'm gonna do a lot better

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:56.969 
there i think i'm gonna do a lot better
on<00:04:55.030> that<00:04:55.180> and<00:04:55.599> i'm<00:04:56.110> pretty<00:04:56.349> sure<00:04:56.590> they<00:04:56.770> will

00:04:56.969 --> 00:04:56.979 
on that and i'm pretty sure they will

00:04:56.979 --> 00:04:59.909 
on that and i'm pretty sure they will
because<00:04:57.400> the<00:04:57.520> camera<00:04:57.880> is<00:04:58.229> is<00:04:59.229> really<00:04:59.560> dragging

00:04:59.909 --> 00:04:59.919 
because the camera is is really dragging

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:01.560 
because the camera is is really dragging
especially<00:05:00.669> if<00:05:00.729> they<00:05:00.820> want<00:05:01.030> to<00:05:01.090> put<00:05:01.180> a<00:05:01.240> Retina
