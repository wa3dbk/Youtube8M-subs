whale<00:02:40.170> am<00:02:41.100> much<00:02:41.970> more<00:02:42.180> vulnerable<00:02:42.360> whereas<00:02:43.050> I

00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:43.170 
whale am much more vulnerable whereas I

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:44.690 
whale am much more vulnerable whereas I
might<00:02:43.380> choose<00:02:43.590> something<00:02:43.890> that<00:02:44.070> allows<00:02:44.400> me<00:02:44.670> to

00:02:44.690 --> 00:02:44.700 
might choose something that allows me to

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:46.910 
might choose something that allows me to
better<00:02:45.390> suspension<00:02:45.870> allows<00:02:46.410> me<00:02:46.680> to<00:02:46.800> go<00:02:46.890> over

00:02:46.910 --> 00:02:46.920 
better suspension allows me to go over

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:50.090 
better suspension allows me to go over
rugged<00:02:47.750> rocky<00:02:48.750> terrain<00:02:48.930> and<00:02:49.260> so<00:02:49.410> on<00:02:49.560> maybe

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:50.100 
rugged rocky terrain and so on maybe

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:51.920 
rugged rocky terrain and so on maybe
explore<00:02:50.640> more<00:02:50.880> of<00:02:50.940> the<00:02:51.090> world<00:02:51.330> that<00:02:51.510> you<00:02:51.690> can't

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:51.930 
explore more of the world that you can't

00:02:51.930 --> 00:02:55.010 
explore more of the world that you can't
get<00:02:52.140> to<00:02:52.370> so<00:02:53.370> your<00:02:53.940> magnum<00:02:54.270> opus<00:02:54.360> will<00:02:54.690> really

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:55.020 
get to so your magnum opus will really

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:56.780 
get to so your magnum opus will really
be<00:02:55.170> an<00:02:55.500> expression<00:02:56.100> of<00:02:56.160> the<00:02:56.280> choices<00:02:56.490> you've

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
be an expression of the choices you've

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.180 
be an expression of the choices you've
made<00:02:56.820> on<00:02:57.209> you<00:02:57.390> your<00:02:57.750> player<00:02:58.110> style<00:02:58.410> understood
