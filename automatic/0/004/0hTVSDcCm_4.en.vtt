accomplish you're forced to accomplish
them<00:05:29.040> before<00:05:29.310> you<00:05:29.400> can<00:05:29.520> move<00:05:29.640> on<00:05:29.850> so<00:05:30.330> you

00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:30.390 
them before you can move on so you

00:05:30.390 --> 00:05:33.380 
them before you can move on so you
yourself<00:05:31.200> actually<00:05:31.740> you<00:05:31.830> were<00:05:32.070> a<00:05:32.520> slave<00:05:33.000> to

00:05:33.380 --> 00:05:33.390 
yourself actually you were a slave to

00:05:33.390 --> 00:05:35.510 
yourself actually you were a slave to
the<00:05:33.480> game<00:05:33.660> you<00:05:34.050> could<00:05:34.290> decide<00:05:34.950> how<00:05:35.160> you<00:05:35.220> want

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:35.520 
the game you could decide how you want

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:38.710 
the game you could decide how you want
to<00:05:35.550> do<00:05:35.700> it<00:05:35.790> didn't<00:05:36.120> feel<00:05:36.690> completely<00:05:37.620> linear

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:38.720 
to do it didn't feel completely linear

00:05:38.720 --> 00:05:41.630 
to do it didn't feel completely linear
but<00:05:39.720> it<00:05:39.870> was<00:05:40.110> at<00:05:40.530> the<00:05:40.680> end<00:05:40.800> of<00:05:40.860> the<00:05:40.950> day<00:05:41.070> and<00:05:41.250> so

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:41.640 
but it was at the end of the day and so

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:43.520 
but it was at the end of the day and so
that<00:05:41.790> sort<00:05:42.030> of<00:05:42.120> trick<00:05:42.390> that<00:05:42.570> most<00:05:42.750> games<00:05:43.020> play

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:43.530 
that sort of trick that most games play

00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:44.960 
that sort of trick that most games play
where<00:05:43.980> you<00:05:44.010> know<00:05:44.280> they<00:05:44.430> have<00:05:44.580> a<00:05:44.610> story<00:05:44.910> that

where you know they have a story that

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:45.830 
where you know they have a story that
they<00:05:45.120> want<00:05:45.330> to<00:05:45.419> tell<00:05:45.570> them<00:05:45.690> they're<00:05:45.780> gonna

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:45.840 
they want to tell them they're gonna

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:47.150 
they want to tell them they're gonna
find<00:05:46.169> a<00:05:46.230> way<00:05:46.320> to<00:05:46.380> tell<00:05:46.620> it<00:05:46.710> to<00:05:46.770> you<00:05:46.890> no<00:05:46.980> matter

feel that in this scene on top of that

00:05:54.990 --> 00:05:57.230 
feel that in this scene on top of that
it<00:05:55.200> uses<00:05:55.560> the<00:05:55.770> fact<00:05:56.160> that<00:05:56.280> a<00:05:56.430> story<00:05:56.760> has<00:05:57.030> to

00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:57.240 
it uses the fact that a story has to

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:00.080 
it uses the fact that a story has to
start<00:05:57.450> somewhere<00:05:57.900> as<00:05:58.440> a<00:05:59.190> plot<00:05:59.430> device<00:05:59.490> which

00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:00.090 
start somewhere as a plot device which

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:01.430 
start somewhere as a plot device which
is<00:06:00.240> something<00:06:00.660> that<00:06:00.840> like<00:06:01.020> you<00:06:01.140> know<00:06:01.169> you<00:06:01.290> can

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:01.440 
is something that like you know you can

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:03.350 
is something that like you know you can
do<00:06:01.560> in<00:06:01.680> any<00:06:01.890> medium<00:06:02.340> but<00:06:02.610> it's<00:06:02.760> always<00:06:03.060> sort<00:06:03.270> of

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:03.360 
do in any medium but it's always sort of

do in any medium but it's always sort of
a<00:06:03.419> pretty<00:06:03.660> cool<00:06:03.900> thing<00:06:04.110> to<00:06:04.140> do<00:06:04.350> the<00:06:04.860> fact<00:06:05.190> that

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:05.340 
a pretty cool thing to do the fact that

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:07.880 
a pretty cool thing to do the fact that
your<00:06:05.940> character<00:06:06.240> did<00:06:06.720> actually<00:06:07.020> have<00:06:07.590> this

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:07.890 
your character did actually have this

00:06:07.890 --> 00:06:11.360 
your character did actually have this
life<00:06:08.280> that<00:06:08.760> you<00:06:09.660> thought<00:06:10.350> you<00:06:10.590> knew<00:06:10.770> about<00:06:10.800> but

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:11.370 
life that you thought you knew about but

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:14.090 
life that you thought you knew about but
it<00:06:11.490> turns<00:06:11.669> out<00:06:11.850> that<00:06:12.150> was<00:06:12.840> all<00:06:12.990> a<00:06:13.020> lie<00:06:13.320> and<00:06:13.860> it

00:06:14.090 --> 00:06:14.100 
it turns out that was all a lie and it

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:16.460 
it turns out that was all a lie and it

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:22.470 
ended up on this plane you know how you

00:06:22.470 --> 00:06:23.810 
ended up on this plane you know how you
got<00:06:22.740> there<00:06:23.039> and<00:06:23.340> you<00:06:23.490> didn't<00:06:23.640> really<00:06:23.729> think

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:23.820 
got there and you didn't really think

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:25.719 
got there and you didn't really think
about<00:06:24.060> it<00:06:24.210> because<00:06:24.479> that's<00:06:24.570> how<00:06:24.780> stories<00:06:25.020> work

00:06:25.719 --> 00:06:25.729 
about it because that's how stories work

00:06:25.729 --> 00:06:28.040 
about it because that's how stories work
but<00:06:26.729> at<00:06:27.000> the<00:06:27.210> end<00:06:27.240> of<00:06:27.360> the<00:06:27.450> day<00:06:27.600> you

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:28.050 
but at the end of the day you

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:29.869 
but at the end of the day you
put<00:06:28.199> on<00:06:28.319> that<00:06:28.500> plane<00:06:28.770> the<00:06:29.099> plane<00:06:29.490> was<00:06:29.729> hijacked

00:06:29.869 --> 00:06:29.879 
put on that plane the plane was hijacked

00:06:29.879 --> 00:06:32.059 
put on that plane the plane was hijacked
it<00:06:30.389> was<00:06:30.479> crashed<00:06:30.810> next<00:06:31.169> to<00:06:31.259> a<00:06:31.289> lighthouse<00:06:31.740> and

00:06:32.059 --> 00:06:32.069 
it was crashed next to a lighthouse and

00:06:32.069 --> 00:06:33.740 
it was crashed next to a lighthouse and
probably<00:06:32.550> on<00:06:32.819> your<00:06:32.970> first<00:06:33.210> playthrough<00:06:33.449> the

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:33.750 
probably on your first playthrough the

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:35.930 
probably on your first playthrough the
game<00:06:33.900> you<00:06:34.740> didn't<00:06:34.979> think<00:06:35.009> anything<00:06:35.430> of<00:06:35.669> any<00:06:35.819> of

00:06:35.930 --> 00:06:35.940 
game you didn't think anything of any of

00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:37.040 
game you didn't think anything of any of
that<00:06:36.030> you<00:06:36.210> were<00:06:36.300> just<00:06:36.479> taking<00:06:36.780> it<00:06:36.870> for<00:06:37.020> granted

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:37.050 
that you were just taking it for granted

00:06:37.050 --> 00:06:38.510 
that you were just taking it for granted
because<00:06:37.409> it<00:06:37.620> was<00:06:37.710> the<00:06:37.800> introduction<00:06:38.220> and

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:38.520 
because it was the introduction and

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:40.610 
because it was the introduction and
that's<00:06:38.669> sort<00:06:38.909> of<00:06:39.000> where<00:06:39.270> you<00:06:39.599> know<00:06:39.750> suspension

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:40.620 
that's sort of where you know suspension

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:42.350 
that's sort of where you know suspension
of<00:06:40.710> disbelief<00:06:40.800> is<00:06:41.340> sort<00:06:41.610> of<00:06:41.669> the<00:06:41.789> strongest

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:42.360 
of disbelief is sort of the strongest

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:45.350 
of disbelief is sort of the strongest
and<00:06:42.599> using<00:06:43.470> that<00:06:43.500> to<00:06:43.680> tell<00:06:44.400> this<00:06:44.550> story<00:06:44.610> and<00:06:45.120> to

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:45.360 
and using that to tell this story and to

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:47.420 
and using that to tell this story and to
make<00:06:45.569> this<00:06:45.750> turn<00:06:45.990> effective<00:06:46.530> was<00:06:46.919> excellent

00:06:47.420 --> 00:06:47.430 
make this turn effective was excellent

00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:49.399 
make this turn effective was excellent
more<00:06:47.879> so<00:06:48.090> than<00:06:48.120> anything<00:06:48.750> else<00:06:48.900> however<00:06:49.080> I

00:06:49.399 --> 00:06:49.409 
more so than anything else however I

00:06:49.409 --> 00:06:52.369 
more so than anything else however I
think<00:06:49.530> that<00:06:50.210> the<00:06:51.210> most<00:06:51.330> artistic<00:06:51.870> thing<00:06:52.169> that

00:06:52.369 --> 00:06:52.379 
think that the most artistic thing that

00:06:52.379 --> 00:06:54.830 
think that the most artistic thing that
rational<00:06:52.770> games<00:06:53.039> did<00:06:53.370> is<00:06:53.520> they<00:06:53.789> made<00:06:54.180> a<00:06:54.389> story

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:54.840 
rational games did is they made a story

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:57.800 
rational games did is they made a story
that<00:06:55.710> was<00:06:55.889> most<00:06:56.159> effectively<00:06:56.789> told<00:06:57.210> through<00:06:57.780> a

00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:57.810 
that was most effectively told through a

00:06:57.810 --> 00:07:00.589 
that was most effectively told through a
video<00:06:58.229> game<00:06:58.530> a<00:06:58.970> lot<00:06:59.970> of<00:07:00.060> times<00:07:00.240> you<00:07:00.389> get<00:07:00.479> the

00:07:00.589 --> 00:07:00.599 
video game a lot of times you get the

00:07:00.599 --> 00:07:03.439 
video game a lot of times you get the
impression<00:07:00.810> in<00:07:01.110> a<00:07:01.169> game<00:07:01.379> that<00:07:02.090> they<00:07:03.090> wanted<00:07:03.389> to

00:07:03.439 --> 00:07:03.449 
impression in a game that they wanted to

00:07:03.449 --> 00:07:04.909 
impression in a game that they wanted to
make<00:07:03.509> a<00:07:03.569> game<00:07:03.810> they<00:07:03.960> had<00:07:04.080> cool<00:07:04.319> gameplay<00:07:04.590> ideas

00:07:04.909 --> 00:07:04.919 
make a game they had cool gameplay ideas

00:07:04.919 --> 00:07:07.279 
make a game they had cool gameplay ideas
and<00:07:05.430> they<00:07:06.090> designed<00:07:06.389> a<00:07:06.539> story<00:07:06.780> in<00:07:06.960> order<00:07:07.169> to

00:07:07.279 --> 00:07:07.289 
and they designed a story in order to

00:07:07.289 --> 00:07:09.830 
and they designed a story in order to
use<00:07:07.590> them<00:07:07.800> and<00:07:08.280> that's<00:07:08.490> fine<00:07:09.060> there's<00:07:09.509> nothing

00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:09.840 
use them and that's fine there's nothing

00:07:09.840 --> 00:07:11.059 
use them and that's fine there's nothing
wrong<00:07:09.990> with<00:07:10.169> that<00:07:10.319> but<00:07:10.770> in<00:07:10.860> this<00:07:10.919> particular

00:07:11.059 --> 00:07:11.069 
wrong with that but in this particular

00:07:11.069 --> 00:07:14.029 
wrong with that but in this particular
instance<00:07:12.080> this<00:07:13.080> wouldn't<00:07:13.440> be<00:07:13.530> as<00:07:13.740> effective

00:07:14.029 --> 00:07:14.039 
instance this wouldn't be as effective

00:07:14.039 --> 00:07:16.219 
instance this wouldn't be as effective
as<00:07:14.310> a<00:07:14.340> movie<00:07:14.669> this<00:07:15.330> wouldn't<00:07:15.690> be<00:07:15.750> as<00:07:15.960> effective

00:07:16.219 --> 00:07:16.229 
as a movie this wouldn't be as effective

00:07:16.229 --> 00:07:19.100 
as a movie this wouldn't be as effective
as<00:07:16.530> a<00:07:16.560> book<00:07:16.860> because<00:07:17.789> there<00:07:18.150> is<00:07:18.360> that<00:07:18.599> level<00:07:18.810> of

00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:19.110 
as a book because there is that level of

00:07:19.110 --> 00:07:21.110 
as a book because there is that level of
a<00:07:19.349> feeling<00:07:19.919> of<00:07:20.009> control<00:07:20.250> that<00:07:20.490> you<00:07:20.699> have<00:07:20.879> while

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:21.120 
a feeling of control that you have while

00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:23.270 
a feeling of control that you have while
you're<00:07:21.300> playing<00:07:21.419> the<00:07:21.659> game<00:07:21.690> and<00:07:21.990> it<00:07:22.919> takes

00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:23.280 
you're playing the game and it takes

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:25.749 
you're playing the game and it takes
that<00:07:23.490> away<00:07:23.550> from<00:07:23.819> you<00:07:24.180> in<00:07:24.419> this<00:07:24.719> scene<00:07:25.020> and

00:07:25.749 --> 00:07:25.759 
that away from you in this scene and

00:07:25.759 --> 00:07:30.469 
that away from you in this scene and
that<00:07:26.759> just<00:07:26.969> simply<00:07:27.210> would<00:07:27.719> not<00:07:27.750> be<00:07:28.379> as<00:07:29.479> immense

00:07:30.469 --> 00:07:30.479 
that just simply would not be as immense

00:07:30.479 --> 00:07:35.390 
that just simply would not be as immense
feeling<00:07:30.810> as<00:07:32.360> hopeless<00:07:33.360> and<00:07:33.569> helpless<00:07:33.630> if<00:07:34.409> you

00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:35.400 
feeling as hopeless and helpless if you

00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:37.969 
feeling as hopeless and helpless if you
had<00:07:35.550> just<00:07:35.639> been<00:07:35.819> watching<00:07:35.940> a<00:07:36.240> movie<00:07:36.979> that's

00:07:37.969 --> 00:07:37.979 
had just been watching a movie that's

had just been watching a movie that's
why<00:07:38.219> I<00:07:38.250> think<00:07:38.880> Bioshock<00:07:39.300> is<00:07:39.509> one<00:07:39.750> of<00:07:39.840> the<00:07:39.900> great

00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:40.080 
why I think Bioshock is one of the great

00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:44.719 
why I think Bioshock is one of the great
examples<00:07:40.529> of<00:07:40.880> games<00:07:41.880> as<00:07:42.150> an<00:07:42.300> art<00:07:42.479> form
