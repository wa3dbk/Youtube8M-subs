00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:24.980 
tangles and you want to smooth the hair

00:02:24.980 --> 00:02:27.490 
tangles and you want to smooth the hair
down<00:02:25.360> this<00:02:26.360> is<00:02:26.540> going<00:02:26.630> to<00:02:26.750> make<00:02:26.930> it<00:02:27.110> easier

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:27.500 
down this is going to make it easier

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.140 
down this is going to make it easier
when<00:02:27.710> you<00:02:27.830> bring<00:02:28.100> the<00:02:28.250> two<00:02:28.490> together<00:02:28.670> at<00:02:29.060> the

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:29.150 
when you bring the two together at the

00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:32.900 
when you bring the two together at the
back

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:32.910 

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:34.750 

so<00:02:33.390> you<00:02:33.480> don't<00:02:33.690> pick<00:02:33.900> up<00:02:34.020> any<00:02:34.200> stray<00:02:34.620> hairs

00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:34.760 
so you don't pick up any stray hairs

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.500 
so you don't pick up any stray hairs
because<00:02:35.760> that's<00:02:35.880> going<00:02:35.970> to<00:02:36.030> make<00:02:36.120> it<00:02:36.360> a<00:02:36.390> lot

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:36.510 
because that's going to make it a lot

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:40.130 
because that's going to make it a lot
more<00:02:36.690> difficult<00:02:37.260> when<00:02:37.590> you<00:02:38.490> have<00:02:38.670> into<00:02:38.970> it

00:02:40.130 --> 00:02:40.140 
more difficult when you have into it

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:43.700 
more difficult when you have into it
through<00:02:40.970> afterwards<00:02:42.110> so<00:02:43.110> really<00:02:43.500> make<00:02:43.680> sure

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:43.710 
through afterwards so really make sure

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:45.860 
through afterwards so really make sure
that<00:02:43.980> it's<00:02:44.160> just<00:02:44.730> them<00:02:44.970> two<00:02:45.210> pieces<00:02:45.690> that

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:45.870 
that it's just them two pieces that

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:47.480 
that it's just them two pieces that
you're<00:02:45.990> attaching<00:02:46.320> together<00:02:46.770> don't<00:02:47.040> be<00:02:47.310> got

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:47.490 
you're attaching together don't be got

you're attaching together don't be got
any<00:02:47.760> small<00:02:48.330> that<00:02:48.990> they<00:02:49.230> can<00:02:49.440> be<00:02:49.560> quite<00:02:49.740> tough

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:50.070 
any small that they can be quite tough

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:52.820 
any small that they can be quite tough
at<00:02:50.460> times<00:02:50.490> and<00:02:51.480> if<00:02:51.960> you've<00:02:52.170> sort<00:02:52.470> of<00:02:52.530> dumped

00:03:18.020 --> 00:03:20.790 

then<00:03:18.590> you<00:03:18.710> want<00:03:18.860> to<00:03:18.920> take<00:03:19.100> a<00:03:19.310> small<00:03:19.460> section

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:20.800 
then you want to take a small section

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:26.070 
then you want to take a small section
just<00:03:21.800> over<00:03:22.040> a<00:03:22.190> centimeter<00:03:22.820> I'd<00:03:22.910> say

00:03:26.070 --> 00:03:26.080 

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:28.770 

and<00:03:26.350> just<00:03:26.950> pull<00:03:27.400> that<00:03:27.430> through<00:03:28.090> with<00:03:28.660> the

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:28.780 
and just pull that through with the

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:31.410 
and just pull that through with the
other<00:03:28.960> side<00:03:29.440> of<00:03:29.800> this<00:03:30.040> sort<00:03:30.820> of<00:03:30.850> make<00:03:31.120> do

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:31.420 
other side of this sort of make do

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:34.570 
other side of this sort of make do
hairband<00:03:31.960> that<00:03:32.140> we've<00:03:32.290> made

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:34.580 

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:44.330 

so<00:03:35.580> you<00:03:35.700> should<00:03:35.910> create<00:03:36.210> as<00:03:36.420> little<00:03:36.450> loop

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:46.790 

and<00:03:44.850> continue<00:03:45.360> doing<00:03:45.569> this<00:03:45.870> alone<00:03:46.200> all<00:03:46.530> the

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:46.800 
and continue doing this alone all the

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:50.180 
and continue doing this alone all the
way<00:03:47.930> so<00:03:48.930> you<00:03:48.990> have<00:03:49.200> no<00:03:49.380> more<00:03:49.590> hair<00:03:49.770> left<00:03:50.040> to

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:50.190 
way so you have no more hair left to

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:58.070 
way so you have no more hair left to
pour<00:03:50.400> through<00:03:56.330> this<00:03:57.330> will<00:03:57.630> be<00:03:57.810> slightly

00:03:58.070 --> 00:03:58.080 
pour through this will be slightly

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:00.050 
pour through this will be slightly
different<00:03:58.200> for<00:03:58.620> everyone<00:03:59.010> depending<00:03:59.400> on<00:03:59.940> the

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
different for everyone depending on the

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:02.240 
different for everyone depending on the
length<00:04:00.209> of<00:04:00.450> your<00:04:00.600> hair<00:04:00.709> so<00:04:01.709> if<00:04:01.830> your<00:04:01.950> hair<00:04:02.040> is

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.250 
length of your hair so if your hair is

00:04:02.250 --> 00:04:04.640 
length of your hair so if your hair is
quite<00:04:02.489> short<00:04:02.760> as<00:04:03.060> soon<00:04:03.360> as<00:04:03.510> you<00:04:03.630> twist<00:04:03.900> it<00:04:04.230> to

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:04.650 
quite short as soon as you twist it to

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:06.710 
quite short as soon as you twist it to
pull<00:04:05.160> it<00:04:05.280> through<00:04:05.550> you<00:04:06.090> might<00:04:06.239> want<00:04:06.450> to<00:04:06.510> attach

00:04:06.710 --> 00:04:06.720 
pull it through you might want to attach

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.660 
pull it through you might want to attach
it<00:04:06.930> with<00:04:06.959> a<00:04:07.050> pin<00:04:07.290> straight<00:04:07.650> away<00:04:07.890> case<00:04:08.520> it

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:08.670 
it with a pin straight away case it

00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:13.440 
it with a pin straight away case it
falls<00:04:08.850> straight<00:04:09.180> back<00:04:09.510> out<00:04:09.690> again

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:13.450 

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:17.159 

whereas<00:04:14.170> my<00:04:14.349> hair<00:04:14.590> is<00:04:14.650> quite<00:04:14.860> long<00:04:15.900> it<00:04:16.900> sort<00:04:17.139> of

00:04:17.159 --> 00:04:17.169 
whereas my hair is quite long it sort of

00:04:17.169 --> 00:04:19.560 
whereas my hair is quite long it sort of
makes<00:04:17.440> little<00:04:18.250> bumps<00:04:18.820> so<00:04:19.030> you<00:04:19.090> just<00:04:19.329> want<00:04:19.510> to

00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:19.570 
makes little bumps so you just want to

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:24.240 
makes little bumps so you just want to
twist<00:04:19.750> that<00:04:20.049> back<00:04:20.290> in<00:04:20.470> as<00:04:20.680> you<00:04:20.709> go<00:04:21.750> and<00:04:23.250> then

00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:24.250 
twist that back in as you go and then

00:04:24.250 --> 00:04:25.770 
twist that back in as you go and then
with<00:04:24.400> the<00:04:24.490> last<00:04:24.700> piece<00:04:25.030> that<00:04:25.300> can<00:04:25.450> be<00:04:25.570> quite

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:25.780 
with the last piece that can be quite

00:04:25.780 --> 00:04:28.800 
with the last piece that can be quite
tricky<00:04:26.080> so<00:04:26.919> I<00:04:26.950> like<00:04:27.250> to<00:04:27.300> twist<00:04:28.300> it<00:04:28.480> back<00:04:28.630> on

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:28.810 
tricky so I like to twist it back on

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:31.140 
tricky so I like to twist it back on
itself<00:04:29.139> and<00:04:29.410> tuck<00:04:29.800> it<00:04:29.979> under<00:04:30.340> again<00:04:30.729> so<00:04:31.000> it's

00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:31.150 
itself and tuck it under again so it's

00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:34.230 
itself and tuck it under again so it's
sort<00:04:31.389> of<00:04:31.450> spread<00:04:32.139> out<00:04:32.290> quite<00:04:32.470> a<00:04:32.680> me<00:04:32.919> and<00:04:33.760> then

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:34.240 
sort of spread out quite a me and then

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:37.320 
sort of spread out quite a me and then
you<00:04:34.389> can<00:04:34.570> position<00:04:35.020> it<00:04:35.290> around<00:04:36.000> so<00:04:37.000> the<00:04:37.120> shape

00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:37.330 
you can position it around so the shape
