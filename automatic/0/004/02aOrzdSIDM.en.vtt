you look here I had a bump to access the

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.560 
you look here I had a bump to access the
wiring<00:01:01.829> I<00:01:02.129> had<00:01:02.280> a<00:01:02.309> so<00:01:02.940> I<00:01:03.000> had<00:01:03.120> to<00:01:03.180> pull<00:01:03.420> out<00:01:03.449> via

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:05.570 
wiring I had a so I had to pull out via

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:09.980 
wiring I had a so I had to pull out via
front<00:01:06.570> left<00:01:06.810> speaker<00:01:08.420> and<00:01:09.420> that<00:01:09.570> just<00:01:09.810> there's

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:09.990 
front left speaker and that just there's

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:11.600 
front left speaker and that just there's
a<00:01:10.049> grate<00:01:10.380> that<00:01:10.409> covers<00:01:10.979> that<00:01:11.130> you<00:01:11.340> just<00:01:11.520> have

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:11.610 
a grate that covers that you just have

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:13.250 
a grate that covers that you just have
to<00:01:11.729> pop<00:01:11.970> out<00:01:12.180> there<00:01:12.390> a<00:01:12.420> few<00:01:12.479> tabs<00:01:12.840> that<00:01:12.960> you<00:01:13.080> pop

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:13.260 
to pop out there a few tabs that you pop

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.230 
to pop out there a few tabs that you pop
out<00:01:13.470> and<00:01:13.740> then<00:01:14.159> this<00:01:14.250> is<00:01:14.430> held<00:01:14.640> in<00:01:14.790> with<00:01:14.820> four

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
out and then this is held in with four

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:16.789 
out and then this is held in with four
bolts<00:01:15.600> I<00:01:15.720> don't<00:01:15.869> remember<00:01:15.990> what<00:01:16.290> size<00:01:16.530> they

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
bolts I don't remember what size they

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.429 
bolts I don't remember what size they
are<00:01:16.830> and<00:01:17.130> so<00:01:18.060> I<00:01:18.119> just<00:01:18.330> pull<00:01:18.780> that<00:01:18.810> out<00:01:18.990> and<00:01:19.229> set

00:01:19.429 --> 00:01:19.439 
are and so I just pull that out and set

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:21.560 
are and so I just pull that out and set
it<00:01:19.470> off<00:01:19.650> to<00:01:19.680> the<00:01:19.860> side<00:01:20.189> I<00:01:20.460> need<00:01:20.850> a<00:01:21.000> new<00:01:21.150> speaker

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:21.570 
it off to the side I need a new speaker

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:24.670 
it off to the side I need a new speaker
by<00:01:21.720> the<00:01:21.780> way<00:01:21.960> and<00:01:22.350> it's<00:01:22.530> a<00:01:22.590> piece<00:01:22.770> of<00:01:22.799> garbage

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:24.680 
by the way and it's a piece of garbage

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:27.200 
by the way and it's a piece of garbage

finally if you look in here this is the

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.330 
finally if you look in here this is the
wiring<00:01:27.810> for<00:01:28.110> the<00:01:28.140> power<00:01:28.439> locks<00:01:28.799> and<00:01:29.070> for<00:01:29.250> my

what I had to do is I had to cut it in

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.359 
what I had to do is I had to cut it in
half<00:02:02.570> and<00:02:03.570> I<00:02:04.079> had<00:02:04.200> a<00:02:04.229> splice<00:02:04.590> my<00:02:04.829> wires<00:02:05.070> in

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:05.369 
half and I had a splice my wires in

00:02:05.369 --> 00:02:12.110 
half and I had a splice my wires in
there<00:02:06.649> so<00:02:07.649> in<00:02:07.799> the<00:02:07.890> case<00:02:08.129> of<00:02:08.399> this

00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:12.120 

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:18.810 

the<00:02:13.410> white<00:02:14.410> and<00:02:14.680> black<00:02:14.950> wire<00:02:17.430> which<00:02:18.430> is<00:02:18.460> right

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:18.820 
the white and black wire which is right

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:22.860 
the white and black wire which is right
here<00:02:20.880> this<00:02:21.880> is<00:02:21.940> the<00:02:22.060> white<00:02:22.300> and<00:02:22.330> black<00:02:22.570> wire

00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:22.870 
here this is the white and black wire

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:26.280 
here this is the white and black wire
from<00:02:23.170> the<00:02:23.550> keyless<00:02:24.550> entry<00:02:24.880> system<00:02:25.540> that

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:26.290 
from the keyless entry system that

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:28.890 
from the keyless entry system that
connects<00:02:26.880> to<00:02:27.880> the<00:02:28.000> side<00:02:28.270> of<00:02:28.450> the<00:02:28.570> blue<00:02:28.720> wire

00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:28.900 
connects to the side of the blue wire

00:02:28.900 --> 00:02:30.480 
connects to the side of the blue wire
that<00:02:29.110> comes<00:02:29.320> from<00:02:29.590> the<00:02:29.710> driver's<00:02:30.070> side<00:02:30.250> door

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:30.490 
that comes from the driver's side door

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:33.300 
that comes from the driver's side door
and<00:02:30.760> that<00:02:31.540> side<00:02:31.810> the<00:02:31.960> blue<00:02:32.140> wire<00:02:32.350> will<00:02:32.680> also<00:02:33.100> be

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:33.310 
and that side the blue wire will also be

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:36.800 
and that side the blue wire will also be
hot<00:02:33.610> when<00:02:34.180> the<00:02:34.360> lock<00:02:34.570> button<00:02:34.900> is<00:02:35.110> pushed<00:02:35.410> and

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:36.810 
hot when the lock button is pushed and

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:39.450 
hot when the lock button is pushed and
then<00:02:37.810> the<00:02:37.990> green<00:02:38.260> wire<00:02:38.530> goes<00:02:39.130> to<00:02:39.160> the<00:02:39.370> other

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:39.460 
then the green wire goes to the other

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:40.620 
then the green wire goes to the other
side<00:02:39.760> that's<00:02:39.880> what<00:02:40.060> heads<00:02:40.240> off<00:02:40.390> to<00:02:40.540> your

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:40.630 
side that's what heads off to your

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:43.860 
side that's what heads off to your
passenger<00:02:41.170> door<00:02:41.380> and<00:02:41.910> then<00:02:42.910> if<00:02:43.030> I<00:02:43.120> can<00:02:43.330> dig

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:43.870 
passenger door and then if I can dig

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:46.920 
passenger door and then if I can dig
that<00:02:43.930> out<00:02:44.290> of<00:02:44.440> here<00:02:44.560> in<00:02:45.130> my<00:02:45.340> case<00:02:45.720> it<00:02:46.720> was<00:02:46.780> a

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930 
that out of here in my case it was a

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:48.780 
that out of here in my case it was a
black<00:02:47.230> and<00:02:47.470> white<00:02:47.590> wire<00:02:47.860> that<00:02:48.130> originally<00:02:48.580> ran

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:48.790 
black and white wire that originally ran

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:54.950 
black and white wire that originally ran
through<00:02:49.000> here<00:02:49.120> for<00:02:49.300> the<00:02:49.420> unlock<00:02:49.840> circuit<00:02:52.020> and

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:54.960 
through here for the unlock circuit and

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:58.290 
through here for the unlock circuit and
the<00:02:55.960> brown<00:02:56.230> and<00:02:56.260> black<00:02:56.530> wire<00:02:57.190> goes<00:02:57.610> to<00:02:58.060> the

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:58.300 
the brown and black wire goes to the

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:04.950 
the brown and black wire goes to the
other<00:02:58.590> anti-mutant<00:03:00.090> there<00:03:01.090> is<00:03:03.690> it's<00:03:04.690> hard<00:03:04.900> to

00:03:04.950 --> 00:03:04.960 
other anti-mutant there is it's hard to

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:06.750 
other anti-mutant there is it's hard to
fish<00:03:05.230> out<00:03:05.440> here<00:03:05.470> there's<00:03:06.250> a<00:03:06.280> brown<00:03:06.490> and<00:03:06.640> black

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:06.760 
fish out here there's a brown and black

00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:08.670 
fish out here there's a brown and black
wire<00:03:07.030> from<00:03:07.240> the<00:03:07.330> Viper<00:03:07.630> that<00:03:07.960> goes<00:03:08.170> to<00:03:08.500> the

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
wire from the Viper that goes to the

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:12.090 
wire from the Viper that goes to the
again<00:03:09.250> that<00:03:09.690> this<00:03:10.690> end<00:03:11.020> of<00:03:11.350> the<00:03:11.590> black<00:03:11.860> and

00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:12.100 
again that this end of the black and

00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:14.310 
again that this end of the black and
white<00:03:12.250> wire<00:03:12.460> of<00:03:12.850> my<00:03:13.030> truck<00:03:13.360> will<00:03:13.780> be<00:03:13.900> hot<00:03:14.140> when

00:03:14.310 --> 00:03:14.320 
white wire of my truck will be hot when

00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:16.620 
white wire of my truck will be hot when
I<00:03:14.380> push<00:03:14.710> the<00:03:14.950> unlock<00:03:15.340> button<00:03:15.370> as<00:03:16.240> is<00:03:16.480> the

00:03:16.620 --> 00:03:16.630 
I push the unlock button as is the

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:19.680 
I push the unlock button as is the
unlock<00:03:16.960> circuit<00:03:17.410> so<00:03:18.370> the<00:03:18.490> red<00:03:18.700> and<00:03:18.910> black<00:03:19.420> from

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:19.690 
unlock circuit so the red and black from

00:03:19.690 --> 00:03:23.670 
unlock circuit so the red and black from
the<00:03:19.840> Viper<00:03:20.050> goes<00:03:20.350> to<00:03:20.530> that<00:03:22.050> and<00:03:23.050> then<00:03:23.410> this

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:23.680 
the Viper goes to that and then this

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:30.960 
the Viper goes to that and then this
what<00:03:24.280> was<00:03:24.430> this<00:03:24.550> blue<00:03:24.760> and<00:03:24.820> black<00:03:26.730> yeah<00:03:29.970> this

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:30.970 
what was this blue and black yeah this

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:33.060 
what was this blue and black yeah this
is<00:03:31.120> the<00:03:31.270> blue<00:03:31.480> and<00:03:31.510> black<00:03:31.780> this<00:03:32.530> is<00:03:32.680> again<00:03:32.950> the

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:33.070 
is the blue and black this is again the

00:03:33.070 --> 00:03:34.320 
is the blue and black this is again the
unlock<00:03:33.370> circuit<00:03:33.760> this<00:03:33.850> goes<00:03:34.090> to<00:03:34.240> the

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:34.330 
unlock circuit this goes to the

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:38.370 
unlock circuit this goes to the
passenger<00:03:34.870> side<00:03:35.170> of<00:03:35.410> that<00:03:36.280> wire<00:03:36.490> and<00:03:37.380> then

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:38.380 
passenger side of that wire and then

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:41.460 
passenger side of that wire and then
finally<00:03:38.890> I<00:03:39.100> had<00:03:39.940> a<00:03:39.970> splice<00:03:40.420> onto<00:03:40.930> the<00:03:41.080> orange

00:03:41.460 --> 00:03:41.470 
finally I had a splice onto the orange

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:43.710 
finally I had a splice onto the orange
wire<00:03:41.860> which<00:03:42.130> is<00:03:42.160> always<00:03:42.730> hot<00:03:42.970> so<00:03:43.300> don't<00:03:43.480> cut

00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:43.720 
wire which is always hot so don't cut

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:44.310 
wire which is always hot so don't cut
that<00:03:43.900> in<00:03:44.080> half

00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:44.320 
that in half

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:45.630 
that in half
don't<00:03:44.590> cut<00:03:44.770> the<00:03:44.800> orange<00:03:45.130> wire<00:03:45.280> in<00:03:45.460> half<00:03:45.580> just

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:45.640 
don't cut the orange wire in half just

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:49.430 
don't cut the orange wire in half just
splice<00:03:46.150> on<00:03:46.390> to<00:03:46.540> it<00:03:46.690> I<00:03:46.840> had<00:03:47.380> to<00:03:47.500> splice<00:03:47.830> the

00:03:49.430 --> 00:03:49.440 
splice on to it I had to splice the

00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:54.990 
splice on to it I had to splice the
black<00:03:50.440> and<00:03:50.680> purple<00:03:50.830> wire<00:03:51.720> onto<00:03:52.720> there<00:03:53.820> so<00:03:54.820> that

00:03:54.990 --> 00:03:55.000 
black and purple wire onto there so that

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.600 
black and purple wire onto there so that
way<00:03:55.120> that<00:03:55.270> gives<00:03:55.480> me<00:03:56.070> current<00:03:57.070> all<00:03:57.250> the<00:03:57.370> time

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:57.610 
way that gives me current all the time

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:01.380 
way that gives me current all the time
to<00:03:57.820> this<00:03:58.590> and<00:03:59.590> if<00:03:59.740> I<00:03:59.830> move<00:04:00.010> down<00:04:00.250> here<00:04:00.730> it's

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:01.390 
to this and if I move down here it's

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:04.050 
to this and if I move down here it's
going<00:04:01.540> to<00:04:01.600> be<00:04:01.690> kind<00:04:01.900> of<00:04:01.960> hard<00:04:02.080> to<00:04:02.200> see<00:04:03.060> the

00:04:04.050 --> 00:04:04.060 
going to be kind of hard to see the

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:06.030 
going to be kind of hard to see the
black<00:04:04.300> wire<00:04:04.600> you<00:04:05.080> just<00:04:05.290> need<00:04:05.470> a<00:04:05.500> good<00:04:05.710> ground

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:06.040 
black wire you just need a good ground

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.460 
black wire you just need a good ground
so<00:04:07.000> I<00:04:07.030> attached<00:04:07.510> it<00:04:07.720> to<00:04:07.750> a<00:04:07.900> bolt<00:04:08.170> on<00:04:08.320> my

00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:08.470 
so I attached it to a bolt on my

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:12.420 
so I attached it to a bolt on my
steering<00:04:08.860> column<00:04:09.250> and<00:04:10.920> then<00:04:11.920> this<00:04:12.100> is<00:04:12.250> your

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:12.430 
steering column and then this is your

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:15.600 
steering column and then this is your
positive<00:04:13.170> this<00:04:14.170> goes<00:04:14.410> right<00:04:14.680> and<00:04:14.830> I<00:04:15.100> just<00:04:15.190> tap

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:15.610 
positive this goes right and I just tap

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:18.210 
positive this goes right and I just tap
this<00:04:15.820> into<00:04:16.270> one<00:04:16.930> my<00:04:17.109> switches<00:04:17.590> because<00:04:17.799> it<00:04:18.040> has

00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:18.220 
this into one my switches because it has

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:21.110 
this into one my switches because it has
a<00:04:18.359> hot<00:04:19.359> positive<00:04:19.960> always<00:04:20.140> on

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:21.120 
a hot positive always on

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:23.480 
a hot positive always on
this<00:04:21.840> one<00:04:22.079> I<00:04:22.109> still<00:04:22.380> need<00:04:22.500> a<00:04:22.530> hook-up<00:04:22.919> this<00:04:23.340> is

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:23.490 
this one I still need a hook-up this is

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:26.409 
this one I still need a hook-up this is
yellow<00:04:23.699> this<00:04:23.940> goes<00:04:24.180> to<00:04:24.419> an<00:04:24.540> ignition<00:04:25.370> switched

00:04:26.409 --> 00:04:26.419 
yellow this goes to an ignition switched

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:30.830 
yellow this goes to an ignition switched
circuit<00:04:28.280> this<00:04:29.280> is<00:04:29.340> so<00:04:29.820> when<00:04:30.479> you<00:04:30.570> turn<00:04:30.720> on<00:04:30.780> the

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:30.840 
circuit this is so when you turn on the

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:32.420 
circuit this is so when you turn on the
ignition<00:04:31.050> it'll<00:04:31.440> lock<00:04:31.590> automatically<00:04:32.310> and

00:04:32.420 --> 00:04:32.430 
ignition it'll lock automatically and

00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:35.180 
ignition it'll lock automatically and
stuff<00:04:32.610> like<00:04:32.760> that<00:04:32.940> for<00:04:33.870> just<00:04:34.290> basic<00:04:34.470> lock<00:04:34.949> and

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:35.190 
stuff like that for just basic lock and

00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:36.469 
stuff like that for just basic lock and
unlock<00:04:35.220> though<00:04:35.610> you<00:04:35.760> don't<00:04:35.940> need<00:04:36.060> that<00:04:36.270> but

00:04:36.469 --> 00:04:36.479 
unlock though you don't need that but

00:04:36.479 --> 00:04:38.719 
unlock though you don't need that but
I'll<00:04:36.630> I'll<00:04:36.840> hook<00:04:37.050> that<00:04:37.110> up<00:04:37.290> later<00:04:37.680> but<00:04:38.610> it's

00:04:38.719 --> 00:04:38.729 
I'll I'll hook that up later but it's

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:40.670 
I'll I'll hook that up later but it's
getting<00:04:38.970> kind<00:04:39.150> of<00:04:39.210> laid<00:04:39.389> out<00:04:39.419> so<00:04:40.020> I<00:04:40.260> won't<00:04:40.530> do

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:40.680 
getting kind of laid out so I won't do

00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:44.900 
getting kind of laid out so I won't do
that<00:04:40.860> right<00:04:41.040> now<00:04:41.070> oh<00:04:42.199> and<00:04:43.199> also<00:04:43.410> I<00:04:44.070> almost

00:04:59.120 --> 00:04:59.130 
comes in real handy here I had to take

00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:03.800 
comes in real handy here I had to take
this<00:04:59.970> black<00:05:00.360> trim<00:05:01.199> panel<00:05:01.590> off<00:05:01.740> and<00:05:02.600> I<00:05:03.600> was

this black trim panel off and I was

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:06.170 
this black trim panel off and I was
looking<00:05:04.080> for<00:05:04.199> my<00:05:04.320> parking<00:05:04.710> light<00:05:04.860> wire<00:05:05.070> in<00:05:05.340> my

00:05:06.170 --> 00:05:06.180 
looking for my parking light wire in my

00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:08.300 
looking for my parking light wire in my
case<00:05:06.479> on<00:05:06.720> my<00:05:06.870> truck<00:05:07.199> it's<00:05:07.410> brown<00:05:07.770> and<00:05:08.100> it<00:05:08.160> goes

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:08.310 
case on my truck it's brown and it goes

00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:11.150 
case on my truck it's brown and it goes
right<00:05:08.490> to<00:05:08.550> the<00:05:08.789> switch<00:05:09.090> on<00:05:09.389> the<00:05:09.960> other<00:05:10.080> side<00:05:10.380> so

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:11.160 
right to the switch on the other side so

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:12.800 
right to the switch on the other side so
again<00:05:11.190> I<00:05:11.430> had<00:05:11.669> to<00:05:11.699> take<00:05:12.060> this<00:05:12.270> white<00:05:12.570> wire

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:12.810 
again I had to take this white wire

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:15.170 
again I had to take this white wire
which<00:05:13.590> is<00:05:13.740> my<00:05:13.889> parking<00:05:14.370> light<00:05:14.550> output<00:05:14.940> from

00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:15.180 
which is my parking light output from

00:05:15.180 --> 00:05:17.960 
which is my parking light output from
the<00:05:15.470> keyless<00:05:16.470> entry<00:05:16.770> module<00:05:17.220> and<00:05:17.430> I<00:05:17.820> had<00:05:17.940> a

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:17.970 
the keyless entry module and I had a

00:05:17.970 --> 00:05:20.570 
the keyless entry module and I had a
splice<00:05:18.389> it<00:05:18.660> in<00:05:18.810> I<00:05:19.080> had<00:05:20.070> to<00:05:20.160> run<00:05:20.340> it<00:05:20.430> up<00:05:20.550> through

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:20.580 
splice it in I had to run it up through

00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:22.189 
splice it in I had to run it up through
here<00:05:20.940> and<00:05:21.060> I<00:05:21.150> had<00:05:21.270> to<00:05:21.300> splice<00:05:21.630> it<00:05:21.840> into<00:05:21.930> the

00:05:22.189 --> 00:05:22.199 
here and I had to splice it into the

00:05:22.199 --> 00:05:25.820 
here and I had to splice it into the
brown<00:05:22.410> wire<00:05:22.620> here<00:05:23.190> so<00:05:24.000> now<00:05:24.210> oh<00:05:24.530> I<00:05:25.530> missed

00:05:25.820 --> 00:05:25.830 
brown wire here so now oh I missed

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:28.580 
brown wire here so now oh I missed
something<00:05:26.070> too<00:05:26.510> if<00:05:27.510> I<00:05:27.750> can<00:05:27.930> find<00:05:28.080> it<00:05:28.289> here<00:05:28.349> it

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:28.590 
something too if I can find it here it

00:05:28.590 --> 00:05:28.850 
something too if I can find it here it
is

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:28.860 
is

00:05:28.860 --> 00:05:32.360 
is
and<00:05:29.000> then<00:05:30.000> this<00:05:30.740> island<00:05:31.740> they<00:05:31.860> call<00:05:32.070> it<00:05:32.190> red

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:32.370 
and then this island they call it red

00:05:32.370 --> 00:05:33.680 
and then this island they call it red
but<00:05:32.490> I<00:05:32.580> think<00:05:32.789> it<00:05:32.880> looks<00:05:33.030> more<00:05:33.180> brownish

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:33.690 
but I think it looks more brownish

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:37.159 
but I think it looks more brownish
tannish<00:05:34.220> this<00:05:35.220> is<00:05:35.370> your<00:05:35.490> horn<00:05:35.700> output<00:05:36.150> this<00:05:36.810> in

00:05:37.159 --> 00:05:37.169 
tannish this is your horn output this in

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:40.279 
tannish this is your horn output this in
my<00:05:37.530> case<00:05:37.740> again<00:05:38.099> the<00:05:39.000> schematic<00:05:39.570> and<00:05:39.810> wiring

00:05:40.279 --> 00:05:40.289 
my case again the schematic and wiring

00:05:40.289 --> 00:05:42.950 
my case again the schematic and wiring
information<00:05:40.800> helps<00:05:41.099> my<00:05:41.820> case<00:05:42.090> the<00:05:42.389> horn<00:05:42.630> is

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:42.960 
information helps my case the horn is

00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:46.520 
information helps my case the horn is
negative<00:05:43.740> the<00:05:44.660> wire<00:05:45.660> is<00:05:45.840> negative<00:05:46.289> from<00:05:46.440> the

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:46.530 
negative the wire is negative from the

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:50.120 
negative the wire is negative from the
horn<00:05:46.800> right<00:05:47.190> there<00:05:47.460> and<00:05:48.830> so<00:05:49.830> you<00:05:49.889> need<00:05:50.099> a

00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:50.130 
horn right there and so you need a

00:05:50.130 --> 00:05:53.290 
horn right there and so you need a
negative<00:05:50.340> pulse<00:05:50.699> to<00:05:51.289> set<00:05:52.289> off<00:05:52.410> the<00:05:52.440> horn<00:05:52.860> so<00:05:53.130> I

00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:53.300 
negative pulse to set off the horn so I

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:55.820 
negative pulse to set off the horn so I
splice<00:05:54.300> that<00:05:54.330> onto<00:05:54.930> the<00:05:55.020> horn<00:05:55.199> wire<00:05:55.410> right<00:05:55.680> in

00:05:55.820 --> 00:05:55.830 
splice that onto the horn wire right in

00:05:55.830 --> 00:06:00.230 
splice that onto the horn wire right in
there<00:05:56.010> a<00:05:57.620> horn<00:05:58.620> on<00:05:58.919> this<00:05:59.430> for<00:05:59.639> some<00:05:59.820> reason<00:05:59.849> I

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:00.240 
there a horn on this for some reason I

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:01.550 
there a horn on this for some reason I
think<00:06:00.449> it's<00:06:00.570> how<00:06:00.660> its<00:06:00.780> programmed<00:06:00.990> I<00:06:01.320> need<00:06:01.470> to

00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:01.560 
think it's how its programmed I need to

00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:03.710 
think it's how its programmed I need to
experiment<00:06:01.979> with<00:06:02.220> a<00:06:02.250> little<00:06:02.490> bit<00:06:02.760> her<00:06:03.510> horn

00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:03.720 
experiment with a little bit her horn

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:05.120 
experiment with a little bit her horn
doesn't<00:06:03.870> go<00:06:04.169> off<00:06:04.260> when<00:06:04.440> I<00:06:04.470> lock<00:06:04.710> it<00:06:04.889> but<00:06:04.979> when<00:06:05.070> I

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:05.130 
doesn't go off when I lock it but when I

00:06:05.130 --> 00:06:08.510 
doesn't go off when I lock it but when I
hit<00:06:05.220> the<00:06:05.370> panic<00:06:05.580> button<00:06:05.699> it<00:06:06.030> goes<00:06:06.180> off<00:06:07.520> so

00:06:08.510 --> 00:06:08.520 
hit the panic button it goes off so

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:14.439 
hit the panic button it goes off so
there's<00:06:08.729> the<00:06:09.500> remote<00:06:10.820> and<00:06:11.820> I<00:06:11.970> will<00:06:12.150> lock<00:06:12.330> it

00:06:14.439 --> 00:06:14.449 
there's the remote and I will lock it

00:06:14.449 --> 00:06:17.640 
there's the remote and I will lock it
and<00:06:15.449> then<00:06:15.570> if<00:06:15.690> i<00:06:15.780> unlock<00:06:15.930> it

00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:17.650 
and then if i unlock it

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:29.320 
and then if i unlock it
and<00:06:18.650> then<00:06:19.460> panic<00:06:25.570> so<00:06:26.570> it<00:06:26.690> all<00:06:26.780> works<00:06:28.330> that's

00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:29.330 
and then panic so it all works that's

00:06:29.330 --> 00:06:34.629 
and then panic so it all works that's
how<00:06:29.449> I<00:06:29.509> wired<00:06:29.840> it<00:06:30.020> up<00:06:33.160> and<00:06:34.160> there<00:06:34.370> isn't<00:06:34.610> much

00:06:34.629 --> 00:06:34.639 
how I wired it up and there isn't much

00:06:34.639 --> 00:06:37.629 
how I wired it up and there isn't much
