more<00:00:15.809> spiders<00:00:16.320> or<00:00:16.890> actually<00:00:17.400> two<00:00:17.699> minimum

00:00:18.109 --> 00:00:18.119 
more spiders or actually two minimum

00:00:18.119 --> 00:00:20.720 
more spiders or actually two minimum
because<00:00:18.510> some<00:00:19.289> of<00:00:19.320> them<00:00:19.500> dropped<00:00:19.740> too<00:00:19.949> but

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:20.730 
because some of them dropped too but

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.210 
because some of them dropped too but
usually<00:00:21.090> you<00:00:21.180> don't<00:00:21.270> get<00:00:21.449> it<00:00:21.539> twice<00:00:21.720> in<00:00:21.900> a<00:00:21.960> row

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:22.220 
usually you don't get it twice in a row

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:24.080 
usually you don't get it twice in a row
so<00:00:23.220> there<00:00:23.789> we<00:00:23.910> go

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.090 
so there we go

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:28.900 
so there we go
it<00:00:24.480> got<00:00:24.720> to<00:00:25.199> run<00:00:25.470> my<00:00:25.619> first<00:00:25.830> try<00:00:26.070> so<00:00:27.769> anyway

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:28.910 
it got to run my first try so anyway

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:31.880 
it got to run my first try so anyway
getting<00:00:29.910> a<00:00:30.090> string<00:00:30.420> is<00:00:30.720> more<00:00:31.289> difficult<00:00:31.529> than

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:31.890 
getting a string is more difficult than

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.069 
getting a string is more difficult than
one<00:00:32.309> might<00:00:32.369> think

00:00:33.069 --> 00:00:33.079 
one might think

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:35.660 
one might think
because<00:00:34.079> if<00:00:34.410> it's<00:00:34.559> during<00:00:34.800> the<00:00:34.950> day<00:00:34.980> spiders

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:35.670 
because if it's during the day spiders

00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:36.920 
because if it's during the day spiders
don't<00:00:35.880> spawn<00:00:36.210> even<00:00:36.600> though<00:00:36.690> they<00:00:36.809> don't

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:36.930 
don't spawn even though they don't

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:39.619 
don't spawn even though they don't
despawn<00:00:37.680> or<00:00:37.950> get<00:00:38.399> hurt<00:00:38.640> in<00:00:38.850> the<00:00:39.180> light<00:00:39.390> like

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
despawn or get hurt in the light like

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:42.830 
despawn or get hurt in the light like

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:48.240 
here so also the way to make arrows home

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:50.539 
here so also the way to make arrows home
aids<00:01:48.479> you<00:01:48.689> killed<00:01:49.020> ducks<00:01:49.320> you<00:01:49.950> gather<00:01:50.250> sticks

00:01:50.539 --> 00:01:50.549 
aids you killed ducks you gather sticks

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:53.560 
aids you killed ducks you gather sticks
and<00:01:51.000> you<00:01:51.299> break<00:01:51.570> gravel<00:01:52.200> a<00:01:52.320> bunch<00:01:52.560> of<00:01:52.680> times

00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:53.570 
and you break gravel a bunch of times

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:56.319 
and you break gravel a bunch of times
well<00:01:54.570> I<00:01:54.630> mean<00:01:54.840> by<00:01:55.049> a<00:01:55.079> bunch<00:01:55.350> of<00:01:55.470> times<00:01:55.710> is<00:01:56.040> that

00:01:56.319 --> 00:01:56.329 
well I mean by a bunch of times is that

00:01:56.329 --> 00:01:59.090 
well I mean by a bunch of times is that
when<00:01:57.329> you<00:01:57.479> hit<00:01:57.810> gravel<00:01:58.320> you<00:01:58.469> have<00:01:58.680> a<00:01:58.710> certain

00:01:59.090 --> 00:01:59.100 
when you hit gravel you have a certain

00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:00.920 
when you hit gravel you have a certain
percentage<00:01:59.460> of<00:01:59.729> chance<00:02:00.000> of<00:02:00.270> getting<00:02:00.570> flint

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:00.930 
percentage of chance of getting flint

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:04.039 
percentage of chance of getting flint
from<00:02:01.170> it<00:02:01.909> for<00:02:02.909> example<00:02:03.390> I'm<00:02:03.509> just<00:02:03.540> gonna<00:02:03.810> get

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
from it for example I'm just gonna get

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:05.959 
from it for example I'm just gonna get
all<00:02:04.079> this<00:02:04.469> and<00:02:04.920> then<00:02:05.219> I<00:02:05.250> will<00:02:05.520> continue<00:02:05.640> to

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:05.969 
all this and then I will continue to

00:02:05.969 --> 00:02:10.609 
all this and then I will continue to
mine<00:02:06.270> out<00:02:06.540> of<00:02:06.600> a<00:02:06.840> tower

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619

00:03:07.009 --> 00:03:07.019 
the top slot to take fuel out and a not

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:09.289 
the top slot to take fuel out and a not
commonly<00:03:07.410> known<00:03:07.620> fact<00:03:07.920> is<00:03:08.129> to<00:03:08.340> make<00:03:08.549> cold<00:03:09.030> you

00:03:09.289 --> 00:03:09.299 
commonly known fact is to make cold you

00:03:09.299 --> 00:03:12.140 
commonly known fact is to make cold you
can<00:03:09.450> also<00:03:09.629> put<00:03:10.110> wood<00:03:10.379> in<00:03:10.530> the<00:03:10.650> bottom<00:03:11.010> and<00:03:11.940> i'll

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:12.150 
can also put wood in the bottom and i'll

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:14.449 
can also put wood in the bottom and i'll
put<00:03:12.480> wood<00:03:12.780> in<00:03:12.810> the<00:03:13.019> top<00:03:13.319> and<00:03:13.799> it<00:03:14.040> will<00:03:14.190> make<00:03:14.430> a

00:03:14.449 --> 00:03:14.459 
put wood in the top and it will make a

00:03:14.459 --> 00:03:20.479 
put wood in the top and it will make a
charcoal<00:03:17.000> so<00:03:18.000> i<00:03:18.319> guess<00:03:19.319> that's<00:03:19.739> really<00:03:20.100> it<00:03:20.310> for

00:03:20.479 --> 00:03:20.489 
charcoal so i guess that's really it for

00:03:20.489 --> 00:03:22.759 
charcoal so i guess that's really it for
this<00:03:20.579> video<00:03:20.760> i<00:03:21.209> showed<00:03:22.079> you<00:03:22.109> how<00:03:22.260> to<00:03:22.380> make<00:03:22.739> a
