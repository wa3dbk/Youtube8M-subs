00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.179
 so hi everyone from these clouds 

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:04.950
 of the vat you savor his interests 

00:00:03.179 --> 00:00:09.809
 carrying the course of very toys 

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:12.809
 faraway of two where the map is generated 

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:15.780
 if the world is different 

00:00:12.809 --> 00:00:17.820
 so I asked you the question I am 

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:22.050
 am deported to the court was giving 26 

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:25.560
 million 86 g bet 60 but I'm at 80 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:29.070
 m and 7 26 million and you will see 

00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.449
 that the world and magnifies them so 

00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:31.800
 we really start from a distance but we 

00:00:30.449 --> 00:00:34.860
 begins to know to venture into the 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.129
 game it surely I do not really 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.149
 saw the pictures adorned a lava flow 

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:41.640
 of the lava that evening that backstage at 

00:00:39.149 --> 00:00:42.930
 I do not really have it very rare 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:47.370
 that I can see it's in the game 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:48.899
 directly the lava lake that we can 

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:52.770
 see but it's going to be a few more 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:57.480
 very rare cases too and so the lava 

00:00:52.770 --> 00:01:02.300
 plus a cave with a lush t1 

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:05.400
 case a lot of flowers with a pack of 

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:06.780
 a package of packets of gravel planned 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.880
 marvel it can also coal 

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:10.290
 do not cause that is beautifully learned 

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:14.159
 a lot about a tuft is what you 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:17.400
 want second point it's a land 

00:01:14.159 --> 00:01:20.729
 which absolutely sublime I assure you the 

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:23.040
 d there is in this area a lot 

00:01:20.729 --> 00:01:26.670
 a lot of good at different up f3 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:30.060
 you have the desert biome you have 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:34.530
 the extreme biome hills and accurate 

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:37.290
 extreme x edge 2g precise little piano there 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:39.030
 I had never seen him I pass to saint 

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:41.790
 michel in any case you hasten the biome 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:45.600
 full so that the plain is all that 

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:47.930
 so I think the river you have the 

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.930
 desert 

00:01:50.900 --> 00:01:56.140
 as for once the river and the 

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:59.210
 ball there you go see there are 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:01.010
 desert he then he never really knows 

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:03.650
 get mad at the city translation 

00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:08.720
 but I think lille is extreme there 

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:10.490
 has surely say Comium and height 

00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:12.410
 that bio migrants how much is taking 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:16.480
 the magnitude in height of what I think 

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:20.380
 that's it secundo in this note 

00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:22.910
 after we will see the res peter below 

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:25.190
 sorry there is also the biome of the jungle 

00:02:22.910 --> 00:02:28.610
 kim favorite but I also think that I 

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:32.000
 biome of the sand is going to be well 

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:35.660
 prefer the ap also there the biome be 

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:39.230
 kibo marsh opium if that's where 

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:41.510
 a kraft habit and soup in 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.550
 advocating ram in order to escape from a grid 

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.980
 red pine cats 

00:02:42.550 --> 00:02:49.130
 there is good but there he also bout 

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:51.560
 there is a pegeen face in the desert 

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:52.100
 al bundy desert plus I was at 20h 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.720
 NPC 

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:57.290
 but no lives in fact it is not 

00:02:53.720 --> 00:03:00.260
 not targeted since it is filled with it the 

00:02:57.290 --> 00:03:03.800
 a lot of people and precisely thanks 

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:07.430
 to the penny you can pile of europe 

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:10.640
 you can buy things by a pl 

00:03:07.430 --> 00:03:13.519
 this one village villager gmp mjc a 

00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:19.670
 villagers in the game our moms date 

00:03:13.519 --> 00:03:21.860
 of the video game or a pnj if what I 

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:24.260
 could say that it's a man who 

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:26.540
 do not play it's someone with whom 

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:29.360
 you can interact like him it's a 

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:33.769
 looting our players it's someone who 

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:38.030
 do not play so you have to give him 

00:03:33.769 --> 00:03:38.890
 I do not care about wheat to have a 

00:03:38.030 --> 00:03:42.010
 emerald 

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:45.290
 but I will see if it works 

00:03:42.010 --> 00:03:46.580
 so if you'll see I 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:55.299
 try to do a little bit 

00:03:46.580 --> 00:03:58.190
 experience see if it works 

00:03:55.299 --> 00:04:01.790
 no it does not work it takes 18 to 

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:03.850
 get in emeralds here is elevated by 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:03.850
 example 

00:04:04.299 --> 00:04:11.060
 yes it's done so that's the fashion 

00:04:08.299 --> 00:04:13.190
 here he is eight at home you must him 

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:20.590
 give ten pieces of gravel more 

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:23.690
 year the rhode to have four flints 

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:27.440
 I do not know if it's worth it in any case 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:30.530
 the case of the canton sel selection of gravel 

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:31.639
 we have and I think a chance on 

00:04:30.530 --> 00:04:33.980
 ten weeks to a 

00:04:31.639 --> 00:04:37.580
 in any case he raid me in full 

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:39.560
 I do not know it can give her dress this 

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:43.400
 test 

00:04:39.560 --> 00:04:47.300
 abbas apparently do not like them 

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:52.010
 not money to a symbol then second 

00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:53.830
 in tercio I discovered a bug I 

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:56.660
 precise without special effects 

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:58.639
 you will see then I wanted to paste 

00:04:56.660 --> 00:05:01.400
 I wanted to connect two 

00:04:58.639 --> 00:05:02.139
 pistons chewing gum you'll see that 

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:04.730
 it is or not 

00:05:02.139 --> 00:05:08.139
 I repeat it is to realize without effects 

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:08.139
 Special ivory 

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:14.070
 the few stone shots I think that's 

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:14.070
 could do the same 

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:24.370
 that's it then the display does match 

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:24.970
 not to what should be it can 

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:28.630
 pass through 

00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:29.530
 so not even if we can not not in 

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:33.190
 done we can not get through 

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:37.630
 but the relationship between the piston have 

00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:42.430
 makes the buzz pistola the ugly wood 

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:47.940
 that we usually see here is 

00:05:42.430 --> 00:05:47.940
 what the fuck is what this delusion 

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:56.650
 oh what is this bug 

00:05:53.260 --> 00:06:02.500
 ah but it works saint lyÃ© 5 that one 

00:05:56.650 --> 00:06:05.770
 glue pistons while he is 

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:09.320
 horrible this bug is a horrible 

00:06:05.770 --> 00:06:10.790
 here is a yo happen anyway I you 

00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:12.560
 wish a good day have fun 

00:06:10.790 --> 00:06:17.930
 well here because it's a park that 

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:20.180
 begins kouadria any fourth case 

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:22.640
 handle went to the rio side but at 

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:25.580
 little fan came out 1.5.2 and I you 

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:27.500
 advise to put to download the 

00:06:25.580 --> 00:06:31.160
 1.5.2 point players leaving the bias 

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:33.500
 mauges years when he had a change to 

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:35.870

 the ain is a launcher so a return 

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:44.180
 of those points been in order to install at 

00:06:43.130 --> 00:06:47.000
 small fine and cleanly 

00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:50.030
 because I tried it does not work 

00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.440
 on the new launcher that's if you 

00:06:50.030 --> 00:06:53.030
 were sure to play with the fine ones 

00:06:51.440 --> 00:06:57.620
 at the official pc mar chili 

00:06:53.030 --> 00:06:59.360
 I read here in any case to deal soon 

00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:05.540
 10 minecraft and then go a little bit 

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:08.560
