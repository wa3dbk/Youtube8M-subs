00:01:33.609 --> 00:01:33.619 
class 5 hardpoints which if you've heard

00:01:33.619 --> 00:01:35.899 
class 5 hardpoints which if you've heard
recently<00:01:34.619> they<00:01:35.159> are<00:01:35.340> doing<00:01:35.520> away<00:01:35.729> with<00:01:35.759> the

00:01:35.899 --> 00:01:35.909 
recently they are doing away with the

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:37.190 
recently they are doing away with the
class<00:01:36.150> system<00:01:36.390> but<00:01:36.689> what<00:01:36.840> this<00:01:37.020> basically

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200 
class system but what this basically

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.010 
class system but what this basically
means<00:01:37.500> is<00:01:37.890> it's<00:01:38.729> a<00:01:38.880> turret<00:01:39.270> without<00:01:39.689> a<00:01:39.720> crew

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:40.020 
means is it's a turret without a crew

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:42.109 
means is it's a turret without a crew
member<00:01:40.200> in<00:01:40.500> it<00:01:40.650> and<00:01:40.829> the<00:01:41.400> classifieds<00:01:41.850> are

like<00:02:49.209> a<00:02:49.300> submarine<00:02:49.660> it<00:02:50.730> looks<00:02:51.730> like<00:02:51.850> there<00:02:52.239> was

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:52.390 
like a submarine it looks like there was

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:54.270 
like a submarine it looks like there was
a<00:02:52.450> time<00:02:52.780> when<00:02:52.810> they<00:02:53.200> considered<00:02:53.739> a<00:02:53.830> single

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:54.280 
a time when they considered a single

landing gear in the front and here was a

00:02:59.319 --> 00:03:02.280 
landing gear in the front and here was a
test<00:02:59.700> just<00:03:00.700> to<00:03:00.790> see<00:03:01.000> how<00:03:01.180> the<00:03:01.239> antennas<00:03:01.959> might

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:02.290 
test just to see how the antennas might

00:03:02.290 --> 00:03:05.690 
test just to see how the antennas might
work<00:03:02.560> or<00:03:03.489> how<00:03:03.670> they<00:03:03.850> might<00:03:04.000> look<00:03:04.269> now<00:03:05.110> here<00:03:05.380> are

00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:05.700
