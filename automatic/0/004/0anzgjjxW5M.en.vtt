think<00:04:22.410> the<00:04:22.740> a/c<00:04:22.950> unit<00:04:23.280> will<00:04:23.400> have<00:04:23.430> to<00:04:23.610> work

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:23.820 
think the a/c unit will have to work

00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:26.030 
think the a/c unit will have to work
very<00:04:23.850> hard<00:04:24.240> in<00:04:24.420> summers<00:04:24.780> to<00:04:24.900> make<00:04:25.170> sure<00:04:25.380> cool

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:26.040 
very hard in summers to make sure cool
