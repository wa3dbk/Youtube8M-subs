clay this has been renamed and recross
into<00:00:07.560> craft<00:00:07.950> clay<00:00:08.370> so<00:00:09.030> this<00:00:09.240> is<00:00:09.389> a

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:09.590 
into craft clay so this is a

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:12.049 
into craft clay so this is a
discontinued<00:00:10.590> product<00:00:10.980> but<00:00:11.250> it<00:00:11.340> is<00:00:11.490> the<00:00:11.730> same

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
discontinued product but it is the same

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:13.999 
discontinued product but it is the same
just<00:00:12.750> under<00:00:13.080> different<00:00:13.259> names<00:00:13.559> as<00:00:13.710> what<00:00:13.860> it

00:00:13.999 --> 00:00:14.009 
just under different names as what it

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:18.740 
just under different names as what it
looks<00:00:14.250> like<00:00:14.549> it's<00:00:15.360> a<00:00:15.859> sort<00:00:16.859> of<00:00:16.949> a<00:00:17.130> matte<00:00:17.750> gray

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:18.750 
looks like it's a sort of a matte gray

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:21.740 
looks like it's a sort of a matte gray
light<00:00:19.529> gray<00:00:19.560> clay<00:00:20.340> so<00:00:20.970> that's<00:00:21.150> roughly<00:00:21.390> what

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:21.750 
light gray clay so that's roughly what

00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:24.830 
light gray clay so that's roughly what
it<00:00:21.779> is<00:00:21.990> on<00:00:22.289> my<00:00:22.439> hand<00:00:22.910> do<00:00:23.910> on<00:00:24.090> how<00:00:24.269> much<00:00:24.420> hold<00:00:24.689> you

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820 
like this you can barely just see it but

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.459 
like this you can barely just see it but
you<00:00:32.910> can<00:00:32.940> see<00:00:33.239> a<00:00:33.270> sort<00:00:33.510> of<00:00:33.570> sheen<00:00:34.020> on<00:00:34.320> your

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719 
hair now usually I only use it when I've

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:43.280 
hair now usually I only use it when I've
cards<00:00:40.620> my<00:00:40.860> hair<00:00:41.129> or<00:00:42.000> styled<00:00:42.510> it<00:00:42.690> in<00:00:42.840> some<00:00:43.110> way

00:00:47.119 --> 00:00:47.129 
and I don't often style it straight if

00:00:47.129 --> 00:00:49.459 
and I don't often style it straight if
I'm<00:00:47.309> styling<00:00:47.789> it<00:00:47.910> because<00:00:48.360> what's<00:00:49.110> the<00:00:49.230> point

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469 
I'm styling it because what's the point

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.619 
I'm styling it because what's the point
in<00:00:49.649> that<00:00:49.860> if<00:00:50.129> I'm<00:00:50.309> chasing<00:00:50.550> my<00:00:50.879> hair<00:00:51.120> I<00:00:51.420> just

00:00:51.619 --> 00:00:51.629 
in that if I'm chasing my hair I just

00:00:51.629 --> 00:00:54.319 
in that if I'm chasing my hair I just
leave<00:00:52.110> it<00:00:52.289> straight<00:00:52.649> or<00:00:53.100> anything<00:00:53.309> and<00:00:53.640> maybe

00:00:54.319 --> 00:00:54.329 
leave it straight or anything and maybe

00:00:54.329 --> 00:00:56.299 
leave it straight or anything and maybe
put<00:00:54.570> some<00:00:54.750> twists<00:00:55.199> in<00:00:55.379> or<00:00:55.649> some<00:00:55.829> plats<00:00:56.100> or

00:00:56.299 --> 00:00:56.309 
put some twists in or some plats or

00:00:56.309 --> 00:00:57.860 
put some twists in or some plats or
anything<00:00:56.520> but<00:00:56.879> I<00:00:56.940> won't<00:00:57.149> need<00:00:57.390> to<00:00:57.449> use<00:00:57.600> the

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:57.870 
anything but I won't need to use the

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.660 
anything but I won't need to use the
clay<00:00:58.079> I<00:00:58.350> think<00:00:58.680> it's<00:00:58.890> a<00:00:59.010> really<00:00:59.250> great<00:00:59.370> claim

00:00:59.660 --> 00:00:59.670 
clay I think it's a really great claim

00:00:59.670 --> 00:01:02.270 
clay I think it's a really great claim
for<00:00:59.969> holding<00:01:00.449> curls<00:01:00.690> though<00:01:00.989> and<00:01:01.500> it's<00:01:02.010> really

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
for holding curls though and it's really

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:04.850 
for holding curls though and it's really
easy<00:01:02.370> to<00:01:02.789> use<00:01:03.329> and<00:01:03.359> just<00:01:03.930> scrunch<00:01:04.290> into<00:01:04.680> your

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:04.860 
easy to use and just scrunch into your

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:07.640 
easy to use and just scrunch into your
hair<00:01:05.070> and<00:01:05.820> as<00:01:06.600> you<00:01:06.780> can<00:01:06.930> see<00:01:06.990> it's<00:01:07.439> really

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:07.650 
hair and as you can see it's really

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:10.580 
hair and as you can see it's really
holding<00:01:08.159> my<00:01:08.340> curls<00:01:08.640> today<00:01:09.119> the<00:01:09.869> crude<00:01:10.380> play

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
holding my curls today the crude play

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:12.380 
holding my curls today the crude play
does<00:01:10.799> not<00:01:10.979> make<00:01:11.189> your<00:01:11.340> hair<00:01:11.520> crispy<00:01:11.970> it<00:01:12.119> makes

does not make your hair crispy it makes

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:14.480 
does not make your hair crispy it makes
it<00:01:12.540> really<00:01:12.810> soft<00:01:13.260> but<00:01:13.590> still<00:01:13.799> holds<00:01:14.159> the<00:01:14.310> curl

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:14.490 
it really soft but still holds the curl

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:18.109 
it really soft but still holds the curl
because<00:01:14.810> it's<00:01:15.810> not<00:01:16.290> a<00:01:16.320> heavy<00:01:16.740> clay<00:01:17.159> well

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119 
because it's not a heavy clay well

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:19.580 
because it's not a heavy clay well
depending<00:01:18.570> on<00:01:18.659> how<00:01:18.810> much<00:01:18.930> you<00:01:19.080> put<00:01:19.259> in<00:01:19.380> if<00:01:19.500> you

depending on how much you put in if you

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:20.870 
depending on how much you put in if you
put<00:01:19.770> on<00:01:19.890> the<00:01:19.979> right<00:01:20.400> amount

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:20.880 
put on the right amount

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.810 
put on the right amount
it's<00:01:21.330> really<00:01:21.780> light<00:01:22.020> on<00:01:22.530> your<00:01:22.770> hair<00:01:22.979> okay<00:01:23.759> so

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:23.820 
it's really light on your hair okay so

00:01:23.820 --> 00:01:25.760 
it's really light on your hair okay so
if<00:01:24.060> I<00:01:24.150> read<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:24.509> bottom<00:01:24.900> it<00:01:25.020> says<00:01:25.049> what<00:01:25.560> earth

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
if I read the bottom it says what earth

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.649 
if I read the bottom it says what earth
modelling<00:01:26.310> clay<00:01:26.490> for<00:01:26.759> her<00:01:26.880> create<00:01:27.360> shapes

00:01:27.649 --> 00:01:27.659 
modelling clay for her create shapes

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.050 
modelling clay for her create shapes
with<00:01:27.900> a<00:01:27.930> real<00:01:28.170> matte<00:01:28.439> finish<00:01:28.799> so<00:01:29.430> directions

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:30.060 
with a real matte finish so directions

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:32.120 
with a real matte finish so directions
or<00:01:30.390> dig<00:01:31.020> out<00:01:31.200> and<00:01:31.439> rub<00:01:31.590> between<00:01:31.920> hands

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:32.130 
or dig out and rub between hands

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:34.280 
or dig out and rub between hands
coherent<00:01:32.909> sculpt<00:01:33.210> away<00:01:33.390> or<00:01:33.659> rough<00:01:33.900> up<00:01:34.049> roots

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:34.290 
coherent sculpt away or rough up roots

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:36.380 
coherent sculpt away or rough up roots
for<00:01:34.470> thicker<00:01:34.650> texture<00:01:35.040> and<00:01:35.490> it's<00:01:36.000> got<00:01:36.119> a<00:01:36.150> grip

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390 
for thicker texture and it's got a grip

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.840 
for thicker texture and it's got a grip
factor<00:01:36.869> of<00:01:37.049> three<00:01:37.380> X's<00:01:37.890> so<00:01:38.340> that's<00:01:38.579> pretty

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:38.850 
factor of three X's so that's pretty

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.690 
factor of three X's so that's pretty
strong<00:01:39.180> hold<00:01:39.450> I<00:01:39.659> think<00:01:39.900> and<00:01:40.200> it<00:01:40.890> is<00:01:41.100> great<00:01:41.369> for

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:41.700 
strong hold I think and it is great for

00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:44.270 
strong hold I think and it is great for
giving<00:01:42.030> your<00:01:42.540> roots<00:01:42.840> over<00:01:43.140> the<00:01:43.500> wrists<00:01:43.829> if<00:01:44.100> you

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.280 
giving your roots over the wrists if you

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.010

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
expiry it sort of thing on this but I've

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:02.539 
expiry it sort of thing on this but I've
had<00:01:56.850> this<00:01:57.180> since<00:01:57.659> I<00:01:59.810> had<00:02:00.810> this<00:02:00.960> for<00:02:01.350> about<00:02:01.549> four

00:02:02.539 --> 00:02:02.549 
had this since I had this for about four

00:02:02.549 --> 00:02:03.620 
had this since I had this for about four
or<00:02:02.579> five<00:02:02.759> months<00:02:03.149> now

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:03.630 
or five months now

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:06.620 
or five months now
it's<00:02:03.960> been<00:02:04.229> fine<00:02:04.829> I<00:02:04.860> really<00:02:05.759> haven't<00:02:06.000> used<00:02:06.420> a

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:06.630 
it's been fine I really haven't used a

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:08.779 
it's been fine I really haven't used a
lot<00:02:06.840> if<00:02:07.140> you<00:02:07.380> see<00:02:07.649> here<00:02:07.950> around<00:02:08.340> the<00:02:08.459> edges

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789 
lot if you see here around the edges

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.750 
lot if you see here around the edges
this<00:02:09.000> is<00:02:09.060> just<00:02:09.390> from<00:02:09.509> where<00:02:09.720> I<00:02:10.250> put<00:02:11.250> my<00:02:11.400> fingers

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:11.760 
this is just from where I put my fingers

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.820 
this is just from where I put my fingers
in<00:02:11.910> but<00:02:12.390> I<00:02:12.420> think<00:02:12.660> I<00:02:12.810> really<00:02:13.110> started<00:02:13.500> with<00:02:13.680> it

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:13.830 
in but I think I really started with it

00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:16.339 
in but I think I really started with it
when<00:02:14.099> I<00:02:14.130> was<00:02:14.310> about<00:02:14.519> here<00:02:15.090> so<00:02:15.720> from<00:02:15.840> the<00:02:15.930> end<00:02:16.170> of

00:02:16.339 --> 00:02:16.349 
when I was about here so from the end of

00:02:16.349 --> 00:02:18.830 
when I was about here so from the end of
my<00:02:16.560> fingernail<00:02:17.069> you<00:02:17.400> can<00:02:17.849> see<00:02:18.060> that<00:02:18.300> I<00:02:18.630> really

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:18.840 
my fingernail you can see that I really

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.600 
my fingernail you can see that I really
haven't<00:02:19.410> used<00:02:19.800> that<00:02:19.950> much<00:02:20.190> because<00:02:20.400> I<00:02:20.580> don't

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:20.610 
haven't used that much because I don't

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.430 
haven't used that much because I don't
curl<00:02:21.000> my<00:02:21.209> hair<00:02:21.239> that<00:02:21.540> often<00:02:21.840> but<00:02:22.050> this<00:02:22.260> is<00:02:22.410> a

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:22.440 
curl my hair that often but this is a

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:25.460 
curl my hair that often but this is a
product<00:02:22.709> you<00:02:22.890> can<00:02:23.220> use<00:02:23.640> every<00:02:24.120> day<00:02:24.420> and<00:02:25.230> I

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:25.470 
product you can use every day and I

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:27.830 
product you can use every day and I
think<00:02:25.650> it<00:02:26.010> really<00:02:26.190> helps<00:02:26.610> with<00:02:26.760> curls<00:02:27.209> holding

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:27.840 
think it really helps with curls holding

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.780 
think it really helps with curls holding
through<00:02:28.620> the<00:02:28.800> night<00:02:28.980> as<00:02:29.130> well<00:02:29.280> and<00:02:29.519> do<00:02:29.640> your

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:29.790 
through the night as well and do your

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:31.759 
through the night as well and do your
hair<00:02:29.940> like<00:02:30.150> this<00:02:30.180> today<00:02:30.599> and<00:02:31.319> then<00:02:31.470> you<00:02:31.560> go<00:02:31.709> to

00:02:31.759 --> 00:02:31.769 
hair like this today and then you go to

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:33.589 
hair like this today and then you go to
sleep<00:02:32.069> when<00:02:32.370> you<00:02:32.489> wake<00:02:32.580> up<00:02:32.760> it<00:02:33.000> should<00:02:33.239> still

00:02:33.589 --> 00:02:33.599 
sleep when you wake up it should still

00:02:33.599 --> 00:02:36.020 
sleep when you wake up it should still
stay<00:02:33.840> intact<00:02:34.200> the<00:02:34.560> curl<00:02:34.769> so<00:02:35.130> in<00:02:35.459> this<00:02:35.670> you<00:02:35.880> get

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
stay intact the curl so in this you get

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:40.400 
stay intact the curl so in this you get
125<00:02:36.900> grams<00:02:37.260> of<00:02:37.530> product<00:02:37.769> and<00:02:38.930> that's<00:02:39.930> quite<00:02:40.380> a

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:40.410 
125 grams of product and that's quite a

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.410 
125 grams of product and that's quite a
lot<00:02:40.650> of<00:02:40.680> stuff<00:02:41.130> I<00:02:41.310> think<00:02:41.580> this<00:02:41.970> is<00:02:42.090> a<00:02:42.120> pretty

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
lot of stuff I think this is a pretty

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:45.470 
lot of stuff I think this is a pretty
unisex<00:02:43.080> product<00:02:43.590> as<00:02:43.739> well<00:02:43.920> so<00:02:44.250> guys<00:02:44.910> and<00:02:45.269> girls

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:47.810 
can use it I really like the packaging

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:50.270 
can use it I really like the packaging
the<00:02:48.810> way<00:02:48.959> it<00:02:49.019> is<00:02:49.260> I<00:02:49.470> think<00:02:49.680> it's<00:02:49.830> pretty<00:02:49.980> cool

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.280 
the way it is I think it's pretty cool

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.250 
the way it is I think it's pretty cool
and<00:02:50.519> I<00:02:50.580> like<00:02:50.790> the<00:02:50.970> fingerprints<00:02:51.690> that<00:02:51.870> are<00:02:52.019> all

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:52.260 
and I like the fingerprints that are all

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:55.520 
and I like the fingerprints that are all
over<00:02:52.590> the<00:02:53.390> packaging<00:02:54.390> as<00:02:54.540> well<00:02:54.569> it<00:02:55.319> really

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:55.530 
over the packaging as well it really

00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.199 
over the packaging as well it really
seats<00:02:55.980> it<00:02:56.250> doesn't<00:02:56.670> look<00:02:56.790> like<00:02:56.819> a<00:02:56.970> go.you

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:57.209 
seats it doesn't look like a go.you

00:02:57.209 --> 00:02:59.210 
seats it doesn't look like a go.you
product<00:02:57.630> at<00:02:57.840> all<00:02:58.049> so<00:02:58.410> that's<00:02:58.709> pretty<00:02:58.980> good<00:02:59.160> for

00:02:59.210 --> 00:02:59.220 
product at all so that's pretty good for

00:03:04.150 --> 00:03:04.160 

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.860 

in<00:03:05.160> comparison<00:03:05.730> to<00:03:05.760> other<00:03:06.030> hair<00:03:06.329> clays<00:03:06.569> I

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:06.870 
in comparison to other hair clays I

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:09.890 
in comparison to other hair clays I
can't<00:03:07.470> tell<00:03:07.769> you<00:03:07.950> because<00:03:08.190> I<00:03:08.760> really<00:03:09.720> don't

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:09.900 
can't tell you because I really don't

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:15.319 
can't tell you because I really don't
know<00:03:10.109> I<00:03:11.660> mean<00:03:12.799> there<00:03:13.799> is<00:03:13.829> plays<00:03:14.700> such<00:03:15.150> as

00:03:15.319 --> 00:03:15.329 
know I mean there is plays such as

00:03:15.329 --> 00:03:19.879 
know I mean there is plays such as
Gatsby<00:03:15.600> which<00:03:16.530> is<00:03:16.829> a<00:03:17.160> very<00:03:17.670> Asian<00:03:17.970> clay<00:03:18.540> and<00:03:18.900> I

00:03:19.879 --> 00:03:19.889 
Gatsby which is a very Asian clay and I

00:03:19.889 --> 00:03:21.800 
Gatsby which is a very Asian clay and I
haven't<00:03:20.519> tried<00:03:20.700> that<00:03:20.730> but<00:03:21.060> I<00:03:21.120> know<00:03:21.299> my<00:03:21.450> cousins

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:21.810 
haven't tried that but I know my cousins

00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:23.599 
haven't tried that but I know my cousins
do<00:03:22.019> I<00:03:22.260> know<00:03:22.440> they're<00:03:22.709> pretty<00:03:22.829> brand<00:03:23.160> loyal<00:03:23.400> to

00:03:23.599 --> 00:03:23.609 
do I know they're pretty brand loyal to

00:03:23.609 --> 00:03:26.449 
do I know they're pretty brand loyal to
that<00:03:23.670> because<00:03:24.319> Gatsby's<00:03:25.319> Asian<00:03:25.889> and<00:03:26.190> they're

00:03:26.449 --> 00:03:26.459 
that because Gatsby's Asian and they're

00:03:26.459 --> 00:03:29.360 
that because Gatsby's Asian and they're
like<00:03:27.060> big<00:03:27.510> on<00:03:27.690> Asian<00:03:28.109> stuff<00:03:28.440> I<00:03:28.799> don't<00:03:29.100> really

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.370 
like big on Asian stuff I don't really

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:31.160 
like big on Asian stuff I don't really
mind<00:03:29.670> I<00:03:30.030> think<00:03:30.329> this<00:03:30.450> would<00:03:30.600> work<00:03:30.630> for<00:03:30.840> all

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:31.170 
mind I think this would work for all

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:34.190 
mind I think this would work for all
hair<00:03:31.470> types<00:03:31.500> as<00:03:31.950> well<00:03:32.069> not<00:03:32.519> just<00:03:32.549> Asian<00:03:33.209> hair

00:03:34.190 --> 00:03:34.200 
hair types as well not just Asian hair

00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:35.990 
hair types as well not just Asian hair
like<00:03:34.590> mine<00:03:34.859> I'm<00:03:35.310> trying<00:03:35.519> to<00:03:35.609> get<00:03:35.700> hold<00:03:35.910> of

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.000 
like mine I'm trying to get hold of

00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.360 
like mine I'm trying to get hold of

haven't been able to and it's been

00:03:42.269 --> 00:03:44.660 
haven't been able to and it's been
months<00:03:42.569> now<00:03:42.720> so<00:03:43.230> I<00:03:43.470> thought<00:03:43.859> I'd<00:03:44.010> quickly<00:03:44.280> do

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:44.670 
months now so I thought I'd quickly do

00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:46.910 
months now so I thought I'd quickly do
this<00:03:44.850> review<00:03:45.030> for<00:03:45.239> you<00:03:45.480> today<00:03:45.840> since<00:03:46.620> I<00:03:46.739> beat

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:46.920 
this review for you today since I beat

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:50.210 
this review for you today since I beat
stamp<00:03:47.250> I<00:03:47.430> purchased<00:03:48.120> this<00:03:48.299> on<00:03:48.600> eBay<00:03:49.200> because<00:03:50.010> I

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:50.220 
stamp I purchased this on eBay because I

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:51.949 
stamp I purchased this on eBay because I
wanted<00:03:50.700> it<00:03:50.819> to<00:03:50.970> come<00:03:51.150> fast

00:03:51.949 --> 00:03:51.959 
wanted it to come fast

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:53.660 
wanted it to come fast
and<00:03:52.170> I<00:03:52.290> purchased<00:03:52.500> this<00:03:52.769> from<00:03:52.980> a<00:03:53.069> UK<00:03:53.370> seller

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:53.670 
and I purchased this from a UK seller

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:55.250 
and I purchased this from a UK seller
rather<00:03:53.910> than<00:03:54.120> someone<00:03:54.420> from<00:03:54.540> abroad<00:03:54.690> so<00:03:55.200> it

00:03:55.250 --> 00:03:55.260 
rather than someone from abroad so it

00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.199 
rather than someone from abroad so it
would<00:03:55.380> come<00:03:55.620> quicker<00:03:55.980> and<00:03:56.340> sooner<00:03:56.819> and<00:03:57.030> the

00:03:57.199 --> 00:03:57.209 
would come quicker and sooner and the

00:03:57.209 --> 00:03:58.729 
would come quicker and sooner and the
shipping<00:03:57.510> charges<00:03:57.780> would<00:03:57.989> be<00:03:58.079> less<00:03:58.290> but<00:03:58.590> that

00:03:58.729 --> 00:03:58.739 
shipping charges would be less but that

00:03:58.739 --> 00:04:00.289 
shipping charges would be less but that
meant<00:03:58.980> that<00:03:59.040> I<00:03:59.190> had<00:03:59.370> to<00:03:59.489> pay<00:03:59.700> a<00:03:59.730> little<00:04:00.120> bit

00:04:00.289 --> 00:04:00.299 
meant that I had to pay a little bit

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:03.740 
meant that I had to pay a little bit
extra<00:04:00.630> so<00:04:01.349> I<00:04:01.739> think<00:04:01.829> I<00:04:02.069> paid<00:04:02.280> just<00:04:02.970> under<00:04:03.450> 20

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:03.750 
extra so I think I paid just under 20

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:05.930 
extra so I think I paid just under 20
pounds<00:04:03.959> of<00:04:04.290> this<00:04:04.500> which<00:04:05.160> is<00:04:05.190> quite<00:04:05.549> expensive

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:05.940 
pounds of this which is quite expensive

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:08.479 
pounds of this which is quite expensive
for<00:04:06.150> a<00:04:06.329> hair<00:04:06.569> product<00:04:07.010> but<00:04:08.010> I'm<00:04:08.130> sure<00:04:08.310> you

00:04:08.479 --> 00:04:08.489 
for a hair product but I'm sure you

00:04:08.489 --> 00:04:09.770 
for a hair product but I'm sure you
could<00:04:08.609> find<00:04:08.639> it<00:04:08.940> cheaper<00:04:09.359> if<00:04:09.510> you<00:04:09.540> won

00:04:09.770 --> 00:04:09.780 
could find it cheaper if you won

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:11.930 
could find it cheaper if you won
remember<00:04:10.410> that<00:04:10.590> I<00:04:10.650> got<00:04:10.799> craft<00:04:11.250> clay<00:04:11.609> not

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:11.940 
remember that I got craft clay not

00:04:11.940 --> 00:04:14.380 
remember that I got craft clay not
quickly<00:04:12.419> because<00:04:12.810> it's<00:04:12.959> not<00:04:13.109> critically<00:04:13.590> any

00:04:14.380 --> 00:04:14.390 
quickly because it's not critically any

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:15.610 
quickly because it's not critically any
I<00:04:14.420> don't<00:04:14.840> really<00:04:14.990> know<00:04:15.230> what<00:04:15.410> the<00:04:15.500> new

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:15.620 
I don't really know what the new

00:04:15.620 --> 00:04:19.449 
I don't really know what the new
packaging<00:04:16.040> about<00:04:16.280> is<00:04:16.430> like<00:04:16.640> either<00:04:16.850> but<00:04:18.459> this

00:04:19.449 --> 00:04:19.459 
packaging about is like either but this

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:21.300 
packaging about is like either but this
is<00:04:19.670> pretty<00:04:19.910> solid<00:04:20.150> but<00:04:20.510> it's<00:04:20.660> quite<00:04:20.959> squishy

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:21.310 
is pretty solid but it's quite squishy

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:26.470 
is pretty solid but it's quite squishy

and you'll be able to tease a lot easier
so<00:05:02.960> all<00:05:03.140> in<00:05:03.290> all<00:05:03.410> I<00:05:03.650> think<00:05:03.710> it's<00:05:04.100> a<00:05:04.190> really

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:04.400 
so all in all I think it's a really

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:06.580 
so all in all I think it's a really
great<00:05:04.580> product<00:05:04.940> but<00:05:05.720> as<00:05:05.900> I<00:05:06.050> said<00:05:06.110> I<00:05:06.260> haven't

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:06.590 
great product but as I said I haven't

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:08.890 
great product but as I said I haven't
tried<00:05:07.010> anything<00:05:07.280> else<00:05:07.610> so<00:05:07.850> this<00:05:08.390> is<00:05:08.540> just<00:05:08.750> my

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:08.900 
tried anything else so this is just my

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:11.260 
tried anything else so this is just my
opinion<00:05:08.990> of<00:05:09.410> it<00:05:09.500> compared<00:05:10.010> to<00:05:10.190> nothing<00:05:10.730> really

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:11.270 
opinion of it compared to nothing really

00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:13.090 
opinion of it compared to nothing really
but<00:05:11.900> it's<00:05:12.080> definitely<00:05:12.440> better<00:05:12.950> than

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:13.100 
but it's definitely better than

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:14.860 
but it's definitely better than
hairspray<00:05:13.610> if<00:05:13.760> you<00:05:13.850> don't<00:05:14.060> like<00:05:14.240> that<00:05:14.419> crispy

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:14.870 
hairspray if you don't like that crispy

00:05:14.870 --> 00:05:16.510 
hairspray if you don't like that crispy
feeling<00:05:15.110> anyway<00:05:15.710> so<00:05:15.770> I<00:05:15.950> hope<00:05:16.100> you<00:05:16.250> enjoyed

00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:16.520 
feeling anyway so I hope you enjoyed

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:19.480
