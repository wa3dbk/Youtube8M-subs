I<00:00:28.550> think<00:00:29.210> wedding<00:00:29.689> hair<00:00:29.900> should<00:00:30.230> be<00:00:30.260> as<00:00:30.890> simple

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:31.580 
I think wedding hair should be as simple

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:35.380 
I think wedding hair should be as simple
as<00:00:31.880> possible<00:00:32.650> because<00:00:33.650> no<00:00:34.190> matter<00:00:34.400> what<00:00:34.790> it's

as possible because no matter what it's
not<00:00:35.659> really<00:00:35.989> about<00:00:36.080> the<00:00:36.260> hair<00:00:36.589> it's<00:00:37.190> mainly

00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:37.550 
not really about the hair it's mainly

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:40.090 
not really about the hair it's mainly
about<00:00:37.729> the<00:00:37.940> tress<00:00:38.360> that's<00:00:38.960> gonna<00:00:39.170> overpower

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:40.100 
about the tress that's gonna overpower
