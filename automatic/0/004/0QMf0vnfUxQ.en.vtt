and a half and the other one but they're
both<00:00:50.190> good<00:00:50.610> sets<00:00:51.000> the<00:00:51.840> studio<00:00:52.320> set<00:00:52.710> was<00:00:52.890> really

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
both good sets the studio set was really

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:57.470 
both good sets the studio set was really
good<00:00:53.280> for<00:00:53.460> its<00:00:53.670> time<00:00:55.579> overall<00:00:56.579> I<00:00:56.879> have<00:00:57.120> to<00:00:57.149> say

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:57.480 
good for its time overall I have to say

00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.180 
good for its time overall I have to say
I<00:00:57.510> like<00:00:57.840> the<00:00:58.020> new<00:00:58.230> set<00:00:58.559> a<00:00:58.739> lot<00:00:59.129> better<00:00:59.719> but<00:01:01.190> you

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:02.190 
I like the new set a lot better but you

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:04.130 
I like the new set a lot better but you
can<00:01:02.340> see<00:01:02.579> obviously<00:01:02.820> it's<00:01:03.420> a<00:01:03.660> much<00:01:03.960> better

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
can see obviously it's a much better

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.230 
can see obviously it's a much better
built<00:01:04.949> set<00:01:05.309> but<00:01:06.000> 10<00:01:06.659> years<00:01:06.689> to<00:01:07.729> work<00:01:08.729> on<00:01:09.030> an

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:09.240 
built set but 10 years to work on an

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.039 
built set but 10 years to work on an
idea<00:01:09.420> for<00:01:10.020> it<00:01:10.700> you<00:01:11.700> know<00:01:11.820> I<00:01:11.850> expect<00:01:12.600> them<00:01:12.780> to<00:01:12.810> do

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049 
idea for it you know I expect them to do

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.590 
idea for it you know I expect them to do
a<00:01:13.080> lot<00:01:13.290> better<00:01:13.500> in<00:01:13.799> a<00:01:14.460> 10<00:01:14.790> year<00:01:15.000> period

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:15.600 
a lot better in a 10 year period

not<00:02:50.850> an<00:02:51.000> actor<00:02:51.480> so<00:02:52.080> I<00:02:52.110> think<00:02:52.410> they<00:02:52.650> did<00:02:52.680> a

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:53.070 
not an actor so I think they did a

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:55.490 
not an actor so I think they did a
really<00:02:53.520> good<00:02:53.760> job<00:02:53.820> making<00:02:54.390> the<00:02:54.810> headpiece<00:02:55.230> for

00:02:55.490 --> 00:02:55.500 
really good job making the headpiece for

00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:58.610 
really good job making the headpiece for
this<00:02:56.540> the<00:02:57.540> eyes<00:02:57.750> and<00:02:58.170> the<00:02:58.230> teeth<00:02:58.410> and

00:02:58.610 --> 00:02:58.620 
this the eyes and the teeth and

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:00.260 
this the eyes and the teeth and
everything<00:02:58.950> looked<00:02:59.190> really<00:02:59.250> good<00:02:59.790> in<00:03:00.000> my

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:00.270 
everything looked really good in my

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:04.520 
everything looked really good in my
opinion<00:03:00.570> and<00:03:01.400> also<00:03:02.400> the<00:03:02.850> hair<00:03:03.180> looks<00:03:03.870> good<00:03:04.200> I

00:03:04.520 --> 00:03:04.530 
opinion and also the hair looks good I

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:06.680 
opinion and also the hair looks good I
think<00:03:05.400> they<00:03:05.580> did<00:03:05.730> a<00:03:05.760> great<00:03:06.000> job<00:03:06.180> on<00:03:06.420> this

think they did a great job on this

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:09.410 
think they did a great job on this
figure<00:03:06.980> also<00:03:07.980> I<00:03:08.010> like<00:03:08.280> to<00:03:08.430> be<00:03:08.520> ripped<00:03:08.880> pants

and<00:03:09.570> all<00:03:09.660> very<00:03:10.650> very<00:03:10.860> cool<00:03:11.900> so<00:03:12.900> these<00:03:13.680> are<00:03:13.890> the

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:13.980 
and all very very cool so these are the

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.240 
and all very very cool so these are the
two<00:03:14.160> sets<00:03:14.640> as<00:03:15.630> you<00:03:16.140> can<00:03:16.290> see<00:03:16.440> the<00:03:16.920> sets<00:03:17.130> are

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:17.250 
two sets as you can see the sets are

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:19.820 
two sets as you can see the sets are
very<00:03:17.280> similar<00:03:17.730> they<00:03:18.090> each<00:03:18.269> have<00:03:18.570> a<00:03:18.840> tree<00:03:19.620> and

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:19.830 
very similar they each have a tree and

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:23.090 
very similar they each have a tree and
one<00:03:20.730> vehicle<00:03:21.090> so<00:03:22.080> these<00:03:22.230> are<00:03:22.410> the<00:03:22.590> two

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:23.100 
one vehicle so these are the two

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:25.550 
one vehicle so these are the two
vehicles<00:03:23.750> obviously<00:03:24.750> this<00:03:25.080> right<00:03:25.260> here<00:03:25.470> is

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:25.560 
vehicles obviously this right here is

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.430 
vehicles obviously this right here is
the<00:03:25.680> old<00:03:25.860> one<00:03:26.070> and<00:03:26.280> this<00:03:26.430> is<00:03:26.489> the<00:03:26.610> new<00:03:26.850> one<00:03:27.000> and

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:27.440 
the old one and this is the new one and

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:30.729 
the old one and this is the new one and
see<00:03:28.440> a<00:03:28.470> lot<00:03:28.769> more<00:03:28.800> detailing<00:03:29.459> on<00:03:29.730> the<00:03:29.850> new<00:03:30.000> one

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:30.739 
see a lot more detailing on the new one

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:34.070 
see a lot more detailing on the new one
also<00:03:31.739> I<00:03:32.130> like<00:03:32.790> the<00:03:32.970> color<00:03:33.330> on<00:03:33.600> the<00:03:33.750> new<00:03:33.900> one<00:03:34.050> a

00:03:34.070 --> 00:03:34.080 
also I like the color on the new one a

00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:37.100 
also I like the color on the new one a
lot<00:03:34.290> better<00:03:34.910> then<00:03:35.910> the<00:03:36.239> old<00:03:36.420> one<00:03:36.570> wasn't<00:03:36.810> bad

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:37.110 
lot better then the old one wasn't bad

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:43.580 
lot better then the old one wasn't bad
but<00:03:37.560> I<00:03:37.769> personally<00:03:38.280> liked<00:03:38.610> the<00:03:38.760> new<00:03:38.910> one<00:03:42.590> and

00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:43.590 
but I personally liked the new one and

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:47.240 
but I personally liked the new one and
so<00:03:43.830> those<00:03:44.640> are<00:03:44.670> the<00:03:44.910> vehicles<00:03:45.720> and<00:03:46.130> then<00:03:47.130> the

00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:47.250 
so those are the vehicles and then the

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:51.590 
so those are the vehicles and then the
tree<00:03:48.050> for<00:03:49.050> each<00:03:49.400> obviously<00:03:50.400> the<00:03:50.670> new<00:03:51.150> one<00:03:51.390> is<00:03:51.570> a

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:51.600 
tree for each obviously the new one is a

00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:54.949 
tree for each obviously the new one is a
lot<00:03:51.870> bigger<00:03:52.130> you<00:03:53.130> also<00:03:53.280> have<00:03:53.640> the<00:03:54.120> feature<00:03:54.570> on

00:03:54.949 --> 00:03:54.959 
lot bigger you also have the feature on

00:03:54.959 --> 00:03:58.970 
lot bigger you also have the feature on
there<00:03:55.230> where<00:03:55.920> the<00:03:56.790> werewolf<00:03:57.209> can<00:03:58.050> jump<00:03:58.739> out<00:03:58.920> of

00:03:58.970 --> 00:03:58.980 
there where the werewolf can jump out of

00:03:58.980 --> 00:04:01.370 
there where the werewolf can jump out of
the<00:03:59.250> tree<00:03:59.430> basically<00:03:59.700> and<00:04:00.209> it<00:04:00.959> makes<00:04:01.140> those

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:01.380 
the tree basically and it makes those

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:10.450 
the tree basically and it makes those
fall<00:04:01.890> down<00:04:02.100> like<00:04:02.400> that

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:10.460 

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:13.490 

you<00:04:11.460> can<00:04:11.580> see<00:04:11.730> that's<00:04:12.510> a<00:04:12.690> neat<00:04:13.020> little<00:04:13.170> feature

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:13.500 
you can see that's a neat little feature

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:17.420 
you can see that's a neat little feature
there<00:04:14.180> on<00:04:15.180> this<00:04:15.390> one<00:04:15.630> the<00:04:16.190> little<00:04:17.190> head<00:04:17.400> piece

00:04:17.420 --> 00:04:17.430 
there on this one the little head piece

00:04:17.430 --> 00:04:20.390 
there on this one the little head piece
here<00:04:18.150> piece<00:04:18.959> with<00:04:19.140> the<00:04:19.260> eyes<00:04:19.410> it<00:04:20.010> can<00:04:20.220> turn

00:04:20.390 --> 00:04:20.400 
here piece with the eyes it can turn

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:23.780 
here piece with the eyes it can turn
around<00:04:20.549> and<00:04:21.120> look<00:04:21.330> like<00:04:21.510> a<00:04:21.570> normal<00:04:21.959> tree<00:04:22.790> so

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:23.790 
around and look like a normal tree so

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:25.550 
around and look like a normal tree so
you<00:04:23.820> can<00:04:24.060> turn<00:04:24.210> it<00:04:24.390> that<00:04:24.510> way<00:04:24.570> or<00:04:24.990> that<00:04:25.200> way

00:04:25.550 --> 00:04:25.560 
you can turn it that way or that way

00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:27.890 
you can turn it that way or that way
and<00:04:25.680> you<00:04:26.400> can<00:04:26.520> also<00:04:26.640> make<00:04:26.910> the<00:04:27.000> tree<00:04:27.210> fall<00:04:27.480> when

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:27.900 
and you can also make the tree fall when

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:32.720 
and you can also make the tree fall when
you<00:04:27.990> pull<00:04:28.170> that<00:04:28.290> out<00:04:30.410> so<00:04:31.410> that<00:04:31.590> was<00:04:31.740> me<00:04:31.890> but

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:32.730 
you pull that out so that was me but

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:34.940 
you pull that out so that was me but
like<00:04:32.880> I<00:04:32.970> said<00:04:33.030> it<00:04:33.270> was<00:04:33.360> a<00:04:33.390> studio<00:04:33.780> set<00:04:34.140> so<00:04:34.470> it

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:34.950 
like I said it was a studio set so it

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:36.350 
like I said it was a studio set so it
was<00:04:35.070> kind<00:04:35.310> of<00:04:35.400> meant<00:04:35.610> to<00:04:35.880> have<00:04:36.030> a<00:04:36.060> little<00:04:36.300> bit

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:36.360 
was kind of meant to have a little bit

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:40.160 
was kind of meant to have a little bit
more<00:04:36.570> features<00:04:37.110> to<00:04:37.320> it<00:04:37.470> and<00:04:37.650> more<00:04:38.580> for<00:04:39.170> you

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:40.170 
more features to it and more for you

00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:42.200 
more features to it and more for you
know<00:04:40.290> kind<00:04:40.740> of<00:04:40.830> look<00:04:40.980> more<00:04:41.010> like<00:04:41.370> a<00:04:41.400> set<00:04:41.880> rather

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:42.210 
know kind of look more like a set rather

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:46.820 
know kind of look more like a set rather
than<00:04:42.450> real<00:04:42.930> trees<00:04:43.520> so<00:04:44.540> but<00:04:45.540> it<00:04:46.260> was<00:04:46.320> good<00:04:46.620> for

00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:46.830 
than real trees so but it was good for

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:48.830 
than real trees so but it was good for
its<00:04:46.980> time<00:04:47.190> like<00:04:47.460> I<00:04:47.580> said<00:04:47.610> a<00:04:47.970> 2002<00:04:48.570> set<00:04:48.810> I

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:48.840 
its time like I said a 2002 set I

00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:51.050 
its time like I said a 2002 set I
thought<00:04:49.110> it<00:04:49.200> was<00:04:49.320> really<00:04:49.440> good<00:04:49.680> but<00:04:50.460> the<00:04:50.880> new

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:51.060 
thought it was really good but the new
