real peddle e and so this course is a

nice change of pace you got let gravity
do<00:01:19.780> a<00:01:19.810> lot<00:01:19.930> of<00:01:19.960> the<00:01:20.080> works<00:01:22.679> it's<00:01:23.679> all<00:01:23.770> run<00:01:24.009> it<00:01:24.130> in

00:01:24.270 --> 00:01:24.280 
do a lot of the works it's all run it in

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.130 
do a lot of the works it's all run it in
and<00:01:24.460> everything<00:01:24.850> and<00:01:25.000> I<00:01:25.090> just<00:01:25.330> kept<00:01:25.539> taking

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:26.140 
and everything and I just kept taking

00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:27.510 
and everything and I just kept taking
out<00:01:26.409> some<00:01:26.590> of<00:01:26.649> the<00:01:26.710> dirt<00:01:26.890> there<00:01:27.070> was<00:01:27.159> a<00:01:27.189> huge

00:01:27.510 --> 00:01:27.520 
out some of the dirt there was a huge

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:30.870 
out some of the dirt there was a huge
hole<00:01:27.789> here<00:01:28.210> I<00:01:29.310> ended<00:01:30.310> up<00:01:30.369> filling<00:01:30.640> that<00:01:30.819> in
