00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:16.990
 another one of the important fertilizers in the 

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:19.840
 orchard are the obvious liquid fertilizers 

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:23.650
 prepared this prepared video is made 

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:25.770
 in an anaerobic process or where not 

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:29.490
 there is oxygen 

00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:31.520
 for that we need a 200 

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:35.660
 liters 

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:38.480
 that has its security seal its lid 

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:41.840
 and to which we are going to make a 

00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:44.420
 piercing where we're going to connect a 

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:47.780
 hose that will reach a bottle 

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:50.989
 which contains water this in order to 

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:53.239
 the gases that occur within 

00:00:50.989 --> 00:00:56.180
 this process by that anaerobic system 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:58.030
 where methane is produced by the 

00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:02.210
 decomposition of organic matter 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:04.610
 those gases come out through this bang and it 

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:06.380
 dissolve in the water 

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:08.479
 here we have a ready prepared saw 

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:12.020
 which is the one we are using here nest of 

00:01:08.479 --> 00:01:14.479
 eagles which was prepared in a 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:17.220
 200 liters marble in which 

00:01:14.479 --> 00:01:20.670
 we take a third 

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:23.880
 cow dung 

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:25.500
 we have put 200 grams of grams of 

00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:29.280
 ash 

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:33.240
 which helps to provide minerals to 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:36.420
 our mix we have put a liter 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:40.470
 of milk if we do not have milk can be 

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:43.800
 whey which you bring the 

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:46.250
 bacilli and the and the element or the environment 

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:50.070
 propitious for these microorganisms 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:53.220
 reproduce like molasses the 

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:57.899
 which we have thrown a kilo that helps 

00:01:53.220 --> 00:02:01.200
 the same as the milk to activate 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:04.020
 all this is this saw prepare after 

00:02:01.200 --> 00:02:06.810
 that we have these supplements inside 

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:10.310
 of the basket and fill it with water 

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:14.400
 around until we close it 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:16.950
 hermetically we seal him 

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:20.910
 We put your valve in order to make 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:23.880
 an anaerobic process and we leave it 45 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:27.450
 days so that fermente is like them 

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:30.510
 he said is already being used then this one 

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:32.220
 than stir it every day because 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:39.140
 how we talk 

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:39.140
 that cream is an amber color 

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:45.720
 of a fresh sweet smell 

00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:55.140
 having our mix ready 

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:59.010
 its application is given we make 20 liters 

00:02:55.140 --> 00:03:03.959
 in this 200-liter bin and the 

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:07.850
 We fill with 180 liters of water this 

00:03:03.959 --> 00:03:12.200
 allows to have a liquid fertilizer which 

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:17.569
 we use by gravity for our garden 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:22.640
 and we use it once a week both 

00:03:17.569 --> 00:03:22.640
 directly to the ground as if by spray 

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:28.660
 this is how eagles nest 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:31.770
 we do the biopreparations this is the saw 

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:35.920
 basic preparation that allows us 

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:38.640
 feed and nourish our soils and for 

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:43.450
 therefore we nourish our plants 

00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:46.990
 let's see right now how to make a given 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:50.550
 supplementary preparation from 

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:50.550
 this basic prepared video
