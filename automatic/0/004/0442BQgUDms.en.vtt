phone app also disappeared that's

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.160 
phone app also disappeared that's
because<00:01:44.550> the<00:01:44.729> iPhone<00:01:45.090> has<00:01:45.300> detected<00:01:45.869> that<00:01:46.020> the

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:46.170 
because the iPhone has detected that the

00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:52.160 
because the iPhone has detected that the
sim<00:01:46.470> is<00:01:46.649> not<00:01:47.100> a<00:01:47.130> valid<00:01:47.430> one<00:01:50.600> it's<00:01:51.600> searching

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170 
sim is not a valid one it's searching

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:57.260 
sim is not a valid one it's searching
for<00:01:52.200> a<00:01:52.350> network<00:01:52.619> right<00:01:53.009> now<00:01:55.610> the<00:01:56.610> iphone<00:01:57.000> will

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
for a network right now the iphone will

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:04.820 
for a network right now the iphone will
reboot<00:02:00.320> activation<00:02:01.320> required<00:02:03.830> activating

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:04.830 
reboot activation required activating

00:02:04.830 --> 00:02:08.770 
reboot activation required activating
the<00:02:04.950> iPhone<00:02:05.340> and<00:02:05.610> that's<00:02:06.509> it<00:02:06.780> sim<00:02:07.500> not<00:02:08.039> valid

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:08.780 
the iPhone and that's it sim not valid

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.690 
the iPhone and that's it sim not valid
so<00:02:09.780> that's<00:02:10.050> what<00:02:10.289> will<00:02:10.619> happen<00:02:11.160> if<00:02:11.340> you<00:02:11.459> put<00:02:11.670> a

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
so that's what will happen if you put a

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.390 
so that's what will happen if you put a
different<00:02:11.940> SIM<00:02:12.360> card<00:02:12.630> in<00:02:12.780> here

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400 
different SIM card in here

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.830 
different SIM card in here
now<00:02:14.400> let's<00:02:14.700> pop<00:02:14.940> out<00:02:15.120> the<00:02:15.269> SIM<00:02:15.450> card<00:02:15.690> tray

00:02:15.830 --> 00:02:15.840 
now let's pop out the SIM card tray

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:20.840 
now let's pop out the SIM card tray

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:13.910 
out the SIM card tray again so we can

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:16.030 
out the SIM card tray again so we can
replace<00:03:14.060> it<00:03:14.270> with<00:03:14.480> the<00:03:14.750> our<00:03:14.900> sim<00:03:15.170> adapter<00:03:15.680> with

00:03:16.030 --> 00:03:16.040 
replace it with the our sim adapter with

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:24.460 
replace it with the our sim adapter with
the<00:03:16.070> t-mobile<00:03:16.700> SIM<00:03:17.060> card<00:03:23.020> let's<00:03:24.020> slide<00:03:24.320> this

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:24.470 
the t-mobile SIM card let's slide this

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:30.729 
the t-mobile SIM card let's slide this
in<00:03:24.709> I<00:03:28.390> notice<00:03:29.390> that<00:03:29.570> the<00:03:29.690> t-mobile<00:03:30.050> SIM<00:03:30.410> card

00:03:30.729 --> 00:03:30.739 
in I notice that the t-mobile SIM card

00:03:30.739 --> 00:03:32.890 
in I notice that the t-mobile SIM card
is<00:03:30.890> actually<00:03:31.130> thicker<00:03:31.790> than<00:03:32.000> the<00:03:32.120> AT&amp;T<00:03:32.450> one

00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:32.900 
is actually thicker than the AT&amp;T one

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.170 
is actually thicker than the AT&amp;T one
that's<00:03:33.709> why<00:03:33.920> it's<00:03:34.160> a<00:03:34.310> little<00:03:34.580> harder<00:03:34.880> to<00:03:35.060> do

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:35.180 
that's why it's a little harder to do

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:39.490 
that's why it's a little harder to do
this<00:03:35.709> there<00:03:36.709> we<00:03:36.830> go<00:03:37.010> as<00:03:37.250> you<00:03:37.510> can<00:03:38.510> see<00:03:38.870> it<00:03:39.110> still
