00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.279
 hello to youtube I am cease and explain them 

00:00:02.639 --> 00:00:06.600
 about rubik cube notations 

00:00:04.279 --> 00:00:08.730
 first of all before learning to 

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:11.250
 Arming cube Rubik has to know how to 

00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:14.309
 go cube layers notations 

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:16.170
 are handled by layer movements is 

00:00:14.309 --> 00:00:17.550
 very important to know the notations already 

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.830
 that in most videos for 

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:22.859
 assemble the rubik cube or another different 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.420
 put as it will be pira mix or there are also q 

00:00:22.859 --> 00:00:27.720
 2 x 2 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.510
 use the notations for cases 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:34.870
 possible 

00:00:29.510 --> 00:00:37.559
 first of all we're going to explain 

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:40.660
 the actions are done depends as 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:43.840
 they usually see it in the novice method 

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:47.660
 with the white layer up or with the 

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:50.900
 yellow coat up good 

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:53.660
 the movement would be the layer in sense 

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:57.530
 schedule and the inverse movement will be in 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:01:00.370
 counterclockwise like here the layer 

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:04.409
 from the front that is only front is 

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:09.159
 symbolized with a front f 

00:01:04.409 --> 00:01:11.740
 Reverse efe 2 

00:01:09.159 --> 00:01:15.960
 the layer on the right would be the raid 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:19.880
 reverse flight frank 2 

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:22.380
 the left layer would be the left 

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.190
 left in the direction of the hands 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:28.620
 of the clock 

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:32.150
 I reverse them and l2 

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:36.960
 the bottom layer clockwise down 

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:42.480
 down reverse 2 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:46.560
 the top layer reverse pop-up 

00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:49.870
 2 that would be symbolized with water and the 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.710
 Last will be the back layer 

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:58.360
 back 

00:01:51.710 --> 00:02:01.840
 here reverse b &amp; b immersed and b2 back 2 

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:04.000
 well those are the two simple steps 

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:06.550
 they have to know in order to arm the 

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.020
 cube rubik more easily wait 

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:11.950
 our tutorials if they liked the 

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:14.490
 subscribe video I like and I do not know 

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:14.490
 remain with the desire
