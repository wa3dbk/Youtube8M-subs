to<00:00:47.940> upgrade<00:00:48.059> my<00:00:48.239> ex<00:00:48.890> collection<00:00:49.890> so<00:00:50.629> let's<00:00:51.629> I

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870 
to upgrade my ex collection so let's I

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:56.060 
to upgrade my ex collection so let's I
think<00:00:52.079> it's<00:00:52.199> the<00:00:52.410> same<00:00:52.680> order<00:00:52.949> so<00:00:53.100> 1<00:00:53.579> 2<00:00:53.730> 3<00:00:53.760> 4<00:00:55.070> 4th

00:00:56.060 --> 00:00:56.070 
think it's the same order so 1 2 3 4 4th

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:59.360 
think it's the same order so 1 2 3 4 4th
and<00:00:56.190> 5th<00:00:56.280> corps<00:00:56.489> in<00:00:56.579> the<00:00:56.640> back<00:00:57.079> alright<00:00:58.160> so<00:00:59.160> we

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
and 5th corps in the back alright so we

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:05.500 
and 5th corps in the back alright so we
have<00:00:59.399> a<00:00:59.579> slack<00:01:00.420> off<00:01:00.660> all<00:01:01.649> routes<00:01:03.049> Alma<00:01:04.049> night

00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:05.510 
have a slack off all routes Alma night

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:11.590 
have a slack off all routes Alma night
Machop<00:01:06.920> will<00:01:07.920> buff<00:01:08.100> it<00:01:09.200> Vigoroth<00:01:10.200> and

no reversal graphics okay Cacnea and my
rare<00:01:23.119> nice<00:01:24.770> holographic<00:01:25.770> I<00:01:25.979> grahn<00:01:27.200> really

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
rare nice holographic I grahn really

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.810 
rare nice holographic I grahn really
nice<00:01:28.380> unless<00:01:28.920> I<00:01:29.990> did<00:01:30.990> the<00:01:31.110> order<00:01:31.439> wrong

00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:51.180 
because i'm trying to figure out the

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:54.200 
because i'm trying to figure out the
order<00:01:51.210> of<00:01:51.479> these<00:01:51.600> packs<00:01:51.840> i<00:01:52.939> never<00:01:53.939> really

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.210 
order of these packs i never really

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:56.209 
order of these packs i never really
opened<00:01:54.360> many<00:01:54.600> x<00:01:55.140> packs<00:01:55.380> of<00:01:55.470> my<00:01:55.530> life<00:01:55.710> so<00:01:55.950> I

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
opened many x packs of my life so I

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.940 
opened many x packs of my life so I
don't<00:01:56.939> really<00:01:57.000> know<00:01:57.240> how<00:01:57.270> it<00:01:57.479> goes<00:01:57.630> but<00:01:57.899> i<00:01:58.140> will

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
don't really know how it goes but i will

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:02.330 
don't really know how it goes but i will
learn<00:01:59.100> during<00:01:59.399> the<00:01:59.490> process<00:02:01.040> okay<00:02:02.040> so<00:02:02.100> next

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.340 
learn during the process okay so next

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:09.219 
learn during the process okay so next
pack<00:02:02.579> is<00:02:02.700> gonna<00:02:02.820> be<00:02:02.909> right<00:02:03.060> you<00:02:03.210> pack

00:02:09.219 --> 00:02:09.229 

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:11.720 

and<00:02:10.229> how<00:02:10.380> to<00:02:10.440> kind<00:02:10.800> of<00:02:10.890> preserve<00:02:11.400> the<00:02:11.520> packs

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:11.730 
and how to kind of preserve the packs

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.230 
and how to kind of preserve the packs
but<00:02:11.970> the<00:02:12.209> cards<00:02:12.900> early<00:02:13.170> in<00:02:13.380> that<00:02:13.560> trade<00:02:13.770> zone

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:14.240 
but the cards early in that trade zone

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:16.760 
but the cards early in that trade zone
all<00:02:15.240> right<00:02:15.420> so<00:02:15.690> let's<00:02:16.080> go<00:02:16.440> straight<00:02:16.620> through

either that the person who sold me these

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:53.720 
either that the person who sold me these
packs<00:03:51.900> either<00:03:52.650> way<00:03:52.890> them<00:03:53.100> or<00:03:53.250> something<00:03:53.340> that

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:53.730 
packs either way them or something that

00:03:53.730 --> 00:03:57.170 
packs either way them or something that
so<00:03:54.660> next<00:03:54.840> pack<00:03:55.079> up<00:03:55.380> so<00:03:55.650> pack<00:03:55.910> let's<00:03:56.910> hope<00:03:57.000> they

00:03:57.170 --> 00:03:57.180 
so next pack up so pack let's hope they

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.330 
so next pack up so pack let's hope they
didn't<00:03:57.480> rate<00:03:57.600> them<00:03:57.750> but<00:03:57.959> i<00:03:58.170> did<00:03:58.709> get<00:03:58.980> them<00:03:59.160> for

00:03:59.330 --> 00:03:59.340 
didn't rate them but i did get them for

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:01.200 
didn't rate them but i did get them for
a<00:03:59.370> pretty<00:03:59.519> decent<00:04:00.150> price<00:04:00.329> so

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:01.210 
a pretty decent price so

00:04:01.210 --> 00:04:03.540 
a pretty decent price so
like<00:04:01.900> a<00:04:02.080> pretty<00:04:02.320> really<00:04:02.830> good<00:04:02.980> price<00:04:03.130> actually

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:03.550 
like a pretty really good price actually

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:06.300 
like a pretty really good price actually
so<00:04:03.840> even<00:04:04.840> if<00:04:04.930> you<00:04:04.990> did<00:04:05.140> weigh<00:04:05.290> them<00:04:05.470> I<00:04:05.770> wouldn't

00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:06.310 
so even if you did weigh them I wouldn't

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:08.490 
so even if you did weigh them I wouldn't
be<00:04:06.460> that<00:04:06.640> bad<00:04:06.820> but<00:04:07.090> I'm<00:04:07.810> kind<00:04:08.080> of<00:04:08.110> stuck<00:04:08.260> with

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:08.500 
be that bad but I'm kind of stuck with

00:04:08.500 --> 00:04:17.790 
be that bad but I'm kind of stuck with
it<00:04:09.150> all<00:04:10.150> right<00:04:10.350> so<00:04:12.450> one<00:04:13.450> two<00:04:14.070> three<00:04:15.070> four<00:04:16.800> all

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:17.800 
it all right so one two three four all

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:20.520 
it all right so one two three four all
right<00:04:18.150> sort<00:04:19.150> of<00:04:19.210> a<00:04:19.300> Charmander<00:04:19.870> claydol

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:20.530 
right sort of a Charmander claydol

00:04:20.530 --> 00:04:22.050 
right sort of a Charmander claydol
Charmander<00:04:21.100> this<00:04:21.489> is<00:04:21.610> actually<00:04:21.910> pretty

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:22.060 
Charmander this is actually pretty

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:25.830 
Charmander this is actually pretty
decent<00:04:22.240> clay<00:04:22.930> dog<00:04:23.110> Charmander<00:04:24.510> so<00:04:25.510> I<00:04:25.570> claydol

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:25.840 
decent clay dog Charmander so I claydol

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:28.440 
decent clay dog Charmander so I claydol

Turin<00:04:40.060> and<00:04:40.530> my<00:04:41.530> reverse<00:04:42.070> holographic<00:04:42.670> is<00:04:42.850> a

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:43.300 
Turin and my reverse holographic is a

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:46.290 
Turin and my reverse holographic is a
ball<00:04:44.230> toy<00:04:44.440> I<00:04:44.730> think<00:04:45.730> I<00:04:45.790> were<00:04:45.880> to<00:04:45.970> cut<00:04:46.090> one<00:04:46.180> of

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:46.300 
ball toy I think I were to cut one of

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:49.550 
ball toy I think I were to cut one of
those<00:04:46.420> my<00:04:47.140> rare<00:04:47.350> non<00:04:48.130> holographic<00:04:48.670> ninetails

00:04:49.550 --> 00:04:49.560 
those my rare non holographic ninetails

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:52.170 
those my rare non holographic ninetails
so<00:04:50.560> it's<00:04:50.740> starting<00:04:51.130> to<00:04:51.250> look<00:04:51.280> like<00:04:51.460> he<00:04:51.880> did<00:04:51.910> way

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:52.180 
so it's starting to look like he did way

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:53.670 
so it's starting to look like he did way
these<00:04:52.330> packs<00:04:52.630> because<00:04:52.900> I'm<00:04:53.140> not<00:04:53.230> getting<00:04:53.560> any

uncommon my rare holographic delcatty so
maybe<00:05:41.860> he<00:05:42.010> didn't<00:05:42.340> weigh<00:05:42.460> the<00:05:42.640> packs<00:05:42.910> for<00:05:43.240> ya
