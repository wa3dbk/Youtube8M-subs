00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:09.040 
I basically got that because I was

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:10.890 
I basically got that because I was
originally<00:01:09.520> voter<00:01:09.700> 795<00:01:10.390> but<00:01:10.660> that<00:01:10.780> really

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:10.900 
originally voter 795 but that really

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:13.410 
originally voter 795 but that really
wasn't<00:01:11.050> medieval<00:01:11.740> at<00:01:11.830> all<00:01:12.000> so<00:01:13.000> I<00:01:13.030> wanted

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:13.420 
wasn't medieval at all so I wanted

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:15.420 
wasn't medieval at all so I wanted
something<00:01:13.720> else<00:01:13.810> so<00:01:14.590> i<00:01:14.650> tried<00:01:14.890> Black<00:01:15.220> Knight

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:15.430 
something else so i tried Black Knight

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:16.770

but<00:01:15.760> that<00:01:16.030> wasn't<00:01:16.270> available<00:01:16.330> because

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:16.780 
but that wasn't available because

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:19.650 
but that wasn't available because
everyone<00:01:17.410> has<00:01:17.590> it<00:01:17.830> so<00:01:18.670> one<00:01:19.510> of<00:01:19.540> the

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:19.660 
everyone has it so one of the

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:22.200

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:31.770 
back number two I guess would be I

00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.620 
back number two I guess would be I
collect<00:01:32.770> a<00:01:32.890> bunch<00:01:33.040> of<00:01:33.250> junk<00:01:33.550> that<00:01:33.760> no<00:01:34.480> one

00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:34.630 
collect a bunch of junk that no one

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:37.820 
collect a bunch of junk that no one
would<00:01:34.750> really<00:01:35.080> collect<00:01:35.440> I<00:01:35.680> collect<00:01:36.370> Pat's<00:01:36.640> I
