everyone enthusiasts should our first up
on<00:00:11.400> the<00:00:11.429> list<00:00:11.639> I'm<00:00:12.210> sure<00:00:12.420> it's<00:00:12.570> pretty<00:00:12.690> obvious

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139 
on the list I'm sure it's pretty obvious

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:15.860 
on the list I'm sure it's pretty obvious
the<00:00:13.380> corkscrew<00:00:14.280> that's<00:00:14.969> right<00:00:15.330> the<00:00:15.570> good<00:00:15.719> old

00:00:15.860 --> 00:00:15.870 
the corkscrew that's right the good old

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.930 
the corkscrew that's right the good old
reliable<00:00:15.990> corkscrew<00:00:16.830> now<00:00:17.279> it<00:00:17.369> really<00:00:17.550> doesn't

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:17.940 
reliable corkscrew now it really doesn't

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:20.060 
reliable corkscrew now it really doesn't
matter<00:00:18.060> the<00:00:18.900> style<00:00:19.230> of<00:00:19.410> corkscrew<00:00:19.859> that<00:00:20.010> you

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:20.070 
matter the style of corkscrew that you

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:21.620 
matter the style of corkscrew that you
have<00:00:20.279> and<00:00:20.609> and<00:00:20.880> we'll<00:00:21.060> save<00:00:21.270> that<00:00:21.300> for<00:00:21.449> another

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:21.630 
have and and we'll save that for another

00:00:21.630 --> 00:00:22.970 
have and and we'll save that for another
video<00:00:21.960> because<00:00:22.320> it's<00:00:22.470> probably<00:00:22.650> worth

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:22.980 
video because it's probably worth

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.070 
video because it's probably worth
discussing<00:00:23.369> at<00:00:24.269> a<00:00:24.359> greater<00:00:24.630> length<00:00:24.840> of

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080 
discussing at a greater length of

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.300 
discussing at a greater length of
different<00:00:25.350> styles<00:00:25.500> that<00:00:25.769> are<00:00:25.890> available<00:00:26.039> out

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310 
different styles that are available out

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.269 
different styles that are available out
there<00:00:26.430> but<00:00:27.210> at<00:00:27.779> least<00:00:27.960> for<00:00:28.199> this<00:00:28.320> video

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:29.279 
there but at least for this video

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:31.569 
there but at least for this video
the<00:00:29.789> corkscrew<00:00:30.119> is<00:00:30.449> probably<00:00:30.750> the<00:00:30.960> number<00:00:31.109> one

00:00:31.569 --> 00:00:31.579 
the corkscrew is probably the number one

00:00:31.579 --> 00:00:34.459 
the corkscrew is probably the number one
wine<00:00:32.579> accessory<00:00:33.059> that<00:00:33.090> that<00:00:34.079> you<00:00:34.140> should<00:00:34.320> have

00:00:34.459 --> 00:00:34.469 
wine accessory that that you should have

00:00:34.469 --> 00:00:37.370 
wine accessory that that you should have
if<00:00:34.680> you're<00:00:34.800> into<00:00:35.100> wine<00:00:35.989> you<00:00:36.989> probably<00:00:37.260> have

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.380 
if you're into wine you probably have

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:38.900 
if you're into wine you probably have
three<00:00:37.530> or<00:00:37.680> four<00:00:37.710> I<00:00:37.890> even<00:00:38.219> have<00:00:38.340> one<00:00:38.489> in<00:00:38.579> my<00:00:38.670> car

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:38.910 
three or four I even have one in my car

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:40.459 
three or four I even have one in my car
just<00:00:38.940> in<00:00:39.210> case<00:00:39.270> of<00:00:39.480> wine<00:00:39.629> party<00:00:39.930> breaks<00:00:40.079> out<00:00:40.320> so

00:00:40.459 --> 00:00:40.469 
just in case of wine party breaks out so

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:41.180 
just in case of wine party breaks out so
you<00:00:40.530> never<00:00:40.710> know

00:00:41.180 --> 00:00:41.190 
you never know

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:43.639 
you never know
so<00:00:41.520> the<00:00:42.000> corkscrew<00:00:42.510> would<00:00:43.020> be<00:00:43.170> number<00:00:43.469> one

00:00:43.639 --> 00:00:43.649 
so the corkscrew would be number one

00:00:43.649 --> 00:00:46.310 
so the corkscrew would be number one
number<00:00:44.550> two<00:00:44.700> on<00:00:44.969> the<00:00:45.059> list<00:00:45.180> I<00:00:45.420> put<00:00:45.870> the<00:00:46.020> bottle

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
number two on the list I put the bottle

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.369 
number two on the list I put the bottle
stopper<00:00:46.710> now<00:00:47.700> the<00:00:47.760> bottle<00:00:48.120> stopper<00:00:48.539> again<00:00:49.170> I

00:00:49.369 --> 00:00:49.379 
stopper now the bottle stopper again I

00:00:49.379 --> 00:00:51.290 
stopper now the bottle stopper again I
don't<00:00:49.469> know<00:00:49.590> who<00:00:49.890> out<00:00:50.070> there<00:00:50.280> who's<00:00:50.460> into<00:00:51.090> wine

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300 
don't know who out there who's into wine

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.299 
don't know who out there who's into wine

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:06.420 
one of those items that I put at the top

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:08.420 
one of those items that I put at the top
because<00:01:06.780> most<00:01:07.140> wine<00:01:07.590> enthusiasts<00:01:08.100> have<00:01:08.220> them

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:08.430 
because most wine enthusiasts have them

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.160 
because most wine enthusiasts have them
and<00:01:09.090> they<00:01:09.180> collect<00:01:09.479> them<00:01:09.570> and<00:01:09.659> they<00:01:09.750> pull<00:01:10.049> them

00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:10.170 
and they collect them and they pull them

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:12.380 
and they collect them and they pull them
out<00:01:10.260> at<00:01:10.350> different<00:01:10.470> times<00:01:10.729> now<00:01:11.729> the<00:01:11.850> third<00:01:12.180> one

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
out at different times now the third one

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.670 
out at different times now the third one
maybe<00:01:13.350> not<00:01:13.619> as<00:01:13.710> obvious<00:01:14.210> the<00:01:15.210> drip<00:01:15.479> ring<00:01:15.689> a<00:01:15.930> lot

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:16.680 
maybe not as obvious the drip ring a lot

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:17.960 
maybe not as obvious the drip ring a lot
of<00:01:16.799> people<00:01:17.009> don't<00:01:17.130> know<00:01:17.280> about<00:01:17.430> the<00:01:17.580> drip<00:01:17.790> ring

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:17.970 
of people don't know about the drip ring

00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:19.969 
of people don't know about the drip ring
and<00:01:18.150> it<00:01:18.210> surprises<00:01:18.570> me<00:01:18.900> but<00:01:19.080> the<00:01:19.470> drip<00:01:19.650> ring<00:01:19.830> is

00:01:19.969 --> 00:01:19.979 
and it surprises me but the drip ring is

00:01:19.979 --> 00:01:21.350 
and it surprises me but the drip ring is
this<00:01:20.100> collar<00:01:20.369> that<00:01:20.580> fits<00:01:20.790> over<00:01:21.000> the<00:01:21.030> neck<00:01:21.240> of

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.360 
this collar that fits over the neck of

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.420 
this collar that fits over the neck of
the<00:01:21.420> bottle<00:01:21.710> and<00:01:22.710> basically<00:01:23.070> when<00:01:23.189> you<00:01:23.280> go<00:01:23.369> to

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
the bottle and basically when you go to

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.760 
the bottle and basically when you go to
pour<00:01:23.700> your<00:01:23.790> wine<00:01:24.530> sometimes<00:01:25.530> you<00:01:25.590> get<00:01:25.650> that

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:25.770 
pour your wine sometimes you get that

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:27.590 
pour your wine sometimes you get that
little<00:01:26.070> trip<00:01:26.430> that<00:01:26.640> comes<00:01:26.880> on<00:01:27.030> the<00:01:27.119> outside<00:01:27.479> of

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:27.600 
little trip that comes on the outside of

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.499 
little trip that comes on the outside of
the<00:01:27.689> bottle<00:01:28.049> and<00:01:28.229> would<00:01:28.979> go<00:01:29.270> creating<00:01:30.270> a<00:01:30.329> nice

00:01:30.499 --> 00:01:30.509 
the bottle and would go creating a nice

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:32.960 
the bottle and would go creating a nice
ring<00:01:30.900> on<00:01:31.259> your<00:01:31.380> table<00:01:31.829> or<00:01:32.220> tablecloth

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:32.970 
ring on your table or tablecloth

00:01:32.970 --> 00:01:35.060 
ring on your table or tablecloth
creating<00:01:33.720> a<00:01:33.780> little<00:01:33.990> bit<00:01:34.110> of<00:01:34.200> a<00:01:34.259> mess<00:01:34.470> well<00:01:34.920> the

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:35.070 
creating a little bit of a mess well the

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.850 
creating a little bit of a mess well the
drip<00:01:35.310> ring<00:01:35.549> stops<00:01:36.299> that<00:01:36.570> problem<00:01:37.079> the<00:01:37.619> drip
