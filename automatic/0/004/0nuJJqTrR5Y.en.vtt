(Hello everyone, it's Kagerou Imaizumi)

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:14.390
(Right now, I'm in the Bamboo Forest of the Lost, waiting to ambush the Hakurei shrine maiden)

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:18.470
(Why am I doing this, you ask.....?)

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.720
"Waka-chan, is anything interesting going on these days?"

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:35.020
"Hmm. Gero [vomit]-chan, have you heard about the recent incident?"

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:37.470
"W-W-W-Wait a minute! What's 'Gero-chan'!?"
"Hmm. Gero [vomit]-chan, have you heard about the recent incident?"

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:38.850
"W-W-W-Wait a minute! What's 'Gero-chan'!?"

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:44.310
"Well, you know how 'Kage-chan' doesn't sound that good"

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:47.640
"Sure, but that doesn't mean you can call me 'Gero-chan'!"

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:51.180
"No?"

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:53.140
"No!"

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.890
"All right. Then Gero-shabu, have you heard about the recent--"

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:00.470
"Stop with the 'Gero'!"
"All right. Then Gero-shabu, have heard about the recent--"

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:01.100
"Stop with the 'Gero'!"

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:07.430
"Um, Izumin, do you know about incidents?"

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:17.060
"Yes. There's been weird things happening one after another these days. Has the Network gotten more information about it?"

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:26.180
"Apparently, strong youkai are causing incidents so they can become friends with the Hakurei shrine maiden"

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:29.180
"Cirno-chan in this lake has been fighting her each time she passes by during an incident"

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:34.020
"Reimu! Fight me for the title of the strongest!"
"Cirno-chan in this lake has been fighting her each time she passes by during an incident"

00:01:34.020 --> 00:01:35.310
"Cirno-chan in this lake has been fighting her each time she passes by during an incident"

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:43.560
"How nice. She can brag to everyone that she was exterminated by the Hakurei shrine maiden!"

00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:51.970
"But we can't cause an incident, so who knows when the next opportunity is going to come......"

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:58.310
"......I see. Well, that's good to know"

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:05.100
(I didn't expect the opportunity to come so soon!)

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:16.970
(It's my very first spell card battle. ......I'm getting nervous. Will I be able to fight well?)

00:02:19.060 --> 00:02:19.600
"I'm impressed you haven't gotten lost in this Bamboo Forest!"

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:29.220
"She's a worthy opponent"

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.640
"If it gets dangerous, switch with me right away!"

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:40.310
"What a waste of time......hey, Yukari, give me a hand!"

00:02:41.270 --> 00:02:47.140
"For now, I'll leave you humans to your preliminary skirmish~"
