00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:25.470
 the priest of all the people has been exhausted 

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.240
 to facebook people who procreate 

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:29.040

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:30.990

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:33.210
 this he saw really excited with the 

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:35.280
 salvation is Monday equal no no you have to 

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:37.440
 put on the victim we all kill each other 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:39.059
 be here but we work all week 

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.489
 and the truth that out there when things 

00:00:39.059 --> 00:00:43.170
 you do not leave as one wants one gets 

00:00:41.489 --> 00:00:44.970
 a little sad but good here we are 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:47.430
 to fight it to improve the things that 

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:49.020
 the jury criticizes us and nothing and follow 

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.280
 go ahead for the dream that is that I'm 

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.199
 very committed entity but it goes 

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:53.339
 making the event more competitive 

00:00:52.199 --> 00:00:55.199
 As it happens it is true that it is 

00:00:53.339 --> 00:00:57.180
 putting more competitive 11 lives it from 

00:00:55.199 --> 00:00:59.220
 other places and I understand much more about 

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:00.850
 tears the emotions because it gets 

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:03.489
 more tense all 

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:08.140
 apart from what I was saying is that really 

00:01:03.489 --> 00:01:09.790
 the team of 20 33 that we're not in 

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.100
 the same conditions and it's understandable 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:14.320
 That's why when the jury costs 

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:15.729
 but it is true they have a hard time deciding 

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:17.380
 the score and the truth that I do not look at 

00:01:15.729 --> 00:01:19.600
 to my partners we are team 

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:22.180

 we work to die in what we 

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:26.619
 We believe that it is good and based on what 

00:01:23.799 --> 00:01:28.840
 the jury tells us we modify it today not 

00:01:26.619 --> 00:01:32.080

00:01:41.860 --> 00:01:47.789

00:01:43.149 --> 00:01:47.789
