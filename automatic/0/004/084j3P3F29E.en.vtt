00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:25.210 
now this method assumes that the market

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:28.920 
now this method assumes that the market
tops<00:01:25.480> are<00:01:25.810> typically<00:01:26.290> identified<00:01:26.910> by<00:01:27.910> a<00:01:28.240> rapid

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:28.930

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:32.160 
tops are typically identified by a rapid
price<00:01:29.260> increase<00:01:29.950> basically<00:01:30.850> when<00:01:31.210> everybody

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:32.170 
price increase basically when everybody

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:34.590 
price increase basically when everybody
expects<00:01:32.770> price<00:01:33.010> to<00:01:33.280> go<00:01:33.430> lower<00:01:33.700> or<00:01:34.000> higher<00:01:34.030> and

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:34.600 
expects price to go lower or higher and

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:36.930 
expects price to go lower or higher and
then<00:01:35.050> the<00:01:35.200> market<00:01:35.620> bottoms<00:01:36.070> typically<00:01:36.700> end

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:36.940 
then the market bottoms typically end

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:41.250 
then the market bottoms typically end
with<00:01:37.630> a<00:01:37.870> rapid<00:01:38.620> price<00:01:39.100> decline<00:01:39.760> or<00:01:40.260> basically

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:41.260 
with a rapid price decline or basically

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.620 
with a rapid price decline or basically
when<00:01:41.440> everybody<00:01:41.980> wants<00:01:42.370> to<00:01:42.490> get<00:01:42.640> out<00:01:42.670> let's<00:01:43.450> go

the zero line I'm looking for long
trades<00:02:28.829> and<00:02:29.159> if<00:02:30.060> my<00:02:30.239> oscillator<00:02:30.900> is<00:02:31.170> red<00:02:31.620> and

below the zero line then I'm looking to
take<00:02:35.400> short<00:02:36.060> trades<00:02:36.450> it's<00:02:37.109> a<00:02:37.170> great<00:02:37.469> indicator

00:02:37.789 --> 00:02:37.799

take short trades it's a great indicator
to<00:02:38.219> use<00:02:38.489> if<00:02:38.819> you're<00:02:39.060> a<00:02:39.090> trend<00:02:39.569> trader<00:02:39.810> now<00:02:40.709> as<00:02:41.040> I

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
to use if you're a trend trader now as I

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.520 
to use if you're a trend trader now as I
mentioned<00:02:41.909> you<00:02:42.299> can<00:02:42.450> also<00:02:42.480> color<00:02:43.049> the<00:02:43.170> bars

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:43.530 
mentioned you can also color the bars

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:45.319 
mentioned you can also color the bars
which<00:02:44.010> is<00:02:44.159> one<00:02:44.310> of<00:02:44.430> the<00:02:44.489> great<00:02:44.819> features<00:02:45.090> about

00:02:45.319 --> 00:02:45.329 
which is one of the great features about

00:02:45.329 --> 00:02:48.679 
which is one of the great features about
this<00:02:45.780> indicator<00:02:46.290> as<00:02:46.530> well<00:02:46.700> so<00:02:47.700> not<00:02:48.180> only<00:02:48.359> can

00:02:48.679 --> 00:02:48.689 
this indicator as well so not only can

00:02:48.689 --> 00:02:50.379 
this indicator as well so not only can

you see the color down here on your

00:03:02.069 --> 00:03:05.689 
clearly tells you without even looking
at<00:03:02.219> the<00:03:02.459> oscillator<00:03:03.680> exactly<00:03:04.680> what<00:03:05.250> the<00:03:05.400> trend

00:03:05.689 --> 00:03:05.699 
at the oscillator exactly what the trend

00:03:05.699 --> 00:03:07.909 
at the oscillator exactly what the trend
is<00:03:05.969> like<00:03:06.569> I<00:03:06.689> was<00:03:06.870> saying<00:03:07.139> it's<00:03:07.620> a<00:03:07.739> great

00:03:07.909 --> 00:03:07.919 
is like I was saying it's a great

00:03:07.919 --> 00:03:11.089 
is like I was saying it's a great
leading<00:03:08.400> indicator<00:03:09.120> as<00:03:09.419> far<00:03:09.750> as<00:03:10.099> measuring

00:03:11.089 --> 00:03:11.099 
leading indicator as far as measuring

00:03:11.099 --> 00:03:12.679 
leading indicator as far as measuring
the<00:03:11.370> instruments<00:03:12.000> rate<00:03:12.180> of<00:03:12.359> change

00:03:12.679 --> 00:03:12.689 
the instruments rate of change

00:03:12.689 --> 00:03:14.929 
the instruments rate of change
theoretically<00:03:13.590> what<00:03:13.919> we've<00:03:14.069> got<00:03:14.280> right<00:03:14.310> here

00:03:14.929 --> 00:03:14.939 
theoretically what we've got right here

00:03:14.939 --> 00:03:16.939 
theoretically what we've got right here
is<00:03:15.090> where<00:03:15.299> price<00:03:15.659> actually<00:03:15.959> does<00:03:16.469> start<00:03:16.799> to

00:03:16.939 --> 00:03:16.949 
is where price actually does start to

00:03:16.949 --> 00:03:19.159 
is where price actually does start to
change<00:03:17.219> and<00:03:17.489> then<00:03:17.639> we<00:03:17.879> do<00:03:18.090> see<00:03:18.389> that

00:03:19.159 --> 00:03:19.169 
change and then we do see that

00:03:19.169 --> 00:03:22.490 
change and then we do see that
eventually<00:03:19.500> price<00:03:20.069> rises<00:03:20.790> and<00:03:21.030> we<00:03:21.989> move<00:03:22.290> into

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:22.500 
eventually price rises and we move into

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.039 
eventually price rises and we move into
an<00:03:22.829> uptrend<00:03:23.459> so<00:03:23.730> the<00:03:24.180> momentum<00:03:24.659> multicolor

00:03:25.039 --> 00:03:25.049 
an uptrend so the momentum multicolor

00:03:25.049 --> 00:03:27.770 
an uptrend so the momentum multicolor
line<00:03:25.549> actually<00:03:26.549> gave<00:03:26.729> us<00:03:26.909> the<00:03:27.060> heads<00:03:27.299> up<00:03:27.540> back

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
line actually gave us the heads up back

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:29.719 
line actually gave us the heads up back
here<00:03:28.199> that<00:03:28.650> we<00:03:28.979> might<00:03:29.189> want<00:03:29.370> to<00:03:29.489> start

00:03:29.719 --> 00:03:29.729 
here that we might want to start

00:03:29.729 --> 00:03:31.399 
here that we might want to start
thinking<00:03:30.060> that<00:03:30.359> well<00:03:30.569> perhaps<00:03:30.870> there's<00:03:31.290> going

00:03:31.399 --> 00:03:31.409 
thinking that well perhaps there's going

00:03:31.409 --> 00:03:33.679 
thinking that well perhaps there's going
to<00:03:31.470> be<00:03:31.530> a<00:03:31.620> change<00:03:32.009> in<00:03:32.250> market<00:03:32.849> direction<00:03:33.540> which

00:03:33.679 --> 00:03:33.689 
to be a change in market direction which

00:03:33.689 --> 00:03:36.050 
to be a change in market direction which
we're<00:03:33.930> seeing<00:03:34.199> right<00:03:34.500> here<00:03:34.560> currently<00:03:35.519> we<00:03:35.790> see

00:03:36.050 --> 00:03:36.060 
we're seeing right here currently we see

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.749 
we're seeing right here currently we see
price<00:03:36.840> starting<00:03:37.319> to<00:03:37.409> drop<00:03:37.680> off<00:03:37.949> here<00:03:38.400> on<00:03:38.579> the

00:03:38.749 --> 00:03:38.759 
price starting to drop off here on the

00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:40.879 
price starting to drop off here on the
oil<00:03:38.939> market<00:03:39.090> so<00:03:39.840> we<00:03:39.989> can<00:03:40.139> take<00:03:40.319> a<00:03:40.349> look<00:03:40.590> at<00:03:40.739> this

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:40.889 
oil market so we can take a look at this

00:03:40.889 --> 00:03:43.009 
oil market so we can take a look at this
as<00:03:41.069> well<00:03:41.280> and<00:03:41.879> we<00:03:42.030> can<00:03:42.150> see<00:03:42.329> where<00:03:42.509> price<00:03:42.780> is

00:03:43.009 --> 00:03:43.019 
as well and we can see where price is

00:03:43.019 --> 00:03:44.569 
as well and we can see where price is
it's<00:03:43.229> it's<00:03:43.530> kind<00:03:43.799> of<00:03:43.889> started<00:03:44.189> to<00:03:44.310> sell<00:03:44.489> off

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:44.579 
it's it's kind of started to sell off

00:03:44.579 --> 00:03:46.369 
it's it's kind of started to sell off
off<00:03:44.819> here<00:03:45.120> just<00:03:45.150> a<00:03:45.389> little<00:03:45.509> bit<00:03:45.659> we<00:03:46.169> can<00:03:46.319> see

00:03:46.369 --> 00:03:46.379 
off here just a little bit we can see

00:03:46.379 --> 00:03:48.800 
off here just a little bit we can see
back<00:03:46.799> here<00:03:47.250> with<00:03:47.909> a<00:03:47.939> momentum<00:03:48.479> multicolor

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:48.810 
back here with a momentum multicolor

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:51.890 
back here with a momentum multicolor
oscillator<00:03:49.680> that<00:03:49.949> price<00:03:50.909> pretty<00:03:51.269> much<00:03:51.540> peaked

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:51.900 
oscillator that price pretty much peaked
