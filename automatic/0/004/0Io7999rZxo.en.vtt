00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:23.640 
work on 11 in Vista and XP so let's get

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:24.859 
work on 11 in Vista and XP so let's get
started

00:01:24.859 --> 00:01:24.869 
started

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:26.300 
started
you'll<00:01:25.229> nest<00:01:25.439> that<00:01:25.619> most<00:01:25.799> of<00:01:25.920> these<00:01:26.009> are

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:54.750 

till<00:03:50.540> it<00:03:50.660> was<00:03:50.750> pretty<00:03:50.960> cold<00:03:51.170> again<00:03:51.530> a<00:03:51.830> song

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:54.760 

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:56.410 

that's<00:03:55.760> very<00:03:56.000> cool

that's very cool

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:58.090 
that's very cool
I'm<00:03:56.810> not<00:03:57.080> sure<00:03:57.230> if<00:03:57.290> I've<00:03:57.440> been<00:03:57.500> stood<00:03:57.740> on<00:03:57.980> this

00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:58.100 
I'm not sure if I've been stood on this

00:03:58.100 --> 00:03:59.860 
I'm not sure if I've been stood on this
actually<00:03:58.490> so<00:03:58.670> apologizing<00:03:59.300> or<00:03:59.420> haven't<00:03:59.690> I

00:03:59.860 --> 00:03:59.870 
actually so apologizing or haven't I

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:01.740 
actually so apologizing or haven't I
know<00:04:00.410> I<00:04:00.440> have<00:04:00.650> it

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:01.750 
know I have it

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:04.449 
know I have it
so<00:04:02.750> again<00:04:03.050> does<00:04:03.560> exactly<00:04:03.830> the<00:04:04.010> same<00:04:04.040> thing<00:04:04.340> I

00:04:04.449 --> 00:04:04.459 
so again does exactly the same thing I

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:07.510 
so again does exactly the same thing I
think<00:04:04.490> these<00:04:04.700> are<00:04:04.790> just<00:04:06.250> animations<00:04:07.250> are<00:04:07.430> not

00:04:07.510 --> 00:04:07.520 
think these are just animations are not

00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:10.360 
think these are just animations are not
anything<00:04:07.730> like<00:04:07.910> special<00:04:08.920> and<00:04:09.920> it's<00:04:10.040> been<00:04:10.190> done

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:10.370

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:24.620 
because that's what the rave MP is but

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:26.770 
because that's what the rave MP is but
when<00:04:24.860> you<00:04:25.010> play<00:04:25.250> it<00:04:25.430> you<00:04:26.120> can<00:04:26.150> change<00:04:26.540> the

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:26.780 
when you play it you can change the

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:49.790 

00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:53.180 

services<00:06:50.790> aren't<00:06:51.380> extremely<00:06:52.380> practical<00:06:52.800> if

00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:53.190 
services aren't extremely practical if

00:06:53.190 --> 00:06:54.950 
services aren't extremely practical if
you<00:06:53.280> want<00:06:53.400> to<00:06:53.460> play<00:06:53.580> a<00:06:53.610> quick<00:06:53.759> song<00:06:54.090> but<00:06:54.509> either

00:06:58.040 --> 00:06:58.050 
way they're pretty cool all the same so

00:06:58.050 --> 00:07:01.760 
way they're pretty cool all the same so
again<00:06:58.440> shown<00:06:58.740> on<00:06:58.889> Vista<00:07:00.169> so<00:07:01.169> it<00:07:01.410> just<00:07:01.590> runs

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:01.770
