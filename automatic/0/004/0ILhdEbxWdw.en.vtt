infant who presented with vomiting often
projectile<00:00:12.990> vomiting<00:00:13.920> and<00:00:14.929> this<00:00:15.929> is<00:00:16.109> a

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:16.139 
projectile vomiting and this is a

00:00:16.139 --> 00:00:20.330 
projectile vomiting and this is a
diagnosis<00:00:16.949> of<00:00:17.539> pyloric<00:00:18.539> stenosis<00:00:18.720> and<00:00:19.340> it's

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:20.340 
diagnosis of pyloric stenosis and it's

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:23.980 
diagnosis of pyloric stenosis and it's
ultrasound<00:00:21.020> I'll<00:00:22.020> be<00:00:22.340> brief<00:00:23.340> here<00:00:23.369> I<00:00:23.820> just

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:23.990 
ultrasound I'll be brief here I just

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:27.019 
ultrasound I'll be brief here I just
wanted<00:00:24.990> you<00:00:25.260> to<00:00:25.590> get<00:00:25.800> another<00:00:25.980> idea<00:00:26.400> of<00:00:26.640> how

00:00:27.019 --> 00:00:27.029 
wanted you to get another idea of how

00:00:27.029 --> 00:00:30.830 
wanted you to get another idea of how
useful<00:00:27.810> ultrasound<00:00:28.710> is<00:00:29.160> and<00:00:29.429> how<00:00:30.150> operator

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:30.840 
useful ultrasound is and how operator

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.950 
useful ultrasound is and how operator
dependent<00:00:31.109> it<00:00:31.710> is<00:00:32.040> in<00:00:32.399> other<00:00:32.669> words<00:00:32.719> we<00:00:33.719> the

dependent it is in other words we the

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.770 
dependent it is in other words we the
radiologists<00:00:34.829> will<00:00:35.399> depend<00:00:36.210> a<00:00:36.270> great<00:00:36.300> deal<00:00:36.510> on

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.780 
radiologists will depend a great deal on

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:41.000 
radiologists will depend a great deal on
the<00:00:37.200> images<00:00:37.680> that<00:00:37.710> we're<00:00:38.010> provided<00:00:38.640> and<00:00:40.010> we

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:41.010 
the images that we're provided and we

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.880 
the images that we're provided and we
can<00:00:41.190> be<00:00:41.340> mislead<00:00:41.820> if<00:00:42.149> an<00:00:42.930> ultra<00:00:43.230> smog<00:00:43.469> refer<00:00:43.739> is

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:43.890 
can be mislead if an ultra smog refer is

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:47.180 
can be mislead if an ultra smog refer is
not<00:00:44.129> good<00:00:44.460> and<00:00:45.320> that's<00:00:46.320> why<00:00:46.559> we<00:00:46.770> have<00:00:46.890> a<00:00:46.920> great

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:47.190 
not good and that's why we have a great

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.979 
not good and that's why we have a great
deal<00:00:47.399> of<00:00:47.430> conversation<00:00:47.789> with<00:00:48.450> them<00:00:48.660> unlike

00:00:48.979 --> 00:00:48.989 
deal of conversation with them unlike

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:52.490 
deal of conversation with them unlike
other<00:00:49.260> imaging<00:00:49.890> modalities<00:00:51.110> anyway<00:00:52.110> this<00:00:52.289> is

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500 
other imaging modalities anyway this is

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.000 
other imaging modalities anyway this is
a<00:00:52.530> good<00:00:52.770> example<00:00:52.920> of<00:00:53.430> pyloric<00:00:54.059> stenosis<00:00:54.270> the

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:55.010 
a good example of pyloric stenosis the

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:59.360 
a good example of pyloric stenosis the
important<00:00:56.010> findings<00:00:56.430> are<00:00:56.640> that<00:00:57.710> you<00:00:58.710> have<00:00:58.739> a

00:00:59.360 --> 00:00:59.370 
important findings are that you have a

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.849 
important findings are that you have a
thick<00:01:00.239> wall<00:01:00.510> of<00:01:00.539> the<00:01:00.809> pylorus<00:01:01.289> now<00:01:01.500> this<00:01:01.680> could

00:01:01.849 --> 00:01:01.859 
thick wall of the pylorus now this could

00:01:01.859 --> 00:01:06.620 
thick wall of the pylorus now this could
be<00:01:02.359> any<00:01:03.359> area<00:01:04.140> of<00:01:04.379> this<00:01:04.769> the<00:01:05.369> abdomen<00:01:05.909> but<00:01:06.270> if

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:06.630 
be any area of this the abdomen but if

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:09.109 
be any area of this the abdomen but if
you<00:01:06.750> look<00:01:06.900> closely<00:01:07.110> this<00:01:07.409> is<00:01:07.560> liver<00:01:07.890> and<00:01:08.189> this

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119 
you look closely this is liver and this

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:11.090 
you look closely this is liver and this
is<00:01:09.270> gall<00:01:09.570> bladder<00:01:09.900> and<00:01:10.200> you<00:01:10.799> know<00:01:10.950> the

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:11.100 
is gall bladder and you know the

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.469 
is gall bladder and you know the
duodenum<00:01:11.490> and<00:01:12.680> how<00:01:13.680> Lloris<00:01:14.100> are<00:01:14.310> close<00:01:14.580> to<00:01:14.880> the

00:01:15.469 --> 00:01:15.479 
duodenum and how Lloris are close to the

00:01:15.479 --> 00:01:18.350 
duodenum and how Lloris are close to the
gall<00:01:15.720> bladder<00:01:15.799> so<00:01:16.799> this<00:01:16.979> is<00:01:17.189> fluid<00:01:18.030> in<00:01:18.210> the

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:18.360 
gall bladder so this is fluid in the

00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.270 
gall bladder so this is fluid in the
stomach<00:01:18.840> and<00:01:19.049> this<00:01:19.680> is<00:01:19.950> the<00:01:20.600> pylorus<00:01:21.650> the<00:01:22.650> area

00:01:23.270 --> 00:01:23.280 
stomach and this is the pylorus the area

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:26.359 
stomach and this is the pylorus the area
the<00:01:23.670> channel<00:01:24.180> through<00:01:24.479> which<00:01:24.950> this<00:01:25.950> fluid

00:01:26.359 --> 00:01:26.369 
the channel through which this fluid

00:01:26.369 --> 00:01:29.330 
the channel through which this fluid
should<00:01:26.700> pass<00:01:27.439> so<00:01:28.439> this<00:01:28.619> is<00:01:28.740> in<00:01:28.860> the<00:01:28.950> distal

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:29.340 
should pass so this is in the distal

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.609 
should pass so this is in the distal
stomach<00:01:29.700> or<00:01:29.880> the<00:01:30.000> gastric<00:01:30.420> antrum<00:01:31.020> and<00:01:31.170> it

00:01:31.609 --> 00:01:31.619 
stomach or the gastric antrum and it

00:01:31.619 --> 00:01:33.950 
stomach or the gastric antrum and it
wants<00:01:31.979> to<00:01:32.100> get<00:01:32.250> through<00:01:32.430> the<00:01:32.640> pyloric<00:01:33.119> channel

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960 
wants to get through the pyloric channel

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:37.060 
wants to get through the pyloric channel
in<00:01:34.170> the<00:01:35.070> pylorus<00:01:35.610> here<00:01:35.880> but<00:01:36.509> it<00:01:36.630> cannot

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:37.070 
in the pylorus here but it cannot

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:41.210 
in the pylorus here but it cannot
because<00:01:38.070> this<00:01:38.460> muscular<00:01:39.210> wall<00:01:39.509> is<00:01:39.930> too<00:01:40.829> thick

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:41.220 
because this muscular wall is too thick

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.200 
because this muscular wall is too thick
it<00:01:41.460> is<00:01:41.520> enlarged<00:01:42.270> its<00:01:42.930> hypertrophied<00:01:43.829> so<00:01:44.729> that

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
it is enlarged its hypertrophied so that

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.210 
it is enlarged its hypertrophied so that
is<00:01:45.420> the<00:01:45.570> cause<00:01:45.780> of<00:01:45.810> pyloric<00:01:46.380> stenosis<00:01:46.590> in<00:01:47.100> this

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:47.220 
is the cause of pyloric stenosis in this

00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:50.179 
is the cause of pyloric stenosis in this
case<00:01:47.490> the<00:01:47.759> hypoechoic<00:01:48.360> darker<00:01:49.290> area<00:01:49.680> here<00:01:50.009> is

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
case the hypoechoic darker area here is

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:55.160 
case the hypoechoic darker area here is
the<00:01:50.729> muscle<00:01:51.210> and<00:01:51.680> the<00:01:52.680> mucosa<00:01:53.280> is<00:01:53.700> bright<00:01:54.570> blue

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:55.170 
the muscle and the mucosa is bright blue

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.990 
the muscle and the mucosa is bright blue
whiter<00:01:55.820> here<00:01:56.820> and<00:01:57.030> some<00:01:58.020> of<00:01:58.110> the<00:01:58.200> other<00:01:59.000> images

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:00.000 
whiter here and some of the other images

00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.050 
whiter here and some of the other images
are<00:02:00.210> excellent<00:02:00.840> this<00:02:01.020> is<00:02:01.200> as<00:02:01.380> good<00:02:02.250> an<00:02:02.909> example

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:03.060 
are excellent this is as good an example

00:02:03.060 --> 00:02:05.749 
are excellent this is as good an example
as<00:02:03.600> you<00:02:03.719> will<00:02:03.869> see<00:02:04.110> anywhere<00:02:04.740> better<00:02:05.430> than<00:02:05.640> you

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759 
as you will see anywhere better than you

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:06.980 
as you will see anywhere better than you
see<00:02:05.969> in<00:02:06.000> most<00:02:06.299> textbooks

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
see in most textbooks

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.080 
see in most textbooks
it<00:02:07.110> so<00:02:07.259> happens<00:02:07.680> so<00:02:08.190> here<00:02:08.399> you<00:02:08.459> have<00:02:08.580> gastric

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:09.090 
it so happens so here you have gastric

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.690 
it so happens so here you have gastric
content<00:02:09.629> in<00:02:09.810> the<00:02:10.020> pylorus<00:02:10.560> it<00:02:11.129> wants<00:02:11.489> to<00:02:11.580> go

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:11.700 
content in the pylorus it wants to go

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.970 
content in the pylorus it wants to go
through<00:02:11.940> the<00:02:12.090> pot<00:02:12.360> through<00:02:13.200> the

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:13.980 
through the pot through the

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.399 
through the pot through the
interim<00:02:14.340> I<00:02:14.700> mean<00:02:15.599> I'm<00:02:15.750> the<00:02:15.840> bits<00:02:16.200> in<00:02:16.319> the

00:02:16.399 --> 00:02:16.409 
interim I mean I'm the bits in the

00:02:16.409 --> 00:02:17.630 
interim I mean I'm the bits in the
antrum<00:02:16.769> and<00:02:16.950> it<00:02:17.010> wants<00:02:17.220> to<00:02:17.250> go<00:02:17.370> through<00:02:17.519> the

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:17.640 
antrum and it wants to go through the

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:20.330 
antrum and it wants to go through the
pylorus<00:02:18.090> into<00:02:18.360> the<00:02:18.450> duodenum<00:02:19.040> but<00:02:20.040> we<00:02:20.190> have

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340 
pylorus into the duodenum but we have

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.309 
pylorus into the duodenum but we have
pyloric<00:02:20.760> stenosis<00:02:20.940> and<00:02:21.330> look<00:02:21.659> how<00:02:21.810> thick<00:02:22.140> this

00:02:22.309 --> 00:02:22.319 
pyloric stenosis and look how thick this

00:02:22.319 --> 00:02:24.649 
pyloric stenosis and look how thick this
is<00:02:22.590> this<00:02:23.310> is<00:02:23.519> probably<00:02:23.940> three<00:02:24.510> or<00:02:24.540> four

00:02:24.649 --> 00:02:24.659 
is this is probably three or four

00:02:24.659 --> 00:02:26.210 
is this is probably three or four
millimeters<00:02:25.379> thick<00:02:25.650> it<00:02:25.799> should<00:02:25.950> only<00:02:26.069> be

millimeters thick it should only be

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.210 
millimeters thick it should only be
about<00:02:26.610> at<00:02:26.970> most<00:02:27.269> two<00:02:27.540> millimeters<00:02:28.110> the<00:02:28.890> length

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:53.040 
get a good feel for exactly what it is

00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:54.979 
get a good feel for exactly what it is
they're<00:03:53.310> seeing<00:03:53.609> and<00:03:53.970> just<00:03:54.720> to<00:03:54.810> make<00:03:54.959> sure

00:03:54.979 --> 00:03:54.989 
they're seeing and just to make sure

00:03:54.989 --> 00:03:58.430 
they're seeing and just to make sure
that<00:03:55.459> we<00:03:56.459> agree<00:03:56.760> with<00:03:56.849> their<00:03:57.000> observations<00:03:57.750> so

00:03:58.430 --> 00:03:58.440 
that we agree with their observations so

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:02.000 
that we agree with their observations so

here again fluid in the gastric antrum

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:06.530 
here again fluid in the gastric antrum
this<00:04:02.910> is<00:04:03.090> the<00:04:03.239> pylorus<00:04:04.250> the<00:04:05.250> pyloric<00:04:05.790> new<00:04:06.209> coat

00:04:10.849 --> 00:04:10.859 
and pyloric a muscle is too thick this

00:04:10.859 --> 00:04:13.970 
and pyloric a muscle is too thick this
is<00:04:11.040> the<00:04:11.220> pyloric<00:04:12.019> channel<00:04:13.019> with<00:04:13.349> the<00:04:13.500> mucosa

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:13.980 
is the pyloric channel with the mucosa

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:18.800 
is the pyloric channel with the mucosa
on<00:04:14.310> each<00:04:14.459> side<00:04:14.760> so<00:04:15.449> this<00:04:15.599> is<00:04:15.889> muscular<00:04:17.810> layer

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:18.810 
on each side so this is muscular layer

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:20.629 
on each side so this is muscular layer
here<00:04:19.289> and<00:04:19.349> this<00:04:19.620> is<00:04:19.769> a<00:04:19.799> muscle<00:04:20.190> over<00:04:20.310> on<00:04:20.459> this

here and this is a muscle over on this

00:04:20.639 --> 00:04:22.310 
here and this is a muscle over on this
side<00:04:20.849> because<00:04:21.090> it's<00:04:21.449> actually<00:04:21.630> of<00:04:21.900> course<00:04:21.930> a

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:22.320 
side because it's actually of course a

cylindrical

00:04:23.770 --> 00:04:23.780 
cylindrical

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:28.810 
cylindrical
structure<00:04:24.770> and<00:04:24.950> this<00:04:25.670> is<00:04:25.730> the<00:04:26.000> canal<00:04:26.389> and<00:04:27.820> it's

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:28.820 
structure and this is the canal and it's

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:31.990 
structure and this is the canal and it's
basically<00:04:29.180> occluded<00:04:29.690> so<00:04:30.110> the<00:04:30.740> content<00:04:31.580> of<00:04:31.730> the

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:32.000 
basically occluded so the content of the

00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:34.960 
basically occluded so the content of the

pylorus into the duodenum so that is

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:42.390 
pylorus into the duodenum so that is
classic<00:04:39.500> appearance<00:04:39.860> of<00:04:40.930> pyloric<00:04:41.930> stenosis

Praja<00:04:52.040> presents<00:04:52.790> with<00:04:52.940> projectile<00:04:53.830> vomiting

00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:54.830 
Praja presents with projectile vomiting

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:58.090 
Praja presents with projectile vomiting
you<00:04:54.919> can<00:04:55.070> see<00:04:55.190> here<00:04:55.580> the<00:04:56.060> muscularis<00:04:57.100> muscle

00:04:58.090 --> 00:04:58.100 
you can see here the muscularis muscle

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:01.030 
you can see here the muscularis muscle
layer<00:04:58.280> is<00:04:58.780> over<00:04:59.780> four<00:05:00.080> millimeters<00:05:00.560> thick<00:05:00.830> and

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:01.040 
layer is over four millimeters thick and

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:02.470 
layer is over four millimeters thick and
you<00:05:01.130> can<00:05:01.280> really<00:05:01.520> begin<00:05:01.669> to<00:05:01.820> appreciate<00:05:02.330> how

you can really begin to appreciate how
thick<00:05:02.720> it<00:05:02.870> is<00:05:02.990> here<00:05:03.430> but<00:05:04.430> once<00:05:04.669> again<00:05:04.870> these

00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:05.870 
thick it is here but once again these

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:08.650 
thick it is here but once again these
measurements<00:05:06.650> are<00:05:06.800> important<00:05:07.460> but<00:05:08.180> a<00:05:08.240> vital

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:08.660 
measurements are important but a vital

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:12.420 
measurements are important but a vital
component<00:05:08.870> is<00:05:09.440> the<00:05:09.770> observation<00:05:10.669> that

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:12.430 
component is the observation that

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:15.400 
component is the observation that
content<00:05:13.430> of<00:05:13.610> the<00:05:14.000> antrum<00:05:14.540> is<00:05:14.720> not<00:05:14.930> passing

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:15.410 
content of the antrum is not passing

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:17.680 
content of the antrum is not passing
through<00:05:15.590> the<00:05:15.740> pylorus<00:05:16.250> into<00:05:16.850> the<00:05:16.970> duodenum<00:05:17.330> as

through the pylorus into the duodenum as
it<00:05:17.870> should<00:05:18.110> look<00:05:18.800> at<00:05:19.010> this<00:05:19.160> this<00:05:19.340> is<00:05:21.130> you'll

it should look at this this is you'll

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:24.190 
it should look at this this is you'll
see<00:05:22.280> images<00:05:22.700> like<00:05:23.300> this<00:05:23.540> but<00:05:23.750> you'll<00:05:24.020> never

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:24.200 
see images like this but you'll never

see any that are better than this this

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:30.510 
see any that are better than this this
is<00:05:25.970> as<00:05:26.389> good<00:05:26.540> as<00:05:27.110> it<00:05:28.100> gets
