because in my eyes you know call it you
is<00:05:24.450> just<00:05:24.630> so<00:05:25.110> different<00:05:25.380> from<00:05:25.590> every<00:05:25.860> other

00:05:25.910 --> 00:05:25.920 
is just so different from every other

00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:27.650 
is just so different from every other
game<00:05:26.160> it<00:05:26.370> says<00:05:26.550> so<00:05:26.700> casual<00:05:27.150> compared<00:05:27.480> to<00:05:27.570> these

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:27.660 
game it says so casual compared to these

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:28.910

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:28.920 
games if you're watching this footage

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:31.010 
games if you're watching this footage
right<00:05:29.100> now<00:05:29.280> this<00:05:29.430> destiny<00:05:29.910> or<00:05:30.060> battlefield<00:05:30.780> or

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:31.020 
right now this destiny or battlefield or

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:32.000 
right now this destiny or battlefield or
whatever<00:05:31.260> we're<00:05:31.350> go<00:05:31.440> in<00:05:31.530> the<00:05:31.590> background<00:05:31.920> you

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:32.010 
whatever we're go in the background you

00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:34.520 
whatever we're go in the background you
can<00:05:32.130> see<00:05:32.190> like<00:05:32.580> it's<00:05:32.760> pretty<00:05:33.150> intense<00:05:33.540> it's

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:34.530 
can see like it's pretty intense it's

00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:36.230 
can see like it's pretty intense it's
pretty<00:05:34.800> hard<00:05:34.980> to<00:05:35.100> stay<00:05:35.310> alive<00:05:35.430> and<00:05:35.850> do<00:05:36.000> well

00:05:36.230 --> 00:05:36.240 
pretty hard to stay alive and do well

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:38.270 
pretty hard to stay alive and do well
without<00:05:36.600> getting<00:05:37.200> shut<00:05:37.410> down<00:05:37.440> because<00:05:37.950> it's

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:38.280 
without getting shut down because it's

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:40.430 
without getting shut down because it's
so<00:05:38.550> I<00:05:39.090> don't<00:05:39.450> know<00:05:39.540> it's<00:05:39.720> just<00:05:39.930> so<00:05:40.140> different

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:40.440 
so I don't know it's just so different

00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:42.590 
so I don't know it's just so different
with<00:05:40.680> Coldewey<00:05:41.070> you<00:05:42.060> can<00:05:42.180> just<00:05:42.360> run<00:05:42.510> around

00:05:44.450 --> 00:05:44.460 
the destroy and keep destroying is so

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:46.070 
the destroy and keep destroying is so
