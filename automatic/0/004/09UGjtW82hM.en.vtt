nearing<00:03:32.510> around<00:03:32.810> 20<00:03:33.319> now<00:03:33.470> of<00:03:33.799> how<00:03:34.069> many<00:03:34.250> times

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:34.459 
nearing around 20 now of how many times

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:36.280 
nearing around 20 now of how many times
too<00:03:34.670> soon<00:03:34.880> I'm<00:03:35.359> sure<00:03:35.510> there<00:03:35.959> is

burgh<00:03:37.940> speeder<00:03:38.209> bike<00:03:38.420> for<00:03:38.660> the<00:03:38.780> you<00:03:39.230> know<00:03:39.260> but

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:39.530 
burgh speeder bike for the you know but

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:40.840 
burgh speeder bike for the you know but
for<00:03:39.560> the<00:03:39.799> most<00:03:39.950> part<00:03:40.069> it's<00:03:40.310> almost<00:03:40.519> the<00:03:40.700> same
