00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:15.840 
you're anything like me you're probably

00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.990 
you're anything like me you're probably
reading<00:01:16.380> more<00:01:16.710> than<00:01:16.920> one<00:01:17.130> book<00:01:17.280> at<00:01:17.430> a<00:01:17.490> time<00:01:17.700> at

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:18.000 
reading more than one book at a time at

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.850 
reading more than one book at a time at
any<00:01:18.119> given<00:01:18.479> moment<00:01:18.509> and<00:01:19.049> that's<00:01:19.290> totally<00:01:19.380> okay

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:19.860 
any given moment and that's totally okay

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:21.170 
any given moment and that's totally okay
but<00:01:20.130> if<00:01:20.189> you're<00:01:20.280> going<00:01:20.369> to<00:01:20.430> do<00:01:20.549> that<00:01:20.759> my

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
but if you're going to do that my

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.420 
but if you're going to do that my
personal<00:01:22.110> advice<00:01:22.439> is<00:01:22.740> to<00:01:22.799> try<00:01:22.950> to<00:01:23.009> pick<00:01:23.189> books

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:23.430 
personal advice is to try to pick books

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:24.800 
personal advice is to try to pick books
that<00:01:23.670> are<00:01:23.790> really<00:01:24.299> different<00:01:24.450> from<00:01:24.630> each

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
that are really different from each

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:25.969 
that are really different from each
other<00:01:24.930> so<00:01:25.229> that<00:01:25.259> you<00:01:25.409> don't<00:01:25.590> get<00:01:25.740> anything

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
other so that you don't get anything

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.160 
other so that you don't get anything
confused<00:01:26.549> between<00:01:26.759> the<00:01:27.030> two<00:01:27.180> of<00:01:27.299> them<00:01:27.450> lastly

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:28.170 
confused between the two of them lastly

00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:29.569 
confused between the two of them lastly
you're<00:01:28.320> probably<00:01:28.590> just<00:01:28.890> going<00:01:29.009> to<00:01:29.100> shove<00:01:29.310> all

00:01:29.569 --> 00:01:29.579 
you're probably just going to shove all

00:01:29.579 --> 00:01:31.730 
you're probably just going to shove all
