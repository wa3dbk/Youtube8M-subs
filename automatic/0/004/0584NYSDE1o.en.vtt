00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:24.510
 this paper 5 lemons 

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:27.400
 a wooden spoon 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:30.610
 a jar 

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:33.430
 and we're going to need water of course 

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:35.739
 well let's put a cup to heat 

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:38.500
 of water and this is a trick for the 

00:00:35.739 --> 00:00:41.320
 guarapo papelón is perfect because 

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:44.830
 many people put on it is like the juice 

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:46.360
 to the full paper in the water to 

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:50.160
 that goes away decreases that may take 

00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:53.430
 a lot of time instead if your stripes 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:56.100
 the paper or scrape it with a 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:58.610
 knife as the process is streamlined 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.610
 much more 

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:08.820
 this process of dragging the paper 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:13.160
 It seems annoying but that's how it looks 

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:17.150
 much better and dissolves faster and 

00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:17.150
 it saves a lot of time 

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.850
 ah 

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:30.290
 you can also use lightning but for me 

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:32.530
 I find it much easier to use 

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:34.659
 the knife 

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:37.869
 good because it is bald is a measure 

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:40.690
 extremely refreshing a very word 

00:01:37.869 --> 00:01:42.610
 our guarapo and the papelón also 

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:44.950
 although in other countries it is also 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:47.229
 it consumes like in Mexico it's called 

00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:50.290
 piloncillo and in colombia that is told 

00:01:47.229 --> 00:01:53.490
 panela but we are the only ones 

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:53.490
 what do we call it paper 

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:05.220
 and the paper is simply a 

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:08.310
 concentrate of cane juice and the table 

00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:11.330
 Venezuelan is an ingredient of many 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:15.720
 dishes like for example the black roast 

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:19.460
 also in the many desserts and also to 

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:23.430
 sometimes people put up coffee 

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:27.090
 You can also get it in the 

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:30.240
 also hit in the hands or here 

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:33.120
 well this there are endless recipes very 

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:36.590
 our very criollas who use the 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.590
 paper as a tooth 

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:50.380
 now we continue and we will place what 

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:52.860
 that we grate the paper in no 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:52.860
 talk 

00:02:54.730 --> 00:03:01.980
 and we are going to proceed after this 

00:02:57.810 --> 00:03:04.110
 add warm water 

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:07.620
 It should not be too hot though 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:09.830
 this kid quotes because he does and in his 

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.830
 judgment 

00:03:26.819 --> 00:03:30.140
 let's stir 

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:40.410
 meanwhile I'm going to cut the 

00:03:34.900 --> 00:03:40.410
 lemons and this I will put it apart 

00:03:55.870 --> 00:04:03.250
 now I will continue and continue 

00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:07.380
 writing the lemons here 

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:07.380
 in the face 

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:29.320
 and hang them lemon and something diagonal 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:29.320
 it came out much more 

00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:48.380
 and so 

00:04:50.770 --> 00:04:53.770
 Y 

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:57.560
 ah 

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:04.980
 knowing mixing well and now after 

00:05:03.150 --> 00:05:08.180
 I'm going to add water and 

00:05:04.980 --> 00:05:08.180
 pretty free 

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:12.030
 i 

00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:39.500
 both these jars 

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:43.870
 he is known as a vile 

00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:56.409
 and this has been all this is how I 

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:58.599
 I prepare the foil juice with lemon 

00:05:56.409 --> 00:06:01.599
 but that you also do it and what 

00:05:58.599 --> 00:06:05.460
 In good weather enjoy much heat 

00:06:01.599 --> 00:06:05.460
 I'm very refreshing 

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:33.700
 all right
