00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:16.550 
this 2009 Silverado
I<00:00:10.230> think<00:00:11.070> it's<00:00:11.190> 2008<00:00:11.879> or<00:00:12.120> 2009

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:16.560 

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.030 

one<00:00:17.160> thing<00:00:17.400> I<00:00:17.520> had<00:00:17.670> always<00:00:17.940> was<00:00:18.770> this<00:00:19.770> was<00:00:20.010> a

00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:20.040 
one thing I had always was this was a

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:25.280 
one thing I had always was this was a
odd<00:00:20.310> filter<00:00:20.880> size<00:00:21.060> for<00:00:21.360> odd<00:00:22.130> oil<00:00:24.050> drain<00:00:25.050> plug

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:25.290 
odd filter size for odd oil drain plug

00:00:25.290 --> 00:00:29.090 
odd filter size for odd oil drain plug
size<00:00:25.590> for<00:00:25.860> me<00:00:25.980> 13<00:00:26.940> mm<00:00:27.330> a<00:00:27.570> lot<00:00:28.380> of<00:00:28.470> Japanese<00:00:28.860> cars

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:29.100 
size for me 13 mm a lot of Japanese cars

00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:32.480 
size for me 13 mm a lot of Japanese cars
are<00:00:29.280> 14<00:00:29.640> mm<00:00:29.940> I<00:00:30.470> didn't<00:00:31.470> expect<00:00:31.980> this<00:00:32.099> to<00:00:32.160> be<00:00:32.400> in

00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:32.490 
are 14 mm I didn't expect this to be in

00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:35.210 
are 14 mm I didn't expect this to be in
metric<00:00:32.970> so<00:00:33.840> it<00:00:33.960> took<00:00:34.110> me<00:00:34.170> a<00:00:34.290> while<00:00:34.590> to<00:00:34.650> find<00:00:35.100> the

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:35.220 
metric so it took me a while to find the

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:40.490 
metric so it took me a while to find the
right<00:00:35.309> bolt<00:00:36.239> right<00:00:37.140> wrench<00:00:39.170> another<00:00:40.170> thing

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
right bolt right wrench another thing
