00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.919
 good afternoon guys today, 20 of January 

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.910
 now missing for seven minutes at 17 

00:00:07.919 --> 00:00:10.830
 hours 

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.090
 we have just closed the activities in 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.299
 today's day 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:18.000
 today obviously better than yesterday, right? 

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:21.330
 after watching the market on the day of 

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.820
 yesterday consolidate six hours and 38 minutes 

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.050
 today could not be worse yet 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:28.080
 so there were some moments that I 

00:00:25.050 --> 00:00:31.279
 I considered it bad in the morning between 

00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:34.079
 end of the morning and early afternoon 

00:00:31.279 --> 00:00:36.960
 but later in the afternoon he gave some 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:40.460
 other opportunities that saved our 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:43.410
 day and it worked that we did not want 

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:45.149
 for today's launch day and 600 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:49.079
 points practically hit our goal 

00:00:45.149 --> 00:00:53.399
 today we did the eight operations 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:55.770
 those that are on the screen okay and we keep 

00:00:53.399 --> 00:00:58.050
 our discipline did not change anything at all 

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:59.250
 that we did today is different from what 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:02.640
 we did yesterday 

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.110
 yesterday did not have opportunities of the form 

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:06.689
 that we have opportunities today 

00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:10.260
 so had lunchtime trade of 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:12.659
 190 points that the staff did get out together 

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:14.670
 with welinton is who was there with 

00:01:12.659 --> 00:01:18.240
 staff between one and two 

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:20.040
 in the afternoon and added 190 points and there 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.000
 the staff did i did not see what i was 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.020
 lunching 

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:28.350
 but that there went from 66 points there gave 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:31.439
 700 ee in 70 points thing beautiful thing 

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:32.640
 Well then today was an excellent day. 

00:01:31.439 --> 00:01:34.650
 exceptional 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:37.409
 Glory to God, therefore, thank God. 

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:39.150
 We were rewarded for patience 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:43.920
 we had discipline yesterday that we had 

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:48.689
 yesterday we did not get a result 

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:50.729
 Yesterday we wanted but we finished 

00:01:48.689 --> 00:01:53.399
 Yesterday positive, that matters. 

00:01:50.729 --> 00:01:57.149
 and today we think we were 

00:01:53.399 --> 00:02:00.719
 rewarded there by God and the market 

00:01:57.149 --> 00:02:03.570
 then this idea is to explore the 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:07.079
 pivot maximum as long as you quit 

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:09.959
 before only after the target is determined 

00:02:07.079 --> 00:02:13.050
 there for the character does not matter anymore 

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:16.680
 Make the most of it. 

00:02:13.050 --> 00:02:20.010
 the moment the market moves from pivotal to 

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:23.910
 draw points where at the end of a 

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:26.910
 day you have an expressive sum and 

00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:27.900
 gratifying recognition of the 

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:30.960
 your work 

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:34.140
 Okay, when we start the day, we think. 

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:37.050
 us this market will go up one foot a 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:41.910
 maximum of that consolidation yesterday is 

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:44.880
 goes away and a moment here before 

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:47.160
 I already changed my idea of â€‹â€‹lunch 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:49.980
 I commented to our store that the market if it 

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.840
 do not fall he'll walk sideways there for a 

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:54.630
 good time and in fact he walked aside 

00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.930
 until coming back from lunch but had already given 

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:59.400
 an entry into the pivot who had not been 

00:02:56.930 --> 00:03:01.530
 reached the goal 

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:04.110
 then came the goal then was 

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:05.130
 quot walks we did the operation 150 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:07.670
 points 

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:11.820
 this other operation as it is not very 

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:15.180
 beautiful this wave move 2 to 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:18.900
 Instead of going on the pivot target, I get out. 

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:22.200
 with 65 points I made a pivot an escape 

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:25.950
 to really guarantee me 

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:28.050
 protect and then he went on the 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:30.150
 13 from 180 points 

00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:33.420
 Anyway, that's what you could do. 

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:35.370
 we did it was very good, I do not need it 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:37.860
 understand that I do not have whats 

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:40.200
 All the time operating I just need to be 

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:43.530
 operating in the best moments 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:47.840
 it is in the best conditions and this 

00:03:43.530 --> 00:03:51.959
 sums up on and over expect more time 

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:54.300
 observe and analyze and less time to operate 

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:56.160
 I need to get into the operation and I 

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:57.330
 I want to leave as soon as possible since the target 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:59.670
 hit 

00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:02.040
 I do not care to stay 50 minutes. 

00:03:59.670 --> 00:04:04.680
 half an hour on the run when I enter 

00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:07.440
 I want you to go in 10 minutes 51 minutes 

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:09.300
 arrives at my goal and I become one more 

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:10.550
 time you need waiting for the next 

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:13.440
 opportunity 

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:17.130
 and come the next opportunity is 

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:19.680
 then the idea continues this is of 

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:23.550
 exploration of the pivot this week, people 

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:26.610
 understand that only operating pivot gives to 

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:28.919
 achieve expressive results 

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:32.009
 to the extent that you understand this 

00:04:28.919 --> 00:04:35.310
 pivot reasoning you can increase 

00:04:32.009 --> 00:04:38.219
 also its possibilities its 

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:41.310
 alternatives to operations 

00:04:38.219 --> 00:04:44.520
 but when this becomes clear to you the 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:46.650
 which is a pivot operate as a pivot which 

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:50.069
 best way to manage a risk 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:51.990
 pivot operating all other things will become 

00:04:50.069 --> 00:04:56.759
 make it a little easier 

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:59.520
 Okay, so today we did a total of 

00:04:56.759 --> 00:05:05.099
 eight operations as already said the 

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:10.020
 which six were well is a total of 725 

00:05:05.099 --> 00:05:14.250
 points and two of them gave stops and a 

00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:17.310
 total of 145 points in the overall sum ended 

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:18.300
 reaching 580 points with eight operations 

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:20.250
 OK 

00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:22.620
 added to this the result we had 

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:31.500
 yesterday from 45 points 

00:05:22.620 --> 00:05:34.190
 so we now total 625 points 

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:39.599
 yesterday there were four operations so we 

00:05:34.190 --> 00:05:42.539
 we totaled 12 operations 625 points 

00:05:39.599 --> 00:05:45.089
 Good. Let's see tomorrow what the market is. 

00:05:42.539 --> 00:05:48.289
 booking for us no matter what he 

00:05:45.089 --> 00:05:51.509
 do the important is what you do 

00:05:48.289 --> 00:05:54.960
 What is he doing then? 

00:05:51.509 --> 00:05:57.150
 If he leaves tomorrow, we 'll go 

00:05:54.960 --> 00:06:01.469
 buy it if it comes down to us 

00:05:57.150 --> 00:06:03.569
 will sell and we will manage the 

00:06:01.469 --> 00:06:06.750
 risk of our decisions 

00:06:03.569 --> 00:06:08.370
 at all times ok then the fight with a 

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:11.339
 personal hug stays with god 

00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:13.020
 see you tomorrow selling or buying people 

00:06:11.339 --> 00:06:15.830
 is always inside the market 

00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:15.830
 a hug
