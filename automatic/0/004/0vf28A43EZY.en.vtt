00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.400
 tickets sold to a new video video 

00:00:02.779 --> 00:00:06.170
 I think quite interesting interested 

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:08.330
 many people is that the world of cinema 

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:10.730
 it works again with the programs 

00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:12.380
 there is more in this in this video but 

00:00:10.730 --> 00:00:14.240
 many people will know that the mode 

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:15.620
 cinema does not load the videos and it's good that 

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:17.329
 is disabled for the moment 

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:19.849
 supposedly for the stress check 

00:00:17.329 --> 00:00:21.739
 rise from precipitate in will return with the 

00:00:19.849 --> 00:00:23.869
 new patch we assume that patch 

00:00:21.739 --> 00:00:25.849
 will solve the prestige hack to 

00:00:23.869 --> 00:00:27.859
 LujÃ¡n and Nobel and we are going to tell you 

00:00:25.849 --> 00:00:29.880
 clear things the grinch emerged 

00:00:27.859 --> 00:00:32.940
 we can basically go up 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:34.199
 fast top-level not because a 

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.989
 way we can see the vestiges 

00:00:34.199 --> 00:00:39.840
 instants not in just 20 seconds or 

00:00:36.989 --> 00:00:41.579
 30 seconds for being here madrid 

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:43.739
 will return with the next one for kids a 

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:47.610
 clarified of vigo where hopefully it will return with 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:49.170
 the next patch a cinema mode apart from 

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:51.000
 that she is promising several things 

00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:53.190
 you do not know what your friends are going to touch 

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.769
 guns supposedly we do not know just 

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:58.170
 they also sell with this next patch 

00:00:54.769 --> 00:01:00.239
 that we like back in game end have 

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:02.430
 mandate Carlos and supposedly also 

00:01:00.239 --> 00:01:03.629
 they are going to do the hardest 

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.930
 to get 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:08.430
 no more points will be put or what is it that 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:15.200
 they will do but they have to basically 

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:18.570
 not people do not complain logically no and 

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:20.850
 what they do is that way points are added 

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.579
 what they will do or if they lower it 

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.990
 time to the car or what I talk about 

00:01:23.579 --> 00:01:27.329
 let's see to see what happens with 

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:30.810
 they many people are telling me that 

00:01:27.329 --> 00:01:33.090
 What's wrong, they lower me to a level that I do not know 

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.649
 How good a victory we are not going to fuck 

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.850
 or anything but apart I know that many 

00:01:34.649 --> 00:01:38.549
 people are going down digitally 

00:01:35.850 --> 00:01:40.530
 I do not know what the actual 

00:01:38.549 --> 00:01:43.530
 I was going through the warfare 

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:45.869
 3 How to get it fixed call him 

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.819
 activision I believe in the number puts it in 

00:01:45.869 --> 00:01:50.039
 the little book of the game I remember from 

00:01:47.819 --> 00:01:51.450
 Mary and against your problem and such 

00:01:50.039 --> 00:01:52.920
 see what we are told 

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:55.530
 surely you do the ports and 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.270
 all those kind of things really are 

00:01:55.530 --> 00:01:59.700
 complicated things and the best that you 

00:01:57.270 --> 00:02:01.229
 attend a professional and such and each case 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:04.170
 it is different 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:05.549
 each person each router and such is a 

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.950
 different way to see the ports but 

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:09.329
 Well I do not think I do not think that's the 

00:02:07.950 --> 00:02:10.860
 problem had to be to another kind of 

00:02:09.329 --> 00:02:12.599
 thing because really because I was 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:14.010
 enough people that lower it that 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:16.890
 basically there are a few levels and 

00:02:14.010 --> 00:02:18.959
 suddenly you do not have them anymore, I do not know, it's a 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:21.299
 putada really but but good I do not know 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:23.879
 how your area is arranged where it never says 

00:02:21.299 --> 00:02:26.220
 nothing about it that does not say anything about 

00:02:23.879 --> 00:02:27.629
 it and really because everything is a 

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:29.340
 confusion so good we hope the 

00:02:27.629 --> 00:02:31.390
 next patch to if it brings the improvement of 

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.769
 the good ones 

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:35.329
 they will take away a lot of everything 

00:02:33.769 --> 00:02:38.109
 possible to be a way for them to be 

00:02:35.329 --> 00:02:38.109
 more balanced 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:43.920
 along with the assault rifles that's why 

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.840
 it was a way not not possible 

00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:47.670
 for her has basically to lower it is 

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:50.040
 the damage working is all kinds of things 

00:02:47.670 --> 00:02:51.510
 so that people because that kind of weapon 

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:53.940
 but we'll see what they do at the end 

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:56.640
 we go to because I think well seen how 

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:58.790
 is the thing I do not think is that they dare to 

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:03.060
 touch nothing but good they promised 

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:04.830
 we go a few days to take the game and 

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.850
 we will see to see what is happening so 

00:03:04.830 --> 00:03:08.700
 well let's continue waiting for the next 

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:09.780
 patch with the theater mode turn that 

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:12.120
 it's really the only thing we have 

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:14.460
 confirmed we have not confirmed more 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:17.490
 things that are going to take or any type 

00:03:14.460 --> 00:03:19.380
 of things really, I would like that 

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:22.070
 will already include everything in the same patch that 

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:25.560
 they were not there 

00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:26.880
 nothing more kids movie mode than by 

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:28.260
 true there is no date for the next 

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.879
 patch 

00:03:28.260 --> 00:03:31.739
 with which they happened that does a little 

00:03:29.879 --> 00:03:32.909
 embarrassing non -housing takes a date 

00:03:31.739 --> 00:03:37.470
 for the patch because they claim to have 

00:03:32.909 --> 00:03:40.260
 really very fond of it and a 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:41.819
 way to record your things well in 

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.200
 edit cinema mode to record different 

00:03:41.819 --> 00:03:44.790
 cameras and such and really it is a 

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:46.709
 Great Ghanaian bitches enough people 

00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:48.180
 so we kindly take care that 

00:03:46.709 --> 00:03:51.049
 when they take out the next one for china we 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:51.049
 we see in the next video
