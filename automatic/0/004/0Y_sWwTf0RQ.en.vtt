really fun map to play let's talk a
little<00:00:54.930> bit<00:00:55.170> about<00:00:55.320> his<00:00:55.469> class<00:00:55.710> setup<00:00:56.039> within

00:00:56.209 --> 00:00:56.219 
little bit about his class setup within

00:00:56.219 --> 00:00:57.529 
little bit about his class setup within
this<00:00:56.370> gameplay<00:00:56.610> he<00:00:56.910> is<00:00:57.000> using<00:00:57.180> the<00:00:57.360> honey

00:00:57.529 --> 00:00:57.539 
this gameplay he is using the honey

00:00:57.539 --> 00:00:59.060 
this gameplay he is using the honey
badger<00:00:57.750> so<00:00:58.079> obviously<00:00:58.469> it<00:00:58.590> comes<00:00:58.800> in<00:00:58.949> with<00:00:59.039> a

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070 
badger so obviously it comes in with a

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:00.920 
badger so obviously it comes in with a
built-in<00:00:59.430> suppressor<00:00:59.940> and<00:01:00.059> i<00:01:00.420> did<00:01:00.600> notice<00:01:00.719> he

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:00.930 
built-in suppressor and i did notice he

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:02.270 
built-in suppressor and i did notice he
was<00:01:00.960> running<00:01:01.289> extended<00:01:01.770> mags<00:01:01.920> on<00:01:02.129> there

was running extended mags on there

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.799 
was running extended mags on there
pretty<00:01:02.550> obvious<00:01:02.969> why<00:01:03.090> he<00:01:03.270> wants<00:01:03.510> to<00:01:03.570> run<00:01:03.660> that

00:01:03.799 --> 00:01:03.809 
pretty obvious why he wants to run that

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:05.179 
pretty obvious why he wants to run that
i'm<00:01:03.930> not<00:01:03.960> exactly<00:01:04.320> sure<00:01:04.500> if<00:01:04.650> he's<00:01:04.890> running

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:03.510 
man this gameplay was really really born

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:05.810 
man this gameplay was really really born
to<00:03:03.630> watch<00:03:03.780> that's<00:03:04.500> only<00:03:04.650> that's<00:03:05.220> only<00:03:05.370> a<00:03:05.460> small

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:05.820 
to watch that's only that's only a small

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:08.510 
to watch that's only that's only a small
portion<00:03:06.120> of<00:03:06.660> your<00:03:07.440> actual<00:03:07.890> audience<00:03:08.190> so<00:03:08.400> it's

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:08.520 
portion of your actual audience so it's

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:10.250 
portion of your actual audience so it's
not<00:03:08.640> really<00:03:08.850> necessary<00:03:08.970> in<00:03:09.450> my<00:03:09.570> opinion<00:03:09.870> to<00:03:10.140> go

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:10.260 
not really necessary in my opinion to go

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:11.990 
not really necessary in my opinion to go
out<00:03:10.320> and<00:03:10.560> change<00:03:11.040> everything<00:03:11.250> just<00:03:11.730> because

out and change everything just because

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.460
