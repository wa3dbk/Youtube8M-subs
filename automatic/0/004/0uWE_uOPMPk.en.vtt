00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:30.109

 you do not hide it I had them all fm 

00:03:31.849 --> 00:03:36.319
 then I put them in hd view if it's me 

00:03:34.609 --> 00:03:38.090
 was not relaxing and girls had 

00:03:36.319 --> 00:03:40.340
 postulated but I got but it was 

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:42.139
 already a player who prevents you from life 

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:44.599
 did not even have a hard front I got 

00:03:42.139 --> 00:03:45.739
 I'm saying good we're going all the time 

00:03:44.599 --> 00:03:47.450

 last two names and the last one comes 

00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:05.599
 so we would have had a chic cpm 

00:04:03.439 --> 00:04:07.879
 on the thirty four rings the bear 

00:04:05.599 --> 00:04:10.760
 so it's really blue naze it 

00:04:07.879 --> 00:04:12.379
 readjust then find what it takes 

00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:17.630
 to be slow enough but now 

00:04:12.379 --> 00:04:19.760

00:04:17.630 --> 00:04:23.240
 32 31 30 

00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:25.699
 without thinking of the 28th attempts so ben 

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:28.310
