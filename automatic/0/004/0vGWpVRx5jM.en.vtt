00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:32.720
 Dollars last year application examples taken from the team 

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:35.330
 demonstrate 

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:37.800
 We have the character first 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.350
 there opening and rushed to the left 

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:42.780
 and it's a blast of porn that 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:43.900
 it is wonderful 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:45.780
 Vondra 

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:48.970
 We always do compliant but legally not check 

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:51.970
 Protect said is feasible 

00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:55.880
 for example 

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:59.740
 with the tape 

00:00:59.740 --> 00:01:02.420
 from the thrust 

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:04.170
 I thank you numbers 

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:07.680
 you can not do this necessarily after the state election instead after 

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:08.300
 Left 

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:11.270
 and it may be that in the defense 

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:12.970
 but that does not have to be 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:14.530
 I can owe it 

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:15.620
 that's how it would be 

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:16.520
 to do in step 

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:20.140
 1 and that would be because then it would already be against 

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.750
 and the trouble is in place offered 

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:27.110
 so we do different things 

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.120
 then he will have the opportunity to have the list warm 

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:31.190
 Smartlinx 

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:32.630
 nobody at first 

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:34.310
 Pietro 

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:35.560
 that you old lady 

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:38.560
 that would come with the APA 

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:45.860
 I could 

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:49.070
 anyway 

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:50.740
 he'll tell everyone 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:53.610
 or to say honestly i can be very good 

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:56.750
 we have different things 

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.650
 that they stop 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:01.740
 with the hand 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:04.740
 I also found SUVs 

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.500
 where you just learned from the principle 

00:02:11.049 --> 00:02:14.049
 also build 

00:02:21.579 --> 00:02:24.749
 quite a few guns to the left one can still think as the opponent 

00:02:25.499 --> 00:02:27.509
 from which deadlines moved to the left 

00:02:27.509 --> 00:02:30.769
 and it would be a step 

00:02:30.769 --> 00:02:33.769
 Precious we will afterwards 

00:02:36.229 --> 00:02:39.339
 that we in the defense and I renounce Ki Ka 

00:02:39.339 --> 00:02:42.339
 and that's why we're still watching there 

00:02:43.969 --> 00:02:47.239
 Protecting suddenly says something different 

00:02:47.239 --> 00:02:49.129
 that we are here too 

00:02:49.129 --> 00:02:52.129
 Protecting the process does not necessarily mean enforcing it 

00:02:52.929 --> 00:02:54.409
 on the body 

00:02:54.409 --> 00:02:56.249
 but you can of course also with us 

00:02:56.249 --> 00:02:59.259
 while getting some good mood 

00:02:59.259 --> 00:03:01.309
 and as I said, I am 

00:03:01.309 --> 00:03:02.519
 there are still some 

00:03:02.519 --> 00:03:04.409
 Meckenbeuren in attack 

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:07.469
 Frank, though it's too tight of course, elbows 

00:03:07.469 --> 00:03:09.159
 then only good 

00:03:09.159 --> 00:03:10.719
 second, by hand 

00:03:10.719 --> 00:03:13.719
 different things that would be protected 

00:03:16.119 --> 00:03:18.509
 Score a goal 

00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:21.279
 according to the church law of back 

00:03:21.279 --> 00:03:22.899
 answer for 

00:03:22.899 --> 00:03:25.899
 more Bera 

00:03:29.029 --> 00:03:32.029
 or wrap up 

00:03:34.399 --> 00:03:35.759
 go down like that 

00:03:35.759 --> 00:03:38.249
 here and there you are raised 

00:03:38.249 --> 00:03:41.569
 the most typical official noticed Bonn 

00:03:41.569 --> 00:03:44.869
 and if lucky enough to build leaves with barriers 

00:03:45.909 --> 00:03:48.719
 can be very good 

00:03:48.719 --> 00:03:50.139
 Per Mertesacker 

00:03:50.139 --> 00:03:52.959
 because then as well as vomiting 

00:03:52.959 --> 00:03:55.189
 Businessman thigh 

00:03:55.189 --> 00:03:57.069
 and of course, then thanks 

00:03:57.069 --> 00:04:00.159
 or as well as can and could keep 

00:04:00.159 --> 00:04:03.159
 Of course that's a really important topic 

00:04:04.729 --> 00:04:08.589
 soon but to do again on what should happen so I would have to with 

00:04:08.589 --> 00:04:09.719
 to press 

00:04:09.719 --> 00:04:12.839
 that's why I learned and worked well 

00:04:12.839 --> 00:04:17.099
 Real Madrid actually works well and he is coming to the exit 

00:04:18.109 --> 00:04:20.159
 that is then would be pressing 

00:04:20.159 --> 00:04:23.080
 and Röttgen is with both hands 

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:26.080
 Of course I can do it differently 

00:04:28.999 --> 00:04:31.999
 Citigroup fell 

00:04:33.499 --> 00:04:35.719
 Hambühren at Celle 

00:04:35.719 --> 00:04:39.099
 Although I have not taken any more away from here 

00:04:39.099 --> 00:04:42.529
 then we have behind him 

00:04:42.529 --> 00:04:45.529
 Crane is always very 

00:04:50.659 --> 00:04:53.659
 she is very critical 

00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:56.699
 quite typical 

00:04:56.699 --> 00:04:58.289
 this position 

00:04:58.289 --> 00:05:01.289
 and that is a martial art is sought 

00:05:01.999 --> 00:05:05.199
 because, first of all, the ceiling was gone 

00:05:05.199 --> 00:05:08.300
 and second, it can do very well 

00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:09.600
 without you still acting
