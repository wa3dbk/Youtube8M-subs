00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:12.870
 Oh, now is the age of women . 

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:18.150
 The men woke the dance magazine made for women halgeol nothing all 

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:25.019
 It's a society, so I know what it's like to work with women. 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:27.350
 If we do what we are now , the great synergy is different . 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:27.350
 That's it. 

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:36.610
 But we're going to have to look at it a little while. 

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:43.050
 We did not get treated well why can not it if I think so Written 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:43.050
 Women can not find what they really need to do. 

00:00:43.089 --> 00:00:48.809
 If he finds out about it, he will not do it badly . 

00:00:49.510 --> 00:00:55.500
 I now played an intelligent one makes it so badly treated by companies not 

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:55.500
 It's possible 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:01:04.500
 I mean, you need a little effort. 

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:05.430
 Women should try to find a job to do some real work 

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:10.380
 You must 

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:14.460
 So we have to do what we do and we have to be treated g 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:16.710
 Haejuneunde not the enemy force is something we dont remove this contradiction 

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:19.920
 There is 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:24.510
 Society has to do it for itself . 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:30.390
 I'm telling you that we do not have a living room here. 

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:31.950
 Something you can not do now with your ability to show up and let's do something now . 

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:35.780
 I'm doing it. 

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:39.329
 This has to be re-quantified . 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:39.329

00:01:55.070 --> 00:02:02.340
 The researchers let's not where we are. So this research is research 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:08.690
 It is. 

00:02:02.340 --> 00:02:13.790
 Well, I'm not doing this kind of research, I'm doing things I do not have right now .

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:21.200
 This is not a hedge study. 

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:27.230
 You want to change the nature of your research. 

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:32.780
 I'm picking up a research team here and working on the same thing. 

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:37.220
 We have created a research team and have done 10, 

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:41.870
 The radius of action varies. 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:46.220

 No researchers, no beef, no where to drink, no research 

00:03:12.069 --> 00:03:15.599
 This is good as a company in the end 

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:21.680
 That's huge. Yeah. 

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:27.829
 It's simple, it's not wrong. 

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:31.180
 This is all outside, and this company is actually working. 

00:03:27.829 --> 00:03:37.959
 A lot of research done outside . 

00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:41.590
 If you do something good, you can do it 100 times. 

00:03:37.959 --> 00:03:46.000
 Work and our human resources 

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:48.510
 Well, I do not know how to do this. 

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.510
 I will. 

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:59.590
 We'll see what we've missed on something. So women 

00:03:55.210 --> 00:04:01.900
 I'll go outside when I get up and things happen. 

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:07.300
 You do not do it at work. 

00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:10.030

 The boys are done with picking them up. They go out and meet friends and they belong. 

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:20.709
 This is a pain in the ass. 

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:23.790
 Women's human resources are not. 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:23.790
 I can send you home 

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:32.130
 I'm worried about this. This is the company. 

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:38.310
 So it's a girl to study. 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:40.300
 Women pay utmost studies men derives its research into rows based on yiraneunge That 

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:43.850
 A man. 

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:43.850
 [music] 

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:59.650
 Not your car and I'll know what's what 

00:04:53.860 --> 00:05:04.810
 Now unfairly unfairly with our women and men now in the company 

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:07.000
 What I think is that you are not supposed to be there. 

00:05:04.810 --> 00:05:11.110
 I'm going to tell the story 

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:14.260
 This must be someone's not such a thing as geureongeol the word petrified 

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:20.020
 Because you 're being treated like that right now. 

00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:23.229
 Uh, which people do when unduly me now so it hurts my heart 

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:25.870
 The person who receives it hurts my heart. 

00:05:23.229 --> 00:05:29.139
 So who is the patient? 

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:35.340
 How can I do this? 

00:05:29.139 --> 00:05:39.510
 If you're going to be frustrated that you can not have something now relax in your seat 

00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:40.230
 Uh, I now so treat that person who solved the cramped Aya 

00:05:39.510 --> 00:05:44.130
 That's it. 

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:47.640
 This means you have to solve this person. 

00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:53.160
 Why are I in this position? 

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:56.510
 I have to solve this . Why can not I have this ? 

00:05:53.160 --> 00:06:02.389
 What are you 

00:05:56.510 --> 00:06:05.240
 So if you do not want to hear me, I must have gone. 

00:06:02.389 --> 00:06:09.650
 If you want to make people better in the future, 

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:12.129
 I can not stop what I can not do Why stay in this position 

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:17.240
 He's complaining. 

00:06:12.129 --> 00:06:22.130
 I hear that it's becoming a thing is ignorant that complain 

00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:23.600
 You complain about the society . You are saying that you are ignorant in that field now 

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:29.510
 It is. 

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:31.940
 Uh, if you're writing an ignorant knowledge as a child, but not with the absolute knowledge 

00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:35.630
 I do not accept such hospitality. 

00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:40.330
 I would give you that if you are not right now. 

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:45.340
 I can not seem to get what I have. 

00:06:40.330 --> 00:06:48.430
 Why do we continue to pay the boss even if we receive the money of the economy? 

00:06:45.340 --> 00:06:52.169
 Did you stop at the thought that you should get it ? 

00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:52.169
 So you guys can not make progress. 

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:54.370
 U 

00:06:54.470 --> 00:07:05.279
 Why only now and whether you mean you have to live amicably 

00:06:59.639 --> 00:07:07.109
 Here I am creating something here and here I go, 

00:07:05.279 --> 00:07:12.719
 I have to listen. 

00:07:07.109 --> 00:07:17.129
 So I stopped and I said, " How do you keep your company right now?" 

00:07:12.719 --> 00:07:20.519
 The company is putting the basic things on you guys. 

00:07:17.129 --> 00:07:26.059
 The skills that are now falling gonna need y'all done 

00:07:20.519 --> 00:07:26.059
 It's frustrating because we can not find the yard . 

00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:35.400
 This does not lead 

00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:36.539
 The answer is yes, you can not solve the frustration 

00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:42.030
 Thing 

00:07:36.539 --> 00:07:44.389
 If you find good conditions in place and find that I can not do something 

00:07:42.030 --> 00:07:44.389
 have 

00:07:44.390 --> 00:07:50.680
 When a woman demonstrates her ability ,
