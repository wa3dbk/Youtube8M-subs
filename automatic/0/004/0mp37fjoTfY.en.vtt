game<00:01:53.729> will<00:01:53.880> be<00:01:53.970> called<00:01:54.149> Medal<00:01:54.390> of<00:01:54.450> Honor

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
game will be called Medal of Honor

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:56.209 
game will be called Medal of Honor
Warfighter<00:01:54.810> and<00:01:55.380> what<00:01:55.829> do<00:01:55.890> I<00:01:55.979> think<00:01:56.009> about

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
Warfighter and what do I think about

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.160 
Warfighter and what do I think about
that<00:01:56.399> I<00:01:56.909> it's<00:01:57.630> okay

00:01:58.160 --> 00:01:58.170 
that I it's okay

00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:00.230 
that I it's okay
I<00:01:58.200> don't<00:01:58.979> really<00:01:59.219> dig<00:01:59.520> the<00:01:59.670> title<00:01:59.969> all<00:02:00.090> that

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:00.240 
I don't really dig the title all that

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:01.639 
I don't really dig the title all that
much<00:02:00.479> and<00:02:00.780> the<00:02:00.869> reason<00:02:01.140> for<00:02:01.170> that<00:02:01.290> is<00:02:01.469> because

00:02:01.639 --> 00:02:01.649 
much and the reason for that is because

00:02:01.649 --> 00:02:04.580 
much and the reason for that is because
to<00:02:02.520> me<00:02:02.729> Medal<00:02:03.210> of<00:02:03.270> Honor<00:02:03.420> Warfighter<00:02:03.689> sounds

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:04.590 
to me Medal of Honor Warfighter sounds

00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:06.109 
to me Medal of Honor Warfighter sounds
kind<00:02:04.770> of<00:02:04.799> like<00:02:04.950> an<00:02:05.070> expansion<00:02:05.610> pack<00:02:05.759> to<00:02:05.790> Medal

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:06.119 
kind of like an expansion pack to Medal

00:02:06.119 --> 00:02:09.139 
kind of like an expansion pack to Medal
of<00:02:06.180> Honor<00:02:06.329> 2010<00:02:07.020> it<00:02:07.680> sounds<00:02:07.979> like<00:02:08.099> a<00:02:08.129> DLC<00:02:08.910> that

00:02:09.139 --> 00:02:09.149 
of Honor 2010 it sounds like a DLC that

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.540 
of Honor 2010 it sounds like a DLC that
would<00:02:09.270> contain<00:02:09.660> like<00:02:09.899> a<00:02:09.929> few<00:02:10.259> extra<00:02:10.709> missions

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:11.550 
would contain like a few extra missions

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:12.770 
would contain like a few extra missions
for<00:02:11.700> the<00:02:11.760> campaign

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780 
for the campaign

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.750 
for the campaign
I<00:02:12.870> don't<00:02:13.620> know<00:02:13.709> I<00:02:13.920> think<00:02:14.220> it's<00:02:14.459> a<00:02:14.550> cool

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760 
I don't know I think it's a cool

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:17.059 
I don't know I think it's a cool
sounding<00:02:15.270> name<00:02:15.480> don't<00:02:15.720> get<00:02:15.840> me<00:02:15.930> wrong<00:02:16.110> it

00:02:17.059 --> 00:02:17.069 
sounding name don't get me wrong it

00:02:17.069 --> 00:02:18.980 
sounding name don't get me wrong it
could<00:02:17.250> have<00:02:17.340> come<00:02:17.400> up<00:02:17.459> with<00:02:17.610> much<00:02:17.790> worse<00:02:18.000> but

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:18.990 
could have come up with much worse but

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:21.110 
could have come up with much worse but
it<00:02:19.740> doesn't<00:02:20.069> sound<00:02:20.220> like<00:02:20.340> a<00:02:20.370> sequel<00:02:20.730> game<00:02:20.910> to

00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:21.120 
it doesn't sound like a sequel game to

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:23.780 
it doesn't sound like a sequel game to
me<00:02:21.240> that's<00:02:21.390> all<00:02:22.310> well<00:02:23.310> I<00:02:23.370> don't<00:02:23.430> mean<00:02:23.580> at<00:02:23.700> the

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:23.790 
me that's all well I don't mean at the

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:25.490 
me that's all well I don't mean at the
same<00:02:23.940> time<00:02:24.209> I<00:02:24.450> didn't<00:02:24.660> like<00:02:24.810> medal<00:02:25.050> of<00:02:25.110> honor<00:02:25.260> -

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:25.500 
same time I didn't like medal of honor -

00:02:25.500 --> 00:02:26.900 
same time I didn't like medal of honor -

whatsoever if they called it that I

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:28.160 
whatsoever if they called it that I
would<00:02:27.180> have<00:02:27.270> been<00:02:27.360> pretty<00:02:27.510> upset<00:02:27.630> because

would have been pretty upset because

00:02:28.170 --> 00:02:30.470 
would have been pretty upset because
that<00:02:28.410> is<00:02:28.590> absolutely<00:02:28.830> lame<00:02:29.459> like<00:02:29.819> come<00:02:30.180> on<00:02:30.270> you

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:36.630 
all that much but in general it's

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:41.390 
all that much but in general it's
alright<00:02:38.120> so<00:02:39.120> that's<00:02:40.020> the<00:02:40.140> title<00:02:40.560> and<00:02:41.010> the

00:02:41.390 --> 00:02:41.400 
alright so that's the title and the

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:43.040

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:45.680 
cover looks pretty cool I won't lie I
think<00:02:43.830> I<00:02:44.430> took<00:02:44.730> a<00:02:44.790> quick<00:02:44.970> look<00:02:45.000> at<00:02:45.330> it<00:02:45.540> looks

00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:45.690 
think I took a quick look at it looks

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:47.870 
think I took a quick look at it looks
pretty<00:02:45.870> good<00:02:46.019> I<00:02:46.260> think<00:02:47.130> they're<00:02:47.400> gonna<00:02:47.519> try<00:02:47.850> to

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:47.880 
pretty good I think they're gonna try to

00:02:47.880 --> 00:02:49.729 
pretty good I think they're gonna try to
make<00:02:48.180> a<00:02:48.420> lot<00:02:48.600> of<00:02:48.630> the<00:02:48.750> focus<00:02:48.959> on<00:02:49.230> the<00:02:49.320> campaign

00:02:49.729 --> 00:02:49.739 
make a lot of the focus on the campaign

00:02:49.739 --> 00:02:50.990 
make a lot of the focus on the campaign
which<00:02:49.980> i<00:02:50.100> think<00:02:50.160> is<00:02:50.340> cool<00:02:50.550> because<00:02:50.730> I<00:02:50.940> think

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:51.000 
which i think is cool because I think

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:52.790 
which i think is cool because I think
the<00:02:51.180> campaign<00:02:51.510> the<00:02:51.630> Medal<00:02:51.840> of<00:02:51.870> Honor<00:02:51.959> 2010<00:02:52.650> was

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800 
the campaign the Medal of Honor 2010 was

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.680 
the campaign the Medal of Honor 2010 was
absolutely<00:02:53.220> fantastic<00:02:53.390> obviously<00:02:54.390> just<00:02:54.570> too

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:54.690 
absolutely fantastic obviously just too

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:57.080 
absolutely fantastic obviously just too
short<00:02:54.959> and<00:02:55.230> I<00:02:56.010> agree<00:02:56.280> with<00:02:56.400> basically<00:02:56.760> whoever

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:57.090 
short and I agree with basically whoever

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:59.300 
short and I agree with basically whoever
has<00:02:57.300> played<00:02:57.480> this<00:02:57.630> game<00:02:57.870> ever<00:02:58.230> knows<00:02:59.069> that<00:02:59.190> the

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.310 
has played this game ever knows that the

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:01.490 
has played this game ever knows that the
campaign<00:02:59.550> is<00:02:59.610> too<00:02:59.850> short<00:03:00.090> so<00:03:00.500> hopefully

00:03:01.490 --> 00:03:01.500 
campaign is too short so hopefully

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:03.110 
campaign is too short so hopefully
they'll<00:03:01.739> expand<00:03:02.340> it<00:03:02.459> a<00:03:02.519> little<00:03:02.550> bit<00:03:02.880> in<00:03:03.000> the

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.120 
they'll expand it a little bit in the

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.910 
they'll expand it a little bit in the
second<00:03:03.450> game<00:03:03.569> because<00:03:04.290> it<00:03:04.410> was<00:03:04.500> really<00:03:04.739> good

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:04.920 
second game because it was really good

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:16.650

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:19.240 
please I am so sick of the Unreal Engine
like<00:03:16.980> I<00:03:17.250> thought<00:03:17.790> I<00:03:17.850> was<00:03:18.000> done<00:03:18.239> with<00:03:18.390> it<00:03:18.570> after

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:19.250 
like I thought I was done with it after

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:22.460 
like I thought I was done with it after
Rainbow<00:03:20.250> Six<00:03:20.519> Vegas<00:03:20.610> -<00:03:21.120> but<00:03:21.930> I<00:03:21.959> guess<00:03:22.260> not

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:22.470 
Rainbow Six Vegas - but I guess not

00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:24.560 
Rainbow Six Vegas - but I guess not
because<00:03:23.100> this<00:03:23.579> game<00:03:23.850> had<00:03:24.090> it<00:03:24.239> in<00:03:24.299> the<00:03:24.390> campaign

00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:24.570 
because this game had it in the campaign

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:27.830 
because this game had it in the campaign
and<00:03:25.140> I<00:03:25.410> just<00:03:26.100> don't<00:03:26.310> like<00:03:26.489> it<00:03:26.760> I<00:03:27.000> think<00:03:27.660> it<00:03:27.720> just

00:03:27.830 --> 00:03:27.840 
and I just don't like it I think it just

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:28.729 
and I just don't like it I think it just

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:30.180 
I mean well during the game the

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:31.550 
I mean well during the game the
cinematics<00:03:30.840> in<00:03:31.019> the<00:03:31.110> campaign<00:03:31.470> were

00:03:31.550 --> 00:03:31.560 
cinematics in the campaign were

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.229 
cinematics in the campaign were
absolutely<00:03:32.010> fantastic<00:03:32.160> they<00:03:32.820> looked<00:03:33.030> awesome

00:03:33.229 --> 00:03:33.239 
absolutely fantastic they looked awesome

00:03:33.239 --> 00:03:35.120 
absolutely fantastic they looked awesome
except<00:03:34.110> for<00:03:34.230> the<00:03:34.290> character<00:03:34.650> models<00:03:35.010> they

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.130 
except for the character models they

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:36.800 
except for the character models they
could<00:03:35.459> use<00:03:35.610> a<00:03:35.640> little<00:03:35.880> bit<00:03:36.000> more<00:03:36.150> work<00:03:36.360> but<00:03:36.390> I

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:36.810 
could use a little bit more work but I

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:39.110 
could use a little bit more work but I
mean<00:03:37.440> the<00:03:37.530> gameplay<00:03:37.920> itself<00:03:38.280> with<00:03:38.760> Unreal

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:39.120 
mean the gameplay itself with Unreal

00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:41.930 
mean the gameplay itself with Unreal
Engine<00:03:39.239> 6<00:03:39.660> was<00:03:39.959> just<00:03:40.200> not<00:03:40.380> good<00:03:40.680> it<00:03:41.549> was<00:03:41.700> just

00:03:41.930 --> 00:03:41.940 
Engine 6 was just not good it was just

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:44.330 
Engine 6 was just not good it was just
it<00:03:42.209> was<00:03:42.420> not<00:03:42.750> good<00:03:42.930> I<00:03:43.170> really<00:03:43.920> hope<00:03:44.070> they<00:03:44.220> use

00:03:44.330 --> 00:03:44.340 
it was not good I really hope they use

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:47.449
