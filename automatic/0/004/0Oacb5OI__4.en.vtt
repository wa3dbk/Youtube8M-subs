less<00:00:36.510> it<00:00:36.720> holds<00:00:36.930> a<00:00:36.960> couple<00:00:37.199> more<00:00:37.320> rounds<00:00:37.500> it's

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
less it holds a couple more rounds it's

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:39.799 
less it holds a couple more rounds it's

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:47.960 
move forward over here we have the XDS

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.719 
move forward over here we have the XDS
four-point-oh<00:00:48.960> and<00:00:49.260> I<00:00:49.890> see<00:00:50.190> one<00:00:50.400> that<00:00:50.610> we<00:00:50.699> saw

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:50.729 
four-point-oh and I see one that we saw

00:00:50.729 --> 00:00:53.119 
four-point-oh and I see one that we saw
last<00:00:51.150> year<00:00:51.479> but<00:00:51.690> I<00:00:51.780> also<00:00:51.930> see<00:00:52.049> a<00:00:52.170> new<00:00:52.350> one<00:00:52.500> last

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 
last year but I also see a new one last

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.579 
last year but I also see a new one last
year<00:00:53.309> we<00:00:53.400> introduced<00:00:53.699> the<00:00:54.059> XDS<00:00:54.510> with<00:00:54.809> a<00:00:54.839> 3.3

00:00:55.579 --> 00:00:55.589 
year we introduced the XDS with a 3.3

00:00:55.589 --> 00:00:57.320 
year we introduced the XDS with a 3.3
inch<00:00:55.710> barrel<00:00:56.040> and<00:00:56.129> 9<00:00:56.280> millimeter<00:00:56.699> we<00:00:57.119> now

00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:57.330

00:00:59.420 --> 00:00:59.430 
offer that in a four-inch barrel and

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.450 
offer that in a four-inch barrel and
what<00:00:59.909> that's<00:01:00.059> really<00:01:00.360> for<00:01:00.690> is<00:01:01.190> the<00:01:02.190> gun<00:01:02.339> has

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:02.460 
what that's really for is the gun has

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.609 
what that's really for is the gun has
been<00:01:02.610> very<00:01:02.909> popular<00:01:03.239> to<00:01:03.510> say<00:01:03.839> the<00:01:04.140> least<00:01:04.170> and

00:01:04.609 --> 00:01:04.619 
been very popular to say the least and

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:06.440 
been very popular to say the least and
it<00:01:05.190> was<00:01:05.280> designed<00:01:05.400> as<00:01:05.640> a<00:01:05.700> concealed<00:01:06.030> carry<00:01:06.119> gun

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
it was designed as a concealed carry gun

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:07.880 
it was designed as a concealed carry gun
but<00:01:06.720> there's<00:01:06.900> some<00:01:06.990> other<00:01:07.080> features<00:01:07.530> about<00:01:07.680> it

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
but there's some other features about it

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.070 
but there's some other features about it
kind<00:01:08.100> of<00:01:08.159> cross<00:01:08.430> over<00:01:08.880> to<00:01:08.909> the<00:01:09.240> general<00:01:09.869> use

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:10.080 
kind of cross over to the general use

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.140 
kind of cross over to the general use
and<00:01:10.320> that<00:01:10.860> is<00:01:11.010> it's<00:01:11.159> very<00:01:11.220> thin<00:01:11.729> it's<00:01:11.940> very

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.150 
and that is it's very thin it's very

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.360 
and that is it's very thin it's very
light<00:01:12.480> so<00:01:13.080> when<00:01:13.200> you<00:01:13.290> take<00:01:13.500> that<00:01:13.680> same<00:01:13.920> basic

00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:14.370 
light so when you take that same basic

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:15.860 
light so when you take that same basic
gun<00:01:14.580> and<00:01:14.880> add<00:01:15.090> a<00:01:15.120> little<00:01:15.360> bit<00:01:15.510> of<00:01:15.570> barrel

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:15.870 
gun and add a little bit of barrel

00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:17.450 
gun and add a little bit of barrel
length<00:01:16.050> you<00:01:16.200> get<00:01:16.320> some<00:01:16.470> sight<00:01:16.710> radius<00:01:17.100> you<00:01:17.310> get

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:17.460 
length you get some sight radius you get

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:19.430 
length you get some sight radius you get
a<00:01:17.490> little<00:01:17.640> more<00:01:17.820> forward<00:01:18.120> weight<00:01:18.420> to<00:01:18.630> it<00:01:18.780> and

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:19.440 
a little more forward weight to it and

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:20.990 
a little more forward weight to it and
it<00:01:19.560> makes<00:01:19.770> it<00:01:19.890> a<00:01:19.980> great<00:01:20.190> gun<00:01:20.520> for<00:01:20.700> some<00:01:20.820> of<00:01:20.910> the

00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:21.000 
it makes it a great gun for some of the

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.990 
it makes it a great gun for some of the
small<00:01:21.270> hands<00:01:21.810> or<00:01:21.930> wants<00:01:22.710> this<00:01:23.160> basic<00:01:23.610> package

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
small hands or wants this basic package

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.040 
small hands or wants this basic package
but<00:01:24.150> isn't<00:01:24.420> really<00:01:24.600> looking<00:01:24.840> for<00:01:24.990> the

00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:25.050 
but isn't really looking for the

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:26.870 
but isn't really looking for the
concealment<00:01:25.440> portion<00:01:26.040> of<00:01:26.160> it<00:01:26.280> so<00:01:26.730> it's<00:01:26.850> a

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:26.880 
concealment portion of it so it's a

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.460 
concealment portion of it so it's a
little<00:01:26.940> bit<00:01:27.120> easier<00:01:27.570> to<00:01:27.630> shoot<00:01:27.960> a<00:01:28.170> little

00:01:28.460 --> 00:01:28.470 
little bit easier to shoot a little

00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:30.320 
little bit easier to shoot a little
heavier<00:01:28.890> points<00:01:29.760> a<00:01:29.820> little<00:01:30.030> bit<00:01:30.150> better

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:30.330 
heavier points a little bit better

00:01:30.330 --> 00:01:32.180 
heavier points a little bit better
little<00:01:30.840> easier<00:01:31.500> to<00:01:31.530> aim<00:01:31.680> because<00:01:31.890> a<00:01:31.980> long

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:32.190 
little easier to aim because a long

00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:33.710 
little easier to aim because a long
sight<00:01:32.490> radius<00:01:32.820> it<00:01:33.150> has<00:01:33.270> all<00:01:33.420> the<00:01:33.510> same

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:33.720 
sight radius it has all the same

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.510 
sight radius it has all the same
features<00:01:34.110> has<00:01:34.290> the<00:01:34.410> same<00:01:34.620> frame<00:01:34.950> these<00:01:35.370> are

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:35.520 
features has the same frame these are

00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:38.510 
features has the same frame these are
the<00:01:35.580> same<00:01:35.820> magazine<00:01:36.060> just<00:01:36.450> a<00:01:36.570> 3.3<00:01:37.310> perfect<00:01:38.310> and

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:38.520 
the same magazine just a 3.3 perfect and

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:39.830 
the same magazine just a 3.3 perfect and
do<00:01:38.610> you<00:01:38.670> know<00:01:38.730> what<00:01:38.970> these<00:01:39.150> are<00:01:39.330> starting<00:01:39.690> out

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840 
do you know what these are starting out

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.630
