00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.449
 we must make series of communes of 

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:05.879
 repetitions if the goal of becoming 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:06.690
 louder with this video during 

00:00:05.879 --> 00:00:08.760
 a few seconds 

00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:10.590
 think a bit and then answer the 

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:12.030
 question by beating the comments and 

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:14.160
 I guarantee you that your answer will not be 

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:23.220
 not the same as mine and this is the case 

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:24.449
 bravo in this video I'm not going to 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:27.060
 give clear and precise answers 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:28.619
 because it did not exist it will be just 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.689
 some ideas and then it's up to you 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.279
 make your own conclusion a lot of 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:34.200
 people are not able to define is 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:35.910
 very strong and it's very normal 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.129
 if I can do 20 pumps 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.989
 in a row and you finally arrive at 25 

00:00:38.129 --> 00:00:42.750
 theoretically you're stronger than me 

00:00:39.989 --> 00:00:44.340
 agrees but at the same time 

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.260
 which is very possible if I am able 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.120
 to make a repetition at 120 kg at 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:50.520
 bench press and you come to in 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:52.140
 do a 310 then what are you 

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:54.030
 always stronger than me or in these 

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:55.739
 case it's me the strongest a lot 

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:57.510
 will say that it is me the strongest because 

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:59.520
 I get to carry heavier and that's 

00:00:57.510 --> 00:01:01.109
 fake me I'm stronger to wear 

00:00:59.520 --> 00:01:03.510
 a heavier weight on a repeat 

00:01:01.109 --> 00:01:04.860
 are a specific exercise and you are 

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:06.420
 stronger to make a lot of 

00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.189
 repetitions on another exercise 

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.720
 if you manage to make more points than 

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:12.000
 me and I can do more 

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:13.710
 traction which is the strongest you see 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.790
 it's very difficult and being strong is 

00:01:13.710 --> 00:01:16.110
 long-term truce 

00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:17.520
 that's why you can not 

00:01:16.110 --> 00:01:18.420
 really a jazz open the stage for 

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.040
 work the force 

00:01:18.420 --> 00:01:21.960
 you see the room to work a 

00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:24.570
 movement or to work an exercise 

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:26.970
 just not here and I have these examples 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:28.500
 heart could be stronger he 

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:30.990
 must make series of intel number of 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:33.119
 fixed repetitions it must be said that for 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.220
 to be stronger you have to make series 

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:37.619
 of intel number of fixed repetitions is 

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.420
 wrong if you train only with 

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:41.220
 series of 10 repetitions you will be 

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:43.049
 strong with series of 10 repetitions 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.000
 if you train with series 

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:46.710
 strait you'll be strong with sets of 

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.090
 three repetitions someone who 

00:01:46.710 --> 00:01:50.939
 only train with sets 

00:01:48.090 --> 00:01:53.310
 of 10 will be strong a series of 10 but he 

00:01:50.939 --> 00:01:54.659
 probably will not have a big max is 

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:56.130
 someone who does regularly 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:01:59.340
 March or never exceed 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:00.509
 v5 repeat series on an exercise there 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:02.729
 will have difficulty making 

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:04.200
 sets of 10 with a good load but 

00:02:02.729 --> 00:02:05.909
 there will surely be a big march 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.439
 if today you manage to do it 

00:02:05.909 --> 00:02:09.360
 repetition bench press with the 

00:02:07.439 --> 00:02:11.160
 empty bar in a month you get to 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:12.560
 do 120 repetitions with the city bar 

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:15.319
 you are more 

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:17.239
 with this load on this exercise and 

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:19.849
 on this number of repetitions but you're there 

00:02:17.239 --> 00:02:21.709
 will surely not have a big max there is a 

00:02:19.849 --> 00:02:24.319
 huge difference between being force 

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:26.330
 of specific exercises be strong either 

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:28.760
 a number of specific repetitions and 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:30.560
 to have a big max when you say that you 

00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.569
 want to train to be stronger there 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.010
 I need to be much more precise 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:38.130
 can not just be strong 

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:40.170
 everywhere unless of course you 're a 

00:02:38.130 --> 00:02:42.090
 if you only do pushups and get to 

00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:43.440
 do without affiliate pump and just 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:44.880
 because you're strong with pumps 

00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.460
 that does not mean that you are going to have 

00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:48.240
 a big word on the bench press 

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:49.620
 especially not having someone who 

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:52.290
 train specifically to have 

00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.760
 a big max so to be stronger there 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:55.200
 you have to decide what you want to be 

00:02:53.760 --> 00:02:57.090
 louder that's why you want to be 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.430
 louder and then you 'll train 

00:02:57.090 --> 00:03:01.920
 with sets of three five ten or 

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.540
 same 50 repetition and whenever 

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.820
 you progress you become a little more 

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:06.720
 strong on this exercise and especially on this 

00:03:05.820 --> 00:03:08.910
 number of repetitions 

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:10.710
 if you do not participate in a competition of 

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:12.330
 byholding you do not need it at all 

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:13.980
 to have a big game is an exercise 

00:03:12.330 --> 00:03:16.290
 is just because you're strong the 

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:17.880
 censoring some exercises that does not want 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:19.740
 not to say that you are strong outside 

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:20.910
 there are people who think that just 

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:23.130
 because I have the bench 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:25.190
 150 kg that's good they're strong 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:27.390
 everywhere no it does not work like that 

00:03:25.190 --> 00:03:29.880
 so a question I get a lot 

00:03:27.390 --> 00:03:32.220
 is the following how to increase my 

00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:33.420
 match to the bench press often for 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:35.250
 that people train regularly 

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:36.720
 near the max ie it must 

00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:39.240
 always series of 3 to 5 and 

00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:40.560
 maximum petitions the problems with that 

00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:41.520
 it's very hard to increase 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.680
 age regularly 

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:46.110
 if today you make series of 3 to 

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:48.840
 100 kg next week you will do 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:50.670
 series of 3 to 102 kg then the week 

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:53.190
 next you may have succeeded with 

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:53.670
 104 kg but your progress must quickly 

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:56.160
 stop 

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:57.690
 and that's where people insists make 

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:59.520
 more and vary the exercises for 

00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:00.960
 to progress is that I 

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:02.940
 recommend and start doing some 

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:05.310
 sets of 15 try to progress on 

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:06.750
 the sets of 15 at each sitting you 

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:09.030
 increase the load or the repetitions 

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:10.470
 and trust me that it will be much more 

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:12.660
 simple to increase repetitions the 

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:14.970
 changes when you 're at 15 rather than 

00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:16.799
 three and every three weeks try 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:17.220
 to do some series water with the 

00:04:16.799 --> 00:04:19.530
 March 

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:20.430
 it's very important because if you do 

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:23.070
 than sets of 15 

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:24.330
 your brand will offer itself when you 

00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:26.490
 can no longer progress with 

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:28.650
 series of 15 does the same with series 

00:04:26.490 --> 00:04:30.420
 of the 10 12 and appears all three 

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:31.380
 weeks you do a session on the 

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:33.780
 with the march 

00:04:31.380 --> 00:04:35.280
 and then gradually increase you 

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:37.470
 the charges and decrease the repetitions 

00:04:35.280 --> 00:04:38.760
 to get to your march and you 

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:41.310
 will see when three four months to 

00:04:38.760 --> 00:04:42.540
 your mac well done night and it does not 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:44.310
 do not forget that if your goal 

00:04:42.540 --> 00:04:46.320
 is to progress to the bench press 

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:48.810
 it would only take one session per 

00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:50.729
 week of it will be beer and 3 again 

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:51.420
 better but be careful you will do 

00:04:50.729 --> 00:04:52.950
 science 

00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:54.560
 bedtime and not peace sciences 

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:56.700
 that there is a huge difference 

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:58.440
 when you finish your three four 

00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:00.540
 sets of bench press is over 

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:02.040
 to buy one or two exercises 

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:03.900
 to pay off the shoulders and all that 

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:05.130
 which is said bench press but you 

00:05:03.900 --> 00:05:07.740
 do not go three four exercises 

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:08.100
 you say series of 10 repetitions for 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:09.660
 pecs 

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:11.310
 I hope all this will help you there 

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:12.230
 think a little and progress on your 

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:16.280
 drill 

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:16.280
 thank you and see you next video 

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:25.020
 you
