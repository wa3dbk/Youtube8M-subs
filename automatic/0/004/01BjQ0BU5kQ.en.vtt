00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:04.440 
damper itself another trick deal and we

00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:08.150 
damper itself another trick deal and we
also<00:02:04.560> put<00:02:04.950> the<00:02:05.510> TDC<00:02:06.510> markings<00:02:07.229> of<00:02:07.500> the<00:02:07.740> damper

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.160 
also put the TDC markings of the damper

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:10.550 
also put the TDC markings of the damper
at<00:02:08.340> the<00:02:08.940> 11th<00:02:09.300> too<00:02:09.540> so<00:02:09.869> you<00:02:09.929> can<00:02:10.020> tighten<00:02:10.440> the

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:10.560 
at the 11th too so you can tighten the

00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:14.690 
at the 11th too so you can tighten the
motor<00:02:12.650> the<00:02:13.650> pan<00:02:13.890> we've<00:02:14.100> got<00:02:14.280> two<00:02:14.370> built-in

kick-out<00:02:15.240> into<00:02:15.540> the<00:02:15.660> pan<00:02:15.870> so<00:02:16.140> it's<00:02:16.620> got<00:02:16.770> a

00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:16.800 
kick-out into the pan so it's got a

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.100 
kick-out into the pan so it's got a
one-inch<00:02:17.370> kick-out<00:02:17.820> picks<00:02:18.810> up<00:02:18.990> some

another nice thing here is this is that

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.320 
another nice thing here is this is that
I<00:04:07.650> just<00:04:08.010> turned<00:04:08.580> it<00:04:08.640> down<00:04:08.790> to<00:04:09.030> the<00:04:09.120> lowest

00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:09.330 
I just turned it down to the lowest

00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:11.180 
I just turned it down to the lowest
horsepower<00:04:09.900> setting<00:04:10.320> which<00:04:10.440> is<00:04:10.470> about<00:04:10.770> seven

seven and a half pounds and show you you

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:18.289 
seven and a half pounds and show you you
know<00:04:16.110> I'm<00:04:16.830> completely<00:04:17.670> gasps<00:04:17.970> when<00:04:18.269> you

00:04:18.289 --> 00:04:18.299 
know I'm completely gasps when you

00:04:18.299 --> 00:05:01.770 
know I'm completely gasps when you
could<00:04:18.570> be<00:04:18.780> running<00:04:19.290> anywhere

is<00:05:02.200> the<00:05:02.350> lowest<00:05:02.800> horsepower

00:05:07.399 --> 00:05:07.409 

00:05:07.409 --> 00:05:11.639 

764<00:05:08.409> horsepower<00:05:09.119> 723<00:05:10.119> foot-pounds<00:05:10.929> but<00:05:11.559> if

00:05:11.639 --> 00:05:11.649 
764 horsepower 723 foot-pounds but if

00:05:11.649 --> 00:05:13.980 
764 horsepower 723 foot-pounds but if
you<00:05:11.740> look<00:05:11.860> at<00:05:11.979> the<00:05:12.009> torque<00:05:12.249> ER<00:05:12.520> it's<00:05:12.999> eaten<00:05:13.330> 551

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:13.990 
you look at the torque ER it's eaten 551

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:19.529 
you look at the torque ER it's eaten 551
at<00:05:14.729> 37<00:05:15.729> 23<00:05:16.330> at<00:05:16.479> five<00:05:17.699> so<00:05:18.699> it's<00:05:18.999> just<00:05:19.149> a<00:05:19.300> beast

00:05:19.529 --> 00:05:19.539 
at 37 23 at five so it's just a beast

00:05:19.539 --> 00:05:22.199 
at 37 23 at five so it's just a beast
and<00:05:20.050> it's<00:05:20.199> only<00:05:20.439> eight<00:05:20.619> pounds<00:05:20.979> of<00:05:21.069> boost<00:05:21.219> and

00:05:22.199 --> 00:05:22.209 
and it's only eight pounds of boost and

00:05:22.209 --> 00:05:24.149 
and it's only eight pounds of boost and
when<00:05:22.360> you<00:05:22.419> consider<00:05:22.749> it<00:05:22.959> makes<00:05:23.139> 38<00:05:23.679> pounds<00:05:23.919> of

00:05:24.149 --> 00:05:24.159 
when you consider it makes 38 pounds of

00:05:24.159 --> 00:05:26.129 
when you consider it makes 38 pounds of
boost<00:05:24.279> really<00:05:24.819> get<00:05:25.270> a<00:05:25.300> feel<00:05:25.599> for<00:05:25.839> what<00:05:25.990> the

00:05:26.129 --> 00:05:26.139 
boost really get a feel for what the

00:05:26.139 --> 00:05:29.039 
boost really get a feel for what the
six-game<00:05:26.439> pull<00:05:26.889> up
