00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:45.180 
two thousand of 12 to have six inches of

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:48.440 
two thousand of 12 to have six inches of
hair<00:00:45.480> growth<00:00:46.640> I've<00:00:47.640> been<00:00:47.850> wearing<00:00:48.030> my<00:00:48.239> hair

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:48.450 
hair growth I've been wearing my hair

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:51.400 
hair growth I've been wearing my hair
and<00:00:48.539> protective<00:00:49.140> styles<00:00:49.649> a<00:00:49.800> lot<00:00:50.010> and<00:00:50.309> I've

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:51.410 
and protective styles a lot and I've

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:55.670 
and protective styles a lot and I've
haven't<00:00:52.410> straightened<00:00:53.070> it<00:00:53.399> since<00:00:54.680> early

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680 
haven't straightened it since early

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.599 
haven't straightened it since early
December<00:00:56.219> so<00:00:56.550> it's<00:00:56.760> probably<00:00:57.030> been<00:00:57.360> a<00:00:57.690> month

00:00:58.599 --> 00:00:58.609 
December so it's probably been a month

00:00:58.609 --> 00:01:05.240 
December so it's probably been a month
at<00:00:59.609> least<00:00:59.940> of<00:01:02.449> not<00:01:03.449> having<00:01:03.870> any<00:01:04.140> heat<00:01:04.860> on<00:01:05.070> my

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250 
at least of not having any heat on my

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:14.330 
at least of not having any heat on my
hair<00:01:06.290> so<00:01:11.000> we'll<00:01:12.000> just<00:01:12.030> try<00:01:12.330> to<00:01:12.390> get<00:01:12.600> some<00:01:13.159> of<00:01:14.159> my

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:14.340 
hair so we'll just try to get some of my

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:26.810 
hair so we'll just try to get some of my
regular<00:01:15.090> right<00:01:15.270> now<00:01:24.470> it's<00:01:25.470> about<00:01:25.710> eight<00:01:26.490> and<00:01:26.549> a

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
regular right now it's about eight and a

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:32.090 
regular right now it's about eight and a
half<00:01:26.850> nine<00:01:27.720> inches<00:01:30.619> but<00:01:31.619> things<00:01:31.890> are

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100 
half nine inches but things are

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:49.880 
half nine inches but things are
definitely<00:01:32.189> shorter

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:49.890 

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.790 

eight<00:01:50.430> and<00:01:50.640> a<00:01:50.670> half<00:01:50.700> inches<00:01:51.320> right<00:01:52.320> there<00:01:52.380> as

00:01:52.790 --> 00:01:52.800 
eight and a half inches right there as

00:01:52.800 --> 00:02:09.940 
eight and a half inches right there as
well

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:09.950 

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:11.710 

might<00:02:10.610> not<00:02:10.729> be<00:02:10.789> doing<00:02:11.180> this<00:02:11.330> right<00:02:11.599> away

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:11.720 
might not be doing this right away

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.449 
might not be doing this right away
hopefully<00:02:12.550> this<00:02:13.550> technique<00:02:14.060> gets<00:02:14.269> better

00:02:15.449 --> 00:02:15.459 
hopefully this technique gets better

00:02:15.459 --> 00:02:18.850 
hopefully this technique gets better
over<00:02:16.459> the<00:02:16.550> course<00:02:16.879> I<00:02:17.269> got<00:02:17.720> 10<00:02:18.200> inches<00:02:18.680> right

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:18.860 
over the course I got 10 inches right

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:39.950 
over the course I got 10 inches right
there

00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:39.960 

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:52.280 

nine<00:02:40.920> inches<00:02:41.720> we<00:02:42.720> do<00:02:42.870> this<00:02:43.070> one<00:02:44.070> more<00:02:44.400> time

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:52.290 

00:02:52.290 --> 00:02:54.949 

and<00:02:52.379> my<00:02:53.370> hair<00:02:53.640> is<00:02:53.909> still<00:02:54.299> in<00:02:54.569> its<00:02:54.659> natural

00:02:54.949 --> 00:02:54.959 
and my hair is still in its natural

00:02:54.959 --> 00:02:59.959 
and my hair is still in its natural
state<00:02:55.200> I<00:02:55.650> just<00:02:55.860> did<00:02:55.950> my<00:02:55.980> ruler<00:02:56.400> set<00:02:56.689> so<00:02:57.689> I<00:02:58.969> got

00:02:59.959 --> 00:02:59.969 
state I just did my ruler set so I got

00:02:59.969 --> 00:03:05.440 
state I just did my ruler set so I got
nine<00:03:00.150> and<00:03:00.359> a<00:03:00.420> half<00:03:00.450> inches<00:03:00.750> with<00:03:01.140> that<00:03:01.290> one<00:03:01.670> so

00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:05.450 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:08.509 

it's<00:03:06.450> probably<00:03:06.780> it<00:03:07.680> might<00:03:07.890> be<00:03:08.099> a<00:03:08.129> little<00:03:08.340> bit

00:03:08.509 --> 00:03:08.519 
it's probably it might be a little bit

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:11.000 
it's probably it might be a little bit
longer<00:03:08.670> because<00:03:09.180> it's<00:03:09.569> not<00:03:09.840> bone<00:03:10.620> straight

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.010 
longer because it's not bone straight

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:12.619 
longer because it's not bone straight
that's<00:03:11.430> what<00:03:11.609> we're<00:03:11.790> going<00:03:11.879> to<00:03:11.970> go<00:03:12.150> with<00:03:12.359> for
