00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:17.340
 all viewers and subscribers of my channel 

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:19.980
 on the review, then these cards from the team 

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:23.490
 years crishtiana ronaldo certainly that 

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:26.970
 better fifa 15 card even 

00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:29.880
 skills because rating 99 so far 

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:32.340
 no one yes and this card team 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:33.630
 years, respectively, no one will 

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.260
 well there with a certain concourse 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:40.559
 circumstances of the cape may be 99 are the essence 

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.930
 That this card among m99 let's 

00:00:40.559 --> 00:00:47.399
 Let's start with kilov principles, although everything is there 

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:52.860
 pretty so uniquely control the ball 99 

00:00:47.399 --> 00:00:58.289
 demand 99 completion 99 head game 99 

00:00:52.860 --> 00:01:03.870
 lacquer photo 99 power of impact 99 jumping 99 

00:00:58.289 --> 00:01:09.990
 sprint 99 endurance 99 strength 

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:13.350
 de-89 penalty 88 position selection 97 4 

00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:18.810
 stars weak foot 5 stars special tricks 

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:22.799
 worth this card pretty much on 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:27.869
 playstation about 14 million 13 may 

00:01:22.799 --> 00:01:30.619
 Xbox 10 11 to 15 but it turns out 

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:33.150
 The trick is that it costs more than 15 but 

00:01:30.619 --> 00:01:35.250
 thread level so you sell it 

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:37.259
 more than 15 it turns out really only 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:39.840
 Is that from the account therefore expose 

00:01:37.259 --> 00:01:43.409
 for 15 naturally and 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:45.659
 Basically I can say is worth it 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:48.060
 by the way as well as his and in the card and 

00:01:45.659 --> 00:01:51.060
 CIF card that is also 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:54.659
 15 million see these and the cards are worth 

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:58.590
 at the auction what else can I say the same 

00:01:54.659 --> 00:02:00.600
 I want to note that I match a lot 

00:01:58.590 --> 00:02:02.909
 played see now statistics on their 

00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:06.409
 The screens there are not completely the same 

00:02:02.909 --> 00:02:08.910
 I have already sold many but the bottom line is that 

00:02:06.409 --> 00:02:11.280
 started shooting after 20 matches 

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:12.849
 this guy scored me every match two 

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:16.940
 three balls where 

00:02:12.849 --> 00:02:19.340
 she used to be that one goal but then only 

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:22.370
 but only two matches he scored not 

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:25.310
 one sword is the first and last match 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:28.730
 in general, let me tell you in more detail 

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:32.390
 his game has a speed of 98 but if 

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:34.280
 honestly he is very fast very technical 

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:36.500
 thanks fucking 99 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:38.299
 but the problem is that he has a very 

00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:40.540
 bad fatal speed that is when he 

00:02:38.299 --> 00:02:43.790
 already takes the ball and starts 

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:45.980
 run then many defenders due to this 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:47.840
 jerk just take the ball from him i don't 

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:51.380
 I know squeeze out the case even such 

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:52.970
 maybe but when she already got her 

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:54.440
 the speed is already not natural 

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:57.200
 stop if he also starts 

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:59.780
 trick there drink he has 99 more screws 5 

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:02.120
 stars already said that is to dribble with 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:05.450
 the screws just don't stop it at all 

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:08.209
 not as I shifted from the left wing beat 

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:11.390
 punched hung that just did 

00:03:08.209 --> 00:03:15.590
 almost all these moments would bring 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:18.980
 success also want to say what a blow to him 

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:20.030
 99 as you understand, but in 15 reef 

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:22.760
 to hammer 

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:24.739
 became very difficult at the same time 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:26.299
 who can but you previously old 

00:03:24.739 --> 00:03:29.239
 left 14 

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:31.930
 FIFA versions they were more random 

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:35.000
 there was such a thing as a twisted punch 

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:35.959
 like a clone porridge from on the 15th floor by the way 

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.790
 very good 

00:03:35.959 --> 00:03:41.510
 that you are so not being regulated 

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:44.840
 twisted punches in 14 13 were very 

00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:47.239
 it is direct very funny just took off all 

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:51.169
 especially if gravity ronaldo which 

00:03:47.239 --> 00:03:52.940
 there twist 99 and blows 95 then what about 

00:03:51.169 --> 00:03:55.280
 you can talk just beat with any 

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:56.780
 distances the ball takes off and not even 

00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:59.239
 have to make any effort 

00:03:56.780 --> 00:04:02.989
 actually now to score early 

00:03:59.239 --> 00:04:06.620
 Yes, we must really not bad to play this 

00:04:02.989 --> 00:04:09.590
 the version of the same engine of the same embroidered 

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:11.810
 why fly yes it is also supposed that you 

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:15.079
 they fly off with a probability of no more than 20 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:17.889
 percent because u ronaldo here blow 

00:04:15.079 --> 00:04:20.239
 very strong and when you beat it just 

00:04:17.889 --> 00:04:22.039
 that he is very strong 

00:04:20.239 --> 00:04:24.409
 goes up that is not pressed 

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:25.330
 goes up but then in most cases 

00:04:24.409 --> 00:04:27.460
 and 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:29.740
 hello by the way there was no record but all 

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:32.680
 equally best pretty pretty here 

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:35.530
 blow with a spin and always turn out 

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:38.740
 but direct hits aren't always 

00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:42.879
 fly oms penalty need to go under 

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:45.699
 certain positions there are shorter than long 

00:04:42.879 --> 00:04:47.469
 the story but the bottom line is that at the beginning when 

00:04:45.699 --> 00:04:52.750
 i played there was no getting used wrong 

00:04:47.469 --> 00:04:56.039
 easy because I'm always here for 

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:59.139
 this one is this style of play which is he 

00:04:56.039 --> 00:05:01.810
 play single player im trying to circumvent 

00:04:59.139 --> 00:05:04.569
 to the riots defenders punch here he is not 

00:05:01.810 --> 00:05:05.590
 It turned out because it was the phase of the strike 

00:05:04.569 --> 00:05:08.680
 I could not get 

00:05:05.590 --> 00:05:10.719
 always the goalkeeper dragged into the bar 

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:12.750
 Often, well, after finishing my other 

00:05:10.719 --> 00:05:15.219
 football players I always thought pancakes so 

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:15.729
 so you just need to get used and everything 

00:05:15.219 --> 00:05:19.719
 will come 

00:05:15.729 --> 00:05:23.500
 I also want to talk about his blows 

00:05:19.719 --> 00:05:26.409
 fines are very good fines 

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:30.039
 such a thing as a blow pressed there lb 

00:05:26.409 --> 00:05:31.810
 we have to clamp a very strong aura 

00:05:30.039 --> 00:05:34.090
 It is necessary when you hit the usual penalty here 

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:36.430
 the ball flies as if he had been pressed 

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:39.190
 flies very much just like them 

00:05:36.430 --> 00:05:42.849
 so here is just above the wall of the gate so 

00:05:39.190 --> 00:05:47.289
 falls flies just that's very strong 

00:05:42.849 --> 00:05:49.029
 fast heavy such a ball goes and of course 

00:05:47.289 --> 00:05:50.620
 sometimes there can have backspin Larik 

00:05:49.029 --> 00:05:52.599
 but here I am very much such blows 

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:55.449
 like when the ball just is not even 

00:05:52.599 --> 00:05:58.089
 spinning like this 

00:05:55.449 --> 00:05:59.090
 i like crazy i scored 

00:05:58.089 --> 00:06:01.430
 corners and 

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:04.370
 so scored scored about penalties about 

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:07.340
 seven swords but filmed only two atoms 3 

00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:09.620
 my husband does not carry a penalty 

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:11.630
 its very good 

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:14.300
 I scored just one ball in the game 

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:17.900
 hit his head no more than four times because 

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:20.540
 that how would I novyj hang 

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:24.050
 on him there i'm blinking myself major 

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:26.330
 only hung in most cases 

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:29.449
 of course the game was nonetheless 

00:06:26.330 --> 00:06:31.340
 head and 99 and he scores very even 

00:06:29.449 --> 00:06:33.710
 good because it just jumps 

00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:38.060
 crazy he jumps very high 

00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:39.979
 and well, just a great player that's cool 

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:42.110
 I will not say anything about its value 

00:06:39.979 --> 00:06:44.500
 Is it worth it? It's up to you to decide. 

00:06:42.110 --> 00:06:50.240
 are you ready to lay out for him 

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:52.370
 huge money but the fact is that the player 

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:54.530
 he is very cool well and in principle 

00:06:52.370 --> 00:06:57.080
 all put your thumbs up 

00:06:54.530 --> 00:06:59.090
 subscribe to the channel and write in 

00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:03.380
 comments here I arranged the last time 

00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:05.419
 survey do Lebanon and you wrote something 

00:07:03.380 --> 00:07:07.610
 do but there is another option either i 

00:07:05.419 --> 00:07:11.750
 doing it on the hymen selling ronaldo now 

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:13.760
 and doing reviews on the cape there arobin place 

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:15.770
 cross di maria is the teams of the year 

00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:17.570
 Naturally football players so write in 

00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:19.130
 comments which option is better for you but 

00:07:17.570 --> 00:07:21.560
 Naturally, if there is a van box 

00:07:19.130 --> 00:07:23.000
 Ronaldo then Vanov on Taras nowhere 

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:28.330
 will be gone then it will just go 

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:28.330
 in parallel on the channel bye see you all
