00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119 
and it looks a lot but apparently that's

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:43.789 
and it looks a lot but apparently that's
what<00:01:42.299> it<00:01:42.390> says<00:01:42.540> about<00:01:42.570> let<00:01:43.079> see<00:01:43.229> is<00:01:43.290> two<00:01:43.500> pound

00:01:43.789 --> 00:01:43.799 
what it says about let see is two pound

00:01:43.799 --> 00:01:44.810 
what it says about let see is two pound
of<00:01:43.920> sugar<00:01:44.040> per<00:01:44.369> bottle

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:44.820 
of sugar per bottle

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:46.580 
of sugar per bottle
and<00:01:44.970> since<00:01:45.420> we're<00:01:45.570> doubling<00:01:45.899> the<00:01:46.049> mixture<00:01:46.409> up

00:01:46.580 --> 00:01:46.590 
and since we're doubling the mixture up

00:01:46.590 --> 00:01:48.859 
and since we're doubling the mixture up
to<00:01:47.100> make<00:01:47.250> templates<00:01:47.939> that's<00:01:48.360> what<00:01:48.600> it<00:01:48.689> is

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869 
to make templates that's what it is

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:51.200 
to make templates that's what it is
so<00:01:49.079> there's<00:01:49.350> four<00:01:49.649> pound<00:01:49.890> of<00:01:50.009> sugar<00:01:50.210> two

00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:51.210 
so there's four pound of sugar two

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:55.429 
so there's four pound of sugar two
bottles<00:01:51.600> of<00:01:52.250> ginger<00:01:53.250> compound<00:01:53.880> and<00:01:54.439> ten

00:01:55.429 --> 00:01:55.439 
bottles of ginger compound and ten

00:01:55.439 --> 00:02:01.609 
bottles of ginger compound and ten
liters<00:01:56.250> no<00:01:56.729> tenders<00:01:57.420> ten<00:01:58.049> pints<00:01:58.350> of<00:01:58.710> water<00:02:00.619> so

00:02:01.609 --> 00:02:01.619 
liters no tenders ten pints of water so

00:02:01.619 --> 00:02:04.520 
liters no tenders ten pints of water so
now<00:02:01.799> I've<00:02:01.979> put<00:02:02.159> the<00:02:02.280> sugar<00:02:02.570> into<00:02:03.570> the<00:02:04.259> water

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:04.530 
now I've put the sugar into the water

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:06.469 
now I've put the sugar into the water
and<00:02:04.890> as<00:02:05.130> you<00:02:05.159> can<00:02:05.369> see<00:02:05.490> the<00:02:05.700> yellowy<00:02:06.180> colour

00:02:06.469 --> 00:02:06.479 
and as you can see the yellowy colour

00:02:06.479 --> 00:02:08.510 
and as you can see the yellowy colour
it's<00:02:07.140> all<00:02:07.259> the<00:02:07.409> melted<00:02:07.740> sugar<00:02:07.920> and<00:02:08.399> the

00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:08.520 
it's all the melted sugar and the

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:10.999 
it's all the melted sugar and the
glucose<00:02:08.910> II<00:02:09.090> kind<00:02:09.330> of<00:02:09.420> think<00:02:09.629> then<00:02:09.989> so<00:02:10.830> that's

00:02:10.999 --> 00:02:11.009 
glucose II kind of think then so that's

00:02:11.009 --> 00:02:13.160 
glucose II kind of think then so that's
going<00:02:11.220> to<00:02:11.280> cool<00:02:11.640> down<00:02:11.940> now<00:02:12.239> I've<00:02:12.750> got<00:02:12.959> to<00:02:13.050> mix

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:13.170 
going to cool down now I've got to mix

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:13.790 
going to cool down now I've got to mix
it<00:02:13.290> every<00:02:13.500> now

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:13.800 
it every now

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.740 
it every now
and<00:02:13.890> some<00:02:14.040> of<00:02:14.160> the<00:02:14.250> sugar<00:02:14.490> melts<00:02:14.820> and<00:02:14.970> goes<00:02:15.540> in

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:15.750 
and some of the sugar melts and goes in

00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.810 
and some of the sugar melts and goes in
and<00:02:15.840> then<00:02:15.930> a<00:02:15.960> fact<00:02:16.260> cools<00:02:16.560> down<00:02:16.710> before<00:02:17.100> we<00:02:17.640> add

00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:17.820 
and then a fact cools down before we add

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:19.790 
and then a fact cools down before we add
the<00:02:17.850> two<00:02:18.210> two<00:02:18.690> thingies<00:02:19.080> of<00:02:19.200> ginger<00:02:19.500> Mohammed

00:02:19.790 --> 00:02:19.800 
the two two thingies of ginger Mohammed

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:22.070 
the two two thingies of ginger Mohammed
had<00:02:19.890> it<00:02:20.040> the<00:02:20.700> mixture<00:02:21.120> is<00:02:21.180> cooled<00:02:21.480> down<00:02:21.570> we<00:02:21.750> can

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.080 
had it the mixture is cooled down we can

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:26.570 
had it the mixture is cooled down we can
begin<00:02:22.230> to<00:02:22.590> pour<00:02:24.560> the<00:02:25.560> ginger<00:02:25.890> brain<00:02:26.040> compound
