00:01:58.600 --> 00:01:58.610 
or it might open up in the fryer because

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:00.520

00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:00.530 
of the temperature of the tortilla so we

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:03.190 
of the temperature of the tortilla so we
want<00:02:00.709> to<00:02:01.000> heat<00:02:02.000> up<00:02:02.030> the<00:02:02.240> tortilla<00:02:02.600> a<00:02:02.899> little

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:06.500 
bit both sides that'll give them

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.650 
bit both sides that'll give them
flexibility<00:02:07.250> when<00:02:07.519> you<00:02:07.640> fold<00:02:07.910> it<00:02:08.149> and<00:02:08.330> it's

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:08.660

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:55.710 

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:59.510 

right<00:02:56.300> now<00:02:57.410> the<00:02:58.410> most<00:02:58.620> important<00:02:59.130> part<00:02:59.370> of

00:02:59.510 --> 00:02:59.520 
right now the most important part of

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:02.000 
right now the most important part of
making<00:02:59.670> out<00:02:59.910> to<00:03:00.300> China<00:03:00.600> is<00:03:00.870> how<00:03:01.140> to<00:03:01.200> fold<00:03:01.710> it

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:02.010 
making out to China is how to fold it

00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:03.980 
making out to China is how to fold it
why<00:03:02.280> because<00:03:03.030> if<00:03:03.150> you<00:03:03.240> don't<00:03:03.330> fold<00:03:03.570> it<00:03:03.720> right

00:03:03.980 --> 00:03:03.990 
why because if you don't fold it right

00:03:03.990 --> 00:03:07.310 
why because if you don't fold it right
is<00:03:04.260> gonna<00:03:04.530> open<00:03:04.860> up<00:03:05.010> it's<00:03:05.730> gonna<00:03:06.020> all<00:03:07.020> the

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:07.320 
is gonna open up it's gonna all the

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:09.140 
is gonna open up it's gonna all the
ingredients<00:03:07.770> are<00:03:07.860> gonna<00:03:08.040> get<00:03:08.670> out<00:03:08.880> of<00:03:09.060> the

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:09.150 
ingredients are gonna get out of the

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.720 
ingredients are gonna get out of the
tortilla<00:03:09.510> so<00:03:09.870> look<00:03:10.410> at<00:03:10.500> the<00:03:10.590> process<00:03:10.950> both

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730 
tortilla so look at the process both

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:15.110 
tortilla so look at the process both
sides<00:03:12.060> go<00:03:12.570> into<00:03:13.080> the<00:03:13.200> center<00:03:13.530> and<00:03:13.820> then<00:03:14.820> from

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:15.120 
sides go into the center and then from

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:18.140 
sides go into the center and then from
the<00:03:15.210> bottom<00:03:15.540> you<00:03:15.780> roll<00:03:16.290> up<00:03:16.470> like<00:03:16.680> so<00:03:16.980> one<00:03:17.730> and

00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:18.150 
the bottom you roll up like so one and

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:21.380 
the bottom you roll up like so one and
two<00:03:18.360> times<00:03:18.630> usually<00:03:19.160> now<00:03:20.160> we're<00:03:20.970> gonna<00:03:21.090> put

00:03:21.380 --> 00:03:21.390 
two times usually now we're gonna put

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:22.880 
two times usually now we're gonna put
the<00:03:21.680> chimichanga

00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:22.890 
the chimichanga

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:28.430 
the chimichanga
right<00:03:23.340> into<00:03:23.700> the<00:03:23.790> fryer<00:03:24.030> like<00:03:24.360> so<00:03:26.960> the<00:03:27.960> opening

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:28.440 
right into the fryer like so the opening

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:31.760 
right into the fryer like so the opening
has<00:03:28.620> to<00:03:28.740> be<00:03:28.860> on<00:03:29.070> the<00:03:29.160> bottom<00:03:29.520> of<00:03:29.640> the<00:03:30.200> basket<00:03:31.200> so

00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:31.770 
has to be on the bottom of the basket so

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:36.290 
has to be on the bottom of the basket so
that<00:03:31.800> keeps<00:03:32.640> it<00:03:32.880> closed<00:03:33.480> up<00:03:33.810> and<00:03:34.940> this<00:03:35.940> is<00:03:36.150> how

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:36.300 
that keeps it closed up and this is how

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:39.380 
that keeps it closed up and this is how
you<00:03:36.920> deep-fry<00:03:37.920> your<00:03:38.190> chimichanga<00:03:39.000> now<00:03:39.330> the

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:39.390 
you deep-fry your chimichanga now the

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:42.470 
you deep-fry your chimichanga now the
oil<00:03:39.960> eats<00:03:40.680> at<00:03:40.920> about<00:03:41.130> 350<00:03:41.970> degrees

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:42.480 
oil eats at about 350 degrees

00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:49.580 
oil eats at about 350 degrees
it's<00:03:43.700> shortening<00:03:44.700> 0%<00:03:45.600> trans<00:03:45.840> fat<00:03:47.210> and<00:03:48.350> you<00:03:49.350> let

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:49.590 
it's shortening 0% trans fat and you let

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:52.070 
it's shortening 0% trans fat and you let
it<00:03:49.710> for<00:03:49.890> about<00:03:49.980> 3<00:03:50.640> minutes<00:03:50.880> after<00:03:51.660> 3<00:03:51.870> minutes

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:52.080 
it for about 3 minutes after 3 minutes

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:55.160 
it for about 3 minutes after 3 minutes

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:55.170 
we're gonna show you how it ends up this

00:03:55.170 --> 00:03:58.730 
we're gonna show you how it ends up this
is<00:03:55.520> chimichanga<00:03:56.550> that<00:03:57.420> was<00:03:58.020> good<00:03:58.260> for<00:03:58.530> about

now there's another way to make the
chimichanga<00:04:31.230> as<00:04:31.290> well<00:04:31.470> which<00:04:31.980> we<00:04:32.760> also<00:04:32.910> make

00:04:33.140 --> 00:04:33.150 
chimichanga as well which we also make

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:35.960 
chimichanga as well which we also make
him<00:04:33.270> wet<00:04:33.540> which<00:04:34.260> means<00:04:34.530> we<00:04:34.860> put<00:04:35.070> Antigua<00:04:35.670> sauce

00:04:42.770 --> 00:04:42.780 
well which is right there that's another

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:46.460 
well which is right there that's another
way<00:04:42.960> to<00:04:42.990> make<00:04:43.290> it<00:04:43.500> so<00:04:44.370> he<00:04:44.700> will<00:04:44.880> toss<00:04:45.200> the<00:04:46.200> sauce
