 comment is a typical recipe 

00:00:24.710 --> 00:00:27.710
 Puglia 

00:00:25.579 --> 00:00:29.989
 I suggest you try it because you really do 

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:36.530
 really delicious we go to see immediately 

00:00:29.989 --> 00:00:38.320
 the ingredients to prepare it for 

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:43.610
 prepare our grilled aubergines 

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:48.080
 says it takes two eggplants 

00:00:43.610 --> 00:00:52.820
 medium-sized apple or wine vinegar 

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:57.650
 white extra virgin olive oil from 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:01:00.820
 salt of chilli pepper 

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:00.820
 fresh mint leaves 

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:12.570
 of fresh or powdered garlic and a 

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:12.570
 serrated knife we go to prepare them 

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:20.860
 first we cut the aubergines a 

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:23.110
 thin slices otherwise the blade 

00:01:20.860 --> 00:01:26.730
 smooth of a knife would be ruined a 

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:26.730
 contact with eggplant peel 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:41.979
 just cut the aubergine slices into it 

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:45.610
 we put in a bowl that we continue 

00:01:41.979 --> 00:01:47.560
 heat the plate once well 

00:01:45.610 --> 00:01:50.080
 hot cook in the first slices of 

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:52.900
 eggplant starting from one side you can 

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:54.610
 also take advantage of the I-line grid 

00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:57.430
 I prefer this because it is much more 

00:01:54.610 --> 00:01:59.500
 practical to use when the first one 

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:01.330
 side and well cooked you can with the help of 

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:06.490
 a pincer bypassing it proceed with the 

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:08.380
 second born when all the eggplant 

00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:10.690
 have been grilled 

00:02:08.380 --> 00:02:15.030
 proceed to answer a first layer on the 

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:19.900
 the bottom of a bowl, add sal 

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:23.020
 of fresh mint into small pieces of 

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:25.870
 I prefer chilli and garlic 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:30.660
 the one in dust because it made me stronger 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:30.660
 olive oil and vinegar 

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:36.810
 cover with a second layer of 

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:39.060
 eggplant and repeat the passage with 

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:40.920
 all the ingredients as before 

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:43.909
 up to finish all the aubergines that 

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:43.909
 you have already grilled 

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:12.930
 finished the steps take a plate 

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:16.530
 floor smaller than the diameter of the 

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:18.480
 bowl and pressed to make the names say 

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:20.940
 eggplant well 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.950
 put in the fridge for at least two hours 

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:25.950
 and here are our aubergines ready 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:26.580
 Mint grills are a real treat 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:29.130
