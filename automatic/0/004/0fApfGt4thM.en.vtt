little<00:00:04.049> tutorial<00:00:04.500> for<00:00:04.950> you<00:00:05.390> that<00:00:06.390> I<00:00:06.420> found<00:00:07.080> to

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:08.010 
little tutorial for you that I found to

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:10.879 
little tutorial for you that I found to
be<00:00:08.130> very<00:00:08.309> helpful<00:00:09.170> after<00:00:10.170> I<00:00:10.380> figured<00:00:10.710> it<00:00:10.769> out

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889 
be very helpful after I figured it out

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:15.799 
be very helpful after I figured it out
and<00:00:11.190> I<00:00:11.309> couldn't<00:00:11.580> find<00:00:11.759> it<00:00:11.910> online<00:00:14.690> what<00:00:15.690> I'm

00:00:15.799 --> 00:00:15.809 
and I couldn't find it online what I'm

00:00:15.809 --> 00:00:24.560 
and I couldn't find it online what I'm
going<00:00:15.929> to<00:00:15.960> show<00:00:16.230> you<00:00:16.289> is<00:00:16.650> let's<00:00:17.550> see<00:00:17.850> you<00:00:23.570> gonna

00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:24.570 
going to show you is let's see you gonna

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:26.779 
going to show you is let's see you gonna
run<00:00:24.840> this<00:00:25.019> under<00:00:25.439> dollar<00:00:25.740> bill<00:00:25.980> along<00:00:26.580> the

00:00:26.779 --> 00:00:26.789 
run this under dollar bill along the

00:00:26.789 --> 00:00:32.900 
run this under dollar bill along the
spline<00:00:28.279> but<00:00:29.279> this<00:00:29.429> is<00:00:29.580> two<00:00:29.760> planes<00:00:30.349> with<00:00:31.910> the

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:32.910 
spline but this is two planes with the

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:35.479 
spline but this is two planes with the
front<00:00:33.210> and<00:00:33.420> the<00:00:33.510> back<00:00:33.690> being<00:00:34.230> mapped<00:00:34.710> the

00:00:35.479 --> 00:00:35.489 
front and the back being mapped the

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:42.080 
front and the back being mapped the
separate<00:00:36.239> sides<00:00:38.239> so<00:00:39.239> my<00:00:39.719> problem<00:00:40.170> was<00:00:41.090> stop

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:42.090 
separate sides so my problem was stop

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.490 
separate sides so my problem was stop
this<00:00:43.700> if<00:00:44.700> I<00:00:44.879> take<00:00:44.910> this<00:00:45.300> bill<00:00:45.570> here<00:00:45.899> and<00:00:46.170> I<00:00:46.320> add

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:46.500 
this if I take this bill here and I add

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:55.340 
this if I take this bill here and I add
a<00:00:46.850> spline<00:00:47.850> wrap<00:00:48.300> to<00:00:48.570> it<00:00:53.149> will<00:00:54.149> give<00:00:54.300> it<00:00:54.449> this

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.350 
a spline wrap to it will give it this

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:02.930 
a spline wrap to it will give it this
line<00:00:55.739> here<00:00:59.090> changes<00:01:00.090> to<00:01:00.329> keep<00:01:00.719> length<00:01:01.940> and

00:01:02.930 --> 00:01:02.940 
line here changes to keep length and

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:12.740 
line here changes to keep length and
will<00:01:03.629> Bank<00:01:04.260> it<00:01:04.470> at<00:01:04.619> 90<00:01:11.360> let's<00:01:12.360> change<00:01:12.570> it<00:01:12.720> to

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:12.750 
will Bank it at 90 let's change it to

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:18.260 
will Bank it at 90 let's change it to
zeal<00:01:13.049> so<00:01:13.610> okay<00:01:14.840> now<00:01:15.840> what<00:01:15.990> happens<00:01:16.409> is<00:01:17.240> when<00:01:18.240> I

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:18.270 
zeal so okay now what happens is when I

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.730 
zeal so okay now what happens is when I
animate<00:01:18.689> the<00:01:18.960> offset<00:01:19.409> on<00:01:19.530> the<00:01:19.650> spline<00:01:19.920> wrap

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:21.740 
animate the offset on the spline wrap

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.499 
animate the offset on the spline wrap
you'll<00:01:22.740> see<00:01:22.920> that<00:01:23.040> the<00:01:23.220> texture<00:01:23.700> is<00:01:23.729> just<00:01:24.420> a

00:01:24.499 --> 00:01:24.509 
you'll see that the texture is just a

00:01:24.509 --> 00:01:28.310 
you'll see that the texture is just a
big<00:01:24.689> tiled<00:01:25.049> map<00:01:26.000> and<00:01:27.000> the<00:01:27.060> bill<00:01:27.270> just<00:01:27.540> kind<00:01:28.229> of

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 
big tiled map and the bill just kind of

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:32.870 
big tiled map and the bill just kind of
flows<00:01:28.590> through<00:01:28.950> it<00:01:30.619> almost<00:01:31.619> like<00:01:31.920> a<00:01:31.950> an<00:01:32.520> alpha

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:32.880 
flows through it almost like a an alpha

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.690 
flows through it almost like a an alpha
mask<00:01:33.770> but<00:01:34.770> that's<00:01:34.979> not<00:01:35.130> what<00:01:35.250> we<00:01:35.310> want<00:01:35.520> we<00:01:35.670> want

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:35.700 
mask but that's not what we want we want

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:39.170 
mask but that's not what we want we want
the<00:01:36.000> texture<00:01:36.479> to<00:01:36.659> stay<00:01:36.900> with<00:01:37.110> it<00:01:37.729> but<00:01:38.729> this<00:01:39.000> one

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:39.180 
the texture to stay with it but this one

00:01:39.180 --> 00:01:42.800 
the texture to stay with it but this one
over<00:01:39.360> here<00:01:40.369> and<00:01:41.369> we<00:01:41.790> want<00:01:42.000> both<00:01:42.150> sides<00:01:42.479> to<00:01:42.689> go

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:42.810 
over here and we want both sides to go

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:47.590 
over here and we want both sides to go
along<00:01:43.079> with<00:01:43.229> it<00:01:43.350> as<00:01:43.439> well<00:01:44.630> so<00:01:45.630> what<00:01:45.869> I<00:01:45.899> did<00:01:46.020> was

00:01:47.590 --> 00:01:47.600 
along with it as well so what I did was

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:53.780 
along with it as well so what I did was
zoom<00:01:48.600> in<00:01:48.780> on<00:01:48.899> these<00:01:52.100> and<00:01:53.100> I'll<00:01:53.310> get<00:01:53.490> rid<00:01:53.610> of<00:01:53.670> the

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:53.790 
zoom in on these and I'll get rid of the

00:01:53.790 --> 00:02:03.349 
zoom in on these and I'll get rid of the
spline<00:01:54.149> wrap

00:02:03.349 --> 00:02:03.359 

00:02:03.359 --> 00:02:07.679 

all<00:02:04.359> right<00:02:04.539> so<00:02:05.789> basically<00:02:06.789> all<00:02:07.030> we<00:02:07.210> have<00:02:07.240> here

00:02:07.679 --> 00:02:07.689 
all right so basically all we have here

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:14.940 
all right so basically all we have here
is<00:02:08.640> two<00:02:09.640> planes<00:02:09.940> and<00:02:12.480> they<00:02:13.480> both<00:02:13.690> mapped<00:02:13.989> with

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:14.950 
is two planes and they both mapped with

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:21.150 
is two planes and they both mapped with
one<00:02:15.250> single<00:02:17.069> JPEG<00:02:18.959> and<00:02:19.959> they<00:02:20.379> just<00:02:20.590> put<00:02:20.830> really

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.160 
one single JPEG and they just put really

00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.009 
one single JPEG and they just put really
close<00:02:21.400> together<00:02:21.760> so<00:02:22.030> it<00:02:22.269> will<00:02:22.420> cite<00:02:22.660> that<00:02:22.810> one

00:02:23.009 --> 00:02:23.019 
close together so it will cite that one

00:02:23.019 --> 00:02:32.729 
close together so it will cite that one
and<00:02:23.290> then<00:02:23.620> grouped<00:02:26.400> so<00:02:28.319> what<00:02:29.319> I<00:02:29.349> did<00:02:29.650> was<00:02:31.739> after

00:02:32.729 --> 00:02:32.739 
and then grouped so what I did was after

00:02:32.739 --> 00:02:39.990 
and then grouped so what I did was after
I<00:02:32.980> add<00:02:33.190> the<00:02:33.599> you<00:02:34.599> know<00:02:34.750> spline<00:02:35.500> wrap<00:02:35.680> to<00:02:35.890> it<00:02:39.000> had

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.000 
I add the you know spline wrap to it had

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.670 
I add the you know spline wrap to it had
to<00:02:40.150> spine<00:02:40.420> to<00:02:40.660> that<00:02:43.230> change<00:02:44.230> all<00:02:44.380> the<00:02:44.500> signs

00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:44.680 
to spine to that change all the signs

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:55.400 
to spine to that change all the signs
back<00:02:45.069> to<00:02:45.280> the<00:02:45.370> way<00:02:45.489> I<00:02:45.519> had<00:02:45.819> him

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:55.410 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:01.729 

okay

00:03:01.729 --> 00:03:01.739 

00:03:01.739 --> 00:03:05.729 

now<00:03:02.739> we<00:03:02.799> automate<00:03:03.400> it<00:03:03.549> we<00:03:04.510> get<00:03:04.659> that<00:03:04.840> sliding

00:03:05.729 --> 00:03:05.739 
now we automate it we get that sliding

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:08.759 
now we automate it we get that sliding
thing<00:03:06.360> and<00:03:07.360> you<00:03:07.540> can<00:03:07.690> also<00:03:07.810> just<00:03:08.170> shut<00:03:08.739> off

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:08.769 
thing and you can also just shut off

00:03:08.769 --> 00:03:10.530 
thing and you can also just shut off
that<00:03:09.099> bill<00:03:09.310> so<00:03:09.819> you<00:03:09.879> don't<00:03:10.120> see<00:03:10.299> it<00:03:10.390> down<00:03:10.480> here

00:03:10.530 --> 00:03:10.540 
that bill so you don't see it down here

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:14.960 
that bill so you don't see it down here
so<00:03:11.220> what<00:03:12.220> you<00:03:12.250> do<00:03:12.430> is<00:03:12.610> you<00:03:12.849> select<00:03:13.590> the<00:03:14.590> first

00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:14.970 
so what you do is you select the first

00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:19.190 
so what you do is you select the first
plane<00:03:15.970> here<00:03:16.239> and<00:03:16.690> go<00:03:16.810> to<00:03:16.870> tags<00:03:17.250> cinema<00:03:18.250> 4d

00:03:19.190 --> 00:03:19.200 
plane here and go to tags cinema 4d

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:26.009 
plane here and go to tags cinema 4d
stick<00:03:20.200> texture<00:03:21.629> and<00:03:23.879> then<00:03:24.879> you<00:03:25.000> just<00:03:25.209> copy

00:03:26.009 --> 00:03:26.019 
stick texture and then you just copy

00:03:26.019 --> 00:03:36.259 
stick texture and then you just copy
that<00:03:26.140> to<00:03:26.379> the<00:03:26.500> other<00:03:26.620> one<00:03:29.760> now<00:03:34.110> click<00:03:35.110> record

00:03:36.259 --> 00:03:36.269 
that to the other one now click record

00:03:36.269 --> 00:03:40.819 
that to the other one now click record
select<00:03:37.269> your<00:03:37.569> other<00:03:37.660> one<00:03:38.129> click<00:03:39.129> record

00:03:40.819 --> 00:03:40.829 
select your other one click record

00:03:40.829 --> 00:03:45.140 
select your other one click record
now<00:03:41.829> when<00:03:42.129> you<00:03:42.250> animate<00:03:43.209> your<00:03:43.420> spline<00:03:43.750> wrap

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150 
now when you animate your spline wrap

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:48.030 
now when you animate your spline wrap
you'll<00:03:46.150> see<00:03:46.390> that<00:03:46.540> it<00:03:46.690> sticks<00:03:47.079> to<00:03:47.260> it<00:03:47.410> the<00:03:47.890> way

00:03:48.030 --> 00:03:48.040 
you'll see that it sticks to it the way

00:03:48.040 --> 00:03:52.080 
you'll see that it sticks to it the way
we<00:03:48.160> want<00:03:48.370> it<00:03:48.489> to<00:03:49.829> and<00:03:50.829> it<00:03:51.400> doesn't<00:03:51.970> matter

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.090 
we want it to and it doesn't matter

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:55.619 
we want it to and it doesn't matter
which<00:03:52.329> direction<00:03:52.359> you<00:03:52.989> bend<00:03:53.170> it<00:03:53.319> in<00:03:53.440> or<00:03:54.540> so<00:03:55.540> we

00:03:55.619 --> 00:03:55.629 
which direction you bend it in or so we

00:03:55.629 --> 00:04:04.470 
which direction you bend it in or so we
put<00:03:55.840> it<00:03:55.900> on<00:03:55.989> X<00:03:59.459> it<00:04:00.459> still<00:04:00.760> goes<00:04:00.970> with<00:04:01.180> it<00:04:03.480> there

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:04.480 
put it on X it still goes with it there

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:07.050 
put it on X it still goes with it there
might<00:04:04.690> be<00:04:04.720> other<00:04:04.959> methods<00:04:05.560> of<00:04:05.829> doing<00:04:05.980> this<00:04:06.280> I'm

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:07.060 
might be other methods of doing this I'm

00:04:07.060 --> 00:04:11.069 
might be other methods of doing this I'm
really<00:04:07.359> not<00:04:07.480> sure<00:04:08.160> but<00:04:09.160> uh<00:04:09.780> comes<00:04:10.780> to<00:04:10.930> two

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:11.079 
really not sure but uh comes to two

00:04:11.079 --> 00:04:12.780 
really not sure but uh comes to two
planes<00:04:11.380> I<00:04:11.590> mean<00:04:12.040> I<00:04:12.099> probably<00:04:12.340> could've<00:04:12.669> just

00:04:12.780 --> 00:04:12.790 
planes I mean I probably could've just

00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:16.800 
planes I mean I probably could've just
made<00:04:13.000> one<00:04:13.209> plane<00:04:13.540> and<00:04:13.870> then<00:04:14.730> napped<00:04:15.730> 1.jpg<00:04:16.570> to

00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:16.810 
made one plane and then napped 1.jpg to

00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:21.240 
made one plane and then napped 1.jpg to
it<00:04:16.959> my<00:04:17.109> both<00:04:17.289> sides<00:04:18.209> but<00:04:19.829> this<00:04:20.829> is<00:04:20.979> a<00:04:21.010> more

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:21.250 
it my both sides but this is a more

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:23.129 
it my both sides but this is a more
interesting<00:04:21.639> thing<00:04:22.180> that<00:04:22.210> I<00:04:22.389> threw<00:04:22.720> I<00:04:22.930> thought

00:04:23.129 --> 00:04:23.139 
interesting thing that I threw I thought

00:04:23.139 --> 00:04:26.430 
interesting thing that I threw I thought
I<00:04:23.169> would<00:04:23.380> try<00:04:23.500> and<00:04:23.770> figure<00:04:24.250> out<00:04:25.020> anyway<00:04:26.020> hope

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:26.440 
I would try and figure out anyway hope

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:29.880 
I would try and figure out anyway hope
it<00:04:26.590> helped<00:04:26.880> enjoy
