probably has everybody in an uproar is
that<00:01:40.310> sivan<00:01:40.729> did<00:01:41.060> not<00:01:41.329> budget<00:01:41.899> the<00:01:42.590> idea<00:01:43.009> of

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:43.130 
that sivan did not budget the idea of

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:44.949 
that sivan did not budget the idea of
having<00:01:43.310> passed<00:01:43.729> Rangers<00:01:44.209> come<00:01:44.420> on<00:01:44.569> this<00:01:44.749> show

00:01:44.949 --> 00:01:44.959 
having passed Rangers come on this show

00:01:44.959 --> 00:01:47.830

for<00:01:45.859> this<00:01:46.039> upcoming<00:01:46.219> season<00:01:46.729> so<00:01:47.179> the<00:01:47.359> idea<00:01:47.539> is

00:01:47.830 --> 00:01:47.840 
for this upcoming season so the idea is

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.719 
for this upcoming season so the idea is
that<00:01:47.959> he<00:01:48.350> was<00:01:48.499> going<00:01:48.649> to<00:01:48.740> go<00:01:48.920> ahead<00:01:49.039> and<00:01:49.429> still

00:01:49.719 --> 00:01:49.729 
that he was going to go ahead and still

00:01:49.729 --> 00:01:52.899 
that he was going to go ahead and still
do<00:01:49.969> go<00:01:50.270> kinder<00:01:50.840> without<00:01:51.619> possibly<00:01:52.310> the<00:01:52.490> idea

00:01:52.899 --> 00:01:52.909 
do go kinder without possibly the idea

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:56.410 
do go kinder without possibly the idea
of<00:01:53.209> any<00:01:54.200> previous<00:01:54.770> cameos<00:01:55.369> okay<00:01:55.789> so<00:01:55.850> it<00:01:56.149> seems

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.420 
of any previous cameos okay so it seems

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.709 
of any previous cameos okay so it seems
like<00:01:56.600> the<00:01:56.749> idea<00:01:57.200> of<00:01:57.439> this<00:01:58.039> big<00:01:58.719> 20th

00:01:59.709 --> 00:01:59.719 
like the idea of this big 20th

00:01:59.719 --> 00:02:01.599 
like the idea of this big 20th
anniversary<00:02:00.289> celebration<00:02:00.920> of<00:02:01.039> having<00:02:01.399> passed

anniversary celebration of having passed
the<00:02:02.029> Rangers<00:02:02.389> come<00:02:02.600> by<00:02:02.779> is<00:02:03.219> apparently

00:02:04.209 --> 00:02:04.219 
the Rangers come by is apparently

00:02:04.219 --> 00:02:06.339 
the Rangers come by is apparently
something<00:02:04.639> of<00:02:04.759> a<00:02:04.880> brand<00:02:05.179> new<00:02:05.359> idea<00:02:05.779> okay<00:02:06.139> he

00:02:06.339 --> 00:02:06.349 
something of a brand new idea okay he

00:02:06.349 --> 00:02:08.440 
something of a brand new idea okay he
didn't<00:02:06.619> have<00:02:06.770> the<00:02:07.039> family<00:02:07.520> according<00:02:08.209> to<00:02:08.240> the

automatically jump on the bandwagon of

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:08.810 
automatically jump on the bandwagon of
how<00:04:07.290> dares<00:04:07.590> a<00:04:07.740> bond<00:04:07.950> do<00:04:08.130> something<00:04:08.490> like<00:04:08.610> that

00:04:08.810 --> 00:04:08.820 
how dares a bond do something like that

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:11.300 
how dares a bond do something like that

people should not get that upset with
the<00:04:33.180> idea<00:04:33.540> of<00:04:33.600> what's<00:04:33.870> happening<00:04:34.380> do<00:04:35.190> what<00:04:35.370> I

something<00:04:46.380> that<00:04:46.560> pass<00:04:47.130> Rangers<00:04:47.610> would<00:04:47.760> like

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:48.030 
something that pass Rangers would like

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:50.480

interested considering the circumstances

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:55.490 
interested considering the circumstances
we<00:04:53.190> would<00:04:53.340> love<00:04:53.580> to<00:04:53.639> have<00:04:53.880> you<00:04:54.090> okay<00:04:54.810> from<00:04:55.380> that

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:55.500 
we would love to have you okay from that

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:57.920 
we would love to have you okay from that
point<00:04:55.710> on<00:04:55.919> I<00:04:56.220> think<00:04:56.580> so<00:04:56.910> bomb<00:04:57.090> wipes<00:04:57.450> his<00:04:57.660> hands

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:57.930 
point on I think so bomb wipes his hands

00:04:57.930 --> 00:05:00.380 
point on I think so bomb wipes his hands
clean<00:04:58.320> and<00:04:58.560> at<00:04:59.070> that<00:04:59.100> point<00:04:59.490> it<00:04:59.700> becomes<00:05:00.000> up<00:05:00.240> to

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:00.390 
clean and at that point it becomes up to

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:02.900 
clean and at that point it becomes up to
the<00:05:00.510> pass<00:05:00.690> ranges<00:05:01.110> to<00:05:01.200> the<00:05:01.410> side<00:05:01.650> is<00:05:01.980> it<00:05:02.610> really

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:02.910 
the pass ranges to the side is it really

00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:04.550 
the pass ranges to the side is it really
worth<00:05:03.270> it<00:05:03.480> and<00:05:03.660> if<00:05:03.780> it<00:05:03.900> is<00:05:04.020> for<00:05:04.260> them<00:05:04.380> than<00:05:04.530> it

00:05:04.550 --> 00:05:04.560 
worth it and if it is for them than it

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:07.040 
worth it and if it is for them than it
is<00:05:04.710> if<00:05:04.919> it's<00:05:05.070> not<00:05:05.280> that<00:05:05.580> it's<00:05:05.730> not<00:05:05.910> okay<00:05:06.720> like<00:05:06.930> I

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:07.050 
is if it's not that it's not okay like I

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:09.380 
is if it's not that it's not okay like I
said<00:05:07.110> before<00:05:07.350> my<00:05:07.710> past<00:05:07.980> video<00:05:08.520> you<00:05:09.210> have

people like Jason David Frank that would

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:13.190

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:17.790 
cameo for a dollar or for free which I'm

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:20.390 
cameo for a dollar or for free which I'm
sure<00:05:17.970> he's<00:05:18.150> not<00:05:18.300> going<00:05:18.630> to<00:05:18.750> but<00:05:18.990> still<00:05:19.290> I<00:05:19.560> mean

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:20.400 
sure he's not going to but still I mean

00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:24.050 
sure he's not going to but still I mean

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:24.060 
the fact that he would do that speaks

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:26.659 
the fact that he would do that speaks
volumes<00:05:24.630> compared<00:05:25.320> to<00:05:25.470> others<00:05:25.830> that<00:05:26.400> while

volumes compared to others that while
they<00:05:26.790> may<00:05:26.970> not<00:05:27.150> have<00:05:27.330> the<00:05:27.360> same<00:05:27.479> successes<00:05:28.350> jdf

they may not have the same successes jdf

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:32.060 
they may not have the same successes jdf
that<00:05:30.570> they<00:05:30.720> don't<00:05:30.930> see<00:05:31.320> it<00:05:31.410> the<00:05:31.530> same<00:05:31.560> exact

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:32.070 
that they don't see it the same exact

00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:33.469 
that they don't see it the same exact
way<00:05:32.280> and<00:05:32.400> there's<00:05:32.550> nothing<00:05:32.760> wrong<00:05:32.970> with<00:05:33.180> that

00:05:37.159 --> 00:05:37.169 
but I think at some point in time

00:05:37.169 --> 00:05:40.520 
but I think at some point in time
