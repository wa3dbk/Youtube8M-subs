00:00:55.369 --> 00:00:55.379 
a sound quality little sound test I did

00:00:55.379 --> 00:00:58.639 
a sound quality little sound test I did
that<00:00:55.559> the<00:00:55.800> sound<00:00:56.070> is<00:00:56.370> is<00:00:56.550> better<00:00:57.329> and<00:00:57.930> to<00:00:58.530> give

00:00:58.639 --> 00:00:58.649 
that the sound is is better and to give

00:00:58.649 --> 00:01:00.200 
that the sound is is better and to give
ample<00:00:58.829> credit<00:00:59.190> is<00:00:59.399> better<00:00:59.609> than<00:00:59.760> the<00:00:59.820> low<00:00:59.969> end

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210 
ample credit is better than the low end

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.599 
ample credit is better than the low end
as<00:01:00.480> they<00:01:00.780> claim<00:01:01.620> and<00:01:01.800> their<00:01:01.920> commercials<00:01:02.430> and

00:01:02.599 --> 00:01:02.609 
as they claim and their commercials and

00:01:02.609 --> 00:01:05.990 
as they claim and their commercials and
as<00:01:02.699> I've<00:01:02.910> heard<00:01:04.309> through<00:01:05.309> the<00:01:05.519> reviews<00:01:05.850> I

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000 
as I've heard through the reviews I

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.179 
as I've heard through the reviews I
guess<00:01:06.180> but<00:01:07.170> so<00:01:07.530> then<00:01:07.650> you<00:01:07.740> can<00:01:07.830> tell<00:01:07.979> there's<00:01:08.159> a

00:01:08.179 --> 00:01:08.189 
guess but so then you can tell there's a

00:01:08.189 --> 00:01:08.990 
guess but so then you can tell there's a
little<00:01:08.250> bit<00:01:08.430> of<00:01:08.490> difference<00:01:08.760> to<00:01:08.790> the

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:09.000 
little bit of difference to the

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.520 
little bit of difference to the
microphone<00:01:09.420> I<00:01:09.600> checked<00:01:09.900> I<00:01:10.140> checked<00:01:10.350> them<00:01:10.470> out

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
microphone I checked I checked them out

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.380 
microphone I checked I checked them out
a<00:01:10.590> minute<00:01:10.890> ago<00:01:10.979> and<00:01:11.310> I<00:01:11.700> compared<00:01:12.119> the<00:01:12.270> two

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:12.390 
a minute ago and I compared the two

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.399 
a minute ago and I compared the two
videos<00:01:12.780> and<00:01:14.630> definitely<00:01:15.630> you<00:01:16.049> get<00:01:16.170> a<00:01:16.200> more

00:01:16.399 --> 00:01:16.409 
videos and definitely you get a more

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:17.810 
videos and definitely you get a more
range<00:01:16.680> sounds<00:01:17.220> like<00:01:17.369> you<00:01:17.520> have<00:01:17.610> a<00:01:17.640> better

00:01:17.810 --> 00:01:17.820 
range sounds like you have a better

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:20.440 
range sounds like you have a better
range<00:01:18.119> of<00:01:18.509> sounds<00:01:19.500> that<00:01:19.619> are<00:01:19.710> being<00:01:19.830> captured

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:20.450 
range of sounds that are being captured

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:23.210 
range of sounds that are being captured
ok<00:01:21.450> now<00:01:21.780> we're<00:01:21.990> doing<00:01:22.110> the<00:01:22.380> moving<00:01:22.590> test<00:01:22.950> for

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220 
ok now we're doing the moving test for

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.740 
ok now we're doing the moving test for
your<00:01:23.340> pod<00:01:23.549> headphones

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:24.750 
your pod headphones

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.350 
your pod headphones

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
again we'll compare with the other ones

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:52.670 
again we'll compare with the other ones
and<00:01:49.700> see<00:01:50.700> we<00:01:50.820> come<00:01:51.030> up<00:01:51.120> we<00:01:51.300> to<00:01:51.390> hear<00:01:51.510> myself<00:01:51.720> if

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:52.680 
and see we come up we to hear myself if

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.020 
and see we come up we to hear myself if
there's<00:01:52.920> someone<00:01:53.160> sitting<00:01:53.400> next<00:01:53.460> to<00:01:53.700> me<00:01:53.850> they

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:54.030 
there's someone sitting next to me they

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:55.460 
there's someone sitting next to me they
would<00:01:54.120> have<00:01:54.270> a<00:01:54.300> really<00:01:54.750> really<00:01:54.930> really<00:01:55.230> hard

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
would have a really really really hard

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.010 
would have a really really really hard
time<00:01:55.740> hearing<00:01:55.950> me<00:01:56.160> at<00:01:56.880> the<00:01:57.600> volume<00:01:57.900> I'm

00:01:58.010 --> 00:01:58.020 
time hearing me at the volume I'm

00:01:58.020 --> 00:01:59.630 
time hearing me at the volume I'm
talking<00:01:58.410> in<00:01:58.530> fact<00:01:58.710> it'll<00:01:58.860> be<00:01:58.950> impossible<00:01:59.190> oh

00:01:59.630 --> 00:01:59.640 
talking in fact it'll be impossible oh

00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:05.390 
talking in fact it'll be impossible oh
yeah<00:02:00.680> now<00:02:01.680> we're<00:02:01.740> jamming<00:02:02.220> my<00:02:02.490> jam<00:02:03.530> so<00:02:04.530> I<00:02:04.800> don't

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:05.400 
yeah now we're jamming my jam so I don't

00:02:05.400 --> 00:02:07.070 
yeah now we're jamming my jam so I don't
I'll<00:02:05.640> see<00:02:05.760> how<00:02:05.820> this<00:02:05.970> sounds<00:02:06.119> like<00:02:06.360> and<00:02:06.780> again

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:07.080 
I'll see how this sounds like and again

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:08.469 
I'll see how this sounds like and again
we'll<00:02:07.229> compare<00:02:07.500> with<00:02:07.680> the<00:02:07.800> other<00:02:07.920> ones<00:02:08.130> and

00:02:08.469 --> 00:02:08.479 
we'll compare with the other ones and

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:16.820 
we'll compare with the other ones and
see<00:02:09.479> what<00:02:09.600> we<00:02:09.660> come<00:02:09.780> up<00:02:15.260> alright<00:02:16.260> so<00:02:16.320> what<00:02:16.680> have

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:16.830 
see what we come up alright so what have

00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.760 
see what we come up alright so what have
we<00:02:16.860> learned<00:02:17.250> today<00:02:17.430> about<00:02:17.790> the<00:02:18.770> differences

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:19.770 
we learned today about the differences

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:22.130 
we learned today about the differences
between<00:02:19.830> Apple<00:02:20.580> nuclear<00:02:21.090> phones<00:02:21.360> in<00:02:21.690> the<00:02:21.900> old

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:22.140 
between Apple nuclear phones in the old

00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:24.920 
between Apple nuclear phones in the old
earphones<00:02:22.590> basically<00:02:23.240> this<00:02:24.240> is<00:02:24.450> basically

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:24.930 
earphones basically this is basically

00:02:24.930 --> 00:02:27.290 
earphones basically this is basically
the<00:02:25.080> conclusion<00:02:25.620> I've<00:02:25.830> come<00:02:25.860> to<00:02:26.280> and<00:02:27.090> that's

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.300 
the conclusion I've come to and that's

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.030 
the conclusion I've come to and that's
uh<00:02:27.660> there's<00:02:27.959> really<00:02:28.020> not<00:02:28.320> much<00:02:28.530> difference<00:02:28.950> in

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:29.040 
uh there's really not much difference in

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:31.220 
uh there's really not much difference in
the<00:02:29.160> microphone<00:02:29.610> quality<00:02:29.840> except<00:02:30.840> that<00:02:31.050> the

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:31.230 
the microphone quality except that the

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:32.720 
the microphone quality except that the
range<00:02:31.440> is<00:02:31.650> a<00:02:31.680> little<00:02:31.920> bit<00:02:32.010> better<00:02:32.130> with<00:02:32.519> the

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:32.730 
range is a little bit better with the

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.259 
range is a little bit better with the
new<00:02:32.940> ear<00:02:33.930> pod<00:02:34.310> headphones<00:02:35.310> the<00:02:35.670> range<00:02:35.910> so<00:02:36.239> you

00:02:36.259 --> 00:02:36.269 
new ear pod headphones the range so you

00:02:36.269 --> 00:02:38.300 
new ear pod headphones the range so you
get<00:02:36.450> a<00:02:36.480> little<00:02:36.660> more<00:02:36.810> on<00:02:37.050> the<00:02:37.620> low<00:02:37.739> end<00:02:37.769> get<00:02:38.280> a

00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:38.310 
get a little more on the low end get a

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:39.890 
get a little more on the low end get a
little<00:02:38.519> more<00:02:38.670> on<00:02:38.760> the<00:02:38.850> high<00:02:39.000> end<00:02:39.030> a<00:02:39.450> little<00:02:39.810> bit

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:39.900 
little more on the high end a little bit

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.570 
little more on the high end a little bit
better<00:02:40.050> sound<00:02:40.380> quality<00:02:40.500> but<00:02:41.310> that's<00:02:41.430> not

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:41.580 
better sound quality but that's not

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:43.340 
better sound quality but that's not
necessarily<00:02:42.090> a<00:02:42.269> good<00:02:42.360> thing<00:02:42.750> when<00:02:42.959> you're<00:02:43.140> in

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:43.350 
necessarily a good thing when you're in

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:45.020 
necessarily a good thing when you're in
your<00:02:43.530> car<00:02:43.739> and<00:02:44.130> there's<00:02:44.400> all<00:02:44.519> kinds<00:02:44.790> of<00:02:44.820> road

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.030 
your car and there's all kinds of road

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:48.110 
your car and there's all kinds of road
noises<00:02:45.600> and<00:02:45.930> it's<00:02:46.380> not<00:02:46.530> really<00:02:46.890> tone<00:02:47.580> exactly

00:02:48.110 --> 00:02:48.120 
noises and it's not really tone exactly

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:49.070 
noises and it's not really tone exactly
it's<00:02:48.209> your<00:02:48.330> voice<00:02:48.570> it's<00:02:48.840> not<00:02:48.900> always

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.080 
it's your voice it's not always

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:51.590 
it's your voice it's not always
specified<00:02:49.680> narrowed<00:02:50.640> down<00:02:50.670> to<00:02:50.850> pick<00:02:51.420> up<00:02:51.510> the

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:51.600 
specified narrowed down to pick up the

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.000 
specified narrowed down to pick up the
frequencies<00:02:52.019> of<00:02:52.110> your<00:02:52.260> voice<00:02:52.440> it's<00:02:52.830> very

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:53.010 
frequencies of your voice it's very

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:54.770 
frequencies of your voice it's very
broad<00:02:53.280> picks<00:02:53.670> up<00:02:53.790> a<00:02:53.850> lot<00:02:53.970> of<00:02:54.120> frequencies<00:02:54.630> that

00:02:54.770 --> 00:02:54.780 
broad picks up a lot of frequencies that

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:56.780 
broad picks up a lot of frequencies that
you<00:02:54.870> might<00:02:55.230> not<00:02:55.440> want<00:02:55.709> so<00:02:55.980> that<00:02:56.340> might<00:02:56.519> not<00:02:56.670> be

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:56.790 
you might not want so that might not be

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:59.479 
you might not want so that might not be
a<00:02:56.820> good<00:02:56.970> thing<00:02:57.030> but<00:02:57.420> the<00:02:57.600> overall<00:02:58.220> it<00:02:59.220> actually

00:02:59.479 --> 00:02:59.489 
a good thing but the overall it actually

00:02:59.489 --> 00:03:01.070 
a good thing but the overall it actually
makes<00:02:59.610> it<00:02:59.700> a<00:02:59.760> better<00:02:59.850> for<00:03:00.060> broadcaster<00:03:00.870> for

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:01.080 
makes it a better for broadcaster for

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.600 
makes it a better for broadcaster for
other<00:03:01.200> things<00:03:01.290> like<00:03:01.709> if<00:03:01.950> I<00:03:02.040> were<00:03:02.190> talking<00:03:02.519> to

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:02.610 
other things like if I were talking to

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:03.860 
other things like if I were talking to
you<00:03:02.700> here<00:03:02.910> these<00:03:03.150> would<00:03:03.390> probably<00:03:03.690> be<00:03:03.840> a

00:03:03.860 --> 00:03:03.870 
you here these would probably be a

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:06.500 
you here these would probably be a
better<00:03:04.080> choice<00:03:04.350> uses<00:03:05.310> you<00:03:05.489> core<00:03:05.940> than<00:03:06.239> the<00:03:06.360> old

00:03:06.500 --> 00:03:06.510 
better choice uses you core than the old

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:08.990 
better choice uses you core than the old
headphones<00:03:07.170> because<00:03:07.410> of<00:03:07.709> the<00:03:07.860> greater<00:03:08.730> range

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:09.000 
headphones because of the greater range

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.979 
headphones because of the greater range
of<00:03:09.560> sound<00:03:10.560> capture<00:03:11.070> so<00:03:11.310> that<00:03:12.269> might<00:03:12.630> be<00:03:12.810> a<00:03:12.840> good

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:12.989 
of sound capture so that might be a good

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:14.840 
of sound capture so that might be a good
thing<00:03:13.170> but<00:03:13.410> oh<00:03:13.620> man<00:03:14.100> there's<00:03:14.340> really<00:03:14.430> not<00:03:14.640> much

00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:14.850 
thing but oh man there's really not much

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:15.920 
thing but oh man there's really not much
difference<00:03:14.910> I<00:03:15.390> thought<00:03:15.570> to<00:03:15.690> be<00:03:15.750> more

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
difference I thought to be more

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:19.070 
difference I thought to be more
different<00:03:16.170> so<00:03:16.380> I'm<00:03:16.739> a<00:03:16.799> little<00:03:17.040> bit<00:03:17.160> sad<00:03:17.630> but<00:03:18.630> as

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:19.080 
different so I'm a little bit sad but as

00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:20.660 
different so I'm a little bit sad but as
far<00:03:19.350> as<00:03:19.380> the<00:03:19.709> quality<00:03:20.010> of<00:03:20.190> the<00:03:20.310> earbuds

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670 
far as the quality of the earbuds

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:22.370 
far as the quality of the earbuds
themselves<00:03:20.790> the<00:03:21.750> better<00:03:21.900> a<00:03:22.140> little<00:03:22.200> bit

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:22.380 
themselves the better a little bit

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:23.870 
themselves the better a little bit
better<00:03:22.440> not<00:03:22.920> a<00:03:22.950> whole<00:03:23.220> lot<00:03:23.400> better<00:03:23.580> but<00:03:23.820> a

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:23.880 
better not a whole lot better but a

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:25.910 
better not a whole lot better but a
little<00:03:24.060> bit<00:03:24.209> better<00:03:24.360> and<00:03:25.350> they're<00:03:25.620> much<00:03:25.739> more

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:25.920 
little bit better and they're much more

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:27.770 
little bit better and they're much more
comfortable<00:03:26.070> um<00:03:26.549> so<00:03:27.299> here's<00:03:27.480> the<00:03:27.630> catch

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:27.780 
comfortable um so here's the catch

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.710 
comfortable um so here's the catch
here's<00:03:28.080> the<00:03:28.170> big<00:03:28.410> the<00:03:29.070> big<00:03:29.310> thing<00:03:30.239> that<00:03:30.269> Apple

00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:30.720 
here's the big the big thing that Apple
