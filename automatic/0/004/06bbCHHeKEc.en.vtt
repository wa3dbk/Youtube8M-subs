00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:22.529
 a great tangent as we are a new 

00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:26.110
 video and I bring a video tutorial of how 

00:00:22.529 --> 00:00:27.849
 how to repair league of law inside the 

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:31.210
 another day he was playing with a few 

00:00:27.849 --> 00:00:32.950
 subscribers when we suddenly had 

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:35.050
 How good to look for game three or 

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:37.360
 four times because they always 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:39.640
 The book was closed 

00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:41.460
 nailed league of legends then when 

00:00:39.640 --> 00:00:43.989
 we got in each game was 

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:47.589
 five minutes to dry because you were 

00:00:43.989 --> 00:00:50.309
 he was stuck and he could not play and I 

00:00:47.589 --> 00:00:53.109
 I said it was good that I would make this video that 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:54.999
 I would try to explain how to fix it 

00:00:53.109 --> 00:00:56.199
 I do not know if you know how to explain it 

00:00:54.999 --> 00:00:58.059
 easy but let's see if he treated me well 

00:00:56.199 --> 00:00:59.649
 explaining how to do to 

00:00:58.059 --> 00:01:01.539
 fix these mistakes because we were 

00:00:59.649 --> 00:01:04.839
 talking I had a computer 

00:01:01.539 --> 00:01:06.490
 relatively good use neither does either 

00:01:04.839 --> 00:01:07.820
 it was a potato no computer the 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:10.580
 pot 

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:14.120
 but we did not conclude that 

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:16.490
 the problem but that was problem you 

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:19.430
 league of legends so let's go 

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:20.780
 starting with this good tutorial this 

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:22.909
 it's better to desktop than ninth the 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:24.200
 case well the first thing we have to 

00:01:22.909 --> 00:01:27.800
 to do is give him to play league of 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:30.320
 legends and learning to play him 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:32.640
 we will have to give these gears of 

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:37.590
 here are the options 

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:42.360
 and we will see them of fuck we will give them to 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:45.810
 repair once when you already must 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.670
 repair the son push-ups he will erase by 

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.990
 so to say it completely the data of 

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:54.660
 file knows of patches of champions of 

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:56.850
 objects erase absolutely everything and 

00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:59.700
 will leave the computer so to speak without 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.960
 No patch of the fleteros fig as is 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:03.090
 we were the game and we play 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:04.680
 everything has to be installed because it would be 

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.509
 more or less the same others without having to 

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.520
 install and uninstall then they are at 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:11.220
 of the remembered ones you are just the two 

00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:13.980
 bars that will take quite medium what 

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:15.620
 it says here and it's even completed in tel 

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:17.970
 aviv attention can take a long time 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:21.450
 having a lot of time is not six hours 

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:22.830
 but it can take half an hour 

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:24.100
 time depending on the computer that 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:27.500
 have 

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:32.060
 now and a half so you give 

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:37.439
 there would be charged what is being him 

00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:40.079
 again the game and we would have bingo 

00:02:37.439 --> 00:02:42.209
 files jones repaired that is with all 

00:02:40.079 --> 00:02:44.030
 the deleted files installed from 

00:02:42.209 --> 00:02:46.700
 new correctly 

00:02:44.030 --> 00:02:49.640
 in this way we risk fix 

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.840
 many, many problems that 

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:53.360
 We have with League of Legends and 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:54.650
 this way we will erase them so 

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:57.140
 guys I think you liked a 

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:59.030
 cortito but good video is not 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:02.290
 I hope you liked it and see you 

00:02:59.030 --> 00:03:02.290
