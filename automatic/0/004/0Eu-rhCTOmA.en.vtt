00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:04.290
 hello to all and welcome to this 

00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:05.370
 mac skill tutorial or 

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:06.180
 today we will talk a little about 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.059
 screen sharing 

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.679
 so that's a function that has been 

00:00:08.059 --> 00:00:13.710
 implemented in leopard that did not exist 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:15.120
 not under tiger so what is really 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.760
 practice in screen sharing it's 

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:20.580
 of course if you have two macs or more at 

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:23.670
 the house you can from a mac 

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:24.859
 see the screen and so use the other 

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:27.689
 remote mac 

00:00:24.859 --> 00:00:32.550
 so to do that we have to go into 

00:00:27.689 --> 00:00:35.250
 the system preferences share you 

00:00:32.550 --> 00:00:37.530
 check where you tick screen sharing 

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:39.180
 so be already check or be you 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:43.980
 tick so you have nothing else to 

00:00:39.180 --> 00:00:45.719
 to logically make your computers 

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:48.360
 are already networked otherwise I'll you 

00:00:45.719 --> 00:00:53.250
 advise to consult the skill mac 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:56.579
 number 4 where we talk about the network between 

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:59.070
 make up between pc and so that's where I 

00:00:56.579 --> 00:01:02.460
 see that the imac that lies in a 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.420
 other piece is available here so I 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.610
 see the shared folders 

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.369
 so the screen sharing the button is 

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:13.470
 just here so I'm going to click 

00:01:08.369 --> 00:01:16.080
 on screen sharing in have and in words of 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.470
 pass so you have to put that then it's 

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.180
 important 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.659
 you have to put the name and the password 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:23.729
 of the session that is on the imac 

00:01:21.659 --> 00:01:25.229
 so on the other computer so you 

00:01:23.729 --> 00:01:27.270
 put the name and password of the 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:28.320
 session that you want to use and to 

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:32.820
 which you want to access 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:35.090
 so I'm going to put my login and word 

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.090
 password 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.960
 if you connect to it regularly, 

00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:40.670
 can check keep this password 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:43.050
 in my keychain 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:45.240
 good normally you know your words 

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:46.950
 password so I advise you to 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.510
 to retype it every time to prevent 

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.460
 others can access 

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:57.200
 your data and so there we do it 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:57.200
 connect here in a window 

00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:03.150
 that I can move as I wish 

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:05.610
 I have my session which is on the 

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:11.340
 imac in the other room so is I can 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:13.700
 check my emails all shortcuts 

00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:16.890
 keyboard works the keyboard etc 

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:18.480
 you can type text you can 

00:02:16.890 --> 00:02:20.340
 really use your mac as if 

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.930
 you were in front so it's still 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:23.850
 super convenient for example if you are 

00:02:21.930 --> 00:02:26.310
 in the living room on your computer 

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:28.440
 portable and want to access the 

00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:28.980
 station with fixed mcs that is in a 

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.330
 other room 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.670
 you need more of you 

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:34.590
 lift up and move around to make 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:37.230
 changes check your emails etc 

00:02:34.590 --> 00:02:40.739
 thanks to the screen sharing it is done in 

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:42.660
 a click and it's super fast so there the 

00:02:40.739 --> 00:02:46.470
 imac for info it is in wifi in 

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:48.000
 the other room and there is almost no 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:50.790
 of slowdown I can really 

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.980
 use it as if I were 

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.840
 so here's a function 

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:57.180
 super convenient so activated in the 

00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:00.750
 sharing system preferences you tick 

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:04.709
 screen sharing and you access it via the 

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:06.480
 finder you do what you have to 

00:03:04.709 --> 00:03:08.550
 to do on your mac and to leave you 

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:11.610
 just do screen sharing left 

00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:13.350
 screen sharing so that was so it was a 

00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:16.040
 little tutorial to discover this function 

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:18.570
 which for me has become indispensable 

00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:20.100
 I imagine not having to move from one room 

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:20.790
 to each other to access my to my 

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:23.130
 different mac 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:26.420
 so here it is it's really a 

00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:28.170
 function to use without hesitation 

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:31.340
 here I wish you a good 

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:31.340
 continuation on your mac
