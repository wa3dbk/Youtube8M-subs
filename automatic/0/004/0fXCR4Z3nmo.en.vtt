00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:07.600
 hello how are you having a good day 

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:10.660
 today we are going to bring you the tutorial of how 

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:14.409
 install or how to start using the 

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:17.490
 canon mp 230 printer or with system 

00:00:14.409 --> 00:00:19.869
 continuous flow in the printer when 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.300
 comes from the factory in this case this 

00:00:19.869 --> 00:00:24.820
 printer had already been used true 

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:27.220
 but it comes from repair for a problem 

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:30.669
 that came from the printer when it comes 

00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:33.580
 new come all the holes of the 

00:00:30.669 --> 00:00:35.530
 covered boats like in this case 

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:38.410
 before turning on the printer what 

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:40.570
 we should do is throw the plugs 

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:42.329
 small of the filters that are these and 

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:43.920
 place them 

00:00:42.329 --> 00:00:46.199
 in this case we are going to do this 

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.890
 procedure the filter has to be 

00:00:46.199 --> 00:00:51.280
 place by the thickest part 

00:00:48.890 --> 00:00:55.010
 in the filter hole this without 

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:57.590
 uncover the hole in the hole in the 

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:58.780
 main compartment that would be this 

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:01.760
 plug 

00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:04.430
 once placed the filters will be 

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:07.240
 this way in the printer comes a 

00:01:04.430 --> 00:01:09.890
 sheet also with an instruction how 

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:12.240
 do it that the same process that I'm 

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:14.909
 using right now 

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:17.670
 if in a certain case they will need 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:20.070
 fill a pot because it has no ink 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:22.439
 in this case what we have to do is 

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:25.680
 remove the filters for example the 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:29.880
 pot filter we put the cap of the 

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:31.590
 filter and then unclog the plug 

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:35.130
 big that's where we're going to pour 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:37.469
 the ink in this way 

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:40.829
 if we do wrong the procedure of 

00:01:37.469 --> 00:01:43.259
 place the filters what will happen will be 

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:44.909
 that the lower level that the boat brings 

00:01:43.259 --> 00:01:48.240
 in the filter compartment that 

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:50.280
 is this will be matched to the same level of 

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:52.500
 main compartment of the ink what 

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:55.060
 which is explained on the reverse page that 

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.729
 comes in the printer 

00:01:55.060 --> 00:02:00.040
 and bring the solution also in this case 

00:01:57.729 --> 00:02:02.940
 We are going to set the example when 

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:06.080
 remove the complete cap 

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:08.450
 what happens 

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:10.280
 as you can see when removing both plugs 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:12.770
 what has happened is that the level of 

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:15.230
 ink has run in the compartment 

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:18.050
 of the filter to do when this happens 

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:21.230
 in this case what we should do is 

00:02:18.050 --> 00:02:22.790
 Replace the cap and seal it 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:26.180
 what we will have to do is withdraw all 

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:29.000
 the plugs of the other boats for 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:33.110
 to be able to flip the printer and that the 

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:35.780
 level go back to its form in this case 

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:37.550
 when we have already covered the two boats 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:40.190
 so that it does not happen we do not close what 

00:02:37.550 --> 00:02:43.060
 let's do is grab the three 

00:02:40.190 --> 00:02:46.490
 hours on the opposite side and 

00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:48.770
 we turn to the right so that 

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:51.440
 the level that brings in the compartment 

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:53.570
 of the filters come back below the 

00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:56.150
 main level in this case when 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:58.250
 we do this procedure the level 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:00.050
 it comes back up molado in the one that has 

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:01.880
 to be if the level is the same 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:04.070
 main compartment level what 

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:08.380
 what will happen will be that at the moment of 

00:03:04.070 --> 00:03:08.380
 print the sheet will be stained with ink
