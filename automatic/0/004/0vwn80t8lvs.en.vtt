00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.620 
of these paint and then you're just
going<00:02:02.739> to<00:02:02.830> let<00:02:03.099> that<00:02:03.250> sit<00:02:03.640> out<00:02:03.819> and<00:02:04.000> dry<00:02:04.360> until

00:02:04.620 --> 00:02:04.630

my local hardware store and I thought I

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:24.590

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:11.280 
the poor of this is to kind of give it a

00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.250 
the poor of this is to kind of give it a
little<00:03:11.310> bit<00:03:11.580> more<00:03:11.760> thickness<00:03:12.060> so<00:03:12.840> I<00:03:12.870> just<00:03:13.050> pop

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:13.260

little centerpiece and to make it look a
little<00:03:17.550> bit<00:03:17.760> nicer<00:03:17.940> I<00:03:18.180> just<00:03:18.510> painted<00:03:18.810> the

00:03:18.920 --> 00:03:18.930 
little bit nicer I just painted the

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:23.000 
little bit nicer I just painted the
