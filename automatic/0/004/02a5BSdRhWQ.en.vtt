00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:31.310 
weather which is why i was unable to use
it<00:02:29.220> when<00:02:29.370> she<00:02:29.490> first<00:02:29.790> sent<00:02:30.060> it<00:02:30.240> to<00:02:30.450> me<00:02:30.630> and<00:02:30.840> so

00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:31.320 
it when she first sent it to me and so

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:33.860 
it when she first sent it to me and so
I've<00:02:31.500> had<00:02:31.770> it<00:02:31.980> since<00:02:32.240> January<00:02:33.240> and<00:02:33.510> a<00:02:33.570> little

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870 
I've had it since January and a little

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.020 
I've had it since January and a little
bit<00:02:33.990> of<00:02:34.020> this<00:02:34.290> goes<00:02:34.590> a<00:02:34.800> very<00:02:35.130> very<00:02:35.400> long<00:02:35.700> way

00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:36.030 
bit of this goes a very very long way

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:37.850 
bit of this goes a very very long way
and<00:02:36.510> I<00:02:36.720> don't<00:02:36.930> know<00:02:37.020> how<00:02:37.170> well<00:02:37.410> you<00:02:37.440> can<00:02:37.650> see

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:37.860 
and I don't know how well you can see

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:42.200 
and I don't know how well you can see
that<00:02:38.670> but<00:02:39.210> it's<00:02:39.390> still<00:02:39.780> here<00:02:40.680> in<00:02:40.860> the<00:02:41.760> package

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:42.210 
that but it's still here in the package

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:44.900 
that but it's still here in the package
and<00:02:42.390> this<00:02:42.960> here<00:02:43.410> is<00:02:43.440> um<00:02:43.950> I<00:02:44.250> think<00:02:44.280> it's<00:02:44.580> a<00:02:44.640> four

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:44.910 
and this here is um I think it's a four

00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:46.790 
and this here is um I think it's a four
ounce<00:02:45.090> and<00:02:45.450> it<00:02:45.570> retails<00:02:45.959> for<00:02:46.110> anything<00:02:46.410> ten

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:46.800 
ounce and it retails for anything ten

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:49.820 
ounce and it retails for anything ten
dollars<00:02:46.950> if<00:02:47.280> I'm<00:02:47.430> not<00:02:48.020> correct<00:02:49.020> I<00:02:49.200> list<00:02:49.709> the

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:49.830 
dollars if I'm not correct I list the

dollars if I'm not correct I list the
price<00:02:50.070> here<00:02:50.370> below<00:02:50.700> but<00:02:51.360> I<00:02:51.390> mean<00:02:51.630> it's<00:02:51.840> very

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:52.110 
price here below but I mean it's very

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:54.740 
price here below but I mean it's very
good<00:02:52.440> oil<00:02:52.740> it<00:02:53.130> works<00:02:53.459> well<00:02:53.760> for<00:02:54.060> me<00:02:54.209> it<00:02:54.480> gives

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750 
good oil it works well for me it gives

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.690 
good oil it works well for me it gives
me<00:02:54.959> a<00:02:54.990> lot<00:02:55.200> of<00:02:55.260> shine<00:02:55.530> when<00:02:55.890> I<00:02:55.920> do<00:02:56.040> use<00:02:56.430> it<00:02:56.459> I

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700 
me a lot of shine when I do use it I

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.360 
me a lot of shine when I do use it I
don't<00:02:56.940> have<00:02:57.150> issues<00:02:57.540> with<00:02:58.500> a<00:02:58.560> lot<00:02:58.800> of<00:02:58.830> friends

00:02:59.360 --> 00:02:59.370 
don't have issues with a lot of friends

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.340 
don't have issues with a lot of friends
when<00:02:59.550> I<00:02:59.580> use<00:02:59.850> it<00:03:00.030> as<00:03:00.150> well<00:03:00.390> and<00:03:00.660> usually<00:03:01.140> when<00:03:01.290> I

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:01.350 
when I use it as well and usually when I

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:03.740 
when I use it as well and usually when I
use<00:03:01.560> coconut<00:03:01.860> oil<00:03:02.310> it<00:03:02.670> makes<00:03:03.270> my<00:03:03.480> hair

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:03.750 
use coconut oil it makes my hair

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:06.290 
use coconut oil it makes my hair
extremely<00:03:04.470> hard<00:03:04.830> which<00:03:05.190> is<00:03:05.340> why<00:03:05.550> I<00:03:05.610> was<00:03:06.030> kind

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:06.300 
extremely hard which is why I was kind

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:08.750 
extremely hard which is why I was kind
of<00:03:06.360> leery<00:03:06.690> with<00:03:07.050> this<00:03:07.260> but<00:03:07.860> I<00:03:07.890> guess<00:03:08.160> since<00:03:08.459> the

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:08.760 
of leery with this but I guess since the

00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:11.060 
of leery with this but I guess since the
shea<00:03:09.000> butter<00:03:09.030> is<00:03:09.570> the<00:03:09.930> first<00:03:10.200> ingredient<00:03:10.470> and

00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:11.070 
shea butter is the first ingredient and

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:13.880 
shea butter is the first ingredient and
that<00:03:11.490> the<00:03:11.640> coconut<00:03:12.150> is<00:03:12.450> second<00:03:13.110> that<00:03:13.620> it<00:03:13.740> made

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:13.890 
that the coconut is second that it made

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:15.920 
that the coconut is second that it made
a<00:03:13.920> little<00:03:14.250> bit<00:03:14.340> of<00:03:14.370> a<00:03:14.550> distant<00:03:14.970> difference<00:03:15.660> and

00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:15.930 
a little bit of a distant difference and

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:17.690 
a little bit of a distant difference and
also<00:03:16.320> probably<00:03:16.650> because<00:03:16.950> I<00:03:17.070> use<00:03:17.250> them<00:03:17.430> more<00:03:17.580> as

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:17.700 
also probably because I use them more as

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:20.660 
also probably because I use them more as
a<00:03:17.820> finisher<00:03:18.300> rather<00:03:18.570> than<00:03:18.920> applying<00:03:19.920> it<00:03:20.280> on<00:03:20.400> my

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:20.670 
a finisher rather than applying it on my

00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:22.790 
a finisher rather than applying it on my
clean<00:03:20.940> naked<00:03:21.239> hair<00:03:21.750> that<00:03:22.050> also<00:03:22.440> makes<00:03:22.650> the

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:22.800 
clean naked hair that also makes the

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:26.360 
clean naked hair that also makes the
difference<00:03:23.130> so<00:03:23.970> I<00:03:24.000> do<00:03:24.239> recommend<00:03:24.810> this<00:03:25.620> and<00:03:26.040> it

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.370 
difference so I do recommend this and it

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:29.330 
difference so I do recommend this and it
is<00:03:27.000> one<00:03:27.360> of<00:03:27.390> the<00:03:28.050> oils<00:03:28.440> that<00:03:28.530> I<00:03:28.709> do<00:03:28.769> keep<00:03:29.160> in

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:29.340 
is one of the oils that I do keep in

00:03:29.340 --> 00:03:33.920 
is one of the oils that I do keep in
rotation<00:03:30.000> and<00:03:30.420> um<00:03:31.350> I<00:03:31.739> only<00:03:32.280> use<00:03:32.690> one<00:03:33.690> other

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:33.930 
rotation and um I only use one other

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:36.470 
rotation and um I only use one other
kind<00:03:34.290> of<00:03:34.440> or<00:03:34.650> that<00:03:34.950> I<00:03:35.010> absolutely<00:03:35.220> love<00:03:36.120> and
