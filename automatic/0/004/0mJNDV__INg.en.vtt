back<00:00:53.460> into<00:00:53.730> autonomous<00:00:54.059> mode<00:00:54.449> this<00:00:54.960> is<00:00:55.110> useful

00:00:55.220 --> 00:00:55.230 
back into autonomous mode this is useful

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.560 
back into autonomous mode this is useful
for<00:00:55.469> getting<00:00:55.710> the<00:00:55.920> robots<00:00:56.280> unstuck<00:00:56.760> in<00:00:56.940> case

00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:57.570 
for getting the robots unstuck in case

00:00:57.570 --> 00:01:00.380 
for getting the robots unstuck in case
they<00:00:57.719> get<00:00:57.840> into<00:00:58.050> a<00:00:58.079> situation<00:00:58.460> where<00:00:59.460> they<00:00:59.789> are

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:00.390 
they get into a situation where they are

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:02.389 
they get into a situation where they are
butting<00:01:00.989> into<00:01:01.109> each<00:01:01.260> other<00:01:01.440> and<00:01:01.770> are<00:01:02.070> in<00:01:02.309> a

00:01:02.389 --> 00:01:02.399 
butting into each other and are in a

00:01:02.399 --> 00:01:04.130 
butting into each other and are in a
deadlock<00:01:02.730> all<00:01:03.359> right<00:01:03.539> so<00:01:03.690> we're<00:01:03.750> going<00:01:03.899> to<00:01:03.989> do

00:01:04.130 --> 00:01:04.140 
deadlock all right so we're going to do

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.820 
deadlock all right so we're going to do
a<00:01:04.170> demonstration<00:01:04.500> of<00:01:05.100> the<00:01:05.220> autonomous<00:01:05.489> mode

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:06.830 
a demonstration of the autonomous mode

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:10.460 
a demonstration of the autonomous mode
so<00:01:07.830> here<00:01:07.979> we<00:01:08.040> go<00:01:08.070> blue<00:01:08.909> start<00:01:09.240> game<00:01:09.450> red<00:01:10.110> star

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:10.470 
so here we go blue start game red star

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.230 
so here we go blue start game red star
game<00:01:12.920> so<00:01:13.920> here<00:01:14.100> we<00:01:14.220> are<00:01:14.310> the<00:01:14.460> two<00:01:14.610> robots<00:01:14.970> are

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:15.240 
game so here we are the two robots are

00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:17.600 
game so here we are the two robots are
attempting<00:01:16.110> to<00:01:16.170> find<00:01:16.290> each<00:01:16.409> other<00:01:16.530> once<00:01:17.430> they

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:17.610 
attempting to find each other once they

00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:20.780 
attempting to find each other once they
do<00:01:18.259> yeah<00:01:19.259> if<00:01:19.500> they<00:01:19.650> do<00:01:19.710> let's<00:01:20.310> see<00:01:20.400> here<00:01:20.580> we

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:20.790 
do yeah if they do let's see here we

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:21.920 
do yeah if they do let's see here we
might<00:01:20.939> have<00:01:20.970> to<00:01:21.119> move<00:01:21.240> them<00:01:21.420> a<00:01:21.479> little<00:01:21.509> closer

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
might have to move them a little closer

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.200 
might have to move them a little closer
I<00:01:22.320> forgot<00:01:23.040> to<00:01:23.130> point<00:01:23.250> this<00:01:23.460> out<00:01:23.610> but<00:01:23.820> there<00:01:24.030> is

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:24.210 
I forgot to point this out but there is

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.090 
I forgot to point this out but there is
an<00:01:24.420> ultrasound<00:01:24.960> sensor<00:01:25.350> on<00:01:25.590> the<00:01:25.770> front<00:01:26.040> of

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100 
an ultrasound sensor on the front of

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.580 
an ultrasound sensor on the front of
each<00:01:26.220> robot<00:01:26.520> it's<00:01:27.420> that<00:01:27.659> thing<00:01:27.840> that<00:01:28.080> with<00:01:28.439> the

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590 
each robot it's that thing that with the

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:31.010 
each robot it's that thing that with the
two<00:01:28.799> circles<00:01:29.460> and<00:01:29.700> what<00:01:30.479> the<00:01:30.600> ultrasound

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
two circles and what the ultrasound

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.440 
two circles and what the ultrasound
sensor<00:01:31.320> does<00:01:31.530> is<00:01:31.799> that<00:01:32.220> it<00:01:32.579> sends<00:01:33.180> an

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:33.450 
sensor does is that it sends an

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:35.539 
sensor does is that it sends an
ultrasound<00:01:33.869> signal<00:01:34.290> out<00:01:34.530> which<00:01:34.920> bounces<00:01:35.490> a

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549 
ultrasound signal out which bounces a

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:37.880 
ultrasound signal out which bounces a
sound<00:01:35.909> wave<00:01:36.060> off<00:01:36.329> and<00:01:36.630> if<00:01:37.320> it<00:01:37.439> detects<00:01:37.740> the

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:37.890 
sound wave off and if it detects the

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:41.270 
sound wave off and if it detects the
other<00:01:38.040> robot<00:01:38.460> it<00:01:38.820> will<00:01:39.720> charge<00:01:39.990> towards<00:01:40.439> it<00:01:40.590> by

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:41.280 
other robot it will charge towards it by

00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:57.730 
okay so here we go there are two robots

00:01:57.730 --> 00:01:59.370 
okay so here we go there are two robots
are<00:01:57.880> attempting<00:01:58.270> to<00:01:58.540> find<00:01:58.840> each<00:01:58.960> other<00:01:59.080> and

00:01:59.370 --> 00:01:59.380

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:11.890 
knock the balls off so that the robots

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:13.680 
knock the balls off so that the robots
get<00:02:12.160> too<00:02:12.340> close<00:02:12.490> to<00:02:12.790> the<00:02:12.880> other<00:02:13.030> robots<00:02:13.420> they

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:13.690 
get too close to the other robots they

00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:16.220 
get too close to the other robots they
will<00:02:13.870> attempt<00:02:14.170> to<00:02:14.230> back<00:02:14.500> off<00:02:14.710> oh<00:02:14.980> there<00:02:15.430> we<00:02:15.490> go

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:16.230 
will attempt to back off oh there we go

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:20.900 
will attempt to back off oh there we go
so<00:02:17.230> one<00:02:17.410> of<00:02:17.440> the<00:02:17.620> robots<00:02:17.950> knock<00:02:18.340> the<00:02:18.490> ball<00:02:18.640> off

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:20.910 

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:32.490 

what<00:02:21.910> one<00:02:22.030> more<00:02:22.150> time<00:02:24.720> okay<00:02:30.209> okay<00:02:31.209> so<00:02:31.500> because

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:32.500 
what one more time okay okay so because

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:33.900 
what one more time okay okay so because
the<00:02:32.620> two<00:02:32.770> robots<00:02:33.100> cannot<00:02:33.310> communicate<00:02:33.610> with

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:33.910 
the two robots cannot communicate with

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:35.520 
the two robots cannot communicate with
each<00:02:34.030> other<00:02:34.239> we<00:02:34.570> have<00:02:34.600> to<00:02:34.840> explicitly<00:02:35.200> tell

00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:35.530 
each other we have to explicitly tell

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:37.949 
each other we have to explicitly tell
them<00:02:35.860> that<00:02:36.130> one<00:02:36.520> of<00:02:36.640> them<00:02:36.790> won<00:02:37.209> or<00:02:37.570> not<00:02:37.600> in

00:02:37.949 --> 00:02:37.959 
them that one of them won or not in

00:02:37.959 --> 00:02:40.020 
them that one of them won or not in
order<00:02:38.170> for<00:02:38.290> the<00:02:38.380> robots<00:02:38.709> to<00:02:38.920> stop<00:02:39.190> the<00:02:39.760> reason

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:40.030 
order for the robots to stop the reason

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:41.310 
order for the robots to stop the reason
for<00:02:40.180> this<00:02:40.239> is<00:02:40.420> because<00:02:40.450> we're<00:02:40.840> running<00:02:40.959> the

00:02:41.310 --> 00:02:41.320 
for this is because we're running the

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:43.890 
for this is because we're running the
vpl<00:02:41.709> program<00:02:42.100> on<00:02:42.280> two<00:02:42.910> different<00:02:43.120> laptops<00:02:43.630> and

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:43.900 
vpl program on two different laptops and

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:46.170 
vpl program on two different laptops and
in<00:02:44.650> order<00:02:44.920> to<00:02:45.100> have<00:02:45.520> them<00:02:45.730> communicate

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:46.180 
in order to have them communicate

00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:47.580 
in order to have them communicate
between<00:02:46.300> each<00:02:46.570> other<00:02:46.720> we<00:02:47.020> have<00:02:47.200> to<00:02:47.320> figure<00:02:47.500> out

00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:47.590 
between each other we have to figure out

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:49.800 
between each other we have to figure out
how<00:02:47.739> to<00:02:47.800> manipulate<00:02:48.670> the<00:02:48.970> bluetooth<00:02:49.300> stack<00:02:49.510> or

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:49.810 
how to manipulate the bluetooth stack or

00:02:49.810 --> 00:02:52.680 
how to manipulate the bluetooth stack or
what<00:02:50.709> have<00:02:50.890> you<00:02:50.920> so<00:02:51.880> we<00:02:51.970> decided<00:02:52.239> to<00:02:52.360> simplify

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:52.690 
what have you so we decided to simplify

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:54.060 
what have you so we decided to simplify
the<00:02:52.840> process<00:02:53.050> and<00:02:53.350> just<00:02:53.500> tell<00:02:53.650> the<00:02:53.739> robots

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:54.070 
the process and just tell the robots

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:56.490 
the process and just tell the robots
when<00:02:54.310> they<00:02:54.459> have<00:02:54.640> one<00:02:54.940> so<00:02:55.780> after<00:02:55.930> one<00:02:56.260> or<00:02:56.380> the

00:02:56.490 --> 00:02:56.500 
when they have one so after one or the

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:58.860 
when they have one so after one or the
robots<00:02:56.770> has<00:02:56.920> one<00:02:57.130> we<00:02:57.400> can<00:02:57.640> as<00:02:58.390> you<00:02:58.660> can<00:02:58.810> tell

00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:58.870 
robots has one we can as you can tell

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:02.100 
robots has one we can as you can tell
the<00:02:59.860> lights<00:03:00.160> on<00:03:00.370> that<00:03:00.730> one<00:03:01.000> is<00:03:01.030> still<00:03:01.450> on<00:03:01.630> what

the lights on that one is still on what
the<00:03:02.200> light<00:03:02.410> on<00:03:02.560> this<00:03:02.769> one<00:03:03.040> is<00:03:03.220> off<00:03:03.519> indicating

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:04.120 
the light on this one is off indicating

00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:06.330 
the light on this one is off indicating
that<00:03:04.330> this<00:03:04.480> is<00:03:04.660> the<00:03:04.750> robot<00:03:04.900> that<00:03:05.170> lost<00:03:05.440> so<00:03:06.160> what

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:06.340 
that this is the robot that lost so what

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:08.130 
that this is the robot that lost so what
we<00:03:06.459> do<00:03:06.640> is<00:03:06.670> we<00:03:07.090> tell<00:03:07.239> the<00:03:07.330> robot<00:03:07.480> to<00:03:07.660> reset

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:08.140 
we do is we tell the robot to reset

00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:11.190 
we do is we tell the robot to reset
itself<00:03:08.470> in<00:03:08.769> order<00:03:09.250> to<00:03:09.400> start<00:03:09.670> a<00:03:09.790> new<00:03:09.910> game<00:03:10.200> blue

00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:21.840 
go back blue stop moving blue turn left
blue<00:04:18.400> turn<00:04:18.640> right<00:04:19.530> and<00:04:20.530> as<00:04:21.400> you<00:04:21.489> can<00:04:21.610> see<00:04:21.640> the

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:21.850 
blue turn right and as you can see the

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:25.070 
blue turn right and as you can see the
robot<00:04:21.970> obeys<00:04:22.360> my<00:04:22.510> commands<00:04:22.810> blue<00:04:23.200> stop<00:04:23.470> moving

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080 
robot obeys my commands blue stop moving

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.510 
robot obeys my commands blue stop moving
alright<00:04:26.080> so<00:04:26.650> the<00:04:26.740> last<00:04:26.860> mode<00:04:27.100> we're<00:04:27.280> going<00:04:27.430> to

00:04:27.510 --> 00:04:27.520 
alright so the last mode we're going to

00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:33.480 
alright so the last mode we're going to
try<00:04:27.730> is<00:04:27.970> um<00:04:28.780> is<00:04:31.260> assisted<00:04:32.260> autonomous<00:04:32.800> and<00:04:33.010> as

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:33.490 
try is um is assisted autonomous and as

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:35.340 
try is um is assisted autonomous and as
you'll<00:04:33.670> see<00:04:33.970> we<00:04:34.240> can<00:04:34.390> give<00:04:34.540> it<00:04:34.570> a<00:04:34.690> command

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:35.350 
you'll see we can give it a command

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:37.170 
you'll see we can give it a command
which<00:04:35.800> the<00:04:36.010> robot<00:04:36.280> will<00:04:36.400> perform<00:04:36.790> for<00:04:37.000> about<00:04:37.150> a

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:37.180 
which the robot will perform for about a

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:43.700 
which the robot will perform for about a
second<00:04:37.570> Lou<00:04:38.110> stop<00:04:38.290> moving<00:04:40.110> blue<00:04:41.110> reset<00:04:41.470> game

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:43.710 

00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:45.960 

so<00:04:44.710> the<00:04:44.830> robots<00:04:45.130> will<00:04:45.250> perform<00:04:45.580> a<00:04:45.640> command

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:45.970 
so the robots will perform a command

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:48.300 
so the robots will perform a command
that<00:04:46.290> we<00:04:47.290> give<00:04:47.470> it<00:04:47.590> for<00:04:47.770> about<00:04:47.860> a<00:04:47.950> second

00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:48.310 
that we give it for about a second

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:49.740 
that we give it for about a second
before<00:04:48.430> it<00:04:48.640> goes<00:04:48.700> back<00:04:48.940> into<00:04:49.120> autonomous<00:04:49.390> mode

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:49.750 
before it goes back into autonomous mode

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:52.170 
before it goes back into autonomous mode
so<00:04:50.200> let's<00:04:50.380> get<00:04:50.500> better<00:04:50.680> try<00:04:50.890> blue<00:04:51.700> start<00:04:52.000> game

00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:52.180 
so let's get better try blue start game

00:04:52.180 --> 00:05:02.180 
so let's get better try blue start game
right<00:04:53.700> blue<00:04:54.700> go<00:04:54.880> back<00:04:55.090> Oh<00:04:59.190> blue<00:05:00.190> go<00:05:00.370> forward

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:02.190 
right blue go back Oh blue go forward

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:05.540 
right blue go back Oh blue go forward
blue<00:05:03.190> start<00:05:03.520> game

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:05.550 
blue start game

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:10.890 
blue start game
turn<00:05:06.550> right<00:05:09.180> so<00:05:10.180> as<00:05:10.270> you<00:05:10.330> can<00:05:10.419> see<00:05:10.570> it<00:05:10.690> turned

00:05:10.890 --> 00:05:10.900 
turn right so as you can see it turned

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:12.060 
turn right so as you can see it turned
right<00:05:11.080> slightly<00:05:11.470> and<00:05:11.620> now<00:05:11.710> it's<00:05:11.860> going<00:05:11.980> back

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:12.070 
right slightly and now it's going back

00:05:12.070 --> 00:05:25.530 
right slightly and now it's going back
to<00:05:12.370> left<00:05:13.919> Lou<00:05:14.919> turn<00:05:15.190> right<00:05:21.720> blue<00:05:22.720> go<00:05:22.870> back<00:05:24.540> we

00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:25.540 
to left Lou turn right blue go back we

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:32.940 
to left Lou turn right blue go back we
will<00:05:25.660> go<00:05:25.750> back<00:05:25.960> oh<00:05:27.450> there<00:05:28.450> we<00:05:28.570> go<00:05:31.800> all<00:05:32.800> right

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:32.950 
will go back oh there we go all right

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:36.419 
will go back oh there we go all right
and<00:05:33.130> that<00:05:33.610> is<00:05:33.790> our<00:05:33.940> project
