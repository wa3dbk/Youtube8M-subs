00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.009
 You probably already know that a rainbow does not consist of seven colors. Isaac Newton 

00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:09.559
 chose seven colors because it was mystical, it related to seven musical notes, and 

00:00:09.559 --> 00:00:13.269
 the seven days he thought god needed to make the earth. 

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:18.150
 You probably already know that colors overlap. In contrast to this projection 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.870
 there is no pure red or pure orange. You see all wavelengths in a real rainbow 

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:24.810
 who are in between 

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:30.289
 But what you may not have known is that a rainbow does not disappear after red and violet. The 

00:00:30.289 --> 00:00:34.920
 Electromagnetic wavelength goes a little bit in the invisible parts of it 

00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:40.340
 spectrum. Not very far: water absorbs infrared and ultraviolet. But you can see 

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:44.989
 in what is an absorption spectrum that will let liquid water through - and therefore 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:49.470
 to a rainbow - wavelengths just outside the frequency that we can see. 

00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:54.780
 If you take a photo with a camera with UV-sensitive foil, you can still see a fierce bar below 

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.890
 see violet. And there are people who don't wear lenses. They can 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:04.489
 still see, with strong glasses on, but the filtering of UV light that the lens does is gone. 

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:09.070
 So they can also see that extra bar. A little further, in the National Gallery, are paintings 

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:14.000
 by Claude Monet, who underwent an operation late in his life that took the lens off his eye 

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.270
 therefore there is a fierce discussion that his paintings were fiercer and bluer thereafter, 

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.970
 the result of the almost UV light that he could see at the time. 

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:27.479
 There is one more question: why does water only let the light through 

00:01:27.479 --> 00:01:32.650
 that we can see? If it were something else, water would be cloudy for us, maybe we are constantly hit 

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:36.299
 by bright UV light, and then life would be very different. The answer 

00:01:36.299 --> 00:01:42.610
 is of course that it is no coincidence: for hundreds of millions of years, our predecessors 

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:47.500
 those possibilities evolved. Our forces ensure that water is transparent with some 

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:52.549
 wavelengths, so that we can see those waves is a big advantage in life. The species 

00:01:52.549 --> 00:01:57.840
 from which we descended would have been much more likely to survive if they could see those waves. 

00:01:57.840 --> 00:02:02.159
 Imagine that you cannot see through rain. Those who cannot see those wavelengths 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:08.360
 will die sooner. Repeat that for a whole lot of generations and here 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.120
 we are: we create our own rainbows.
