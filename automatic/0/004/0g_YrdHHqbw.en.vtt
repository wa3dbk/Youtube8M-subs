00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:08.280
 that I send is because Jose took shortcuts 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.350

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.000

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.860
 Why do you come here when I go? 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:15.869
 tuit and you may have the chance to activate 

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:18.180
 her and be an activator hence the 

00:01:15.869 --> 00:01:20.970
 Third step is to enjoy my 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:22.770
 facebook page is facebook.com 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:24.780
 quite well 

00:01:22.770 --> 00:01:27.119
 Do you like the page there? I 'm going too. 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:28.860
 I am betting the wanted back then 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:30.420
 if you want to receive little by little also 

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:34.530
 You can enjoy my facebook page. 

00:01:30.420 --> 00:01:36.960
 there I'm going to like it I said 4 easy right 

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:38.579
 the fourth step is because I love you if 

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.650
 You love me, you can put 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:43.380
 back then is this guys and involves a 

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:46.560
 Very cool game made by both locke 

00:01:43.380 --> 00:01:48.840
 in coae and distributed by tim cook 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:51.659
 It is a very very good game, very much 

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:55.799
 time it is alpha alpha started the day 

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:59.340
 30 on the 30th or 31st day 31st started for you 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:02:01.229
 and day 31 on xbox 31 began to win 

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:03.180
 and ends on day 2 

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:05.729
 so it will last very little and not 

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:07.350
 only two days and today is the 1st day 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:07.970
 I received the others that you have. 

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:10.490
 very little 

00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:11.720
 time to activate your 15 then I go 

00:02:10.490 --> 00:02:13.580
 try to get back to them the fastest 

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:15.590
 possible so that you can activate 

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:17.660
 them as you can because 

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:19.100
 in the delay to install and such and such you 

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:21.950
 can at least play a little bit 

00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:23.750
 of alpha returns is very cool guys 

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:26.390
 so it's a game that will launch only in 

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:28.790
 February next year and they came back 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.560
 to the now that it is very much the same way and 

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:32.660
 I advise you to play in what is very 

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:34.220
 fun are the creators of the eletronet 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:36.610
 then the resources of fundeb you go 

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:40.400
 enjoy this game for sure because it is 

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:42.140
 very good people, why are you going? 

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.430
 like drawn 15 then you will have 

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:45.170
 the opportunity to play 

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:47.480
 Who can not get here, I'm sorry. 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:49.190
 more freak network guys are 10 15 all 

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.020
 The world that you are going to try is much more than 

00:02:49.190 --> 00:02:53.959
 ten people try if you can not 

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:55.280

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:59.900
