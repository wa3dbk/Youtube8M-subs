00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:02.750 

now<00:00:01.260> I've<00:00:01.680> cut<00:00:02.070> off<00:00:02.220> the<00:00:02.399> end<00:00:02.580> of<00:00:02.700> the

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:02.760 
now I've cut off the end of the

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.360 
now I've cut off the end of the
fretboard<00:00:02.939> and<00:00:03.500> it<00:00:04.500> is<00:00:04.620> now<00:00:04.770> the<00:00:04.830> right<00:00:05.069> length

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:05.370 
fretboard and it is now the right length

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.410 
fretboard and it is now the right length
and<00:00:06.170> I've<00:00:07.170> also<00:00:07.290> done<00:00:07.440> a<00:00:07.560> little<00:00:07.740> bit<00:00:07.919> of

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:08.420 
and I've also done a little bit of

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:10.490 
and I've also done a little bit of
gnawing<00:00:09.420> away<00:00:09.540> at<00:00:09.719> the<00:00:09.900> end<00:00:10.050> where<00:00:10.290> it<00:00:10.349> goes

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:10.500 
gnawing away at the end where it goes

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:16.820 
gnawing away at the end where it goes
underneath<00:00:10.830> the<00:00:11.210> neck<00:00:12.210> pick<00:00:12.509> up<00:00:14.330> evany<00:00:15.830> tends

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:16.830 
underneath the neck pick up evany tends

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.650 
underneath the neck pick up evany tends
to<00:00:17.039> shrink<00:00:17.750> across<00:00:18.750> its<00:00:18.960> width<00:00:20.180> it's<00:00:21.180> just<00:00:21.539> one

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:21.660 
to shrink across its width it's just one

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:24.679 
to shrink across its width it's just one
of<00:00:21.750> those<00:00:21.869> things<00:00:22.410> with<00:00:22.680> well<00:00:23.490> all<00:00:24.150> wood<00:00:24.480> does

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:24.689 
of those things with well all wood does

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.000 
of those things with well all wood does
this<00:00:24.840> but<00:00:24.990> even<00:00:25.230> he<00:00:25.289> seems<00:00:25.500> to<00:00:25.619> do<00:00:25.710> it<00:00:25.830> worse

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:26.010 
this but even he seems to do it worse

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.599 
this but even he seems to do it worse
than<00:00:26.250> most<00:00:26.430> and<00:00:26.730> as<00:00:27.630> a<00:00:27.689> result<00:00:28.019> of<00:00:28.170> that<00:00:28.349> I<00:00:28.609> tend

00:00:29.599 --> 00:00:29.609 
than most and as a result of that I tend

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:35.450 
than most and as a result of that I tend
to<00:00:29.789> prefer<00:00:29.970> to<00:00:30.840> bind<00:00:31.800> it<00:00:32.160> I<00:00:34.070> really<00:00:35.070> like<00:00:35.250> the

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:35.460 
to prefer to bind it I really like the

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.240 
to prefer to bind it I really like the
look<00:00:35.700> of<00:00:35.969> a<00:00:36.770> perfectly<00:00:37.770> black<00:00:38.040> ebony

00:00:38.240 --> 00:00:38.250

fretboard with some perfectly black
binding<00:00:41.550> it's<00:00:42.890> not<00:00:43.890> obvious<00:00:44.399> and<00:00:45.170> sometimes

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:46.170 
binding it's not obvious and sometimes

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.170 
binding it's not obvious and sometimes
they're<00:00:46.620> not<00:00:46.770> obvious<00:00:47.190> is<00:00:47.430> much<00:00:48.000> more

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 
they're not obvious is much more

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:50.900 
they're not obvious is much more
prettier<00:00:48.390> than<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:49.160> garish<00:00:50.160> mother-of-pearl

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:50.910 
prettier than the garish mother-of-pearl

I<00:00:56.070> do<00:00:56.219> any<00:00:56.489> radius<00:00:56.910> thing<00:00:57.120> I'm<00:00:57.300> going<00:00:57.539> to<00:00:57.690> use<00:00:57.870> a

00:00:57.889 --> 00:00:57.899 
I do any radius thing I'm going to use a

00:00:57.899 --> 00:01:02.860 
I do any radius thing I'm going to use a
router<00:00:58.199> and<00:00:58.670> create<00:00:59.670> a<00:00:59.760> binding<00:01:00.059> channel<00:01:00.329> and

00:01:02.860 --> 00:01:02.870 
router and create a binding channel and

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:11.120 
router and create a binding channel and
now<00:01:03.870> we<00:01:03.930> go<00:01:04.170> search<00:01:04.379> for<00:01:04.409> the<00:01:04.650> router<00:01:09.950> lots<00:01:10.950> of

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:11.130 
now we go search for the router lots of

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:28.500 
now we go search for the router lots of
rats

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:28.510 

00:01:28.510 --> 00:01:31.450 

the<00:01:29.510> neck<00:01:29.690> is<00:01:29.720> nice<00:01:29.990> and<00:01:30.050> stable<00:01:30.650> in<00:01:31.130> between

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:31.460 
the neck is nice and stable in between

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:35.050 
the neck is nice and stable in between
the<00:01:31.550> dogs<00:01:31.820> on<00:01:32.270> my<00:01:32.510> bench<00:01:32.720> and<00:01:33.610> I've<00:01:34.610> set<00:01:34.910> the

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:35.060 
the dogs on my bench and I've set the

00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.360 
the dogs on my bench and I've set the
depth<00:01:35.300> of<00:01:35.480> the<00:01:35.570> router<00:01:35.780> cutter<00:01:36.110> so<00:01:37.070> that<00:01:37.160> only

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:37.370 
depth of the router cutter so that only

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:38.560 
depth of the router cutter so that only
takes<00:01:37.670> off<00:01:37.820> the<00:01:37.970> fretboard

00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:38.570 
takes off the fretboard

00:01:38.570 --> 00:02:25.860 
takes off the fretboard
it's<00:01:39.500> makes<00:01:39.710> a<00:01:39.800> noise

00:02:25.860 --> 00:02:25.870 

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:31.030 

now<00:02:27.880> I've<00:02:28.880> obviously<00:02:29.270> put<00:02:29.480> this<00:02:29.720> in<00:02:30.560> the<00:02:30.800> dogs

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
now I've obviously put this in the dogs

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:34.900 
now I've obviously put this in the dogs
of<00:02:31.940> my<00:02:31.970> bench<00:02:32.330> and<00:02:33.220> that<00:02:34.220> is<00:02:34.520> all<00:02:34.700> well<00:02:34.880> and

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:34.910 
of my bench and that is all well and

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:35.560 
of my bench and that is all well and
good

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:35.570 
good

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:37.810 
good
I<00:02:35.600> need<00:02:36.200> something<00:02:36.530> to<00:02:36.590> push<00:02:36.770> against<00:02:37.220> the

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:37.820 
I need something to push against the

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:40.060 
I need something to push against the
problem<00:02:38.480> is<00:02:38.780> that<00:02:38.960> if<00:02:39.050> I<00:02:39.170> tighten<00:02:39.410> that<00:02:39.650> up<00:02:39.710> too

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:40.070 
problem is that if I tighten that up too

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:41.560 
problem is that if I tighten that up too
much<00:02:40.250> I<00:02:40.550> will<00:02:40.820> make<00:02:40.970> the<00:02:41.120> neck

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:41.570 
much I will make the neck

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:43.660 
much I will make the neck
well<00:02:42.230> I'll<00:02:42.440> distort<00:02:42.920> the<00:02:43.100> neck<00:02:43.250> and<00:02:43.430> I<00:02:43.460> won't

00:02:43.660 --> 00:02:43.670 
well I'll distort the neck and I won't

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:45.660 
well I'll distort the neck and I won't
end<00:02:43.880> up<00:02:43.940> with<00:02:44.000> a<00:02:44.120> perfectly<00:02:44.540> flat<00:02:44.660> fretboard

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:45.670 
end up with a perfectly flat fretboard

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:50.650 
end up with a perfectly flat fretboard
I've<00:02:46.670> got<00:02:46.880> a<00:02:46.910> block<00:02:47.660> of<00:02:48.940> neck<00:02:49.940> there<00:02:50.360> that<00:02:50.570> I'm

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:50.660 
I've got a block of neck there that I'm

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:54.220 
I've got a block of neck there that I'm
gonna<00:02:50.750> put<00:02:50.960> underneath<00:02:51.820> a<00:02:52.820> block<00:02:53.510> of<00:02:53.660> neck<00:02:53.840> it

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:54.230 
gonna put underneath a block of neck it

00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:58.290 
gonna put underneath a block of neck it
is<00:02:54.260> a<00:02:54.740> block<00:02:55.100> leftover<00:02:55.730> from<00:02:56.000> a<00:02:56.270> neck<00:02:56.660> blank

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:58.300 
is a block leftover from a neck blank

00:02:58.300 --> 00:03:00.700 
is a block leftover from a neck blank
and<00:02:59.300> that<00:02:59.510> supports<00:02:59.960> the<00:03:00.110> central<00:03:00.470> section

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:00.710 
and that supports the central section

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:08.830 
and that supports the central section
now<00:03:01.150> and<00:03:02.150> it<00:03:02.900> is<00:03:04.150> nicely<00:03:05.680> seated<00:03:07.720> there<00:03:08.720> will

00:03:08.830 --> 00:03:08.840 
now and it is nicely seated there will

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.570 
now and it is nicely seated there will
be<00:03:08.870> some<00:03:09.170> movement<00:03:09.410> but<00:03:09.710> this<00:03:09.860> is<00:03:09.980> likely

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:10.580 
be some movement but this is likely

00:03:10.580 --> 00:03:14.520 
be some movement but this is likely
seated<00:03:11.210> but<00:03:11.750> that's<00:03:12.170> not<00:03:12.350> a<00:03:12.380> problem

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:14.530 
seated but that's not a problem

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:23.020 
seated but that's not a problem
now<00:03:15.530> I<00:03:15.560> put<00:03:16.040> my<00:03:17.950> radius<00:03:18.950> on<00:03:19.520> with<00:03:20.240> a<00:03:20.270> plank<00:03:22.030> cut

00:03:23.020 --> 00:03:23.030 
now I put my radius on with a plank cut

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:48.910 
now I put my radius on with a plank cut
an<00:03:23.240> angle

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:48.920 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:53.600 

and<00:03:50.120> slowly<00:03:51.650> I'm<00:03:52.650> going<00:03:52.830> to<00:03:52.980> round<00:03:53.130> it<00:03:53.310> over

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:53.610 
and slowly I'm going to round it over

00:03:53.610 --> 00:04:00.590 
and slowly I'm going to round it over
until<00:03:53.850> I've<00:03:54.000> got<00:03:54.920> the<00:03:55.920> the<00:03:58.670> radius<00:03:59.670> that<00:04:00.570> I

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:00.600 
until I've got the the radius that I

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:08.030 
until I've got the the radius that I
require<00:04:04.040> having<00:04:05.040> roughed<00:04:05.610> out<00:04:05.940> and<00:04:07.040> thickness

00:04:08.030 --> 00:04:08.040 
require having roughed out and thickness

00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:13.970 
require having roughed out and thickness
the<00:04:08.850> fretboard<00:04:09.090> down<00:04:09.780> into<00:04:10.580> pretty<00:04:11.580> much<00:04:12.980> the

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:13.980 
the fretboard down into pretty much the

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:17.530 
the fretboard down into pretty much the
basic<00:04:14.460> place<00:04:15.420> it<00:04:15.600> needs<00:04:15.750> to<00:04:15.900> be<00:04:16.020> at<00:04:16.170> I<00:04:16.520> will

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:17.540 
basic place it needs to be at I will

00:04:17.540 --> 00:04:25.070 
basic place it needs to be at I will
move<00:04:18.540> it<00:04:18.660> into<00:04:18.840> this<00:04:19.080> vise<00:04:19.799> and<00:04:23.780> the<00:04:24.780> reason

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080 
move it into this vise and the reason

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.800 
move it into this vise and the reason
for<00:04:25.110> that<00:04:25.260> is<00:04:25.560> it's<00:04:25.770> sideways<00:04:25.980> pressure<00:04:26.810> I'm

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:27.810 
for that is it's sideways pressure I'm

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:32.270 
for that is it's sideways pressure I'm
not<00:04:28.790> going<00:04:29.790> to<00:04:29.880> be<00:04:29.970> putting<00:04:30.300> pressure<00:04:30.450> on<00:04:31.280> in

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:32.280 
not going to be putting pressure on in

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:35.540 
not going to be putting pressure on in
the<00:04:32.400> middle<00:04:32.670> and<00:04:32.930> thus<00:04:33.930> creating<00:04:34.740> what<00:04:35.310> might

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:35.550 
the middle and thus creating what might

00:04:35.550 --> 00:04:39.800 
the middle and thus creating what might
be<00:04:35.760> a<00:04:35.790> non<00:04:36.000> flat<00:04:36.360> fretboard<00:04:38.300> it<00:04:39.300> is<00:04:39.450> still

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:39.810 
be a non flat fretboard it is still

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:43.060 
be a non flat fretboard it is still
slightly<00:04:41.000> thicker<00:04:42.000> here<00:04:42.420> than<00:04:42.600> it<00:04:42.660> is<00:04:42.780> then

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:43.070 
slightly thicker here than it is then

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:50.660 
slightly thicker here than it is then
and<00:04:44.070> I<00:04:44.840> have<00:04:45.840> more<00:04:46.020> work<00:04:46.170> to<00:04:46.200> do<00:04:49.670> your

very<00:05:08.640> briefly<00:05:09.620> you've<00:05:10.620> got<00:05:10.890> two<00:05:11.340> options<00:05:11.730> when

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:12.690 
very briefly you've got two options when

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:14.720 
very briefly you've got two options when

behind<00:05:59.340> it<00:05:59.610> are<00:05:59.900> if<00:06:00.900> you've<00:06:01.110> got<00:06:01.260> a<00:06:01.290> plane<00:06:01.590> you

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:02.550 
behind it are if you've got a plane you

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:07.700 
behind it are if you've got a plane you
are<00:06:02.580> taking<00:06:03.330> a<00:06:03.540> small<00:06:04.910> shaving<00:06:05.910> off<00:06:06.060> and<00:06:06.710> where

are taking a small shaving off and where
you<00:06:08.010> point<00:06:08.760> your<00:06:08.880> plane<00:06:09.530> will<00:06:10.530> determine<00:06:11.400> the

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:11.790 
you point your plane will determine the

00:06:11.790 --> 00:06:14.840 
you point your plane will determine the
radius<00:06:11.940> as<00:06:12.270> you<00:06:12.390> get<00:06:12.570> if<00:06:13.140> you<00:06:13.710> want<00:06:13.950> to<00:06:14.310> have<00:06:14.550> an

let<00:06:20.250> us<00:06:20.370> first<00:06:20.580> have<00:06:20.700> our<00:06:21.030> center<00:06:21.420> line<00:06:22.310> so

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:24.740 
let us first have our center line so

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:29.690 
let us first have our center line so
there's<00:06:25.740> your<00:06:25.890> Center<00:06:26.870> if<00:06:27.870> you<00:06:28.170> want<00:06:28.440> an<00:06:28.710> even

00:06:29.690 --> 00:06:29.700 
there's your Center if you want an even

there's your Center if you want an even
radius<00:06:31.580> you<00:06:32.580> plane<00:06:33.240> parallel<00:06:34.140> to<00:06:34.410> the

00:06:35.120 --> 00:06:35.130 
radius you plane parallel to the

radius you plane parallel to the
centerline<00:06:35.750> and<00:06:37.430> that<00:06:38.430> will<00:06:38.580> give<00:06:38.790> you

00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:39.080 
centerline and that will give you

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:42.080 
centerline and that will give you
whatever<00:06:40.080> your<00:06:40.410> radius<00:06:40.710> happens<00:06:41.040> to<00:06:41.190> be<00:06:41.340> so<00:06:41.940> if

00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:42.090 
whatever your radius happens to be so if

00:06:42.090 --> 00:06:45.620 
whatever your radius happens to be so if
you<00:06:42.270> were<00:06:42.390> using<00:06:42.600> your<00:06:42.750> radius<00:06:43.560> cages<00:06:44.630> there

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:45.630 
you were using your radius cages there

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:48.880 
you were using your radius cages there
to<00:06:45.750> see<00:06:46.340> this<00:06:47.340> is<00:06:47.550> probably<00:06:47.910> somewhere<00:06:48.270> around

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:48.890 
to see this is probably somewhere around

00:06:48.890 --> 00:06:52.430 
to see this is probably somewhere around
there<00:06:49.890> you<00:06:49.950> go<00:06:50.070> that's<00:06:50.280> 20<00:06:50.900> if<00:06:51.900> I<00:06:52.020> was<00:06:52.140> to<00:06:52.260> plane

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:52.440 
there you go that's 20 if I was to plane

00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:55.130 
there you go that's 20 if I was to plane
in<00:06:52.620> a<00:06:52.680> straight<00:06:52.950> line<00:06:52.980> a<00:06:53.190> lot<00:06:53.630> alongside<00:06:54.630> the

in a straight line a lot alongside the
center<00:06:55.440> line<00:06:55.620> I<00:06:55.860> would<00:06:56.340> end<00:06:56.490> up<00:06:56.580> with<00:06:56.700> the<00:06:56.790> 20

you<00:07:03.270> plane<00:07:03.770> straight<00:07:04.770> down<00:07:04.950> the<00:07:05.070> center<00:07:05.220> and

00:07:05.890 --> 00:07:05.900 
you plane straight down the center and

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:11.530 
you plane straight down the center and
then<00:07:07.729> add<00:07:08.729> an<00:07:09.450> angle<00:07:09.840> to<00:07:10.560> the<00:07:10.919> center

00:07:11.530 --> 00:07:11.540 
then add an angle to the center

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:13.360 
then add an angle to the center
following

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:13.370 
following

00:07:13.370 --> 00:07:15.580 
following
the<00:07:13.490> angle<00:07:13.730> of<00:07:13.790> the<00:07:13.880> fretboard<00:07:14.090> so<00:07:14.510> for<00:07:15.050> it<00:07:15.110> so

00:07:15.580 --> 00:07:15.590 
the angle of the fretboard so for it so

00:07:15.590 --> 00:07:18.010 
the angle of the fretboard so for it so
effectively<00:07:16.310> the<00:07:17.000> easiest<00:07:17.210> way<00:07:17.389> to<00:07:17.419> say<00:07:17.660> it<00:07:17.720> is

00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:18.020 
effectively the easiest way to say it is

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:23.080 
effectively the easiest way to say it is
follow<00:07:18.500> the<00:07:18.860> strings<00:07:21.729> so<00:07:22.729> instead<00:07:23.030> of

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:23.090 
follow the strings so instead of

00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:27.070 
follow the strings so instead of
shooting<00:07:23.990> off<00:07:24.199> the<00:07:24.949> edge<00:07:25.180> in<00:07:26.180> a<00:07:26.600> straight<00:07:26.870> line

00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:27.080 
shooting off the edge in a straight line

00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:29.980 
shooting off the edge in a straight line
along<00:07:27.260> the<00:07:27.530> center<00:07:27.830> line<00:07:27.860> you<00:07:28.220> are<00:07:29.030> moving

00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:29.990 
along the center line you are moving

00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:32.920 
along the center line you are moving
along<00:07:31.000> where<00:07:32.000> the<00:07:32.090> string<00:07:32.330> would<00:07:32.449> sit<00:07:32.720> and

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:32.930 
along where the string would sit and

00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:37.320 
along where the string would sit and
that<00:07:33.800> will<00:07:34.370> give<00:07:34.610> you<00:07:34.850> a<00:07:35.060> compound<00:07:35.720> radius

00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:37.330 
that will give you a compound radius

00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:43.180 
that will give you a compound radius
it's<00:07:39.460> not<00:07:40.460> particularly<00:07:40.850> easy<00:07:41.180> to<00:07:41.449> do<00:07:42.190> you

00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:43.190 
it's not particularly easy to do you

00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:44.830 
it's not particularly easy to do you
have<00:07:43.370> to<00:07:43.460> have<00:07:43.580> a<00:07:43.610> well-set-up<00:07:44.120> plane<00:07:44.600> and<00:07:44.810> a

00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:44.840 
have to have a well-set-up plane and a

00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:49.690 
have to have a well-set-up plane and a
very<00:07:45.020> sharp<00:07:45.320> plane<00:07:45.620> and<00:07:46.419> it<00:07:48.190> takes<00:07:49.190> a<00:07:49.340> lot<00:07:49.490> of

00:07:49.690 --> 00:07:49.700 
very sharp plane and it takes a lot of

00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:52.180 
very sharp plane and it takes a lot of
checking<00:07:49.940> I<00:07:50.300> use<00:07:50.900> a<00:07:50.930> straightedge<00:07:51.320> constantly

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:52.190 
checking I use a straightedge constantly

00:07:52.190 --> 00:07:55.659 
checking I use a straightedge constantly
because<00:07:52.700> you<00:07:52.850> can<00:07:53.030> quite<00:07:53.600> easily<00:07:54.370> put<00:07:55.370> a<00:07:55.400> gap

00:07:55.659 --> 00:07:55.669 
because you can quite easily put a gap
