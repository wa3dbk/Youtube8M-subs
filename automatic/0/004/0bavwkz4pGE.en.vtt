I<00:02:25.610> think<00:02:26.610> the<00:02:26.700> Romans<00:02:27.030> would<00:02:27.210> have<00:02:27.240> liked<00:02:27.420> to

00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:27.450 
I think the Romans would have liked to

00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:28.940 
I think the Romans would have liked to
have<00:02:27.600> thought<00:02:27.870> that<00:02:28.050> by<00:02:28.200> martyring<00:02:28.590> all<00:02:28.770> these

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:28.950 
have thought that by martyring all these

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:30.320 
have thought that by martyring all these
people<00:02:29.340> by<00:02:29.460> killing<00:02:29.520> them<00:02:30.030> that<00:02:30.210> they're

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:30.330 
people by killing them that they're

00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:31.700 
people by killing them that they're
going<00:02:30.450> to<00:02:30.540> stamp<00:02:30.810> out<00:02:31.020> the<00:02:31.170> religion<00:02:31.560> and

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:31.710 
going to stamp out the religion and

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:35.840
