 hello I'm sabine in this video 

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:09.630
 do you learn anything about the breathing of the 

00:00:06.359 --> 00:00:13.040
 people are very concerned with today 

00:00:09.630 --> 00:00:16.199
 Gas exchange in the lungs and body 

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:17.880
 so that you could understand everything well 

00:00:16.199 --> 00:00:20.609
 It's very nice if you already have that 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.470
 respiratory organs and also know something about 

00:00:20.609 --> 00:00:25.800
 the composition of our respiratory air 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:29.189
 shows at the end of this videos you know 

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:31.980
 exactly where and how the exchange 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:36.660
 between the breath gases oxygen and 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:38.640
 carbon dioxide takes place we see 

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:40.850
 First, the gas exchange in the 

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.739
 Lunge a little closer as you know 

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:46.260
 are at the end of the smallest 

00:00:43.739 --> 00:00:49.710
 montreal ramifications many small ones 

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:53.160
 These are from a very large 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:56.699
 fine mesh surrounded by the smallest blood vessels 

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:58.949
 These blood vessels are called capillaries 

00:00:56.699 --> 00:01:01.079
 you see i have the net of blues 

00:00:58.949 --> 00:01:02.160
 capillaries in two different 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:05.339
 drawn in colors 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.560
 why now the 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:11.040
 different colors are meant to be 

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:13.049
