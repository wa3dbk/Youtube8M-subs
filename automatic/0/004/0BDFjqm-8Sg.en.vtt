00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:18.810
 Welcome to the second wow 

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:20.980
 addon here on gamezone 

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:24.300
 today we have the little addon 

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:27.970
 katrina frames picked out 

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:30.610
 who is with standard as it plays 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:32.260
 a very good addition to the 

00:00:30.610 --> 00:00:34.239
 buffs stop at another location 

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:36.190
 I have interfaces to display 

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:38.230
 now with me still the lfu ii on it 

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:40.750
 that does not matter to the top I have now 

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:42.400
 Two double tips but those up here 

00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:43.300
 press ignore in the minimap because 

00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:47.170
 Just do it 

00:00:43.300 --> 00:00:50.680
 yes, the add-on is activated 

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:55.629
 about the chat with flash swf and then 

00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:58.809
 options into the actual menu then looks 

00:00:55.629 --> 00:01:01.510
 even here the buffs is synonymous 

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:03.220
 it just like the mavs can 

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:07.810
 move freely if you look at what 

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:11.560
 or holding buffs in the off button yes 

00:01:07.810 --> 00:01:13.930
 the options menu actually have one 

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:15.640
 here the choir in frame here you can the 

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:18.120
 buffs or who choose the buffs 

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:20.580
 which one would like to work on 

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:23.590
 Let's start with the box 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:26.530
 Almost everyone has them by default 

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:28.120
 anyway up here but you can get the 

00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:29.830
 stop customizing yourself that means me 

00:01:28.120 --> 00:01:32.740
 postpone the first time here would have 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:35.200
 I like you then clique then first 

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:36.330
 on the rider layout and here I have 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.620
 now various settings 

00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:40.950
 first can not show how 

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:44.020
 many things I would like to have 

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.370
 if that changes from 30 to 15 now 

00:01:44.020 --> 00:01:48.100
 Click Apply 

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:49.590
 Since then another 15 bars at times you would have 

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:52.090
 Watching as for you need 

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:56.920
 I'll just leave it on by default 

00:01:52.090 --> 00:01:58.930
 30 so then you can play bass here 

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.420
 display groove 

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:03.970
 from which side the box will be counted 

00:02:01.420 --> 00:02:06.190
 depending on how you have as an interface 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:08.340
 you want to get them from below now 

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:12.159
 Run right to left up 

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:15.569
 or from the middle or vice versa 

00:02:12.159 --> 00:02:15.569
 from bottom left to top right 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.720
 just as you can show how 

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:24.590
 many brooks should be in a row 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:26.390
 I would like to drive at complete upper 

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:31.580
 I fill in the edge with wax 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:34.430
 that on 30 boxes in a row or power 

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:36.380
 all down to the installation of one 

00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:40.220
 series has the whole then i'll take km 

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:43.610
 horizontally the whole clearly in such 

00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:47.720
 leave a small box that time 

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:51.709
 Clicking on it was a rider on 

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:53.570
 especially you can get the for example 

00:02:51.709 --> 00:02:56.920
 let the baw size show so the 

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:58.970
 alpen size I'm doing 50 now 

00:02:56.920 --> 00:03:01.700
 The buffs are natural 

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:04.910
 bigger ones overlap now of course 

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:07.370
 that means I have to go back to 

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:11.930
 layout and then looks this little 

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:13.430
 box on buffs pacing and can the 

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:15.110
 then pull apart like that when I get the 

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:17.810
 arrow key click or directly the value 

00:03:15.110 --> 00:03:21.470
 Enter the size used 

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:23.090
 Hardly anyone except 

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:26.980
 someone with a huge resolution though 

00:03:23.090 --> 00:03:31.970
 I think even at 1920 x 1080 pixels 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:33.230
 you do not need a barefoot of 50 

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:37.130
 Of course you can be smaller 

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:40.280
 make on 10 you hardly recognize what 

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:42.350
 Furthermore, you can also directly 

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:45.290
 Show counters so click 

00:03:42.350 --> 00:03:47.030
 the rider from that I end now 

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:51.500
 first in its own size 

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:54.530
 You do not recognize it when you are one 

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:58.610
 rider bars clicks and a tick at 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:04:00.470
 chf what makes you have directly in cash 

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:02.209
 then the length of the actual 

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:04.310
 show box is for example with me 

00:04:02.209 --> 00:04:07.010
 at the age which with my penguin 

00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:08.630
 Now you can see ball from slowly 

00:04:07.010 --> 00:04:11.260
 Run right to left up to 60 

00:04:08.630 --> 00:04:13.459
 minutes have passed 

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:16.669
 maybe it does not make more now 

00:04:13.459 --> 00:04:19.820
 necessarily with Bach but rather with the 

00:04:16.669 --> 00:04:23.479
 mavs how long that lasts then 

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:27.169
 got the whole set the 

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:29.770
 Most will get something out so then you can 

00:04:27.169 --> 00:04:31.699
 adjust if you click on the box 

00:04:29.770 --> 00:04:33.320
 and then you have here exactly 

00:04:31.699 --> 00:04:37.849
 the same setting options 

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:39.800
 as well as the thieves myself 

00:04:37.849 --> 00:04:43.039
 I would like to standard now 

00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:44.660
 layout under my character window 

00:04:43.039 --> 00:04:47.349
 I had everything directly clear 

00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:50.000
 which weakness effect I have just 

00:04:47.349 --> 00:04:51.910
 and could give it then if so 

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:55.030
 customize as I like 

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:59.110
 that was it from me to the small change 

00:04:55.030 --> 00:04:59.110
 we'll be back soon
