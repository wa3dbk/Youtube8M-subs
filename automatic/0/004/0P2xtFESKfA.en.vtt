sound aunty okay now you need to create
a<00:01:25.840> new<00:01:26.320> camera<00:01:27.720> camera<00:01:28.720> and<00:01:29.490> you'll<00:01:30.490> create<00:01:30.789> a

00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:30.880 
a new camera camera and you'll create a

00:01:30.880 --> 00:01:34.850 
a new camera camera and you'll create a
camera<00:01:31.149> and<00:01:31.630> go<00:01:32.440> to<00:01:32.500> pay<00:01:32.890> city<00:01:33.130> camera<00:01:33.789> one<00:01:34.060> and

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:34.860 
camera and go to pay city camera one and

00:01:34.860 --> 00:01:39.810 
camera and go to pay city camera one and
we<00:01:35.860> need<00:01:36.130> something<00:01:36.789> like<00:01:37.060> this<00:01:38.820> before

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:39.820 
we need something like this before

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:43.410 
we need something like this before
creating<00:01:40.950> thing<00:01:41.950> just<00:01:42.399> use<00:01:42.640> the<00:01:42.880> resolution

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:43.420 
creating thing just use the resolution

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:48.600 
creating thing just use the resolution
gate<00:01:43.690> so<00:01:43.960> we<00:01:44.440> can<00:01:44.800> see<00:01:45.069> what's<00:01:45.459> happening<00:01:47.610> and

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:48.610 
gate so we can see what's happening and

00:01:48.610 --> 00:01:51.510 
gate so we can see what's happening and
first<00:01:48.970> create<00:01:49.300> anything<00:01:49.690> like<00:01:50.020> this<00:01:50.259> this<00:01:51.220> I

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:51.520 
first create anything like this this I

can use like this or anything first I
create<00:01:55.090> grading<00:01:55.899> like<00:01:56.170> this<00:01:57.929> and<00:01:59.520> in<00:02:00.520> the

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:00.670 
create grading like this and in the

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:04.320 
create grading like this and in the
outliner<00:02:01.300> this<00:02:01.959> is<00:02:02.170> a<00:02:02.200> camera<00:02:03.009> and<00:02:03.340> this<00:02:04.149> is

why<00:02:53.310> meaning<00:02:53.760> that<00:02:54.120> 0<00:02:55.019> and<00:02:56.060> this<00:02:57.060> let's<00:02:57.569> be

00:02:57.890 --> 00:02:57.900 
why meaning that 0 and this let's be

00:02:57.900 --> 00:03:01.699 
why meaning that 0 and this let's be
funny<00:02:58.549> and<00:02:59.549> you<00:03:00.239> can<00:03:00.450> evil<00:03:00.870> for<00:03:01.109> collecting

00:03:01.699 --> 00:03:01.709 
funny and you can evil for collecting

00:03:01.709 --> 00:03:08.170 
funny and you can evil for collecting
and<00:03:01.889> decrease<00:03:04.639> so<00:03:05.639> we<00:03:06.389> can<00:03:06.719> have<00:03:07.109> all<00:03:07.469> these

00:03:08.170 --> 00:03:08.180 
and decrease so we can have all these

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:12.610 
and decrease so we can have all these
animation<00:03:10.250> like<00:03:11.250> this

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:12.620 
animation like this

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:19.250 
animation like this
and<00:03:13.849> this<00:03:14.849> area<00:03:15.829> we<00:03:16.829> can<00:03:17.189> have<00:03:18.510> lanky

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
and this area we can have lanky

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:28.159 
and this area we can have lanky
selected<00:03:19.859> and<00:03:21.049> at<00:03:23.599> 150<00:03:24.859> we<00:03:25.859> can<00:03:26.219> in<00:03:26.870> more<00:03:27.870> so

00:03:28.159 --> 00:03:28.169 
selected and at 150 we can in more so

00:03:28.169 --> 00:03:34.449 
selected and at 150 we can in more so
much<00:03:28.409> more<00:03:29.959> so<00:03:30.959> your<00:03:31.590> options<00:03:32.250> are<00:03:32.579> seen<00:03:33.269> and

00:03:34.449 --> 00:03:34.459 
much more so your options are seen and

00:03:34.459 --> 00:03:44.199 
much more so your options are seen and
in<00:03:35.459> this<00:03:35.849> portion<00:03:36.239> you<00:03:37.760> can<00:03:38.760> also<00:03:42.469> like<00:03:43.469> this

in this portion you can also like this
and<00:03:45.209> this<00:03:46.049> will<00:03:46.199> create<00:03:46.379> more<00:03:46.769> weird<00:03:47.250> of<00:03:47.400> fact

00:03:47.809 --> 00:03:47.819 
and this will create more weird of fact

00:03:47.819 --> 00:03:56.990 
and this will create more weird of fact
but<00:03:48.269> I<00:03:50.120> only<00:03:51.120> like<00:03:51.389> use<00:03:52.319> in<00:03:54.260> 40<00:03:55.260> or<00:03:55.290> 50<00:03:56.040> you<00:03:56.519> same

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:04.909 
but I only like use in 40 or 50 you same
key<00:03:57.569> selected<00:04:00.290> simply<00:04:01.290> increase<00:04:01.859> to<00:04:02.759> 10<00:04:03.919> so

00:04:04.909 --> 00:04:04.919 
key selected simply increase to 10 so

00:04:04.919 --> 00:04:09.219 
key selected simply increase to 10 so
slight<00:04:05.720> animation<00:04:06.720> where<00:04:07.169> ski<00:04:07.620> selected<00:04:08.220> and

00:04:09.219 --> 00:04:09.229 
slight animation where ski selected and

00:04:09.229 --> 00:04:23.379 
slight animation where ski selected and
in<00:04:10.229> this<00:04:10.560> version<00:04:14.750> can<00:04:16.639> zoom<00:04:17.639> it<00:04:17.849> more<00:04:18.120> closer

00:04:23.379 --> 00:04:23.389 

00:04:23.389 --> 00:04:27.890 

but<00:04:24.389> uh<00:04:24.419> this<00:04:25.020> kind<00:04:25.259> of<00:04:25.409> effects<00:04:26.659> will<00:04:27.659> create

00:04:27.890 --> 00:04:27.900 
but uh this kind of effects will create

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:31.100 
but uh this kind of effects will create
a<00:04:27.960> more<00:04:28.229> dynamic<00:04:28.560> camera<00:04:29.220> and<00:04:29.840> say<00:04:30.840> what's

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:31.110 
a more dynamic camera and say what's

00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:35.529 
a more dynamic camera and say what's
happening<00:04:32.300> when<00:04:33.300> red<00:04:33.630> right<00:04:34.280> this<00:04:35.280> little

00:04:35.529 --> 00:04:35.539 
happening when red right this little

00:04:35.539 --> 00:04:40.070 
happening when red right this little
different<00:04:36.539> great<00:04:36.900> more<00:04:37.110> time<00:04:37.469> I<00:04:38.539> can<00:04:39.539> see<00:04:39.750> the

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:40.080 
different great more time I can see the

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:43.520 
different great more time I can see the
renderings<00:04:40.500> are<00:04:41.070> occurring<00:04:42.110> again<00:04:43.110> are<00:04:43.259> just

00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:43.530 
renderings are occurring again are just

00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:45.589 
renderings are occurring again are just
hot<00:04:44.520> the<00:04:44.820> weights

00:04:45.589 --> 00:04:45.599 
hot the weights

00:04:45.599 --> 00:04:50.379 
hot the weights
look<00:04:47.599> nice<00:04:48.599> to<00:04:48.810> one<00:04:48.990> whether<00:04:49.469> you<00:04:49.680> can<00:04:49.830> see

00:04:50.379 --> 00:04:50.389 
look nice to one whether you can see

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:55.959 
look nice to one whether you can see
that<00:04:51.389> options<00:04:51.810> are<00:04:52.080> coming<00:04:52.620> like<00:04:53.479> this<00:04:54.479> and

00:04:55.959 --> 00:04:55.969 
that options are coming like this and

00:04:55.969 --> 00:05:01.510 
that options are coming like this and
create<00:04:56.969> another<00:04:57.270> camera<00:04:57.870> you<00:04:58.169> can

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:01.520 

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:10.570 

and<00:05:02.240> scam<00:05:03.229> AR<00:05:03.530> -<00:05:03.770> oh<00:05:04.810> you<00:05:05.810> can<00:05:06.050> also<00:05:06.759> have<00:05:09.580> at

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:10.580 
and scam AR - oh you can also have at

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:12.700 
and scam AR - oh you can also have at
this<00:05:10.789> camera<00:05:11.240> I<00:05:11.300> can<00:05:11.659> also<00:05:11.840> have<00:05:12.289> like<00:05:12.500> this

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:12.710 
this camera I can also have like this

this<00:06:09.169> area<00:06:09.710> but<00:06:09.889> this<00:06:10.580> will<00:06:10.880> drop<00:06:11.060> back<00:06:11.330> more

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:11.690 
this area but this will drop back more

black I can add my environment variables

00:06:19.159 --> 00:06:21.939 
black I can add my environment variables
like<00:06:19.460> HDR<00:06:20.180> anything<00:06:20.659> so<00:06:20.900> the<00:06:21.319> reflection<00:06:21.680> and

00:06:21.939 --> 00:06:21.949 
like HDR anything so the reflection and

00:06:21.949 --> 00:06:23.559 
like HDR anything so the reflection and
I<00:06:22.039> kept<00:06:22.219> an<00:06:22.370> eye<00:06:22.460> on<00:06:22.490> the<00:06:22.669> entire<00:06:23.000> reflection

00:06:23.559 --> 00:06:23.569 
I kept an eye on the entire reflection

00:06:23.569 --> 00:06:25.749 
I kept an eye on the entire reflection
or<00:06:23.930> refraction<00:06:23.960> and<00:06:24.830> there<00:06:25.340> is<00:06:25.460> one<00:06:25.610> called

00:06:25.749 --> 00:06:25.759 
or refraction and there is one called

00:06:25.759 --> 00:06:27.850 
or refraction and there is one called
inflection<00:06:26.330> limit<00:06:26.569> you<00:06:26.719> can<00:06:26.900> simply<00:06:27.319> increase

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:27.860 
inflection limit you can simply increase

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:31.390 
inflection limit you can simply increase
this<00:06:28.340> and<00:06:29.169> this<00:06:30.169> will<00:06:30.380> take<00:06:30.889> much<00:06:31.159> more<00:06:31.190> time

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:31.400 
this and this will take much more time

00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:37.300 
this and this will take much more time
but<00:06:32.090> more<00:06:32.840> reflection<00:06:33.590> passing<00:06:34.069> okay<00:06:34.520> so<00:06:36.310> more

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:37.310 
but more reflection passing okay so more

00:06:37.310 --> 00:06:41.050 
but more reflection passing okay so more
visible<00:06:38.210> reflection<00:06:38.990> rays<00:06:39.409> coming<00:06:40.250> like<00:06:40.520> here

00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:41.060

00:07:10.629 --> 00:07:10.639 
more spec lock the more options is doing

00:07:10.639 --> 00:07:13.420 
more spec lock the more options is doing
like<00:07:11.000> this

00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:13.430 
like this

00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:15.939 
like this
this<00:07:13.760> area<00:07:14.090> can<00:07:14.240> see<00:07:14.510> your<00:07:15.199> reflection<00:07:15.380> and

00:07:15.939 --> 00:07:15.949 
this area can see your reflection and

00:07:15.949 --> 00:07:23.469 
this area can see your reflection and
that<00:07:16.729> this<00:07:17.030> is<00:07:17.240> more<00:07:21.280> scalar<00:07:22.280> value<00:07:23.120> you<00:07:23.240> can

00:07:23.469 --> 00:07:23.479 
that this is more scalar value you can

00:07:23.479 --> 00:07:29.530 
that this is more scalar value you can
also<00:07:24.910> tell<00:07:25.910> that<00:07:27.220> what<00:07:28.220> you<00:07:28.370> call<00:07:28.669> the<00:07:29.090> radius

00:07:29.530 --> 00:07:29.540 
also tell that what you call the radius

00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:38.439 
also tell that what you call the radius
little<00:07:29.810> bit<00:07:30.169> or<00:07:30.410> you<00:07:30.800> want<00:07:31.449> so<00:07:32.449> are<00:07:32.690> each<00:07:37.449> if

00:07:38.439 --> 00:07:38.449 
little bit or you want so are each if
