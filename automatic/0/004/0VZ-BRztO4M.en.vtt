00:01:14.929 --> 00:01:14.939 
that Stanford would run that power play

00:01:14.939 --> 00:01:18.499

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:36.180 
running back a two way go to play this

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:38.240 
running back a two way go to play this

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:38.250 
foot and get up and down feel the power

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:40.700 
foot and get up and down feel the power
concept<00:01:38.939> is<00:01:39.090> very<00:01:39.150> very<00:01:39.570> different<00:01:40.049> the<00:01:40.500> power

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
concept is very very different the power

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.889 
concept is very very different the power
concept<00:01:41.369> says<00:01:41.520> no<00:01:41.759> instead<00:01:42.210> of<00:01:42.299> zone<00:01:42.509> blocking

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
concept says no instead of zone blocking

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:45.380 
concept says no instead of zone blocking
it's<00:01:43.680> much<00:01:43.890> more<00:01:44.070> of<00:01:44.130> a<00:01:44.280> man<00:01:44.520> blocking<00:01:45.090> the<00:01:45.180> man

00:01:45.380 --> 00:01:45.390 
it's much more of a man blocking the man

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.840 
it's much more of a man blocking the man
responsibilities<00:01:46.380> and<00:01:46.619> in<00:01:47.040> its<00:01:47.189> core<00:01:47.520> and

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:47.850 
responsibilities and in its core and

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.730 
responsibilities and in its core and
what's<00:01:48.060> hard<00:01:48.299> is<00:01:48.479> they<00:01:48.630> do<00:01:48.689> it<00:01:48.869> from<00:01:49.020> so<00:01:49.560> many

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:49.740 
what's hard is they do it from so many

00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:51.260 
what's hard is they do it from so many
different<00:01:50.070> groups<00:01:50.189> of<00:01:50.430> personnel<00:01:50.880> so<00:01:51.000> this<00:01:51.149> is

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:51.270 
different groups of personnel so this is

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:52.819 
different groups of personnel so this is
just<00:01:51.329> a<00:01:51.479> very<00:01:51.689> vanilla<00:01:52.110> look<00:01:52.470> here<00:01:52.680> and<00:01:52.799> a

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
just a very vanilla look here and a

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:55.039 
just a very vanilla look here and a
vanilla<00:01:53.100> sea<00:01:53.430> on<00:01:53.579> defense<00:01:54.090> but<00:01:54.240> the<00:01:54.390> concept

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
vanilla sea on defense but the concept

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:58.039 
vanilla sea on defense but the concept
is<00:01:55.259> we<00:01:55.799> always<00:01:56.159> want<00:01:56.399> to<00:01:56.490> leave<00:01:56.670> to<00:01:57.240> to<00:01:57.930> the

00:01:58.039 --> 00:01:58.049 
is we always want to leave to to the

00:01:58.049 --> 00:01:59.929 
is we always want to leave to to the
side<00:01:58.229> we're<00:01:58.530> running<00:01:58.829> it<00:01:58.979> for<00:01:59.430> the<00:01:59.549> polling

00:01:59.929 --> 00:01:59.939 
side we're running it for the polling

00:01:59.939 --> 00:02:01.760 
side we're running it for the polling
guard<00:02:00.180> and<00:02:00.479> in<00:02:00.540> this<00:02:00.659> case<00:02:00.930> the<00:02:01.170> second<00:02:01.590> tight

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
guard and in this case the second tight

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.679 
guard and in this case the second tight
end<00:02:02.070> so<00:02:02.549> here's<00:02:02.790> what<00:02:02.939> I<00:02:02.969> mean<00:02:03.210> the<00:02:03.360> Seahawks

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689
