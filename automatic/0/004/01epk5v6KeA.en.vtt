00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:17.849
 let's start my back workout and not muscle 

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:19.830
 backs 

00:00:17.849 --> 00:00:22.740
 one of the largest muscle groups 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:24.539
 our body is a pulling muscle group 

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:25.529
 that is, we will perform for her 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:29.220
 workout all 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.269
 traction exercises we will examine exactly 

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:33.300
 basic exercise 

00:00:30.269 --> 00:00:36.300
 These include 6 basic exercises. 

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:39.690
 for training muscles and komi is ours 

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.489
 pulling up on the horizontal bar is a crossbar 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:44.550
 we have 

00:00:40.489 --> 00:00:46.710
 thrust upper chest sitting in 

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:50.160
 the simulator before assembling into the lower unit thrust 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:53.280
 that is, we rowed it we rod 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:55.530
 tilting to the belt this too 

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:59.010
 we have a dumbbell with one hand in the slope 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:02.780
 benefit and can be strained flu to this 

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:04.830
 Exercise base attributed let's start with 

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:07.860
 pulling up on a horizontal bar 

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:09.210
 wide grip me in the hands of the straps then 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:13.590
 because of what they are used right now 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:17.819
 I will explain our brain so that when 

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:19.770
 we grab something that we support 

00:01:17.819 --> 00:01:22.050
 automatically to us something and grab 

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:23.970
 biceps is involved in the work 

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:27.599
 develop and tighten it up 

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:29.640
 we exclude how to do this need to wear 

00:01:27.599 --> 00:01:32.160
 such straps are special adaptations and 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:35.610
 we just kinda tighten them 

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:38.179
 tying on the horizontal bar, I'll show you how 

00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:38.179
 do watch 

00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:49.560
 so here and everything seems to be tightening 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:49.560
 shocked grip and go catch up 

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:07.330
 so what were we doing now in detail 

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:09.610
 we will analyze that is, we take a wide grip 

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:13.990
 google elbows i pick one so 

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:17.310
 he was 90 degrees that is like this 

00:02:13.990 --> 00:02:19.300
 this point it should be 90 degrees 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:21.820
 guided by this angle 

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:26.340
 you need to pull up to the chest 

00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:26.340
 to chin crossed the crossbar 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:34.920
 here that is all just enough then 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:37.560
 there we just take the crossbar 

00:02:34.920 --> 00:02:38.640
 just pull up the chin should 

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:40.260
 be taller than the crossbar 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.900
 at the top you can for a second or two 

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:46.940
 linger the main point so that we 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:48.900
 contracted our back muscles the broadest 

00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:52.310
 the broadest that she makes her move 

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:55.200
 destination is our our shoulder 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:56.820
 connect as it were closer to the body 

00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:04.320
 There is tighten this and appointment 

00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:10.860
 broadest once again stretch your breath 

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:13.130
 us on pulling in on lowering 

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:13.130
 exhale 

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:19.459
 why precisely pulling up the breath 

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:22.129
 because exactly when we inflate 

00:03:19.459 --> 00:03:22.670
 our chest we have going on 

00:03:22.129 --> 00:03:25.730
 more 

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:29.630
 stretching the back muscles i mean i 

00:03:25.730 --> 00:03:32.930
 order to make up pulling up 

00:03:29.630 --> 00:03:35.150
 that is, things are going the other way 

00:03:32.930 --> 00:03:37.900
 further to the next expression all-all 

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:37.900
 see you bye
