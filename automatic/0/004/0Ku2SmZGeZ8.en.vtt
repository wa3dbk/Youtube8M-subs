that<00:02:22.560> but<00:02:23.070> I<00:02:23.130> guess<00:02:23.340> since<00:02:23.520> it's<00:02:23.670> already

00:02:23.840 --> 00:02:23.850

00:02:23.850 --> 00:02:25.520 
that but I guess since it's already
upgrading<00:02:24.330> I<00:02:24.390> have<00:02:24.600> to<00:02:24.750> finish<00:02:24.960> it<00:02:25.200> because<00:02:25.290> I

00:02:25.520 --> 00:02:25.530 
upgrading I have to finish it because I

00:02:25.530 --> 00:02:28.190 
upgrading I have to finish it because I
wanted<00:02:25.680> to<00:02:25.890> do<00:02:26.010> my<00:02:26.160> dragon<00:02:26.700> so<00:02:27.030> there<00:02:27.990> goes<00:02:28.170> one
