00:00:00.469 --> 00:00:09.160 

okay<00:00:02.060> 5.4<00:00:03.060> factoring<00:00:03.720> in<00:00:04.460> complex<00:00:05.460> numbers<00:00:07.910> so

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:09.170 
okay 5.4 factoring in complex numbers so

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:11.450 
okay 5.4 factoring in complex numbers so
properties<00:00:10.170> of<00:00:10.290> negative<00:00:10.710> roots<00:00:10.980> the<00:00:11.219> point

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:11.460 
properties of negative roots the point

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.220 
properties of negative roots the point
is<00:00:11.550> you<00:00:11.700> can<00:00:11.910> have<00:00:12.120> a<00:00:12.179> negative<00:00:12.389> root<00:00:12.870> so<00:00:13.080> what

00:00:13.220 --> 00:00:13.230 
is you can have a negative root so what

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.430 
is you can have a negative root so what
you<00:00:13.320> need<00:00:13.440> to<00:00:13.500> do<00:00:13.740> is<00:00:13.910> we<00:00:14.910> split<00:00:15.780> them<00:00:15.839> up<00:00:15.990> as<00:00:16.230> in

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:16.440 
you need to do is we split them up as in

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:18.859 
you need to do is we split them up as in
a<00:00:16.619> square<00:00:17.070> root<00:00:17.130> of<00:00:17.430> a<00:00:17.550> negative<00:00:17.760> 1<00:00:18.270> and<00:00:18.600> then

00:00:18.859 --> 00:00:18.869 
a square root of a negative 1 and then

00:00:18.869 --> 00:00:20.510 
a square root of a negative 1 and then
whatever<00:00:19.050> the<00:00:19.350> number<00:00:19.650> is<00:00:19.680> left<00:00:20.039> over<00:00:20.220> so<00:00:20.460> you

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:20.520 
whatever the number is left over so you

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:21.859 
whatever the number is left over so you
basically<00:00:20.640> take<00:00:21.000> a<00:00:21.060> negative<00:00:21.300> 1<00:00:21.689> out<00:00:21.840> of

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
basically take a negative 1 out of

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:25.099 
basically take a negative 1 out of
underneath<00:00:23.300> negative<00:00:24.300> 1<00:00:24.510> the<00:00:24.689> square<00:00:24.960> root<00:00:25.080> of

00:00:25.099 --> 00:00:25.109 
underneath negative 1 the square root of

00:00:25.109 --> 00:00:27.769 
underneath negative 1 the square root of
a<00:00:25.199> negative<00:00:25.320> 1<00:00:25.680> is<00:00:25.710> I<00:00:25.980> so<00:00:26.730> we<00:00:27.119> do<00:00:27.330> that<00:00:27.539> so<00:00:27.720> we

00:00:27.769 --> 00:00:27.779 
a negative 1 is I so we do that so we

00:00:27.779 --> 00:00:30.080 
a negative 1 is I so we do that so we
can<00:00:27.930> actually<00:00:28.080> solve<00:00:28.699> problems<00:00:29.699> that<00:00:29.849> have

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.090 
can actually solve problems that have

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:31.820 
can actually solve problems that have
negative<00:00:30.630> roots<00:00:30.900> we<00:00:31.170> take<00:00:31.439> that<00:00:31.619> negative

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:31.830 
negative roots we take that negative

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.010 
negative roots we take that negative
root<00:00:32.219> out<00:00:32.399> and<00:00:32.669> we<00:00:32.730> make<00:00:32.969> that<00:00:33.149> and<00:00:33.360> I<00:00:33.450> in<00:00:33.809> order

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:34.020 
root out and we make that and I in order

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.500 
root out and we make that and I in order
to<00:00:34.079> solve<00:00:34.320> it<00:00:34.500> so<00:00:35.040> it's<00:00:35.160> actually<00:00:35.280> I<00:00:35.579> square

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:36.510 
to solve it so it's actually I square

00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:38.569 
to solve it so it's actually I square
root<00:00:36.660> of<00:00:36.719> ours<00:00:36.989> what<00:00:37.230> that<00:00:37.350> would<00:00:37.500> be<00:00:37.530> so<00:00:38.340> if<00:00:38.460> i

00:00:38.569 --> 00:00:38.579 
root of ours what that would be so if i

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:40.850 
root of ours what that would be so if i
had<00:00:38.760> the<00:00:39.300> square<00:00:40.020> root<00:00:40.170> of<00:00:40.230> negative<00:00:40.410> 5<00:00:40.829> i

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:40.860 
had the square root of negative 5 i

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.380 
had the square root of negative 5 i
would<00:00:41.160> separate<00:00:41.460> that<00:00:41.700> into<00:00:41.940> the<00:00:42.030> square<00:00:42.239> root

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:42.390 
would separate that into the square root

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:43.819 
would separate that into the square root
of<00:00:42.420> negative<00:00:42.540> 1<00:00:42.989> on<00:00:43.079> the<00:00:43.110> square<00:00:43.410> root<00:00:43.530> of<00:00:43.590> 5

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829 
of negative 1 on the square root of 5

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.440 
of negative 1 on the square root of 5
and<00:00:44.190> just<00:00:44.700> remember<00:00:44.879> whenever<00:00:45.180> you<00:00:45.329> have<00:00:45.390> a

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 
and just remember whenever you have a

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:46.970 
and just remember whenever you have a
negative<00:00:45.660> underneath<00:00:46.260> you<00:00:46.440> basically<00:00:46.710> pull

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:46.980 
negative underneath you basically pull

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.279 
negative underneath you basically pull
that<00:00:47.129> negative<00:00:47.489> out<00:00:47.640> and<00:00:47.850> make<00:00:48.059> it<00:00:48.090> an<00:00:48.300> eye<00:00:48.420> so

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
that negative out and make it an eye so

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.040 
that negative out and make it an eye so
the<00:00:49.350> square<00:00:49.620> root<00:00:49.739> of<00:00:49.829> negative<00:00:50.149> 5<00:00:51.149> would<00:00:51.750> be<00:00:51.780> I

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050 
the square root of negative 5 would be I

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:57.350 
the square root of negative 5 would be I
root<00:00:52.680> 5<00:00:52.920> as<00:00:53.250> your<00:00:53.579> answer<00:00:55.190> square<00:00:56.190> root<00:00:56.520> of<00:00:56.699> our

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
root 5 as your answer square root of our

00:00:57.360 --> 00:01:00.560 
root 5 as your answer square root of our
are<00:00:58.170> so<00:00:58.410> I<00:00:58.440> square<00:00:59.129> root<00:00:59.250> of<00:00:59.309> R<00:00:59.460> squared<00:00:59.879> well

00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:00.570 
are so I square root of R squared well

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:01.700 
are so I square root of R squared well
what<00:01:00.690> that<00:01:00.840> means<00:01:00.989> is<00:01:01.109> you<00:01:01.199> have<00:01:01.289> two<00:01:01.469> of<00:01:01.590> those

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:01.710 
what that means is you have two of those

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:05.420 
what that means is you have two of those
so<00:01:01.920> I<00:01:02.129> times<00:01:02.460> I<00:01:02.730> is<00:01:02.760> I<00:01:03.329> squared<00:01:04.070> school<00:01:05.070> every

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:05.430 
so I times I is I squared school every

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.880 
so I times I is I squared school every
bars<00:01:05.700> in<00:01:05.850> the<00:01:05.939> square<00:01:06.180> root<00:01:06.330> of<00:01:06.360> r<00:01:06.600> is<00:01:06.890> the

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
bars in the square root of r is the

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:10.250 
bars in the square root of r is the
square<00:01:07.920> root<00:01:08.220> of<00:01:08.549> R<00:01:08.850> squared<00:01:09.360> well<00:01:09.720> that's<00:01:10.020> i

00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:10.260 
square root of R squared well that's i

00:01:10.260 --> 00:01:12.679 
square root of R squared well that's i
squared<00:01:10.740> the<00:01:11.400> square<00:01:11.430> root<00:01:11.939> of<00:01:12.090> a<00:01:12.299> square

00:01:12.679 --> 00:01:12.689 
squared the square root of a square

00:01:12.689 --> 00:01:16.789 
squared the square root of a square
cancels<00:01:12.990> out<00:01:13.380> to<00:01:13.619> end<00:01:13.830> up<00:01:14.010> with<00:01:14.780> our<00:01:15.780> just<00:01:16.680> an

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799 
cancels out to end up with our just an

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:19.130 
cancels out to end up with our just an
are<00:01:16.979> there<00:01:17.250> but<00:01:17.610> we<00:01:18.509> need<00:01:18.630> to<00:01:18.689> remember<00:01:18.750> some

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140 
are there but we need to remember some

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:23.600 
are there but we need to remember some
things<00:01:19.369> about<00:01:20.369> this<00:01:21.229> these<00:01:22.229> two<00:01:22.560> items<00:01:22.799> cancel

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:23.610 
things about this these two items cancel

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:26.149 
things about this these two items cancel
so<00:01:23.790> that's<00:01:23.909> negative<00:01:24.210> and<00:01:25.020> we<00:01:25.680> end<00:01:25.830> up<00:01:25.950> getting

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159 
so that's negative and we end up getting

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:29.240 
so that's negative and we end up getting
a<00:01:26.250> negative<00:01:26.580> are<00:01:27.409> so<00:01:28.409> what<00:01:28.560> that<00:01:28.590> means<00:01:28.890> is<00:01:29.070> you

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250 
a negative are so what that means is you

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:32.539 
a negative are so what that means is you
square<00:01:29.579> that<00:01:29.610> you<00:01:29.880> get<00:01:30.030> I<00:01:30.210> squared<00:01:30.930> +<00:01:31.549> square

00:01:32.539 --> 00:01:32.549 
square that you get I squared + square

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:34.609 
square that you get I squared + square
root<00:01:32.579> a<00:01:32.970> square<00:01:33.509> you<00:01:34.140> end<00:01:34.320> up<00:01:34.439> getting

00:01:34.609 --> 00:01:34.619 
root a square you end up getting

00:01:34.619 --> 00:01:36.410 
root a square you end up getting
whatever<00:01:34.950> numbers<00:01:35.400> underneath<00:01:35.700> because<00:01:36.090> they

00:01:36.410 --> 00:01:36.420 
whatever numbers underneath because they

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:38.810 
whatever numbers underneath because they
cancel<00:01:36.900> out<00:01:36.990> soon<00:01:37.290> dope<00:01:37.470> getting<00:01:37.560> a<00:01:37.770> three<00:01:38.100> so

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:38.820 
cancel out soon dope getting a three so

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.630 
cancel out soon dope getting a three so
i<00:01:38.850> should<00:01:39.090> get<00:01:39.240> three<00:01:39.689> and<00:01:40.020> a<00:01:40.259> negative<00:01:40.650> one<00:01:40.860> so

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:41.640 
i should get three and a negative one so

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:45.200 
i should get three and a negative one so
negative<00:01:42.570> 1<00:01:42.600> times<00:01:43.079> 3<00:01:43.500> is<00:01:43.530> negative<00:01:44.040> 3<00:01:44.579> as<00:01:44.759> my

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:45.210 
negative 1 times 3 is negative 3 as my

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:48.289 
negative 1 times 3 is negative 3 as my
answer<00:01:46.579> but<00:01:47.579> what<00:01:47.700> you<00:01:47.790> need<00:01:47.909> to<00:01:48.000> keep<00:01:48.149> in<00:01:48.270> mind

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
answer but what you need to keep in mind

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:53.030 
answer but what you need to keep in mind
is<00:01:48.780> I<00:01:49.020> squared<00:01:49.710> is<00:01:50.670> negative<00:01:51.420> 1<00:01:51.869> okay<00:01:52.860> i

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:53.040 
is I squared is negative 1 okay i

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.260 
is I squared is negative 1 okay i
squared<00:01:53.790> is<00:01:54.060> negative<00:01:54.680> 1<00:01:55.680> so<00:01:55.979> I<00:01:56.189> is<00:01:56.700> root

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:57.270 
squared is negative 1 so I is root

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:59.600 
squared is negative 1 so I is root
negative<00:01:57.689> 1<00:01:57.899> and<00:01:57.930> i<00:01:58.259> squared<00:01:58.740> is<00:01:58.950> negative<00:01:59.219> 1

00:01:59.600 --> 00:01:59.610 
negative 1 and i squared is negative 1

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:03.859 
negative 1 and i squared is negative 1
so<00:02:00.600> we<00:02:01.229> go<00:02:01.350> to<00:02:01.409> solve<00:02:01.680> this<00:02:01.920> I<00:02:02.600> need<00:02:03.600> to<00:02:03.659> get<00:02:03.780> all

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
so we go to solve this I need to get all

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.480

the<00:02:03.990> numbers<00:02:04.259> on<00:02:04.439> the<00:02:04.469> one<00:02:04.740> side<00:02:04.770> here<00:02:05.310> so

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:05.490 
the numbers on the one side here so

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:08.600 
the numbers on the one side here so
let's<00:02:05.700> move<00:02:05.850> that<00:02:06.090> 10<00:02:06.299> /<00:02:06.540> so<00:02:07.290> i<00:02:07.619> would<00:02:08.160> subtract

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:08.610 
let's move that 10 / so i would subtract

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:11.360 
let's move that 10 / so i would subtract

squared three times x squared is

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.699 
squared three times x squared is

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:08.830 
start in the center and go over negative
3<00:04:05.329> on<00:04:06.199> the<00:04:06.260> real<00:04:07.069> and<00:04:07.400> you<00:04:07.459> will<00:04:07.579> go<00:04:07.669> up<00:04:07.909> to<00:04:07.940> I<00:04:08.299> on

00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:08.840 
3 on the real and you will go up to I on

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:13.640 
3 on the real and you will go up to I on
the<00:04:09.319> imaginary<00:04:09.739> axis

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:13.650 

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:17.090 

you<00:04:14.650> distribute<00:04:15.550> the<00:04:15.670> same<00:04:15.879> way<00:04:16.090> with<00:04:16.239> eyes<00:04:16.510> so

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:17.100 
you distribute the same way with eyes so

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:20.819 
you distribute the same way with eyes so
5<00:04:18.100> times<00:04:18.130> negative<00:04:19.060> 2<00:04:19.510> is<00:04:19.690> negative<00:04:19.870> 10<00:04:20.320> 5

00:04:20.819 --> 00:04:20.829 
5 times negative 2 is negative 10 5

00:04:20.829 --> 00:04:25.020 
5 times negative 2 is negative 10 5
times<00:04:21.220> I<00:04:21.430> is<00:04:21.880> positive<00:04:22.419> 5<00:04:22.660> I<00:04:22.889> so<00:04:23.889> that's<00:04:24.880> really

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:25.030 
times I is positive 5 I so that's really

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:27.090

4i times 2i is negative 8 I square you

00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:45.210 
4i times 2i is negative 8 I square you
can<00:04:41.979> buy<00:04:42.130> your<00:04:42.310> life<00:04:42.490> terms<00:04:42.880> and<00:04:43.860> you<00:04:44.860> end<00:04:45.070> up

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:45.220 
can buy your life terms and you end up

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:47.520 
can buy your life terms and you end up
getting<00:04:45.430> 18<00:04:46.270> I<00:04:46.540> but<00:04:46.930> the<00:04:47.110> gun<00:04:47.139> remember<00:04:47.500> i

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:47.530 
getting 18 I but the gun remember i

00:04:47.530 --> 00:04:51.300 
getting 18 I but the gun remember i
squared<00:04:48.160> I<00:04:48.400> squared<00:04:49.360> equals<00:04:49.870> negative<00:04:50.050> 1<00:04:50.310> so

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:51.310 
squared I squared equals negative 1 so

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:53.580 
squared I squared equals negative 1 so
we<00:04:51.669> can<00:04:51.850> substitute<00:04:52.120> by<00:04:52.660> plugging<00:04:52.930> a<00:04:53.169> negative

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:53.590 
we can substitute by plugging a negative

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:55.650 
we can substitute by plugging a negative
1<00:04:53.800> in<00:04:53.979> there<00:04:54.220> and<00:04:54.400> we<00:04:54.639> can<00:04:54.760> combine<00:04:54.970> those<00:04:55.389> so

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:55.660 
1 in there and we can combine those so

00:04:55.660 --> 00:04:58.409 
1 in there and we can combine those so
we<00:04:55.750> end<00:04:55.900> up<00:04:56.020> with<00:04:56.050> 18<00:04:56.770> eyes<00:04:57.010> and<00:04:57.490> that's<00:04:58.270> a

00:04:58.409 --> 00:04:58.419 
we end up with 18 eyes and that's a

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:00.390 
we end up with 18 eyes and that's a
negative<00:04:58.810> 1<00:04:59.080> so<00:04:59.380> negative<00:04:59.770> 8<00:04:59.919> times<00:05:00.220> negative

00:05:00.390 --> 00:05:00.400 
negative 1 so negative 8 times negative

00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:04.469 
negative 1 so negative 8 times negative
1<00:05:00.790> is<00:05:00.820> positive<00:05:01.150> 8<00:05:01.630> negative<00:05:02.500> 7<00:05:03.160> plus<00:05:03.310> 8<00:05:03.850> is<00:05:03.880> one

00:05:04.469 --> 00:05:04.479 
1 is positive 8 negative 7 plus 8 is one

00:05:04.479 --> 00:05:09.000 
1 is positive 8 negative 7 plus 8 is one
so<00:05:05.260> you<00:05:05.350> end<00:05:05.500> up<00:05:05.530> with<00:05:05.680> one<00:05:06.120> plus<00:05:07.120> 89<00:05:07.919> you<00:05:08.919> can

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:09.010 
so you end up with one plus 89 you can

00:05:09.010 --> 00:05:12.240 
so you end up with one plus 89 you can
even<00:05:09.100> distribute<00:05:09.550> here<00:05:09.790> 6<00:05:10.150> times<00:05:10.419> 6<00:05:10.750> is<00:05:11.020> 36<00:05:11.440> 6

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:12.250 
even distribute here 6 times 6 is 36 6

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:15.270 
even distribute here 6 times 6 is 36 6
times<00:05:12.460> negative<00:05:12.639> 3i<00:05:13.090> is<00:05:13.270> negative<00:05:13.810> 89<00:05:14.380> 3i

negative 3i well 3 times negative 3 is

00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:26.700 
negative 3i well 3 times negative 3 is
negative<00:05:21.550> 9<00:05:21.970> I<00:05:22.330> times<00:05:23.050> I<00:05:23.350> is<00:05:23.620> I<00:05:23.950> squared<00:05:23.979> and<00:05:25.710> i

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:26.710 
negative 9 I times I is I squared and i

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:30.810 
negative 9 I times I is I squared and i
squared<00:05:27.370> remember<00:05:27.850> is<00:05:28.560> negative<00:05:29.560> 1<00:05:29.830> but<00:05:30.580> this

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:30.820 
squared remember is negative 1 but this

00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:33.600 
squared remember is negative 1 but this
negative<00:05:31.300> 18i<00:05:32.020> and<00:05:32.410> positive<00:05:32.860> 18<00:05:33.160> I<00:05:33.310> they

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:33.610 
negative 18i and positive 18 I they

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:36.600 
negative 18i and positive 18 I they
cancel<00:05:34.090> out<00:05:34.240> so<00:05:34.780> really<00:05:34.960> over<00:05:35.169> 36<00:05:35.860> and<00:05:36.190> i

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:36.610 
cancel out so really over 36 and i

00:05:36.610 --> 00:05:39.000 
cancel out so really over 36 and i
squared<00:05:37.120> is<00:05:37.360> negative<00:05:37.479> 1<00:05:37.960> so<00:05:38.289> a<00:05:38.320> negative<00:05:38.650> 9

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:39.010 
squared is negative 1 so a negative 9

00:05:39.010 --> 00:05:42.180 
squared is negative 1 so a negative 9
times<00:05:39.400> negative<00:05:39.610> 1<00:05:40.060> it's<00:05:40.600> positive<00:05:41.139> 9<00:05:41.320> so<00:05:41.650> 36

00:05:42.180 --> 00:05:42.190 
times negative 1 it's positive 9 so 36

00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:50.950 
times negative 1 it's positive 9 so 36
plus<00:05:42.550> 9<00:05:42.820> is<00:05:42.870> 45

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:50.960 

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:54.170 

okay<00:05:51.960> so<00:05:52.020> um<00:05:52.650> you<00:05:53.220> can't<00:05:53.460> have<00:05:53.640> eyes<00:05:53.850> on<00:05:53.880> the

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:54.180 
okay so um you can't have eyes on the

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:55.760 
okay so um you can't have eyes on the
bottom<00:05:54.540> just<00:05:54.750> like<00:05:54.840> you<00:05:54.990> can't<00:05:55.230> have<00:05:55.380> roots<00:05:55.620> in

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:55.770 
bottom just like you can't have roots in

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:57.110 
bottom just like you can't have roots in
the<00:05:55.890> bottom<00:05:56.250> just<00:05:56.370> like<00:05:56.490> you<00:05:56.670> can<00:05:56.910> have

00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:57.120 
the bottom just like you can have

00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:58.760 
the bottom just like you can have
rational<00:05:57.720> exponents<00:05:58.230> in<00:05:58.260> the<00:05:58.380> bottom<00:05:58.650> which

00:05:58.760 --> 00:05:58.770 
rational exponents in the bottom which

00:05:58.770 --> 00:06:00.770 
rational exponents in the bottom which
we'll<00:05:58.920> get<00:05:59.040> to<00:05:59.100> so<00:06:00.030> since<00:06:00.300> you<00:06:00.360> can<00:06:00.570> have<00:06:00.690> an

00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:00.780 
we'll get to so since you can have an

00:06:00.780 --> 00:06:01.940 
we'll get to so since you can have an
eye<00:06:00.870> on<00:06:00.900> the<00:06:01.080> bottom<00:06:01.230> we<00:06:01.500> have<00:06:01.530> to<00:06:01.680> figure<00:06:01.830> out

00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:01.950 
eye on the bottom we have to figure out

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:03.530 
eye on the bottom we have to figure out
a<00:06:02.070> way<00:06:02.250> to<00:06:02.310> get<00:06:02.490> rid<00:06:02.700> of<00:06:02.730> it<00:06:02.910> to<00:06:02.970> get<00:06:03.240> the<00:06:03.390> eyes

00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:03.540 
a way to get rid of it to get the eyes

00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:07.670 
a way to get rid of it to get the eyes
to<00:06:03.810> cancel<00:06:04.260> out<00:06:04.350> it's<00:06:05.090> 1-2<00:06:06.090> I<00:06:06.330> so<00:06:07.230> to<00:06:07.320> get<00:06:07.470> rid

00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:07.680 
to cancel out it's 1-2 I so to get rid

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:09.050 
to cancel out it's 1-2 I so to get rid
of<00:06:07.710> it<00:06:07.860> you<00:06:07.980> take<00:06:08.100> the<00:06:08.280> opposite<00:06:08.820> of<00:06:08.910> the<00:06:09.030> eye

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:09.060 
of it you take the opposite of the eye

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:11.030 
of it you take the opposite of the eye
so<00:06:09.660> we're<00:06:09.930> going<00:06:10.020> to<00:06:10.110> multiply<00:06:10.200> both<00:06:10.680> the<00:06:10.740> top

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:11.040 
so we're going to multiply both the top

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:14.600 
so we're going to multiply both the top
and<00:06:11.100> the<00:06:11.250> bottom<00:06:11.430> by<00:06:11.990> 1<00:06:12.990> plus<00:06:13.440> 2i<00:06:13.830> on<00:06:14.280> both<00:06:14.490> the

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:14.610 
and the bottom by 1 plus 2i on both the

00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:16.550 
and the bottom by 1 plus 2i on both the
top<00:06:14.700> and<00:06:14.850> the<00:06:15.030> bottom<00:06:15.210> which<00:06:15.960> means<00:06:16.230> i<00:06:16.380> need<00:06:16.410> to

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:16.560 
top and the bottom which means i need to

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:19.010 
top and the bottom which means i need to
foil<00:06:17.070> the<00:06:17.280> bottom<00:06:17.670> foil<00:06:18.000> the<00:06:18.120> top<00:06:18.360> it's<00:06:18.690> just<00:06:18.930> a

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:19.020 
foil the bottom foil the top it's just a

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:22.970 
foil the bottom foil the top it's just a
lot<00:06:19.230> of<00:06:19.290> foiling<00:06:19.710> so<00:06:20.460> 5<00:06:20.880> times<00:06:20.910> 1<00:06:21.450> is<00:06:21.480> 5<00:06:21.840> 5<00:06:22.650> times

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:22.980 
lot of foiling so 5 times 1 is 5 5 times

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:27.170 
lot of foiling so 5 times 1 is 5 5 times
2i<00:06:23.250> is<00:06:23.460> 10<00:06:23.880> I<00:06:23.910> 3i<00:06:24.900> times<00:06:25.230> one<00:06:25.530> is<00:06:25.560> three<00:06:25.770> I<00:06:26.180> 3i

00:06:27.170 --> 00:06:27.180 
2i is 10 I 3i times one is three I 3i

00:06:27.180 --> 00:06:31.160 
2i is 10 I 3i times one is three I 3i
times<00:06:27.660> 2i<00:06:28.110> is<00:06:28.710> 6i<00:06:29.430> squared<00:06:29.490> on<00:06:30.180> the<00:06:30.750> bottom<00:06:30.960> we

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:31.170 
times 2i is 6i squared on the bottom we

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:35.170 
times 2i is 6i squared on the bottom we
get<00:06:31.560> 1<00:06:31.950> times<00:06:31.980> 1<00:06:32.460> is<00:06:32.490> 1<00:06:32.910> 1<00:06:33.690> x<00:06:33.990> 2<00:06:34.110> I<00:06:34.320> is<00:06:34.530> to<00:06:35.070> I

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:35.180 
get 1 times 1 is 1 1 x 2 I is to I

00:06:35.180 --> 00:06:38.150 
get 1 times 1 is 1 1 x 2 I is to I
negative<00:06:36.180> 2i<00:06:36.360> times<00:06:36.720> 1<00:06:36.990> is<00:06:37.020> negative<00:06:37.260> 2i<00:06:37.680> and

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:38.160 
negative 2i times 1 is negative 2i and

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:40.790 
negative 2i times 1 is negative 2i and
negative<00:06:38.520> 2i<00:06:38.730> times<00:06:39.180> 2i<00:06:39.570> is<00:06:39.750> negative<00:06:40.020> 4i

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:40.800 
negative 2i times 2i is negative 4i

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:43.730 
negative 2i times 2i is negative 4i
squared<00:06:41.150> remember<00:06:42.150> all<00:06:42.690> your<00:06:43.170> I<00:06:43.230> Squared's

00:06:43.730 --> 00:06:43.740 
squared remember all your I Squared's

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:45.950 
squared remember all your I Squared's
become<00:06:43.980> negative<00:06:44.370> ones<00:06:44.640> and<00:06:45.000> let's<00:06:45.300> combine

00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:45.960 
become negative ones and let's combine

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:48.790 
become negative ones and let's combine
like<00:06:46.350> terms<00:06:46.410> so<00:06:46.890> 2i<00:06:47.190> and<00:06:47.460> negative<00:06:47.730> 2i<00:06:47.880> cancel

00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:48.800 
like terms so 2i and negative 2i cancel

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:51.680 
like terms so 2i and negative 2i cancel
so<00:06:49.800> get<00:06:50.040> a<00:06:50.070> negative<00:06:50.220> 1<00:06:50.550> and<00:06:50.580> they're<00:06:50.880> negative

00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:51.690 
so get a negative 1 and they're negative

00:06:51.690 --> 00:06:54.260 
so get a negative 1 and they're negative
1<00:06:52.020> in<00:06:52.110> there<00:06:52.410> so<00:06:53.100> that<00:06:53.130> becomes<00:06:53.580> a<00:06:53.700> negative<00:06:53.790> 6

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:54.270 
1 in there so that becomes a negative 6

00:06:54.270 --> 00:06:57.500 
1 in there so that becomes a negative 6
on<00:06:54.450> top<00:06:54.660> that<00:06:55.020> becomes<00:06:55.410> a<00:06:55.740> positive<00:06:56.010> 4<00:06:56.550> so<00:06:57.480> I

00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:57.510 
on top that becomes a positive 4 so I

00:06:57.510 --> 00:06:59.240 
on top that becomes a positive 4 so I
combine<00:06:57.870> my<00:06:57.900> like<00:06:58.140> terms<00:06:58.200> to<00:06:58.590> get<00:06:58.740> five<00:06:58.980> in<00:06:59.160> the

00:06:59.240 --> 00:06:59.250 
combine my like terms to get five in the

00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:02.480 
combine my like terms to get five in the
bottom<00:06:59.510> five<00:07:00.510> and<00:07:00.930> negative<00:07:01.110> 6<00:07:01.590> is<00:07:01.740> negative<00:07:01.800> 1

00:07:02.480 --> 00:07:02.490 
bottom five and negative 6 is negative 1

00:07:02.490 --> 00:07:10.760 
bottom five and negative 6 is negative 1
plus<00:07:03.330> 13<00:07:04.020> I<00:07:04.260> over<00:07:04.830> 5<00:07:08.690> so<00:07:09.690> I<00:07:09.750> come<00:07:10.050> back<00:07:10.320> we<00:07:10.740> will

00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:10.770 
plus 13 I over 5 so I come back we will

00:07:10.770 --> 00:07:12.530 
plus 13 I over 5 so I come back we will
finish<00:07:11.340> up<00:07:11.640> with<00:07:11.760> the<00:07:11.880> absolute<00:07:12.240> value<00:07:12.510> of
