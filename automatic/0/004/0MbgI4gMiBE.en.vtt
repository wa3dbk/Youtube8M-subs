 [Music] 

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:13.949
 [Applause] 

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:25.430
 Clothes, it's okay to come in with this guy. 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.430
 bike on your bus 

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:36.180
 sorry and thank you thigh just the time 

00:00:34.559 --> 00:00:39.150
 spent on these two buses 

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.710
 I think it would have been pedaling 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:42.360
 but I wanted to see how the 

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:44.129
 acceptance of personal use in the leaves 

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.010
 Bus a good 

00:00:44.129 --> 00:00:48.570
 whenever we talk about using bicycles 

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:50.820
 of urban mobility 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:54.150
 we think about these folding models 

00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:57.600
 this more practical model and I decided to do 

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:58.350
 this test today has several things to 

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.170
 do 

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:03.659
 so I'll put that damned here not 

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:05.909
 in urban warfare and let's see how it 

00:01:03.659 --> 00:01:07.530
 You know that I use a bicycle. 

00:01:05.909 --> 00:01:10.049
 in a conventional manner 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:11.790
 So, on my way, let's see. 

00:01:10.049 --> 00:01:14.090
 How is this little dude going to behave? 

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:14.090
 today 

00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:29.830
 [Music] 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:02:03.790
 since it was the 2011 reveals if it leaves in the 

00:01:29.830 --> 00:02:05.890
 I try the guys before I forget 

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:08.410
 still doing this test here in Bahia 

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:10.300
 Just kidding but remember you bike. 

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:13.140
 there is nothing to walk on the sidewalk for 

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:13.140
 sidewalk for pedestrians 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:20.520
 and mounted on the bike disrupting 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:22.620
 pedestrians have to remember that here is 

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:25.220
 pedestrian you are moving from neighborhoods and 

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:28.110
 Also pedestrian on the sidewalk or in the range 

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:30.510
 in public places was when you were 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:32.670
 pushing and I've seen and hit 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:35.220
 Someone can close the pedals, right? 

00:02:32.670 --> 00:02:38.900
 There you will not even get your cinnamon in cinnamon 

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:38.900
 nobody gets narrower 

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:44.080
 [Music] 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:58.319
 friends she can take a bike trial on 

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:00.769
 mobility will not be able to 

00:02:58.319 --> 00:03:00.769
 pay 

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:17.720
 [Music] 

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:28.509
 I am 

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:28.509
 [Music] 

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:33.530
 I decided to do this test with the bike 

00:03:31.790 --> 00:03:36.200
 foldable because everyone says it's going 

00:03:33.530 --> 00:03:40.610
 folding is fragile the joints do not 

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:42.620
 the bike is made of aluminum and light and 

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:45.380
 very resistant I did not have any 

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:48.290
 problem and we're going on here doing the 

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:50.240
 our urban exploration 

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:52.610
 if you do not have a tactic that she 

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:54.530
 discrete size of this ring 12 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:55.310
 here is the most practical part to use in 

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:58.459
 City 

00:03:55.310 --> 00:04:01.010
 look only two toothpicks and fold it can 

00:03:58.459 --> 00:04:02.480
 make any service come into 

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:05.410
 anywhere 

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:05.410
 Look how sloppy it is. 

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:15.700
 who attests to the rubber band here 

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:15.700
 keep her closed closed it was already 

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:37.860
 [Music] 

00:04:42.290 --> 00:04:51.279
 [Music] 

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:52.809
 This is what everything has to do with life. 

00:04:51.279 --> 00:04:53.499
 race that we take in the big 

00:04:52.809 --> 00:04:55.240
 centers 

00:04:53.499 --> 00:04:57.430
 you can get anywhere to use 

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:59.469
 public transport is to enter the 

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:02.680
 restaurant go to school with her no 

00:04:59.469 --> 00:05:05.319
 has low loads the needed you fold 

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:07.599
 guard anywhere is to mike a lot 

00:05:05.319 --> 00:05:09.819
 confidence that leaves you in the 

00:05:07.599 --> 00:05:13.240
 face up and down the relationship 

00:05:09.819 --> 00:05:15.939
 The crown will weigh 52 

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:18.969
 much in your life but it is well combined 

00:05:15.939 --> 00:05:20.830
 with cassette 34 I did not face 

00:05:18.969 --> 00:05:23.139
 Difficulty: Moderate 

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:24.819
 Everything is very cool riding. 

00:05:23.139 --> 00:05:28.270
 so I hope you have enjoyed it if 

00:05:24.819 --> 00:05:34.209
 See you around the next videos, thanks. 

00:05:28.270 --> 00:05:34.209
 [Music] 

00:05:38.229 --> 00:05:43.990
 I do the same bike trial maneuver 

00:05:40.719 --> 00:05:46.719
 serve she does not react 

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:50.740
 I made a shape that I would make patrial 

00:05:46.719 --> 00:05:52.599
 I need to change the way I do what I 

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:53.680
 I tried to pass here it did not work, I just finished 

00:05:52.599 --> 00:05:56.409
 breaking my leg so I think I 'm going 

00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:58.990
 sneak out and I'll try with this 

00:05:56.409 --> 00:06:02.059
 another thing 

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:02.059
