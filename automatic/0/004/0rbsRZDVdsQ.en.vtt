stuff<00:01:26.189> like<00:01:26.369> this<00:01:26.549> and<00:01:28.430> we'll<00:01:29.430> be<00:01:29.549> looking<00:01:29.640> at

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:30.000 
stuff like this and we'll be looking at

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.630 
stuff like this and we'll be looking at
in<00:01:30.270> future<00:01:30.930> tutorials<00:01:31.079> on<00:01:31.650> zbrush<00:01:32.280> this<00:01:32.520> is

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:32.640 
in future tutorials on zbrush this is

00:01:32.640 --> 00:01:35.990 
in future tutorials on zbrush this is
all<00:01:32.880> done<00:01:33.060> in<00:01:33.090> ZBrush<00:01:33.659> making<00:01:34.259> a<00:01:34.670> all<00:01:35.670> done<00:01:35.880> in

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:36.000 
all done in ZBrush making a all done in

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.080 
all done in ZBrush making a all done in
ZBrush<00:01:36.360> making<00:01:36.750> a<00:01:36.840> zbrush<00:01:37.170> character<00:01:37.650> and

00:01:38.080 --> 00:01:38.090 
ZBrush making a zbrush character and

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:43.219 
ZBrush making a zbrush character and
then<00:01:39.090> doing<00:01:40.280> stuff<00:01:41.280> like<00:01:41.479> textures<00:01:42.479> normal

00:01:43.219 --> 00:01:43.229 
then doing stuff like textures normal

00:01:43.229 --> 00:01:47.480 
then doing stuff like textures normal
maps<00:01:43.500> and<00:01:43.979> bump<00:01:44.399> maps<00:01:45.140> and<00:01:46.280> we'll<00:01:47.280> be<00:01:47.399> looking

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:47.490 
maps and bump maps and we'll be looking

00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:50.179 
maps and bump maps and we'll be looking
at<00:01:47.820> a<00:01:48.060> real-life<00:01:48.930> type<00:01:49.409> of<00:01:49.590> renders<00:01:49.920> so

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:50.189 
at a real-life type of renders so

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:54.109 
at a real-life type of renders so
realistic<00:01:50.640> renders<00:01:50.970> in<00:01:51.270> 3d<00:01:51.600> max<00:01:52.850> this<00:01:53.850> is<00:01:54.000> my

00:01:54.109 --> 00:01:54.119 
realistic renders in 3d max this is my

00:01:54.119 --> 00:01:56.630 
realistic renders in 3d max this is my
website<00:01:54.479> and<00:01:54.979> then<00:01:55.979> we're<00:01:56.130> looking<00:01:56.430> at<00:01:56.610> a

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
website and then we're looking at a

00:01:56.640 --> 00:02:00.350 
website and then we're looking at a
simple<00:01:57.450> modeling<00:01:58.140> techniques<00:01:58.590> and<00:01:59.360> stuff

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360 
simple modeling techniques and stuff

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:06.410 
simple modeling techniques and stuff
like<00:02:00.509> that<00:02:00.570> so<00:02:00.950> um<00:02:03.140> back<00:02:04.140> to<00:02:04.259> this<00:02:05.240> ok<00:02:06.240> let<00:02:06.390> me
