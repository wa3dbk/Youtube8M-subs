00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:19.360
 Bonnie and honesty is the audience 

00:00:17.439 --> 00:00:21.340
 comes to look at it is on and on and on 

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:22.060
 closed circuit inside view canvas country 

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:24.220
 what happens 

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:26.320
 so there are no apologies like on the 

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:30.009
 drove my leak 

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:32.590
 rest had a very good learning school 

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:35.050
 is as a young rider for flexibility 

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:38.800
 steering course insight 

00:00:35.050 --> 00:00:40.780
 each perfect ingredients to be good at 

00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:43.360
 the ordinary can be found on the track 

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:45.670
 the highly technical jobs 166 meters it 

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:48.580
 very quickly 

00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:49.750
 very fast turns this is so I would 

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:51.820
 I don't really hurt myself 

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:52.930
 many very many never sleep much 

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:54.940
 to sleep 

00:00:52.930 --> 00:00:56.350
 mass that little bit on the hollow 

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:57.760
 as much rest as possible because it is about one 

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:59.830
 hand of the ride my assume he 's 

00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:01.989
 night at night while at night 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:03.400
 abnormal for example on the road or one 

00:01:01.989 --> 00:01:04.909
 day we get if we go normally 

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:07.069
 train that in the morning 

00:01:04.909 --> 00:01:08.899
 somewhere a total opposite 

00:01:07.069 --> 00:01:10.670
 rhythm you have to get used to it 

00:01:08.899 --> 00:01:12.409
 one actually punishes by the six-day 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.969
 bit and go there just to live 

00:01:12.409 --> 00:01:15.409
 but the preparation on behalf of the day 

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:17.359
 tour of course handheld from her 

00:01:15.409 --> 00:01:19.399
 awake 

00:01:17.359 --> 00:01:21.140
 very much shorter much more intensive very 

00:01:19.399 --> 00:01:23.359
 many sprints 

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:26.569
 you yourself are constantly at some 

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:28.310
 up to their limits and then into that 

00:01:26.569 --> 00:01:32.380
 very short intensive competition 

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:32.380
 Today two wires to get far 

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:42.440
 good on 

00:01:40.140 --> 00:01:42.440
 the game 

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:51.320
 so find it 

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:52.070
 i'm not getting started when imac cools 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:53.600
 and me there 

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:56.899
 I usually came through soon after 

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:57.500
 noon I am together with the cyclist 

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:00.140
 to get 

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:04.460
 check all cleaning cube 

00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:05.659
 possibly new so hit me then I put 

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.549
 the pitching ready for the boys that 

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:09.500
 possibly want to run and then 8 again 

00:02:07.549 --> 00:02:11.540
 occasionally not everyone happens then 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:14.090
 we do not know in advance 

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.650
 Then you start the evening program 

00:02:14.090 --> 00:02:18.590
 finally pay attention continuously if nothing 

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:20.120
 must happen in the match between in 

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.310
 you also change a number of wheels 

00:02:20.120 --> 00:02:24.260
 Example of a job round or a 500 

00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:25.910
 meter out to prop another gear 

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.709
 in closed wheel 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:29.420
 so actually the riders must constantly 

00:02:27.709 --> 00:02:31.340
 keep it dry and off the slopes 

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:33.170
 come as the direction and brakes 

00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:35.060
 if you assume you are 

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:36.590
 means further in a waste there 

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:39.140
 a woman falling 

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:44.070
 then whole we here i am around 150 

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:48.130
 meters of x less are no longer 

00:02:44.070 --> 00:02:50.830
 and I am always from an 850 kilometer 

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:55.920
 indeed a gentleman here comes over 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:55.920
 with 4500 laps for the weather 

00:02:59.770 --> 00:03:01.920
 how
