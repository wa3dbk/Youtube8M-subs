00:00:00.190 --> 00:00:03.670
 how about all friends here is 

00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:05.200
 commenting on a new video that playing 

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:06.700
 love of combat that guys and this time 

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:08.499
 I bring you a very interesting video 

00:00:06.700 --> 00:00:09.879
 friends how to get out another brutality 

00:00:08.499 --> 00:00:11.740
 secret in one of the screens of 

00:00:09.879 --> 00:00:13.239
 deadly kombat of friends as you can see 

00:00:11.740 --> 00:00:14.559
 is the one I just made with johnny 

00:00:13.239 --> 00:00:16.059
 cage and the truth I want to give 

00:00:14.559 --> 00:00:18.370
 thank you very much to my subscriber 

00:00:16.059 --> 00:00:19.870
 osvaldo cd that if he had not 

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:21.280
 commented about this brutal and you 

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:23.710
 I think maybe I would never have figured 

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:25.500
 that existed and good guys how can 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:28.120
 see is brutal and you 

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.650
 to get it out they need to be playing in 

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:31.180
 the outer world market like this 

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:33.999
 called the screen is the one you are seeing 

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:36.730
 right now and the truth is that 

00:00:33.999 --> 00:00:38.559
 practically almost similar to the one 

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:40.510
 had taken out in my previous episode in 

00:00:38.559 --> 00:00:42.579
 the one on the screen called debut 

00:00:40.510 --> 00:00:44.079
 the only difference friends is that as 

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:47.050
 they could see in the first johnny clip 

00:00:44.079 --> 00:00:49.239
 cage I made myself at the other end of the 

00:00:47.050 --> 00:00:51.579
 screen because I thought that as in the 

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:53.620
 another brutality of the screen 

00:00:51.579 --> 00:00:55.089
 deadwood you had to be a distance 

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:58.030
 of the opponent practically extreme 

00:00:55.089 --> 00:01:00.159
 extreme to pull the trunk or in this 

00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:01.929
 case the old lady so you can get it out 

00:01:00.159 --> 00:01:03.460
 brutality but apparently it's not like that in 

00:01:01.929 --> 00:01:05.980
 this screen the only thing that you have to 

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:08.060
 to do is to perform 

00:01:05.980 --> 00:01:10.190
 practically two actions with two 

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:11.840
 Interactive objects on the screen and 

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:14.210
 after that you just have to throw 

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:16.670
 the old lady does not matter from what distance 

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:18.560
 that's something that cost me to figure but the 

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:22.460
 true that's the truth that I like 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:24.590
 more this brutality since it does not require 

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:27.530
 that you are at the other end of the screen 

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:29.090
 to make it brutal and then 

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.130
 you can pretty much be pretty 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:33.170
 near the opponent after you have 

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:35.390
 has already made two interactions in the 

00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:38.030
 screen of the old woman as well as 

00:01:35.390 --> 00:01:40.220
 this case as they could see co tlcan 

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:43.310
 I was super close to Jason and still 

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:46.250
 has the old lady and still can throw 

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:47.840
 and do it brutality successfully as 

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:49.820
 can see now we are playing with sub 

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:51.619
 0 and the truth that I want to play with him 

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:53.090
 to demonstrate any of the combos that 

00:01:51.619 --> 00:01:54.710
 I had done the truth that not everyone 

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:56.509
 they came out but I did besides some 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:59.630
 but as I tell you friends they only have 

00:01:56.509 --> 00:02:02.479
 to do two interactions from the 

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:04.700
 screen and from there it does not matter to what 

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:08.209
 distance are from the opponent they only have 

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:09.350
 that grab the old lady throw it and they do 

00:02:08.209 --> 00:02:11.269
 the brutal and that the truth that is 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:12.650
 brutal that I liked a lot I liked it 

00:02:11.269 --> 00:02:15.110
 Much more 

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:16.700
 than the previous one since it's easier and the 

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:18.739
 I also like the screen more because 

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.840
 I think the objects are a little more 

00:02:18.739 --> 00:02:22.220
 easy to grab to grab since the 

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:24.230
 screen I think it's not as big as 

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:25.730
 the other one but the truth that I liked 

00:02:24.230 --> 00:02:27.260
 quite that brutal and you friends the 

00:02:25.730 --> 00:02:31.220
 true if you have someone else 

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:32.750
 secret or some similar issue I the 

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:34.819
 can you say in the comments friends and 

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:36.230

00:02:34.819 --> 00:02:38.090
 you as I say thank you is the 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:40.750
 Subscriber can take out this brutality 

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:44.269
 because without him the truth would not have 

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:45.620
 figurative that existed and well guys this 

00:02:44.269 --> 00:02:47.239
