find anything that required various

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:23.210 
find anything that required various
tweaks<00:00:21.439> sort<00:00:22.439> of<00:00:22.500> moving<00:00:22.680> through<00:00:22.920> things

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:23.220 
tweaks sort of moving through things

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.540 
tweaks sort of moving through things
pretty<00:00:23.550> steadily<00:00:24.029> we<00:00:24.720> have<00:00:24.869> another<00:00:25.859> effort

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:26.550 
pretty steadily we have another effort

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.120 
pretty steadily we have another effort
at<00:00:26.880> a<00:00:26.910> pushin<00:00:27.599> McCullough<00:00:27.930> in<00:00:28.380> a<00:00:28.470> few<00:00:28.680> weeks<00:00:28.830> so

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.130 
at a pushin McCullough in a few weeks so

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.040 
at a pushin McCullough in a few weeks so
it<00:00:29.460> gives<00:00:29.640> us<00:00:29.730> actually<00:00:30.210> a<00:00:30.420> little<00:00:30.810> bit<00:00:30.960> of

00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:31.050 
it gives us actually a little bit of

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:34.250 
it gives us actually a little bit of
time<00:00:31.230> to<00:00:31.349> get<00:00:31.529> things<00:00:31.710> prepared<00:00:32.840> you<00:00:33.840> can<00:00:34.020> see

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:34.260 
time to get things prepared you can see

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.060 
time to get things prepared you can see
what's<00:00:34.770> going<00:00:35.040> on<00:00:35.480> here<00:00:36.480> we've<00:00:36.690> got<00:00:37.040> three<00:00:38.040> of

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:38.070 
what's going on here we've got three of

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:40.040 
what's going on here we've got three of
our<00:00:38.399> different<00:00:39.059> rebreathers<00:00:39.540> the<00:00:39.719> one<00:00:39.870> in<00:00:39.960> the

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:40.050 
our different rebreathers the one in the

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:42.860 
our different rebreathers the one in the
middle<00:00:40.320> is<00:00:40.469> the<00:00:40.980> lower<00:00:41.160> half<00:00:41.430> of<00:00:41.730> the<00:00:42.000> travel

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:42.870 
middle is the lower half of the travel

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:45.920 
middle is the lower half of the travel
breather<00:00:43.110> and<00:00:43.440> then<00:00:43.980> we<00:00:44.219> have<00:00:44.539> on<00:00:45.539> the<00:00:45.719> left

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930 
breather and then we have on the left

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:49.279 
breather and then we have on the left
and<00:00:46.140> the<00:00:46.230> right<00:00:46.440> would<00:00:46.800> be<00:00:46.829> the<00:00:47.219> main<00:00:47.430> and<00:00:48.289> the

00:00:49.279 --> 00:00:49.289 
and the right would be the main and the

00:00:49.289 --> 00:00:52.220 
and the right would be the main and the
D<00:00:49.440> Co<00:00:49.620> rebreather<00:00:50.100> the<00:00:50.910> nice<00:00:51.090> thing<00:00:51.300> about<00:00:51.329> the

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:52.230 
D Co rebreather the nice thing about the

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:54.770 
D Co rebreather the nice thing about the
travel<00:00:52.620> breather<00:00:52.860> is<00:00:53.340> that<00:00:54.149> we<00:00:54.420> can<00:00:54.600> use

00:00:54.770 --> 00:00:54.780 
travel breather is that we can use

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.840 
travel breather is that we can use
numerous<00:00:55.559> units<00:00:55.890> we<00:00:56.100> could<00:00:56.250> even<00:00:56.399> put<00:00:56.670> in

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:56.850 
numerous units we could even put in

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.500 
numerous units we could even put in
travel<00:00:57.719> breathers<00:00:58.140> for<00:00:58.800> safety<00:00:59.309> purposes<00:00:59.520> so

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:00.510 
travel breathers for safety purposes so

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:03.319 
travel breathers for safety purposes so
that's<00:01:00.930> pretty<00:01:01.680> convenient<00:01:02.059> over<00:01:03.059> here<00:01:03.210> we've

00:01:03.319 --> 00:01:03.329 
that's pretty convenient over here we've

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:05.840 
that's pretty convenient over here we've
got<00:01:03.409> various<00:01:04.409> crates<00:01:04.799> with<00:01:05.189> a<00:01:05.640> lot<00:01:05.820> of

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:05.850 
got various crates with a lot of

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:07.760 
got various crates with a lot of
different<00:01:06.210> gear<00:01:06.420> in<00:01:06.510> them<00:01:06.600> you<00:01:07.229> see<00:01:07.439> here<00:01:07.680> are

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:07.770 
different gear in them you see here are

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.760 
different gear in them you see here are
three<00:01:07.950> different<00:01:07.979> food<00:01:08.460> tubes<00:01:09.320> we<00:01:10.320> really

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:10.770 
three different food tubes we really

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.500 
three different food tubes we really
used<00:01:11.010> food<00:01:11.310> tubes<00:01:11.580> at<00:01:11.760> different<00:01:12.150> depths<00:01:12.450> and

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:12.510 
used food tubes at different depths and

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:14.740 
used food tubes at different depths and
we<00:01:12.600> can<00:01:12.750> also<00:01:12.900> use<00:01:13.200> these<00:01:13.470> to<00:01:13.740> transport

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:14.750 
we can also use these to transport

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.780 
we can also use these to transport
different<00:01:15.750> pieces<00:01:16.619> of<00:01:16.890> equipment<00:01:16.979> if<00:01:17.460> we<00:01:17.580> need

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
different pieces of equipment if we need

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.999 
different pieces of equipment if we need
to<00:01:18.030> keep<00:01:18.150> them<00:01:18.330> dry<00:01:18.540> and<00:01:18.960> bringing<00:01:19.740> it<00:01:19.860> down

00:01:19.999 --> 00:01:20.009 
to keep them dry and bringing it down

00:01:20.009 --> 00:01:22.490 
to keep them dry and bringing it down
into<00:01:20.220> into<00:01:20.820> a<00:01:20.850> habitat<00:01:21.360> so<00:01:22.080> it's<00:01:22.229> really<00:01:22.380> just

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:22.500 
into into a habitat so it's really just

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:27.890 
into into a habitat so it's really just
a<00:01:22.799> simple<00:01:23.310> tube<00:01:24.290> usually<00:01:25.340> made<00:01:26.340> from<00:01:26.900> well

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:27.900 
a simple tube usually made from well

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:32.719 
a simple tube usually made from well
either<00:01:28.049> PVC<00:01:28.740> or<00:01:29.130> Delrin<00:01:29.640> or<00:01:29.909> abs<00:01:30.479> and<00:01:31.729> they

00:01:32.719 --> 00:01:32.729 
either PVC or Delrin or abs and they

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:34.550 
either PVC or Delrin or abs and they
have<00:01:32.939> to<00:01:33.150> the<00:01:33.540> most<00:01:33.720> important<00:01:34.140> part<00:01:34.380> is<00:01:34.530> you

00:01:34.550 --> 00:01:34.560 
have to the most important part is you

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:37.819 
have to the most important part is you
need<00:01:34.950> a<00:01:34.979> tow<00:01:35.790> ring<00:01:36.030> sealed<00:01:36.329> canister<00:01:36.990> that<00:01:37.680> can

00:01:37.819 --> 00:01:37.829 
need a tow ring sealed canister that can

00:01:37.829 --> 00:01:40.700 
need a tow ring sealed canister that can
hold<00:01:38.040> what<00:01:38.250> you<00:01:38.369> need<00:01:38.549> and<00:01:39.049> then<00:01:40.049> you<00:01:40.200> need<00:01:40.409> a

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:40.710 
hold what you need and then you need a

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:42.140 
hold what you need and then you need a
way<00:01:40.979> to<00:01:41.040> be<00:01:41.220> able<00:01:41.280> to<00:01:41.400> relieve<00:01:41.759> the<00:01:42.000> pressure

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:42.150 
way to be able to relieve the pressure

00:01:42.150 --> 00:01:45.260 
way to be able to relieve the pressure
at<00:01:42.869> depth<00:01:43.290> so<00:01:43.799> once<00:01:44.100> you<00:01:44.250> bring<00:01:44.430> this<00:01:44.640> canister

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:45.270 
at depth so once you bring this canister

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:46.999 
at depth so once you bring this canister
down<00:01:45.600> a<00:01:45.630> depth<00:01:45.990> will<00:01:46.170> be<00:01:46.290> a<00:01:46.320> significant

00:01:46.999 --> 00:01:47.009 
down a depth will be a significant

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.770 
down a depth will be a significant
amount<00:01:47.220> of<00:01:47.310> external<00:01:47.700> pressure<00:01:48.090> as<00:01:48.329> compared

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:48.780 
amount of external pressure as compared

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.630 
amount of external pressure as compared
to<00:01:48.840> the<00:01:48.990> one<00:01:49.590> atmosphere<00:01:49.770> pressure<00:01:50.280> that's

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:50.640 
to the one atmosphere pressure that's

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.990 
to the one atmosphere pressure that's
inside<00:01:51.000> the<00:01:51.180> tube<00:01:51.390> so<00:01:52.110> once<00:01:52.320> you're<00:01:52.500> in<00:01:52.530> a<00:01:52.649> dry

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:53.000 
inside the tube so once you're in a dry

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.020 
inside the tube so once you're in a dry
area<00:01:54.000> under<00:01:54.840> water<00:01:55.100> habitat<00:01:56.100> then<00:01:56.729> you<00:01:56.880> can

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
area under water habitat then you can

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.850 
area under water habitat then you can
loosen<00:01:57.329> this<00:01:57.479> screw<00:01:57.540> here<00:01:58.079> and<00:01:58.290> that

00:01:58.850 --> 00:01:58.860 
loosen this screw here and that

00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:01.819 
loosen this screw here and that
equalizes<00:01:59.610> the<00:01:59.640> pressure<00:01:59.790> and<00:02:00.329> you<00:02:01.259> can<00:02:01.290> then

00:02:01.819 --> 00:02:01.829 
equalizes the pressure and you can then

00:02:01.829 --> 00:02:03.950 
equalizes the pressure and you can then
get<00:02:02.219> the<00:02:02.340> lid<00:02:02.520> open<00:02:02.700> otherwise<00:02:03.270> that<00:02:03.689> depth

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
get the lid open otherwise that depth

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.300 
get the lid open otherwise that depth
you<00:02:04.380> wouldn't<00:02:04.649> really<00:02:04.740> have<00:02:04.890> any<00:02:05.040> chance

again<00:02:05.610> the<00:02:05.850> lid<00:02:06.450> offer<00:02:06.719> would<00:02:07.560> at<00:02:07.950> least<00:02:08.069> be

again the lid offer would at least be

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.100 
again the lid offer would at least be
quite<00:02:08.459> difficult<00:02:08.670> even<00:02:09.509> with<00:02:09.599> the<00:02:09.720> latches

quite difficult even with the latches
off<00:02:10.289> at<00:02:10.500> depth<00:02:10.709> there'd<00:02:10.950> be<00:02:11.039> enough<00:02:11.250> pressure

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520 
off at depth there'd be enough pressure

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:12.410 
off at depth there'd be enough pressure
