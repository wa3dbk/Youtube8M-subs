00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:19.260
 live some eat the little ones 

00:00:17.609 --> 00:00:20.970
 farmers today a new video 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:22.590
 of presentation and as you can 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.260
 notice there is not one but four 

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.090
 graphic cards available to you 

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:28.859
 so this is actually a folder the 

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:32.189
 folder is on graphics cards 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:35.010
 very entry-level it's shon in 

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:37.410
 tariffs from 52 to 70 euros 

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:40.260
 the interest was discover is that with 

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:44.670
 this type of graphics card we can play 

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:47.309
 currently of course by reducing the 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:51.440
 resolution is not sure of 2560 by 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:53.850
 1940 we will be more sure of 1680 by 1050 

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:55.559
 and saying some things 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:59.309
 graphic options but still 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:01:01.739
 can we achieve a minimum fluidity 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:04.920
 especially since you will have noticed 

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:06.930
 probably there are two amd cards so 

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.330
 which says amd card ten new drivers 

00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:11.400
 who says new drivers says api mentre 

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:13.680
 so what kind of cards 

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:16.470
 graphics take advantage of mundell and who 

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.509
 indulge in game we will start with 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.750
 the two graphic cards from 

00:01:18.509 --> 00:01:23.009
 nvidia 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:26.850
 the gt 630 and the gt640 then for the gt 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:29.820
 630 the tar heels and 52 euros for the 

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:32.729
 gt640 we are at 64 euros 

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:36.750
 both cards share the same gpu 

00:01:32.729 --> 00:01:38.909
 it's a jk 208 in 28 nanometers him 

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:42.409
 europe and 32 theme had for each of 

00:01:38.909 --> 00:01:45.240
 cards and 384 shaders 

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:48.210
 so after the difference is done on the 

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:51.479
 swimming memory and and 630 has a gigabyte 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:54.090
 ddr byte takes 1 64 bits while 

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:57.810
 the gt640 has a gigabyte of gddr5 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:02:00.840
 in 64 bits 

00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:03.299
 the gpu the gt 630 and 902 billion 

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:07.290
 while the ram is at 900 billion 

00:02:03.299 --> 00:02:07.960
 for the gt640 the gpu is at 1046 

00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:11.620
 billion 

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:12.190
 and the ram and 1253 inadvertently at the level 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.590
 cards 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:18.990
 we start with the gt 130 we find 

00:02:14.590 --> 00:02:22.000
 the classic releases dvi hdmi and vga 

00:02:18.990 --> 00:02:23.370
 the card does not require power 

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.160
 external 

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:30.370
 so it's a card with 2000 tcb it's 

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:31.780
 very small it consumes little it does not 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:35.350
 of noise because there is no 

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:38.110
 fan for the gt640 found 

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:40.150
 also outputs dvi hdmi and vga 

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:41.769
 we have a tiny fan it's 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:48.760
 very discreet we still do not need 

00:02:41.769 --> 00:02:52.480
 power connection again 

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:56.790
 unknowns on a half pcb now 

00:02:52.480 --> 00:03:00.390
 let's go to the offer at one of the with the r7 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:04.110
 240 that they are for 65 60 euros 

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:07.360
 while the r7 250 and at 70 euros 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:10.420
 both because when we ship gpu 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:17.470
 holland in 28 nanometers has life 

00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:20.680
 europe and 20 temu the r7 240 features 

00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:23.680
 320 hp while the r7 250 on 

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:27.000
 embeds 384 both cards have a 

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:31.329
 gigabyte of 128 bit gddr5 

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.959
 the gpu there the recipes of 140 and 780 

00:03:31.329 --> 00:03:34.450
 billion 

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:38.829
 the memory is put 150 billion 

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:42.000
 while the gpu the r7 250 and friend of 50 

00:03:38.829 --> 00:03:46.450
 billion and memory at 1150 billion 

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:48.910
 we will start with the fia it is about 

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:51.220
 the r7 250 

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:53.709
 so there we have a pc standards and it's 

00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:56.410
 very pretty with a fan no 

00:03:53.709 --> 00:03:57.790
 necessary power connection 

00:03:56.410 --> 00:04:01.329
 additional outputs 

00:03:57.790 --> 00:04:03.359
 video we are on the classic dvi hdmi 

00:04:01.329 --> 00:04:08.440
 vga 

00:04:03.359 --> 00:04:11.500
 we'll go to the hs hershey 240.7 his 

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:13.329
 classic and blue berries fat from 

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:16.859
 connection of the necessary power supply 

00:04:13.329 --> 00:04:18.449
 a pretty small fan 1 

00:04:16.859 --> 00:04:21.840
 Cooling system quite minimal 

00:04:18.449 --> 00:04:23.810
 in terms of the outputs we have a 

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:28.639
 output dvi output hdmi output 

00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:28.639
 vga and so that's it
