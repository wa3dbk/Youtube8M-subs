twisters three mr. Cole's gold ladybugs
are<00:03:52.019> time<00:03:52.849> and<00:03:53.849> basically<00:03:54.569> time<00:03:54.870> cards<00:03:55.349> I<00:03:55.530> took

00:03:56.390 --> 00:03:56.400 
are time and basically time cards I took

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.039 
are time and basically time cards I took
just<00:03:56.519> three<00:03:56.760> lava<00:03:57.060> golems<00:03:57.329> to<00:03:57.480> just<00:03:57.840> in<00:03:57.900> case

00:03:58.039 --> 00:03:58.049 
just three lava golems to just in case

00:03:58.049 --> 00:03:59.690 
just three lava golems to just in case
you're<00:03:58.200> wrong<00:03:58.319> tonight<00:03:58.500> the<00:03:58.739> random<00:03:59.190> the<00:03:59.489> same

00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700 
you're wrong tonight the random the same

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.819 
you're wrong tonight the random the same
right<00:03:59.910> metric<00:04:00.209> but<00:04:00.780> that's<00:04:01.349> it<00:04:01.560> for<00:04:01.739> the

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:01.829 
right metric but that's it for the

00:04:01.829 --> 00:04:03.920 
right metric but that's it for the
moment
