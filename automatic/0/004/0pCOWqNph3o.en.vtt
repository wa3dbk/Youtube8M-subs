maneuverability the way that the width

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.450 
maneuverability the way that the width

while<00:01:35.369> the<00:01:35.549> narrow<00:01:35.790> hanger<00:01:36.240> has<00:01:36.450> a<00:01:36.479> tighter

00:01:36.859 --> 00:01:36.869 
while the narrow hanger has a tighter

00:01:36.869 --> 00:01:38.990 
while the narrow hanger has a tighter
turning<00:01:37.259> radius<00:01:37.380> which<00:01:37.829> can<00:01:37.979> feel<00:01:38.220> very<00:01:38.490> agile

00:01:38.990 --> 00:01:39.000 
turning radius which can feel very agile

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.850 
turning radius which can feel very agile
but<00:01:39.329> it<00:01:39.509> does<00:01:39.689> feel<00:01:39.960> like<00:01:40.110> you<00:01:40.229> lose<00:01:40.380> a<00:01:40.439> little

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860 
but it does feel like you lose a little

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.679 
but it does feel like you lose a little
bit<00:01:40.979> of<00:01:41.189> stability<00:01:41.340> so<00:01:42.119> make<00:01:42.329> sure<00:01:42.360> you<00:01:42.600> have

00:01:42.679 --> 00:01:42.689 
bit of stability so make sure you have

00:01:42.689 --> 00:01:44.270 
bit of stability so make sure you have
your<00:01:42.899> width<00:01:43.140> according<00:01:43.770> to<00:01:43.860> the<00:01:44.009> width<00:01:44.159> of

well when you're looking at a
longboarding<00:02:26.470> truck<00:02:26.740> if<00:02:26.950> you<00:02:27.010> start<00:02:27.430> getting

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:27.700 
longboarding truck if you start getting

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:29.490 
longboarding truck if you start getting
into<00:02:27.910> the<00:02:27.940> lower<00:02:28.210> degrees<00:02:28.570> like<00:02:28.840> this<00:02:29.110> bear

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:29.500 
into the lower degrees like this bear

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.280 
into the lower degrees like this bear
840<00:02:30.220> which<00:02:30.400> is<00:02:30.550> a<00:02:30.580> 40<00:02:30.970> degree<00:02:31.090> truck<00:02:31.630> they<00:02:32.110> give

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:32.290 
840 which is a 40 degree truck they give

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:34.350 
840 which is a 40 degree truck they give
you<00:02:32.410> a<00:02:32.440> lot<00:02:32.950> of<00:02:32.980> stability<00:02:33.400> so<00:02:33.970> you<00:02:34.030> can<00:02:34.210> see

00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:34.360 
you a lot of stability so you can see

00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:36.420 
you a lot of stability so you can see
these<00:02:34.510> common<00:02:34.990> in<00:02:35.110> a<00:02:35.200> lot<00:02:35.380> of<00:02:35.410> downhill<00:02:35.740> racing

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:36.430 
these common in a lot of downhill racing

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:38.790 
these common in a lot of downhill racing
setups<00:02:36.880> so<00:02:37.630> what<00:02:37.780> you<00:02:37.930> get<00:02:38.110> by<00:02:38.290> changing<00:02:38.710> the

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:38.800 
setups so what you get by changing the

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.290 
setups so what you get by changing the
angle<00:02:38.830> of<00:02:39.250> your<00:02:39.310> truck<00:02:39.700> is<00:02:39.880> the<00:02:40.030> higher<00:02:40.270> the

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:40.300 
angle of your truck is the higher the

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:41.820 
angle of your truck is the higher the
angle<00:02:40.810> you<00:02:40.930> get<00:02:41.080> a<00:02:41.110> lot<00:02:41.290> more<00:02:41.320> turn<00:02:41.800> and

00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:41.830 
angle you get a lot more turn and

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:43.770 
angle you get a lot more turn and
responsiveness<00:02:42.550> and<00:02:42.880> when<00:02:43.420> you<00:02:43.480> go<00:02:43.600> with<00:02:43.690> a

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
responsiveness and when you go with a

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:46.370 
responsiveness and when you go with a
lower<00:02:44.080> angle<00:02:44.380> you<00:02:44.710> get<00:02:44.860> a<00:02:45.070> lot<00:02:45.400> of<00:02:45.640> stability

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:46.380 
lower angle you get a lot of stability

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:48.900 
lower angle you get a lot of stability
shown<00:02:47.380> here<00:02:47.710> in<00:02:47.830> the<00:02:47.920> iridescent<00:02:48.310> bear<00:02:48.640> trucks

00:02:48.900 --> 00:02:48.910 
shown here in the iridescent bear trucks

00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:50.580 
shown here in the iridescent bear trucks
they<00:02:49.120> come<00:02:49.360> with<00:02:49.540> what<00:02:49.720> they<00:02:49.870> call<00:02:50.050> rake<00:02:50.350> that

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590 
they come with what they call rake that

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:52.320 
they come with what they call rake that
is<00:02:50.740> the<00:02:50.860> way<00:02:50.950> that<00:02:51.100> the<00:02:51.220> axle<00:02:51.670> sits<00:02:51.970> in<00:02:52.150> line

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:52.330 
is the way that the axle sits in line

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:54.930 
is the way that the axle sits in line
with<00:02:52.540> the<00:02:52.630> pivot<00:02:52.900> cup<00:02:53.280> all<00:02:54.280> the<00:02:54.490> Bears<00:02:54.700> come

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:54.940 
with the pivot cup all the Bears come

00:02:54.940 --> 00:02:56.400 
with the pivot cup all the Bears come
with<00:02:55.030> a<00:02:55.090> positive<00:02:55.630> rake<00:02:55.780> and<00:02:55.960> what<00:02:56.050> this<00:02:56.200> does

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:56.410 
with a positive rake and what this does

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:57.900 
with a positive rake and what this does
is<00:02:56.590> it<00:02:56.710> gives<00:02:56.860> you<00:02:56.980> a<00:02:57.010> very<00:02:57.220> responsive<00:02:57.730> ride

00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:57.910 
is it gives you a very responsive ride

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:59.640 
is it gives you a very responsive ride
you<00:02:58.300> can<00:02:58.390> actually<00:02:58.540> flip<00:02:58.930> the<00:02:59.080> hanger<00:02:59.350> around

00:02:59.640 --> 00:02:59.650 
you can actually flip the hanger around

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:01.290 
you can actually flip the hanger around
giving<00:02:59.980> it<00:03:00.130> negative<00:03:00.640> rake<00:03:00.820> what<00:03:01.030> that<00:03:01.150> does

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:01.300 
giving it negative rake what that does

00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:03.450 
giving it negative rake what that does
is<00:03:01.420> makes<00:03:01.660> it<00:03:01.780> a<00:03:01.870> lot<00:03:01.960> less<00:03:02.020> agile<00:03:02.680> but<00:03:03.160> it<00:03:03.280> does
