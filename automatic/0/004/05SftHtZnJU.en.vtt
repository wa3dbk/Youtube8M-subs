conversation and questions that move

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.069 
conversation and questions that move
forward<00:00:38.100> from<00:00:38.250> that<00:00:38.280> and<00:00:39.270> one<00:00:39.719> thing<00:00:39.960> that's

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079 
forward from that and one thing that's

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:41.959 
forward from that and one thing that's
gotten<00:00:40.350> brought<00:00:40.680> up<00:00:40.950> is<00:00:41.160> direct-to-garment

00:00:41.959 --> 00:00:41.969 
gotten brought up is direct-to-garment

00:00:41.969 --> 00:00:43.910 
gotten brought up is direct-to-garment
printing<00:00:42.090> go<00:00:43.079> google<00:00:43.410> that<00:00:43.530> if<00:00:43.590> you<00:00:43.800> don't

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:43.920 
printing go google that if you don't

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:45.770 
printing go google that if you don't
know<00:00:44.129> what<00:00:44.309> it<00:00:44.399> is<00:00:44.550> but<00:00:45.360> basically

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:45.780 
know what it is but basically

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:49.220 
know what it is but basically
direct-to-garment<00:00:46.559> think<00:00:47.340> of<00:00:47.489> it<00:00:47.610> as<00:00:47.820> a<00:00:48.750> big

00:00:49.220 --> 00:00:49.230 
direct-to-garment think of it as a big

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:51.590 
direct-to-garment think of it as a big
printer<00:00:49.890> sort<00:00:50.460> of<00:00:50.520> like<00:00:50.670> like<00:00:51.000> your<00:00:51.210> your

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:51.600 
printer sort of like like your your

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:54.410 
printer sort of like like your your
paper<00:00:51.899> printing<00:00:52.440> like<00:00:52.620> a<00:00:52.649> printer<00:00:53.039> and<00:00:53.420> you

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:54.420 
paper printing like a printer and you

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.319 
paper printing like a printer and you
feed<00:00:54.870> the<00:00:55.500> shirt<00:00:55.770> into<00:00:56.039> it<00:00:56.340> and<00:00:56.550> it<00:00:56.820> it

00:00:57.319 --> 00:00:57.329 
feed the shirt into it and it it

00:00:57.329 --> 00:01:00.410 
feed the shirt into it and it it
basically<00:00:58.340> there's<00:00:59.340> a<00:00:59.430> mechanism<00:00:59.670> where<00:01:00.210> I

00:01:00.410 --> 00:01:00.420 
basically there's a mechanism where I

00:01:00.420 --> 00:01:01.970 
basically there's a mechanism where I
believe<00:01:00.750> it's<00:01:00.960> the<00:01:01.199> paint<00:01:01.469> is<00:01:01.620> actually

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:01.980 
believe it's the paint is actually

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:02.750 
believe it's the paint is actually
spraying

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760 
spraying

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.000 
spraying
onto<00:01:03.480> the<00:01:03.600> shirt<00:01:03.870> the<00:01:04.260> effect<00:01:04.680> of<00:01:04.860> it

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:05.010 
onto the shirt the effect of it

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.969 
onto the shirt the effect of it
sometimes<00:01:06.000> actually<00:01:06.869> looks<00:01:07.110> very<00:01:07.590> close<00:01:07.830> to

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
sometimes actually looks very close to

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:10.640 
sometimes actually looks very close to
sublimation<00:01:08.720> printing<00:01:09.720> and<00:01:09.960> so<00:01:10.260> it's

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:10.650 
sublimation printing and so it's

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:12.800 
sublimation printing and so it's
definitely<00:01:11.100> a<00:01:11.189> different<00:01:11.610> process<00:01:12.150> it's<00:01:12.659> very

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:12.810 
definitely a different process it's very

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:14.600 
definitely a different process it's very
different<00:01:13.500> from<00:01:13.740> the<00:01:13.830> traditional<00:01:14.430> process

00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:14.610 
different from the traditional process

00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:17.210 
different from the traditional process
of<00:01:14.909> screen<00:01:15.659> printing<00:01:16.110> where<00:01:16.290> you<00:01:16.409> burn<00:01:16.890> film

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:17.220 
of screen printing where you burn film

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.240 
of screen printing where you burn film
and<00:01:17.670> screens<00:01:18.420> with<00:01:18.750> emulsion<00:01:19.320> and<00:01:19.799> in<00:01:20.009> a<00:01:20.130> very

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.250 
and screens with emulsion and in a very

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:22.460 
and screens with emulsion and in a very
traditional<00:01:20.460> way<00:01:20.850> so<00:01:21.479> I<00:01:21.720> have<00:01:21.960> a<00:01:21.990> lot<00:01:22.170> of<00:01:22.259> pros

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
traditional way so I have a lot of pros

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.039 
traditional way so I have a lot of pros
and<00:01:22.680> cons<00:01:22.920> that<00:01:23.070> go<00:01:23.250> with<00:01:23.400> DTG<00:01:24.119> now<00:01:24.659> let<00:01:24.990> me

three<00:01:35.159> DTG<00:01:36.090> machines<00:01:36.509> they<00:01:36.900> were<00:01:36.960> brother

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:37.290 
three DTG machines they were brother

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:39.679 
three DTG machines they were brother
machines<00:01:37.890> I<00:01:38.040> believe<00:01:38.340> and<00:01:38.579> so<00:01:39.119> that<00:01:39.360> was<00:01:39.479> one

00:01:39.679 --> 00:01:39.689 
machines I believe and so that was one

00:01:39.689 --> 00:01:41.270 
machines I believe and so that was one
segment<00:01:39.960> of<00:01:40.200> the<00:01:40.290> business<00:01:40.680> that<00:01:40.710> we<00:01:41.100> were

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060 
you can't do with traditional screen

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.149

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.819 
printing and you can do it quickly like
you<00:01:50.700> can<00:01:50.850> literally<00:01:51.119> have<00:01:51.450> an<00:01:51.600> idea<00:01:51.930> produce

00:01:52.819 --> 00:01:52.829 
you can literally have an idea produce

00:01:52.829 --> 00:01:54.830 
you can literally have an idea produce
the<00:01:52.979> graphic<00:01:53.460> once<00:01:53.820> you<00:01:53.909> have<00:01:54.060> it<00:01:54.180> correctly

00:01:54.830 --> 00:01:54.840 
the graphic once you have it correctly

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.440 
the graphic once you have it correctly
formatted<00:01:55.380> for<00:01:55.649> the<00:01:55.740> DTG<00:01:56.280> printer<00:01:56.729> then<00:01:57.329> you

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:57.450 
formatted for the DTG printer then you

00:01:57.450 --> 00:01:59.690 
formatted for the DTG printer then you
can<00:01:57.600> feed<00:01:57.840> it<00:01:57.869> in<00:01:58.140> let<00:01:59.070> it<00:01:59.100> do<00:01:59.310> its<00:01:59.340> thing<00:01:59.520> and

00:01:59.690 --> 00:01:59.700 
can feed it in let it do its thing and

00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:01.520 
can feed it in let it do its thing and
it<00:02:00.060> comes<00:02:00.270> out<00:02:00.450> with<00:02:00.810> with<00:02:01.110> the<00:02:01.229> t-shirt

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:01.530 
it comes out with with the t-shirt

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.469 
it comes out with with the t-shirt
design<00:02:01.770> it's<00:02:01.979> like<00:02:02.100> Easy<00:02:02.399> Bake<00:02:02.700> Oven<00:02:02.909> for

00:02:06.709 --> 00:02:06.719 
cool things like obviously you could do

00:02:06.719 --> 00:02:09.320 
cool things like obviously you could do
multiple<00:02:07.020> colors<00:02:07.829> and<00:02:08.069> you<00:02:08.789> don't<00:02:08.970> have<00:02:09.179> the

some of the pros of it is there there's
a<00:02:21.420> lot<00:02:21.599> more<00:02:21.720> freedom<00:02:22.019> with<00:02:22.980> what<00:02:23.730> you<00:02:23.879> can<00:02:24.030> do

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:24.150 
a lot more freedom with what you can do

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.540 
a lot more freedom with what you can do
with<00:02:24.330> the<00:02:24.420> design<00:02:24.780> and<00:02:25.250> specifically<00:02:26.250> in<00:02:26.430> that

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:26.550 
with the design and specifically in that

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:27.949 
with the design and specifically in that
you<00:02:26.700> can<00:02:26.819> use<00:02:26.970> a<00:02:27.000> lot<00:02:27.209> of<00:02:27.239> colors<00:02:27.599> you<00:02:27.810> could

00:02:27.949 --> 00:02:27.959 
you can use a lot of colors you could

00:02:27.959 --> 00:02:29.900 
you can use a lot of colors you could
use<00:02:28.080> portrait<00:02:28.590> type<00:02:28.800> things<00:02:29.129> now<00:02:29.610> there's<00:02:29.819> a

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:29.910 
use portrait type things now there's a

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:31.880 
use portrait type things now there's a
little<00:02:30.150> bit<00:02:30.269> of<00:02:30.390> testing<00:02:30.629> that<00:02:31.140> we<00:02:31.349> did<00:02:31.590> you

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:31.890 
little bit of testing that we did you

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:34.250 
little bit of testing that we did you
know<00:02:31.980> obviously<00:02:32.400> white<00:02:32.730> shirts<00:02:33.060> come<00:02:33.810> out<00:02:33.989> a

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:34.260 
know obviously white shirts come out a

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:36.199 
know obviously white shirts come out a
little<00:02:34.590> less<00:02:34.890> money<00:02:35.160> than<00:02:35.340> black<00:02:35.580> shirts<00:02:35.910> and

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:36.209 
little less money than black shirts and

00:02:36.209 --> 00:02:37.970 
little less money than black shirts and
so<00:02:36.599> you<00:02:36.690> there's<00:02:37.019> a<00:02:37.080> fair<00:02:37.319> amount<00:02:37.530> of<00:02:37.590> testing

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 
so you there's a fair amount of testing

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:39.830 
so you there's a fair amount of testing
that<00:02:38.099> needs<00:02:38.160> to<00:02:38.400> be<00:02:38.430> done<00:02:38.760> now

00:02:39.830 --> 00:02:39.840 
that needs to be done now

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.440 
that needs to be done now
I<00:02:39.870> still<00:02:40.470> say<00:02:40.860> and<00:02:41.129> this<00:02:41.280> is<00:02:41.400> what<00:02:41.580> I<00:02:41.610> told<00:02:41.700> RJ

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:42.450 
I still say and this is what I told RJ

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.259 
I still say and this is what I told RJ
is<00:02:42.660> that<00:02:43.260> it's<00:02:43.620> a<00:02:43.769> bad<00:02:44.010> idea<00:02:44.040> for<00:02:44.549> mass

00:02:45.259 --> 00:02:45.269 
is that it's a bad idea for mass

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:47.030 
is that it's a bad idea for mass
production<00:02:45.750> of<00:02:46.110> your<00:02:46.230> clothing<00:02:46.500> line

00:02:47.030 --> 00:02:47.040 
production of your clothing line

00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:49.069 
production of your clothing line
I<00:02:47.069> think<00:02:47.430> it's<00:02:47.549> cool<00:02:47.790> to<00:02:48.120> have<00:02:48.329> to<00:02:48.660> maybe<00:02:48.840> do

00:02:49.069 --> 00:02:49.079 
I think it's cool to have to maybe do

00:02:49.079 --> 00:02:51.500 
I think it's cool to have to maybe do
one<00:02:49.319> ops<00:02:49.500> or<00:02:49.950> if<00:02:50.519> you're<00:02:50.670> doing<00:02:50.849> a<00:02:51.120> brand

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:51.510 
one ops or if you're doing a brand

00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.780 
one ops or if you're doing a brand
that's<00:02:51.780> like<00:02:51.959> a<00:02:51.989> 5%<00:02:52.470> brand<00:02:52.920> like<00:02:53.160> a<00:02:53.310> true

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790 
that's like a 5% brand like a true

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.880 
that's like a 5% brand like a true
designer<00:02:54.150> brand<00:02:54.540> where<00:02:54.900> you<00:02:55.620> don't<00:02:55.799> care

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:55.890 
designer brand where you don't care

00:02:55.890 --> 00:02:57.740 
designer brand where you don't care
about<00:02:56.190> mass<00:02:56.549> production<00:02:57.060> and<00:02:57.180> it's<00:02:57.420> more

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
about mass production and it's more

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.319 
about mass production and it's more
approaching<00:02:58.620> your<00:02:59.040> brand<00:02:59.340> from<00:02:59.489> more<00:03:00.120> of<00:03:00.209> an

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:00.329 
approaching your brand from more of an

00:03:00.329 --> 00:03:02.990 
approaching your brand from more of an
artistic<00:03:01.280> exclusive<00:03:02.280> level<00:03:02.640> you're<00:03:02.790> doing

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:03.000 
artistic exclusive level you're doing

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.479 
artistic exclusive level you're doing
high<00:03:03.209> price<00:03:03.720> point<00:03:03.860> where<00:03:04.860> volume<00:03:05.280> doesn't

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489 
high price point where volume doesn't

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:07.400 
high price point where volume doesn't
matter<00:03:05.790> you're<00:03:06.030> trying<00:03:06.239> to<00:03:06.299> put<00:03:06.480> out<00:03:06.599> 10

matter you're trying to put out 10
shirts<00:03:07.829> of<00:03:08.069> a<00:03:08.370> design<00:03:08.760> that's<00:03:09.690> where<00:03:10.019> this<00:03:10.290> can

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:11.090 
shirts of a design that's where this can

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:13.910 
shirts of a design that's where this can
actually<00:03:12.090> make<00:03:12.420> sense<00:03:12.750> and<00:03:13.110> then<00:03:13.590> maybe

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:13.920 
actually make sense and then maybe

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:18.410 
actually make sense and then maybe
payoff<00:03:14.489> but<00:03:15.470> the<00:03:16.470> biggest<00:03:16.890> con<00:03:17.430> is<00:03:17.790> that<00:03:17.850> you

00:03:18.410 --> 00:03:18.420 
payoff but the biggest con is that you

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:21.620 
payoff but the biggest con is that you
cannot<00:03:18.810> reproduce<00:03:19.380> the<00:03:19.889> graphic<00:03:20.430> on<00:03:21.120> a<00:03:21.180> mass

cannot reproduce the graphic on a mass

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:23.660 
cannot reproduce the graphic on a mass
quantity<00:03:22.319> level<00:03:22.680> at<00:03:22.920> all<00:03:22.950> I<00:03:23.130> mean<00:03:23.310> you<00:03:23.549> don't

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:23.670 
quantity level at all I mean you don't

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:27.559 
quantity level at all I mean you don't

00:03:58.670 --> 00:03:58.680 
to be a pain in the ass basically to to

00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:00.050 
to be a pain in the ass basically to to
get<00:03:58.859> through<00:03:59.040> also<00:03:59.250> if<00:03:59.760> you're<00:03:59.940> doing

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:00.060 
get through also if you're doing

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:01.490 
get through also if you're doing
something<00:04:00.419> simple<00:04:00.630> like<00:04:00.840> one<00:04:01.049> two<00:04:01.260> color

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:01.500 
something simple like one two color

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:03.920 
something simple like one two color
shirts<00:04:02.310> I<00:04:02.639> still<00:04:03.209> just<00:04:03.239> think<00:04:03.510> screen

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:03.930 
shirts I still just think screen

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:05.750 
shirts I still just think screen
printing<00:04:04.290> is<00:04:04.410> a<00:04:04.440> lot<00:04:04.769> more<00:04:05.040> efficient<00:04:05.609> and

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:05.760 
printing is a lot more efficient and

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.870 
printing is a lot more efficient and
easier<00:04:06.540> to<00:04:06.599> manage<00:04:06.870> that<00:04:07.560> DTG<00:04:08.160> and<00:04:08.370> I<00:04:08.459> just

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:08.880 
easier to manage that DTG and I just

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:10.610 
easier to manage that DTG and I just
can't<00:04:09.090> see<00:04:09.239> putting<00:04:09.480> that<00:04:09.660> much<00:04:09.930> mileage<00:04:10.349> on<00:04:10.560> a

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620 
can't see putting that much mileage on a

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:13.069 
can't see putting that much mileage on a
DTG<00:04:11.519> machine<00:04:11.910> and<00:04:12.389> that's<00:04:12.569> my<00:04:12.690> take<00:04:12.870> on<00:04:13.019> it

00:04:13.069 --> 00:04:13.079 
DTG machine and that's my take on it

00:04:13.079 --> 00:04:15.920 
DTG machine and that's my take on it
really<00:04:13.500> it's<00:04:13.919> really<00:04:14.069> cool<00:04:14.730> again<00:04:15.599> to<00:04:15.780> do

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:15.930 
really it's really cool again to do

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:17.839 
really it's really cool again to do
really<00:04:16.260> more<00:04:16.470> elaborate<00:04:16.889> designs<00:04:17.190> that<00:04:17.639> you

00:04:17.839 --> 00:04:17.849 
really more elaborate designs that you

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:19.159 
really more elaborate designs that you
wouldn't<00:04:18.090> have<00:04:18.209> the<00:04:18.329> freedom<00:04:18.630> to<00:04:18.660> do<00:04:18.900> in<00:04:19.079> the

00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:19.169 
wouldn't have the freedom to do in the

00:04:19.169 --> 00:04:20.990 
wouldn't have the freedom to do in the
screen<00:04:19.440> printing<00:04:19.739> and<00:04:19.889> you<00:04:20.039> can<00:04:20.220> literally

00:04:20.990 --> 00:04:21.000 
screen printing and you can literally

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.089 
screen printing and you can literally
have<00:04:21.299> it<00:04:21.450> done<00:04:21.690> in<00:04:21.959> a<00:04:22.409> matter<00:04:22.650> of<00:04:22.770> minutes

00:04:23.089 --> 00:04:23.099 
have it done in a matter of minutes

00:04:23.099 --> 00:04:26.730 
have it done in a matter of minutes
which<00:04:23.760> is<00:04:23.940> very<00:04:24.210> cool<00:04:24.570> so<00:04:25.200> in<00:04:25.680> my<00:04:25.800> a<00:04:25.830> fan<00:04:26.099> of<00:04:26.250> DTG

00:04:26.730 --> 00:04:26.740 
which is very cool so in my a fan of DTG

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:28.890 
which is very cool so in my a fan of DTG
absolutely<00:04:27.520> annoyed<00:04:27.849> they<00:04:27.970> get<00:04:28.120> smart<00:04:28.479> for

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:28.900 
absolutely annoyed they get smart for

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:31.950 
absolutely annoyed they get smart for
clothing<00:04:29.530> lines<00:04:29.889> to<00:04:30.639> make<00:04:30.910> mass<00:04:31.360> production
