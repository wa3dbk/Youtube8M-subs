QuickStart guide which is also in the
box<00:01:06.810> just<00:01:06.930> to<00:01:07.290> make<00:01:07.710> sure<00:01:07.740> so<00:01:08.189> here's<00:01:08.369> the<00:01:08.460> unit

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:08.640 
box just to make sure so here's the unit

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:11.929 
box just to make sure so here's the unit
bigger<00:01:09.180> than<00:01:09.390> a<00:01:09.540> Garmin<00:01:10.260> Edge<00:01:10.430> 800<00:01:11.430> but<00:01:11.610> not

00:01:11.929 --> 00:01:11.939 
bigger than a Garmin Edge 800 but not

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:14.660 
bigger than a Garmin Edge 800 but not
massively<00:01:12.390> so<00:01:12.659> it<00:01:12.750> is<00:01:12.869> mobile<00:01:13.140> phone<00:01:13.560> size<00:01:13.860> so

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:14.670 
massively so it is mobile phone size so

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:18.530 
massively so it is mobile phone size so
that<00:01:15.020> should<00:01:16.020> mean<00:01:16.229> nice<00:01:16.439> clear<00:01:17.210> data<00:01:18.210> and

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540 
that should mean nice clear data and

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:19.820 
that should mean nice clear data and
information<00:01:18.869> on<00:01:19.140> the<00:01:19.229> screen<00:01:19.530> when<00:01:19.710> you're

information on the screen when you're

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.740 
information on the screen when you're
actually<00:01:19.920> riding<00:01:20.280> we<00:01:21.180> won't<00:01:21.360> turn<00:01:21.509> it<00:01:21.659> on

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:21.750 
actually riding we won't turn it on

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:23.060 
actually riding we won't turn it on
because<00:01:21.840> usually<00:01:22.049> leaves<00:01:22.409> have<00:01:22.710> to<00:01:22.830> charge

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
because usually leaves have to charge

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:24.920
