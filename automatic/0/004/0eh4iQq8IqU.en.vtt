280 as a rolling average but we wanted

280 as a rolling average but we wanted
to<00:00:36.879> reduce<00:00:37.030> clinical<00:00:37.690> cases<00:00:37.900> and<00:00:38.640> over<00:00:39.640> the<00:00:39.760> 18

months that we've been doing it we're
very<00:00:42.220> close<00:00:42.610> to<00:00:42.879> now<00:00:43.059> to<00:00:43.120> having<00:00:43.540> a<00:00:43.600> 50%

very close to now to having a 50%
reduction<00:00:44.409> in<00:00:44.769> clinical<00:00:45.400> cases<00:00:45.640> and<00:00:46.269> we're

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:46.720 
reduction in clinical cases and we're

00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:49.229 
reduction in clinical cases and we're
also<00:00:46.839> seeing<00:00:47.320> cell<00:00:47.650> counts<00:00:48.070> around<00:00:48.190> 110<00:00:49.030> as<00:00:49.210> a

also seeing cell counts around 110 as a

rolling average as opposed to the 170 we

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:55.380 
rolling average as opposed to the 170 we
had<00:00:52.000> before<00:00:52.860> one<00:00:53.860> of<00:00:54.010> the<00:00:54.070> benefits<00:00:54.699> we<00:00:55.000> found

had before one of the benefits we found

00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:57.719 
had before one of the benefits we found
with<00:00:55.780> the<00:00:55.930> ADF<00:00:56.409> was<00:00:56.890> not<00:00:57.430> that<00:00:57.580> we've

00:00:57.719 --> 00:00:57.729 
with the ADF was not that we've

00:00:57.729 --> 00:00:59.609 
with the ADF was not that we've
shortened<00:00:58.390> milking<00:00:58.780> time<00:00:59.019> but<00:00:59.320> we've<00:00:59.470> been

00:00:59.609 --> 00:00:59.619 
shortened milking time but we've been

00:00:59.619 --> 00:01:02.100 
shortened milking time but we've been
more<00:00:59.830> effective<00:01:00.100> and<00:01:00.640> we've<00:01:01.629> been<00:01:01.809> able<00:01:01.989> to

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:02.110 
more effective and we've been able to

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:05.160 
more effective and we've been able to
improve<00:01:02.589> the<00:01:02.890> routine<00:01:03.369> because<00:01:04.150> of<00:01:04.299> that<00:01:04.449> so

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:05.170 
improve the routine because of that so

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:07.889 
improve the routine because of that so
the<00:01:05.290> time<00:01:05.590> that<00:01:05.830> was<00:01:06.010> saved<00:01:06.369> from<00:01:06.880> moving<00:01:07.659> away

00:01:07.889 --> 00:01:07.899 
the time that was saved from moving away

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:11.370 
the time that was saved from moving away
from<00:01:08.140> post<00:01:09.070> dipping<00:01:09.490> manually<00:01:10.000> to<00:01:10.930> the<00:01:10.960> ADF

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:11.380 
from post dipping manually to the ADF

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:15.359 
from post dipping manually to the ADF
system<00:01:11.890> we've<00:01:12.100> reinvested<00:01:12.909> into<00:01:14.009> post<00:01:15.009> pre

00:01:15.359 --> 00:01:15.369 
system we've reinvested into post pre

00:01:15.369 --> 00:01:18.690 
system we've reinvested into post pre
dipping<00:01:15.960> so<00:01:16.960> that<00:01:17.109> we<00:01:17.229> now<00:01:17.380> foam<00:01:17.859> pre<00:01:18.250> dip<00:01:18.460> and

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:18.700 
dipping so that we now foam pre dip and

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.569 
dipping so that we now foam pre dip and
wipe<00:01:18.880> so<00:01:19.719> a<00:01:19.750> tee<00:01:20.079> condition<00:01:20.649> going<00:01:20.950> with<00:01:21.490> the

00:01:21.569 --> 00:01:21.579 
wipe so a tee condition going with the

00:01:21.579 --> 00:01:23.999 
wipe so a tee condition going with the
clusters<00:01:21.909> going<00:01:22.210> on<00:01:22.390> is<00:01:22.600> far<00:01:22.990> better<00:01:23.200> than<00:01:23.950> it

00:01:23.999 --> 00:01:24.009 
clusters going on is far better than it

00:01:24.009 --> 00:01:26.279 
clusters going on is far better than it
was<00:01:24.219> before<00:01:24.600> t<00:01:25.600> condition<00:01:26.140> has<00:01:26.259> improved

00:01:26.279 --> 00:01:26.289 
was before t condition has improved

00:01:26.289 --> 00:01:28.590 
was before t condition has improved
enormously<00:01:27.070> which<00:01:27.850> is<00:01:28.000> obviously<00:01:28.299> helped

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:28.600 
enormously which is obviously helped

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:30.929 
enormously which is obviously helped
keep<00:01:28.840> infection<00:01:29.530> rates<00:01:29.770> down<00:01:30.100> and<00:01:30.159> bacterial

00:01:30.929 --> 00:01:30.939 
keep infection rates down and bacterial

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:34.139 
keep infection rates down and bacterial
load<00:01:31.119> on<00:01:31.359> the<00:01:31.450> teats<00:01:31.719> down<00:01:32.049> as<00:01:32.320> well<00:01:32.969> so<00:01:33.969> we've

00:01:34.139 --> 00:01:34.149 
load on the teats down as well so we've

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:37.440 
load on the teats down as well so we've
reinvested<00:01:34.960> the<00:01:35.079> time<00:01:35.320> that<00:01:35.590> we've<00:01:35.740> saved<00:01:36.450> -

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:37.450 
reinvested the time that we've saved -

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:40.260 
reinvested the time that we've saved -
overall<00:01:37.749> get<00:01:38.020> a<00:01:38.049> better<00:01:38.229> result<00:01:39.270> the

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.270 
overall get a better result the

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:43.639 
overall get a better result the
installation<00:01:41.020> of<00:01:41.200> the<00:01:41.799> ADF<00:01:42.100> system<00:01:42.939> was<00:01:43.119> done

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
installation of the ADF system was done

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.020 
installation of the ADF system was done
literally<00:01:44.649> over<00:01:45.069> two<00:01:45.399> milkings

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:46.030 
literally over two milkings

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:49.380 
literally over two milkings
and<00:01:47.189> no<00:01:48.189> hitches<00:01:48.399> at<00:01:48.640> all<00:01:48.850> we<00:01:48.969> were<00:01:49.090> milking

00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:49.390 
and no hitches at all we were milking

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:51.989 
and no hitches at all we were milking
three<00:01:49.630> times<00:01:49.869> a<00:01:50.109> day<00:01:50.289> and<00:01:50.819> it<00:01:51.819> was

00:01:51.989 --> 00:01:51.999 
three times a day and it was

00:01:51.999 --> 00:01:54.359 
three times a day and it was
commissioned<00:01:52.569> during<00:01:52.840> the<00:01:53.649> afternoon

00:01:54.359 --> 00:01:54.369 
commissioned during the afternoon

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:56.309 
commissioned during the afternoon
milking<00:01:54.759> of<00:01:54.850> the<00:01:54.909> second<00:01:55.270> day<00:01:55.420> very<00:01:55.990> smoothly

00:01:56.309 --> 00:01:56.319 
milking of the second day very smoothly

00:01:56.319 --> 00:02:03.239 
milking of the second day very smoothly
no<00:01:56.679> problems<00:01:58.319> we<00:02:00.569> we<00:02:01.569> are<00:02:01.780> having<00:02:02.439> periods<00:02:03.039> now

00:02:03.239 --> 00:02:03.249 
no problems we we are having periods now

00:02:03.249 --> 00:02:05.639 
no problems we we are having periods now
where<00:02:03.520> there<00:02:03.670> are<00:02:03.789> no<00:02:03.999> mastitis<00:02:04.630> cases<00:02:05.350> for

00:02:05.639 --> 00:02:05.649 
where there are no mastitis cases for

00:02:05.649 --> 00:02:08.070 
where there are no mastitis cases for
several<00:02:06.069> weeks<00:02:06.630> at<00:02:07.630> a<00:02:07.689> time

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:08.080 
several weeks at a time

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.919 
several weeks at a time
which<00:02:08.590> clearly<00:02:08.860> reduces<00:02:09.610> the<00:02:09.910> stress<00:02:10.690> on

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:10.929 
which clearly reduces the stress on

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:13.020 
which clearly reduces the stress on
actually<00:02:11.560> having<00:02:11.650> to<00:02:11.890> handle

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030 
actually having to handle

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.420 
actually having to handle
cows<00:02:13.510> separately<00:02:14.230> and<00:02:14.560> getting<00:02:15.340> the

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:15.430 
cows separately and getting the

00:02:15.430 --> 00:02:16.800 
cows separately and getting the
treatments<00:02:15.910> right<00:02:16.120> so<00:02:16.540> we're<00:02:16.690> actually

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:16.810 
treatments right so we're actually

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:19.560 
treatments right so we're actually
reducing<00:02:17.700> the<00:02:18.700> stress<00:02:18.940> on<00:02:19.090> the<00:02:19.150> operator

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:19.570 
reducing the stress on the operator

reducing the stress on the operator
little<00:02:19.900> bit<00:02:20.050> we're<00:02:20.200> also<00:02:20.500> reducing<00:02:20.950> the<00:02:21.040> risk

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:21.750 
little bit we're also reducing the risk

00:02:21.750 --> 00:02:24.210 
little bit we're also reducing the risk
because<00:02:22.750> we've<00:02:23.110> got<00:02:23.260> less<00:02:23.440> antibiotic<00:02:24.040> usage

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.220 
because we've got less antibiotic usage

who<00:02:24.670> got<00:02:24.820> less<00:02:25.030> cows<00:02:25.300> I<00:02:25.600> mean<00:02:25.780> to<00:02:25.870> be

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:25.960 
who got less cows I mean to be

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:32.310 
who got less cows I mean to be

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:32.320 
segregated and less milk film I like a

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:33.840 
segregated and less milk film I like a
lot<00:02:32.530> of<00:02:32.650> farmers<00:02:33.100> was<00:02:33.310> probably<00:02:33.610> a<00:02:33.700> bit

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:33.850 
lot of farmers was probably a bit

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:36.330 
lot of farmers was probably a bit
skeptical<00:02:34.480> that<00:02:34.510> the<00:02:34.840> claimed<00:02:35.230> savings<00:02:36.010> that

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:36.340 
skeptical that the claimed savings that

00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:39.270 
skeptical that the claimed savings that
that<00:02:36.670> James<00:02:36.940> and<00:02:37.180> his<00:02:37.270> team<00:02:37.800> actually<00:02:38.800> make

00:02:39.270 --> 00:02:39.280 
that James and his team actually make

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:43.770 
that James and his team actually make
would<00:02:40.030> be<00:02:40.270> delivered<00:02:41.490> but<00:02:42.490> having<00:02:42.820> put<00:02:43.090> my<00:02:43.630> own

00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:43.780 
would be delivered but having put my own

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:47.970 
would be delivered but having put my own
figures<00:02:44.140> against<00:02:44.620> it<00:02:44.800> I<00:02:45.340> actually<00:02:45.940> think<00:02:46.980> it

00:02:47.970 --> 00:02:47.980 
figures against it I actually think it

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.790 
figures against it I actually think it
does<00:02:48.220> work<00:02:48.400> to<00:02:48.670> what<00:02:49.600> was<00:02:49.750> suggested<00:02:50.170> when<00:02:50.709> we

00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:50.800 
does work to what was suggested when we

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:54.540 
does work to what was suggested when we
started<00:02:51.220> I<00:02:52.410> don't<00:02:53.410> think<00:02:53.590> there's<00:02:53.740> one<00:02:53.770> single

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:54.550 
started I don't think there's one single

00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:57.090 
started I don't think there's one single
benefit<00:02:55.030> I<00:02:55.300> think<00:02:55.630> it's<00:02:56.170> a<00:02:56.290> combination<00:02:56.530> of

00:02:57.090 --> 00:02:57.100 
benefit I think it's a combination of

00:02:57.100 --> 00:03:01.530 
benefit I think it's a combination of
things<00:02:58.230> it's<00:02:59.230> made<00:02:59.590> milking<00:03:00.520> routines<00:03:00.970> more

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:01.540 
things it's made milking routines more

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:04.680 
things it's made milking routines more
consistent<00:03:02.610> we<00:03:03.610> have<00:03:03.760> different<00:03:04.150> milkers<00:03:04.510> in

00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:04.690 
consistent we have different milkers in

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:07.170 
consistent we have different milkers in
at<00:03:04.810> different<00:03:04.959> times<00:03:05.170> of<00:03:05.530> the<00:03:05.650> week<00:03:06.060> but<00:03:07.060> at

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:07.180 
at different times of the week but at

00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:09.000 
at different times of the week but at
least<00:03:07.300> you<00:03:07.510> know<00:03:07.540> that<00:03:07.959> that<00:03:08.110> process<00:03:08.350> is<00:03:08.620> done

00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.010 
least you know that that process is done

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:11.070 
least you know that that process is done
the<00:03:09.190> same<00:03:09.430> each<00:03:10.000> milking<00:03:10.360> because<00:03:10.930> it's

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:11.080 
the same each milking because it's

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:12.570 
the same each milking because it's
automated

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:12.580 
automated

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:16.050 
automated
and<00:03:12.940> I<00:03:13.209> think<00:03:13.620> combine<00:03:14.620> that<00:03:14.980> with<00:03:15.060> the

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:16.060 
and I think combine that with the

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:18.509 
and I think combine that with the
improvement<00:03:16.780> in<00:03:16.989> in<00:03:17.230> the<00:03:17.590> other<00:03:17.830> health<00:03:18.190> the

00:03:18.509 --> 00:03:18.519 
improvement in in the other health the

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:21.270 
improvement in in the other health the
tea<00:03:18.700> condition<00:03:19.390> overall<00:03:20.290> cow<00:03:20.590> health<00:03:20.920> I<00:03:21.220> think

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 
tea condition overall cow health I think

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:24.420 
tea condition overall cow health I think
the<00:03:21.489> combination<00:03:21.730> of<00:03:22.420> all<00:03:22.690> those<00:03:22.870> things<00:03:23.430> is

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:24.430 
the combination of all those things is

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:28.920 
the combination of all those things is
what<00:03:24.790> ADF<00:03:25.180> has<00:03:25.360> helped<00:03:25.660> us<00:03:25.870> to<00:03:26.769> achieve<00:03:27.870> now<00:03:28.870> we

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:28.930 
what ADF has helped us to achieve now we

00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:33.180 
what ADF has helped us to achieve now we
with<00:03:29.350> we<00:03:29.830> found<00:03:30.130> ADF<00:03:30.640> to<00:03:30.850> be<00:03:31.350> beneficial<00:03:32.350> it's

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:33.190 
with we found ADF to be beneficial it's

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:36.360 
with we found ADF to be beneficial it's
only<00:03:33.400> one<00:03:33.670> of<00:03:33.790> the<00:03:33.880> things<00:03:34.560> as<00:03:35.560> part<00:03:35.920> of<00:03:36.100> the

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:36.370 
only one of the things as part of the

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:38.790 
only one of the things as part of the
day-to-day<00:03:36.730> routines<00:03:37.540> but<00:03:38.140> it's<00:03:38.290> become<00:03:38.680> an

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:38.800 
day-to-day routines but it's become an

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:42.240 
day-to-day routines but it's become an
important<00:03:39.280> part<00:03:39.340> and<00:03:39.870> I<00:03:40.870> think<00:03:41.100> people<00:03:42.100> should

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:42.250 
important part and I think people should

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:43.920 
important part and I think people should
look<00:03:42.550> at<00:03:42.730> it<00:03:42.820> very<00:03:42.940> seriously<00:03:43.540> and<00:03:43.660> I<00:03:43.780> would

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:43.930 
look at it very seriously and I would

00:03:43.930 --> 00:03:47.580 
look at it very seriously and I would
recommend<00:03:44.110> that<00:03:45.040> they<00:03:45.190> do<00:03:45.340> so
