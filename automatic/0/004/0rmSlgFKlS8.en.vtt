 when lifting the mask and move it 

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:06.580
 center of gravity is down which is significantly 

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:10.119
 reduces fatigue of the head and neck of the welder 

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:12.070
 and increases the comfort of the work process length

 mechanical damage as 

00:01:29.680 --> 00:01:33.280
 power supply mask uses 

00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:34.780
 high performance photovoltaics as well 

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.670
