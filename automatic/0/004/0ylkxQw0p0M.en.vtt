00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:50.250 

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.759 

see<00:00:50.730> if<00:00:50.850> I<00:00:50.910> can<00:00:51.059> even<00:00:51.180> find<00:00:51.510> the<00:00:51.629> pot<00:00:51.840> it's<00:00:52.620> up

00:00:52.759 --> 00:00:52.769 
see if I can even find the pot it's up

00:00:52.769 --> 00:00:56.250 
see if I can even find the pot it's up
there

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:56.260 

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.069 

I<00:00:56.320> mean<00:00:57.039> the<00:00:57.699> harder<00:00:58.030> I<00:00:58.059> cut<00:00:58.390> it<00:00:58.510> back<00:00:58.690> the

00:00:59.069 --> 00:00:59.079 
I mean the harder I cut it back the

00:00:59.079 --> 00:01:01.380 
I mean the harder I cut it back the
longer<00:00:59.500> it's<00:00:59.829> going<00:00:59.980> to<00:01:00.039> take<00:01:00.309> to<00:01:00.489> grow<00:01:00.730> back

00:01:01.380 --> 00:01:01.390 
longer it's going to take to grow back

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:03.090 
longer it's going to take to grow back
so<00:01:01.899> we're<00:01:02.350> going<00:01:02.440> to<00:01:02.500> take<00:01:02.710> some<00:01:02.920> off<00:01:03.070> the

00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:03.100 
so we're going to take some off the

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:10.200 
so we're going to take some off the
bottom<00:01:03.640> and<00:01:03.940> then<00:01:07.830> pick<00:01:08.830> some<00:01:09.040> off<00:01:09.250> the<00:01:09.640> top<00:01:09.880> as

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:10.210 
bottom and then pick some off the top as

00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:12.030 
bottom and then pick some off the top as
well<00:01:10.270> because<00:01:11.110> if<00:01:11.229> you<00:01:11.350> don't<00:01:11.590> take<00:01:11.770> it<00:01:11.920> off

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:12.040 
well because if you don't take it off

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:13.170 
well because if you don't take it off
the<00:01:12.159> top<00:01:12.340> you're<00:01:12.520> going<00:01:12.610> to<00:01:12.670> end<00:01:12.850> up<00:01:12.940> with<00:01:13.119> a

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:13.180 
the top you're going to end up with a

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:20.350 
the top you're going to end up with a
hole<00:01:13.450> on<00:01:13.750> top<00:01:14.340> so

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:20.360 

00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:21.880 

so<00:01:20.840> I'm<00:01:20.960> not<00:01:21.050> gonna<00:01:21.170> do<00:01:21.350> the<00:01:21.440> whole<00:01:21.470> plant

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:21.890 
so I'm not gonna do the whole plant

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:28.310 
so I'm not gonna do the whole plant
right<00:01:22.430> now<00:01:22.640> but

00:01:28.310 --> 00:01:28.320 

00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:30.550 

so

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:30.560 
so

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.530 
so
we<00:01:31.070> got<00:01:31.250> one

00:01:34.530 --> 00:01:34.540 

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:37.440 

one<00:01:35.110> started<00:01:35.820> and<00:01:36.820> this<00:01:36.940> is<00:01:37.000> going<00:01:37.180> to<00:01:37.240> come

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:37.450 
one started and this is going to come

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:41.370 
one started and this is going to come
back<00:01:37.600> like<00:01:37.840> gangbusters<00:01:38.550> so<00:01:39.550> I<00:01:40.380> could

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:41.380 
back like gangbusters so I could

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:43.230 
back like gangbusters so I could
probably<00:01:41.560> take<00:01:41.800> some<00:01:42.040> more<00:01:42.250> out<00:01:42.850> from<00:01:43.150> the

00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:43.240 
probably take some more out from the

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:45.000 
probably take some more out from the
inside<00:01:43.420> where<00:01:44.110> it's<00:01:44.230> not<00:01:44.380> really<00:01:44.620> growing

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:45.010 
inside where it's not really growing

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:56.350 
inside where it's not really growing
look<00:01:45.160> at<00:01:45.360> this<00:01:46.360> is<00:01:46.510> just<00:01:46.830> yuck<00:01:48.390> so

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:56.360 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.640 

there<00:01:56.810> we<00:01:56.900> go<00:01:57.080> oh<00:01:57.350> we<00:01:58.010> have<00:01:58.130> one<00:01:58.340> down
