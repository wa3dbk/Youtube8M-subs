00:03:19.309 --> 00:03:19.319 
got a downward tilting wrist so he can

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:21.589 
got a downward tilting wrist so he can
be<00:03:19.470> all<00:03:19.590> like<00:03:19.919> I<00:03:20.099> broke<00:03:20.730> my<00:03:20.940> hand<00:03:21.120> punching

needed a little bit of work on now on
mine<00:03:26.730> he's<00:03:27.359> got<00:03:27.510> a<00:03:27.540> pretty<00:03:27.780> decent<00:03:27.840> range<00:03:28.260> of

00:03:28.369 --> 00:03:28.379 
mine he's got a pretty decent range of

00:03:28.379 --> 00:03:29.839 
mine he's got a pretty decent range of
poseability<00:03:28.709> and<00:03:29.040> it<00:03:29.129> doesn't<00:03:29.400> force<00:03:29.669> his

00:03:29.839 --> 00:03:29.849 
poseability and it doesn't force his

00:03:29.849 --> 00:03:31.309 
poseability and it doesn't force his
head<00:03:30.030> to<00:03:30.150> do<00:03:30.269> anything<00:03:30.659> that<00:03:30.780> it<00:03:30.900> doesn't<00:03:31.169> want

00:03:33.259 --> 00:03:33.269 
to that's in part because I actually

00:03:33.269 --> 00:03:34.970 
to that's in part because I actually
scraped<00:03:33.840> out<00:03:34.019> a<00:03:34.049> bunch<00:03:34.290> of<00:03:34.379> plastic<00:03:34.590> from<00:03:34.949> the

his<00:03:37.919> chin<00:03:38.340> tends<00:03:38.849> to<00:03:39.060> butt<00:03:39.269> against<00:03:39.690> it<00:03:39.810> and

00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:39.930 
his chin tends to butt against it and

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:41.180 
his chin tends to butt against it and
you'll<00:03:40.049> have<00:03:40.109> to<00:03:40.319> kind<00:03:40.470> of<00:03:40.530> tilt<00:03:40.799> his<00:03:40.980> head<00:03:41.010> a

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:41.190 
you'll have to kind of tilt his head a

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:43.819 
you'll have to kind of tilt his head a
bit<00:03:41.459> to<00:03:42.209> turn<00:03:42.419> it<00:03:42.540> sideways<00:03:42.780> in<00:03:43.530> the<00:03:43.560> way<00:03:43.709> that

00:03:43.819 --> 00:03:43.829 
bit to turn it sideways in the way that

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:44.899 
bit to turn it sideways in the way that
I've<00:03:43.919> done<00:03:44.040> it<00:03:44.190> you<00:03:44.250> can<00:03:44.370> kind<00:03:44.549> of<00:03:44.639> tilt<00:03:44.819> his

00:03:44.899 --> 00:03:44.909 
I've done it you can kind of tilt his

00:03:44.909 --> 00:03:46.819 
I've done it you can kind of tilt his
head<00:03:44.940> back<00:03:45.090> down<00:03:45.510> once<00:03:45.900> it's<00:03:46.109> sideways<00:03:46.530> and

head back down once it's sideways and

00:03:46.829 --> 00:03:49.099 
head back down once it's sideways and
anyway<00:03:47.579> if<00:03:47.940> you<00:03:48.120> have<00:03:48.209> an<00:03:48.299> exacto<00:03:48.690> knife<00:03:48.900> it's

00:03:49.099 --> 00:03:49.109 
anyway if you have an exacto knife it's

00:03:49.109 --> 00:03:50.659 
anyway if you have an exacto knife it's
not<00:03:49.260> too<00:03:49.379> hard<00:03:49.590> to<00:03:49.620> do<00:03:49.769> just<00:03:49.799> shave<00:03:50.250> out<00:03:50.489> the

not too hard to do just shave out the

00:03:50.669 --> 00:03:52.490 
not too hard to do just shave out the
inside<00:03:51.000> of<00:03:51.120> that<00:03:51.150> collar<00:03:51.479> and<00:03:51.720> it'll<00:03:52.260> be<00:03:52.349> good

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:52.500 
inside of that collar and it'll be good

00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.649 
inside of that collar and it'll be good
to<00:03:52.620> go<00:03:52.769> he's<00:03:53.400> got<00:03:53.579> a<00:03:53.609> waist<00:03:53.849> joint<00:03:54.180> which<00:03:54.419> was
