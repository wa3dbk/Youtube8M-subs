00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:15.059
 hi to all and welcome to this 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.910
 sixth video presentation of the 

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:19.020
 harry potter massals collection so 

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:23.810
 as I told you last 

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:26.329
 time we finally finished with this first wall 

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:28.439
 whose who is the richest 

00:00:26.329 --> 00:00:31.890
 that today will be interested in what 

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:34.199
 happens on all this part of my 

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:37.739
 room try to have an overview 

00:00:34.199 --> 00:00:40.019
 so that's the gateway so 

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:42.780
 it's here we go back so that's what 

00:00:40.019 --> 00:00:45.409
 who faces the main part of 

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:47.909
 my room so this part 

00:00:45.409 --> 00:00:51.510
 So here we have everything we saw 

00:00:47.909 --> 00:00:55.350
 in the first few parts of video is 

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:57.019
 just here that's what we're going to 

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:59.070
 lean today 

00:00:57.019 --> 00:01:01.159
 so here so just above the 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.750
 door or in a small corner so the bottom 

00:01:01.159 --> 00:01:05.070
 flowery wallpaper like that was 

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:07.950
 left as it is because it's been a long time 

00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:10.170
 been a corner entirely dedicated to shading 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:11.780
 so obviously as you can the 

00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:14.250
 see that sticks to his skin 

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.230
 so there are leftovers of seven parts 

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:19.950
 therefore commit to starting with 

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:21.420
 proclamations so that's not the ones 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:22.740
 personal fabrications it's the 

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.770
 proclamations found in the book 

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:28.020
 the magic of the movies just below we have 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:29.400
 a creation against the foot little 

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:33.030
 word that the shady shouted mcgonagall 

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:35.070
 was counting arid his course so that 

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.360
 this is a present book detail is not 

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:37.620
 present in the film but so far 

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.680
 they had to turn the stage since they 

00:01:37.620 --> 00:01:43.470
 did indeed create this little letter 

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.690
 which we find an image in magic 

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:47.850
 movies that I had scanned and 

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:51.960
 print an image that you can 

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:54.540
 find on my plate or of course that you 

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:56.250
 are a small logo of the department of 

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:59.610
 the magic education of the Ministry of 

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:02.790
 magic and so I did this part 

00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:04.890
 a small corner dedicated to luna also you 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:08.129
 can see here the little frame of me 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:10.170
 with evanna lynch at the meeting 

00:02:08.129 --> 00:02:12.900
 signings for the premiere of the dvd 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.909
 relics of death part 2 just to 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.670
 side the little baguette of mosnac I 

00:02:14.909 --> 00:02:18.820
 bought at the studio so tower on a small 

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:21.350
 display stand made 

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:23.780
 a little rage see with two clowns 

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:25.910
 nothing very complicated the eyeing 

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:29.590
 specter of wavers eyeing specter forgiveness 

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:32.210
 so that's what we find with these 

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:34.250
 I had spoken about it is an object that 

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:35.780
 I bought at the studio so 

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:39.230
 when we wear them his ghost glasses 

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:40.790
 we see the world a little way 

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:43.250
 rainbow background it's pretty special 

00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:44.950
 as a vision, it's going fast 

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:47.900
 headache but it's pretty fun 

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:51.140
 next door we have a small map of 

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:52.310
 choco-frogs so that comes from a 

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:53.630
 chocolate frogs I bought at 

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:55.370
 studio tower I told you that I 

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:56.720
 had it in duplicate the two times I 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:03:01.400
 went both times I fell 

00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:02.930
 on Slytherin so I asked him like 

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:05.720
 these in this sense because I like 

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:09.110
 not too much do not complain about the image of 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:12.170
 these cards in the end next we have them 

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:13.850
 small receipts from the store des 

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:16.130
 weasley brothers so cv objects that 

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:17.630
 come from the end of the objects of the 

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:20.450
 papers that come from the box 

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:23.540
 ron weasley artefacts and artifacts 

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:26.920
 so from noble collection if we have a 

00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:26.920
 small display on which I put 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:31.430
 a book related to courage and 

00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:35.540
 finally I replace them with this 

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:39.100
 homemade version of the story of the 

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:41.570
 magic by mathilde offer of bag here is 

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:43.130
 so that's an image or for the 

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:46.730
 cover so I took the one that I 

00:03:43.130 --> 00:03:47.720
 found the original let's say and for 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:49.130
 the back is actually something 

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:51.680
 that I did with paint 

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:55.190
 you know is obvious had so I emptied 

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:56.750
 that's what we saw in the 

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:58.850
 triangle is jelly added by a 

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:03.290
 little description that I found on 

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:05.300
 internet of the book so here is so 

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:07.160
 you find this version of the 

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:10.010
 internet coverage 

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:12.110
 well then you will know that it was I who 

00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:14.060
 done and not with photoshop why at 

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:15.890
 crates but with paint that has a 

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:17.090
 software with luc and we can do some 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:19.209
 lots of things despite what we could 

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:19.209
 believe 

00:04:19.630 --> 00:04:27.110
 that's it for this little part 

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:29.240
 right below we have the poster 

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:31.550
 Sirius black stainless steel 

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:34.849
 and a poster that was in the 

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:37.280
 delivers the magic of movies underneath a 

00:04:34.849 --> 00:04:39.979
 small corner dedicated to the studio tower with 

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:41.180
 some memories so a paper that 

00:04:39.979 --> 00:04:42.729
 I have in duplicate of which I 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:45.469
 had already spoken in the last video 

00:04:42.729 --> 00:04:48.110
 so it's a paper that distributes to 

00:04:45.469 --> 00:04:49.639
 children who is kind of animated 

00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:51.639
 during the visit you have to find a 

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:54.949
 live outside in each room 

00:04:51.639 --> 00:04:57.949
 here is a little leaflet another 

00:04:54.949 --> 00:04:59.060
 prospectus and if we have a small article 

00:04:57.949 --> 00:05:01.759
 that I found in the newspaper of 

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:03.039
 the eurostar so the first time you 

00:05:01.759 --> 00:05:05.750
 was going to london because actually 

00:05:03.039 --> 00:05:07.279
 when I went there it was very little 

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:08.900
 of time that studio tower was open 

00:05:07.279 --> 00:05:10.610
 so we talked about it a lot in the 

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:11.779
 press he had posters everywhere 

00:05:10.610 --> 00:05:13.819
 in the metro etc 

00:05:11.779 --> 00:05:17.750
 so we were really diving into 

00:05:13.819 --> 00:05:19.810
 the mood here some pictures of the 

00:05:17.750 --> 00:05:21.710
 visit 

00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:24.469
 that's good for all the details 

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:26.479
 obviously I refer you to the blog with 

00:05:24.469 --> 00:05:31.250
 articles where I made the story 

00:05:26.479 --> 00:05:32.180
 Complete these two trips and I 

00:05:31.250 --> 00:05:35.120
 remind you that I'm going back 

00:05:32.180 --> 00:05:37.310
 third time for the new year so 

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:40.430
 early January there will be a small article 

00:05:37.310 --> 00:05:41.479
 especially as the studio tower will be decorated 

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:43.039
 way would it be so it will be 

00:05:41.479 --> 00:05:47.270
 interesting to see small 

00:05:43.039 --> 00:05:51.050
 differences and finally to finish so 

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:54.199
 at the bottom of the door we have what 

00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:55.610
 was supposed to be a shield so at 

00:05:54.199 --> 00:05:58.250
 the gryffindor effigy so it's very 

00:05:55.610 --> 00:06:00.830
 simple a piece of cardboard cut from 

00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:02.930
 this form a stroke of paint with some 

00:06:00.830 --> 00:06:03.889
 self- adhesive paper we stick the logo of 

00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:06.409
 guy forget had not done any article 

00:06:03.889 --> 00:06:09.349
 on this creation because it was worth 

00:06:06.409 --> 00:06:10.669
 maybe not the cost but see it's 

00:06:09.349 --> 00:06:12.020
 very simple to make I had done 

00:06:10.669 --> 00:06:13.759
 another to the snake effigy started 

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:15.710
 so I do not know at all what I 

00:06:13.759 --> 00:06:17.089
 did it to be honest but we can 

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:18.680
 do it with the four houses as 

00:06:17.089 --> 00:06:21.139
 you can imagine that's enough 

00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:22.789
 easy so according to your house of de 

00:06:21.139 --> 00:06:25.300
 predilection can you do this little 

00:06:22.789 --> 00:06:30.870
 pleasure of small decorations 

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:35.300
 so that's it for this part this door 

00:06:30.870 --> 00:06:38.820
 and what's going on right above 

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:40.410
 so I tell you next time you 

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:42.420
 can still subscribe to my channel 

00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:45.120
 youtube so do not miss the sequel ya 

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:46.200
 still a lot to see and I 

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:48.800
 tell you very soon 

00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:48.800
 kisses to all
