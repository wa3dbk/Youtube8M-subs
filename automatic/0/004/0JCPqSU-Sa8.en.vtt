00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:03.880
 because if this is the place of gods 

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:06.070
 dreams 

00:00:03.880 --> 00:00:10.179
 if he had dreamed it so he slept 

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:13.389
 also to dream it so tonight but 

00:00:10.179 --> 00:00:15.999
 we say that beyond the result mi 

00:00:13.389 --> 00:00:19.210
 interested to see the answer of the 

00:00:15.999 --> 00:00:23.130
 guys and it was only one 

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:25.330
 Positive response under commitment below 

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:26.800
 from the point of view of the game idea 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:30.460
 that we want to carry forward from the point of 

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:31.930
 view of great big aggression 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.660
 availability on their part and with 

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:36.610
 found a lot of players 

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:38.620
 available that they want to let him do 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:40.450
 something important said this there are 

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:42.040
 only four games we work 

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:44.829
 together and there is a truly path 

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:46.780
 long and hard yet to do though 

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:49.180
 these are games that anyway from 

00:00:46.780 --> 00:00:50.920
 trust from enthusiasm allow us to 

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:52.720
 work to keep doing what 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:54.970
 we are doing 

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:56.950
 still with more credibility here since 

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:58.809
 point of view of aggression from 

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:01.030
 point of view of high pressing from 

00:00:58.809 --> 00:01:02.829
 ability to attack even defending 

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:04.180
 as if he explained to coverciano the 

00:01:02.829 --> 00:01:07.260
 I like the team 

00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:09.340
 has a team of antonio boccia but 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:10.670
 we say that we have undertaken the 

00:01:09.340 --> 00:01:14.140
 route 

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:17.360
 we did six workouts together 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:18.799
 quite intense because then I have to do 

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:21.470
 recover from the labors of the championship 

00:01:18.799 --> 00:01:23.600
 but already give the game level of the 

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:25.189
 not tactical principles and I must say that 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:27.830
 I'm happy because I saw anyway 

00:01:25.189 --> 00:01:29.509
 great application that the de will from 

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:34.299
 part of these guys 

00:01:29.509 --> 00:01:34.299
 I repeat this is a mix of 

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:39.810
 the boys mature over twenty years and many 

00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:41.220
 young people who want and who can 

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:43.590
 however become important players 

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:46.470
 but in my opinion it was still very much 

00:01:43.590 --> 00:01:47.509
 long though I say if here that winning helps 

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:51.119
 to win 

00:01:47.509 --> 00:01:54.420
 surprised by the understanding between zaza and immobile 

00:01:51.119 --> 00:01:56.130
 which they had a great time but we have 

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:58.530
 worked for this we worked for 

00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:01.170
 in defense of the attackers but as well 

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:05.520
 he then found himself right along with 

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:08.220
 right-handed youth with motionless in the 

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.750
 same quailrella the same sharawy 

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:11.760
 that only tried in that position 

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.290
 I repeat the important thing is that it is 

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:15.900
 the availability and willingness to work 

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:18.959
 there is so much dairy and I am finding a 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:20.340
 really destroyed group of boys 

00:02:18.959 --> 00:02:22.230
 having said that now we recover 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.660
 let 's try to work because tuesday there 

00:02:22.230 --> 00:02:26.040
 awaits a battle is an account that the 

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:27.690
 norway who showed it to him 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:30.060
 be a very easy team here 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.510
 in perspective oslo marco 

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:32.970
 Verratti 

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.980
 we all ask ourselves 6 present or if it is 

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:37.920
 still the future of our football and yes 

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:39.750
 can play with reds already oslo but 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:42.269
 marco verratti may be the present 

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:43.860
 may be the future depending on the 

00:02:42.269 --> 00:02:45.700
 times that 

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:48.519
 I decide to send him to the field from the beginning 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:50.830
 during the game for that role I say 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:53.080
 that we have important coverage not 

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:55.989
 we forget that there is more than Daniel de 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:58.090
 reds that today has made a great deal 

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:59.379
 game we andrea pirlo that gave 

00:02:58.090 --> 00:03:02.410
 his willingness to grow 

00:02:59.379 --> 00:03:03.370
 these guys we have really marco 

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:06.400
 marco verratti 

00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:07.750
 here I say that I see him very much 

00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:10.989
 actress of a must enter because 

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:12.910
 the interiors I need people who 

00:03:10.989 --> 00:03:14.470
 fits into the leg that will also come 

00:03:12.910 --> 00:03:17.260
 on the outside it was a team 

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:19.269
 special tonight but because in schools 

00:03:17.260 --> 00:03:23.310
 special I say that tonight he had some 

00:03:19.269 --> 00:03:25.840
 special tanger men who continue 

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:26.980
 because I am convinced that working yes 

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:28.989
 they can do good things 

00:03:26.980 --> 00:03:32.099
