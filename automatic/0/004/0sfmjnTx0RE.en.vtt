00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.960
 simple the experience was once 

00:00:28.789 --> 00:00:30.460
 besides goods 

00:00:30.460 --> 00:00:34.450
 before starting your adventure tennis know the power and possibilities of 

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:37.450
 vehicle you have chosen 

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:41.359
 like all soldiers 

00:00:41.359 --> 00:00:44.359
 I think it has been designed and built with the highest quality 

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.060
 this quality is reflected in the stylized body design 

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:52.060
 as in its special performance and high performance 

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:57.610
 with a production trade and tourism the sports petare vs a vehicle of 

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:59.770
 elegance distinction 

00:00:59.770 --> 00:01:03.360
 although it can boast of the versatility of a car with four-wheel drive 

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.360
 wheels 

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:12.970
 equipped with advanced technology the cinema men also practical with great 

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:16.470
 variety of functional compartments windows and large areas of 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.470
 storage 

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.400
 before starting your trip observe the security aspects 

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:32.460
 thus the wake of a vehicle that has gone through an extensive testing program 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:36.470
 of impact taking into account the highest global safety standards 

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:44.300
 In addition to the reinforced body the iron that has more air 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:48.740
 for the driver as for the passenger the front and rear debris 

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:51.740
 protect you from overturning 

00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:58.799
 the vehicle is not only safe but has been designed for a long 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:00.290
 lifetime 

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:05.330
 approximately 90% of the metal sheets used have been channeled 

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:11.069
 the areas of the body responses to damage caused by stones and 

00:02:11.069 --> 00:02:14.069
 work are protected with a special paint 

00:02:14.979 --> 00:02:19.099
 the front and rear bumpers stitched with a plastic without 

00:02:19.099 --> 00:02:23.109
 paint to facilitate recycling and reduce the damage caused by 

00:02:23.109 --> 00:02:25.089
 stones 

00:02:25.089 --> 00:02:28.619
 additional protection is provided by the antilles side moldings 

00:02:29.689 --> 00:02:33.549
 the stylized protectors of the wheel arch and the frame of the 

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:34.959
 frame 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:39.319
 the brain uses a monocoque construction that provides an excellent 

00:02:39.319 --> 00:02:41.559
 resides 

00:02:41.559 --> 00:02:44.559
 This is a car with its own character 

00:02:49.529 --> 00:02:53.469
 power steering is like many other factors something that makes 

00:02:53.469 --> 00:02:55.749
 more relaxed driving in cities 

00:02:55.749 --> 00:02:59.479
 the four corners of the vehicle are rounded and visible from the seat 

00:02:59.479 --> 00:03:03.459
 of the driver thus helping to facilitate parking and maneuvers in 

00:03:03.459 --> 00:03:04.189
 general 

00:03:04.189 --> 00:03:08.229
 a higher position of the seat and a good general visibility to the 

00:03:08.229 --> 00:03:11.229
 final crv and ideal for driving in the urban environment 

00:03:12.109 --> 00:03:15.749
 automatic transmission available control system create closet of 

00:03:15.749 --> 00:03:18.379
 Honduras 

00:03:18.379 --> 00:03:21.980
 This act has a series of inputs during sudden braking followed by 

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:22.889
 Celebrations 

00:03:22.889 --> 00:03:26.489
 to provide a smoother ride on stopping and departures in 

00:03:26.489 --> 00:03:29.489
 cities 

00:03:33.689 --> 00:03:38.169
 the shape of the trv6 and aerodynamic which helps the fast driving and the 

00:03:38.169 --> 00:03:41.169
 high performance 

00:03:42.319 --> 00:03:46.289
 in the automatic transmission the consumption is improved by means of a converter 

00:03:46.289 --> 00:03:50.649
 pair with self-locking that works in the third and fourth speed both of the 

00:03:50.649 --> 00:03:53.469
 federation like deceleration 

00:03:53.469 --> 00:03:56.930
 the fourth super-super speed also provides an improvement of 

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:59.930
 consumption economy and helps reduce noise at high speeds 

00:04:01.119 --> 00:04:05.229
 powerful ventilated disc front brakes are supplied in the prv 

00:04:05.229 --> 00:04:07.549
 and rear drum brakes 

00:04:07.549 --> 00:04:10.659
 although the antiblocking system suffers is an available option 

00:04:13.009 --> 00:04:17.870
 the 2-liter gasoline engine that produces and 128 horses and five thousand 500 

00:04:17.869 --> 00:04:19.249
 revolutions per minute 

00:04:19.249 --> 00:04:23.469
 is specifically prepared to provide a flat torque curve and a 

00:04:23.469 --> 00:04:26.469
 maximum torque relatively low revolutions 

00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:32.940
 a maximum torque of 180 and 200 meters is achieved at 4 thousand 200 revolutions per 

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:35.940
 minute 

00:04:43.809 --> 00:04:47.589
 the revolution in engine construction technology has provided 

00:04:47.589 --> 00:04:51.099
 Significant advantages of space under the hood of the prv 

00:04:52.259 --> 00:04:55.949
 the first engine with blocks of compact integral can misses produced 

00:04:55.949 --> 00:05:00.340
 commercially in the world offers a capacity of 2 liters in an engine with 

00:05:00.339 --> 00:05:03.339
 dimensions of about 1 6 liters 

00:05:04.289 --> 00:05:08.330
 In addition to the advantage of its light weight three compact dimensions of the engine 

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:11.060
 they allow the arcs of the wheel to be larger 

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:13.610
 what improves the angle of rotation 

00:05:13.610 --> 00:05:17.139
 It also allows a greater angle of attack to help very slopes 

00:05:17.139 --> 00:05:18.580
 pronounced 

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:22.340
 the automatic transmission of vehicles and that ends when you have 

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:23.949
 to change gears 

00:05:23.949 --> 00:05:28.129
 actually scientific the type of driving and according to sel different 

00:05:28.129 --> 00:05:29.370
 change maps 

00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:33.050
 select the most appropriate time to change a top and bottom gear 

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:37.710
 with all this the pnv provides a very smooth driving 

00:05:44.949 --> 00:05:48.409
 unlike many of its competitors the innovative system of 

00:05:48.409 --> 00:05:50.180
 Traction on the four wheels 

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:52.729
 it is not permanently in operation 

00:05:52.729 --> 00:05:56.210
 neither does it need the driver to start it or peace at the moment 

00:05:56.210 --> 00:05:57.809
 appropriate 

00:05:57.809 --> 00:06:01.809
 instead, Honda's real-time four-wheel drive system 

00:06:01.809 --> 00:06:05.069
 activates it automatically when the surface conditions the 

00:06:05.069 --> 00:06:08.180
 imposing 

00:06:08.180 --> 00:06:12.020
 this not only improves driving comfort but also improves the 

00:06:12.020 --> 00:06:15.650
 Consumption increases efficiency in driving pierluisi levels of 

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:18.650
 noise and vibrations 

00:06:19.779 --> 00:06:22.560
 the pnv was placed in this class of vehicles 

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:26.010
 which has been endowed with the well-known suspension of some banks 

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:29.010
 thus providing a stability that an excellent handling 

00:06:31.499 --> 00:06:34.860
 the reviews in the suspension have been designed specifically for 

00:06:34.859 --> 00:06:39.059
 meet the dual function of the performance crv inside and outside the 

00:06:39.059 --> 00:06:42.059
 highway 

00:06:42.879 --> 00:06:44.690
 I have always been selected the foot 

00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:46.990
 It is the ideal vehicle to travel 

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:47.979
 seize it
