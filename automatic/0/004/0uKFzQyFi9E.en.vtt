00:02:00.119 --> 00:02:01.760 
connections like in this is one of the
biggest<00:02:00.420> factors<00:02:00.990> when<00:02:01.290> it<00:02:01.380> comes<00:02:01.560> down<00:02:01.710> to

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:01.770 
biggest factors when it comes down to

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.950 
biggest factors when it comes down to
call<00:02:02.040> of<00:02:02.130> duty<00:02:02.369> and<00:02:02.549> in<00:02:03.149> my<00:02:03.299> opinion<00:02:03.390> at<00:02:03.899> least

00:02:03.950 --> 00:02:03.960 
call of duty and in my opinion at least

00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:05.780 
call of duty and in my opinion at least
for<00:02:04.439> me<00:02:04.590> they<00:02:04.890> have<00:02:05.009> been<00:02:05.159> great<00:02:05.490> the<00:02:05.670> hit

00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:05.790 
for me they have been great the hit

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.550 
for me they have been great the hit
detection<00:02:05.909> has<00:02:06.299> been<00:02:06.479> perfect<00:02:06.930> but<00:02:07.380> that's

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:07.560 
detection has been perfect but that's

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.410 
detection has been perfect but that's
because<00:02:07.740> i<00:02:07.920> have<00:02:08.220> good<00:02:08.429> internet<00:02:08.670> i<00:02:08.819> have<00:02:09.000> a<00:02:09.060> 30

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:09.420

but uh yeah you have some pretty good

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:20.170 
but uh yeah you have some pretty good
connections<00:02:19.430> if<00:02:19.580> you<00:02:19.670> have<00:02:19.760> good<00:02:19.910> internet

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.180 
connections if you have good internet

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.720 
connections if you have good internet
speed<00:02:20.570> but<00:02:20.870> people<00:02:21.470> like<00:02:21.590> Jay<00:02:21.860> nasty<00:02:22.310> had<00:02:22.550> been

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:22.730 
speed but people like Jay nasty had been

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:24.760 
speed but people like Jay nasty had been
saying<00:02:23.000> that<00:02:23.330> it's<00:02:23.690> absolute<00:02:24.290> shit<00:02:24.620> when

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:24.770 
saying that it's absolute shit when

00:02:24.770 --> 00:02:26.470 
saying that it's absolute shit when
you're<00:02:24.860> on<00:02:24.950> a<00:02:24.980> 3<00:02:25.250> bar<00:02:25.400> obviously<00:02:26.180> I'm<00:02:26.300> on<00:02:26.450> a

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
you're on a 3 bar obviously I'm on a

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.180 
you're on a 3 bar obviously I'm on a
four<00:02:26.780> bar<00:02:26.900> for<00:02:27.140> the<00:02:27.200> majority<00:02:27.440> of<00:02:27.590> the<00:02:27.710> time<00:02:27.890> so

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:28.190 
four bar for the majority of the time so

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:30.460 
four bar for the majority of the time so
connections<00:02:29.030> aren't<00:02:29.270> too<00:02:29.480> bad<00:02:29.690> of<00:02:29.960> a<00:02:30.050> thing

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:30.470 
connections aren't too bad of a thing

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:32.380 
connections aren't too bad of a thing
for<00:02:30.830> me<00:02:30.950> they're<00:02:31.100> actually<00:02:31.520> quite<00:02:31.850> good<00:02:31.970> I

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:32.390 
for me they're actually quite good I

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:34.060 
for me they're actually quite good I
guess<00:02:32.570> you<00:02:32.660> could<00:02:32.780> say<00:02:32.960> but<00:02:33.140> if<00:02:33.560> you<00:02:33.650> do<00:02:33.770> a<00:02:33.800> bad

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:34.070 
guess you could say but if you do a bad

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:36.040 
guess you could say but if you do a bad
internet<00:02:34.310> I<00:02:34.580> would<00:02:34.820> say<00:02:35.060> that<00:02:35.300> you<00:02:35.540> should

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050 
internet I would say that you should

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:37.570 
internet I would say that you should
upgrade<00:02:36.380> your<00:02:36.710> internet<00:02:37.070> as<00:02:37.220> soon<00:02:37.459> as

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:37.580 
upgrade your internet as soon as

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:39.520 
upgrade your internet as soon as
possible<00:02:38.060> because<00:02:38.090> this<00:02:38.810> game<00:02:39.020> it's<00:02:39.290> very

00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:39.530 
possible because this game it's very

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:41.560 
possible because this game it's very
connection<00:02:39.950> based<00:02:40.130> you<00:02:40.459> can<00:02:40.700> be<00:02:40.820> behind<00:02:41.300> if

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:41.570 
connection based you can be behind if

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:43.690 
connection based you can be behind if
you're<00:02:41.720> on<00:02:41.840> a<00:02:41.870> 3<00:02:42.110> bar<00:02:42.260> and<00:02:42.530> you'll<00:02:43.280> have<00:02:43.640> a

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:43.700 
you're on a 3 bar and you'll have a

00:02:43.700 --> 00:02:45.520 
you're on a 3 bar and you'll have a
really<00:02:44.150> difficult<00:02:44.360> time<00:02:44.810> killing<00:02:45.230> the<00:02:45.320> enemy

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530 
really difficult time killing the enemy

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:47.410 
really difficult time killing the enemy
so<00:02:45.740> I<00:02:45.770> just<00:02:45.890> want<00:02:46.040> to<00:02:46.070> mention<00:02:46.220> that<00:02:46.370> then<00:02:47.209> the

00:02:47.410 --> 00:02:47.420 
so I just want to mention that then the

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:48.699 
so I just want to mention that then the
next<00:02:47.540> thing<00:02:47.690> I<00:02:47.840> want<00:02:48.020> to<00:02:48.050> talk<00:02:48.200> about<00:02:48.260> what<00:02:48.680> is

00:02:48.699 --> 00:02:48.709 
next thing I want to talk about what is

00:02:48.709 --> 00:02:50.530 
next thing I want to talk about what is
the<00:02:48.890> sensitivity<00:02:49.430> like<00:02:49.610> actually<00:02:50.090> they<00:02:50.330> had

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540 
the sensitivity like actually they had

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:53.260 
the sensitivity like actually they had
now<00:02:50.660> have<00:02:50.900> a<00:02:51.140> 14<00:02:52.100> sensitivity<00:02:52.489> is<00:02:52.910> as<00:02:53.060> high<00:02:53.239> as

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:53.270 
now have a 14 sensitivity is as high as

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:55.300 
now have a 14 sensitivity is as high as
it<00:02:53.450> goes<00:02:53.510> so<00:02:54.260> it<00:02:54.500> definitely<00:02:54.650> is<00:02:54.860> a<00:02:54.890> little<00:02:54.980> bit

00:02:55.300 --> 00:02:55.310 
it goes so it definitely is a little bit

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:56.800 
it goes so it definitely is a little bit
different<00:02:55.670> i've<00:02:55.760> actually<00:02:55.910> been<00:02:56.120> playing<00:02:56.540> on

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810 
different i've actually been playing on

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:59.470 
different i've actually been playing on
a<00:02:56.840> 7<00:02:57.590> sensitivity<00:02:58.250> and<00:02:58.459> i'm<00:02:58.880> normally<00:02:59.239> one<00:02:59.390> of

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480 
a 7 sensitivity and i'm normally one of

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.030 
a 7 sensitivity and i'm normally one of
those<00:02:59.600> three<00:02:59.959> sensitivity<00:03:00.560> sort<00:03:00.739> of<00:03:00.830> players

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:01.040 
those three sensitivity sort of players

00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:02.979 
those three sensitivity sort of players
so<00:03:01.370> it<00:03:01.640> definitely<00:03:02.000> has<00:03:02.270> changed<00:03:02.660> quite<00:03:02.870> a<00:03:02.930> bit

00:03:02.979 --> 00:03:02.989 
so it definitely has changed quite a bit

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:04.960 
so it definitely has changed quite a bit
if<00:03:03.260> you<00:03:03.380> guys<00:03:03.530> used<00:03:03.800> to<00:03:03.860> plan<00:03:04.130> like<00:03:04.520> a<00:03:04.550> 3

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:04.970 
if you guys used to plan like a 3

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:07.210 
if you guys used to plan like a 3
sensitivity<00:03:05.600> try<00:03:06.200> upping<00:03:06.590> it<00:03:06.739> by<00:03:06.860> at<00:03:06.980> least

00:03:07.210 --> 00:03:07.220 
sensitivity try upping it by at least

00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:08.920 
sensitivity try upping it by at least
three<00:03:07.610> or<00:03:07.730> four<00:03:07.970> if<00:03:08.150> you<00:03:08.270> wanted<00:03:08.480> to<00:03:08.600> feel<00:03:08.780> like

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:08.930 
three or four if you wanted to feel like

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:10.180 
three or four if you wanted to feel like
it<00:03:09.050> did<00:03:09.170> in<00:03:09.200> Morrow<00:03:09.440> for<00:03:09.530> three<00:03:09.709> that's<00:03:10.040> just

00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:10.190 
it did in Morrow for three that's just

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:12.010 
it did in Morrow for three that's just
what<00:03:10.310> I<00:03:10.340> have<00:03:10.400> to<00:03:10.580> say<00:03:10.700> about<00:03:10.730> that<00:03:10.940> then<00:03:11.780> the

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:12.020 
what I have to say about that then the

00:03:12.020 --> 00:03:14.140 
what I have to say about that then the
next<00:03:12.260> question<00:03:12.410> is<00:03:12.800> is<00:03:13.070> it<00:03:13.130> hard<00:03:13.610> to<00:03:13.670> level<00:03:14.030> up

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:14.150 
next question is is it hard to level up

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:16.120 
next question is is it hard to level up
and<00:03:14.270> it's<00:03:14.450> actually<00:03:14.870> a<00:03:15.080> little<00:03:15.620> bit<00:03:15.799> harder

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:16.130 
and it's actually a little bit harder

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:17.740 
and it's actually a little bit harder
after<00:03:16.280> you<00:03:16.519> get<00:03:16.670> into<00:03:16.910> those<00:03:17.060> higher<00:03:17.299> levels

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750 
after you get into those higher levels

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:19.750 
after you get into those higher levels
in<00:03:17.870> my<00:03:17.959> opinion<00:03:18.200> because<00:03:18.410> it's<00:03:19.130> just<00:03:19.340> a<00:03:19.549> little

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:19.760 
in my opinion because it's just a little

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:21.280 
in my opinion because it's just a little
bit<00:03:19.850> more<00:03:19.970> of<00:03:20.090> a<00:03:20.180> push<00:03:20.360> it<00:03:20.570> takes<00:03:20.750> a<00:03:20.870> lot<00:03:21.049> longer

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:21.290 
bit more of a push it takes a lot longer

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:23.770 
bit more of a push it takes a lot longer
so<00:03:21.530> that's<00:03:22.430> one<00:03:22.610> of<00:03:22.700> the<00:03:22.790> bad<00:03:22.970> things<00:03:23.000> it's<00:03:23.540> not

00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:23.780 
so that's one of the bad things it's not

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:25.810 
so that's one of the bad things it's not
like<00:03:23.989> mono<00:03:24.200> 43<00:03:24.709> where<00:03:24.950> you<00:03:25.250> know<00:03:25.340> there<00:03:25.489> was<00:03:25.580> 80

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:25.820 
like mono 43 where you know there was 80

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:27.610 
like mono 43 where you know there was 80
levels<00:03:26.239> they<00:03:26.450> didn't<00:03:26.750> take<00:03:26.900> a<00:03:27.140> buttload<00:03:27.560> of

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:27.620 
levels they didn't take a buttload of

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:29.949 
levels they didn't take a buttload of
time<00:03:27.890> to<00:03:28.130> level<00:03:28.310> up<00:03:28.519> once<00:03:28.760> but<00:03:29.420> I<00:03:29.450> can't<00:03:29.810> tell

00:03:29.949 --> 00:03:29.959 
time to level up once but I can't tell

00:03:29.959 --> 00:03:31.840 
time to level up once but I can't tell
you<00:03:30.140> it<00:03:30.320> is<00:03:30.350> worth<00:03:30.709> leveling<00:03:31.250> it<00:03:31.340> up<00:03:31.430> I'm<00:03:31.640> not

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:31.850 
you it is worth leveling it up I'm not

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:33.340 
you it is worth leveling it up I'm not
really<00:03:32.060> sure<00:03:32.180> if<00:03:32.390> it's<00:03:32.780> going<00:03:32.959> to<00:03:33.049> be<00:03:33.140> worth

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:33.350 
really sure if it's going to be worth

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:34.539 
really sure if it's going to be worth
prestiging<00:03:33.890> or<00:03:33.980> not<00:03:34.070> I'm<00:03:34.220> not<00:03:34.340> really<00:03:34.430> sure

00:03:34.539 --> 00:03:34.549 
prestiging or not I'm not really sure

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:36.280 
prestiging or not I'm not really sure
what<00:03:34.850> it<00:03:34.970> does<00:03:35.150> to<00:03:35.180> be<00:03:35.480> perfectly<00:03:35.930> honest<00:03:36.230> with

00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:36.290 
what it does to be perfectly honest with

00:03:36.290 --> 00:03:38.500 
what it does to be perfectly honest with
you<00:03:36.380> guys<00:03:36.590> I'm<00:03:37.100> actually<00:03:37.340> level<00:03:37.730> 55<00:03:38.120> right<00:03:38.360> now

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:38.510 
you guys I'm actually level 55 right now

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:39.699 
you guys I'm actually level 55 right now
and<00:03:38.690> I'm<00:03:38.780> probably<00:03:38.870> going<00:03:39.140> to<00:03:39.230> be<00:03:39.290> staying<00:03:39.560> at

00:03:39.699 --> 00:03:39.709 
and I'm probably going to be staying at

00:03:39.709 --> 00:03:41.620 
and I'm probably going to be staying at
that<00:03:39.860> level<00:03:40.040> because<00:03:40.489> I<00:03:40.760> don't<00:03:41.269> really<00:03:41.390> see<00:03:41.600> a

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:41.630 
that level because I don't really see a

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:43.240 
that level because I don't really see a
need<00:03:41.870> to<00:03:41.900> prestige<00:03:42.290> as<00:03:42.470> of<00:03:42.590> right<00:03:42.739> now<00:03:42.769> and<00:03:43.160> I

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:43.250 
need to prestige as of right now and I

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:44.710 
need to prestige as of right now and I
kind<00:03:43.459> of<00:03:43.519> want<00:03:43.670> to<00:03:43.700> keep<00:03:43.850> all<00:03:44.060> my<00:03:44.209> guns<00:03:44.450> and

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:44.720 
kind of want to keep all my guns and

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:46.240 
kind of want to keep all my guns and
perks<00:03:44.930> and<00:03:45.200> whatnots<00:03:45.470> all<00:03:45.709> the<00:03:45.799> killstreaks

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:46.250 
perks and whatnots all the killstreaks

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:48.280 
perks and whatnots all the killstreaks
that<00:03:46.400> I<00:03:46.430> have<00:03:46.549> unlocked<00:03:46.820> so<00:03:47.510> that's<00:03:48.080> wrong

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:48.290 
that I have unlocked so that's wrong

00:03:48.290 --> 00:03:50.410 
that I have unlocked so that's wrong
what<00:03:48.410> he's<00:03:48.500> doing<00:03:48.739> for<00:03:48.769> that<00:03:49.130> and<00:03:49.489> I<00:03:49.910> really

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:50.420 
what he's doing for that and I really

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:52.000 
what he's doing for that and I really
don't<00:03:50.690> think<00:03:50.780> it's<00:03:51.110> too<00:03:51.290> hard<00:03:51.470> to<00:03:51.530> level<00:03:51.769> up<00:03:51.860> it

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:52.010 
don't think it's too hard to level up it

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:54.100 
don't think it's too hard to level up it
took<00:03:52.130> me<00:03:52.280> about<00:03:52.400> 10<00:03:52.700> hours<00:03:52.820> of<00:03:52.970> gameplay<00:03:53.239> which

00:03:54.100 --> 00:03:54.110 
took me about 10 hours of gameplay which

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:55.780 
took me about 10 hours of gameplay which
actually<00:03:54.380> isn't<00:03:54.709> that<00:03:54.890> bad<00:03:55.010> for<00:03:55.220> an<00:03:55.519> entire

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:55.790 
actually isn't that bad for an entire

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:57.610 
actually isn't that bad for an entire
prestige<00:03:56.209> that's<00:03:56.480> just<00:03:56.660> my<00:03:56.780> opinion<00:03:56.810> so<00:03:57.410> the

00:03:57.610 --> 00:03:57.620 
prestige that's just my opinion so the

00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:58.990 
prestige that's just my opinion so the
next<00:03:57.739> question<00:03:57.860> is<00:03:58.220> what<00:03:58.850> are<00:03:58.970> the

00:03:58.990 --> 00:03:59.000 
next question is what are the

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.060 
next question is what are the
leaderboards<00:03:59.630> based<00:03:59.930> off<00:04:00.200> of<00:04:00.230> and<00:04:00.769> I'm

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:01.070 
leaderboards based off of and I'm

00:04:01.070 --> 00:04:02.380 
leaderboards based off of and I'm
actually<00:04:01.250> really<00:04:01.610> happy<00:04:01.760> to<00:04:02.120> say<00:04:02.360> that

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:02.390 
actually really happy to say that

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:04.420 
actually really happy to say that
they're<00:04:02.750> actually<00:04:02.930> based<00:04:03.440> off<00:04:03.709> of<00:04:03.739> score<00:04:04.280> per

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:04.430 
they're actually based off of score per

00:04:04.430 --> 00:04:05.920 
they're actually based off of score per
minute<00:04:04.700> which<00:04:04.850> is<00:04:05.060> definitely<00:04:05.540> better<00:04:05.810> than

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:05.930 
minute which is definitely better than

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:07.569 
minute which is definitely better than
of<00:04:06.140> woods<00:04:06.350> in<00:04:06.500> Morrow<00:04:06.739> for<00:04:06.830> three<00:04:07.040> we're

00:04:07.569 --> 00:04:07.579 
of woods in Morrow for three we're

00:04:07.579 --> 00:04:09.340 
of woods in Morrow for three we're
basically<00:04:08.060> if<00:04:08.420> you<00:04:08.540> played<00:04:08.810> the<00:04:08.930> game<00:04:09.110> like<00:04:09.140> a

00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:09.350 
basically if you played the game like a

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:11.590 
basically if you played the game like a
no<00:04:09.530> lifer<00:04:09.920> you<00:04:10.489> would<00:04:10.760> pretty<00:04:11.030> much<00:04:11.120> be<00:04:11.209> ranked

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:11.600 
no lifer you would pretty much be ranked

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:14.199 
no lifer you would pretty much be ranked
1<00:04:11.870> which<00:04:12.140> was<00:04:12.440> definitely<00:04:12.829> on<00:04:13.400> not<00:04:13.880> a<00:04:13.910> fair

00:04:14.199 --> 00:04:14.209 
1 which was definitely on not a fair

00:04:14.209 --> 00:04:15.850 
1 which was definitely on not a fair
leaderboard<00:04:14.870> system<00:04:15.200> in<00:04:15.290> my<00:04:15.410> opinion<00:04:15.680> that

00:04:15.850 --> 00:04:15.860 
leaderboard system in my opinion that

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:17.440 
leaderboard system in my opinion that
just<00:04:16.070> shows<00:04:16.250> how<00:04:16.519> much<00:04:16.850> you<00:04:16.910> play<00:04:17.150> the<00:04:17.269> game

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:17.450 
just shows how much you play the game

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:19.090 
just shows how much you play the game
now<00:04:18.019> with<00:04:18.229> score<00:04:18.470> per<00:04:18.560> minute<00:04:18.799> as<00:04:18.890> you<00:04:18.979> guys

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:19.100 
now with score per minute as you guys

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:21.099 
now with score per minute as you guys
know<00:04:19.130> it's<00:04:19.520> pretty<00:04:19.820> much<00:04:19.910> the<00:04:19.970> exact<00:04:20.630> same<00:04:20.870> as

00:04:21.099 --> 00:04:21.109 
know it's pretty much the exact same as

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:24.010 
know it's pretty much the exact same as
in<00:04:21.530> black<00:04:21.799> ops<00:04:22.010> 1<00:04:22.130> it<00:04:22.669> basically<00:04:23.180> shows<00:04:23.330> how

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:24.020 
in black ops 1 it basically shows how

00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:24.370 
in black ops 1 it basically shows how
many

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:24.380 
many

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:26.380 
many
or<00:04:24.770> how<00:04:25.010> much<00:04:25.130> score<00:04:25.460> you<00:04:25.580> can<00:04:25.730> get<00:04:25.880> per<00:04:26.090> minute

00:04:26.380 --> 00:04:26.390 
or how much score you can get per minute

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:27.910 
or how much score you can get per minute
so<00:04:26.690> I<00:04:26.870> definitely<00:04:27.290> think<00:04:27.470> that's<00:04:27.680> a<00:04:27.770> lot

00:04:27.910 --> 00:04:27.920 
so I definitely think that's a lot

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:29.440 
so I definitely think that's a lot
better<00:04:28.070> and<00:04:28.430> it's<00:04:28.550> actually<00:04:28.880> pretty<00:04:29.060> cool<00:04:29.270> I'm

00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:29.450 
better and it's actually pretty cool I'm

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:31.900 
better and it's actually pretty cool I'm
ranked<00:04:29.750> in<00:04:29.840> like<00:04:29.990> the<00:04:30.230> top<00:04:30.440> 300<00:04:31.100> for<00:04:31.550> black<00:04:31.730> ops

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:31.910 
ranked in like the top 300 for black ops

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:33.340 
ranked in like the top 300 for black ops
2<00:04:32.150> right<00:04:32.300> now<00:04:32.450> and<00:04:32.600> I<00:04:32.660> know<00:04:32.720> I<00:04:32.840> got<00:04:33.050> the<00:04:33.110> game

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:33.350 
2 right now and I know I got the game

00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:34.900 
2 right now and I know I got the game
early<00:04:33.380> and<00:04:33.650> everything<00:04:34.100> and<00:04:34.280> whatnot<00:04:34.580> but

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:34.910 
early and everything and whatnot but

00:04:34.910 --> 00:04:36.820 
early and everything and whatnot but
there's<00:04:35.540> still<00:04:35.690> it's<00:04:35.990> actually<00:04:36.350> quite<00:04:36.500> a<00:04:36.650> bit

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:36.830 
there's still it's actually quite a bit

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:38.110 
there's still it's actually quite a bit
of<00:04:36.920> people<00:04:37.190> that<00:04:37.340> have<00:04:37.370> the<00:04:37.610> game<00:04:37.760> early<00:04:37.790> I

00:04:38.110 --> 00:04:38.120 
of people that have the game early I

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:39.910 
of people that have the game early I
think<00:04:38.180> there's<00:04:38.510> like<00:04:38.570> 40,000<00:04:39.440> people<00:04:39.530> on<00:04:39.800> the

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:39.920 
think there's like 40,000 people on the

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:42.940 
think there's like 40,000 people on the
leaderboard<00:04:40.340> so<00:04:40.640> I<00:04:40.880> beat<00:04:41.360> out<00:04:41.510> about<00:04:41.950> 35,000

00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:42.950 
leaderboard so I beat out about 35,000

00:04:42.950 --> 00:04:43.990 
leaderboard so I beat out about 35,000
people<00:04:43.040> which<00:04:43.340> is<00:04:43.490> pretty<00:04:43.640> cool<00:04:43.850> in<00:04:43.970> my

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:44.000 
people which is pretty cool in my

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.480 
people which is pretty cool in my
opinion<00:04:44.090> even<00:04:44.840> though<00:04:45.200> the<00:04:45.530> game<00:04:45.830> still<00:04:46.250> isn't

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:46.490 
opinion even though the game still isn't

00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:47.830 
opinion even though the game still isn't
out<00:04:46.580> yet<00:04:46.610> or<00:04:46.820> anything<00:04:46.910> like<00:04:47.150> that<00:04:47.270> but<00:04:47.720> the

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:47.840 
out yet or anything like that but the

00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:49.330 
out yet or anything like that but the
thing<00:04:48.020> is<00:04:48.050> there's<00:04:48.350> a<00:04:48.410> lot<00:04:48.590> more<00:04:48.620> tryouts<00:04:49.160> on

00:04:49.330 --> 00:04:49.340 
thing is there's a lot more tryouts on

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:51.130 
thing is there's a lot more tryouts on
right<00:04:49.520> now<00:04:49.550> so<00:04:49.940> I<00:04:50.180> definitely<00:04:50.630> think<00:04:50.840> that<00:04:50.930> is

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:51.140 
right now so I definitely think that is

00:04:51.140 --> 00:04:52.900 
right now so I definitely think that is
pretty<00:04:51.320> impressive<00:04:51.410> then<00:04:52.040> the<00:04:52.250> next<00:04:52.760> question

00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:52.910 
pretty impressive then the next question

00:04:52.910 --> 00:04:54.100 
pretty impressive then the next question
is<00:04:53.270> and<00:04:53.420> this<00:04:53.480> is<00:04:53.540> probably<00:04:53.750> going<00:04:53.930> to<00:04:54.020> be<00:04:54.080> the

00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:54.110 
is and this is probably going to be the

00:04:54.110 --> 00:04:56.710 
is and this is probably going to be the
last<00:04:54.260> one<00:04:54.440> for<00:04:54.650> this<00:04:54.710> video<00:04:55.010> is<00:04:55.310> this<00:04:56.000> game<00:04:56.300> the

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:56.720 
last one for this video is this game the

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:58.390 
last one for this video is this game the
revival<00:04:57.290> of<00:04:57.350> cod<00:04:57.590> a<00:04:57.620> lot<00:04:58.010> of<00:04:58.100> people<00:04:58.220> are

00:04:58.390 --> 00:04:58.400 
revival of cod a lot of people are

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:00.220 
revival of cod a lot of people are
saying<00:04:58.580> that<00:04:58.790> cod<00:04:58.970> was<00:04:59.180> dying<00:04:59.450> out<00:04:59.660> after<00:05:00.020> mono

00:05:00.220 --> 00:05:00.230 
saying that cod was dying out after mono

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:03.220 
saying that cod was dying out after mono
or<00:05:00.380> 43<00:05:00.770> and<00:05:00.950> in<00:05:01.640> my<00:05:01.790> opinion<00:05:01.910> it<00:05:02.210> was<00:05:02.390> but<00:05:02.750> so

00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:03.230 
or 43 and in my opinion it was but so

00:05:03.230 --> 00:05:05.440 
or 43 and in my opinion it was but so
far<00:05:03.530> at<00:05:03.710> this<00:05:03.830> game<00:05:04.070> it<00:05:04.280> seems<00:05:04.640> to<00:05:04.790> be<00:05:05.090> one<00:05:05.360> of

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:05.450 
far at this game it seems to be one of

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:07.270 
far at this game it seems to be one of
the<00:05:05.510> most<00:05:05.630> balanced<00:05:06.110> games<00:05:06.290> to<00:05:06.470> date<00:05:06.650> there<00:05:07.100> is

00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:07.280 
the most balanced games to date there is

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:09.340 
the most balanced games to date there is
no<00:05:07.490> death<00:05:07.760> streaks<00:05:08.090> and<00:05:08.270> it's<00:05:08.780> so<00:05:09.020> weird

00:05:09.340 --> 00:05:09.350 
no death streaks and it's so weird

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:10.510 
no death streaks and it's so weird
playing<00:05:09.680> a<00:05:09.770> game<00:05:09.980> where<00:05:10.220> you<00:05:10.280> don't<00:05:10.400> have

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:10.520 
playing a game where you don't have

00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:12.580 
playing a game where you don't have
people<00:05:10.850> falling<00:05:11.330> on<00:05:11.570> their<00:05:11.690> ass<00:05:11.840> every<00:05:12.290> five

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:12.590 
people falling on their ass every five

00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:15.310 
people falling on their ass every five
minutes<00:05:12.920> just<00:05:13.240> you<00:05:14.240> know<00:05:14.360> block<00:05:14.660> shot<00:05:14.960> you<00:05:15.140> or

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:15.320 
minutes just you know block shot you or

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:17.440 
minutes just you know block shot you or
explode<00:05:15.950> you<00:05:16.130> in<00:05:16.220> den<00:05:16.400> man's<00:05:16.640> hand<00:05:16.940> so<00:05:17.180> I

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:17.450 
explode you in den man's hand so I

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:19.630 
explode you in den man's hand so I
definitely<00:05:18.020> think<00:05:18.290> it<00:05:18.590> may<00:05:18.830> actually<00:05:18.860> be<00:05:19.490> the

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:19.640 
definitely think it may actually be the

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:21.130 
definitely think it may actually be the
revival<00:05:20.090> of<00:05:20.150> cod<00:05:20.390> I've<00:05:20.540> actually<00:05:20.690> gotten<00:05:20.990> a

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:21.140 
revival of cod I've actually gotten a

00:05:21.140 --> 00:05:23.140
