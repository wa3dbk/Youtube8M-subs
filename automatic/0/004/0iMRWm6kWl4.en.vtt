00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:32.110 
the screw goes on real simple here now

00:03:32.110 --> 00:03:34.110 
the screw goes on real simple here now
the<00:03:32.590> next<00:03:32.920> problem<00:03:33.160> that<00:03:33.430> people<00:03:33.610> running<00:03:34.030> is

00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:34.120 
the next problem that people running is

a<00:03:38.829> problem<00:03:38.970> that<00:03:39.970> when<00:03:40.840> trying<00:03:41.200> to<00:03:41.320> screw<00:03:41.530> it

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:41.590 
a problem that when trying to screw it

00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:47.190 
a problem that when trying to screw it
back<00:03:41.709> on<00:03:42.010> the<00:03:42.959> whole<00:03:43.959> piece<00:03:44.440> of<00:03:44.709> the<00:03:46.079> you<00:03:47.079> know

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:47.200 
back on the whole piece of the you know

00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:51.120 
back on the whole piece of the you know
the<00:03:47.410> screw<00:03:47.859> end<00:03:48.040> of<00:03:48.220> the<00:03:49.620> ball<00:03:50.620> joint<00:03:50.859> upper

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:51.130 
the screw end of the ball joint upper

00:03:51.130 --> 00:03:53.750 
the screw end of the ball joint upper
ball<00:03:51.340> joint<00:03:51.370> will<00:03:52.060> start<00:03:52.390> to<00:03:52.540> move<00:03:52.810> completely

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760 
ball joint will start to move completely

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.250 
ball joint will start to move completely
so<00:03:54.760> then<00:03:54.940> you<00:03:55.090> you<00:03:55.299> just<00:03:55.540> you<00:03:55.810> can't<00:03:56.049> tighten

00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:56.260 
so then you you just you can't tighten

so then you you just you can't tighten
it<00:03:56.440> because<00:03:56.650> the<00:03:56.769> whole<00:03:56.890> thing<00:03:57.190> is<00:03:57.370> spinning

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:57.760 
it because the whole thing is spinning

00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:59.580 
it because the whole thing is spinning
as<00:03:58.060> you're<00:03:58.269> trying<00:03:58.450> to<00:03:58.540> tighten<00:03:58.720> it<00:03:58.930> alright

did is underneath here let's see if you

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:11.819 
did is underneath here let's see if you
can<00:04:09.130> see<00:04:09.310> that<00:04:09.549> they<00:04:09.910> put<00:04:10.440> see<00:04:11.440> that<00:04:11.620> right

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:11.829 
can see that they put see that right

00:04:11.829 --> 00:04:14.580 
can see that they put see that right
there<00:04:12.040> they<00:04:12.310> put<00:04:12.549> a<00:04:12.820> little<00:04:13.510> hole<00:04:13.870> where<00:04:14.440> you

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:17.620 
could use an allen key alright I've read

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:19.170 
could use an allen key alright I've read
online<00:04:17.769> they<00:04:18.190> said<00:04:18.459> you<00:04:18.609> could<00:04:18.760> use<00:04:18.789> the<00:04:19.150> the

online they said you could use the the

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:22.589 
online they said you could use the the
six<00:04:19.930> millimeter<00:04:20.459> alright<00:04:21.489> problem<00:04:22.270> is<00:04:22.390> I

00:04:22.589 --> 00:04:22.599 
six millimeter alright problem is I

00:04:22.599 --> 00:04:23.700 
six millimeter alright problem is I
don't<00:04:22.659> know<00:04:22.840> what<00:04:22.960> happened<00:04:23.229> to<00:04:23.289> mine<00:04:23.470> cuz<00:04:23.680> I

00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:23.710 
don't know what happened to mine cuz I

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:25.140 
don't know what happened to mine cuz I
know<00:04:23.770> I<00:04:23.890> didn't<00:04:24.099> do<00:04:24.159> any<00:04:24.310> damage<00:04:24.460> to<00:04:24.640> that<00:04:24.880> part

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:25.150 
know I didn't do any damage to that part

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:26.890 
know I didn't do any damage to that part
but<00:04:25.659> I<00:04:25.870> guess<00:04:26.080> over

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:26.900 
but I guess over

00:04:26.900 --> 00:04:30.370 
but I guess over
you<00:04:27.410> know<00:04:27.530> driving<00:04:28.120> rain<00:04:29.139> and<00:04:30.139> the<00:04:30.259> weather

00:04:30.370 --> 00:04:30.380 
you know driving rain and the weather

00:04:30.380 --> 00:04:32.320 
you know driving rain and the weather
conditions<00:04:31.009> it<00:04:31.190> starts<00:04:31.520> to<00:04:31.669> rust<00:04:31.880> under<00:04:32.210> there

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:32.330 
conditions it starts to rust under there

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:34.689 
conditions it starts to rust under there
so<00:04:32.810> when<00:04:32.930> I<00:04:32.960> tried<00:04:33.259> to<00:04:33.470> stick<00:04:33.770> my<00:04:34.100> allen<00:04:34.460> key<00:04:34.580> in

00:04:34.689 --> 00:04:34.699 
so when I tried to stick my allen key in

00:04:34.699 --> 00:04:35.080 
so when I tried to stick my allen key in
there

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:35.090 
there

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:37.870 
there
it<00:04:35.479> was<00:04:35.660> totally<00:04:36.050> stripped<00:04:36.410> you<00:04:37.190> know<00:04:37.310> and

00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:37.880 
it was totally stripped you know and

00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:39.670 
it was totally stripped you know and
like<00:04:38.060> I<00:04:38.150> said<00:04:38.210> I<00:04:38.330> never<00:04:38.449> hit<00:04:38.840> it<00:04:38.930> and<00:04:39.110> I<00:04:39.289> never

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:39.680 
like I said I never hit it and I never

00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:41.020 
like I said I never hit it and I never
hit<00:04:39.919> underneath<00:04:40.220> there<00:04:40.520> anything<00:04:40.729> like<00:04:40.970> that

00:04:41.020 --> 00:04:41.030 
hit underneath there anything like that

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:43.029 
hit underneath there anything like that
so<00:04:41.660> I<00:04:41.690> assumed<00:04:42.050> that<00:04:42.169> just<00:04:42.470> because<00:04:42.740> of<00:04:42.860> the

00:04:43.029 --> 00:04:43.039 
so I assumed that just because of the

00:04:43.039 --> 00:04:47.200 
so I assumed that just because of the
rust<00:04:44.020> it<00:04:45.020> got<00:04:45.229> you<00:04:45.530> know<00:04:45.560> just<00:04:45.860> got<00:04:46.210> weathered

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:47.210 
rust it got you know just got weathered

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:49.779 
rust it got you know just got weathered
and<00:04:47.360> worn<00:04:47.630> and<00:04:47.900> the<00:04:48.350> rust<00:04:48.560> just<00:04:49.190> ate<00:04:49.340> at<00:04:49.520> it<00:04:49.669> and

00:04:49.779 --> 00:04:49.789 
and worn and the rust just ate at it and

00:04:49.789 --> 00:04:51.159 
and worn and the rust just ate at it and
when<00:04:50.030> you<00:04:50.120> tried<00:04:50.270> to<00:04:50.300> stick<00:04:50.600> it<00:04:50.750> up<00:04:50.870> and<00:04:51.110> it

00:04:51.159 --> 00:04:51.169 
when you tried to stick it up and it

00:04:51.169 --> 00:04:53.800 
when you tried to stick it up and it
didn't<00:04:51.500> do<00:04:51.590> anything<00:04:51.770> so<00:04:52.580> now<00:04:53.300> if<00:04:53.690> that

00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:53.810 
didn't do anything so now if that

00:04:53.810 --> 00:04:54.999 
didn't do anything so now if that
happens<00:04:54.259> your<00:04:54.470> wonder<00:04:54.650> you're<00:04:54.770> like<00:04:54.860> well

00:04:54.999 --> 00:04:55.009 
happens your wonder you're like well

00:04:55.009 --> 00:04:56.890 
happens your wonder you're like well
what<00:04:55.039> can<00:04:55.250> you<00:04:55.310> do<00:04:55.460> once<00:04:55.759> again<00:04:56.030> instead<00:04:56.750> of

what can you do once again instead of

00:04:56.900 --> 00:04:59.290

00:06:06.339 --> 00:06:06.349 
key to work anymore the trip this tip

00:06:06.349 --> 00:06:07.930 
key to work anymore the trip this tip
that<00:06:06.380> I<00:06:06.560> like<00:06:06.770> anything<00:06:07.220> is<00:06:07.340> worth<00:06:07.520> it<00:06:07.729> worked

00:06:07.930 --> 00:06:07.940 
that I like anything is worth it worked

00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:12.870 
that I like anything is worth it worked
is<00:06:08.180> to<00:06:08.419> take<00:06:08.630> the<00:06:08.780> c-clamp<00:06:09.250> here<00:06:10.360> all<00:06:11.360> right

00:06:12.870 --> 00:06:12.880 
is to take the c-clamp here all right

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:16.210 
is to take the c-clamp here all right
and<00:06:14.110> make<00:06:15.110> sure<00:06:15.289> you're<00:06:15.620> gonna<00:06:15.710> need<00:06:15.979> it<00:06:16.099> like

00:06:16.210 --> 00:06:16.220 
and make sure you're gonna need it like

00:06:16.220 --> 00:06:17.830 
and make sure you're gonna need it like
it<00:06:16.400> is<00:06:16.759> you<00:06:16.880> have<00:06:17.210> to<00:06:17.240> get<00:06:17.479> it<00:06:17.569> like<00:06:17.690> this

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:17.840 
it is you have to get it like this

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:19.480 
it is you have to get it like this
because<00:06:18.020> if<00:06:18.289> you<00:06:18.349> keep<00:06:18.530> the<00:06:18.650> flat<00:06:18.889> end<00:06:19.099> it

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:19.490 
because if you keep the flat end it

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:21.490 
because if you keep the flat end it
won't<00:06:19.669> work<00:06:19.910> so<00:06:20.150> you<00:06:20.449> need<00:06:20.630> to<00:06:20.780> get<00:06:20.960> that<00:06:21.110> piece

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:21.500 
won't work so you need to get that piece

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:25.180 
won't work so you need to get that piece
to<00:06:22.160> stick<00:06:22.430> up<00:06:22.639> in<00:06:22.910> there<00:06:23.360> like<00:06:23.599> that<00:06:23.630> okay<00:06:24.190> see

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:25.190 
to stick up in there like that okay see

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:27.219 
to stick up in there like that okay see
that<00:06:25.340> that's<00:06:25.550> gonna<00:06:25.729> go<00:06:25.910> in<00:06:26.150> there<00:06:26.419> and<00:06:26.960> you

00:06:27.219 --> 00:06:27.229 
that that's gonna go in there and you

00:06:27.229 --> 00:06:30.999 
that that's gonna go in there and you
clamp<00:06:27.560> down<00:06:27.650> on<00:06:28.580> the<00:06:29.090> on<00:06:29.780> this<00:06:30.169> ball<00:06:30.740> joint

00:06:30.999 --> 00:06:31.009 
clamp down on the on this ball joint

00:06:31.009 --> 00:06:33.730 
clamp down on the on this ball joint
right<00:06:31.729> here<00:06:31.970> okay<00:06:32.960> and<00:06:32.990> as<00:06:33.229> you<00:06:33.349> clamp<00:06:33.650> down

00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:33.740 
right here okay and as you clamp down

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:37.680 
right here okay and as you clamp down
it'll<00:06:34.699> then<00:06:34.910> hold<00:06:35.330> that<00:06:35.919> that<00:06:36.919> screw<00:06:37.280> and

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:37.690 
it'll then hold that that screw and

00:06:37.690 --> 00:06:41.129 
it'll then hold that that screw and
firmly<00:06:38.690> so<00:06:39.470> then<00:06:39.680> you<00:06:39.830> can<00:06:40.009> tighten<00:06:40.220> the

00:06:41.129 --> 00:06:41.139 
firmly so then you can tighten the

00:06:41.139 --> 00:06:43.839 
firmly so then you can tighten the
screws<00:06:42.139> right<00:06:42.650> here<00:06:42.680> they're<00:06:43.130> much<00:06:43.400> easier

00:06:43.839 --> 00:06:43.849 
screws right here they're much easier

00:06:43.849 --> 00:06:47.010 
screws right here they're much easier
quicker<00:06:44.659> like<00:06:45.620> I<00:06:45.740> said<00:06:45.889> just<00:06:45.919> get<00:06:46.220> the<00:06:46.370> c-clamp

00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:47.020 
quicker like I said just get the c-clamp

00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:49.480 
quicker like I said just get the c-clamp
break<00:06:48.020> off<00:06:48.229> the<00:06:48.409> flat<00:06:48.650> end<00:06:48.860> part<00:06:49.099> so<00:06:49.280> that<00:06:49.400> way

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:49.490 
break off the flat end part so that way

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:52.770 
break off the flat end part so that way
it<00:06:49.550> can<00:06:49.610> fit<00:06:49.880> underneath<00:06:50.409> you<00:06:51.409> know<00:06:51.440> the<00:06:52.280> nut

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:52.780 
it can fit underneath you know the nut

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:55.990 
it can fit underneath you know the nut
clamped<00:06:53.780> down<00:06:53.810> and<00:06:54.520> you<00:06:55.520> know<00:06:55.639> tighten<00:06:55.940> the

00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:56.000 
clamped down and you know tighten the

00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.070 
clamped down and you know tighten the
clamp<00:06:56.300> and<00:06:56.599> it'll<00:06:57.199> hold<00:06:57.349> the<00:06:57.970> you<00:06:58.970> know<00:06:59.150> the

00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:00.080 
clamp and it'll hold the you know the

00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:03.490 
clamp and it'll hold the you know the
receptacle<00:07:00.650> area<00:07:01.419> in<00:07:02.419> place<00:07:02.720> while<00:07:03.229> you

receptacle area in place while you
tighten<00:07:04.070> this<00:07:04.430> is<00:07:04.580> how<00:07:04.669> you<00:07:04.729> would<00:07:04.940> screw<00:07:05.330> it

00:07:05.439 --> 00:07:05.449 
tighten this is how you would screw it

00:07:05.449 --> 00:07:07.120 
tighten this is how you would screw it
all<00:07:05.570> together<00:07:05.690> or<00:07:06.080> if<00:07:06.229> you<00:07:06.590> have<00:07:06.710> to<00:07:06.830> take<00:07:07.009> it
