and<00:01:12.350> I'm<00:01:13.310> not<00:01:13.850> too<00:01:14.120> happy<00:01:14.360> about<00:01:14.570> that<00:01:15.430> I'm<00:01:16.430> not

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:16.790 
and I'm not too happy about that I'm not

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:19.210 
and I'm not too happy about that I'm not
exactly<00:01:17.240> sure<00:01:17.480> how<00:01:17.900> accurate<00:01:17.930> the<00:01:18.710> four<00:01:18.950> pound

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:19.220 
exactly sure how accurate the four pound

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:23.440 
exactly sure how accurate the four pound
gained<00:01:19.490> was<00:01:21.580> because<00:01:22.580> there<00:01:23.030> was<00:01:23.150> a<00:01:23.210> couple

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:23.450 
gained was because there was a couple

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:27.490 
gained was because there was a couple
factors<00:01:24.020> that<00:01:24.500> probably<00:01:25.040> wait<00:01:25.280> on<00:01:25.490> me<00:01:26.320> and<00:01:27.320> I'm

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:27.500 
factors that probably wait on me and I'm

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:29.950 
factors that probably wait on me and I'm
not<00:01:27.530> going<00:01:27.800> to<00:01:27.890> make<00:01:27.980> excuses<00:01:28.700> but<00:01:28.760> just<00:01:29.690> to

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:29.960 
not going to make excuses but just to

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:35.140 
not going to make excuses but just to
put<00:01:30.170> it<00:01:30.260> out<00:01:30.350> there<00:01:31.390> first<00:01:32.390> I<00:01:33.100> didn't<00:01:34.100> track<00:01:34.280> at

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:35.150 
put it out there first I didn't track at

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:39.810 
put it out there first I didn't track at
all<00:01:35.330> I<00:01:35.660> didn't<00:01:36.229> do<00:01:36.320> weight<00:01:36.440> watchers<00:01:36.490> and

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:39.820 

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:44.290 

that<00:01:40.390> is<00:01:40.720> definitely

00:01:44.290 --> 00:01:44.300 

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:49.060 

something<00:01:44.930> that<00:01:45.080> will<00:01:45.230> do<00:01:45.380> it<00:01:46.390> but

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:49.070 
something that will do it but

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:52.300 
something that will do it but

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:14.690 
because we're out and so and it was kind

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:16.990 
because we're out and so and it was kind
of<00:02:14.810> a<00:02:14.990> heavy<00:02:15.260> dinner<00:02:15.560> so

00:02:16.990 --> 00:02:17.000 
of a heavy dinner so

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.730 
of a heavy dinner so
and<00:02:17.390> then<00:02:17.720> also<00:02:17.930> I<00:02:18.410> did<00:02:18.530> where<00:02:18.950> my<00:02:19.250> work<00:02:20.120> jeans

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:20.740 
and then also I did where my work jeans

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:23.410 
and then also I did where my work jeans
to<00:02:21.740> weigh<00:02:21.980> in<00:02:22.190> and<00:02:22.580> those<00:02:22.790> are<00:02:22.970> pretty<00:02:23.120> heavy

00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:23.420 
to weigh in and those are pretty heavy

00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:26.470 
to weigh in and those are pretty heavy
so<00:02:23.870> I'm<00:02:24.320> thinking<00:02:25.280> maybe<00:02:25.460> a<00:02:25.640> two<00:02:25.880> pound<00:02:26.120> gained

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480 
so I'm thinking maybe a two pound gained

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:30.030 
so I'm thinking maybe a two pound gained
not<00:02:27.050> quite<00:02:27.380> a<00:02:27.410> four<00:02:28.360> we<00:02:29.360> all<00:02:29.450> know<00:02:29.660> how

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:30.040 
not quite a four we all know how

00:02:30.040 --> 00:02:34.690 
not quite a four we all know how
different<00:02:31.040> factors<00:02:31.490> weigh<00:02:31.820> in<00:02:32.000> on<00:02:32.120> us<00:02:32.530> when

00:02:34.690 --> 00:02:34.700 
different factors weigh in on us when

00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:37.819 
certain circumstances will make us way

00:02:37.819 --> 00:02:42.390 
certain circumstances will make us way
in<00:02:38.050> more<00:02:39.050> some<00:02:39.739> days<00:02:40.750> excuse<00:02:41.750> my<00:02:41.870> appearance
