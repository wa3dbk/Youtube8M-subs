which is a new rendition of my old most
popular<00:00:43.500> ride<00:00:43.650> the<00:00:43.890> sledgehammer<00:00:44.430> it

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:44.730 
popular ride the sledgehammer it

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:46.280 
popular ride the sledgehammer it
actually<00:00:45.180> isn't<00:00:45.360> called<00:00:45.690> the<00:00:45.810> sledgehammer

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:46.290 
actually isn't called the sledgehammer

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:48.530 
actually isn't called the sledgehammer
which<00:00:46.830> I<00:00:47.040> put<00:00:47.460> more<00:00:47.640> research<00:00:47.970> into<00:00:48.180> it

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:48.540 
which I put more research into it

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:50.690 
which I put more research into it
but<00:00:48.840> it's<00:00:48.960> actually<00:00:49.410> called<00:00:49.560> a<00:00:49.770> Raider<00:00:50.040> which

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:50.700 
but it's actually called a Raider which

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.299 
but it's actually called a Raider which
is<00:00:50.850> by<00:00:50.970> HUS<00:00:51.210> but<00:00:51.510> you<00:00:51.870> know<00:00:52.020> what<00:00:52.190> screw<00:00:53.190> the

is by HUS but you know what screw the
names<00:00:53.520> let's<00:00:54.000> go<00:00:54.180> on<00:00:54.420> to<00:00:54.630> the<00:00:54.720> action<00:00:55.140> so<00:00:55.530> many

00:00:55.729 --> 00:00:55.739 
names let's go on to the action so many

00:00:55.739 --> 00:00:57.950 
names let's go on to the action so many
of<00:00:55.890> you<00:00:56.010> have<00:00:56.220> been<00:00:56.340> asking<00:00:56.970> for<00:00:57.510> me<00:00:57.660> to<00:00:57.690> ride

00:00:57.950 --> 00:00:57.960 
of you have been asking for me to ride

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.590 
of you have been asking for me to ride
the<00:00:58.140> ride<00:00:58.320> but<00:00:58.830> I<00:00:59.010> obviously<00:00:59.610> explained<00:01:00.210> that

00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:00.600 
the ride but I obviously explained that

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:02.660 
the ride but I obviously explained that
it<00:01:00.809> was<00:01:00.960> really<00:01:01.380> glitchy<00:01:01.620> but<00:01:02.010> I'm<00:01:02.250> gonna<00:01:02.580> do

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:02.670 
it was really glitchy but I'm gonna do

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:04.790 
it was really glitchy but I'm gonna do
it<00:01:02.790> anyways<00:01:03.210> screw<00:01:03.900> the<00:01:03.960> logic<00:01:04.440> screw

everything<00:01:05.100> minecraft<00:01:05.550> you<00:01:06.270> better<00:01:06.600> deal

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:06.960 
everything minecraft you better deal

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.200 
everything minecraft you better deal
with<00:01:06.990> it<00:01:07.350> because<00:01:07.650> I<00:01:08.040> am<00:01:08.220> going<00:01:08.250> to<00:01:08.670> ride<00:01:08.970> the

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210 
with it because I am going to ride the

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.150 
with it because I am going to ride the
sledgehammer<00:01:09.780> so<00:01:10.080> I'll<00:01:10.229> go<00:01:10.380> into<00:01:10.619> more<00:01:10.800> detail

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:11.160 
sledgehammer so I'll go into more detail

00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:12.890 
sledgehammer so I'll go into more detail
on<00:01:11.190> how<00:01:11.369> it<00:01:11.610> works<00:01:11.820> in<00:01:12.060> a<00:01:12.330> second<00:01:12.750> it<00:01:12.840> is

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:12.900 
on how it works in a second it is

00:01:12.900 --> 00:01:15.620 
on how it works in a second it is
actually<00:01:13.560> much<00:01:13.800> much<00:01:14.160> more<00:01:14.490> simple<00:01:15.000> than<00:01:15.390> my

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:15.630 
actually much much more simple than my

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.780 
actually much much more simple than my
old<00:01:15.900> rendition<00:01:16.590> of<00:01:16.770> the<00:01:17.040> sledgehammer<00:01:17.460> ride

00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:17.790 
old rendition of the sledgehammer ride

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:19.490 
old rendition of the sledgehammer ride
which<00:01:18.300> I'll<00:01:18.509> just<00:01:18.660> call<00:01:18.840> this<00:01:18.990> lunch<00:01:19.170> and<00:01:19.440> my

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
which I'll just call this lunch and my

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:22.280 
which I'll just call this lunch and my
ride<00:01:19.710> from<00:01:19.920> now<00:01:20.070> on<00:01:20.220> but<00:01:20.580> I<00:01:20.790> mean<00:01:21.090> this<00:01:21.750> new

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:22.290 
ride from now on but I mean this new

00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:24.800 
ride from now on but I mean this new
version<00:01:22.800> only<00:01:23.280> has<00:01:23.400> one<00:01:23.700> lever<00:01:23.970> it<00:01:24.300> has

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:24.810 
version only has one lever it has

00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:26.749 
version only has one lever it has
nothing<00:01:25.290> else<00:01:25.380> the<00:01:25.740> old<00:01:25.950> version<00:01:26.369> had<00:01:26.550> like

00:01:26.749 --> 00:01:26.759 
nothing else the old version had like

00:01:26.759 --> 00:01:28.730 
nothing else the old version had like
this<00:01:26.970> huge<00:01:27.240> control<00:01:27.720> box<00:01:27.990> which<00:01:28.320> had<00:01:28.530> like

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:28.740 
this huge control box which had like

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:31.010 
this huge control box which had like
very<00:01:29.250> confusing<00:01:29.850> controls<00:01:30.390> and<00:01:30.630> I<00:01:30.720> couldn't

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020 
very confusing controls and I couldn't

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.530 
very confusing controls and I couldn't
get<00:01:31.170> it<00:01:31.500> to<00:01:31.800> work<00:01:31.830> so<00:01:32.220> right<00:01:32.399> now<00:01:32.850> only<00:01:33.210> has<00:01:33.300> one

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
get it to work so right now only has one

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.109 
get it to work so right now only has one
lever<00:01:33.750> to<00:01:34.290> make<00:01:34.410> it<00:01:34.560> go<00:01:34.680> around<00:01:34.800> on<00:01:35.160> and<00:01:35.580> off<00:01:35.670> so

00:01:36.109 --> 00:01:36.119 
lever to make it go around on and off so

00:01:36.119 --> 00:01:37.609 
lever to make it go around on and off so
how<00:01:36.360> it<00:01:36.479> works<00:01:36.540> is<00:01:36.810> that<00:01:36.990> there's<00:01:37.320> one

00:01:37.609 --> 00:01:37.619 
how it works is that there's one

00:01:37.619 --> 00:01:40.249 
how it works is that there's one
redstone<00:01:38.009> wire<00:01:38.490> that<00:01:38.700> goes<00:01:38.910> down<00:01:39.119> from<00:01:39.780> here

00:01:40.249 --> 00:01:40.259 
redstone wire that goes down from here

00:01:40.259 --> 00:01:42.169 
redstone wire that goes down from here
all<00:01:40.440> the<00:01:40.500> way<00:01:40.950> up<00:01:41.280> the<00:01:41.490> tower<00:01:41.670> through<00:01:42.149> a

00:01:42.169 --> 00:01:42.179 
all the way up the tower through a

00:01:42.179 --> 00:01:44.389 
all the way up the tower through a
pillar<00:01:42.780> of<00:01:42.960> redstone<00:01:43.380> torches<00:01:43.770> and<00:01:44.009> as<00:01:44.250> you

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
pillar of redstone torches and as you

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.550 
pillar of redstone torches and as you
can<00:01:44.520> see<00:01:44.789> it<00:01:45.060> actually<00:01:45.539> hits<00:01:45.810> the<00:01:45.960> rotation

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560 
can see it actually hits the rotation

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.350 
can see it actually hits the rotation
block<00:01:46.770> which<00:01:47.039> turns<00:01:47.369> it<00:01:47.520> around<00:01:47.610> but<00:01:48.240> the

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360 
block which turns it around but the

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.270 
block which turns it around but the
thing<00:01:48.569> is<00:01:48.600> there<00:01:49.020> are<00:01:49.050> insulator<00:01:49.800> blocks<00:01:50.100> to

00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:50.280 
thing is there are insulator blocks to

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:52.279 
thing is there are insulator blocks to
prevent<00:01:50.729> the<00:01:50.940> whole<00:01:51.179> thing<00:01:51.509> from<00:01:51.780> like

00:01:52.279 --> 00:01:52.289 
prevent the whole thing from like

00:01:52.289 --> 00:01:55.190 
prevent the whole thing from like
messing<00:01:52.800> up<00:01:52.950> and<00:01:53.190> not<00:01:53.850> working<00:01:54.300> it<00:01:54.690> is<00:01:54.929> very

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:55.200 
messing up and not working it is very

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.020 
messing up and not working it is very
simple<00:01:55.530> there<00:01:55.860> are<00:01:55.890> no<00:01:56.069> complex<00:01:56.459> redstone

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:57.030 
simple there are no complex redstone

00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.520 
simple there are no complex redstone
circuits<00:01:57.390> and<00:01:57.569> almost<00:01:57.869> anybody<00:01:58.080> can<00:01:58.259> make<00:01:58.470> it

00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:58.530 
circuits and almost anybody can make it

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:01.430 
circuits and almost anybody can make it
with<00:01:58.740> Google<00:01:58.950> crap<00:01:59.250> and<00:01:59.690> here<00:02:00.690> we<00:02:00.840> are<00:02:00.869> ladies

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:01.440 
with Google crap and here we are ladies

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:03.350 
with Google crap and here we are ladies
and<00:02:01.470> gentlemen<00:02:01.679> the<00:02:02.610> moment<00:02:02.850> you've<00:02:03.060> all<00:02:03.300> been

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
and gentlemen the moment you've all been

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.809 
and gentlemen the moment you've all been
waiting<00:02:03.600> for<00:02:03.899> I<00:02:04.229> am<00:02:04.410> going<00:02:04.709> to<00:02:04.830> actually<00:02:05.520> ride

00:02:05.809 --> 00:02:05.819 
waiting for I am going to actually ride

00:02:05.819 --> 00:02:08.749 
waiting for I am going to actually ride
the<00:02:06.330> sledgehammer<00:02:07.050> so<00:02:07.709> let's<00:02:08.340> press<00:02:08.550> that

00:02:08.749 --> 00:02:08.759 
the sledgehammer so let's press that

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.990 
the sledgehammer so let's press that
lever<00:02:08.970> let's<00:02:09.479> go<00:02:09.780> boom<00:02:10.560> okay<00:02:11.490> so<00:02:11.550> we're

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000 
lever let's go boom okay so we're

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.610 
lever let's go boom okay so we're
obviously<00:02:12.180> going<00:02:12.720> glitch<00:02:12.990> out<00:02:13.170> of<00:02:13.260> this<00:02:13.410> thing

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:13.620 
obviously going glitch out of this thing

00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.559 
obviously going glitch out of this thing
because<00:02:13.770> I've<00:02:14.100> already<00:02:14.459> told<00:02:14.730> you<00:02:14.940> a<00:02:14.970> billion

00:02:15.559 --> 00:02:15.569 
because I've already told you a billion
