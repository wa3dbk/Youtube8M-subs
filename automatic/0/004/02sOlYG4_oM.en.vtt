one inch shaft we have my two five key

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.509 
one inch shaft we have my two five key
way<00:00:22.560> so<00:00:23.340> um<00:00:23.670> so<00:00:24.630> when<00:00:24.990> I<00:00:25.019> mentioned<00:00:25.519> split

00:00:26.509 --> 00:00:26.519 
way so um so when I mentioned split

00:00:26.519 --> 00:00:30.220 
way so um so when I mentioned split
jackshaft<00:00:27.019> see<00:00:28.019> my<00:00:28.170> secondary<00:00:29.130> sheets<00:00:29.789> and

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:30.230 
jackshaft see my secondary sheets and

00:00:30.230 --> 00:00:32.870 
jackshaft see my secondary sheets and
that<00:00:31.230> whole<00:00:31.529> assembly<00:00:31.710> that<00:00:32.250> secondary<00:00:32.669> she

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880 
that whole assembly that secondary she

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.270 
that whole assembly that secondary she
assembly<00:00:33.329> spring-loaded<00:00:34.020> so<00:00:34.770> those<00:00:34.980> that

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:35.280 
assembly spring-loaded so those that

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.310 
assembly spring-loaded so those that
will<00:00:35.430> separate<00:00:35.940> in<00:00:36.239> if<00:00:36.510> he<00:00:36.630> and<00:00:36.840> if<00:00:36.960> you<00:00:37.079> use

00:00:37.310 --> 00:00:37.320 
will separate in if he and if you use

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.619

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:40.180 
so that's a split jackshaft

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:41.880 
so that's a split jackshaft
and<00:01:40.360> the<00:01:40.900> purpose<00:01:41.170> of<00:01:41.290> that<00:01:41.350> is<00:01:41.470> so<00:01:41.560> that<00:01:41.830> you

that with a standard key way and that
matches<00:02:40.540> the<00:02:40.900> engine<00:02:41.230> that's<00:02:41.440> what<00:02:41.620> I<00:02:41.680> did<00:02:41.920> now

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:43.560 
matches the engine that's what I did now

dimensions<00:03:09.310> you<00:03:09.970> know<00:03:10.060> I<00:03:10.120> made<00:03:10.300> the<00:03:10.420> bore<00:03:10.630> a

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:10.900 
dimensions you know I made the bore a

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:15.120 
dimensions you know I made the bore a
little<00:03:11.260> bit<00:03:12.480> wider<00:03:13.480> and<00:03:13.870> then<00:03:14.560> you<00:03:14.860> know<00:03:14.950> these

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:15.130 
little bit wider and then you know these

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:17.790 
little bit wider and then you know these
average<00:03:15.910> holes<00:03:16.209> in<00:03:17.140> each<00:03:17.290> of<00:03:17.470> those<00:03:17.590> a<00:03:17.650> little

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:17.800 
average holes in each of those a little

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:21.270 
average holes in each of those a little
wider<00:03:18.130> than<00:03:18.400> they<00:03:19.000> have<00:03:19.150> a<00:03:19.299> chest<00:03:19.750> or<00:03:19.840> copy<00:03:20.280> so

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:21.280 
wider than they have a chest or copy so

00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:24.470 
wider than they have a chest or copy so
I<00:03:21.310> added<00:03:21.790> you'll<00:03:22.570> have<00:03:22.720> to<00:03:22.810> add<00:03:22.989> or<00:03:23.440> remove

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:24.480 
I added you'll have to add or remove

00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.789 
I added you'll have to add or remove
discs<00:03:25.480> you<00:03:25.570> know<00:03:25.690> a<00:03:25.870> lot<00:03:26.080> of<00:03:26.230> disks<00:03:26.560> is<00:03:26.650> going

00:03:26.789 --> 00:03:26.799 
discs you know a lot of disks is going

00:03:26.799 --> 00:03:28.979 
discs you know a lot of disks is going
to<00:03:26.860> be<00:03:26.950> slower<00:03:27.220> speed<00:03:27.640> but<00:03:28.269> this<00:03:28.540> is<00:03:28.780> going<00:03:28.900> to

00:03:28.979 --> 00:03:28.989 
to be slower speed but this is going to

00:03:28.989 --> 00:03:30.330 
to be slower speed but this is going to
be<00:03:29.049> a<00:03:29.080> faster<00:03:29.500> speed<00:03:29.620> if<00:03:29.890> you<00:03:29.950> have<00:03:30.070> a<00:03:30.100> patient

00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:30.340 
be a faster speed if you have a patient

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:35.039 
be a faster speed if you have a patient
yet<00:03:31.350> with<00:03:32.350> the<00:03:32.470> gear<00:03:32.680> ratio<00:03:33.070> and<00:03:33.450> and<00:03:34.450> it's

00:03:35.039 --> 00:03:35.049 
yet with the gear ratio and and it's

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:35.820 
yet with the gear ratio and and it's
trial<00:03:35.320> and<00:03:35.500> error

00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:35.830 
trial and error

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:40.340 
trial and error
now<00:03:36.400> I<00:03:36.820> welded<00:03:37.540> the<00:03:38.080> bolts<00:03:38.440> onto<00:03:38.680> this<00:03:39.040> stuff

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:40.350 
now I welded the bolts onto this stuff

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:44.400 
now I welded the bolts onto this stuff
this<00:03:41.350> side<00:03:41.650> the<00:03:42.310> sheave<00:03:42.580> that's<00:03:42.940> the<00:03:43.410> receive

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:44.410 
this side the sheave that's the receive

00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:47.910 
this side the sheave that's the receive
half<00:03:44.620> that's<00:03:44.859> closer<00:03:45.160> to<00:03:45.430> the<00:03:45.519> engine<00:03:45.880> and<00:03:46.920> so

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:47.920 
half that's closer to the engine and so

00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:48.960 
half that's closer to the engine and so
the<00:03:48.040> whole<00:03:48.190> thing<00:03:48.430> just<00:03:48.549> kind<00:03:48.639> of<00:03:48.820> like

00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:48.970 
the whole thing just kind of like

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:50.220 
the whole thing just kind of like
separates<00:03:49.450> and<00:03:49.630> what<00:03:49.750> I<00:03:49.780> do

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:50.230 
separates and what I do

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:51.390 
separates and what I do
separate<00:03:50.500> it<00:03:50.590> when<00:03:50.709> I<00:03:50.739> need<00:03:50.950> to<00:03:51.010> separate<00:03:51.340> it

00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:51.400 
separate it when I need to separate it

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:55.440 
separate it when I need to separate it
is<00:03:51.700> I<00:03:52.450> I<00:03:52.569> apply<00:03:53.319> my<00:03:53.830> big<00:03:54.040> fat<00:03:54.250> tie<00:03:54.430> down<00:03:54.700> yank

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:55.450 
is I I apply my big fat tie down yank

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:07.450 
bolts and then the whole thing will just

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:08.670 
bolts and then the whole thing will just
separate<00:04:08.019> for<00:04:08.319> you
