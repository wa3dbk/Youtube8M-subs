00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:06.160
 developing voices to the mission let's start like everywhere else 

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:10.100
 by the harvest period the routing of the grapes shot 

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:14.009
 for you to be vinification samantha sion alcoholic casting 

00:00:14.649 --> 00:00:18.500
 pressing second fermentation malolactic fermentation 

00:00:19.499 --> 00:00:22.599
 then comes the assembly time 

00:00:22.599 --> 00:00:26.359
 period during which we try to determine the best assembly 

00:00:26.359 --> 00:00:28.550
 possible in the year 

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:32.619
 it is necessary that this assembly decided and the descent in barrels intervenes and 

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:35.780
 starts breeding 18 or 20 months 

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:39.480
 following the wines period during which we come to visit 

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.480
 her husband 

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.960
 the purpose of the work that was done recently 

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:56.880
 the head of the mission 

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:59.210
 give me perfect consistency 

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:00.810
 another production tool 

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:05.300
 for some architectural aspect is important but where the technical specs 

00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:10.010
 everything to keep one in the best conditions just as much 

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.190
 constant temperature air conditioning 

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:16.470
 ventilation without excess 

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:19.470
 as well as looking for a constant upward visit 

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:24.300
 but for the principles the elements 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:27.920
 our philosophy 

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:32.600
 winemaking period as well as lifting to mission brio consists 

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:38.110
 to know how to adapt and adapt to the reserves that we have to harvest% of 

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:40.230
 same as during the breeding period 

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:43.350
 we are trying to pick up sony 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:48.300
 work but it's a job 

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:49.640
 the mythical 

00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:54.440
 neat that requires patience a bit like so these Benedictine monks 

00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.900
 who by dint of 

00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:00.070
 as a basic health assistant
