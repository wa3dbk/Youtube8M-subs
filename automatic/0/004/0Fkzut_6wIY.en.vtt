00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.529
 every day at the same time they 

00:00:02.520 --> 00:00:07.109
 appear on city streets 

00:00:04.529 --> 00:00:08.880
 you notice some at the bus stop others already 

00:00:07.109 --> 00:00:11.730
 filled with public transportation and 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:14.519
 cars a couple more hours and work day 

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:17.160
 for millions will begin and most of 

00:00:14.519 --> 00:00:18.630
 they will be greeted with a swollen face 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.970
 and only Komi under the eyes 

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:23.220
 cheerful evening and sleepless nights on the eve 

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:24.600
 may be nothing to do with 

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:26.880
 early manifestation of venous 

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:28.890
 cerebral vascular insufficiency 

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:31.380
 such a state may well 

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:34.170
 provoke developmental reasons 

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:37.110
 venous insufficiency of the brain 

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:42.090
 It includes a number of factors such as 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:44.850
 compression of veins and large venous sinuses 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:49.940
 in the brain by various processes 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:52.800
 trauma fields also 

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:55.379
 the process proceeds inside the venous 

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:59.640
 vessels resulting in reduced speed 

00:00:55.379 --> 00:01:03.840
 blood flow to blood formation 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:07.670
 clots and overlap lumen and venous 

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:09.920
 vessels can enter here and violation 

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:13.950
 of cardio-vascular system 

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:15.080
 accompanied by an increase in pressure 

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:16.850
 venous system 

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:18.860
 detect in a blood clot or another 

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:20.600
 brain formation is possible 

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:23.080
 thanks to a certain method 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:25.430
 diagnostic examinations 

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:27.980
 venous insufficiency of the brain 

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:31.250
 relate to whom I am diagnosed and 

00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:33.830
 Moget resonant on the graph I Olginskaya 

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:36.520
 computed tomographic angiography 

00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:38.780
 Well, in rare cases of use 

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:39.560
 contrasting Ilinsky and selective 

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:41.060
 angiography 

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:44.600
 magnetic resonance application 

00:01:41.060 --> 00:01:46.160
 tomography allows you to see the processes 

00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:48.590
 occurring brain when 

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:52.970
 impaired venous outflow 

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:56.360
 this and save the waterlogging head 

00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:58.760
 brain and guilty clifford and in rare 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:05.290
 cases to me I am not who arise 

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:08.360
 in the zone of violation of the outflow and vein thrombosis 

00:02:05.290 --> 00:02:11.090
 sinuses also during the MRI 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:13.220
 can detect changes received 

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:16.090
 for example due to any injury 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:20.290
 example two years ago I had an injury 

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:22.209
 than we have come and broke his head 2 place 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:26.180
 after that 

00:02:22.209 --> 00:02:30.620
 headaches were to sign 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:32.600
 i usually took regular pictures there 

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:38.540
 showed nothing my main fight 

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:41.209
 continued so I shake my girlfriend 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:44.120
 I learned that there is such a procedure 

00:02:41.209 --> 00:02:46.450
 now decided to protest many 3 per nation 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:51.430
 tomography has a wide range 

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:54.680
 methods allowing to see the structure 

00:02:51.430 --> 00:03:00.370
 followed by particular head organs 

00:02:54.680 --> 00:03:03.340
 brain detection of various pathologies 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:06.250
 applying fat suppression techniques 

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:10.390
 suppression techniques 

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:14.140
 free water detection techniques earlier 

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:15.910
 static am I not and using techniques 

00:03:14.140 --> 00:03:18.240
 getting an image of moving blood 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:19.990
 such as magnet resonance and angiography 

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:22.770
 magnetic resonance vein graph and 

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:26.350
 you can diagnose the widest range 

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:28.990
 diseases early on and get 

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:33.030
 necessary information details which 

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:35.160
 important to determine treatment tactics 

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:37.690
 disease prognosis 

00:03:35.160 --> 00:03:39.850
 contraindications to mrt 

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:41.890
