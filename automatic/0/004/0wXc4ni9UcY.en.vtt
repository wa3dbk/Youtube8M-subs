00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.790
 hello today it continues with mine 

00:00:02.129 --> 00:00:09.000
 row at top five islands and that turns 

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:11.550
 It's all about eye brushing and me today 

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.500
 start with one of the newest brushes 

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.580
 I made it to me and that 

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.699
 I believe that is also the cheapest 

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.740
 brush is from dm of air berlin 

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:22.890
 now special so the own brand of 

00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:24.689
 dm and I think that's called too 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:28.230
 the dazzling brush definitely looks great 

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:30.689
 like a normal linden brush 

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.840
 and i have to say i am extreme 

00:00:30.689 --> 00:00:36.390
 What inspires the quality and in itself 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:38.010
 simply also the performance is concerned 

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.410
 Price performance ratio is easy 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.090
 I find phenomenal like can 

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:44.969
 brush so very much I have in 

00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:46.590
 my face brush video said at 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:48.120
 paint them on a fan 

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:50.940
 and then go back together 

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:53.340
 because it gives you easy control 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.920
 but the brush is still so fluffy 

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:57.780
 and soft and not tied too hard 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.850
 so do not paint too much on one 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.850
 Because of this I can have a very good seat 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:06.320
 place but also blind and 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:09.000
 that for a few euros so about 23 euros 

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:12.000
 In any case very very good very soft 

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.799
 and synthetic are also in the eyes 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.070
 is at the forefront with her 

00:01:13.799 --> 00:01:18.810
 there 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:20.780
 especially the softie fine 227 of the 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:24.119
 end effect of the son was supposed to be also 

00:01:20.780 --> 00:01:25.320
 217 from mac I do not have those from away 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:27.810
 but i can only say that i am in 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:29.670
 this brush very well clear, I come 

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.140
 have to say that the very 

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:33.479
 be different 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.909
 mine is very bulky , for example 

00:01:33.479 --> 00:01:37.590
 So that's not so sharp together 

00:01:35.909 --> 00:01:39.119
 such as the one from berlin 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:42.479
 that means I do not have that much 

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:44.970
 Precision and he can blend well 

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:46.560
 but for a quick eye make-up where 

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.119
 I only put one color in the eyelet fold 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:50.759
 would I use'm actually getting 

00:01:48.119 --> 00:01:54.090
 a two most used brush from ce 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:57.689
 was out of sight brush category 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:02:00.550
 the smarter 226 and that's a whole 

00:01:57.689 --> 00:02:03.610
 small brush that is very firm 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:05.850
 rounded also quite flat and so on 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:09.360
 I've always wanted and 

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:12.190
 I have the perfect father in this one 

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:14.830
 he found it very well 

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:17.710
 Eyeshadow and kohl can smoke out 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:19.660
 I use it whenever I eyebad 

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:21.310
 here give up the lower lashes wreath 

00:02:19.660 --> 00:02:23.110
 or if i have something upstairs, for example 

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:24.460
 especially when it comes to 

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:26.650
 I have a lot going on today, for example 

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:28.270
 also made outside then such a 

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:29.620
 taken black kajalstift and that 

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:31.480
 whole then with this blinded 

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:33.910
 works great which is very soft 

00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:35.920
 I often have those brushes 

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:37.750
 then scratch especially in my eyes 

00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:39.760
 Yes, it is very sensitive to those 

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:42.220
 We do not do that very often 

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:45.430
 used brush is the shadow shader 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:48.640
 from bi cosmetics which is not very reminiscent 

00:02:45.430 --> 00:02:50.380
 to the mac 239 that's a whole 

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.940
 classic eyeshadow brush the man 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:54.820
 in principle, just like shadow on the 

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:56.200
 Gives up mobile lid and I use 

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:57.850
 also very happy for example in loose 

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.740
 eyeshadows or pigments 

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:02.050
 she is very good at it because he is 

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:04.180
 tied very tight is also relative 

00:03:02.050 --> 00:03:05.050
 small if you went up well then 

00:03:04.180 --> 00:03:06.700
 can pack 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:08.920
 this I looked to the closing 

00:03:06.700 --> 00:03:11.860
 it was lifted as his eyes brush 

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:14.230
 declared but I use it well 

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:16.060
 not so much as eyes he brushes around the 

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:16.690
 eyes around as a concealer 

00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:18.910
 brush 

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:21.610
 that's the dax chris bosh of 

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:23.920
 biotechnics comes in a set 

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:25.150
 I'll link you below as well as all 

00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:27.190
 others even if I still brush 

00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:29.770
 find and they are still current 

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:33.010
 but I would definitely like this island 

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:34.420
 not for the eyes and especially 

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:37.180
 do not recommend 

00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:38.770
 he is very tightly bound relatively short 

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:40.840
 and very broad that means you can 

00:03:38.770 --> 00:03:42.910
 really hard to blind and one 

00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:46.110
 also uses a very large area 

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:48.140
 I prefer to use it for it 

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:50.390
 for my 

00:03:48.140 --> 00:03:52.760
 eye shadow partie yes as a 

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:54.110
 Concealer in principle to blend and 

00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:56.180
 so one could give the well a 

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:57.530
 Weapons that one says so very nice 

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:59.860
 Blend without it somehow 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:01.819
 It looks like it's pasted over and that's kind of 

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:03.440
 so a little better with the skin 

00:04:01.819 --> 00:04:06.020
 mischievous and that's five of my 

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:08.000
 favorite brush in the category eyes 

00:04:06.020 --> 00:04:09.260
 I hope you liked the video 

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:11.660
 Write me in any case, in the 

00:04:09.260 --> 00:04:13.760
 Comments what your all the best 

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:16.609
 Eyes brush is that would be me 

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:20.200
 interested because maybe you could 

00:04:16.609 --> 00:04:24.700
 say that I like to buy brushes 

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:24.700
 and then I would say next time
