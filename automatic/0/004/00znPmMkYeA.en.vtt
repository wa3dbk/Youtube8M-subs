00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:36.870 
but we were not organized

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.990 
but we were not organized
we<00:00:37.440> were<00:00:37.590> actually<00:00:37.800> not<00:00:38.190> aware<00:00:38.340> of<00:00:38.460> what<00:00:38.790> is<00:00:38.910> to

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.000 
we were actually not aware of what is to

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.030 
we were actually not aware of what is to
be<00:00:39.090> given<00:00:39.719> at<00:00:39.840> the<00:00:39.930> right<00:00:40.079> time<00:00:40.290> what<00:00:40.860> was

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:41.040 
be given at the right time what was

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:42.380 
be given at the right time what was
something<00:00:41.399> to<00:00:41.489> be<00:00:41.579> gone<00:00:41.730> pre-workout<00:00:42.360> and

something to be gone pre-workout and

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:44.779 
something to be gone pre-workout and
post-workout<00:00:42.860> so<00:00:43.860> now<00:00:44.100> we<00:00:44.550> are<00:00:44.640> more

00:00:44.779 --> 00:00:44.789

00:00:47.569 --> 00:00:47.579 
organized and you know the results

00:00:47.579 --> 00:00:49.340 
organized and you know the results
actually<00:00:47.850> so<00:00:48.390> what<00:00:48.600> was<00:00:48.780> the<00:00:48.899> result<00:00:49.170> of<00:00:49.260> the

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:49.350 
actually so what was the result of the

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:54.829 
actually so what was the result of the
blood<00:00:49.469> test<00:00:51.469> results<00:00:53.359> this<00:00:54.359> a<00:00:54.539> mclogan

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:54.839 
blood test results this a mclogan

00:00:54.839 --> 00:00:56.720 
blood test results this a mclogan
percentage<00:00:55.350> was<00:00:55.499> very<00:00:55.739> less<00:00:55.890> and<00:00:56.460> hope<00:00:56.579> we

00:00:56.720 --> 00:00:56.730 
percentage was very less and hope we

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:58.040 
percentage was very less and hope we
haven't<00:00:56.940> be<00:00:57.120> three<00:00:57.269> levels<00:00:57.420> were<00:00:57.690> very<00:00:57.870> less

00:00:58.040 --> 00:00:58.050 
haven't be three levels were very less

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.130 
haven't be three levels were very less
okay<00:00:58.710> and<00:00:58.949> we<00:00:59.609> be<00:01:00.149> basically<00:01:00.569> and<00:01:00.719> go<00:01:00.929> into

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:01.140 
okay and we be basically and go into

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:02.779 
okay and we be basically and go into
this<00:01:01.289> program<00:01:01.530> thinking<00:01:02.159> that<00:01:02.309> you<00:01:02.550> know<00:01:02.640> we

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789 
this program thinking that you know we

00:01:02.789 --> 00:01:04.579 
this program thinking that you know we
want<00:01:02.969> to<00:01:02.999> enhance<00:01:03.359> his<00:01:03.929> performance<00:01:03.989> at<00:01:04.559> the

00:01:04.579 --> 00:01:04.589 
want to enhance his performance at the

00:01:04.589 --> 00:01:06.440 
want to enhance his performance at the
same<00:01:04.800> time<00:01:04.979> we<00:01:05.129> want<00:01:05.309> to<00:01:05.460> look<00:01:05.760> into<00:01:05.940> s<00:01:06.150> health

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:06.450 
same time we want to look into s health

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.170 
same time we want to look into s health
also<00:01:07.080> so<00:01:07.830> that's<00:01:08.220> how<00:01:08.430> we<00:01:08.490> did<00:01:08.729> that<00:01:08.909> and<00:01:09.030> then

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:09.180 
also so that's how we did that and then

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:12.080 
also so that's how we did that and then
the<00:01:09.450> blood<00:01:09.600> test<00:01:09.840> actually<00:01:10.050> is<00:01:10.520> a<00:01:11.520> super<00:01:11.790> beast

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:12.090 
the blood test actually is a super beast

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.110 
the blood test actually is a super beast
and<00:01:12.300> so<00:01:13.170> now<00:01:13.560> since<00:01:14.490> we<00:01:14.700> are<00:01:14.729> being<00:01:14.940> on<00:01:15.030> the

00:01:15.110 --> 00:01:15.120 
and so now since we are being on the

00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:16.730 
and so now since we are being on the
right<00:01:15.300> and<00:01:15.600> then<00:01:15.840> everything<00:01:16.229> is<00:01:16.320> controlled

00:01:16.730 --> 00:01:16.740 
right and then everything is controlled

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.590 
right and then everything is controlled
and<00:01:16.860> regulated<00:01:17.100> his<00:01:17.820> inappropriate<00:01:18.119> count

00:01:18.590 --> 00:01:18.600 
and regulated his inappropriate count

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.450 
and regulated his inappropriate count
has<00:01:18.750> come<00:01:18.960> up<00:01:19.110> what<00:01:19.649> was<00:01:19.829> his<00:01:19.950> previous

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.460 
has come up what was his previous

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:21.920 
has come up what was his previous
immobile<00:01:20.939> count<00:01:21.180> and<00:01:21.329> what<00:01:21.450> is<00:01:21.570> the<00:01:21.630> present

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:21.930 
immobile count and what is the present

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:23.539 
immobile count and what is the present
he<00:01:22.020> started<00:01:22.439> with<00:01:22.590> nine<00:01:22.740> point<00:01:23.009> six<00:01:23.219> went<00:01:23.490> to

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
he started with nine point six went to

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:29.080 
he started with nine point six went to
eleven<00:01:23.909> now<00:01:24.180> it's<00:01:24.360> coming<00:01:24.509> at<00:01:24.659> 13-13<00:01:25.649> okay

00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:29.090 

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:31.580

he was late it was
and<00:01:43.380> you<00:01:43.890> could<00:01:44.070> see<00:01:44.280> that<00:01:44.310> there<00:01:44.760> was<00:01:44.970> some

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:45.180 
and you could see that there was some

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.060 
and you could see that there was some
deficient<00:01:45.630> silica<00:01:46.080> source<00:01:46.380> and<00:01:46.530> patches<00:01:46.890> on

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:47.070 
deficient silica source and patches on

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:47.750

his<00:01:47.190> face

00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:47.760 
his face

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:49.550 
his face
then<00:01:48.150> he<00:01:48.299> was<00:01:48.479> constantly<00:01:48.960> getting<00:01:49.500> new

00:01:49.550 --> 00:01:49.560 
then he was constantly getting new

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:52.820 
then he was constantly getting new
solutions<00:01:50.280> all<00:01:51.090> that's<00:01:51.420> stopped<00:01:52.200> I<00:01:52.440> think

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:52.830 
solutions all that's stopped I think

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:55.219 
solutions all that's stopped I think
like<00:01:53.220> 15<00:01:53.700> days<00:01:53.880> after<00:01:54.270> the<00:01:54.360> diet<00:01:54.570> everything

00:01:55.219 --> 00:01:55.229 
like 15 days after the diet everything

00:01:55.229 --> 00:01:59.719 
like 15 days after the diet everything
is<00:01:55.380> oh<00:01:56.360> yes<00:01:57.360> and<00:01:58.200> then<00:01:58.440> he<00:01:58.470> is<00:01:58.710> more<00:01:59.130> initiative

00:01:59.719 --> 00:01:59.729 
is oh yes and then he is more initiative

00:01:59.729 --> 00:02:03.859 
is oh yes and then he is more initiative
now<00:01:59.759> with<00:02:00.270> them<00:02:01.190> okay<00:02:02.190> he<00:02:02.369> much<00:02:02.580> so<00:02:03.180> did<00:02:03.780> the

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:03.869 
now with them okay he much so did the

00:02:03.869 --> 00:02:05.540 
now with them okay he much so did the
nutrition<00:02:04.320> say<00:02:04.560> what<00:02:04.770> was<00:02:04.950> the<00:02:05.070> cause<00:02:05.310> for

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:05.550 
nutrition say what was the cause for

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:06.980 
nutrition say what was the cause for
this<00:02:05.670> hemoglobin<00:02:05.940> count<00:02:06.420> to<00:02:06.630> come<00:02:06.810> down

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990 
this hemoglobin count to come down

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:10.010 
this hemoglobin count to come down
basically<00:02:07.560> was<00:02:08.130> iron<00:02:09.119> content<00:02:09.450> lack<00:02:09.690> of<00:02:09.869> iron

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:51.900 
ridiculousness when I saw the chart I

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:53.690 
ridiculousness when I saw the chart I
had<00:02:52.110> you<00:02:52.230> to<00:02:52.380> be<00:02:52.470> very<00:02:52.650> difficult<00:02:52.950> for<00:02:53.430> me<00:02:53.549> to

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:53.700 
had you to be very difficult for me to

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:56.360 
had you to be very difficult for me to
follow<00:02:53.880> but<00:02:54.510> then<00:02:54.750> later<00:02:55.290> on<00:02:55.560> make<00:02:55.860> it<00:02:56.010> well<00:02:56.160> it

00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.370 
follow but then later on make it well it

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:58.310 
follow but then later on make it well it
became<00:02:56.670> easy<00:02:57.060> because<00:02:57.209> first<00:02:57.630> they<00:02:57.810> asked<00:02:58.170> us

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:58.320 
became easy because first they asked us

00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:00.440 
became easy because first they asked us
what<00:02:58.650> we<00:02:58.890> are<00:02:59.070> used<00:02:59.310> to<00:02:59.459> eating<00:02:59.670> everyday<00:03:00.150> and

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:00.450 
what we are used to eating everyday and

00:03:00.450 --> 00:03:02.090 
what we are used to eating everyday and
they<00:03:00.660> plant<00:03:00.930> the<00:03:01.110> chart<00:03:01.350> according<00:03:01.769> to<00:03:01.950> our

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:02.100 
they plant the chart according to our

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.160 
they plant the chart according to our
type<00:03:02.370> of<00:03:02.549> food<00:03:02.760> in<00:03:02.970> the<00:03:03.150> unit<00:03:03.510> so<00:03:03.660> that<00:03:03.930> slowly

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:04.170 
type of food in the unit so that slowly

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:06.259 
type of food in the unit so that slowly
they<00:03:04.560> introduced<00:03:05.010> other<00:03:05.640> continent

00:03:06.259 --> 00:03:06.269 
they introduced other continent

00:03:06.269 --> 00:03:07.850 
they introduced other continent
conditions<00:03:06.780> so<00:03:06.870> it<00:03:06.959> was<00:03:07.110> easier<00:03:07.470> for<00:03:07.530> me<00:03:07.739> to

00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:07.860 
conditions so it was easier for me to

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:10.819 
conditions so it was easier for me to
get<00:03:08.130> it<00:03:08.310> so<00:03:08.540> basically<00:03:09.540> they<00:03:09.840> first<00:03:10.110> start<00:03:10.709> to

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:10.829 
get it so basically they first start to

00:03:10.829 --> 00:03:12.650 
get it so basically they first start to
the<00:03:10.950> normal<00:03:11.280> food<00:03:11.459> which<00:03:11.640> you<00:03:11.850> normally<00:03:12.209> eat

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:12.660 
the normal food which you normally eat

00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:15.979 
the normal food which you normally eat
and<00:03:12.810> then<00:03:14.030> okay<00:03:15.030> this<00:03:15.150> lonely<00:03:15.420> upgraded<00:03:15.870> you

00:03:15.979 --> 00:03:15.989 
and then okay this lonely upgraded you

00:03:15.989 --> 00:03:18.289 
and then okay this lonely upgraded you
to<00:03:16.430> different<00:03:17.430> food<00:03:17.579> so<00:03:17.730> that<00:03:17.760> he<00:03:17.940> can<00:03:18.120> survive

00:03:18.289 --> 00:03:18.299 
to different food so that he can survive

00:03:18.299 --> 00:03:20.690 
to different food so that he can survive
in<00:03:18.480> any<00:03:18.690> other<00:03:18.840> scale<00:03:19.200> Sego<00:03:19.650> synthase<00:03:19.980> okay

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700 
in any other scale Sego synthase okay

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:22.870 
in any other scale Sego synthase okay
