house my at my age or if you are going
to<00:01:12.990> have<00:01:13.170> a<00:01:13.200> house<00:01:14.479> you<00:01:15.479> know<00:01:15.570> a<00:01:15.600> tiny<00:01:15.869> house<00:01:16.140> is

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:16.500 
to have a house you know a tiny house is

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.070 
to have a house you know a tiny house is
a<00:01:16.890> really<00:01:17.430> good<00:01:17.610> option<00:01:18.119> because<00:01:18.299> it's<00:01:18.900> a

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:19.080 
a really good option because it's a

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.200 
a really good option because it's a
jumping-off<00:01:19.590> point<00:01:19.979> and<00:01:20.310> it's<00:01:20.939> always

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:21.210 
jumping-off point and it's always

00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:23.539 
jumping-off point and it's always
something<00:01:21.479> that<00:01:21.689> you<00:01:21.869> can<00:01:22.020> fall<00:01:22.200> back<00:01:22.229> on<00:01:22.549> so

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 
something that you can fall back on so

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:27.170 
something that you can fall back on so
like<00:01:24.270> no<00:01:24.450> matter<00:01:24.659> where<00:01:25.140> my<00:01:26.070> life<00:01:26.369> is<00:01:26.400> taking

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:27.180 
like no matter where my life is taking

00:01:27.180 --> 00:01:29.380 
like no matter where my life is taking
me<00:01:27.330> um<00:01:27.570> I<00:01:27.960> will<00:01:28.229> always<00:01:28.380> have<00:01:28.619> my<00:01:28.770> tiny<00:01:28.979> house

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:29.390 
me um I will always have my tiny house

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.050 
me um I will always have my tiny house
me<00:01:30.390> there<00:01:31.159> what<00:01:32.159> was<00:01:32.280> the<00:01:32.430> hardest<00:01:32.670> part<00:01:32.759> of

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:33.060 
me there what was the hardest part of

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:35.960 
me there what was the hardest part of
the<00:01:33.150> build<00:01:34.220> totally<00:01:35.220> learning<00:01:35.549> all<00:01:35.850> the

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:35.970 
the build totally learning all the

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:40.520 
the build totally learning all the
measurements<00:01:36.689> for<00:01:37.229> like<00:01:37.530> just<00:01:39.049> like<00:01:40.049> figuring

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:40.530 
measurements for like just like figuring

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.889 
measurements for like just like figuring
out<00:01:40.680> what<00:01:40.979> I<00:01:41.009> had<00:01:41.280> to<00:01:41.549> do<00:01:42.060> and<00:01:42.329> how<00:01:42.479> I<00:01:42.509> had<00:01:42.810> to

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:42.899 
out what I had to do and how I had to

00:01:42.899 --> 00:01:46.130 
out what I had to do and how I had to
measure<00:01:43.140> things<00:01:43.820> our<00:01:44.820> house<00:01:45.119> is<00:01:45.390> totally<00:01:45.720> not

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:46.140 
measure things our house is totally not

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:52.609 
measure things our house is totally not
square<00:01:46.740> or<00:01:47.310> flush<00:01:48.299> or<00:01:48.659> whatever<00:01:50.149> so<00:01:51.530> having<00:01:52.530> to

00:01:52.609 --> 00:01:52.619 
square or flush or whatever so having to

00:01:52.619 --> 00:01:55.460 
square or flush or whatever so having to
figure<00:01:52.799> out<00:01:53.040> how<00:01:53.189> to<00:01:53.220> work<00:01:53.490> around<00:01:53.670> that<00:01:54.470> it

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
figure out how to work around that it

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.490 
figure out how to work around that it
was<00:01:55.619> probably<00:01:55.979> the<00:01:56.159> hardest<00:01:56.310> thing<00:01:56.579> because

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:57.500 
was probably the hardest thing because

00:01:57.500 --> 00:01:59.899 
was probably the hardest thing because
it's<00:01:58.500> hard<00:01:58.770> to<00:01:58.860> measure<00:01:59.040> something<00:01:59.369> when<00:01:59.729> it's

00:01:59.899 --> 00:01:59.909 
it's hard to measure something when it's

00:01:59.909 --> 00:02:01.360 
it's hard to measure something when it's
not<00:02:00.119> square

00:02:01.360 --> 00:02:01.370 
not square

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:04.030 
not square
what<00:02:02.300> is<00:02:02.390> the<00:02:02.510> one<00:02:02.660> thing<00:02:02.690> you<00:02:02.900> most<00:02:03.740> look

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:04.040 
what is the one thing you most look

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:05.860 
what is the one thing you most look
forward<00:02:04.070> to<00:02:04.490> once<00:02:05.090> you<00:02:05.240> move<00:02:05.420> into<00:02:05.570> your<00:02:05.780> house

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:05.870 
forward to once you move into your house

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:10.840 
forward to once you move into your house
I<00:02:06.290> think<00:02:07.190> actually<00:02:07.520> waking<00:02:08.270> up<00:02:08.650> and<00:02:09.850> like

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:10.850 
I think actually waking up and like

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.040 
this surreal moment when I realize like

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:35.230 
this surreal moment when I realize like
I<00:02:31.670> built<00:02:32.660> all<00:02:32.840> this<00:02:33.430> how<00:02:34.430> did<00:02:34.460> you<00:02:34.730> learn<00:02:34.970> to

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:35.240 
I built all this how did you learn to

00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:37.690 
I built all this how did you learn to
build<00:02:35.330> a<00:02:35.450> tiny<00:02:35.630> house<00:02:35.840> and<00:02:36.230> do<00:02:37.130> you<00:02:37.190> think<00:02:37.430> it's

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:37.700 
build a tiny house and do you think it's

00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:39.310 
build a tiny house and do you think it's
something<00:02:38.030> that's<00:02:38.210> easy<00:02:38.420> that<00:02:38.900> everyone<00:02:39.230> else

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:39.320 
something that's easy that everyone else

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:41.770 
something that's easy that everyone else
can<00:02:39.530> do<00:02:39.710> I<00:02:39.920> think<00:02:40.790> it's<00:02:41.120> definitely<00:02:41.300> it's

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:41.780 
can do I think it's definitely it's

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:45.910 
can do I think it's definitely it's
difficult<00:02:42.320> so<00:02:42.830> you<00:02:43.310> have<00:02:43.550> to<00:02:44.140> either<00:02:45.140> be<00:02:45.710> able

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920 
difficult so you have to either be able

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.520 
difficult so you have to either be able
to<00:02:46.130> keep<00:02:46.820> yourself<00:02:47.180> motivated<00:02:47.330> or<00:02:47.900> have

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:48.530 
to keep yourself motivated or have

00:02:48.530 --> 00:02:49.870 
to keep yourself motivated or have
somebody<00:02:48.920> that's<00:02:49.130> gonna<00:02:49.280> keep<00:02:49.520> yourself

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:49.880 
somebody that's gonna keep yourself

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:50.970 
somebody that's gonna keep yourself
motivated<00:02:50.000> um

motivated um

00:02:50.980 --> 00:02:53.770 
motivated um
because<00:02:51.980> without<00:02:52.250> that<00:02:52.640> you<00:02:53.030> can<00:02:53.210> easily<00:02:53.420> just

00:02:53.770 --> 00:02:53.780 
because without that you can easily just

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:55.450 
because without that you can easily just
say<00:02:53.900> all<00:02:54.200> right<00:02:54.440> I'm<00:02:54.620> done<00:02:54.830> I<00:02:55.070> don't<00:02:55.100> want<00:02:55.400> to

do this anymore but I think you're

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:01.360 
do this anymore but I think you're
definitely<00:02:59.420> gonna<00:02:59.720> need<00:02:59.840> your<00:03:00.740> need<00:03:00.920> you're

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:02.480 
gonna need to make friends with the

00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:06.250 
gonna need to make friends with the
people<00:03:02.720> at<00:03:02.810> Home<00:03:02.990> Depot<00:03:04.060> because<00:03:05.060> they<00:03:05.930> helped

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:06.260 
people at Home Depot because they helped

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.040 
people at Home Depot because they helped
us<00:03:06.410> a<00:03:06.560> lot<00:03:06.590> and<00:03:07.040> also<00:03:07.970> we<00:03:08.330> had<00:03:08.510> some<00:03:08.750> friends

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:09.050 
us a lot and also we had some friends

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:15.250 
us a lot and also we had some friends
who<00:03:09.820> had<00:03:10.820> some<00:03:11.060> building<00:03:12.820> background<00:03:14.200> so<00:03:15.200> I

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:15.260 
who had some building background so I

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.040 
who had some building background so I
think<00:03:15.380> it<00:03:15.980> will<00:03:16.430> be<00:03:16.730> difficult<00:03:17.300> if<00:03:17.570> you<00:03:17.810> have

00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:18.050 
think it will be difficult if you have

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:21.130 
think it will be difficult if you have
no<00:03:18.410> experience<00:03:19.130> at<00:03:19.400> all<00:03:19.930> you're<00:03:20.930> definitely

00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:21.140 
no experience at all you're definitely

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:23.340 
no experience at all you're definitely
gonna<00:03:21.350> need<00:03:21.560> to<00:03:21.680> find<00:03:21.890> somebody<00:03:22.250> that<00:03:22.430> might

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:23.350 
gonna need to find somebody that might

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:26.229 
gonna need to find somebody that might
or<00:03:24.350> just<00:03:24.709> do<00:03:24.830> a<00:03:24.860> lot<00:03:25.220> of<00:03:25.280> research<00:03:25.640> and<00:03:26.150> do<00:03:26.209> a

00:03:26.229 --> 00:03:26.239 
or just do a lot of research and do a

00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:29.320 
or just do a lot of research and do a
lot<00:03:26.510> of<00:03:26.540> small<00:03:26.930> projects<00:03:27.440> but<00:03:27.890> I<00:03:28.130> think<00:03:29.090> if<00:03:29.209> you

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:29.330

lot of small projects but I think if you
have<00:03:29.600> that<00:03:29.840> determination<00:03:30.070> you<00:03:31.070> can<00:03:31.100> get<00:03:31.430> it

00:03:31.540 --> 00:03:31.550 
have that determination you can get it
