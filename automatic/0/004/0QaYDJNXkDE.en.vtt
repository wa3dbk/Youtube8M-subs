00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:07.440
 I will teach you since it is to go in wii 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:09.059

 soon to make a conversation 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:14.340
 random with someone who in the same 

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.929
 moment the instant shake your phone 

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:17.940
 remember that wii chat a tool 

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:19.439
 already gave me a tool 

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.050
 social since on the one hand we can 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:23.779
 Chat with our contacts with two 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:26.910
 for example without having any contact 

00:00:23.779 --> 00:00:29.810
 make a trip a message and made 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:31.859
 voice or text or we can send you 

00:00:29.810 --> 00:00:34.200
 global video calling cards 

00:00:31.859 --> 00:00:35.969
 start a live conversation send 

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:38.010
 the images but let's what 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:40.620
 interesting that this has to do with 

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:42.719
 shake not shake is an option that we 

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.879
 allows us to communicate in a random way 

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:46.620
 mind that with someone who also 

00:00:44.879 --> 00:00:50.309
 go to the phone at the same moment 

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:52.559
 the letter what for this particular 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:55.230
 is that you can connect us with any 

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:56.969
 person in someone else's world 

00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:58.890
 it's even in the other world we arrived 

00:00:56.969 --> 00:01:01.500
 on the other side the world is to say 

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.130
 they rule well in the china someone in 

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.530
 USA 

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:08.850
 including someone in our country like 

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:10.770
 makes a sample that we acquired 

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:13.110
 looking for people that he took out in his 

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.210
 telephone is about communicating with the 

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.920
 closest person however here I 

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:20.340
 found a thing that is in irak 

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:21.899
 we have it very far in the photo 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.250
 see as interesting but as to see if 

00:01:21.899 --> 00:01:27.140
 we found someone in our country 

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.140
 We can be here in Colombia 

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:33.549
 and at the same time we are going to do another test with 

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:35.159
 another phone at a time we will cover 

00:01:33.549 --> 00:01:39.220
 from the outside a version at the end we 

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:41.380
 connect here we have a galaxy buffer and 

00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:42.909
 the 2 we are going to make the problem of 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:46.810
 shake the two phones at the same time 

00:01:42.909 --> 00:01:49.450
 which would be interesting to see if we go 

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:52.390
 to configure you configure the gps that does not 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:55.179
 have configured I am going to return us already 

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:57.400
 that is going to activate the gps we are going to agreements 

00:01:55.179 --> 00:02:00.550
 once 

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:02.650
 I exercised suddenly we agreed with the two 

00:02:00.550 --> 00:02:06.610
 phones 

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:09.550

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:21.220
 as there are two is this phone 

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:22.630
 effectively at 100 meters and that 

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:24.670
 phone found another person 

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:26.320
 different found a person in 

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:28.720
 indonesia let's see what happens if I 

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:32.970
 I communicate with him law 2 through the 

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:32.970
 shake on gave message 

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:38.390

 interesting not effectively this is 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:03.970
 to go is a reality to shake the two 

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:09.000
 phones at the same time 

00:03:03.970 --> 00:03:09.000
 and I actually found 

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:14.180
 we agree when it comes to shaking and not 

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:16.310
 found and this and gave me the option 

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:18.980
