00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.280
 then I made myself some then 

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:11.370
 video makes some faces of the day i rei 

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:14.490
 in which I put the mascara some natta 

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.350
 between you wrote me I don't know you 

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:20.100
 put on the mascara but how do you do c 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:22.230
 give up then I don't know how to put mascara 

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.119
 in the sense that most of the 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:26.460
 sometimes I get crap 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:31.320
 however over the years we say ho 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:34.649
 developed a technique that more or less does 

00:00:31.320 --> 00:00:37.559
 yes that the embroidery always comes enough 

00:00:34.649 --> 00:00:39.750
 well what i did i took some 

00:00:37.559 --> 00:00:41.670
 mascara of those that I have at home 

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.690
 sorry but eyeliner of those that I in 

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:47.910
 house showed how the applicable 

00:00:44.690 --> 00:00:49.969
 then absolutely don't want to be a 

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:53.239
 tutorial on how to put lay line 

00:00:49.969 --> 00:00:55.079
 I just want you to see how I do it for 

00:00:53.239 --> 00:01:00.449
 I answer the girls who have me 

00:00:55.079 --> 00:01:02.280
 asked for a small suggestion 

00:01:00.449 --> 00:01:05.339
 take eyeliner writing 

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:09.110
 well because I have some type 1 of the 

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:11.939
 that really have a trait like that 

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:14.070
 stupid that of course to ensure that yes 

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:16.409
 see something you need to almost limestone 

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:18.390
 repass several times and if a dwarf stops 

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:20.939
 a steady hand like mine like 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:24.119
 yours of who is not so capable comes 

00:01:20.939 --> 00:01:26.070
 a photonic crap then before 

00:01:24.119 --> 00:01:29.430
 all I recommend and take of 

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:32.250
 decent eyeliner are fine too 

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:35.280
 those in the jari or with the small brush 

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:38.759
 for example I showed among the various 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:41.340
 bits as I apply that of sense 

00:01:38.759 --> 00:01:42.600
 that is fine veins or show some 

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:44.520
 rears 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.890
 so nothing just take a look at it 

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.409
 I do maybe you can serve as 

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:51.360
 precisely my only starting point 

00:01:49.409 --> 00:01:53.280
 try and try try and try 

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.189
 take high lines that work 

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.560
 For example, here I have a very good one 

00:01:56.189 --> 00:01:58.450
 that 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:01.030
 the last one he bought in a fit 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:02.680
 of madness perhaps because my life from 

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:05.409
 sephora was buying the world of mi 

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:08.200
 I felt that something was wrong too and 

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:10.810
 i took this dior harpin for that price 

00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:12.430
 full before the discount cost type 28 

00:02:10.810 --> 00:02:14.830
 euro if you want the same amount 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:18.640
 buy you 10 mascara go buy 

00:02:14.830 --> 00:02:21.040
 this of patrice that goes strabene liquid 

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.650
 I wanted to show you live though 

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:25.930
 example having these two in hand the 

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:28.630
 difference between the two brushes 

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:30.760
 obviously depending on the iii liner that 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:33.430
 use the dl brush they have 

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:36.160
 the effect will be different so I do 

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:38.049
 see these two that god in hand 

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:40.150
 look already I'm here for a while 

00:02:38.049 --> 00:02:42.220
 let's see if I can get you to review the 

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:45.700
 difference between these two nibs one 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:48.220
 the longer the other one is this shorter 

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:50.349
 for example, by now less product 

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:51.880
 this says tris you see that it has a lot more 

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:53.860
 concentrated product then 

00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:58.180
 a thicker line will probably come 

00:02:53.860 --> 00:03:00.370
 here you see then a little you the effect that 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:02.829
 you want depending on the effect you want 

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:05.709
 orient yourself on the mass a lay line of 

00:03:02.829 --> 00:03:08.019
 this ska on the eyeliner to buy 

00:03:05.709 --> 00:03:10.959
 just leave you to the vision of a 

00:03:08.019 --> 00:03:17.170
 unable to put different types of 

00:03:10.959 --> 00:03:23.430
 ayane and I am then traces the first 

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:23.430
 line attached here to the lashes 

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:47.250
 making sure they are not there 

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:49.910
 holes then erricuccio I do codeine e 

00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:49.910
 with june 

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:09.080
 here is today for example the line up and down 

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:09.080
 it came to me the same 

00:04:15.550 --> 00:04:23.519
 and here I refreshed a little but oh my 

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:23.519
 usually as a standard we have is this 

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:34.380
 region does way discounts 

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:51.690
 the sun the Democratic Party will vote more and more 

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:51.690
 logicians of no 

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:05.820
 and as if the successor of calamity 

00:05:02.190 --> 00:05:08.120
 decide I am a podium now but the 

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:08.120
 mother 

00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:19.160
 ok ok see this is the effect of 

00:05:17.539 --> 00:05:22.250
 more mascara 

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:25.630
 sorry for eyeliner plus mascara today 

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:25.630
 I put it pretty thin 

00:05:33.409 --> 00:05:37.239
 spoke the same way 

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:42.350
 it's true 

00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:50.350
 now I try to do the same then 

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:54.340
 let's try with an eyeliner from 

00:05:50.350 --> 00:06:02.380
 professionals this is the of your heart 

00:05:54.340 --> 00:06:04.590
 penn force focuses a lot of wines art 

00:06:02.380 --> 00:06:04.590
 pen 

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:31.900
 here is a little thing of the kind we try to 

00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:34.560
 do it like that here or up and down like this now 

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:34.560
