00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:45.460 
because it it has a lot of sugar in it

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:48.150 
because it it has a lot of sugar in it
so<00:01:45.730> it's<00:01:46.240> abrasive<00:01:46.990> I<00:01:47.200> don't<00:01:47.410> like<00:01:47.530> when<00:01:47.830> i<00:01:47.860> get

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:48.160 
so it's abrasive I don't like when i get

00:01:48.160 --> 00:01:52.860

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:55.690 
fits into this sort of idea but
regardless<00:03:54.200> i<00:03:54.590> decided<00:03:55.220> to<00:03:55.310> pick<00:03:55.430> it<00:03:55.580> up

00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:55.700
