any interruption and the mobs it is also

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.220 
any interruption and the mobs it is also
significantly<00:00:20.970> faster<00:00:21.240> than<00:00:21.570> chopping<00:00:22.080> down

00:00:22.220 --> 00:00:22.230 
significantly faster than chopping down

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:24.650 
significantly faster than chopping down
trees<00:00:22.289> one<00:00:22.859> by<00:00:23.039> one<00:00:23.250> and<00:00:23.640> yields<00:00:24.210> more<00:00:24.420> wood

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:24.660 
trees one by one and yields more wood

00:00:24.660 --> 00:00:27.980 
trees one by one and yields more wood
for<00:00:24.689> the<00:00:24.900> time<00:00:25.199> it<00:00:25.380> takes<00:00:26.630> the<00:00:27.630> design

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990 
for the time it takes the design

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:29.929 
for the time it takes the design
contains<00:00:28.439> the<00:00:28.650> growth<00:00:28.859> of<00:00:29.039> trees<00:00:29.340> so<00:00:29.640> all<00:00:29.789> of

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:29.939 
contains the growth of trees so all of

00:00:29.939 --> 00:00:31.910 
contains the growth of trees so all of
the<00:00:30.029> apples<00:00:30.390> and<00:00:30.630> saplings<00:00:30.869> can<00:00:31.349> fall<00:00:31.590> into

the apples and saplings can fall into

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.889 
the apples and saplings can fall into
the<00:00:32.009> collection<00:00:32.460> area<00:00:32.610> which<00:00:33.480> saves<00:00:33.750> the

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:33.899 
the collection area which saves the

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.950 
the collection area which saves the
player<00:00:34.110> from<00:00:34.320> running<00:00:34.620> around<00:00:35.780> the<00:00:36.780> water

00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:36.960 
player from running around the water

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.959 
player from running around the water
then<00:00:37.260> pushes<00:00:37.680> the<00:00:37.829> items<00:00:38.190> into<00:00:38.550> a<00:00:38.579> stream

00:00:38.959 --> 00:00:38.969 
then pushes the items into a stream

00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:41.060 
then pushes the items into a stream
which<00:00:39.540> transports<00:00:40.170> them<00:00:40.379> to<00:00:40.590> a<00:00:40.620> single

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070 
which transports them to a single

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:44.600 
which transports them to a single
collection<00:00:41.370> point<00:00:43.100> the<00:00:44.100> floor<00:00:44.340> with<00:00:44.520> the

collection point the floor with the

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.459 
collection point the floor with the
previous<00:00:45.030> designers<00:00:45.570> that<00:00:45.750> drops<00:00:45.989> are<00:00:46.200> able

00:00:46.459 --> 00:00:46.469 
previous designers that drops are able

00:00:46.469 --> 00:00:47.990 
previous designers that drops are able
to<00:00:46.590> land<00:00:46.829> on<00:00:47.010> the<00:00:47.129> dirt<00:00:47.370> rows<00:00:47.610> where<00:00:47.879> the

to land on the dirt rows where the

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.360 
to land on the dirt rows where the
saplings<00:00:48.539> were<00:00:48.629> planted<00:00:49.110> this<00:00:49.890> means<00:00:50.190> the

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:50.370 
saplings were planted this means the

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.910 
saplings were planted this means the
player<00:00:50.579> had<00:00:50.760> to<00:00:50.789> run<00:00:51.090> back<00:00:51.300> and<00:00:51.329> get<00:00:51.780> them<00:00:51.989> the

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:52.920 
player had to run back and get them the

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.350 
player had to run back and get them the
floor<00:00:53.129> with<00:00:53.309> this<00:00:53.430> design<00:00:53.820> is<00:00:53.969> that<00:00:54.120> every

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:54.360 
floor with this design is that every

00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:56.479 
floor with this design is that every
sapling<00:00:54.780> will<00:00:54.899> have<00:00:55.020> to<00:00:55.199> be<00:00:55.320> replanted<00:00:55.710> rather

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
sapling will have to be replanted rather

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:59.439 
sapling will have to be replanted rather
than<00:00:56.699> just<00:00:56.940> the<00:00:57.090> ones<00:00:57.270> that<00:00:57.570> grow<00:00:57.750> into<00:00:58.020> trees

00:00:59.439 --> 00:00:59.449 
than just the ones that grow into trees

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:02.360 
than just the ones that grow into trees
we<00:01:00.449> grow<00:01:00.660> the<00:01:00.840> trees<00:01:01.109> in<00:01:01.350> rows<00:01:01.590> like<00:01:01.859> this<00:01:02.160> to

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370 
we grow the trees in rows like this to

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.490 
we grow the trees in rows like this to
make<00:01:02.550> harvesting<00:01:03.120> quick<00:01:03.329> and<00:01:03.510> easy<00:01:03.660> but<00:01:04.379> as

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:04.500 
make harvesting quick and easy but as

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.560 
make harvesting quick and easy but as
more<00:01:04.710> trees<00:01:04.979> sprout<00:01:05.369> the<00:01:05.670> saplings<00:01:06.119> have<00:01:06.299> less

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:06.570 
more trees sprout the saplings have less

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.570 
more trees sprout the saplings have less
chance<00:01:06.869> of<00:01:07.049> growing<00:01:07.260> you<00:01:08.040> do<00:01:08.189> not<00:01:08.280> have<00:01:08.460> to

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:08.580 
chance of growing you do not have to

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.340 
chance of growing you do not have to
wait<00:01:08.760> for<00:01:08.970> all<00:01:09.090> of<00:01:09.119> them<00:01:09.390> to<00:01:09.540> grow<00:01:09.720> to<00:01:09.750> harvest

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350 
wait for all of them to grow to harvest

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.200 
wait for all of them to grow to harvest
but<00:01:10.890> you<00:01:11.010> should<00:01:11.220> build<00:01:11.430> a<00:01:11.610> bigger<00:01:11.820> or<00:01:11.970> smaller

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:12.210 
but you should build a bigger or smaller

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.320 
but you should build a bigger or smaller
farm<00:01:12.750> depending<00:01:13.350> on<00:01:13.470> how<00:01:13.650> often<00:01:13.830> you<00:01:14.010> use<00:01:14.159> it

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:17.330 

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:19.490 

normally<00:01:18.330> in<00:01:18.420> my<00:01:18.540> tutorials<00:01:19.110> are<00:01:19.259> like<00:01:19.380> to

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:19.500 
normally in my tutorials are like to

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:21.170 
normally in my tutorials are like to
build<00:01:19.650> things<00:01:19.860> layer<00:01:20.189> by<00:01:20.430> layer<00:01:20.460> but<00:01:21.030> this

00:01:21.170 --> 00:01:21.180 
build things layer by layer but this

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:22.460 
build things layer by layer but this
time<00:01:21.450> we're<00:01:21.600> going<00:01:21.689> to<00:01:21.750> take<00:01:21.960> a<00:01:21.990> slightly

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:22.470 
time we're going to take a slightly

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:25.310 
time we're going to take a slightly
different<00:01:22.619> approach<00:01:23.509> so<00:01:24.509> first<00:01:24.780> of<00:01:24.990> all<00:01:25.110> when

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
different approach so first of all when

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.630 
different approach so first of all when
you're<00:01:25.409> building<00:01:25.619> a<00:01:25.799> tree<00:01:26.040> farm<00:01:26.250> you're<00:01:26.490> going

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640 
you're building a tree farm you're going

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.550 
you're building a tree farm you're going
to<00:01:26.700> build<00:01:26.850> them<00:01:27.090> in<00:01:27.270> segments<00:01:27.900> because<00:01:28.170> each

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:28.560 
to build them in segments because each

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.130 
to build them in segments because each
segment<00:01:28.829> is<00:01:29.250> identical<00:01:30.030> to<00:01:30.600> one<00:01:30.720> that<00:01:30.869> follows

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140 
segment is identical to one that follows

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.380 
segment is identical to one that follows
it<00:01:31.350> so<00:01:31.920> depending<00:01:32.430> on<00:01:32.579> how<00:01:32.820> big<00:01:33.030> you<00:01:33.180> want<00:01:33.299> to

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:33.390 
it so depending on how big you want to

00:01:33.390 --> 00:01:35.120 
it so depending on how big you want to
build<00:01:33.600> your<00:01:33.780> tree<00:01:33.990> farm<00:01:34.259> you<00:01:34.530> make<00:01:34.710> more

00:01:35.120 --> 00:01:35.130 
build your tree farm you make more

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:37.010 
build your tree farm you make more
segments<00:01:35.729> and<00:01:35.939> we're<00:01:36.450> going<00:01:36.600> to<00:01:36.630> build<00:01:36.750> this

00:01:37.010 --> 00:01:37.020 
segments and we're going to build this

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.819 
segments and we're going to build this
one<00:01:37.259> with<00:01:37.530> just<00:01:37.740> four<00:01:39.140> so<00:01:40.140> first<00:01:40.380> of<00:01:40.560> all<00:01:40.680> a

00:01:40.819 --> 00:01:40.829 
one with just four so first of all a

00:01:40.829 --> 00:01:44.149 
one with just four so first of all a
segment<00:01:41.340> is<00:01:41.490> 17<00:01:41.970> blocks<00:01:42.299> wide<00:01:42.630> and<00:01:42.960> free<00:01:43.860> long

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:44.159 
segment is 17 blocks wide and free long

00:01:44.159 --> 00:01:46.310 
segment is 17 blocks wide and free long
and<00:01:44.430> as<00:01:44.939> you<00:01:45.090> can<00:01:45.240> see<00:01:45.450> I've<00:01:45.600> used<00:01:45.840> white<00:01:46.110> warm

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:46.320 
and as you can see I've used white warm

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:48.289 
and as you can see I've used white warm
gray<00:01:46.619> wall<00:01:46.890> to<00:01:47.220> highlight<00:01:47.640> the<00:01:47.970> different

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299 
gray wall to highlight the different

time we're going to leave an entrance to

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:57.729 
time we're going to leave an entrance to
get<00:03:54.590> into<00:03:54.829> the<00:03:54.980> tree<00:03:55.220> farm<00:03:55.989> the<00:03:56.989> entrances<00:03:57.530> you

00:03:57.729 --> 00:03:57.739 
get into the tree farm the entrances you

00:03:57.739 --> 00:03:59.770 
get into the tree farm the entrances you
place<00:03:58.010> will<00:03:58.310> need<00:03:58.459> to<00:03:58.579> be<00:03:58.760> in<00:03:59.030> line<00:03:59.390> with<00:03:59.630> this

00:03:59.770 --> 00:03:59.780 
place will need to be in line with this

the<00:04:02.989> light<00:04:03.170> source<00:04:04.239> now<00:04:05.239> we're<00:04:05.390> going<00:04:05.510> to<00:04:05.570> wire

00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:05.780 
the light source now we're going to wire

00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:07.420 
the light source now we're going to wire
the<00:04:05.930> redstone<00:04:06.410> and<00:04:06.650> you<00:04:06.829> do<00:04:06.980> this<00:04:07.160> by<00:04:07.370> placing

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:07.430 
the redstone and you do this by placing

you'll<00:04:38.590> need<00:04:38.710> to<00:04:38.770> keep<00:04:38.979> doing<00:04:39.280> this<00:04:39.400> depending

00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:39.910 
you'll need to keep doing this depending

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:43.140 
you'll need to keep doing this depending

blocks<00:05:24.490> between<00:05:24.729> each<00:05:25.090> level<00:05:25.330> would<00:05:25.509> increase

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:25.870 
blocks between each level would increase

00:05:25.870 --> 00:05:28.050 
blocks between each level would increase
the<00:05:26.139> amount<00:05:26.169> of<00:05:26.530> leaves<00:05:26.830> and<00:05:27.070> would<00:05:27.729> increase

00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:28.060 
the amount of leaves and would increase

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:30.330

the chance of an apple dropping to 55
percent<00:05:30.690> this<00:05:31.690> means<00:05:31.960> you<00:05:32.139> can<00:05:32.320> set<00:05:32.590> the<00:05:32.710> farm

00:05:32.969 --> 00:05:32.979 
percent this means you can set the farm

00:05:32.979 --> 00:05:34.860 
percent this means you can set the farm
up<00:05:33.130> depending<00:05:33.639> on<00:05:33.759> a<00:05:33.789> few<00:05:34.060> want<00:05:34.240> more<00:05:34.479> apples

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:34.870 
up depending on a few want more apples

00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:40.020 
up depending on a few want more apples
