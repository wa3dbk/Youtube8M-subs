really<00:01:52.280> match<00:01:52.610> anything<00:01:53.180> I<00:01:53.450> mean<00:01:54.050> it<00:01:54.170> sort<00:01:54.530> of

00:01:54.639 --> 00:01:54.649 
really match anything I mean it sort of

00:01:54.649 --> 00:01:56.590 
really match anything I mean it sort of
matches<00:01:54.830> translucent<00:01:55.670> green<00:01:55.759> plastic<00:01:56.330> on<00:01:56.479> the

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:56.600 
matches translucent green plastic on the

00:01:56.600 --> 00:01:58.660 
matches translucent green plastic on the
armor<00:01:56.960> but<00:01:57.290> it<00:01:58.100> would<00:01:58.310> have<00:01:58.369> been<00:01:58.520> better

00:01:58.660 --> 00:01:58.670 
armor but it would have been better

00:01:58.670 --> 00:02:00.969 
armor but it would have been better
being<00:01:58.940> bright<00:01:59.240> green<00:01:59.509> or<00:01:59.990> maybe<00:02:00.140> heat<00:02:00.590> orange

00:02:00.969 --> 00:02:00.979 
being bright green or maybe heat orange

00:02:00.979 --> 00:02:03.490 
being bright green or maybe heat orange
but<00:02:01.369> it<00:02:02.119> really<00:02:02.450> doesn't<00:02:02.720> fit<00:02:03.020> all<00:02:03.170> that<00:02:03.320> well

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:03.500 
but it really doesn't fit all that well

00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:06.340 
but it really doesn't fit all that well
but<00:02:03.740> it<00:02:04.190> is<00:02:04.310> a<00:02:04.340> nice<00:02:04.580> touch<00:02:04.790> to<00:02:04.970> have<00:02:05.350> lastly

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:06.350 
but it is a nice touch to have lastly

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:08.139 
but it is a nice touch to have lastly
having<00:02:06.770> armor<00:02:07.160> on<00:02:07.250> his<00:02:07.399> back<00:02:07.580> really<00:02:07.880> helps

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:08.149 
having armor on his back really helps

00:02:08.149 --> 00:02:09.520 
having armor on his back really helps
fill<00:02:08.390> him<00:02:08.479> out<00:02:08.600> a<00:02:08.630> lot<00:02:08.810> more<00:02:09.020> and<00:02:09.080> what<00:02:09.380> makes

00:02:09.520 --> 00:02:09.530 
fill him out a lot more and what makes

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:11.260 
fill him out a lot more and what makes
him<00:02:09.649> look<00:02:09.739> a<00:02:09.860> little<00:02:09.979> less<00:02:10.190> skeletal<00:02:10.700> even

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:11.270 
him look a little less skeletal even

00:02:11.270 --> 00:02:13.630 
him look a little less skeletal even
though<00:02:11.360> his<00:02:11.480> limbs<00:02:11.750> are<00:02:12.050> still<00:02:12.890> pretty<00:02:13.340> bony

bone especially because it's a

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:36.530 
bone especially because it's a
translucent<00:04:34.530> piece<00:04:34.650> as<00:04:34.830> well<00:04:35.030> but<00:04:36.030> in<00:04:36.210> general

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:36.540 
translucent piece as well but in general

00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:38.930 
translucent piece as well but in general
I<00:04:36.660> think<00:04:36.960> it<00:04:37.169> looks<00:04:37.530> pretty<00:04:38.040> fine<00:04:38.610> it<00:04:38.910> looks

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:38.940 
I think it looks pretty fine it looks

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:41.740 
I think it looks pretty fine it looks
pretty<00:04:39.330> good<00:04:39.510> and<00:04:39.780> better<00:04:40.050> for<00:04:40.200> poseability

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:41.750 
pretty good and better for poseability

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:45.350 
pretty good and better for poseability
and<00:04:42.750> that's<00:04:42.930> the<00:04:43.740> only<00:04:44.010> real<00:04:44.430> key<00:04:44.850> difference

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:45.360 
and that's the only real key difference

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:47.480 
and that's the only real key difference
I<00:04:45.540> mean<00:04:45.660> if<00:04:45.840> you<00:04:45.960> want<00:04:46.169> to<00:04:46.290> count<00:04:46.530> the<00:04:47.280> back

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:47.490 
I mean if you want to count the back

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:49.060 
I mean if you want to count the back
armor<00:04:47.880> here<00:04:48.120> I<00:04:48.150> mean<00:04:48.419> there's<00:04:48.720> nothing

00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:49.070 
armor here I mean there's nothing

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:51.440 
armor here I mean there's nothing
particularly<00:04:50.090> different<00:04:51.090> I<00:04:51.120> mean<00:04:51.210> but<00:04:51.360> that

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:51.450 
particularly different I mean but that

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:53.000 
particularly different I mean but that
hasn't<00:04:51.690> even<00:04:51.810> hinder<00:04:52.229> anything<00:04:52.620> like<00:04:52.800> unless

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:53.010 
hasn't even hinder anything like unless

00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:55.010 
hasn't even hinder anything like unless
you<00:04:53.130> want<00:04:53.310> to<00:04:53.370> put<00:04:53.490> the<00:04:53.580> leg<00:04:53.729> all<00:04:53.910> the<00:04:53.940> way<00:04:54.120> you

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:55.020 
you want to put the leg all the way you

00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:56.129 
you want to put the leg all the way you
know

00:04:56.129 --> 00:04:56.139 
know

00:04:56.139 --> 00:04:59.339 
know
to<00:04:56.680> make<00:04:56.860> it<00:04:57.009> parallel<00:04:57.580> with<00:04:57.969> a<00:04:57.999> spine<00:04:58.389> I<00:04:58.749> mean

00:04:59.339 --> 00:04:59.349 
to make it parallel with a spine I mean

00:04:59.349 --> 00:05:02.040 
to make it parallel with a spine I mean
you<00:04:59.469> could<00:04:59.650> do<00:04:59.770> that<00:04:59.919> if<00:05:00.219> you<00:05:00.400> so<00:05:00.550> desire<00:05:01.050> but

00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:02.050 
you could do that if you so desire but

00:05:02.050 --> 00:05:04.080 
you could do that if you so desire but
