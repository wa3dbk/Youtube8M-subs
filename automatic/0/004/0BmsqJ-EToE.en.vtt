 It would be nice to connect dad with the liquid crystal and a path that takes care a little 

00:04:07.049 --> 00:04:09.860
 Not 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:11.610

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:39.450
 It is Nan I'm is set to darker Nde hurt if this really is going to various toying future 

00:04:36.940 --> 00:04:39.450
 I think 

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:48.130
 Hey wide 

00:04:42.790 --> 00:04:52.200

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:57.240
 1200 Oh who is better in separately 

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:58.009
 I open 2048 by myself before the two strategies are different 

00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:02.509
 Well then 

00:04:58.009 --> 00:05:07.610
 2048 something I'd made to take was really big times in Fu Tteyuu Toka 

00:05:02.509 --> 00:05:11.300
 Dualis is apparently a remodel on the face but it is the best 

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:17.710
 When I use it for a display, the power doesn't escape either, I 

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:17.710
 In the practice of this case, the lie width is not good 

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:23.510
 I have so much 

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:27.080
 I guess you 

00:05:23.510 --> 00:05:28.100
 If you wonder why this round pointer is by the end after all 

00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:30.210

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:34.740
 Right b and b 

00:05:30.210 --> 00:05:36.310
 Further space has decreased Mom Nde was worrisome was spread by the use of more of the arm to the tree 

00:05:34.740 --> 00:05:40.550
 Right 

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:43.690
 It is good because you can also go around hdmi connection later- 

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:43.690
 That's why 

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:52.270
 amazon limited edition 

00:05:47.069 --> 00:05:57.160

00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:05.670
 It says that it can be pointed out and displayed firmly with 4 to 3 images without limping any 4 to 3 images 

00:06:02.470 --> 00:06:05.670
 It was also attached sound Un' 

00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:13.200
