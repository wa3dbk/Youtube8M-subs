sample<00:02:01.020> that<00:02:01.049> I<00:02:01.170> was<00:02:01.319> playing<00:02:01.530> around<00:02:01.679> with

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:01.920 
sample that I was playing around with

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.350 
sample that I was playing around with
and<00:02:02.130> he<00:02:02.219> didn't<00:02:02.399> care<00:02:02.520> for<00:02:02.579> it<00:02:02.789> too<00:02:02.850> much<00:02:03.000> he

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:03.360 
and he didn't care for it too much he

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:03.949 
and he didn't care for it too much he
wanted<00:02:03.539> to<00:02:03.630> know<00:02:03.719> if

00:02:03.949 --> 00:02:03.959 
wanted to know if

00:02:03.959 --> 00:02:07.210

00:02:09.949 --> 00:02:09.959 
didn't really appreciate that I guess he

00:02:09.959 --> 00:02:11.570

and<00:04:38.470> because<00:04:39.470> this<00:04:39.770> is<00:04:40.330> warped<00:04:41.330> because<00:04:41.479> it

00:04:41.770 --> 00:04:41.780 
and because this is warped because it

00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:43.750 
and because this is warped because it
had<00:04:42.050> a<00:04:42.080> lot<00:04:42.470> of<00:04:42.500> water<00:04:42.710> on<00:04:42.979> it<00:04:43.130> I'm<00:04:43.310> adding<00:04:43.699> a

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:45.260 
lot of adhesive on the back

00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:48.370 
lot of adhesive on the back
I<00:04:45.289> just<00:04:45.710> cut<00:04:45.889> this<00:04:46.100> black<00:04:46.550> piece<00:04:46.990> 1/8<00:04:47.990> of<00:04:48.260> an

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:48.380 
I just cut this black piece 1/8 of an

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:50.890 
I just cut this black piece 1/8 of an
inch<00:04:48.470> larger<00:04:49.060> I'm<00:04:50.060> gonna<00:04:50.240> turn<00:04:50.419> it<00:04:50.600> upside

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:50.900 
inch larger I'm gonna turn it upside

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:52.750 
inch larger I'm gonna turn it upside
down<00:04:50.930> and<00:04:51.289> give<00:04:51.560> it<00:04:51.650> a<00:04:51.740> good<00:04:51.919> rub<00:04:52.190> to<00:04:52.250> hopefully

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:52.760 
down and give it a good rub to hopefully

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:54.520 
down and give it a good rub to hopefully
flatten<00:04:53.180> that<00:04:53.270> paper<00:04:53.570> out<00:04:53.840> and<00:04:54.080> get<00:04:54.199> it<00:04:54.320> nice

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:54.530 
flatten that paper out and get it nice

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:59.050 
flatten that paper out and get it nice
and<00:04:54.560> stuck<00:04:55.160> down<00:04:55.400> so<00:04:56.270> you<00:04:56.720> can<00:04:56.900> see<00:04:57.169> how<00:04:58.060> we've

00:04:59.050 --> 00:04:59.060 
and stuck down so you can see how we've

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:01.450 
and stuck down so you can see how we've
got<00:04:59.270> the<00:04:59.419> same<00:04:59.660> kind<00:04:59.960> of<00:05:00.020> idea<00:05:00.320> going<00:05:00.560> on<00:05:00.889> the

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:01.460 
got the same kind of idea going on the

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:04.360 
got the same kind of idea going on the
the<00:05:01.880> main<00:05:02.120> stamped<00:05:02.720> layer<00:05:02.960> mounted<00:05:03.710> this<00:05:04.160> one

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:04.370 
the main stamped layer mounted this one

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:05.740 
the main stamped layer mounted this one
is<00:05:04.460> smaller<00:05:04.789> so<00:05:05.060> it's<00:05:05.210> going<00:05:05.300> to<00:05:05.360> give<00:05:05.479> us<00:05:05.599> some

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:05.750 
is smaller so it's going to give us some

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:08.320 
is smaller so it's going to give us some
more<00:05:05.870> design<00:05:06.320> options<00:05:06.979> so<00:05:07.669> I<00:05:07.700> have<00:05:07.910> my<00:05:08.060> card

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:08.330 
more design options so I have my card

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:11.140 
more design options so I have my card
base<00:05:08.570> I<00:05:08.960> have<00:05:09.500> a<00:05:09.530> basic<00:05:09.800> black<00:05:10.220> layer<00:05:10.580> and<00:05:10.910> then

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:11.150 
base I have a basic black layer and then

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:13.870 
base I have a basic black layer and then
a<00:05:11.389> piece<00:05:11.630> of<00:05:11.660> designer<00:05:12.080> series<00:05:12.320> paper

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:13.880 
a piece of designer series paper

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:16.240 
a piece of designer series paper
it's<00:05:14.389> coastal<00:05:14.840> Cabana<00:05:15.200> which<00:05:15.620> is<00:05:15.860> just<00:05:16.160> a

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:16.250 
it's coastal Cabana which is just a

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:18.190 
it's coastal Cabana which is just a
couple<00:05:16.490> shades<00:05:16.880> lighter<00:05:17.270> than<00:05:17.389> that<00:05:17.570> Bermuda

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:18.200 
couple shades lighter than that Bermuda

couple shades lighter than that Bermuda
Bay<00:05:18.349> color<00:05:19.570> and<00:05:20.570> we'll<00:05:21.169> layer<00:05:21.380> these<00:05:21.590> together

00:05:24.360 --> 00:05:24.370 

00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:26.860 

now<00:05:25.370> we'll<00:05:25.550> just<00:05:25.669> pull<00:05:25.880> in<00:05:26.030> some<00:05:26.240> dimensionals

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:26.870 
now we'll just pull in some dimensionals

00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:32.350 
now we'll just pull in some dimensionals
to<00:05:26.990> pop<00:05:27.289> up<00:05:27.590> the<00:05:27.979> stamped<00:05:28.400> layer<00:05:31.090> and<00:05:32.090> you<00:05:32.180> can

00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:32.360 
to pop up the stamped layer and you can

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:34.540 
to pop up the stamped layer and you can
see<00:05:32.599> how<00:05:32.810> all<00:05:33.080> of<00:05:33.110> this<00:05:33.440> layering<00:05:33.830> just<00:05:34.310> adds

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:34.550 
see how all of this layering just adds

00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:37.689 
see how all of this layering just adds
so<00:05:35.150> much<00:05:35.419> to<00:05:35.780> the<00:05:35.900> card<00:05:36.139> now<00:05:36.740> of<00:05:37.130> course<00:05:37.490> it's

00:05:37.689 --> 00:05:37.699 
so much to the card now of course it's

00:05:37.699 --> 00:05:40.779 
so much to the card now of course it's
not<00:05:37.880> necessary<00:05:38.510> but<00:05:39.199> if<00:05:39.440> you<00:05:39.470> want<00:05:39.949> to<00:05:40.190> like<00:05:40.669> I

00:05:40.779 --> 00:05:40.789 
not necessary but if you want to like I

00:05:40.789 --> 00:05:43.689 
not necessary but if you want to like I
say<00:05:41.030> go<00:05:41.270> beyond<00:05:41.599> this<00:05:42.560> is<00:05:42.740> one<00:05:42.979> way<00:05:43.160> you<00:05:43.190> can<00:05:43.490> do

00:05:43.689 --> 00:05:43.699 
say go beyond this is one way you can do

00:05:43.699 --> 00:05:46.060 
say go beyond this is one way you can do
that<00:05:43.810> okay<00:05:44.810> so<00:05:45.050> now<00:05:45.289> what<00:05:45.470> do<00:05:45.560> we<00:05:45.650> want<00:05:45.830> to<00:05:45.949> do

00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:46.070 
that okay so now what do we want to do

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:48.640 
that okay so now what do we want to do
definitely<00:05:47.060> be<00:05:47.210> adding<00:05:47.630> this<00:05:47.750> butterfly<00:05:48.080> and

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:48.650 
definitely be adding this butterfly and

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:51.939 
definitely be adding this butterfly and
then<00:05:49.130> I<00:05:49.160> have<00:05:49.580> this<00:05:49.849> celebrate<00:05:50.630> word<00:05:51.440> which

00:05:51.939 --> 00:05:51.949 
then I have this celebrate word which

00:05:51.949 --> 00:05:54.460 
then I have this celebrate word which
again<00:05:52.490> is<00:05:52.669> another<00:05:52.789> hot<00:05:53.330> trend<00:05:53.690> right<00:05:53.870> now<00:05:53.900> and

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:54.470 
again is another hot trend right now and

00:05:54.470 --> 00:05:57.820 
again is another hot trend right now and
I<00:05:54.919> just<00:05:54.949> cut<00:05:55.520> it<00:05:55.639> out<00:05:55.820> of<00:05:56.150> black<00:05:56.720> and<00:05:57.139> will<00:05:57.650> add

00:05:57.820 --> 00:05:57.830 
I just cut it out of black and will add

00:05:57.830 --> 00:06:00.370 
I just cut it out of black and will add
it<00:05:58.010> to<00:05:58.130> the<00:05:58.250> front<00:05:58.520> its<00:05:58.699> celebrate<00:05:59.300> I'm<00:06:00.050> just

00:06:00.370 --> 00:06:00.380 
it to the front its celebrate I'm just

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:02.080 
it to the front its celebrate I'm just
adding<00:06:00.590> a<00:06:00.800> little<00:06:00.830> bit<00:06:01.160> of<00:06:01.280> my<00:06:01.400> 2-way<00:06:01.789> glue

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:02.090 
adding a little bit of my 2-way glue

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:10.220 
adding a little bit of my 2-way glue
here

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:10.230 

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:12.660 

and<00:06:11.230> again<00:06:11.500> you<00:06:11.680> can<00:06:11.860> turn<00:06:12.010> this<00:06:12.220> upside<00:06:12.640> down

00:06:12.660 --> 00:06:12.670 
and again you can turn this upside down

00:06:12.670 --> 00:06:14.670 
and again you can turn this upside down
and<00:06:13.030> rub<00:06:13.180> or<00:06:13.540> just<00:06:13.960> put<00:06:14.110> a<00:06:14.140> piece<00:06:14.290> of<00:06:14.470> scratch

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:14.680 
and rub or just put a piece of scratch

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:17.160 
and rub or just put a piece of scratch
paper<00:06:14.710> over<00:06:15.370> it<00:06:15.400> and<00:06:15.730> just<00:06:16.300> rub<00:06:16.540> on<00:06:16.690> top<00:06:16.930> while

00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:17.170 
paper over it and just rub on top while

00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:19.590 
paper over it and just rub on top while
that<00:06:17.440> glue<00:06:17.830> is<00:06:17.860> settling<00:06:18.730> in<00:06:18.910> and<00:06:19.210> getting

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:19.600 
that glue is settling in and getting

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:21.330 
that glue is settling in and getting
this<00:06:19.720> yet<00:06:20.020> here<00:06:20.320> it<00:06:20.410> all<00:06:20.590> nicely

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:21.340 
this yet here it all nicely

00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:22.920 
this yet here it all nicely
I'm<00:06:21.430> gonna<00:06:21.550> grab<00:06:21.760> for<00:06:22.000> my<00:06:22.090> dimensionals<00:06:22.630> again

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:22.930 
I'm gonna grab for my dimensionals again

00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:24.420 
I'm gonna grab for my dimensionals again
to<00:06:23.080> add<00:06:23.230> it<00:06:23.440> to<00:06:23.620> the<00:06:23.710> back<00:06:23.860> of<00:06:24.040> this<00:06:24.160> butterfly

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:24.430 
to add it to the back of this butterfly

00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:26.700 
to add it to the back of this butterfly
I<00:06:24.610> think<00:06:24.970> this<00:06:25.150> dimensional<00:06:25.630> is<00:06:25.810> just<00:06:26.050> a<00:06:26.200> tad

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:26.710 
I think this dimensional is just a tad

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:29.010 
I think this dimensional is just a tad
too<00:06:27.190> big<00:06:27.400> so<00:06:27.640> I'll<00:06:27.760> just<00:06:27.910> snip<00:06:28.690> it<00:06:28.720> down<00:06:28.990> a

00:06:29.010 --> 00:06:29.020 
too big so I'll just snip it down a

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:36.030 
too big so I'll just snip it down a
little<00:06:29.260> bit<00:06:34.020> and<00:06:35.020> pull<00:06:35.320> the<00:06:35.470> wings<00:06:35.650> up<00:06:35.920> a

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:36.040 
little bit and pull the wings up a

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:38.190 
little bit and pull the wings up a
little<00:06:36.250> I<00:06:36.550> hope<00:06:37.210> you<00:06:37.390> enjoyed<00:06:37.780> this<00:06:38.020> video
