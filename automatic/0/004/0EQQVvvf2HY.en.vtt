a day we got dampness altar we're gonna
have<00:03:28.959> to<00:03:29.079> dry<00:03:29.290> out<00:03:29.440> the<00:03:29.470> break<00:03:29.799> then<00:03:30.489> it

00:03:30.629 --> 00:03:30.639 
have to dry out the break then it

00:03:30.639 --> 00:03:33.020 
have to dry out the break then it
reduces<00:03:30.790> the<00:03:31.299> repair<00:03:32.260> time<00:03:32.470> down<00:03:32.709> through

reduces the repair time down through

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:35.699 
reduces the repair time down through
about<00:03:34.030> 10<00:03:34.269> minutes<00:03:34.540> total<00:03:34.959> and<00:03:35.230> you're<00:03:35.319> done<00:03:35.470> I
