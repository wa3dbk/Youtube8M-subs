00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.240 
else works

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:22.240 
else works
I<00:01:19.299> like<00:01:20.299> it's<00:01:20.479> five<00:01:20.689> speed<00:01:21.049> when<00:01:21.890> I<00:01:21.920> got<00:01:22.130> it

00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:22.250 
I like it's five speed when I got it

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:24.179 
I like it's five speed when I got it
came<00:01:22.399> with<00:01:22.520> a<00:01:22.579> limited<00:01:22.880> slip<00:01:22.970> differential

00:01:24.179 --> 00:01:24.189 
came with a limited slip differential

00:01:24.189 --> 00:01:26.380 
came with a limited slip differential
that<00:01:25.189> was<00:01:25.310> always<00:01:25.430> nice<00:01:25.670> but<00:01:25.729> it<00:01:26.030> is<00:01:26.210> the

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:26.390 
that was always nice but it is the

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:29.200 
that was always nice but it is the
economy<00:01:26.869> of<00:01:26.990> the<00:01:27.259> limited<00:01:27.500> slip<00:01:27.770> it's<00:01:27.950> a<00:01:28.210> 2.92

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:29.210 
economy of the limited slip it's a 2.92

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:32.440 
economy of the limited slip it's a 2.92
I<00:01:29.960> think<00:01:30.229> it<00:01:30.289> is<00:01:30.880> anyways<00:01:31.880> here's<00:01:32.090> the<00:01:32.180> engine

00:01:32.440 --> 00:01:32.450 
I think it is anyways here's the engine

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:34.710 
I think it is anyways here's the engine
I<00:01:32.570> put<00:01:32.930> the<00:01:32.990> strut<00:01:33.229> bar<00:01:33.409> in<00:01:33.530> here<00:01:33.680> because

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:34.720 
I put the strut bar in here because

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:38.020 
I put the strut bar in here because
notice<00:01:35.720> how<00:01:35.899> much<00:01:36.020> body<00:01:36.200> roller<00:01:36.500> was<00:01:36.770> so<00:01:37.070> I<00:01:37.280> got

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:38.030 
notice how much body roller was so I got

00:01:38.030 --> 00:01:39.700 
notice how much body roller was so I got
that<00:01:38.210> that<00:01:38.420> helped<00:01:38.659> a<00:01:38.689> lot<00:01:38.869> everything<00:01:39.590> else

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:39.710 
that that helped a lot everything else

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:44.410 
that that helped a lot everything else
so<00:01:39.860> stock<00:01:40.509> except<00:01:41.509> for<00:01:41.630> these<00:01:41.720> my<00:01:43.420> hid

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:44.420 
so stock except for these my hid

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:49.660 
so stock except for these my hid
converters<00:01:45.020> falles<00:01:48.429> everything<00:01:49.429> else<00:01:49.549> is

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
converters falles everything else is

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.809 
converters falles everything else is
