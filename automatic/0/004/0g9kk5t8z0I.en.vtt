basically what we're doing today the

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:10.300 
basically what we're doing today the
scenario<00:01:07.940> is<00:01:08.240> the<00:01:08.780> vessel<00:01:09.380> is<00:01:09.680> there's<00:01:10.160> an

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:10.310 
scenario is the vessel is there's an

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:13.210 
scenario is the vessel is there's an
explosion<00:01:10.700> there's<00:01:11.270> a<00:01:11.330> fire<00:01:11.660> and<00:01:12.220> the

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:13.220 
explosion there's a fire and the

00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:15.670 
explosion there's a fire and the
students<00:01:13.729> initially<00:01:14.600> try<00:01:15.050> to<00:01:15.110> fight<00:01:15.350> the<00:01:15.500> fire

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:15.680 
students initially try to fight the fire

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.969 
students initially try to fight the fire
but<00:01:16.160> then<00:01:16.369> they<00:01:17.180> realize<00:01:17.630> quickly<00:01:17.960> that<00:01:18.170> they

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:18.979 
but then they realize quickly that they

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:41.230 
but then they realize quickly that they
can't<00:01:19.220> do<00:01:19.399> it

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:41.240 

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:44.450 

so<00:01:42.240> this<00:01:42.660> is<00:01:42.810> the<00:01:42.990> person<00:01:43.440> in<00:01:43.560> charge<00:01:43.590> gives

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:44.460 
so this is the person in charge gives

00:01:44.460 --> 00:01:46.430 
so this is the person in charge gives
the<00:01:44.610> command<00:01:44.970> for<00:01:45.180> the<00:01:45.240> students<00:01:45.690> to<00:01:45.900> get<00:01:46.200> into

00:01:46.430 --> 00:01:46.440 
the command for the students to get into

00:01:46.440 --> 00:02:01.730 
the command for the students to get into
their<00:01:46.590> emergency<00:01:47.160> and<00:01:47.670> abandon<00:01:48.180> ship

00:02:01.730 --> 00:02:01.740 

00:02:01.740 --> 00:02:06.960 

the<00:02:02.740> vessel<00:02:03.070> has<00:02:03.250> for<00:02:03.610> life<00:02:03.850> outside<00:02:04.620> so<00:02:05.970> they

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:06.970 
the vessel has for life outside so they

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:09.419 
the vessel has for life outside so they
get<00:02:07.600> into<00:02:07.750> their<00:02:07.930> suits<00:02:08.229> they<00:02:09.039> throw<00:02:09.310> their

00:02:09.419 --> 00:02:09.429 
get into their suits they throw their

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:13.330 
life rafts over the side and then the

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:16.080 
life rafts over the side and then the
person<00:02:14.140> in<00:02:14.230> charge<00:02:14.550> will<00:02:15.550> direct<00:02:15.970> the

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:33.730 
these drills tend to be pretty chaotic

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:35.700 
these drills tend to be pretty chaotic
and<00:04:34.240> this<00:04:34.390> this<00:04:34.780> one<00:04:34.990> in<00:04:35.110> particular<00:04:35.290> was

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:35.710 
and this this one in particular was

00:04:35.710 --> 00:04:37.800 
and this this one in particular was
really<00:04:36.100> involved<00:04:36.940> compared<00:04:37.360> to<00:04:37.450> some<00:04:37.630> of<00:04:37.720> the

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:37.810 
really involved compared to some of the

00:04:37.810 --> 00:04:40.920 
really involved compared to some of the
ones<00:04:37.960> we've<00:04:38.169> done<00:04:39.090> but<00:04:40.090> yeah<00:04:40.419> I<00:04:40.450> mean<00:04:40.660> all<00:04:40.810> in

all<00:04:41.020> I<00:04:41.080> think<00:04:41.260> it<00:04:41.470> went<00:04:41.650> pretty<00:04:41.680> smooth

00:04:43.270 --> 00:04:43.280 
all I think it went pretty smooth

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:46.360

you<00:04:43.820> know<00:04:43.940> the<00:04:44.840> comment<00:04:45.590> about<00:04:45.770> getting<00:04:46.220> into

you know the comment about getting into
the<00:04:46.490> immersion<00:04:46.910> suits<00:04:47.180> quicker<00:04:47.830> that's

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:48.830 
the immersion suits quicker that's

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:50.379 
the immersion suits quicker that's
definitely<00:04:49.400> something<00:04:49.639> that<00:04:49.760> we<00:04:49.970> can<00:04:50.120> improve

00:04:50.379 --> 00:04:50.389 
definitely something that we can improve

00:04:50.389 --> 00:04:52.390 
definitely something that we can improve
on<00:04:50.630> and<00:04:50.840> since<00:04:51.680> we're<00:04:51.860> all<00:04:51.950> going<00:04:52.130> to<00:04:52.190> be<00:04:52.310> in

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:52.400 
on and since we're all going to be in

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:54.220 
on and since we're all going to be in
the<00:04:52.520> industry<00:04:52.700> eventually<00:04:53.210> something<00:04:54.139> we'd

00:04:54.220 --> 00:04:54.230 
the industry eventually something we'd

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:57.830 
the industry eventually something we'd
like<00:04:54.410> to<00:04:54.560> be<00:04:54.680> able<00:04:54.740> to<00:04:54.889> get<00:04:55.040> down

00:04:57.830 --> 00:04:57.840 

00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:59.600 

yeah<00:04:58.410> I<00:04:58.440> mean<00:04:58.740> having<00:04:59.130> the<00:04:59.220> harbor<00:04:59.580> patrol

00:04:59.600 --> 00:04:59.610 
yeah I mean having the harbor patrol

00:04:59.610 --> 00:05:01.820 
yeah I mean having the harbor patrol
involved<00:05:00.480> this<00:05:00.570> time<00:05:00.840> was<00:05:01.110> definitely<00:05:01.290> kind

00:05:01.820 --> 00:05:01.830 
involved this time was definitely kind

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:04.610 
involved this time was definitely kind
of<00:05:01.889> new<00:05:02.180> and<00:05:03.180> that<00:05:03.240> added<00:05:03.480> a<00:05:03.660> whole<00:05:03.780> different

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:04.620 
of new and that added a whole different

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:05.920 
of new and that added a whole different
element<00:05:04.740> to<00:05:05.040> it

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:05.930 
element to it

00:05:05.930 --> 00:05:11.030 
element to it
we<00:05:06.930> had<00:05:07.020> smoke<00:05:07.380> machines<00:05:07.770> going<00:05:08.340> and<00:05:08.729> I<00:05:10.040> think

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:11.040 
we had smoke machines going and I think

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:12.980 
we had smoke machines going and I think
it<00:05:11.190> went<00:05:11.820> pretty<00:05:12.090> smoothly

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:12.990 
it went pretty smoothly

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:15.050 
it went pretty smoothly

like said before yeah what did he is

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:18.080 
like said before yeah what did he is
pretty<00:05:15.240> remote<00:05:15.449> closest<00:05:16.370> that<00:05:17.370> well<00:05:17.790> the

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:18.090 
pretty remote closest that well the

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:21.439 
pretty remote closest that well the
smoke<00:05:18.840> bomb<00:05:19.169> was<00:05:19.590> like<00:05:19.889> a<00:05:20.000> sugar<00:05:21.000> and

00:05:21.439 --> 00:05:21.449 
smoke bomb was like a sugar and

00:05:21.449 --> 00:05:25.430 
smoke bomb was like a sugar and
potassium<00:05:22.020> nitrate<00:05:22.770> mix
