00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.179
 yes 

00:00:03.530 --> 00:00:07.310
 Well, we are ready for the first 

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:09.410
 craft of the day and let's make a 

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:12.090
 bank so take note this is the 

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:14.720
 list of material 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:18.060
 to create our bank we need 

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:20.939
 roll of wood for cable painting coffee 

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:24.360
 in stapler for wood liners money box 

00:00:20.939 --> 00:00:26.460
 stuffing and down since we were already highlighting 

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:28.500
 to the tlapalería on the corner and who believes 

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:30.420
 that they did not even give it 

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:33.090
 we have to buy practical and maximum 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:33.660
 unfair is the way we need to 

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:36.449
 the stool 

00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:39.120
 this is our supposed lining that 

00:00:36.449 --> 00:00:41.309
 We chose piggy bank forums because if it was fabric 

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:43.170
 Suddenly it stains that the soda that 

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:46.290
 do not stay and with this we pass a 

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.360
 completely waterproof rag a cloth 

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:51.059
 and it's nice you chose a design 

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:54.390
 It's very nice, not that it has a certain 

00:00:51.059 --> 00:00:56.700
 shine gives you like that personality and the 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.140
 really extremely cheap if they want to miss 

00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:01.700
 It cost us the meter can not believe it 

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:04.410
 We are in our twenties and twenties 

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:07.860
 it depends now if it gives reason and so on 

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:10.830
 but it is not going to leave you more than 25 pesos 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:12.390
 let's extend the subway to what 

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:14.340
 we can mark behind nothing like 

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:16.200
 truth because we're going it anyway 

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:19.100
 to bend and we're going to staple 

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:22.880
 we are going to do and we are going to leave 

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:25.009
 there is a lot that about us 

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:28.250
 what happened to us that time with the 

00:01:25.009 --> 00:01:32.000
 champignon mushroom that was a mushroom 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:33.979
 they taste there is a perfect missionary and 

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.920
 then what we are going to do is paint 

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:39.140
 while martín cuts the lining that will be 

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:42.380
 for the base of the bench that forgive the 

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:44.360
 padding and coverage say the bank 

00:01:42.380 --> 00:01:46.100
 I'm going to paint it and it beats this color 

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:49.580
 chocolate that is very good models 

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:51.800
 furniture very I raise that as well 

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:54.110
 you know we could also resort in 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:57.020
 this case we do not want to do it like that but 

00:01:54.110 --> 00:01:59.090
 another alternative is painting in 

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:05.390
 spray that here in to us in the 

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:08.300
 forum does not do us a pain very well 

00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:10.959
 head or I saw well but tell me 

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:13.760
 you did your homework says my homework is that 

00:02:10.959 --> 00:02:15.710
 Check if I can, but keep it that way 

00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:18.650
 applied she- wolf 

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:21.170
 they are painting because that comes more or 

00:02:18.650 --> 00:02:23.810
 less something like up to the natural color 

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:26.720
 he saw for himself the truth is that if 

00:02:23.810 --> 00:02:28.700
 we can leave that option and this check 

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:31.610
 we have it ready completely 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:33.290
 covered or if you see this in the house 

00:02:31.610 --> 00:02:36.290
 of someone imagines that it is of the 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:39.980
 cables that is that it is not thin cardboard 

00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:43.550
 has cardboard and wood in fact but and 

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:46.580
 we have also the filling already ready there 

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:48.020
 what to do to controladito because here 

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:51.080
 everything is for the bar that will come out 

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:53.690
 martín if not then then they are numb 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:56.430
 in the buttocks and the client leaves the 

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:59.310
 client leaves then 

00:02:56.430 --> 00:03:00.730
 the lady let's go and look what I'm going to put 

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:03.489
 to the center 

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:05.980
 and I'm going to record on one side for later 

00:03:03.489 --> 00:03:08.440
 put the river leaves space 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:10.720
 enough so that it does not stay very 

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:13.690
 what we are going to do is have it as 

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:15.700
 a little yes and also if we can 

00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:17.500
 leave one by one below 

00:03:15.700 --> 00:03:20.530
 Martin coke because after putting it 

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:23.380
 We can cut it down 

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:27.340
 also in a circular way, not 

00:03:23.380 --> 00:03:29.650
 there is necessarily this to do so 

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:31.480
 open a little more stuffing but 

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:34.000
 obviously we are not going to fill more 

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:37.000
 but we're going to put everything one of 

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:41.050
 sphere at a time yes really better than 

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:43.680
 then manual first inside is for 

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:43.680
 Fill 

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:50.030
 a stool is always useful at a little 

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:53.240
 always to avoid that from the foot of 

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:56.960
 thief who arrived the one that the mother-in-law arrived 

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:58.970
 and paint it 

00:03:56.960 --> 00:04:02.880
 in the short you on the bench or 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:07.570
 blanquita in the dining room of three people 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:09.580
 another layer of it there and the rest 

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:11.470
 we're already going 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:14.260
 here to stay down can go one 

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:17.410
 rounder to cooperate to give you 

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:20.489
 the foralidad aguanta endures because here 

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:20.489
 I will give him and he will know what 

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:24.790
 scare me they lived 

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:32.700
 and almost got him 1 juan martín but all 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:35.110
 either because we fit the van all 

00:04:32.700 --> 00:04:37.529
 be for the craft 

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:40.000
 when we turn 

00:04:37.529 --> 00:04:43.180
 is 

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:46.090
 this yes so that in this way and this already 

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:48.810
 the circular shape that is down 

00:04:46.090 --> 00:04:48.810
 over 

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:52.540
 part of this stuffing is rod 

00:04:52.650 --> 00:05:00.960
 and that's fine, I think that already the truth 

00:04:57.710 --> 00:05:05.900
 let's talk so I remember to go 

00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:05.900
 doing the pleating that is like 

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:08.340
 and there 

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:11.919
 nothing remains 

00:05:16.479 --> 00:05:22.370
 man so how many banks for the house 

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:26.060
 I'm going to be giving here as 

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:30.400
 you want to release in bar truth only 

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:30.400
 making each side without 

00:05:30.849 --> 00:05:37.749
 without following us so that it does not go 

00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:41.999
 grab crook the south or as was the 

00:05:37.749 --> 00:05:41.999
 international name 

00:05:45.849 --> 00:05:53.559
 this thank you wait this lady pando to 

00:05:50.679 --> 00:05:55.599
 setback is ready but the design of your 

00:05:53.559 --> 00:05:58.479
 to be backwards slow and we want it that way 

00:05:55.599 --> 00:06:00.759
 it's okay we do the other one but not that 

00:05:58.479 --> 00:06:02.409
 there are we mark and that has good 

00:06:00.759 --> 00:06:04.550
 yes but I liked more the other side 

00:06:02.409 --> 00:06:09.430
 for me 

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:09.430
 I was already scolded is not good is fine 

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:15.790
 amazing 

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:20.350
 I'm going to leave, you have to put more 

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:25.110
 filling more like if you open a 

00:06:20.350 --> 00:06:25.110
 flatten the visual appeal 

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:30.620
 do you think if what we stuffed 

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:32.270
 and we conform well the form of the bank 

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:34.479
 let's see step by step and come back from 

00:06:32.270 --> 00:06:34.479
 fly 

00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:40.250
 create a handle paint your color roll 

00:06:37.700 --> 00:06:42.860
 coffee decides which of the parts will be the 

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:45.470
 seat place it on the table mouth 

00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:47.690
 below and with the lining suchá creates a 

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:50.060
 circumference larger than the roll 

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:52.160
 start stapling the liner to the roll 

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:54.380
 making folds so you do not wrinkle 

00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:56.690
 leave a space to start putting the 

00:06:54.380 --> 00:07:00.550
 stuffing decides how cushioned 

00:06:56.690 --> 00:07:00.550
 will be finished in stapling 

00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:05.419
 look with the stapled fright of the 

00:07:03.349 --> 00:07:07.430
 two sides is easier for us to go 

00:07:05.419 --> 00:07:10.190
 seeing the form and see where they are going 

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:12.139
 leaving chicks and we can go 

00:07:10.190 --> 00:07:15.620
 putting the filling and nothing else of the 

00:07:12.139 --> 00:07:20.110
 habit to also be a little 

00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:23.560
 same here nothing of the side to close 

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:25.900
 and terminate our bank and if 

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:29.380
 Martin was right indeed left us 

00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:30.970
 correct the level also if of bonitos 

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:32.410
 we get very creative we can 

00:07:30.970 --> 00:07:34.570
 use inside out 

00:07:32.410 --> 00:07:37.260
 check looks like a certain texture 

00:07:34.570 --> 00:07:40.590
 but in reality it is the thread that unites 

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:40.590
 this plastic 

00:07:41.969 --> 00:07:48.479
 and I think I need a little more as 

00:07:45.629 --> 00:07:50.459
 23 pieces of that king in what 

00:07:48.479 --> 00:07:51.839
 we finished and in what we ended what 

00:07:50.459 --> 00:07:54.709
 it seems to them if we go to a cut and 

00:07:51.839 --> 00:07:54.709
 we come back with more
