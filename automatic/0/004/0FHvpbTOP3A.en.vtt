00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.090
 very well this is the second video of 

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:18.610
 training to run 10 kilometers 

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:21.310
 and before forgiveness before starting this 

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:23.439
 or ask a great big apology the fact 

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:25.080
 that you have not posted this video before 

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:28.810
 it was because I had some problems 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:32.140
 doctors besides I've had a lot 

00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:34.300
 I work as it is already December and it is a month 

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:36.220
 very complicated that's why I do not 

00:00:34.300 --> 00:00:38.199
 can do more however I am 

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:40.629
 assuring right now that I'm going to carry 

00:00:38.199 --> 00:00:43.600
 all the videos that I need from 

00:00:40.629 --> 00:00:48.210
 all the workouts and I'm going to upload 

00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:50.379
 the same ones until the week 

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:52.960
 corresponding and every Friday I will go 

00:00:50.379 --> 00:00:55.180
 uploading the videos but previously 

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.910
 I will have recorded them for you but 

00:00:55.180 --> 00:01:00.010
 well I received some comments to 

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:03.010
 through youtube in which they said that 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:05.979
 this training was very hard and that 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:08.320
 they asked me to download the same as my 

00:01:05.979 --> 00:01:10.790
 coach will lower the same then with what 

00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:14.450
 which I will tell you the following 

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:18.380
 let's say that you make a 

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:20.690
 run at a 7-minute jog all 

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:23.870
 here it is mentioned that they are on a Monday a 

00:01:20.690 --> 00:01:24.950
 45 minutes jog to 6 minutes step no 

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:28.250
 do it 6 minutes 

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:31.820
 do it at 6 minutes and a half and 6 minutes 

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:35.350
 45 seconds try to lose 15 or 30 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:38.530
 seconds the kilometer 

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:42.790
 so that you can force your body 

00:01:38.530 --> 00:01:44.830
 to do this to start working 

00:01:42.790 --> 00:01:47.170
 harder to get used to 

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:50.200
 so if you can download it 15 or 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:52.560
 30 seconds per kilometer that's going to 

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:55.659
 help a lot of you start with this 

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:57.580
 Tuesday 15 reps plus photos 

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:59.649
 repetitions of minute and a half in upload 

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:02.830
 plus 15 minutes stay the same in 

00:01:59.649 --> 00:02:07.060
 Wednesday and Thursday on Thursdays had 

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:12.430
 said that it was going to be a trot of 15 

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:15.489
 minutes plus two sets of 4 by 300 more 

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:18.220
 300 plus trote of 15 among the first 

00:02:15.489 --> 00:02:21.550
 300 was running full and the hundreds 

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:23.470
 300 was a super light trot but there 

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:26.830
 people who told me it was very heavy 

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:30.370
 this then what should you do 

00:02:26.830 --> 00:02:33.549
 is to lower it to 100 or 100 meters to everything 

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:35.410
 what they can and next 100 meters of 

00:02:33.549 --> 00:02:37.540
 trot ligerito to draw and again 

00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:38.710
 100 meters these will be eight times 

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:42.460
 100 

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:47.260
 + 100 equal to that Friday is what 

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:50.380
 same as Monday and Saturday try to 

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:53.890
 run faster we had already said that 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:56.790
 15 or 30 seconds try to do between 

00:02:53.890 --> 00:03:00.060
 30 and 40 are 2 less 

00:02:56.790 --> 00:03:02.790
 per minute per kilometer and make seven 

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:04.170
 kilometers not then it would be the 

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:07.019
 First it sounds like I already talked to you 

00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:09.689
 previously but good in this case what 

00:03:07.019 --> 00:03:12.420
 what's been the second week is what 

00:03:09.689 --> 00:03:15.390
 same as the first week but in its 

00:03:12.420 --> 00:03:17.459
 case if you feel that you can not 

00:03:15.390 --> 00:03:20.220
 with this project forgiveness they can not 

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:22.530
 with this training here I put you in 

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:25.379
 the judge of the first week they were 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:27.239
 300 300 can not but is valid 

00:03:25.379 --> 00:03:29.790
 can not be done 

00:03:27.239 --> 00:03:35.180
 100 and 7 and here in the next week 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:39.930
 they will do 150 and 150 if they feel very good 

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:42.209
 200 and 200 the joke here is that the 

00:03:39.930 --> 00:03:46.290
 two weeks are very similar because 

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:49.200
 how hard feelings are what 

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:51.230
 we want is to make us hurt 

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:54.000
 let's hurt forgiveness that we hurt 

00:03:51.230 --> 00:03:56.220
 so with this what we can do well 

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.650
 to do is to make our body 

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:01.370
 go accustom but if you feel that 

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:03.410
 is torture is very difficult reiterated 

00:04:01.370 --> 00:04:06.740
 both monday wednesday 

00:04:03.410 --> 00:04:09.890
 Friday try to reduce the time that 

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:13.340
 normally they make per kilometer go down 15 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:15.890
 or 30 seconds can change and in 

00:04:13.340 --> 00:04:18.920
 the next week do it the same 

00:04:15.890 --> 00:04:20.630
 way 15 or 30 seconds go down like 

00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:23.000
 you feel the first one 

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:25.370
 week they did 15 and in the second they do 

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.550
 30 but good you will know and the 

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:31.490
 Thursday of both weeks is the first 

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:35.330
 week to be 100 meters plus 100 meters and 

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:38.290
 in the second is 200 meters plus 200 

00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:38.290
 meters or 

00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:44.819
 or else sorry 150 and 150 then with that 

00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:46.650
 they will be able to do it 

00:04:44.819 --> 00:04:49.190
 remember that at the end of each race 

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:53.510
 they must take recovery 

00:04:49.190 --> 00:04:57.860
 and a minute later and the recovery is 

00:04:53.510 --> 00:05:01.190
 this formula where is 220 minus your age 

00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:03.920
 gives you 100% among 6 that are the number 

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:06.020
 of pulsations is 10 seconds and you 

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:08.000
 says the number of beats in a 

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:11.030
 quiet career and the number of 

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.250
 pulsations in a hectic run but 

00:05:11.030 --> 00:05:16.840
 well in a next video I will upload the 

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:16.840
 third week thanks
