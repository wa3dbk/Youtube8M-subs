see the LEvolution on this map high
tension<00:01:17.360> is<00:01:17.840> rather<00:01:18.080> easy<00:01:18.230> to<00:01:18.740> activate<00:01:18.980> it's

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:19.820 
tension is rather easy to activate it's

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:22.330 
tension is rather easy to activate it's
not<00:01:20.150> hard<00:01:20.360> at<00:01:20.510> all<00:01:20.660> what<00:01:21.500> you<00:01:21.620> can<00:01:21.830> actually<00:01:21.980> do

00:01:22.330 --> 00:01:22.340 
not hard at all what you can actually do

rather<00:01:22.610> than<00:01:22.760> blowing<00:01:23.060> them<00:01:23.360> up<00:01:23.390> is<00:01:23.690> literally

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:24.290 
rather than blowing them up is literally

00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:26.469 
rather than blowing them up is literally
just<00:01:24.500> fly<00:01:24.950> through<00:01:24.979> those<00:01:25.550> cables<00:01:26.090> with<00:01:26.450> a

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:26.479 
just fly through those cables with a

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:29.170 
just fly through those cables with a
helicopter<00:01:27.070> that's<00:01:28.070> enough<00:01:28.520> to<00:01:28.700> bring<00:01:28.910> down

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:29.180

this<00:01:29.420> crane<00:01:29.810> so<00:01:30.590> let's<00:01:30.740> talk<00:01:31.040> about<00:01:31.100> this

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:31.550 
this crane so let's talk about this

this crane so let's talk about this
LEvolution<00:01:32.360> is<00:01:32.570> it<00:01:32.750> a<00:01:32.870> gimmick<00:01:33.170> on<00:01:33.500> this

00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:33.650 
LEvolution is it a gimmick on this

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:36.040 
LEvolution is it a gimmick on this
particular<00:01:34.040> map<00:01:34.490> or<00:01:34.910> does<00:01:35.210> it<00:01:35.240> work<00:01:35.570> does<00:01:35.900> it

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:36.050 
particular map or does it work does it

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:39.010 
particular map or does it work does it
provide<00:01:36.470> something<00:01:37.130> different<00:01:37.820> one<00:01:38.810> of<00:01:38.930> the

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:39.020 
provide something different one of the

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:41.410 
provide something different one of the
important<00:01:39.650> things<00:01:39.890> to<00:01:40.009> note<00:01:40.400> is<00:01:40.790> when<00:01:41.210> this

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:41.420 
important things to note is when this

00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:43.630 
important things to note is when this
crane<00:01:41.780> comes<00:01:42.170> down<00:01:42.470> it<00:01:43.009> does<00:01:43.280> actually<00:01:43.400> make

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:43.640 
crane comes down it does actually make

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.230 
crane comes down it does actually make
some<00:01:44.119> kind<00:01:44.780> of<00:01:44.930> significant<00:01:45.710> changes<00:01:46.280> to<00:01:47.030> the

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:47.240 
some kind of significant changes to the

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.660 
some kind of significant changes to the
buildings<00:01:47.690> around<00:01:47.869> and<00:01:48.380> what<00:01:48.650> it<00:01:48.860> does<00:01:49.070> is

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:49.670 
buildings around and what it does is

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:52.540 
buildings around and what it does is
provide<00:01:50.210> new<00:01:50.540> roots<00:01:50.869> as<00:01:51.110> you<00:01:51.259> can<00:01:51.410> see<00:01:51.710> in<00:01:51.979> and

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:52.550 
provide new roots as you can see in and

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:54.340 
provide new roots as you can see in and
out<00:01:52.670> of<00:01:52.910> these<00:01:53.060> buildings<00:01:53.390> now<00:01:53.960> if<00:01:54.080> you<00:01:54.200> look

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:54.350 
out of these buildings now if you look

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:56.410 
out of these buildings now if you look
up<00:01:54.530> there<00:01:54.800> you<00:01:55.160> can<00:01:55.310> actually<00:01:55.550> use<00:01:56.030> that<00:01:56.270> as<00:01:56.390> a

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.420 
up there you can actually use that as a

00:01:56.420 --> 00:01:59.590 
up there you can actually use that as a
platform<00:01:56.720> to<00:01:57.170> peek<00:01:57.530> down<00:01:57.920> into<00:01:58.460> this<00:01:58.580> room<00:01:58.910> you

00:01:59.590 --> 00:01:59.600 
platform to peek down into this room you

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:02.290 
platform to peek down into this room you
get<00:01:59.899> up<00:02:00.200> to<00:02:00.770> that<00:02:00.920> position<00:02:01.190> through<00:02:02.060> the

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:02.300 
get up to that position through the

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:04.450 
get up to that position through the
crane<00:02:02.600> you<00:02:02.869> can<00:02:03.050> just<00:02:03.229> run<00:02:03.500> along<00:02:03.680> it<00:02:03.979> and<00:02:04.009> peek

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:04.460 
crane you can just run along it and peek

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:07.240 
crane you can just run along it and peek
down<00:02:04.850> into<00:02:05.390> the<00:02:05.509> room<00:02:05.810> so<00:02:06.649> whilst<00:02:06.890> this

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:07.250 
down into the room so whilst this

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:10.210 
down into the room so whilst this
LEvolution<00:02:08.060> is<00:02:08.239> not<00:02:09.050> on<00:02:09.200> the<00:02:09.350> same<00:02:09.590> scale<00:02:09.979> of

00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:10.220 
LEvolution is not on the same scale of

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.420 
LEvolution is not on the same scale of
safe<00:02:10.459> flood<00:02:10.820> throne<00:02:11.150> in<00:02:11.360> battlefield<00:02:11.900> 4<00:02:11.959> which

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:12.430 
safe flood throne in battlefield 4 which

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:15.100 
safe flood throne in battlefield 4 which
completely<00:02:13.430> changes<00:02:14.209> the<00:02:14.239> dynamic<00:02:14.870> of<00:02:14.959> the

00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:15.110 
completely changes the dynamic of the

00:02:15.110 --> 00:02:17.830 
completely changes the dynamic of the
map<00:02:15.290> or<00:02:15.530> Gulf<00:02:15.830> of<00:02:15.950> Oman<00:02:16.100> with<00:02:17.030> the<00:02:17.269> incredible

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:17.840 
map or Gulf of Oman with the incredible

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.680 
map or Gulf of Oman with the incredible
dust<00:02:18.530> storm<00:02:18.860> that<00:02:19.070> comes<00:02:19.220> in<00:02:19.519> I<00:02:19.730> believe<00:02:20.660> that

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690 
dust storm that comes in I believe that

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:22.870 
dust storm that comes in I believe that
this<00:02:20.959> and<00:02:21.140> evolution<00:02:21.590> isn't<00:02:21.860> actually<00:02:22.400> bad

00:02:22.870 --> 00:02:22.880 
this and evolution isn't actually bad

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.300 
this and evolution isn't actually bad
when<00:02:23.209> you<00:02:23.239> think<00:02:23.600> about<00:02:23.720> the<00:02:24.019> way<00:02:24.290> it<00:02:24.680> will

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:25.310 
when you think about the way it will

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:28.060 
when you think about the way it will
change<00:02:25.820> some<00:02:26.390> of<00:02:26.420> the<00:02:26.540> focus<00:02:27.170> of<00:02:27.320> the<00:02:27.470> infantry

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:28.070 
change some of the focus of the infantry

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:30.370 
change some of the focus of the infantry
gameplay<00:02:28.640> if<00:02:28.910> people<00:02:29.600> are<00:02:29.690> using<00:02:29.870> it<00:02:30.110> to<00:02:30.260> its

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:30.380 
gameplay if people are using it to its

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:32.680 
gameplay if people are using it to its
potential<00:02:30.769> as<00:02:31.190> I<00:02:31.580> say<00:02:31.730> it<00:02:31.880> kind<00:02:32.209> of<00:02:32.330> creates

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:32.690 
potential as I say it kind of creates

00:02:32.690 --> 00:02:35.590 
potential as I say it kind of creates
new<00:02:32.989> walkways<00:02:33.590> and<00:02:33.620> pathways<00:02:34.580> across<00:02:35.180> the<00:02:35.390> map

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:35.600 
new walkways and pathways across the map

00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:38.170 
new walkways and pathways across the map
that<00:02:36.380> weren't<00:02:36.769> there<00:02:37.160> before<00:02:37.220> you<00:02:37.880> see<00:02:38.060> this

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:38.180 
that weren't there before you see this

00:02:38.180 --> 00:02:40.330 
that weren't there before you see this
pathway<00:02:38.510> I'm<00:02:38.870> on<00:02:39.019> at<00:02:39.170> the<00:02:39.260> moment<00:02:39.440> takes<00:02:40.160> me

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:40.340 
pathway I'm on at the moment takes me

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:43.240 
pathway I'm on at the moment takes me
directly<00:02:40.600> into<00:02:41.600> this<00:02:41.750> building<00:02:42.290> here<00:02:42.680> so<00:02:43.220> I

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:43.250 
directly into this building here so I

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:45.009 
directly into this building here so I
believe<00:02:43.610> that<00:02:43.760> this<00:02:43.850> revolution<00:02:44.450> does<00:02:44.750> play

00:02:45.009 --> 00:02:45.019 
believe that this revolution does play

00:02:45.019 --> 00:02:46.840 
believe that this revolution does play
into<00:02:45.080> the<00:02:45.380> theme<00:02:45.620> of<00:02:45.769> battlefield<00:02:46.400> hardline

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:46.850 
into the theme of battlefield hardline

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:50.530 
into the theme of battlefield hardline
in<00:02:47.200> that<00:02:48.200> it<00:02:48.500> can<00:02:48.920> change<00:02:49.489> up<00:02:49.880> the<00:02:50.239> type<00:02:50.510> of

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:50.540 
in that it can change up the type of

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:53.410 
in that it can change up the type of
infantry<00:02:51.320> combat<00:02:51.530> you<00:02:51.890> have<00:02:52.160> on<00:02:52.489> a<00:02:52.549> horizontal

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:53.420 
infantry combat you have on a horizontal

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:55.509 
infantry combat you have on a horizontal
and<00:02:53.959> vertical<00:02:54.410> level<00:02:54.739> it<00:02:54.890> gives<00:02:55.160> you<00:02:55.310> new

00:02:55.509 --> 00:02:55.519 
and vertical level it gives you new

00:02:55.519 --> 00:02:57.729 
and vertical level it gives you new
pathways<00:02:56.180> across<00:02:56.600> the<00:02:56.810> map<00:02:57.019> the<00:02:57.470> biggest

00:02:57.729 --> 00:02:57.739 
pathways across the map the biggest

00:02:57.739 --> 00:02:59.530 
pathways across the map the biggest
downfall<00:02:58.430> to<00:02:58.549> this<00:02:58.670> revolution<00:02:59.299> at<00:02:59.450> the

00:02:59.530 --> 00:02:59.540 
downfall to this revolution at the

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:01.630 
downfall to this revolution at the
moment<00:02:59.989> in<00:03:00.140> my<00:03:00.350> mind<00:03:00.650> is<00:03:00.890> the<00:03:01.160> rather

00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:01.640 
moment in my mind is the rather

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:04.390 
moment in my mind is the rather
ridiculous<00:03:02.330> and<00:03:02.959> incredible<00:03:03.560> screen<00:03:04.010> shake

00:03:04.390 --> 00:03:04.400 
ridiculous and incredible screen shake

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:07.660 
ridiculous and incredible screen shake
that<00:03:05.090> it<00:03:05.390> causes<00:03:05.750> when<00:03:06.440> the<00:03:06.769> crane<00:03:07.010> is<00:03:07.280> falling

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:07.670

but I am absolutely certain and I have

00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:13.550 
but I am absolutely certain and I have
faith<00:03:11.400> that<00:03:11.460> that<00:03:11.910> must<00:03:12.330> be<00:03:12.630> toned<00:03:13.020> down<00:03:13.140> for

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:13.560 
faith that that must be toned down for

00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:15.830 
faith that that must be toned down for
the<00:03:13.830> main<00:03:14.070> game<00:03:14.310> release<00:03:14.640> after<00:03:15.090> all<00:03:15.510> this<00:03:15.630> is

a<00:03:15.870> meter<00:03:16.260> a<00:03:16.620> few<00:03:16.920> Americans<00:03:17.400> are<00:03:17.520> beta<00:03:17.760> so<00:03:18.690> that

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:19.680 
a meter a few Americans are beta so that

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:21.320 
a meter a few Americans are beta so that
is<00:03:20.010> the<00:03:20.310> sort<00:03:20.550> of<00:03:20.640> feedback<00:03:20.880> that<00:03:21.120> they

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:21.330 
is the sort of feedback that they

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:24.830 
is the sort of feedback that they
require<00:03:21.900> from<00:03:22.200> us<00:03:22.350> in<00:03:22.590> a<00:03:22.710> beta<00:03:22.920> so<00:03:23.670> I'm<00:03:24.000> certain

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:24.840 
require from us in a beta so I'm certain

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:27.110 
require from us in a beta so I'm certain
that<00:03:24.870> that<00:03:25.080> screen<00:03:25.560> shake<00:03:25.890> will<00:03:26.370> be<00:03:26.610> reduced

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120 
that that screen shake will be reduced

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.060 
that that screen shake will be reduced
