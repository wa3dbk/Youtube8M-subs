blowback actually does go back pretty

00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:29.870 
blowback actually does go back pretty
far<00:00:27.990> even<00:00:28.590> though<00:00:28.859> the<00:00:29.039> blowback<00:00:29.369> itself<00:00:29.789> i

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:29.880 
far even though the blowback itself i

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.609 
far even though the blowback itself i
gotta<00:00:30.060> you're<00:00:30.210> close<00:00:30.359> to<00:00:30.390> this<00:00:30.810> the<00:00:31.289> blowback

00:00:31.609 --> 00:00:31.619 
gotta you're close to this the blowback

00:00:31.619 --> 00:00:33.440 
gotta you're close to this the blowback
itself<00:00:31.980> doesn't<00:00:32.399> really<00:00:32.669> do<00:00:32.910> anything<00:00:33.149> it's

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:33.450 
itself doesn't really do anything it's

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.319 
itself doesn't really do anything it's
just<00:00:33.540> there<00:00:33.989> for<00:00:34.610> kicks<00:00:35.610> and<00:00:35.700> giggles<00:00:35.790> i<00:00:36.120> guess

00:00:36.319 --> 00:00:36.329 
just there for kicks and giggles i guess

00:00:36.329 --> 00:00:39.350 
just there for kicks and giggles i guess
but<00:00:37.260> it<00:00:37.350> does<00:00:37.500> reduce<00:00:37.649> it<00:00:38.040> does<00:00:38.250> produce<00:00:38.579> a<00:00:38.910> lot

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:39.360 
but it does reduce it does produce a lot

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:40.790 
but it does reduce it does produce a lot
of<00:00:39.540> cake<00:00:39.840> i<00:00:39.989> can<00:00:40.140> tell<00:00:40.290> you<00:00:40.410> that<00:00:40.530> right<00:00:40.590> now

00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:40.800 
of cake i can tell you that right now

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.340 
of cake i can tell you that right now
very<00:00:41.399> simplistic<00:00:41.879> way<00:00:42.059> of<00:00:42.180> doing<00:00:42.570> it<00:00:42.660> there's

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:43.350 
very simplistic way of doing it there's

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.660 
very simplistic way of doing it there's
literally<00:00:43.590> basically<00:00:44.100> just<00:00:44.219> a<00:00:44.309> hole<00:00:44.460> in<00:00:44.489> the

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:44.670 
literally basically just a hole in the

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:46.310 
literally basically just a hole in the
back<00:00:44.910> and<00:00:45.180> i'll<00:00:45.300> show<00:00:45.329> you<00:00:45.480> this<00:00:45.660> in<00:00:45.960> just<00:00:46.230> a

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
back and i'll show you this in just a

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.779 
back and i'll show you this in just a
second<00:00:46.649> it's<00:00:46.980> basically<00:00:47.219> just<00:00:47.340> a<00:00:47.489> hole<00:00:47.640> in<00:00:47.730> the

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
second it's basically just a hole in the

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.850 
second it's basically just a hole in the
back<00:00:47.940> so<00:00:48.090> the<00:00:48.210> gas<00:00:48.329> goes<00:00:48.570> into<00:00:49.079> the<00:00:49.170> BB<00:00:49.379> in<00:00:49.559> into

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:49.860 
back so the gas goes into the BB in into

00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.200 
back so the gas goes into the BB in into
the<00:00:49.950> slide<00:00:50.190> so<00:00:50.340> it's<00:00:50.460> very<00:00:50.640> simple<00:00:50.879> and<00:00:51.120> it

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:51.210 
the slide so it's very simple and it

00:00:51.210 --> 00:00:53.600 
the slide so it's very simple and it
makes<00:00:51.329> a<00:00:51.390> lot<00:00:51.539> of<00:00:51.600> kick<00:00:51.870> and<00:00:52.399> because<00:00:53.399> that<00:00:53.579> i

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:53.610 
makes a lot of kick and because that i

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:54.500 
makes a lot of kick and because that i
don't<00:00:53.850> think<00:00:53.879> it'll<00:00:54.090> be<00:00:54.149> shootin<00:00:54.480> like

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:54.510 
don't think it'll be shootin like

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.750 
don't think it'll be shootin like
ridiculously<00:00:54.989> fast<00:00:55.410> like<00:00:56.070> the<00:00:56.219> other<00:00:56.340> co<00:00:56.579> 2

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:56.760 
ridiculously fast like the other co 2

00:00:56.760 --> 00:00:58.779 
ridiculously fast like the other co 2

295<00:01:23.409> 294<00:01:26.290> 282<00:01:27.290> all<00:01:27.890> right<00:01:28.040> so<00:01:28.130> it<00:01:28.220> seemed<00:01:28.340> to<00:01:28.430> be

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:28.490 
295 294 282 all right so it seemed to be

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:30.370 
295 294 282 all right so it seemed to be
fluctuating<00:01:28.909> around<00:01:29.270> 300<00:01:29.750> feet<00:01:29.900> per<00:01:30.020> second

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:30.380 
fluctuating around 300 feet per second

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:32.350 
fluctuating around 300 feet per second
and<00:01:30.470> 300<00:01:30.920> feet<00:01:31.040> per<00:01:31.159> second<00:01:31.490> is<00:01:31.610> going<00:01:31.970> to<00:01:32.150> be

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:32.360 
and 300 feet per second is going to be

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:35.320 
and 300 feet per second is going to be
the<00:01:32.570> average<00:01:32.840> if<00:01:33.290> you're<00:01:33.680> asking<00:01:33.800> why<00:01:34.430> the<00:01:34.490> co2

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:35.330 
the average if you're asking why the co2

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:37.990 
the average if you're asking why the co2
one<00:01:35.509> fires<00:01:36.009> solo<00:01:37.009> the<00:01:37.280> reason<00:01:37.580> is<00:01:37.670> because<00:01:37.700> a

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:38.000 
one fires solo the reason is because a

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.149 
one fires solo the reason is because a
lot<00:01:38.479> of<00:01:38.509> the<00:01:38.720> gas<00:01:39.290> is<00:01:39.530> actually<00:01:39.649> going<00:01:39.950> into

00:01:40.149 --> 00:01:40.159 
lot of the gas is actually going into

00:01:40.159 --> 00:01:41.590 
lot of the gas is actually going into
the<00:01:40.310> slide<00:01:40.520> and<00:01:40.550> that<00:01:40.880> believe<00:01:41.180> me<00:01:41.270> this<00:01:41.390> thing

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:41.600 
the slide and that believe me this thing

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.359 
the slide and that believe me this thing
kicks<00:01:41.869> more<00:01:42.350> than<00:01:42.530> your<00:01:42.619> standard<00:01:42.830> blowback

00:01:43.359 --> 00:01:43.369 
kicks more than your standard blowback

00:01:43.369 --> 00:01:46.210 
kicks more than your standard blowback
gun<00:01:43.840> the<00:01:44.840> way<00:01:44.990> this<00:01:45.200> works<00:01:45.470> and<00:01:45.740> actually<00:01:46.070> they

00:01:46.210 --> 00:01:46.220 
gun the way this works and actually they

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:47.889 
gun the way this works and actually they
didn't<00:01:46.460> have<00:01:46.580> any<00:01:46.759> way<00:01:47.000> of<00:01:47.180> distributing<00:01:47.600> it

00:01:47.889 --> 00:01:47.899 
didn't have any way of distributing it

00:01:47.899 --> 00:01:49.570 
didn't have any way of distributing it
so<00:01:48.170> they<00:01:48.259> just<00:01:48.290> did<00:01:48.590> the<00:01:48.710> simplest<00:01:49.159> way<00:01:49.399> they

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:49.580 
so they just did the simplest way they

00:01:49.580 --> 00:01:51.700 
so they just did the simplest way they
could<00:01:49.850> if<00:01:50.479> I<00:01:50.600> can<00:01:50.750> show<00:01:51.020> you<00:01:51.110> this<00:01:51.259> there<00:01:51.619> you

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:51.710 
could if I can show you this there you

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:55.330 
could if I can show you this there you
go<00:01:52.000> there<00:01:53.000> is<00:01:53.179> a<00:01:53.649> little<00:01:54.649> hole<00:01:54.920> basically

00:01:55.330 --> 00:01:55.340 
go there is a little hole basically

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.460 
go there is a little hole basically
right<00:01:55.670> in<00:01:55.700> the<00:01:55.850> back<00:01:56.030> there<00:01:56.300> next<00:01:56.720> to<00:01:57.080> where

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:57.470 
right in the back there next to where

00:01:57.470 --> 00:02:00.219 
right in the back there next to where
the<00:01:57.500> BB<00:01:57.830> would<00:01:57.950> be<00:01:58.039> fired<00:01:58.250> and<00:01:58.399> in<00:01:59.270> short<00:01:59.630> the

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:00.229 
the BB would be fired and in short the

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:01.870 
the BB would be fired and in short the
gas<00:02:00.410> goes<00:02:00.679> into<00:02:00.920> the<00:02:00.979> BB<00:02:01.250> and<00:02:01.369> it<00:02:01.460> also<00:02:01.580> goes

00:02:01.870 --> 00:02:01.880 
gas goes into the BB and it also goes

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:03.969 
gas goes into the BB and it also goes
straight<00:02:02.330> back<00:02:02.360> into<00:02:02.660> the<00:02:02.810> slide<00:02:03.050> so<00:02:03.770> that's

00:02:03.969 --> 00:02:03.979 
straight back into the slide so that's

00:02:03.979 --> 00:02:06.520 
straight back into the slide so that's
literally<00:02:04.789> how<00:02:04.910> it<00:02:05.240> works<00:02:05.450> it<00:02:05.690> is<00:02:05.840> that<00:02:06.140> simple

00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.530 
literally how it works it is that simple

00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:09.100 
literally how it works it is that simple
and<00:02:06.860> it<00:02:07.369> reduces<00:02:07.550> a<00:02:07.910> lot<00:02:08.179> of<00:02:08.300> kick<00:02:08.509> where<00:02:08.959> it

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:09.110 
and it reduces a lot of kick where it

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:11.620 
and it reduces a lot of kick where it
produces<00:02:09.289> a<00:02:09.709> lot<00:02:10.039> of<00:02:10.070> kick<00:02:10.369> and<00:02:10.550> makes<00:02:11.330> a<00:02:11.390> BB

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:11.630 
produces a lot of kick and makes a BB

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:13.390 
produces a lot of kick and makes a BB
fire<00:02:11.840> about<00:02:12.050> 300<00:02:12.470> feet<00:02:12.530> per<00:02:12.680> second<00:02:13.010> I<00:02:13.100> don't

00:02:13.390 --> 00:02:13.400

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:22.059 
shooting 500 feet per second libation 45
is<00:02:20.000> completely<00:02:20.540> impractical<00:02:21.069> impractical

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:23.900 
enough that hurt and for a sidearm don't

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:25.270 
enough that hurt and for a sidearm don't
see<00:03:24.110> one<00:03:24.230> of<00:03:24.290> the<00:03:24.380> bb's<00:03:24.590> went<00:03:24.739> through<00:03:24.890> but<00:03:25.220> for

00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:25.280 
see one of the bb's went through but for

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:28.960 
see one of the bb's went through but for
a<00:03:25.459> sidearm<00:03:25.900> that's<00:03:27.130> good<00:03:28.130> enough<00:03:28.430> you<00:03:28.850> could

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:28.970 
a sidearm that's good enough you could

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:31.030 
a sidearm that's good enough you could
say<00:03:29.239> that<00:03:29.269> most<00:03:29.780> side<00:03:29.959> arms<00:03:30.170> are<00:03:30.290> about<00:03:30.470> 300

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:31.040 
say that most side arms are about 300

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:33.940 
say that most side arms are about 300
feet<00:03:31.310> per<00:03:31.489> second<00:03:32.110> 302<00:03:33.110> 330s<00:03:33.709> about<00:03:33.830> the

00:03:33.940 --> 00:03:33.950 
feet per second 302 330s about the

00:03:33.950 --> 00:03:35.470 
feet per second 302 330s about the
average<00:03:34.190> for<00:03:34.340> sidearms<00:03:34.730> so<00:03:34.970> it's<00:03:35.180> right<00:03:35.450> on

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:35.480 
average for sidearms so it's right on

00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:38.140 
average for sidearms so it's right on
pace<00:03:35.810> and<00:03:36.049> that<00:03:36.590> perfectly<00:03:37.250> in<00:03:37.519> my<00:03:37.670> mind<00:03:37.880> is<00:03:38.120> a

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:38.150 
pace and that perfectly in my mind is a

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:39.850 
pace and that perfectly in my mind is a
lot<00:03:38.540> better<00:03:38.690> than<00:03:38.900> having<00:03:38.989> it<00:03:39.170> at<00:03:39.319> 500<00:03:39.769> feet

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:39.860 
lot better than having it at 500 feet

00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:41.320 
lot better than having it at 500 feet
per<00:03:40.010> second<00:03:40.340> and<00:03:40.459> not<00:03:40.549> even<00:03:40.819> being<00:03:40.970> able<00:03:41.120> to

00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:41.330 
per second and not even being able to

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:43.210 
per second and not even being able to
use<00:03:41.450> it<00:03:41.599> in<00:03:41.660> games<00:03:41.870> all<00:03:42.709> right<00:03:42.830> well<00:03:42.980> there<00:03:43.099> you

00:03:43.210 --> 00:03:43.220 
use it in games all right well there you

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:44.680 
use it in games all right well there you
go<00:03:43.280> there's<00:03:43.640> the<00:03:43.790> conclusion<00:03:44.269> this<00:03:44.450> gun

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:44.690 
go there's the conclusion this gun

00:03:44.690 --> 00:03:47.050 
go there's the conclusion this gun
average<00:03:45.170> is<00:03:45.290> about<00:03:45.380> 300<00:03:46.220> feet<00:03:46.430> per<00:03:46.640> second

again like I said I much prefer 300 feet
per<00:03:49.970> second<00:03:50.299> then<00:03:50.420> like<00:03:50.630> 500<00:03:51.260> or<00:03:51.380> something

00:03:51.670 --> 00:03:51.680 
per second then like 500 or something

00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:54.340 
per second then like 500 or something
way<00:03:51.920> over<00:03:51.950> field<00:03:52.519> limits<00:03:52.910> the<00:03:53.690> gun<00:03:53.870> has<00:03:54.049> good

way over field limits the gun has good

00:03:54.350 --> 00:03:56.710 
way over field limits the gun has good
strong<00:03:54.739> blow<00:03:55.070> actress<00:03:55.459> and<00:03:55.670> it's<00:03:56.299> enough<00:03:56.570> to

strong blow actress and it's enough to
