 skewers with fresh fruit or with snacks 

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:31.480
 that is all preparation 

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:33.010

 tree can be generated that you see 

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:35.050

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:47.530
 The dry air is such that we are sufficient 

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:49.120

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:51.070
