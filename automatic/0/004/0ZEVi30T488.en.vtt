00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:16.150 
like to show you some ideas for tying

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:20.189 
like to show you some ideas for tying
the<00:00:16.539> pupa<00:00:17.320> stage<00:00:17.350> of<00:00:17.920> our<00:00:18.160> fall<00:00:18.520> canis<00:00:19.090> this<00:00:20.019> is

00:00:20.189 --> 00:00:20.199 
the pupa stage of our fall canis this is

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:22.499 
the pupa stage of our fall canis this is
perhaps<00:00:20.380> the<00:00:20.800> most<00:00:20.830> productive<00:00:21.669> fly<00:00:21.939> that<00:00:22.300> we

00:00:22.499 --> 00:00:22.509 
perhaps the most productive fly that we

00:00:22.509 --> 00:00:25.769 
perhaps the most productive fly that we
fish<00:00:22.779> with<00:00:23.050> during<00:00:24.029> September<00:00:25.029> October<00:00:25.329> and

00:00:25.769 --> 00:00:25.779 
fish with during September October and

00:00:25.779 --> 00:00:27.810 
fish with during September October and
early<00:00:26.050> November<00:00:26.310> for<00:00:27.310> our<00:00:27.400> sea<00:00:27.609> run

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:27.820 
early November for our sea run

cutthroats and some occasional steelhead

00:00:30.339 --> 00:00:34.460 
cutthroats and some occasional steelhead
here<00:00:31.150> in<00:00:31.239> the<00:00:31.329> northwest<00:00:32.370> the<00:00:33.370> fly<00:00:33.550> itself

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:34.470 
here in the northwest the fly itself

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:38.670 
here in the northwest the fly itself
it's<00:00:35.470> really<00:00:35.620> pretty<00:00:36.100> easy<00:00:36.280> to<00:00:36.550> tie<00:00:37.530> set<00:00:38.530> this

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:38.680 
it's really pretty easy to tie set this

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:42.389 
it's really pretty easy to tie set this
aside<00:00:39.870> and<00:00:40.870> we're<00:00:41.109> gonna<00:00:41.230> put<00:00:41.500> in<00:00:41.680> a<00:00:41.859> fairly

00:00:42.389 --> 00:00:42.399 
aside and we're gonna put in a fairly

00:00:42.399 --> 00:00:46.069 
aside and we're gonna put in a fairly
good-sized<00:00:42.969> hook<00:00:43.890> this<00:00:44.890> is<00:00:45.160> a<00:00:45.190> number<00:00:45.640> eight

00:00:46.069 --> 00:00:46.079 
good-sized hook this is a number eight

00:00:46.079 --> 00:00:53.400 
good-sized hook this is a number eight
it's<00:00:47.079> a<00:00:47.789> curved<00:00:49.199> nymph<00:00:50.199> hook<00:00:50.760> and<00:00:51.960> down.i<00:00:52.960> and

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:53.410 
it's a curved nymph hook and down.i and

00:00:53.410 --> 00:00:55.349 
it's a curved nymph hook and down.i and
we've<00:00:53.559> got<00:00:53.739> a<00:00:53.769> tungsten<00:00:54.070> bead<00:00:54.609> on<00:00:54.820> the<00:00:54.969> end<00:00:55.000> of

00:00:55.349 --> 00:00:55.359 
we've got a tungsten bead on the end of

00:00:55.359 --> 00:00:57.990 
we've got a tungsten bead on the end of
it<00:00:55.510> and<00:00:56.050> the<00:00:56.199> materials<00:00:56.710> were<00:00:56.859> used<00:00:57.100> really

00:00:57.990 --> 00:00:58.000 
it and the materials were used really

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.290 
it and the materials were used really
pretty<00:00:58.210> straightforward<00:00:59.579> first<00:01:00.579> the<00:01:00.760> body<00:01:00.969> is

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:01.300 
pretty straightforward first the body is

00:01:01.300 --> 00:01:03.329 
pretty straightforward first the body is
going<00:01:01.510> to<00:01:01.600> be<00:01:01.949> composed<00:01:02.949> of<00:01:03.129> two<00:01:03.190> different

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:03.339 
going to be composed of two different

00:01:03.339 --> 00:01:06.480 
going to be composed of two different
materials<00:01:04.150> we're<00:01:04.540> going<00:01:04.660> to<00:01:04.780> use<00:01:04.960> a<00:01:05.490> mixture

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:06.490 
materials we're going to use a mixture

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:08.910 
materials we're going to use a mixture
of<00:01:06.910> colors<00:01:07.689> here<00:01:07.900> this<00:01:08.110> is<00:01:08.200> called<00:01:08.380> golden

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:08.920 
of colors here this is called golden

00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.969 
of colors here this is called golden
stone<00:01:09.369> it's<00:01:09.820> a<00:01:10.079> little<00:01:11.079> bit<00:01:11.170> of<00:01:11.290> sparkle<00:01:11.710> to<00:01:11.950> it

00:01:11.969 --> 00:01:11.979 
stone it's a little bit of sparkle to it

00:01:11.979 --> 00:01:14.999 
stone it's a little bit of sparkle to it
looks<00:01:12.759> pretty<00:01:13.030> good<00:01:13.270> and<00:01:13.590> then<00:01:14.590> the<00:01:14.740> front

00:01:14.999 --> 00:01:15.009 
looks pretty good and then the front

00:01:15.009 --> 00:01:17.749 
looks pretty good and then the front
portion<00:01:15.670> of<00:01:15.939> think<00:01:16.390> we're<00:01:17.079> going<00:01:17.259> to<00:01:17.320> use<00:01:17.380> a

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
portion of think we're going to use a

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:22.170 
portion of think we're going to use a
some<00:01:18.759> rabbit<00:01:19.509> fur<00:01:19.750> that<00:01:20.079> has<00:01:20.290> a<00:01:20.770> little<00:01:21.729> Antron

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:22.180 
some rabbit fur that has a little Antron

00:01:22.180 --> 00:01:23.850 
some rabbit fur that has a little Antron
mixed<00:01:22.540> into<00:01:22.810> it<00:01:22.840> again<00:01:23.170> gives<00:01:23.470> it<00:01:23.619> a<00:01:23.740> little

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:23.860 
mixed into it again gives it a little

00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:27.389 
mixed into it again gives it a little
bit<00:01:24.070> of<00:01:24.189> sparkle<00:01:24.700> and<00:01:25.829> they'll<00:01:26.829> be<00:01:26.950> a<00:01:26.979> collar

00:01:27.389 --> 00:01:27.399 
bit of sparkle and they'll be a collar

00:01:27.399 --> 00:01:29.069 
bit of sparkle and they'll be a collar
on<00:01:27.729> this<00:01:27.939> thing<00:01:28.180> right<00:01:28.329> up<00:01:28.479> next<00:01:28.630> to<00:01:28.780> the<00:01:28.869> bead

00:01:29.069 --> 00:01:29.079 
on this thing right up next to the bead

00:01:29.079 --> 00:01:32.370 
on this thing right up next to the bead
and<00:01:29.110> that's<00:01:29.409> gonna<00:01:29.590> be<00:01:29.770> black<00:01:30.009> rabbit<00:01:30.430> fur<00:01:31.380> now

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:32.380 
and that's gonna be black rabbit fur now

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:34.469 
and that's gonna be black rabbit fur now
one<00:01:32.619> of<00:01:32.649> the<00:01:32.860> other<00:01:33.399> characteristics<00:01:33.939> that<00:01:34.360> we

00:01:34.469 --> 00:01:34.479 
one of the other characteristics that we

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:38.580 
one of the other characteristics that we
use<00:01:34.829> on<00:01:35.829> this<00:01:36.070> thing<00:01:36.340> would<00:01:36.640> be<00:01:36.820> the<00:01:37.290> legs<00:01:38.290> and

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:38.590 
use on this thing would be the legs and

00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:40.800 
use on this thing would be the legs and
antennae<00:01:38.740> and<00:01:39.460> for<00:01:39.909> that<00:01:40.090> we're<00:01:40.420> going<00:01:40.600> to<00:01:40.659> use

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:40.810 
antennae and for that we're going to use

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:43.289 
antennae and for that we're going to use
some<00:01:40.990> pheasant<00:01:41.439> rub<00:01:41.680> and<00:01:42.369> I<00:01:42.460> like<00:01:42.670> these<00:01:42.850> with

some pheasant rub and I like these with

00:01:43.299 --> 00:01:46.740 
some pheasant rub and I like these with
a<00:01:43.450> little<00:01:43.719> brown<00:01:43.930> tip<00:01:44.409> so<00:01:45.390> this<00:01:46.390> is<00:01:46.539> going<00:01:46.689> to

00:01:46.740 --> 00:01:46.750 
a little brown tip so this is going to

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:48.600 
a little brown tip so this is going to
be<00:01:46.840> a<00:01:46.869> wet<00:01:47.110> fly<00:01:47.380> so<00:01:47.770> you<00:01:47.829> want<00:01:48.039> to<00:01:48.130> prep<00:01:48.399> your

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890 
we're tied in by the tip and I'm gonna

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.440 
we're tied in by the tip and I'm gonna
preen<00:02:08.890> back<00:02:09.250> some<00:02:09.640> of<00:02:09.670> these<00:02:09.789> Barb's<00:02:10.240> now

00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:10.450

you<00:04:26.130> can<00:04:26.280> see<00:04:26.630> doesn't<00:04:27.630> really<00:04:27.750> matter<00:04:28.080> what

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:28.260 
you can see doesn't really matter what

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:29.870 
you can see doesn't really matter what
kind<00:04:28.320> of<00:04:28.560> dubbing<00:04:28.949> you're<00:04:29.100> using<00:04:29.340> on<00:04:29.610> the<00:04:29.699> nor

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:29.880 
kind of dubbing you're using on the nor

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:35.480 
kind of dubbing you're using on the nor
vice<00:04:30.150> they<00:04:30.840> all<00:04:30.960> go<00:04:31.110> on<00:04:31.229> pretty<00:04:31.440> easy<00:04:32.389> okay<00:04:34.490> and

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:35.490 
vice they all go on pretty easy okay and

00:04:35.490 --> 00:04:36.830 
vice they all go on pretty easy okay and
again<00:04:35.669> I'm<00:04:35.970> going<00:04:36.090> to<00:04:36.150> tighten<00:04:36.479> that<00:04:36.510> up<00:04:36.600> a<00:04:36.810> bit

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:36.840 
again I'm going to tighten that up a bit

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:43.730 
again I'm going to tighten that up a bit
come<00:04:39.199> back<00:04:40.199> to<00:04:40.560> our<00:04:41.690> midpoint<00:04:42.690> there<00:04:43.350> come

forward<00:04:44.419> you<00:04:45.419> build<00:04:45.660> up<00:04:45.840> the<00:04:45.990> thorax<00:04:46.470> region

00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:46.590 
forward you build up the thorax region

00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:51.350 
forward you build up the thorax region
okay<00:04:48.650> and<00:04:49.650> you<00:04:49.919> can<00:04:50.070> secure<00:04:50.520> the<00:04:50.729> three<00:04:50.940> you

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:51.360 
okay and you can secure the three you

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:52.790 
okay and you can secure the three you
want<00:04:51.479> to<00:04:51.630> do<00:04:51.810> that<00:04:51.990> when<00:04:52.199> you're<00:04:52.290> working<00:04:52.680> in

want to do that when you're working in
back<00:04:53.010> of<00:04:53.220> a<00:04:53.280> bead<00:04:53.550> so<00:04:53.850> it<00:04:53.940> doesn't<00:04:54.240> slip<00:04:54.510> off

00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:55.310

in other words go to the opposite
direction<00:05:02.789> that<00:05:03.180> we<00:05:03.300> laid<00:05:03.510> in<00:05:03.690> the<00:05:03.810> dubbing

00:05:04.390 --> 00:05:04.400 
direction that we laid in the dubbing

00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:06.200 
direction that we laid in the dubbing
and<00:05:05.400> then<00:05:05.550> we<00:05:05.639> give<00:05:05.789> it<00:05:05.880> a<00:05:05.910> bit<00:05:06.030> of<00:05:06.060> a

00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:06.210 
and then we give it a bit of a

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:08.270 
and then we give it a bit of a
segmentation<00:05:06.780> fact<00:05:07.289> just<00:05:07.710> go<00:05:07.860> right<00:05:08.070> up

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:08.280 
segmentation fact just go right up

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:10.250 
segmentation fact just go right up
through<00:05:08.430> the<00:05:08.610> thorax<00:05:09.000> with<00:05:09.240> it<00:05:09.419> run<00:05:10.080> that

over it end up to about there okay so
that'll<00:06:05.460> slope<00:06:05.760> that<00:06:05.970> back<00:06:06.210> where<00:06:06.419> it's

00:06:06.529 --> 00:06:06.539 
that'll slope that back where it's

00:06:06.539 --> 00:06:09.070 
that'll slope that back where it's
pretty<00:06:06.690> good
