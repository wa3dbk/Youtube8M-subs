00:00:11.100 --> 00:00:14.210
 in my name 

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:25.330
 I went back to the game because you guys 

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:31.270
 I like it a lot so I'll go the same 

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:31.270
 that is playing three scales 

00:00:32.629 --> 00:00:35.629
 when 

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:54.239
 basically basically 

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:06.040
 because many people 

00:01:14.830 --> 00:01:35.020
 and I love playing the three lots and they go 

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:38.840
 dice to prove it but I understand what 

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:40.670
 it's a way to play it but now I do not know 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.810
 how all the artifacts can be that 

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.810
 be more dangerous 

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:54.260
 it's basically 30 offer everyone go down 

00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:57.650
 and basically when he is right he 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:59.159
 bring one goes up more I feel and when 

00:01:57.650 --> 00:02:04.640
 destroy showed 

00:01:59.159 --> 00:02:04.640
 look for a hand portal 

00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:11.450
 basically 

00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:21.660
 the force regime in the house all the 

00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:25.940
 explosive late play 

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:25.940
 the tribute seeks 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.430
 but three 

00:02:32.569 --> 00:02:35.569
 i 

00:02:41.069 --> 00:02:44.069
 we search 

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:50.470
 very bad 

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:55.130
 transmits like in front of the mind 

00:02:55.410 --> 00:03:01.020
 Although it does not explode we are many 

00:02:58.510 --> 00:03:01.020
 pieces 

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:07.700
 I do not like 

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:20.650
 saunders I did not find space for 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:23.579
 put one 

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:23.579
 very good 

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:42.990
 obviously not 

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:46.340
 35 is necessary 

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:46.340
 we are not alone 

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:54.150
 and so 

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:54.150
 very good to get anyone out 

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:06.860
 newly designed I want to see 

00:04:13.370 --> 00:04:18.320
 two events a lot of people like relaunches me 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:23.709
 we have then I do not have praise 

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:23.709
 they would run but also 

00:04:28.970 --> 00:04:32.510
 and the contest 

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:38.020
 I like cheating 

00:04:41.650 --> 00:04:44.919
 a sun 

00:04:47.529 --> 00:04:54.129
 it can not be destroyed so he 

00:04:59.620 --> 00:05:05.980
 It does not hurt much 

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:15.210
 3 

00:05:23.719 --> 00:05:27.439
 if it is mature 

00:05:46.819 --> 00:05:49.819
 ah 

00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:56.229
 upside down 

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:04.870
 teacher 

00:06:07.980 --> 00:06:14.230
 I have also 

00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:16.330
 I put it in because I thought it was going to be 

00:06:14.230 --> 00:06:18.540
 something good if we want to see if now 

00:06:16.330 --> 00:06:21.460
 what he said 

00:06:18.540 --> 00:06:24.480
 fiancee monthly facetime in fiancÃ©s a 

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:24.480
 plays like drinking 

00:06:26.849 --> 00:06:29.849
 exists
