00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.370
 Cube here drive that is, he does not have 50 

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:09.240
 125 cubes 

00:00:07.370 --> 00:00:12.170
 wonderful to ride on 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.170
 Most Dusty 

00:00:12.730 --> 00:00:21.130
 and it's great that he looks like 

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:23.939
 fifty dollars but essentially fifty dollars strongly 

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:28.869
 differ in terms of maximum speed 

00:00:23.939 --> 00:00:32.860
 principle even look at the speedometer it 

00:00:28.869 --> 00:00:35.140
 immediately see what is different from pop 

00:00:32.860 --> 00:00:39.670
 pixels in the house are you having lunch and rather 

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:42.530
 just waiting for some clear male 

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:46.520
 up to 40 

00:00:42.530 --> 00:00:50.570
 need not go get accelerated to 22 

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:53.690
 also go for 140 it is very 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:58.020
 optimistically, he can see the network that he is all 

00:00:53.690 --> 00:01:04.560
 chrome twisting machine 5 y 

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:04.560
 Straight very well preserved there 

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:09.500
 two variations by the way outwardly 

00:01:10.259 --> 00:01:16.750
 this is a wine called japanese japanese 

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:19.299
 options and taiwan type as far as i know 

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:23.280
 maybe something confusing having seen what 

00:01:19.299 --> 00:01:25.720
 the internet is different because 

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:29.560
 Japanese he has chrome put 

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:31.810
 points this part of americans it will be 

00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:36.159
 plastics absolutely not beautiful such 

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:38.320
 square shaped standard form here 

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:40.179
 Here such huge your salt are combined 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:43.929
 and behind 

00:01:40.179 --> 00:01:48.340
 we get it on the wings yellow 

00:01:43.929 --> 00:01:51.759
 Turning red stop at the Americans 

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:54.159
 covered here in this place are stupid 

00:01:51.759 --> 00:01:56.950
 view absolutely plugs here this 

00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:59.890
 a convenient area is obtained on the spot 

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:01.869
 100 square while standing a block headlight 

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:04.380
 same with fangs like the front 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:07.410
 with square floats nicknames yellow 

00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:10.060
 looks awful 

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:12.720
 apparently there are just some americans 

00:02:10.060 --> 00:02:16.450
 your chips about 

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:20.260
 motorcycles in terms of how they should look 

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:21.970
 lights so there they have to 

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.680
 look like that is clearly visible 

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:27.300
 just a little japanese 

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:31.120
 redid the amerikosov 

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:32.770
 but one is pure japanese pure pole 

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:35.290
 the plan that he went from Japan 

00:02:32.770 --> 00:02:37.720
 made far away in Japan by 3 

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:41.110
 It is written that although China seems to say 

00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:43.800
 what else in Taiwan is done but not the essence 

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:49.140
 all Japanese parts show us 

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:49.140
 can 125 cubes 4 clocks 

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:58.019
 This is our own . 

00:02:54.060 --> 00:03:00.150
 one shock absorber rear wheels 10 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:05.250
 inches one and a half 

00:03:00.150 --> 00:03:10.459
 by 10 naturally kickstarted everything is very 

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:15.980
 convenient in terms of service itself 

00:03:10.459 --> 00:03:15.980
 service can be seen by the way . 

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:23.549
 eyes we will sleep what level left 

00:03:21.060 --> 00:03:25.260
 what color is it and how wonderful 

00:03:23.549 --> 00:03:29.250
 We need to change the way another one chip 

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:31.519
 held a speedometer when you need to do 

00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:31.519
 Togo 

00:03:32.620 --> 00:03:38.560
 Lights up every 1000 

00:03:36.099 --> 00:03:41.150
 kilometers Peter lights up I don't know 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:43.519
 I was upset as I did not write anything 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:46.189
 I suspect that this is some such every 

00:03:43.519 --> 00:03:50.540
 1000 control basis and not position 

00:03:46.189 --> 00:03:52.329
 every thousand canceled check all 

00:03:50.540 --> 00:03:55.040
 little things 

00:03:52.329 --> 00:03:57.230
 that's serving myself in principle 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:04:02.569
 Well, such things because immediately make butter 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:06.049
 affect this spirit here I bought it in 

00:04:02.569 --> 00:04:07.959
 june month quite by accident from that 

00:04:06.049 --> 00:04:11.359
 what have you been doing 

00:04:07.959 --> 00:04:13.790
 the seller repaint repaint it 

00:04:11.359 --> 00:04:22.039
 these are the last kaleri side panels 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:23.870
 and give the front wing is the standard 

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:27.919
 the color that is and so is written itself either 

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:29.720
 action that is, it turns out to change especially 

00:04:27.919 --> 00:04:30.440
 and you won't want to repaint 

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:33.919
 redness 

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:36.560
 set the mind is understandable 

00:04:33.919 --> 00:04:38.389
 so he questions try or baron 

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:40.780
 letters and if you register 

00:04:38.389 --> 00:04:44.060
 witnesses the situation will not be sober that 

00:04:40.780 --> 00:04:46.900
 color all de galis you but I'm not worried I 

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:46.900
 I see with such 

00:04:48.169 --> 00:04:56.719
 here we are all very cool in terms of external 

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:58.939
 kind of the way the differences still here name askew 

00:04:56.719 --> 00:04:59.810
 I cant get this plastic cap 

00:04:58.939 --> 00:05:04.610
 here is metal 

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:08.289
 Th so cool-looking loaf zavodki 

00:05:04.610 --> 00:05:08.289
 lock the reasons is 

00:05:10.169 --> 00:05:13.039
 to start it 

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:38.580
 it's not so much coming to 

00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:41.000
 which hair. 

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:44.200
 I need you extra 

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.200
 these room highlights 

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:50.210
 let him 

00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:54.190
 meet but the world is eternal and I overtones 

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:54.190
 very creative 

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:07.280
 from the fact that he did change tires and 

00:06:05.330 --> 00:06:10.449
 It was already pretty 

00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:10.449
 especially plaguing rubber 

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:15.129
 i set 

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:24.379
 Jackson all sorts to should as they call u 

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:27.469
 looks awesome 

00:06:24.379 --> 00:06:30.670
 but on the clutch they are worse than almost 

00:06:27.469 --> 00:06:32.500
 so shake and their mistakes 

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:35.260
 on the turn of course these worse cling 

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:38.020
 not a side grip is not all that 

00:06:35.260 --> 00:06:39.860
 consider not chase but they wanted 

00:06:38.020 --> 00:06:43.099
 much softer in terms of 

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:45.560
 you are standing 

00:06:43.099 --> 00:06:46.960
 disk tonus which is very cool because 

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:49.960
 what's the back 

00:06:46.960 --> 00:06:51.900
 its with trophic fee that first day 

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:55.240
 inside for me 

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:57.490
 rear pads although they are not stock but 

00:06:55.240 --> 00:07:00.940
 They already became such a Clodin to the police 

00:06:57.490 --> 00:07:03.599
 it doesn't work anymore this I learned for me 

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:07.780
 among the issue 

00:07:03.599 --> 00:07:11.990
 remove the rear wheel it is removed 

00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:13.880
 just take off the glushak 

00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:19.480
 he directly pushes they watched 

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:19.480
 already there are bad you need to take care of me 

00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:26.449
 here 

00:07:23.129 --> 00:07:26.449
 Here is the news 

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:30.740
 Naturally there is a glove box 

00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:44.849
 Pants get something like shit shit 

00:07:40.449 --> 00:07:44.849
 I sewed but not the selves themselves order and 

00:07:46.770 --> 00:07:51.970
 now in the course does not mean I want to say 

00:07:49.479 --> 00:07:55.599
 the ship he rented and because it is interesting 

00:07:51.970 --> 00:08:02.250
 write in comments write what you want 

00:07:55.599 --> 00:08:07.330
 learn about the model then say according to 

00:08:02.250 --> 00:08:10.289
 Be sure to take this out from 

00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:10.289
 corolla 125
