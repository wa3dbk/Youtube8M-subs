at<00:01:41.149> the<00:01:41.240> refer-a-friend<00:01:41.539> program<00:01:42.140> alright<00:01:42.890> so

00:01:43.029 --> 00:01:43.039 
at the refer-a-friend program alright so

00:01:43.039 --> 00:01:44.889 
at the refer-a-friend program alright so
the<00:01:43.130> fact<00:01:43.310> remains<00:01:43.610> it's<00:01:44.000> more<00:01:44.420> fun<00:01:44.630> to<00:01:44.660> play

00:01:44.889 --> 00:01:44.899 
the fact remains it's more fun to play

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:46.630 
the fact remains it's more fun to play
on<00:01:45.080> the<00:01:45.200> difference<00:01:45.530> but<00:01:46.190> the<00:01:46.280> problem<00:01:46.429> is

00:01:46.630 --> 00:01:46.640 
on the difference but the problem is

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:47.919 
on the difference but the problem is
there's<00:01:46.789> this<00:01:46.970> like<00:01:47.149> vertical<00:01:47.660> learning

00:01:47.919 --> 00:01:47.929 
there's this like vertical learning

00:01:47.929 --> 00:01:50.199 
there's this like vertical learning
curve<00:01:48.110> in<00:01:48.470> all<00:01:48.619> of<00:01:48.770> MOBA<00:01:49.130> and<00:01:49.849> it's<00:01:50.000> really

00:01:50.199 --> 00:01:50.209 
curve in all of MOBA and it's really

00:01:50.209 --> 00:01:51.520 
curve in all of MOBA and it's really
difficult<00:01:50.479> to<00:01:50.840> just<00:01:50.989> kind<00:01:51.140> of<00:01:51.170> jump<00:01:51.380> right

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:51.530 
difficult to just kind of jump right

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:53.080 
difficult to just kind of jump right
into<00:01:51.739> it<00:01:51.830> so<00:01:52.399> one<00:01:52.580> thing<00:01:52.670> that<00:01:52.729> we're<00:01:52.910> trying

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:53.090 
into it so one thing that we're trying

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:54.460 
into it so one thing that we're trying
to<00:01:53.179> do<00:01:53.270> with<00:01:53.300> from<00:01:53.660> three<00:01:53.840> point<00:01:53.989> 0<00:01:54.140> is

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:54.470 
to do with from three point 0 is

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:55.839 
to do with from three point 0 is
actually<00:01:54.920> introduced<00:01:55.369> this<00:01:55.489> new<00:01:55.700> with

00:01:55.839 --> 00:01:55.849 
actually introduced this new with

00:01:55.849 --> 00:01:57.729 
actually introduced this new with
refer-a-friend<00:01:56.179> program<00:01:56.780> along<00:01:57.289> with<00:01:57.349> a<00:01:57.500> lot

00:01:57.729 --> 00:01:57.739 
refer-a-friend program along with a lot

00:01:57.739 --> 00:01:59.350 
refer-a-friend program along with a lot
of<00:01:57.770> other<00:01:58.009> tools<00:01:58.250> like<00:01:58.520> pots<00:01:58.789> of<00:01:59.119> the<00:01:59.209> learner

00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.360 
of other tools like pots of the learner

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.059 
of other tools like pots of the learner
Toria<00:01:59.750> the<00:02:00.410> one<00:02:00.530> that<00:02:00.649> I'm<00:02:00.739> most<00:02:00.770> excited

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:02.720 
about is the refer-a-friend program

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.419 
about is the refer-a-friend program
specifically<00:02:03.530> because<00:02:03.770> when<00:02:04.039> i<00:02:04.069> was<00:02:04.220> getting

00:02:04.419 --> 00:02:04.429 
specifically because when i was getting

00:02:04.429 --> 00:02:06.249 
specifically because when i was getting
it<00:02:04.489> done<00:02:04.580> I<00:02:04.970> had<00:02:05.330> a<00:02:05.390> really<00:02:05.420> hard<00:02:05.660> time<00:02:05.840> getting

00:02:06.249 --> 00:02:06.259 
it done I had a really hard time getting

00:02:06.259 --> 00:02:07.930 
it done I had a really hard time getting

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:07.940 
my friends and so I was having a hard

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:10.300 
my friends and so I was having a hard
time<00:02:07.970> practicing<00:02:08.539> in<00:02:08.660> general<00:02:09.069> with<00:02:10.069> the<00:02:10.190> new

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 
time practicing in general with the new

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:11.860 
time practicing in general with the new
refer-a-friend<00:02:10.610> program<00:02:11.150> it's<00:02:11.599> actually

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:11.870 
refer-a-friend program it's actually

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:13.990 
refer-a-friend program it's actually
going<00:02:11.989> to<00:02:12.080> incentivize<00:02:12.470> both<00:02:12.800> funds<00:02:13.099> so<00:02:13.640> not
