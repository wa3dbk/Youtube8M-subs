your<00:04:29.610> favorite<00:04:29.970> at<00:04:30.060> the<00:04:30.330> top<00:04:30.510> that<00:04:31.290> way<00:04:31.350> that

00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:31.770 
your favorite at the top that way that

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:33.260 
your favorite at the top that way that
one<00:04:31.920> will<00:04:32.100> be<00:04:32.130> the<00:04:32.310> majority<00:04:32.430> of<00:04:32.760> the<00:04:32.910> icons

well go ahead and select as many as
possible<00:04:39.180> hopefully<00:04:39.840> by<00:04:40.200> then<00:04:40.350> all<00:04:40.590> your

00:04:41.030 --> 00:04:41.040 
possible hopefully by then all your
