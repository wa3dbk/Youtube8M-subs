straight<00:02:09.700> after<00:02:10.119> so<00:02:10.690> it's<00:02:10.840> like<00:02:10.959> a<00:02:10.989> sequence

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:11.440 
straight after so it's like a sequence

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.790 
straight after so it's like a sequence
of<00:02:11.590> bang<00:02:11.980> bang<00:02:12.160> on<00:02:12.370> to<00:02:13.470> straight<00:02:14.470> after<00:02:14.739> each

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:14.800 
of bang bang on to straight after each

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:16.110 
of bang bang on to straight after each
other<00:02:14.890> might<00:02:15.130> take<00:02:15.280> you<00:02:15.400> a<00:02:15.459> few<00:02:15.519> tries<00:02:15.760> but<00:02:15.880> I'm

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:16.120 
other might take you a few tries but I'm

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.410 
other might take you a few tries but I'm
just<00:02:16.180> gonna<00:02:16.300> demonstrate<00:02:16.570> it<00:02:16.900> real<00:02:16.959> quick

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
just gonna demonstrate it real quick

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.870 
just gonna demonstrate it real quick
just<00:02:19.420> like<00:02:19.540> that

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:21.880 

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:24.390 

and<00:02:22.360> so<00:02:22.570> if<00:02:22.870> you<00:02:22.990> saw<00:02:23.200> I<00:02:23.500> still<00:02:23.920> have<00:02:24.100> a<00:02:24.130> bottle

what was cafes masks masks it's now a

00:02:30.790 --> 00:02:33.930 
what was cafes masks masks it's now a
bottle<00:02:31.950> and<00:02:32.950> you<00:02:33.070> can<00:02:33.220> do<00:02:33.310> that<00:02:33.460> with<00:02:33.640> anything

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:33.940 
bottle and you can do that with anything

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.270 
bottle and you can do that with anything
you<00:02:34.030> can<00:02:34.210> do<00:02:34.330> that<00:02:34.480> even<00:02:34.810> with<00:02:35.050> say<00:02:35.800> an<00:02:35.980> item

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:36.280 
you can do that even with say an item

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.730 
you can do that even with say an item
that<00:02:36.400> has<00:02:36.580> zero<00:02:37.260> you<00:02:38.260> could<00:02:38.350> do<00:02:38.470> the<00:02:38.560> same

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:38.740 
that has zero you could do the same

00:02:38.740 --> 00:02:46.260 
that has zero you could do the same
thing<00:02:41.010> now<00:02:42.010> that's<00:02:42.130> a<00:02:42.280> bottle<00:02:42.520> too<00:02:44.940> however<00:02:45.940> it

00:02:46.260 --> 00:02:46.270 
thing now that's a bottle too however it

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:48.210 
thing now that's a bottle too however it
does<00:02:46.420> not<00:02:46.570> work<00:02:46.810> with<00:02:47.200> say<00:02:47.590> the<00:02:47.800> great<00:02:47.980> fairy

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:48.220 
does not work with say the great fairy

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:50.520 
does not work with say the great fairy
sword<00:02:48.690> since<00:02:49.690> you<00:02:49.810> need<00:02:49.930> to<00:02:50.020> pull<00:02:50.170> that<00:02:50.320> out<00:02:50.500> of

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:50.530 
sword since you need to pull that out of

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:54.090 
sword since you need to pull that out of
its<00:02:51.720> what<00:02:52.720> will<00:02:52.870> happen<00:02:53.170> is<00:02:53.320> that<00:02:53.620> will<00:02:53.890> just

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:54.100 
its what will happen is that will just

00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:58.710 
its what will happen is that will just
override<00:02:55.980> its<00:02:57.270> assuming<00:02:58.270> you<00:02:58.330> do<00:02:58.450> it<00:02:58.570> right

00:02:58.710 --> 00:02:58.720 
override its assuming you do it right

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.300 
override its assuming you do it right
that<00:02:58.840> would<00:02:58.990> just<00:02:59.140> override<00:02:59.560> the<00:02:59.800> cutscene

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:00.310 
that would just override the cutscene

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:03.330 
that would just override the cutscene
and<00:03:00.990> yeah<00:03:01.990> you<00:03:02.050> don't<00:03:02.290> pull<00:03:02.500> the<00:03:02.620> sword<00:03:02.800> out<00:03:02.920> so

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
and yeah you don't pull the sword out so

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.480 
and yeah you don't pull the sword out so
you<00:03:03.400> don't<00:03:03.520> duplicate<00:03:03.910> anything<00:03:05.220> and<00:03:06.220> if<00:03:06.370> you

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:06.490 
you don't duplicate anything and if you

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:08.520 
you don't duplicate anything and if you
fail<00:03:06.700> say<00:03:07.120> you<00:03:07.180> you<00:03:07.660> know<00:03:07.780> you<00:03:07.960> didn't<00:03:08.170> do<00:03:08.230> get

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:08.530 
fail say you you know you didn't do get

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:11.580 
fail say you you know you didn't do get
your<00:03:08.650> mask<00:03:08.860> on<00:03:09.040> the<00:03:09.160> first<00:03:09.340> try<00:03:10.170> then<00:03:11.170> just<00:03:11.440> go

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:11.590 
your mask on the first try then just go

00:03:11.590 --> 00:03:14.700 
your mask on the first try then just go
ahead<00:03:11.790> go<00:03:12.790> into<00:03:13.060> this<00:03:13.150> house<00:03:13.390> or<00:03:13.810> wherever

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:14.710 
ahead go into this house or wherever

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:17.280 
ahead go into this house or wherever
else<00:03:14.890> is<00:03:15.130> convenient<00:03:15.460> for<00:03:15.610> you<00:03:15.990> just<00:03:16.990> reload

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:17.290 
else is convenient for you just reload

00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:21.720 
else is convenient for you just reload
the<00:03:17.410> area<00:03:17.650> they'll<00:03:17.860> be<00:03:18.010> another<00:03:18.220> fairy<00:03:20.730> so

00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:21.730 
the area they'll be another fairy so

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:23.430 
the area they'll be another fairy so
I'll<00:03:21.790> demonstrate<00:03:21.940> it<00:03:22.300> one<00:03:22.360> last<00:03:22.510> time<00:03:22.780> go

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:23.440 
I'll demonstrate it one last time go

00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:25.530 
I'll demonstrate it one last time go
through<00:03:23.620> this<00:03:23.680> stuff<00:03:23.920> gotcha<00:03:24.880> fairy<00:03:25.210> and<00:03:25.420> make

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:25.540 
through this stuff gotcha fairy and make

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:29.660 
through this stuff gotcha fairy and make
sure<00:03:25.690> the<00:03:25.810> bottles<00:03:26.080> in<00:03:26.170> your<00:03:26.290> hand<00:03:28.200> now<00:03:29.200> start

00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:29.670 
sure the bottles in your hand now start

sure the bottles in your hand now start
hold<00:03:30.670> the<00:03:30.730> joystick<00:03:31.090> just<00:03:31.240> a<00:03:31.330> little<00:03:31.570> bit

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:31.690 
hold the joystick just a little bit

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:33.360 
hold the joystick just a little bit
until<00:03:31.780> the<00:03:31.960> link<00:03:32.080> slides<00:03:32.350> I<00:03:32.680> think<00:03:32.740> you<00:03:33.100> can<00:03:33.250> do

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:33.370 
until the link slides I think you can do

00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:36.930 
until the link slides I think you can do
this<00:03:33.520> either<00:03:33.640> right<00:03:33.970> I<00:03:35.550> hope<00:03:36.550> I<00:03:36.610> failed<00:03:36.790> that

00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:36.940 
this either right I hope I failed that

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:41.540 
this either right I hope I failed that
time

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:41.550 

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:45.630 

anyway<00:03:42.550> point<00:03:42.760> is<00:03:44.100> I'm<00:03:45.100> gonna<00:03:45.250> do<00:03:45.400> it<00:03:45.490> right

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:45.640 
anyway point is I'm gonna do it right

00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:54.150 
anyway point is I'm gonna do it right
this<00:03:45.700> time<00:03:45.880> this<00:03:46.180> way<00:03:52.620> the<00:03:53.620> hardest<00:03:53.920> part<00:03:54.070> of

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:54.160 
this time this way the hardest part of

00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:59.640 
this time this way the hardest part of
this<00:03:54.220> trick<00:03:54.460> is<00:03:54.580> the<00:03:54.610> timing<00:03:54.970> by<00:03:55.900> far<00:03:58.650> because

00:03:59.640 --> 00:03:59.650 
this trick is the timing by far because

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:01.260 
this trick is the timing by far because
if<00:03:59.920> you<00:04:00.010> don't<00:04:00.190> press<00:04:00.400> the<00:04:00.640> mask<00:04:00.850> right<00:04:01.060> at<00:04:01.210> the

00:04:01.260 --> 00:04:01.270 
if you don't press the mask right at the

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:03.180 
if you don't press the mask right at the
right<00:04:01.390> moment<00:04:01.780> then<00:04:02.440> you<00:04:02.590> don't<00:04:02.770> duplicate

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:03.190 
right moment then you don't duplicate

00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:05.190 
right moment then you don't duplicate
over<00:04:03.430> it<00:04:03.490> and<00:04:03.580> you<00:04:03.640> just<00:04:03.790> empty<00:04:04.060> your<00:04:04.180> very<00:04:04.390> so

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:05.200 
over it and you just empty your very so

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:07.410 
over it and you just empty your very so
anyway<00:04:05.440> do<00:04:05.620> ESS<00:04:06.040> position<00:04:06.490> to<00:04:06.850> the<00:04:06.970> left<00:04:07.000> is

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:07.420 
anyway do ESS position to the left is

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:09.390 
anyway do ESS position to the left is
preferable<00:04:08.110> watch<00:04:08.320> but<00:04:08.770> whichever<00:04:09.070> way<00:04:09.250> works

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:09.400 
preferable watch but whichever way works

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:14.870 
preferable watch but whichever way works
for<00:04:09.550> you<00:04:09.700> is<00:04:09.790> fine<00:04:10.920> ESS<00:04:11.920> and<00:04:12.310> then<00:04:12.820> bing<00:04:13.330> bang

00:04:14.870 --> 00:04:14.880 
for you is fine ESS and then bing bang

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:17.849 
for you is fine ESS and then bing bang
and<00:04:15.880> there<00:04:16.419> you<00:04:16.510> go<00:04:16.630> that's<00:04:17.079> basically<00:04:17.650> all

00:04:17.849 --> 00:04:17.859 
and there you go that's basically all

00:04:17.859 --> 00:04:18.569 
and there you go that's basically all
there<00:04:18.010> is<00:04:18.130> to<00:04:18.310> it

00:04:18.569 --> 00:04:18.579 
there is to it

00:04:18.579 --> 00:04:21.060 
there is to it
hope<00:04:18.910> you<00:04:19.000> guys<00:04:19.120> found<00:04:19.269> this<00:04:19.450> useful<00:04:19.630> and<00:04:20.070> yeah
