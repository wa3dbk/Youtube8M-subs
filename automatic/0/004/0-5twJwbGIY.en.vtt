wherever you are when you're using an
oil<00:00:42.870> type<00:00:43.140> product<00:00:44.000> before<00:00:45.000> we<00:00:45.089> use<00:00:45.269> the

00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:45.390 
oil type product before we use the

00:00:45.390 --> 00:00:46.910 
oil type product before we use the
textile<00:00:45.839> we're<00:00:45.960> gonna<00:00:46.049> give<00:00:46.199> it<00:00:46.320> a<00:00:46.500> really

00:00:46.910 --> 00:00:46.920 
textile we're gonna give it a really

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.920 
textile we're gonna give it a really
good<00:00:46.949> shake<00:00:47.070> to<00:00:47.670> make<00:00:48.210> sure<00:00:48.420> it's<00:00:48.570> completely

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:48.930 
good shake to make sure it's completely

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.020 
good shake to make sure it's completely
mixed<00:00:49.260> up<00:00:49.409> and<00:00:49.739> then<00:00:50.159> we're<00:00:50.489> really<00:00:50.640> ready<00:00:50.790> to

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:51.030 
mixed up and then we're really ready to

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.530 
mixed up and then we're really ready to
go<00:00:52.460> when<00:00:53.460> you<00:00:53.549> release<00:00:53.760> a<00:00:53.850> girl<00:00:54.030> you<00:00:54.180> simply

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:54.540 
go when you release a girl you simply

00:00:54.540 --> 00:01:07.420 
go when you release a girl you simply
paint<00:00:54.780> it<00:00:54.960> evenly<00:00:55.440> and<00:00:55.710> smoothly

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:07.430 

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:09.490 

as<00:01:07.670> you<00:01:07.790> can<00:01:07.910> see<00:01:08.180> it's<00:01:08.330> um<00:01:08.540> penetrates<00:01:09.230> into

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:09.500 
as you can see it's um penetrates into

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:13.480 
as you can see it's um penetrates into
the<00:01:09.620> wood<00:01:10.750> now<00:01:11.750> allows<00:01:11.990> the<00:01:12.200> grain<00:01:12.440> to<00:01:13.250> show

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:13.490 
the wood now allows the grain to show

00:01:13.490 --> 00:02:04.250 
the wood now allows the grain to show
through

00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:04.260 

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:07.310 

so<00:02:04.830> we're<00:02:04.950> coming<00:02:05.040> near<00:02:05.340> the<00:02:05.400> end<00:02:05.610> of<00:02:06.320> the

00:02:07.310 --> 00:02:07.320 
so we're coming near the end of the

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.570 
so we're coming near the end of the
painting<00:02:07.890> of<00:02:08.190> the<00:02:08.480> text<00:02:09.480> role<00:02:09.660> now<00:02:10.460> and<00:02:11.460> you

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:11.580 
painting of the text role now and you

00:02:11.580 --> 00:02:14.240 
painting of the text role now and you
can<00:02:11.700> see<00:02:11.880> it's<00:02:12.030> darkened<00:02:12.480> up<00:02:12.660> and<00:02:13.470> improve<00:02:14.010> the

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250 
can see it's darkened up and improve the

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.850 
can see it's darkened up and improve the
texture<00:02:14.640> already<00:02:15.060> but<00:02:15.870> it<00:02:15.990> is<00:02:16.080> an<00:02:16.230> oil<00:02:16.500> and<00:02:16.680> it

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:16.860 
texture already but it is an oil and it

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:24.680 
texture already but it is an oil and it
sinks<00:02:17.190> in<00:02:17.340> overtime<00:02:23.420> that's<00:02:24.420> what<00:02:24.570> we're

00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:24.690 
sinks in overtime that's what we're

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:30.050 
sinks in overtime that's what we're
looking<00:02:24.960> for<00:02:26.180> it's<00:02:27.180> not<00:02:27.240> a<00:02:27.390> varnish<00:02:28.580> so<00:02:29.580> it

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:30.060 
looking for it's not a varnish so it

00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:39.100 
looking for it's not a varnish so it
keeps<00:02:30.210> on<00:02:30.420> working<00:02:36.710> very<00:02:37.710> easy<00:02:37.890> to<00:02:38.100> use<00:02:38.310> and

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:39.110 
keeps on working very easy to use and

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:42.410 
keeps on working very easy to use and
together<00:02:40.110> with<00:02:40.290> Metro<00:02:40.880> it's<00:02:41.880> a<00:02:41.970> perfect

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:42.420 
together with Metro it's a perfect

00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:53.380 
together with Metro it's a perfect
solution<00:02:42.720> to<00:02:44.030> protect<00:02:45.030> preserve<00:02:45.990> and<00:02:46.610> flock

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:53.390 

00:02:53.390 --> 00:02:56.210 

so<00:02:54.390> here's<00:02:54.690> the<00:02:54.990> chair<00:02:55.320> and<00:02:55.470> table<00:02:55.680> I<00:02:55.980> need<00:02:56.100> to

00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:56.220 
so here's the chair and table I need to

00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:57.740 
so here's the chair and table I need to
be<00:02:56.340> after<00:02:56.790> we've<00:02:56.970> covered<00:02:57.210> it<00:02:57.390> with<00:02:57.480> the<00:02:57.570> coat

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750 
be after we've covered it with the coat

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.500 
be after we've covered it with the coat
of<00:02:57.930> text<00:02:58.230> drop<00:02:58.610> that<00:02:59.610> initially<00:02:59.940> looks<00:03:00.210> quite

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510 
of text drop that initially looks quite

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:02.240 
of text drop that initially looks quite
dark<00:03:00.750> but<00:03:00.930> we<00:03:01.080> have<00:03:01.260> gone<00:03:01.500> from<00:03:01.800> a<00:03:01.950> pre
