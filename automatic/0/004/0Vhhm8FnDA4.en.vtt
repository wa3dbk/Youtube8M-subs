00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:11.660
 and these May we think 2015 is the 

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.660
 father of the fatherland 

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:28.720
 for the first time here in pénjamo how it 

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:32.270
 feel and what can the 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:36.380
 people of your show 

00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:40.600
 or I believe that the blue angels today in 

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:43.400
 day has brought a meal a little more 

00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:47.270
 different to the previous discs that a 

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:49.580
 from a disc with our I believe 

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:53.660
 that people never imagined that 

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:56.600
 aggressors were going to be a little bit of a lot 

00:00:53.660 --> 00:01:01.489
 with the new topics that now 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:03.680
 are in the time of 96 that after the 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:05.840
 98 

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:09.530
 but right now a lot of young people do not 

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:12.560
 we knew we have now are more than 30 

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:15.440
 years of career that can most 

00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:19.850
 offer blue angels and tonight what 

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:22.010
 who told him what songs are going to sing 

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:25.940
 and with that they will delight the public of 

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:28.540
 we think what we have been presenting is 

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:32.350
 material 

00:01:28.540 --> 00:01:35.030
 what we recorded the songs that 

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:39.870
 we had but to be renovated 

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:42.600
 what we recorded on the 5th album 

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:48.270
 what the new Friday disk 

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:50.850
 cultural taking of this material 

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:53.850
 he also spent his life thinking then 

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:56.240
 It is everything new that we have taken has 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:56.240
 been painting 

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:04.130
 we hope that this first time 

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:07.070
 we come to hell is the last one that 

00:02:04.130 --> 00:02:08.580
 people leave super enchanted with the 

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:10.619
 aggression 

00:02:08.580 --> 00:02:12.060
 listening to the word let's see what is it 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:14.870
 that comes to mind that they know 

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:14.870
 about this city 

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:21.180
 90 

00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:28.150
 People who like this have fun 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:32.190
 that come the blue angels and brother 

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:32.190
 here the doctor is the one who carries everything 

00:02:33.069 --> 00:02:40.060
 to sing and then 

00:02:35.210 --> 00:02:42.650
 so all the people are an audience 

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:50.570
 family 

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:55.040
 to dance and I think it's a 

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:56.810
 animation of the 83 to date because its 

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.120
 music is still using the public that 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:01.160
 represents for you is to remain current 

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:05.180
 after more than 20 years still in the 

00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:08.599
 people's taste because I think it's 

00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:10.329
 I think you should know that all 

00:03:08.599 --> 00:03:12.140
 jobs 

00:03:10.329 --> 00:03:14.450
 do you have 

00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:20.840
 that pick up the crop that you have sown 

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:22.750
 for 32 years doing since then 

00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:26.170
 the doctor that I know 

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:28.870
 so for the angels because yes 

00:03:26.170 --> 00:03:32.020
 we came to work here in these places 

00:03:28.870 --> 00:03:34.600
 but not as often and there is 

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:36.450
 people learned that there was a 

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:40.510
 cumbia his deference is something romantic 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:42.370
 that I believe that today 

00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:45.220
 I say something important is that all 

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:49.360
 all the people who do not know the music 

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:51.830
 young and already bojan to know the subject of 

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:54.280
 17 years 

00:03:51.830 --> 00:03:54.280
 and 

00:03:54.500 --> 00:04:00.710
 the theme of jimena sariñana that we 

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:03.670
 of classic contracts I think he wants 

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:06.890
 the string 37 this guitar is something 

00:04:03.670 --> 00:04:09.440
 spectacular and all that has made the 

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:11.540
 association harens have already won a 

00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:15.510
 diamond disk tailor in platinum 

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:19.079
 it's more just use over a little 

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:21.930
 foundling serve the same because 

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:23.819
 no people know that now piracy 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:25.889
 out with all the lefts and control 

00:04:23.819 --> 00:04:28.910
 of ministers who previously had at home 

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:32.200
 today we are beltrán fortunadamente 

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:32.200
 and we have already 

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:35.470
 something true 

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:46.730
 in which the batteries are put in ahead 

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:54.370
 to continue projecting all of Mexico and 

00:04:46.730 --> 00:04:54.370
 USA and Europe 

00:05:00.970 --> 00:05:06.590
 You can send a greeting to the people of 

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:09.650
 We are going to send a greeting to all 

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:12.850
 the people from the blue angels 

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:12.850
 from iztapalapa 

00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:23.419
 and these may 

00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:25.600
 we think 2015 the father wear the 

00:05:23.419 --> 00:05:25.600
 homeland
