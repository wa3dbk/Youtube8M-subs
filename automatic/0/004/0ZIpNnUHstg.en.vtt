collectibles because my Stowe has had

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:18.950 
collectibles because my Stowe has had
some<00:01:17.880> Mustangs<00:01:18.360> that<00:01:18.540> just<00:01:18.810> weren't

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:18.960 
some Mustangs that just weren't

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.249 
some Mustangs that just weren't
impressive<00:01:20.180> as<00:01:21.180> far<00:01:21.420> as<00:01:21.509> the<00:01:21.630> exterior<00:01:21.960> design

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:22.259 
impressive as far as the exterior design

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:25.340 
impressive as far as the exterior design
was<00:01:22.710> it<00:01:22.920> just<00:01:23.189> wasn't<00:01:23.549> quite<00:01:23.880> as<00:01:24.030> accurate<00:01:24.350> so

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:25.350 
was it just wasn't quite as accurate so

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.530 
was it just wasn't quite as accurate so
here<00:01:25.830> is<00:01:26.040> the<00:01:26.250> premier<00:01:26.610> edition<00:01:27.000> now<00:01:27.119> as<00:01:27.360> we

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:27.540 
here is the premier edition now as we

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.420 
here is the premier edition now as we
know<00:01:27.570> the<00:01:27.900> Premier<00:01:28.259> and<00:01:28.500> special<00:01:28.890> edition<00:01:29.220> are

00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.430 
know the Premier and special edition are

00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.219 
know the Premier and special edition are
essentially<00:01:30.000> the<00:01:30.090> exact<00:01:30.420> same<00:01:30.630> thing<00:01:30.900> so<00:01:31.140> you

00:01:31.219 --> 00:01:31.229 
essentially the exact same thing so you

00:01:31.229 --> 00:01:35.300 
essentially the exact same thing so you
can<00:01:31.350> pretty<00:01:31.500> much<00:01:31.729> wipe<00:01:32.729> that<00:01:33.119> entire<00:01:34.310> bite

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:35.310

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:39.280 
can pretty much wipe that entire bite
that<00:01:35.490> label<00:01:35.820> off<00:01:35.970> off<00:01:36.329> it<00:01:36.659> means<00:01:36.810> nothing<00:01:37.049> and

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:39.290 
that label off off it means nothing and

00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:42.230 
that label off off it means nothing and
not<00:01:40.290> too<00:01:40.619> much<00:01:40.920> different<00:01:41.460> on<00:01:41.640> this<00:01:41.939> page

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:42.240 
not too much different on this page

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:46.069

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:41.730 
police car now yeah I guess it might be

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:44.210 
police car now yeah I guess it might be
cool<00:02:42.000> but<00:02:42.390> it's<00:02:43.110> not<00:02:43.170> something<00:02:43.650> for<00:02:43.680> me<00:02:43.920> not

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:44.220 
cool but it's not something for me not

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:46.520 
cool but it's not something for me not
only<00:02:44.370> is<00:02:44.580> this<00:02:44.700> the<00:02:44.760> concept<00:02:45.420> it<00:02:46.140> doesn't<00:02:46.440> make

00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:46.530 
only is this the concept it doesn't make

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.980 
only is this the concept it doesn't make
sense<00:02:46.560> that<00:02:46.890> as<00:02:47.070> a<00:02:47.100> police<00:02:47.430> livery<00:02:47.730> on<00:02:48.000> it<00:02:48.180> but

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:48.990 
sense that as a police livery on it but

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:52.400 
sense that as a police livery on it but
hey<00:02:49.200> it's<00:02:49.650> a<00:02:49.770> it's<00:02:49.980> a<00:02:50.070> cool<00:02:50.310> car<00:02:51.320> kind<00:02:52.320> of

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:30.990 
beginning that the focusing on the

00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:36.290 
beginning that the focusing on the
Lamborghini<00:04:31.410> Aventador<00:04:31.639> which<00:04:32.639> I<00:04:34.729> I<00:04:35.729> don't

00:04:36.290 --> 00:04:36.300 
Lamborghini Aventador which I I don't

00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:38.029 
Lamborghini Aventador which I I don't
know<00:04:36.509> that<00:04:36.870> the<00:04:37.199> wheels<00:04:37.410> are<00:04:37.590> different<00:04:37.949> on

know that the wheels are different on
that<00:04:38.250> then<00:04:39.050> mine<00:04:40.460> just<00:04:41.460> zoom<00:04:41.669> in<00:04:41.880> I<00:04:43.039> think<00:04:44.039> the

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:44.310 
that then mine just zoom in I think the

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:46.430 
that then mine just zoom in I think the
change<00:04:44.550> I<00:04:44.729> think<00:04:44.940> they<00:04:45.139> they<00:04:46.139> could<00:04:46.320> have

00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:46.440 
change I think they they could have

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:47.930 
change I think they they could have
updated<00:04:46.770> this<00:04:47.009> model<00:04:47.340> to<00:04:47.460> make<00:04:47.580> it<00:04:47.729> a<00:04:47.789> little

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:47.940 
updated this model to make it a little

00:04:47.940 --> 00:04:51.350 
updated this model to make it a little

00:05:23.749 --> 00:05:23.759 
it's probably one the best-looking

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:40.740 
to throw it in the catalog but I would

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:44.210 
to throw it in the catalog but I would
still<00:05:40.979> be<00:05:41.789> hesitant<00:05:42.330> to<00:05:42.449> buy<00:05:42.690> it<00:05:42.750> from<00:05:43.289> Barako

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:44.220 
still be hesitant to buy it from Barako

00:05:44.220 --> 00:05:48.080 
still be hesitant to buy it from Barako
just<00:05:44.610> for<00:05:44.880> the<00:05:44.970> reasons<00:05:45.419> that<00:05:46.400> the<00:05:47.400> quality<00:05:48.000> of

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:48.090 
just for the reasons that the quality of

00:05:55.879 --> 00:05:55.889 
disappointing the Fiat 500 was pretty

00:05:55.889 --> 00:05:59.870 
disappointing the Fiat 500 was pretty
good<00:05:56.190> it<00:05:57.030> wasn't<00:05:57.389> the<00:05:57.510> best<00:05:57.889> the<00:05:58.889> TT<00:05:59.220> RS<00:05:59.610> that's

00:05:59.870 --> 00:05:59.880

00:06:04.219 --> 00:06:04.229 
also pretty good it's not up to my stove

00:06:04.229 --> 00:06:06.589 
also pretty good it's not up to my stove
level<00:06:04.919> though<00:06:05.099> and<00:06:05.130> my<00:06:06.030> stowe<00:06:06.270> isn't

00:06:06.589 --> 00:06:06.599 
level though and my stowe isn't

00:06:06.599 --> 00:06:08.089

00:06:11.180 --> 00:06:11.190 
budget cars anyway so they hoped that I
