different times so people in the UK this

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:55.340 
different times so people in the UK this
is<00:00:53.610> actually<00:00:53.910> 3:00<00:00:54.180> a.m.<00:00:54.270> and<00:00:54.719> obviously

00:00:59.569 --> 00:00:59.579 
depending on different time zones so

00:00:59.579 --> 00:01:01.130
