when we put in Sparky's little name on
it<00:01:16.650> I<00:01:16.860> think<00:01:17.340> that<00:01:17.490> could<00:01:17.640> possibly<00:01:18.090> make<00:01:18.270> a

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.080 
it I think that could possibly make a
fun<00:01:18.720> little<00:01:18.869> video<00:01:19.110> and<00:01:19.549> that's<00:01:20.549> a<00:01:20.700> fun<00:01:20.880> thing

fun little video and that's a fun thing

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.390 
fun little video and that's a fun thing
about<00:01:21.119> this<00:01:21.420> product<00:01:21.869> and<00:01:22.140> as<00:01:22.920> kind<00:01:23.220> of<00:01:23.280> an

came<00:01:28.890> in<00:01:29.009> parts<00:01:29.369> to<00:01:29.549> be<00:01:29.670> assembled<00:01:29.970> it<00:01:30.390> was

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:30.960 
came in parts to be assembled it was

00:01:30.960 --> 00:01:33.530 
came in parts to be assembled it was
very<00:01:31.320> easy<00:01:31.409> to<00:01:31.829> assemble<00:01:32.100> their<00:01:32.880> wear<00:01:33.180> holes

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:33.540 
very easy to assemble their wear holes

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.050 
very easy to assemble their wear holes
and<00:01:33.930> protruding<00:01:34.740> parts<00:01:35.159> which<00:01:35.700> could<00:01:35.939> be

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060 
and protruding parts which could be

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:39.109 
and protruding parts which could be
connected<00:01:36.750> together<00:01:37.159> it<00:01:38.159> did<00:01:38.400> not<00:01:38.430> need<00:01:38.909> to<00:01:38.970> be

00:01:39.109 --> 00:01:39.119 
connected together it did not need to be

00:01:39.119 --> 00:01:41.030 
connected together it did not need to be
secured<00:01:39.720> with<00:01:39.750> glue<00:01:40.229> which<00:01:40.500> I<00:01:40.650> thought<00:01:40.829> was

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:41.040 
secured with glue which I thought was

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:43.639 
secured with glue which I thought was
great<00:01:41.430> because<00:01:41.820> you<00:01:42.630> know<00:01:42.750> you'd<00:01:43.110> have<00:01:43.290> to<00:01:43.500> buy

00:01:43.639 --> 00:01:43.649 
great because you know you'd have to buy

00:01:43.649 --> 00:01:46.460 
great because you know you'd have to buy
pay<00:01:44.040> it<00:01:44.100> safe<00:01:44.369> glue<00:01:44.640> and<00:01:44.909> that<00:01:45.600> could<00:01:45.899> possibly

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:46.470 
pay it safe glue and that could possibly

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.649 
pay it safe glue and that could possibly
be<00:01:46.590> harder<00:01:47.100> to<00:01:47.130> find<00:01:47.460> and<00:01:47.790> more<00:01:48.030> expensive

00:01:48.649 --> 00:01:48.659 
be harder to find and more expensive

00:01:48.659 --> 00:01:51.440 
be harder to find and more expensive
than<00:01:48.840> regular<00:01:48.899> stuff<00:01:49.530> so<00:01:50.280> it<00:01:50.640> is<00:01:50.759> very<00:01:51.000> easy<00:01:51.149> to

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:51.450 
than regular stuff so it is very easy to

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:53.240 
than regular stuff so it is very easy to
assemble<00:01:51.810> you<00:01:52.140> don't<00:01:52.290> need<00:01:52.409> any<00:01:52.619> skills<00:01:53.009> and

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:53.250 
assemble you don't need any skills and

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.209 
assemble you don't need any skills and
anyone<00:01:53.759> could<00:01:53.939> put<00:01:54.210> it<00:01:54.299> together<00:01:54.770> it<00:01:55.770> can<00:01:56.070> be

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219 
anyone could put it together it can be

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.280 
anyone could put it together it can be
put<00:01:56.430> together<00:01:56.549> and<00:01:57.060> a<00:01:57.329> couple<00:01:57.600> of<00:01:57.869> different

something I did notice is that on the

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:33.480 
something I did notice is that on the
ramp<00:02:30.820> sites<00:02:31.300> there<00:02:31.750> are<00:02:31.930> indents<00:02:32.620> for<00:02:32.980> making

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:33.490 
ramp sites there are indents for making

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:36.600 
ramp sites there are indents for making
claiming<00:02:34.090> easier<00:02:34.480> on<00:02:34.750> one<00:02:35.020> of<00:02:35.260> the<00:02:35.500> ramps<00:02:35.920> but

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:36.610 
claiming easier on one of the ramps but

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:38.760 
claiming easier on one of the ramps but
it's<00:02:36.880> completely<00:02:37.150> smooth<00:02:37.750> on<00:02:38.020> the<00:02:38.140> other<00:02:38.290> so

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:38.770 
it's completely smooth on the other so

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:40.440 
it's completely smooth on the other so
it's<00:02:39.370> a<00:02:39.400> little<00:02:39.580> bit<00:02:39.700> more<00:02:39.910> difficult<00:02:40.090> to

00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:40.450 
it's a little bit more difficult to

00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:43.440 
it's a little bit more difficult to
clean<00:02:40.750> up<00:02:41.140> that<00:02:41.650> part<00:02:42.070> but<00:02:42.400> Sparkie<00:02:43.030> is<00:02:43.120> a<00:02:43.209> tiny

in the frame for a comparison in terms
of<00:03:31.120> size<00:03:31.950> but<00:03:32.950> all<00:03:33.040> hamsters<00:03:33.579> like<00:03:33.670> to<00:03:33.970> squeeze

of size but all hamsters like to squeeze

00:03:34.269 --> 00:03:36.060 
of size but all hamsters like to squeeze
through<00:03:34.480> small<00:03:34.870> species<00:03:35.200> so<00:03:35.650> it<00:03:35.860> could<00:03:36.040> be

00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:36.070 
through small species so it could be

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:39.000

enjoys it the price was five pounds from
pets<00:04:05.140> at<00:04:05.290> home<00:04:05.320> I<00:04:05.910> think<00:04:06.910> it<00:04:07.060> could<00:04:07.209> have<00:04:07.360> maybe

00:04:07.530 --> 00:04:07.540 
pets at home I think it could have maybe

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:10.319 
pets at home I think it could have maybe
been<00:04:07.660> four<00:04:08.079> pounds<00:04:08.560> and<00:04:08.769> it's<00:04:09.459> not<00:04:09.730> a<00:04:09.760> huge

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:10.329 
been four pounds and it's not a huge

00:04:10.329 --> 00:04:13.740 
been four pounds and it's not a huge
product<00:04:11.520> but<00:04:12.520> you<00:04:12.790> know<00:04:12.879> what<00:04:13.060> as<00:04:13.360> a<00:04:13.390> really

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:13.750 
product but you know what as a really

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:15.809 
product but you know what as a really
nice<00:04:13.930> toy<00:04:14.230> so<00:04:14.620> I<00:04:14.650> think<00:04:14.830> it's<00:04:15.129> worth<00:04:15.370> the<00:04:15.580> five

00:04:15.809 --> 00:04:15.819 
nice toy so I think it's worth the five

00:04:15.819 --> 00:04:16.580 
nice toy so I think it's worth the five
pounds

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:16.590 
pounds

00:04:16.590 --> 00:04:19.729 
pounds
and<00:04:16.709> it's<00:04:17.480> annoying<00:04:18.480> thing<00:04:18.930> that<00:04:19.139> pet<00:04:19.380> stores

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:19.739 
and it's annoying thing that pet stores

00:04:19.739 --> 00:04:21.860 
and it's annoying thing that pet stores
are<00:04:20.070> usually<00:04:20.699> a<00:04:20.730> little<00:04:20.790> bit<00:04:21.150> expensive<00:04:21.510> you

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:21.870 
are usually a little bit expensive you

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:24.610 
are usually a little bit expensive you
can<00:04:22.019> find<00:04:22.290> things<00:04:22.590> cheaper<00:04:23.040> online<00:04:23.190> usually

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:24.620 
can find things cheaper online usually

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:27.830 
can find things cheaper online usually
but<00:04:25.620> that's<00:04:25.979> the<00:04:26.130> price<00:04:26.250> you<00:04:26.370> pay<00:04:26.550> I<00:04:26.940> think<00:04:27.600> it

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:27.840 
but that's the price you pay I think it

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:30.080 
but that's the price you pay I think it
could<00:04:27.990> have<00:04:28.110> been<00:04:28.169> a<00:04:28.229> bit<00:04:28.380> cheaper<00:04:28.710> but<00:04:29.160> it's<00:04:29.910> a

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:30.090 
could have been a bit cheaper but it's a

00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:32.450 
could have been a bit cheaper but it's a
great<00:04:30.330> product<00:04:30.570> so<00:04:31.020> if<00:04:31.290> I<00:04:31.710> were<00:04:31.860> to<00:04:31.919> go<00:04:32.130> back<00:04:32.310> in

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:32.460
