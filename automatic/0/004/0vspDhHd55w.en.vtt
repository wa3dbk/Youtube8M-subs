 hello friends what else are we going again good 

00:00:02.879 --> 00:00:07.080
 as I had told you before when I 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:09.059
 itself was the 41st I was going to bring him a 

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:10.769
 video and good we are here I'm going to 

00:00:09.059 --> 00:00:13.710
 present a duel game per team and 

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:17.090
 showdown and let's see that finally I already 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:20.010
 took the m4a1 4 carbayín as we should 

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:24.740
 analyze so that you realize 

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:24.740
 what is it 

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.269
 this magician when I played this game 

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:31.550
 I did not know him then what 

00:00:29.269 --> 00:00:32.840
 What I want to tell you 

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:34.460
 you when I do not know a map is 

00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.350
 just go around the 

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:37.280
 map go around what is said on 

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:38.600
 perimeter 

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:40.550
 you see here that I'm going around the 

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.739
 perimeter to not get into the fire 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:44.989
 hot that in the work will be in the 

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:46.760
 middle of the map that is really from the 

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:48.589
 orderly return of the other book is given 

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.570
 the return also I do not find anything 

00:00:48.589 --> 00:00:53.180
 now if I'm heading towards the middle of 

00:00:50.570 --> 00:00:57.820
 map meeting caution obviously because 

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:57.820
 I do not have one of my third 

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:05.090
 this is an automatic weapon that does not have 

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:07.090
 too much to pick up 

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:09.399
 two 

00:01:07.090 --> 00:01:12.479
 reloads in really fast you 

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:12.479
 we present g1 

00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:19.899
 there are two people here 

00:01:20.810 --> 00:01:28.719
 because we will be attentive to see 

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:28.719
 Y 

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.829
 and I see that there are people 

00:01:34.549 --> 00:01:39.149
 I see that there are people on top of the mambo 

00:01:37.079 --> 00:01:42.860
 but I do not know how to go up is going to 

00:01:39.149 --> 00:01:42.860
 place a way to get there 

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:51.270
 that looking to see if I get the 

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:52.980
 fifth killed and progress of the truth already 

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.460
 we go 

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:57.930
 I'm running out of it and it slips away 

00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:00.090
 I remain we continue with this weapon either 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:03.490
 I have Basque the dragon we go what 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:07.599
 he has turned around we are going 

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:10.780
 With the support 

00:02:07.599 --> 00:02:16.099
 4 again 

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:18.349
 to have more bullets we already know that 

00:02:16.099 --> 00:02:20.480
 called bandit like word war that 

00:02:18.349 --> 00:02:23.190
 lets you have 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:25.080
 an excellent amount valls 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.640
 I always run out forever 

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:28.680
 two cartridges without estimating let's see 

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:31.200
 now count paras I have 60 bullets 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:33.660
 and the cartridge of 30 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:36.930
 I do not have 60 bullets I already have two cartridges 

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:38.760
 nothing else let's see if I have I know we're going to 

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:41.360
 see to confirm if I have 60 bars 

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:41.360
 exactly 

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.730
 already charge and now there are 40 no 

00:02:43.420 --> 00:02:50.400
 exactly one goes out with provoke many 

00:02:45.730 --> 00:02:53.400
 Toads officially indicates the salt egg 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:55.590
 It is very important to apply or not have a 

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:58.409
 park to forget a lot for more already 

00:02:55.590 --> 00:03:02.129
 that very little for the 60 with which 

00:02:58.409 --> 00:03:04.980
 pieces and I finished and there is a good 

00:03:02.129 --> 00:03:07.730
 changing that I do not know what it does not kill me 

00:03:04.980 --> 00:03:07.730
 I do not know what I was thinking 

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:12.370
 they are always hearing me weapons 

00:03:12.849 --> 00:03:17.150
 generally all of all the 

00:03:15.439 --> 00:03:20.720
 eggs 

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:23.769
 with escalator jr with everything that allows 

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:23.769
 have the barça 

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:30.120
 two 

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:45.060
 d 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:46.730
 what I was seeing is that in this 

00:03:45.060 --> 00:03:49.860
 game is usually one of the games 

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:52.820
 where more shootings are used are the 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:52.820
 maps are small 

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:56.530
 forever 

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:05.030
 exceptional the fabulous world 

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:06.050
 the only bad thing about this website that has the 

00:04:05.030 --> 00:04:08.060
 20 and take 

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:09.010
 the one that just kill you can let go 

00:04:08.060 --> 00:04:11.580
 a grenade 

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:11.580
 Yes always 

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:25.760
 on the internet as is 

00:04:19.190 --> 00:04:28.300
 the ex voto take a car costs 50 hours 

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:28.300
 a year but 

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:33.570
 that package to play the games 

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:40.990
 to send us a little bit about the 

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:42.310
 main issue that the m4 carmen that 

00:04:40.990 --> 00:04:44.580
 we are using that comes out here in 

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:44.580
 level 

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:53.270
 67 and with which it appeared that the m4 of 

00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:56.810
 weapons for anxiety in the game with 

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:59.060
 that the 16 and for three bullets per 

00:04:56.810 --> 00:05:01.070
 three in three if you manage to have a good 

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:03.430
 Aiming appointment between them can make 

00:05:01.070 --> 00:05:03.430
 state 

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:10.860
 very outside and here is something a bit 

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:10.860
 for home where Europe wrong 

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:14.900
 he comes to look for him from the country 

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:18.110
 but they killed 

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:37.230
 to see if perhaps they see that 

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:39.000
 generally we always achieve 

00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:41.850
 and good to finish the game I hope that 

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:44.730
