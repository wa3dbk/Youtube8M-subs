00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:10.549
 we present the universal charger equal 15 99 

00:00:14.369 --> 00:00:19.029
 Thanks to its adjustable contacts you can charge most of the 

00:00:19.029 --> 00:00:24.610
 Lithium batteries from 3com to six 3com to seven and seven comma 2 volts 

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:29.079
 for it 

00:00:29.079 --> 00:00:31.940
 place the battery in the charger 

00:00:31.940 --> 00:00:37.730
 adjust the contacts and make sure they are facing the positive pole and 

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:40.730
 negative battery 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.050
 check the television sense 

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:54.450
 this confirms that the charger has already identified the polarity and type of 

00:00:54.450 --> 00:00:57.450
 battery that we have put and is ready to charge it 

00:01:00.540 --> 00:01:01.670
 next 

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:04.049
 using the supplied feeder 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:07.049
 with we will be the charger to reflection 

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:13.360
 the network lights and charge blinking hunger of mind and finally it 

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:16.360
 will be lit indicating that the battery is charging 

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:22.190
 grassland batteries 

00:01:22.190 --> 00:01:25.190
 its charging terminals on the bottom 

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:27.050
 in this case 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:29.759
 we must turn the contacts of the iguazÃº 

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:33.130
 so that they point up 

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:35.780
 a for 

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:38.780
 Japan 

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:45.180
 one 

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.180
 pamplona 

00:01:54.620 --> 00:01:56.150
 as in the previous example 

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:58.570
 once the network light and it has lit 

00:01:58.570 --> 00:02:01.570
 we can connect equality at the same time electric 

00:02:12.859 --> 00:02:17.399
 this Lynx 99 can also serve as an emergency charger 

00:02:18.009 --> 00:02:22.749
 imagine that we have our cell phone downloaded and that we need to make a 

00:02:22.749 --> 00:02:24.289
 urgent call 

00:02:24.289 --> 00:02:27.289
 with Lynx 99 this is not a problem 

00:02:28.319 --> 00:02:33.299
 using the battery of any other electronic equipment we can recharge 

00:02:33.299 --> 00:02:34.959
 our mobile 

00:02:34.959 --> 00:02:40.670
 for this we place the battery in the equal and we will have 5 volts in its output 

00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:42.149
 what you see 

00:02:42.149 --> 00:02:46.569
 now we only need to connect the phone to this output and we will be 

00:02:46.569 --> 00:02:49.569
 recharging 

00:02:59.839 --> 00:03:02.909
 in the same way we can use three alkaline batteries 

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:06.579
 or three rechargeable batteries using the laptop thus included 

00:03:19.799 --> 00:03:21.089
 percent 

00:03:21.089 --> 00:03:22.360
 do not increase 

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:24.749
 we will place the battery holder in the same 

00:03:24.749 --> 00:03:28.359
 and we will have you again 5 volts in your output or sb 

00:03:33.589 --> 00:03:34.530
 same 

00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:36.249
 15 99 

00:03:36.249 --> 00:03:40.619
 a state-of-the-art universal charger for lithium batteries
