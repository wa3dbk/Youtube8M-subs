00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.010 
claim Kay had the pmn unit and we prior

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.580 
claim Kay had the pmn unit and we prior
to<00:00:29.220> that<00:00:29.400> this<00:00:29.580> would<00:00:29.730> have<00:00:29.850> been<00:00:30.529> eight<00:00:31.529> years

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:31.590 
to that this would have been eight years

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:33.980 
to that this would have been eight years
ago<00:00:32.070> probably<00:00:32.310> seven<00:00:33.000> eight<00:00:33.120> years<00:00:33.270> ago<00:00:33.360> and

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:33.990

normally because we're fitting quite a
lot<00:00:45.360> of<00:00:45.420> the<00:00:45.480> pure<00:00:45.690> minis<00:00:46.050> in<00:00:46.320> particular

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890 
lot of the pure minis in particular

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.190 
lot of the pure minis in particular
we'll<00:00:47.820> try<00:00:48.000> and<00:00:48.120> have<00:00:48.240> one<00:00:48.420> in<00:00:48.570> it<00:00:48.750> that<00:00:48.960> you

00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:49.200

or at least be in the same room and see

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.140 
or at least be in the same room and see
the<00:01:07.560> bloke<00:01:07.770> is<00:01:07.979> playing<00:01:08.250> it<00:01:08.490> actually<00:01:08.909> playing

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:09.150 
the bloke is playing it actually playing

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:11.450 
the bloke is playing it actually playing
it<00:01:09.360> is<00:01:09.750> a<00:01:09.930> nice<00:01:10.170> that<00:01:10.439> is<00:01:10.619> a<00:01:10.650> nice<00:01:10.920> thing<00:01:11.220> you

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:11.460 
it is a nice that is a nice thing you

00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:16.160 
it is a nice that is a nice thing you
know<00:01:13.130> manufacturers<00:01:14.130> will<00:01:14.850> always<00:01:15.119> make<00:01:15.450> be

00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:16.170 
know manufacturers will always make be

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:18.440 
know manufacturers will always make be
trying<00:01:16.500> to<00:01:16.619> make<00:01:16.829> new<00:01:17.130> products<00:01:17.610> putting<00:01:18.420> a

00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:18.450 
trying to make new products putting a

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:21.290 
trying to make new products putting a
new<00:01:18.659> spin<00:01:18.690> on<00:01:19.020> things<00:01:19.380> but<00:01:19.650> I<00:01:19.860> think<00:01:20.190> if<00:01:20.850> you

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:21.300 
new spin on things but I think if you

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:25.310 
new spin on things but I think if you
look<00:01:21.480> at<00:01:21.740> all<00:01:22.740> the<00:01:23.040> iconic<00:01:24.140> instruments<00:01:25.140> and

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320 
look at all the iconic instruments and

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:27.800 
look at all the iconic instruments and
amplifiers<00:01:26.220> in<00:01:26.580> in<00:01:26.909> the<00:01:27.120> business<00:01:27.510> really

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:27.810 
amplifiers in in the business really

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.850 
amplifiers in in the business really
they<00:01:28.260> all<00:01:28.640> they<00:01:29.640> all<00:01:29.670> go<00:01:30.420> back<00:01:30.630> a<00:01:30.659> long<00:01:30.930> way<00:01:31.170> to

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:31.860 
they all they all go back a long way to

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:33.680 
they all they all go back a long way to
simple<00:01:32.250> ideas<00:01:32.700> that<00:01:32.970> were<00:01:33.060> right<00:01:33.300> from<00:01:33.570> the

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:33.690 
simple ideas that were right from the

00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:36.740 
simple ideas that were right from the
start<00:01:33.900> you<00:01:34.320> know<00:01:34.500> and<00:01:35.310> I<00:01:35.430> think<00:01:35.490> the<00:01:36.270> K<00:01:36.450> NK<00:01:36.600> is

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:36.750 
start you know and I think the K NK is

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:41.300 
start you know and I think the K NK is
is<00:01:37.200> one<00:01:37.470> of<00:01:37.620> those<00:01:37.740> you<00:01:38.040> know<00:01:38.130> there's<00:01:40.310> there's

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:41.310 
is one of those you know there's there's

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:45.440 
is one of those you know there's there's
another<00:01:41.430> a<00:01:42.060> few<00:01:42.690> other<00:01:43.460> items<00:01:44.460> in<00:01:44.970> there<00:01:45.150> and

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:45.450 
another a few other items in there and

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.450 
another a few other items in there and
the<00:01:45.570> acoustic<00:01:46.049> amplification<00:01:46.680> market<00:01:47.370> you

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:47.460 
the acoustic amplification market you

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.250 
the acoustic amplification market you
say<00:01:47.700> the<00:01:47.820> same<00:01:48.000> thing<00:01:48.210> about<00:01:48.299> me<00:01:48.630> in<00:01:48.720> terms<00:01:48.990> of

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:49.260 
say the same thing about me in terms of

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:51.560 
say the same thing about me in terms of
being<00:01:49.500> something<00:01:50.460> that<00:01:50.610> sounds<00:01:51.060> really<00:01:51.420> like

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:51.570 
being something that sounds really like

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.180 
being something that sounds really like
the<00:01:51.750> guitar<00:01:51.870> is<00:01:52.200> very<00:01:52.500> simple<00:01:52.890> and<00:01:53.010> easy

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:53.190 
the guitar is very simple and easy

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:55.039 
the guitar is very simple and easy
passive<00:01:53.700> it<00:01:53.790> I<00:01:53.850> think<00:01:54.060> it's<00:01:54.240> it's<00:01:54.690> the<00:01:54.870> best

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.049 
passive it I think it's it's the best

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:58.930 
passive it I think it's it's the best
one<00:01:56.690> okay<00:01:57.690> like<00:01:57.900> I<00:01:57.930> mean<00:01:58.110> if<00:01:58.200> you<00:01:58.290> want<00:01:58.440> to<00:01:58.500> just

00:01:58.930 --> 00:01:58.940 
one okay like I mean if you want to just

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:01.880 
one okay like I mean if you want to just
try<00:01:59.940> the<00:02:00.000> trailer<00:02:00.810> Martin<00:02:01.170> through<00:02:01.380> this<00:02:01.500> they

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:01.890 
try the trailer Martin through this they

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.039 
try the trailer Martin through this they
are<00:02:02.220> which<00:02:02.610> is<00:02:02.820> essentially<00:02:03.479> you<00:02:03.960> know

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049 
are which is essentially you know

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:08.330 
are which is essentially you know
acoustic<00:02:04.850> Ambe<00:02:05.850> BPA<00:02:06.210> and<00:02:07.069> just<00:02:08.069> see<00:02:08.190> what

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:08.340 
acoustic Ambe BPA and just see what

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:10.249 
acoustic Ambe BPA and just see what
pickup<00:02:08.640> sounds<00:02:08.940> like<00:02:09.090> straight<00:02:09.390> in<00:02:09.539> the<00:02:10.019> flat

00:02:10.249 --> 00:02:10.259 
pickup sounds like straight in the flat

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:32.650 
pickup sounds like straight in the flat
response<00:02:10.649> on<00:02:10.830> the<00:02:10.920> end

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:32.660 

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:36.110 

okay<00:02:33.660> go<00:02:34.200> Nath's<00:02:34.890> how<00:02:35.460> do<00:02:35.610> we<00:02:35.760> think<00:02:35.820> that

00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:36.120 
okay go Nath's how do we think that

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:38.030 
okay go Nath's how do we think that
compares<00:02:36.540> to<00:02:36.630> just<00:02:37.140> the<00:02:37.290> acoustic<00:02:37.680> sound<00:02:37.860> of

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:38.040 
compares to just the acoustic sound of

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:50.450 
compares to just the acoustic sound of
the<00:02:38.100> guitar<00:02:38.190> if<00:02:38.580> we<00:02:48.470> good<00:02:49.470> yeah<00:02:50.190> we're<00:02:50.310> going

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:50.460 
the guitar if we good yeah we're going

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:52.340 
the guitar if we good yeah we're going
