we<00:01:25.899> have<00:01:26.020> vision<00:01:26.320> implants<00:01:26.890> so<00:01:27.250> we<00:01:27.700> can

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:27.909 
we have vision implants so we can

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:30.120 
we have vision implants so we can
actually<00:01:28.090> give<00:01:28.420> some<00:01:28.450> basic<00:01:29.110> vision<00:01:29.619> back<00:01:29.979> to

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:30.130 
actually give some basic vision back to
