00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:05.030 

the<00:00:03.990> thing<00:00:04.170> that<00:00:04.290> I'm<00:00:04.500> excited<00:00:04.830> about

00:00:05.030 --> 00:00:05.040 
the thing that I'm excited about

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:07.460 
the thing that I'm excited about
programmatic<00:00:05.549> is<00:00:05.940> kind<00:00:06.390> of<00:00:06.480> really<00:00:06.690> basic

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:07.470 
programmatic is kind of really basic

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.799 
programmatic is kind of really basic
which<00:00:07.950> is<00:00:08.189> if<00:00:08.790> you<00:00:08.910> can<00:00:09.000> target<00:00:09.179> right<00:00:09.450> person

00:00:09.799 --> 00:00:09.809 
which is if you can target right person

00:00:09.809 --> 00:00:12.530 
which is if you can target right person
right<00:00:09.960> time<00:00:10.200> right<00:00:10.830> message<00:00:11.330> it's<00:00:12.330> the

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540 
right time right message it's the

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:13.970 
right time right message it's the
message<00:00:12.780> bit<00:00:13.080> that<00:00:13.380> I<00:00:13.410> don't<00:00:13.740> necessarily

00:00:13.970 --> 00:00:13.980 
message bit that I don't necessarily

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:17.269 
message bit that I don't necessarily
agree<00:00:14.519> is<00:00:14.820> right<00:00:15.509> yet<00:00:15.780> the<00:00:16.410> right<00:00:16.590> time<00:00:16.830> right

00:00:17.269 --> 00:00:17.279 
agree is right yet the right time right

00:00:17.279 --> 00:00:20.150 
agree is right yet the right time right
place<00:00:17.660> right<00:00:18.660> format<00:00:19.140> right<00:00:19.650> message<00:00:19.949> down<00:00:20.130> a

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:20.160 
place right format right message down a

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.070 
place right format right message down a
message<00:00:20.520> bit<00:00:20.730> so<00:00:21.330> where<00:00:21.480> I<00:00:21.510> think<00:00:21.810> it's<00:00:21.930> going

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080 
message bit so where I think it's going

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.390 
message bit so where I think it's going
to<00:00:22.140> develop<00:00:22.529> is<00:00:22.710> the<00:00:22.859> ability<00:00:23.160> for

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400 
to develop is the ability for

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.580 
to develop is the ability for
programmatic<00:00:24.000> to<00:00:24.359> enable<00:00:24.750> better<00:00:24.930> creativity

00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:25.590 
programmatic to enable better creativity

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:27.529 
programmatic to enable better creativity
because<00:00:26.400> at<00:00:26.730> the<00:00:26.789> end<00:00:26.820> of<00:00:26.939> the<00:00:27.029> day<00:00:27.119> if<00:00:27.359> I'm<00:00:27.510> a

00:00:27.529 --> 00:00:27.539 
because at the end of the day if I'm a

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.960 
because at the end of the day if I'm a
creative<00:00:27.900> and<00:00:28.230> I<00:00:28.439> pre<00:00:29.369> can<00:00:29.609> a<00:00:29.640> bunch<00:00:29.880> of

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:29.970 
creative and I pre can a bunch of

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:31.370 
creative and I pre can a bunch of
creative<00:00:30.330> and<00:00:30.570> it<00:00:30.689> doesn't<00:00:30.900> work<00:00:31.050> well<00:00:31.289> then

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:31.380 
creative and it doesn't work well then

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:32.299 
creative and it doesn't work well then
you've<00:00:31.470> got<00:00:31.590> to<00:00:31.619> try<00:00:31.800> and<00:00:31.949> change<00:00:32.189> in

00:00:32.299 --> 00:00:32.309 
you've got to try and change in

00:00:32.309 --> 00:00:35.060 
you've got to try and change in
mid-flight<00:00:32.610> okay<00:00:33.120> get<00:00:33.420> that<00:00:33.710> but<00:00:34.710> if<00:00:34.800> I<00:00:34.890> have

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:35.070 
mid-flight okay get that but if I have

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.680 
mid-flight okay get that but if I have
the<00:00:35.160> ability<00:00:35.579> for<00:00:35.760> somebody<00:00:36.120> who's<00:00:36.239> literally

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:36.690 
the ability for somebody who's literally

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:38.299 
the ability for somebody who's literally
engaging<00:00:37.020> in<00:00:37.260> a<00:00:37.320> creative<00:00:37.440> and<00:00:37.800> it<00:00:37.860> doesn't

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 
engaging in a creative and it doesn't

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.910 
engaging in a creative and it doesn't
actually<00:00:38.640> engage<00:00:39.270> then<00:00:40.170> what<00:00:40.350> if<00:00:40.440> I'm<00:00:40.559> able<00:00:40.710> to

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:40.920 
actually engage then what if I'm able to

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:43.069 
actually engage then what if I'm able to
do<00:00:41.040> that<00:00:41.219> dynamically<00:00:41.850> and<00:00:42.149> that's<00:00:42.809> where<00:00:43.050> I

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
do that dynamically and that's where I

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:44.600 
do that dynamically and that's where I
think<00:00:43.379> the<00:00:43.440> new<00:00:43.620> creators<00:00:43.950> can<00:00:44.160> actually<00:00:44.460> go

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:44.610 
think the new creators can actually go

00:00:44.610 --> 00:00:46.310 
think the new creators can actually go
and<00:00:44.879> programmatic<00:00:45.390> allows<00:00:45.660> it<00:00:45.840> to<00:00:45.870> happen<00:00:45.930> and

00:00:46.310 --> 00:00:46.320 
and programmatic allows it to happen and

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.950 
and programmatic allows it to happen and
also<00:00:46.649> enables<00:00:47.190> this<00:00:47.520> pub<00:00:47.850> I<00:00:48.180> don't<00:00:48.780> have<00:00:48.870> to

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:48.960 
also enables this pub I don't have to

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:50.209 
also enables this pub I don't have to
sit<00:00:49.079> in<00:00:49.140> front<00:00:49.260> of<00:00:49.379> a<00:00:49.469> spiritually<00:00:49.829> assume<00:00:50.100> my

00:00:50.209 --> 00:00:50.219 
sit in front of a spiritually assume my

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.069 
sit in front of a spiritually assume my
stuff<00:00:50.460> is<00:00:50.579> performing<00:00:51.030> well<00:00:51.059> I<00:00:51.390> can<00:00:51.960> actually

00:00:52.069 --> 00:00:52.079 
stuff is performing well I can actually

00:00:52.079 --> 00:00:53.660 
stuff is performing well I can actually
sit<00:00:52.379> back<00:00:52.530> and<00:00:52.649> I<00:00:52.829> go<00:00:52.980> to<00:00:53.010> programmatic<00:00:53.550> set

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:53.670 
sit back and I go to programmatic set

00:00:53.670 --> 00:00:55.459 
sit back and I go to programmatic set
itself<00:00:53.910> feel<00:00:54.149> that<00:00:54.329> and<00:00:54.449> that's<00:00:54.570> amazing<00:00:55.079> how

00:00:55.459 --> 00:00:55.469 
itself feel that and that's amazing how

00:00:55.469 --> 00:00:56.479 
itself feel that and that's amazing how
do<00:00:55.530> I<00:00:55.620> get<00:00:55.739> on<00:00:55.860> with<00:00:55.980> doing<00:00:56.010> other<00:00:56.399> stuff

00:00:56.479 --> 00:00:56.489 
do I get on with doing other stuff

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.490 
do I get on with doing other stuff
that's<00:00:56.850> highly<00:00:57.390> engaging<00:00:57.690> for<00:00:57.899> consumers<00:00:58.320> so

00:00:58.490 --> 00:00:58.500 
that's highly engaging for consumers so

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:59.720 
that's highly engaging for consumers so
programmatic<00:00:58.980> sand<00:00:59.160> it<00:00:59.219> naked<00:00:59.370> better

00:00:59.720 --> 00:00:59.730 
programmatic sand it naked better

00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:02.479 
programmatic sand it naked better
creative<00:01:00.090> I<00:01:00.329> also<00:01:01.050> think<00:01:01.260> the<00:01:01.469> platform<00:01:02.160> for

00:01:02.479 --> 00:01:02.489 
creative I also think the platform for

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:04.310 
creative I also think the platform for
programmatic<00:01:03.120> has<00:01:03.539> to<00:01:03.690> become<00:01:03.930> more<00:01:04.110> creative

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320 
programmatic has to become more creative

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.530 
programmatic has to become more creative
otherwise<00:01:04.739> it's<00:01:05.010> going<00:01:05.189> to<00:01:05.309> be<00:01:05.430> you<00:01:06.210> know<00:01:06.330> just

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:06.540 
otherwise it's going to be you know just

00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:08.929 
otherwise it's going to be you know just
about<00:01:06.630> so<00:01:07.080> efficiency<00:01:08.040> and<00:01:08.250> admire<00:01:08.610> and

00:01:08.929 --> 00:01:08.939 
about so efficiency and admire and

00:01:08.939 --> 00:01:10.520 
about so efficiency and admire and
that's<00:01:09.180> pretty<00:01:09.659> unsexy<00:01:10.200> but<00:01:10.350> where<00:01:10.470> it

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:10.530 
that's pretty unsexy but where it

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:11.899 
that's pretty unsexy but where it
becomes<00:01:10.680> really<00:01:10.920> interesting<00:01:11.369> in<00:01:11.460> my<00:01:11.490> mind<00:01:11.790> is

00:01:11.899 --> 00:01:11.909 
becomes really interesting in my mind is

00:01:11.909 --> 00:01:12.980 
becomes really interesting in my mind is
it<00:01:12.030> what<00:01:12.150> is<00:01:12.210> it<00:01:12.240> what<00:01:12.540> does<00:01:12.689> it<00:01:12.750> do<00:01:12.869> to<00:01:12.900> the

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:12.990 
it what is it what does it do to the

00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:14.630 
it what is it what does it do to the
creative<00:01:13.290> community<00:01:13.439> what<00:01:14.340> does<00:01:14.430> it<00:01:14.490> do<00:01:14.610> to

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640 
creative community what does it do to

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.429 
creative community what does it do to
their<00:01:14.850> toolset<00:01:15.390> that<00:01:15.420> allows<00:01:15.750> them<00:01:15.780> to<00:01:15.930> extend

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439 
their toolset that allows them to extend

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:17.840 
their toolset that allows them to extend
their<00:01:16.890> thinking<00:01:17.220> because<00:01:17.490> they<00:01:17.610> don't<00:01:17.790> have

00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:17.850 
their thinking because they don't have

00:01:17.850 --> 00:01:20.359 
their thinking because they don't have
to<00:01:18.119> necessarily<00:01:18.600> worry<00:01:19.170> about<00:01:19.380> that<00:01:19.530> but<00:01:20.280> it

00:01:20.359 --> 00:01:20.369 
to necessarily worry about that but it

00:01:20.369 --> 00:01:21.679 
to necessarily worry about that but it
means<00:01:20.520> i<00:01:20.700> can<00:01:20.850> go<00:01:20.939> and<00:01:21.090> focus<00:01:21.210> on<00:01:21.450> the<00:01:21.540> good

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689 
means i can go and focus on the good

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:23.990 
means i can go and focus on the good
stuff<00:01:21.990> that<00:01:22.170> does<00:01:23.009> higher<00:01:23.340> engagement<00:01:23.490> and

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:24.000 
stuff that does higher engagement and

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:25.570 
stuff that does higher engagement and
alerts<00:01:24.210> or<00:01:24.360> stuff<00:01:24.540> in<00:01:24.659> the<00:01:24.750> element<00:01:25.229> of

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:25.580 
alerts or stuff in the element of

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:27.249 
alerts or stuff in the element of
creativity<00:01:26.580> connecting<00:01:26.939> with<00:01:27.030> people

00:01:27.249 --> 00:01:27.259 
creativity connecting with people

00:01:27.259 --> 00:01:29.210 
creativity connecting with people
typically<00:01:28.259> there's<00:01:28.500> lots<00:01:28.680> of<00:01:28.799> commentary

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.220 
typically there's lots of commentary

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.700 
typically there's lots of commentary
around<00:01:29.460> what's<00:01:29.610> going<00:01:29.850> on<00:01:29.970> around<00:01:30.150> ai<00:01:30.540> ai<00:01:30.960> mean
