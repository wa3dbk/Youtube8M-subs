just look at it like I did you have to
actually<00:00:19.470> use<00:00:19.710> the<00:00:20.250> X<00:00:20.910> use<00:00:21.510> and<00:00:21.779> read<00:00:21.990> a<00:00:22.020> little

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:22.260 
actually use the X use and read a little

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:24.490 
actually use the X use and read a little
text<00:00:22.590> thingy<00:00:22.800> and<00:00:23.189> and<00:00:23.880> that<00:00:24.029> counts<00:00:24.330> as<00:00:24.449> one

00:00:24.490 --> 00:00:24.500 
text thingy and and that counts as one

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.929 
text thingy and and that counts as one
so<00:00:25.500> next<00:00:25.769> we're<00:00:25.920> gonna<00:00:25.980> go<00:00:26.070> to<00:00:26.189> Sanders<00:00:26.580> Gorge

00:00:26.939 --> 00:00:29.450 
so next we're gonna go to Sanders Gorge
it's<00:00:27.689> pretty<00:00:28.050> much<00:00:28.170> the<00:00:28.289> same<00:00:28.470> thing<00:00:28.740> as<00:00:28.890> right

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:29.460 
it's pretty much the same thing as right

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.130 
it's pretty much the same thing as right
as<00:00:29.550> you<00:00:29.640> enter<00:00:29.670> it's<00:00:30.539> right<00:00:30.689> in<00:00:30.810> front<00:00:30.960> of<00:00:31.050> you

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:31.140 
as you enter it's right in front of you

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.590 
as you enter it's right in front of you
it's<00:00:31.289> pretty<00:00:31.470> hard<00:00:31.740> to<00:00:31.830> miss<00:00:31.949> if<00:00:32.279> the<00:00:33.120> four<00:00:33.360> and

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:33.600 
it's pretty hard to miss if the four and

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:35.240 
it's pretty hard to miss if the four and
all<00:00:33.690> most<00:00:33.960> of<00:00:34.050> the<00:00:34.170> zones<00:00:34.380> are<00:00:34.770> right<00:00:35.010> as<00:00:35.130> you

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:35.250 
all most of the zones are right as you

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.100 
all most of the zones are right as you
walk<00:00:35.430> in<00:00:35.670> so<00:00:36.030> they're<00:00:36.210> pretty<00:00:36.719> hard<00:00:36.899> to<00:00:36.960> miss

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:37.110 
walk in so they're pretty hard to miss

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:40.040 
walk in so they're pretty hard to miss

and read the statute I was waiting a
little<00:01:08.189> bit<00:01:08.369> because<00:01:08.610> I<00:01:08.700> didn't<00:01:09.479> know<00:01:09.600> what

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
have to be the one to read it if your

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:23.070 
wayward paths this one is a little

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.469 
wayward paths this one is a little
tricky<00:01:23.850> because<00:01:24.240> you<00:01:24.600> have<00:01:24.840> to<00:01:25.170> actually<00:01:25.979> kill

00:01:26.469 --> 00:01:26.479 
tricky because you have to actually kill

00:01:26.479 --> 00:01:29.149 
tricky because you have to actually kill
knocks<00:01:27.479> first<00:01:28.049> and<00:01:28.409> then<00:01:28.590> it's<00:01:28.710> right<00:01:28.890> past

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159 
knocks first and then it's right past

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:32.420 
knocks first and then it's right past
his<00:01:29.430> room<00:01:30.320> we<00:01:31.320> had<00:01:31.470> a<00:01:31.500> little<00:01:31.590> ATD<00:01:32.040> right<00:01:32.220> here

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:32.430 
his room we had a little ATD right here

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.270 
his room we had a little ATD right here
because<00:01:32.729> we<00:01:32.909> were<00:01:33.000> all<00:01:33.119> like<00:01:33.360> look<00:01:33.780> scenery

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:34.280 
because we were all like look scenery

00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.460 
because we were all like look scenery
but<00:01:35.280> we<00:01:35.400> overcame<00:01:35.549> that<00:01:36.090> very<00:01:36.810> quickly<00:01:37.079> and

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:37.470 
but we overcame that very quickly and

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:39.530 
but we overcame that very quickly and
then<00:01:38.009> in<00:01:38.159> here<00:01:38.549> where<00:01:38.759> you<00:01:38.850> actually<00:01:39.000> fight

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:39.540 
then in here where you actually fight

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:43.340 
then in here where you actually fight
knocks<00:01:39.869> we<00:01:40.860> got<00:01:41.040> lost<00:01:41.579> because<00:01:42.360> when<00:01:42.930> I<00:01:42.960> ran<00:01:43.229> up

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:43.350 
knocks we got lost because when I ran up

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.359 
knocks we got lost because when I ran up
here<00:01:43.470> to<00:01:43.590> the<00:01:43.710> door<00:01:43.860> it<00:01:44.549> didn't<00:01:44.970> open<00:01:45.090> so<00:01:46.369> it

00:01:47.359 --> 00:01:47.369 
here to the door it didn't open so it

00:01:47.369 --> 00:01:49.310 
here to the door it didn't open so it
was<00:01:47.520> confusing<00:01:47.939> but<00:01:48.630> it<00:01:48.720> turns<00:01:48.899> out<00:01:49.049> we're

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:49.320 
was confusing but it turns out we're

00:01:49.320 --> 00:01:51.530 
was confusing but it turns out we're
just<00:01:49.500> dumb<00:01:49.710> and<00:01:50.040> when<00:01:51.030> I<00:01:51.090> turn<00:01:51.270> back<00:01:51.390> around

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:51.540 
just dumb and when I turn back around

00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:52.490 
just dumb and when I turn back around
I'm<00:01:51.720> like<00:01:51.840> oh<00:01:51.990> it's<00:01:52.170> open

00:01:52.490 --> 00:01:52.500 
I'm like oh it's open

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.590 
I'm like oh it's open
and<00:01:53.280> as<00:01:53.610> you<00:01:53.729> can<00:01:53.850> see<00:01:54.000> we're<00:01:54.210> trying<00:01:54.420> to<00:01:54.479> do

00:01:54.590 --> 00:01:54.600 
and as you can see we're trying to do

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:58.940 
and as you can see we're trying to do
one<00:01:55.290> of<00:01:55.430> Tennessee's<00:01:56.430> quest<00:01:57.079> 100<00:01:58.079> components

00:01:58.940 --> 00:01:58.950 
one of Tennessee's quest 100 components

00:01:58.950 --> 00:02:00.499 
one of Tennessee's quest 100 components
and<00:01:59.189> it<00:01:59.790> couldn't<00:02:00.060> pass<00:02:00.180> up<00:02:00.329> the<00:02:00.479> opportunity

00:02:00.499 --> 00:02:00.509 
and it couldn't pass up the opportunity

00:02:00.509 --> 00:02:02.810 
and it couldn't pass up the opportunity
to<00:02:01.170> kill<00:02:01.380> two<00:02:01.530> claptraps<00:02:02.070> and<00:02:02.460> get<00:02:02.640> two

00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:02.820 
to kill two claptraps and get two

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.510 
to kill two claptraps and get two
components<00:02:03.659> so<00:02:04.229> the<00:02:04.950> rise<00:02:05.100> you<00:02:05.130> come<00:02:05.399> through

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:05.520 
components so the rise you come through

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:07.280 
components so the rise you come through
the<00:02:05.640> door<00:02:05.670> it's<00:02:06.390> right<00:02:06.540> in<00:02:06.659> front<00:02:06.810> of<00:02:06.869> you<00:02:07.020> you
