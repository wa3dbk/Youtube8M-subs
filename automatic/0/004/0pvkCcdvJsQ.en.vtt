00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:04.330
 and today I got up even more manly 

00:00:02.440 --> 00:00:07.950
 never 

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:07.950
 but why do you laugh at my sheep 

00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:12.490
 and it's going to change 

00:00:23.710 --> 00:00:28.160
 very good to all guys and welcome 

00:00:26.119 --> 00:00:31.399
 to a new review of a way to 

00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:32.989
 minecraft 17 points 10 and we will see a 

00:00:31.399 --> 00:00:35.180
 So the truth is that it 's pretty 

00:00:32.989 --> 00:00:37.399
 interesting because it adds wings to 

00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:38.960
 minecraft and chickens to is no longer going to be the 

00:00:37.399 --> 00:00:41.089
 only one that will have wings apart from the 

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:42.320
 bat we will also have 

00:00:41.089 --> 00:00:44.300
 wings and less 

00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:46.579
 he says listen to them and the chickens come 

00:00:44.300 --> 00:00:48.199
 super fast the question with this mode 

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:51.019
 let's find a new break is the 

00:00:48.199 --> 00:00:52.879
 file now what would be now of 

00:00:51.019 --> 00:00:54.320
 fairies or something like that well if it's that open 

00:00:52.879 --> 00:00:56.449
 english help me to everton I do not know very 

00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:59.449
 well we're going to find it starting 

00:00:56.449 --> 00:01:00.979
 from layer 60 down well it's very easy to 

00:00:59.449 --> 00:01:02.989
 find according to the forum in what I've 

00:01:00.979 --> 00:01:04.939
 read and when we finish it will give us 

00:01:02.989 --> 00:01:06.590
 the order continue with this now let's 

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:08.630
 have to do little things to get 

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:10.549
 our wings good first we have to 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:12.950
 change the crisis medium 

00:01:10.549 --> 00:01:16.159
 but this weird one is well character with two 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:18.259
 Fairy powders good in this this gold is 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:20.390
 what we have here is going to give us a powder 

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:22.610
 of fairy well that I did not show it and 

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:24.920
 now yes with two fairy powders and two 

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:27.710
 normal hours we get this which 

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:28.930
 we burn it and we get the then 

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:31.630
 we have to burn this in him 

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:33.550
 as you can see we get the ingot to 

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:35.200
 from this ingot is that we are going to 

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:37.300
 do first the basics that are the 

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:39.190
 tools like example the peak the 

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:41.890
 Typical Kratos of all life and a 

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:44.050
 sword the middle crisis is short the 

00:01:41.890 --> 00:01:45.490
 sword a little mediocre the name I would 

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:47.260
 I guess it's mediocre or something 

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:49.360
 but well, nothing happens with two 

00:01:47.260 --> 00:01:51.040
 of these mediocre ingots and two 

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:52.750
 diamonds and well we just grab 

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:54.820
 this and let's go let's do tests of 

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:57.460
 super fast speed only for 

00:01:54.820 --> 00:02:00.070
 do well test the speed either 

00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:01.869
 is that it is a god of mine but how fast and 

00:02:00.070 --> 00:02:04.750
 the peak then you have two thousand five thousand 

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:07.030
 600 uses or something like that and the ax then 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:10.119
 there are no trees nearby so I can not 

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:12.180
 teach and finally for not to see 

00:02:10.119 --> 00:02:15.910
 always that I can not forget about this 

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:17.920
 and my god, well, not this, so I do not know 

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:20.110
 do what I installed mod for 

00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:23.530
 Molasses character nothing more and finally 

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:25.540
 we have the medium crisis half block 

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:27.100
 wanted something like that well it will be dealt with nine 

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:28.930
 and because it's just a block like 

00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:30.970
 decoration but it will also serve us 

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:33.459
 for other things that I'm going to teach you 

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:34.490
 here the sword this by the way has 10 

00:02:33.459 --> 00:02:37.250
 years of attack well 

00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:39.290
 pretty good and now we're going with the 

00:02:37.250 --> 00:02:40.610
 wings that will allow us to fly first 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:43.400
 that nothing will have to change the 

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:47.270
 alf in wings of this weird good says that 

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:49.040
 stays with two or three mediocre in 

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:50.660
 ghost or good the mediocre ingots 

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.490
 this good I do not know how they are called well in 

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:55.130
 Spanish but good two fire powder 

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:57.140
 fairy two feathers a pearl dender and 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:59.630
 a fly core of this rare one in turn 

00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:01.970
 it is left with two pearls a star 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:04.100
 and two ingots so it's a craft was 

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:05.780
 a little weird well now what do we do with 

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:09.430
 this then what we have to do according to 

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:12.320
 I understand is to change first a 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:14.720
 table of these of alfonsÃ­n or how it 

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:16.490
 pronounce is made with four woods two 

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:19.610
 two emerald diamonds and a block of 

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:22.160
 medium crisis and then with this or as 

00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:24.110
 tell the block we click and when you 

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:26.150
 we click right with our wing is 

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:28.460
 As you can see, it is assumed that 

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:31.250
 activated me next that that goes well 

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:34.280
 then let's see I can open this 

00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:35.840
 like this good good good and beyond 

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:37.640
 the ticket that already had what we have 

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:39.410
 what to do is give each one something 

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:41.090
 this weird thing ' that is 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:43.070
 a separate mode that is installed that at 

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:45.110
 final is to teach how to insert everything and 

00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:49.090
 as you can see we put this just 

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:49.090
 here and how can you see 

00:03:51.520 --> 00:03:54.770
 but good as you can see we get 

00:03:53.510 --> 00:03:58.730
 these areas in this case came out of 

00:03:54.770 --> 00:04:00.590
 Yes, but manly butterfly 

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:02.000
 we can remove if we want but we can 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:04.040
 change it well for example what click 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.960
 again we will be able to change it in the 

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:08.090
 case is number 5 I'm going to put it 

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:10.040
 again to see good this is another 

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:11.450
 model well then we can change it 

00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:14.330
 how many times do we want until you 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:15.950
 like one I'll choose another one to see to see 

00:04:14.330 --> 00:04:20.209
 the number 6 that gives me the number 6 

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:21.440
 how is this all are butterfly wings 

00:04:20.209 --> 00:04:22.700
 really why because everything is the 

00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:24.890
 that are happening there is an egg in plan 

00:04:22.700 --> 00:04:28.100
 manly I think this one is a bit more 

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:30.020
 male and of opposites is that he wants to take 

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:33.290
 a lot to choose a variety 

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:35.870
 huge to see which one you like the 

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:37.790
 technology to see how you look is shy 

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:39.710
 my god but but but my god and 

00:04:37.790 --> 00:04:41.000
 diabolical that I am because I stay with this one 

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:43.100
 I do not know I'm staying with this one is the most 

00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.810
 manly who has been able to find all 

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:49.020
 the wings and it is supposed that with this then 

00:04:45.810 --> 00:04:50.430
 we can fly in survival and how can 

00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:51.900
 see has the animation of flying even 

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:54.600
 It's super good and I really love it 

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:56.040
 I love it looks super good and then if 

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:58.020
 the crafton is a bit expensive but the 

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:59.730
 true that it's worth the 

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:02.070
 speed at which we are flying is 

00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:03.990
 quite the creative difference and 

00:05:02.070 --> 00:05:06.240
 then it's pretty good I imagine that 

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:07.980
 I do not have the fall year logically not 

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:09.990
 we have so it's super good 

00:05:07.980 --> 00:05:12.030
 true then this table more than anything 

00:05:09.990 --> 00:05:14.100
 It serves to change the model of our 

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:16.710
 wings well then it's super good me 

00:05:14.100 --> 00:05:18.360
 love the mod and nothing that 's what 

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:20.040
 add the bike is a super short mod 

00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:21.960
 but that is super super good 

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:24.570
 loved it so nothing guys I will send 

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:28.470

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:51.510
 installation in this way 

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:54.060
 very good guys we are in the situation 

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:56.040
 of the wings of fame moto as 

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:57.240
 pronounced for minecraft 17 points 10

 to this minecraft mods page on 

00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:04.710
 Spanish will simply go down to 

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:06.570
 They have to be downloaded at the bottom 

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:08.550
 where you say download it logically and 

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:10.320
 apart they have to download a bookstore 

00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:12.450
 I'm going to let you know what this is 

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:13.800
 which simply have to wait three 

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:15.810
 corresponding seconds and 

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:18.150
 a file will automatically be downloaded 

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:20.460
 called let's go well we will appear two 

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:22.260
 files like this the mod and in the 

00:06:20.460 --> 00:06:23.970
 Bubble library or as it is pronounced 

00:06:22.260 --> 00:06:26.520
 what we do now is the good start 

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:28.260
 run percent app data percent 

00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:30.570
 and as you can see we are going to enter 

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:32.520
 different let's enter pointed 

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:34.920
 minecraft folder mod and simply 

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:36.660
 we drag the two downloaded files 

00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:39.630
 inside the folder a lot and what 

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:41.160
 we would have installed completely like this 

00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:43.050
 that with nothing more kids already know the ay 

00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:44.460
