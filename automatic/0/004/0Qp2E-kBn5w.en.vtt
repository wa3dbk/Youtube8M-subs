sawhorse<00:00:28.800> never<00:00:29.800> bother<00:00:30.040> to<00:00:30.130> pick<00:00:30.340> it<00:00:30.489> up

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:30.640 
sawhorse never bother to pick it up

00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.170 
sawhorse never bother to pick it up
until<00:00:31.509> this<00:00:31.660> evening<00:00:31.869> when<00:00:32.259> I<00:00:32.290> struck<00:00:32.590> my<00:00:32.770> mind

00:00:33.170 --> 00:00:33.180 
until this evening when I struck my mind

00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:35.819 
until this evening when I struck my mind
which<00:00:34.180> is<00:00:34.390> two<00:00:34.570> days<00:00:34.720> later<00:00:35.020> so<00:00:35.470> I<00:00:35.559> hadn't

00:00:35.819 --> 00:00:35.829 
which is two days later so I hadn't

00:00:35.829 --> 00:00:36.960 
which is two days later so I hadn't
gotten<00:00:35.950> out<00:00:36.070> to<00:00:36.130> pick<00:00:36.280> it<00:00:36.370> back<00:00:36.460> up<00:00:36.670> and<00:00:36.910> again

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:36.970 
gotten out to pick it back up and again

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:40.410 
gotten out to pick it back up and again
this<00:00:37.570> is<00:00:37.720> a<00:00:37.750> very<00:00:37.930> rural<00:00:38.410> area<00:00:39.150> so<00:00:40.150> I'm<00:00:40.270> not

00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:40.420 
this is a very rural area so I'm not

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:41.880 
this is a very rural area so I'm not
really<00:00:40.480> concerned<00:00:40.810> about<00:00:41.020> anybody<00:00:41.440> taking<00:00:41.680> it

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:41.890 
really concerned about anybody taking it

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:44.640 
really concerned about anybody taking it
because<00:00:42.040> there's<00:00:42.780> very<00:00:43.780> few<00:00:43.810> people<00:00:44.410> around

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:44.650 
because there's very few people around

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:50.150 
because there's very few people around
me

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:50.160 

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:52.740 

here<00:00:51.120> is<00:00:51.239> the<00:00:51.450> site

00:00:52.740 --> 00:00:52.750 
here is the site

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:54.890 
here is the site
was<00:00:52.810> facing<00:00:53.200> inward<00:00:53.560> this<00:00:54.100> is<00:00:54.280> on<00:00:54.490> the

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:54.900 
was facing inward this is on the

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:57.570 
was facing inward this is on the
basically<00:00:55.900> facing<00:00:56.320> in<00:00:56.500> towards<00:00:56.710> the<00:00:57.040> sawhorse

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:57.580 
basically facing in towards the sawhorse

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:59.700 
basically facing in towards the sawhorse
so<00:00:58.300> it<00:00:58.360> was<00:00:58.450> relatively<00:00:58.900> protected<00:00:59.170> from<00:00:59.650> the

00:00:59.700 --> 00:00:59.710 
so it was relatively protected from the

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:02.490 
so it was relatively protected from the
elements<00:01:00.270> very<00:01:01.270> little<00:01:01.600> in<00:01:01.720> terms<00:01:01.780> of

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:02.500 
elements very little in terms of

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.219 
elements very little in terms of
corrosion<00:01:02.770> again<00:01:03.489> this<00:01:03.580> is<00:01:03.760> an<00:01:03.880> old<00:01:04.120> one<00:01:04.269> tool

00:01:05.219 --> 00:01:05.229 
corrosion again this is an old one tool

00:01:05.229 --> 00:01:08.520 
corrosion again this is an old one tool
steel<00:01:05.530> blade<00:01:06.690> this<00:01:07.690> is<00:01:07.810> the<00:01:07.930> other<00:01:08.050> side<00:01:08.380> that

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:08.530 
steel blade this is the other side that

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:10.020 
steel blade this is the other side that
was<00:01:08.620> exposed<00:01:09.010> to<00:01:09.160> the<00:01:09.250> elements<00:01:09.369> for<00:01:09.760> two<00:01:09.850> days

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:10.030 
was exposed to the elements for two days

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:13.740 
was exposed to the elements for two days
BAM<00:01:11.310> now<00:01:12.310> wow<00:01:12.610> that<00:01:12.970> looks<00:01:13.270> kind<00:01:13.660> of

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:13.750 
BAM now wow that looks kind of

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:16.109 
BAM now wow that looks kind of
horrendous<00:01:14.160> the<00:01:15.160> interesting<00:01:15.700> thing<00:01:15.760> to<00:01:16.000> note

00:01:16.109 --> 00:01:16.119 
horrendous the interesting thing to note

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:18.600 
horrendous the interesting thing to note
is<00:01:16.540> it's<00:01:17.050> actually<00:01:17.350> all<00:01:17.770> surface<00:01:18.400> rust

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:18.610 
is it's actually all surface rust

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:21.690 
is it's actually all surface rust
there's<00:01:19.330> very<00:01:19.840> little<00:01:20.080> deep<00:01:20.619> pitting<00:01:21.520> and

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:21.700 
there's very little deep pitting and

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.930 
there's very little deep pitting and
again<00:01:21.970> this<00:01:22.390> is<00:01:22.630> two<00:01:22.930> days<00:01:23.170> left<00:01:23.770> outside<00:01:24.160> and

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:24.940 
again this is two days left outside and

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:26.850 
again this is two days left outside and
this<00:01:25.660> kind<00:01:25.840> of<00:01:25.960> weather<00:01:26.110> and<00:01:26.290> you<00:01:26.560> can<00:01:26.710> see

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:26.860 
this kind of weather and you can see

00:01:26.860 --> 00:01:28.350 
this kind of weather and you can see
basically<00:01:27.070> it's<00:01:27.340> been<00:01:27.430> raining<00:01:27.640> non-stop<00:01:27.910> for

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:28.360 
basically it's been raining non-stop for

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:30.090 
basically it's been raining non-stop for
the<00:01:28.420> last<00:01:28.509> two<00:01:28.840> days<00:01:29.020> and<00:01:29.770> it's<00:01:29.979> also

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:30.100 
the last two days and it's also

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:31.889 
the last two days and it's also
fluctuating<00:01:30.880> around<00:01:31.090> zero<00:01:31.420> so<00:01:31.660> we're<00:01:31.810> getting

00:01:31.889 --> 00:01:31.899 
fluctuating around zero so we're getting

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:34.560 
fluctuating around zero so we're getting
some<00:01:32.140> freezing<00:01:32.410> rain<00:01:32.560> snow<00:01:33.340> and<00:01:33.640> again<00:01:34.330> right

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:34.570 
some freezing rain snow and again right

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:36.719 
some freezing rain snow and again right
next<00:01:34.869> to<00:01:34.960> the<00:01:35.080> ocean<00:01:35.200> and<00:01:35.619> that's<00:01:36.430> one<00:01:36.580> of<00:01:36.670> the

00:01:36.719 --> 00:01:36.729 
next to the ocean and that's one of the

00:01:36.729 --> 00:01:39.719 
next to the ocean and that's one of the
curious<00:01:37.210> things<00:01:37.920> about<00:01:38.920> stainless<00:01:39.310> steel

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:39.729 
curious things about stainless steel

00:01:39.729 --> 00:01:42.870 
curious things about stainless steel
versus<00:01:40.330> tool<00:01:40.990> steel<00:01:41.350> with<00:01:42.160> some<00:01:42.399> stainless

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:42.880 
versus tool steel with some stainless

00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:44.580 
versus tool steel with some stainless
steels<00:01:43.090> once<00:01:43.390> they<00:01:43.600> start<00:01:43.930> the<00:01:44.080> rust<00:01:44.350> you'll

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:44.590 
steels once they start the rust you'll

00:01:44.590 --> 00:01:47.190 
steels once they start the rust you'll
get<00:01:44.800> very<00:01:45.070> deep<00:01:45.280> pitting<00:01:45.729> with<00:01:46.420> non<00:01:46.660> stainless

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:47.200 
get very deep pitting with non stainless

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.410 
get very deep pitting with non stainless
tool<00:01:47.410> seals<00:01:47.740> you<00:01:48.039> tend<00:01:48.340> to<00:01:48.460> get<00:01:48.670> very<00:01:48.850> very

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:49.420 
tool seals you tend to get very very

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:51.690 
tool seals you tend to get very very
heavy<00:01:49.690> surface<00:01:50.289> rust<00:01:50.530> but<00:01:51.100> you<00:01:51.220> don't<00:01:51.460> get

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:51.700 
heavy surface rust but you don't get

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:53.940 
heavy surface rust but you don't get
that<00:01:51.729> basically<00:01:52.420> strong<00:01:52.810> pitting<00:01:53.229> and<00:01:53.380> that

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:53.950 
that basically strong pitting and that

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:55.800 
that basically strong pitting and that
black<00:01:54.280> stuff<00:01:54.430> there<00:01:54.880> is<00:01:54.910> just<00:01:55.270> welcome<00:01:55.570> people

00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:55.810 
black stuff there is just welcome people

00:01:55.810 --> 00:01:58.109 
black stuff there is just welcome people
normally<00:01:56.350> call<00:01:56.530> the<00:01:56.649> patina<00:01:57.010> that's<00:01:57.700> just<00:01:57.909> one

00:01:58.109 --> 00:01:58.119 
normally call the patina that's just one

00:01:58.119 --> 00:02:01.050 
normally call the patina that's just one
of<00:01:58.150> the<00:01:58.270> other<00:01:58.420> forms<00:01:58.990> of<00:01:59.260> iron<00:01:59.799> oxide<00:02:00.310> or<00:02:00.580> rust

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:01.060 
of the other forms of iron oxide or rust

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.539 
of the other forms of iron oxide or rust
and<00:02:01.810> again<00:02:02.110> while<00:02:02.290> this<00:02:02.439> looks<00:02:02.860> absolutely

00:02:03.539 --> 00:02:03.549 
and again while this looks absolutely

00:02:03.549 --> 00:02:06.390 
and again while this looks absolutely
crazy<00:02:04.060> this<00:02:05.049> is<00:02:05.200> very<00:02:05.470> trivial<00:02:05.890> to<00:02:05.979> clean<00:02:06.159> off

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:06.400 
crazy this is very trivial to clean off

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.009 
crazy this is very trivial to clean off
because<00:02:06.729> it's<00:02:06.880> all<00:02:07.030> surface<00:02:07.420> rust<00:02:07.570> in<00:02:07.840> fact

00:02:08.009 --> 00:02:08.019 
because it's all surface rust in fact

00:02:08.019 --> 00:02:09.870 
because it's all surface rust in fact
that<00:02:08.170> will<00:02:08.320> actually<00:02:08.410> come<00:02:08.769> off<00:02:09.009> put<00:02:09.729> your

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:09.880 
that will actually come off put your

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:15.940 
that will actually come off put your
hand<00:02:10.230> Squatch

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:15.950 

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:17.890 

and<00:02:16.489> all<00:02:16.670> this<00:02:16.879> stuff<00:02:17.000> will<00:02:17.270> just<00:02:17.300> wipe<00:02:17.629> off

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:17.900 
and all this stuff will just wipe off

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:20.229 
and all this stuff will just wipe off
and<00:02:18.709> what<00:02:18.920> you'll<00:02:19.069> have<00:02:19.280> left<00:02:19.610> under<00:02:19.879> needed

00:02:20.229 --> 00:02:20.239 
and what you'll have left under needed

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:22.630 
and what you'll have left under needed
are<00:02:20.629> these<00:02:20.900> little<00:02:21.080> black<00:02:21.349> spots<00:02:21.769> which<00:02:22.489> are

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:22.640 
are these little black spots which are

00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:24.250 
are these little black spots which are
essentially<00:02:23.060> to<00:02:23.150> patina<00:02:23.480> that<00:02:23.660> people<00:02:24.080> try

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:24.260 
essentially to patina that people try

00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:26.890 
essentially to patina that people try
the<00:02:24.319> force<00:02:24.650> on<00:02:24.890> it<00:02:25.090> so<00:02:26.090> this<00:02:26.239> is<00:02:26.269> after<00:02:26.599> about

00:02:26.890 --> 00:02:26.900 
the force on it so this is after about

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:28.630 
the force on it so this is after about
30<00:02:27.200> seconds<00:02:27.650> in<00:02:27.769> the<00:02:27.860> kitchen<00:02:28.220> with<00:02:28.310> one<00:02:28.519> of

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:28.640 
30 seconds in the kitchen with one of

00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:30.009 
30 seconds in the kitchen with one of
those<00:02:28.790> sort<00:02:29.030> of<00:02:29.090> rough<00:02:29.360> plastic<00:02:29.840> pot

00:02:30.009 --> 00:02:30.019 
those sort of rough plastic pot

00:02:30.019 --> 00:02:32.259 
those sort of rough plastic pot
scrubbers<00:02:30.500> you<00:02:31.220> can<00:02:31.370> see<00:02:31.519> all<00:02:31.730> the<00:02:31.760> orange

00:02:32.259 --> 00:02:32.269 
scrubbers you can see all the orange

00:02:32.269 --> 00:02:34.300 
scrubbers you can see all the orange
rust<00:02:32.510> is<00:02:32.720> gone<00:02:32.959> there's<00:02:33.410> some<00:02:33.620> slight<00:02:33.950> patina

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:34.310 
rust is gone there's some slight patina

00:02:34.310 --> 00:02:36.670 
rust is gone there's some slight patina
English<00:02:34.819> and<00:02:35.599> there's<00:02:35.900> no<00:02:36.050> significant

00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:36.680 
English and there's no significant

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.880 
English and there's no significant
damage<00:02:37.450> anywhere<00:02:38.450> and<00:02:39.140> just<00:02:39.170> to<00:02:39.470> show<00:02:39.530> you<00:02:39.709> how

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890 
damage anywhere and just to show you how

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:46.650 
damage anywhere and just to show you how
little<00:02:40.550> this<00:02:40.640> is<00:02:40.790> actually<00:02:41.120> been<00:02:41.239> affected

00:02:46.650 --> 00:02:46.660 

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:51.940 

this<00:02:47.660> also<00:02:50.080> still<00:02:51.080> hasn't<00:02:51.380> been<00:02:51.470> sharpened

00:02:51.940 --> 00:02:51.950 
this also still hasn't been sharpened

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:53.680 
this also still hasn't been sharpened
since<00:02:52.160> I<00:02:52.280> got<00:02:52.489> it<00:02:52.670> although<00:02:53.000> I<00:02:53.030> will<00:02:53.299> sharpen

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:53.690 
since I got it although I will sharpen

00:02:53.690 --> 00:02:56.979 
since I got it although I will sharpen
it<00:02:53.810> now<00:02:53.989> because<00:02:54.950> in<00:02:55.190> a<00:02:55.280> few<00:02:55.549> little<00:02:55.819> areas<00:02:56.360> the

00:02:56.979 --> 00:02:56.989 
it now because in a few little areas the

00:02:56.989 --> 00:02:59.680 
it now because in a few little areas the
patina<00:02:57.319> has<00:02:57.590> sort<00:02:57.799> of<00:02:57.860> affected<00:02:58.370> the<00:02:58.489> edge<00:02:58.690> so

00:02:59.680 --> 00:02:59.690 
patina has sort of affected the edge so

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:02.440 
patina has sort of affected the edge so
I'll<00:02:59.840> polish<00:03:00.079> that<00:03:00.380> off
