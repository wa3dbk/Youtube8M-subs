it's<00:04:02.870> out<00:04:03.050> of<00:04:03.080> Michigan<00:04:03.590> so<00:04:04.250> you<00:04:04.310> probably

00:04:04.690 --> 00:04:04.700 
it's out of Michigan so you probably

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:05.949 
it's out of Michigan so you probably
don't<00:04:04.880> find<00:04:05.150> it<00:04:05.330> in<00:04:05.450> the<00:04:05.570> middle<00:04:05.810> of<00:04:05.870> the

don't find it in the middle of the
country<00:04:06.380> I<00:04:06.560> can<00:04:06.980> get<00:04:07.130> it<00:04:07.220> on<00:04:07.280> the<00:04:07.400> East<00:04:07.550> Coast

00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:07.820 
country I can get it on the East Coast

00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:09.910 
country I can get it on the East Coast
pretty<00:04:08.330> easily<00:04:08.510> on<00:04:08.750> Pennsylvania<00:04:09.590> at<00:04:09.650> least<00:04:09.800> I

00:04:09.910 --> 00:04:09.920 
pretty easily on Pennsylvania at least I

00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:11.949 
pretty easily on Pennsylvania at least I
should<00:04:09.980> say<00:04:10.130> so<00:04:10.310> it<00:04:11.150> is<00:04:11.300> distributed<00:04:11.600> other

00:04:11.949 --> 00:04:11.959 
should say so it is distributed other

00:04:11.959 --> 00:04:13.990 
should say so it is distributed other
places<00:04:12.230> rather<00:04:12.590> than<00:04:12.769> Michigan<00:04:13.040> so<00:04:13.730> if<00:04:13.910> you

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:14.000 
places rather than Michigan so if you

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.370 
places rather than Michigan so if you
can<00:04:14.090> get<00:04:14.239> it<00:04:14.360> I<00:04:14.420> definitely<00:04:14.810> recommend<00:04:15.050> trying

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:15.380 
can get it I definitely recommend trying

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:17.890 
can get it I definitely recommend trying
it<00:04:15.530> out<00:04:15.650> it's<00:04:15.890> a<00:04:16.010> really<00:04:16.430> good<00:04:16.609> IPA<00:04:16.970> so<00:04:17.600> until

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:17.900 
it out it's a really good IPA so until

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:20.769 
it out it's a really good IPA so until
