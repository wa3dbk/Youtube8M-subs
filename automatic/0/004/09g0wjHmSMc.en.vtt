making it I'll show you how to make it
there's<00:00:31.590> two<00:00:31.710> different<00:00:31.829> ways<00:00:32.040> you<00:00:32.189> can<00:00:32.250> do<00:00:32.340> it

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:32.489 
there's two different ways you can do it

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:35.150 
there's two different ways you can do it
and<00:00:32.750> this<00:00:33.750> is<00:00:33.870> one<00:00:34.050> way<00:00:34.170> we<00:00:34.380> use<00:00:34.829> two<00:00:35.010> balloons

00:00:35.150 --> 00:00:35.160 
and this is one way we use two balloons

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.830 
and this is one way we use two balloons
and<00:00:35.790> tape<00:00:35.940> them<00:00:36.059> together<00:00:36.149> nice<00:00:36.480> to<00:00:36.690> get<00:00:36.780> a

00:00:36.830 --> 00:00:36.840 
and tape them together nice to get a

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.450 
and tape them together nice to get a
nice<00:00:37.020> shape<00:00:37.230> and<00:00:37.440> put<00:00:37.800> more<00:00:37.950> tape<00:00:38.130> on<00:00:38.309> them

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:38.460 
nice shape and put more tape on them

00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:40.490 
nice shape and put more tape on them
tape<00:00:38.940> it<00:00:39.059> up<00:00:39.149> really<00:00:39.450> good<00:00:39.600> and<00:00:40.110> then<00:00:40.379> you

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:40.500 
tape it up really good and then you

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:42.980 
tape it up really good and then you
paper<00:00:40.680> mache<00:00:41.070> up<00:00:41.219> and<00:00:41.690> then<00:00:42.690> you'll<00:00:42.840> have

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:42.990 
paper mache up and then you'll have

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:44.240 
paper mache up and then you'll have
watermelon<00:00:43.320> once<00:00:43.650> you<00:00:43.740> paint<00:00:43.890> it<00:00:44.070> you'll<00:00:44.190> be

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600 
all set it won't take long it's not a

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.870 
all set it won't take long it's not a
long<00:00:45.960> project<00:00:46.440> to<00:00:46.560> do<00:00:46.710> just<00:00:47.340> getting<00:00:47.670> it<00:00:47.760> to

00:00:47.870 --> 00:00:47.880 
long project to do just getting it to

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:49.640 
long project to do just getting it to
look<00:00:48.060> good<00:00:48.210> take<00:00:48.510> some<00:00:48.690> time<00:00:48.870> the<00:00:49.050> painting<00:00:49.290> of

materials and you know I was considering

00:01:28.139 --> 00:01:30.440 
materials and you know I was considering
two<00:01:28.319> different<00:01:28.590> sizes<00:01:29.069> I<00:01:29.280> was<00:01:29.789> I<00:01:29.999> could<00:01:30.270> make<00:01:30.420> a

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450 
two different sizes I was I could make a

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:33.020 
two different sizes I was I could make a
watermelon<00:01:30.810> about<00:01:31.109> this<00:01:31.289> big<00:01:31.880> and<00:01:32.880> these

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:33.030 
watermelon about this big and these

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:34.399 
watermelon about this big and these
bowls<00:01:33.240> are<00:01:33.359> the<00:01:33.479> end<00:01:33.630> pieces<00:01:33.840> but<00:01:34.200> I<00:01:34.229> think

00:01:34.399 --> 00:01:34.409 
bowls are the end pieces but I think

00:01:34.409 --> 00:01:35.749

watermelon and it's coming out pretty
good<00:04:38.770> one<00:04:39.770> thing<00:04:39.890> I<00:04:39.950> did<00:04:40.130> was<00:04:40.750> fall<00:04:41.750> part<00:04:42.080> of<00:04:42.200> it

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:42.320 
good one thing I did was fall part of it

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:43.840 
good one thing I did was fall part of it
I<00:04:42.380> used<00:04:42.560> a<00:04:42.620> darker<00:04:42.980> green<00:04:43.250> and<00:04:43.310> then<00:04:43.550> I<00:04:43.640> looked

00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:43.850 
I used a darker green and then I looked

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:45.430 
I used a darker green and then I looked
and<00:04:43.970> then<00:04:44.060> I<00:04:44.120> added<00:04:44.330> yellow<00:04:44.750> to<00:04:45.290> make<00:04:45.380> a

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:45.440 
and then I added yellow to make a

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:47.020 
and then I added yellow to make a
lighter<00:04:45.890> green<00:04:46.250> because<00:04:46.580> that's<00:04:46.790> the<00:04:46.910> way<00:04:47.000> a

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:47.030 
lighter green because that's the way a

00:04:47.030 --> 00:04:48.910 
lighter green because that's the way a
real<00:04:47.300> watermelon<00:04:47.870> is<00:04:47.960> it<00:04:48.140> isn't<00:04:48.410> uniformly

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:48.920 
real watermelon is it isn't uniformly

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:51.340 
real watermelon is it isn't uniformly
green<00:04:49.250> so<00:04:50.060> I<00:04:50.090> got<00:04:50.360> a<00:04:50.390> darker<00:04:50.750> green<00:04:50.900> here<00:04:51.200> and

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:51.350 
green so I got a darker green here and

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:52.690 
green so I got a darker green here and
then<00:04:51.440> it<00:04:51.530> gets<00:04:51.620> to<00:04:51.740> a<00:04:51.830> lighter<00:04:52.100> green<00:04:52.340> here<00:04:52.610> by

00:04:52.690 --> 00:04:52.700 
then it gets to a lighter green here by

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:54.460 
then it gets to a lighter green here by
adding<00:04:53.000> some<00:04:53.150> yellow<00:04:53.390> to<00:04:53.570> it<00:04:53.690> and<00:04:53.900> all<00:04:54.200> I<00:04:54.230> did

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:54.470 
adding some yellow to it and all I did

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:56.890 
adding some yellow to it and all I did
was<00:04:54.620> use<00:04:54.800> a<00:04:54.860> kiss<00:04:55.310> makes<00:04:55.580> washable<00:04:56.480> non-toxic
