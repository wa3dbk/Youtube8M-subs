across<00:00:23.440> the<00:00:23.530> line<00:00:23.790> it's<00:00:24.790> done<00:00:24.970> on<00:00:25.000> the<00:00:25.210> lap

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680 
across the line it's done on the lap

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.720 
across the line it's done on the lap
finding<00:00:26.680> a<00:00:26.740> breaking<00:00:27.010> point<00:00:27.160> it's<00:00:27.340> very<00:00:27.490> bumpy

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:27.730 
finding a breaking point it's very bumpy

finding a breaking point it's very bumpy
into<00:00:28.000> turn<00:00:28.180> one<00:00:28.680> she's<00:00:29.680> a<00:00:29.800> curve<00:00:30.070> and<00:00:30.250> it

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:30.690 
into turn one she's a curve and it

it's very bumpy again ministry circuit
2009<00:00:40.809> 11<00:00:41.110> in<00:00:41.230> Singapore<00:00:41.710> so<00:00:41.980> was<00:00:42.760> a<00:00:42.790> pretty

00:00:43.020 --> 00:00:43.030 
2009 11 in Singapore so was a pretty

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:44.700 
2009 11 in Singapore so was a pretty
special<00:00:43.390> weekend<00:00:43.690> the<00:00:44.080> track<00:00:44.320> is<00:00:44.350> in<00:00:44.590> there

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:44.710 
special weekend the track is in there

00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:46.110 
special weekend the track is in there
goes<00:00:44.860> the<00:00:45.040> street<00:00:45.280> circuit<00:00:45.610> and<00:00:45.730> rod<00:00:45.850> street

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:46.120 
goes the street circuit and rod street

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:48.600 
goes the street circuit and rod street
circuits<00:00:46.650> it's<00:00:47.650> a<00:00:47.680> race<00:00:47.860> also<00:00:48.100> there's<00:00:48.400> quite

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:48.610 
circuits it's a race also there's quite

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:49.619 
circuits it's a race also there's quite
difficult<00:00:48.820> because<00:00:49.000> you<00:00:49.180> have<00:00:49.300> to<00:00:49.420> stay<00:00:49.600> on

00:00:49.619 --> 00:00:49.629 
difficult because you have to stay on

00:00:49.629 --> 00:00:51.060 
difficult because you have to stay on
european<00:00:50.110> time<00:00:50.140> so<00:00:50.559> it<00:00:50.650> means<00:00:50.770> you're<00:00:50.949> going

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:51.070 
european time so it means you're going

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:54.330 
european time so it means you're going
to<00:00:51.160> bed<00:00:51.370> at<00:00:51.520> like<00:00:51.699> 6am<00:00:52.629> and<00:00:53.170> waking<00:00:53.500> up<00:00:53.590> 2<00:00:53.980> p.m.

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:54.340 
to bed at like 6am and waking up 2 p.m.

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:55.920 
to bed at like 6am and waking up 2 p.m.
in<00:00:54.579> the<00:00:54.640> daytime<00:00:55.030> but<00:00:55.090> the<00:00:55.420> race<00:00:55.540> starts<00:00:55.870> at

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:55.930 
in the daytime but the race starts at

00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:59.000 
in the daytime but the race starts at
kind<00:00:56.140> of<00:00:56.230> 10<00:00:56.739> p.m.<00:00:56.950> at<00:00:57.070> night<00:00:57.220> so<00:00:57.460> it's<00:00:57.610> true

00:00:59.000 --> 00:00:59.010 
kind of 10 p.m. at night so it's true

00:00:59.010 --> 00:01:01.770 
kind of 10 p.m. at night so it's true
turn<00:01:00.010> 5<00:01:00.280> really<00:01:01.030> important<00:01:01.510> to<00:01:01.570> keep<00:01:01.690> the

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:12.220 
gotten the hallway down here webcam

00:01:12.220 --> 00:01:14.520 
gotten the hallway down here webcam
hundred-meter<00:01:12.670> Sun<00:01:13.000> and<00:01:13.899> lots<00:01:14.140> of<00:01:14.259> speed<00:01:14.500> in

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:14.530 
hundred-meter Sun and lots of speed in

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:19.139 
hundred-meter Sun and lots of speed in
cars<00:01:15.280> all<00:01:15.460> over<00:01:15.580> the<00:01:15.790> place<00:01:17.910> breaking<00:01:18.910> for

00:01:19.139 --> 00:01:19.149 
cars all over the place breaking for

00:01:19.149 --> 00:01:20.830 
cars all over the place breaking for
nice<00:01:19.570> tight<00:01:19.810> hairpin

00:01:20.830 --> 00:01:20.840 
nice tight hairpin

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:22.450 
nice tight hairpin
at<00:01:21.259> this<00:01:21.380> point<00:01:21.590> it<00:01:21.770> ties<00:01:21.920> a<00:01:21.950> really<00:01:22.280> hot

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:22.460 
at this point it ties a really hot

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.880 
at this point it ties a really hot
subtraction<00:01:23.030> very<00:01:23.270> difficult<00:01:23.710> here's<00:01:24.710> the

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:24.890 
subtraction very difficult here's the

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.099 
subtraction very difficult here's the
corner<00:01:25.189> about<00:01:25.369> being<00:01:25.579> patient<00:01:25.929> being<00:01:26.929> careful

00:01:27.099 --> 00:01:27.109 
corner about being patient being careful

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:29.880 
corner about being patient being careful
it's<00:01:27.619> so<00:01:27.950> easy<00:01:28.100> to<00:01:28.250> have<00:01:28.820> an<00:01:28.909> oversteer<00:01:29.270> moment

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:29.890 
it's so easy to have an oversteer moment

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:32.139 
it's so easy to have an oversteer moment
we've<00:01:30.890> come<00:01:31.069> down<00:01:31.250> to<00:01:31.399> a<00:01:31.429> really<00:01:31.640> tricky<00:01:31.880> part

00:01:32.139 --> 00:01:32.149 
we've come down to a really tricky part

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:33.459 
we've come down to a really tricky part
of<00:01:32.210> the<00:01:32.270> circuit<00:01:32.630> way<00:01:32.750> it<00:01:32.810> used<00:01:32.929> to<00:01:32.990> be<00:01:33.140> chicane

00:01:33.459 --> 00:01:33.469 
of the circuit way it used to be chicane

00:01:33.469 --> 00:01:35.469 
of the circuit way it used to be chicane
never<00:01:33.799> got<00:01:33.950> a<00:01:33.979> quite<00:01:34.520> a<00:01:34.549> fast<00:01:34.880> left-hander

00:01:35.469 --> 00:01:35.479 
never got a quite a fast left-hander

00:01:35.479 --> 00:01:38.050 
never got a quite a fast left-hander
which<00:01:35.869> Akane<00:01:36.170> was<00:01:36.380> terrible<00:01:36.710> before<00:01:37.060> this

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:38.060 
which Akane was terrible before this

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.209 
which Akane was terrible before this
chicane<00:01:38.360> is<00:01:38.479> quite<00:01:38.659> quick<00:01:38.899> and<00:01:39.590> we<00:01:39.679> come<00:01:39.890> gets

00:01:40.209 --> 00:01:40.219 
chicane is quite quick and we come gets

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:41.800 
chicane is quite quick and we come gets
quite<00:01:40.429> tight<00:01:40.640> the<00:01:40.789> road<00:01:40.969> here<00:01:41.209> under<00:01:41.719> this

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:41.810
