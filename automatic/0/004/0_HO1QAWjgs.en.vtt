 filtered from omega ruby and sapphire pokemon 

00:00:08.099 --> 00:00:11.519
 alpha but good clouds before starting 

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.349
 with this video that says do not believe that 

00:00:11.519 --> 00:00:15.089
 can destroy that button I like and 

00:00:13.349 --> 00:00:17.880
 we can reach at least 500 

00:00:15.089 --> 00:00:20.340
 you like to hope that yes but good as 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.980
 well you will know at the time it was hacked 

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.019
 pokemon xc and a lot of mega pokemon 

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:27.420
 a lot of things were confirmed 

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:30.300
 for a very long time before 

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:33.120
 nintendo will confirm it officially 

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:36.110
 making it completely reliable 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:38.720
 trust that you can 

00:00:36.110 --> 00:00:40.550
 you can hack this as good as 

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:42.380
 everyone will know or at least all the 

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:45.620
 world while it is not in america since 

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:47.600
 he has his blond pokemon remakes my 

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:50.030
 challenge at the end the demo well then here 

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:53.260
 it is not there yet , but it was already 

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:55.970
 hacked like this is friends was already hacked 

00:00:53.260 --> 00:00:58.309
 this demo we already have a lot of 

00:00:55.970 --> 00:01:00.500
 information we already have all the states 

00:00:58.309 --> 00:01:02.150
 bases of all the new megas that have 

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:04.040
 been announced equally if they want 

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:05.630
 to bring it in a video put it here 

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:07.640
 down in the comments but in this 

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:10.280
 chance I will talk about one thing 

00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:11.810
 that was quite strange but even 

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:15.830
 it was one of the best things that was 

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:18.920
 revealed since it was revealed mega upa or 

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:21.380
 failing to suck in a way 

00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:24.229
 alternative friends like that is I do not know 

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:26.440
 exactly 100% how you can 

00:01:24.229 --> 00:01:29.479
 get this mega form or this way 

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:32.420
 sorry or this alternative way but that 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:34.190
 yes this was already revealed we can already 

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:36.770
 obviously you're putting a 

00:01:34.190 --> 00:01:38.479
 small step is that you can that can 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.549
 see what looks like a juice but this seems 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:41.600
 more like some guardian or something 

00:01:40.549 --> 00:01:44.090
 the style 

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:46.790
 because this longer leave their hands six 

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:49.159
 hands that float can see that you see a 

00:01:46.790 --> 00:01:51.530
 little bit more different from what we already 

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:54.770
 have used nintendo I do not know for 

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:57.009
 nobody childish looks too weird 

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:59.869
 this mega ju for this occupies in form 

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:01.490
 alternative but nevertheless it is very 

00:01:59.869 --> 00:02:03.140
 interesting and the truth we still do not know 

00:02:01.490 --> 00:02:05.450
 how to be able to get it or if it's going to 

00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:08.360
 appear within the demo but that yes 

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:10.940
 this pokemon we are 100% betting that 

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:13.610
 is going to be a brutality I think and if I do not 

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:15.800
 wrong walk with him attracts the movement 

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:18.560
 dimensional fury that is a movement or 

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:20.870
 exclusive of this mega ju for like in 

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:23.480
 the alternative way we are not yet 

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:26.030
 exactly 100% that will be the most 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.950
 sure is that it is real because equally 

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:30.140
 It was taken out by the people who took 

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:33.019
 all the statistics of all the 

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:35.480
 pokemon so it's almost 100% likely from 

00:02:33.019 --> 00:02:37.790
 that this is completely real but without 

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:41.269
 However this mega chuppa 

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:43.340
 goes in the alternative way leaves a lot of 

00:02:41.269 --> 00:02:46.040
 that thinking the truth really exists 

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:48.230
 this pokemon that was smoked nintendo this 

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:50.150
 Pokemon will be as good as it looks 

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:51.890
 Well, good friends, I'm no more than 

00:02:50.150 --> 00:02:53.780
 eager to see absolutely everything 

00:02:51.890 --> 00:02:55.370
 you can know about this pokemon but for 

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:57.049
 the moment here I say goodbye 

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:58.700

00:02:57.049 --> 00:03:00.920

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:03.200
