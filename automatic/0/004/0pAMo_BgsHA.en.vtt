plays<00:06:37.669> a<00:06:37.699> much<00:06:38.569> more<00:06:38.749> stripped-down<00:06:39.139> version

00:06:39.639 --> 00:06:39.649 
plays a much more stripped-down version

00:06:39.649 --> 00:06:41.049 
plays a much more stripped-down version
of<00:06:39.709> that<00:06:39.889> because<00:06:40.219> obviously<00:06:40.369> to<00:06:40.699> play<00:06:40.879> that

00:06:41.049 --> 00:06:41.059 
of that because obviously to play that

00:06:41.059 --> 00:06:45.669 
of that because obviously to play that
and<00:06:41.179> sing<00:06:42.159> be<00:06:43.159> quite<00:06:43.369> difficult<00:06:44.439> so<00:06:45.439> I<00:06:45.469> think

00:06:45.669 --> 00:06:45.679 
and sing be quite difficult so I think

00:06:45.679 --> 00:06:46.870 
and sing be quite difficult so I think
it<00:06:45.800> just<00:06:46.009> tends<00:06:46.219> to<00:06:46.309> play<00:06:46.519> along

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:46.880
