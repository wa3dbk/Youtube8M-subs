awkward<00:01:37.259> as<00:01:37.560> I<00:01:37.680> thought<00:01:37.860> it<00:01:38.040> would<00:01:38.070> be<00:01:38.460> like

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:39.090 
awkward as I thought it would be like

00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:40.730 
awkward as I thought it would be like
some<00:01:39.329> of<00:01:39.450> the<00:01:39.509> older<00:01:39.810> pens<00:01:40.020> that<00:01:40.110> I<00:01:40.229> had<00:01:40.439> used

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740 
some of the older pens that I had used

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.740 
some of the older pens that I had used
and<00:01:41.040> it<00:01:41.130> does<00:01:41.280> not<00:01:41.520> scratch<00:01:41.880> the<00:01:41.939> screen<00:01:42.240> I<00:01:42.570> am

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:42.750 
and it does not scratch the screen I am

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:51.680 
and it does not scratch the screen I am
currently<00:01:42.960> not<00:01:43.470> using<00:01:44.040> a<00:01:44.159> screen<00:01:44.460> protector

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:51.690 

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:55.460 

it<00:01:51.900> does<00:01:52.650> not<00:01:52.830> have<00:01:53.310> palm<00:01:54.240> rejection<00:01:54.510> so<00:01:55.200> this

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470 
it does not have palm rejection so this

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.080 
it does not have palm rejection so this
is<00:01:55.620> why<00:01:55.770> I'm<00:01:55.920> wearing<00:01:56.130> just<00:01:56.550> a<00:01:56.640> garden<00:01:56.940> globe

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:57.090 
is why I'm wearing just a garden globe

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.820 
is why I'm wearing just a garden globe
where<00:01:57.300> it<00:01:57.360> cut<00:01:57.510> off<00:01:57.600> the<00:01:57.780> hand<00:01:58.020> the<00:01:58.500> fingers

00:01:58.820 --> 00:01:58.830 
where it cut off the hand the fingers

00:01:58.830 --> 00:02:01.550 
where it cut off the hand the fingers
for<00:01:59.130> it<00:01:59.250> and<00:01:59.930> it's<00:02:00.930> just<00:02:01.200> like<00:02:01.260> a<00:02:01.380> dollar

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:01.560 
for it and it's just like a dollar

zoom in with your fingers like you would

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:35.760 
zoom in with your fingers like you would
if<00:02:22.959> you<00:02:23.470> were<00:02:23.709> drawing<00:02:24.010> with<00:02:24.660> your<00:02:25.660> finger

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:37.540 
it doesn't make a whole lot of noise

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:40.860 
it doesn't make a whole lot of noise
when<00:02:37.570> it<00:02:37.900> hits<00:02:37.990> the<00:02:38.290> screen<00:02:39.660> doesn't<00:02:40.660> feel

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:40.870 
when it hits the screen doesn't feel

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:42.450 
when it hits the screen doesn't feel
like<00:02:41.020> it's<00:02:41.230> scratching<00:02:41.530> it<00:02:41.860> even<00:02:42.100> though<00:02:42.280> this

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:42.460 
like it's scratching it even though this

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:45.000 
like it's scratching it even though this
is<00:02:42.670> a<00:02:42.700> little<00:02:42.970> bit<00:02:43.090> harder<00:02:43.450> plastic<00:02:43.690> but<00:02:44.380> it's

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.010 
is a little bit harder plastic but it's

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:50.700 
is a little bit harder plastic but it's
very<00:02:45.460> well<00:02:45.730> done<00:02:46.200> very<00:02:47.200> cool<00:02:47.530> idea<00:02:49.710> the

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:50.710 
very well done very cool idea the

00:02:50.710 --> 00:02:52.980 
very well done very cool idea the
buttons<00:02:51.130> would<00:02:51.460> work<00:02:51.790> on<00:02:52.060> this<00:02:52.270> one<00:02:52.540> if<00:02:52.840> they

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:52.990 
buttons would work on this one if they

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:54.900 
buttons would work on this one if they
had<00:02:53.140> implemented<00:02:53.500> them<00:02:53.800> but<00:02:53.950> not<00:02:54.130> just<00:02:54.400> yet<00:02:54.520> I

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:54.910 
had implemented them but not just yet I

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:59.480 
had implemented them but not just yet I
heard<00:02:55.540> that<00:02:55.570> they<00:02:55.900> will<00:02:56.050> be<00:02:56.170> doing<00:02:56.320> that<00:02:56.590> later

00:02:59.480 --> 00:02:59.490 

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:12.559 

which<00:03:00.490> is<00:03:00.850> for<00:03:01.210> undo<00:03:01.660> and<00:03:02.050> redo

00:03:12.559 --> 00:03:12.569 

00:03:12.569 --> 00:03:15.199 

this<00:03:13.260> pen<00:03:13.560> is<00:03:13.590> actually<00:03:14.159> really<00:03:14.549> precise

00:03:15.199 --> 00:03:15.209 
this pen is actually really precise

00:03:15.209 --> 00:03:16.789 
this pen is actually really precise
compared<00:03:15.749> to<00:03:15.840> some<00:03:16.019> of<00:03:16.049> the<00:03:16.230> other<00:03:16.260> pens<00:03:16.709> that

00:03:16.789 --> 00:03:16.799 
compared to some of the other pens that

00:03:16.799 --> 00:03:19.250 
compared to some of the other pens that
I<00:03:16.889> had<00:03:17.099> used<00:03:17.340> because<00:03:17.549> you<00:03:17.819> can<00:03:17.999> see<00:03:18.299> where

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:19.260 
I had used because you can see where

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:20.899 
I had used because you can see where
you're<00:03:19.409> going<00:03:19.439> to<00:03:19.859> draw<00:03:20.219> through<00:03:20.609> the<00:03:20.730> little

00:03:20.899 --> 00:03:20.909 
you're going to draw through the little

00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:57.380 
you're going to draw through the little
plastic<00:03:21.180> piece

00:03:57.380 --> 00:03:57.390 

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:59.690 

it<00:03:57.960> makes<00:03:58.200> drawing<00:03:58.380> on<00:03:58.650> the<00:03:58.740> iPad<00:03:59.130> really<00:03:59.490> fun

00:03:59.690 --> 00:03:59.700 
it makes drawing on the iPad really fun

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:02.600 
it makes drawing on the iPad really fun
again<00:03:59.970> as<00:04:00.380> I<00:04:01.380> wasn't<00:04:01.770> too<00:04:01.890> keen<00:04:02.100> on<00:04:02.250> some<00:04:02.490> of

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:02.610 
again as I wasn't too keen on some of

00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:05.350 
again as I wasn't too keen on some of
the<00:04:02.700> other<00:04:02.850> pens<00:04:03.209> the<00:04:03.810> Wacom<00:04:04.200> pen<00:04:04.230> was<00:04:04.709> great

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:05.360 
the other pens the Wacom pen was great

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:10.490 
the other pens the Wacom pen was great
for<00:04:06.360> what<00:04:06.720> it<00:04:06.840> did<00:04:07.310> but<00:04:08.750> never<00:04:09.750> asked<00:04:10.050> precise

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500 
for what it did but never asked precise

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:16.880 
for what it did but never asked precise
is<00:04:10.680> something<00:04:10.980> like<00:04:11.130> this<00:04:13.880> and<00:04:15.169> it<00:04:16.169> lasting<00:04:16.620> 12

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:16.890 
is something like this and it lasting 12

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:30.600 
is something like this and it lasting 12
hours<00:04:17.190> is<00:04:17.340> actually<00:04:17.730> a<00:04:17.760> long<00:04:18.090> time

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:30.610 

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:32.860 

you<00:04:31.610> can<00:04:31.730> import<00:04:31.910> any<00:04:32.300> of<00:04:32.450> these<00:04:32.600> drawings
