courses interesting enough if you want

00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:28.890 
courses interesting enough if you want
to<00:01:26.590> change<00:01:26.880> the<00:01:27.880> transmission<00:01:28.300> of<00:01:28.600> the<00:01:28.660> car

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:28.900 
to change the transmission of the car

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:30.800 
to change the transmission of the car
you<00:01:29.050> have<00:01:29.170> to<00:01:29.230> hold<00:01:29.530> down<00:01:29.650> the<00:01:29.710> a<00:01:29.860> button<00:01:30.220> and

00:01:30.800 --> 00:01:30.810 
you have to hold down the a button and

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:33.600 
you have to hold down the a button and
it'll<00:01:31.810> go<00:01:32.020> to<00:01:32.050> manual<00:01:32.470> release<00:01:33.190> it<00:01:33.430> and

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:33.610 
it'll go to manual release it and

00:01:33.610 --> 00:01:36.510 
it'll go to manual release it and
defaults<00:01:34.540> automatic<00:01:35.110> so<00:01:35.830> we'll<00:01:36.250> just<00:01:36.370> do

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:36.520 
defaults automatic so we'll just do

00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:39.840 
defaults automatic so we'll just do
manual<00:01:36.910> do<00:01:37.480> it<00:01:37.540> on<00:01:37.660> medium<00:01:38.020> here<00:01:38.610> pressing<00:01:39.610> up

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:39.850 
manual do it on medium here pressing up

00:01:39.850 --> 00:01:40.500 
manual do it on medium here pressing up
and<00:01:40.030> down

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:40.510 
and down

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:43.290 
and down
it's<00:01:40.720> a<00:01:40.810> 7-speed<00:01:41.500> transmission<00:01:41.850> so<00:01:42.850> pressing

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:43.300 
it's a 7-speed transmission so pressing

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:45.570 
it's a 7-speed transmission so pressing
down<00:01:43.630> will<00:01:43.870> go<00:01:44.020> up<00:01:44.290> and<00:01:44.620> pressing<00:01:45.250> up<00:01:45.340> will<00:01:45.490> go

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:45.580 
down will go up and pressing up will go

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:48.359 
down will go up and pressing up will go
down<00:01:45.760> so

00:01:48.359 --> 00:01:48.369 

00:01:48.369 --> 00:01:50.950 

also<00:01:49.369> the<00:01:49.520> see<00:01:49.700> button<00:01:50.000> here<00:01:50.240> will<00:01:50.450> change<00:01:50.479> our

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:50.960 
also the see button here will change our

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:52.660 
also the see button here will change our
camera<00:01:51.320> angle<00:01:51.439> which<00:01:51.740> can<00:01:51.920> be<00:01:52.009> pretty<00:01:52.460> helpful

00:01:52.660 --> 00:01:52.670 
camera angle which can be pretty helpful

00:01:52.670 --> 00:01:56.919 
camera angle which can be pretty helpful
sometimes<00:01:54.609> if<00:01:55.609> you<00:01:55.759> change<00:01:56.030> it<00:01:56.179> too<00:01:56.479> far<00:01:56.780> out

00:01:56.919 --> 00:01:56.929 
sometimes if you change it too far out

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:58.359 
sometimes if you change it too far out
it<00:01:57.140> gives<00:01:57.259> you<00:01:57.380> a<00:01:57.409> really<00:01:57.710> really<00:01:58.159> weird

00:01:58.359 --> 00:01:58.369 
it gives you a really really weird

00:01:58.369 --> 00:01:59.800 
it gives you a really really weird
perspective<00:01:58.939> and<00:01:59.060> it's<00:01:59.149> hard<00:01:59.299> to<00:01:59.329> control<00:01:59.630> the

00:01:59.800 --> 00:01:59.810 
perspective and it's hard to control the

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.649 
perspective and it's hard to control the
car

00:02:03.649 --> 00:02:03.659 

00:02:03.659 --> 00:02:05.330

whoo<00:02:29.230> cars<00:02:29.950> are<00:02:30.099> spin<00:02:30.340> now

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:37.980 

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:41.120 

still<00:02:38.490> a<00:02:38.520> lot<00:02:38.670> of<00:02:38.790> fun<00:02:39.000> to<00:02:39.090> play<00:02:39.830> even<00:02:40.830> with<00:02:40.950> the

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:41.130 
still a lot of fun to play even with the

00:02:41.130 --> 00:03:13.670 
still a lot of fun to play even with the
mistakes

00:03:13.670 --> 00:03:13.680 

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.260 

yeah<00:03:14.680> you<00:03:15.190> know<00:03:15.280> if<00:03:15.640> you<00:03:15.820> haven't<00:03:15.970> played<00:03:16.150> it

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:16.270 
yeah you know if you haven't played it

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:17.150 
yeah you know if you haven't played it
in<00:03:16.330> a<00:03:16.360> while

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.160 
in a while

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:19.050 
in a while
or<00:03:18.160> if<00:03:18.250> you<00:03:18.340> haven't<00:03:18.460> played<00:03:18.640> it<00:03:18.670> before<00:03:18.970> it

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:19.060 
or if you haven't played it before it

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:20.070 
or if you haven't played it before it
might<00:03:19.180> be<00:03:19.270> a<00:03:19.300> little<00:03:19.420> tricky<00:03:19.690> to<00:03:19.720> get<00:03:19.870> the<00:03:20.050> hang

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:20.080 
might be a little tricky to get the hang

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:24.930 
might be a little tricky to get the hang
of<00:03:21.040> at<00:03:21.220> first<00:03:21.250> but<00:03:21.760> still<00:03:22.150> a<00:03:22.180> lot<00:03:22.300> of<00:03:22.360> fun<00:03:23.760> up<00:03:24.760> in

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940 
of at first but still a lot of fun up in

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:26.880 
of at first but still a lot of fun up in
the<00:03:25.030> middle<00:03:25.240> you<00:03:25.420> can<00:03:25.450> see<00:03:25.720> your<00:03:26.050> your<00:03:26.620> time

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:26.890 
the middle you can see your your time

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:28.410 
the middle you can see your your time
and<00:03:27.130> that's<00:03:27.250> how<00:03:27.400> much<00:03:27.580> time<00:03:27.790> you<00:03:27.850> have<00:03:28.150> to<00:03:28.300> get

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:28.420 
and that's how much time you have to get

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:31.950 
and that's how much time you have to get
to<00:03:28.570> the<00:03:28.660> next<00:03:28.920> checkpoint<00:03:29.920> and<00:03:30.750> you<00:03:31.750> know<00:03:31.840> if

00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:31.960 
to the next checkpoint and you know if

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:33.000 
to the next checkpoint and you know if
you<00:03:32.080> make<00:03:32.230> it<00:03:32.440> then<00:03:32.590> you<00:03:32.650> get<00:03:32.770> a<00:03:32.800> time

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:33.010 
you make it then you get a time

00:03:33.010 --> 00:03:35.040 
you make it then you get a time
extension<00:03:33.580> but<00:03:33.850> if<00:03:34.060> you<00:03:34.300> don't<00:03:34.450> make<00:03:34.660> it<00:03:34.690> well

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:35.050 
extension but if you don't make it well

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:38.420 
extension but if you don't make it well
then<00:03:35.350> like<00:03:35.530> most<00:03:35.740> games<00:03:36.010> with<00:03:36.480> timed

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:38.430 
then like most games with timed

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:41.190 
then like most games with timed
checkpoints<00:03:39.430> then<00:03:39.610> the<00:03:39.730> game<00:03:39.910> is<00:03:39.940> over<00:03:40.150> so<00:03:40.420> as

00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:41.200 
checkpoints then the game is over so as

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:42.780 
checkpoints then the game is over so as
long<00:03:41.350> as<00:03:41.470> you<00:03:41.560> make<00:03:41.710> the<00:03:41.920> the<00:03:42.400> checkpoint

00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:42.790 
long as you make the the checkpoint

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:51.000 
long as you make the the checkpoint
you'll<00:03:43.000> be<00:03:43.090> okay

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:51.010 

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:52.920 

then<00:03:51.549> you<00:03:51.670> get<00:03:51.790> that<00:03:51.909> little<00:03:51.970> boost<00:03:52.420> of<00:03:52.569> music

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:52.930 
then you get that little boost of music

00:03:52.930 --> 00:03:55.110 
then you get that little boost of music
there<00:03:53.080> for<00:03:53.319> a<00:03:53.349> little<00:03:53.590> one<00:03:53.739> you<00:03:53.950> know<00:03:54.250> a<00:03:54.430> few

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:55.120 
there for a little one you know a few

00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:11.809 
there for a little one you know a few
seconds<00:03:55.569> it's<00:03:56.049> very<00:03:56.230> interesting

00:04:11.809 --> 00:04:11.819 

00:04:11.819 --> 00:04:20.150 

oh<00:04:17.299> there<00:04:18.299> we<00:04:18.479> go<00:04:18.630> game<00:04:18.959> over<00:04:19.380> you<00:04:20.070> know

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:20.160 
oh there we go game over you know

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.640 
oh there we go game over you know

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:30.720 
know kind of simulation perspective and

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:32.689 
know kind of simulation perspective and
you<00:04:31.620> know<00:04:31.650> once<00:04:31.889> you<00:04:31.949> get<00:04:32.070> into<00:04:32.310> a<00:04:32.340> little<00:04:32.550> bit
