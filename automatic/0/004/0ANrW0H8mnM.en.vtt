00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:47.210 
dead skin and generally I do like honey

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:49.750

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:50.950 
and sugar to exfoliate but I won't be
doing<00:04:49.880> that<00:04:50.060> anymore<00:04:50.300> because<00:04:50.539> this<00:04:50.810> is

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:50.960 
doing that anymore because this is

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:55.180 
doing that anymore because this is
awesome<00:04:51.380> and<00:04:52.150> it's<00:04:53.650> infusing<00:04:54.650> hydration<00:04:55.100> to

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:55.190 
awesome and it's infusing hydration to

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:57.670 
awesome and it's infusing hydration to
protecting<00:04:55.820> with<00:04:56.090> SPF<00:04:56.570> 20<00:04:56.930> in<00:04:57.110> just<00:04:57.350> 2<00:04:57.650> simple

00:04:57.670 --> 00:04:57.680 
protecting with SPF 20 in just 2 simple

00:04:57.680 --> 00:05:00.940 
protecting with SPF 20 in just 2 simple
steps<00:04:58.070> so<00:04:58.490> I<00:04:58.700> mean<00:04:59.600> it<00:05:00.169> seems<00:05:00.440> like<00:05:00.530> it<00:05:00.770> does

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:00.950 
steps so I mean it seems like it does

00:05:00.950 --> 00:05:03.310 
steps so I mean it seems like it does
everything<00:05:01.340> it<00:05:01.669> claims<00:05:02.030> to<00:05:02.330> do<00:05:02.450> hydrate<00:05:03.050> plump

00:05:03.310 --> 00:05:03.320 
everything it claims to do hydrate plump

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:05.830 
everything it claims to do hydrate plump
and<00:05:03.500> protects<00:05:03.800> so<00:05:04.250> I<00:05:04.669> actually<00:05:05.300> really<00:05:05.600> like

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:05.840 
and protects so I actually really like

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:07.330 
and protects so I actually really like
this<00:05:05.960> product<00:05:06.229> and<00:05:06.530> it<00:05:06.590> doesn't<00:05:06.890> make<00:05:07.010> my<00:05:07.130> lips
