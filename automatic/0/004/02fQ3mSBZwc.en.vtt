material in both rooms and we've been

00:02:56.989 --> 00:03:00.339 
material in both rooms and we've been
running<00:02:57.319> a<00:02:57.409> sort<00:02:57.650> of<00:02:58.030> quasi<00:02:59.030> poll<00:02:59.359> which<00:03:00.139> one

00:03:02.619 --> 00:03:02.629 
do you prefer tubes or solid state and

00:03:02.629 --> 00:03:06.369 
do you prefer tubes or solid state and
it's<00:03:03.200> 50/50<00:03:04.010> good<00:03:04.400> which<00:03:05.329> means<00:03:05.510> 50%<00:03:05.750> of<00:03:06.290> the

00:03:06.369 --> 00:03:06.379 
it's 50/50 good which means 50% of the

00:03:06.379 --> 00:03:13.719 
it's 50/50 good which means 50% of the
population<00:03:06.650> is<00:03:07.129> death<00:03:12.069> of<00:03:13.069> course<00:03:13.370> no<00:03:13.579> one

00:03:13.719 --> 00:03:13.729 
population is death of course no one

population is death of course no one
asked<00:03:14.000> me<00:03:14.060> though<00:03:14.299> we<00:03:14.569> 50%<00:03:16.510> yes

00:03:17.740 --> 00:03:17.750 
asked me though we 50% yes

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:19.659 
asked me though we 50% yes
so<00:03:17.930> anyway<00:03:18.500> ok<00:03:18.979> that's<00:03:19.159> what<00:03:19.280> we're<00:03:19.430> doing

00:03:19.659 --> 00:03:19.669 
so anyway ok that's what we're doing
