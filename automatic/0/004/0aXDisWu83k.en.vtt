00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:49.800 
shocked once twice at the most and it

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.040 
shocked once twice at the most and it
stays<00:00:50.010> well<00:00:50.309> away<00:00:50.340> and<00:00:50.879> that's<00:00:51.539> the<00:00:51.780> end<00:00:51.930> of

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
the digging now add eh did here is great

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:57.350 
the digging now add eh did here is great

00:00:57.350 --> 00:00:57.360 
for keeping your dog from digging out if

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.119 
for keeping your dog from digging out if
I<00:00:57.690> ever<00:00:57.780> want<00:00:58.109> to<00:00:58.140> keep<00:00:58.350> a<00:00:58.469> dog<00:00:58.649> from<00:00:58.949> digging

in from the other side like the

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.049 
in from the other side like the
neighbor's<00:01:01.530> dog<00:01:01.800> I'd<00:01:02.370> either<00:01:02.579> put<00:01:02.879> these

00:01:03.049 --> 00:01:03.059 
neighbor's dog I'd either put these

00:01:03.059 --> 00:01:05.030 
neighbor's dog I'd either put these
insulators<00:01:03.480> down<00:01:03.780> closer<00:01:04.140> to<00:01:04.439> the<00:01:04.559> ground<00:01:04.739> or

insulators down closer to the ground or

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.969 
insulators down closer to the ground or
I<00:01:05.479> move<00:01:06.479> them<00:01:06.689> out<00:01:06.840> from<00:01:07.080> the<00:01:07.110> fence<00:01:07.470> three<00:01:07.860> or

00:01:07.969 --> 00:01:07.979 
I move them out from the fence three or

00:01:07.979 --> 00:01:09.770 
I move them out from the fence three or
four<00:01:08.189> inches<00:01:08.520> maybe<00:01:08.760> put<00:01:09.090> them<00:01:09.210> on<00:01:09.360> a<00:01:09.390> steak

00:01:09.770 --> 00:01:09.780 
four inches maybe put them on a steak

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:12.010 
four inches maybe put them on a steak
with<00:01:09.810> an<00:01:10.110> insulator<00:01:10.530> on<00:01:10.650> top<00:01:11.010> of<00:01:11.189> there<00:01:11.369> a

they might not get a shock because the

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.140 
they might not get a shock because the
wood<00:01:18.960> will<00:01:19.110> insulate<00:01:19.530> them<00:01:19.680> but<00:01:20.460> by<00:01:20.610> shorting

00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:21.150 
wood will insulate them but by shorting
