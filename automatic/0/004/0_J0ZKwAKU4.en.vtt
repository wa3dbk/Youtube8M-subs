00:00:08.219 --> 00:00:16.289
 Hi guys, look here again with one more. 

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:19.119
 continuous morning conversations 

00:00:16.289 --> 00:00:26.380
 jorge that will give to do every Friday 

00:00:19.119 --> 00:00:33.040
 show us yesterday confirmed everton 

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:35.440
 to Apple on September 9, 2014 is that 

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:40.090
 up to two weeks or so about ten 

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:44.790
 days we will know what the 

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:48.010
 What's new is that I'm at the intersection. 

00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:49.660
 because it's there and we 'll see what the 

00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:50.590
 what apple will bring to 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:52.600
 people 

00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:57.300
 most likely it will be a 

00:00:52.600 --> 00:01:03.010
 launch from west to 8 along with our 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:06.009
 long awaited iphone 6 or two models in 

00:01:03.010 --> 00:01:09.759
 team no one knows the ball and mouth 

00:01:06.009 --> 00:01:11.740
 small that will have a model of 4.7 

00:01:09.759 --> 00:01:15.700
 inches than what is almost right 

00:01:11.740 --> 00:01:19.210
 so most likely type and also 

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:23.130
 the 5.5-inch model which is a 

00:01:19.210 --> 00:01:27.969
 absurd screen I do not know 

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:30.490
 He remained in his cell but as 

00:01:27.969 --> 00:01:32.920
 average ham in various media is better 

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:34.479
 I do not speak anything but if something else is too. 

00:01:32.920 --> 00:01:38.950
 that we can expect something 

00:01:34.479 --> 00:01:40.860
 related to the osx1 I hope 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:43.560
 also but not always 

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:45.780
 sx is more difficult to launch the update 

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.450
 than are 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:52.920
 but I do not know, will you? 

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:54.630
 he decided to throw something good 

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:59.910
 also that it would be very cool either 

00:01:54.630 --> 00:02:02.820
 to launch was the lot where I could not 

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:06.300
 how much exam already has this course 

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:09.450
 said raymond and moods well justified 

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:12.420
 thus hiring the little guy who is 

00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:15.600
 clock specialist hired 

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:18.780
 so other another who is an expert of you 

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:22.970
 It's fitness, it's so expensive, you can study. 

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:25.320
 enough and we're going to logos because 

00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:28.680
 everyone has already released is no longer any 

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:30.239
 That's a novelty, everyone understood 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:32.340
 has all brands 

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:36.150
 Now of course we expect the apple 

00:02:32.340 --> 00:02:38.100
 throw something innovative a thing that 

00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:41.190
 we really need to because 

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:42.870
 now these matthew otis they are not 

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:46.170
 so needed right? 

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:49.530
 they are an extension there that I just tell you 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:51.690
 more notifications something but so 

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:56.010
 it's not a thing as soon as you go 

00:02:51.690 --> 00:02:59.700
 I need Mars where it is not now if not 

00:02:56.010 --> 00:03:01.500
 I know what it is going to be right because as 

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:04.230
 I spoke in the last video 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:07.830
 apple does not say more market 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:11.340
 unfortunately at least so far yet 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:13.379
 has not done this since tim cook took over 

00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:16.440
 so we can not expect too much 

00:03:13.379 --> 00:03:19.319
 thing this is what I learned in these 

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:21.450
 years with tim cook now about the invitation 

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:23.160
 I do not know if you saw I put it on 

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:27.720
 twitter and facebook 

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:29.489
 expensive the super minimalist invitation without being 

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:31.650
 that is incredible, I think it's the 

00:03:29.489 --> 00:03:34.440
 first invitation not colored that tim 

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:38.840
 cook fayfi and I have only written well thus 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:41.549
 We would like to be able to see more 

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:43.829
 usually we always look for a 

00:03:41.549 --> 00:03:47.610
 easter egg wine ne 

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:49.860
 apple invitations but this is so 

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:55.680
 minimalist that I honestly can not 

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:58.829
 see nothing nothing at all but I've seen people 

00:03:55.680 --> 00:04:03.060
 telling you that you can see a 

00:03:58.829 --> 00:04:05.549
 clock that knead big 

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:09.930
 that will have the iphone with bigger screen 

00:04:05.549 --> 00:04:13.049
 so dude you can overcome travel in 

00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:15.329
 mayonnaise to try and see something 

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:18.780
 on that invitation I could not see anything 

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:21.989
 unless the date is very legal 9 of 

00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:23.760
 September of the most gent changing subject 

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:25.770
 quickie for this video do not stay 

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:29.789
 great also wanted to leave a warning 

00:04:25.770 --> 00:04:32.280
 here I posted a video yesterday 

00:04:29.789 --> 00:04:36.660
 I know how I'll post this one more case. 

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:38.729
 I posted yesterday of this life of mine. 

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:42.690
 talk about why a video on the 

00:04:38.729 --> 00:04:44.940
 fifth night is a gameplay of the game 

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:48.060
 edil o infinity if you have not seen 

00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:50.370
 see why this game is so crying and 

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:51.539
 who made this game was a group here 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:53.700
 in my city 

00:04:51.539 --> 00:04:57.870
 so what happened they called me 

00:04:53.700 --> 00:05:00.360
 to go and visit their office there and 

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:04.020
 dude, dude, it's going to be too much beer, I'm going 

00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:06.300
 I can talk to the whole team and I 

00:05:04.020 --> 00:05:09.180
 I wanted you if you had any doubts. 

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:10.980
 respect of the game regarding the profession 

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:14.330
 it's not what it is 

00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:17.130
 a game designer a graphic artist 

00:05:14.330 --> 00:05:19.830
 games a game controller 

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:22.260
 so if you have any doubts about 

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:24.390
 this leave below the comments 

00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:26.600
 that I'll take to them and 

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:31.410
 I'll probably make a video there 

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:33.690
 interviewing the beauty so this gal 

00:05:31.410 --> 00:05:35.270
 will probably be on the 

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:38.070
 Monday 

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:39.630
 So leave your doubts before that I 

00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:42.120
 I do not know when I'll be able to conquer 

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:44.580
 this video but I hope it is before 

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:45.900
 second for this warning to have some 

00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:48.960
 right direction 

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:54.750
 another thing guys is that the last video 

00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:57.690
 It was well tremelica give so right and I 

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:59.070
 I tried to make him not get so 

00:05:57.690 --> 00:06:01.950
 tremendous 

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:06.060
 I now in this moment and in the video 

00:06:01.950 --> 00:06:08.940
 I hung it on the right glass and 

00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:10.970
 Even so, I trembled so much that today I 

00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:15.330
 I was trying to attend here on the panel as 

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:16.320
 and did not hold it then fell quickly in the 

00:06:15.330 --> 00:06:20.640
 continent 

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:24.000
 Hi, people today, I'm getting a ghost. 

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:28.260
 with this white blouse the current drug 

00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:31.120
 so how good can not leave the 

00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:33.940
 panel there because in the panel 

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:37.389
 and with much more than in the vehicle I'm 

00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:39.610
 recording in the wounded but in another part of the 

00:06:37.389 --> 00:06:43.210
 my everyday life without many holes 

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:46.419
 now I think I believe so 

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:48.370
 so for now I can not do anything 

00:06:46.419 --> 00:06:50.530
 on that extreme links 

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:53.820
 even because the fault is not my fault 

00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:56.760
 dear thing today I have two provinces 

00:06:53.820 --> 00:07:01.540
 type in the test but you know that exercise 

00:06:56.760 --> 00:07:06.310
 evaluative thing I have a defense of 

00:07:01.540 --> 00:07:10.690
 programming introduction list and 

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:13.000
 I also have an introduction 

00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:16.120
 to the calculation 

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:18.669
 I do this mascara I love car 

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:21.190
 so the 2nd test that I said in the 

00:07:18.669 --> 00:07:24.580
 Last video, cara, it was beautiful. 

00:07:21.190 --> 00:07:28.300
 the algebra test was very beautiful still 

00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:30.580
 He has received the most expensive note but do not know 

00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:32.919
 I think it will be very useful 

00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:35.080
 Good people, that's it, I'm super. 

00:07:32.919 --> 00:07:35.889
 late are almost eight hours of 

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:38.199
 rest 

00:07:35.889 --> 00:07:40.780
 android has a car almost in my 

00:07:38.199 --> 00:07:44.370
 front but it 's sport they 're liking 

00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:44.370
 this video and until the next
