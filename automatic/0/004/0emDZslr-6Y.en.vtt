00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:09.690 
okay so we're out here today with Terry

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:12.170 
okay so we're out here today with Terry
boy<00:00:09.900> from<00:00:10.350> kelowna<00:00:10.770> yamaha<00:00:11.220> downtown<00:00:11.820> on<00:00:12.030> the

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:12.180 
boy from kelowna yamaha downtown on the

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:13.590 
boy from kelowna yamaha downtown on the
west<00:00:12.360> side<00:00:12.500> so

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:13.600 
west side so

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:15.360 
west side so
we<00:00:13.900> wrote<00:00:14.020> carving<00:00:14.710> up<00:00:14.800> some<00:00:14.950> powdered<00:00:15.250> a

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:15.370 
we wrote carving up some powdered a

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:17.910 
we wrote carving up some powdered a
Terry<00:00:15.670> and<00:00:15.880> we<00:00:16.660> thought<00:00:16.870> we'd<00:00:17.050> both<00:00:17.440> on<00:00:17.650> a<00:00:17.680> set

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:17.920 
Terry and we thought we'd both on a set

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:20.100 
Terry and we thought we'd both on a set
of<00:00:18.010> the<00:00:18.100> mt<00:00:18.370> 9<00:00:18.550> skis<00:00:18.910> what's<00:00:19.510> your<00:00:19.660> thoughts<00:00:19.870> on

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:20.110 
of the mt 9 skis what's your thoughts on

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:22.050 
of the mt 9 skis what's your thoughts on
first<00:00:20.500> of<00:00:20.650> all<00:00:20.710> the<00:00:20.860> gold<00:00:21.040> flotation<00:00:21.610> the

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:22.060 
first of all the gold flotation the

00:00:22.060 --> 00:00:24.090 
first of all the gold flotation the
flotation<00:00:22.570> is<00:00:22.720> really<00:00:23.050> good<00:00:23.230> it's<00:00:23.500> better

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:24.100 
flotation is really good it's better

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:26.310 
flotation is really good it's better
than<00:00:24.310> the<00:00:24.430> stock<00:00:24.700> ski<00:00:25.060> the<00:00:25.840> only<00:00:26.050> thing<00:00:26.230> I

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:26.320 
than the stock ski the only thing I

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:28.140 
than the stock ski the only thing I
think<00:00:26.380> that<00:00:26.710> the<00:00:26.890> the<00:00:27.340> paddle<00:00:27.670> of<00:00:27.760> the<00:00:27.880> front

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:28.150 
think that the the paddle of the front

00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:29.970 
think that the the paddle of the front
may<00:00:28.390> have<00:00:28.570> ended<00:00:28.750> a<00:00:28.990> bit<00:00:29.170> early<00:00:29.710> bit

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:29.980 
may have ended a bit early bit

00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:32.339 
may have ended a bit early bit
prematurely<00:00:30.520> because<00:00:31.210> it<00:00:31.420> tends<00:00:31.630> to<00:00:31.810> push<00:00:32.110> in

00:00:32.339 --> 00:00:32.349 
prematurely because it tends to push in

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:34.770 
prematurely because it tends to push in
the<00:00:32.440> snow<00:00:32.710> it<00:00:33.700> doesn't<00:00:33.970> quite<00:00:34.120> get<00:00:34.300> up<00:00:34.420> on<00:00:34.540> top

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:34.780 
the snow it doesn't quite get up on top

00:00:34.780 --> 00:00:36.690 
the snow it doesn't quite get up on top
of<00:00:34.840> the<00:00:35.020> snow<00:00:35.140> as<00:00:35.650> good<00:00:35.980> as<00:00:36.070> I'd<00:00:36.220> like<00:00:36.400> it<00:00:36.550> to

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:36.700 
of the snow as good as I'd like it to

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:39.000 
of the snow as good as I'd like it to
maybe<00:00:37.330> if<00:00:37.510> that<00:00:37.690> waste<00:00:37.989> came<00:00:38.260> back<00:00:38.470> a<00:00:38.500> few<00:00:38.680> more

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:39.010 
maybe if that waste came back a few more

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:41.910 
maybe if that waste came back a few more
inches<00:00:39.480> or<00:00:40.480> a<00:00:40.540> lot<00:00:40.989> further<00:00:41.260> on<00:00:41.530> the<00:00:41.620> inside

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:41.920 
inches or a lot further on the inside

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:43.619 
inches or a lot further on the inside
because<00:00:42.070> it<00:00:42.220> would<00:00:42.309> have<00:00:42.430> no<00:00:42.610> effect<00:00:42.640> there

00:00:43.619 --> 00:00:43.629 
because it would have no effect there

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:44.850 
because it would have no effect there
but<00:00:43.840> then<00:00:43.960> you'd<00:00:44.110> have<00:00:44.140> a<00:00:44.290> left<00:00:44.590> and<00:00:44.739> a<00:00:44.830> right

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:44.860 
but then you'd have a left and a right

00:00:44.860 --> 00:00:51.650 
but then you'd have a left and a right
ski

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:51.660 

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.270 

so<00:00:52.660> here<00:00:52.810> we<00:00:52.900> are<00:00:53.020> again<00:00:53.050> Terry<00:00:53.560> will<00:00:53.740> talk

00:00:54.270 --> 00:00:54.280 
so here we are again Terry will talk

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:55.980 
so here we are again Terry will talk
about<00:00:54.430> say<00:00:54.730> steering<00:00:55.120> effort<00:00:55.240> with<00:00:55.570> the<00:00:55.600> MT

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:55.990 
about say steering effort with the MT

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:58.590 
about say steering effort with the MT
nine<00:00:56.170> he's<00:00:56.710> compared<00:00:57.610> to<00:00:57.730> the<00:00:57.820> stock<00:00:58.060> ones<00:00:58.330> the

00:00:58.590 --> 00:00:58.600 
nine he's compared to the stock ones the

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.510 
nine he's compared to the stock ones the
steering<00:00:59.200> effort<00:00:59.290> is<00:00:59.530> definitely<00:01:00.100> reduced

00:01:00.510 --> 00:01:00.520 
steering effort is definitely reduced

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:03.030 
steering effort is definitely reduced
quite<00:01:01.330> a<00:01:01.390> lot<00:01:01.630> actually<00:01:01.870> it's<00:01:02.230> real<00:01:02.620> nice<00:01:02.800> it's

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:03.040 
quite a lot actually it's real nice it's

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:04.890 
quite a lot actually it's real nice it's
very<00:01:03.190> light<00:01:03.400> steering<00:01:03.750> especially<00:01:04.750> in<00:01:04.839> a

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:04.900 
very light steering especially in a

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:07.140 
very light steering especially in a
situation<00:01:05.080> where<00:01:05.620> you<00:01:05.770> want<00:01:05.950> to<00:01:06.190> pull<00:01:07.120> a

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:07.150 
situation where you want to pull a

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:08.969 
situation where you want to pull a
five-point<00:01:07.840> turn<00:01:08.170> on<00:01:08.380> the<00:01:08.470> trail<00:01:08.680> to<00:01:08.830> turn

00:01:08.969 --> 00:01:08.979 
five-point turn on the trail to turn

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:11.400 
five-point turn on the trail to turn
around<00:01:09.130> and<00:01:09.340> go<00:01:09.430> the<00:01:09.460> other<00:01:09.610> way<00:01:10.080> it's<00:01:11.080> really

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:11.410 
around and go the other way it's really

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:13.050 
around and go the other way it's really
easy<00:01:11.710> when<00:01:11.979> you're<00:01:12.130> almost<00:01:12.430> at<00:01:12.700> a<00:01:12.729> standstill

00:01:13.050 --> 00:01:13.060 
easy when you're almost at a standstill

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:15.540 
easy when you're almost at a standstill
to<00:01:13.479> turn<00:01:13.660> the<00:01:13.840> ski<00:01:14.110> and<00:01:14.380> hit<00:01:14.500> reverse<00:01:14.800> and<00:01:15.100> turn

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:15.550 
to turn the ski and hit reverse and turn

00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:17.700 
to turn the ski and hit reverse and turn
the<00:01:15.670> ski<00:01:15.940> back<00:01:16.240> and<00:01:16.479> forward<00:01:16.810> and<00:01:16.840> so<00:01:17.350> on<00:01:17.470> so

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:17.710 
the ski back and forward and so on so

00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:27.110 
the ski back and forward and so on so
they<00:01:17.830> work<00:01:18.280> really<00:01:18.550> well<00:01:18.670> in<00:01:18.940> that<00:01:19.060> regard

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:27.120 

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.400 

so<00:01:28.120> tell<00:01:28.360> you<00:01:28.420> last<00:01:28.570> thing<00:01:28.810> to<00:01:28.900> discuss<00:01:29.020> on

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:29.410 
so tell you last thing to discuss on

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:30.780 
so tell you last thing to discuss on
these<00:01:29.530> skis<00:01:29.740> compared<00:01:30.130> to<00:01:30.190> the<00:01:30.280> stock<00:01:30.520> ones

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:30.790 
these skis compared to the stock ones

00:01:30.790 --> 00:01:32.850 
these skis compared to the stock ones
will<00:01:30.970> do<00:01:31.120> a<00:01:31.150> say<00:01:31.750> the<00:01:31.870> trail<00:01:32.110> handling<00:01:32.560> up<00:01:32.680> and

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:32.860 
will do a say the trail handling up and

00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:34.350 
will do a say the trail handling up and
down<00:01:32.980> the<00:01:33.130> trail<00:01:33.370> up<00:01:33.550> to<00:01:33.580> the<00:01:33.820> mountains<00:01:34.150> here

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:34.360 
down the trail up to the mountains here

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.750 
down the trail up to the mountains here
the<00:01:35.080> Hamling<00:01:35.590> has<00:01:35.680> been<00:01:35.800> really<00:01:36.040> good<00:01:36.220> of

00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:36.760 
the Hamling has been really good of

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:38.370 
the Hamling has been really good of
course<00:01:37.090> with<00:01:37.330> the<00:01:37.510> lighter<00:01:37.690> steering<00:01:38.200> effort

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:38.380 
course with the lighter steering effort

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:41.040 
course with the lighter steering effort
there's<00:01:39.130> less<00:01:39.460> steering<00:01:40.120> precision<00:01:40.300> as<00:01:40.840> well

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:41.050 
there's less steering precision as well

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:42.690 
there's less steering precision as well
so<00:01:41.260> it<00:01:41.350> tends<00:01:41.500> to<00:01:41.590> push<00:01:41.890> the<00:01:42.100> front<00:01:42.310> end<00:01:42.490> more

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:42.700 
so it tends to push the front end more

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:45.120 
so it tends to push the front end more
than<00:01:42.880> the<00:01:43.000> stock<00:01:43.270> ski<00:01:43.630> in<00:01:44.170> any<00:01:44.800> particular

00:01:45.120 --> 00:01:45.130 
than the stock ski in any particular

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:48.000 
than the stock ski in any particular
snow<00:01:45.550> conditions<00:01:46.090> or<00:01:46.300> just<00:01:46.830> with<00:01:47.830> their

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:48.010 
snow conditions or just with their

00:01:48.010 --> 00:01:50.730 
snow conditions or just with their
powder<00:01:48.280> snow<00:01:48.790> or<00:01:49.330> if<00:01:49.810> there's<00:01:50.080> wet<00:01:50.380> snow

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:50.740 
powder snow or if there's wet snow

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:52.530 
powder snow or if there's wet snow
especially<00:01:51.010> in<00:01:51.430> wet<00:01:51.640> snow<00:01:51.880> it<00:01:52.000> definitely

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:52.540 
especially in wet snow it definitely

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:54.450 
especially in wet snow it definitely
skates<00:01:52.840> the<00:01:52.930> front<00:01:53.229> end<00:01:53.380> more<00:01:53.560> but<00:01:54.130> as<00:01:54.250> long<00:01:54.430> as

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:54.460 
skates the front end more but as long as

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:56.040
