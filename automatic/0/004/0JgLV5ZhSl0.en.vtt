00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:05.449
 hen is the recipe of the day is 

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:11.290
 I qualified for 6 people he 

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:13.900
 take one kg of almonds 500 g of melon 

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:16.449

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:18.190
 confit 200 g caster sugar and the 

00:00:16.449 --> 00:00:19.990
 sheets of azim paper I started 

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:21.640
 by all crushed in the mixer so I take 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:24.280
 really a very good my robot and there 

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:25.720
 go as I go along then 

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:26.980
 pieces of melon confit its very big 

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:28.660
 so I'm going to cut into pieces before 

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:30.100
 to add them the only ingredients that 

00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:35.079
 I do not put in the mixer it's the 

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:36.460
 sugar and azim paper I'm going 

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:38.260
 now be able to make the syrup donations 

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:40.569
 for that I put the sugar in the 

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:42.460
 pan and I wet it slightly and 

00:00:40.569 --> 00:00:44.289
 then very important thing 

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:47.019
 I will bring a thermometer to 

00:00:44.289 --> 00:00:49.569
 sugar to reach 122 debt 

00:00:47.019 --> 00:00:52.239
 and here we have reached 120 we withdraw 

00:00:49.569 --> 00:00:54.510
 fire and we will be able to pour on our 

00:00:52.239 --> 00:00:54.510
 mixed 

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:01.150
 she will now work the dough 

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:04.120
 to knead it for about 20 

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:06.850
 minutes go on the work plan 

00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:09.300
 we will have to carefully sprinkle 

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:09.300
 icing sugar 

00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:19.270
 I finish mixing it there 

00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:21.890
 about 20 minutes that I'm working 

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:23.780
 and we'll be able to put it in 

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:26.120
 film paper and let it rest 

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:27.860
 for 12 hours I'm going to put a 

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.190
 azim paper sheet at the bottom of my 

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:29.720
 mold 

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:31.700
 so if you do not find any papers 

00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:33.440
 azim do not panic you can also very 

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:37.000
 well simply greased your dish 

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:37.000
 before spreading the dough 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:44.030
 the most difficult thing is to take the 

00:01:41.870 --> 00:01:45.590
 paste in his mold what I do if 

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:46.850
 the field of a spoon I am 

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:49.040
 so proud to do my own 

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:50.570
 galisson that I forgot to give you 

00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:53.210
 the list of ingredients to make the 

00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:57.680
 icing to make a royal icing 

00:01:53.210 --> 00:02:03.590
 you will need icing sugar about 300 

00:01:57.680 --> 00:02:05.540
 g an egg white and will incite bah 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:07.910
 here we go 

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:09.500
 I mix the egg white with the sugar 

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:10.760
 ice cream and then I add a few 

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:12.800
 drops of lemon juice until 

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:14.690
 getting a perfect icing 

00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:18.400
 slightly lille the texture is 

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.400
 beautiful on mag.fr ca on the dough 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:27.879
 it's gone for ten minutes of cooking 

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:30.220
 at 100 Â° and then I was cooled 

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:31.959
 before cutting houses calissons 

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:34.239

00:02:31.959 --> 00:02:35.950
 me okay the icing fides again 

00:02:34.239 --> 00:02:39.480
 a little to be desired but frankly I

 have tasted they are delicious 

00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:47.110
