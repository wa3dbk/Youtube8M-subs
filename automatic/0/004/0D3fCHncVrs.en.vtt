00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.289 
the bottom piece in and actually you can
put<00:01:44.159> the<00:01:44.220> bottom<00:01:44.460> piece<00:01:44.610> in<00:01:44.759> and<00:01:44.880> then<00:01:45.000> the<00:01:45.119> top

00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:48.469 
piece or the top piece in the bottom
piece<00:01:46.590> it<00:01:46.710> doesn't<00:01:46.920> really<00:01:47.009> matter<00:01:47.189> so<00:01:47.970> you

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
piece it doesn't really matter so you

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:49.999 
piece it doesn't really matter so you
slide<00:01:48.780> the<00:01:48.930> bottom<00:01:49.170> piece<00:01:49.320> in<00:01:49.500> and<00:01:49.680> then

slide the bottom piece in and then

00:01:50.009 --> 00:01:52.310 
slide the bottom piece in and then
there's<00:01:50.220> this<00:01:50.340> little<00:01:50.610> hole<00:01:51.360> that<00:01:51.390> goes<00:01:51.720> under

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:52.320 
there's this little hole that goes under

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:55.609 
there's this little hole that goes under
the<00:01:52.530> circle<00:01:53.520> so<00:01:53.990> no<00:01:54.990> let<00:01:55.170> me<00:01:55.259> rephrase<00:01:55.409> that

00:01:55.609 --> 00:01:55.619 
the circle so no let me rephrase that

00:01:55.619 --> 00:01:56.630 
the circle so no let me rephrase that
there's<00:01:55.920> this<00:01:55.979> little<00:01:56.189> circle<00:01:56.399> that<00:01:56.579> goes

00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:56.640 
there's this little circle that goes

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.969 
there's this little circle that goes
under<00:01:56.969> the<00:01:57.000> whole<00:01:57.299> of<00:01:57.659> the<00:01:57.810> top<00:01:58.020> part<00:01:58.259> so<00:01:58.530> it

00:01:58.969 --> 00:01:58.979 
under the whole of the top part so it

00:01:58.979 --> 00:02:01.399 
under the whole of the top part so it
snaps<00:01:59.640> in<00:01:59.939> so<00:02:00.479> push<00:02:00.810> it<00:02:00.899> all<00:02:00.990> the<00:02:01.020> way<00:02:01.110> up<00:02:01.290> and

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409 
snaps in so push it all the way up and

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.260 
snaps in so push it all the way up and
then<00:02:01.500> snaps<00:02:02.130> in<00:02:02.340> alright<00:02:02.729> so<00:02:02.850> this<00:02:02.969> is<00:02:03.149> what

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:03.270 
then snaps in alright so this is what

00:02:03.270 --> 00:02:05.330 
then snaps in alright so this is what
the<00:02:03.390> actual<00:02:03.840> case<00:02:04.380> looks<00:02:04.710> like<00:02:04.920> with<00:02:05.159> the

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:05.340 
the actual case looks like with the

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.389 
the actual case looks like with the
iphone<00:02:05.670> 4<00:02:06.060> inside<00:02:06.630> it<00:02:06.930> adds<00:02:07.439> very<00:02:07.890> little<00:02:08.160> bulk
