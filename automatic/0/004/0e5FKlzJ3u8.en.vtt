my<00:02:26.739> mouse<00:02:26.980> cursor<00:02:27.010> kind<00:02:27.849> of<00:02:27.909> follows<00:02:28.599> me<00:02:28.720> there

00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:28.870 
my mouse cursor kind of follows me there

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:33.360 
my mouse cursor kind of follows me there

of<00:02:54.310> Media<00:02:54.790> Center<00:02:55.030> functional<00:02:55.510> I<00:02:55.629> think<00:02:56.250> go<00:02:57.250> to

00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:57.310 
of Media Center functional I think go to

00:02:57.310 --> 00:03:00.479 
of Media Center functional I think go to
your<00:02:57.459> picture<00:02:57.730> library<00:02:58.500> and<00:02:59.500> Media<00:03:00.250> Center

00:03:00.479 --> 00:03:00.489 
your picture library and Media Center

00:03:00.489 --> 00:03:04.649 
your picture library and Media Center
does<00:03:00.640> a<00:03:00.670> real<00:03:00.909> good<00:03:00.940> job<00:03:01.120> of<00:03:02.190> making<00:03:03.659> it

00:03:04.649 --> 00:03:04.659 
does a real good job of making it

00:03:04.659 --> 00:03:08.670 
does a real good job of making it
viewable<00:03:05.470> and<00:03:06.510> go<00:03:07.510> to<00:03:07.569> Miami<00:03:07.930> this<00:03:08.319> is<00:03:08.470> just<00:03:08.620> a

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:08.680 
viewable and go to Miami this is just a

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:16.500 
viewable and go to Miami this is just a
slideshow<00:03:09.069> we<00:03:09.190> made<00:03:09.370> so<00:03:13.620> you<00:03:14.620> can<00:03:15.329> look<00:03:16.329> look

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.510 
slideshow we made so you can look look

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:17.789 
slideshow we made so you can look look
at<00:03:16.599> your<00:03:16.629> pictures<00:03:17.019> here<00:03:17.260> you<00:03:17.590> can<00:03:17.709> actually

00:03:17.789 --> 00:03:17.799 
at your pictures here you can actually

00:03:17.799 --> 00:03:20.610 
at your pictures here you can actually
play<00:03:18.099> a<00:03:18.130> slideshow<00:03:18.370> that<00:03:18.669> will<00:03:19.230> go<00:03:20.230> through<00:03:20.260> it

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:20.620 
play a slideshow that will go through it

00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:24.449 
play a slideshow that will go through it
I<00:03:21.069> think<00:03:21.579> it's<00:03:21.700> a<00:03:21.989> nice<00:03:22.989> way<00:03:23.650> to<00:03:23.680> almost<00:03:24.310> kind

00:03:24.449 --> 00:03:24.459 
I think it's a nice way to almost kind

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:26.039 
I think it's a nice way to almost kind
of<00:03:24.489> have<00:03:24.549> a<00:03:24.669> digital<00:03:25.030> picture<00:03:25.329> frame<00:03:25.569> that<00:03:25.930> has

00:03:26.039 --> 00:03:26.049 
of have a digital picture frame that has

00:03:26.049 --> 00:03:31.050 
of have a digital picture frame that has
a<00:03:26.079> lot<00:03:26.349> more<00:03:27.359> capabilities<00:03:28.359> so<00:03:29.910> probably<00:03:30.910> will

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:31.060 
a lot more capabilities so probably will

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:32.580 
a lot more capabilities so probably will
keep<00:03:31.209> it<00:03:31.359> mostly<00:03:31.540> on<00:03:31.750> the<00:03:31.989> weather<00:03:32.200> because<00:03:32.500> I

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:32.590 
keep it mostly on the weather because I

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:35.280 
keep it mostly on the weather because I
think<00:03:32.829> it<00:03:32.950> makes<00:03:33.400> it<00:03:33.549> useful<00:03:33.730> and<00:03:34.209> then<00:03:34.959> when

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:35.290 
think it makes it useful and then when

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:36.629 
think it makes it useful and then when
you<00:03:35.379> have<00:03:35.500> your<00:03:35.889> entertaining<00:03:36.220> or<00:03:36.430> want<00:03:36.609> to

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:36.639 
you have your entertaining or want to

00:03:36.639 --> 00:03:40.680 
you have your entertaining or want to
listen<00:03:36.790> to<00:03:36.910> music<00:03:37.290> I<00:03:38.290> think<00:03:38.709> it<00:03:39.419> adds<00:03:40.419> a<00:03:40.540> real

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:40.690 
listen to music I think it adds a real

00:03:40.690 --> 00:03:44.189 
listen to music I think it adds a real
neat<00:03:40.840> way<00:03:40.989> to<00:03:41.639> add<00:03:42.639> all<00:03:42.940> that<00:03:43.060> to<00:03:43.239> it<00:03:43.329> so<00:03:43.480> cost

00:03:44.189 --> 00:03:44.199 
neat way to add all that to it so cost

00:03:44.199 --> 00:03:46.259 
neat way to add all that to it so cost
wise<00:03:44.470> you<00:03:45.370> have<00:03:45.430> to<00:03:45.609> have<00:03:45.699> another<00:03:45.879> computer

00:03:46.259 --> 00:03:46.269 
wise you have to have another computer

00:03:46.269 --> 00:03:49.939 
wise you have to have another computer
running<00:03:46.620> this<00:03:47.620> monitor<00:03:48.190> was<00:03:48.609> I<00:03:49.060> got<00:03:49.389> on<00:03:49.510> eBay

00:03:49.939 --> 00:03:49.949 
running this monitor was I got on eBay

00:03:49.949 --> 00:03:53.309 
running this monitor was I got on eBay
again<00:03:50.949> it's<00:03:51.099> a<00:03:51.280> megavision<00:03:51.959> it<00:03:52.959> says<00:03:53.139> on<00:03:53.230> the

look at a satellite in image of what's

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:34.740 
look at a satellite in image of what's
going<00:04:33.010> on<00:04:33.160> it's<00:04:33.790> pulling<00:04:34.240> this<00:04:34.360> basically

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:34.750 
going on it's pulling this basically

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:41.430 
going on it's pulling this basically
from<00:04:34.990> weather<00:04:35.170> calm<00:04:36.240> look<00:04:37.240> at<00:04:37.360> current<00:04:40.440> and

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:41.440 
from weather calm look at current and

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:43.140 
from weather calm look at current and
again<00:04:41.800> I<00:04:41.860> kind<00:04:42.040> of<00:04:42.070> keep<00:04:42.220> it<00:04:42.340> on<00:04:42.400> that<00:04:42.610> I<00:04:42.880> think

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:43.150 
again I kind of keep it on that I think

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:46.350 
again I kind of keep it on that I think
overview<00:04:43.840> mode<00:04:44.430> but<00:04:45.430> I<00:04:45.640> think<00:04:46.060> this<00:04:46.180> is<00:04:46.330> a

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:46.360 
overview mode but I think this is a

00:04:46.360 --> 00:04:48.870 
overview mode but I think this is a
really<00:04:46.600> cool<00:04:46.750> mod<00:04:46.990> I<00:04:47.320> had<00:04:47.890> to<00:04:48.010> miss<00:04:48.340> out<00:04:48.700> about

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:48.880 
really cool mod I had to miss out about

00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:51.930 
really cool mod I had to miss out about
mounting<00:04:49.300> it<00:04:49.390> in<00:04:49.540> the<00:04:49.660> wall<00:04:49.870> as<00:04:50.740> I<00:04:51.430> play<00:04:51.820> with

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:51.940 
mounting it in the wall as I play with

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:53.220 
mounting it in the wall as I play with
it<00:04:52.090> more<00:04:52.270> and<00:04:52.300> kind<00:04:52.870> of<00:04:52.960> like<00:04:53.110> the

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:53.230 
it more and kind of like the

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:57.630 
it more and kind of like the
functionality<00:04:53.770> being<00:04:53.980> on<00:04:54.190> a<00:04:55.650> couch<00:04:56.650> or<00:04:57.010> a

00:04:57.630 --> 00:04:57.640 
functionality being on a couch or a

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:00.420 
functionality being on a couch or a
coffee<00:04:58.300> table<00:04:58.630> next<00:04:58.780> to<00:04:58.870> the<00:04:58.930> couch<00:04:59.170> rather<00:04:59.500> I

00:05:00.420 --> 00:05:00.430 
coffee table next to the couch rather I

00:05:00.430 --> 00:05:03.480 
coffee table next to the couch rather I
think<00:05:00.670> it's<00:05:00.910> kind<00:05:01.090> of<00:05:01.120> a<00:05:01.210> neat<00:05:02.250> add-in<00:05:03.250> for<00:05:03.280> the

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:03.490 
think it's kind of a neat add-in for the

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:06.840 
think it's kind of a neat add-in for the
living<00:05:03.730> room<00:05:03.880> so<00:05:04.200> that<00:05:05.200> is<00:05:05.410> a<00:05:05.680> quick<00:05:06.610> way<00:05:06.820> to

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:06.850 
living room so that is a quick way to

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:11.400 
living room so that is a quick way to
make<00:05:07.360> your<00:05:08.170> own<00:05:08.320> touch<00:05:08.890> monitor
