00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.149
 hello to all welcome to mac forever 

00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:04.920
 today we will talk about the new 

00:00:03.149 --> 00:00:05.569
 sin city on the occasion of its release on 

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:09.090
 mac 

00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:11.759
 a city is made of skyscraper a 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:14.460
 city is made of car streets gives 

00:00:11.759 --> 00:00:17.490
 and two women a city and makes two 

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:20.520
 two mystery show cities 

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:25.080
 unexplained phenomena a city and makes 

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:27.060
 of all that a pretty cool city mock 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:28.710
 days ahead yeah sin city it's from the 

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:30.240
 shit and or thing it's true he did 

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.800
 not been very well criticized by the press 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.120
 in recent weeks is that it's 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:36.140
 really a troublesome element to buy 

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.140
 the game is what we will see 

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:42.710
 at the time it's totally crazy because 

00:00:41.059 --> 00:00:43.760
 that you took for yourself the goal of God 

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:45.649
 game is to build the biggest 

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:46.940
 possible with a mac of inhabitants as 

00:00:45.649 --> 00:00:49.129
 this after you eat increase the children 

00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:50.690
 secretly after you made yourself a max 

00:00:49.129 --> 00:00:51.859
 of money studies buy a fucking 

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:53.089
 Bahrain well often you had 

00:00:51.859 --> 00:00:54.710
 the impression of having redone the city of 

00:00:53.089 --> 00:00:56.600
 new york so obviously you have great 

00:00:54.710 --> 00:01:00.559
 proud of you except that it actually came 

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:01.940
 rather that so before the principle it's 

00:01:00.559 --> 00:01:03.649
 that you give me your land you poses 

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:05.390
 been routed electrical pylons and 

00:01:03.649 --> 00:01:07.159
 pipes and where once you 

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:10.399
 was ready to play and you have more 

00:01:07.159 --> 00:01:12.140
 spot trick and actually after 

00:01:10.399 --> 00:01:13.670
 to wait painfully the end of the month 

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:15.319
 to receive your and friends who need 

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:17.450
 of a small group with this little and 

00:01:15.319 --> 00:01:18.619
 mynhardt hope though created way be 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:20.149
 an additional road master if 

00:01:18.619 --> 00:01:23.600
 everything was fine for maybe sometimes 

00:01:20.149 --> 00:01:26.869
 even when the months were good lay the 

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:33.039
 detail that kills is just one to a small 

00:01:26.869 --> 00:01:34.670
 geraniums but that was before 

00:01:33.039 --> 00:01:37.069
 because before that was nice 

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:38.810
 especially to mold there in fact it's 

00:01:37.069 --> 00:01:40.610
 to have spent like two days doing 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:43.880
 sim card were little hills 

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:45.820
 loïc but small steps and who josé who 

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:50.659
 sings and writes 

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:54.670
 elodie waits until yesterday at niort 

00:01:50.659 --> 00:01:54.670
 please but that 

00:01:55.510 --> 00:01:59.650
 it was before now when you throw 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:01.810
 the game you arrive in a region 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:02.790
 absolutely huge genre as if you 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:05.380
 was a little more russia 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:07.450
 except that after bin when you realize that your 

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:08.440
 city it's a timer that's there it 

00:02:07.450 --> 00:02:10.479
 you have to play the genre three times 

00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:11.320
 to be able to see where it is actually 

00:02:10.479 --> 00:02:12.760
 they try to build several 

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:13.720
 cities in the same area and make them 

00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.920
 interact with each other 

00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:16.000
 knowing that every city can 

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:17.680
 specialize in a field in 

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:19.090
 particular it actually comes down to the end 

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:20.560
 to make a big island divided into 

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:21.640
 several neighborhoods where the fact is we 

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:23.140
 still want to focus on 

00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:25.180
 his city initially but the problem 

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:26.920
 it's like the mason super small bath 

00:02:25.180 --> 00:02:29.470
 an hour we all filled the blow 

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:33.190
 secret is densification instead 

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:35.050
 you spread him in that so that made 

00:02:33.190 --> 00:02:36.820
 see very quickly we realize that a 

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:37.120
 of entities of buildings dependent on the 

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:39.040
 road 

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.930
 so the more we will buy an expensive road 

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.220
 and more buildings condenses and 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:43.570
 how does it start apart aaron beat 

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:44.620
 built rotten roads and then a 

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:46.540
 time you filled your card was 

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:47.920
 your skin and a little guy there in the 

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:49.900
 packard corner that will tell you that actually 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.100
 must tiny replaced by friends 

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:53.110
 except that like all buildings are 

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:55.350
 connected to roads ben you have that a 

00:02:53.110 --> 00:02:55.350
 Only solution 

00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:01.460
 so now the roads she integrates 

00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:03.320
 as much the pipelines as 

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:04.550
 electricity what may seem a 

00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:05.960
 little bit confusing for the old ones 

00:03:04.550 --> 00:03:07.610
 players who liked to ask all their 

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:09.020
 little pilous at all in the end it's 

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:10.280
 still a lot of time saved by 

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:11.660
 against where we would have liked a little 

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:13.280
 more difficulty is in the management 

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:14.660
 of the budget because frankly I think 

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:15.230
 we can finish a game without touching the 

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:16.910
 programs 

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:18.650
 where you can leave your your friend for 

00:03:16.910 --> 00:03:20.960
 it goes pretty quietly then 

00:03:18.650 --> 00:03:26.680
 that before pariah does not like to repay 

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:26.680
 borrowing that they wait in car 

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:33.200
 for the really reveling thing in this 

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:35.360
 story is this fucking connection 

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:38.870
 mandatory then that's it really 

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:40.250
 really a big they justified the 

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:42.050
 online mode saying it was a game 

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:43.250
 100% multiplayer when in fact we 

00:03:42.050 --> 00:03:45.320
 know very well that it's mostly for 

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:46.700
 avoid mishaps and even their modes 

00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:48.380
 multiplayer it has a little phony in fact 

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:49.910
 because you can very well alone 

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:51.590
 when you see in multiplayer actually 

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:53.450
 you do not really interact with them 

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:54.770
 players and besides you do not even see this 

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:57.530
 that they claim from a villa of everything 

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:59.300
 good thing but really stupid it's 

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:01.790
 that no soccer management of 

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:03.019
 you can not even test something and 

00:04:01.790 --> 00:04:07.630
 then resume the game if you ever 

00:04:03.019 --> 00:04:07.630
 merlot and mayor of 

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:12.510
 resume the backup in addition to the beginning 

00:04:11.130 --> 00:04:13.980
 of the party who must choose a server 

00:04:12.510 --> 00:04:15.660
 on which to play and once you have 

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:16.950
 choose you can not change anymore so for 

00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:18.620
 a little bit that they are offline houplain 

00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:23.300
 morning farting eyes to cry 

00:04:18.620 --> 00:04:26.940
 I like the main axes a5 and already 

00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:28.350
 that she lost stuck there I had when 

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:29.820
 even a little mafia are you 

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:31.590
 will see by reading the test that the game is 

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:32.820
 still overall well done she 

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:34.380
 break news in sin city is that 

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:36.150
 you can improve buildings like 

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:37.950
 for example add classrooms 

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:39.840
 in his school or cells 

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:41.310
 in misleading cops that makes the game 

00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:41.640
 really more dynamic and that's very 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:43.350
 cool 

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:45.660
 the graphics are really well done 

00:04:43.350 --> 00:04:47.520
 and the interface is very convenient in addition 

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:48.960
 as we read all along the game you have 

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:50.160
 always something to do and you get to goal 

00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:52.110
 never since is rather cool 

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:53.280
 they have also improved the management of 

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:54.720
 resources that makes that you can by 

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:56.400
 example pick up your minerals at the bridge 

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:58.320
 oil and then trade with the 

00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:00.870
 other cities what makes the game or 

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:02.160
 really more interactive frankly 

00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:03.660
 for all the fans once you 

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:05.010
 will have forgotten your reflexes before you 

00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:07.140
 will see that the game is still great 

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:09.090
 cool and addicting elected for all who 

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:09.890
 have not tried yet it's time 

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:11.820
