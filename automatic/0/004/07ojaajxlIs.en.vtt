00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:29.230 
day of jobs for morning until night and

00:00:29.230 --> 00:00:32.070 
day of jobs for morning until night and

also getting rained on for an outdoor

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:34.500 
also getting rained on for an outdoor
party<00:00:32.410> so<00:00:33.309> I<00:00:33.340> think<00:00:33.640> they<00:00:33.910> held<00:00:34.120> up<00:00:34.270> really

00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:34.510 
party so I think they held up really

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:37.470 
party so I think they held up really
well<00:00:34.680> the<00:00:35.680> only<00:00:35.830> spot<00:00:36.309> that<00:00:36.340> smudge<00:00:36.879> was<00:00:37.239> this

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:37.480 
well the only spot that smudge was this

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:40.140 
well the only spot that smudge was this
right<00:00:37.809> here<00:00:38.050> and<00:00:38.440> that's<00:00:38.590> from<00:00:39.100> me<00:00:39.370> pushing<00:00:40.030> my

00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:40.150 
right here and that's from me pushing my

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:42.990 
right here and that's from me pushing my
hair<00:00:40.360> back<00:00:40.510> out<00:00:40.750> of<00:00:40.870> my<00:00:40.989> face<00:00:41.199> constantly<00:00:42.000> but

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:43.000 
hair back out of my face constantly but

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.430 
hair back out of my face constantly but
other<00:00:43.210> than<00:00:43.420> that<00:00:43.510> they<00:00:43.780> held<00:00:43.989> up<00:00:44.140> really<00:00:44.290> well

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:44.440 
other than that they held up really well

00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.320

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:34.840 
Amazon but the way I like to think about

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:37.530 
Amazon but the way I like to think about
the<00:02:35.230> pro<00:02:35.590> air<00:02:35.770> and<00:02:36.070> hybrid<00:02:36.610> products<00:02:37.000> are<00:02:37.300> the

the pro air and hybrid products are the

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:39.210 
the pro air and hybrid products are the
same<00:02:37.570> way<00:02:38.050> that<00:02:38.260> you<00:02:38.380> would<00:02:38.500> think<00:02:38.709> of<00:02:38.920> as

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:39.220 
same way that you would think of as

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:41.670 
same way that you would think of as
using<00:02:40.030> a<00:02:40.090> waterproof<00:02:40.660> mascara<00:02:40.900> there<00:02:41.560> are

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:41.680 
using a waterproof mascara there are

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.490 
using a waterproof mascara there are
some<00:02:41.950> occasions<00:02:42.520> that<00:02:43.270> you<00:02:43.840> know<00:02:44.020> you<00:02:44.080> need<00:02:44.380> to

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:44.500 
some occasions that you know you need to

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.380 
some occasions that you know you need to
use<00:02:44.680> a<00:02:44.709> waterproof<00:02:45.310> mascara<00:02:45.490> for<00:02:46.060> and<00:02:46.300> you

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:46.390 
use a waterproof mascara for and you

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:48.180 
use a waterproof mascara for and you
know<00:02:46.420> that<00:02:46.720> when<00:02:46.900> you<00:02:47.020> use<00:02:47.260> it<00:02:47.290> you're<00:02:48.040> going

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:48.190 
know that when you use it you're going

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:49.740 
know that when you use it you're going
to<00:02:48.280> have<00:02:48.430> to<00:02:48.580> use<00:02:48.850> a<00:02:48.880> different<00:02:49.300> type<00:02:49.720> of

00:02:49.740 --> 00:02:49.750 
to have to use a different type of

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:51.720 
to have to use a different type of
removal<00:02:50.410> method<00:02:50.770> to<00:02:50.890> get<00:02:51.070> it<00:02:51.190> off<00:02:51.340> but<00:02:51.610> it's

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:51.730 
removal method to get it off but it's

00:02:51.730 --> 00:02:53.520 
removal method to get it off but it's
worth<00:02:51.970> it<00:02:52.240> because<00:02:52.320> waterproof<00:02:53.320> mascara

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:53.530 
worth it because waterproof mascara

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:56.460 
worth it because waterproof mascara
doesn't<00:02:54.070> run<00:02:54.280> so<00:02:54.730> I<00:02:55.330> think<00:02:55.690> of<00:02:55.810> the<00:02:55.900> hybrid<00:02:56.320> and

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.470 
doesn't run so I think of the hybrid and

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:58.140 
doesn't run so I think of the hybrid and
premiere<00:02:56.800> products<00:02:57.160> the<00:02:57.310> same<00:02:57.519> way<00:02:57.760> there<00:02:58.120> are

00:02:58.140 --> 00:02:58.150 
premiere products the same way there are

00:02:58.150 --> 00:02:59.940 
premiere products the same way there are
reasons<00:02:58.660> that<00:02:58.750> you<00:02:58.959> would<00:02:59.170> really<00:02:59.380> want<00:02:59.530> to

00:02:59.940 --> 00:02:59.950 
reasons that you would really want to

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:02.370 
reasons that you would really want to
use<00:03:00.130> them<00:03:00.400> and<00:03:00.580> then<00:03:01.360> there's<00:03:01.720> easy<00:03:02.019> ways<00:03:02.350> to

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:02.380 
use them and then there's easy ways to

00:03:02.380 --> 00:03:05.310 
use them and then there's easy ways to
take<00:03:02.739> them<00:03:02.920> off<00:03:03.070> -<00:03:03.340> it's<00:03:03.640> no<00:03:03.820> big<00:03:04.090> deal<00:03:04.120> so<00:03:05.050> I

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:05.320 
take them off - it's no big deal so I

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:06.810 
take them off - it's no big deal so I
