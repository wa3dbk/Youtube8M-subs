00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:15.720 
mindful that these hoops all kind of

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.660 
mindful that these hoops all kind of
wobble<00:02:16.140> around<00:02:16.470> particularly<00:02:17.069> if<00:02:17.280> you<00:02:17.430> don't

00:02:17.660 --> 00:02:17.670 
wobble around particularly if you don't

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:19.940 
wobble around particularly if you don't
have<00:02:17.970> a<00:02:18.000> strong<00:02:18.360> grip<00:02:18.660> here<00:02:18.959> so<00:02:19.440> sometimes

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:19.950 
have a strong grip here so sometimes

00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:22.009 
have a strong grip here so sometimes
it's<00:02:20.190> just<00:02:20.280> the<00:02:20.519> little<00:02:20.610> push<00:02:21.209> forwards<00:02:21.840> and

00:02:22.009 --> 00:02:22.019 
it's just the little push forwards and

my<00:02:46.920> hand<00:02:47.250> is<00:02:47.459> totally<00:02:48.060> feeling<00:02:48.420> like<00:02:48.569> it's

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:48.690 
my hand is totally feeling like it's

00:02:48.690 --> 00:02:50.300 
my hand is totally feeling like it's
going<00:02:48.870> to<00:02:48.930> crap<00:02:49.170> up<00:02:49.380> and<00:02:49.560> my<00:02:49.799> hips<00:02:50.040> are<00:02:50.190> going

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:50.310 
going to crap up and my hips are going

00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:52.039 
going to crap up and my hips are going
to<00:02:50.400> swing<00:02:50.700> down<00:02:50.910> like<00:02:51.090> this<00:02:51.269> if<00:02:51.510> I<00:02:51.690> don't<00:02:51.870> do

00:02:52.039 --> 00:02:52.049 
to swing down like this if I don't do

00:02:52.049 --> 00:02:54.050 
to swing down like this if I don't do
something<00:02:52.230> quick<00:02:52.650> so<00:02:53.130> I'm<00:02:53.370> going<00:02:53.640> to<00:02:53.760> do<00:02:53.880> this

00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:54.060 
something quick so I'm going to do this

00:02:54.060 --> 00:02:56.300 
something quick so I'm going to do this
propeller<00:02:54.569> or<00:02:54.840> chopper<00:02:55.170> move<00:02:55.500> which<00:02:56.160> is

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:56.310 
propeller or chopper move which is

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:58.699 
propeller or chopper move which is
alternating<00:02:56.750> one<00:02:57.750> hand<00:02:58.140> and<00:02:58.440> then<00:02:58.560> the<00:02:58.680> other

00:02:58.699 --> 00:02:58.709 
alternating one hand and then the other

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:01.460 
alternating one hand and then the other
so<00:02:59.280> it<00:02:59.400> looks<00:02:59.670> like<00:02:59.760> this<00:03:00.420> my<00:03:00.930> thumb's<00:03:01.260> are

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470 
so it looks like this my thumb's are

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:02.780 
so it looks like this my thumb's are
together<00:03:01.739> then<00:03:01.950> my<00:03:02.069> pinkies<00:03:02.459> are<00:03:02.610> together

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:02.790 
together then my pinkies are together

00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:06.020 
together then my pinkies are together
and<00:03:03.349> I'm<00:03:04.349> going<00:03:04.860> to<00:03:04.890> propel<00:03:05.459> that<00:03:05.640> around

00:03:06.020 --> 00:03:06.030 
and I'm going to propel that around

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:09.680 
and I'm going to propel that around
above<00:03:06.660> my<00:03:06.959> head<00:03:07.200> now<00:03:07.739> this<00:03:08.130> is<00:03:08.400> definitely<00:03:09.359> one

00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:09.690 
above my head now this is definitely one

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:12.979 
above my head now this is definitely one
of<00:03:09.720> the<00:03:09.959> most<00:03:10.459> dizzy<00:03:11.459> making<00:03:11.910> moves<00:03:12.209> ever<00:03:12.540> if

00:03:12.979 --> 00:03:12.989 
of the most dizzy making moves ever if

00:03:12.989 --> 00:03:15.860 
of the most dizzy making moves ever if
you<00:03:13.350> turn<00:03:13.650> around<00:03:13.859> in<00:03:14.639> this<00:03:15.090> chopper<00:03:15.329> move<00:03:15.630> and

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:15.870 
you turn around in this chopper move and

00:03:15.870 --> 00:03:19.069 
you turn around in this chopper move and
you<00:03:16.230> look<00:03:16.440> up<00:03:16.739> you<00:03:17.370> will<00:03:17.549> likely<00:03:17.850> fall<00:03:18.660> over

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:19.079 
you look up you will likely fall over

00:03:19.079 --> 00:03:20.809 
you look up you will likely fall over
because<00:03:19.350> you'll<00:03:19.500> be<00:03:19.530> so<00:03:19.650> dizzy<00:03:20.310> so<00:03:20.519> I<00:03:20.549> just

00:03:20.809 --> 00:03:20.819 
because you'll be so dizzy so I just

00:03:20.819 --> 00:03:23.509 
because you'll be so dizzy so I just
like<00:03:20.940> to<00:03:21.060> do<00:03:21.180> a<00:03:21.209> few<00:03:21.630> of<00:03:21.780> these<00:03:21.989> and<00:03:22.650> you<00:03:23.340> don't

00:03:23.509 --> 00:03:23.519 
like to do a few of these and you don't

00:03:23.519 --> 00:03:26.000 
like to do a few of these and you don't
have<00:03:24.060> to<00:03:24.299> turn<00:03:24.510> if<00:03:24.900> you've<00:03:25.109> got<00:03:25.319> some<00:03:25.500> momentum

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.010 
have to turn if you've got some momentum

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:27.379 
have to turn if you've got some momentum
with<00:03:26.160> your<00:03:26.310> hands<00:03:26.579> and<00:03:26.760> you<00:03:26.850> feel<00:03:27.090> like<00:03:27.239> you've

00:03:27.379 --> 00:03:27.389 
with your hands and you feel like you've

00:03:27.389 --> 00:03:29.690 
with your hands and you feel like you've
got<00:03:27.569> a<00:03:27.600> secure<00:03:28.049> grip<00:03:28.350> and<00:03:28.650> it's<00:03:29.040> quite<00:03:29.310> fast

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:29.700 
got a secure grip and it's quite fast

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:32.720 
got a secure grip and it's quite fast
then<00:03:30.239> you<00:03:30.269> can<00:03:30.630> stand<00:03:31.019> still<00:03:31.500> then<00:03:32.220> from<00:03:32.549> this

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:32.730 
then you can stand still then from this

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:34.910 
then you can stand still then from this
chopper<00:03:33.030> move<00:03:33.329> I'm<00:03:33.690> going<00:03:34.049> to<00:03:34.170> choose<00:03:34.380> one

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:34.920 
chopper move I'm going to choose one

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.460 
chopper move I'm going to choose one
hoop<00:03:35.370> to<00:03:35.670> get<00:03:35.819> inside<00:03:36.510> of<00:03:36.540> and<00:03:36.959> that's<00:03:37.200> going

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470 
hoop to get inside of and that's going

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:39.319 
hoop to get inside of and that's going
to<00:03:37.590> be<00:03:37.709> my<00:03:37.889> waist<00:03:38.310> hooping<00:03:38.670> Boop

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:39.329 
to be my waist hooping Boop

00:03:39.329 --> 00:03:41.900 
to be my waist hooping Boop
so<00:03:39.750> as<00:03:39.959> loop<00:03:40.350> comes<00:03:40.620> into<00:03:40.950> my<00:03:41.100> left<00:03:41.579> hand

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:41.910 
so as loop comes into my left hand

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:43.550 
so as loop comes into my left hand
because<00:03:42.120> it's<00:03:42.389> going<00:03:42.569> around<00:03:42.959> to<00:03:43.170> the<00:03:43.200> left

00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:43.560 
because it's going around to the left

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:47.270 
because it's going around to the left
I'm<00:03:44.130> going<00:03:44.430> to<00:03:44.670> drop<00:03:44.940> my<00:03:45.780> left<00:03:45.989> hand<00:03:46.410> down<00:03:46.829> and

right<00:03:50.489> hand<00:03:50.880> to<00:03:51.060> support<00:03:51.630> because<00:03:51.900> I<00:03:52.230> spin<00:03:52.620> to

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:52.769 
right hand to support because I spin to

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:55.670 
right hand to support because I spin to
the<00:03:52.889> left<00:03:53.160> I'm<00:03:53.489> going<00:03:53.700> to<00:03:53.819> push<00:03:54.269> with<00:03:54.780> my<00:03:55.410> right

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:01.590 
here so I need to manipulate it so that

00:04:01.590 --> 00:04:04.490 
here so I need to manipulate it so that
I<00:04:01.769> can<00:04:02.010> take<00:04:02.280> it<00:04:02.489> up<00:04:02.639> into<00:04:02.940> the<00:04:03.180> air<00:04:03.389> and<00:04:03.750> notice
