using<00:00:56.910> CGI<00:01:00.140> older<00:01:01.140> versions<00:01:01.500> of<00:01:01.620> CGI<00:01:01.949> would

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:02.280 
using CGI older versions of CGI would

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:03.950 
using CGI older versions of CGI would
work<00:01:02.460> simply<00:01:02.820> by<00:01:02.969> starting<00:01:03.270> up<00:01:03.359> a<00:01:03.420> new<00:01:03.539> process

work simply by starting up a new process
every<00:01:04.320> time<00:01:04.470> a<00:01:04.500> request<00:01:04.890> had<00:01:05.070> come<00:01:05.250> in<00:01:05.430> and

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:05.640 
every time a request had come in and

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:07.880 
every time a request had come in and
then<00:01:06.420> after<00:01:06.659> a<00:01:06.689> web<00:01:06.900> response<00:01:07.260> was<00:01:07.470> delivered

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:07.890 
then after a web response was delivered

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:09.859 
then after a web response was delivered
it<00:01:08.549> would<00:01:08.700> then<00:01:08.820> close<00:01:09.060> off<00:01:09.240> that<00:01:09.270> process

00:01:09.859 --> 00:01:09.869 
it would then close off that process

00:01:09.869 --> 00:01:12.320 
it would then close off that process
this<00:01:10.650> works<00:01:11.070> but<00:01:11.700> it<00:01:11.790> has<00:01:11.820> quite<00:01:12.060> a<00:01:12.150> bit<00:01:12.299> of

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:12.330 
this works but it has quite a bit of

00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:15.920 
this works but it has quite a bit of
overhead<00:01:13.549> now<00:01:14.549> when<00:01:14.760> you<00:01:14.850> install<00:01:15.119> CGI<00:01:15.509> you

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:15.930 
overhead now when you install CGI you

00:01:15.930 --> 00:01:17.749 
overhead now when you install CGI you
still<00:01:16.200> get<00:01:16.350> this<00:01:16.530> behavior<00:01:16.710> but<00:01:17.490> as<00:01:17.580> well<00:01:17.729> a

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759 
still get this behavior but as well a

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.910 
still get this behavior but as well a
new<00:01:18.030> module<00:01:18.180> is<00:01:18.450> also<00:01:18.720> installed<00:01:18.930> called<00:01:19.650> fast

00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:19.920 
new module is also installed called fast

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.320 
new module is also installed called fast
cgi<00:01:21.740> fast<00:01:22.740> cgi<00:01:23.100> as<00:01:23.310> a<00:01:23.340> speedier<00:01:23.759> alternative

cgi fast cgi as a speedier alternative

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:26.300 
cgi fast cgi as a speedier alternative
in<00:01:24.570> which<00:01:25.020> the<00:01:25.140> program<00:01:25.320> is<00:01:25.560> started<00:01:25.799> once<00:01:26.009> and

in which the program is started once and

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.630 
in which the program is started once and
then<00:01:26.850> it<00:01:27.000> can<00:01:27.150> satisfy<00:01:27.299> multiple<00:01:28.020> requests

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:28.640 
then it can satisfy multiple requests

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:30.649 
then it can satisfy multiple requests
performance<00:01:29.640> is<00:01:29.790> then<00:01:29.939> much<00:01:30.150> better<00:01:30.390> in<00:01:30.540> this

00:01:30.649 --> 00:01:30.659 
performance is then much better in this

00:01:30.659 --> 00:01:33.469 
performance is then much better in this
way<00:01:31.189> now<00:01:32.189> that<00:01:32.220> we<00:01:32.430> have<00:01:32.549> CGI<00:01:32.970> installed<00:01:33.390> on
