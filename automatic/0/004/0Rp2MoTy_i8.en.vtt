hey YouTube my name is summer and today

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:05.840 
hey YouTube my name is summer and today
I'm<00:00:03.449> here<00:00:03.629> to<00:00:03.840> show<00:00:04.049> you<00:00:04.110> a<00:00:04.259> LCD<00:00:05.100> module<00:00:05.609> that<00:00:05.819> I

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:05.850 
I'm here to show you a LCD module that I

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:08.960 
I'm here to show you a LCD module that I
recently<00:00:06.600> brought<00:00:07.109> on<00:00:07.379> eBay<00:00:07.980> now<00:00:08.370> the<00:00:08.790> module

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:08.970 
recently brought on eBay now the module

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.690 
recently brought on eBay now the module
seems<00:00:09.360> to<00:00:09.540> have<00:00:09.750> very<00:00:10.559> few<00:00:10.830> components<00:00:11.280> and

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:11.700 
seems to have very few components and

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:13.400 
seems to have very few components and
this<00:00:11.940> is<00:00:12.120> the<00:00:12.210> primary<00:00:12.450> reason<00:00:12.900> why<00:00:13.110> I'm

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:13.410 
this is the primary reason why I'm

00:00:13.410 --> 00:00:15.919 
this is the primary reason why I'm
actually<00:00:13.950> putting<00:00:14.639> a<00:00:14.790> video<00:00:14.969> together<00:00:15.509> to

00:00:15.919 --> 00:00:15.929 
actually putting a video together to

00:00:15.929 --> 00:00:18.320 
actually putting a video together to
show<00:00:16.500> you<00:00:16.560> how<00:00:17.039> the<00:00:17.100> module<00:00:17.520> looks<00:00:17.699> and<00:00:18.060> what

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:18.330 
show you how the module looks and what

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.540 
show you how the module looks and what
are<00:00:18.390> the<00:00:18.539> components<00:00:18.770> so<00:00:19.770> without<00:00:20.189> wasting

00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:20.550 
are the components so without wasting

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:22.910 
are the components so without wasting
any<00:00:20.670> time<00:00:21.029> now<00:00:21.300> here<00:00:21.570> is<00:00:21.689> the<00:00:21.840> module<00:00:22.170> the

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:22.920 
any time now here is the module the

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:26.920 
any time now here is the module the
module<00:00:23.070> seems<00:00:23.490> to<00:00:23.789> be<00:00:23.970> a<00:00:25.250> very<00:00:26.250> small<00:00:26.519> size

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:26.930 
module seems to be a very small size

00:00:26.930 --> 00:00:30.380 
module seems to be a very small size
very<00:00:27.930> small<00:00:28.230> structure<00:00:28.800> if<00:00:29.130> you<00:00:29.580> see<00:00:30.060> or<00:00:30.330> if

00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:30.390 
very small structure if you see or if

00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:32.959 
very small structure if you see or if
you<00:00:30.720> compare<00:00:31.080> it<00:00:31.230> with<00:00:31.260> this<00:00:31.579> scale<00:00:32.579> you<00:00:32.820> will

00:00:32.959 --> 00:00:32.969 
you compare it with this scale you will

00:00:32.969 --> 00:00:35.930 
you compare it with this scale you will
see<00:00:33.210> it's<00:00:33.360> very<00:00:34.140> small<00:00:34.440> in<00:00:34.620> size<00:00:34.829> now<00:00:35.640> this

00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:35.940 
see it's very small in size now this

00:00:35.940 --> 00:00:39.619 
see it's very small in size now this
module<00:00:36.300> basically<00:00:36.750> has<00:00:37.020> a<00:00:37.350> small<00:00:38.190> LCD<00:00:38.629> nokia

00:00:39.619 --> 00:00:39.629 
module basically has a small LCD nokia

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:43.069 
module basically has a small LCD nokia
61.0<00:00:40.340> LCD<00:00:41.340> it<00:00:41.640> has<00:00:41.850> a<00:00:41.879> small<00:00:42.540> connector<00:00:42.870> which

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079 
61.0 LCD it has a small connector which

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:45.319 
61.0 LCD it has a small connector which
you<00:00:43.200> can<00:00:43.379> unplug<00:00:43.980> and<00:00:44.250> replug<00:00:44.489> in<00:00:44.940> case<00:00:45.120> your

00:00:45.319 --> 00:00:45.329 
you can unplug and replug in case your

00:00:45.329 --> 00:00:47.779 
you can unplug and replug in case your
you<00:00:45.809> waste<00:00:46.230> your<00:00:46.379> LCD<00:00:46.800> you<00:00:46.860> can<00:00:47.039> get<00:00:47.190> a<00:00:47.219> new<00:00:47.399> LCD

00:00:47.779 --> 00:00:47.789 
you waste your LCD you can get a new LCD

00:00:47.789 --> 00:00:49.490 
you waste your LCD you can get a new LCD
and<00:00:47.879> put<00:00:48.059> it<00:00:48.180> in<00:00:48.300> there<00:00:48.480> and<00:00:48.629> it<00:00:48.750> the<00:00:49.230> module

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:49.500 
and put it in there and it the module

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:52.520 
and put it in there and it the module
still<00:00:49.770> works<00:00:50.010> so<00:00:50.550> if<00:00:51.510> you<00:00:51.690> you<00:00:51.899> know<00:00:52.020> maybe

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:52.530 
still works so if you you know maybe

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:55.069 
still works so if you you know maybe
just<00:00:52.860> drop<00:00:53.520> the<00:00:53.760> LCD<00:00:54.090> or<00:00:54.120> you<00:00:54.510> break<00:00:54.719> it<00:00:54.930> or

00:00:55.069 --> 00:00:55.079 
just drop the LCD or you break it or

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:56.180 
just drop the LCD or you break it or
something<00:00:55.440> else<00:00:55.590> goes<00:00:55.829> wrong<00:00:56.039> you<00:00:56.160> can

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:56.190 
something else goes wrong you can

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:58.610 
something else goes wrong you can
basically<00:00:56.460> replace<00:00:57.000> the<00:00:57.149> LCD<00:00:57.300> the<00:00:57.750> module<00:00:58.469> is

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.620 
basically replace the LCD the module is

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.270 
basically replace the LCD the module is
nothing<00:00:58.890> but<00:00:59.010> a<00:00:59.070> simple<00:00:59.250> PCB<00:00:59.789> I<00:00:59.820> have<00:01:00.000> got

00:01:01.270 --> 00:01:01.280 
nothing but a simple PCB I have got

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:03.470 
nothing but a simple PCB I have got
incomplete<00:01:02.280> modules<00:01:02.699> here<00:01:02.940> I'll<00:01:03.090> just<00:01:03.120> show

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:03.480 
incomplete modules here I'll just show

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:05.750 
incomplete modules here I'll just show
you<00:01:03.510> what<00:01:04.260> the<00:01:04.350> money<00:01:04.470> looks<00:01:04.769> like<00:01:04.949> alright<00:01:05.519> so

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:05.760 
you what the money looks like alright so

00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:08.270 
you what the money looks like alright so
basically<00:01:06.170> this<00:01:07.170> is<00:01:07.229> the<00:01:07.470> entire<00:01:07.680> PCB<00:01:08.130> layout

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:08.280 
basically this is the entire PCB layout

00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:10.580 
basically this is the entire PCB layout
seems<00:01:09.090> to<00:01:09.270> have<00:01:09.420> a<00:01:09.570> couple<00:01:09.810> of<00:01:09.900> holes<00:01:10.110> in<00:01:10.320> here

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590 
seems to have a couple of holes in here

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.640 
seems to have a couple of holes in here
and<00:01:10.799> has<00:01:11.700> a<00:01:11.970> small<00:01:12.210> connector<00:01:12.689> it<00:01:13.140> seems<00:01:13.380> to<00:01:13.500> be

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650 
and has a small connector it seems to be

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.609 
and has a small connector it seems to be
a<00:01:13.680> five<00:01:14.100> off<00:01:14.460> in<00:01:14.760> left<00:01:15.150> and<00:01:15.509> a<00:01:15.900> 5<00:01:16.080> in<00:01:16.229> right

00:01:16.609 --> 00:01:16.619 
a five off in left and a 5 in right

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:18.590

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:21.730 
connector probably a 10 pin connector
maybe<00:01:18.810> I<00:01:18.869> can<00:01:19.020> just<00:01:19.110> show<00:01:19.380> you<00:01:20.270> alright

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:21.740 
maybe I can just show you alright

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:26.810 
maybe I can just show you alright
so<00:01:23.119> this<00:01:24.119> is<00:01:24.240> what<00:01:24.420> it<00:01:24.540> is<00:01:24.689> and<00:01:25.610> yep<00:01:26.610> it

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:26.820 
so this is what it is and yep it

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.810 
so this is what it is and yep it
supports<00:01:27.420> the<00:01:27.479> Nokia<00:01:27.780> 6:1<00:01:28.140> double<00:01:29.130> zero<00:01:29.310> LCD

supports the Nokia 6:1 double zero LCD

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:32.810 
supports the Nokia 6:1 double zero LCD
and<00:01:30.860> well<00:01:31.860> seems<00:01:32.130> to<00:01:32.250> have<00:01:32.369> a<00:01:32.400> very<00:01:32.640> few

00:01:32.810 --> 00:01:32.820 
and well seems to have a very few

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:33.980 
and well seems to have a very few
components<00:01:33.119> I'll<00:01:33.360> show<00:01:33.509> you<00:01:33.570> what<00:01:33.780> are<00:01:33.900> the

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:33.990 
components I'll show you what are the

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.870 
components I'll show you what are the
components<00:01:34.470> that<00:01:34.500> are<00:01:34.619> needed<00:01:34.799> to<00:01:35.009> get<00:01:35.670> this

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:35.880 
components that are needed to get this

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.179 
components that are needed to get this
module<00:01:36.450> to<00:01:36.509> work<00:01:36.840> so<00:01:37.170> that<00:01:37.500> way<00:01:37.740> you<00:01:37.799> will<00:01:37.979> save

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:38.189 
module to work so that way you will save

00:01:38.189 --> 00:01:39.620 
module to work so that way you will save
a<00:01:38.250> lot<00:01:38.460> of<00:01:38.490> time<00:01:38.790> and<00:01:39.090> money<00:01:39.240> when<00:01:39.479> you<00:01:39.600> are

00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:39.630 
a lot of time and money when you are

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.510 
a lot of time and money when you are
preparing<00:01:40.380> one<00:01:40.530> of<00:01:40.619> your<00:01:40.799> module<00:01:41.189> or<00:01:41.340> you<00:01:41.460> are

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:41.520 
preparing one of your module or you are

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.359 
preparing one of your module or you are
getting<00:01:41.700> it<00:01:41.909> on<00:01:42.150> eBay<00:01:42.509> so<00:01:43.470> this<00:01:44.159> module

00:01:44.359 --> 00:01:44.369 
getting it on eBay so this module

00:01:44.369 --> 00:01:48.469 
getting it on eBay so this module
basically<00:01:44.729> has<00:01:45.149> a<00:01:45.180> LCD<00:01:45.479> the<00:01:46.020> PCB<00:01:46.590> and<00:01:47.390> seems<00:01:48.390> to

00:01:48.469 --> 00:01:48.479 
basically has a LCD the PCB and seems to

00:01:48.479 --> 00:01:50.230 
basically has a LCD the PCB and seems to
have<00:01:48.600> just<00:01:48.780> two<00:01:48.930> components<00:01:49.290> one<00:01:49.649> is<00:01:49.890> a

00:01:50.230 --> 00:01:50.240 
have just two components one is a

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.850 
have just two components one is a
resistor<00:01:51.240> bed<00:01:51.420> of<00:01:51.570> 10k<00:01:52.049> so<00:01:52.110> basically<00:01:52.560> this<00:01:52.710> is

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:52.860 
resistor bed of 10k so basically this is

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:56.929 
resistor bed of 10k so basically this is
a<00:01:52.979> 10k<00:01:53.340> resistor<00:01:53.460> bed<00:01:53.880> and<00:01:54.890> l-e-d<00:01:55.890> so<00:01:56.610> now<00:01:56.880> the

00:01:56.929 --> 00:01:56.939 
a 10k resistor bed and l-e-d so now the

00:01:56.939 --> 00:01:59.209 
a 10k resistor bed and l-e-d so now the

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:16.970 
you voted on this register bed which
will<00:02:15.269> basically<00:02:15.540> drop<00:02:16.019> the<00:02:16.170> signal<00:02:16.560> voltage

00:02:16.970 --> 00:02:16.980 
will basically drop the signal voltage

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:19.250 
will basically drop the signal voltage
from<00:02:17.129> five<00:02:17.340> volt<00:02:17.580> to<00:02:17.849> three<00:02:18.030> volt<00:02:18.330> with<00:02:18.900> three

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:19.260 
from five volt to three volt with three

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.800 
from five volt to three volt with three
or<00:02:19.349> 3.3<00:02:19.950> volt<00:02:20.190> we<00:02:20.430> get<00:02:20.549> this<00:02:20.670> LCD<00:02:21.030> to<00:02:21.239> work<00:02:21.480> up

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:21.810 
or 3.3 volt we get this LCD to work up

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.580 
or 3.3 volt we get this LCD to work up
