00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:09.929
 hello everyone with you project ferrum com and i 

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.910
 Sergey mihailov today i will call you 

00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:14.849
 five reasons to give up 

00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:16.890
 from purchasing a new baked lg g3 

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:19.470
 the first reason is not to get uncle 

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:22.050
 from under the pillow the device is not you 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:24.869
 do not think it is assembled well and 

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:27.300
 looks quite impressive but the question of 

00:00:24.869 --> 00:00:30.179
 its practicality remains open 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.910
 scratch this plastic labor miracle 

00:00:30.179 --> 00:00:35.280
 will make for example a sample which we 

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:37.890
 have been visited for testing 

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:40.469
 our colleagues and already managed to get 

00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:42.450
 injuries of course people are neat 

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:45.180
 most likely will be this 

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.670
 treat this piece of plastic or 

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.329
 same cheat pouring it but the tenderness of it 

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:53.579
 polymer still causes some distrust 

00:00:50.329 --> 00:00:55.590
 the second reason is not the gg3 buyer wears 

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:58.079
 somewhat religious in nature 

00:00:55.590 --> 00:00:59.850
 current market trends are all 

00:00:58.079 --> 00:01:02.160
 more manufacturers 

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:04.559
 increase the display diagonal in their 

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:08.159
 flagship smartphones for example not 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:12.000
 little-known five-inch sgs4 outgrown 

00:01:08.159 --> 00:01:14.909
 5 1 inch sgs 5 47 inches 

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.580
 htc one m7 evolved into 

00:01:14.909 --> 00:01:19.530
 five inch van he is 8 but what 

00:01:17.580 --> 00:01:22.259
 it was necessary to make the poor fellows of 

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:24.689
 lg korean company 

00:01:22.259 --> 00:01:27.090
 trend you need to match here 

00:01:24.689 --> 00:01:30.509
 it turned out that the brand new jeep smartphone 

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:32.689
 got already 5 5 inch display that 

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.869
 a third of an inch more than his 

00:01:32.689 --> 00:01:36.350
 predecessor 

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:39.390
 the display itself is very cool 

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:42.030
 natural color rendering excellent angles 

00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:45.270
 reviews and quads where resolution 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:48.329
 but the question of the diagonal remains open 5 

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:50.610
 5 inches is not a hot-swell instead of you 

00:01:48.329 --> 00:01:53.250
 to put on the market cool 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.759
 smart lawyers have created very cool 

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.140
 phablet 

00:01:53.759 --> 00:01:59.050
 you will agree 5 5 inches 

00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:01.240
 shovel is no longer a smartphone to use 

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:04.750
 Such a device with one hand is not convenient 

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:06.790
 for example, I got the hand for a week but all 

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:09.399
 I also want to tell you that 

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:11.770
 manipulating a smartphone requires some 

00:02:09.399 --> 00:02:14.530
 acrobatics and border on concept 

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:17.650
 comfort of course someone will say 

00:02:14.530 --> 00:02:20.200
 and here I am accustomed Well I sincerely for 

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:22.500
 I am glad to remind you all the rest of the people 

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:25.360
 wisdom every toad its swamp 

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:27.940
 lauds the third reason not the best 

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:31.150
 way the working shell device 

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:34.780
 yes she has become more refined 

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:37.630
 yes she retained the functionality but how 

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:41.170
 it says there is one fucking but it 

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:42.519
 lags sometimes not quite smoothly scroll 

00:02:41.170 --> 00:02:45.250
 work tables 

00:02:42.519 --> 00:02:47.920
 and sometimes somehow reluctantly loaded from 

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:50.110
 box applications of course we 

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:52.450
 we hope for software fixes which 

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:55.030
 sure to come by air to this 

00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:57.220
 device the only question is when 

00:02:55.030 --> 00:02:59.650
 the fourth reason not to buy the most 

00:02:57.220 --> 00:03:02.530
 fresh smartphone from the g line from lg 

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:04.840
 the level of its autonomy to the device with 

00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:07.030
 enormous difficulty manages to live a little 

00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:09.430
 more than a day from his not small 

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:12.340
 3000 milliamp hour battery 

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:14.980
 All major competitors of the smartphone live 

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:17.230
 usually half a day more than that 

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:20.260
 principle can easily be called pleasant 

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:22.630
 bonus of no doubt upset 

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:25.480
 this fact that the predecessor of this 

00:03:22.630 --> 00:03:27.519
 gadget lg g2 was listed in rows 

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:29.320
 longevity he managed 

00:03:27.519 --> 00:03:31.810
 and two and a half days stretch from 

00:03:29.320 --> 00:03:33.610
 you will need a full battery 

00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:36.519
 hang out less in games and watch 

00:03:33.610 --> 00:03:38.560
 movies in high quality and the transfer 

00:03:36.519 --> 00:03:41.290
 data on the cellular network would be nice 

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:43.750
 turn off when you don't use the handset 

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:46.510
 the whole is logical but why then 

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:48.760
 buy final fifth reason 

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:50.730
 It will not be correctly perceived by all but 

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:52.160
 yet now on the Ukrainian market 

00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:55.550
 present 2 

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:58.670
 modifications lg g3 1 with three gigabytes 

00:03:55.550 --> 00:04:02.000
 RAM and 32 gigs to them 

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:04.130
 carrier 2 with two gigs of ram and 

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.820
 sixteen and hectares built 

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:07.090
 of memory 

00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:10.370
 processor regardless of modification 

00:04:07.090 --> 00:04:13.670
 will be the same quad 

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:16.910
 qualcomm snapdragon 801 with video i dron 

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:19.459
 adreno 330 but very soon 

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:23.090
 korean company promises to show 

00:04:19.459 --> 00:04:26.030
 color new creation g3 working under 

00:04:23.090 --> 00:04:29.960
 running 805 snapdragon a with video 

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:32.630
 adreno 420 accelerator 

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:35.090
 will be 3 gigabytes so why 

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:38.270
 buy this device if through 

00:04:35.090 --> 00:04:40.790
 some two maximum three months she already 

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:44.690
 will cease to be one hundred percent flagship 

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:47.240
 question question you heard 5 reasons not 

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:49.580
 gg3 buyer if you want to know 

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:51.980
 other view of mercy we ask in 

00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:54.350

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:56.720
 material dedicated to the strongest him in 

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:58.490

 testing the gadget link on the product in 

00:05:03.290 --> 00:05:06.290
