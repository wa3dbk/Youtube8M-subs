and<00:00:05.549> here's<00:00:05.819> another<00:00:05.970> tip<00:00:06.420> in<00:00:06.990> under<00:00:07.200> five

00:00:07.369 --> 00:00:07.379 
and here's another tip in under five

00:00:07.379 --> 00:00:09.770 
and here's another tip in under five
minutes<00:00:07.410> if<00:00:07.830> I<00:00:07.919> can<00:00:08.040> get<00:00:08.130> it<00:00:08.220> all<00:00:08.370> in<00:00:08.519> a<00:00:09.330> lot<00:00:09.750> of

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:09.780 
minutes if I can get it all in a lot of

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:12.049 
minutes if I can get it all in a lot of
people<00:00:10.110> in<00:00:10.230> there<00:00:10.349> start<00:00:10.590> brewing<00:00:10.910> they<00:00:11.910> get

00:00:12.049 --> 00:00:12.059 
people in there start brewing they get

00:00:12.059 --> 00:00:14.120 
people in there start brewing they get
very<00:00:12.240> confused<00:00:12.360> between<00:00:13.230> mashing<00:00:14.040> and

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:14.130 
very confused between mashing and

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.660 
very confused between mashing and
steeping<00:00:14.610> they're<00:00:15.240> two<00:00:15.389> different<00:00:15.599> processes

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:16.670 
steeping they're two different processes

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:21.859 
steeping they're two different processes
even<00:00:17.670> though<00:00:17.910> they're<00:00:18.060> similar<00:00:20.660> you're<00:00:21.660> both

00:00:21.859 --> 00:00:21.869 
even though they're similar you're both

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.259 
even though they're similar you're both
in<00:00:22.289> both<00:00:22.470> processes<00:00:23.130> you<00:00:23.310> soak<00:00:23.550> the<00:00:23.820> grain<00:00:24.029> in

00:00:24.259 --> 00:00:24.269 
in both processes you soak the grain in

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:27.560 
in both processes you soak the grain in
hot<00:00:24.420> water<00:00:25.279> that's<00:00:26.279> probably<00:00:26.609> a<00:00:26.670> given<00:00:26.970> in

00:00:27.560 --> 00:00:27.570 
hot water that's probably a given in

and now the mashing grains you would use

00:01:01.379 --> 00:01:02.840 
and now the mashing grains you would use
or<00:01:01.530> something<00:01:01.739> like<00:01:01.859> all<00:01:02.039> the<00:01:02.129> pale<00:01:02.340> malts<00:01:02.730> or

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:23.360 
like that the big difference though is

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:27.020 
like that the big difference though is
in<00:01:24.360> the<00:01:24.509> temperature<00:01:25.430> the<00:01:26.430> thickness<00:01:26.790> of<00:01:26.939> the

national steam mashing it's important to

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:38.480 
national steam mashing it's important to
get<00:01:35.939> the<00:01:36.060> right<00:01:36.090> mixture<00:01:37.079> between<00:01:38.009> your<00:01:38.310> water

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490 
get the right mixture between your water

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.760 
get the right mixture between your water
and<00:01:38.700> grain<00:01:38.880> it's<00:01:39.090> usually<00:01:39.210> about<00:01:39.570> two<00:01:40.439> to<00:01:40.590> four

with steeping

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:07.950 
with steeping
you<00:02:04.210> actually<00:02:04.390> want<00:02:04.720> a<00:02:04.750> lot<00:02:04.900> more<00:02:05.020> water<00:02:06.960> it

you actually want a lot more water it

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:10.670 
you actually want a lot more water it
can<00:02:08.110> be<00:02:08.229> like<00:02:08.440> 12<00:02:08.740> litres<00:02:09.190> to<00:02:09.220> a<00:02:09.369> kilo<00:02:09.759> for

dissolve the sugars out of the malt but

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:27.300 
dissolve the sugars out of the malt but
that's<00:02:26.590> all<00:02:26.739> that<00:02:26.860> matters

00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:27.310 
that's all that matters

and again as steeping only has to be 15

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:37.800 
and again as steeping only has to be 15
to<00:02:30.819> 30<00:02:31.060> minutes<00:02:33.630> maximum<00:02:35.130> and<00:02:36.130> so<00:02:36.630> it's<00:02:37.630> really

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:37.810 
to 30 minutes maximum and so it's really

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:39.660 
to 30 minutes maximum and so it's really
easy<00:02:37.959> whether<00:02:38.500> you're<00:02:38.650> sleeping<00:02:39.070> you<00:02:39.640> can

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:39.670 
easy whether you're sleeping you can

00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:41.970 
easy whether you're sleeping you can
start<00:02:40.060> with<00:02:40.500> lots<00:02:41.500> of<00:02:41.590> people<00:02:41.860> do<00:02:41.950> it

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:41.980 
start with lots of people do it

00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:45.330 
start with lots of people do it
different<00:02:42.340> ways<00:02:43.440> you<00:02:44.440> can<00:02:44.560> put<00:02:44.680> your<00:02:44.800> grain<00:02:45.010> in

00:02:45.330 --> 00:02:45.340 
different ways you can put your grain in

00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.790 
different ways you can put your grain in
your<00:02:45.820> water<00:02:46.000> on<00:02:46.180> your<00:02:46.300> stove<00:02:46.510> cold<00:02:46.900> and<00:02:47.650> it's

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:47.800 
your water on your stove cold and it's

00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:49.259 
your water on your stove cold and it's
just<00:02:48.160> slowly<00:02:48.400> they<00:02:48.670> do<00:02:48.730> that<00:02:48.880> put<00:02:49.060> it<00:02:49.150> on<00:02:49.180> a

00:02:49.259 --> 00:02:49.269 
just slowly they do that put it on a

00:02:49.269 --> 00:02:53.430 
just slowly they do that put it on a
very<00:02:49.420> low<00:02:49.600> temperature<00:02:49.840> and<00:02:51.390> as<00:02:52.390> it<00:02:53.260> just

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:53.440 
very low temperature and as it just

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.040 
very low temperature and as it just
before<00:02:53.620> it<00:02:53.830> gets<00:02:53.980> to<00:02:54.100> the<00:02:54.190> boil<00:02:54.600> or<00:02:55.600> keep<00:02:55.930> an

before it gets to the boil or keep an

00:02:56.050 --> 00:02:57.449 
before it gets to the boil or keep an
eye<00:02:56.170> on<00:02:56.200> it<00:02:56.380> before<00:02:56.620> it<00:02:56.709> gets<00:02:56.860> to<00:02:57.040> you<00:02:57.250> know<00:02:57.280> the

00:02:57.449 --> 00:02:57.459 
eye on it before it gets to you know the

00:02:57.459 --> 00:02:59.280 
eye on it before it gets to you know the
77<00:02:57.970> degrees<00:02:58.269> you<00:02:58.450> turn<00:02:58.660> it<00:02:58.780> off<00:02:58.900> and<00:02:59.140> usually

00:02:59.280 --> 00:02:59.290 
77 degrees you turn it off and usually

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:01.710 
77 degrees you turn it off and usually
in<00:02:59.650> that<00:02:59.800> 15<00:03:00.519> 20<00:03:00.760> minutes<00:03:01.000> time<00:03:01.180> you've<00:03:01.600> had

00:03:01.710 --> 00:03:01.720 
in that 15 20 minutes time you've had

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:05.610 
in that 15 20 minutes time you've had
give<00:03:01.900> it<00:03:01.989> a<00:03:02.050> few<00:03:02.200> stirs<00:03:02.410> that's<00:03:02.709> enough<00:03:04.500> but<00:03:05.500> as

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620 
give it a few stirs that's enough but as

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.479 
give it a few stirs that's enough but as
we<00:03:05.769> all<00:03:05.890> know<00:03:05.920> in<00:03:06.280> the<00:03:06.370> mesh<00:03:08.040> is<00:03:09.040> a<00:03:09.100> lot<00:03:09.370> more

00:03:09.479 --> 00:03:09.489 
we all know in the mesh is a lot more

00:03:09.489 --> 00:03:13.050 
we all know in the mesh is a lot more
important<00:03:11.160> you<00:03:12.160> can<00:03:12.310> still<00:03:12.519> be<00:03:12.670> a<00:03:12.700> few<00:03:12.940> degrees

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:13.060 
important you can still be a few degrees

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:14.370 
important you can still be a few degrees
either<00:03:13.450> side<00:03:13.570> without<00:03:13.989> there<00:03:14.170> having<00:03:14.200> to

either side without there having to

either side without there having to
worry<00:03:14.620> but<00:03:15.310> you<00:03:15.519> want<00:03:15.700> to<00:03:15.790> keep<00:03:15.910> it<00:03:16.120> around

00:03:16.319 --> 00:03:16.329 
worry but you want to keep it around

worry but you want to keep it around
that<00:03:16.690> temperature<00:03:17.230> you're<00:03:17.560> 65<00:03:18.010> degrees<00:03:18.400> or

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:18.610 
that temperature you're 65 degrees or

that temperature you're 65 degrees or
whatever<00:03:18.850> it<00:03:18.940> is<00:03:18.970> for<00:03:19.060> your<00:03:19.269> recipe<00:03:20.340> for

whatever it is for your recipe for

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:23.980 
around an hour and that's all it really

00:03:23.980 --> 00:03:28.470 
around an hour and that's all it really
is<00:03:26.250> steeping<00:03:27.250> is<00:03:27.340> nothing<00:03:27.610> to<00:03:27.700> worry<00:03:27.880> about<00:03:28.030> at

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:28.480 
is steeping is nothing to worry about at

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.840 
is steeping is nothing to worry about at
all<00:03:28.540> and<00:03:29.049> mashing<00:03:29.980> is<00:03:30.280> where<00:03:30.519> you<00:03:30.610> have<00:03:30.700> to

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:30.850 
all and mashing is where you have to

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:33.390 
all and mashing is where you have to
take<00:03:31.000> a<00:03:31.030> little<00:03:31.180> bit<00:03:31.390> more<00:03:31.600> care<00:03:32.370> anyway<00:03:33.370> I

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:33.400 
take a little bit more care anyway I

00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.440 
take a little bit more care anyway I
hope<00:03:33.579> that's<00:03:33.790> helped<00:03:33.970> somebody

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:35.450 
hope that's helped somebody
