00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:10.889
 and good morning to all the friends it is 

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:12.210
 danger 'I hope you are well 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:14.610
 we find ourselves today for a 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:17.190
 new presentation notes fiat 

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.080
 seizes 90 

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:21.990
 so it's a tractor that is in 6 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.420
 cylinders and that makes 100 horses here 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.830
 so for the motorization of this little 

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.300
 tractor you'll see he has 

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:30.240
 really a lot of options and its ranks 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.880
 an important thing he is really 

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.050
 nice tosh a perso I use it in 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.309
 my farm a little old school 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:37.530
 besides, I'd need you 

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:39.360
 present once this one in any case 

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:41.879
 here I did a quick tour of 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.350
 tractor which is rather nice task in 

00:00:41.879 --> 00:00:45.030
 outside view but i'm not going 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.770
 dwell on it because I'm going all 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.079
 right away show you the inside that 

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:50.879
 is really nice so we can 

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:52.649
 see that there is really no blurring 

00:00:50.879 --> 00:00:55.920
 the orders are really great 

00:00:52.649 --> 00:00:57.719
 done and it's frankly it's just 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:58.980
 awesome i will not say nice tosh because 

00:00:57.719 --> 00:01:01.770
 that you tell me that I nitro it so 

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:03.930
 I will say great it's great finally 

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.309
 so here's the inside that for me is 

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:07.710
 really really make the difference 

00:01:05.309 --> 00:01:10.080
 life we also have this one changes itself 

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:11.250
 no masses but hey it changes even 

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.979
 nothing at all in any case there are two 

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.970
 interiors otherwise for the options I 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:16.950
 show you that immediately 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:19.439
 then there the 5 key that activate everything 

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:21.509
 just the lights in the front 

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:23.759
 the x key as always on the back 

00:01:21.509 --> 00:01:26.189
 on the other hand, we are attacking things 

00:01:23.759 --> 00:01:27.960
 serious friends and friends it's gone 

00:01:26.189 --> 00:01:28.979
 so not even 4 is simply 

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:31.590
 twin wheels 

00:01:28.979 --> 00:01:35.100
 in five years we have others dare a 

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:39.000
 book so frankly it's even a 

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:41.850
 sacred tractors in a step of 6 we have everything 

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:47.280
 simply will pay them so the tires 

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:50.189
 cross months then do not like 7 

00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:54.090
 so we have the tires that are 

00:01:50.189 --> 00:01:56.369
 really very very hungry then do not like 

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:58.450
 no zero it does not work on 

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:00.789
 do not like nine we have 

00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:05.259
 we add a lift before that's all 

00:02:00.789 --> 00:02:07.570
 just then touch nine that's it 

00:02:05.259 --> 00:02:10.660
 it's nice enough a little m peas 

00:02:07.570 --> 00:02:12.790
 counterweight input that ranges from 0 to 150 

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:14.709
 kg it seems to me yes that's it so 150 kg 

00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:16.870
 for the maximum it can be nice task 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:19.120
 but perso I prefer to put them 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:21.069
 here's my counter myself myself 

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:23.860
 simply by adding a counter 

00:02:21.069 --> 00:02:27.180
 what I think is still better 

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:31.110
 we arrive at more than 150 kg easily 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:34.569
 this is for the options of this little fiat 

00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:36.970
 100-90 so a fiat agri that is 

00:02:34.569 --> 00:02:37.480
 really nice touch at the noise level 

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:38.769
 the same 

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:42.760
 frankly I like the sound it 

00:02:38.769 --> 00:02:45.470
 tractor there he is really great so 

00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:47.690
 as said does 100 horses 

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:48.920
 it's enough for a farm 

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:50.990
 a little old school 

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:52.400
 on the other hand if you really want to 

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:54.470
 performance is not a tractor that 

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:56.600
 I necessarily advise it is not everything 

00:02:54.470 --> 00:02:58.640
 young either but it is still great 

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:00.380
 nice I think that's if you have 

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:02.390
 enjoyed this video do not hesitate to 

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:04.040
 put a little thumb to the link of the 

00:03:02.390 --> 00:03:05.050
 tractor will be as always in the 

00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:07.010
 description 

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:08.360
 let go of the comments say 

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:09.740
 me what do you think of this little 

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:13.090
 tractor me I tell you next 

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:13.090
 it was benger by everyone
