00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:14.059
 and the benefits of payment 

00:00:16.009 --> 00:00:21.119
 Hello friends, I'm not in touch 

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:23.189
 and the project is glorifying god on guitar where we 

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:25.380
 parse Christian songs how to sing them 

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.929
 and play the guitar and today we will analyze 

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:31.170
 Milana's song 

00:00:26.929 --> 00:00:34.860
 which is called broken by grace as 

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:36.960
 I usually play mine right here then we 

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:41.090
 analyze what chords are like them 

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:44.539
 put and then the tricks of the game battle and 

00:00:41.090 --> 00:00:44.539
 brute force is possible 

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:49.210
 like mercy 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:59.040
 I will not save you with love and I love you 

00:01:00.010 --> 00:01:10.370

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:48.480
 then you go there asking for a saxophone 

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:49.830
 where the roots are played to understand the goal 

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:52.700
 denim 

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:52.700

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:08.110
 guitar if he has sex 

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:10.500
