00:02:00.149 --> 00:02:03.170 
one of the pieces and take your glue and
mine<00:02:00.960> did<00:02:01.170> a<00:02:01.200> little<00:02:01.439> brush<00:02:01.740> form<00:02:02.219> so<00:02:02.790> that

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.180 
mine did a little brush form so that

00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:05.929 
mine did a little brush form so that
makes<00:02:03.450> it<00:02:03.659> easier<00:02:04.049> and<00:02:04.860> just<00:02:04.920> brush<00:02:05.460> your<00:02:05.729> glue

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:05.939 
makes it easier and just brush your glue

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:09.350 
makes it easier and just brush your glue
right<00:02:06.450> along<00:02:06.960> there<00:02:07.680> so<00:02:08.039> that's<00:02:08.819> gonna<00:02:09.000> work<00:02:09.179> a

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:09.360 
right along there so that's gonna work a

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:10.790 
right along there so that's gonna work a
little<00:02:09.450> better<00:02:09.690> if<00:02:10.200> you<00:02:10.289> use

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:10.800 
little better if you use

00:02:10.800 --> 00:02:13.400 
little better if you use
but<00:02:11.100> like<00:02:11.220> I<00:02:11.370> said<00:02:11.430> for<00:02:11.880> the<00:02:11.940> tutorial<00:02:12.570> it's<00:02:13.290> a

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410 
but like I said for the tutorial it's a

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.350 
but like I said for the tutorial it's a
lot<00:02:13.560> easier<00:02:13.800> for<00:02:14.190> me<00:02:14.250> to<00:02:14.340> just<00:02:14.610> use<00:02:14.790> Krazy<00:02:15.060> Glue

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:15.360 
lot easier for me to just use Krazy Glue

00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:18.410 
lot easier for me to just use Krazy Glue
hmm<00:02:16.290> but<00:02:16.890> if<00:02:17.040> you<00:02:17.130> have<00:02:17.310> hot<00:02:17.550> glue<00:02:17.730> I<00:02:18.000> recommend

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:18.420 
hmm but if you have hot glue I recommend

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:19.850 
hmm but if you have hot glue I recommend
you<00:02:18.510> use<00:02:18.690> it<00:02:18.840> it's<00:02:18.990> just<00:02:19.140> a<00:02:19.230> lot<00:02:19.350> more<00:02:19.380> messy

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:19.860 
you use it it's just a lot more messy

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.390 
you use it it's just a lot more messy
and<00:02:19.890> you<00:02:20.370> should<00:02:20.520> be<00:02:20.610> careful<00:02:20.940> with<00:02:21.060> it<00:02:21.300> so

00:02:22.390 --> 00:02:22.400 
and you should be careful with it so

00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.320 
and you should be careful with it so
yeah<00:02:23.400> so<00:02:23.670> now<00:02:23.790> you<00:02:23.850> have<00:02:24.000> something<00:02:24.300> that

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:24.330 
yeah so now you have something that

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.530 
yeah so now you have something that
looks<00:02:24.600> like<00:02:24.830> this<00:02:25.830> and<00:02:26.820> it<00:02:27.000> doesn't<00:02:27.180> matter<00:02:27.360> if

00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:27.540 
looks like this and it doesn't matter if

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:29.720 
looks like this and it doesn't matter if
it's<00:02:27.660> not<00:02:27.690> like<00:02:27.960> perfectly<00:02:28.500> even<00:02:28.830> because<00:02:28.980> you

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:29.730 
it's not like perfectly even because you

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:31.670 
it's not like perfectly even because you
won't<00:02:29.850> be<00:02:30.000> able<00:02:30.030> to<00:02:30.240> see<00:02:30.360> it<00:02:30.480> now<00:02:30.690> take<00:02:31.530> your

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680 
won't be able to see it now take your

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.970 
won't be able to see it now take your
piece<00:02:31.800> of<00:02:31.830> felt<00:02:32.130> again<00:02:32.400> a<00:02:33.530> little<00:02:34.530> less<00:02:34.770> than

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:34.980 
piece of felt again a little less than

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:40.150 
piece of felt again a little less than
an<00:02:35.100> inch<00:02:35.370> wide<00:02:36.830> and<00:02:37.830> a<00:02:38.160> couple<00:02:38.340> inches<00:02:38.580> long

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:40.160 
an inch wide and a couple inches long

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.260 
an inch wide and a couple inches long
it's<00:02:41.160> always<00:02:41.430> better<00:02:41.610> if<00:02:41.730> you<00:02:41.820> cut<00:02:41.970> more<00:02:42.210> than

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:42.270 
it's always better if you cut more than

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:43.490 
it's always better if you cut more than
you<00:02:42.540> think<00:02:42.720> you<00:02:42.870> need<00:02:42.900> because<00:02:43.230> you<00:02:43.380> could

00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:43.500 
you think you need because you could

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:44.990 
you think you need because you could
always<00:02:43.650> cut<00:02:44.070> off<00:02:44.100> extra<00:02:44.490> but<00:02:44.730> you<00:02:44.790> could<00:02:44.910> never

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:45.000 
always cut off extra but you could never

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.060 
always cut off extra but you could never
add<00:02:45.330> extra<00:02:45.870> so<00:02:46.080> that's<00:02:46.560> what<00:02:46.680> I<00:02:46.770> always<00:02:46.890> think

00:02:47.060 --> 00:02:47.070 
add extra so that's what I always think

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:51.500 
add extra so that's what I always think
what<00:02:47.250> I'm<00:02:47.660> doing<00:02:48.660> crafty<00:02:49.320> sort<00:02:49.590> of<00:02:49.680> things<00:02:50.510> I'm
