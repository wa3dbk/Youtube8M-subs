quite like a work of art and the great
thing<00:01:15.090> I<00:01:15.360> think<00:01:15.750> about<00:01:16.110> that<00:01:16.500> brisket<00:01:17.009> is<00:01:17.280> that

00:01:17.510 --> 00:01:17.520 
thing I think about that brisket is that

00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:21.410 
thing I think about that brisket is that
it's<00:01:17.729> a<00:01:17.939> very<00:01:18.409> open<00:01:19.409> texture<00:01:20.250> and<00:01:20.640> quite<00:01:20.939> soft

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:21.420 
it's a very open texture and quite soft

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.969 
it's a very open texture and quite soft
as<00:01:21.750> opposed<00:01:22.229> to<00:01:22.799> the<00:01:24.200> steaks<00:01:25.200> that<00:01:25.500> you'd<00:01:25.740> get

00:01:25.969 --> 00:01:25.979 
as opposed to the steaks that you'd get

00:01:25.979 --> 00:01:28.190 
as opposed to the steaks that you'd get
from<00:01:26.220> the<00:01:26.430> rear<00:01:26.640> end<00:01:26.939> of<00:01:27.180> the<00:01:27.299> animal<00:01:27.810> from<00:01:27.990> the

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:28.200 
from the rear end of the animal from the

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:33.109 
from the rear end of the animal from the
loin<00:01:28.470> and<00:01:28.890> the<00:01:29.100> rump<00:01:29.509> and<00:01:30.509> of<00:01:31.079> course<00:01:31.409> I<00:01:32.220> don't

00:01:33.109 --> 00:01:33.119 
loin and the rump and of course I don't

00:01:33.119 --> 00:01:34.880 
loin and the rump and of course I don't
know<00:01:33.270> whether<00:01:33.479> I'm<00:01:33.780> typical<00:01:34.409> of<00:01:34.530> an<00:01:34.680> old

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:34.890

00:01:39.659 --> 00:01:41.990 
person but we've still got teeth but
there's<00:01:39.900> my<00:01:40.110> dentist<00:01:40.680> said<00:01:40.920> to<00:01:41.130> me<00:01:41.310> recently

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:42.000 
there's my dentist said to me recently

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.389

00:01:44.389 --> 00:01:44.399 
so yeah they're all right he said but

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:46.069 
so yeah they're all right he said but
they're<00:01:44.549> getting<00:01:44.880> a<00:01:44.939> bit<00:01:45.119> mathy

00:01:46.069 --> 00:01:46.079 
they're getting a bit mathy

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:50.780 
they're getting a bit mathy
and<00:01:46.350> he<00:01:46.530> said<00:01:46.829> so<00:01:48.409> we<00:01:49.409> must<00:01:49.920> have<00:01:50.430> something

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790 
and he said so we must have something

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.840 
and he said so we must have something
reasonably<00:01:51.689> soft<00:01:51.960> to<00:01:52.259> chew<00:01:52.290> and<00:01:52.979> of<00:01:53.549> course

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850 
reasonably soft to chew and of course

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:58.789 
reasonably soft to chew and of course
brisket<00:01:54.829> fulfills<00:01:55.829> for<00:01:56.159> that<00:01:57.350> condition<00:01:58.350> and

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799 
brisket fulfills for that condition and

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.370 
brisket fulfills for that condition and
so<00:01:58.979> I<00:01:59.009> love<00:01:59.549> it<00:01:59.700> it's<00:01:59.939> a<00:02:00.030> very<00:02:00.240> sweet<00:02:00.540> meat<00:02:01.020> it's

think<00:02:34.370> bit<00:02:34.970> more<00:02:35.299> of<00:02:35.480> that<00:02:35.510> off<00:02:37.450> an<00:02:38.450> onion

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:38.870 
think bit more of that off an onion

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:42.099 
think bit more of that off an onion
which<00:02:39.200> I'm<00:02:39.470> going<00:02:39.709> to<00:02:39.829> put<00:02:39.920> in<00:02:40.370> and<00:02:40.939> I'm<00:02:41.840> also

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:42.109 
which I'm going to put in and I'm also

00:02:42.109 --> 00:02:47.039 
which I'm going to put in and I'm also
going<00:02:42.590> to<00:02:42.709> use<00:02:43.010> a<00:02:43.040> Swede<00:02:45.280> that's<00:02:46.280> a<00:02:46.549> very

00:02:47.039 --> 00:02:47.049 
going to use a Swede that's a very

00:02:47.049 --> 00:02:51.849 
going to use a Swede that's a very
common<00:02:48.049> English<00:02:49.870> vegetable<00:02:50.870> I'm<00:02:51.319> only<00:02:51.560> going

00:02:51.849 --> 00:02:51.859 
common English vegetable I'm only going

00:02:51.859 --> 00:02:54.849 
common English vegetable I'm only going
to<00:02:51.950> use<00:02:52.040> half<00:02:52.670> of<00:02:53.000> it<00:02:53.239> and<00:02:53.510> I'm<00:02:54.049> going<00:02:54.349> to<00:02:54.470> try

00:02:54.849 --> 00:02:54.859 
to use half of it and I'm going to try

00:02:54.859 --> 00:03:00.390 
to use half of it and I'm going to try
to<00:02:54.889> cut<00:02:55.489> it<00:02:55.519> up<00:02:55.849> into<00:02:57.370> what<00:02:58.370> small<00:02:58.790> tubes

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:00.400 
to cut it up into what small tubes

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.550 
to cut it up into what small tubes
this<00:03:01.400> is<00:03:01.639> geriatric<00:03:02.569> cooking<00:03:03.049> so<00:03:03.319> they're

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:03.560 
this is geriatric cooking so they're

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.819 
this is geriatric cooking so they're
probably<00:03:03.920> just<00:03:04.400> finished<00:03:04.909> up<00:03:05.060> to<00:03:05.269> be

00:03:05.819 --> 00:03:05.829 
probably just finished up to be

00:03:05.829 --> 00:03:09.720 
probably just finished up to be
bite-sized<00:03:06.829> the<00:03:07.159> lumps<00:03:07.579> I<00:03:07.760> suppose<00:03:08.389> but

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:09.730 
bite-sized the lumps I suppose but

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:16.569 
bite-sized the lumps I suppose but
that's<00:03:10.730> fine<00:03:12.489> so<00:03:14.230> we'll<00:03:15.230> see<00:03:15.650> what<00:03:15.889> we<00:03:15.920> can<00:03:16.310> do

00:03:16.569 --> 00:03:16.579 
that's fine so we'll see what we can do

00:03:16.579 --> 00:03:20.710 
that's fine so we'll see what we can do
with<00:03:16.849> those<00:03:17.859> it's<00:03:18.859> pretty<00:03:19.250> tough<00:03:19.639> and<00:03:20.030> of

00:03:20.710 --> 00:03:20.720 
with those it's pretty tough and of

00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:22.449 
with those it's pretty tough and of
course<00:03:21.079> the<00:03:21.319> vegetables<00:03:21.949> will<00:03:22.190> take

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:22.459 
course the vegetables will take

00:03:22.459 --> 00:03:28.300 
course the vegetables will take
different<00:03:23.000> times<00:03:23.329> to<00:03:23.540> cook<00:03:24.139> so<00:03:24.650> I<00:03:25.180> will<00:03:26.180> I<00:03:27.310> will

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:28.310 
different times to cook so I will I will

00:03:28.310 --> 00:03:30.069 
different times to cook so I will I will
have<00:03:28.579> a<00:03:28.609> look<00:03:28.909> at<00:03:29.060> that<00:03:29.239> when<00:03:29.419> it's<00:03:29.599> cooking

00:03:30.069 --> 00:03:30.079 
have a look at that when it's cooking

00:03:30.079 --> 00:03:32.589 
have a look at that when it's cooking
but<00:03:30.590> every<00:03:31.069> half<00:03:31.310> an<00:03:31.549> hour<00:03:31.699> to<00:03:32.060> judge<00:03:32.329> the

00:03:32.589 --> 00:03:32.599 
but every half an hour to judge the

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:36.759 
but every half an hour to judge the
state<00:03:32.930> of<00:03:33.169> the<00:03:33.290> vegetables<00:03:34.099> and<00:03:34.659> I<00:03:35.659> don't<00:03:36.500> want

00:03:36.759 --> 00:03:36.769 
state of the vegetables and I don't want

00:03:36.769 --> 00:03:39.610 
state of the vegetables and I don't want
them<00:03:37.010> to<00:03:37.159> cook<00:03:37.370> too<00:03:37.760> long<00:03:38.060> I<00:03:38.510> don't<00:03:38.959> want<00:03:39.440> them

00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:39.620 
them to cook too long I don't want them

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:44.469 
them to cook too long I don't want them
to<00:03:39.769> go<00:03:39.949> mushy<00:03:40.310> so<00:03:41.409> time<00:03:42.409> of<00:03:42.440> cooking<00:03:42.979> I<00:03:43.459> have<00:03:44.180> no

00:03:44.469 --> 00:03:44.479 
to go mushy so time of cooking I have no

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:45.460 
to go mushy so time of cooking I have no
idea

00:03:45.460 --> 00:03:45.470 
idea

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:50.740 
idea
this<00:03:46.010> is<00:03:46.220> geriatric<00:03:47.209> cooking<00:03:47.750> and<00:03:49.209> but<00:03:50.209> slow

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:50.750 
this is geriatric cooking and but slow

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:53.140 
this is geriatric cooking and but slow
and<00:03:51.229> low<00:03:51.590> is<00:03:52.069> the<00:03:52.099> answer

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:53.150 
and low is the answer

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:56.979 
and low is the answer
a<00:03:53.349> stew<00:03:54.349> that<00:03:54.680> boils<00:03:55.250> as<00:03:55.549> a<00:03:55.579> stew<00:03:56.000> that<00:03:56.329> spoils

00:03:56.979 --> 00:03:56.989 
a stew that boils as a stew that spoils

00:03:56.989 --> 00:04:04.960 
a stew that boils as a stew that spoils
so<00:03:57.290> they<00:03:57.500> say<00:03:57.829> so<00:04:03.129> doesn't<00:04:04.129> pair<00:04:04.370> with<00:04:04.609> me<00:04:04.790> by

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:04.970 
so they say so doesn't pair with me by

00:04:04.970 --> 00:04:09.819 
so they say so doesn't pair with me by
like<00:04:05.180> I<00:04:05.510> am<00:04:06.349> just<00:04:07.389> try<00:04:08.389> not<00:04:08.419> to<00:04:08.690> cut<00:04:09.109> my<00:04:09.290> fingers

00:04:09.819 --> 00:04:09.829

oh yeah
no<00:04:16.730> I<00:04:16.760> doesn't<00:04:17.239> anything<00:04:18.310> anyway<00:04:19.310> less<00:04:19.580> that

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:19.850 
no I doesn't anything anyway less that

will<00:05:38.990> have<00:05:39.200> a<00:05:39.230> look<00:05:39.500> at<00:05:39.740> it<00:05:39.980> from<00:05:40.550> time<00:05:40.880> to<00:05:41.210> time

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:41.590 
will have a look at it from time to time

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:46.810 
will have a look at it from time to time
the<00:05:42.590> other<00:05:42.800> half<00:05:43.310> of<00:05:43.640> the<00:05:44.350> Swede<00:05:45.380> I<00:05:45.650> will<00:05:46.490> save

and I can't be bothered to keep
readjusting<00:06:11.840> the<00:06:12.470> camera<00:06:12.980> so<00:06:14.380> I'll<00:06:15.380> let<00:06:15.620> you

readjusting the camera so I'll let you

the<00:06:25.360> Swede<00:06:25.720> is<00:06:25.960> possibly<00:06:26.500> a<00:06:26.620> little

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:27.100 
the Swede is possibly a little

00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:30.120 
the Swede is possibly a little
overcooked<00:06:27.580> so<00:06:28.199> possibly<00:06:29.199> I<00:06:29.230> would<00:06:29.470> put<00:06:29.919> that

00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:30.130 
overcooked so possibly I would put that

00:06:30.130 --> 00:06:33.659 
overcooked so possibly I would put that
in<00:06:30.190> halfway<00:06:31.060> through<00:06:31.660> the<00:06:31.870> cooking<00:06:32.080> time<00:06:32.740> but

00:06:33.659 --> 00:06:33.669 
in halfway through the cooking time but

00:06:33.669 --> 00:06:36.300 
in halfway through the cooking time but
the<00:06:33.940> meat<00:06:34.120> is<00:06:34.229> delightfully<00:06:35.229> tender<00:06:35.740> and<00:06:35.979> I'm

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:36.310 
the meat is delightfully tender and I'm

00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:40.590 
the meat is delightfully tender and I'm
sure<00:06:36.580> that<00:06:36.820> will<00:06:37.000> be<00:06:37.030> a<00:06:37.210> very<00:06:37.690> very<00:06:37.900> nice<00:06:38.199> meal
