00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.060
 psychotropic drugs become the best weapons of modern psychiatry 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.560
 but are they as harmless we would like us to believe 

00:00:19.499 --> 00:00:21.580
 international control bodies 

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:23.439
 as invited to summarize that 

00:00:23.439 --> 00:00:26.569
 requires that it be proven that before being placed on the market 

00:00:26.569 --> 00:00:29.569
 a drug is effective and safe 

00:00:30.069 --> 00:00:32.949
 pharmaceutical companies must therefore undertake clinical trials 

00:00:32.949 --> 00:00:37.320
 rigorous to demonstrate efficacy harmlessness treatment 

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.360
 before marketing them 

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.360
 at least that's how things should happen 

00:00:42.980 --> 00:00:46.120
 despite the polish that psychiatrists and pharmaceutical companies do not 

00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:49.660
 passes to public relations the idea that psychotropic cents 

00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:53.060
 offensive and far from true there are many reasons for this 

00:00:54.130 --> 00:00:57.170
 to begin most of the tests are done by laboratories 

00:00:57.170 --> 00:01:00.790
 pharmaceutical companies and not by government agencies or 

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:04.300
 private laboratories obviously creating a conflict of interest 

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:10.930
 v you have to find out to unlock a yes those who mourn this will overwhelm apple fumel 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:13.320
 and the pieces that lifted single track 

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.120
 week and then we were the most extreme exaggeration for payment in 

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.070
 actions ps 

00:01:19.070 --> 00:01:22.750
 the first step of the barter trimming approval process is to 

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:26.370
 find a disorder in the diagnostic and statistical manual and she 

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:29.010
 attached to drugs 

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:32.930
 clinical trials are then performed on animals and then on 

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:34.470
 humans 

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:37.560
 if psychotropic past stage performed on humans 

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:41.380
 the procedure following their four phases in the first 

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:44.490
 it is tested on a small number of healthy young volunteers 

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:49.390
 this phase aims to determine the side effects of psycho the rope and 

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:52.590
 to see it's not too toxic 

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.390
 wesa canadian soldiers 

00:01:55.390 --> 00:01:59.060
 even to the point of being there will not lose them granted to the express and 

00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:02.030
 the impartial is that agrees with the parents 

00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:06.560
 belga she suggests by the uefa was blamed for not doing them 

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:09.559
 the strong head 2 

00:02:09.559 --> 00:02:12.809
 tbh with the accessory is earth caffeine is not just a green salad 

00:02:14.229 --> 00:02:17.549
 in the second phase the scar researchers who determines whether the site 

00:02:17.549 --> 00:02:20.589
 clean and the expected effects in the body and the amount that can 

00:02:20.589 --> 00:02:23.889
 to be saved before they become toxic 

00:02:23.889 --> 00:02:27.329
 as in the first phase most subjects are young volunteers 

00:02:27.329 --> 00:02:30.429
 in good health 

00:02:30.429 --> 00:02:33.230
 sabia which is contrary to accra to ghana 

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:38.160
 adopt a month a mail will meyer a doctor before the aftereffects of 

00:02:38.159 --> 00:02:40.569
 the accident m 

00:02:40.569 --> 00:02:44.069
 in the third place we also talk about springboard to a placebo 

00:02:45.039 --> 00:02:48.559
 although testing them in phase 3 is done on a broader basis than in 

00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:50.509
 the first two normally 

00:02:50.509 --> 00:02:52.669
 they are only done on a thousand patients 

00:02:52.669 --> 00:02:56.509
 and extends only over a period of four to eight weeks which does not give 

00:02:56.509 --> 00:02:59.509
 no time to determine long-term harmful effects 

00:03:01.109 --> 00:03:04.809
 today clinical research and for-profit industry in 

00:03:04.809 --> 00:03:07.810
 which and pharmaceutical labs and hiring etiquette to do 

00:03:07.809 --> 00:03:10.869
 this research supervised every detail 

00:03:10.869 --> 00:03:14.539
 product design analyzes data if study publication 

00:03:16.439 --> 00:03:17.909
 but during the tests 

00:03:17.909 --> 00:03:20.589
 psychiatrists face a problem that the rest of the profession 

00:03:20.589 --> 00:03:22.179
 medical does not 

00:03:22.179 --> 00:03:25.849
 the absence of laboratory tests that could objectively measure a 

00:03:25.849 --> 00:03:27.609
 improvement 

00:03:27.609 --> 00:03:31.149
 to be a contract yet it is rare that he is old 

00:03:31.149 --> 00:03:34.579
 for what's the point 

00:03:34.579 --> 00:03:38.959
 he knows it's simple need the user is with the 

00:03:38.959 --> 00:03:39.599
 stars 

00:03:39.599 --> 00:03:41.369
 I think I know where the money is 

00:03:41.369 --> 00:03:46.419
 for the team of France carpenter using according to international law 

00:03:46.419 --> 00:03:47.480
 do his accounts 

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:49.449
 6 behind that 

00:03:49.449 --> 00:03:52.569
 many of you appreciate our customers after choosing 

00:03:52.569 --> 00:03:55.909
 it is this lack of silence that gives researchers many written 

00:03:55.909 --> 00:03:58.839
 opportunities to falsify clinical trial results 

00:03:58.839 --> 00:04:00.049
 and make them lean 

00:04:00.049 --> 00:04:02.489
 in favor of the pharmaceutical firm 

00:04:02.489 --> 00:04:05.509
 we have the right can not rank clash it's also the right way 

00:04:06.229 --> 00:04:11.189
 does she see of spirit it had been done to protect our borders this is the 

00:04:11.189 --> 00:04:14.609
 better even the wise the question the range 

00:04:15.329 --> 00:04:18.930
 she did that too but for him what is needed for who for what 

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:21.370
 a controversy has settled 

00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:24.169
 thanks to this agreement last week 

00:04:24.169 --> 00:04:28.490
 m of all these evils she hangs out at home on reflection but the factor 

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:31.650
 worsening the technicians would not explain all the same 

00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:36.279
 she is indeed greenhouse areva this incident did 

00:04:37.129 --> 00:04:40.129
 yes or no and on what date what can not happen 

00:04:40.809 --> 00:04:44.579
 another trick is to give the subjects the psychotropic before the 

00:04:44.579 --> 00:04:45.879
 caennais place 

00:04:45.879 --> 00:04:47.740
 then we still know it 

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:50.749
 so the canton gives him back these psychotropic drugs during the test 

00:04:50.749 --> 00:04:53.749
 it is the patient is more lacking and therefore gives better results 

00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:57.349
 or if we gave a placebo he continued to feel less well 

00:04:58.389 --> 00:05:02.479
 for example the psychiatrist Richard in the attempt to deprive schizophrenics 

00:05:02.479 --> 00:05:06.499
 of psycho 30 halle dole in order to actively generate a psychosis she 

00:05:06.499 --> 00:05:09.379
 make the hike then during the test 

00:05:09.379 --> 00:05:10.360
 However 

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:13.360
 his team is always quoted in the psychiatric documentation 

00:05:14.629 --> 00:05:16.199
 going from April to Beijing 

00:05:16.199 --> 00:05:17.820
 it is true that I like it 

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:21.280
 hamon is disappointed young people so later wages 

00:05:21.809 --> 00:05:22.990
 we went 

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:24.569
 by oil 

00:05:24.569 --> 00:05:26.580
 thereafter the points 

00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:28.360
 wedding 

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:29.969
 it's a victory 

00:05:29.969 --> 00:05:33.580
 the woman can settle on the podium at the party then 

00:05:33.580 --> 00:05:37.560
 the future is going to be a little cure it is not the simplest 

00:05:38.529 --> 00:05:39.689
 we know it 

00:05:39.689 --> 00:05:42.770
 and it's quite stable on the club at the end of the season 

00:05:44.379 --> 00:05:47.369
 one of the most common ways to influence the outcome of a test 

00:05:47.369 --> 00:05:47.889
 clinical 

00:05:47.889 --> 00:05:51.270
 consists of not taking into account patients who dropped protocol in 

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:51.870
 course 

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:54.839
 because of side effects 

00:05:54.839 --> 00:05:58.359
 actually in clinical trials the artistic title so close that it 

00:05:59.150 --> 00:06:02.160
 two-thirds of the 2500 participants suffered from side-effect time 

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:03.169
 harmful 

00:06:03.169 --> 00:06:05.009
 they had to give up 

00:06:05.009 --> 00:06:06.569
 800 restaurants 

00:06:06.569 --> 00:06:09.569
 22% to bring serious reactions opposite 

00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:14.499
 and during the tests that led to the approval of the prozac 

00:06:14.499 --> 00:06:18.320
 about 6000 patients tested only 286 

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:19.699
 less than 3% 

00:06:19.699 --> 00:06:22.819
 they stayed until the end of the short test period of four to six 

00:06:22.819 --> 00:06:24.419
 weeks 

00:06:24.419 --> 00:06:27.650
 another common practice is to hide the harmful side effects 

00:06:28.229 --> 00:06:31.289
 administering other drugs that are not part of the team 

00:06:31.289 --> 00:06:32.349
 course 

00:06:32.349 --> 00:06:34.300
 other researchers count between them 

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:37.699
 it simply falsifies studies undertaken 

00:06:37.699 --> 00:06:41.599
 take for example the psychiatrist faro crabos to flap former president of the 

00:06:41.599 --> 00:06:44.599
 Ethics Committee of the Minnesota Scars Society 

00:06:45.729 --> 00:06:49.190
 a patient who had recruited her for her clinical trials had reported 

00:06:49.189 --> 00:06:51.349
 that she had cravings for suicide 

00:06:51.349 --> 00:06:55.279
 in his reports nevertheless he does not mention any adverse reaction 

00:06:56.759 --> 00:06:57.969
 in two days later 

00:06:57.969 --> 00:07:00.969
 she killed herself by jumping off a bridge 

00:07:02.909 --> 00:07:03.559
 for spade
