calm<00:00:03.879> this<00:00:04.180> is<00:00:04.330> a<00:00:04.359> guitar<00:00:04.690> lesson<00:00:05.230> in<00:00:05.740> our

00:00:05.849 --> 00:00:05.859 
calm this is a guitar lesson in our

00:00:05.859 --> 00:00:08.879 
calm this is a guitar lesson in our
rhythm<00:00:06.370> and<00:00:06.580> strumming<00:00:07.299> kind<00:00:08.230> of<00:00:08.320> a<00:00:08.410> series

00:00:08.879 --> 00:00:08.889 
rhythm and strumming kind of a series

00:00:08.889 --> 00:00:10.830 
rhythm and strumming kind of a series
this<00:00:09.340> is<00:00:09.400> going<00:00:09.699> to<00:00:09.760> be<00:00:09.940> real<00:00:10.180> quick<00:00:10.449> it's<00:00:10.690> not

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:10.840 
this is going to be real quick it's not

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:12.990 
this is going to be real quick it's not
so<00:00:11.170> much<00:00:11.320> a<00:00:11.350> lesson<00:00:11.799> almost<00:00:12.100> more<00:00:12.430> like<00:00:12.459> a<00:00:12.610> tip

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:13.000 
so much a lesson almost more like a tip

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.209 
so much a lesson almost more like a tip
but<00:00:13.690> I<00:00:13.930> want<00:00:14.080> to<00:00:14.170> talk<00:00:14.350> to<00:00:14.500> you<00:00:14.619> today<00:00:14.799> a<00:00:14.980> little

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:15.219 
but I want to talk to you today a little

00:00:15.219 --> 00:00:19.560 
but I want to talk to you today a little
bit<00:00:15.520> about<00:00:16.770> intensity<00:00:17.770> and<00:00:18.100> dynamics<00:00:19.000> in<00:00:19.210> your

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:19.570 
bit about intensity and dynamics in your

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:22.020 
bit about intensity and dynamics in your
strumming<00:00:20.080> so<00:00:20.650> if<00:00:20.980> you<00:00:21.130> are<00:00:21.280> just<00:00:21.550> starting<00:00:21.730> to

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:22.030 
strumming so if you are just starting to

00:00:22.030 --> 00:00:24.270 
strumming so if you are just starting to
play<00:00:22.270> the<00:00:22.480> guitar<00:00:22.600> maybe<00:00:23.289> you've<00:00:23.530> you've<00:00:24.100> been

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:24.280 
play the guitar maybe you've you've been

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:27.060 
play the guitar maybe you've you've been
going<00:00:24.670> you've<00:00:24.880> learned<00:00:25.320> all<00:00:26.320> the<00:00:26.560> chords<00:00:26.950> and

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:27.070 
going you've learned all the chords and

00:00:27.070 --> 00:00:28.290 
going you've learned all the chords and
a<00:00:27.130> few<00:00:27.280> different<00:00:27.580> keys<00:00:27.789> you've<00:00:28.119> maybe

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:28.300 
a few different keys you've maybe

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:29.880 
a few different keys you've maybe
learned<00:00:28.570> some<00:00:28.810> strumming<00:00:29.170> patterns<00:00:29.590> some

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:29.890 
learned some strumming patterns some

00:00:29.890 --> 00:00:32.369 
learned some strumming patterns some
songs<00:00:30.190> I<00:00:30.580> think<00:00:30.970> one<00:00:31.510> thing<00:00:31.720> that's<00:00:31.900> common<00:00:32.140> to

00:00:32.369 --> 00:00:32.379 
songs I think one thing that's common to

00:00:32.379 --> 00:00:35.880 
songs I think one thing that's common to
find<00:00:32.770> is<00:00:33.160> everything<00:00:34.090> you<00:00:34.239> play<00:00:34.650> sounds<00:00:35.650> the

00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:35.890 
find is everything you play sounds the

00:00:35.890 --> 00:00:41.670 
find is everything you play sounds the
same<00:00:36.160> so<00:00:36.640> you<00:00:36.700> could<00:00:36.940> be<00:00:37.060> playing<00:00:40.560> you<00:00:41.560> know

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:41.680 
same so you could be playing you know

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:44.590 
same so you could be playing you know
here's<00:00:41.890> just<00:00:42.070> a<00:00:42.160> basic<00:00:42.579> regression

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:44.600 
here's just a basic regression

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.619 
here's just a basic regression
you

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:48.629 

00:00:48.629 --> 00:00:51.600 

no<00:00:49.629> matter<00:00:49.870> how<00:00:50.170> you<00:00:50.230> play<00:00:50.770> it<00:00:50.980> every<00:00:51.370> time

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:51.610 
no matter how you play it every time

00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:54.510 
no matter how you play it every time
every<00:00:52.180> section<00:00:52.570> sounds<00:00:53.079> about<00:00:53.470> like<00:00:53.739> that<00:00:54.040> if

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:54.520 
every section sounds about like that if

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:56.250 
every section sounds about like that if
you<00:00:54.670> were<00:00:54.760> on<00:00:54.820> the<00:00:54.970> intensity<00:00:55.510> level<00:00:55.870> from<00:00:56.079> I

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:56.260 
you were on the intensity level from I

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:57.990 
you were on the intensity level from I
always<00:00:56.680> think<00:00:56.920> of<00:00:57.040> it<00:00:57.160> from<00:00:57.370> one<00:00:57.640> to<00:00:57.670> a<00:00:57.910> hundred

00:00:57.990 --> 00:00:58.000 
always think of it from one to a hundred

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.500 
always think of it from one to a hundred
and<00:00:59.040> you're<00:01:00.040> maybe<00:01:00.220> at<00:01:00.460> sixty<00:01:00.820> seventy<00:01:01.300> and

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:01.510 
and you're maybe at sixty seventy and

00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:03.150 
and you're maybe at sixty seventy and
you<00:01:01.720> can<00:01:01.899> push<00:01:02.170> up<00:01:02.379> to<00:01:02.500> a<00:01:02.530> hundred<00:01:02.800> just<00:01:02.980> by

00:01:03.150 --> 00:01:03.160 
you can push up to a hundred just by

00:01:03.160 --> 00:01:06.330 
you can push up to a hundred just by
strum<00:01:03.489> and<00:01:03.610> harder<00:01:04.259> but<00:01:05.259> you'd<00:01:05.710> like<00:01:05.950> to<00:01:06.100> find

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:06.340 
strum and harder but you'd like to find

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:09.570 
strum and harder but you'd like to find
more<00:01:06.550> dynamics<00:01:07.150> this<00:01:07.540> is<00:01:07.810> for<00:01:08.229> you<00:01:08.580> there's

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:09.580 
more dynamics this is for you there's

00:01:09.580 --> 00:01:11.490 
more dynamics this is for you there's
two<00:01:10.030> kind<00:01:10.270> of<00:01:10.330> tips<00:01:10.600> I'm<00:01:10.869> going<00:01:10.960> to<00:01:11.110> give<00:01:11.170> you

00:01:11.490 --> 00:01:11.500 
two kind of tips I'm going to give you

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:15.020 
two kind of tips I'm going to give you
one<00:01:11.800> is<00:01:12.159> obviously<00:01:12.790> just<00:01:12.909> to<00:01:13.210> strum<00:01:13.540> less<00:01:14.050> so

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:15.030 
one is obviously just to strum less so

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:23.539 
one is obviously just to strum less so
if<00:01:16.030> you're<00:01:16.240> playing<00:01:16.450> this<00:01:16.750> strumming<00:01:17.140> pattern

00:01:23.539 --> 00:01:23.549 

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:26.029 

if<00:01:24.090> you<00:01:24.270> want<00:01:24.479> to<00:01:24.570> mellow<00:01:24.840> it<00:01:24.930> out<00:01:25.200> obviously

00:01:26.029 --> 00:01:26.039 
if you want to mellow it out obviously

00:01:26.039 --> 00:01:32.359 
if you want to mellow it out obviously
all<00:01:26.189> you<00:01:26.310> have<00:01:26.429> to<00:01:26.520> do<00:01:26.729> is<00:01:27.030> just<00:01:30.799> and<00:01:31.799> I<00:01:31.920> like<00:01:32.219> to

00:01:32.359 --> 00:01:32.369 
all you have to do is just and I like to

00:01:32.369 --> 00:01:36.140 
all you have to do is just and I like to
do<00:01:32.490> down<00:01:32.759> strums

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:50.960 

you

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:50.970 

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:52.730 

and<00:01:51.540> then<00:01:51.690> if<00:01:51.810> you<00:01:51.900> want<00:01:52.080> to<00:01:52.110> make<00:01:52.260> it<00:01:52.440> bigger

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740 
and then if you want to make it bigger

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:56.510 
and then if you want to make it bigger
throw<00:01:53.370> in<00:01:53.580> more<00:01:54.150> down<00:01:54.810> strum<00:01:55.320> so<00:01:55.740> you<00:01:56.130> notice<00:01:56.400> I

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:56.520 
throw in more down strum so you notice I

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.220 
throw in more down strum so you notice I
kind<00:01:56.790> of<00:01:56.880> did<00:01:57.030> that<00:01:57.060> in<00:01:57.390> there<00:01:57.630> so<00:01:57.900> here's<00:01:58.110> our

00:01:58.220 --> 00:01:58.230 
kind of did that in there so here's our

00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:10.300 
kind of did that in there so here's our
strumming<00:01:58.590> pattern

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:10.310 

00:02:10.310 --> 00:02:11.830 

and<00:02:10.700> now<00:02:10.850> will<00:02:11.000> you<00:02:11.090> make<00:02:11.240> it<00:02:11.270> bigger<00:02:11.540> by

00:02:11.830 --> 00:02:11.840 
and now will you make it bigger by

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:21.420 
and now will you make it bigger by
inserting<00:02:12.350> more

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:21.430 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:23.490 

okay<00:02:21.609> ultimately<00:02:22.540> eventually<00:02:22.959> you<00:02:23.260> can<00:02:23.349> just

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:23.500 
okay ultimately eventually you can just

00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.470 
okay ultimately eventually you can just
down<00:02:23.709> up<00:02:23.920> down<00:02:24.069> up<00:02:24.310> down<00:02:24.340> up<00:02:24.700> down<00:02:24.730> up<00:02:25.090> down<00:02:25.120> up

00:02:25.470 --> 00:02:25.480 
down up down up down up down up down up

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:33.290 
down up down up down up down up down up
down<00:02:25.510> up

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:33.300 

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:36.900 

okay<00:02:34.300> so<00:02:34.630> that's<00:02:34.810> what<00:02:35.260> you<00:02:35.380> can<00:02:35.500> do<00:02:35.740> more<00:02:36.610> and

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:36.910 
okay so that's what you can do more and

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:40.140 
okay so that's what you can do more and
less<00:02:37.209> obviously<00:02:37.980> is<00:02:38.980> sort<00:02:39.250> of<00:02:39.310> a<00:02:39.400> simple<00:02:39.700> fix

00:02:40.140 --> 00:02:40.150 
less obviously is sort of a simple fix

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:45.180 
less obviously is sort of a simple fix
but<00:02:41.400> to<00:02:42.400> get<00:02:42.550> into<00:02:42.849> more<00:02:43.150> dynamic<00:02:43.900> playing<00:02:44.230> one

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:45.190 
but to get into more dynamic playing one

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:47.360 
but to get into more dynamic playing one
thing<00:02:45.400> that<00:02:45.580> is<00:02:45.730> really<00:02:46.180> important<00:02:46.630> to<00:02:46.720> do<00:02:46.930> is

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.370 
thing that is really important to do is

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.979 
thing that is really important to do is
just<00:02:48.370> to<00:02:48.520> think<00:02:48.580> you<00:02:48.940> don't<00:02:49.150> have<00:02:49.300> to<00:02:49.630> strum

00:02:49.979 --> 00:02:49.989 
just to think you don't have to strum

00:02:49.989 --> 00:02:52.770 
just to think you don't have to strum
all<00:02:50.170> the<00:02:50.260> strings<00:02:50.590> every<00:02:51.430> time<00:02:51.670> you<00:02:51.970> strum<00:02:52.270> so

00:02:52.770 --> 00:02:52.780 
all the strings every time you strum so

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:54.120 
all the strings every time you strum so
I'm<00:02:52.840> going<00:02:52.959> to<00:02:52.989> give<00:02:53.110> you<00:02:53.200> example<00:02:53.709> here's<00:02:53.980> our

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:54.130 
I'm going to give you example here's our

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:59.770 
I'm going to give you example here's our
strumming<00:02:54.459> pattern<00:02:54.730> again

00:02:59.770 --> 00:02:59.780 

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:03.330 

so<00:03:00.620> now<00:03:00.830> if<00:03:01.040> I<00:03:01.160> take<00:03:01.460> that<00:03:01.700> and<00:03:01.970> I<00:03:02.120> just<00:03:02.480> strum

00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:03.340 
so now if I take that and I just strum

00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:06.280 
so now if I take that and I just strum
these<00:03:04.340> bottom<00:03:04.970> three<00:03:05.000> or<00:03:05.420> four<00:03:05.660> bass<00:03:05.900> strings

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290 
these bottom three or four bass strings

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:08.200 
these bottom three or four bass strings
and<00:03:06.590> I<00:03:06.830> do<00:03:06.890> the<00:03:07.190> same<00:03:07.220> strumming<00:03:07.880> pattern

00:03:08.200 --> 00:03:08.210 
and I do the same strumming pattern

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:10.360 
and I do the same strumming pattern
it'll<00:03:08.720> sound<00:03:09.050> a<00:03:09.290> lot<00:03:09.470> different<00:03:09.980> in<00:03:10.100> more

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:10.370 
it'll sound a lot different in more

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:22.750 
it'll sound a lot different in more
mellow

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:22.760 

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:24.699 

and<00:03:22.879> then<00:03:23.420> strum<00:03:23.900> them<00:03:23.989> all<00:03:24.170> and<00:03:24.379> it<00:03:24.470> sounds

00:03:24.699 --> 00:03:24.709 
and then strum them all and it sounds

00:03:24.709 --> 00:03:25.990 
and then strum them all and it sounds
finger

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:26.000 
finger

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.440 
finger
I<00:03:26.060> did<00:03:26.750> not<00:03:26.930> strum<00:03:27.260> any<00:03:27.410> harder<00:03:27.920> is<00:03:28.910> the<00:03:29.120> same

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:29.450 
I did not strum any harder is the same

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:32.590 
I did not strum any harder is the same
sort<00:03:29.900> of<00:03:30.640> anticipating<00:03:31.640> I'm<00:03:32.000> just<00:03:32.360> not

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:32.600 
sort of anticipating I'm just not

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:40.550 
sort of anticipating I'm just not
strumming<00:03:33.050> all<00:03:33.170> the<00:03:33.290> strings<00:03:33.650> I'll<00:03:34.460> back<00:03:34.760> off

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:40.560 

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:43.050 

and<00:03:41.560> if<00:03:41.830> you<00:03:41.950> can<00:03:42.160> combine<00:03:42.310> that<00:03:42.550> with<00:03:42.790> maybe

00:03:43.050 --> 00:03:43.060 
and if you can combine that with maybe

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:48.540 
and if you can combine that with maybe
some<00:03:43.330> softer<00:03:43.780> strumming

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:48.550 

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:52.080 

you<00:03:49.210> can<00:03:49.390> really<00:03:49.840> get<00:03:50.290> some<00:03:50.880> dynamics<00:03:51.880> and

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.090 
you can really get some dynamics and

00:03:52.090 --> 00:03:55.050 
you can really get some dynamics and
intensity<00:03:52.650> going<00:03:53.650> and<00:03:53.860> it's<00:03:54.640> just<00:03:54.880> as<00:03:55.030> simple

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:55.060 
intensity going and it's just as simple

00:03:55.060 --> 00:03:57.720 
intensity going and it's just as simple
as<00:03:55.570> not<00:03:55.870> strumming<00:03:56.440> all<00:03:56.620> the<00:03:56.860> strings<00:03:57.190> that

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:57.730 
as not strumming all the strings that

00:03:57.730 --> 00:04:00.090 
as not strumming all the strings that
might<00:03:58.000> be<00:03:58.150> difficult<00:03:58.390> for<00:03:58.720> you<00:03:58.960> to<00:03:59.050> do<00:03:59.260> because

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:00.100 
might be difficult for you to do because

00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:02.340 
might be difficult for you to do because
you<00:04:00.310> might<00:04:00.580> not<00:04:00.820> have<00:04:01.090> as<00:04:01.330> much<00:04:01.480> control<00:04:01.720> as

00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:02.350 
you might not have as much control as

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:04.380 
you might not have as much control as
you'd<00:04:02.650> like<00:04:02.680> with<00:04:02.920> your<00:04:03.700> if<00:04:04.180> you're

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:04.390 
you'd like with your if you're

00:04:04.390 --> 00:04:06.060 
you'd like with your if you're
right-handed<00:04:04.630> it<00:04:05.170> would<00:04:05.290> be<00:04:05.440> your<00:04:05.620> right<00:04:05.770> hand

00:04:06.060 --> 00:04:06.070 
right-handed it would be your right hand

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:07.950 
right-handed it would be your right hand
your<00:04:06.340> strumming<00:04:06.610> hand<00:04:06.940> if<00:04:07.090> your<00:04:07.210> left<00:04:07.420> it'd<00:04:07.720> be

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:07.960 
your strumming hand if your left it'd be

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:11.160 
your strumming hand if your left it'd be
your<00:04:08.080> left<00:04:08.290> hand<00:04:08.530> and<00:04:09.520> they<00:04:10.300> call<00:04:10.540> oftentimes

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:11.170 
your left hand and they call oftentimes

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:13.850 
your left hand and they call oftentimes
this<00:04:11.320> is<00:04:11.380> called<00:04:11.710> like<00:04:11.890> right<00:04:12.160> hand<00:04:12.400> technique

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:13.860 
this is called like right hand technique

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:17.100 
this is called like right hand technique
but<00:04:14.860> what<00:04:15.040> you<00:04:15.130> want<00:04:15.340> to<00:04:15.400> do<00:04:15.610> is<00:04:15.820> I<00:04:15.880> think<00:04:16.780> in<00:04:17.019> my

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:17.110 
but what you want to do is I think in my

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:18.630 
but what you want to do is I think in my
other<00:04:17.290> videos<00:04:17.650> I've<00:04:17.830> referenced<00:04:18.040> this<00:04:18.400> in

00:04:18.630 --> 00:04:18.640 
other videos I've referenced this in

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:21.990 
other videos I've referenced this in
strumming<00:04:19.030> don't<00:04:19.799> bend<00:04:20.799> at<00:04:20.980> the<00:04:21.010> elbow<00:04:21.580> when

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:22.000 
strumming don't bend at the elbow when

00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.330 
strumming don't bend at the elbow when
you<00:04:22.090> strum<00:04:22.420> try<00:04:23.050> and<00:04:23.200> make<00:04:23.350> most<00:04:23.680> of<00:04:23.860> it<00:04:23.980> happen

00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:24.340 
you strum try and make most of it happen

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:26.520 
you strum try and make most of it happen
in<00:04:24.520> your<00:04:24.730> wrist<00:04:25.000> and<00:04:25.840> you'll<00:04:25.990> get<00:04:26.170> a<00:04:26.230> lot<00:04:26.470> more

00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:26.530 
in your wrist and you'll get a lot more

00:04:26.530 --> 00:04:29.250 
in your wrist and you'll get a lot more
control<00:04:27.310> so<00:04:27.580> if<00:04:28.270> you<00:04:28.390> watch<00:04:28.540> my<00:04:28.840> elbow

00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:29.260 
control so if you watch my elbow

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:34.410 
control so if you watch my elbow
hopefully<00:04:30.010> it<00:04:30.310> doesn't<00:04:30.520> move<00:04:30.760> I<00:04:33.210> mean<00:04:34.210> if<00:04:34.330> you

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:34.420 
hopefully it doesn't move I mean if you

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:36.650 
hopefully it doesn't move I mean if you
really<00:04:34.900> want<00:04:35.050> to<00:04:35.140> dig<00:04:35.260> in<00:04:35.470> you're<00:04:35.680> gonna

00:04:36.650 --> 00:04:36.660 
really want to dig in you're gonna

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:39.540 
really want to dig in you're gonna
you're<00:04:37.660> gonna<00:04:37.750> have<00:04:38.050> to<00:04:38.260> but<00:04:38.830> a<00:04:39.070> lot<00:04:39.310> of<00:04:39.340> it

00:04:39.540 --> 00:04:39.550 
you're gonna have to but a lot of it

00:04:39.550 --> 00:04:41.670 
you're gonna have to but a lot of it
happens<00:04:39.730> right<00:04:40.120> here<00:04:40.300> in<00:04:40.390> the<00:04:40.480> wrist<00:04:40.750> and<00:04:41.080> it

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:41.680 
happens right here in the wrist and it

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:43.140 
happens right here in the wrist and it
will<00:04:41.860> give<00:04:42.040> you<00:04:42.160> a<00:04:42.190> lot<00:04:42.460> more<00:04:42.640> technique

00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:43.150 
will give you a lot more technique

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:45.420 
will give you a lot more technique
really<00:04:43.870> it<00:04:43.960> just<00:04:43.990> comes<00:04:44.290> down<00:04:44.410> to<00:04:44.560> practicing

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:45.430 
really it just comes down to practicing

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:48.060 
really it just comes down to practicing
one<00:04:46.270> song<00:04:46.570> where<00:04:46.840> I<00:04:46.870> find<00:04:47.230> that<00:04:47.350> this<00:04:47.530> really

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:48.070 
one song where I find that this really

00:04:48.070 --> 00:04:50.490 
one song where I find that this really
comes<00:04:48.820> into<00:04:49.000> play<00:04:49.090> is<00:04:49.570> the<00:04:49.630> song<00:04:49.990> beneath<00:04:50.350> the

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:50.500 
comes into play is the song beneath the

00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:53.190 
comes into play is the song beneath the
waters<00:04:50.860> by<00:04:51.430> Hillsong<00:04:51.670> it<00:04:52.150> has<00:04:52.300> this<00:04:52.510> cool<00:04:52.780> like

00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:53.200 
waters by Hillsong it has this cool like

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:57.510 
waters by Hillsong it has this cool like
rhythmic<00:04:53.800> kind<00:04:54.070> of<00:04:54.600> sound<00:04:55.600> to<00:04:55.840> it

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:57.520 
rhythmic kind of sound to it

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:03.080 
rhythmic kind of sound to it
you

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:03.090 

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:04.879 

so<00:05:03.720> you<00:05:03.780> might<00:05:04.050> notice<00:05:04.230> that's<00:05:04.560> a<00:05:04.650> lot<00:05:04.860> of

00:05:04.879 --> 00:05:04.889 
so you might notice that's a lot of

00:05:04.889 --> 00:05:07.670 
so you might notice that's a lot of
strumming<00:05:05.310> if<00:05:06.300> I<00:05:06.480> just<00:05:06.810> stick<00:05:07.110> on<00:05:07.290> these<00:05:07.440> bass

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:07.680 
strumming if I just stick on these bass

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:11.439 
strumming if I just stick on these bass
notes

00:05:11.439 --> 00:05:11.449 

00:05:11.449 --> 00:05:15.390 

it<00:05:11.960> doesn't<00:05:12.289> sound<00:05:12.469> huge

00:05:15.390 --> 00:05:15.400 

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:17.879 

now<00:05:15.940> I'm<00:05:16.090> not<00:05:16.300> going<00:05:16.479> to<00:05:16.540> strum<00:05:16.990> any<00:05:17.199> harder<00:05:17.710> on

00:05:17.879 --> 00:05:17.889 
now I'm not going to strum any harder on

00:05:17.889 --> 00:05:20.189 
now I'm not going to strum any harder on
the<00:05:18.010> smooth<00:05:18.250> strum<00:05:18.520> more<00:05:18.790> strings<00:05:19.389> it'll

00:05:20.189 --> 00:05:20.199 
the smooth strum more strings it'll

00:05:20.199 --> 00:05:32.270 
the smooth strum more strings it'll
sound<00:05:20.380> bigger

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:32.280
