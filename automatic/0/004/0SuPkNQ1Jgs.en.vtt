risk<00:00:51.390> you<00:00:51.510> can<00:00:51.660> always<00:00:51.960> pull<00:00:52.260> straight<00:00:53.160> out

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:53.190 
risk you can always pull straight out

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:55.549

of<00:03:13.510> texture<00:03:14.050> without<00:03:14.290> having<00:03:14.739> to<00:03:14.860> add<00:03:15.010> too

00:03:15.270 --> 00:03:15.280 
of texture without having to add too

00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:17.190 
of texture without having to add too
much<00:03:15.430> color<00:03:15.850> and<00:03:16.209> those<00:03:16.780> are<00:03:16.959> the<00:03:16.989> little

00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:17.200 
much color and those are the little

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:19.590 
much color and those are the little
subtle<00:03:17.590> details<00:03:18.010> that<00:03:18.250> I<00:03:18.400> prefer<00:03:18.880> especially

in<00:03:19.780> bags<00:03:20.110> but<00:03:20.769> this<00:03:21.010> is<00:03:21.250> a<00:03:21.280> very<00:03:21.640> large

00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.000 
in bags but this is a very large

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:25.130
