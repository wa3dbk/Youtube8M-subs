 will have to actively fill with water 

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:57.899
 and lithium in the most unexpected places at 

00:01:55.409 --> 00:01:59.969
 latitude well you understand the game first 

00:01:57.899 --> 00:02:02.130

00:01:59.969 --> 00:02:03.810
 child a basic understanding of language 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.729
 as such secondly at the sight 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:08.940
 next monster kids just 

00:02:05.729 --> 00:02:10.489
 start going crazy with fun subway 

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:13.319
 surfers 

00:02:10.489 --> 00:02:15.180
 well yes subway surfers this is the 

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:15.780
 popular game among preschool children 

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:18.630
 age 

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.440
 and you are 45 years old you are a bearded man and you tell me 

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:22.590
 play too 

00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:24.569
 Well, probably it is also normal to recall 

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:26.040
 what's the subway surfers main character all 

00:02:24.569 --> 00:02:28.140
 time running away from the police by 

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.910
 railway rails and to meet him 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.130
 trains are constantly rushing 

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:33.989
 who need to dodge than 

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:36.000
 the longer you play the more 

00:02:33.989 --> 00:02:38.700
 speed hero runs and dodge 

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:41.099
 it gets harder and harder the most 

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:43.080
 surfers perfectly develop common thinking 

00:02:41.099 --> 00:02:45.090
 and coordination is needed here 

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:47.000
 really decidedly clear and without 

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:50.760
 procrastination as in real life 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.900
 past games with the similar name google 

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.120
 play a dime a dozen 

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:56.519
 the meaning in all of them is the same and he 

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:58.290
 extremely simple in front of the player is 

00:02:56.519 --> 00:03:01.500
 field with lots of cards 

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:03.090
 they are all closed on each card on 

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:05.160
 the field is an exact copy 

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:07.890
 in one move you can flip 2 

00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.519
 cards and actually see what's on them 

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:10.890
 depicted 

00:03:08.519 --> 00:03:12.540
 your task is as short as possible 

00:03:10.890 --> 00:03:15.660
 time to remember finding everyone 

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:17.310
 images and find copies of them all games with 

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:17.970
 such a name suggest similar 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.709
 functional 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:21.660
 they usually offer three levels 

00:03:19.709 --> 00:03:23.970
 difficulties the higher the level the more 

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:26.519
 images on the playing field and of course 

00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:28.590
 the pictures themselves are different in this place 

00:03:26.519 --> 00:03:30.269
 the main thing is not to download the child a game with bare 

00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:32.130
 peasant women but what about similar games 

00:03:30.269 --> 00:03:35.980
 develop memory first you already 

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:38.110
 and so understood jog 

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:40.269
 games with a similar name are predictable 

00:03:38.110 --> 00:03:42.489
 thoroughly test the child's knowledge 

00:03:40.269 --> 00:03:44.739
 geography most games and do it 

00:03:42.489 --> 00:03:46.260
 very interesting way questions are asked 

00:03:44.739 --> 00:03:48.450
 on flags photos 

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:51.159
 attractions official language 

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:53.620
 location of the country on the map and even by 

00:03:51.159 --> 00:03:55.629
 the name of the capital is not such a variety 

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:57.910
 will make the child bored and if he will 

00:03:55.629 --> 00:04:00.220
 come here every day for 

00:03:57.910 --> 00:04:00.970
 a couple of months, then just learn the geography 

00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:03.220
 the globe 

00:04:00.970 --> 00:04:05.049
 a little earlier peers and at the same time 

00:04:03.220 --> 00:04:05.860
 English is because most games with 

00:04:05.049 --> 00:04:08.140
 by such name 

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:10.660
 go just as well with an English interface 

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:12.760
 isn't that the goal of parents to raise 

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:14.650
 their offspring the most clever and 

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:17.289
 prepared life that's it in such 

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:20.079
 foreshortening and worth treating the whole games 

00:04:17.289 --> 00:04:21.940
 like another step in a comprehensive 

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:23.979
 child development yes what to say if 

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:26.350
 numerous studies have proven that 

00:04:23.979 --> 00:04:28.210
 even people who play primitive 

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:30.669
 shooters are faster guided 

00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:32.650
 unfamiliar cities of course sho zadto then 

00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:33.340
 not so healthy for a child yet 

00:04:32.650 --> 00:04:35.139
 need to follow 

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:37.419
 so that at one point not 

00:04:35.139 --> 00:04:38.680
 turned the word we say no 

00:04:37.419 --> 00:04:40.870
 will become about 

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:42.669
 still please leave under this video 

00:04:40.870 --> 00:04:44.650
