00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:05.670
 I'll show you in this video 

00:00:03.350 --> 00:00:08.429
 different possibilities for retirees 

00:00:05.670 --> 00:00:10.230
 cut in the previous videos have 

00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:12.420
 I'm always the first last machine 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:15.470
 row gallop on back and on the 

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:18.750
 front stretched as right stitches 

00:00:15.470 --> 00:00:21.449
 and that makes for a uniform 

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:24.449
 nodule edge is also good for 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:27.810
 sewing is therefore the edge of the knot 

00:00:24.449 --> 00:00:30.900
 arises when you are in every row on the 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:33.630
 front and on the back the 

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:37.110
 first and last stitch respectively 

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:39.210
 right smear completely independent of 

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:43.350
 pattern so no matter what pattern you 

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:44.670
 always put first and last stitch 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.190
 right stitches 

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:51.809
 on the front and on the 

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:54.000
 back of the nodule edge succeeds 

00:00:51.809 --> 00:00:56.789
 Actually it is always a solid one 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.100
 even edge but many people 

00:00:56.789 --> 00:01:02.370
 prefer a chain edge of 

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:06.390
 maybe looks nicer and too 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:10.729
 It's not hard at all, catrin 

00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:15.420
 strictly so the first stitch always right 

00:01:10.729 --> 00:01:18.840
 then comes the pattern here it is 

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.520
 right stitches and the last one marches 

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:23.070
 always lifted off to the left 

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:26.150
 so how to knit the thread on the left 

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:29.520
 but the mesh would only stand out 

00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:33.060
 do not just knit on the 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.799
 mesh the right needle lift and whole 

00:01:33.060 --> 00:01:37.409
 as well on the back the first one 

00:01:34.799 --> 00:01:40.020
 Knit stitch right off no matter what 

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:42.030
 pattern then comes the pattern 

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:45.020
 continue to knit accordingly here 

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.020
 it meshes left 

00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:52.000
 and also on the back the last 

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:54.460
 Then lift the left hand stitch again 

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:57.220
 so how to knit to the left 

00:01:54.460 --> 00:02:00.460
 but do not scare but only the 

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:02.350
 Team the right needle manages me 

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:03.610
 her chain not so good lima already 

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:05.410
 be very relaxed 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:07.630
 so I try the first one 

00:02:05.410 --> 00:02:09.820
 two stitches and the last two 

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:11.920
 then knit especially tight 

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:14.190
 So not ausholend no long threads 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.190
 pull 

00:02:14.840 --> 00:02:23.030
 and for that reason I use one 

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:23.030
 we'll take a look at this 

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:31.140
 So you can see that very nice 

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:32.100
 difference between the nodule edge 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.140
 and tied 

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:37.500
 but I'm still a bit too 

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:39.840
 Therefore , I turn another one 

00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:42.340
 method to 

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:44.440
 Above all, the stitches are on me 

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:47.620
 a lot looser on one side than on 

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:50.380
 the other side if you think so too 

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:53.080
 then you can do the following 

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:56.050
 Incidentally, you can also simply 

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:58.120
 rows count every chain on the edge 

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:00.460
 corresponds to 2 1 

00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:03.700
 here the other side you see that 

00:03:00.460 --> 00:03:06.030
 a bit loose so we against it 

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:09.100
 can do 

00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:11.350
 but we stretch a cat rand with 

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:15.330
 an entangled first stitches with 

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:15.330
 an entangled last stitch 

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:25.410
 just as we did before 

00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:27.209
 do not knit the first machine like 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:29.790
 usual right but right 

00:03:27.209 --> 00:03:32.330
 entangled that means we do not sting 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:35.340
 from the front left are the mesh one 

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:38.370
 but from the right in the back thread 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:40.410
 the first round of work 

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:43.110
 get that was an entangled right 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:48.180
 stitch in pattern continue to stretch completely 

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:51.110
 normal and at the end again just like that 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:51.110
 you have to be careful 

00:03:52.070 --> 00:03:57.840
 the last stitch is lifted off to the left 

00:03:55.320 --> 00:04:00.630
 but entangled that means from the right 

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:02.850
 from the left behind in the back thread 

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:04.320
 pierce and lift off the stitches 

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:06.800
 that means you trust the mesh 

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:06.800
 easy 

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:13.860
 So always the first stitch on the right 

00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:16.830
 knit off and knit the last 

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:18.420
 machine left off and take off 

00:04:16.830 --> 00:04:21.030
 you see one clearly here 

00:04:18.420 --> 00:04:25.830
 difference so be synonymous with me 

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:29.310
 here the edge mesh much smaller 

00:04:25.830 --> 00:04:30.060
 and firmer so not as easy as 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:32.490
 before 

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:34.760
 especially on the other side where you 

00:04:32.490 --> 00:04:38.070
 get really unpleasant with me 

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:42.050
 It looks a lot better now and it does 

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:42.050
 creates a nicer cat edge
